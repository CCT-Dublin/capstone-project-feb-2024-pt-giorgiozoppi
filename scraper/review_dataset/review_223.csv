223,Beautiful Place to Stay,"When you walk into the lobby, you know you picked the right hotel.  We only stayed one night because it was our last night in Ireland.  I would definitely stay here again when we visit next time.  We didn't get to use the spa...that would have been wonderful.  We did have the buffet breakfast the morning we left.  Everything was hot and delicious.",5,2024,10,16
223,"Excellent, Would Recommend","Hotel was beautiful inside and out. 
They offer so much to entertain the kids like free board games and cards etc‚Ä¶ 
Food was outstanding, dinner and breakfast were both incredible. 
Oyr room was very hot due to the weather with no air conditioning (this was stated at time of booking) but there was a fan which helped us all sleep. Beds were very comfortable. 
1st time staying but wont be our last, would 10/10 recommend to couples and small families (we were 2 adults 2 kids). 
Pool was 1.4mtr so slightly too deep for our 3 and 5 year old but they loved it. There was a small pool for children but it was very crowded.",5,2024,08,03
223,Friends night out,Four of us (friends) returned to the Castleknock Hotel for a chat and some food. Yet again we were blown away by the staff and the food. Thank you to Maja who looked after us for the evening. This Gluten Free Dairy Free Vegetarian was a little concerned about my choices of food. Nothing was a problem to Maja. All our needs were met. Maja double checked everything with the Chef before bringing our food to the table. As for the Chef.... he's a keeper! Such delicious food and even a dessert was on the cards!! Thank you,5,2024,10,16

223,The amazing staff,"I could easily write about how gorgeous the hotel was but I wanted to take a moment to give a big thank you to the staff.. for me that is what made this entire stay special.. Laura and Lydia who worked near the lobby/bar area made it memorable.  They were beyond helpful, kind, and personable. I doubt they will see this but if they do.. LADIES THE SPICE BAG WAS AMAZING! thank you so much for your support!! 

With that being said.. the hotel was gorgeous.. the cocktails in the bar were delicious.. AND the location was great for what we needed..so A+ stay!!",5,2024,10,14
223,Relaxing break,"Very quiet room location. Rooms very clean. Only downside was the shower was very tiny.  Triangular in shape so little room to move and drainage grill right in the middle!.
Staff are very pleasant and welcoming, particularly Valerie at reception. Bar 22 restaurant is very noisy so if u don't like children running around eat in the restaurant. The swimming pool has seen better days but the javuzzi, sauna and steam rooms are very good.  The food is good. The location is great for Phoenix Park and lots to see and do in the area",4,2024,10,13
223,Impressive hotel,Really lovely hotel and facilities. Great buzz in hotel which fed into the experience. Enjoyed afternoon tea which was very nice and well presented. Enjoyed a great back massage in the spa and used the pool facilities. Friendly staff. I would stay again!,4,2024,10,08
223,"Lovely hotel, poor service","My family and I went to Castleknock Hotel for a reunion. We stayed for two nights. The hotel itself was lovely, nicely decorated and a great location. The food in the restaurants was great and we enjoyed afternoon tea as well. However, the service was abysmal. It was extremely slow, not always correct and just brought the overall experience down.",2,2024,10,01
223,Excellent Anniversary Experience,Fab hotel for an overnight stay celebrating our anniversary. Staff couldn't have been friendlier. The suite was really nice and food fantastic. The spa was the icing on the cake. Excellent treatments with great staff. Looking forward to our return ,5,2024,09,30
223,Coffee Morning,"Live locally and visit Castleknock Hotel a few times every year. Last Wednesday with a day off, l met one of my daughters there for coffee and snack early that morning.
Lots of free park and including EV charging facilities. Nice fitting and furniture in the lobby, bar and restaurant area. Lovely friendly staff and comfortable surroundings.",4,2024,09,29
223,Staying with my spouse and had a friend also stay at the hotel. Overall the stay was excellent. The check out andcharges,Couple and a friend also stayed at this hotel . Overall the stay was excellent. Upon check-out we were told we would be charged 43 Euros and was instead charged 143 Euros. Dishonest,3,2024,09,25
223,Lovely Stay!,"We enjoyed the Dine & Stay package - absolutely fabulous! 

The hotel is stunning, and the staff were really nice. 

We ate in the bar and the food and cocktails were amazing. 

We used the leisure centre and it was really clean. 

The breakfast was okay, the hot items weren‚Äôt as fresh as we‚Äôd hoped but there was a great selection of pastries etc and they were really good. 

We would stay again, would recommend!",5,2024,09,24
223,Leisure centre,"We had a really nice time at this hotel, staff wore very kind and accommodating, food was amazing and the rooms wore really clean and fresh. My only reason for taking one star away would be in relation to the leisure club we went down of a Sunday morning thinking it would be a nice relaxing morning however it was the complete opposite. There was kids everywhere in the leisure centre we know the hotel and leisure centre will obviously have kids in it that‚Äôs not my complaint at all  but the kids wore completely taking up the whole pool there was no where to swim or even get into the pool for that matter. I did notice there was a lifeguard however alot of the kids wore unsupervised by parents or guardians which meant they wore absolutely running wild around the leisure centre. I‚Äôm not sure if there was/is a set time for kids as I didn‚Äôt check beforehand but I would maybe suggest having the pool maybe split in two so the kids can have there fun and there‚Äôs room for others to maybe have a swim. Or if not already maybe have set times for the kids and adults. This may not always be the case but just thought I would leave a note for anybody maybe expecting a slightly different leisure centre or a calmer environment.",4,2024,09,24
223,Amazing üëè,"Amazing, should be 5* service is excellent everyone very friendly even though it was busy was no bother to the staff. Andrew couldn't do any more for us, as with the rest of the staff, food was top quality and the deserts and cocktails were 10/10, rooms were amazing, big huge rooms with a gigantic bed, great coffee machine in the room also, really enjoyed the stay, will be back again soon, thanks very much,

223,Wow ,"I stayed at the hotel for 3 nights attending a family wedding with the reception held at the hotel. I couldn't find any faults with the hotel, our room or staff I interacted with during my stay, it's a fantastic hotel and great location, I cannot recommend it highly enough ",5,2024,09,13
223,Fine,"3rd time staying. Stay was fine, however it was a little expensive.  Room 265 was very noisy outside until 3.30am with people shouting and talking - must have been leaving bar waiting on taxis because this room is right above the hotel entrance. I had asked for a quiet room so if wanting quiet avoid room 265 on weekends. Monday night was fine. Staff nice and friendly.  Bed big and comfy. Room clean. Nice location. ",4,2024,09,12
223,Fabulous overnight stay,"We booked after seeing a deal online. We stayed in the Guinness suite and it was stunning, we couldn't fault the room at all. The food was fresh and wonderful quality. Cocktails were to die for and the staff just made the hotel feel very welcoming and warm. We'd a brilliant stay and will definitely be back. ",5,2024,09,12
223,Family weekend break .,A weekend visit to family this hotel was lovely very clean and looked after . No expense spared on bathroom toiletries . Excellent breakfast buffet as well . My only concern was the amount of noise outside between midnight and 4am lots of loud talking kept me awake .,4,2024,09,07
223,Fantastic. Not a bad thing to say,"Amazing hotel just outside Dublin City centre! The staff couldn‚Äôt have been more helpful and were always polite and welcoming. 

It may look like it‚Äôs in the middle of nowhere but the nearest bus stop is a 5 minute walk and then the train station is a 15 minute walk and a journey into Dublin City Centre is less than ‚Ç¨3 and they run regularly between 6am and 11pm. 

The rooms were gorgeous with high quality facilities such as a coffee machine, Dyson hairdryer, a large smart tv and luxury toiletries. The breakfast was the best quality buffet breakfast I have ever experienced! 

Would recommend to anyone and would definitely return to this hotel ",5,2024,09,05
223,Special Birthday,"Lovely rooms, many extras, bed mattress "" delicious "". 
Staff, are extremely helpful,credit to the management. Breakfast caters for all, low on bread due to being left in a basket, hard! Low on cold meats, & cheeses! We had 3 day stay & most of Breakfast was repetitive. During stay 3 weddings, a bit noisy, so check before booking.  The Staff get our 5 STARS. ",4,2024,09,04
223,Average,"Everything was pretty average. It was very busy but the staff were very attentive at the bar. The pool was however quite dirty, mould on the wall and very cloudy water in the jacuzzi etc. it‚Äôs quite far out from the city if this is where you would like to spend your time whilst in Dublin. Wouldn‚Äôt be running back to this place.",3,2024,09,04
223,"Nice hotel to get a bit of peace, yet still be close to Dublin city centre","Great option for some peaceful rest yet close to Dublin city too. We were staying to go to Coldplay and it is a very nice hotel with good gym and pool. Looked like a nice golf course too though we did not use it. Food good in restaurant and good buffet breakfast. Weekends unsurprisingly there's a lot of wedding/parties as it has large ballrooms and facilities. But even though our room was near one of the rooms on sat night it was not too bad. Hotel does not have aircon which could be an issue if very hot, but was fine for us",4,2024,09,04
223,Beware of adjoining room placement.,Lovely and accommodating hotel with one exception‚Ä¶adjoining room doors are not soundproof so you feel like you‚Äôre sharing a room with a stranger. ,4,2024,09,04
223,Lovely hotel!!,Absolutely Lovely Hotel- Booked It As A Surprise For My Boyfriends Birthday And It Was Definitely Worth It. Had The Best Time <33,5,2024,09,03

We will be back",5,2024,09,01
223,Four star hotel Five star service,"We had an amazing stay here for our family break. The service is 2nd to none nothing was ever a bother to any member of staff special shout out to Elaine on reception & Iriana in the bar. The rooms were comfortable and spacious, the kids loved the wee backpacks. The pool is fab, the park & football net & the cinema room kept the kids well entertained.  The food in earth & vine was brilliant, again service was brilliant. The breakfast was one of the best I‚Äôve ever had at a hotel. 

I can‚Äôt wait to return",5,2024,08,29
223,Excellent hotel,Fabulous family friendly hotel the kids buffet dinner was wonderful such a fabulous range of choices on the restaurant menu plus the leisure facilities and the park and football nets not to mention the cinema room!! Children already want to go back ,5,2024,08,29
223,Fabulous staff,"Friendly, efficient and very helpful with superb attention to detail. They went above and beyond what could be expected bb",5,2024,08,27
223,Family short stay,"This was our third stay and again, we loved it. Plenty of parking, quiet location yet still central and large cosy welcoming lobby to relax in. Friendliest staff, Darragh in the restaurant is a gentleman. Clean, comfortable room. Welcome packs, cookies and milk and cinema for our kids was so lovely. Great amenities. Looking forward to coming back!",5,2024,08,24
223,Rubbish service,The staff is clueless and does the bare minimum and are very unwilling to help.  This was our wedding night and they absolutely ruined it. They did not set up the cot for our baby so we had to bring it up ourselves at 3 am. They also forgot to record our late check in so we had to go back down and fix it. ,1,2024,08,24
223,Top notch hotel..,"Nice big family room
Great food breakfast and dinner.
Plenty of seating for relaxing.
Staff couldn't have been better.
Ideal for visiting the zoo",5,2024,08,23
223,Castleknock Hotel stay,"Stayed for 3 nights - party of 2 adults & a 6 year old child. Hotel immaculately maintained inside and out. Extremely friendly staff, food excellent with great array of choice. Swimming pool fantastic and good clean warm changing room. Beds very very comfortable with room maintained to a very high clean standard.",5,2024,08,23
223,"Luxury, lovely & family friendly.","Lovely hotel, expensive for what it is but a really nice hotel.
Luxury looking from the car park to the entrance door, however I do feel there should be a porter/doorman or an automatic door as when you have children & trying to sort bags its hard works opening doors.
The check in process waa very easy, explaination of all amenties, direction to room  etc was on par.
The room is lovely, we ended up pushing the 2 singles together as was safer for our little ones to have 1 adult & 1 child in the king bed & newly put together king bed.
The bathroom has everything needed & more. Only downside of the shower cubicle, the water comes out the mibute you open the door & it is impossible to have a towel outside the door as it opens outwards.
The room was very warm and despite someone showing us supposidly how to use it, the room never cooled down so we had to have the windows open.
To turn the tv was alittle confusing, not just your standard press the on/off button, but we got there in the end (I do think a fresh remote bag is needed to prove it had been cleaned as it was alittle dirty). The tv has alot of channels which is great espec when you have little ones & adults who go to bed early or just want to relax.
We had dinner in Bar 22, was lovely, alittle pricey but that's to be expected. The children's buffet dinner is a great idea and really good value (for the fussy children there is such a selection they will find something. Would be nice if there was a salad you could help yourself to but that is a personal preference).
We had drinks in the lobby as the bar is no children. No issues at all there as the lobby has sofas, chairs, tables basically everything you need. Oh & also tabel service which is great.
Breakfast was average for a hotel, buffet hot food (but the staff serve you the warm food),  cold meata, cereals & a 'Kids Buffet' station with a pancake maker machine, nutella, pastries etc. The hot food wasn't the bed we had had considering the price of the hotel this did let down the hotel alittle. However a pot of tea made up for this (last hotel we had to go to a machine & when there are several of you it's time consuming).
Outside the hotels is really nicely kept, only issue is there is no walking path to the car park & sometimes cars/taxis pulling to the lobby area, don't look for people walking to the car park.
Our children saw other children walking around with Castleknock backpacks. We enquired into these & at ‚Ç¨15 per bag it is def not worth it. We got 2 & there is very little in the bag (I do honestly think ‚Ç¨15 is way too much & from a marketing point of view there is work to be done there as I wouldn't show or say what we got as people would think we were mad for paying that much, sorry but that is an honest point of view. But thankfully the only real bad part of the stay).
A 5 star review despite a few niggles & negatives we are really look forward to coming back again & will be keeping an eye on offers as we have now joined the hotel emails.

223,Great hotel and service!,"Stayed for a weekend family getaway and was very impressed with the service. Lovely girl at the front desk Amanda sorted out a table for us even though we had nothing booked Sat night, saved us from looking for something else for the kids! Very welcoming and friendly. Was also very accommodating. Waitress Sarah was very friendly too and great overall. Rooms were super clean and great facilities in the hotel. Nice touch of music in the hotel lobby too. Can‚Äôt wait for our next visit, highly recommend this hotel!",4,2024,08,19
223,Great place!,"Fantastic stay, super atmosphere, friendly and helpful staff. Very nice restaurant. We had a fantastic large suite, but no aircon (this was already mentioned online when booking). Dyson fan is present in room.",4,2024,08,18
223,Excedllent and enjoyable.,"We had a lovely meqal in Castlleknock Hotel to celebrate our recent anniversary.  We had a choice of restaurants.  The meal was excellent and the staff were most welcoming, courteous and professional.  
I would highly recommend it as a venue for an enjoyable meal to celebrate any occasion.",5,2024,08,14
223,Brilliant experience,"Location really suited us as we live in Dublin. My pregnant girlfriend really enjoyed her time here, all staff were so friendly and accommodating in any way they could. Food was so nice and fresh, facilities were clean and overall package was great price too!",5,2024,08,14
223,Great experience AGAIN..,"Great location, value and service. All staff extremely professional and friendly. Stayed many times before and will be staying again in future.",5,2024,08,13
223,Lovely Hotel but cooling a big issue,"Lovely Hotel, Beautiful Spa, unfortunately no air conditioning so could not justify the cost without this. ",3,2024,08,13
223,Fabulous stay!,Had a fantastic stay with husband here. Rooms were spotless and extremely comfortable. Everyone in the hotel was so nice. We will definitely be back! ,5,2024,08,13
223,Wonderful hotel,"Couldn't recommend this hotel highly enough. We stayed in one of the deluxe family rooms with our 6 year old daughter. The room was absolutely huge! Beds really comfy and everything spotless. The welcome bag was a huge hit! Breakfast is probably one of the best that I've had in a hotel, huge selection and very fresh. There's games in the lobby and a little playground outside the bar. Staff are really friendly and helpful. We used the pool which was also spotless. This is such a family friendly hotel and we will definitely be back. ",5,2024,08,12
223,Amazing Family Hotel,Had an amazing weekend with my family here. From check-in to the end of our stay I have to say everything was brilliant. Every staff member we met was so helpful and welcoming. The family rooms are ideal and the welcome pack from the kids really set the tone for our whole visit. Such a great touch. The food also was a big winner - especially the pancake machine for the kids!!!,5,2024,08,12
223,Girls night,Great location. Friendly staff. Perfect for kids with pool and playground and option of cinema club. Complimentary birthday cookies and milk. Nice relaxed atmosphere throughout hotel.,5,2024,08,11
223,Lovely hotel,"Hi I spent a short stay with my family and I can‚Äôt fault the hotel it‚Äôs clean and everything is perfect with staff and service, would definitely recommend the restaurants and other facilities and it‚Äôs really convenient to other locations in Dublin. The only fault was we caught COVID but that‚Äôs of no fault to the hotel itself just irresponsible residents üò°",5,2024,08,09
223,Amazing experience,"Myself and my partner had a one might stay to celebrate my birthday and all i can say is that we had a lovely experience. Our highlight was Earth and vine, to say the food was outstanding is an understatement. This restaurant is a must! Shane and Andy have definitely created an amazing menu. Cant wait to visit again üôÇ",5,2024,08,06
223,Stay at Castleknock Hotel,"If you are looking for a hotel that is convenient to Dublin and Emerald Park, that caters for a family and has wonderful staff, amenities, etc, I could not recommend The Castleknock Hotel highly enough. We were there for just two nights: 2 adults and 2 Children and it was an amazing experience. Wish it could have been a longer stay.",5,2024,08,05
223,"Nice hotel, disappointing food","Hotel was nice but full of kids running about, food was very diappointing, frozen in the middle and pasta was mush, rooms are very nice and had everything we needed but was woken up at 6.30am by very loud music from the gym below us and we were two floors above. Would make sure to request a quiet room when you book and would give the restaurants a miss. Breakfast was good and had a good array.",3,2024,08,04
223,Beautiful hotel,"This hotel was fabulous we absolutely loved it we went on a night away to get time together with out the kids. It's definitely our new favourite and we will definitely return. Room was spotless, staff lovely, food was v nice üëå  and we got a massage üíÜ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  which was also perfect. Such a beautiful hotel and we can't wait to return ",5,2024,08,04
223,"Worth the price, just!","Overall, nicely run hotel with good facilities.  Our kids loved their stay.  The staff, in general, appeared tired and occasionally impatient. This was surprising given the reputation of the hotel but likely a sign of the times with staff shortages coupled with a busy summer.  It is just about worth it for the price and I would consider returning in the future.",4,2024,08,03
223,All round excellent experience!,"We have just returned from the best night away. Everything was perfect from the minute we arrived. Lovely big clean room, comfy beds and a great experience at the pool, even providing floats for the kids. Dinner was perfect with the best kids options I‚Äôve ever seen; a buffet with everything you can imagine a child to want, including drinks and dessert. Staff were friendly and kind and the laid back atmosphere ensured a relaxing stay. Breakfast was amazing too with so many options. We only wished we could‚Äôve stayed longer!",5,2024,08,03
223,Lovely Hotel But Restaurant Needs Improvement,"We enjoyed our stay at the Castleknock, but our dinner experience at the 22 Bar & Restaurant unfortunately marred our visit. The restaurant was quite a disappointment. Upon arrival, we were instructed to find our own seats in the patio area, which is something we had never encountered before. We managed to find the only available table, but several parties arriving after us were left without seating. The food and service was subpar, with 40-minute waits between courses and plates left on our table for at least 20 minutes after we had finished.
Despite this, the hotel itself has beautiful grounds, and the staff are generally pleasant and friendly. Breakfast was a much more enjoyable experience, with helpful staff and a good selection of food.",3,2024,08,02
223,Wonderful stay,"Stayed for a couple of nights with my husband for a birthday getaway. We had a very comfortable stay, the room was large and well appointed. The pool and gym are fab in this hotel. There was an unfortunate issue in the restaurant on our first night, we could not get the food we ordered and had to re-order from a limited menu. This was out of staff's control who were very apologetic. Special mention to the Manager Ciaran who handled the situation with great professionalism by ensuring we and other affected diners were well looked after.  Dinner on our second night in the restaurant was excellent, cocktails in the cocktail bar afterwards hit the spot. Staff are welcoming and friendly. We look forward to returning soon.",4,2024,07,31
223,"Loveless food, no child lock on the windows of the rooms. Kids walking on the roof?!","Zero salad on breakfast except for basic lettuce and tasteless olives? Absolutely no basics like tomatoes cucumbers peppers No cheese except gor blue cheese snd goat‚Äôs cheese that not many likes. Everything in the menu is ruined with some yucky sauce even basic fish and chips or BLT sandwich. 
No butter or olive oil in anything. Even in once a week kids open buffet they‚Äôre so proud of. 
No child lock on windows, kids found walking on the roof and they didn‚Äôt do anything about it and it happened again? But they looked as if they were going to put child locks and even claim all the windows had child lock? 
I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this place  unless they change their restaurant and windows security. 
Besides these factors staff is amazing. They‚Äôre kind and loving. Hotel is clean and comfortable but food was bad and expensive. Wouldn‚Äôt repeat.

223,Anniversary Trip,"My husband and I had a fantastic stay for our first anniversary! The staff were so friendly and helpful, the food and cocktails were great. The only thing was the jacuzzi wasn‚Äôt working which was a shame. The room was modern and spacious. We‚Äôll definitely be back! ",5,2024,07,31
223,Summer weekend break,"This was our first time staying here and overall we were very impressed by this hotel, we couldn't fault it. The staff were so welcoming and friendly. The food was outstanding and such a variety of options especially for dietary requirements or picky eaters. The rooms were beautiful and so comfortable. They have elemis shampoo/conditioners & shower gels and Dyson hairdryers in every room which was a lovely surprise. The hotel and spa were so beautifully decorated and clean. I would definitely recommend this hotel to family and friends. We will 100% be visiting again. ",5,2024,07,30
223,Lovely overnight hotel stay,"This was our 2nd time staying here. We had a very relaxing stay. Although it was busy, this hotel had a lovely welcoming atmosphere. Will definitely come back.",5,2024,07,28
223,Family hotel,You need to be a lover of children to enjoy this hotel . The hotel was noisy children everywhere . Food is mediocre . We are in the bar as it was the only adult only area . Bar staff were friendly and helpful but unfortunately they do t cool the food . We sent ours back and so did our adjoining table. Golf course was a typical hotel course but pro shop manager was delightful,2,2024,07,27
223,A Gem of Ireland,"This quint place nestled in the countryside of Ireland is a gem.  Loved our room overlooking the golf course. We were celebrating our 42nd anniversary and the hotel left champagne and balloons in our room, which was a very pleasant surprise.  We had rented a car so the parking privileges were great, the bonus was free electric charging station for the car.  The buffet breakfast was delicious and there was a lot of variety to chose from. Overall the hotel was great, the only disappointment was the pool.  Its nothing like the pictures and there was construction going on, so only part of the pool was available and wasn't too clean, so we didn't take advantage to it.  But, other then that the staff were helpful and friendly and it was a great stay for visiting Ireland for the first time.",4,2024,07,23
223,Family event,"I attended a large family event on Saturday 20th July.  I can‚Äôt recommend this hotel highly enough.  The venue, food and service were second to none.

Safe to say we will be returning and on behalf of Sean and I and our family thank you so much for making Karl's day so special.,5,2024,07,22
223,Cocktail night,"I met a friend in Friday and we decided to treat ourselves and we had some fabulous cocktails made by a wonderful barman, Adam. Very skilled and took the time to help decide what we should order to ensure we thoroughly enjoyed our evening. Would definitely be back.",5,2024,07,22

223,Wedding,"We had our Wedding in Castleknock hotel on the 19th of July and it was amazing. Both wedding coordinators Ciara and Leone were a dream to work with and made the whole experience so enjoyable. From our first ever viewing up until the day after our wedding, Ciara and Leone made us feel so relaxed and helped in every way they could.",5,2024,07,21
223,Great night away,Stayed the night after being there for an event. The event room was absolutely stunning. Special thanks to the 2 lovely bartenders Chloe and Eddie they were extremely helpful and made the night so smooth and also the receptionist Catherina. ( I believe that's her name),5,2024,07,21
223,Great spa and afternoon tea - shame about the changing rooms,"I went with friends for a spa and afternoon tea day. The spa relaxation room and massage were great, however it is badly let down by the disgusting pool changing rooms and shower which are filthy, small and overcrowded. In the 5 hrs we were at the spa and pool, the changing rooms and showers were not cleaned despite having a water aerobics class and a mother and toddlers session  - pretty grim. The towels given are thin and small - not what you would expect from a 5* hotel. However, the afternoon tea we had was very good with plentiful tea and cakes in a pleasant setting.",2,2024,07,18
223,Excellent stay,Our family enjoyed our one night stay. The hotel was very accommodating to young kids and the food in the restaurant was excellent. One of the best hotels we stayed in during our 14 day trip. Highly recommend.,5,2024,07,17
223,Disappointing stay,Arrived for a family break over the long weekend.  Arrival was very promising but quickly went down hill.  Food extremely disappointing and pool very unclean ,3,2024,07,17
223,Highly recommend!,This hotel has it all! We will definitely return! We loved it! Beds are huge! The food was also fab! ,5,2024,07,17
223,Family Meal July 2024,"Popped in for a family meal on Sunday last into the bar. Food was outstanding, service was amazing. Special thanks to Aoife, she went above and beyond for us. We had gotten tea at the end, the pot was leaking she spotted it straight away, that's what you call a clever staff member who thinks on her feet. She is a credit to your hotel.",5,2024,07,16

223,Castleknock Dublin,"Very good property, fantastic location, clean rooms, Great facilities and very friendly staff. Preparation before the conference was very well done.",5,2024,07,16
223,Business traveller.,Nice hotel but if you want a good night sleep then maybe try another hotel.   Doors banging plus very thin walls  ,3,2024,07,15
223,great but poor food,"Great hotel but food choice let it down. 
We got room service the first lunch and it was cold.the next night we got it agin as we have two young kids it was cold and the order was wrong I asked for my soup to be heated (ice cold)and he took it down and came back without a spoon I asked fir a spoon and he never came back I had to go down to reception for one by the time I did it was cold again",4,2024,07,14
223,Great for a family getaway,"I stayed here with my family (2 adults, 1 child, 1 toddler) for 3 nights and would highly recommend. The hotel is very family friendly, whilst still being relaxing and sophisticated.

We ate in the restaurant 2 nights and food was delicious each time. The staff were lovely and very attentive.

The pool is great for children, there is a small baby pool, small child‚Äôs pool and the bigger main pool. 

The cinema room is a fab way to entertain the kids at night and they provide plenty of snacks ( the cookies are to die for!!)

We had a standard family room which was slightly on the smaller side but very clean. The bathroom is a decent size and it‚Äôs great to have a seperate bath and shower.

We used Castleknock as a base for our travels, it‚Äôs approx 30 mins to Emerald Park and about 15 to Dublin Zoo. Would definitely recommend these attractions for families.

Overall we had a great short break and would definitely recommend to family and friends. ",5,2024,07,14
223,Family friendly in a great location,"We stayed a single night for our first visit to Dublin Zoo the following day. Very smooth check-in, very family friendly restaurant and swimming pool. The family room was a tad cramped but was ok for the night. Kids slept well in the end. Room was very hot overnight, our only negative.",5,2024,07,10
223,Excellent hotel,Spotless hotel with excellent staff and gorgeous food. Couldn‚Äôt fault anything if I tried. Highly recommend for families or even a break away. ,5,2024,07,09
223,Ok stay - some nice touches,"Stayed here recently, abit torn between an average and good rating.

There were some nice touches. free board games available for the children to play, a playground right near the dining area (so children could play whilst waiting for food or parents having drinks), waving the cost of of cappuccino at breakfast (instead of having a standard coffee or tea).

On the downside, the food menu in the evening was restrictive with burgers, curry, fish and chips etc. could do with some more imaginative dishes. Service was slow at first, but got better. Breakfast had a wide enough range, but I have always thought cook to order hot breakfasts are better than the hot buffet on offer here (the food dries out when sitting there). 

The room was ok with a big bed though the shower on small side. Staff all seemed very pleasant though.",3,2024,07,09
223,"Great facility, super service and excellent food","We stay regularly in the Castleknock Hotel. This weekend, we stayed and hosted a family get-together of 16 in the 22 Restaurant. Our overall experience was great - wonderful food and faultless service. We highly recommend the hotel.",5,2024,07,09
223,Spa and lunch,"Myself and my friend booked in and i had a fabulous treatment today by Jennifer in the Spa, she was absolutely amazing. The staff are so kind and welcoming and communicationfor booking was so efficient and informative,

223,"Highly recommended, looking forward to returning at some time in the future.",A Birthday Celebration which couldn't have been better. From the helpfulness of Reception staff to the attentive friendly restaurant staff Emma and Orla in particular to the fabulous reasonably priced food. The leisure facilities are lovely.

223,Beautiful hotel,"5 of us stayed for 2 nights in 2 rooms for a celebration break.  We had a wonderful experience in this  gorgeous hotel. Bedrooms were spotlessly clean with really comfortable beds and great pillows!  Bathroom had both a bath with shower and a separate waterfall shower. Food was great, we had lunch and dinner in Bar 22.  Staff were nice and helpful. Lots of choice for breakfast. There is a variety of options in the various bars and a lovely ambience in the spacious lobby area.  Richi in the Limetree bar was really great! The hotel is away from the city in gorgeous surroundings overlooking the golf course.  We had a great time and would be delighted to return here again.",5,2024,06,26
223,Happy,"Loved our stay!! The breakfast and the gym were excellent! The bar staff were very obliging! They even organised a take away breakfast, a taxi and a wake up call for our very early departure. Thank you! ",5,2024,06,25

223,"Castleknock Hotel, lovely location for a Saturday night.","We went to the Castleknock Hotel on Saturday evening for a family get together. Just an informal night. It was very busy ( Weddings, private functions and groups) but the staff found us a nice table in the rear dining area. The bar food menu was a very good selection and we all thoroughly enjoyed the meal, the service and the ambience. We then went into the side bar and enjoyed the rest of the evening. A special mention to Andrew Sherlock for his service, banter, professionalism and personal touch. Hotel Management should have him as a role model for the rest of the staff.",5,2024,06,24
223,"Good option, friendly and accommodating staff","Stayed here for business last month.  First time, was 'cautiously concerned' heading into the trip but for the purposes we were there worked out fine.   There is one caveat, the rooms do not have A/C and the stay was during one of the warmest weeks in 
Dublin.  My colleague had a room across the hall, facing west and the afternoon sun combined with heat, made it hard to sleep.  This is a rarity weather-wise in Dublin, however a heads up.  

Staff was accommodating, gym was promptly open every morning.  Wish they would open earlier, however got my exercise in.  Breakfast Buffet had plenty of options and selections; from a light continental to a full Irish breakfast.

Did have dinner two evenings at the restaurant and it was fine.  Fish and Chips were really good and the Indian Cauliflower was also solid.",4,2024,06,23
223,Amazing place!,"I recommend this nice hotel! I was impressed about cleaning, decoration and wellcoming staff! The meal was very good and the price good! All staff was with the smile on their lips and the service provided was 10***As we visited first time this hotel and restaurant we received a tour to the pull,playground and restaurants by the manager( Ileana) Thank you very much!!!",5,2024,06,23
223,Exceptional hotel.,"From start to finish (3days) our experience was fantastic. From the comfort of the rooms, cleanliness, staff, facilities and attention to detail, the entire stay was exceptional. The staff make the hotel. It‚Äôs, busy and vibrant, very family friendly, but although it‚Äôs busy, you can go about your stay without feeling like anything else is happening apart from your good time. Food is great, always fresh breakfast, lots of choice. 

Only downside was the pool and changing rooms, they need attending to more frequently to make sure they are tidy and clean. Pool area needs refurbishing.",5,2024,06,23
223,Excellent hotel,"A fantastic hotel , a great experience from start to finish. Everyone so friendly and accommodating and the bar staff Andrew and Oliver exceptional and couldn‚Äôt do enough to make our stay perfect.

223,Great staff in Castleknock Hotel,"I was in Castleknock Hotel for a two week period for work training. During this time I found the staff and facilities to be top class. But what sets the Hotel apart are its staff. Nothing was too much trouble, they went out of their way to be helpful and friendly. The staff in the restaurant deserve a special mention, they were warm, welcoming and very professional. Thanks Guys Cheers James",5,2024,06,21
223,Wedding party,We were at a neighbours wedding.the staff were brilliant and reception area was great.the was not one problem with anything.,5,2024,06,18
223,Ruined birthday surprise,"Paid for a bottle of wine and a happy birthday balloon to be in the room for arrival.
Neither was there, went down to reception. Wrong wine and no balloon 10 minutes later, phoned reception. They asked me to resend all confirmation emails. Absolute terrible lack of communication and have been completely ignored in emails since. Such a shame cos otherwise a lovely place but this has certainly put me off ever returning. ",1,2024,06,17
223,Too expensive 4 star hotel.,"Expensive, poor value for money. the most expensive but worst hotel I stayed at in Ireland!
Spa and pool closed throughout my stay , a major loss although I was given a 20 per cent refund of my room rate.
Unsmiling restaurant staff, perhaps a management problem.
Breakfasts okay but disgusting sausages and stale croissants, not good for this hotel.",3,2024,06,17

The room was perfect, restaurant was busy but we were never turned away, just spoken to with care and respect (our fault we had not made a booking) and when we did get a table, we were served promptly and our lovely server Alexia was great! Even going out of her way to get our daughter crayons to colour. All the staff are a credit to the hotel and really add to the stay! ",5,2024,06,10

223,Our Stay,"Great value

If you‚Äôre looking for a hotel to relax and still be close to Dublin as it‚Äôs only a 25 mins drive away this hotel is the one! ",5,2024,06,09
223,Amazing hotel,We had a great stay. Hotel was spotless. Staff were so helpful. My 2 girls loved the pool and the the evening menu was amazing.,5,2024,06,05
223,Extremely Happy with our visit to the Castleknock hotel,"Just back from my stay with the family and I cannot fault one thing about the hotel the staff where unbelievable helpful and accommodating at all times the small details most hotels miss this hotel picks up on , bottle openers on the walls of the corridors , vending machines for this late night munchies to wet bag for your wet swimwear down at the pool literally thought of everything , I haven‚Äôt tased nicer restaurant food in any other hotel in Ireland , the Korean bbq wings I‚Äôm still dreaming about ü§§ 12/10 experience will be back again very soon üëè (my little lad got to take a few photos with the Ireland men‚Äôs football team also , squad where really nice had lots of time for the kids , just topped off the stay really) .",5,2024,06,04
223,Issues with hotel room,"Nice hotel but unfortunately not a hotel to visit if you want to get sleep. 

Room too hot to sleep even with windows open and electric  fan in room plus music could be heard from event. ",2,2024,06,04
223,Food disappointing,"Went for evening meal, ordered seafood platter for 2 and a prawn caesar salad and fish tacos all to be brought out at once. I had the prawn caesar here on numerous occasion during lunch times and it's a safe bet.... The seafood platter was awful, the only thing  that hit the mark was the bread.... Mussels were watery, obviously frozen as were the crabclaws..... Coming from an island off the West Coast I know what both should taste like. In fairness the server took them off the bill. Next time we will chance earth and vine",2,2024,05,31
223,Our 2nd enjoyable stay in Castleknock Hotel,"Lovely stay, pool, small playground, room and pool were very good. Great variety at breakfast and ate in the bar on one night, was very good. However, would have to say that the kids burger was huge, neither of my boys could finish it (3 &5). 
Rooms quite spacious- stayed in a deluxe family room with a queen bed and 2 single beds. FYI only one set of bed rails in the hotel so pack own if needed. We kindly got the set and added one of our own and pushed one bed against wall. 
Only minor issue we had was on check in - wasn‚Äôt overly friendly and didn‚Äôt give any information on breakfast, pool, where are room is located etc. had to ask as we walked away how we get to our room. Didn‚Äôt affect our overall stay thankfully and would highly recommend otherwise.
So close to the zoo / phoenix park which was perfect for us. We also visited the Explorium during our stay which wasn‚Äôt far either. 
We will hopefully make it back again in the future.",4,2024,05,31

223,Disappointing,"Sadly I experienced many issues that were quite unexpected. The first being during check in. We arrived at midnight and the person on the reception desk had quite an abrupt approach - there was no warm or friendly welcome.
This was followed by going to my room and  being presented with sheets that had disgusting marks on them. 
My mum was my guest and  she was looking forward to the cooked breakfast. Disappointingly this was tepid. 
Finally we decided to have a treatment in the spa and I had a gel manicure.  The therapist who did my treatment was not engaging and no matter how much conversation I tried to make, it was not reciprocated much. However, the other staff at the spa were very attentive and friendly.
Finally I left with my nails done and usually gel nails will last two weeks for me but currently I have one gel nail that lifted a day after the treatment and another few nails split. 
I have been to many hotels around the world and l have never had a bad experience let alone several during one stay. I am usually a tolerant person but just felt so disappointed by Castleknock. My parents stayed at the hotel 11years ago and spoke fondly of it. My mum was my guest and she was looking forward to returning but after this stay was left with a distasteful memory. 
I have never written a review about a hotel but felt compelled to do so after my stay at Castleknock, 
I have visited many wonderful hotels across the world and left feeling like I want to go back, unfortunately this is a hotel that I will not recommend to others and sadly won‚Äôt be returning. I do hope no other guests endure the same experience I received. ",1,2024,05,26
223,Lovely Stay,Stayed with a friend for a catch up. Was perfect. We were allowed to check in early as room was ready. Spent the afternoon at the spa and had 2 fab treatments. Lovely dinner included and nice touch with Prosecco in the room. Would definitely go back ,5,2024,05,24

223,Wonderful Night,"We had the most memorable evening at the Castleknock Hotel.  Our Server Daria (hope this is correct spelling).  All the staff are just so friendly helpful and professional.  And a very special THANK YOU to Ciaran McGee, who treated us like royalty.  He is THE nicest man we had the pleasure of him looking after us in the stunning Cocktail Bar.  THANK YOU ONE AND ALL, with special thanks to Daria and Ciaran McGee.",5,2024,05,21
223,West Dublin Retreat,"Hotel is situated in a quit part of West Dublin, but still with in easy reach of major sites and infrastructure. A lovely venue with a good ambiance, which is reflected well by the staff",5,2024,05,20
223,Avoid the Food- Awful,"Went here for a birthday dinner. We ate out the back and food from bar menu. We‚Äôre locals and tried this place a year ago, was awful then but gave it another chance.

Absolutely awful again. We both ordered the chicken burger which was 21 euro and one of the only course that came with sides included. House burger is 22 euro with no chips! Sides are 4.95. Massively overpriced for what it is.

Burger was lukewarm, chips were over cooked yet cold and a miserable dead excuse for a salad was thrown on side of plate. I‚Äôve had better food in canteens.

So disappointing as the ambience is nice. The staff seem plentiful but are generally clueless- we asked for ketchup, the only ask of the staff. Never came. 

The hotel was busy, they clearly make enough from the bar and rooms and don‚Äôt seem to really care about the food offering.

We know a lot of local families of similar profile and the consensus is the same as regards the food.

Go to the golf club (next door) or the carpenter pub. Much better value and better service. No more chances- We won‚Äôt be back!",2,2024,05,19
223,Lunch with a return booking for a weekend stay ü•∞,"I'm staying here in a few weeks time with my sister who's coming over from the UK so took a little trip today to locate it. Had a lovely lunch out in the sunshine under the canopy which was great as it was so hot. Even though it was very busy the service was great,  the girls were lovely,  friendly & chatty.  I had the fish tacos & they were delish along side chunky chips & garlic ciabatta. My mam has an intolerance to garlic & they catered to her needs with no fuss. I spoke with Agnes at reception about staying in a couple of weeks, as I'm a wheelchair user & don't necessarily need an accessible room. She was so kind & helpful & showed me 3 room types so I could see what would suit which was great.  All rooms were lovely so looking forward to my stay. Should be great üòä",5,2024,05,19
223,Very nice stay,"Nice rooms, good service and very kind staff that help you for every need. A bit far from the center, but if look for a quite place, this is highly recommended",5,2024,05,19
223,Great Spot,"We had a great time staying at Castleknock Hotel last weekend. It wasn't our first time and it won't be our last. The hotel looks great and the staff were very helpful at check in and with any queries we had. I found the facilities, particularly the pool to be fantastic. The hotel strikes a great balance between catering to families and offering peace and quiet to adults.
We ate at the Earth and Vine restaurant which was fantastic, it looked great, the food was brilliant and the staff were a cut above, it was a great experience from start to finish. My highlights were the velout√© and the lemon tart.

We can't wait to get back.",4,2024,05,16
223,No way.,"we arrived at 5:50 p.m. on a Saturday with our two children. we thought we would enjoy the swimming pool with them but we were immediately told that no, it closes at 6 p.m. no concept of schedules on Booking, I didn't find it on your site either. We had to explain this to our 3 year old son. very disappointed. for the evening, no room for the meal before 8:30 p.m. to finally be served after an hour and a half. not very warm welcome, staff who complain to us about not receiving tips from their customers. finally, room without air conditioning, huge cobwebs on the curtains. For a 4 star at this price, it‚Äôs more than disappointing. I absolutely do not recommend this stay.",1,2024,05,15
223,Peaceful,"Nice and relaxing.
There was music on but I went to relax.

Plenty of different places to sit were it was just silent and have a drink and a chat with my wife.

That's what I went for and that's what I got.",5,2024,05,14
223,Family Stay,"I have stayed here before and is a brilliant location in close proximity to Phoenix Park, the Zoo and golf. Good value and food and bedrooms are clean and spacious. Ideal for families",5,2024,05,13

223,An excellent hotel,"From England and with family living in Castleknock we have stayed at this hotel a number of times. 
Rooms, service, staff and food all of a high standard. Staff well trained and pleasant. Parking convenient. A reduction given for returning customers and stays over 3 nights. Book directly with reservations dept! ",5,2024,05,09
223,Finally family friendly luxury in Ireland!,"Best hotel I‚Äôve stayed in, that caters to families. My experience of any hotel that offers deals to families is that it‚Äôs a ‚Äògreasy spoon‚Äô, this is the complete opposite. This hotel managed to marry luxury, style, decadence with ‚Äòit‚Äôs ok to bring your kids‚Äô. Hotel was absolutely beautiful and has adult only areas like the lime tree bar. It has designated kids times for the swimming pool and a completely separate spa to ensure total peace and quiet. 
Staff were extremely helpful, hotel was spotlessly clean. Little welcome packs complete with cuddly toys and sweets were left for each of our 3 kids- an excellent extra!
Hotel is so handy for travel to Dublin centre, Dublin zoo, emerald park. 
We will definitely return, - without the kids!",5,2024,05,08
223,"Nice hotel, but dinner a let-down.","The Castleknock Hotel is billed as a 4 star quality establishment of long standing and my wife and I stayed there this week. First impressions are good, a fine hotel just about 20 minutes outside Dublin and has lovely views of the golf course from most rooms. We chose the dinner, B&B package at 293 euros as we had a voucher from our children for the stay.  Our room was spotless and comfy, and we had booked for dinner at 7 p.m.  The 3 course dinner menu was limited to fish and chips, penne pasta, burger and chicken dishes but no steak visible here.  Stareters of Caesar salad, followed by Burger and fish was average at best, but I noticed they had midweek dinner for two with a bottle of wine for 85 euros. After our experience, we would not be availing of the offer.  This is a lovely hotel, but charging high restaurant prices for what I would call bar food, is not good value. I would like to mention the staff here, most of whom are not irish. They work very hard and are mannerly and friendly. They go to great lengths  to look after the guests and are very impressive.  These workers are lovely people and deserve great credit for making us feel welcome. Our stay was enjoyable but dinner was dissapointing.",4,2024,05,08
223,Castleknock hotel stay,Stay was comfortable but hotel was very overpriced for one night. A nice spacious hotel and very comfortable rooms  ,4,2024,05,08

223,Sunday lunch,"We met up with another couple from abroad in the hotel on Sunday for lunch as it was most central place for us to meet up and we were looking forward to a nice lunch. The hotel is lovely and I could not fault the excellent and most friendly Staff or the surroundings as everything was beautiful. The
Lunch was the big letdown! A very generic type menu which has become so jaded as it is being trotted everywhere now. I found it hard to choose as nothing much appealed so I went for the chicken Milanese which was awful. Dry overcooked chicken banged up on a bed of lettuce and potato cubes, I would have sent it back only we had guests and I didn‚Äôt want to start making a fuss, but it  was basically inedible ! My husband had the curry and he said it was passable. None of these main courses were cheap and it was just so disappointing to be served this inferior and tasteless food with no imagination whatsoever. Such a pity as it‚Äôs a hotel I would like to have gone back to for all the other reasons except the food.",2,2024,05,06
223,Awesome Hotel,"We stayed here for three night at the end of April. This hotel is amazing, the menus are outstanding and cater for all tastes, Breakfast was very relaxed with a massive selection to chose from. 
The rooms are spacious, clean and well equipped. 
The staff at the hotel really made the stay special for us, nothing is too much trouble for them.  ",5,2024,04,30
223,Beautiful grounds and wonderful staff.,"

Really lovely stay for a family birthday celebration. The rooms were gorgeous and reservation staff were so helpful in helping to organise the various rooms we needed.
We found the staff very attentive and the wonderful spaces allowed for ample time to relax and unwind. We were a party ranging in age from 9 months - 70 and everyone loved their stay. We will certainly be back.",5,2024,04,29
223,Birthday treat,"I was treated to a night away here for a birthday celebration.  From arriving to checking out I cannot fault the place. Our stay was a truly relaxing and most enjoyable experience.  The room was lovely and very well equipped. We enjoyed a cocktail and dinner in our package and they were top notch! We had drinks after dinner in the foyer area as there was music and it was a lovely night. Our wonderful server Jose upon realising it was my birthday treated me to a complementary drink! He, like all the staff we encountered were very helpful and friendly while working on a very busy Saturday! They are a credit to the hotel. Looking forward to a return stay.",5,2024,04,29

223,A lovely stay,"I stayed at the Castleknock Hotel after arriving late at Dublin Airport from a business trip. The staff were very friendly and helpful, the room was lovely, with a nice view of the golf course. I particularly liked the Elemis products in the room, Netflix on TV, bathrobes and most of all the DYSON hairdryer in the room. The bed is incredibly comfortable, and the sheets beautifully soft and spotless. Breakfast was lovely. Only recommendation for improvement would be poached eggs made to order, they don't do well sitting in cold water. Were cold and hard. Just a small improvement. Also like that the parking was complimentary. Didn't make it to the pool but looks great. Thank you for a lovely stay. ",5,2024,04,29

Truly enhanced by excellent, friendly and efficient staff who go out of their way to be helpful and make your stay super enjoyable. The food is great and the cocktails are even better! Highly recommend.",5,2024,04,22
223,Excellent Hotel,"The hotel is beautifully positioned in a suburban/rural setting nestled between the affluent neighbourhood of Castleknock and the Strawberry Beds along the northern shore of the River Liffey before it enters the City if Dublin.

We stayed for 5 nights (Wednesday to Sunday) which allowed us to experience two sides to the hotel. 

During the week it was busy with business men and women, conferences, and locals popping in for a coffee or visit to the Spa.

At the weekend there is an influx of families which is not a surprise considering the amenities and child friendly facilities, entertainment, and service.

Weekends are much busier and due to the high number of children more noisy in the public areas but staff continue to maintain a friendly smile and are extremely attentive to everyone.

The only negative we experienced here (and not for the first time) is a lack of hygiene and presentation in the pool and dressing rooms which need more attention.",5,2024,04,15
223,Amazing was great value,"Absolutely amazing looked after us like royalty nothing was troubled room was lovely and comfortable 
Food was amazing the earth and vine restaurant the best food I think I have ever eaten staff polite and helpful

223,Decent stay,"Pros

- very friendly and helpful staff
- drinks of good quality and reasonably priced
- coffee bar excellent
- bed comfortable

Cons
- food just ok (could be fresher and warmer)
- a lot of screaming children in the lobby and in the corridors at all hours of day and night (not what is expected when the hotel promotes couples' escapes or at this price point)
- pool facilities could be improved (pool temperarure cold and changing rooms cramped)",4,2024,04,05
223,Excellent short stay venue,"Excellent short stay venue - free parking, friendly and attentive staff who go the extra yard (metre?!). Spacious lobby area with coffee and snack options.

223,I expected more,"The hotel itself has lovely rooms. However, the stay and dine menu was very average and the food a little disappointing at times. Sauna and steam room facilities inadequate for size of hotel. Quite crowded in Sauna. Some information giving by reception was confusing , nearly missed breakfast!",4,2024,03,31
223,Family break,"Great location for travelling around Dublin and surrounding area, we were a short drive from the zoo and emerald park. Staff were extremely helpful and amazing with our kids, pool was great for the little ones. ",5,2024,03,30
223,Relaxation to a tea,"Myself and my mother went for the¬† ""relaxation to a tea"" day spa package, from the moment we walked into the hotel to the moment we left everything was absolutely perfect. The afternoon tea in earth and vine was delicious and the staff were lovely however the highlight of our day was without a doubt the amazing treatments we had in the spa. We both agreed that they were some of the best treatments we have ever had. My therapist was Victoria and she was an absolute professional, her manner was lovely, she is so good at her job, the Castleknock spa are lucky to have her. My mother said the same of her therapist who I think may have been called Carmella but I am not 100% sure. I look forward to returning for another treatment and an overnight stay next time. Thank you to the staff at the spa for their wonderful treatments and professionalism.",5,2024,03,26

223,Disappointed Anniversary Occasion,"Stayed had a meal this evening. Bedroom table cracked and burn marks.
Inclusive meal area in Bar22 equivalent to a an airport departure lounge. Hectic, noisey and chaotic. Not a location for a romantic meal. Very disappointed as we were celebrating a 30th wedding anniversary. Expensive and definitely not value for money.",1,2024,03,23
223,Thanks to Lydia!,Stopped by for a bite to eat and was delighted by the fantastic service by the team especially by Lydia who really looked after us in the terrace. Both the food and drinks were delivered in timely manner and Lydia ensured we were constantly looked after throughout our evening. Will definitely be back.,5,2024,03,23

223,Good spot to stop near the airport,"Great airport style hotel to stop at that's good if you're looking to stay just outside of the city. The facilities were good. Nothing super fancy, but overall they did a good job. I really enjoyed the live entertainment in the evening and it was great that the gym was there on site and had such great hours. The staff were great and the parking was super easy on site which I appreciated ",4,2024,03,19
223,Outstanding hotel,"From arrival to departure staff, hotel, food, drinks and pool were out of this worlds. Staff couldn‚Äôt do enough, left Prosecco and chocolate strawberries in our room for our engagement. Met the full Scotland rugby squad too added bonus. Cannot wait to return",5,2024,03,19
223,Beautiful hotel,Great rooms and amenities. Could tighten a few screws on the beds. Executive suites need to fit the part considering how much the cost. The bed in my room ANNOYED ME with CONSTANT squeaking. EVERYTHING else was amazing. ,4,2024,03,18

223,Sort your pool etiquette out,Kids free to dive do what they want impossible to enjoy a swim which was the main reason to book this hotel . Also no kids should be allowed in the fine dining restaurant as a child was screaming the whole place down and people trying to eat ,3,2024,03,16
223,Perfect stay,The hotel is perfect and the staff are very hard working making your stay rememberable. The food is amazing and the service is excellent. Spa facilities are good and the pool wasn‚Äôt overcrowded thus giving you plenty of space to enjoy a swim,5,2024,03,16

223,Poor spa experience,"I went for a spa treatment here today. I used the leisure centre beforehand. I was very disappointed that there was no changing facilities in the spa area and they were shared with the leisure centre. The leisure centre was packed and there was an aqua aerobics class on at the time which meant I could not use the pool at all and the music was very loud which meant it was not a relaxing experience that I had hoped for. 
During my treatment the therapist was trying to have a conversation with me which I thought was very inconsiderate as I came there to relax (I am a very social person but I don‚Äôt think while I‚Äôm having a back massage was the right time). Unfortunately it was not the pleasant experience that I was expecting. I will not be back.",2,2024,03,08
223,"Good Hotel, be wary of location","A nice hotel, but the traffic makes it completely impractical for commuting to Dublin centre. The staff were mixed, some were outstanding, some disinterested and poor.  That said, the facilities are great.",4,2024,03,08
223,Working Visit,"A very enjoyable stay that made my business trip that much more enjoyable.

Service was great, all staff are so friendly & attentive.",5,2024,03,06

223,Review,My partner and I had a great weekend here. It was so accommodating. We took a taxi from the hotel into Blanchardstown and a taxi back. There was music on in the foyer and it was extremely cosy. It‚Äôs a place I would recommend to everyone. ,5,2024,03,04

223,Lovely one night stay,"Stayed over on a Friday night with my sister.  Found the staff to be really friendly and helpful, our bedroom was nice and spacious. Dinner was lovely, had vegan option.  I would add that the portion size was fairly substantial for both my starter and main course, but could not fault any of it, just could not eat it all :).  Used the pool which was very enjoyable, as was sauna etc. Was sorry we only had 1 night stay, but will be back with my hustand and we will book 2 nights",5,2024,02,26
223,Pity the visit was let down by one interaction with one staff member,"We decided to head here as a meeting point for a coffee and catch up following the arrival of our friends baby. 7 adults one child and the baby. We were struggling to find a suitable spot to sit and I 35 weeks pregnant said I would ask a staff member if they knew if a table would be free or becoming free soon. The person said to give a few minutes she‚Äôd make a call and see if a table which was reserved was needed . She told us we could go ahead and sit there and she removed the reserved sign for which we were grateful and thrilled. 

We ordered our cakes and coffees and they were brought down by another member of staff who had a face like thunder , as she placed the first lot of coffees and cake down she said this table is reserved , I replied and explained we asked another member of staff and were told we could sit here. She was abrupt and rude and said who , described the fellow staff member and then she returned with a fake smile with the rest of the stuff we ordered ! She didn‚Äôt apologise for the way she approached us the time precious , much to my surprise. Perhaps might be a good idea to do a refresher on customer service and how it‚Äôs not what you say but the tone in which you say it that can make the world of difference when it comes to dealing with the public 

Everyone else was lovely and the facilities are very nice , warm and cosy",4,2024,02,25
223,Great bargains!,"Food delicious, staff very nice and friendly. Fatih, one the managers was very helpful and professional when a problem arose. Good value too! Pool was great also. It was a birthday celebration, so there were balloons and prosecco in the room waiting for us. Overall, a very nice experience.",5,2024,02,23
223,Perfect as always,"Can't recommend this hotel highly enough. The staff are exceptional, they are friendly and welcoming with a professional attitude toward their clients.The rooms are spotless and spacious. Both the bar food and Earth and Vine restaurant had a great variety on the menus and all the food including breakfast was gorgeous. Overall can't fault our stay and will be back.",5,2024,02,21
223,Nice hotel and staff,"Very nice stay, we booked a special offer for couples (included dinner, wine and breakfast), was handy as close to home so there in no time.  Staff are very friendly, food was good, hotel is absolutely roasting hot so make sure to book a room with AC.  Pool is nice, very busy (swimming lessons etc. going on), also small kids allowed in the jacuzzi which i've never seen anywhere!
We had booked 30 minute spa treatments as that's all the space that was available but it really wasn't worth the cost by the time they bring you into the treatment room to settle, do it and finish a few minutes early it was about 20-23 minutes of an actual treatment and cost ‚Ç¨132 for us both which is pretty steep. 
All in all, would probably do a night again as close to home and a nice break.",4,2024,02,20
223,Below expectations,"Leisure facilities really let the hotel down. The steam room was our of order, the sauna tiny and cramped. The Spa changing is shared with small gym and pool changing rooms - really takes away from the Spa experience.
The room cleaning is on request. Room keys continually failed and had to be reset at least daily.",2,2024,02,19
223,Family stay,"Overall stay was fantastic, hotel is perfect but way overpriced as are all hotels, the hotel was very warm also especially in the restaurants, quite sickening hot, that and price are the negative but overall great stay ",4,2024,02,19
223,Evening meal for our family to celebrate wedding anniversary,"We have a lovely meal this evening the Earth and Vine Restaurant to celebrate our 6th Wedding anniversary. Great food and lovely staff - the steak, pork and monkfish were yum. Our waiter, chris, gave us great advice on our choices and made us feel very welcome. Well done all.",5,2024,02,18
223,Breakfast is fab!,"Lovely hotel great for families, amazing breakfast and the staff are all really friendly. 
Daughter was delighted with the Dyson hairdryer in the room!!!
Bed was comfy, room was lovely and warm. We had a fab stay and would visit 2/3 times a year.
The summer time is brilliant as our kids can play outside at the playground and we can sit and have food and drinks on the terrace.
Oh and I had prob the best flat white I‚Äôve had for a while!!",5,2024,02,18
223,Gym managed very badly,"The health club is consistently neglected as the last few times if been something has been out of order. One time the sauna and steam room were out of action completely. Mostly its just the steam room that doesn't work. This is a shame because this is very important to me as a non drinker.
The changing rooms are always filthy and the floors are soaking wet.
There is no soap in the showers.
The staff are reluctant to give you a towel.
The water cooler has been broken in the sauna area which is a huge health hazard coming out of the sauna and being unable to get water anywhere.
The doors in the shower area are broken.
There are always kids lessons in the pool which are not shown on the timetable meaning that I have been unable to use the pool at all the last 5-6 times.
The gym area is a disgrace and will genuinely make me question returning as the gym area is always a highlight for me in a hotel at this price range.",1,2024,02,18
223,Feb midterm,"Stayed in 5 star hotels in Leinster recently. This is better! Will definitely be back. 
Only issue was the pillows were not to my liking (my wife had no issues). 
Food was excellent as were the staff. Kids loved the pool. ",5,2024,02,17
223,Great hotel and restaurant,"We stayed here for a one night break, having previously stayed. We ate in the Earth and Vine Restaurant and we're served by the amazing Emma.

223,Fantastic,"A fabulous family night away, great service and friendly staff in all areas of the hotel.

223,Nice,"Nice clean hotel. Food was also nice. All staff were pleasant however one bar staff member was inexperienced and was unable to make a proper mojito. Had to send it back on two separate occasions. Bar service was slow. Restaurant forgot our side order of mass so literally had. Braised steak in gravy. 
Despite all this hotel was lovely and clean. No air on in room and it was bit stuffy at night but opened window. Spa and leisure Centre was lovely.",4,2024,02,06

223,"The long awaited stay,","Upon arrival it was a very efficient check in, even though we arrived early. Room was super impressive. The facilities were also amazing. Would stay again. 
My only con would be that I didn‚Äôt have a great sleep because the bed was a little too hard and far too big. Only a small con though!
5 stars otherwise!
See you again soon.",5,2024,02,03

223,Perfect Confirmation Meal,"We had a confirmation meal in the casual dining area recently (very early confirmation). We were a large group of family all ages including 2 babies. The staff couldn't have been nicer and more accommodating when we arrived with 2 more people then planned. The orders were all taken efficiently and the food was really good, fresh and well put together. Its always tricky when you are the host of a group like this everyone has different tastes but everyone at the table was very happy with their starters and mains in particular the two who ordered the chicken burger, it was just the right size, not too fussy with the garnishes and very tasty. Not all of us had dessert but the Eton Mess style dessert looked as good as it tasted. We felt comfortable considering the large party, we weren't rushed by the staff and took our time to chat and enjoy it. The hotel itself was lovely, spotless and spacious and when we went to find a place for some nice photos we were spoiled for choice. I would definitely recommend it.",5,2024,01,30
223,"Nice hotel, good staff and I love their leisure areas","We had a bit of a hiccup with the room but it was corrected very fast and we had a very pleasant time, they gave us a better room fast enough, replace all necessary things included in our package and the staff was fast and friendly. Their leisure areas, pool, jacuzzy are very nice and relaxing unfortunately on Friday they seem to give swimming lessons to children there so part of the afternoon was full of their class but not to bad, would be nice to know in advance when those classes are so one can avoid them to have a more relaxing experience. ",5,2024,01,29
223,Top Notch,"Dinner was fantastic, Chicken Supreme and a Beef Special were both so tasty.

First off, I was greeted by a lovely lady Elein at the reception.¬† She spoke with a smile and her styled¬†colored hair provided a glowing start.¬† She patiently listened and helped jump-start the wonderful experience I had.¬† I have to emphasize the customer care provided was exemplary and something I have not experienced in my years of traveling and accommodations.

Being disabled and wheelchaired, it was difficult for me to move and get to my destined room initially reserved.¬† With the circumstance of no rooms on the bottom floor and the initial room provided being far, getting to the room was difficult as it was caret on the floors and within the room.¬† I requested the manager to help me with the situation.¬† Sibi Daniel, the manager on duty was amazing!¬† His empathy towards my situation was second to none! He identified the difficulties I may face without having me explain anything.¬† He told me he had no rooms on the bottom floor, therefore he helped me to my room and assisted me with all my immediate needs!¬† He stated the bottom floor would be available the following morning and told me he would keep it vacant for me.¬† The following morning, without any persistence from my side, he came to my room and assisted me to room 002 on the bottom floor!¬† Beyond this, I had scarcely mentioned my date and time of check out to Mr. Sibi Daniel, and to my astonishment, on the day of check out at 7:30 AM, he was at my door ready to assist me with my bags and getting it to my taxi.

I have to again state I have not experienced this type of service in all these years!¬† With my personality, I am not a person who likes to make others' life difficult and during this stay, I felt like I did not have to ask for anything as this manager and receptionist knew exactly what I needed and worked as a team to¬†execute all¬†my needs.¬† It was almost like they were reading my mind.

I thought it would¬†be wrong for me not to emphasize this experience to Castleknock!¬† Would love to stay here again next time around and would not blink an eye for anyone inquiring for recommendations for accommodations in Dublin!¬† Once again, Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to the Castleknock family!

223,Charged a number of different prices for the one beer by different staff.,I regularly visit the bar in the Castleknock hotel as I did on the evening of the 18th jan. I never had any issues with the service or the food. This particular evening I was amazed to be charged a number of different amounts for the same brand of drink. No issue with the money but something very concerning for a business to do. It basically left me with a feeling of contempt by the staff. Both the male and female behind the bar were charging different amounts for the same drink. Makes one wonder is the till being used for pricing of drinks.,2,2024,01,18
223,Best stay in a long time!,I stayed here for one night with my husband and was amazed by the service and quality of food plus attention to detail. A staff member Dylan from events was very helpful when I was clearly struggling with my bags and the overall service of all other staff members was very relaxing. I 100 percent recommend and will be back soon,5,2024,01,16
223,Mediocre,"Just back from a night away in the Castleknock Hotel. I had booked an executive room as a treat, but wish I hadn't as it didn't seem any different to any other room and was certainly no bigger.
The bed was average in terms of comfort but the pillows were flat and lifeless. These things should be spotted by housekeeping especially in a 4 star hotel. I was too tired to try to arrange replacement pillows when I eventually did get to bed but I did inform a member of staff the next morning. 
The staff that we dealt with were excellent and they are a credit to the hotel.
Looking at location and how much the rooms are, there's better value to be had elsewhere. ",3,2024,01,16
223,Lovely Hotel,Great Hotel and very friendly staff. Away from the City with nice view on the Golf Club.  Nice swimming pool and gym. Rooms very quiet and clean. Dinner and Breakfast delicious. Good offer for romantic weekend. Highly recommended!!!!,5,2024,01,16

223,Steer clear,"Food was absolute horrific. It was my third time there in 5 weeks , and yes after the first two times you could say I should have learned. A 70th , and my god worst meal of my life. Steer clear, 6 of us all had worst food of our lives. The waiter serving us I‚Äôve never came across anyone as rude.",1,2024,01,05
223,Amazing experience ,"Absolutely first class 5 star and more 
You have to have the seafood platter ‚Ä¶.. we are from Australia although born in  England and my partner is Irish.  We live in Australia close to the Great Barrier Reef, with an abundance of seafood‚Ä¶.. wow the salmon, fresh prawns and the crab here is out of this world .
Also a big shout out to Killian our waiter, although young has an attitude to detail and service, is an enormous asset to the hotel and also Andrew the manager cannot speak highly enough for the service we received.
I have worked in hospitality for many years in Australia and I have to say service here has surpassed my exceptions.
Castlenock Hotel, memorable.

223,Amazing hotel,"Our stay was exceptional, Especially Andrew, the restaurant manager demonstrates exceptional leadership, creating my birthday dining experience that seamlessly blends efficiency and warmth for me and my girlfriend, I couldn‚Äôt recommend this hotel enough to anybody",5,2024,01,04
223,"Nice hotel, Food is terrible. ","I live close by and use the leisure facilities a good bit. The hotel is pretty nice overall, especially out the back on the terrace in summer. The gym/pool is ok, not 5* or anything but it is ok. Staff in the leisure area are excellent. There has been a lot of cost cutting in the leisure centre, and prices have increased quite a bit, a recipe for future disaster but they say both were ""essential"". They will come down in the future as the gym in particular is not very modern compared with others locally that run Zwift/peloton classes etc...They only provide towels to guests of the hotel, they dont provide them to hotel members, which is pretty galling, and a real commercial mistake. it essentially places one time purchasers over recurrent buyers, certainly a CFO overriding a COO in the decision.

NUMBER 1 issue with the hotel, THE FOOD. Its awful, I mean truly awful. Breakfast is below a deli counter standard. its a buffet, but if you have stayed at a Premier Inn in the UK etc... youll have had better quality. Ive had business meetings there and had to apologise to guests as the food was so bad.
Lunches are ok, sandwiches etc... generally are fine and salads are also pretty decent (If a little different, Caesar salad chicken is served cold for eg)
Dinner is abysmal. We went with a group of friends recently and every single one of us thought the food was bordering inedible. Youll regularly have different ingredients to the menu on the plate, or something different to what you ordered (A curry with Pita bread, posing as Naan bread for eg) or a dish made in such a way that it just seems odd, as though it wasnt prepared by a chef. The pizzas seem to be of the frozen variety which is really disappointing when they cost the same as a lovely one in Base etc... in Castleknock village. 

Overall, its a nice hotel. If the food was back at 2018 standard (Which wasnt world beating but was nice) and the leisure centre the same I think it would be a good choice for any occasion or to be a member of. At present, and since COVID, it seems to be high price, average quality in many areas which doesnt tally with a 4* rating. If you take the golf (1*) and the Spa (1*) this hotel is 2*+ or maybe 3*. Its particularly nice for a drink in summer on the terrace but the food has been so bad there for so many years now most of us local folk wouldnt recommend it for a meal, there are alternatives nearby that are similarly priced, but far better quality and value.

223,Small room over a wedding.  Tiny bed.,Checked in at 1:30 to make a 2pm wedding nearby. Told that only room available was a single room above a wedding event. When I saw the room I was surprised to see it was a single bed. I‚Äôd expected that a single room was one room with a small double bed. It was like staying in a closet. No staff follow up after providing and acknowledging a room that was far from comfortable especially based on the pricing: ‚Ç¨311. ,2,2024,01,03
223,Return Stay left us disappointed,We had stayed in this hotel several times before. Although pricey we felt it was worth it due to the high standards. Both the restaurant & the room standards had slipped on this occasion and the stay unfortunately was not good value this time round. We may not be returning again. ,3,2024,01,02

223,Love this hotel,"We love this hotel. We stay every Christmas and the staff go out of their way to make sure your stay is the best it can be. The food is gorgeous and we have done spa days which have been so relaxing. All of the staff in the coffee shop are lovely, as is Derek on the door and Andrew in the restaurant and the lovely manager lady who wears glasses, on reception. I don‚Äôt know her name. But she is from Dublin. I wouldn‚Äôt stay anywhere else in Dublin",5,2023,12,22
223,A work escape with an old friend,I had purchased the a package which came with dinner and breakfast included. Food at dinner was terrible. Didn't finish the main that I had and my guest was not impressed with his main either. Waiter forgot to bring water to the table. We had chicken wings for starters which was the highlight. No pen provided to fill out the breakfast order which was late the following morning. I left feeling quite hard done by given the total for just the night was a couple of hundred. There needs to be a clear breakdown of what makes a 4 star a 4 star however this certainly is not it. Castleknock hotel has a really nice lobby which is perfect for a cuppa with a friend. Great spa facilities to boot. The hotel has more potential and greatness than what I experienced and I would not stay again.,3,2023,12,19
223,"Excellent, hightly recommend - thank you Jose!","Party of 10 staff stayed here last week for our Christmas party.  I could not fault the hotel or staff at all.

All of the amenities in the room where good quality and plenty of toiletries in the bathroom (Elemis). The food was great (especially for a corporate event) Breakfast the next morning was lovely, large selection to choose from, something to suit everyone.  We had a great time and are planning to return.  Huge shout out to our waiter for the night, Jose,  he was amazing.  He was friendly, entertaining, never stopped smiling - never got a drink order wrong (huge achievement with our lot who were forever changing their orders!)

Jose was looking after our drinks for the night and his service was spectacular, he really went above and beyond for us!
The entertainment was also fantastic and the hotel was decorated beautifully for Christmas.
The rooms were very, very nice,  so comfortable and had everything you could need or want for an overnight stay (including a mini fridge, elemis minis and dyson hairdryers!)

Highly recommended for families who want a stay outside of the city but close to the zoo, liffey valley or blanchardstown shopping. There is a great leisure centre and pool and a very safe small playground too. We loved our stay and would use the hotel again.

223,Disappointing,"Overall a poor experience. Family Room cost ‚Ç¨375 for the night but no hot water for showers and the bed was like sleeping on a concrete slab. Breakfast was below average.

Spa was clean and well maintained. Breakfast over two mornings was excellent and whilst the hotel was busy, we had no issues with the food quality. Enjoyed listening to the live music on the Friday evening. We were visiting Dublin, so the only downside is the proximity and cost of a taxi.

No security guard was present in the hotel. Only women working there were trying to stop them but nothing changed. We couldn‚Äôt sleep at all despite the comfort of the room and the bed.
It is a shame that a 4 star hotel still bears this kind of behaviour.

223,Disappointed ,"We arrived at a pleasant looking place. Checking in was easy, however when getting to our deluxe double room we were exceptionally disappointed.
Not only did we have two single beds rather than the double as you would expect, we were also dissatisfied with the overall condition and quality of the room. 
For a 4*, it seemed to me lower than a 3*.
The breakfast was cold, although plentiful and had the cheapness way about it.
Fatty cuts of bacon, low quality sausages and you had to ask for what you wanted rather than being allowed to help yourself in the regular way, as is at a self-service buffet. This, I believe was another way to cut costs, emphasising another cost cutting cheap way of making money. We shall definitely not be returning again.",2,2023,10,23

223,Wonderful Wedding Day in Castleknock Hotel,"We recently got married and held our wedding reception in Castleknock Hotel which was was nothing short of exceptional.
From the initial stages of planning with Leone to the time we left after the wedding the service we received was impeccable.
Leone and Ana were great to deal with in the planning meetings and along the way with any queries that arose. Leone had every detail covered and we felt like we knew her for years! Even allowing us to have Alpacas at the reception which we believe was a first for Castleknock!
On the day everything went like clockwork, every member of staff we met with were so friendly and helpful, the room looked fantastic, the atmosphere was unreal and the food was amazing and enjoyed by everyone. There is nothing we could fault.
We would have to give the hotel 5 stars for such a brilliant experience we had in Castleknock Hotel - thanks to everyone involved especially Leone, Ana, Guy, Andrew, Gavin, Ileana and Rachel to name but a few. Absolute magic - thanks so much.

Only problem we noticed was the spa changing rooms and bathrooms were quite unkept when we used the pool, otherwise it was a nice stay",3,2023,09,27
223,Wonderful staff and service,"Castleknock Hotel was the hotel of choice for a nearby work function. My spouse accompanied me as we extended the work trip for our first trip to Ireland. The hotel itself was fantastic. Food and drink choices were plentiful and delicious.  Included daily breakfast.  Bar and restaurant was also great. Facilities were top notch. Pool, hot tub, sauna, steam room.  Not to mention the onsite spa. What stood out the most was the genuine friendliness and helpfulness of the staff. They all really made us feel special. They suggested activities and helped us figure out how to do them. We didn't use the golf course but it was beautiful. The one possible negative was the proximity to other activities. Not much else going on nearby. Bus stop was 10 minute walk and train was 20. Taxis were quick but gets expensive. Overall, a wonderful hotel and an experience I'll always remember. ",5,2023,09,27
223,I expected a 4 star experience for our anniversary!!,"Unfriendly staff in this hotel that didn‚Äôt greet us when at reception checking in. The cleaners were the only friendly staff. We stayed for our anniversary and it was between here and Radisson blu St Helens. I honestly wish I would have spent less money on Radisson blu than the amount I spent for this deluxe room. We had only one pair of slippers for the pool, we went down to the pool at 9.45 and there were so many kids everywhere messing about so we didn‚Äôt even go in. We went for breakfast and had just finished our cereal so went for the hot food and when I went back to my table, it turns out the staff had cleared my stuff off it and gave it to another couple. Therefore we had to find a new table. The staff member apologised only just and gave us a new table. We had to ask for coffee as no one had any notion of asking us did we want tea or coffee. The breakfast was not great at all anyway as it was dried up cold food. The bed was comfy and the shower was good but the air con also didn‚Äôt work which made for a restless sleep.Very very bad service for a 4 star hotel and a room that we paid almost ‚Ç¨300 for. We will not be back and won‚Äôt be recommending to anyone. ",2,2023,09,26
223,Best hotel ever,"Amazing hotel, delicious food.
Very good SPA. I really recomed

The beds were wonderful. Dinner was delicious and the staff were very friendly despite being very busy. There was a wedding and a class reunion the evening we stayed. Highly recommend. ,5,2023,09,22
223,Birthday deal,Travelled two hours to stay and avail of the one night birthday deal including Prosecco/balloon/cake and three course evening meal. Early check in was facilitated. Leisure facilities were used. This was busy with kids but still very relaxing. Food was 10/10 and service 11/10 - birthday dessert board was brought as a surprise without even requesting. Room very comfortable. Check out effortless.,4,2023,09,21
223,Anniversary stay,"We stayed for our wedding anniversary it was lovely staff all lovely and the door man always there to open the door for you x just a little thing but while having dinner we were left waiting about 45 min for our main course but as soon as the staff seen they sorted it out straight away

The hotel management can be very proud of its service minded staff.  All the staff I encountered were welcoming and professional.The breakfast tasted great and the choice was very good. I also enjoyed dining in the hotel, something I usually tend not to do when I am staying in a hotel. Again excellent staff!
It is a little out of town, but then again the hotel is situated in a very peaceful location.
Bottom line, would I stay here again and recommend Castleknock to my friends and family? Absolutely!",5,2023,09,17
223,Beautiful Hotel,"Would highly recommend Castleknock Hotel to anyone wanting the best there is on offer.
Absolute pleasure to be there, great staff and facilities. We even met some of our Irish National Team players who were in Dublin for an International match. That was a lovely bonus, after an excellent one-night stay.",5,2023,09,12
223,over night stay,"The bedroom was very warm we opened the windows but had to close them because of the

223,Friendly staff,"The staff are super friendly. Ileana who works at the restaurant was super helpful and attentive, she explained all the details of the menu, and checked if I needed anything else, delicious aftertoon tea.

Thanks

223,Another wonderful stay,"This was my second time to stay in CKH and once again your staff were amazing. Everyone we met was friendly and had a smile. Despite being busy on the night we were looked after so well in bar 22 for dinner. The room facilities were incredibly impressive for a girls trip, wine, coffee, magazine, nice toiletries, robes and a Dyson hairdryer. I also loved the coffee station where I grabbed a takeaway coffee for the road. Myself and my friend do a catch up break regularly and have both agreed to return again. I‚Äôll also return with my husband. Congratulations on a wonderful team!",5,2023,09,11
223,Past experience brilliant this one horrible,"I've stayed and dined in Castleknock Hotel a few times with nothing but praise but how one stay can have so many faults 
We arrived at hotel and our room wasn't ready this was after 4pm we have young kids so this always problem
We settled into room and wanted use pool but children had to be out by 6pm obviously if we where checked in would have been able avail of it we got 15 mins 
We went down for dinner but our mistake we didn't prebook 
We had option of patio area which we took 
From start to finish there seemed to be nothing but communication problems because every part of our order had mistakes and then final nail was a hair in the madras which turned me off my food.  I spoke to management who compensated for this but I felt bad for having to point it out.
I left restaurant feeling disappointed  and hungry but after hours decided order room service 
Two sandwiches including tray charge ‚Ç¨25  to get wrong order again and this in pictures,  this is not cafe standard alone 4 star
Il let you be judge 
.",3,2023,09,10
223,Very nice hotel,"Great place to stay lots of amenities, very comfortable, good food, just be sure to note that it's outside of Dublin town centre. Otherwise recomment it entirely. Regret we only had one night there. Also very gluten-free friendly.",5,2023,09,09
223,Already planning our next stay!,"My boyfriend surprised me with a night away in the Castleknock hotel recently and safe to say it was 10/10. I had heard great reviews from friends and family and it definitely exceeded my expectations. The staff were absolutely lovely and so attentive. The pornstar martinis were arguably the best in Dublin and the steak was absolute bliss. The atmosphere was exactly what you want for a hotel break with live music in the lounge area. And did I mention there‚Äôs a Dyson hairdryer in the room?!! We‚Äôre already planning our next stay, dreaming of a spa day!",5,2023,09,08
223,Unfriendly staff,"Our stay was for 2 nights,  including dinner on 1 night & breakfast both mornings. The Netflix & chill hamper was also included. This hamper would feed about 5 people so beware if you've also dinner booked on this night!
The hotel itself was lovely, very clean & tidy. 
The staff on the other hand were not the best. 
Our waiter on the 1st night was helpful & friendly, explained that our stay included a 3 course meal which if we weren't hungry enough could have the next night, when we ate we went into the bar & ordered 1 cocktail & a beer, it took this over 1/2 an hr to come, only after we'd been up to ask where it was!  The lady who served us at this point seemed to be a manager, didn't get her name but she was lovely, blonde hair tied up, gave us our drinks complimentary.

Staff on day 2 however weren't helpful at all. We went down to the bar in the afternoon for a few drinks & snack, it took a long time for anyone to come over to serve us,  we were eventually served by olivier ( not at all friendly or helpful!!), it seemed to be a chore for him to bother!!
Much to our disappointment he was serving at night when we went for dinner. 
Again the wait was quite a while & when we eventually did get served my meal was wrong, when I said this olivier basically gave me the opinion that he thought I had lied about what I had ordered. 
In the end, after another wait my correct food was brought out,  wasn't the greatest & I just ate the chips. My partners meal by this point was pretty cold but we were so fed up waiting we just left & went back to our room. Don't think we'd return to the hotel. ",3,2023,09,06
223,Ok,"Food in 22 very bland and very overpriced
Leisure facilities were ok and everything worked but all feels a bit run down and in need of a revamp
Room was comfy and clean as was the hotel overall
Staff also very friendly
Not sure I would stay again based on food though

223,Excellent Hotel in a great Location,"Have stayed here often. My family love this hotel, particularly the pool and the breakfast buffet. The hotel is perfectly situated on the North side of Dublin so was an ideal base for our trip to Newgrange. ",5,2023,08,23
223,Weekend stay,"Hi 

We stayed at your hotel last night, availing of the deal switch off Sundays. 
We thought we were in the bar restaurant for lunch but found to be offered afternoon tea then a three course meal in the earth & vine restaurant. We were very disappointed and surprised that we had to pay an additional ‚Ç¨63.50 for the lunch which we thought was included in the stay advertised on your website for ‚Ç¨210 which was a lunch & breakfast. I understand we had to pay for drinks but thought the additional ‚Ç¨63.50 was a bit much when we thought the lunch was included, having to pay for sides was surprising to see. 

We also seen there was a check out at 1pm on this deal however we were not offered. We were very disappointed with our stay at your hotel. 

",2,2023,08,23
223,Superb hotel,"My mum and I are after returning home from our one night stay at the Castleknock hotel. From the second we entered the hotel, we were made to feel most welcome. The receptionist could not have been more helpful. 
We were given a room, that overlooked the lake and golf course. I can honestly say it is, by far, the most beautiful hotel room I have ever stayed in. The views were breathtaking especially watching the sunset over the golf course.
We had our evening meal in the bar area. It was so busy but all the staff were so helpful and attentive.
Because of the beautiful views from our room, we decided to have our breakfast in our room the following morning. The breakfast arrived at the time we requested it and was absolutely delicious.
This was our first time staying at the Castleknock hotel but it certainly won't be our last. ",5,2023,08,17
223,"Excellent service, great food.","The ambience is unequaled, family friendly, quality food-served fresh and hot, the service is excellent, and staff is very helpful and cheerful.

223,Fine location Old type breakfast,"To many PEOPLE at the same time, noisy kids running around in restaurant maybe its normal in Ireland ? Breakfast was not helthy it was difficult for me to find some i could eat. Great Rooms‚Ä¶ its too far away from Dublin",4,2023,08,16

Highly recommend ,5,2023,08,14
223,Disappointed,"No air-conditioning in the family rooms - these were extremely hot. 
Family rooms disappointing compared to what would be expected for this level of hotel.

Upgrades (e.g. bottles of juice) not as advertised with staff not helpful to resolve issues.

Extremely disappointed.
I would not recommend.",2,2023,08,14
223,Really lovely,"Hotel was great, bigger than we expected but a real quality hotel. The breakfast had everything you could wish for, and even great poached eggs! The staff stood out as being exceptionally trained and really gave it a 5 star feel.
The only downside was that the swimming pool area/facilities didn't live up to the rest of the hotel. And you need a swimming hat to go in the pool! They sell them for 3 EUR a go if you want to, but you dont need them for the jacuzzi, sauna or steam room.  ",5,2023,08,14
223,European Vacation,We felt that the lack of receptive people willing to help us was lacking.  We also were no happy that our room was not made up at all.   I did receive a great massage was the one saving grace.   You have to offer better food quality as well.    ,1,2023,08,14

223,Can‚Äôt wait to go back,"We are just home from a 4 night stay and yet again we have come home with a plan to return sooner rather than later. Our 2 girls ages 7 and 5 had the best time we have stayed in other hotels over the years and nothing compares to the Castleknock hotel. Every member of staff was kind and acknowledged the multiple hellos they got from our girls. We as a family always feel welcomed at the Castleknock hotel. The food, rooms, pool are all fantastic but for us the real gem about the Castleknock hotel is the staff. ",5,2023,08,11
223,One night stay ,Stayed in the Castleknock Hotel for one night prior to flying away for our summer holiday. Again couldn't fault the hotel. Was allocated interconnecting rooms on the ground floor. Very convenient to the swimming pool. As we were going to the airport early the following morning we ate in the restaurant. The food and service was again excellent. Special mention to Martin at front of house who booked as taxi and Li at breakfast who couldn't have done enough for us that morning. The hotel as usual was spotless ,5,2023,08,11

223,Lots of small touches that make a trip memorable,"Probably the best hotel I have stayed in yet. Lovely comfortable rooms. Breakfast had a good variety of choice. Both bar food and restaurant food were excellent. Plenty of staff which was great to see and they were all friendly and polite. I would definitely recommend this hotel for both couples and family‚Äôs breaks. I was only there with my Husband for a nice kid free break (which I got) but I could see plenty of families enjoying themselves and there was good facilities in the pool and around the hotel to suit children and I would definitely go back with my children sometime for a stay. Very good location not far from Dublin City centre. Dyson hair dryer in my room as well as an Dyson air purifier which was a very much appreciated touch and I loved that they shower provided shampoo conditioner and shower gel. They thought of all the small details that make a stay that more comfortable and enjoyable. All in all, a great stay and I would look forward to my next trip there. ",5,2023,08,06

Also a special mention to Ileana and the staff in the restaurant who were great with the kids. It was a hotel where we could roam and not like usual hospitality venues where people seemed to be annoyed by being in the presence of young children it felt normal to be walking around with them ant any time and that was what made it enjoyable for us!",5,2023,08,05
223,Amazing stay,"Beautiful hotel, staff are friendly helpful.

223,Nice hotel but preference to sports teams so smelly sneakers everywhere,"We were staying on a floor that was mostly booked out by a sports team and the sports shoes and other equipment in the corridor was not a pleasant experience. The hotel said they could only control the smell by spraying deodorant in the corridor, but not remove the sports equipment. The sports teams have preference in this hotel.",3,2023,07,30
223,Hallways lined in wet shoes. Extreme smell that entered the room,"For what is it worth, I have never written a bad review of a hotel before and wasn‚Äôt going to‚Ä¶ but the hotel‚Äôs own feedback system triggered TripAdvisor. We did attend afternoon tea and swam in the pool, both were lovely. The sleeping situation was not.

Hotel was hosting a sports team, which lined the hallways in wet shoes. The hallways and room stunk of wet shoes that the team didn‚Äôt want to leave in their room because it ‚Äúmade their rooms stink‚Äù. 

Day 1: first complaint to front desk. They said there was nothing they could do because it was ‚Äúhockey Ireland‚Äù 

Day 2: second complaint as the shoes went from a few pairs to an entire hallway full. Hotel once again said ‚Äúbut it‚Äôs hockey ireland, lots of guest are complaining, I know it isn‚Äôt okay and smells terrible ‚Äù and offered to switch rooms and a refund for the nights stay. 

Day 3:  check out, only a 50 euro credit was given. Shoes still lining hallway.",1,2023,07,30
223,Weekend Break for 2,Had a lovely 2 night break at the hotel sunday and monday nights as slightly cheaper.  Staff excellent and had paid a bit more for executive room.  Food very good and the ambience and foyer area was really lovely.  Drinks a bit more expensive than the normal but think Dublin is the same all round prices have gone mad in some places.  Spa was lovely and staff very good.  Whole place kept very clean and nothing was a bother to the staff.,5,2023,07,27
223,"Beautiful hotel, Helpful staff and kids friendly","Beautiful hotel, very helpful staff  as they let us check in one hour before and all the floor staff were very attentive.

We had an issue with our TV in the room and head of maintenance ""Phil"" came up and fixed it immediately , what a top guy! 

We had a table booked in the bar for dinner and the food was delicious with very generous portion sizes. The dining staff were extremely attentive too. I got the chicken wings to start and the burger for main. My wife got the tagliatelle and said it was the best she had ever had.

The bed was huge and pillows were so comfortable, we had a great night's sleep even with a wedding party going on. 

Breakfast in the morning was amazing! We opted for the cooked breakfast which was delicious, I also treated myself to some smoked salmon, and would have got some mini pancakes had I not been so stuffed! 

We really enjoyed our stay and will definitely book again.",5,2023,07,06
223,Lovely countryside stay,"Wonderful accommodations, with great spa and facilities. Service was on point. Staff always went above and beyond. I would highly recommend. Location is a bit out of town if you plan to stay and do most things in Dublin, but an easy cab ride. ",5,2023,07,05
223,Castleknock,"The hotel is at a very nice location and the venue really looks very nice. There is even a golf course next to the hotel. Rooms are standard, but clean and comfortable. We stayed for 4 nights and every single night there was a massive party (or 2 even) going on. Our room was right above the function room and the music was pounding until really late ... Understandable if you're one of the people attending the party, not so much for those in the hotel room. Hotel staff did try to get us into another room, but hotel was really full, no other options, only for the last night but as we had to leave really early it was too much of a hassle. However, another person of the front desk staff said: ""Well, this is Dublin in summer. We have parties here....!"". 

Mind you, I was not complaining, I merely asked politely if I could expect more parties in the days to come. I don't think that this is the way how you should be treating your guests, who also paid a massive amount of money to stay in your hotel. The prices are quite high, between ‚Ç¨250-300 per night in June.

If you want to book here, make sure you don't stay above the function room.

We are not coming back here. Too bad though.",2,2023,07,04
223,Best Hotel we have stayed in,"We decided to stay here, due to our honeymoon to Italy being cancelled as the passport office would not issue my son's passport. We decided on a nice hotel with great reviews. The reviews did not lie.

When we arrived, there was a wedding due, so the Red Carpet was rolled out. We were walking around it and the concierge came out, greeted us with a smile, opened the door and said it was ok to walk on the carpet. We were early but they allowed us to check in early and the concierge, took our bags to the room. 

Food, pints and wine was lovely. Special shout out to the chicken wings. They were great!!! 

Room was spotless with an amazing view over looking the garden and adjoining golf course. TV equiped with Netflix and wifi, which was ideal for us to stream YouTube kids for our son. Playpark is a great addition to have in any hotel and my son loved running round this.

Kids swim is at 10 but the manager allowed us 45 minutes early as long as we didnt interupt the other guest swimming, thought this was a nice touch.

Staff are excellent. The concierge Michael is brilliant.

Location of hotel is slightly out of the city but there is a bus stop less than 10 minute walk from the hotel and Michael is able to tell you everything to get to the city and back. 

Loved this hotel and hopefully we will get back. By far the best hotel we have stayed in ",5,2023,07,03
223,Our Wedding at the Castleknock Hotel,"We had our wedding at the Castleknock Hotel on 01/07/2023 and it was perfect.

The hotel is set in a very green open area and is well maintained and it‚Äôs staff were very friendly and smiling -  always a plus for any hotel. The standard room was spacious and we appreciated having a bath as well as a walk in shower. Furthermore, the room was well stocked with coffee & tea making facilities including a Nespresso coffee making machine. Ideally you need a car to travel into central Dublin, however, we made do without and instead used the number 37 bus which takes about 50 minutes and runs every 20 minutes.  Travel by this method is very cheap particularly if you purchase a visitors Leap card.  We found the breakfast to be of good quality with a wide selection. The only niggle we had is that our room was close to some outside generators or something that sounded like it and this meant at night we had to close the window to shut out the noise. ",5,2023,05,11

223,Wedding at Castleknock Hotel,"We had to find a new venue for our wedding at short notice and we feel very lucky that the Castleknock Hotel was available. Leone, our wedding coordinator, is a credit to the hotel and couldn't have been more helpful and approachable in the short weeks between booking and the day of the wedding. A very professional experience and nothing was too much for the staff to help accommodate everything that we wanted and more. All of our guests commented on how great the venue is and how friendly all of the staff throughout the day were. Couldn't recommend this venue more to other couples, especially that their packages are all inclusive which took the stress out of the planning!",5,2023,05,10

Room was ok with a comfortable bed, nice bathroom, big TV screen, tea/coffee tray, ironing equipment. The windows were old style and there was a huge fan outside which I could hear all night.
Breakfast was good, yet nothing special. I took a short walk around the garden. Should be nice in summer. Could see myself spend a lovely holiday weekend there but would definitely ask for a less noisy room.",4,2023,05,02
223,Fabulous hotel,"This is a fabulous hotel starting with the fact that they have walk in showers. The food was excellent. The atmosphere is very lively.

223,Fabulous hotel,"Where do I start...I brought my partner away on Saturday 15th April as he recently celebrated a very special birthday. I chose Castleknock hotel as its a very special hotel for us both. I got a package which included 2 treatments in the spa, 3 course dinner and b&b. From the minute we arrived to check in we were greeted by the friendliest of staff. I had emailed before I arrived to explain it was a special¬†occasion and the lovely Roisin told me she would leave a token in the room to mark the occasion. The balloon, card and chocolates were such a lovely touch and I was so grateful. When we arrived at the spa we were met by more lovely staff. Myself and my partner had our treatments together and had the amazing Jennifer and Charlotte,¬† the nicest ladies ever who made us feel so relaxed. At dinner, every single member of staff were just so kind, who greeted us with smiles and kindness.

223,Great family stay young family ,We just checked out Today after a overnight in cadtleknock. It was a positive relaxed experience which is a lot to say when you have 3 children with you . The staff are amazing friendly and attentive. Food is good for the volume of people they are catering for . The family room I must say was smaller then most but it was fine . My 5 stars really is for the staff and the processes castleknock have implemented so things can run well . We will be back ,5,2023,04,16
223,"Great hotel, attentive staff","Overall hotel was excellent with the room being very well equipped, comfortable and quiet. Blackout curtains worked a treat! The attention to cleanliness was great to see especially in such a large hotel. 

Cannot fault the reception staff who were welcoming, helpful and professional. Special recognition to Martyna on reception and Marina in restaurant. 

We dined at restaurants on 2 occasions and staff were attentive and food delivered promptly. Breakfast had a good selection to start the day well. 

Even managed a workout at the well equipped gym‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt use pool so can‚Äôt comment.

My only concern / observation is related to the size of the lobby and restaurants which meant it was tricky at times to have a meal in peace due to the high number of families with young ones. Of course they also deserve a good break and facilities here are great for all. It just felt that if there were designated areas which allowed people to relax without lots of activity and noise it would have been a perfect break.",4,2023,04,14
223,"Lovely Hotel, Friendly staff,  room a bit small",I am sure other rooms are lovely.  We wanted extra room as my husband uses a small scooter to get around.  The bathroom was extra big but our room was quite cramped.  Would have been better with a smaller bed,4,2023,04,14

223,A Spa Hotel Gem in Dublin 15,"Just returned from a 2 night stay at Castleknock Hotel. It was our first time here and we booked the 2 nights bed and breakfast with a 3 course meal package. 

Everything about our stay was incredible. Firstly the staff are amazing at what they do, all well trained and so helpful - shout out to Raul in the patio area and illiana in the earth and vine restaurant for their quality service -(hopefully I have the names right)

The breakfast was top quality, loads of options and well run. We did go down early each morning to beat the rush.

The highlight for us was the food in the new restaurant Earth and Vine. We paid 40 euro to upgrade to here on our package and I would really recommend everyone doing this. Pictures below but the service, taste and value for money was 10/10. Probably the best french martini we have had too.

The pool, sauna and steamroom were always easy to access and use as a guest. You will need a swimming hat and 1 euro for the lockers as an fyi.

Thanks again to the staff and we will 100% return in the future.",5,2023,04,12
223,Clientele were an issue -no control,"The clientele in the hotel were an issue. No control kids running wild, brought in chinese and ate in looby.  Very good for kids and loads to do and extract activities for Easter. Wouldn't go on bank hol",4,2023,04,12

Really fresh and clean and staff interaction was fab.
Kids loved it too!",5,2023,04,10
223,Family Stay,"Great location. Friendly staff. Food OK!! One portion of rice arrived very hard and dried out, had to request a fresh portion. Rooms were lovely but bed was very uncomfortable and Pillows were lumpy. Pool area was good and locker rooms were clean. ",5,2023,04,09
223,Subpar. ,"Only positives of this hotel are the cleanliness of the room and nice pool area. Alas, 4 star hotel it is not. We booked our stay for our first wedding anniversary. We upgraded our dinner from the bar to restaurant for 40 euros. The dinner was hectic to say the least. There's clearly not enough staff on, and the staff that is on are very young and clearly not trained well, I honestly feel sorry for them. We never got the bread plate on arrival (defeats the purpose of upgrading for restaurant dinner), plates were snatched the second you put fork down one moment -the next you find yourself sitting with empty plates for 20 minutes. At one point the waiter brought our mains and the plates from sorbet were still on the table. He had to literally ask another waiter to clear it . No soup spoon for the broth. Couldn't ask for one because I couldn't find any waiter around. At the end,had to ask for bill twice from two different staff members. Overall we waited 30 minutes for the bill. Honestly it just seemed that the staff were just more attentive to bigger groups. We left to get a drink in the residents bar, hoping our night will improve.  The very first order they mix up our drinks . Also, 6.50 for a pint of Guiness is extortionate.  About 11 at night rolls in,and by this stage I'm hungry (mind you after having 3 course meal at 9 o clock ,just to show you how small portions are), I ring to get a room service sandwich (thats all you can get) and of course they don't have any ciabatta ,even though it's on the menu.i end up having tuna sandwich which is 2 slices of white bread slapped together.  This comes to a whopping 15 euros. Most expensive sandwich of my life. The breakfast I hope again, improves. For a 4 star hotel not to have a table service is scandalous. Ladies and gentlemen-you need to queue for your hot breakfast! My husband decides to get a latte,which apparently is at extra cost. A whopping 4 euro for a latte out of a machine.I go get some porridge instead and its like cardboard. I begrudgingly decide to queue for hot breakfast. Its alright.im full and decide to head up to the room. Of course the breakfast manager notices I don't eat too much and runs after me to see if everything is OK. This is the first time someone is actually interested in my experience as a paying guest. I have a chat with the lovely lady Lee, and she's a gem of a woman and manager and the only reason why this review is not 1 star.  We check out and of course,the receptionist doesn't  even bother asking how our stay was. For the amount of money you pay, the service is below subpar. I don't think I've ever been more dissatisfied with a hotel.",2,2023,04,08
223,Romantic break,"We just had a one night stay prior to a flight to the sun, We found the staff very helpful in the restaurant and again at breakfast but Andrew deserves special mention in the restaurant, any request was dealt with, this man knows his stuff and a great member of the team, Also the icing on the cake was to meet some of the Irish team, our Hero Seamie Coleman and former LOI manger now Ireland manager Stephen Kenny prior to the big game against France.",5,2023,04,08
223,Excellent experience ,"Really lovely Afternoon Tea in the beautiful and warm conservatory. The food was amazing (great selection of sweet & savoury) and the staff couldn't do enough for us. I can't recommend enough!

223,Great Stay and meal,"My wife and I booked a overnight B&B with an evening meal included in the Castleknock hotel. We have stayed there previously and have never been disappointed. 
We were able to check in online meaning that when we arrived all i had to do was pick up our key, very streamlined.
We were informed that we had been upgraded to a suite, which was a very unexpected but very welcome surprise.
Our room was really lovely and so quiet that night.
We had our meal in the Bar22 and the food was really excellent. The young man waiting our table was also very helpful and friendly.
Breakfast the following morning was just as good with so many friendly helpful staff on helping with anything you need and a wide variety of food and drink on offer.
All in all very positive pleasant stay.
Would highly recommend it to anyone.",5,2023,04,04

223,Excellent stay,"My husband and I had an amazing stay at this hotel. We stayed for 4 nights over St. Patrick's weekend to celebrate a birthday.
The hotel was clean and all staff friendly and helpful at all times.
The bar and restaurant well stocked and excellent service.",5,2023,04,02
223,Fabulous Spa !,"I had the most fabulous full body massage and facial today by Janet. Thank you so much x
Thd Spa also gets the thumbs up for being able to provide larger size robes. It makes the experience so much more pleasant. 
The lunch included in the deal was, however, on the skimpy side....tasty, but very little of it!

",5,2023,04,01
223,Delightful evening meal and meal at the newly extended Earth & Vine restaurant at the Castleknock Hotel! ,"Just enjoyed a wonderful evening at Earth & Vine restaurant in the Castleknock Hotel. We had a superb meal in the newly opened  extended area in the restaurant. This is a beautiful space, bright, spacious and beautifully lit  with wonderful views of the grounds. On this wettest of wet evenings the gentle sound of the rain on the roof was like a lovely water feature. The food was delicious and the service was excellent, attentive and friendly yet not intrusive. We really enjoyed our evening!  Well done to the management and all the waiting staff. We will be back! 
 ",5,2023,03,31

223,Very Poor for Weddings,"The hotel offered a very poor and unprofessional wedding for a relatives wedding. It was shocking how badly they managed the day and messed up on simple things. For example, not setting the table properly for the bridal party and making them stand while they set the top table. The poor food, service and overall poor experience must be because they are lacking professional and experienced staff. Book elsewhere for your wedding.",1,2023,03,29
223,Celebrated our anniversary in style,"Stayed for a 4 night break to celebrate our wedding anniversary, use as a base for exploring Dublin and for catching up with family we haven't seen since the pandemic. Top notch place with great food, facilities and staff. The only wee thing I would be aware of if staying here is that there isn't much within a stroll. Even the local train station - Coolmine, is a short taxi journey away (you can walk it if you fancy humping your cases along). Otherwise a thoroughly enjoyable stay. The nearby Angler's Rest restaurant is also worth a visit.",5,2023,03,29
223,Great place to stay,We had a 2 night stay here last week for a special occasion and booked a suite with a beautiful lake view. Food and service excellent and one minor hitch was resolved with great efficiency and courtesy by the staff on duty at the time. We did not sample the Gym or Spa but the pool and steam room were most enjoyable. We would stay again.,4,2023,03,27
223,It's No Nicer Than A Travel Lodge!,"We chose The Castleknock Hotel as we wanted something a bit special as this was a one off special occasion trip to Ireland.  In our opinion the hotel leaves a lot to be desired, especially when you consider the cost, just short of 800 EUR for a 3 night bed and breakfast stay, and that was their 'special' rate.

The hotel is reminiscent of  a slightly improved Travel Lodge.  It's very cold and unwelcoming, extremely corporate, colossal and nothing like what was advertised on their website.  

On arrival, check in was good and efficient.  Our room was clean but considering we upgraded to their Deluxe room we expected more.  The 'tropical rain shower' was a dribble, more of a 'Dublin drizzle shower', the bathroom toiletries were all in pump dispensers attached to the wall which pumped the tiniest amount each pump and were frankly just annoying.  There were no shampoo and conditioner dispensers near the bath so after a bath, to wash your hair you had no choice but to get in the shower afterwards. 

The Super King bed was uncomfortable, just two singles pushed together, even the duvet was two zipped together, may as well have booked a twin as you couldn't lie in the middle of the bed. 

The pool and spa was packed, full of kids, walked in, walked out again, looked like the local public baths on a Sunday morning, hardly relaxing.   

We ordered room service, the food was cold.  The cod was a joke. you could literally pick the thing up like a cold rock hard bat, pizza was also cold, at just short of 50EUR including an 8 EUR delivery charge it was dire .  We were so hungry after a long journey we couldn't be bothered to send it back considering it took so long to arrive in the first place.

They have a 'pillow menu' in the room but didn't have the pillows we asked for so what was the point?

Breakfast was dire.  One morning our server was coughing all over the milk and coffee he brought out so we left it.  The bacon tasted like it had been cooked in very old cooking fat, the poached eggs had clearly been poaching for a few hours.  Having said that, the sausages were nice and there was a good choice of fruit and pastries.  We found the staff at breakfast to be quite grumpy though the lady on the door was nice and welcoming.  

Staff don't smile and say morning to you unless you say it first, they seemed to keep their heads down.  

We had lunch in the conservatory part on one of the days which was the best meal we had there and service was good.  

The hotel is in a good location for getting in to Dublin, we took the bus which is a 5 minute walk to the stop, it was nice being able to have a great view from top deck all the way in to the city. 

So to sum up, had we paid travel lodge type prices we would have been happier but this hotel charges high rates for a travel lodge type stay.  ",2,2023,03,27
223,Bravo,A very busy hotel full of energy. Great rooms and facilities. Nice area around the grounds for walking. Good choice of food. Staff very attentive. Rooms cleaned to perfection. Ample carpark. Great pool and gym. ,5,2023,03,25
223,Very nice hotel & even nicer staff,"We came over from Delft-Holland to experians St. Patricksday and we chose this hotel just outside the centre so we can relaxe and enjoy ourselves when we are at the hotel with nice rooms, beautifull spa facilaties, great foodbuffet & cocktailbar; we komen op zeker nog een keer terug (we'll be back)",5,2023,03,21
223,Won‚Äôt be back,"My family came here for weekend with our 2 children, room is ok 2 double beds not suitable for a 12 yr old girl and 9 ye old boy but had to make do, food good, but when we sat in bar for a few drinks I had my vape on table and a very rude waitress came over and told me you can‚Äôt vape anywhere inside this hotel also she said we are serving food here, I know they were not serving food in the lounge because we asked for food and were told we would have to eat In restaurant it was tea, coffee and buns, I said to her there is no food been served here she walked away and shouted back at me that the people behind me where eating when I looked they had a coffee and a bun, she was so rude then she proceeded to inform all the other staff that I was smoking in the hotel because everywhere I went they were all watching me, it was a joke, my vape has absolutely no smoke come out of it and I have never been told not to use it and especially not in that way, we have stayed here loads of times but this will be our last, I will never stay here again, I can‚Äôt wait to get out of here tomorrow morning definitely won‚Äôt be back. ",2,2023,03,18
223,"High end, large comfortable but nosey rooms","High quality hotel, large Comfortable rooms with Dyson hairdryers!! Nice area, great staff.

Long way out of town but 15mins walk to the station or service bus outside the gates",4,2023,03,18
223,Initial negative experience turned around,"We checked out of another hotel due to a very poor experience and checked in here. I had a problem with my room initially and Damien Murphy the duty manager personally dealt with it and was amazing, he came up to my room and changed it and helped me with my bags. A true gent! We enjoyed a beautiful meal in Earth and Vine, had a great sleep and went to the pool, jacuzzi and sauna the next day. A relaxing morning before checking out. Damien was so receptive to the initial feedback and we are very grateful for how the situation was dealt with. ",5,2023,03,15
223,Overnight Stay,"Hotel is lovely.

We wouldn't hesitate to return.",4,2023,03,12
223,Wonderful wee get away with kids ,"Stayed on 4th for 2 days with my family (2 kids)

Hotel was spotless in every aspect , public areas and our bedroom with kids was super 
Highly recommend Castleknock for that wee break away from reality and unwinding. 
This hotel catered for corporate clients as well as family leisure guest and a nice mix of both there and everyone seemed to be enjoying- I saw  staff joking and slagging what appeared to regular guests that where on return visit to hotel showing the friendships of staff with regular guests . Just so nice to see. ",5,2023,03,12

Stay away",1,2023,03,01
223,Brilliant base to explore Dublin and surrounding area,"The hotel is an easy bus trip into the city and although it takes c.50mins each way, it allows you to take in a lot of the city whilst keeping warm and is way cheaper than parking. We hired a car and got out to Glendalough (1.5ths away, 1hr using toll) Hill of Tara (40mins) and Howth on the coast (45mins or on the way back to the airport 20mins). The pool was a good size and the rooms very comfortable. ",5,2023,02,27

The Sauna is a little snug, whereas the pool is of a good size with great areas to suit all, the jacuzzi is also a little small, but is very warm and great to relax in. The hotel restaurants are of the highest quality and the food served is great too. All staff were friendly and attentive to any requirements had during my stay.

In particular I would like to mention Martin, who was on the front door. He was extremely helpful and friendly in providing information about the hotel and the surrounding area. A really nice guy. 

My only negative comment would be that whilst the food was OK, I did find the cooking quality to be fairly average. However, there are lots of small restaurants around so you could eat out.

Overall I would give this hotel 5 stars for its ranking as a 4 star hotel.",5,2023,02,11

They really made the birthday a celebration. Maria made some delicious cocktails in the bar, that we could have kept drinking all night. Highly recommend your hotel and can't wait to return in the future.",5,2023,02,04
223,Fantastic  stay,"The best hotel ever, staff amazingso helpful everywhere in hotel amazing service could not ask for a nicer place and we'll worth the money, food was amazing  and spa treatment  out of this world, Suzanne was amazing  at facial highly recommended ",5,2023,02,04

223,Superb service in Castleknock Hotel,"My wife and I dropped up to Castleknock Hotel for a drink last night. The ambience and general atmosphere was so pleasant we stayed for 2!!
We were looked after by Jennifer who was super. She checked in on us regularly without being pushy and looked after us superbly. We'll certainly be back",5,2023,02,03
223,Fantastic,Everything was amazing. Drink food and staff great experience overall. Definitely will be back. Pool and gym recommended. With the size of the hotel you could expect it to be a bit untidy but from start to finish everything was spotless.,5,2023,02,02
223,Great time!!,We had a 50th birthday party in their Castle Suite.  The food was really good and the service was great.  Daniel the night manager went above and beyond to make our event wonderful.  Thank you for a wonderful evening.,4,2023,02,02
223,Stay,"Relaxing environment, lovely friendly staff. The food was really good. Room was spacious and really nice. The pool area is small but lovely. I Will definitely be back. Such a great location and close to the city ",5,2023,01,25
223,Great experience | Efficient staff,"Had a lovely stay at the Castleknock Hotel. It was very busy but that didn't impact the service, particularly Jennifer in the hotel lobby, who took great care of myself and my family. She was very helpful and efficient at taking and delivering our drinks order. Would definitely recommend a stay.",5,2023,01,24
223,Great stay,Castleknock Hotel comes highly recommended and although the hotel was super busy the staff were courteous and attentive which was nice. The rooms are spacious and although the hotel is a little dated the surroundings are lovely. A bit far from the City Centre but still lovely,5,2023,01,24
223,Paul Whelan,Earth & Vine Restaurant is overpriced and overrated. Our starters and desserts were obviously pre made in bulk and refrigerated at a very low temperature. Do not order the Ham Hock Terrine starter or the Raspberry Cheesecake dessert unless you like eating Hockey Pucks !!,3,2023,01,23
223,A good 4 star hotel.,"Stayed in single occupancy double room. The room was warm and comfortable and more importantly the bed and pillows were very comfortable. My biggest bug bearer was the low level of lighting.  while there were 4 lamps in the room, they all had maximum 40w bulbs - there was no way to be able to read a book in this room.  The tea/coffee facilities were very good with complimentary biscuits and bottled water.
Staff very friendly and helpful.  Bathroom had shower as well as bath and thankfully a magnifying mirror. An oversight in many hotels. The restaurant meal was particularly good but the bar food was a little hit and miss, though we can't fault the fish platter for sharing for lunch.",4,2023,01,22
223,Girlie catch up,"Lovely time here, great value. Food was great, staff were efficient and helpful.  Our stay and experience was brilliant. Only regret is not having time to try pool and sauna. Would definitely stay at this hotel again",5,2023,01,21
223,Great Family Trip to Dublin,Our 3 night trip to Dublin was memorable due in no small part to the Wonderful staff of Castleknock Hotel. The amazing staff went above and beyond to make our trip memorable. They were excellent with our 2year old son.,5,2023,01,17
223,No sleep,"Mattress was very hard no cushioning at all, room staff has to put two single duvets on my side which helped but didn‚Äôt alleviate the problem, breakfast had no flavour what so ever & did not think it was value for money . I have stayed in an executive room in Galway & it was absolutely wonderful & would run back to that Hotel tomorrow ",2,2023,01,17
223,Lovely hotel. Can‚Äôt wait to return,"A clean family friendly hotel. Hard working, pleasant staff. Large foyer to chill in and access to pool after check out time was a real bonus. Situated beside Castleknock village with few nice restaurants, great location to Phoenix park and a short drive away from city centre. A lot cheaper than city centre hotel prices. ",5,2023,01,17
223,Hannah and kians stay,Hotel is of a really high quality the staff members are very helpful and accommodating. The food and cocktails where excellent and the facilities are all of a really high standard. Hopefully will be back soon ,4,2023,01,17
223,Break away,"Very suitable for families with small children, no restrictions or alcohol rules apply at night children in bar area all night like a cr√®che. Leisure centre very good ! Room service very poor ! Location excellent! ",3,2023,01,17
223,Lovely Hotel let down by the attitude of staff at reception,"Beautiful and big hotel. Lots going on in the reception area and bar area. 

However it seems strange that the restaurant can‚Äôt be booked while checking in. The receptionist said we would have to do it ourselves. Upon phoning from the room reception redirected our call to the restaurant. Puzzling!!

We were told that the earliest we could eat was 9.30pm as we hadn‚Äôt previously booked. Later we got a call saying that we could have a table at 8pm. In the restaurant there were plenty of empty tables. Another puzzle!!

Maybe these incidences were an anomaly to usual the hotel behaviour. Maybe customer service attitude could be improved with some staff.",3,2023,01,16
223,Very disappointing lunch.,"Myself and my wife dropped in here for lunch on a Friday. The food was disappointingly poor. 
To start we shared Chicken Wings with hot sauce and blue cheese. Chicken wings were not crispy and  ‚Ç¨13.50 for eight wings seemed poor value.
For mains we had the Beef Burger and Beer Battered Fish  and Chips. 
The batter on the fish was soggy and the accompanying Mint Pea puree and Tartare sauce both looked congealed on top, like they'd been lying on the plate for a long time. 
The Beef Burger patty did not look or taste like it had been prepared fresh - it appeared and tasted like a supermarket compressed  frozen burger and was quite dry.
The fries were good and waiting staff were very good - no complaints there.
The bill for this three items came to ‚Ç¨54, a lot for the standard of food presented.
We won't be returning,  which is a pity as we are local and the location is nice.",2,2023,01,16
223,Fabulous stay,"Everything about this stay is 5*
Hotel is immaculately clean and modern. 
Staff are very friendly and efficient. 
Food is absolutely delicious with a very wide variety of options on all menus. 
Couldn‚Äôt have asked for any more options on the breakfast menu. ",5,2023,01,16
223,Great hotel for families,Had an overnight stay with two adults and two kids and it was ideal for our needs. The pool and restaurants were wonderful and staff were very friendly and helpful. Family room with three beds was ideal.,5,2023,01,16
223,Always a friendly reception.,"I stay here weekly for work and every week the staff show the same warmness and friendliness as my first. The hotel is very well presented, in a great location and there has never been an issue. There is no noise from corridors or neighbouring rooms so a good night's sleep in a very comfortable and clean room is always had. The pool and leisure facilities are also always clean and very relaxing.",5,2023,01,14
223,Family stay,"Great hotel... would 100% recommend to anyone wanting a family friendly hotel and very clean and comfortable.

The staff were excellent and nothing was too much.. 
Really appreciate all the help we received from Elaine on reception during our staff..
Forever grateful ",5,2023,01,12
223,Elegance ,"This hotel has a beautiful location and very large breakfast. It also  had tons of amenities, and a very friendly staff.  I also enjoyed the location right outside of Dublin out of the hustle and bustle. I would definitely stay again if ever in Ireland.",5,2023,01,10
223,Just great,Great stay and amazing staff. Absolutely recommend it !dinner was great and service at the restaurant and bar was excellent. Beautiful view and place is spotless . Very accessible by bus or car with access to the car park. ,5,2023,01,10

223,Afternoon tea and spa treatment,"My friends organised a spa treatment and afternoon tea for my upcoming arrival üë∂üçº For the spa treatment we had a neck, shoulder and head massage, as well as a facial. It was so relaxing!! Thanks Isobel! All the staff were so welcoming and lovely from the moment we arrived. We spent a good bit of time in the relaxation room after our treatment, where there was a selection of delicious yoghurts, tea and water. 

We had the afternoon tea in the Earth and Vine restaurant and it was absolutely divine! Eoin looked after us so well. He was so accommodating, polite, and couldn‚Äôt do enough for us! Thank you Eoin for making our afternoon tea experience so enjoyable!  

We enjoyed the day and the experience so much I am inquiring about having our babies Christening here!",5,2023,01,10
223,Perfect for a girls overnight getaway,"I stayed in Castleknock hotel for one night in a triple room with 2 friends. We loved it! We got a brilliant package for a 3 course dinner, prosecco, chocolate covered strawberries, a triple room and breakfast. We arrived after work on Friday and used the pool after checkout on Saturday. I would definitely return again for the same package. ",5,2023,01,09
223,Fantastic Hotel,Highly recommend. The hotel is such a fab hotel for families and couples etc. lovely environment to walk into.  Staff are extremely helpful and friendly. Rooms are fantastic. We will definitely return again.,5,2023,01,06
223,Happy family stay,My husband 2 kids and myself stayed here and have to say we enjoyed our stay the food was excellent and the staff we're  lovely to deal with . Breakfast was delicious and dinner in 22bar and restaurant  was excellent the waiter was such a pleasure dealing with ,5,2023,01,04
223,Exceptional hotel,"We stayed here for 3 nights over the new year, checked in 30th December and out on the 2nd January, from the moment we walked through the doors we just felt at home, the check in was fast and smooth and we were given plenty of information and advice, the rooms were spotless clean, nice and big and had sky sports on the TV, nespresso machine and separate shower and bath tub, the breakfast was quality compared to most hotels with a huge choice, we had a 4 course meal on new year's eve in earth and vine restaurant and again it was phenomenal food, the pool and leisure area was brilliant aswell, the entertainment on new year's eve was brilliant in the lobby with families and people of all ages just having great fun, they must have had every single member of staff working that night and I was observing them all and not once did any of them look like they didn't want to be there, all very courteous and smiling, the cleaning ladies each day were extremely polite and very helpful too, Castleknock may be a 4 star hotel but its definitely a 5 star experience, again the staff throughout the hotel were amazing the whole stay and we cant wait for another weekend break very soon but we will definitely be staying here next new year's eve it was just brilliant!!",5,2023,01,04
223,Amazing ,"Absolutely amazing experience, kids wouldnt stop talking about it. 

Checking in was fast, full info were given, room was so nice with the personal touch - kids pack. 

Breakfast was great, great selection of food and very tasty. Great coffee served in the lobby and superb brownie! Definitely recommended and will be back soon.  ",5,2023,01,03
223,Home from Home ,"I have stayed at the Castleknock hotel five times this year when visiting my family in Dublin. It‚Äôs such a cosy hotel and feels like home from home for me. The rooms are spacious, the staff are super friendly and the atmosphere downstairs is brilliant - it‚Äôs a great place to meet friends and family for lunch / dinner. All in all I highly recommend. Shout out to the restaurant manager Andrew who always looks after us and ensures my brother, who is a coeliac, feels comfortable eating there. Cheers!",5,2023,01,03
223,"Don‚Äôt hesitate, top class hotel.","Just back from a lovely break in castleknock hotel. My family with my wife and two sons decided to overnight for one night on New Year‚Äôs Day. Have to say the hotel was top notch. My kids really enjoyed the pool, as a person who works in that industry I was very impressed with the cleanliness of the pool and pool area. 

The staff are really pleasant and well trained. The supervisors run the show well and even younger staff members seem to be given good direction. The staff seem to like to work in the hotel. 

The rooms are clean and well set up. Check in and check out was easy. 

Overall this is a very nice hotel and a great location to get into Dublin quickly. Would be a good location if you needed an airport hotel also. 

Definitely stay here again.",5,2023,01,03
223,Excellent NYE Stay,"A wonderful hotel, great location and amazing service! Could not have found a better place to celebrate New Year's Eve! Staff were friendly and helpful. The food was fantastic! We will definitely be back! ",5,2023,01,03
223,Anniversary,"Very enjoyable stay over Christmas!
Highly recommend, Amazing facilities & entertainment, I will be doing it again in the Future. Many bars & bars to choose from & cater to your every Need. There is lovely walks around the ground.",5,2022,12,29
223,Castleknock Business stay,"Great hotel, shame the food & service in the restaurant wasn't up to the same standard as the rest of the hotel. I did complain to the restaurant manager who corrected the meal and took my feedback on board.  The main hotel & reception team were fantastic.",3,2022,12,28
223,Comfortable ,"Lovely, relaxing hotel on the outskirts of Dublin. Big and busy. Plenty of amenities and beside a golf course. The lobby area is lovely and comfortable with plenty of TV screens. We were served by Jennifer who was very diligent and friendly. Plenty of parking too.",4,2022,12,26
223,Average Stay,"When arriving at the hotel, we were greeted by very friendly staff which was lovely. The room, which was an executive room was less than exciting to walk into. For the price that was paid for two nights it wasn‚Äôt great. There was a constant smell of chlorine in the room due to its location, and the bed consisted of 2 single beds pushed together, even though we were expecting a queen. The only thing I enjoyed about the room was the Dyson hairdryer to be honest. Our stay included a chill out hamper, which we arranged to be dropped to our room at 7pm on our second night when we checked into the hotel. It got to 8 and we still hand received out hamper, and after calling reception we were told we never gave a time at check in, and they tried contacting me during the day, which that hadn‚Äôt. The meal in the 22 restaurant made up for this error as the staff were lovely and the service was very efficient. ",3,2022,12,25
223,First class experience,"Enjoyed my stay for the third time, love the look and feel of the hotel and its facilities. We enjoyed the short walk to a local pub / restaurant called the carpenters. Well worth a visit for friendly service and top quality food and drink.",5,2022,12,25
223,Lovely hotel ,"Very friendly & welcoming staff. The family suite was of excellent quality and very comfortable. The food in both the restaurant and for breakfast was excellent. The whole family had a great stay and couldn't fault the hotel in any way, we will definitely be back. ",5,2022,12,24
223,Wonderful Hotel,"We recently stayed @ Castleknock Hotel when on business, we were very pleasantly surprised as we drove up to the property, the hotel truly matched this.
I would not hesitate to stay when next in the area. 
Facilities were very good and the breakfast was plentiful. ",5,2022,12,22
223,Fantastic Christmas get together at the Earth & Vine Restaurant,"Had a fantastic experience at the Castleknock Earth & Vine restaurant. From start to finish it was great. Our server Antonio and the rest of the staff really know how to welcome you and their customer service was excellent. The food was lovely and each course was very prompt. We had the Christmas set menu at ‚Ç¨55 per person, it is such good value. To start, they bring out little bread rolls and different types of spreads, the rolls were still warm and were very tasty. The Amuse Bouche was a Watermelon Gazpacho. For starters we got the CELERIAC VELOUTE, ROSEMARY FOCACCIA CROUTE and SALAD OF CHARRED FIVE MILE TOWN GOATS CHEESE. Both dishes were delicious and were very well presented. The Veloute was so smooth.  Next came a sorbet, this was lovely way to clear your palette before the main. For the mains we got the PORK FILLET WITH BACON & CHESTNUT STUFFING, BUTTER BASTED HAKE and SEARED 8OZ FILLET OF IRISH BEEF. Everything was cooked to perfection and was very tasty. To end the night and in my opinion the best course, we got the CHOCOLATE & ORANGE PUDDING, I was expecting something very dense and heavy but it was a very light sponge and was delicious. 
What a way to finish.  They didn‚Äôt rush us and couldn‚Äôt do enough for you. 
Look at the pictures I have added, I think they say it all! We will definitely back again.",5,2022,12,19
223,Really enjoyable stay in comfort,"Loved my stay here. Great facilities and staff.  The breakfast was excellent.  Lovely atmosphere.
The pool area is good and not too busy. A good variety of areas in the lobby to enjoy.
Tea and coffee in the ro9m also with complimentary water",5,2022,12,18
223,Beautiful hotel & Excellent staff !!,"We stayed at the Castleknock hotel for a few days.  Hotel was amazing, extremely clean, food was lovely, but a special mention for the staff they where very pleasant , and helpful. Especially Daria & Ileana could not speak highly enough of them both. Would highly recommend.",5,2022,12,15
223,Fabulous hotel,From the time we arrived to the time we left we had a really fabulous stay. Service was efficient and friendly. Restaurant was excellent. Food was lovely. Atmosphere in the bar was great. Overall fab stay. ,5,2022,12,14
223,Pre-Christmas break,"We've had many stays here and it is always a top quality stay at a great price. Food, atmosphere, facilities, beds. We always have our car, so location is ideal for us. Might be a little trickier by public transport as away from the city centre. But it's so quiet for a Dublin hotel. 
Thanks Team!",5,2022,12,14
223,Menu variety limited,"The menu was so limited, that most of our party had only one real choice for starter, main & dessert. 
I have stayed previously at the hotel, & the menu choice was much more extensive.  
This would certainly put me off staying again.",3,2022,12,08
223,Our Wedding in Castleknock,"We had our wedding in the Castleknock Hotel on the 4/11/22 and I want to share the amazing experience we had with them.
From our first meeting with the team at a wedding showcase evening way back in 2019 to the last moment leaving after the wedding the staff have been absolutely incredible.
They made everything so easy and were amazing to deal with.
The wedding coordinator, Leone, is the nicest, most chilled out person you will ever meet and is amazing in her job, she made us feel so at ease and calm throughout the lead up to the day and especially on the day itself, nothing was too much trouble and she was always there when we needed her.
Another amazing person is Andy, the restaurant/bar manager. He is so good at what he does, and went out of his way, on more then one occasion, to make us feel very special, both before the wedding and on the day. He looked after all our family and guests so well and I couldn't speak highly enough of him.
On the big day itself, there is not one thing I would change about the hotel, food, experience.. everything was amazing. Our friends and family loved the hotel and the staff as much as us and raved about the staff and food the next day.
Every member of staff has the same great friendly happy welcome for you and they make the hotel experience.
I would 100% recommend the hotel to anyone looking for somewhere to have their wedding. You will not be disappointed and they deserve every award they have been given.",5,2022,12,08
223,Excellent Stay,"Fantastic hotel in Dublin for a reasonable price. Spa was wonderful with a great leisure centre, and our room was simply perfect, all staff members were very friendly and restaurant food was great too. We‚Äôll certainly return in the future  ",5,2022,12,05
223,Simon O‚ÄôShea visit,"The staff are amazing and went out of their way to make my stay as easy as possible when my 2yr old son who was visiting was early and could not swim which is why I booked the room and stay initially because of a cold. The amazing Ailbhe on the front desk & the duty manager Anca ensured I could check in early and even upgraded my room as mine wouldn‚Äôt be ready for his visit for the 4 hours I was allocated by his mother. 

All the staff are so friendly nothing is too much trouble and the food and facilities are absolutely fabulous. 

Thank you, thank you and again thank you I‚Äôll be back again!",5,2022,12,03
223,great stay,"best value for hotel and quality business stay and working in Dublin. excellent friendly and professional staff. good food at great value. very flexible approach and care by all staff. very ci=omfortable room and excellent workspace, wi-fi etc.",5,2022,12,03
223,Castleknock made my first trip to Dublin incredible!,"Such a friendly and helpful staff at Castleknock. From responsive communications prior to the trip, to their patience and kindness on site, the Castleknock staff, especially the ones at the front desk, truly made my first (and hopefully not last) trip to Dublin so smooth and memorable. Thank you, Castleknock staff!

The Irish breakfast each morning was such a delight (and perhaps a highlight of my stay at Castleknock!) Li D. especially made my experience so welcoming, by greeting me each morning, refilling my tea at just the perfect time, and even taking the time to answer my questions (as was my first trip to Dublin, and Ireland!) Thank you, Li!",5,2022,12,01
223,Large popular hotel,"Lovely hotel, beautiful room (we booked a suite) Staff all very happy & helpful. Restaurants were nice, good breakfast. 
Spa was nice, we enjoyed a lovely massage. However, if you want to use the pool, you have to wear a swimming hat! (No info on website about this.) This put us off so subsequently didn't use pool. 
Hotel was very busy & noisy at times. We were surprised at the amount of children/families that were either staying or visiting, particularly as we stayed Sun-Tues. At one point we thought we had coincided with a school holiday! 
The website suggests the hotel is more a 'couples getaway' but I wouldn't say that was the reality. 
We made the best of our stay but I'm not sure we would return. Having done the family getaway thing for years, we now prefer a quieter hotel. üòÅ 
",4,2022,12,01
223,Great spot in North Dublin,"There is so little to be negative about this hotel, it is pretty pointless saying it. Staff all very pleasant. Rooms very well kitted out and clean. Good food and served very quickly...even room service. Leisure  facilities good. Great place to stay",4,2022,11,30
223,Fab hotel,"Hotel was gorgeous really nice lobby area. Food was fab but we had the mc Allesse suite it wasn't a suite just a room with a fab four poster bed, no hot water in shower or arrival or departure and the stains on the carpet in our room were disgusting carpet needs to be ripped up,  staying in a suite we expected a lot more ",4,2022,11,30
223,Most appalling meal ever,"I was hungry with no food at home coming late for work so called into the Castleknock Hotel restaurant.

From a very poor menu I chose a beef burger.  It came out in a dark brown malt bun. Never saw that before. I sent it back and #2 came out in a white bun, drenched in cheese with a bit of lettuce, none of the other ingredients that were listed on the menu.  I didn‚Äôt think it a good idea to send that back so I asked could the caramelised onions etc to be brought out. A fridge cold tomato and slice of red onion arrived, The burger was absolutely disgusting. Thick, dense, overly salty. Yuck.  With a glass of wine and tip, an absolutely disgraceful ‚Ç¨33.  I most definitely won‚Äôt be back.  The very young waitress and waiter who took the uneaten food away didn‚Äôt ask was anything ok? When I pointed out that it was up there with the worst meal ever, she said she‚Äôd tell the chef. I wouldn‚Äôt hold my breath.  Appalling.",1,2022,11,29
223,Great Hotel,Very good hotel great food and very friendly staff. Very convenient for Dublin Port 30 minutes away and safe secure car park. Normally stay here with my wife and we make a great evening of it but a solo stay this time a very relaxing stay.,5,2022,11,28
223,Outstanding Stay Can't recommend enough,"The Castleknock hotel is truly amazing, I have stayed in many hotels and never have i had such an experience like this one, 

From the minute you come to the door you are pleasantly greeted and shown where to go for reception or afternoon tea or the spa etc its nice little touches like this that start your stay off right. 

We booked in for my girlfriends birthday we had afternoon tea which was absolutely outstanding and we also booked treatments in the SPA. The Spa is absolutely exceptional the team are all so lovely and I can't recommend Lauren as a therapist enough as she is brilliant at what her role and is a major credit to their team - The only negative was that the pool had been closed due to unforeseen circumstances so it was a bit disappointing after the spa to not be able to go for a swim after and really get full use of the facilities, 

Checking in was straight forward quick and easy, we we're given full details of everything in the hotel everything was explained in full and in clear detail, The rooms are perfect and cosy, beds were extremely cosy facilitated with a bath and a walk in shower in the bathroom, 

We booked dinner in the Earth and Vine Restaurant and had reserved a lovely table they made a fuss of us and made my GF's birthday extra special - we weren't to impressed with the level of choice on the Restaurant menu and they provided us with the bar menu to choose from instead, they also provided her with a happy birthday plate and a complimentary birthday brownie and a candle. 

The ambiance of the hotel is excellent as well although you are in Castleknock you feel like you are tucked away in the sleepy countryside.

There was live entertainment on the Friday night which we weren't aware of but the singer was brilliant and it really added to our night. 

All in all and absolutely fab stay and will 100% be returning again !!",5,2022,11,28
223,Couples anniversary trip,"Beautiful hotel but shame about how extremely noisy neighbours were dealt with that kept us awake literally all night. Reception also never answered the phone when trying to sort this out. 6 phone calls unanswered so I had to go down stairs at 3:30am to sort it. 

",3,2022,11,28
223,"Beautiful Environment, food spoilt our weekend, we went home hungry.. ","Room was absolutely perfect, the environs was perfect, unfortunately, our party of 10plus had the same opinion the the hotel was let down by the food.. Black coloured brioche is not appealing or sweet potato in a potato and leak soup and drizzling mint pea puree on top, it actually doesn't taste right. Wondering are these chefs tasting their own food, I wonder...!! ",3,2022,11,27
223,A disappointing experience,"While on a short trip to Dublin my husband and I stayed here for two nights last week.  Unfortunately, it was not really what we had expected.

On the positive side the staff were very friendly and kind.  As they were getting the hotel ready for Christmas, the decorations helped give it some atmosphere.

However, we found the room not very practical.  For example, the clothes rack was very high and would only suit tall people.  As I am only 1.55m I could not reach it and would have had a problem if I was staying on my own.  In the bathroom, when using the shower the water came out under the door.  Overall the room needed a complete makeover.  
As for the breakfast, it was not the best we have had in Irish hotels.  All the hot food was ready made and did not look appetizing.  With regards the location, it was more isolated than we had thought and taxis are needed.  

Our overall impression is that this hotel is more suited for confrences and company gatherings than for indivuals visiting Dublin. ",3,2022,11,26
223,"Beautiful hotel, questionable execution","Overall we enjoyed our stay here, it was just let down by some pretty easy fixes.

1) We twice waited over 20 minutes on the phone trying to get hold of reception 
2) They let you choose your preferred pillows from a menu of options (genuinely fantastic idea, 10/10), yet when we tried this service we waited an hour (see #1) to receive two cushions (yes, cushions) wrapped in pillowcases and an apology that ""this is all we have"". The second night we did order a ""medium firmness duck feather pillow"" and received what I can only describe as a concrete slab.
3) The hot tub was set to a temperature that I'm pretty sure is better suited to boiling potatoes than bathing guests.

That said, the food was very good, the rooms were of a high standard, and the place is beautiful.",3,2022,11,24
223,Castleknock wedding,"We had our wedding reception in Castleknock hotel in October this year and can't recommend them enough. From our first meeting with the hotels wedding planner, Louise, we knew we were in good hands. Louise left the hotel over the summer and we met with Leone who was the new wedding planner. Leone was the ultimate professional and made planning the wedding much easier. From popping in for coffee, to menu tasting and setting up everything it was no hassle to the staff. Nothing was too much trouble and on the day of the wedding both Leone and Alex kept everything running smoothly and we had the best day. We stayed 3 nights in total and I couldn't fault the hotel, their attention to detail and making sure we were looked after, the staff were always so helpful and kind even when busy and they made everything easy for us and our 2 young children. Thank you so much for making us feel so special. Photos by our brillant photographer Adam @wildfern",5,2022,11,22
223,Lovely Girls Weekend Away,"We were 6 girls from London visiting for the night for our friends 30th. Hotel is about 30 minutes from town so we spent a small fortune on taxis, but the hotel was worth it. We arrived and enjoyed a gorgeous afternoon tea in the restaurant (waiter was brilliant sorry can't remember your name!, then headed to the spa for one of the best massages I've ever had (thank you Charlotte). Martin the concierge was funny and very helpful with organising drinks/taxis etc. Room was nice and a good shower/bath. Reception staff kindly organised a last minute balloon, truffles and card for the room which was great. Would recommend for a nice weekend away in Dublin.",4,2022,11,22
223,Castleknock hotel,"660 for 2 nights without a meal was abit on the expensive side. The food was lovely, staff are very friendly. Martin was fantastic, always ready to have a chat while we waited for our taxis.hopefully the next time we come back it will be to celebrate our wedding ",5,2022,11,22
223,Stay at Castleknock Hotel,Overall stay was good. Only real downside was our room was over the area that deliveries were made meaning we were woken at midnight and 5am both nights. Staff were very friendly and breakfast was excellent as was the evening meal we had one of the nights,4,2022,11,21
223,Great service,We had a fantastic night in the lobby area with 5 star service from Jennifer who was very accommodating and made sure we were looked after with drinks and anything we needed. I would highly recommend Castleknock hotel..,5,2022,11,20
223,Superb,Great place to stay. Awesome staff and friendly. Great ambience. Nice food. Lots of parking. Safe place. Well organised and managed. Clean and tidy too. Will visit again if possible. Lots of facilities,5,2022,11,16
223,Pleasant stay but very overcrowded,"Overall, my stay was pretty pleasant but there were several aspects of the hotel that I found could be improved. The public areas of the hotel were full of people and the temperature was extremely hot. We were a group of 10 and we were all absolutely roasting the whole time. The staff were all very nice and friendly but very busy due to the volume of guests in the hotel. The bar, in particular, was very short staffed and run off their feet. 
Food was fine, very limited set menu for dinner, but breakfast was great.",3,2022,11,15
223,"Lovely Looking Hotel, Terrible Tasting Food","We had stayed for two nights. The hotel looks great and the staff were amazing, when we arrived we were checked in by a young woman in training on reception (didn't catch her name).
 The rooms are nice and were warm, although mattresses were a bit too firm for our liking. 
We found the breakfast to be pretty average, the sausages weren't great and the pudding were horrible, very slimy. Although there was plenty of variety so we knew what to avoid the next day.
For dinner we were served by Raul, he was amazing, he and the restaurant manager were very understanding with an issue we had during dinner. As for the actual food we found it to be very disappointing, my partner had a Cesar salad for starters which she enjoyed and I had the chicken wings which I found to be fairly standard if not a little acidic. As for the mains, my partner had ordered a pizza which tasted like it could have came from any chipper in the country. I had ordered the burger, the burger that arrived was dry and just smelt like boiled beef and made a Supermacs burger seem michelin star in comparison, the chunky chips accompanying the burger were fairly hit and miss with some very hard and uncooked. The orange and chocolate pudding and chocolate Blondie however were very tasty but dense and filling. Again Raul was exceptional in his service and made up for the disappointing food.
On the second night unfortunately we had extremely loud neighbors, the rooms really need to be sound proofed as we were woken up from 3-5:30 to them shouting, we could hear nearly everything they were saying clearly. My partner had rang reception at 4 in the morning to ask if someone could knock and ask these neighbors to quieten down a little. They continued until 5 without any change and I went down to reception to try talk to staff in person about the situation although no one was there at the time. Thankfully they either went to sleep at 5:30 or finally shut up. We had spoken to the manager upon check out and she was very understanding and receptive to these issue we had faced the night before.

Ultimately it was a disappointing visit and we don't feel like we will return again, the subpar food, mattresses and paper thin walls between rooms are too much of a turn off. Again I would like to reiterate that when the staff were present they were very helpful and friendly and we would like to thank Raul again for his exceptional service at dinner.

223,Lovely Hotel,"Beautiful Hotel, great atmosphere throughout, rooms are spotless and well fitted out, food in restaurant was ok, bit pricey for quality of meat,  however Jennifer in the lobby bar was so courteous and efficient, would definitely stay again üòä",4,2022,11,11
223,A large hotel with good facilities,"A good hotel, it is disappointing to find they only one EV charge point considering the size of the hotel and number of guests. 

The room was clean and the breakfast in the morning a well stocked buffet.",4,2022,11,09
223,Average,"Let‚Äôs start with the good points-
Hot water in room. Nice Elemis products throughout. Breakfast choice good. Room facilities good. Staff polite. 
Bad points -
No warm welcome
Food overrated and expensive. A burger and chips for ‚Ç¨18:50, presentation lacking, no garnish. 
Pool area changing facilities filthy, hair, towels and swim hats littering the floor. 
Door handle of room came off. 
Woken up at 6:30am by lorry unloading for over an hour. Not conducive with a good nights sleep and not expected when booking a four star hotel, no matter the price paid or the room provided. 
I wouldn‚Äôt return and I wouldn‚Äôt recommend. 
",3,2022,11,09
223,"Warm, inviting and cosy","Very nice hotel, the staff appeared happy and helpful.. The layout of the hotel was very inviting. The Interior was well designed, from the toilets to the lobby to the restaurant. Lighting plan was impressive and hotel was kept warm, cosy and clean",5,2022,11,08
223,Won't be returning,"Let me start by saying hotel is beautiful but from my experience the staff are extremely rude very under trained they all look miserable it's not what your guests wants to see when there away or attending a wedding.  Firstly the bar staff.. I was standing at the bar for 25 minutes there was 3 to 4 members of staff standing directly in front of me and not one of them asked me what would I like to order or even acknowledged me, NO MANNERS AT ALL.  I stayed for two nights with my wife ,the second morning my wife went down for the breakfast she was put far away from the rest of her family even though there was plenty of tables free she asked a member of staff could she please be moved beside her family she was then shouted at abruptly by a member of staff . Now if I had of been there ,there would have been trouble. how bloody dare anybody speak to my wife in such a way. As for the food for the price you pay for your meals its far from up to standard and every meal that myself my wife and all her family got was freezing cold DEFINITELY WONT RECOMMENDED  AND WOULD NOT STAY HERE AGAIN.",1,2022,11,07
223,Special occasions,We had a wonderful stay for our 30th anniversary we had a balloon card chocolates and a bottle of bubbles on arrival the food staff room fantastic highly recommended for that special occasion and it won‚Äôt break the bank affordable if you book a package with room breakfast and dinner included ,5,2022,11,02
223,Looks great but a massive disappointment!,"Hotel building is of an attractive and high quality finish. Staff are largely very friendly and the facilities in bedrooms make for great comfort (minus air con).

Hotel has a very average pool area. The swimming pool is dark/ poorly lit and the water is very cold. Changing rooms are cramped.

The hotel lacks a dedicated bar area with dining taking over most public areas. Very disappointed to book a table for an evening meal in the bar, to be seated by the doorway with a cold draft necessitating a new table to be requested. Upon request, the waiter told us to go out to the patio (which had zero atmosphere less ot be a smoking area) and come back if we couldn't find a table.

Breakfast was pleasant (coffee  very weak) but dinner was verg mediocre.. microwaved dishes served only 5 minutes after ordering is not what you would expect when trying to make an evening of it or when charged such hugh prices.

The hotel's bar and restuarant areas are far too small for the number of guests (busy weekend yes, an excuse no!) We could find a seat nowhere after 8pm.

Noise in the corridors throughout the night and in the early morninh was truly shocking! Whilst hard to police, something needs to be done about young families playing games outside your room at 7am).

For the price of the hotel, very disappointing! Looks great for sure.. but in no way a relaxing or luxurious stay! ",3,2022,11,01
223,Nice jorney to Dublin,"Lovely Hotel, very nice areas around the Hotel , all staff very friendly, the room was Clean and beautiful , breakfast was great and enough, the areas around the Hotel was very Clean and in the Hotel too",5,2022,11,01
223,Bad service,"Hano was refused at the bar at 1am on a bank holiday weekend just because it was a Sunday.

Elvis was also refused.

The band was also playing Irish Republican songs about the IRA in the lobby during family hours

They also played ra music in the lobby during family hours",1,2022,10,30

223,Business Trip - Conference,"I wasn't able to use the spa or golf facilities because I stayed at the hotel for business so I can't comment on those or the overall value of price to services.

223,Fabulous wedding,"We had our wedding ceremony and reception in Castleknock Hotel in October 2022. We had the best day, facilitated by the amazing Leone (wedding Co-ordinator), Gavin, Miro and the entire events team. We felt very looked after without being bothered once. The food, drinks and service were all top notch. We wanted to have a lot of gluten free options in the catering and this was dealt with perfectly. Everything ran so smoothly thanks to the team‚Äôs professionalism and coordination. Thank you again for our fabulous day!",5,2022,10,22
223,Stay at the castleknock,"Me and my partner stayed here on Sunday the 16th of October. We got a great deal, 3 course meal, B&B and Prosecco and chocolates to the room.

There was a beautiful girl serving us who‚Äôs name I didn‚Äôt manage to catch but she made the experience so nice. ",5,2022,10,19
223,the hotel was beautiful staff was so helpful,the only downfall of the hotel is the our bedroom wore freezing cold we had to sleep with dressing gowns on there was a terrible breeze in the room throughout the night and no heating other wise the hotel is beautiful ,3,2022,10,19

The food was very good and mostly local products.",5,2022,10,14
223,Short break,This was a short break using one of the hotels published packages. Service throughout was good.  We upgraded to an executive room which was very good. Our package included a reduced menu in the Bar 22 restaurant which was reasonable. TIP upgrade to the Earth & Vine restaurant at an additional ‚Ç¨20 per head which was outstanding. ,5,2022,10,14
223,Golf club had terrible customer service hotel was basically shut down for insurance company,"we booked to play golf and stay at the hotel on Friday the 30th September myself two brothers and my elderly father who is 85 years of age we where booked to tee off at 11;30am. there were torrential down pours all morning and still when we arrived, we requested if it would be possible to move the tee time as it was simply unplayable this was denied, we asked is it possible to wait and tee off at the 9th play the back nine and play the front 9 after as this would have allowed the weather to break again this was denied, tried to hire a golf cart as the rain was really coming down, none available. we were basically forced to go ahead and trudged through the rain with the greens waterlogged and bunkers with large puddles of surface water! eventually we had to give up as the rain was that heavy, we were soaked through our wet gear could not even lift our head to see with the driving rain and wind. again I remind you my father is 85 and we were really concerned he could end up ill so we had no choice other than to cut our game short.

we asked is there a possibility of a rain ticket or even a discount to play another day as this was a gift for my father, we were again told the course is open and payable I have photos over an hour after the weather eventually broke showing surface water in the bunker at the 9th hole.

there is no way my father should have had to play in them conditions we should have had to option of a refund or given the chance to play on another date and not forced to play in horrendous conditions with gale force winds basically payed to get soaked to the skin which completely spoiled our night away in the hotel for our dads birthday

the hotel was not too bad apart from the fact that there was an insurance company holding an event which meant that any guest not affiliated with the company  was refused entry into the hotel bar and restaurant which is completely absurd we were paying guest like the rest surely they should have been given another area of the hotel

223,Honeymoon Stay,"We booked Castleknock hotel for out Honeymoon trip to Ireland. It was far enough out of the Dublin city center, that I felt relaxed and had fresh air, but close enough that busing or taking a taxi into the city center was very easy! We had a lovely stay and enjoyed the hotel breakfast and other restaurants on site!",5,2022,10,06

223,Awful,"We had Sunday lunch in the 22 Bar and Restaurant in the hotel.  Being Sunday, it was very busy and very very noisy.  The servers were all smartly dressed and polite.
The food was another matter.  I had the 6oz steak sandwich.  It was inedible.  My steak knife could not cut through most of it.  The waiter kindly took it away and did not charge us for it.  My wife had salmon.  She found it dried up and left much of it.  The accompanying mash was so salty as also to be inedible.  I wouldn't recommend the 22 Bar for food.",3,2022,09,27

223,Castleknock Hotel and Spa,I stayed for two nights in the Castleknock hotel and Spa and had an amazing experience. I am a wheelchair user and am nervous about going to hotels on my own but the staff in the hotel made us all feel very welcome and where very accommodating and friendly. It was a very relaxing and enjoyable experience. I had a facial and my make up done in the Spa area and the staff in the Spa we‚Äôre so friendly and accommodating. Getting my makeup and facial where the highlight of my stay. I would recommend the hotel to anyone. I can‚Äôt wait to stay there again.,5,2022,09,16

We had picked 3 other hotels in the area only to find out from each that the pools were all closed after we had booked so had to cancel as a pool was something we wanted.

223,Amazing,"Everything in the hotel from the man greeting us at the door and all the facilities in the rooms (Dyson Hairdryer, coffee machine, beds & tea making) were all five star.

223,Beautiful Hotel apart from City,"Castleknock hotel is very nice and close to parks if exercise and running is in your mind.  It is far from downtown Dublin, so it is recommended to have car or a transportation plan if sightseeing of Dublin is in the plans.
The value for my room was not bad, but my room was the size of a walking closet.",4,2022,09,13
223,Fantastic weekend in Dublin,"Beautiful hotel,  lovely views over golf course. Staff very helpful and friendly.  Nice atmosphere in lobby after we returned from Croke park seeing Garth Brooks, the entertainment was playing some country songs which was lovely. Leisure facilities very nice, not too happy about having to wear a swimming hat or paying 3 Euros for the hat. Room very nice and clean, Bed very comfortable slept really well.  Had everything we needed in the room (slippers were not good quality, my husband's were broken by the time he walked downstairs.) Only criticism in the room is some of the bathroom could do with updating around the shower etc. Food was nice in the bar. Breakfast was nice, however they fold over the bacon when cooking it which means the inside never gets crispy. Perhaps wider plates so everything doesn't end up in the middle of the plate. These are just minor things on the whole we had a great time and would stay again. Good location for the station and thanks for directions and train times so we could get to Croke Park. Brilliant weekend, loved the hotel.",5,2022,09,13
223,Nice stay at a good price. Golf course good also. Service excellent.,"Golf trip with friends. Stayed 3 nights, played 3 rounds on Castleknock golf course and really enjoyed it.

I can see myself coming back again.,5,2022,09,12
223,Best choice for hotels in Dublin,"We stayed at Castleknock Hotel September 2022 during a family vacation, traveling with one child. We had a triple room with breakfast included. The hotel is co-located with a golf course in a lovely suburb of Dublin. From the moment we walked in, we were impressed by the friendliness of staff, who went the extra mile to help us. Special thanks to Martin the concierge who recommended a wonderful local restaurant. There are many east Europeans on staff, but all were helpful and friendly; excellent staff training is apparent. The lobby and restaurants were posh, there is a great gym, and the grounds are beautiful. The buffet breakfast was top notch, with many hot and cold choices. Staff graciously grabbed me some coffee and nibbles when I walked in an hour before opening on a Saturday to catch a flight. We drove, but there is a bus a scenic short walk away that takes you to the center of Dublin. The room was overall great, with tea and an espresso maker. One minor negative was the mattress I had - it clearly has supported a few too many large bodies. There is no AC (generally none in Ireland) but we were able to sleep with an open window with not a single mosquito finding us. My advice to those visiting Dublin, or even just there for a long layover - skip the industrial hotels at the airport and treat yourself to Castleknock. Y‚Äôall will thank me later.",5,2022,09,11
223,Lovely property and excellent venue for small business conference,"Our small group meeting was very enjoyable at Castleknock. The rooms, facilities, grounds and food were all top notch. Everything was of the highest standard. Loved the Dyson hair dryer - added bonus! ",5,2022,09,11

Food was great; huge choice at breakfast and all fresh, had lunch in the bar from the bar menu and this was also excellent. Overall our stay was excellent, would stay again.",4,2022,09,05
223,Beautiful Setting,"Beautiful setting and lovely food although location is just a bit far out from the city ‚Ç¨30 in a taxi x 2 and ‚Ç¨30 back in the evening. We just decided to drive ourselves after the first day. 
Close to Blanchardstown shopping Centre, drove to Phoenix Park(the man at the door of the hotel pinned my location to a gate that was closed at the Park) drove to Liffey Valley Shopping Centre, all in close enough proximity but not walkable. 
Was also promised a Deluxe Executive Suite for our Minimoon and to me our room was standard. Very standard. Very Very standard. We were really disappointed. ",4,2022,09,02
223,Love the friendly staff,"We had a lovely stay for our wedding anniversary. We has a lovely room overlooking the golf course.

Lovely staff throughout the hotel.",5,2022,09,01

223,Fantastic hotel!,"Booked for a long weekend in Dublin with family. From the minute we arrived it was great. We were greeted by Martin who helped us to our room with our luggage. The restaurant booked us a table via email before we arrived and organised a lovely Happy Birthday song for my son's birthday. The rooms were equipped with Elemis lotions and potions and Dyson hairdryer, there were even choices of pillows and robes and slippers  for the spa. In the evening there was a live singer that entertained till quite late. If you can take your own golf clubs the golf course looked great too. We hired a car and found it easy to commute into Dublin city centre. Definitely a good find look forward to returning one day soon.",5,2022,08,31
223,Excellent alternative to airport hotels,"We needed a place to stay the night before our flight back home when there were no rooms at any Dublin airport hotels. Fortunately, we found the Castleknock hotel which is a 15 min ride to the airport. Hotel grounds and location was perfect. We loved the quiet location, ample facilities and amenities. Highly recommend when traveling in and out of Dublin airport.",5,2022,08,30
223,Fantastic stay,"Beautiful room, great food , friendly service and brilliant facilities. Would recommend this hotel for a relaxing luxurious break . The DBB package includes a three course meal which was of good quality and there were treats for the roomüôÇ",5,2022,08,29

223,Could have been so much better,"Average stay, everything seemed to be too much effort and every time you spoke to someone they would say nothing to do with me speak to someone else. Informed them that one of us being dairy free before arriving yet had to keep mentioning and checking",3,2022,08,28
223,Delightful service,I came with a couple of friends and we were served by a young man named Anthony. He was so helpful and welcoming. Had a nice little laugh while he still worked professionally! Service was great! We will be coming down more often! Was great to see young people enjoying their job.,5,2022,08,26
223,Uncomfortable,"We attended a wedding hold near by so we stayed at this location. If I had known ahead time that has no A/C and is just an average place, like a Hampton Inn, I would of stayed in Dublin city itself. Impossible to sleep with just a tiny fan which wouldn't even reach the window. Nothing special about the rooms, in fact the shower was tiny and lacking soap. Our TV kept blacking out and one night had no reception at all. Eventhough the property appears to be recently constructed it seems they cut corners.",3,2022,08,26
223,outstanding stay  at Castleknock Hotel,the hotel is very clean  and the rooms  big   /staff are very friendly and go out of their way to help you   / the food is  wonderful  and you have  a good choice to chooses from   / and  I cant wait to stay again   ,5,2022,08,25
223,Great bedroom & unbeliveable breakfast,"We stayed in a family room that was big enough as we have still young children. We all slept very well. The breakfast is out of this world in quality and diversity. Everything we tried was delicious. We also enjoyed the swimming pool in the morning that was the cherry on the cake.
On the down side, the hotel is really at the end of Castleknock and I would probably say more in Blanchardstown :-)
We would definitively stay there again.",5,2022,08,25
223,Brilliant hotel,"Best hotel stay ever, Dyson hairdryers in the room is a bonus.
I was a wedding guest and everything was amazing from food to service, hotel stay- everything was perfect! Couldn't recommend this hotel enough! ",5,2022,08,24
223,Exceptional service,"When we departed we left behind some clothes and electronics. The hotel staff posted them to us the next day. This, I thought, was an exceptional service. All members of staff, throughout our stay, were incredibly nice and cheerful. The swimming pool was excellent.",5,2022,08,24

The food is amazing and we will definitely be returning in the future. Can't rate this hotel enough, so family-friendly yet you wouldn't even know there were kids there. Can't wait to return. Many thanks.",5,2022,08,18
223,Dinner and drinks,"Very average food. 
We arrived in the late evening and ordered Jacobs Ladder (I confirmed this was a rack of ribs before ordering) and burger with side salad. 
The food came out immediately, which was concerning. We checked the burger in case it was not cooked through but it was fine, which means it was pre-prepared. The side salad was some lettuce with a dressing and looked like a large garnish. We asked the waiting staff if this was normal and she said it usually has tomato and other stuff. She offered to return the plate to add stuff. Instead we asked her to bring a side salad as we were hungry. She did and it was ok.
The ""rack of ribs"" was a lump of gristle with some charred bits. It came on mash potato in a pool of gravy and a bit of sweet corn from a can on the side. 
The staff were nice and friendly, they asked if the food was good and we said it was only ok, they nodded like they knew what we meant. 
Pints were nice!",3,2022,08,17
223,Lunch in Castleknock,"Had a day off today and went for lunch in the Patio at the Castleknock Hotel with my wife and one daughter and her children. The menu is comprehensive and child friendly with children‚Äôs menu. Great food and friendly staff. Free EV charges available in the car park. 

Well worth a visit. They have a ‚Ç¨79.00 two course evening meal for two with bottle of wine Sunday to Thursday. Got a flyer in the door this morning about the offer.",4,2022,08,17
223,Comfort and Relaxation,"I have stayed here on more than one occasion and have never been let down. The beds are really comfortable and the shower is lovely. I have eaten in the bar and restaurant and as far as hotel eateries go , it js far above average and really enjoyable. They do the best pornstar martini too! There is often live music on the weekend and the lobby has a lovely atmosphere to it. The hotel is always busy and there can be queues but it is managed particularly well by the reception staff who are informative and friendly. It is a family friendly hotel which provides amenities for children and lovely surrounding areas. I have not yet visited the spa but it is always busy and booked up so that should speak for itself. The pool and jacuzzi area is gorgeous and I always leave feeling relaxed. It is the kind of hotel I will always return to due to its consistency. Special mention to Elaine & Mairead at reception who were both amazing! We will be back soon",5,2022,08,15
223,Short break,"Family break away with teenagers, very pleasant stay, close enough to Dublin centre to get a taxi, also Blanchardstown shopping centre 10 mins away by car, Phoenix Park also close by...just maybe need a few more extras for teenagers on site!",4,2022,08,15
223,Beautiful hotel,"We have stayed here a few times and got married here! Every time we go back they have added something to make your stay even better! Food was lovely, room was great staff as always very friendly. Outdoor seating was really nice and comfortable.",5,2022,08,15
223,Unusual bad experience,"Was placed near wedding party so could not get a good sleep during the night due to running up and down the corridor hotel staff had to come and talk to the guests, the next morning was woke early as the wedding party decided to leave all their doors open so then could walk from room to room,check in experience was awkward as we paid for the executive suite and at check in I asked the concierge for a specific room she answered no you only paid for the executive suite the room you want it deluxe I would of happily paid extra as we had our honeymoon here but the option was not given ",2,2022,08,15
223,22 Bar and Restaurant,"Myself and my friend stayed into the castle knock hotel a while back when I was pregnant and we had a lovely time. We decided to pay a visit to the restaurant today with my two year old son and I have to say I was very impressed with the kids menu and the healthy options they had, it was a good alternative to the standard chicken nuggets and chips on most kids menus. My son ordered the Bolognese and it had some nice hidden veggies in it too, he really enjoyed it... However, I was disappointed in the quality of my main course. I ordered a Thai green curry and although the chicken was succulent and tasty I was unimpressed by what felt like a sponge texture that was mostly pumped with water to give it extra moister. Water pumped chicken to me is cheap and I don't expect this quality from a 22euro main course. My friend ordered Wings and truffle fries, the wings were good but the fries were drowned in truffle oil. My expectation of truffle fries is some nice crispy skin on fries with a sprinkle of parmesan cheese and truffle again I was just very unimpressed with the standard and quality for the price. I know I should have complained at the time which would be the right thing to do but my toddler was getting impatient and we had to leave. I hope that this can be improved as we hope to visit again.",3,2022,08,14
223,Great stay lovely hotel,"Lovely fresh clean hotel great location  and Staff very polite and helpful. Ample parking and pool v nice  although steam room didn‚Äôt seem overly hot

223,Family of 5 squeezed in to twin room,"Booked standard family which was a standard twin room, much too small, cramped and hot hot hot. Room above service doors and listened to staff coming and going to the early hours. Complained after one night and moved to interconnecting rooms. ",3,2022,08,11
223,First class hotel,Stayed one night and wished I was staying for longer. Excellent facilities provided in the room. Helpful and friendly staff. Comfortable and spacious lounge areas. Breakfast had everything you could wish for and evening dining was excellent. ,5,2022,08,10
223,Guest at wedding stay,"We stayed for a wedding and over overall experience was good with the exception of an issue we had at breakfast where we were told certain areas were adult only. Seen as we were with children that didn‚Äôt sit quite well as we all paid our money to stay there and adults mix with kids, families etc in all other parts of the hotel who is the breakfast area any different.

223,Make up by Eloise,"I booked a full make up application by Eloise at Castleknock Hotel for an awards event. From the moment I arrived I was welcomed with a glass of bubbles and Eloise made me feel like a star. The setting is wow, the quality of the products are superb and well the magician is Eloise. Eloise is the best MUA in the country. I have tried them all MAC, Charlotte Tilbury, Dior etc. Eloise has an eye like no other. She will bring your face and features to life. Treat yourself for that special event and ask for Eloise!",5,2022,08,03
223,Flawless. Amazing hotel & staff.,"We had a family wedding. The food, staff, hotel, everything was amazing. I could not fault any part of our experience, except for one thing, the heat in the place is unreal. The aircon was not being used for some reason so the ventilation was bad, we had to keep going outside. I know its better than being cold but still. ",5,2022,08,02
223,Excellence,"The hotel was very nice and the spa was amazing as I had a treatment there which I throughly enjoyed

223,Excellent hotel in Dublin surrounds,"During two recent stays at the Castleknock hotel, we experienced very good to even excellent all-around service, amenities, facilities, and more. Cleanliness and functionality was very good, with the exception of an ironing board sadly in need of replacement, and staff were often friendly, and typically respectful and helpful as appropriate. A four-out-of-five-star experience.",4,2022,07,28
223,Shocked and disappointed,"I was shocked and disappointed to be told that my gift voucher for Castleknock hotel was no longer valid after a short period of time. I was unable to use the voucher due to restrictions from the pandemic. Very poor customer service.
I will be taking this matter further if not resolved by the hotel ASAP",1,2022,07,26
223,You could die of thirst,The Bar service is poor and the food is nothing write home about. The surroundings are very nice and if the sun is out its lovely to sit in the Garden. Rooms are nice and the beds are really comfortable .,4,2022,07,25
223,Excellent,"Excellent staff, rooms where beautiful and very well maintained, food was very good. Overall this was by far the best of four hotels we stayed in while home visiting family and friends. We stayed in two rooms times the first was a couples room which was our favourite the second was a family room which wasn't our favourite but it was clean and in good condition. ",5,2022,07,24
223,"Wonderful stay, restaurant and bar were splendid","I recently stayed in the hotel and everything was wonderful. What really stood out was the food and service in both the bar and restaurant. The service from Darina, Jennifer and Alan was flawless under the watchful eyes of managers Andrew and Illeana. Couldn‚Äôt recommend the bar and restaurant enough. The hake and steaks in the restaurant were divine. 
Thanks for a wonderful stay.",5,2022,07,23

223,Fabulous hotel,Couldn‚Äôt be happier with the service we received. Myself and my friend decided last minute for a girls night away and the service we received was amazing. We dined in the earth and vine restaurant the food and service was amazing then went to the bar for some cocktails. The drinks and service where fabulous. The young short manager in the lime tree bar also had a nice butt which was some eye candy so also added to the experience.We most definitely will be back,5,2022,07,22
223,Castleknock Top Drawer,Made to feel like a king from the moment you step through the doorüëå Exceptional food combined with excellent service. The perfect combination to a short trip. Would recommend the hotel to anyone. You wouldn‚Äôt be disappointed ,5,2022,07,19

223,"Great Location, Great Atmosphere, Great Food & A Great Team","Very enjoyable stay in the Castleknock Hotel. Fantastic facilities to suit all. We were on a family mini vacation and The Castleknock hotel ticks all out boxes. From the moment you arrive, this Hotel feels welcoming. Plenty of choice of restaurants to eat, from outdoor terrace, 22 bar & Restaurant or the Earth & Vine Restaurant. Ease of check in and check out, was also notable great.",5,2022,07,18

No hesitation in recommending

223,Concert weekend in Dublin,"I took my son and his friend to a concert in Dublin and we selected Castleknock as our base for the night. The late checkin was not an issue and the staff we friendly , we had a smashing breakfast the following morning and used the leisure centre before we hit the road home. A lovely hotel and we will be back. ",5,2022,07,12
223,Stayed a night hugely disappointed ,"I visit this hotel regularly for meals and special occasions as I do not live far from the hotel but never stayed the night before.
My close friend used the venue for his wedding and being best man I stayed the night with my family.
I have to say I was hugely disappointed with the room.
Family of 4 people expected to sleep in just two beds.
Terrible night and terrible value for money.
Really was surprised and disappointed about this as usually I only speak good words about this hotel",2,2022,07,12
223,Beautiful hotel,Wonderful hotel. Located outside of downtown Dublin. Beautiful property. My only complaint was the shower is very small. Breakfast was fantastic and overall room and hotel very nice. It‚Äôs a bit of a distance from downtown so it‚Äôs a cab ride away from most touristy things in Dublin. If you‚Äôre there to golf and relax it‚Äôs great. ,5,2022,07,11
223,Nice but not the standard expected,A very nicely laid out hotel in spacious grounds and beautiful golf course. Good for families. Check in was ok although the receptionist was fairly matter of fact and handed me an information sheet - not the usual explanation a new visitor would get. Service in the bar and dining areas was a bit patchy. Some staff very good others not so. Maybe a management issue here. The executive double room was well appointed with a nice view of the golf course. The room facilities were very good indeed but no aircon. Big downside is the constant quite loud drone of the centrally positioned service plant which obviously runs 24/7. Had to keep the window closed at night and it was therefore uncomfortably stuffy. Both Evening meal in 22 restaurant was very poor and one was refunded although that doesn‚Äôt really compensate for the disappointment. It was a rather conveyor belt experience. Breakfast was very good with a great selection of everything. A good bar restaurant nearby - Carpenter‚Äôs. Had the cost been less I would give a 1 better overall rating. However at these prices everything should be running more smoothly.,3,2022,07,11
223,Business People Beware!!,"My work travel department booked a standard room for me to attend a conference that was being held in the Castleknock hotel.  When I checked in I was assigned a single room, no bigger than a closet with a fairly shabby bathroom. When I went to reception I was told take it or leave as they were fully booked and that a sole occupancy room was a single room.  I pointed out I have been travelling for work for over 20 years and this was the first hotel that I ever heard of insisting that a sole occupancy room had to be a single room and a standard room had been booked and paid for, however receptionist was extremely rude and kept arguing that was the hotel policy.  So Business people BEWARE a standard room when booked to stay for business is a single room according to hotel reception.  As I have a bad back and would have suffered the next day if I had stayed in the hotel so I had no choice but to leave. I was the loss of the cost of conference and travel expenses (travel dept trying to get refund for the room). The only hotel in the world that has this policy so everyone needs to know what they are getting when booking what you think is a standard room you might get a broom closet if you are staying on your own!",1,2022,07,11
223,Food was extremely disappointing!!,"My all over experience of the hotel was very good the staff etc were extremely hopeful and couldn‚Äôt do enough for any guest , beautiful hotel really family friendly just the food was a major let down unfortunately very very disappointed ruined my all over safe.",1,2022,07,05
223,Great service,"Thank you Mairead for the early checkin. she could not have done anymore for us, we were under pressure going to a wedding. Service was fantastic, staff are well trained. lovely brekkie. spacious room. location is brilliant. top marks well done",5,2022,07,03

223,Colette Duffy,"I visited Castleknock Hotel today for a spa day and afternoon tea package with my friend..  While my facial and massage were good my full package experience was very disappointing.  The steam room was out of service with no notice on door and nobody informed us of this, the sauna and hot tub were full beyond capacity which is totally unacceptable in this covid environment and nobody monitoring numbers.  Most hand sanitisers were empty.  The dressing gowns were hard, over washed and off white.  I would not recommend this spa which was quite expensive by comparison and not worth the money.  I reiterate my facial was good",1,2022,06,27
223,Great Service,Recently we dined at the Castleknock Hotel. The meal was very nice and served very efficiently. The service for our drinks before and after the meal was really quick. Our server was Jennifer and she was really helpful and efficient.,5,2022,06,27
223,Superb place,"Played golf today with our golf society. The golf course was in excellent condition. The staff were very professional and really helpful.
Food is not served Monday and Tuesday in the clubhouse. The prize presentations were held in the hotel.
I have never visited this hotel before,all I can say is WOW, what a place. The reception  area is very spacious and warm. The bar area is class. I will stay here sometime in the future. 
The restaurant area is open and fresh. The staff were very professional. We ordered food which was superb as was the service. 
If you are looking for pure class this is the place. Although I live in Drogheda this hotel is now on  my bucket list. Guys I was amazed. Everything about this place is top class. Yes I will be back 11/10. ",5,2022,06,13
223,Perfect place for a relaxing trip!,"Last December myself and my sister spent a night at Castleknock Hotel. It was seamless! The lady at reception was very helpful and friendly (I think her name was Louise). She took our bags while we went for a spa treatment. The treatment itself was very reasonable and relaxing- it was their winter warmer special. We really enjoyed it but the relaxation room could have done with a few staff cleaning it more often as there would be cups and plates when people left. When we were there the lights were also a bit too bright so I would recommend dimming them a tad more! The other thing was that while we were there in our robes after a massage, there were fully dressed women perched on the other beds waiting for their treatments which was more unnerving than relaxing. It was nice but it would be more enjoyable if it wasn't also used as a waiting room.

We were very relaxed and got straight into the 22 bar and restaurant where we had a nice lunch looked after by Raul. Check in was smooth and the room was fantastic,  with a nice big telly connected to Netflix and a lovely bath. We had our dinner in 22 again and we found the food a bit bland, but the cocktails were very tasty and Christopher was a charismatic waiter. Overall the hotel had a nice, relaxed vibe, with a lovely buzz in the main lobby/cafe area. The decor was lovely and all of the staff were helpful and attentive. Everyone down to the cleaning staff would greet you, making a really lovely atmosphere.",4,2022,06,11
223,Very enjoyable stay,"We chose the Castleknock Hotel due to its proximity to the Phoenix Park for Bloom.  Staff were exceptionally professional, friendly and helpful.  We had an excellent meal in the restaurant and the rooms were very well equipped - Nespresso machine, robes, slippers etc.  So good we booked for next year!",5,2022,06,07
223,So accommodating,The staff were so accommodating as I needed access to the room early to lay out some presents for a birthday! They were all so friendly and helpful! The hotel itself is in a great location and is absolutely stunning with the rooms and facilities all so modern and classy! ,4,2022,06,07
223,Lovely Hotel but need to sharpen up on food,"We really like this hotel and found the room extremely clean and comfortable.  The beds are great.  The leisure centre was great.  Breakfast was fine with an excellent choice of fruit chilled to perfection.  However the cooked breakfast like most buffet breakfasts could do with being served a little warmer.  

However the 22 Bar and restaurant was extremely disappoint in the evening.  I had the fish and chips but it tasted as if it had been pre-cooked and re heated before serving.  My wife's meal was also cold and had to be returned.  However the dessert did gain a few points as it was well made and tasted good.  

would still go back as room was great,  leisure area was enjoyable, and the location is superb.  Staff are excellent.  ",4,2022,06,06
223,Stay,"Only complaint was the noise from the wedding, woken by the music, would suggest arranging for other guests being facilitated away from function rooms, other than that it was fine. Have stayed here before. ",5,2022,06,06
223,Lovely hotel on the outskirts of Dublin,"Lovely hotel on the outskirts of Dublin.  We stayed for a couple of nights at the end of our Ireland vacation to relax before heading home.

223,Wedding,"Had volauvons for starter, the chicken pieces were fridge cold but the mushroom sauce was hot.  The staff went round topping up with e during the meal that's if they actually stopped at a table and asked anyone if they would like a top up.  The staff came round to collect unused glasses, I had just finished a glass of white wine, I was asked was I going to be drinking wine with the dinner, I said yes and the waiter lifted both glasses, I had to ask for one back.  We were told.there was a kids desert but they never got it.   The best of all was I bought a round of drink two pints, and 8 shorts came to ‚Ç¨60.46.   

Breakfast staff, front of house  staff and accommodation staff excellent so my reason for my summary as follows:-

Very expensive for drink, should not be doing functions. However for an over night or short stay perfect.",2,2022,06,05

223,Great stay at this lovely hotel!,"We had a relaxing stay at the Castleknock Hotel, our suite was luxurious, the breakfast and evening meals were delicious and the staff were very friendly and hardworking. We were only a short walk away from a bus stop that took you into the centre of Dublin at a very reasonable price, where we did some sightseeing and visited the Guinness Storehouse. A very enjoyable short break!",5,2022,06,04

The Castleknock Hotel is a   beautiful  place and on that sunny day in May its outdoor space was magical !! The staff were most attentive to us all, nothing was too much trouble for them. The food was excellent and plentiful, and  the garden was a  spectacular setting for the photographs. The Phoenix Suite  was spacious and  beautifully decorated  for our meal. We have nothing but praise for  the hotel and for its staff, who made the day so memorable.",5,2022,06,03
223,Fantastic hotel,"We had a family wedding in Dublin. We could not have had a better location for family and friends to stay, gather, eat and drink. The spa is beautiful and the pool was great fun.

The Bedrooms were very comfortable & well appointed, and the food in both restaurant & 22 bar was first class.
Superb - will certainly recommend this hotel to friends and we will definitely come again!

Swimming pool fresh and spotless ",5,2022,05,12
223,"Nice and beautiful Hotel, Great Hospitality","I am currently staying at the Castleknock Hotel and I have to admit, that I wasn‚Äôt expecting to less. I am on a bussines trip and in terms of accommodation and hospitality I couldn‚Äôt ask for more. 

The reception was friendly, polite and kompetent, the rooms are quite big, very clean and nicely equipped. 
But the biggest surprise to me, was the really excellent restaurant. The menu offered plenty varieties of tasty prepared food, and I think, that all of my 22 colleagues have been very happy. 

But the dinner service from Daria and Iliana, has been one of a kind and somewhat outstanding. Both have always been around, they have been patient and kind, understanding and absolutely attentive at all times. They really made the evening, a great and relaxed evening. A big ,,Thank you very much!‚Äú, from my side. 

Greetings, Martin",5,2022,05,10
223,overnight stay,"we were staying in the hotel as we were attending a party there, bedroom nice, staff helpful, breakfast good and plenty of choice 
only thing the function room ran out of beer, tills went down and only one staff member left to deal with it all, that was the only disappointing part of our stay",4,2022,05,10
223,Golf Stay,This is a very busy hotel with a great buzz going on. I stayed in a suite and it was an amazing room with everything you could possible want.  There was lots of options for food and a good breakfast buffet.  All the staff were very friendly and helpful.,5,2022,05,09
223,Make up with Elloise and one night stay,I stayed in the hotel for the day two of my wedding celebrations. I had my make up done with Elloise in the spa. This is the second time I‚Äôve returned for make up with Elloise. She also did make up on my sisters. Her service was five star. She is professional and takes her time perfecting your make up. Her make up lasted excellently and the coverage was super. She is lovely to chat to and I throughly enjoyed the experience. I would highly recommend her for make up and I will certainly be back. Thank you Elloise.,5,2022,05,08
223,Awful service in earth and vine,"We booked earth and vine for Saturday night 7th May for 6 people, we hadn‚Äôt been out in ages and were really looking forward to catching up with friends.
What an awful experience, 
Four meals arrived, the orders had not been put through, so four people had well finished their meal before two other people had even received their food,
The waitress was in a complete fluster, she couldn‚Äôt get anything right, waiting forever for a drink, wrong drinks delivered, 
No orders taken for dessert, so we had none, 
Then apparently the system went down, so we were waiting forever for the bill.
The restaurant manager apologised, and agreed that we had not had good service or a good experience, and offered us a complimentary drink.
We ordered, and it never arrived!!!!!!!!!!!
Never again

223,Fantastic hotel ,"So stayed here on business in the month of May 2022. Highly impressive hotel and one where you should I suppose dress up a bit.
Only stayed one night so did not get chance to sample all it had to offer ie pool and spa.
The food I had with my colleagues was really good. I had salmon which was very nice with a fab crispy skin - only one let down were the greens were quite cold in honesty. This was priced at 22 euro.
Cheesecake was brilliant and the drink I thought were reasonable. Mainly had Heineken which was 6 euro a pint. 
My room a suite was stunning and with a Nespresso machine which I didn't use as not enough time really.
Shower was lovely with 2 different shower heads and superb  underfloor heating. Shame the other people in the hotel can't close doors quietly in the morning as they are heavy doors and when they slam do disturb you. The bed was mahoosive and I slept incredibly well which is unusual for me.
Highlight of the night was some lad working in the restaurant bar turned up the tv for the football until his boss arrived and shouted quite loudly turn it down right down this isn't a pub ü§∑!
All in all a lovely place and looking forward to staying again in a few weeks time for another business trip I have to come over for 
",5,2022,05,06

223,Excellent staff in lobby area,"Last week I had a meeting at the Castleknock hotel.  All the staff working in the lobby area were great and really helpful but one girl, Jennifer Miron, particularly stood out for her friendly, courteous and pleasant manner. She's a wonderful asset to any team.",5,2022,05,02
223,2 Night Break,"Stayed Here again this week while attending 2 Award ceremonies in Dublin City Centre. Checked in quite late and was greeted by a fabulous receptionist (her name escapes me). Room was lovely with a View out over one of the Holes of the Golf Course. Massive Bed again like last time, and slept very soundly! 

Breakfast both mornings was very tasty with both Continental and Full buffet options to choose from, really fills you up for the day!

Until Next Time!",4,2022,04,29

223,Amazing Hotel for Families,"We recently stayed here for 4 nights with our two young children. Hotel itself is modern, spacious and has a great vibe the minute you walk inside the foyer. Staff are friendly and helpful. We found the pool amazing as it had 2 smaller areas for younger kids, loads of floats available and plenty of space. The food in the hotel is good. We had poor room service one evening and we were refunded in full and received an apology from the manager so we were very satisfied with this. Mistakes happen. Our interconnecting family rooms were ideal and air conditioned. Housekeeping staff very helpful and polite. There is a small playground off the terrace also. Loved the fact that there was ample parking at no additional cost like some Dublin hotels. It was an ideal base for visits to the Zoo and Tayto Park. Would definitely return again.",5,2022,04,25
223,Lovely stay,"Had a lovely stay following our trip to Tayto Park.  Hotel was busy but we enjoyed a drink in the sun while the kids played on the swings.  The pool was great and not too busy.  We were celebrating my husband's 40th birthday and I had added a note to the booking to say this was the purpose of our stay.  We had checked in online prior to arrival, so check in was very quick, hotel was spotless and the room was amazing.  When we went to the room, there was a birthday balloon, a card and a box of truffles for my husband.  What a lovely touch, thank you to the staff at Castleknock.  Breakfast was really good, especially the pancake maker which the kids loved.  Thank you for a great stay.",4,2022,04,25

223,Excellent stay- friendly staff and superb food.,"We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel. We opted for the ‚ÄòTime for Two‚Äô package and would highly recommend. The staff were so helpful from the minute we arrived in the car park. The food was superb and everything was so fresh. We also enjoyed a relaxing time in the hotels jacuzzi, pool and other leisure facilities which were all spotless and very well run. The only complaint we would have is that the ‚Äòchill out hamper‚Äô wasn‚Äôt in packages so we ended up leaving a lot of it behind us which we didn‚Äôt wish to do as it was a lovely touch.",5,2022,04,15

223,Return visit,"Great hotel, beautiful rooms and good facilities. Have stayed several times over the last 10 years and never had a bad experience. 

Location is a fair distance outside Dublin, but is easily accessible by car. 

Positives : Great service, reception, bar and waiting staff all really pleasant and helpful. Lovely, comfortable and spotlessly clean rooms. Fabulous breakfast 

Negatives: Only small let-down was the quality of the room service meal. Service was fine and was delivered quickly, but definitely not the best meal I‚Äôve had in this hotel.",4,2022,04,14
223,Afternoon Tea,Absolutely delightful experience. I was in Dublin visiting family. On the advice of an friend we booked an afternoon tea. The service was impeccable and the food was wonderful. We were treated like old friends and nothing was too much trouble. Ileana the restaurant manager was so attentive and Naomi our server made sure we have everything we needed. If I had to find something to complain about it was the abundance of delicious food and what to eat next. A absolute must!,5,2022,04,14
223,"Great girls day out, hotel beautiful and excellent staff","Cannot fault this hotel and I have stayed all over Ireland. Service was excellent, especially in the bar / restaurant. The food was excellent and the cocktails were out of this world. The staff were on hand to help at all stages. I would highly recommend this hotel and look forward to my return visit.",5,2022,04,13
223,Great food & excellent service - a little gem of a hotel,"We visited there as group of friends catching up from covid restrictions. I was firstly surprised to see customer sink in lobby to sanitise hands - fantastic idea . We went to bar where French man Oliver looked after us for cocktails and drinks , he kindly recommended a great bottle of wine and cocktails . He was great fun to chat to and joke with as our group really enjoyed his customer service and knowledge . We then went to restaurant to have lunch- hot , great choice and catered effortlessly for diet requirements for one of our friends ( who has difficulty when dining out , but she was very impressed and will be returning as it was so easy to get her diet accommodated to) we then went back towards bar where Oliver persuaded us to stay for another drink which we ended up buying 3 rounds later before we had to all depart.
What a gem of a hotel and staff , everyone was engaging, happy to be there and full of great auld Irish customer service - we even observed the bar manger slagging another table as he served them and had them in stitches laughing -
Well done Castleknock hotel - great service great team and excellent food 
Highly recommended",5,2022,04,13
223,Great hotel,Such a great hotel went with my boyfriend and our son. The little play ground and the swimming pool is were we sent our whole time. The staff are brilliant and really friendly especially with kids. I can not recommend this hotel enough I will definitely be back,5,2022,04,13
223,Disappointing,"Hotel is really lovely but is let down by unhelpful staff. While I was eating lunch I asked my server if he could organise a taxi for me as lunch (which was delicious) had taken longer than expected to arrive. I had to leave my meal & go do it myself. There were 5 (yes 5!!) standing around the little podium & I was told I‚Äôd have to go over to the podium at the front door to order a taxi. I asked would one of them do it for me as I‚Äôd left my lunch & one of them was lovely & sorted it for me, but I don‚Äôt feel it was an unreasonable request & only 1 person out of 6 was willing to help a resident. We had drinks in the foyer later & yet again, lots of staff hanging around but none to take an order. I had to get the really lovely lady at the front door to get someone to take our order. Then later on in the bar, there was only 1 bar person to deal with a very busy bar & my goodness was he grumpy about it. Most hotels are very understaffed, this hotel has lots of staff & the only pleasant or helpful one was the door lady (I think her name is Erica. It‚Äôs actually shocking how unfriendly the place is. I work in the service industry & I know how hard the work is, but there was no excuse for this. Ireland is meant to be the friendliness nation, let‚Äôs hope our overseas visitors don‚Äôt stay in The Castleknock Hotel.",3,2022,04,12
223,Home away from Home,"A short break that didn't disappoint.

Online checkin and checkout was a bonus and made the usual experience much more efficient and enjoyable.

The room and bathroom were clean to a high standard.  The room we stayed in was a perfect size and well equipped with coffee machine and other quality extras.

Breakfast was hearty and hassle free.

I would recommend staying here.",5,2022,04,11
223,Mixed Bag,"The atrium of the hotel is lovely as are the staff however rooms are tired and could do with a revamp. 

The hotel hits the mark on a number of aspects however staying over night was a let down, decor dated and drains in bathroom smell",3,2022,04,11
223,Not what we expected,"If you're looking for a spot to stay that is quiet this is NOT the place to stay. If our reservation was not already paid for we would have walked out. There were kids running around out of control and drunk a group of drunk disorderly people from a wedding all over the lounge area and it wasn't just this evening it was all four day's we were there it. Then our room looked over the back of the kitchen area and at 4:00 a.m. the cooks were out smoking and talking. Then the first morning we were there I went to take a shower and all the large towels were covered in black stained oil when I asked for new towels I did get them but, they were old and warn out.  We did use the spa which was fantastic but, you change in the general locker area and after our spa treatments the area was full of once again out of control kids a very dirty floor and the towel hamper was overflowing and smelled so bad. Not a fantastic end to a great message. 
The staff was very nice but, unfortunately that doesn't make your stay. We come to Ireland a couple times a year and will NOT be staying at this hotel again and will not recommend it. Not the 4 Starr hotel we expected at all.",3,2022,04,10
223,Canadian family trip,"Great stay . 3 golf courses within 5min . Full of families and Hotel loves having kids .  . Free parking . Very safe area of Dublin . ‚Ç¨20 taxi into city .. bus 250m away .

223,Birthday break,"Overall enjoyed our stay, was totally relaxing can‚Äôt wait to book again soon, our only disappointment was the evening meal starters and desserts were good but the main meal not much of a choice, the waiting staff were very helpful and polite along with all the staff very friendly.",5,2022,04,08
223,"Nice rooms, Good location and good place to recharge",The rooms were clean and spacious with robes and rainfall shower. Breakfast was lovely. Food was the average standard you would expect for a hotel in Ireland but not something I would return exclusively for. The leisure facilities are exceptionally well maintained. There is a menu to select your pillows from which was a nice touch,5,2022,04,08
223,Very good 4*,"Stayed here recently on business.

223,Girls Night Away,"We had an amazing time in the Castleknock Hotel. The food  was next to none from afternoon tea, dinner and breakfast. Fabulous facilities we used jacuzzi,sauna, steam room, and sun loungers. Staff were very friendly personable, kind and efficient. We were welcomed back to the Hotel. This is my third time staying and I can safely say I'll be back. There's a great buzz and the hotel has a heated outdoor area suitable for any occasion. Wonderful time had. Many thanks to all the staff that looked after us.",5,2022,04,05
223,Can't fault this hotel - a wonderful family stay!,"Loved our stay at the Castleknock Hotel, everything was amazing.  The hotel itself is gorgeous and our adjoining rooms were so nice - our 6 year old son and his 7 year old cousin were also very impressed - especially with the complimentary kids goodie bags with soft toy left in the room for them. The food was also great (dinner and breakfast), but the best thing about this hotel is the staff - everyone was warm and welcoming and we were especially impressed with how helpful and polite the younger members of staff were.  Couldn't fault our stay at all!",5,2022,04,05
223,Lovely Afternoon tea,"We spent a very enjoyable afternoon at the hotel having afternoon tea.  It was a real treat and a good idea for a special occasion.   The portions sizes were quite generous so I think the take away boxes were a good idea.  Thank you to the staff who were very attentive,  nothing was too much trouble.",5,2022,04,04
223,fab short stay we will be back,"very nice albeit very short stay but nice to get away from four walls, enjoyed the early evening in the comfortable covered outdoor area before a super 3 course in the bar/restaurant where we spent the remainder of the evening very well looked after by Murray one of the waiting staff, a few drinks were had and enjoyed the first live music in 2 years. a quality stay ",5,2022,04,04
223,Birthday Lunch,"We had booked a table inside the hotel restraunt, but seeing it was a lovely day we asked could we switch to the Terrace area at the front of the hotel for food outside. The staff were extremely accommodating and immediately rearranged the tables and chairs and turned on the heaters. It was a lovely setting. The lunch menu had lots to offer, I had the Avacado & Prawn, which was delicious. The service was excellent and a big thank you to staff member Jennifer who was friendly, attentive and professional. Overall a very enjoyable occasion and will definitely be returning soon.",5,2022,04,04
223,Faultless stay,"I've never written a Trip Advisor review before but I had to for Castleknock hotel. My boyfriend and I stayed for a long weekend over St Patrick's weekend and the hotel was amazing, we genuinely couldn't have faulted anything. The staff were really friendly, especially the doorman Martin who couldn't have been more helpful. He always greeted us with a smile as he opened the door and took the time to chat to us. He booked numerous taxi's for us, kept us up to date with timings and made our stay stress-free. The rooms were spacious and clean (with the comfiest bed), the food in the restaurant was lovely and the spa had everything you need for a relaxing stay. We already can't wait to go back!",5,2022,03,30
223,Very Expensive Second Rate Food,"We decided to visit the Castleknock Hotel for food today as it was my Daughters Confirmation and some of her friends were going to the hotel for lunch.
We initially planned to go elsewhere but we persuaded to go to The Hotel.

We didn‚Äôt have a reservation so they put us on The Terrace which was fine.
The terrace is enclosed and has a nice atmosphere.

The staff were friendly and everything was going well until the food arrived.

Myself and my daughter ordered Fish and Chips.
The Fish had obviously been reheated as it was burnt on the outside.
The chips I‚Äôd guess were recooked at least 3 times and uneatable.

My wife ordered the salmon which consisted of a small fillet of salmon as you would see in packs in the supermarket.
This was sitting on a small circle of potato and had a spattering of vegetables.
They charged ‚Ç¨38 for this and if your seen it you would know how disappointing it was.

The last order was an Indian Chicken dish which my son described as bland and eatable.

I ordered a diet coke and everyone else had water .

In this day and age I feel it‚Äôs disgraceful to serve up second rate food and charge the max price for it.

We won‚Äôt be back.",1,2022,03,29
223,Lovely D15 Hotel,"The Castleknock Hotel is a lovely hotel and a great spot to meet family and friends for coffee and snacks. Lots of free parking and lovely grounds. Had coffee in the lobby there yesterday. One of my daughters who lives close by, brings her children swimming in the pool there, it‚Äôs a great amenity for locals.",4,2022,03,27
223,Nice hotel,"I wasn‚Äôt very impressed with all the extra changes they implement on their ‚Äòfree breakfast‚Äô having to pay extra for hot beverages is very distasteful. Didn‚Äôt expect that and the server was rude too. Aside that it was a nice stay 
I appreciated the lovely card and chocolate treats in the room ",3,2022,03,23
223,Birthday present,"Booked the spa package with afternoon tea for my mothers birthday, without doubt the best spa experience and afternoon tea we have had in a long time, staff were exceptionally friendly and really looked after my mother, the sandwiches and cakes were amazing and presented beautifully, the staff that served us in the restaurant were very obliging and friendly, hope to return very soon,  keep up the good work",4,2022,03,20
223,Average,"Staff were really nice. 
Food not great in 22 bar, better in the Earth & Vine restaurant.
Hairdryer cold, took forever and still had damp hair. 
Rooms could do with a fix up.
Don‚Äôt normally complain but we were disappointed to be honest. ",3,2022,03,20
223,Fantastic stay.. ,"Booked with Valerie in reservations who very efficient and responded quickly to my request. 
Stayed for three days.
Its been a long time since we I last stayed. Martin met us at the hotel door and made us feel immediately welcome. He is a great character and a fantastic person to welcome guests. 
We stayed in room 280. Nice big cosy bed with a lovely view of golf course. We opted not to have our room serviced but Housekeeping were attentive every morning. Alexander was very friendly and helpful.
Breakfast was very good. Plenty of selection and quick service.
We had three dinners included in our package and enjoyed everything. Especially enjoyed the fish and chip and lemon posset.
We enjoyed the music by Noel and John on St Patrick's night and also Ger who played after them. Both were very good. 
The staff in the hotel are super friendly. A special mention to the Food and Beverage team in no 22 - Oliver, Raol, Fiona, Georgia, Cormac and Cian.
All a credit to the hotel. Very friendly, helpful and made our stay really enjoyable.
We walked into Blanchardstown shopping centre. So many parks to walk beside the hotel.
Unfortunately the spa was booked out and we didn't go to the pool, but will on next visit.
I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Castleknock.. 
Ten out of ten!! 
Thanks to all the team for a lovely stay

223,Special Occasion,"¬†¬∑¬†We were very disappointed that we didn't get the suit that we booked back in Jan as it was a special time for us both (engagement and joint 30th) and that room would have made our stay that little extra specia",4,2022,03,20
223,Amazing stay at Castleknock!,"Me and my boyfriend decided to stay for 2 nights on paddy‚Äôs long weekend for a little break.

I‚Äôd like to start by saying how friendly and helpful all of the staff are, as we walked in to the hotel we were greeted and told where the pool, spa, bar and restaurants were.

When we went to check in we had a lovely lady tell us absolutely everything we needed to know and all of the info was on a sheet of paper which was super helpful!

The room was absolutely gorgeous, spacious and had the most beautiful view. I was so happy to see we had a Nespresso machine, a Dyson hair dryer and the plugs had integrated USB ports, such little details that just make it so much better.

The pool was possibly my favourite part of this place.
The jacuzzi was absolutely magnificent and right in between the sauna and steam room, I spent a lot of time lounging on the sun chairs and reading my book, the weather was beautiful the last few days and the sun shon through the big windows right onto me, I genuinely felt as though I was on a sunny holiday.

Both restaurants and breakfast were exceptional. We had the breakfast included in our stay and we were so happy with all of the options, the pancake machine was my favourite! The first night we stayed we had dinner in the 22 Bar and Restaurant. The pizza was so tasty!! The 2nd night we went to the Earth and Vine restaurant and it was AMAZING! We are vegetarians and we were so happy to see that there is a whole vegetarian and vegan menu. The food was beautiful, we ate every last bite and our waitress (Caoimhe) was so accommodating and kind. 

We will 100% be staying here again. :))",5,2022,03,18
223,Ms,Had Jennifer attend us in  lobby  area where we were seated for drinks She was extremely busy with many requests but  couldn't do enough for us..she was extremely pleasant and friendly at all times and always courteous,4,2022,03,18
223,Lovely weekend stay,"We were attending a wedding about 30-mins south of the hotel. The carpark was thankfully free of charge, and we always got a space near the entrance which was handy. Staff were ever so polite and helpful - full of charm. The room was spacious and comfortable, although beginning to show signs of age, but no big issue for us. The breakfast was fantastic. Serviced buffet with a good selection of cooked hot food and continental. The swimming pool, you cannot enter without a swimming cap (3 EUR). The steam room was poor. Wasn't very steamy and actually one of the worst I've experienced because of that. But overall, an extremely pleasant hotel, full of families.",5,2022,03,15
223,Customer Service Feedback,"2nd time staying, first time bringing our kids. Amazing experience once again. Definitely out favourite hotel to say in. However two marks removed for the  male waiter serving our breakfast. We were greeted at the entrance by a lovely woman, brought to our seats. The male waiter came over and not as much as a smile or even a good morning or hello. We ordered two lattes, more than happy to pay the extra for them. They came 10-15 minutes later. The waiter gave us the option of pay now or after our breakfast, we decided after. The waiter continuesly came over asking us to pay, while still eating. He came over 5 times while we were not finished. The moment my partner got up to get something for our one year old, he came straight over trying to take my partners plate before she finished. We eventually just asked for the card machine to pay. As we were leaving I said goodbye, he did not reply. Honorable mention to the rest of the staff. Especially the waitress that wasn't serving us at breakfast but did come over to say hello to our one and three year old. ",5,2022,03,15
223,Very nice quality hotel,"Excellent hotel in a quiet area, lovely food and a quality spa with facilities. The only downside for me is that it‚Äôs around 20 minutes drive into Dublin centre from the hotel but if you want to be away from all the busyness of the town centre then this is perfect for you. It has a golf course as well but we didn‚Äôt use that",5,2022,03,14
223,Great experience,Lovely hotel with amazing friendly staff. The food in the 22 Bar & Restaurant was very good and relaxing. Our room was clean and very comfortable. We were so happy with our stay I have rebooked to go back in May ,5,2022,03,12

223,Catch up night out,"We had a lovely stay in the hotel, food was very good.  Room very clean and comfortable.  Staff were very friendly.  The only issue we had was there was a wedding in the hotel, which was great for them delighted.  We were situated on the 1st floor and this was directly above the wedding.  We could hear the music in our room till 2pm.  The noise on the corridors went on till after 4am, banging on doors, shouting etc.  If you are staying at the weekends I would suggest you ask for a room on the 2nd floor and not the 1st floor were our room was.",4,2022,03,07
223,Friendly; excellent food; nice beers,"Stay was booked for us by a motor club we were providing a service for nearby the following day.

223,Wedding guests,"Lovely hotel.and really nice staff. Very clean. Check in is a little late, 4pm! Check in queue was very long. Not sure if this is down to lack of staff too. Could improve on this. Food was lovely Overall a very comfortable stay. ",4,2022,03,07
223,Enjoyable stay,Myself & my husband were gifted an overnight stay here whicjh included a bottle of Prosecco & chocolates. We had a very enjoyable stay here. I had a massage in the spa & we both used the leisure centre. Rooms had everything in them that you would need & the fridge was an added bonus. We had dinner in the 22 restaurant service was a bit slow but we were in no hurry. Overall a very pleasant stay & we would definitely return. ,4,2022,03,05
223,Pleasant stay,"The staff at this hotel are all lovely, very friendly and helpful, however for the price paid we expected a better stay. We had opted for a superior room, where we found a broken safe and a broken nespresso machine, which once fixed we were not left any coffee pods for. The pool is used by the public for children swimming lessons so be mindful of this when choosing what time to visit. Dinner in the 22 bar restaurant was average, a couple of large sticks of rosemary stalk were found in our salad which we then didn‚Äôt eat as the waiter couldn‚Äôt tell at the time what they were or if it was safe to be eaten, to be told they are used in the kitchen on steaks so not sure why they were in the salad - no offer of a different dish / compensation for not being able to eat it. Transport to town on bus / train is easy enough, roughly 45 mins door to door, staff were helpful at telling us how to get there.",3,2022,03,05
223,Wedding ,"We had a fantastic day with at the Castleknock Hotel. Plenty of positives and a special mention to Louise and Andrew who were  truely fantastic.

223,Meh,"Hotel is a furnace. You have to pay extra to not be a sweaty mess in their deluxe air con rooms.

223,Short break away just outside Dublin city center,"Just wanted a night away the two of us. Food was beautiful, staff were friendly. Pool area was busy with kids on midterm from North, but hotel had a curfew of 6pm at the pool for kids which we felt was fair. ",5,2022,02,20

223,"Warm welcome, Good accommodation, Good pool & Spa, Superb service, Great food","Having stayed in this hotel over many years on business I started to use it for family breaks as well and now I find myself back with family and grandchildren.

We have just returned from a 3 day/2 night half term break as a party of 6 adults, 2 children & 2 babies across 3 rooms.
The family rooms were spacious with a double and single bed and a travel cot provided.
My wife and I had a lovely double room overlooking the lake onto the golf course.

The excellent customer focused attention by the reservations department made the booking arrangements so easy and everything was just as requested.
The reception staff ensure a warm welcome and the actual check-in experience was made all the more simple by adequate communication in advance of our stay to facilitate on-line check-in.

The hotel has 2 restaurant options but we chose to eat in their Bar 22 bistro on both nights. The menu afforded enough options that even though we dined there on both nights we were still able to have enough choice to allow us to eat different food each night. 
Restaurant reputations rise or fall by the quality of the food but even more importantly by the level of customer service diners experience. We couldnt speak highly enough of our experience on both of these.  The provision of a table for 8 plus 2 high chairs did not present any problems with a good childrens menu and a childrens buffet. The restaurant staff were, friendly, professional yet engaging and interacted with adults & children alike which was really appreciated.

We used the swimming pool on all 3 days and the childrens area was ideal for our grandchildren ranging in age from 9 months to 4 years.

There are ample spaces for coffee or after dinner drinks including the Lime Tree Bar. There is also a heated terrace but on our visit the weather was such that inside was definitely the better option.

It was long faces all round when it came to check out time but we are already checking diary dates for another visit.
Its a bit like visiting your grannies......you are warmly greeted, spoilt while you stay and when you leave you cant wait until its time to return again.",5,2022,02,20
223,Dont waste your money,we were left waiting 2 and a half hours on mains and constantly ignored by staff in the restaurant also breakfast was 2 hours late which left us waiting around the management did try resolving it but of course it would require us spending more money so we wont be back again.,2,2022,02,18

223,Valentines at castle knock,"I am absolutely delighted to chose to stay for the two nights we got a great deal including both dinners and breakfasts as well as two bottles of Prosecco and chocolate strawberries, every thing was perfect we really enjoyed the live music and use of the pool. The food and drinks were absolutely unreal but drinks are a bit pricey if on a budget. The room was perfect only thing to say is not much for young people do ro during the day unless you‚Äôre leaving hotel to go somewhere ",5,2022,02,17
223,Lovely stay,"Recently stayed for 3 nights with children aged 16,12 and 5. The hotel was lovely and clean with plenty of sanitizer available in various locations. The kids enjoyed the pool with different depths available for various abilities. The family room was a good size with a king size bed and 3 singles, however the soft furnishings were very dated and stained in places. The room overlooked a beautiful lake and golf course and contained a mini fridge which was useful. The breakfast was lovely with something for everyone including a pancake machine which the children loved. We dined in Bar 22 twice which had a limited menu and the food was just ok. On 2 days we walked to the nearest train station,Coolmine which is a 20 min walk, and travelled into Dublin which was handy. All in all it was a nice hotel and I‚Äôd definitely return.",4,2022,02,17

Spa was amazing and breakfast was full of variety and good quality",5,2022,02,16
223,"delightful, with great amosphere","we had a valentines day dinner. it was an incredible experience. we did not look much into the menu so everything that was delivered to us felt like a surprise. we both ordered starters, mains and deserts. between each dish, there was something small given to us, whether be it lemon sorbet or some sort of pate. each complimented the following dish. there was also complementary tea and coffee and a glass of prosecco. Not to forget to mention, a lovely rose for the lady.

Our waitress for that evening was as good as they get. Mihaela. Nor was she intrusive, nor was she too hard to reach for a refill. She was also great to talk to in between dishes. 10/10

Overall, great experience. definitively will return in the near future.",5,2022,02,15
223,Hotel ambience issue,"The overall impression is a hotel lacking a defined theme or ambience.
You are presented with an open seated area as you walk in with TV screens showing sport to people seated and attended by floor staff - all well and good until 9pm.
Beyond this and through a figurative open metal partition is the 22 Bara & Restaurant dining area;  any attempt there while dining to hear or talk to your partner is shattered at 9pm by the music (acoustic guitar & singer) that takes over at the position a television/projector normally is in place.
What's wrong with some relaxing ambient music, with the emphasis on ambient and background as people have to talk louder when they can't hear themselves - it seems so pointless and counter-productive otherwise.
I assume eating in the Earth and Vine restaurant would have afforded more calmness  but why the added premium to avoid the extra volume generated by the multi-themed bar, restaurant, music loudly playing, plus people talking ever loudly to overcome all this. 
To be honest the guitarist wasn't as bad as the din produced by a previous guitarist we heard when we stayed there in Sept '21
I've stayed there twice, and both times in Deluxe double rooms,  the previous time we stayed on the ground floor pass the entrance to the chlorine-scented area for leisure pool access. - if you're not into chlorine, it' can be a little jolting to the sense of smell on your way to your room.
Castleknock Hotel seems or wants to be everything  to everybody: local pub, sports bar ( golf on the TV) , music venue, swimming pool, cocktail bar, leisure spa, & this all happening as you clear the reception area. Maybe demarcated areas would be better with some partitions used appropriately to dampen sound as open plan is not really working.",4,2022,02,15
223,Amazing as per usual. Friendly and professional staff who go above and beyond to make your experience special.,Amazing as per usual.

On entering our room we were greeted with an anniversary ballon and a bottle of prosecco. We had dinner in the bar both nights. The staff went above and beyond for us, even presenting us with a complimentary anniversary plate for dessert. All the facilities, gym and pool, were immaculate and open well into the evening. We would be happy to recommend this hotel and will 100% return :)",5,2022,02,14

223,Sunday night stay.,Stayed here end of January for a Sunday night away. Nice welcome and good atmosphere for the most part. Bit of a rough crowd hanging around drinking that seemed to intimidate other guests. Good value for the deal we got and our meal was nice. Young waiter in the restaurant was spot on with everything. Had to go to the bar a few times ourselves for drinks despite service staff standing around but that‚Äôs not their fault. Room was nice. Breakfast was bad cold and tasteless. Overall it was an okay stay. Have enjoyed better for less cost.,3,2022,02,07

223,Lovely hotel,"We have stayed here several,times and also come for lunch regularly.  The patio area is wonderful,in the summer overlooking the golf course, you feel miles away from Dublin.

The rooms are great, everything you  need for a comfortable stay.  Service is excellent.  We met Andrew the bar/restaurant manager who was so welcoming and helpful.",5,2022,01,22
223,Fab,"We stayed here on a Monday and Tuesday night and from the minute we walked in everything was fabulous.  Claudine greeted us at the door and took all the usual covid details but had a laugh with us straight away. We were able to check in hour early and the room was beautiful. Had dinner in the 22 restaurant that evening and then drinks in the lobby. Our server Jennifer was an absolute credit to the hotel, I was a little fussy with my cocktail order and she didn't even bat an eyelid, just made sure that it was okay for me. Pool was lovely. Overall, fantastic experience and would 100 percent recommend to anyone",5,2022,01,20
223,An option if you want a hotel in a green area not too far from Dublin.,"It is a big and busy hotel overlooking a golf course and in one of the greener and richer suburbs of Dublin.

The facilities were fine, the kids enjoyed the indoorpool and I was happy with the gym too.

The food was fine, no complaints there. The only issue we had here was the fact that they did not clean our room and we had to argue with reception to make sure it was taken care off. 

We used Uber drivers to go to Dublin and that went fine.

The hotel is an option if you want to be close to, but not in Dublin center.",3,2022,01,19
223,Fabulous spa package,"We had a lovely stay in the Castleknock Hotel! We were on a spa package with dinner and hot stone massage and it was absolutely amazing.

Starting with check in, Agnes was very helpful and informed us about everything we should know. The room itself was lovely with a nice view over the green area.

The spa experience was very good, we were able to have the massage in couples room which only enhanced the experience.

The package dinner options were kept short but there was a little bit of everything to choose from, fish and chips was absolutely delicious! 

Cormac, the waiter was really helpful and attentive, he recommended a daily speciality drink which was called ""Chai me a river"" and it was delicious! 

I highly recommend this hotel and the spa package.",5,2022,01,19
223,Night Away - Kid Free!!,"We had a lovely stay on Sunday night, we went on a package that include a 3 course meal so could not fault the value, I have a remaining ‚Ç¨50 voucher to use and I will put it towards the same package in the near future.

Andrew served us and was very helpful and accommodating in the bar, hotel was spotless, good choice for breakfast and there was a good atmosphere around the place on Sunday.

We'll be back soon.",5,2022,01,19
223,Pleasant Stay with really good food & drink.,"Very clean and comfortable, we really enjoyed our stay, covid guidelines were in place. The dinner we had  & breakfast the next morning was delicious. Vegetarian options too. Louise at the front desk was really accommodating and answered all of our questions. The robes provided for the swimming pool could be bigger but that‚Äôs all.",5,2022,01,18
223,Couples break ,"Just back from our third stay at this hotel, always have a very enjoyable and relaxing stay, thanks to  the friendly staff in all areas, always smiling and welcoming!  Great food, lovely restaurant and seating areas, and great pool, I would highly recommend the Castleknock Hotel ",5,2022,01,18
223,Weekend break,"Weekend break away for our anniversary. Jnr Suite was quite basic, that was the only down side from an otherwise excellent stay. Staff very helpful and couldn't do enough for you. Felt very safe with Covid 19 controls. Got very busy around the Jacuzzi and steam rooms but you just had to stay away during the peak times. The restaurant service and food very good.   ",4,2022,01,18
223,Outstanding,"All round great experience. Hotel is fantastic, staff are brilliant and facilities are to die for. If your looking for a relaxing stay then I can't recommend this hotel enough, we will definitely be returning, hopefully with a round of golf next time.",5,2022,01,18
223,Celebrating with friends,"This is a beautiful hotel with friendly helpful staff. Very spacious, plenty of room for everyone. A nice mix of age groups and a good buzz about the place.  The room had everything we needed and was clean and comfortable.  We all enjoyed our meals and  we loved the swimming pool / sauna. I will definitely go back to the Castleknock Hotel.",5,2022,01,17
223,Lovely hotel,My mum and I started over for one night in January this year. Hotel is lovely and staff are very friendly. We both got spa treatments from Elena and Katie and they were both super friendly and professional. Food is amazing and are big portions. We got breakfast to the room and asked for between 10-10.30 and it arrived at 10am on the dot which was amazing! We tried the pool at about 10.30 and was asked to come back as 10-11 is their busiest time for children. Unfortunately we didn‚Äôt get to use it before check out which was disappointing but overall the stay was lovely. Would stay again and highly recommend.,4,2022,01,16
223,Great hotel and good value,"Great hotel for a family stay or to meet up for work / social. Very clean hotel and good adherence to covid protocol which is reassuring. Beautiful seating areas both in the foyer where there is a coffee dock selling amazing coffee but also the bar, restaurant and terrace. Hotel would benefit from a proper lunch menu though.
Our room was spacious, plenty of space to accommodate our travel cot. Also plenty of space to put your belongings. Staff were very friendly and accommodating. I didn‚Äôt use the pool myself but my husband did and he thought it was nice. He also used the gym and was very impressed with it, lots of space and equipment to use, even battle ropes which you don‚Äôt often find in hotel gyms. My husband has stayed in the Clayton hotel in Liffey valley recently and said this hotel is much better.",4,2022,01,15
223,A beautiful stay,"I would highly recommend the Castleknock Hotel. Beautiful hotel, very covid compliant. The staff were so lovely and helpful. The food was just amazing!! If you're a fan of chicken wings then enjoy.. 10/10.. we will be back ",5,2022,01,14
223,Stay,"Excellent experience.
Staff were amazing.
Food abs drinks were great.
We had a very pleasant experience from staff when the tv in our room wasn‚Äôt working , very kind gentleman with glasses upgraded our room and kept checking on us to make sure we were enjoying ourselves.
All the staff were so kind and helpful.
Room was very clean and quiet.
Will definitely be coming back again!",5,2022,01,14
223,Canadian family trip,"This Hotel is kid friendly more than any other Hotel we have stayed in . Kids menu.  Vegan menu.  Outdoor playground. 
 The pool and Gym were fantastic.  Food was great but the coffee is terrible and over priced . Andrew the food and beverage  manager was just fantastic.  Great with kids . 3 golf courses within 5min . Local pubs close and a few shops . Local bus 4min walk that can take you directly to the city 20min . Train is 8min walk and takes 20 min to Connolly station . ",5,2022,01,09
223,Worth the money,"Recommended place for staycation in Dublin. The food is really delicious and a must try. The only down side is rooms are quite small and there's no toothbrush and toothpaste provided so make sure to bring your own. In our case, we only have our toothbrush and didn't bother to bring a toothpaste as we were expecting they will provide it.",4,2022,01,08
223,Overnight stay,"Love staying in this hotel, even though we are local.   We stayed for one night this week.    Bedroom was very clean and comfortable.  Staff friendly and efficient.   Ate in 22 Bar and and Restaurant, food was gorgeous...no complaints at all.   Were served by a waiter called Cormac who was friendly, attentive and efficient.  Looking forward to returning again soon!   ",5,2022,01,08
223,afternoon tea,"Myself and my family had the upmost pleasure of having afternoon tea in castleknock hotel. It was absolutely gorgeous and the man checking the Covid certs at the door was so very friendly and welcoming. He was an absolute pleasure to meet walking in. He really set the mood for the afternoon ahead of us. We also had a waitress named Orla. She was the bubbliest, most friendly waitress Iv ever met. She made the rest of the afternoon so perfect for us. She went above and beyond to make us feel so welcome. She was always at hand for anything we needed. She really is a credit to to the hotel and when I return again I hope to have orla there to make our visit just as enjoyable as yesterday. The  staff really do make the hotel what it is. They are a massive credit to the hotel. They brought our new year such a lovely start. My mother passed away from Covid on the 1st of December and Christmas and new year was very hard for us. She was only 66 with no underlying conditions are we have been completely heart broken over her. The staff and their warmth towards us will never be forgotten. They had no idea about what we are going through and just being so kind, friendly and helpful made a huge difference to our day. The hotel is absolutely gorgeous and peaceful and child friendly. I will be returning again",5,2022,01,06
223,Excellent stay,"You have done a excellent job of training your staff. Keep up the great work. A fabulous stay over, thank you . We will definitely be back for a longer stay to be able to experience all of what this beautiful hotel had to offer. ",5,2022,01,06

223,Incredible hotel - a memorable stay with wonderful staff and gold-standard service,"We have just returned from our mini honeymoon stay at the Castleknock Hotel, where we stayed for three nights over the New Year.

Pros:
- The staff are exceptional, particularly Paula (Duty Manager) who was so attentive from our check-in to check-out and kept treating us to surprises for our honeymoon stay. Paula couldn't do enough for us and genuinely made the stay feel so luxurious - she spoilt us rotten! I understand she is a new staff member, but she was the best by far out of anyone that we had met and her little touches made our stay so memorable. Notably she handled a small issue that we had with above and beyond service. That's the mark of a great hotel and we cannot thank her enough.
- The food in both 22 and Earth and Vine restaurant is delicious. We ate in both and not only was the quality superb, but again the serving staff were so personable and you felt looked after. It would have been even better if the menu had changed a little (especially in Earth and Vine as otherwise it can get a bit same-y after a few nights) but that doesn't dampen the experience at all.
- Suite - we stayed in the Luttrell Suite and it was enormous. We had two big TVs, two sofas, two armchairs, and a dining table, in addition to the Superking bed and en-suite bathroom. My favourite part was the gorgeous views over surrounding Dublin on New Year's Eve, as we had a magical view of the fireworks. Additionally, the rooms feature luxury extras such as a Dyson hairdryer (and the first hotel I have stayed in that included a diffuser attachment!) and Elemis products in the bathroom.
- Safety - the Covid prevention measures here are strict, but for good reason. We felt really safe and respected the measures the hotel had gone to to protect it's staff and guests. 
- Entertainment - the hotel had live music in the very grand lobby every day of our stay and this became one of my favourite parts. The musician was outstanding and could have easily been a recording artist. We really enjoyed having a cocktail (go for the peach bellini, it will not disappoint) and chilling out with the live music. It made the stay so much fun.
- Experience - random comment, but the hotel was fragranced (like apple?) throughout (except in the rooms) and it was a lovely touch that felt so welcoming as you enter the door after a busy day exploring.

Areas for improvement (small, but necessary):
 - We found the new spa brochure and section on the website to be quite misleading. The website seems to suggest that the pool/jacuzzi/hydropool is part of the spa, but it is in fact a separate entity - and the hydropool was not switched on when we visited. It is a space that allows children and looks out on to the playground... not the most relaxing 'spa experience'. Children are not allowed for just two hours per day, but this didn't it our schedule or our dinner plans! It was really loud and we couldn't last more than 10 minutes in there, which was frustrating as we had hoped for a spa stay and had just spent 6 Euros on swimming hats (compulsory in Ireland). To access the spa and the relaxation room, you have to book a treatment, and unfortunately they were fully booked for our stay.
- Restaurant policies, and lack of upholding them: We understand kids being present, particularly in the holidays but on one occasion we literally had to move tables due to kids running loops around the 22 restaurant and bar area and screaming so loudly - no more than 4 inches from our faces, not only was this a nuisance but also not entirely safe as they were unmasked and we are in the height of Omicron. It had gotten really bad that the poor Maitre D' couldn't handle the situation, despite her speaking with parents, and it all just got a bit out of hand. Also, on check-in you are given an info sheet advising a strict smart-casual dress code from 5pm in the restaurants and that you may be refused entry if you did not comply, so we followed suit (no pun intended) but others did not do the same and it was a little disappointing for other guests to wear full tracksuits or football shirts and to be (repeatedly) given a free pass. Whilst the majority of those flouting the policy were teenagers, there were a fair number of adults who were dressed similarly.
- The only other suggested improvement would be to include conditioner with the shampoo in bathrooms (as we had to go out and buy some) and to include shower gel/shampoo next to the bath in the bathroom, as otherwise you have to awkwardly get out and take from from the fixed unit in the standalone shower when having a bath.",5,2022,01,06
223,Comfort & how to deal with a problem,"Reception / rooms / facilities excellent
Issue with a disingenuous staff member but it was dealt with swiftly and satisfactorily.
CoVID times the safety and cleanliness was evident. It was our wedding anniversary and the hotel acknowledged this. ",4,2022,01,06
223,1 night stay,"We stayed for one night over Christmas for a little break. Hotel facilities were very good, room was well equipped and very comfortable and good leisure facilities. We were just disappointed with the Earth and Vine restaurant. The food quality was average and definitely not fine dining and the service was quite poor. Other than that we very much enjoyed our stay. ",4,2022,01,06
223,The Castleknock Rocks,"What a wonderful New Year spent at this hotel.  The staff are its jewel, from the door staff who checked our Covid Certs, to reception, to bar to cleaners, all friendly and accommodating.  I would definitely recommend this hotel.  ",5,2022,01,04
223,Castleknock h√¥tel,Had a fabulous stay at the castleknock Hotel. Great food from afternoon tea & dinner to breakfast and rooms top class. The service  is second to none. All staff so helpful. I would really recommend it. I can't wait to return.,5,2022,01,04
223,At the top of their game,"This hotel is at the top of its game.
From the moment you arrive, the covid ambassador opens the door for you. I don't know his name but he was working at arrival yesterday evening Jan 1st and this morning Jan 2nd. He was positive, upbeat, engaging and funny.. And he set the tone for our stay. Check in was organised and efficient. The room, exec double was immaculate from the standard sized cups (I hate small cups in hotels) to the biscuits and sign advising to ask for fresh milk if you prefer. Bath robes, bed was huge and a nice view. Nice decor for a comfy stay. The only complaint is the seals on the windows need looking at. Noise and draught but heavy curtains to help. We used the pool, steam room and jacuzzi, all immaculate and a great feature. We had dinner in the bar (inclusive menu) .. The wings were the best I've had, fish and chips and my partner had steak.. All delicious and the atmosphere and look of the bar are fantastic. With bar food that good, why would you upgrade to the restaurant?! Dessert.. The brownie, sensational. Portion sizes were absolutely spot on. We had a Guinness and cocktail.. Both beautiful. The hotel is very organised with wrist bands to identify those who can stay past 8pm. This stops you being constantly asked if you're resident post 8pm whilst you move around the hotel. It's a great idea! Busy hotel but plenty of space and segmented well. The detail in the hotel is fantastic from the logo on cups, to every staff member greeting you with a smile when they see you, staff were impeccably dressed. They were all so professional and organised and despite the night costing 345 including dinner which was steep enough, the detail made it value for money. If castleknock Hotel read this, give your covid ambassador some acknowledgement, he's a credit to you. Your hotel is stunning. Despite living nearby we felt we were away. We'll be back!",5,2022,01,04
223,Great hotel,"This is the second time we stayed at this hotel and it didn't disappoint either time. We were very impressed with the professionalism and friendlessness of the staff.

The facilities were excellent and the Covid precautions were impressive",5,2022,01,01

223,Lockdown Spa treat,"A first-time visit made to a very high standard of hotel, we came on our wedding anniversary and hope to return in the near future.

The environment was spotless and we made good use of the excellent indoor leisure facilities including health spa and pool. ",5,2021,12,30
223,Lovely Stay,"Hotel is fabulous, all the staff were so friendly and attentive‚Ä¶ rooms are lovely would definitely recommend to family and friends.

",4,2021,12,29
223,Would highly recommend,The staff were so friendly and helpful.  Loved the stickers on the bedroom doors to indicate that it was deep cleaned and it only came apart when door was opened.

The bedroom was lovely and very clean with a little box of complimentary chocolates, would definitely stay again",5,2021,12,11
223,service wasn‚Äôt great,"my mother and i visited this hotel a few days ago for a festive time and afternoon tea. we were greeted nicely and allowed to sit wherever we liked. my first complaint is that all though  children were supposed to be supervised at all times, there were numerous occasions that they were not. the second thing i have to mention is that i ordered a hot chocolate and a brownie and my mother ordered an americano and apple tart. first of all, the waitress gave me sugar cubes with my hot chocolate (???) those don‚Äôt belong with hot chocolate. second of all, when my mother asked the waitress if her tart was heated it wasn‚Äôt and when she left to heat it up, she didn‚Äôt bring the plate with her. she forgot it. so second of all, there was no cream with our pastries and when we asked for some , we were told that the kitchen was closed (???) and we couldn‚Äôt get any. the kitchen was clearly open as we could see people getting served hot food in the restaurant. we asked for a discount and she reluctantly said she would give us one, when we eventually went to pay, luckily that same waitress wasn‚Äôt the one serving us again. it was a young man who was far more on the ball and wanting us to have a good stay. he gave us a discount with no problems and apologized profusely making me think maybe it was just this one incompetent waitress damaging the hotels reputation and not the hotel overall being a bad place to stay.",3,2021,12,09
223,Amazing hotel,Amazing hotel. The cleanliness and safety procedures during these times were 5*. The food is gorgeous and all the staff were so nice and helpful.  Our family room was absolutely amazing . A safe easy trip with no worries ,5,2021,12,08
223,Night Away,Overall a lovely hotel. Would be great for a family get away. I would prefer if changing area for spa was separate as quite loud and takes away from relaxing feel. Loads of sitting areas and good selection of food. We did not book restaurant in time but outdoor areas can be used at any time. Quick and staff were lovely.  ,4,2021,12,07
223,"Beautiful hotel, super friendly staff and fabulous swimming pool!","Highly recommend the Castleknock hotel. Beautiful surroundings, so festive for Christmas, staff were exceptionally friendly and facilitated our very late check-in due to delayed arrival time with no fuss. Lovely kids‚Äô packs in the room and the swimming pool is so impressive.

We‚Äôll definitely be back. ",5,2021,12,05
223,Festive break,Christmas overnight break.  Everything was just perfect. Staff very friendly. Hotel looking lovely and festive. Spotlessly clean  the leisure centre was lovely and the steam room and sauna were really hot at 7 am! Service was excellent. Loved it!!! ,5,2021,12,05
223,Welcoming friendly staff ,The staff at the hotel were so welcoming and friendly from the moment we checked in. The room was lovely and not overheated like most rooms.

Would really recommend this hotel for a family stay. The little welcome pack thrilled my kids. ,5,2021,12,03
223,Five Star,"I enjoyed a one night stay at the Castleknock Hotel. The hotel exceeded my expectations. The standards and quality of this hotel are excellent. The price was very fair as my standard room was large, comfortable and very luxurious. I ate in the bar area during my stay. This is an informal dining/bar area which suited my needs perfectly. The food was of excellent standard - great quality/choice for the price. The atmosphere in the hotel was jovial with a lovely pre-Christmas buzz. All Covid guidelines were in place and adhered to by hardworking staff. The staff are an asset to this hotel, hardworking, professional, courteous and friendly. I will be recommending the Castleknock Hotel to colleagues, friends and family. Thank you to the Management and staff for a wonderful stay x",5,2021,12,03

223,Girlfriends Birthday!,"Stayed here Last Thursday for my Girlfriends birthday and to say I'm in the good books for the next while is an understatement! From the moment you arrive at this place you are left in awe, as you drive in the lights are spectacular! 

We arrived quite late and went straight to The Restaurant for Dinner. Dinner was sublime, I had the chicken wings to start, The Steak for Main, and my missus had the Carbonara. Honestly guys we were stuffed after 2 courses, but the deserts just finished us off! Enjoyed 2 beautiful cocktails as well before heading to bed!

I'd like to thank the staff of the hotel for arranging A Beautiful Bouquet of Flowers for herself, along with chocolate coated strawberries in the room. Bed very comfy, and the next morning when we woke up you can really appreciate the insane views over the golf course. 

The Next Morning for breakfast, again superb food, beautiful poached eggs with full buffet and continental options. We honestly didn't want to check out and wished it could've been longer! We'll be Back! Thanks Guys!",5,2021,11,29

223,Excellent hotel,"Having stayed in many Dublin hotels previously, we had never considered being so far from the city centre.  However, golf brought us here, to Castleknock.  Whilst the building isn‚Äôt very pleasing from the outside, it makes up for it indoors.  The foyer, bar and restaurant are beautiful.  The food is excellent and the staff are great.  Our room was great also.  We would definitely consider staying here again, with or without golf clubs.",4,2021,11,26

223,Nice meal in safe surroundings,Had dinner last Friday. Nice to see strict covid regulations adhered to so felt very safe. Nice addition of covered over area outdoors and heated . Lovely cocktails to start. Dinner was very nice but I will say it's expensive even for hotel prices 17/18 for regular pizza.  Had sharing platter to start Nice mix of meat and cheeses and no problem asking for more bread . Felt was slightly understaffed in restaurants hard to get someone attention but when you did good service.  Had the Indian curry for mains which was lovely..Nice buzz about the place very much a mix of couples families girlie nights and a next day wedding party . Was a guy singing Iive music and as much as it was  brill to hear actually singing again he wasn't the best sorry ..,4,2021,11,21

223,First time guests,This was the first time we stayed in CastleKnock and I certainly hope there will be many more. The staff are so friendly it‚Äôs spotlessly clean breakfast is amazing.  This hotel has a lovely atmosphere throughout.  We did not use the Spa or pool.  I think the hotel is reasonably priced. ,5,2021,11,03
223,Fabulous Hotel tucked away in West Dublin. close to Airport with amazing spa for good measure.,"Sharon and I booked a one night B&B and evening dinner at Casteknock Hotel as a way to end our holiday on a high as we stayed there on our return from two weeks in Turkey....and boy Castleknock delivered. A BIG comfy bed and great bar and dining....breakfast on Sunday was a high light and back then to home...cannot recommend highly enough, every member of staff we interacted with were soo helpful , we'll be back..",5,2021,11,02
223,"Gorgeous surroundings, very comfortable, excellent food and the friendliest staff you could hope to meet!",Stayed for two nights while attending a family wedding. The hotel is set in lovely grounds with a spa and golf course. The accommodation is very comfortable. We stayed in a superior twin. Two restaurants and a patisserie in the foyer. Excellent food and loads of it. But the best bit of the hotel is the staff. They are all so friendly and nothing us too much trouble. Would love to stay again.,5,2021,11,02
223,One night stay in Castleknock Hotel,"Thoroughly enjoyed the stay. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The standard is high and despite being very busy, we were looked after very well. The room was lovely and food was very tasty. Great selection for breakfast.",5,2021,11,01
223,Afternoon Tea,It was not the first experience in this hotel and definitely not the last one. My mom was visiting us for a week and I decided to book an afternoon tea to offer her the experience of comfort and love. The customer service up to a high standard. Ileana she took care of us and she showed professionalism and love. We will sure be back for another taste of Castleknock Hotel!!!,5,2021,10,31
223,Bar 22 castleknock hotel,"Was welcomed by lovely receptionist. Prompt check in. Covid compliant. Rooms average but very clean . Had a reasonable lunch in bar 22. However same could not be said for the dinner. We were told at check in that we did not have to book a table if we were dining in the bar only the restaurant. When we approached the girl at the check in desk at the bar for dinner she told us that there were no tables available and they would not have any till 21:30. The bar was half empty at this stage. Explained to her we were told we didn‚Äôt need to book and she said we shouldn‚Äôt of been told that as it was not the case. There was a colleague standing beside her who then offered to check if there were any tables available, which of course there was and she told us to pick a table to sit at (since there were so many available) ordered drinks and food which was again average. While waiting for the food a manager was passing by and I spoke to him to give him feedback about what had happened. He was dismissive and rude about the situation and also said that wasn‚Äôt the case. All mentioned could of been forgotten about, however after I spoke to the manager it was evident that he had spoken to the waiting staff about the situation, however this had a negative impact as it was obvious that the staff were going out of their way to ignore us and avoiding our table which changed the whole atmosphere of the night and ruined our experience.",2,2021,10,31
223,Castleknock Hotel,"We had a wonderful stay at Castleknock Hotel. We were left waiting for our room when checking in, which wasn't great.
Highly recommend, very good food (buffet for children, great idea) & service excellent! ",4,2021,10,29
223,Good place for a short Family break.,"Enjoyed staying in the Castleknock Hotel for three nights, half board.

Found the hotel very clean and staff couldn't be nicer at all times.

Found the Breakfast menu basic but good,  although some things like yogurts, pancakes and croissants when they ran out where not replaced. The menu is both the main Restaurant and Bar where very tasty but they do need updating as had we had been staying another night the menus would have got boring.

The room we had was a family room which was very clean and modern, the mattresses where poor, having sore backs wasn't a good way to start our day.

It was great to have music in Bar where kids could be kids and a lovely warm swimming pool was perfect.

Will definitely be back.",4,2021,10,28

",3,2021,10,19
223,Mrs,"For the last two evenings we have been served by a young man called Eoin (earth & Vine) - what a delightful person he is - nothing was too much trouble for him and that is really saying something as we are a party of six ladies and can be very demanding (in a nice way)

We are very well travelled and stayed in some of the best hotels in the world over years with fantastic service but the service we have received from Eoin was exceptional. 

And to think this hotel is on our doorstep with amazing staff makes us proud, we shall certainly come back. 

 Anna  &  Friends",5,2021,10,19

223,Fantastic hotel,"We had a really fabulous stay at this hotel. Beautiful room overlooking golf course. General Manager and staff amazing, particularly Andrew on the front desk who contacted a member of his family to help with a query re blue badge parking in Dublin. Truly memorable experience - thanks to everyone at Castleknock Hotel.",5,2021,10,10
223,Fantastic hotel,"Just back from a two night stay. Throughout our stay every member of staff we interacted with were super friendly and had great customer service. Room was spotless and reception give you all the info u need on the new ways during covid. Hotel is large but plenty of space to sit and sip on a cocktail in a quiet corner we never found it noisy or busy maybe because we were there mid week . Food was very good, breakfast was well run and had lots of choice loved the mini pastries. We had a snack tray delivered to room as part of our deal would highly recommend this. 
The hotel is a little out of the centre but a taxi ride to Dublin Zoo was 15 euros and then a short walk to the start of the luas line. We didn't make use of the spa or pool but will definitely be returning to this hotel.",5,2021,10,08
223,Fantastic Hotel & Spa!!!,"What a beautiful hotel in every way! So friendly & welcoming with lovely staff and brillant facilities. Had the most amazing facial and massage with Fezi, cant wait to come back and have another. Great food, lovely clean & spacious rooms and such a warm Irish welcome...i would reccomend this hotel highly!!",5,2021,10,07
223,Fabulous hotel,"We really enjoyed our stay at Castleknock Hotel, the hotel is beautiful, the food is excellent, we could not fault our dinner or breakfast, the pastries are amazing at breakfast! Cocktails/drinks pricey but really good. Location is lovely. Highly recommend.  ",5,2021,10,06
223,Wonderful stay,"We had a wonderful 4 night stay. The staff was so professional and  helpful. It was very family friendly. The breakfast was exceptionally well ran & enjoyable. The supervisor couldn't have been more helpful.  Food wss good with 4 different areas.  Cocktails were superb and make it perfect place for celebration. They also had libe music which was so great to hear after Covid restrictions. 
 The location was great for us visiting friends in Dublin 15 but wouldn't be convenient for city centre visits if using public transport. 
The only  thing is checkin is quiet late at 4pm and they don't have any early checkin options which isn't ideal if flying in early from US.",5,2021,10,05
223,"A good hotel, not a great hotel","This is a very big hotel.  The bad things - noisy reception area, acoustics terrible, bring your hearing aid, if you've got one, and turn it up.  The whole ground floor is basically all open plan - it sprawls from the front door around reception, lifts, coffee shop, bar, regular restaurant, Earth and Vine restaurant and probably a lot more but we were only there one night so maybe we missed out on other things down there...  There's too much going on, too many people milling around, and it would be hard to find a quiet corner to relax in.  Junior Suite is not worthy of the title - it's just a bigger standard room.  Lime Tree bar is confusing, at least when we were there - someone comes from the restaurant, takes your order and brings your drinks back from the restaurant, even though you're sitting in a fully stocked bar, with two bartenders present! Can't figure it?  Neither could we ... The good things - huge carpark, so no bother finding space, lovely leafy almost rural surroundings in the city, Earth and Vine restaurant is quite good and the waiting staff are its best asset, room very quiet (at least when we were there).  Overall, it's okay value overall for a 4 star hotel.  Good, but not great. ",3,2021,10,04
223,Communion,"I organised a meal for 15 people last Saturday for my sons communion. 7 of us stayed in the Hotel for the weekend including relatives who came from London. It was perfection from start to finish. Everybody had a great time and the meal on Saturday was fabulous. I was a tad fussy with balloons table decor and favours i brought myself ü§£ and our waiters were just brilliant. Nothing was too much for them. Special Thanks to Raul for looking after us all afternoon,  Saturday was the 2nd occasion we had Raul looking after us and he was fantastic on both occasions. We were delighted to have him look after us again on Saturday. Also Thank You to Andrew Sherlock who over saw everything. Andrew was on hand at every turn and the communion celebrations were a huge success. We will all be back !",5,2021,10,04
223,THIS is how a hotel should be run!,"My wife, daughter, granddaughter and I stay in many hotels around Ireland and indeed Europe, but the Irish hotels in general get a lot wrong sadly. 

But NOT the Castleknock Hotel & Spa! We had a 1 night stay (will definitely be back for a longer stay soon) here recently and were extremely impressed with how well the hotel handled many aspects of our stay.
The rooms were clean and spacious. Shower cubicle was a little on the small side being a triangular shape, but I'm really nit picking there..

The main thing we look for in a hotel is for it to live up to its star rating. Many we have stayed in fall well short of this in many aspects. The Castleknock Hotel however for us would be well up to its 4 star rating and possibly even and extra half star again.
The staff were extremely attentive. We sat in the foyer lounge area for a couple of hours before dinner and the waitresses were constantly walking around the tables and chairs with their heads up smiling and waiting for guest drink requests. Not once did I see someone with a hand up to try and get a staff members attention. And every time somebody left a table to go elsewhere in the hotel there was a cleaning member immediately at that table to clean and disinfect (Covid measures well catered for) the area.
We ate in the restaurant and had paid slightly extra for a better menu. All our food came out in a timely manner. Sadly, my fish came out and was a little on the dry side as it may have been under the heat lamp whilst something else was cooking. I love my fish being moist after cooking and I cook a lot of fish at home. 
I pointed this out to a member of staff who was on hand immediately once I raised my head up to look for someone.
A lovely girl (Kate I think her name was..) apologised for the inconvenience and said she would have them cook another one immediately. Another piece of fish arrived and unfortunately it was slightly better but still not quite to my liking. She apologised again and asked if I would like something else instead. I then chose the pork and within a few minutes it was there and tasted fabulous.

In the meantime the Restaurant Supervisor (Ileana) came over to give her sincere apologies about the cooking of the fish. She was very friendly and apologetic. We assured her that everything else in the hotel had been top class and that I was very impressed how the staff had handled this situation.
The lady was very helpful and came back again to check that I was then happy with my second choice of the pork, which I was, as it tasted delicious. We left after dinner feeling that although one of us had a slight issue at dinner, we were treated respectfully and with great care and attention once something had gone wrong.

I would strongly suggest that many other hotels around Ireland have a close look at the model of the Castleknock Hotel. They for us are leading the way that guests should be treated when they spend their hard earned money for a staycation.

We will be back again in the near future to enjoy a longer stay. Thanks again to Ileana and indeed all the staff at the hotel for making us feel like VIP's during our short stay.",5,2021,10,04
223,They Get Everything Right Here.,"Stayed here last weekend in September.Great location near the City but has a country feel belped in no small way by the manicured lawns and shrubbery on a generous site. A  modern contemporary Hotel with lots of great amenities inluding Spa and swimming pool and gym and of course the nearby Castkeknock Golf Club.

The Hotel was very busy yet they coped with aplomb with high standards and very professjonal and friendly staff 

Its not very often that relatively large Hotels get so much right but the Castleknock does, eveything is well thought through and delivered. We were very impressed with Syed the Deputy General Manager who gave us great advise and guidance on things to do and places to visit whilst at the Castleknock. 
There are plenty of options in the many
Food outlets at the property from informal, to terrace and more formal in the Earth & Vine restaurant,  and oh nearly forgot some lovely cocktails in Bar 22.

The Castleknock is a former winner of the AA Hotel of the year and its  no wonder as they havnt rested on their laurels, keep up the great work, we will be back.",5,2021,10,03
223,Excellent stay,"Cliche but where do I start? 
Check in was smooth, lunch was superb. Despite being quite busy the service was excellent, not having to ask for a jug of water or even have it topped up the manager just kept an eye on our table and even filled up our tea pots. 
The spa was beautiful, not a huge variety of extra spa facilities, but standard relaxation room, sauna, jacuzzi and steam room were available. The massage I got with Farranah was excellent, I am pregnant and was anxious regarding how it would turn out but at the end all I could think of was could I book in again it was just so good! She‚Äôs quite knowledgable and very approachable, I would definitely ask for her if I was going again. 
The dinner that night was excellent the service in the restaurant was fantastic again. All staff throughout very accommodating and kind. They would go out of their way to ask how everything was and even found out it was my 30 th birthday and without request came out with a desert and all of the waitress‚Äô singing happy birthday. The manager ( I can‚Äôt remember her name; was very professional and experienced attended every table to see how everything was. 
The music after in the lobby was lively and there was a great buzz about the hotel no matter what time you were around the main lobby area. 
The hotel is very child friendly and I hope to take my children next time we go, look forward to it already!",5,2021,10,02
223,Excellent,"Hotel was absolutely beautiful, staff were second to none couldn‚Äôt be anymore helpful, food was unbelievable in both restaurants, cleanliness of the hotel would put anyone at ease especially during these times. Hotel is run extremely well could be more happier brilliant. ",5,2021,10,01
223,Anniversary Visit,"Made our first visit here in September for wedding anniversary. We stayed 2 nights. We upgraded to a suite which was very spacious and made our visit that more special. We spent the first day in Dublin centre and got the bus home which was only a 5 min walk from hotel. The second day we went to the pool area and afterwards sat in the reception area enjoying lovely barista coffee.. in the afternoon we had an amazing tray delivered to the room. Consisted of Prosecco chocolate, marshmallows,  nachos,dips and popcorn‚Ä¶ was just perfect as we  enjoyed  all that and watched Netflix .. we upgraded our evening meal to the beautiful Earth and Vine restaurant. Food and service alike was special. We finished our trip with an early morning swim and another fabulous breakfast.  Would love to visit again in the near future as we had such a relaxing time. Credit to all staff who were soo friendly and efficient.  My only feedback would be that I would‚Äôve really appreciated hair conditioner in the bathroom . Thank you for a lovely stay .",5,2021,10,01
223,Couples retreat,Stayed here last week on a 2 night break. Got a really good offer which included 2 evening meals a lunch & a facial in the spa. Girl on ckeck in desk was quite pleasant but i had to ask for directions to room. Paid extra to upgrade but was very dissapointed with the room. Room 142 had so many things wrong with it. Complained to the manager she was more than helpful. She said it should never have been used. Moved us to the junior suite. Couldn't fault anything else. Food was lovely & the staff were very pleasant & helpful.,4,2021,09,30
223,Mrs Murphy,Birthdayweallwent to stay in your hotel very disappointed with the hotel as I all ready stated dinner was not nice had to be given back as it was unbeatable and forgot to bring out birthday cake that l gave to staff earlier ,3,2021,09,29

223,Castleknock hotel,"the guest and meeting rooms at the hotel were top notch. food and service excellent. IT needs fully met with a national meeting connected to to 5 separate locations with out issue. Staff are very attentive and friendly. Great location, with a country feel to a Dublin Suburb site ",5,2021,09,28
223,Limited set menu when on dinner inclusive deal,"We stayed recently and had stayed there before. It's a nice hotel. This time we were on a 3-course dinner inclusive deal. However, the menu options were drastically reduced from the full bar menu. There were approximately 4 starters, 5 mains and 4 desserts. Two of the mains, steak and an optional chicken fillet in pasta, had an added supplement/charge. The only pizza option was a margherita while several pizza options were on the full bar menu. It turned eating there into a canteen experience and making do from restricted choices, although the surroundings were nice. We would have been very happy if the full menu was available, but were left disappointed with the set menu. I don't know what would be done for people with allergies/intolerances.",2,2021,09,28
223,Don't book this hotel for the pool. As you will be disappointed,"We booked the hotel purely because it has a pool for the kids. Rooms were very nice and food was fine. However kids hours are onky 10-6pm, so when we arrived at 4.30 had to get to room and rush to pool. Only to wait in a line for half an hour  with every other family trying to use the pool. Before 6pm. Steam room and jacuzzi didn't work. Also couldn't use pool the next moring as we had to check out at 10am and no kids allowed till after 10. Not family friendly hotel. ",3,2021,09,28
223,Lovely hotel,My husband and I celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary here for a few days couldn‚Äôt fault the hotel in any way will definitely be back . Rooms bright and clean lovely view over the lake . Food excellent and staff very friendly.,5,2021,09,27

All Staff is so nice and friendly,  Daria and Ileana looked after us,  everything was served perfectly!",5,2021,09,18
223,Very disappointed - not a hotel suitable for families with little children.,"Heating - unable to adjust the room temperature - stayed two nights but found the heat in the hotel meant the stay and rooms were uncomfortable.
I was very disappointed at the service - travelled with our 3-year-old daughter and was unable to order a plain ham sandwich for a hungry child to eat in the foyer at 18:30. The solution offered was order room service, return to our room 10 minutes after we arrived, our daughter should eat in the room or move in to the restaurant so a small child could have a sandwich.
Just awful, my husband and I had already eaten. To be refused a sandwich when we were sitting in the foyer, which serves as a cafe during the day is hard to understand. Regarding the room, I wanted a double and single bed, I got three singles. There was no fridge so I could keep a bottle of milk for our daughter chilled, I had to ring for ice to try and keep water chilled as the room was far too warm and could not be adjusted. That melted so our daughter got warm water in a bottle in the middle of the night.  
Lastly I followed the instructions as advised by the front desk during check in. I used the door sign to let house-keeping know, we only wanted fresh towels the next day and a bin emptied - got neither, no one looked at the room.
Your hotel has two main areas for improvement
1.	Understand that young children like to snack ‚Äìa plain sandwich is not an unreasonable request, even a scone or light bite. Nothing was available.
2.	Your hotel needs a manager who is visible, someone who is visible to guests and checks that people are enjoying their stay. If you intend to attract young families, you need to be more accommodating for children. A small fridge in a room would be a start.

223,Great stay,""" we stayed in this hotel, and from the moment we walked in, it was fabulous.   The staff so friendly and helpful. 
We enjoyed fantastic full body massage, the therapist in the spa were so professional, but friendly. 
Our meal was delicious from the first course to the last, with great service,  we then enjoyed cocktails in the lobby that was cosy relaxing, with comfortable chairs, to sit back and chat. 
The room was spotless with a fabulous view over the golf course. Looking forward to the next visit all redy",5,2021,09,14
223,Lovely stay,We stayed here for a night last week and we had a lovely time. Highlight was the wonderful food and cocktails. The fire in the lobby was a nice touch for an after dinner cocktail. We would love to come back with our toddler. ,4,2021,09,14
223,Lovely stay,Lovely hotel with lovely staff.Rooms could do with a fridge or mini bar though .Breakfast lovely. Dinner very good. Plenty of staff on and all of them were very good. Would definitely return and recommend. Thanks for a lovely stay. ,4,2021,09,13
223,Exceeded expectations,"A first class stay in this hotel on our honeymoon and I have to say the staff could not have done anything more to make our stay enjoyable. Wonderful room, food and atmosphere. A truly exceptional stay which we hope to repeat in the future.

223,Amazing stay and Amazing staff,"It was myself and my fianc√©'s first time staying at the hotel and what an amazing experience at that we could not fault anything. The food, spa and pool excellent. The staff Katie, Daniel and Aaron were brilliant üëè we can not wait for our next visit.",5,2021,09,12
223,Short break - treat,"Excellent venue, everything was perfect...staff were extra helpful and friendly and genuinely concerned you had the best experience,  it's a great location for city break as only a short trip to the city centre...and next to the Pheonix Park ",5,2021,09,12
223,Amazing Staff,"I‚Äôve stayed in a lot of hotels in my time and the staff in the Castleknock Hotel are the best I‚Äôve come across. Every single person we dealt with was pleasant, friendly and efficient. The girl who served us afternoon drinks on the outside terrace kept checking we were ok for refills despite being run off her feet. The waitress for dinner, I think her name was Caoimhe, seemed genuinely delighted to be serving us. She was chatty without being overbearing and constantly checked in to make sure we had everything we needed. Even later in the evening she was on top form chatting to the kids at a nearby table. All the cleaning staff we met in the corridors smiled at us every time we went past. All this might sound very basic stuff but it‚Äôs not standard in every hotel. It genuinely added to our stay and management should be incredibly proud of their team.",4,2021,09,09
223,Nice stay,"Stay was lovely, nice room and staff, was a little disappointed over dinner booking, we had made a reservation but our names weren't down on book, that was a little disappointing the fact it was our anniversary dinner. we did get a table but it wasn't the best seating area. our stay other then that was fine.",5,2021,09,09
223,Great to find car charging faciliity.,Happy to find car charging. Food limited and disappointing. Lovely staff made up for this. Hotel a bit of a maze. Could do with more signs. Rooms good size and well kept. Stayed for location as playing golf in Lutterlstown next morning,4,2021,09,09
223,Not just beautiful,"This hotel is not just beautiful, but it also has the kindest, most helpful staff. They truly make your stay a happy memory! They provided a sewing kit when my grandson had a rip in his shirt, and a folder for me when I needed something to place my presentation in. They listen and assist - a winning combination!",5,2021,09,09
223,OK,"Make up on the bathrobe which was in the bedroom for us-TV remote did not work-Breakfast staff not really awake and had to ask for items numerous times.

Night dinner staff were excellent-Guy called Cormac-went above and beyond ",3,2021,09,04
223,"Service good, food terrible!","Went for food with my young family Saturday afternoon. Didn't feel particularly welcome but the service was good from the waiting staff. Adults meal portions are too small and the children's meals are too big. The food was cold and unpleasant to eat. It was a busy day in the hotel but that is no excuse. For the prices they charge for food, I would expect a bit more quality. Won't be returning for some time!",3,2021,09,04
223,Family Friendly Hotel,"Myself, my wife and daughter stayed in Castleknock for two nights at the end of August. We would highly recommend this hotel for families with small kids. The playground on site was perfect, as too was the swimming pool. 

The staff were very helpful. The rooms were very clean. 

Overall, a very nice stay.",4,2021,09,03
223,Anniversary stay,"We came away for our anniversary, the place was very nice and seemed lovely at first however we purchased a package which included dinner and we unfortunately found a disgusting finger nail in one of our soups, the staff tried to say it was something else but it most certain wasn‚Äôt. We were first taken advantage of because of our young age and were told it wasn‚Äôt what we thought it was. We were then later given a free voucher for dinner. We were very happy with most of the staff who tried to make our stay as pleasant as possible, especially the restaurant staff, in particular Oliver. He was very understanding and made sure to take the situation seriously, thank you for the stay and we hope to be back in the future because we understand mistakes can happen however the food was not up to standard and hygiene in the restaurant should be improved.",3,2021,09,02
223,Way overpriced,"Everything overpriced, very average menu, swim hat ‚Ç¨3, room service ‚Ç¨8 per delivery, late check out ‚Ç¨20 per hour all on top of a ‚Ç¨198 standard double room without breakfast felt like being on a Ryanair flight wouldn‚Äôt go back ",2,2021,08,31
223,Great Hotel,We arrived after checking in online and collected our keys. Room was beautiful and the dinner even more so. We were able to check out online also which made it so much quicker. The staff were so nice and helpful. ,5,2021,08,31
223,Little Bit disappointing,"Heard great things about this hotel so was really looking forward to staying. However, it didn't live up to our expectations.  I cannot fault the staff who were all really friendly and helpful. However we did have a few issues. The beds were extremely uncomfortable - there was a group of us staying in a few rooms and none of us got a proper nights sleep.  The food in the restaurant was very average.  A few of our plates were not heated so our meals were cold. I understand that the restaurant was very busy at the time but cold food is disappointing.  The breakfast was fine, typical hotel breakfast. I would have expected better for the price we paid for the rooms",3,2021,08,31
223,"Staff are miserable, too many kids","Kids everywhere such as the pool, running around breakfast, crying at dinner. Staff members such as cleaning staff looked miserable every time we went to our room. Took 30 mins for 1 cocktail to come to our table for dinner ",2,2021,08,31
223,Absolutely perfect,"Visited here on Monday 23rd August for one night and from start to finish everything was amazing. We arrived early and had lunch on the patio, the weather was great and area was so so comfortable. I loved all the little hand santizers on each table which was a good touch. We stayed in the chesterfield suite, wow what an amazing room, everything was spotless and we were blown away. The pool area was great, we didn‚Äôt have spa treatments but it looked lovely. All the staff knew exactly what they were doing and although the place was both busy for dinner that night and breakfast next morning the service was first class. The cocktails and food was delicious. I work for a large hotel chain and after reopening was in much need of a great break after how difficult it has been and the castleknock team totally delivered thank you so much and keep up the good work already looking forward to coming back",5,2021,08,31
223,2 night package with 3 course meal and hamper,"Food was quick and 10/10. Room was lovely. Staff nice, always checking up, overall delightful people. Good place for golf lovers. Not many facilities in walking distance from hotel, would need a car. Takeaway deliveries near! ",5,2021,08,29
223,Good hotel,Good but food disappointing very poor choice on menu.One member of party chose salmon which was overcook dry and whole dish tasteless.  However response  from restaurant team was excellent and cost deducted from bill.,4,2021,08,28
223,"Nice hotel,poor experience","Nice hotel for families, however it was expensive for the family room which was extremely warm and none of us could sleep, glad we were only staying one night, bathroom tiles were extremely hot and the children couldn't walk on the floor without shoes.",3,2021,08,28
223,Fabulous hotel,The entire family loved our stay here. Very relaxed yet felt safe following covid guidelines. The bedroom was beautiful and the food was delicious. Kids loved the pool and the park. Staff were also amazing.  ,5,2021,08,28
223,Incredible Experience,"From the moment we arrived, we were blown away. Beautiful and clean hotel, very friendly staff, delicious food and drinks...we were in love! We had the missed moments package and they really went above and beyond; balloon, prosecco, chocolates and even a card! We're very much looking forward to our next stay there.",5,2021,08,25
223,Amazing Staff,"Beautiful hotel, courteous staff who went the 'extra mile' especially in these strange Covid times.   Everybody we encountered was so helplful, especially the lovely, friendly Trish at the breakfast front desk who showed us to our table and took the time, even though they were exceptionally busy, to explain the breakfast set up to us. A wonderful experience. Thank You.",5,2021,08,24
223,Fantastic Family Getaway,"We booked the generations package for a family celebration. From check in to check out we had the most fantastic stay. The children loved it so much they did not want to leave. The facilities were fabulous. The breakfast selection was great with a variety of options. The dinner on both nights was absolutely delicious, with generous portions. The service throughout the stay was excellent. ",5,2021,08,24
223,Great hotel,"Had a lovely stay with friends at the hotel. Staff are fantastic, food and cocktails delicious. Hotel decor is beautiful and great outdoor area. We didn't use the pool thistime but it looked fab.
Will definitely return.",5,2021,08,23
223,Luxurious - and worth it!!,"There are loads of hotels that offer ""luxury"" and then fail to do the little things that make or break a stay.  The Castleknock Hotel is the 1st place in Ireland that I've stayed at where the high cost was justified.

We stayed at the Honeymoon Suite - lovely for a couple married 25 years! - and found it just stunning.  Really felt pampered.

The service was perfect.  Given the number of requests that we made during our two night stay, we went away with the feeling that they would have said ""yes"" to anything!

Breakfast was fine.  COVID makes some things harder than others, but they are coping well.

We had all our meals in the room - why would we go anywhere else when we had this amazing room??

We saw a lot of kids there - rich people, I guess - but it didn't have the feel that kids were running everywhere.  It was policed well and we enjoyed watching all the happy kids playing and just being kids.",5,2021,08,23
223,Wedding,I would like to thank every staff member in Castleknock hotel who have made our wedding so special . I can‚Äôt recommend enough how amazing this hotel is . A big thank you to Niamh and Louise for making this wedding they are amazing ladies . Thank you to Nuala on the night she was just brilliant with us and our guests ,5,2021,08,23
223,Great stay at the Castleknock Hotel,"We had a wonderful stay at the Castleknock Hotel. The room was comfortable and clean. The food for breakfast, dinner and lunch was delicious and presented well. Staff were helpful and friendly. Covid procedures helped me feel safe. We will be back to stay",5,2021,08,23
223,A wonderful stay,We had a 3 night stay in the Castleknock Hotel with dinner and breakfast included. The room (for 2 Ad & 3 kids) was comfortable and spacious. No issues getting into the pool or booking dinner/breakfast which was great. We felt safe as we moved around the hotel as everyone in the hotel is required to wear a mask outside of their room. The food in the restaurant was excellent as were the breakfasts. Overall a brilliant stay and I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to recommend this hotel.,5,2021,08,23
223,Amazing,The best hotel I have ever stayed in by a mile. Staff are incredible. Food was superb. Cannot find a single fault about anything in the hotel. I am highly recommending to everyone I know to come and stay here for a night or 2.,5,2021,08,22
223,Massively disappointed,"Visited in August to celebrate our silver wedding anniversary. Booked a luxury suite as it was a special occasion. On arrival checkin was poor with limited information relating to the hotel and area, also hampered by difficulties communicating through masks and screens but that‚Äôs what we have become used to with COVID. Stayed in the Guinness Suite which was quite a nice room with adjoining lounge. Hotel had left a really pathetic couple of chocolates , one of which looked half eaten and a card addressed to ‚Äòdear guest‚Äô encouraging us to pop a cork and celebrate. There are occasions when you expect the hotel to go the extra mile, and this hotel failed miserably. I spoke to reception who were completely disinterested. Leisure centre is fine with a pool dominated by children, getting the jacuzzi is impossible as due to COVID the restrictions only allow a couple of people from the same household to use it at any one time. The pool is also currently restricted in terms of numbers so ring down to ensure there is space. Swim caps are also required. Restaurant was very good in terms of food and service was very attentive for all meals. The suite had no toiletries for having a bath as those in place are secured to the wall of the shower cubicle, meaning you have to get out of the bath to get shampoo and body wash from the dispenser, little thought has clearly gone into this. If staying here and going into Dublin , there is a train station , Coolmine, which is about 20 mins walk away and will have you in Dublin Connolly in 20 minutes. Train goes every half hour or so. We found this out ourselves as there was no one at guest services for our entire stay! Contacted after we left by the hotel offering to ‚Äòlook after us with an upgrade‚Äô if we ever return. Sorry but found this to be an impersonal hotel which left us sadly disappointed and won‚Äôt return.",2,2021,08,21
223,Very Pleasent,"It would be hard to find nicer staff than in this hotel.
Rooms are well sound proofed and food is excellent although I would prefer to be served breakfast from a menu rather than the buffet they have set up, ( which you are still served).
I stayed with friends for one night and then on my own for three nights afterwards. 
The staff were extremely helpful and friendly in every area of the hotel.",4,2021,08,21
223,Very disorganised swimming pool system,You can't book the pool in advance like you do in all other hotels we've stayed in since Covid. Just have to show up and wait but wait times very long which isn't practical with a toddler. Complete disaster ,1,2021,08,21
223,A wonderful experience,My stay at the Castleknock Hotel in August was a most pleasant experience The facilities were spotless the rooms comfortable the food excellent the leisure facilities suitable times and top class and the staff friendly and always available to help I would highly recommend a stay in this wonderful hotel and hope to return,5,2021,08,20
223,Perfect escape,"Perfect space for relaxing, switching off and recharging. Not far from Dublin, staff great, breakfast was cold, but this due to Covid, staff weren't quick to offer tea/coffee. Had to ask a few times. Other than that, it was great ",5,2021,08,20
223,Timeless escape,"We are just back after our three night stay with the timeless escape package.  Fantastic value.  Very comfortable room, which was serviced daily as we requested.  Good menu choices on the package deal with generous portions.  Genuinely friendly staff.  The hotel was very busy all day everyday, lots of staff always on duty, fast friendly service.  Lots of visible cleaning, hand sanitising points & social distancing. Highly recommend & will return.",5,2021,08,20
223,Summer Break,"Fabulous property, exceptional staff very professional and friendly. The location was excellent for travel from outside the capital. Will be back again.We enjoyed the pool and spa area, the food and service were of a very high standard.  ",5,2021,08,20
223,Excellent stay!!!,Amazing stay from start to finish. Eoin in the restaurant gave exceptional customer service from start to finish. Great addition to the hotel!! We will definitely be back again for another stay very soon.,5,2021,08,19
223,Fun family break,"Another relaxing stay in this fab hotel. Easy check in, clean and spacious room, tasty food, delicious cocktails and great facilities. Staff couldn't be more helpful and felt very safe. Already booked to go back.",5,2021,08,19
223,Coffee on the Terrace,"My husband and I had a very relaxing mid-week visit to the Terrace. It is bright and cheerful, cosy too with heaters under the awning and a bit of background music. Coffee, beer and a delicious sea food platter went down a treat. Thanks to Gr√°inne and Deirdre for their friendly service. We'll be back.",5,2021,08,18
223,Disappointing,"We had a very poor experience here. 

But let's start with a positive. Most staff are very friendly and that's always nice. The leisure centre & the restaurant and in particular 2 lovely members of staff passing by that tried to help out in the middle of the night when we were woken by our rowdy neighbours. Because there was nobody on reception when we rang for help and we didn't get to sleep until past 3am. We were travelling with children who had to listen to rowdy singing and vomiting. Yes I know that can happen anywhere but no security/nightstaff available, the dismissive way in which my complaint was dealt with at reception and the zero contact from the Manager - when I specifically asked for this to be passed on - has led to this review.

Some notes for management - the breakfast is still cold as others have reported and also the swimming pool really needs a better filter system. There was dirt floating. Rooms really need aircon as we had to close the window with the noise outside and it was sweltering. 

Its not cheap to stay here and it markets itself as family friendly. This review isn't to be nasty, its just the truth. Maybe comments made on Trip Advisor rather than the reception desk are taken on board by hotels with more effectiveness. I would like to think another family would be spared this. A trip away ruined.",2,2021,08,18
223,Ok,"Clean hotel. In general, staff are very pleasant and helpful...they are the biggest selling point of the hotel. Hotel seemed very busy and lobby did not appear to be in line with covid restrictions. Found hotel clean. If you are booking spa treatments, be aware you need to book pool facilities separately.  This was not advised to us when we queried upon booking. Pool for apa is not separate to general pool",3,2021,08,18
223,visit to restaurant,Had a wonderful visit to hotel restaurant last evening. This was our first visit here but not our last. All Pandemic Guidelines were strictly adhered to in a very customer friendly way. There is a very pleasant feeling and athmosphere around the building with staff being very welcoming. The food was excellent and it was great to eat out in comfort and safety once again. I must give a BIG shout out to our waiter who made our night for us. RAOUL who is from Romania was so pleasant professional and knowledgeable made our evening so more enjoyable. From the moment he introduced himself the evening just got better and better. He even made the effort to come and find us while we were having a drink to say goodbye before he clocked off after what was a very busy night ( for a Tuesday ) the place was packed. Thank you Castleknock Hotel we'll be back. Shay Russell.,4,2021,08,18
223,Family trip,Enjoyed stay lovely hotel would recommend to a friend or family member.would have rathered if breakfast was served at table though my food was cold both mornings bout time I had everything got for myself and kids,4,2021,08,18
223,Fabulous family friendly hotel,As a family of 5 we enjoyed a fantastic 2 night stay in the Castleknock Hotel.  During our stay we enjoyed fantastic bar food and made great use of the leisure centre.  Our bedrooms were extremely comfortable and clean.  The hotel had fantastic indoor and outdoor dining spaces. The staff were very friendly and covid conscious. The hotel is an ideal location  to avail of a trip to Tayto Park and of course some retail therapy in Blanchardstown Shopping Centre.  We will be back.  The Moores.,5,2021,08,17
223,Another wonderful stay,"Have just returned from a wonderful 3 night break to the Gorgeous Castleknock Hotel from the moment we arrived everything was wonderful. The attention to Covid 19 safety was fabulous  everywhere was spotless and although the Goverment rule of parties of 6 was tricky the hotel did everything possible to accommodate the 7of us by putting us at two tables side by side.
The breakfasts were very enjoyable plenty of variety and dietary requirements were met with no fuss.
I have  never been to a hotel with so many staff on hand to assist Customers it was lovely to see. 
The hotel management have given a lot of thought to keeping both their staff and customers safe including excellent housekeeping in the bedrooms and no mixing of parties in the elevators. 
We dined in the Hotel on two evenings one of which was my Sisters birthday. A special mention to Andrew,Bar and Restaurant  Manager who went over and above to ensure we all had a wonderful night on Sunday. The chicken  wings were amazing and the clean  plates after every meal spoke for themselves 
The choice of drinks from the Drinks menu is 1st class and the cocktails were wonderful as was the Sav Blanc always perfectly chilled.The Guiness drinkers in the party had absolutely no complaints.
All in a wonderful stay can't wait for our return visit.",5,2021,08,17
223,Can do better.,"Great hotel  but breakfast is chaotic ,we were in a queue that reached almost to reception,I couldn‚Äôt understand why they couldn‚Äôt serve breakfast at the table .It seemed counterproductive as with the screens we were all corralled into a narrow space to queue.
We travelled in our family unit of 7 to the hotel and when we were sitting in reception (bearing in mind we travelled to the hotel in my 7 seater) we were told that we could not all sit together -totally ridiculous as my dad ended up sitting at a table behind us. Our tv didn‚Äôt work and when I asked at reception they said they would send someone to fix it -this never happened.Also I do think it‚Äôs a little bit of a cop out to not service the rooms if you‚Äôre there for more than one night.",3,2021,08,17
223,Family of 5,Paid ‚Ç¨230 a night to stay here. Food very poor standard for dinner. Ordered a burger recieved same with chips....nothing else???? Over priced for what the hotel is. Rooms clean staff friendly. Hotel cancelled family event booked in jan 2021 when they promised everything. Cancelled with 2 weeks notice very disappointed bride for day 2 event. ,3,2021,08,17
223,Very Attentive Staff,"Overall the hotel was excellent. The quality of the food & the size of the portions for our meals there were both very good. It was a lovely hotel. It was very well run, & the staff were extremely courteous. One young waiter in particular (I didn't get his name) simply could not do enough for us whilst serving dinner & lunch the next day. We will definitely return soon. ",5,2021,08,16
223,Lovely hotel and restaurant,Went to Castleknock hotel for my 21st birthday and the hotel room was very big and clean. The service in the restaurant was outstanding. A server named Eoin made my birthday night amazing and was so helpful! 10/10 would reccomend!,5,2021,08,15
223,Couples night away,Myself and my partner stayed here on a Sunday evening. We could not recommend this hotel enough! From the moment we walked through the door we were so welcomed & the staff are so friendly with amazing service. If you want a night away to relax and unwind this is the perfect place. The staff really made the stay memorable and the relaxed atmosphere was fantastic! Very covid safe but still perfectly enjoyable will absolutely stay here again,5,2021,08,15
223,Outstanding staff,"The staff in the bar especially Darragh and Eoin were fantastic and in the restaurant Caoimhe,Daria and manager ILIENA were outstanding we had such an enjoyable stay. 
So relaxing and chilled. 
Nothing was too much trouble. Thank you all.
",5,2021,08,15
223,Great hotel,"Fantastic hotel beautiful outdoorarea,great location, staff so helpful and friendly,great pool,everywhere is so clean and well looked after, very family friendly  the kids loved it,only 1 little fault were the pillows ",5,2021,08,14
223,Ok hotel for a short stay not a staycation location,"Check in was seamless, room was clean.  Room did not have air conditioning and was positioned beside the air conditioning units for other areas of the hotel which gave a constant hum.  Beds were comfortable.  Room did not have a steam-iron but rather a stained plug in iron that required cleaning before we could use it.  I rang reception to request a steam-iron to iron my bridesmaid dress and was advised that there were none.  I explained that I was to wear the dress the next day and that it hadn't travelled well and I was told that there was nothing that the hotel could do to assist.  The following day I found out that other guests (family members) had steam irons in their rooms.  To be clear, I did not chose the cheapest room, rather I rang the hotel months ago to request a room for 2 adults and a child and this is what they assigned me - they did not offer any other room types.

Evening meal in the restaurant was only ok, it could have done with a side salad.  The wait staff appeared to be very busy and not particularly friendly given they were rushing around (bearing in mind that we had to make bookings in advance).  People were seated next to us closer than I would have thought given covid guidelines.

The lady who seated us for breakfast on day one was a lovely, friendly woman who is a real credit to this hotel.

This hotel is fine if you have plans elsewhere and only plan on really sleeping here, but I would not be recommending it for a staycation or a weekend away.  It served a purpose but could improve on customer service.",3,2021,08,14
223,Lovely Relaxed Mini Break,"Everything about our stay was lovely - the hotel, the staff, the surroundings, the food. We needed a recharge and we really felt the benefit of our couple of days. Everyone is so attentive, particularly our server at dinner. Loved it!",5,2021,08,13
223,Pros and cons,Lovely staff - they were very helpful. This hotel is great for kids - playground is great to have there. Unfortunately we experienced bad service in the restaurant. We were 2.5 hours waiting on two courses and had to skip the third (paid for) because the kids were so tired and had to go to bed. The room was far too hot at night too. The milk and cookies before bed option was a nice touch and the kids loved it.,3,2021,08,13
223,One night stay,"Disappointed with the stay. On arrival at 4.15pm our room was still not ready to check in. The lady at reception was very nice and friendly and did offer a late check out for the inconvenience which was nice. However, when we were called to say our room was ready, my husband dropped up our bags to the room to which we were disappointed again to find out it was three single beds dispite specifically requesting a double and single when booking. I went back to reception to tell them this to which they offered to get someone to push the beds together. As you can imagine we said no if we wanted to we would push the beds ourselves. Disappointing when your paying alot of money for a one night stay.",3,2021,08,12
223,Overall wow factor:  9/10,There was a very generous and yummy breakfast.  The guest room was beautiful and comfy with a choice of both shower and bath.  Went for a very nice walk around the golf grounds outside and also used their indoor swimming pool. ,4,2021,08,12
223,Lovely hotel,Great hotel wasn‚Äôt able to use the pool which is why I booked the hotel but other than that the hotel was great and would stay again and reguests I had was dealt with and rooms are comfy and clean and covid protocol is kept to a high standered  ,5,2021,08,10
223,Best hotel I‚Äôve stayed in,Would highly recommend hotel for a stay 100%. staff were amazing couldn‚Äôt do enough for you . Especially Owen for such a young lad he was amazing at his job . The cleanliness of the hotel was amazing . ,5,2021,08,10
223,A nice hotel let down by its staff,"My stay was not a good experience, unfortunately. I understand that COVID has been hard on the industry, but it was sad to stay in a hotel with so many issues. 

The key problem lies in staffing. Turndown service was the worst I have ever ‚Äî the bed was barely made, used cups and plates were not taken nor replaced, and none of my things were tidied. Given that turndown was only offered on request, we struggle to believe that the staff did not have the time to deliver a better standard. It was a similar story at the F&B outlets: we struggled to attract staff's attention either to be seated, to be served or to pay our bills. Queues at the check in desk were long, with not enough staff serving. In general, there was a lack of focus and attention to the needs of the guests. 

Beyond this, there were a few minor issues. For example the whole hotel was extremely hot and you can tell that there were cost saving measures here and there. Alone, these could have been overlooked. But in addition to the staffing issues they contributed to an unsatisfactory experience.

Please sort the staffing out! You need to hire some experienced managers that create a culture of higher standards.",2,2021,08,09
223,Castleknock family break.,"First class hotel with great facilities. Extremely family friendly with brilliant staff. I would 100% recommend anyone to visit.
Location is ideal to visit the zoo or get the bus into the city centre or visit the local shopping centres and the restaurants.",5,2021,08,09
223,Business trip to Dublin,"Lovely setting and amenities, good location for the industrial estate at Blanchardstown. Restaurant disappointed for dinner.
Didn't get chance to try out the gym nor spa but they looked good at a glance.",3,2021,08,09
223,Spectacular stay,"We have stayed in this hotel for 2 nights as a family in interconnected rooms. Everything was perfect, from spotless , spacious  rooms to friendly and attentive staff. Special thanks to Ioana, Ileana and  Jennifer who made us feel spoiled.
Definitely will come back soon.",5,2021,08,08
223,Amazing service,"Myself and a few friends had a wonderful lunch and afternoon @ Castleknock hotel. They have a gorgeous outdoor area/terrace for dining which you do not need to book. So when we turned up we were made feel very welcome by the staff @ The Terrace and looked after so well. The food was gorgeous and the cocktails absolutely fabulous especially the pornstar martini and the Castleknock delight üëåüèª It was a wet and windy day but we were fully covered in The Terrace and they have outside heaters and blankets if needed. Towards the end of our lunch we were asked if we wanted to move inside as it had gotten very windy and they just wanted to make sure we were comfortable. They asked if we all had our COVID passes which we did so they booked us a lovely table inside. The staff were so lovely and friendly and so professional. They are an asset to the hotel. The Earth & Vine restaurant inside is beautiful. They also have another fab restaurant & bar and a fully covered outdoor area out the back of hotel. It is very well set up and very well run especially regarding all COVID safety and regulations. The bathrooms even have a traffic light system where only a certain number are allowed in at any time, and this is displayed just outside the bathroom doors. 
I was very impressed as were my friends with this hotel, restaurant, food & drinks and the outstanding service from the staff. I will definitely return and hopefully stay over the next time. Would highly recommend!!",5,2021,08,08
223,Amazing staff.,"Just returned from a 3 night stay at Castleknock, the whole experience was excellent. Covid policy very  well implemented,  food amazing value but it is the staff who really make this hotel such a pleasure  to stay in.",5,2021,08,08
223,Family mini summer break,Overall an excellent hotel - very well set up for Covid precautions. Well trained staff who are welcoming and attentive. Food quality very good. Would definitely return.üòä (Just improve your pillows for full marks),5,2021,08,08
223,Can recommend,"Hotel was excellent, very fancy and looks great, it even smells nice. Rooms are perfectly clean and staff is friendly, only thing we had an issue with was the bed was super hard and was just the mattress with a thin sheet on it. We got a super king size bed thinking it would be a luxury experience, but no, we ended up with back pain the next day.",4,2021,08,08
223,Fantastic stay!,"Such a fabulous hotel! Very helpful staff, we had a waiter called Eoin in the restaurant for afternoon tea and for dinner , what a lovely lovely person. Couldn‚Äôt have been more helpful for the whole day, absolutely fantastic at his job!",5,2021,08,07
223,Simply fabulous....great staff,"My daughter had booked us a two night spa breakaway to celebrate my 60th birthday and her engagement...upon arrival there was a fabulous balloon, prosecco and lots of cake in our room....we had afternoon tea when we arrived and the staff were incredibly friendly, producing candles with brownies when they realized we were celebrating.....we had a light bite to eat that evening and the following day we had some spa treatments which were out of this world..the relaxing room is just so beautiful and quiet.....the pool was terrific not too busy and we spent over two hours in it and the jacuzzi....we had dinner that night and again the following morning we got up early and used the pool and the sauna etc.

I simply could not fault this hotel. There are many areas to sit with a drink and read a book and to eat. It is all so well spaced out that it does not feel full, even tho at times it was busy. Early breakfast is not too busy and thats probably recommended. The staff in this hotel obviously love their jobs and it showed...all were so nice...and to be called 'ladies' all the time was a lovely touch.

We would highly recommend this hotel and spa to anyone....we cannot wait to go back again. Thank you to everyone for making it so special.",5,2021,08,07
223,Excellent stay,"We recently stayed for 3 nights with our 20 month old and we had a really lovely time. Our suite was fantastic with plenty of room for a little one to run around. The staff throughout were incredible and so attentive, in particular Cormac in the restaurant who looked after us each evening and Alex at the pool who was so accommodating. The hotel is spotless and clearly adhering to all COVID guidelines. We felt very safe. There are sanitising units everywhere and signs on display. Food was lovely and the cater very well for fussy little eaters.  Nothing was too much trouble. Well done everyone at the Castleknock Hotel. There is clearly an ethos that is centred around providing excellent customer service and it shows. We will be back. ",5,2021,08,07
223,Fantastic Service,"Recently stayed here for two nights with the other half.
Room was lovely but I have to say the service made it for us.

We had the pleasure of Eoin serving us dinner and he was nothing but a gent. We didn't even have to ask for anything the service from him was that good, he was very attentive and extremely polite, couldn't do enough for us, It was as if he could read our minds!!",5,2021,08,03
223,Top Marks,"Very pleasant w/e stay in Castleknock Hotel. The staff delivered a high standard of service and quality of food was excellent particularly breakfast buffet style was first class. Although, a busy w/e the numbers were efficiently managed without too much of a delay at peak meal times. ",5,2021,08,03
223,brilliant very helpful the staff lovely hotel lovely room,will be coming back for my 50th in two  lovely atmosphere very helpful just awesome. the are briliant if you need any sort of help the pool great the food is lovely.  The meals you do not pay extra to get delivered to your room like some hotels great stay.,5,2021,08,03
223,Pampered and then some,"We stayed on a two night Pamper Package. It was superb. The quality of food was excellent throughout. The staff is most pleasant, well-trained and extremely efficient. the standards of cleanliness and covid awareness are of the highest level. A must visit venue.",5,2021,08,01
223,Wonderful,"Wonderful stay. Fabulous staff, always smiling and helpful. Food amazing. Such a relaxing few days, especially given the present situation.  We will definitely be back. Can't recommend it highly enough. ",5,2021,08,01
223,Unlikely to be back to stay again,Beds uncomfortable. Breakfast average no trays to carry food. Had to walk back and fourth food freezing by time got to sit down to eat. Service times in the lobby cafe very poor 20 mins waiting for a slice of cake and a mineral.,2,2021,08,01
223,Great experience.,"Great stay in the hotel. Room was spacious and online check out was really handy. 
Paul in the restaurant was so helpful and attentive during evening meal and sorted us with an area for drinks afterwards.",5,2021,08,01
223,Girlie Getaway Package,"Myself & my mum recently had a lovely stay in the castleknock hotel. The staff, the spa, the food & drinks - really were all terrific. The staff get a special mention though- they are an absolute credit to the hotel.",5,2021,08,01
223,Night stay,"It's only been a few hours but already we have been blown away by the staff that have dealt with us, those being, DANIEL and CIAN from the outdoor dining bar and CAOIMHE from the restaurant has been next to nothing compared to any other hotel we've been to.  The hotel would be nothing without these staff members.",5,2021,07,31
223,Fantastic night away,The Castleknock hotel is a very peaceful and friendly hotel. We ate dinner in the restaurant and the food & service was amazing! Caoimhe was fantastic with her service and made us feel very welcome the whole time we were there. We couldn‚Äôt  recommend her high enough as a server! Overall it‚Äôs an amazing hotel which I  will definitely be staying again!,5,2021,07,31
223,Very disappointed,"I was told my room was upgraded to Executive. The room was dated and had a view of the air conditioning machinery outside the window. The bed was hard and uncomfortable and the chair in the room was one of those stack away chairs, very uncomfortable. The TV remote control worked only intermittently. I had it changed twice but still the same.
If this is an upgrade I shudder to think what the standard rooms are like.
I couldn't get a dinner that night because I hadn't booked a table and it was packed.  Was told I could get a salad outside on the terrace but it was torrential rain outside.
Breakfast was ok. 
Wouldn't stay again as the standards are low and the price high for what you get. 
It's a poor 3 star hotel masquerading as a 4 star. It's obviously aimed at families with small children and not business guests.",1,2021,07,28
223,A short stay,"Although it was only an overnight stay we fully enjoyed our visit to the hotel and would go there again in the future, from our arrival to departure the staff were very nice and helpful during our stay.",5,2021,07,28
223,"Beautiful hotel, great staff, food so good. Will be back","We had a lovely stay. Lovely hotel, staff so attentive and pleasant, food delicious and comfy beds. A lovely stay. A really nice outside area to sit in. This is our second time staying and we can‚Äôt wait to go back. Definitely recommend",5,2021,07,28
223,Could not fault a thing,"Stayed here last weekend and it was such a relaxing break the staff cannot do enough for you , the food in both terrace and restaurant were fabulous and the castleknock have it perfect right down to the finer details like complimentary sun lotions and sunglasses during the day or blankets for sitting out in the evenings when it gets a little bit chilly , by far one of the best hotels we have stayed in ",5,2021,07,27
223,"Very good stay, would return!","The hotel is beautiful and staff are very friendly. They accommodated us with two cots for our young children (4 months old and 19 months old) and the rooms were very clean! Covid measures were also excellent and we felt very safe there. The food and cocktails were also great and facilities too (play park and swimming pool!) we got the picnic deal and it was left to our room and was really lovely! Very close to the zoo which we went to and also enjoyed! 

The only thing that was slightly disappointing was the service at meal times although I expect this may be down to reduced staff with covid and I was very understanding of this. At dinner one evening we had ordered food for our daughter and our dinner came and I asked a staff member was my daughters food on its way, he said yes it‚Äôs on its way. It still didn‚Äôt arrive so I asked another member of staff who advised me that it‚Äôs a buffet for children and you have to get it yourself which we weren‚Äôt advised of when ordering. She apologised and went and got it for us which I appreciated as my toddler had became very impatient and had ate most of my chips lol
The next day at breakfast, I was ordering hot food and the lady I was ordering it off sat down my plate (with food on it) to answer another customers query and went in the back. She never returned so I waited and waited and eventually I had to ask another lady could she please finish my breakfasts as the other lady disappeared without a word and numerous people in the queue behind me had got served theirs while I waited. On this same morning we had to ask for a high chair 3 times as we had our food in front of us and had to start feeding my toddler in the pram. My only suggestion would be to have more staff on at breakfast time and this would smooth these issues out. We had a lovely time at the hotel and would definitely return, thanks very much",4,2021,07,27
223,July trip,Hotel and staff were amazing made us so welcome from check in to check out. The food and drinks menus had plenty of choice and the facilities were  brilliant. The  hotel room was so clean. Will definitely stay again. ,5,2021,07,27
223,Fantastic experience,"From start to finish a fab stay. Will definitely be back. Staff, service, food, covid measures all terrific. Bedroom was lovely and very comfortable. Checking in and out online was seamless and very convenient.",5,2021,07,26
223,Great stay with friends,"We stayed at the Castleknock Hotel using a stay and dine package. I couldn‚Äôt recommend the hotel enough and was really impressed. Their Covid measures really are top notch, the restaurant food is just stunning, cocktails are perfect, the pool was clean, the breakfast was one of the best I've seen and the staff are all so accommodating. 
We had dinner in the restaurant and were served by the most amazing staff member, Paul. He was friendly, professional, and very knowledgeable about the menu and drinks etc. He helped us feel at ease about dining with other guests and the service was great. The food was just incredible, and they have a dedicated vegetarian/ vegan menu which was really a plus.
Their outisde dining was enhnaced with little favors like complimentary sunscreen and glasses should you require them and their service on both the terrace and restaurant was really quick. 
The room was really well presented and super clean. We had a fan in the room which helped as it was very warm- but then the weather was super hot while we were there. 
There were plenty of familes that all seemed really well catered for as well, with the kids outdoor playground.",5,2021,07,26
223,Excellent,"Stayed for one night. Rooms are great size and beds are huge.

Service was excellent and pool was fab tok.

Restaurant was fabulous too and breakfast was delicious.

Staff and very well trained and so friendly and accommodating.

Would highly recommend this hotel üëå",5,2021,07,26
223,Not great,"I booked 2 twin rooms, we got 2 doubles.  I questioned this, nobody got back to me.  The shower was broke, maintenance only half fixed it after I complained that it, it was still falling apart after they called.  The food menu is not very exciting, same thing everynight. ",2,2021,07,25
223,Rooms like a sauna,Rooms were like a sauna and desk response did not help the situation. Got vertually no sleep due the temperature in the room. Other than that the hotel general staff were amazing and very helpful and food was delicious.,3,2021,07,25
223,SPA makeup service,"Had my makeup done in the SPA with the lovely Elloise for a wedding recently! It was a fantastic experience, Elloise is so professional and great company, makeup was exactly what I wanted (natural looking) and never budged all day/night! I didn‚Äôt have to touch it up at all! It was also excellent value. All covid guidelines were followed in the SPA.
Will definitely be going back.",5,2021,07,24
223,Excellent,"Excellent stay , the hotel pool is lovely , bar and dinner area is great , great quality and selection of food and drinks. Staff very helpful and approachable. Rooms very clean , easy to get around hotel.",5,2021,07,24
223,Really impressive hotel,"Super impressed with this hotel, great staff, food, pool/gym. Has a resort feel but right in the middle of Dublin. Really nice extra touches that you don't normally see at a 4 star. Location is great, feels like you are in the country side but you are so close to everything.",5,2021,07,23
223,Aideen,"I just want to say a huge thank you to Eoin who looked after my self and my Mam today impeccably.
He made us feel very special at our 
afternoon tea & dinner.
Its our  second time at this hotel and Eoin looked after us previously his customer service  skills are excellent.
So well suited makes every one feel so at ease.
We need more people like Eoin but unfortunately the way he is with people has more to do with him as  person and probably cant be taught.
Such people are very rare his such an asset to the hotel and Iam sure the hotel are very aware of the gem of an employee they have in Eoin.
Will certainly be back for many more happy times.
Mairead on check in is a pleasure to deal with as is Katie in the restaurant's made a huge effort to make Mams Birthday very special 
A huge shout out to Syed the manager you went that extra mile to make our stay a very happy time thank you very much 
Thank you to all the staff at the Castleknock hotel who are working under extremely challenging times 
 Aideen & Ann. .xx",5,2021,07,22
223,Girls trip,"We decided to stay here last minute on Monday the 19th of July, and for sure we are delighted we did. We were looked after throughout our whole visit by brilliant professional staff. We ate in the restaurant were a young lady named ‚ÄòDaria‚Äô(i think) looked after us along side her mother who also worked there. Everything from start to finish was gorgeous. There was 4 of us in total. Andrew as always was brilliant and a bit thanks to him for making us feel so welcome. I couldn‚Äôt recommend the hotel enough very safe with all measures in place. Well done to all and I can‚Äôt wait to visit again soon",5,2021,07,21
223,Castleknock Stay,"Fantastic Hotel for a break away. 

We stayed with the family and had a great experience.

The bedroom's, food, cocktail menu, leisure facilities and overall service levels were great.

Could only recommend!",5,2021,07,21
223,Weekend away in Castleknock Hotel,Castleknock Hotel is spotless all the staff are amazing working so hard  during covid times!food is fabulous and the special offers on Facebook and Instagram are brilliant offers love staying in the Hotel to get a break ,5,2021,07,20
223,Wonderful Hotel,"Myself and my two close friends stayed here for a night which was my 3rd time staying. The hotel has everything you need, leisure centre which is fab, beautiful restaurant, outdoor dining and a fabulous lounge great for chilling, afternoon tea or evening drinks. ",5,2021,07,20
223,"Overpriced, basic rooms, uninterested staff.","Recently stayed for 2 nights. Bedroom straight out the 80's, no air conditioning (given a plugin fan which is handy during a heatwave), carpet you wouldn;t let your dog sleep on, that type of thing. This is the hotel that covid forgot, or actually forgot covid. Even the very basic hygiene uninforced by disinterested staff. They do think it is a great idea though to have buffet breakfest, and have half the hotel waiting in a cue to get the the window of the kitchen for a few ladels of gruel. Covid doesn't do breakfast they must assume,  nor does this hotel. Like a prison at chow time. Lastly, don't expect anything quick in this hotel. If avoiding your gaze were an olympic sport then the staff here are all former gold medalists. They will actively do anything to avoid getting the hassle of having to spek to you. Two lunches, two dinners and two breakfast's and not once were we asked if everything was all right or more tea etc. And if we wanted a further drink we just got up and made for the lest unsuspecting member of staff and pounched on them before they could make good their escape. Over priced hotel, not 4 star, could be good with the right management and spending a few quid on the rooms.",2,2021,07,20
223,Night Off,"We really enjoyed our night in Castleknock, the staff are so friendly and accommodating. I had requested a view of the golf course, no problem. the restaurant staff were efficient, calm and friendly. We had lunch, dinner & breakfast all were very good quality with complimentary glasses of prosecco after dinner. The atmosphere in the hotel was relaxed and light, the weather was very sunny and hot, the extra touches of sun cream/ sun glasses at the back terrace was a great bonus to us and very well thought out.  I'd highly recommend a stay here.",5,2021,07,20
223,Brilliant stay,"Really helpful and friendly staff 
Hotel in a beautiful location 
Food and beverages were lovely 
Swimming pool and golf course on site which was amazing 
Overall would come back in a heartbeat 
Would recommend to couples, families or business stay ",5,2021,07,20
223,Worth a try,Lovely and big modern hotel.  We had a suite  which was large but not huge. Air conditioning on but useless as not in correct place. Food great although a bit slow on service.  Whole hotel worth a visit.  Need car to get there as not on main road. Would I stay again........yes. ,4,2021,07,20
223,"Lovely Hotel, exceptionally friendly staff","Hotel is so clean and pleasant to be in
Rooms are sufficient 
Outside Area is lovely 
Staff sre so friendly 
Will definitely return
We live in Dublin , we didn't want to travel far as we were limited to time but its location feels like you are further from home",5,2021,07,19
223,Excellent family hotel,"Stayed for one night package deal with my daughter and mother. Very family friendly hotel, the playground on site is lovely, the grounds are equally lovely for the little ones to play in. Felt really confident and safe with all the covid protocols in place. There was an abundance of staff constantly cleaning and all were very friendly and helpful. We managed to squeeze in a swim also and the leisure facilities were spotless also. Food was fantastic, again esp with little ones, the dinner buffet for them is super. Lovely hotel, great value for money, will look forward to a return visit soon, and will also recommend to friends and family. ",5,2021,07,18
223,Staycation,"Had a lovely 2 nights stay at this beautiful hotel . From check in to , dining , pool attendance to housekeeping everyone was so friendly and helpful. The location is perfect . Would recommend this hotel to anyone . ",5,2021,07,18
223,Would highly recommend,"We‚Äôve stayed there twice now we haven‚Äôt been disappointed on either occasion. Great food, drink, facilities and staff. It‚Äôs close enough to Dublin for easy access but also far enough out for a run down the country ",5,2021,07,16
223,Staycation,"Great hotel, family friendly.  Swimming pool and play park for little ones to enjoy.  Food and service top class.  Rooms are comfortable, with all the  amenities needed plus smart tv with Netflix app- bonus.  There is no air conditioning in the room but they do provide a fan in the room, which is needed especially in the current heat. Will definitely be back ",5,2021,07,16
223,Best Hotel experience ,"I Stayed at Castleknock Hotel for our friend's belated birthday treat. The Hotel is beautiful and the rooms were spotless. The food was fabulous but the stand out for me  was the service!! from the housekeeping staff who helped with wifi issues just because they heard us chatting about it to the Restraunt staff who went above and beyond. At lunch Eoin was our server. He was so warm and friendly always making sure we had all we needed. At Dinner we had Illeana serve us and she literally bent over backwards to make sure all 5 of the people in our party was looked after.  5* service and an amazing experience. Hope to come back soon
",5,2021,07,15
223,"A beautiful hotel, with great staff","We booked the Moments Missed package because our friend was 60 in May, but we couldn't celebrate it then. 

From the moment we walked in to the hotel we were treated so well. 

When we went it to our rooms there was baloons, prosecco and chocolates set out for us. It was such a lovely touch and the birthday girl was thrilled.

All of the staff were so polite and helpful but Iliana and Eoin in the restaurant went out of their way to make our visit special, nothing was a problem to them. The food was beautiful both for lunch and dinner and we throughly enjoyed ourselves. 
The whole hotel had a great atmosphere around it and we can't wait to go back for our next visit.",5,2021,07,15
223,Fabulous staff and food. Ramona the on duty manager is fantastic.,"We stayed at the hotel for 2 nights and I can not recommend it enough. Everything about it is warm and welcoming, the staff are outstanding. Never have I been on holiday that not one thing was a problem. From the minute you check in at reception you feel you are in your best friends house.  All staff, no mater what, are pleasant and passionate about making your stay the best it can be.  The food and choice of drinks are excellent and the restaurants are beautifully decorated. Thanks to Ramona the on duty manager for being such a lady to us. Hope to be back soon.xx",5,2021,07,15
223,Average,"Lovely rooms, very spacious and massive bed. However robes were missing and there was hair clips with hair attached on the floor. Great view from our room. Lovely bathroom very clean. The food was probably a 5/10 as it wasn‚Äôt cooked properly. Despite not eating it we were charged full price. We ordered drinks to our rooms but they never arrived. Twice. ",3,2021,07,15
223,Birthday,Fabulous room so comfortable food and service excellent would highly recommend this hotel best breakfast I ever had. Shower and bath ensuite shampoo and shower gels available also. Hairdryer in room also.,5,2021,07,15
223,Fabulous Hotel,"Loved everything about this hotel. It was spotless, room 
was fab and had two great nights sleeps. The staff were so friendly and helpful. The food from the restaurant was amazing. It was our first time away pre covid and I was abit nervous. But they had a great system in place regarding covid regulations. We will definitely be going back again soon. ",5,2021,07,15
223,Excellent,Highly recommend. Good location for the zoo and Dublin city centre with good facilities.Friendly and helpful staff.Also the food was good. I would definitely go back again in the future. All round a good hotel.                 ,5,2021,07,15
223,Family holiday,The only thing disappointing with this hotel is the food at dinner and as there is no indoor dining in the south of Ireland yet we had to eat in the hotel if I went back and restrictions were lifted I would eat else where ,5,2021,07,15
223,Lovely stay at Castleknock,"We had a fabulous stay at the hotel for two nights. The rooms were very well equipped with everything we needed and the facilities-gym, pool, outdoor area-were really fantastic. A great place to stay for families and couples alike. All the staff I encountered were more than helpful and very friendly-no request was too much. We will definitely be back!",4,2021,07,14
223,Incredible Terrace experience,"Visited the Terrace with friend recently and I could not get over the incredible service provided by our waitress Zada. The service she provided was of a very high standard, making sure the whole table was taken care of throughout the night. I could not recommend the Terrace enough because of this. I will be sure to be back again soon!",5,2021,07,13
223,"Way too packed, didn't feel COVID safe, rooms too hot","Had an overnight for a family event. Hotel was packed, no social distancing in lobby or restaurant areas, I didn't feel safe AT ALL. Room was mediocre - wallpaper peeling off the wall, beds jammed in so bedside lockers were put in sideways and the beds were blocking the plug sockets. Double bed was two mattresses pushed together. Room had been sprayed with an awful air freshener which gave me a migraine. Heating was on so room was way too hot. No air conditioning. Had to sleep with windows and curtains open and a fan which only provided minimal relief. Service in the lobby area was extremely slow. We had a fantastic waiter in the restaurant but he was hampered by slow hotel service, wines not being in stock (had to come back to us 3 times to choose another bottle) etc. Would not go there again. Might be good if you have kids as there were millions of them running around screaming and not supervised. Not a good experience as a couple.",2,2021,07,13
223,Pamper Package,"Great experience on our overnight stay, wonderful pamper package, very friendly and helpful staff. Set up in the hotel was great for Covid-19. Would definitely return to this hotel again in the future. ",5,2021,07,13
223,Terrace Experience,"Staff could not have been nicer, cocktails on the menu were all fabulous and the service was incredible, special mention to Zada and Hannah who made our evening! Two lovely employees, will definitely be returning solely for the service we received!",5,2021,07,12
223,Incredible service from Zada..,"Visited with friends for some food and drinks at the outdoor terrace, incredible service especially from our waitress Zada, was very attentive and made our night extremely enjoyable, would recommend asking for her when visiting! 5 stars",5,2021,07,12
223,Family stay,Fabulous family stay. We had a great staycation here in Castleknock. Great location for exploring Dublin. Food and service were great. Paul in particular should get a special mention for his meticulous attention to detail and exceptional service. He truly went over and above to help us have a memorable dining experience.,5,2021,07,12
223,Drinks at The Terrace,"Myself and a few friends visited The Terrace as a celebration. We tried nearly every cocktail on the menu between us and loved them all! The staff were brilliant, so helpful and attentive. Overall extremely well managed by the Terrace manager Darragh who welcomed us upon arrival. Will definitely be returning.",5,2021,07,12
223,Family stay,"Great night in the Castleknock Hotel, staff were really friendly and service was brilliant. Drinks service in the lobby was a bit slow and the bed rooms were very warm and no air con but other then that i when highly recommend ",4,2021,07,12
223,Wonderful stay,"Hotel was superb from start to finish. Very safe Covid protocols in place, excellent friendly staff who are clearly very happy working there. Comfortable rooms. We were so pleased with our stay which was excellent value too! ",5,2021,07,12
223,Great but some improvements needed,It was a great experience from our spa treatments to trips to the pool but only downside is drinks at evening very pricey and when our evening meal arrived a drink spilled and the staff weren‚Äôt very helpful with replacing it (didn‚Äôt even offer) so I had to pay for a drink I couldn‚Äôt even enjoy. Makes it look like they‚Äôre just all about the money so it takes away from the rest of the great experiences your hotel has to offer,4,2021,07,11
223,Enjoyable couples stay,"We stayed in a Junior suite for our recent wedding anniversary and we had a brilliant time. It was a nice touch to has the Swan towels and rose petals on our bed. I think the contactless check in and out was great. The pool could maybe do with a system like this where you can book your slot, however the guy on reception at the pool was great in allowing us to wait in our room and called when there was availability. We ate in the restaurant which was a bit pricey but the food was delicious and the service was second to none. Very attentive staff. We ordered breakfast to the room that was still very hot when it arrived. Will definitely return. ",5,2021,07,11
223,Lunch at the 'Terrace' restaurant !,"Absolute DISASTER and disgraceful show of terrible management.   It was obvious the two waitress girls were new to the position and environment , who had been very badly trained, if at all .  It seemed like on job training, as a manager popped his head out every 15 minutes , mostly to carry out their duties , clearing tables , taking orders , putting cutlery out etc.   That was all just about acceptable , as every one has to start somewhere.  But not 2 together, on one shift, in an new venture.  
However the absolute unacceptable thing, however was the vile food they served.  I had the pate and there is no way anyone can convince me the Chef or management, has sat at one of their tables and would order this.    Which and I wish I was exaggerating, was akin to what my cat would bring up after too much kitikat and with that exact consistency too.  Accompanied with teeth breaking shop bought ""sour dough croutes ""  and a scraping on side of the plate of ""sticky bacon jam""  ( think bacon flavored Lidl hummus) the rest of the plate was full of watercress with no dressing . 
 My wife had the Terrace salad. 2/10.  Both washed down with 2 glasses of NZ Sauv Blanc @ ‚Ç¨10.50 per glass ( to buy a bottle of ""Walnut Block Sauvignon Blanc"" in a Vintners is ‚Ç¨8.99- ‚Ç¨9.99 )  M/up 400% , seriously !!
This was certainly An outdoor Dining Experience and one that I will never repeat.  Shame on the Managers and Chef .  You would have expected in this climate , that customers and quality should come first.  Clearly not in this case . 
  We stayed in another FBD hotel recently , The Faithlegg in Waterford and the food was , a below average 6/10.  So maybe this is a budget issue , within the group.",1,2021,07,11
223,A good family hotel,"Food is excellent and facilities are good for families. Not much to do without a car in the area and, bar the excellent gym and spa, there is not much to do in the hotel, particularly for young children. Pool demand is high so would recommend midday when quiet.",3,2021,07,10
223,Amazing staff,"This trip was for one night to celebrate my sister's birthday and I couldn't compliment the hotel enough,  we were lucky to have an early check in, great surprise for my sister in the room of cake, balloon and prosecco, to the lovely robes and slippers. The facilities in the hotel and above all the staff, the staff alone would bring me back. Our dinner and the restaurant was beautiful.  The whole trip felt like a few days away and it was just one night. Be back soon ",5,2021,07,09
223,Beautiful hotel to visit but would reconsider,"Found that the hotel was overpriced based on quality and service. Room was poor- marked furniture, dust thick on tv which really doesn‚Äôt sit right with covid. Holes in net curtains and stains on carpet. ",3,2021,07,09
223,Amazing hotel,One of the nicest hotels we‚Äôve stayed in.  Very family friendly.  Very COVID safe.  Staff were more than helpful.  Decor of hotel is just beautiful. Swing park for kids was great.  The swimming pool is fantastic. ,5,2021,07,09
223,Family Break,We recently stayed at the Castleknock Hotel Resort. An excellent hotel with great procedures in place for Covid as you can see that major investment was made on making the hotel safe for customers. We really enjoyed the meal in the hotel with a great choice in dishes for both ourselves and our children. Breakfast is a buffet style with plenty of options. The hotel is located close to many amenities such as Dublin Zoo. My daughter really enjoyed the playground and both my enjoyed the swimming pool which you can see is managed to a high standard with plenty of Lifeguard cover and extremely clean facilities. Overall an excellent stay and will return,5,2021,07,08
223,Fantastic stay,"We had a fantastic time from start to finish. All staff were amazing, friendly and so helpful. We enjoyed every minute of it and would love to stay again soon. Already recommended to family and friends",5,2021,07,08
223,Excellent hotel,Beautiful hotel on lovely grounds. Very friendly staff & excellent facilities. Everything is very well socially distanced so felt very safe in these Covid times. I will be returning again very soon üòä,5,2021,07,08
223,Covid clean and yet super friendly,A great break with helpful staff and friendly and accommodating at all times . Everything was very Clearly explained before and during the visit and would highly recommend to families and couples alike ,5,2021,07,07
223,Amazing experience,"5 star for the ""Time for two"" package for couples. 
Two nights with breakfast included, three course dinner the first night and chill out hamper the second night. Very nice and helpful staff. Only thing sometimes you wait a bit too long to get a drink and music was missing in the restaurant during dinner (or too low). The room was great, we got upgraded to an executive room and the sleep quality was unbelievable, you could not hear a noise from outside, we had a view on the golf field and the bathroom had a bathtub and a shower. Everything seemed new and very clean. The chill out hamper was lovely it came with pop corns, nachos crisps, three different dips and a bowl of jellies and chocolate (even though they were cooking chocolate bits that you're not really attracted to eat!). Swimming pool is very nice and bright, with sauna and Jacuzzi over all it was a great stay and will definitely be back.",5,2021,07,07
223,Amazing Hotel,"Lovely hotel with exception staff.  From the Covid Officer on arrival to the Waiter in the Restaurant, all were very helpful and friendly.  The food in the restaurant was exceptional and the kids menu was extensive. Online checkout was also welcome with no waiting time as a result. Disappointing not to get to use the pool facilities due to capacity issues but a small blip in an overall great experience. ",5,2021,07,06
223,1 night June stay,"This was our 3rd stay here. We got a good deal for a Saturday night. Room was good maybe a little hot but had a great view of the golf course. Dinner and breakfast was good and the staff were brilliant. The pool area was good and kept well clean. Only down side was how long it took to get a drink when in the lobby area,   25 mins spoke to the manager and he apologized for the delay. I'd give it a 4.5 and would stay again.",4,2021,07,06
223,Room was way too hot!,"The heat in the room was stifling! We walked around with near nothing on us, and lay in the bed at night with not even a sheet on. We couldn‚Äôt even relax or spent any sort of time in the bedroom. Absolutely ruined our stay. Also we are a same sex couple celebrating our anniversary and I specifically booked a double room. At check in we were given a room with two single beds. We had to drag our luggage back downstairs and explain our reasons for needing a double to the girl at check in. Not very nice on your anniversary! ",2,2021,07,06
223,Family trip,"Enjoyed stay with no complaints
Good service all around
Nice main meals with lovely midday snacks
Pleasent staff and very helpful
Would have no problem revisiting at a future date
Outdoor dining also a welcome plus",5,2021,07,06
223,A little pricey-but a great stay!,"I love this place!  As we haven't been able to travel home within the past year because of Covid, several times we have indulged ourselves to a few weekends at the hotel.  

It is a little pricey, you will need to upgrade if you would like breakfast, (although there are alot of options at the buffet breakfast, I find the buffet isn't of the same high quality as the restaurant, but I'd say that is typical of a buffet style and it works for the hotel)  You can get different deals booking online and it tends to be cheaper if you can stay throughout the week.

We have had some small issues, for e.g. on our last stay we did have problems with a bad TV connection.  Unfortunately although we tried to get someone to come to the room to have a look, they didn't follow through with this.  We have also called for room service when we were feeling lazy!  Again, unfortunately when ordering coffees, we found they arrived rather cold.  We made do and we could have pursued these issues further, but it didn't take away from how much we enjoyed the stay.

We've stayed in a standard double room and deluxe, even if you're on a tight budget, the standard room was excellent.  

Great facilities, it's a real treat deciding whenever you want, you can go for a swim!  The gym facilities are great too.   I've used the Spa once and it was wonderful.  There is also a lovely looking golf course as far as golf courses go, but I'm not a golfer!  There are plenty of facilities onsite, but to explore more of what Dublin has to offer you would need transport.  Coolmine train station is fairly close to the hotel.  Trains run regularly into the city from there.

The hotel has a great atmosphere and I have enjoyed the many times I've visited there, not just to stay.  I've found the few times when there has been a mistake with an order, it was been rectified quickly, the staff have been genuinly pleasant and friendly which is much appreciated.

All in all, if you are looking for somewhere to unwind and over indulge, I'd definitely recommend Castleknock Hotel.",4,2021,07,05
223,Castleknock not to be knocked,Would recommend but obviously Covid-19 restrictions make any trip less pleasureful staff excellent did their best in the limited circumstances Would like to visit again when more freedom spacious and location superb,4,2021,07,05
223,Fantastic!,"Stayed for 3 nights in a wonderful family room 2 adults, 3 children.
What a fabulous hotel. Food and service was brilliant. The staff in all departments were very attentive. Nothing was too much trouble. 
Lovely pool and small playground overlooked by the bar terrace.
Ideal hotel and I would highly recommend.
Can't wait to stay again in the future.",5,2021,07,04
223,Great staff ,"Every member of staff went above and beyond for us, so friendly and great service! our waiter at dinner, Eoin was particularly helpful!
We couldn't fault anything, both dinner and breakfast were very tasty! 
We used the spa/pool area and it too was lovely. 
We will definitely be back!! ",5,2021,07,04
223,"Delicious food, good value, unsure of covid safety","Dinner was delicious and our waiter was excellent, so friendly and helpful! 
The rooms were lovely. Very clean. Most staff throughout our stay were so nice and welcoming.

However, the next morning, breakfast was a disaster I do not understand why there is no booking system. We arrived for breakfast to be told we had to put our names down and wait. We waited 25 minutes in the lobby while we watched many others queue up and do the same. This resulted in large groups gathered in the lobby and no social distance in the queue. When we were seated staff seemed hurried and frustrated. The breakfast was loud and chaotic. We had to queue then for hot food which again was not socially distanced and was a large number of strangers gathered together. It was messy and was not covid safe. I couldn't get my head round it, considering the hotel has huge covid protocol signs in the lobby, express check in/out, sinks for hand washing in public spaces and so on. Staff member told me it was just the way they do it. ",3,2021,07,02
223,Lovely 2 night getaway,"We recently stayed for 2 nights with their Hamper package. We upgraded to a Deluxe and was well worth it to have air con and a fridge in the room. 
Good variety on the menus and service for the most part was good apart from the lobby one evening.
Spa treatments were fantastic and well worth it. 
The hamper was delivered exactly on time and had a lovely variety of treats and Prosecco. 
We found all the staff were very friendly and Covid regulations in place and abided by.",4,2021,07,01
223,Castle knock,"Too expensive for 1 night stay with no breakfast included ! I always stayed at the property for both business and pleasure, some staff were rude but I know some people have bad days , over all most staff were so helpful and honest( agreeing with pricing is too extreme) 

For someone who is in the hotel industry I am very impressed with your covid 19 measures but  I think for the lack of facilities and areas to walk on grounds , it is too expensive ",2,2021,06,30
223,Fantastic stay,"We have just returned home after a wonderful 2 night stay. From the moment we pulled into the carpark we knew we had made a good choice. A warm greeting at reception and we made our way to our room  which was spacious and very well laid out. We ate both nights in the hotels restaurants and our food was delicious...highly recommend the chicken wing starters, the burgers are huge and the cheesecake is the best I have ever tasted. Special mention must go to Eoin who attended to our every need and he is a credit to the hotel...he is 5*. All in all a fantastic few days and already planning our next visit. Thankyou to each and every member of staff.",5,2021,06,30
223,Fantastic stay,"Would recommend this hotel. Such a beautiful hotel,extremely clean terrace and outdoor seating very nice..Room was so nice ...the only complaint we would have was selection on set menu but food was nice .",5,2021,06,30
223,Excellent Hotel,"Excellent experience from check in (superb Front Office Manager), great waiting staff (friendly, chat-full) - Food top class. C-19 protocols are excellent and makes you feel extra safe. You couldn't ask for a better hotel. ",5,2021,06,30
223,Sunday night stay,"Sunday night away with a friend. really enjoyed. Great deal and food and drink excellent. 
We had a massage, very nice. Bathroom in rooms a little dated, but good shower. Was quite noisy   During night as hotel was busy but great trip overall. Will be rebooking ",4,2021,06,30
223,Welcoming Hotel,"Spent one night here with my family, convenient to Dublin zoo. We found all staff extremely friendly & efficient. Special mention to Paul in the restaurant who was so friendly & attentive. We enjoyed a very tasty 3 course meal in the restaurant, breakfast was also good quality. I would certainly recommend this hotel, also it contains beautiful grounds. We would definitely stay here again on a trip to Dublin.",4,2021,06,30
223,Excellent service & great value,"The staff are very professional and friendly. They do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable. The rooms are very comfortable and the facilities are excellent. I would recommend this hotel to anyone - a couple or a family, all are catered for. ",5,2021,06,29
223,Exceptional Stay,"I cannot recommend this hotel enough.
Seamless and friendly check-in and Covid-19 briefing on arrival.
Stunning property, delicious breakfast that did not require booking nor did the pool which made for a very enjoyable experience. 
Staff were exceptional and I will 100% return. ",5,2021,06,29
223,Great hotel and lovely staff,"The hotel is really lovely, food is great and the staff are really helpful and friendly. The rooms (I had an executive) is large and the beds are very comfortable. There was no fridge in the room which is something I would expect but this didnt impact my experience. The COVID safety measures in the hotel were really great too and made us feel really safe",4,2021,06,29
223,Excellent Hotel,"Excellent hotel with wonderful staff and service, Will definitely be back in the near future. Also the pool and facilities around the hotel was great for the kids and helpfulness of the staff to us parents was brilliant throughout our stay.
The Hotel was in a great location handy to Dublin Zoo and Blanchardstown Centre !!",5,2021,06,28
223,Disappointed,"A beautiful hotel but in our experience poor service from staff. I had to place my order twice and one time three times before my drink was brought out. 
We got told to ring down to the swimming pool about an hour before and when we went down it very busy and not a large pool to have so much people especially with COVID which was strange because everywhere else in the hotel they took COVID very serious and that was nice to see. 

The shower door was extremely hard to open and close and was very stiff not quite sure if it was just in my room or every shower door is the same but was very frustrating. 

It‚Äôs a lovely location and while the staff is friendly they are hard to get service from. Dinner was nothing to rave about. Can‚Äôt say I‚Äôd recommend but definitely isn‚Äôt a bad hotel by any means just not what we expected for the price.",3,2021,06,28
223,Janet Lee,"Very friendly, attentive staff. Food was fantastic. Had afternoon tea. Great value and absolutely delicious. Fan in bedroom was a welcome item given the warm weather!! Rooms wer spacious. Lovely big lobby area for sitting in. ",5,2021,06,27
223,Family get away,Be very careful when booking. Look at there packages as we paid ‚Ç¨550 for a family package and could of got near enough the same deal for ‚Ç¨250 at the time of booking. Prices have changed since but worth keeping an eye on. ,3,2021,06,27
223,Wonderful stay,Stayed recently with a group of friends and had a wonderful time. The hotel is beautiful . The rooms are comfortable and spotlessly clean.  The food in the restaurant was excellent.  Would definitely stay again.,5,2021,06,27
223,Overall great experience,"Brill overall great experience except issue with dinner, as was waiting for ages starters came out came out cold and 10 mins apart, main course came tenders were burnt, and onions were left of stake but were requested everything else was perfect ",3,2021,06,27
223,Great hotel,Really enjoyed our 2 night stay. Staff were amazing. Our room overlooking the golf course was great. Very good value. Would definitely go back and use the Spa and pool etc. We have recommended the hotel to others. ,5,2021,06,27
223,Fantastic and very enjoyable.,"I would like to commend all the staff and management of the Castleknock Hotel for providing myself and my family with such a relaxed and enjoyable stay.

From check in to check out every one we encountered could not have been more helpful and professional.

The accommodation department was so well managed and the entire Hotel spotless. All covid signs were well positioned, clean and very clear.

It is hard to single out individuals, however the  General Manager Guy Thomson runs an excellent operation and show great leadership.

I also want to thank the restaurant manager Mohamed and the Bar Manager Andre Sherlock for displaying such focused customer care. I watched them both work under great pressure and remain cool, calm and at all times focused on the customer.

Finally all of the operation was lead by a chap called Syed Rizvi.  I can not praise this individual enough and he is a great example of what Irish Hotel hospitality is famous for. A real professional who seemed never to go home and wes always there talking to the customer and giving assistance to his team.

Finally just to say that not only will I return but In will ensure all my family and friends are told of this gem and I will encourage all to visit and experience the wonderful facility and people that is Castleknock Hotel.",5,2021,06,26
223,Not up to standard,"From check in it was a bad start, we were told if we were paying in cash they needed 100 euro deposit we were not told this in super value break . Our room was very noisy we were over a part where staff were talking and bottles being thrown out the windows didn't drown out the noise at all. We had to get up to get breakfast which means we were walking around many people and during covid times I think this is dangerous.  We had dinner outside which was beautiful but waited nearly an hour  to be served and that's only because we called staff. Food was lovely but overall its not a place I would visit again.",1,2021,06,25
223,Restaurant,"Stayed in hotel recently with friends everything was lovely.  We had meal in restaurant and service was excellent.  We were looked after by a lovely  waitress called Clodagh.   She was,so friendly and helpful.  She was,very attentive without been overly so.  Was,a,lovely break.",5,2021,06,24
223,Food was great‚Ä¶the rest was just above average.,"Following an amazing takeaway order during lockdown I decided to purchase an overnight package for my girlfriends birthday so we could have a meal and a few drinks inside.

Our 3 course meal in the Earth & Vine restaurant was great. The dinner inclusive menu had a great selection. Thai Fish Cakes and Chicken Wings (reasonably hot as per menu states Homemade Hot Sauce, great portion size would do 2) went down a threat to start. Sirloin steak was a bit over cooked for Medium-Well, although the meat quality and taste made up for it. Salted Caramel (happily very light) Chocolate Brownie and Eton Mess were very good. Overall, service from Paul was very good - professional and a bit of craic!

Very strict on last call at 11pm asked for 1 pint shortly after which was refused by a waitress that subsequently another colleague facilitated.

Returning to the room then was a bit disappointing booking a Superior Room for a couple - we don‚Äôt want a family room i.e another single bed in the room we would prefer the extra space. Room (204) was close to unbearable with the heat in it. I think this may be due to it being close to a roof area. Bottle of Prosecco was left in an ice bucket that all the ice had melted upon arrival - disappointing. In 2021, a plug in fan is unacceptable for a hotel of this standard. Having to leave it on for the duration of our stay wasn‚Äôt pleasant. Beds were fairly hard (but this is a personal preference). Duvet seemed to have a zip midway.

Breakfast - delighted to be sat in the Earth & Vine away from all children. Although service wasn‚Äôt as attentive as I would of expected. Food selection was good, quality was very good for a fry. Well set up for covid measures. Juices and milk should be kept on top off more often to ensure they don‚Äôt run out.

Pool was a nice resource in the morning - man on reception very friendly and facilitating given we hadn‚Äôt a ‚Ç¨1 coin for the lockers. Unfortunately families with young took up most of the space in the pool which left little room to swim. (I noted there were adult only hours - these should be better communicated to guests). Also a group of women took the jacuzzi for close to an hour I‚Äôd say (should be monitored and moved on especially with covid to allow other guests use). Great being able to use the sauna.

Overall, visit again for food but not sure about stay.",3,2021,06,24
223,‚ÄúSolid‚Äù Night Sleep,"Brick hard beds and was just 2 single beds pulled together and no mattress topper to join them like some other places use. When you finally get to your room and fall onto your bed I wasn‚Äôt expecting to near put my back out.

I offered to pay extra to upgrade to a suite as it was my wife‚Äôs birthday only to be informed that all beds where the same. 

Pool facilities were ok but the hot tub bubble lasted 2 minutes and then you had to walk a few meters out of the jacuzzi to press the button again, not exactly the most relaxing, especially when all others I have ever used where along the top of the hot tub itself. 

Only positive was our server at dinner couldn‚Äôt do enough to help us and really turned around the rest of the experience. His name was Rhuadri (I may have butcher it) and he was polite and attentive and nothing was too much hassle. Give that man a pay rise. üòÄ
",3,2021,06,24
223,"Nice, clean, staff need to have a bit more customer service ","We arrived and checked in nicely and went straight to our room. The room was really nice and clean. Load of towels and bathrobes. A huge bathroom which was a plus. Booked dinner for 7:45 but the host wasn't nice at all. We ordered chicken wings for starters but we're not nice at all. Sour taste and my server didn't ask why I didn't touch it, she said she will mention it to the chef but no manager came to the table to apologise or even offer something else. 
It took also along time for the server even to take our drink order. Was a bit disappointed 
Breakfast next morning  was really delicious with an extra cost of 8euro each for room service. 
We got spa treatments and my girl at the spa Lauren was so nice and offered me tea and coffee and water when I got my mani and pedi done. 
We might come back maybe. ",3,2021,06,23
223,Great place and even better people,"My friend and I did a package deal for a night to celebrate a belated birthday and the highlight of our stay was our server for dinner - Paul. He was so delightful, friendly, and helpful. I‚Äôve never had such fantastic service, he really made the evening for us. Second to Paul, the next best thing were the cocktails. They were so delicious and very generous - highly recommend.",5,2021,06,23
223,Excellent staff,"Love this hotel! Staff are really fantastic especially Paul and Raul! Really looked after us for our stay! The outdoor area is particularly stunning, the cocktails are also a must have! The rooms are really comfortable and the food is also very good üòä",5,2021,06,21
223,Fantastic Hotel,"Just literally back from a 2 night stay here.

Words fail me - an absolutely fantastic stay and thank you to each and everyone involved.   Staff  Food and Facilities were just fantastic.   

Have stayed here twice before but was so pleasantly surprised of how Hotel has been refurbished -  rooms were really gorgeous.

Thank you all

Bernadette Egan",5,2021,06,20
223,Fabulous stay,"Me and my 3 friends stayed at the castleknock hotel to celebrate finishing college. It was absolutely fabulous could not fault it one bit. The room was so clean and the even added some chocolates congratulating us! The dinner was fabulous, Paul served us - he was so helpful and great crack! For our desert he asked the chef to put candles in all of our deserts for celebrating! I ordered the fish cake, pasta alfredo and the brownie and was all fabulous!
TIP- it was the best brownie I have ever had!!",5,2021,06,18
223,Castleknock hotel,I visited the castleknock hotle on the 14th off june with my boyfriend our baby and we were greeted by a woman called  trish and i have to say she is the most pleasant woman. Made our stay at the castleknock really enjoyable,5,2021,06,18
223,Awful Follow Up,"We had an enjoyable stay, Paul in the restaurant was lovely but it all went wrong after check out. As we got home I realised I left my phone charger behind the room, I rang the hotel straightaway. The girl I spoke to asked could I come back and get it,which was not an option. She then took my details and said they would post it and I told her I was happy to pay for postage. I offered to send an email with my address and she also said their email doesn‚Äôt accept outside emails, which I found very strange.

This was on Friday, by Tuesday I‚Äôd no word back to sent an email, and had to resend it on Thursday.",1,2021,06,17
223,"Great stay, brilliant service","Castleknock was a beautiful stay. From the room, to the sauna, to the restaurant. We had the pleasure of having a Eoin as our waiter for dinner. He was kind, friendly and went above and beyond what was expected of him. He made our dining experience one to remember.",5,2021,06,15
223,Great stay,"We had a lovely 1 night stay in the hotel. The room was spacious and clean, fantastic swimming pool. The highlight was the dinner in the restaurant- the food was very good and our waiter Andrei was outstanding. 
The only small criticism would be the heat in the room at night.  No air con and the room was extremely warm even with wide open windows. But we will visit again soon",5,2021,06,14
223,Once again verry happy,"We have a daughter living in the area .Although we could not have our daughter into hotel for dinner the hotel recommended Rudys in Blanchardstown Very good.

Room so good and bed to die for. Breakfast in a very elegant roomlooking out on gardens and golf club.",5,2021,06,13
223,Stay,Brilliant experience in Castleknock. Food was excellent and served brilliantly by Eoin. His service was fantastic and the friendly atmosphere made us all feel at ease especially in these times. We  definitely will be back for another stay soon!,5,2021,06,10
223,Teething issues,"Upon arrival I was advised I would need to pay although, I had already paid Agoda.com in full. I dvised the hotel receptionist of this and attempted to show her my booking and payment on my phone but can only assume due to the large que waiting at check-in she simply wished to process quickly advising me that the hotel had not recieved any payment and therefore I would need to pay again and take up a dispute with the booking agent. Following her advice, I immediately contacted the booking agent and still continue to do so in attempt to resolve the issue which has led to more time and energy wasting by no fault of my own. During dinner it seemed there was far too many staff which added to a chaotic atmosphere on a number of times we were brought the wrong food and drink. I do acknowledge the fact this was the reopening weekend after a long year however unfortunately teething issues impacted our overall experience.",3,2021,06,10
223,Lovely business stay,"Very clean hotel and excellent Covid management.  Staff are great, free parking. I was on the second floor and it is way to hot. Unfortunately there is no air con in the room I was in but even with windows open it was hard to sleep. The food is of good standard but maybe a little overpriced.  The rooms are of good size with free water and good stock of other Condiments.  Overall I would definitely stay here again. ",4,2021,06,10
223,3 star experience,"Late check in due to being ‚Äòvery busy‚Äô as all staff repeatedly said, no drinking water in room, incorrect room charges took away from whole experience. Disappointing considering we heard great things about this hotel & were really looking forward it",3,2021,06,10
223,Great Stay close to Dublin,"Shirt business trip.  Lovely quiet room overlooking golf course  very comfortable bed. Freat nights sleep.
Helpful friendly staff at reception and in the restaurant. Would definately stay here again for business trip.",5,2021,06,09
223,A super re-introduction back into normality!!,"Stayed at the Castleknock hotel on Sunday night with friends! Love the new outdoor part to have drinks after dinner! As usual the food is great in the restaurant, and highly recommend the cocktails for after! 
I didn‚Äôt have treatments booked, but the pool and jacuzzi after brekkie the next am made up for it!! 
Very relaxed stay!! 
Great service from Paul in the restaurant and Andrew from the bar. Very friendly and professional vibe as always!",5,2021,06,08
223,Nice break but average hotel.,"Checked in online and made a note that we may arrive early, arrived at the hotel about 2:15pm (check in at 4pm) knowing we were early we ordered a drink and sat in the lobby I decided to run it by reception we had arrived should the room be available and was told ‚Äújust because your checked in online doesn‚Äôt mean your room is ready‚Äù  which I found a bit rude as we were well aware of this just flagging with them we were here (not a great start) joined a rather large queue (to be expected) just before check in time at 4 and was also told our room wasn‚Äôt available as it was still being cleaned, didn‚Äôt actually end up getting in and settled until 4.30 as we got to our room it had 2 single beds not a double. Flagged this and was changed immediately which was great service. I was quite annoyed as lots of couples and families before us had gotten their rooms immediately. It was very hot on the 2nd floor including in the  room with no air con and the radiator on its highest on a 20degree + day. The pool and gym are very nice and the cocktails while a bit pricy are fab daiquiris are a must and the Castleknock Delight! The food was very average for the steak which while cooked nice was quite fatty. Last orders for drinks were about 10:45, no sound or even light music in the restaurant I‚Äôm aware of COVID regulations however there was ZERO atmosphere which was a shame. All staff bar one were amazing and so helpful nothing was too much to ask for. Such a clean hotel and complains with regulations is second to none. Enjoyable stay however I wouldn‚Äôt be rushing back.",3,2021,06,08
223,Over night stay with dinner.,Exceptional service from arrival to check out. The only small disappointment was the breakfast which is usually great. I think the overwhelming amount of guest on the first weekend back effected this.,5,2021,06,08
223,The perfect hotel,Every time I stay the experience is perfect. The rooms are spotlessly clean and I am fussy.. the staff are friendly and helpful. The food is to die for. The spa is the ultimate. I would highly recommend a stay to recharge your batteries and give you the feel good factor. ,5,2021,06,08
223,STAYCATION!!!,It was great staycatoin away from home. Absolutely love this place. We were really safe and comfortable with Covid restrictions. Room was big and spacious. Good and comfortable bed. The staff was friendly and helpful. Breakfast and lunch was amazing with a good choice.,5,2021,06,07
223,Overnight stay,We enjoyed our stay in the hotel. There was plenty of safety measures in place and sanitizer stations around. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Room was lovely bed very comfortable but my pillow was a bit too firm but that‚Äôs just a personal thing. We had a lovely view over the golf course.  We didn‚Äôt get to use the spa or  pool this time but have done in the past. Both were great.I‚Äôll definitely return. Thank you ,5,2021,06,06
223,Fantastic service from Eoin,"Food was fantastic, we were served by Eoin at the Earth & Vine restaurant and his service was phenomenal, will definitely be returning thanks to Eoin and his hospitality ! Great night overall :) the food was amazing and Eoin made sure we were looked after all night long. Can‚Äôt wait to enjoyed another weekend at the castleknock hotel!",5,2021,06,05
223,Eoin is the best,"Had such a great time, Eoin our waiter made our stay, very professional, best service I've had in a restaurant üëåthank you so much for everything Eoin you made our night very special.  Definitely recommend this hotel and the service was amazing",5,2021,06,05
223,Excellent,"I stayed at the Hotel for 2 nights 3/4th June . The Hotel had just reopened after lockdown. I can honestly say myself and my husband felt very safe . They have a great system in place .there are no shortage of hand sanitizer and even have portable sink if you don‚Äôt like to use the sanitiser . They have a screen outside the toilet door that tells you how many are in the toilet and when you can enter . It‚Äôs very very safe and the staff are constantly cleaning .. . My husband has an illness that can make him loose his balance  and he had a bad fall while in the patio area. The staff came to him immediately and helped get him up . Bringing him water and ice packs . They were so attentive and looked after him so well . The manger came to our room to make sure he was ok .  I found the staff to be more than helpful and the food was beautiful. We will most definitely be returning to the Castleknock Hotel

223,Blown away by the experience,Hotel is in a lovely location. Staff very friendly and helpful. The food was top quality. The facilities in the hotel were very good and the breakfast was excellent. The hotel was very warm throughout the stay.,5,2021,06,05
223,Amazing stay,We have just returned home from our 2 night stay as a family of 7. This hotel has done everything and more to make sure its covid safe. The staff are the most friendly and helpful we have come across on any of our hotel stays. The food was beautiful and the cocktails are devine. The terrace and patio areas are so well thought out. Kids loved the playpark and swimming pool. We cannot wait to return hopefully in the near future,5,2021,06,04
223,Excellent staff and service,"I cannot fault this hotel, even during Covid restrictions. 
Very friendly and helpful staff. 
Room was spotlessly clean. 
I didn't dine in or use the pool or gym but everything else was perfect. 
I would happily stay again post restrictions ",5,2021,05,09
223,Lucky last minute change of hotel,"I visited Castleknock by chance the usual hotel that is used by our company has been turned into a COVID quarantine hotel so was booked into the Castleknock hotel. 
Apron arrival I was greeted by some of the most friendly staff I have ever met. Nothing was to much trouble. I had a fantastic room over looking the golf course (182). As I couldn‚Äôt leave the hotel I tried most things on there menu and was not disappointed. 
Special thanks to Andrew (made the best bramble cocktail I have had) and Andre there customer service is outstanding making you feel like part of their family. 
I can‚Äôt fault the Castleknock Hotel 

",5,2021,05,09
223,Best hotel for conscious consumers and businesses,"Castleknock Hotel and its team came through with a lovely upgrade and great service during the pandemic. We were able to get a lot of essential work done with the super fast broadband and had a few good night's sleep with the blackout curtains and peaceful surroundings (including view of a swan's nest nearby). Highly recommend, especially if you or your business are consciously trying to use Irish and/or cooperative businesses. And thanks for keeping the pool and gym open. They helped loosen some lockdown muscles.",5,2021,04,21
223,Fantastic spot with even better service,"During lockdown, one of my favourite things to do is pop here for a takeaway coffee every day which is literally the best coffee in the area and my new regular spot! The service is always fantastic, so efficient and genuine! Delighted they opened up their takeaway menu as the cocktails are delicious! Really fast service and keep to social distance guidelines - thanks to everyone there :) looking forward to coming here more often when they get to open up fully!",5,2021,03,27
223,Wedding NYE 2020,"Both myself and my wife had our wedding booked for Castleknock hotel just NYE gone since October 2017. When we booked this all those years ago of course we would never imagined the pandemic that came in 2020. Although this happened we would have thought the hotel would have done all they could to reassure couples throughout this time and to help them in anyway they can. Unfortunately for us we didn't have that experience with such a reputable hotel, as a couple we felt that our wedding was an obstacle for them from down to the room and the cost. 7 weeks out from the wedding we were made aware that there would be a cost increase due to the restrictions, having a cost increase wasn't the issue, the issue was the way it was delivered and the blatent disregard to the awful situation we were already in having to cut numbers. We ultimately had to switch our wedding to another hotel, and Castleknock were very quick to hand us back our money which goes to show they never wanted to host our wedding. I would never step foot in the hotel again.",1,2021,01,05
223,Lovely stay in Castleknock Hotel,"I stayed in the Castleknock Hotel in the run up to Christmas. We stayed on the missed moments package and the little extras in the room on arrival were lovely. Overall the stay was fantastic, dinner and breakfast included and couldn‚Äôt fault a thing. Will definitely be back.",5,2020,12,30
223,Lovely Hotel - Chicken Wings are a must,"We stayed here over the Xmas period on a wee staycation.  Hotel has been renovated and looks quite well , the lights were a good addition for the Christmas Vibe ,staff were lovely and the restaurant done delicious food. If your a wing person - i definitely recommend ",4,2020,12,29
223,Brilliant family getaway,"Great family rooms, we booked adjoining rooms and the beds were massive. TVs in each room meaning we could put the kids down then watch TV. Bar service available to the room 
Good was lovely, generous portions. One kids meal was enough for two smaller kids.
Staff were lovely, fantastic service.
Felt very safe and like every precaution had been taken. Couldn't fault it.",5,2020,12,26
223,A brilliant family night away,"We went here for one night before Christmas with three children.  The service was amazing, the place was spotless with hand sanitizers placed everywhere.  The swimming pool is brilliant for kids. Robes in the room, breakfast was delishious. Highly recommend for a family getaway.",5,2020,12,26
223,Overcharged for my stay,Checked in for the hotel online and paid a total of ‚Ç¨170 and when I arrived and collected the keys they then charged me an additional ‚Ç¨200 whiteout telling me. I still haven't received a refund and the money was taken from me before Christmas. I was stressed and really didn't enjoy my stay because of this. Please fix this issue!,2,2020,12,26
223,Best hotel I‚Äôve stayed in so far,"We were so amazed and happy with our stay all of the staff were so friendly and helpful the room was lovely and so clean, we were served by a young woman named Ailbhe at dinner she was so nice and very helpful in conclusion we were very satisfied with our stay and the location and price was well worth it 

",5,2020,12,24
223,Weekend stay at Castleknock,"I stayed here with two of my friends for a girly night away and to avail of some treatments. While it was mostly good our room could have been cleaner, tea was served luke warm for breakfast and our key cards didn't work in our door after breakfast meaning we had to go back to reception to have them fixed, a small thing but also a little annoying. ",3,2020,12,23
223,No Communication / Organisation Amongst Staff,"Constantly chasing up this hotel to make sure we were booked in correctly ect impossible to get through to and sometimes rude staff. 
First off we were told a week before our stay we were not booked on the correct package (even though the website allowed us to do so) after much deliberation we finally got through to a rude member of staff that confirmed in fact we were booked in correctly after all that time. Bare in my mind I was on the phone for a considerable amount of time and I was trying to work. This is withstanding the fact we had booked correctly the whole time.
Then after confirming a time for evening meal via email upon check in, the restaurant confirmed there was no such booking. As it was a gift again I found myself trying to chase the hotel for clarity once again and had to call several times before someone picked up. The booking was subsequently put in for 9pm and the food was below standard.
I wouldn‚Äôt book again- spent so much time on the phone / chasing them even though I communicated and booked correctly the whole time.
I don‚Äôt normally give reviews like this but I don‚Äôt have all day to be sitting on the phone- it‚Äôs ridiculous, way too much hassle.",3,2020,12,22
223,Good social distancing protocols but don't charge anything to your room!!,"Social distancing was very well managed, face mask wearing well controlled and lots of cleaning going on.
We had the fixed menu in the evening ‚Ç¨40 PP good value but the stuffing with the turkey and ham was like a block and my wife found the burger so tuff she did not eat it, others in our group just weren't overly impressed at all, not bad just not good!

We charged items to our room during the stay, the hotel did not ask us to sign for the charges as they came to our tables in the bar and restaurant even though (due to past experience in other hotels) we asked to sign for items! ""Don't worry we have the items allocated correctly"" we were told, until at the end of the night they didn't and spent 20+ minutes sorting out who ordered what, very poor process for such a hotel and to be honest this killed the end of the night and put a total damper on the over all stay experience.

Also the bedrooms were like ovens, so suggest you turn off your radiator when you get into your room if you want to sleep at night, and my wife likes a worm room!

The only time I felt a little uncomfortable was queing for the buffet breakfast with others inline getting a little too close for comfort.

Will we go back, not too sure!",3,2020,12,22
223,For the price I expected more,"The free Spar services already had a full schedule for all 3 days we stayed there, that was a very big mistake, they should increase the capacity of the spar or stop talking that provide this service, since only a small portion can use it .
Breakfast was very limited, options should increase.
We like the room, one of the differentials is that the bathroom floor is heated, this is very good, but the television must be the same age as me, it hinders the experience a lot, they should buy smart TVs or a chrome cast, which is super cheap .
The pool area is very pleasant.
The staff are very attentive and polite.
I think that's it.",3,2020,12,21
223,Pre Christmas Stay,"At a time when the hospitality sector struggles to adapt and maintain service standard's in extremely challenging times, the Castleknock Hotel seems to have adapted seemlessly. A spectacular hotel with a stunning reception, lobby and bar area. The hotel is heavily staffed with any staff member we came into contact with extremely friendly and professional. The hotel is very well organized , running like clockwork. For our lunch we were attended to by Andrei. He was extremely helpful and efficient. His level of service meant we wanted for nothing. Our room was lovely and dinner was very nice. Finally, I have never seen anything like their 'covid friendly' set up, hand sanitizer on every table and hand washing stations in many locations as well a designated staff member ensuring everyones safety. A very enjoyable stay",5,2020,12,20
223,Excellent restaurant and Staff !!!!,"Went for dinner at the hotel on Fri 18th Dec. The hotel and restaurant were busy and the Covid 19 regulations were adhered to in every area. We had a drink in the lobby when we arrived and when our table was ready the host brought us through. There was a very relaxed atmosphere in the restaurant. All the waiting staff were excellent and very attentive. Things just got better as the evening went on. Every course we had was top drawer  ‚Äì prepared and cooked to perfection. During our time at the table the restaurant manager came over a few times to check if we were ok and if there was anything else we needed. After this experience of the hotel restaurant, I would have no hesitation in recommending it to everyone.",5,2020,12,19
223,amazing hotel,have a lovely stay staff were extremely welcoming in the restaurant and the service was exceptional. food was delicious and so were the cocktails. Hotel was extremely clean and very christmassy. would definitely recommend. ,5,2020,12,18
223,"Safe, clean and exceptional quality",Exceptional COVID compliance. I felt very safe and observed constant cleaning in all public areas several times an hour. The rooms were the cleanest I've ever stayed in in any hotel. Exceeded all expectations,5,2020,12,18
223,DONT EAT THE FOOD,Everything was amazing about this hotel !! Except the food was absolutely rubbish I swear I‚Äôve never had worse food in all my life and they charge through the roof for it which makes it worse because it‚Äôs absolutely awful ... we ended up going to the carpenter pub across the road where the food is absolutely gorgeous! I loved my stay here but I will never eat in the restaurant or order breakfast again ...,5,2020,12,16
223,Dinner and cocktails ,"Went for dinner on Saturday the 12th, dinner and drinks were lovely. We have fish and steak. Cocktails were amazingly The staff was really nice. Even tho the place was busy you felt safe with covid precautions they have in place. We have booked to stay the night on the 8 of January now to celebrate 30th birthday. Can‚Äôt wait. ",5,2020,12,15

Overall would recommend this hotel for familys and couples and we will definitely be back to stay again!",5,2020,12,14
223,One night spa break away,"Very comfortable stay, excellent staff, very friendly and attentive. Unfortunately food was disappointing, well presented but bland, lacked seasoning, my fish was dry and overcooked. Rooms very clean and comfortable, slept like a log. ",4,2020,12,13

I also had a relaxing massage,was the best!",5,2020,12,05
223,"Great hotel, lovely staff, extremely disappointing and expensive food","We have come here to stay after restrictions were eased and a trip to the zoo. On first impressions the hotel is very nice, all staff we have met are lovely and the pool and facilities are very good. We have just had dinner and could not be more disappointed. Firstly we wanted a bottle of rose, only two on the menu, it‚Äôs the first day of opening after 5 weeks shut but the bottle we ordered is ‚Äòout of stock‚Äô so the only option is a bottle 20 euros more. After learning to live with that we decided to push the boat out as this is a rare night away and have the fillet steaks, kids had pasta and a burger. To be totally frank, 3 out of 4 meals were a disappointment. The fillet steaks were very very average (not unpleasant but certainly not worth the 29 euro price tag for a steak with either a dollop of mash or a little bucket of fries) to the point where quite frankly we could have done them better at home. The kids burger was dry and plain - just a burger and bun. All in all while not an absolutely inedible meal, we paid a whopping 150 euros for 2 adult and 2 kids main courses (no starters) one shared desert, one bottle of wine (that was not the one we wanted), a jug of cordial and two beers. This would have been pricey but ok if everything has been ok but absolutely not when it was not. 
Genuinely I hate to complain but this has been a big disappointment. Shame on what is otherwise a nice hotel - our recommendation is not to eat here if you stay. 

Also to note the bottle of wine we were told to order if we wanted rose (due to the only other not being available) was nearly 50 euros. On typing the bottle into google you can buy it online for 11 euros (not including delivery). I‚Äôm not sure what the markup is for restaurants as I don‚Äôt expect restaurant wine to be at shop prices by any means but that feels insulting especially as it was the only bottle available after 5 weeks closed.... 

Nice hotel - not to dine at sadly

",2,2020,12,05
223,Amazing Stay,"We're just home from a lovely 2 night stay in Castleknock hotel.

The hotel have handled the current climate amazingly. We felt very safe while maintaining current guidelines. The hotel was spotless and our room was lovely. 

We ate in Earth and Vine restaurant on the first night and the bar last night. The hake was incredible and my husband had the steak which was also gorgeous. The cocktails were also out of this world too.

I especially want to mention how brilliant all of the staff were. They couldn't have done enough for us and nothing was an issue or too much. The service was excellent and thank you Stef/Stan in the restaurant last night.

We will definately return. Well done Castleknock Hotel :)",5,2020,12,04
223,Birthday package,"Great hotel amazing staff, love this hotel pool fab rooms are beautiful and spotless very close to the Zoo if you want a day out .I booked the birthday package which was a lovely touch balloon cake and a bottle of bubbly in the room on arrival.",5,2020,12,01
223,Standards dropped during pandemic,"Unfortunately, a lot of hotels are using Covid as an excuse for dropping standards and this hotel is one of them. 

For the most part their staff were friendly and very professional observing Covid guidelines to the T. However, on the Friday night on our stay the smoking area was like the smoking area in Coppers, packed with Zero social distancing. 

The staff were great at reminding people to put their masks on as they walked about the hotel and with drinks involved its going to be hard to remember to wear a mask at all times so the reminder was appreciated, however, we saw a waiter literally shout at a hotel guest about wearing a mask, so much that the guest was asking the waiter to calm down. For a hotel of any standard, I find that having staff try to intimidate guests as totally unacceptable. 

As I said, for the most part, the stay was fine but unfortunately there are a number of reasons why I won't be back and why I have given it a poor rating. ",2,2020,10,26
223,Great relaxing hotel,"One, two or even three nights you will come away relaxed from here. Staff were so helpful with helping me orangise a great birthday for my best friend, even with the restriction. Already planning to go back before the end of the year hopefully and next year too is on the cards. ",5,2020,10,22
223,Castlekncok break,Good hotel for a break in Dublin with nice facilites and excellent bar/restaurant. Only issue was hotel seems to attract a party crowd on the weekend and were kept up until 5am by a party in the room next to ours. Called security multiple times but party continued even with their intervention. Hotel was much quiter during the weekdays and very relaxing and comfortable.,4,2020,10,16
223,Highly Recommend! ,"Had a wonderful stay in Castleknock. We and some some friends stayed as a group of couples. Some golfed during the day while the rest enjoyed the spa, pool and steam room facilities. We dined in the restaurant, all covid compliant while still being a great experience. Food was fantastic and we got it included in our autumn deal so superb value. The room was excellent for the price and the Elemis products a nice touch. We really felt like we were on a holiday while only being 20mins from home. Most of the staff were exceptionally friendly and chatty. The reception staff maybe a little cooler and had a slight issue with only getting one room key. Minor blip in an otherwise great stay hence the 5/5 and will definitely return. ",5,2020,10,15
223,Lovely friendly hotel,"Great value for money, great location, staff were very friendly ,reception staff lovely, restaurant staff very efficient. Overall we had a great stay and excellent value for money. Felt covid safe also.",5,2020,10,15
223,Best staycation during Covid times!,"Went to the hotel for celebrating my partners' birthday, everything was perfect. The staff is very accomodating and friendly, pool jacuzzi spa everything was amazing! Great value for the price paid, will definitely be one of our regular go to staycations in Dublin!",5,2020,10,15

223,Really nice spa,"I brought my mam here for her birthday (due to restrictions), we booked Back To School Spa package. It was really lovely, felt very safe the whole time. Masks, Sanister everywhere. Also the toilets even have a stop/go feature like the supermarkets to ensure they aren't too busy. We then had lunch, the staff were lovely and food very tasty, we will definitely call again.",5,2020,10,13
223,Enjoyed our stay at the hotel.,We enjoyed our stay at this hotel everything from the room and the layout esp with all the new rules it was really comfortable. A special mention to covid ambassador Mycola he made us so wellcome with great conversation at reception area as we shared our stories thank you Mycola üëç your a cool chap üòé will be going back soon to enjoy the food and company üëç,5,2020,10,12
223,Wedding at the Castleknock hotel,"From the moment I pulled up in the car outside the night before the wedding, staff were outside greeting & assisting me. Everything was so clean, the best hotel I‚Äôve seen for cleanliness during Covid & I stayed in a few around Ireland. The level of cleanliness made me feel safe from the moment I checked in. 
We had a small Sunday wedding at Castleknock hotel, with total of 13 guests due to level 3 covid restrictions in Dublin. But you would never think it was a small wedding with how well we were treated. Staff on the day couldn‚Äôt of done enough for us, constantly checking in to make sure we were happy with food, decor, drinks etc. they had hand sanitizer everywhere in the room we had our meal so it made it feel very safe. 
Food was out of this world, with decent portions. So much so, by the time dessert came out, I needed a nap from the food coma LOL. Every mouthful was delicious.
Couldn‚Äôt recommend Castleknock hotel enough, the new wedding coordinator Ger was outstanding with understanding everything we envisioned for our day. On the day, someone else dealt with us (lovely gentleman can‚Äôt think of his name & later for the night Dean) but as a team everyone worked extremely hard, was so polite and friendly & made us feel so welcome & nothing was too much of an ask.
Can‚Äôt wait to stay in the hotel again.",5,2020,10,07
223,Hotel visit,I recently stayed in the Castleknock hotel and I would highly recommend the hotel.The hotel was spotless and staff very friendly and professional.The covid restrictions were adhered strictly which added to experience as it made us feel very safe.Food was lovely so a great experience alround.,5,2020,10,07
223,Lovely stay,"We stayed in the hotel as a treat following my daughter‚Äôs communion. The COVID procedures were well enforced and we felt safe. Hotel is lovely, food was nice and only problem was that the children can‚Äôt swim before 10am which is a bit annoying when they are up from first thing with swimsuits on!! Otherwise lovely stay. ",5,2020,10,06
223,Great Hotel,I would like to thank all the wonderful staff of the Castleknock hotel for making our overnight stay for our wedding anniversary so special. The attention and care we were shown from the time we arrived was exceptional and went beyond our expectations. We had an amazing meal and a wonderful stay.,5,2020,10,05
223,Fantastic hotel with brilliant staff and facilities,"Myself and my partner stayed in the hotel for my birthday last week and could not fault our stay whatsoever. The room was gorgeous, the swimming pool was brilliant with great safety measures in place. Most importantly, the food and the service in the bar/restaurant from Andrew and his team were out of this world. We will definitely be going back for another stay.",5,2020,10,05
223,Used to be better,"Can I start by saying this is a really great hotel but it seems COVID has forced a change in standards. The food is normally lovely, really top class but it seems due to COVID they are preparing a lot of the food in advance meaning its luke warm when it comes out with a partial stale skin on the food, the breakfast has also suffered and is closer to 3 star quality. Because only guests can eat in the restaurant there seems to be a rush to get the table back. Our main landed about 60 seconds after our starter giving no time to relax and enjoy the meal. The staff though are to really great, they never remove their masks even though it can't be easy working a 10 hour shift constantly behind a mask. I would recommend this hotel but its not what it used to be",3,2020,10,04
223,Such a wonderful hotel,"Just home from a wonderful nights stay. From start to finish everything was exceptional. Our room was spotless, big and with such comfortable beds. ! Our dinner in the bar / restaurant 22 was gorgeous. The waiting staff were very friendly and efficient. The swimming pool was spotless and warm. The thing the stood out most was the friendliness and efficiency of the staff. They are a credit to the hotel. Thanks for a wonderful stay. ",5,2020,10,04
223,One night staycation,"Just back from a very enjoyable one night stay. Staff were professional
And friendly. Room very nicely furnished and bottle of wine and chocolates on arrival a lovely touch. Comfortable beds lovely toiletries and seperate bath and shower made for a very comfortable stay. Dinner was good, nice cocktails and service with a smile. Breakfast was great too. All covid precautions in place. We will be back. Well done to all at castleknock Hotel",4,2020,10,02
223,Great value and lovely hotel,"Hotel standard lovely, staff very nice. Room not same standard as rest of hotel and disappointing comparison. Saying that I would stay again. Food was very nice standard. Book spa in advance as was booked out during visit. ",4,2020,10,01
223,Overnight visit,"Booked a night away during local lockdown and although I know the hotel well, I had never stayed before. I would definitely recommend and stay again. I got a good deal on the room rate and the breakfast and dinner were very tasty. The COVID practices were extremely well done and make me feel safe. Well done to the staff.",5,2020,10,01
223,Brilliant stay,"Stayed here recently with my partner and we had a fantastic time. It was a last minute getaway as our previous plans had to be cancelled due to the travel restrictions and we are so delighted they did as our trip to Castleknock outdid itself. We found all staff to be very friendly and helpful, the decor of the hotel is warm, cosy and welcoming. Leisure centre was great, we really enjoyed the pool and the fact the sauna and jacuzzi have reopened. Covid protocols were done to perfection, you can tell it is taken seriously in this hotel without it affecting your enjoyment. We will be back!",5,2020,09,29
223,Excellent hotel for a night away,"We stayed here for our wedding anniversary for one night as a couple and I couldn't fault the hotel. Given the current pandemic circumstances the hotel felt clean  ,safe and well organised. Masks are compulsory around the hotel and hand sanitising is everywhere. The hotel was very busy but it didn't feel cramped, the room was clean and the bed a good size. The pool is very good, there is a small gym and studio which was quiet. The food in the restaurant was excellent,  I can recommend the rack of lamb ! 

I would highly recommend the hotel for a night away, and there was plenty of families there too. We will be returning !",5,2020,09,28
223,Anniversary Break,"First time visiting and wont be the last. Booked an anniversary break and had a great time.

We all  had to were a mask when walking around the hotel Including staff  there was plenty of hand sanitizers one on each table, outside the toilets were screens saying only 2ppl allowed which were red when occupied & green when available. 
They have put a lot of work into making it a safe hotel.
We were looked after extremely well by Ileana Manta at dinner she couldn‚Äôt do enough for us.She was very friendly & professional at her job Thank you.

223,Very good stay,"We got the Anniversary  package.. & money well spent. Can not recommend this hotel enough! A great relaxing night away, staff were all so kind, swimming pool was opened & it was gorgeous. I really felt safe in this hotel as it was clear to see covid guidelines are really well organized here. The only bad thing I can say which is minor is the lighting in the room was very dark we only had 2 dim lights and a dim lamp not really good to do make up in, the room got quite dark fast but besides that I would 100% be back & have told each other every anniversary we will come back & make it a tradition as it was just so relaxing ",5,2020,09,19
223,Cups washed in bathroom sink!!,"The Hotel is fantastic, apart from one aspect, the cups left in the bedrooms for tea / coffee etc are washed in the bathroom sink, ( as stated by the domestic staff), not cleaned in a dishwasher!!!
 In this time of Covid-19 this practise in totally unacceptable.",1,2020,09,18

223,RELAXATION TO A TEA,"My sisters, mum and I went for the relaxation to tea package yesterday. From the time I was booking it Lisa and Aimee in the spa were so helpful and went above and beyond to facilitate the dates and times required.
We had the most delicious afternoon tea experience the variety of savory and sweet options were excellent. The staff were constantly checking in to see if we were okay for everything and there was no shortage of tea and coffee top ups.
We then were brought to the spa where we were provided with robe and slippers and brought into the thermal suite while we waited for our treatments.
Victoria, Hazel & Kerri were so friendly and gave us all amazing facials and massage. They were so helpful and did everything they could to make us feel as relaxed and comfortable as possible. We even got a printout with some recommended skincare products for our skin types.
I would highly recommend this package to anyone looking for a nice relaxing day with some friends family or even sole
The only downside we all felt was the changing / pool area had a lot of kids and families there,so was a bit chaos and we decided to not use the pool as a result",5,2020,09,10
223,Early evening wine & dine,What a pleasant evening my daughter in law and I had.  It was an early Wednesday evening spur of the moment - unbelievable value - beautiful food - socially distancing adhered to perfectly - can‚Äôt fault it. Jennifer and Alvin attentive and pleasant - great service.  Well done Castleknock Hotel. Will definitely be back.,5,2020,09,09
223,The cares of the world stay outside - Outstanding customer service,"Recently my husband and I had to travel to Dublin for the purpose of business. It wasn't ideal as this was a short notice arrangement fueled with a stressful journey the night before. Thankfully however, we had the privilege of staying at the Castleknock hotel.

As mentioned the long journey after an already exhausting day's work did not start off this experience on the best foot. However once we arrived, despite it being late, it felt like the cares of the world were going to be left at the front door. How little did we know how right we were going to be.

We settled in for the night to a very cosy room with an extremely comfortable Canadian king size bed. A personal favorite of mine while staying away. Top marks here. This helped contribute to an amazing nights sleep.

Feeling very well rested and rejuvenated we attended breakfast the following morning, the selection of food on offer was excellent, this helped start our day off on the right foot. 

Once over, we withdrew to the lobby as this is where we agreed  to meet our business associates before venturing further a field. For us, this is where the experience truly began. We were extremely fortune to be attended to by a young, polite and pleasant gentleman named James working as a Covid Ambassador. James was extremely attentive and accommodating, so much so that our associates commented on his level of professionalism and calming nature to being second to none. Because of James, we decided to remain within the lobby to conduct our meeting. What I feared to be a stressful and difficult few hours turned out to be a wonderful success all thanks to the professional, attentive nature of this young man who was a hit among us all.

While this has been our first time attending Castleknock hotel it certainly will not be our last thanks to the en-devours of this young man. I am confident any business would be fortunate to have an employee like James among their team.

Thank you James for a wonderful experience.",5,2020,09,08
223,Overnight stay,An OK experience. There wasn't very many choices on the menu. There was literally nothing for vegetarians. So we requested adjustments to other foods which were not done. Items were sent back and replacements were sent out even worse. ,4,2020,09,08
223,Just what we needed!,"Myself and my partner were in need of a relaxing night away so we decided to go to Castleknock Hotel, the perfect choice! Our room was really nice and cozy, perfect for two, and the view was out of this world! Staff were so friendly, and made us feel very welcome from start to finish. 
We had dinner included which was so tasty, and your Raspberry Mojito's are the best I've ever had! 
We had a quick visit to the pool after breakfast which was the cherry on top. The only downfall was only booking one night! 
Thanks to all of the staff for looking after us so well, we will be back!",5,2020,09,08
223,Fantastic hotel,"The hotel is superb, cleaning and sanitisation stands everywhere. Staff are excellent and a special mention to Ramona on reception whose customer service skills are outstanding as is our server in the restaurant Andrew. Both an asset to the hotel.  Would highly recommend the hotel for a safe and fabulous stay.",5,2020,09,07
223,Excellent hotel,"A real surprise to find such a gem of a hotel when we were only looking to break a journey home. The rooms were very new. We had booked a family room for 5 but were phoned in the morning of our stay to say there was an issue with plumbing and we were being moved to interconnecting rooms instead! We had ordered the kids teepee and it was set up in the kids room. Rooms were spotless and ha sculpt interactive TV‚Äôs. We ate dinner in the restaurant and there we met Andrew... he is without doubt the most incredible member of hotel staff we have ever met. Friendly, helpful with a total ‚Äúcan do‚Äù attitude. He was rushed off his feet at dinner and his smile never left his face. Even at breakfast the following morning he was back on form. Employee of the decade! 
Only criticism of the hotel is that the condition of the pool and pool area does not match the rest of the hotel and it looks worn and needs a refurbishment. 
Excellent experience overall and we will be back!",5,2020,09,06
223,Amazing Staycation,"Just spent a wonderful night stay in Castleknock Hotel to celebrate our 1 year wedding anniversary (which was also incredible and was held at the hotel) and had a truly relaxing and enjoyable stay. We stayed in a deluxe executive room which was most comfortable with wonderful views of the golf course and we were so grateful for the lovely treats left in our room. We dined on the terrace for lunch which was delicious and service was excellent. We enjoyed our anniversary meal in the restaurant and were looked after so well. It was a pleasure to see Alvin again who looked after us so well on our wedding day and welcomed us back like old friends, recognising ya straight away. He is an absolute credit to the hotel. We were very impressed with the Covid protocols in place which made us feel very safe but still able to enjoy all aspects of a hotel experience. We found the service, cleanliness and dining options simply excellent. Thank you for our wonderful stay. üíï",5,2020,09,06
223,Great experience,"Just everything from arrival to service to room and facilities . I found it to be the nicest experince post Covid , there was a lovely atmosphere and the staff were really accommodating , breakfast was lovely ",5,2020,09,04
223,Family Stay,"Excellent hotel. The room was very comfortable. Great facilities, the gym is well set up and considered with Covid restrictions in place. Friendly staff in all areas and the food for breakfast was of a high standard",5,2020,09,01
223,Perfect and safe family stay,"I dont often write reviews but I felt I had to put in writing the excellent service we received at the castleknock hotel. We are a family of 4 ( 2 primary school children) we were on a short vacation in co laois and had only arrived when the co was locked down due to covid. We contacted the castkeknock hotel in dublin who at very short notice said they would see what they could do to accommodate us and get back to us. Syed one of the managers made contact a few times,as the hotel was busy and he wanted to organise a suitable room. He then reserved a dinner table for us for which we hadn't thought to do given the upheaval of having to exit co laois. 
He understood our situation and when we arrived to a beautiful fresh, clean room there were 2 gift bags for the children, with goodies, swim caps, baloons and colours. It was our daughters birthdays and this was a nice surprise. In addition a box of chocolates arrived to the door! 
Dinner was beautiful and staff so friendly, efficient and welcoming. I wasnt sure what to expect with all the new restrictions in place but the staff at the castleknock hotel are so professional and welcoming, all wearing masks and regularly handwashing and using hand sanitizer which could clearly be seen. We felt safe in these uncertain times. The pool was supervised well and guests asked to shower in their room as part of covid regulations. 
I will look forward to visiting again and would recommend this hotel to anyone _families, couples or groups if you are looking for a staycation where you will be well looked after and feel safe. Thank you the managers including Syed and all the staff, the cleaners, the chefs and kitchen staff, waiting and bar staff, reception and pool staff, the porters and the grounds people as the gardens are beautifully maintained. The spa was booked out but I'll try that on our next visit!",5,2020,09,01
223,Castleknock Hotel Restaurant,"I had my son's Christening on Saturday in the restaurant and I have to say it was a fabulous place for it. The waiter, Eoin was so attentive, prompt and helpful, I really can't say enough about him.  Pleasant, on the ball with reading situations and an absolute pleasure to deal with.  It has been a while since I have experience such good service.  The food was fantastic all round.  Thanks for making our day so special.",5,2020,09,01
223,Amazing!!,"myself and 5 family members stay at this fabulous hotel last night. When we arrived we were net by a very friendly staff member who guided us to the check-in area, there were sanitiser everywhere and all staff and guest wore masks until seated. We had lunch which was delicious. Our rooms were spacious and spotless with comfy beds. We enjoyed a beautiful dinner followed by drinks in the residents bar. Overall the hotel staff were very friendly and helpful, social distance and hygiene adhered to and as a result we had a great time, we will be back and would highly recommend this fabulous hotel.",5,2020,08,30
223,Celebrating our wedding anniversary,"My husband and I visited here for an overnight stay with dinner and breakfast. We arrived on the 28th of August 2020.
Our room was spotless, big super king bed crisp white linen. Spacious bathroom.

223,Worth a Visit,"We have just enjoyed a lovely stay in Castleknock Hotel. It‚Äôs great to have such a comfortable hotel in such a great location. It‚Äôs near the city and on the edge of the Phoenix Park. It is not the first time we have stayed there, and we would definitely return there, as the opportunity arises.",4,2020,08,29
223,Fantastic hotel,"Absolutely loved our stay at Castleknock, stunning hotel all round! 
The only downfall is that a lot of the staff weren‚Äôt that friendly and service at the restaurant wasn‚Äôt great but fantastic food and overall, would stay again in a heartbeat.",5,2020,08,28
223,Great Stay in these Strange Times,"We had a rare night off from the kids and so decided to stay at Castleknock Hotel this weekend.  I wasn't sure what to expect with Covid restrictions but I was extremely impressed with how everything run smoothly.  Our room was very spacious and It was actually the best nights sleep we've had in a long time.  We went for a relaxing swim which was nice, very well organised.  

Dinner in the restaurant was delicious, I went with the spicy wings and a juicy burger and my wife went for the Pate and beef Fillet.  The Cocktail was great too as well as the gin and tonic.  Service was impeccable and very attentive.  Lovely spread for breakfast and express checkout was smooth.  All in all a thoroughly enjoyable stay and will definitely return.  Thanks to all the staff and management for your excellent work.",5,2020,08,26
223,Night away with my daughter,"First when i stepped into Castleknock hotel I was greeting by really warm friendly staff and the atmosphere in the hotel is very welcoming.  I am very Covid 19 Conscious  and I feel very uneasy going out for food particularly staying in hotels.  I have to say the cleanliness was 100% I saw the staff cleaning tables and seats and washing their hands constantly.  When we got to the room there is a sticker on the door you break with your swipe card to say the room has basically been sterilized! there was a tv remote control that it informs you has been cleaned.  I have to say I was very impressed with all the cleaning..  It's the only place where I felt relaxed out of my own home.  We had lunch it was gorgeous and staff were really friendly.  We had a swim in the pool which was good too and they are keeping to strict rules how many guests can be in there so we got a call to our room 40 mins later to say the pool was ready for us.  Then we headed to the restaurant for Dinner and we were served by Andrew the cocktails are the best I have ever had!!! The food was absolutely gorgeous.  The staff at this hotel particularly a guy named Andrew they just can't do enough for you.  I have been raving to family, friends and colleagues about this hotel.  I wasn't expecting this type of Hotel with this kind of standard so near to me and it's only a 4 star hotel.   This maybe marked with a 4* but it's definitely 5* hotel and 5* treatment!!!!!",5,2020,08,25
223,Lovely Hotel with great staff!,"Great location, food was fabulous, service was quick and staff very friendly & efficient.
With the current pandemic ongoing we felt very safe & protected in the Castleknock hotel, there was sanitiser everywhere around the hotel & the rooms were spotless! Will definitely be booking to stay again soon! ",5,2020,08,24
223,Lovely family friendly hotel,"Friendly family hotel, staff very accommodating. Cleanliness was top notch. Only one downfall the food menu could have a little more choice but any food we got was fabulous. Will definitely be returning. ",4,2020,08,24
223,Midweek Family Break,We recently stayed for a two night midweek family break. I must say that it was most relaxing stay given the current situation that we live in. Once you enter the hotel you can see the effort that the hotel has put into getting everything up to speed with Covid-19 procedures. The hotel is set up excellently from the moment you enter the hotel with excellent signage and hand sanitizers situated all over the hotel. We had a lovely meal on our first evening and our waiter Andrei couldn't do enough for us. Lovely little playground out the back of the hotel that my daughter loved. We visited the swimming pool on two occasions and it was very clean and all protocols were in place to make it save with lifeguard on duty at all times. Breakfast was very good and service was very good. Hotel very close to Tayto Park and the Zoo. Would recommend for a family visit and golf course also on site,5,2020,08,23
223,My Late Surprise,"Lovely Hotel, It was excellent on arrival. It was a lovely dinner in the restaurant, staff & the F&B Manager are very friendly and they have excellent service. It‚Äôs more relaxing to stay if they‚Äôre open the facilities for the guest like the sauna and steam room.",4,2020,08,22
223,What an amazing stay,What can I say about this hotel other than we had amazing stay. Our room had a gorgeous view of the River and golf course it was amazing. The food was gorgeous. The staff were all so friendly and very accommodating. Alvin the restaurant manager was the highlight of our stay he went over and beyond with us. Will be back in a heart beat to this hotel!,5,2020,08,22
223,Vacation,"Stayed in the hotel about 2 weeks ago. Can‚Äôt fault the service or their facilities but make sure you book a massage, just let‚Äôs say the beds are well sprung! I‚Äôm still not the better of it yetüòú played golf and the course was immaculate, then chilled out on the terraceüçª",3,2020,08,21
223,Great Family Base for Exploring Dublin,"Stayed for 2 nights in August 2020. We were 2 adults and a 6&7 year old. The hotel itself is lovely, the interior design is great. Facilities are excellent. We booked here because of the pool and it didn‚Äôt disappoint, though bring a swimming cap as they are mandatory or pay ‚Ç¨3 for one at the pool reception. We used the pool around 9am or late afternoon as these times were quieter, though there is a waiting list during busy periods and you get a phone call to your room when space is available. This is due to current restrictions on the number of people allowed in the pool. Family swim times are 9am-7pm. 

We had breakfast two mornings and dinner one evening. Food was great at dinner, though service was a little slow - I feel this is due to Covid restrictions though and not reflective of the hotel itself, so prepared to overlook this! Breakfast was ok, continental variety was better than the cooked breakfast in my opinion. Avoid the scrambled eggs though! Like rubber!! 

We stayed in a family suite (room 164) and the room was very spacious, plenty of room for us with a super king bed and two singles. Tea and coffee making facilities. The package we booked also included a welcome bag for the kids which was a nice touch. The bathroom is lovely and the heated floor is a real touch of luxury (and great for drying swimwear quickly!!). The rooms have air con, but it seemed to cut out after about an hour. The temperature was fine though. 

The hotel is in a excellent location for exploring Dublin. We went to Dublin Zoo, which was around 15 mins drive from the hotel and also went into the city for dinner on the second evening. If travelling with kids, it is definitely better to stay here, outside the city and travel in as you can‚Äôt find a hotel in the centre with family facilities as good as the Castleknock has.

The Covid rules and restrictions in place work well, with everything is clear and well laid out. One way systems are in place and hand sanitizer stations are everywhere. It definitely felt safe and clean. The hotel is very spacious so social distancing is also not a problem. Although the bar is not open yet, you can order drinks for your room which worked well for us as the tv had Netflix and the kids watched movies while we had some cocktails. 

Overall, thoroughly recommend this hotel for a family visit to Dublin. The staff were very helpful and are doing a great job in these strange times. ",5,2020,08,20
223,Very pleasant and memorable stay highly recommended,"We booked here very last minute  I don‚Äôt know Dublin at all but it was a good choice. Food is delicious not one bad meal and the staff are very helpful and and take pride in there job. Illena , Alvin and Andrew From the bar and restaurant  are really a credit to the hotel they and made us feel very special. I will certainly recommend this place to others. 

My only thing I will say it is More of family hotel with a lot of children or maybe it‚Äôs just this time of year. My friend and I came here as our travels abroad were cancelled last minute due to the virus. But regardless we had a great time and would certainly come back.",5,2020,08,19
223,Summer getaway,"Myself and my partner stayed there on Saturday the 15/8/20, I have to say we enjoyed every minute of it, we were there for the day and nite, everything was perfect, the massage was so relaxing, the food and cocktails were amazing, the staff were so nice everyone was even the bouncer was so nice to talk to, we felt so safe to with all your safety measures you's had in place too, just wanted to say thank you so much for a lovely, memorable day & nite, we had a great time üòä",5,2020,08,18
223,Lovely stay,"Party of 9 and all were happy with the deal and quality service.  Even though Covid restrictions are in place with 6 per table, staff went out of their way to accommodate our needs. Andrew from the waiting team was exceptional when it came to our order and even had a little humour to compliment his professionalism. We have booked to stay for New Years with our families so we are really looking forward to it.",5,2020,08,16
223,Brilliant stay,"Stayed in the castleknock hotel last night and we had an amazing experience. The food was delicious and the cocktails were just perfect! The staff were extremely friendly and professional and I'd like to mention a staff member named killian who went above and beyond to make our stay just perfect, he was so positive and really made us feel so welcomed. Will deffinitly be back again soon and will always recommend to friends.",5,2020,08,16

223,Fantastic family stay,"We are just back from a one night staycation at this wonderful hotel. It was our first time visiting and most certainly won't be our last. The hotel is warm and welcoming, staff are excellent, friendly, efficient and went above and beyond to ensure we had an excellent stay. The hotel was busy but very safe with excellent measures in place re the current pandemic. We had a lovely meal in the restaurant and beautiful breakfast the next day. We visited the playground which the kids loved and the terrace area is really beautiful to relax in. Again the pool was great, refreshing, relaxing, welcoming to all and most importantly safe. I had an excellent massage in the spa, again staff went above and beyond making me feel so welcome. The next day our car battery was flat and the conference &banqueting manager Kevin helped us with his own car to jump start ours. I would really recommend the hotel, its close to the city but feels a million miles away. It's very reasonably priced and the perfect location for family, couples, girls weekend etc. Something for everyone. Thanks for a great visit.",5,2020,08,15
223,Amazing in every single way and Chris is the kindest and most understandings professional person I've ever met.,Amazing in every single way and Chris is the kindest and most understandings professional person I've ever met.  We as a family cannot say enough about the treatment we received the food the facilities and the staff 5 star all the way.  ,5,2020,08,15
223,Amazing staycation,"Just returned from a 2 night family break at this amazing hotel/resort , firstly would like to thank the management and staff in the way they have adapted to the current Covid pandemic, the safety put in place is just second to none. Now on our stay , well we had the most comfortable superior family room which was immaculate and so well equipped from espresso machine to robes & slippers, gifts for the kids and much more , not to forget the heated flooring , the Liesure centre and pool were immaculate, The hotel itself was immaculate  , cleaners non stop cleaning , now the food ! Well this has to be the best of any hotel in Dublin , all fresh produce sourced locally, steaks which are top class and cooked to perfection, you can also dine on the patio which we did and again first class , also we had drinks and pizzas on the patio which are better than any Italian restaurant. The location of the hotel itself is so close to Dublin City centre ( just at top of Phoenix Park) yet so peaceful and tranquil setting and minutes to city centre, would definitely recommend this hotel for a visit to Dublin either for a family break or romantic break away , again well done to the Team at Castleknock, will return soon",5,2020,08,14
223,Perfect stay,Just back from a belated stay at Castleknock. My mum and I were due to stay but then lockdown happened so we rebooked. My mum had underlying health issues so we had to be careful to book somewhere that‚Äôs following the guidelines on covid. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left we felt safe and so well taken care off. The staff in the spa were amazing to mum and made her day. We couldn‚Äôt recommend the hotel enough from food to safety to hotel room everything was perfect. If your nervous to travel with covid I‚Äôd recommend here everything is done safely and according to guidelines. Thank you all again for a wonderful stay. Linda and Debbie 11/08/20 room 125,5,2020,08,14

223,Family staycation,Stayed in the Castleknock hotel with family. Amazing stay from start to finish. Beautiful spacious hotel with lovely rooms. Fab touches to the room on arrival - little activity bag for kids which was greatly appreciated. Really clean throughout and lots of care taken re safety in the setting of Covid. We dined in the hotel a number of nights and the food was very nice. Activities were great for the kids - swimming pool and onsite playground close to the outdoor dining area. Staff were very courteous and accommodating. Ample parking. Close to amenities we visited including the zoo and Blanchardstown shopping centre. Nice little coffee shop in the foyer serving barista coffees. We will definitely be back. ,5,2020,08,12
223,Brilliant,"We stayed for a few nights and really enjoyed out stay. Staff were amazing, really couldnt have done enough for us. Room was spotless. Food was amazing. Cocktails were outstanding! The whole set up for the covid situation was very well thought out and works well while not taking away from any of the hotel itself.
The hotel was very warm while we were there - im not sure of this is a covid thing or not, but the hotel was very warm all day and at night, but we had a good air-con system in our room which we had on most of our stay. My concerns were mostly for the staff having to work in the heat with masks on all day/night but if it bothered them, they didnt show it. 
Highly recommend this hotel.",5,2020,08,12
223,My review was removed,"Write a review after staying here last Friday and it has since been removed by the looks of things. I'm not going to waste any more of my time but I was not happy with my stay and I found the staff were pretty rude downstairs
After being refused drink at the bar we then got to watch some of the staff drinking themselves in the bar that they had cordoned off. Hotel left a shirt message on my review to call them but it has since disappeared",1,2020,08,12
223,Fairly good,"Very well maintained hotel. Some staff were lovely, however some staff were a little bit abrupt. Really good breakfast. Terrible dinner, but seemingly it is known for disappointing evening meals. Reheated food ! 
Left waiting 25minutes for two drinks but manager didn't charge when the drinks finally came.  Gorgeous pool with smaller pools and waterfall feature.  Lovely outdoor seated area with playground adjoining. Nice rooms but very stuffy even with the windows opened all night. Only 10mins drive to the zoo",3,2020,08,12
223,Safe staycation,Choose this hotel for its proximity to Dublin. Covid 19 safety arrangements were excellent. Hotel staff were friendly and helpful. Dined in the Earth & Vine restaurant where the food was excellent and good value for money.,5,2020,08,10
223,statcation,"Found this hotel and staff was excellent we had a very good holiday. Facilities and communal areas were well staffed and clean, food was very good but slightly pricy. It has an excellent Spa and leisure facility.",4,2020,08,10
223,Fantastic experience,"We have just checked out today from a one night stay.
From the start to finish , I am very very impressed with castleknock hotel! Kevin in reservations replayed to any emails in a prompt fashion, and helped upgrade our room! 

The hotel was very busy with a wedding and lots of groups, but it added to a lovely atmosphere.

At check in, I felt very safe and welcomed - th covid restrictions do not impact on your stay and actually help guest feel safe. 

Our room (296) was extremely clean and cost.

We went to the pool and had to wait five /ten minutes before being allowed to enter. Completely understandable that they do not want the pool too full and a free for all. 
A member of staff was in the pool area supervising, which was a nice touch for safety.

We booked dinner in the 22 bar. After reading about issues with steaks on TA I was slightly wary...but OMG I was wrong! Fillet of beef for us both, med-rare. It was incredible! Cooked perfectly, the mash and carrots full of flavor. 
Our chocolate brownie was delish, definitely home made.

We were allowed to have a drink in the outside heated patio, which was a lovely touch . We didn't have to go right up the room and got to enjoy cocktails üòÑ 

Breakfast again was done with new restrictions but didn't impact at all. Lots of staff to help you with anything you need .

Overall I am already waiting to come back, with my family. 

Well done castleknock!",5,2020,08,09
223,Castleknock hotel,"Really enjoyed our stay in the Castleknock Hotel,  from start to finish,  the food was great and the staff were so friendly and professional especially Eoin the waiter,  the hotel is dealing with Covid 19 excellently and we felt  very safe in all aspects of the hotel. Its a credit to all involved",5,2020,08,08
223,Lovely hotel,This was a much needed few days away and we weren't disappointed from start to finish the staff are so friendly . Food  was beautiful breakfast fantastic and rooms absolutely great although bed was  a bit firm as I have arthritis but maybe that's just me  . Thanks so much .the only thing was bit far out and we spent fortune on taxis as we wanted to shop but would stay again but maybe bring our car but would highly reccomend x,5,2020,08,08
223,Friendly and relaxed trip!,Couldn't fault the hotel from start to finish.  Even with Covid precautions (which they have taken very seriously) we still felt at ease and relaxed within the hotel and pool areas.  Room was great size and spotless.  Food was excellent particularly with the kids buffet in the evening plenty of choice even for my fussy eater. We booked mainly for location as close to Dublin Zoo approx. 15 mins.  Overall had a great stay and will be back again in the furture.,5,2020,08,08
223,Excellent hotel with great staff!,"Had a very enjoyable stay, food was excellent, staff were extremely helpful!! We felt very safe and cozy during covid and how they managed everything. The rooms were bright, spotless and clean. Highly recommend a stay hereüòäüòä",5,2020,08,08
223,Restaurant service isn't good,The hotel itself is really lovely. This was our second visit. We really enjoyed our stay 3 years prior and we were excited to return. The main downfall this time was the restaurant. First night we felt like waiting staff were avoiding us. It took almost 45mins before we ordered. When our food arrived we had no cutlery. When we asked for cutlery a very rushed waiter gave us 2 knives and forks and ran before we could ask for more as there were 5 of us. Our kids ate with their hands. Staff were very busy so we gave them the benefit of the doubt. But the service the 2nd night was worse and the food wasn't great for the price u pay. We didn't complain at the time as most of the waiting staff were lovely but they seemed untrained and with no guidance. It's such a pity as it really let down our experience staying in the hotel. We wouldn't stay again. It was overpriced and service let it down.,3,2020,08,07
223,One night stay,"I had booked a Missed Moments package for myself and my boyfriend which included one night accomadation, 3 course dinner inclusive, full breakfast and drinks the morning after, full access to gym and swimming pool although sauna and steam room were unavailable because of covid, a bottle of prosecco and butler's chocolates on arrival. The staff I was greeted by, a young foreign female was very efficient in arriving my details and explaining everything and all procedures were followed excellently in terms of social distancing and hygiene. The time we spent was very family orientated which made the hotel more lively. Two times our card would not work which made two trips to the reception desk but a kind lady explained it could be as all cards are cleaned and the lock may have had an issue recognising it. Wouldn't return just out of preference but would definetly recommend to friends and family.",4,2020,08,06
223,Staycation,"Myself and my husband stayed here for 2 nights recently. Brilliant hotel, excellent staff. From the moment we arrived it was well sign posted with 1 way system and hand sanitizer stations. Beautiful big room with massive double bed. Staff all wore facemasks. Bar and restaurant well laid out for social distancing. Breakfast one way system worked very well and food beautiful. I had a lovely treatment in the spa on Sunday morning, I'm heavily pregnant and my therapist was so lovely and did a beautiful pedicure for me! Highly recommend this hotel üëç we will definitely return in the future!",5,2020,08,04
223,"Excellent family rooms, great stay","My young family and I stayed in the Castleknock at the beginning of July 2020 and we had a great experience. We had a deluxe family room which was modern, clean and perfect. We had dinner in the hotel and it was also excellent. Upon request we had dessert on the heated patio area outside, where we could watch our children play in the playground area - what more can you ask for? The staff were so accommodating and friendly, whilst also adhering to covid precautions.
The hotel is in a great location - in the countryside but minutes from the Blanchardstown shopping centre (which has a Disney Store and Smyths Toy Store to my kids delight).
I am planning to return to Dublin with my family for another break in August and I am struggling to find an hotel that is as good value and has such excellent family rooms as the Castleknock Hotel.",5,2020,08,04
223,Safe and Cosy,"I recently visited the Castleknock Hotel for food with some friends. As soon as we entered the hotel, the Covid 19 guidelines were explained and we were asked to sanitise our hands. We were then asked to follow a one way system to the restaurant. The food and service were great and staff seemed as they enjoyed their job. I would recommend trying a cocktail also! There was a handy QR code on the table for us to scan. I was really impressed with the Covid precautions in place, there was a sink in the bar which was a nice touch for guests and staff. I visited the hotel pre covid also and have to say there is no shortage of friendly service. I intend to visit the spa shortly and would recommend a visit to the restaurant",5,2020,08,04
223,Great family staycation,"We stayed in the Castleknock Hotel over the Bank Holiday weekend for 2 nights. The hotel was fantastic. They had rigorous COVID 19 planning including our room being sealed prior to arrival after cleaning which gave us great confidence staying during the pandemic. Unfortunately other guests weren't very adherent to guidelines which made us a little anxious at times. The hotel was clean, the staff were friendly and helpful at all times. We will definitely stay again. We travelled to Tayto Park which was only a short journey from the hotel and the hotel is also so close to Dublin zoo so a great base for families in Dublin.",5,2020,08,04
223,Average ,"
Nice hotel.
Food was nice for dinner.
Rooms clean and tidy

Most staff very friendly but some not so friendly ... woman who checked us in and out very friendly.

pool staff and cleaning staff where very friendly.

Staff in restaurant ,breakfast not so much. Felt like some staff members just wanted to ignore us don't know why?

Says online suitable for kids ....yeah maybe for kids over age of 3 , as the park has no swings or slides suitable for toddlers to play on.¬†

Pool was ok, clean and tidy but needs updated a bit.

I do know that we are in COVID19 situation¬† but...
¬†
can't be served alcohol drinks in the lobby¬† only teas and coffee,yet in other hotels around Dublin and Ireland you can get alcohol drinks served in the lobby. Was very disappointed with this.
Won't be returning
",3,2020,08,03
223,Very impressed,"We recently stayed at the hotel for a weekend break. From the moment we walked in the door we were so impressed, the hotel was spotless and beautiful and the staff were really friendly. Rooms were a lovely size and to our surprise there was a fab little pack for my daughter with lots of goodies for her stay! Food was delicious and plentiful, little bit of a blip one evening when they sent out the wrong meal but couldn't have been more apologetic and it was rectified shortly after with a free glass of wine. We can't fault the castleknock and cannot wait to return.",5,2020,08,03
223,Extra charges,Very munch enjoyed my stay in the Castleknock hotel the food and drink was lovely and the staff were very friendly unfortunately we were in a room beside the kids play ground so we could here loud kids screaming early in the morning the shower was broken also when we arrived and a member of staff had to fix it. We then went to the bar and had a lovely dinner and then had a few drinks in our room we were told by staff that we were being a bit loud and that we could drink in lobby if we would like and we then went finished are drinks in the lobby and then went to bed. I woke up and checked out nothing was mentioned to me about a fine for a noise complaint but we were given an illegal ‚Ç¨100 fine for a noise complaint that we were unaware off and then  I rang Ramona the manager I was rudely hung up on spoken down to and told that there was nothing she could do and to email the hotel I‚Äôm very unhappy with the customer service and would definitely NOT stay again.,1,2020,08,03
223,Near perfect family Getaway.,"Just back from a one night stay at the Castleknock Hotel and a trip to Dublin Zoo. 

It was our first stay at this hotel as we normally stay in the City Centre.

As a family we were really impressed by the size of the hotel, great size rooms, a good swimmiming pool and a nice little playground made the stay really enjoyable.

The hotel was spotless and was really adhering to all covid procedures. Staff were very friendly and the free parking made the stay reasonable.

The only word of criticism I could offer was the booking for a restaurant sitting. For 3 days prior I rang about 8 times to try to book a table. The restaurant never picked up the phone and the reception had to make a note.
When we arrived at the hotel we moved the time of our table back 30 mins. Reception tried to call but no answer. They said they would tell them.

When we arrived at the restaurant they didnt have a clue who we were and no record of any booking under my name. 

Happily there was a table free anyway and we had a great quality meal.

I would certainly look at booking again next time we come East to Dublin.",5,2020,07,31
223,Fantastic staycation,"Returned to Castleknock hotel after a fabulous stay at the beginning of the month and this time was even better. All staff make you feel so welcome and at home. However, we must give a special mention to Charlene in the bar and restaurant who went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed and the best time possible. She ensured our little boy was looked after and entertained and made our stay even better than it already was - an amazing waitress. Thank you! Will definitely be returning to this hotel; family friendly with a park and pool, amazing food and great service, round the corner from Phoenix Park - what more could you want!",5,2020,07,31
223,Fabulous hotel,"My partner and I had booked a night away at Castleknock hotel to celebrate his 30th birthday. Prior to our arrival I was in contact with Lorraine from reservations who was very friendly, polite and professional in helping me arrange to have some extra treats left in out room for when we arrived. Lorraine made this process really easy and hassle free which I really appreciated.

We were checked in by a guy, who I didn't catch his name, but was so helpful and couldn't do enough for us and even upgraded our room after hearing about our engagement which was a fabulous bonus.

Our room was spotless! The bed was massive and along with the stand alone bath and shower we were thrilled with it.

We had a table booked for 6PM for some dinner. We were seated by a lovely young lady and the restaurant staff were straight over to our table taking our order and bringing drinks. Our waitress was so lovely and very attentive. After we had finished eating our waitress then arrived at our table with two glasses of bubbly and a gorgeous assiette of desserts to again congratulate us on our engagement. Once we had finished in the restaurant we moved outside to the heated patio area which was again fabulous with another brilliant young lady serving drinks and food.

To say we were blown away with the service and the staff is an understatement! Every member of staff we had the pleasure of meeting was absolutely brilliant and is a credit to the hotel. As well as having brilliant staff the hotel itself is absolutely gorgeous, we are dying to get back to Castleknock Hotel soon and are even considering it as our wedding venue! ",5,2020,07,29
223,Work night out ,We hadn‚Äôt had the opportunity to meet up socially since early March so we booked dinner last Saturday evening. From the moment we arrived we felt completely comfortable in the surroundings. Great attention to detail and all of us had a great night. Highly recommended and great to see such high standards being implemented. We look forward to a return visit soon. ,5,2020,07,28
223,Fantastic for families,"Overall a really lovely hotel. Welcome bags for children are the highlight - really
Give a lovely welcoming feel to the hotel as do all the staff.
Rooms very spacious and clean.
Swimming pool is fabulous and very warm.
Patio area and playground are a super facility.
So the only improvement that would give this 5 stars is the children‚Äôs menu.
My daughter is coeliac and there were no options for her. That said she was accommodated after some discussion with the waitress.  However when her food did
Arrive it was covered with watercress and other herbs which was totally unnecessary for a 7 year old. Maybe a little review of the menu to facilitate all would be good,",4,2020,07,26
223,Wonderful hotel,"We stayed at the Castleknock Hotel and it was a wonderful experience. The staff were so helpful and welcoming to us and nothing was too much trouble. Our room was warm and inviting, breakfast was delicious and all precautions adhered to stringently in relation to COVID-19.
Hand sanitising point everywhere, one way systems at reception and at breakfast... we felt very safe at all times
This was our first stay at the hotel and I cannot wait to return in the coming months 
Thank you to all",5,2020,07,26
223,"Tired , dirty rooms for families","Just checked into a three bed room with my family in this hotel . Came highly recommended but deeply saddened by the state of the rooms in hotel 
We checked into our first room , and was not covid cleaned , no sticker. Walls had substance splattered over them looked like either coffee or possibly blood . Got loved to another three bed room . Walls cleaner , but the room is so so tired and in bad need of being ripped out and remodelled
No air conditioning , carpet old and badly worn , furniture badly marked badly marked marked walls , walls not even painted properly 
Room like a furnace , had to go old school open windows to cool down
Head boards dirty !

All I can say it avoid this hotel",1,2020,07,26
223,Anniversary Break,"We checked in with a minimum of fuss. Our room was large and overlooked the golf course. The bed was huge and very comfortable. We decided to have a meal in the hotel on the first night. The food was so good (Pate, steak, apple crumble all amazing) and we were so well looked after by Andrew and his team that we ate there on the second night as well.The leisure area was lovely and as relaxed as it could be during these covid times. Shopping is only a short distance away and a golf club on site, what more could you ask for. We'll be back soon.",5,2020,07,26
223,Amazing,"Myself and my friend stayed here on friday. I don't know where to start everything was absolutely amazing. All staff from reception, resteraunt, bar, pool, massage therapists and waiters were extremely accommodating. Everything was handled so thorough. The waiter we had Luc was so great. Everything was speedy. Cocktails were unreal. One lovely lady even came to straight to our room with burn cream after my friend burnt herself with the curler. Room was so spacious, spotless and had everything from robes and slippers to drinks and snacks. Food was amazing compliments to the chef! Such a friendly welcoming atmosphere it was so good to feel so normal during these uncertain times highly highly recommended... X",5,2020,07,25
223,Family trip,"We stayed at this hotel last night, it was extremely busy, we ate in the restaurant were we were served by a lovely guy called Owen, he was extremely friendly and continued to check we were okay, he even brought a birthday cake slice with candles and sang happy birthday to my son, thank you very much Owen.

Jessica.",4,2020,07,25
223,One night break,"We booked a night night stay - inclusive of dinner and breakfast. It was a great post lockdown break - very relaxing and food and service was fantastic.

Staff were very attentive - and are doing a great job, especially giving the current restrictions. Special mention to Andrew Sherlock who is a credit to the hotel - we'll be back soon hopefully.",5,2020,07,25
223,Short break,Would highly recommend this hotel. Have stayed many times and have seen quite a few changes in the hotel. The bar area is beautiful their refurbished restaurant serves delicious  food including great steaks. The pool area is really good and bedrooms especially the refurbed ones are wonderful. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful.,5,2020,07,25
223,Castelknock hotel  üß°,absolutely loved my 3 day stay recently in the Castleknock earlier this week. To me the place is absolutely perfectly situated. Only thing I was raging about was I forgot my ‚õ≥  golf clubs haha . Its so good and the staff deal with even the most minor issue very adequately. Currently looking at the possibility of coming back down for a couple nights in August,5,2020,07,24
223,Amazing,LOVE this hotel. Great stay post lockdown - staff were amazing as always and Eoin was the most attentive waiter during our dinner. Can not fault the hotel on anything. They have gone above and beyond to ensure a safe stay and there is no inconvenience to the stay at all,5,2020,07,24
223,Relax and chill ,"Just back from a 2 night stay, all covid precautions in place but does not effect quality of stay, staff were absolutely exceptional their service is top class and the food was tasty
The Perfect spot to relax üëå
Pool and gym opened too ",5,2020,07,22
223,Lovely Hotel and Great staff,"We booked the Summer escape package which was Bed and breakfast, dinner and a cocktail. We also did a room upgrade which was well worth it because the room was beautiful and spacious with a lovely bed and a good TV with netflix. The bathroom was beutiful and we loved the underfloor heatng. 

A few problems with the room:
- It was bloody boiling! Even when we had the temp setting on the lowest we were still so warm. 
- The curtains didnt shut fully so the room was bright very early. This was soo fustrating after a week of travelling we needed sleep. 

The hotel itself is lovely, it smells amazing when you walk into reception and the women who checked us in was very helpful. 

We had dinner booked in the restaraunt and were given the set 3 course menu, there was a good variety on there too. The staff in the restaraunt were all very attentive. I ordered the steak medium rare and it came out raw and cold. After catching the waiter he gladly took it back and said he would get it cooked properly, to which he came out of the kitchen almost straight away with a different plate and a steak that was cooked extremely well done, like a leather boot. I could quite understand why theyd given me that? 
I assume it was a manger that came by and asked us if our meals were ok to which I told him what had happened and he took it away again glad and got it changed, luckily the plate that came out this time was medium cooked. He apologised and said he wouldnt charge me the 6euro extra it was for the steak (Which isnt worth it anyway, if you like decent steak). 
We decided to order a bottle of prosecco upto the room and it costs 40euro which is completely absurd for such a cheap, nasty prosecco. For 40euro we were expecting something much nicer. We regret getting this and would of rather bought our own stuff and saved the money. 
Overall, while the hotel is lovely, I dont think it was worth the money. We wont be returning.",3,2020,07,21
223,Very nice,"We finally took a welcome weekend break after being locked down and we were not disappointed.
Relaxing, spacious and ease of mind with the hotels Covid measures.
Room, food and pool were all spot on and the staff were very nice.
Would definitely return again.",4,2020,07,20
223,"Quite, comfortable setting","We arrived at the hotel for our 2 night stay and the lady on reception was lovely and friendly. We went to the lovely outdoor seating area for a quick drink before heading up to our room. I had organised the anniversary package for our stay and when we got to the room we couldn't be more upset with the ""package"". The prosecco was in an empty ice bucket so it wasn't chilled and I have to say it was the worst prosecco I have ever tasted so needless to say we didn't even finish the glass let alone the bottle. Then the chocolate dipped strawberries were horrible. They were not fresh and we only got 5 so not even an even number üôà the helium balloon was one that you can buy in a packet in Mr Price for ‚Ç¨1 yet for all this package we paid ‚Ç¨58. Completely ripped off and I would not recommend it whatsoever. We did the express checkout as it was busy when we were leaving so I didn't get to say it to any of the staff. 
Breakfast was ok but not overly hot. We ate in the restaurant on the Saturday night and I got steak and asked for medium-well but it was more medium-rare and it was cold so I didn't eat it. My partner got the salmon and he did enjoy that. 
The hotel itself was very clean and the room was lovely so that was great but I'm afraid the stay was ruined from the start when we received such a poor package for our anniversary. The social media pics did not look like what we got so it's false advertising in my eyes. ",3,2020,07,19
223,amazing stay all round,"Had the most amazing stay here at the castleknock hotel, from staff, to food and drinks was all great, we got a family room and it was spotless clean,  The staff were very helpful and friendly,Alex served us at dinner , and was such a lovely guy,He made sure everything was ok with our food and,And nothing was to much to ask for, The food and drinks was 100%, I will be most definitely back again soon, great stay all round and would highly recommendüëç",5,2020,07,19
223,Lovely Weekend Away,"The Castleknock hotel experience is fantastic from start to finish. Starting off with the excellent safety measures in place for covid-19, this allowed me to feel at ease and gave peace of mind that the stay would be a safe and enjoyable one. Upon check in the staff were helpful and the process was quick and efficient. The hotel rooms were very clean and spotless when we arrived, I enjoyed the lovely view available as well. 

The Earth & Vine restaurant was the highlight of our stay, the food was fantastic with an incredible menu that would suit all tastes. My favourite dishes were the salmon and beef fillet both of which were cooked to perfection.  On the Saturday morning the breakfast buffet is not to missed, it had all the favourites and plenty for seconds, the variety was amazing and everything we ate was very tasty. For Sunday lunch the bar food was also lovely with great chicken wings and burgers. 

A definite place to visit with the kids, the pool area is great fun. The overall experience was delightful and I would definitely recommend a visit, can't speak highly enough about it.",5,2020,07,16
223,Great Stay,"Stayed in the Castleknock with family. Have to say I was very impressed with the whole experience. Reasonable price for the room which was lovely. Food was superb and the Guinness was delicious. Good to see all the Covid safety procedures also, will definitely be back. ",5,2020,07,16
223,Superb place to eat and stay!,"Ate at earth and vine during our stay at the Castleknock Hotel. What an experience!! The food was so tasty. Best fillet steak I've had in a very long time, melted in your mouth and the red wine jus brought it to another level. One of our group is a very picky vegetarian and said the red lentil dahl was top class also. Make a point of eating here if you stay at this hotel.",5,2020,07,16
223,Can't wait to come back!,"Stayed here with the family post lockdown and what a great place for a staycation. On arriving we weren't sure what to expect and were pleasantly surprised to see they'd gone to great care with strategically placed social distancing signage and hand sanitising stations without it seeming imposing or over the top. Check in was painless and our room had a seal on the door to inform us it had been cleaned and sanitised for our arrival.
As a special touch there was a little wigwam tent waiting for our 5 Yr old son who insisted on sleeping in it even though there was a perfectly good bed for him. 
First stop was the pool where it wasn't in any way crowded at all. 
Dinner in the restaurant was fantastic, I highly recommend the pate starter and fillet steak main. Couldn't face a dessert as I was pretty full, but my son had the kids chocolate fondue which looked amazing (he loved it... so did my wife). The staff were attentive, extremely pleasant and very diligent when it came to sanitising their hands throughout the service. So smiles all round especially as i got to enjoy a few pints with my meal.
Breakfast was delish, obviously had to go for the full Irish (and I'm quite picky when it comes to sausages). Everything was cooked well and again table service was first class.
Overall it was a great stay. We could see the staff were still finding their feet and getting used to new ways of working but they did so well.
Can't wait to get back here soon.",5,2020,07,16
223,Relaxing stay,"Just back from an overnight stay with the family. We were a bit reluctant before arriving as we thought the new restrictions will spoil our stay, but it was a really enjoyable break.
From check to check out everything was perfect, staff very attentive ,always cleaning and polite . 
Everything was very well organised , lots of sanitising station around hotel .
Pleasant outside area and playground for little ones.
Close to Zoo and Tayto Park.
We will be back",5,2020,07,16
223,Family Break,"Booked for a weekend for a short family escape. The staff couldn't have been nicer or more attentive. They have streamlined the hotel stay with regards to Covid 19 to a simple painless process. Everyone and everything was organised and worked well, the staff were equipped to deal with the new processes and did so brilliantly. We used the pool and restaurant we never felt crowded or isolated a great balance. At no time did we feel concerned with regards to Covid and the hygiene standards were exemplary. 

The meal in the restaurant was fab and breakfast although a little different than before was top notch. ",5,2020,07,16
223,Family break away -with safety and comfort in covid,"We arrived in castleknock on Friday afternoon with kids, they have a big secure car park. 
Lots of PPE safety as we arrived in front doors with a Warm welcome from staff as we approached reception. Receptionist had screen protector and went through safety Features in hotel with covid. 
We booked reservation for dinner , kids where trilled to see tippe tent in room, Room secured after staff cleaned and found it spotless, spacious and great view over golf course. 
We went for dinner staff welcomed us while keeping distance , interaction with our waiter and kids was great with distance. Child one had pizza, our daughter had fish chips, we had starters and mains and all was hot , served well and delicious. Our waiter was brilliant checking from distance we had everything we need through out meal. Mobile log on to menu so we could decide from menu on phone rather then physical copy with covid which was a great idea . Staff regularly washed hands at tap /acholic PPE station that was Available in bar restaurant for customers and staff to use at will. 
We felt so secure at castleknock hotel, staff where so warm friendly and engaging with us and our young kids, food was really excellent and we where fit and stuffed for bed when we where done. 
For anyone needing a little get away with anyone medically vulnerable like we had , I can not recommend castleknock hotel enough . From start to finish we had a great stay , great food and wonderful staff looking after us. 
Well done to castleknock hotel and team , We will be back without question",5,2020,07,16
223,Avoid if you want to relax,"On a visit to Dublin zoo with my family we decided to stay here for one night, at a rate of 152 euro for one night, I am sorry we didn't choose somewhere else! I work for the NHS and this was my first few days off in a very long time. Firstly the rooms are a little tired and small for a family of four.  The lobby and bar restaurant look better than the rooms.  Their covid policy is a little weird, as no staff in the bar or restaurants wore masks at dinner but then at breakfast all staff did wear masks and visors which was strange.  Negatives were that the cups had lipstick marks on them when we arrived in the room, which was surprising when they made a point of telling me how the room was sealed after cleaning.  The food in the restaurant was expensive for what we got, my sons fish was nothing short of cremated, our lasagne had been reheated and was hard, my daughters chicken goujons where processed chicken.  The room was extremely hot and had no temperature control, we had to leave the windows open and as we appeared to be near ye bins or service area, there were trollies being wheeled passed out window all night long and all morning long - we got zero sleep!! We had breakfast early and couldn't get out quick enough. Upon checking out the later asked how our stay was and I told her the problems we had. She said the amnaget would call me, which in fairness someone did make several attempts to call.  I finally got to speak to the manager (can't remember the name) to be honest that call made me more angry, he was quite dismissive of the issues which had ruined our overnight trip, didn't appear to be too concerned, in a rather blas√© tone, said if I want he will send me his email incase we ever come back to Dublin and he will work out a good rate!! You have got to be kidding me, while I wasn't looking for anything originally I'd actually like my money back for the god awful experience!! He also didn't bother sending the email! Avoid this place, if you wish to relax and enjoy your stay, choose another hotel",1,2020,07,16
223,Nice but getting a little tired.,"We had a 2 night stay with 2 children in connecting rooms. The hotel was reasonable by ROI standards. The reception and bar areas are very nice. Most communal areas are of high standard. The 2 rooms we had were OK. Clean, functional but definitely tired and in need of an update. Bathroom and toilet were patched up and there was a constant noise from the plumbing. Our room was above a delivery area on the ground floor and no effort was made to minimise the sound of bins being lifted out or deliveries on trolleys very early in the morning. Breakfast was nice and varied and of good standard. Dinne, less so. I got steak which was just OK. The childrens' menu was limited and of a standard. My wife had risotto and salmon which was lovely apparently. Very handy to Phoenix Park. Very handy for Dublin City Centre without actually being in the city although the public transport links are limited. Nice hotel. Great pool area and pool of a decent size. Staff were courteous and polite.",3,2020,07,15
223,Style over substance !! ,"Arriving at this hotel I thought this looks so fancy , stunning to look at , on arrival we went straight for lunch which was absolutely beautiful, decor throughout is very stylish , C19 posters all around advising residents to use sanitisers provided , check in was smooth, quick and straightforward , we went to our family room to discover a small box room with 2 double beds very small and compact , I was very disappointed so I contacted reception to hear them say yes your in a family room , I feel like it‚Äôs very misleading from what is advertised as a family room , our room was very noisy as they clear bins, bottles , except deliveries from 6am I heard it all , Monday morning breakfast is a disaster , hundreds of people queuing for breakfast , poor staff were so busy trying there best but the crowds were to much , swimming pool we again had to que , only 20 allowed in at anyone time they should email or text residents telling them pool is busy , dinner on Monday night was beautiful, menu is limited not a great selection but food is lovely , I understand C19 is playing havoc with a lot of hotels but with the amount of money we are paying I expected more ! Staff were excellent, tried there best but the whole experience just didn‚Äôt blow me away ! ",3,2020,07,14
223,Fantastic Staff,"In for a meal with my Husband and our three children Monday 13th July. Atmosphere was good and busy enough for a monday. It was about half 8 9ish, we''re finshed our lovely dinner and packing up to go when and our youngest daughter falls over and starts crying, within 5 seconds a young waiter with Top knot is waving a chocolate biscuit in her face. She suddenly she forgets she was crying and the young man cracks a joke and simply walks away. Made our night, i regret not getting his name.
10/10 would recommend",5,2020,07,14
223,"Misleading Room Size, passive aggressive staff","Booked a family room and got a double room with a crib thrown into it. Misled by the room size I ordered online.Questioned reception about this to which they tried to charge me 49 euro extra for a bigger room.

No answer from room service after 30 minutes of trying to ring them so I ordered a pizza as my kids were hungry and cranky to which a very passive aggressive porter told me this isn't allowed to which I responded,""then answer the phone then"" 

Trying to be understanding as I know they're flat out but on a sunday night? I was going to give a terrible rating but decided to go with poor as I'm trying to be fair here but all I've been met with is passive aggressive staff who just couldn't be bothered and are trying to shoo you out the door as quick as you came in. I've had an uncomfortable experience here and mainly due to my interaction with staff, perhaps a post covid automated check in service would offer a warmer service ?",2,2020,07,12
223,Fantastic service,Me and my family just recently this hotel and from start to finish it was excellent in particular Andrew from the restaurant who is the manager is a absolute credit to this hotel he was amazing along with his staff in particular Kevin. The food was stunning and there was a playground and a pool to keep the children happy. And also I was dealing with mairead from reception and she went above and beyond to make sure our stay was amazing she is also a credit to this hotel I will definitely be back really soon for another stay. Thanks very much guys see you soon.,5,2020,07,12
223,Lunch ,"We had a gorgeous meal in the castleknock hotel as one of our first ventures out since lockdown and it didn‚Äôt disappoint. The food was fantastic, and hygiene was impeccable which was very reassuring. Eoin, who served us, was amazing and looked after us so well. We will definitely be back ü§ó",5,2020,07,11
223,Dinner in restaurant,"We were very well looked after in the restaurant by all the staff but especially the waiter Eoin. He served us a top class meal and made it even better with his waiter skills and politeness and kindness.  He is a very polite,kind and caring chap. Really recommend this hotel. Amazing service.",5,2020,07,10
223,Castleknock? Castlenot!,"Stayed here over the weekend.
I had received an email days beforehand explaining information regarding check in and advice on staying safe while staying in the hotel.
We were met at the door by a Covid 19 ambassador, needless to say he was not wearing a mask.
Check in was quick enough and the counter was cleaned after each check in.
I asked at reception about booking a table at dinner, it was hard to hear with the screen that was between me and the check in lady and I had a problem understanding her accent so I thought she had told me to ring down to the restaurant when I got to our room.
When I got to the room I rang to book a table for dinner and the call went unanswered. We decided to go for a walk and we stopped off at reception to book a table in the restaurant.
We were told there was limited availability and the only time available was 5pm as it was 4.40 we were not ready to go for an early meal and asked was there no later time available.
We were told that the hotel was extremely busy and that was all there was.we asked why we hadn't been advised by email days before we arrived that it would be advisable to book a table in the restaurant as the hotel was going to be busy.
We were told that they only do that if a meal is included in your package.
We asked to speak to a manager and we explained our disappointment to her, she said that she could give us a table at 6 but it was outside, she showed us the table and we said that it was fine.
We then asked about booking a table for the following night and we were told that no tables were available in the restaurant for that night either so we said that the outside table was fine for the next night.
When we arrived to the restaurant at 6 for dinner we were shown to a table inside and not outside. So what all the talk about being fully booked was about we don't know. 
The food was not great, stale bread with the pate, fish and chips was poor quality and the icecream with the overly sweet chocolate orange pudding was freezer burned.
When we complained they took the dessert and tea and coffee of the bill.
I also have to say that not one member of staff in the restaurant was wearing a face mask.
Also some of the salt mills were not working at tables and people were swapping them from other tables, as it is known now that Covid 19 spread in Germany from a contaminated salt shaker restaurant staff should check that condiments on each table are working properly and being cleaned after each table had been vacated to try and prevent any further outbreak of Covid 19.
Breakfast next morning(Sat) was not wonderful either, tepid porridge and the black and white pudding was rubbery. Although breakfast the next morning(Sun) 
was much better.
Needles to say we did not have dinner in the restaurant on Saturday night, we went elsewhere to a restaurant where all the staff were wearing visors or face masks and the food was gorgeous.
On checking out the receptionist never even asked me if we had enjoyed our stay.
On a positive note both bedroom and bathroom were lovely and clean but sadly it's not a hotel we will be returning to again.",3,2020,07,06
223,Visit July 2020 (post COVID-19 lockdown),"Booked a room here last minute for my husband‚Äôs birthday. We got a great deal that included room, three course dinner, a cocktail and breakfast. 

The hotel is clean, modern, so spacious and the rooms are lovely. Although we didn‚Äôt use the the gym or the pool - they  look very clean. 

Tip:
- Request a room with view of the golf course.

Dinner: 
We had three three course dinner and our waiter Eoin was super friendly and helpful, he was so professional. The food was very tasty and the cocktail delicious. 
There‚Äôs a large outdoor area to enjoy an after dinner drink.",5,2020,07,06
223,4 night Family get away,"Myself and my family got away for 4 night stay -thur to tue just after opening of hotels and we had a fantastic stay. (Visiting Tayto park and Phoenix park etc sooo close)
I was Originally stressful about it, due to the whole COVID-19 etc .
But honestly they were so nice and there was good use of sanitiser and great signage. They also had a traffic light system in Lobby toilets Which was very helpful to avoid crowds in at once.
I would have to mention Andrew the F&B Manager I think, he was soo friendly and helpful at all times.  Thank you Castleknock for helping us have such a lovely experience away at such a unusually stressful time during this pandemic",5,2020,07,06
223,Return post Covid,"As regular guests to both the restaurant and the bar, we were waiting for June 29th with anticipation (as it was also our wedding anniversary).
We were greeted on arrival by the Covid ambassador (Kevin) and shown the appropriate signage and hand sanitizing before taking our seats.

Andrew, after a warm greeting, noted us not in our 'usual seats' and promptly moved us to the middle of the bar area where we normally sit - its the little things........

A fine pint of creamy Guinness was ordered while we checked the menu - on our phones - this worked very well.
Our service with Ollie was fantastic, he is a big asset to the Hotel as his service skills are unmatched. 
The steak was fantastic as was the wine - the additional pints went down well and we received a nice dessert from Andrew to recognize our Anniversary - a nice touch. 
We are regulars to the hotel, and with the kind of service that we receive, we'll continue to be regulars.",5,2020,07,03
223,Wonderful post Covid stay,"My boyfriend and I have stayed in Castleknock Hotel a few times and always found it wonderful. This time was a little different being our first trip since the Covid 19 lockdown. I was a little nervous of going to a hotel with all the new guidelines and restrictions in place but my worries melted away as soon as we walked in through the lovely glass doors of the hotel. I can confidently say that Castleknock Hotel have done everything possible to make guests feel safe without losing the charm and friendlyness of the hotel and staff. There is hand sanitiser stations everywhere and clear signage, downloadable menus and the most helpful staff. We were greeted by the hotels Covid Ambassador when we arrived, he was very nice and explained about the new check in process (only one person from each party). Reception was very professional, wiping surfaces and card machines between each guest. The room was spotless and I really liked the secure seal sticker on the door, this is put on by housekeeping after the room is cleaned so that guests know no-one else has been in before them. We ordered room service during our stay and it arrived quickly and again the staff were great. I cannot fault anything about our stay and we are already planning our next stay in Castleknock Hotel.",5,2020,07,02
223,Very Disappointing Stay,"Myself and my Hisband stayed for weekend and we were so disappointed,received bad beer 3 times and returned 3 times and we were spoken to so rudely by 2 members of staff,i decided to write and send my feedback and didnt even get a response back acknowledging.  Nice hotel but fact we werent allowed eat and watch football in lobby area when others did before us i thought was shocking and staff were rude and overall such a disappointing stay and it wasnt cheap",1,2020,06,29
223,My sons christening,"Hi I would just to thank all the staff for my sons christening day on the 14th march. Everything was perfect from start to finish. The room was fantastic and nicer in person. The staff so nice. I'd like to thank Enaz she did everything I asked of for the room and food act  and like to thank Charlene also both so kind and helpful everyone had the best day and night and we also enjoyed our over night stay. 
So thank you again so much",5,2020,04,11
223,Celebrated Christening ,"Start of the month we booked and had a very nice 3 course meal and drinks up in the castleknock hotel.
Very nice sitting area and well looked after by the staff.
Also the food was very nice.
I would highly recommend here.

Was so good a week later a small group of us went back and had afternoon tea, again was very nice and staff again very nice.

Thanks again. ",5,2020,03,30
223,Fabulous weekend,"We celebrated our friend‚Äôs Hen party in this hotel and absolutely had a great time. Rooms are clean and beds were comfy. We had our sumptuous  dinner at their fabulous restaurant Earth and Vine, Alvin the manager was very nice and accommodating as well as all the staff who served us. Foods were lovely from starter to dessert. The steak was to  die for. We also had a dip at the pool and jacuzzi,  clean and relaxing. It was a perfect weekend celebration thanks to this hotel. Will definitely recommend this to anybody.",5,2020,03,20
223,"Great Service, cool style and a real sense that this Hotel is worth everyone of its 4 stars","What a huge comfy bed, very stylish lounge, with a spa that opens at 6 am. The Hotel is close enough to Dublin to enjoy the city but is also on the gateway to the South/North and West of Ireland. Great service, you sense that every star is earnt. Bartender Micheal certainly kept my well looked after during my stay.
",5,2020,03,10
223,"Got most things absolutely right, but one.","Bottom floor suit with views to golf course and lake. Convenient to gyms and swimming pool - which is fabulous (Jacuzzi, steam room and sauna to boot), great walk in restaurant. Breakfast with such a great array of offerings well and freshly prepared. But oh, the beds are so hard - and so are the pillows. How can such a fine hotel get the beds so wrong and the pillows even harder!",4,2020,03,09
223,Great stay and delicious food üòã,Having stayed here for a hen night it is nice and cozy with great facilities. Earth and Vine Restaurant served delicious food and has very friendly Nd helpful staff - especially Alvin bau. I salute you!,4,2020,03,08
223,Really recommend it,"Great service, great place .Rooms are lovely and spacious.  Service was excellent and they couldn't do enough for us. We had a lovely girl called Charlene 
Who looked after us all afternoon and night .We didn't have a reservation and she made sure we got a table ..no easy feat for 9 people. Was so warm and welcoming and couldn't do enough for us .",5,2020,03,07
223,Not food to die for,Third time staying at this hotel last review I left was five stars this time however stay was ruined by the evening meal I can honestly say I will never eat in this hotel again what was handed to me one a plate was so far below par it was incredible and the satisfaction received from the manager on the night was less than satisfactory. The hotel staff were really friendly and nice rooms lovely and clean evening meal dont ask,2,2020,03,02
223,"Fab hotel, lovely staff. ",We were here for my sisters wedding at the weekend and it was just amazing. The staff were so helpful & lovely and the security staff were great. The food is delicious. The rooms are spacious. The leisure centre and spa is lovely and connected to the hotel. There's a lot of space and a good chill out area in the front. ,5,2020,03,02
223,Highly recommend.,"Very friendly professional receptionist on arrival.  The decor of this hotel is superb.  Entering the bedroom, I have never in the whole of my life stayed in a room the quality of this one at any other hotel.  The size of the bed, wow, I had to shout goodnight to my husband he was so far away ha ha.  Things like the lamps, were amazing, for a hotel room.  Breakfast fantastic quality, huge choice.  I highly recommend this hotel especially if you are after something extra special.",5,2020,03,01
223,Lovely 4-star hotel which is surprisingly large with ample car parking outside,"Tasteful decor throughout with very contemporary look. Food is excellent, as are the facilities. An extremely popular hotel with locals which is always a good sign. Rooms are spacious and well appointed.",5,2020,03,01
223,Great stay - amazing food,"Having stayed for a wedding in December, we were keen to return. Availing of an overnight offer (romantic package) which included Prosecco in room, dinner in Earth and Vine Restaurant we upgraded to an executive room at a minimal extra charge. When checking in we were given a complimentary late check-out!! The hotel was busy - rugby weekend, a wedding, mid-term with lots of families availing of offers. Yet we were able to have a relaxed time and a quiet night's sleep. From start to finish the staff were outstanding with a friendly service of extremely high standard. The highlight was our meal. We're used to dumbing down our expectations when it comes to hotel restaurants, so the Earth and Vine was a pleasant surprise.  There was a restaurant vibe, the food was outstanding.  What a treat. It lived up to it's blurb about showcasing the best of Irish produce. We'll be back.",5,2020,02,23
223,Conference & Overnight,I have t stayed here for a few years and they have spent money on the place and it looks great! Lunch was nice (set conference lunch green curry or fish) I had curry and was very tasty. Food was good and service good. The rooms look like they have been renovated but no aircon which is strange for a place at this level. ,3,2020,02,23
223,Nice Hotel & Comfortable Room,"We stayed here after travelling around Southern Ireland.  The hotel has its own golf course, but we didn't have time to play.  Our room was reasonably large as compared to    other hotels in Dublin.  We had a bit of walk to our room from the lobby and had to wait for our luggage to be delivered.  We were satisfied with both the comfort and the cleanliness of our room and both dinner and breakfast were quite good.",4,2020,02,21
223,Never....ever disappoints 5üåü,"I‚Äôve been staying at this hotel throughout various times of the year over the last 5 years & it never ever disappoints! 

Fantastic service once again tonight from Alex while having dinner in the bar & the team always attend to your every need no matter how small which makes it really stand out from the many other hotels in the locality.

Do not hesitate to stay here if you‚Äôre looking for a hotel in this part of the country....as like me, you will be booking your next stay as you check out! 

Enjoy.

223,Mixed emotions,"Had great difficulty getting my booking sorted out. Had to ring several times. Stayed couple nights. Room fine and breakfast good. Setting very relaxing. Just found reception and front office staff not very efficient. Had reason to ring back after my stay as I lost something and found them most unhelpful. 
",2,2020,02,13
223,Miss,Excellent service from reception to restaurant staff throughout my stay. Nice personal touches. Lovely open hotel. Never disappointed. The breakfast and food menus are excellent with choices to suit everyone. Excellent to have large water bottles in the bedroom for still and sparking water. Free.  I didn‚Äôt use spa or pool/ gym but option is there.,5,2020,02,12

223,Amazing hotel / beautiful food / very friendly staff / very comfortable bedrooms. Will definitely come back.,"Had the pleasure of staying at beautiful Castleknock hotel on Monday 10th for one night for a two day meeting/ course. 
First time to visit Castleknock and stay .
Honestly one of the nicest hotels I have stayed in .
Beautiful spacious and comfortable Lobby as you walk in the door. Very helpful and friendly staff in all departments from reception/ the bar / breakfast and Looking after the meeting rooms. 
Food was delicious in both bar and breakfast.
Bedrooms nice and warm, spacious and so comfortable. 
Will definitely come back to visit soon .

223,"Stylish hotel, good food but buy new beds !","Had lovely overnight stay with my daughter, came very close to giving 4/5 score because we had such a lovely time but the beds/pillows stopped me. They need a serious upgrade. We ate in bar, lovely atmosphere, very nice food but menu a bit limited in truth. But whole bar, restaurant, lobby area felt buzzy & is decorated really stylishly. 
Again breakfast was very good. We left it too late to get a booking in the spa but we did enjoy the pool area. 
Staff very nice too.",3,2020,02,01
223,Worst hotel ever ,"Charged me more than the agreed price on my account, took 1 week to get the money back.
The hotel was dirty, and the room really small, no bath robes in the room. Ended up not staying and still had to pay the cancellation fee which was charged on my card 2 weeks later without giving them my CVC... 
My advice: stay away from this hotel.",1,2020,01,29
223,"Beautiful hotel, helpful friendly staff and lovely spa.","Stayed at Castleknock hotel in December 2019 to celebrate my birthday. We stayed in the Higgins Suite and loved it beautiful views, complementary water, tea, coffee and hot chocolate. Had a treatment in the spa which was amazing finished off with a free glass of champagne in the relaxation lounge. We ate at the hotel both nights and would highly recommended both resturants. 
We had a great stay staff couldn't do enough for us. Definitely hope to be back.",5,2020,01,27
223,We'll be back,"Let me get the very few negatives out of the way first => on check-in, the computer insisted that we did not have a booking! I gave the friendly gentleman at Reception a copy of my booking with ref. no and their I was in the system but for another date!? However the problem was solved after a short time with a room upgrade. The only other negative was that neither my wife nor I could manage to turn the room radiator off!?

Now to the many positives => it is so nice to stay at a Dublin Hotel with no parking problem. The Hotel itself is an imposing building, inside and out and in good, clean condition. Our Twin Room lacked nothing (except a Toilet Brush!). We had an excellent evening meal in Bar 22 and a super breakfast in the earth & Vine Restaurant. All staff we came in contact with were friendly and helpful.

We had already booked this Hotel again in late May and now I look forward to a return visit.",4,2020,01,27
223,Overpriced and unwelcoming,"My friends and I recently stayed in the hotel for our girly night away. We were greeted by a very friendly receptionist who had some trouble with a printer, so our check in took a long time. She was very apologetic. We eventually went to our triple room. The beds were comfy and the room was clean. It looked pretty dated though. We had a horrible view with satellite dishes beside our window. We tried to order some room service, but could not get through at all, then was put on hold and eventually hung up on. So we ended up just going to the bar/restaurant had a little bite to eat and some cocktails. The service was extremely slow, even though there seemed to be plenty of staff around. We then realised that there was a wedding on. However, the hotel is very large so should be used to this. Many of the staff were also quite rude and unwelcoming.  Also the seating throughout the hotel looks nice but is extremely uncomfortable. 

We went for dinner in the evening which was lovely. There was a good choice and variety and I was delighted to see that they had a nice vegetarian/vegan menu. 

We went back to the room after a while just to realise how noisy it was because of the wedding. We could literally tell what songs were played, it was as we were at the wedding! It was very hard to relax and sleep as this went on for some time (as weddings do).  The room was extremely warm even though we opened the windows and it was a very uncomfortable night for all of us. 

The breakfast next morning was OK, nice choice of food but lot of it was not warm. I was very pleased to see a nice separate gluten free area. There was a good selection of cereals and toaster. 

Overall, our stay was quite a disappointment. This hotel is quite frankly overpriced and unwelcoming.

223,Earth & Vine Restaurant,"My sister arrived from the UK to celebrate our Mum's Birthday. We surprised her with lunch at the Earth and Vine Restaurant at the Castleknock Hotel. The restaurant is nice and bright with lovely views and we were fortunate that afternoon as the sun shone to add to the ambience in the dining-room.  From start to finish we enjoyed a delicious lunch! Mum's soup was not as hot a she would have liked and that was rectified immediately and to make up for it they straight away offered her a complimentary side with her main course. It was much appreciated. Eoin and Leanna were looking after us. They were so warm, friendly and efficient without being intrusive or rushing us. To Mum's delight the Restaurant Manager and staff surprised her by serenading and presenting her with a Birthday cake. It was a lovely touch as just as she was sitting down at the table initially, I mentioned to Leanna she was the Birthday girl. In all honesty it was a beautiful and memorable afternoon for all of us, made special by the wonderful staff and food. We will most definitely be back and I believe the afternoon tea is another delight.",4,2020,01,20
223,Disgusting,"As soon as I arrived in the reception I noticed several signs that got me worried: the receptionist had the nails not taken care of, the ceiling had stains of dirt and a strange smell of urine.
Elevator the doors were dirty with finger marks and hair hanging from the ceiling.
Room the doors were dirty, the wardrobes dirty.
And upset I took the decision not to stay.
I went to the reception, and asked for the refund but was told that I would have to pay the first night by the manager, he was arrogant, didn‚Äôt accept the fact that the hotel was dirty and smelled bad and even argued with me.
Don‚Äôt recommend this hotel to anyone.",1,2020,01,17
223,Nice hotel,"Good sauna/jacuzzi, rooms are spacious, great bar/food & lovely staff. Beds are a little uncomfortable and it is well outside the city, but overall a great hotel. we used the venure for a team meeting (40 people) and it was perfect for such an occasion.",4,2020,01,17
223,Mixed feelings about this hotel.,"My husband bought me a voucher in December 2018 for the hotel and also one for the spa.  Expiry date was 24 December 2019.

Booked a one night stay in mid December for his birthday (coinciding also with my sons birthday) but we had to move it at two days notice to a Saturday in January as my daughter had mumps.  The hotel staff were very obliging about extending the vouchers to accommodate us in a deluxe family room (with a double bed and two singles).  Many thanks to Ellie Doherty at the hotel for sorting this out - and also to Suzanne and Lisa in the Spa.  

We had requested an early check in (as check in is 4pm which is quite late for us) and we were happy to find that our room was available upon our arrival at 3.  

The hotel had left a birthday card and dessert in the room.  Lovely touch. Very thoughtful and much appreciated.

The room was lovely and clean with lots of wardrobe space.  It had a large flatscreen TV with Netflix facility.  I managed to hit my head on the tv every time I sat at the table however, as the chair was squeezed in just below and in front of it.

The bathroom was lovely and had both a bath and a separate walk in shower. The water pressure in the shower wasn‚Äôt great but the temperature was good.  There were plenty of toiletries and towels plus 2 bathrobes and slippers.

The view from the window (beyond a flat roof) was over the golf course at the back or side of the hotel, and we were delighted to see two swans there.

Disappointingly, the beds were very hard so I didn‚Äôt sleep well at all.  This was a major downside to our stay.  Some people love a really firm mattress but I can‚Äôt get comfortable on them at all.  I tried lying on the double bed (which was in fact 2 single beds pushed together) but eventually swapped my son for his single bed.  Unfortunately they were both as hard as each other.  If you like a soft bed I‚Äôd suggest not staying in the room that we had (272).  This was the only major negative about our hotel room.

The walls were thick enough not to hear guests next door although in the morning we could hear kids in the hallway outside the door.

The temperature was great and thankfully there was no noisy aircon rattling away.  I‚Äôd have slept like a baby if I‚Äôd had a softer mattress.

Reception (actually that main lobby area) has plenty of comfortable velvet seating and we were treated to a singer and his acoustic guitar for a while as we had our wine and cocktails.  My husband said their Guinness was amazing!  The bar service for the lobby area closed early though compared to other hotels that we‚Äôve stayed  in - about 10.30pm?  And when my husband tried to order a cocktail at about 11.30pm in the main bar (to take up to our room) he was informed that they couldn‚Äôt make them one as the cocktail waiter had finished for the night, and he was offered wine instead.  

Anyway one thing that really concerned me was that there were two very young  seemingly unaccompanied children (both under 8) sitting at the group of chairs nearest the to main hotel entrance doors.  They were sitting low in the chairs / lying across them, with their backs to the room.  They were playing electronic games that they‚Äôd brought with them and they had no adult sitting with them.  They were there when we arrived at about 8.45pm and were still there an hour later.  None of the hotel staff seemed to notice them as none of the staff asked them who they were with, but plenty of other guests noticed them as they were taking up a large area of seats.  The table looked empty until you were right beside it as the seats were much taller then the children.  They were so small and the sets were so big that you wouldn‚Äôt have seen them until you went over to that area.  We were in the seats right behind them and we hadn‚Äôt noticed them there until people looking for seats walked over and then saw them and walked away again.  

After about 30 minutes a lady who had been sitting with a group of adults at the very far end of the lobby seating (nearest the restaurants entrance) went over and talked to them for about 5 minutes.  They were speaking Spanish I think and these two children were obviously related to her.  Anyone could have walked out the door with those two children and she and her friends wouldn‚Äôt even have noticed!  Mo one was supervising them.  She walked off and left them there again to go to her adult friends at the far end of the lobby near the restaurant.   The children stayed there on their own for at least another half an hour.  There is no way the adults could see or hear the children as they were at completely opposite ends of an extremely large open plan lobby.  Someone from the hotel should really have asked the children who they were with as they were far too young to be left unaccompanied in that area.  Their parents didn‚Äôt seem to be worried in the slightest!  

Other guests looking for a seat together were not very happy either as they couldn‚Äôt sit there - the two children had seats at a table where 6-8 people could easily have been accommodated.  The bar was busy and those seats were in high demand.  I think the lobby bar staff should have enquired why they were sitting alone and taken them to sit with their parents.  They either went unnoticed by staff or they turned a blind eye.  As a parent myself  I was very concerned about the health and safety issues of this situation.

Anyway enough about that ... and on to the food.

We ate in Dublin for dinner on the Saturday night so didn‚Äôt go to the hotel restaurant but we had breakfast at the hotel.  It was included in our room rate but we decided to have ours in our room, so we completed the card and hung it in the door.  Neither of our children like breakfast so we only ordered fir the two of us.

The full English breakfast was ok but had a lot of mushrooms and only a tiny portion of beans.  This wouldn‚Äôt have been my preference.  We asked for one of the two fry‚Äôs to have an egg but unfortunately they put an egg on both plates which somewhat ruined mine as I absolutely hate eggs. I think the grease on my plate possibly came from the egg which put me off eating half of what was on my plate.  My husband was happy to eat that half despite the energy‚Äôs size of the fry.  Anyway, I think if I stayed here again I‚Äôd not order room service as I‚Äôd have probably got exactly what I wanted had I gone down to eat on the breakfast room.

We had also ordered a selection of mini pastries and a croissant.  What they brought us was two mini jam pastries and two mini croissants in a small bowl.   Hardly a great selection! 

The coffee wasn‚Äôt great so I didn‚Äôt drink it, but the juice was lovely.

I arrived 20 minutes early for my Sunday morning spa appointment as it says in their brochure to arrive early - to fill in forms and discuss treatment.  I‚Äôd booked a 10am stress buster massage.  The spa only opens at 10 on Sunday‚Äôs so I got there before the spa reception staff but they arrived shortly thereafter.  I completed their form.  They then asked me if I‚Äôd like to change in the swimming pool /gym changing room or the spa toilet as the spa hasn‚Äôt got its own changing rooms (strangely).  I chose the latter, but asked if they had a robe that was any larger than the one in our hotel room wardrobe as it was too small for a plus size lady like myself.  The lady at reception tried to find one but then came back to say that they were all the same size (large).  So I made do with one that was too small.

After changing I was shown into a room with soft lights and music and 6 treatment beds.  This was a waiting area where you can sit and relax with a glass of water or cup of coffee.  My therapist arrived within minutes and took me through to a treatment room.  I can‚Äôt praise Faziannah highly enough.  She made me feel very at ease about having my massage, and she was very good.  My back, shoulders and neck felt so much better because of her great massage technique.  After my massage she recommended one of the Elemis products that she had used on me, and gave me the price list.  She invited me to make use of the relaxation room again but unfortunately I had to get back to my room to pack our bags and check out (by 12).  I took the price list back to the room, but returned after check out to buy a tan enhancer product for my daughter.  Despite listing it they didn‚Äôt actually stock this item.  They said that they never stock it as they just sell the fake tan products.  I found this a little strange.  

I recommend that if you are buying someone a spa voucher that you do some research into which treatment they would like and buy that exact amount for the voucher.  Change is given as a voucher if the treatment costs less than the voucher, and you only have a year to use it from the issue date.  If like me, you‚Äôre at the end of your date when you use it, they say they can only extend it by a month (usually).  The spa reception staff were happy to extend the remainder amount of my voucher for 2 months however - this wouldn‚Äôt suit anyone who doesn‚Äôt intend to visit Dublin again soon.

Location-wise the hotel is about 20 minutes drive from the city centre on the North West side. It‚Äôs in the countryside but not far from the M50 ring road.  Phoenix Park is about 15 minutes drive away.  Blanchardstown shopping centre isn‚Äôt too far either.  There‚Äôs no shuttle operated by the hotel into Dublin but there are regular buses within 5 mins walk and the train is also within walking distance.  We drove and found that the hotel car park had plenty of spaces and I liked the fact that you need a code to get out through the barrier.  The code is displayed on a board inside the hotel lobby entrance and it is also given to you on a slip of paper upon checking in.

All the staff we met were really lovely - a total credit to the hotel.  

I‚Äôd definitely stay again if I was back in Dublin and if they could guarantee a bed that‚Äôs softer than the ones we had.  

 I think a car is a necessity if you are staying here as taxis are expensive in Dublin and this is not a city centre hotel.  Anyone booking it would hopefully realise that Castleknock is not near Dublin City Centre.  I knew this to be the case so it doesn‚Äôt put me off at all.  It‚Äôs nice to have some peace and quiet! 

If I return I will also try the lobby patisserie as the menu looks great.  

I recommend the daiquiris in the lobby bar.

Had it not been for the hard beds I‚Äôd have rated this hotel four stars.",3,2020,01,13
223,Robinson suite,"Stayed for 1 night here with my partner and stayed in the Robinson suit. The hotel was amazing and the decor was beautiful. The room was beautiful and spacious. There was both a good strong shower and a jacuzzi bath tub. The staff were lovely and very friendly. The food was delicious and the breakfast was lovely. We had breakfast delivered to are room and i couldn't fault it. Beautifully left, plenty of food and tasted lovely. I would definitely reccomend this hotel and will be returning again.",5,2020,01,12
223,Afternoon Tea & Spa Treatment,"1st time in Castleknock Hotel, beautiful & very relaxing atmosphere in lobby with couches & Magazines to read, approached straight away by friendly Helpful Happy staff, in particular in the Restaurant, I think Ileana was her name seemed like manager, it was 2.30pm wed 18th Dec but she was so Friendly,helpful & even suprised us with a birthday desert for my daughter.

223,Excellent service and staff but food tastekess,"While the hotel itself is beautiful and the staff are very attentive, unfortunately the food was tasteless, breakfast was cold and the hotel was crawling with kids so not an ideal place for a couple! Scott Newman played that night and was brilliant also.",3,2020,01,01
223,Friendly service & gorgeous location,We stayed in this hotel for 4 nights. The location is close to the bus stop which was ideal for our day trips into Dublin city. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Buffet breakfast every morning (optional extra at a cost) was phenomenal with many options of hot and cold breakfasts. Our room was on the first floor - spacious and luxurious. We definitely will go back!,4,2019,12,30
223,Beautiful hotel,I went to this beautiful hotel with my family for lunch. The food was fantastic and the staff were professional.  I would recommend. The playground out the back was a perfect after meal distraction and great fun.,4,2019,12,26
223,amazing staff,The staff at Castleknock hotel are not only smiley and welcoming but also very attentive. We had dinner in the restaurant and it must have been mentioned as a passing comment that is was my boyfriend's birthday so for dessert a beautiful cake with candles was served to us by our lovely waitress. Very impressed as none of this had been requested. Shall definitely be staying there again!,5,2019,12,24
223,the perfect waiter,"we had a waiter in the earth and vine restraunt named Eoin, and he was nothing short of perfect, I would recommend the restraunt not only because the food was unbelievable, but the service was outstanding.",5,2019,12,21
223,Worth trying,Had never been here before so decided to try it. It‚Äôs a nice hotel üè® . The staff were very pleasant and helpful. The room was very spacious and had a view. It‚Äôs worth trying. Would come back here again.,4,2019,12,21
223,More relaxing than I could have imagined,"I went here with my mam for a birthday treat and every single member of staff that we came in contact with were so so nice and professional that I had to put up a review. Our afternoon tea was able to be brought forward a half an hour as we arrived earlier than expected. Ileana (hope I'm spelling that right) looked after us through the most delicious afternoon tea and even surprised me with a birthday dessert after hearing this day out was for my birthday. She was so thoughtful and professional throughout our time there.  After already being impressed by everything we were in good spirits for our treatments. Victoria was my therapist and again I was blown away by her skills and how helpful she was when telling me what would enhance my skin routine but not forcing me to buy anything at the same time.
We normally try different spas for my birthday day out but I was so impressed that I'll happily be back next year.
I hope this review is passed on to the ladies and that all staff has a lovely Christmas üéÑ",5,2019,12,18
223,Amazing food & stay,"Stayed here for work reasons. The food was fab, no complaints also we found that the  staff really made our meal special, they had no problems helping us with anything we asked for! Especially our waiter Eoin, he was great. Would definitely be back",5,2019,12,16
223,Gorgeous afternoon tea,We had the most wonderful afternoon tea at this hotel for a family birthday. Huge thanks to the wonderful and very attentive restuarant staff for being so kind and friendly. Nothing was too much trouble and we will be back again soon. Lovely hotel.,5,2019,12,16
223,Afternoon Tea,"Disappointing Experience. Afternoon tea was poor quality food (bread was stale, egg mayo was rubbery, deserts were clearly frozen or bought pre made and just re-heated or defrosted)  and massively over priced. The room was almost completely empty yet we were seated next to a large table who had a number of children which ran around the room, crawling underneath our table and shouting/wrestling each other on the floor. Of course this issue is due to bad parenting on the other guests behalf however staff should have offered to move us. We would have asked to be moved but it was very difficult to get their attention. When I booked the afternoon tea (as a birthday present for my partner) we were very much looking forward to the experience. It was very disappointing. My booking said the cost would be 52euro however upon payment the staff member said it would be 60euro as it was 30 euro per person on weekends. After explaining I have a email with the cost of our booking starting 52 euro the staff member changed the bill but staff seemed bored and uninterested in general. I had afternoon tea here before a couple of years ago and absolutely loved it but am sorry to say our recent experience was so bad I would never recommend it or book it again.",1,2019,12,16
223,Lunch,"Service was a little slow but ok and inattentive (but it was busy so understandable), waiter did not write the order down but it was only a toasted ham, cheese and onion sandwich, it came out luke warm with no ham on it (just cheese and onion).  It was fine, i ate it regardless, but i have to say, I was horrified when the bill came out for 8 euro for a toasted cheese sandwich on thin slice standard brown bread you would buy in spar for 3 euro.  Totally unacceptable charge.  I would not be coming back to pay 8 euro for a soggy luke warm cheese only toasted sandwich.  Bit disappointing all in.",2,2019,12,08
223,lovely clean hotel,"Nice hotel, too bad it's so far from anything.  Rained the entire time we were there.  Wish there was more things to do.  Breakfast buffet was good.  Staff were very friendly.  Being in Ireland we were expecting more traditional Irish dishes at dinner.",4,2019,12,07
223,Ok but some focus required.,"The main lobby/bar/restaurant of the hotel is all very nice. The rooms are somewhat dated in design however. The mattress was awful (one of the worst I have come across in a long time in fact) and ruined my back for a day. Bathroom was dated also. And the hotel uses the non steam type iron which are just useless.

Some fairly small improvements here would make all the difference but currently I would not return.",3,2019,12,05
223,Good and not so good,"We treated ourselves to an autumn/winter warmer deal and booked an executive double room. The room was big and had a bath and a separate walk in shower. The downsides to the room... it was a long walk from reception, I didn't realise how big the hotel was. The main problem was the mattress, it was not comfortable and we could feel the springs, so we didn't get a great nights sleep. I enjoyed the pool, sauna and steam room.. bring a euro coin with you for the lockers. We went for a pint at the bar before dinner and we were surprised how good the Guinness was. Dinner was really good and the service was great too. The biggest let down was the self serve breakfast. The grapefruit with added sugar was awful. Eggs were available 3 ways but they were barely warm. Hard poached eggs in a tub, awful scrambled eggs and fried eggs. Thankfully a fresh tray of fried eggs came out while we were there. The sausage and white pudding were good. There was waffles on the menu but we couldn't find any. They had two machines running that produced two tiny pancakes, these weren't good.",3,2019,12,01
223,Restaurant/Bar food,"We had battered fish and chips. Really nice battered cod. Nice atmosphere and lovely venue to relax. Staff were very nice. Unfortunately, desserts were a little disappointing. Apple crumble had very little crumble and the bonoffee pie didn't have a soft toffee layer. It was a hard piece of toffee placed separately in the dessert and completety change the flavour. Will defo be going back for food but might skip the dessert. ",3,2019,11,30
223,What a fantastic stay!,"Stayed last Thursday night with my sister having visited an elderly relative early in the day. This followed by a short shopping trip to the Blanchardstown SC meant that we could not wait to arrive at our final destination...the wonderful Castleknock Hotel. On check-in we were informed that we had been given a complimentary upgrade....the young lady on reception set the tone of what I can only describe as faultless customer service....this is obviously to the fore of their business model...one which other hotel could replicate!. Our room to the front of the hotel was spotless, warm & very comfortable. The beds were extremely comfortable with good quality duvets & pillows provided ensuring a good night‚Äôs sleep.
Dinner was included in our package...the standard of both service & food were more in keeping with a 5* property. 
I cannot wait to return in the near future & would have absolutely no hesitation in recommending this hotel to other. Thank you to all üòÅ",5,2019,11,24
223,Wonderful family party!,"In early November our family attended a birthday party at the hotel for my niece Helen, who is very special to us all. The whole family want me to say how very wonderful the hotel and all the staff made the whole evening for Helen - from the red carpet and staff lining out to greet her from the limo with a drink on a tray to the beautifully decorated room with big dance floor and the delicious food. Staff were at all times super efficient, friendly and warm. We all had a brilliant party - but most of all it will be a memory that our lovely Helen will treasure for years.",5,2019,11,24
223,Lovely hotel close to Phoenix Park.,"First time visitor. Very nice experience. Check in was quick and hassle free, overground car parking very accessible to main entrance, rooms very clean and nicely decorated.
A very good selection for breakfast and during  my stay it was not very busy and things were nice and relaxed!
Used pool also which I'd highly recommend if you get a chance.
Overall a great experience and I'm due back again on business at the end of Nov. so I'll be expecting more of the same!
Price of a pint of Guinness btw @ ‚Ç¨5.40 (I think) in bar is a bit on the high side I feel.",5,2019,11,19
223,Holiday ,"Spent the night here on route to centre parks situated just outside Dublin very nice first impressions good car park ( except for 2 silly disabled drivers that take up 3 disabled bays .nice reception  area
 Nice large light rooms 
Plenty of restaurant choice but pricey 
Added facilities is the Gym  and spare

223,Spa experience ,"We stayed for an overnight in Castleknock Hotel as my husband attending a conference.  After a stressful few weeks I decided to book a spa treatment rather then head for the shops.  I booked Elemis‚Äôdeeper then deep‚Äô hot stone massage and a Deluxe pedicure.  I arrived and was greeted by a very nice receptionist.  She showed me to changing rooms which are outside the spa and are for the swimming pool - did not feel relaxing there. I went back to the spa and met my therapist and we discussed the massage and I asked her to go as deep as possible with the stones, I regularly have deep tissue massage and unfortunately this one left a lot to be desired.  It did not go deep in and didn‚Äôt touch one knot of which I have many.  When it was over I was left to find my own way to another room for pedicure, I was given a luxury pedicure not the deluxe one I had booked.  When the therapist was finished she left saying I could go to the relaxation room when ready.  Nobody checked nail polish to see if it was dry.  I was left completely to my own devices.  I could actually have left the changing room and walked out of the hotel without paying.  When I went back to reception to pay, my ‚Ç¨165 was taken and that was it, I was not asked if I enjoyed the experience or if everything was ok for me - not a word.  I would consider the whole experience very disappointing and bad value. Definitely won‚Äôt be booking this spa again. ",2,2019,11,15
223,A warmly offered retraction.,"I previously submitted (following a very unpleasant experience) an extremely poor review of this property. Dispite receiving an initial TripAdvisor response from management,I was less optimistic about the management actually responding to my observations on the ground. To my delight I am happy to acknowledge that the vast majority of the issues I highlighted have been addressed.In particular the establishment of a furnished smoking area away from the front entrance. The ongoing improvements can also be seen in the considerablly lower turnover of staff which is always a good sign. There are still the odd hit and miss moments with service.But not the end of the world. I believe if someone issues a one star rating they are obliged to acknowledge the response from the property. Especially when the response is in the form of possitive action. With that said I am happy to give this (much improved) hotel a five star review.",5,2019,11,13
223,Excellent hotel,Fantastic hotel. Our second visit. Everything about hotel is really good. Lovely rooms great location and top leisure facilities. We will most likely return to the castleknock hopefully this coming Christmas again,5,2019,11,10
223,Room,"We have checked in this afternoon. The first impression was great same as checking in, girl at reception was nice and professional.
The room 117 - it was a cleanest room we ever saw! Spotless. I know what I am writing about as worked as accommodation supervisor many years. Well done accommodation team!",5,2019,11,10
223,Careful about hot food over the baby‚Äôs head!,"Seven us here for dinner on Sunday in the lounge area. We also had a baby with us. 
Service was good. The Croquettes (‚Ç¨11) starter was almost cold. 
Striploin Steak (‚Ç¨26) was good and no complaints heard about the Duck Bolognese (‚Ç¨18). 
Dinner is usually very good here but not for the first time, we had to ask two separate servers not to hold hot dishes over the baby‚Äôs head!
Management, please note!

223,Castleknock Hotel Review,"Stayed here before and again recently and it is a very nice hotel and I look forward to staying again soon. I had dinner bed and breakfast which is a great value package  although I would not be mad about the restaurant menu and would prefer the bar menu.  Also despite being asked multiple times 2 out of our 4 steak orders were placed wrong and not realised entailing a 25 minute wait for a replacement medium steak (3 mins?). 

Into the Lime Tree bar after dinner and a selection of speciality drinks were ordered. These drinks are expensive so when a martini at ‚Ç¨11.50 is served incorrectly without half it‚Äôs listed contents it is disappointing and feels a bit of a rip off.

Overall this is a lovely hotel with nice staff   but food and drink is priced for four star quality and service without necessarily consistently delivering what is expected. 
",4,2019,11,10
223,One night away,"I have stayed at this hotel quite a few times now....for Christmas parties, family gatherings, weddings and I truly can't complain about it at all.
Bedrooms are gorgeous always clean and tidy. The new rooms on the ground floor are a little smaller then what we have stayed in previously but they are at the back of the hotel with a little private area out patio doors.
Breakfast is beautiful so much to eat and waiters and waitresses are very accommodating and friendly.
We had a quick bite to eat before we went out in the restaurant and again service was great food great..no complaints.",5,2019,11,06
223,Disappointing - Not for families!,"Well what a disappointment! Family hotel - barely! Would not recommend for families...
Travel: A fair distance from Dublin itself.
Leisure: Swimming pool available between certain times only, other facilities not available for children under 16. We needed to ask for robes and slippers as these items were not provided automatically.
Play Area: 2 swings and one small slide for a large hotel was hardly accommodating.
Hotel room: Worn, dirty and family room is two double beds (children to share a bed); which suggests sleep quality for the little ones is not a priority for this hotel.
Restaurant: Slow and children‚Äôs food was cold. 
Social: No children‚Äôs entertainment. Only area to sit with children on a evening is the lobby area. Everywhere else is adults only.
When speaking with the duty manager we were informed that ‚Äúwe do tend to put families in the not so nicer part of the hotel‚Äù - the furthest away from the pool facilities. 
All in all really disappointing when paying that little extra in the hope that you make extra special memories with your children.",1,2019,11,03
223,Quick trip,"Stayed 2 nights in one of the suites, room was huge and plenty of space for the 3 of us. Requested a cot & this was placed in the room before we got there. Issue with noise on the first night but this was sorted straight away by the front desk staff. Breakfast was good with plenty of choices, staff were lovely & went the extra mile. Nice small playground for the kids, will stay again ",4,2019,11,02
223,Glossy veneer hiding numerous problems,"On the face of it, this place should be fantastic - and on entering, it certainly looks great. But there are far too many niggly problems to justify a 4* rating and I'm certainly not going to hurry back - except possibly for breakfast which was excellent. 
But let's start with the rooms. If you're on the 1st floor, you'll likely have an interconnecting door to another room and through it you can hear everything. It's like sharing a bedroom with guests who you can't see but who you get to know pretty intimately during the long and noisy night. The second night we moved the 2nd floor which (especially if you're at the far end of the corridor) is mercifully quiet. However, whichever floor you're on, there are the prisoner-of-war style car park lights trained on the hotel and shining straight into the bedrooms on the car-park side. Not only are there no black-out curtains or blinds, the scrappy ordinary curtains don't meet in the middle or cover the top and sides of the window. It's like trying to sleep in a sun-bed. 
Then there's the restaurant - the brasserie style one, not the posh one - where a salad comes without any dressing and when you ask for some, the waiter tells you there is no such thing. You ask for olive oil and some vinegar then. ""No"" he says again. You realise it's a language problem (some of the waiters speak very little English at all) and spell out your request again, suggesting he ask the chef for advice. He eventually returns with2  bowls of balsamic vinegar insisting there's no oil to be had. It took three goes but eventually the lovely restaurant manager brought some olive oil and we made our own dressing but seriously- it's 2019. Restaurants serving dinner salads in a 4* establishment (which isn't cheap) should stretch to a bit of salad dressing! I know, first world problems and all that, but this kind of thing matters when you're working and just want a simple light dinner and a good night's sleep. The former was a monumental effort, the last requires a brown paper bag over your head.",3,2019,11,01
223,Afternoon Tea,First time to visit for afternoon tea & I will be back; would recommend 100%. From the welcome on arrival; friendly staff; variety of goods on offer ; glass of Prosecco; wonderful afternoon spent with friends. Haven‚Äôt stopped talking about it to other friends. Thanks again. ,5,2019,10,30
223,Nice Amenities,"This is the best hotel I stayed so far from the multiple trips I did in the month of October and September,little bit run down but Maintance is perfect.The breakfast is delicious,the room is tidy,very nice swimming pool,little distance from airport and City Center,calm environment.
I sincerely enjoyed my stay here and would definitely stay here again.",5,2019,10,30
223,Family break ,"After an issue in the room was dealt with when we arrived we were truly impressed with this hotel,it‚Äôs our second trip and must say the staff from manager to waiters were all great so friendly and accommodating.!! We did the wine and dine on night two and food was excellent as was our waiter sorry we didn‚Äôt get his name,but he was simply fabulous at his job nothing was too much trouble. On both nights instead of dessert the chefs made us up a beautiful cheese board which wasn‚Äôt on the menu.Overall a super stay thanks so much.",5,2019,10,28
223,A little disappointed ,"I had good expectations from
This hotel as the reviews were good and the hotel looked very nice. 
We arrived and the first annoying thing was the check in, slow, with one of the girls who maybe was new and it took ages to check us in.
I requested a nice room with something special as it was my bf birthday, and i made sure this was all confirmed before arriving to the hotel .But again my room was not as I expected and there was a tiny dessert in the table probably put in there from the morning. 
The coffee machine didn‚Äôt work properly and there was no drinking water in the room. I went to the front desk and asked for water and to have a look at the coffee machine. When i came back to the room we found 2 bottles of water and one of the coffee cups filled with coffee, dirty, probably to show me that it was working now, and just one coffee capsule. I think for a 4 stars hotel and for the price i have paid for one night, they should have offered a better service. I think is a nice hotel but service is of a 2 stars. ",3,2019,10,27
223,So much potential but unrealised,"This is a hotel that if it was in the hands of a major chain would achieve its full potential.
It has been this way for a decade!
Monday to Friday it is a proper business hotel but weekends it reverts to a beer swilling scrum.
Weekends are kids out of control, bogan weddings and noisy entertainers of average to poor quality but loud.
All this with Eastern European staff with poor English skills and a low level of training .
If run by Accor or Hilton it would be a must book.
All the ingredients are there but management couldn‚Äôt run a 3 star motel.
The investor owners clearly know no better.
Over a decade of mediocrity!",3,2019,10,20
223,Nicola‚Äôs and Joe‚Äôs stay as part of Nutricia Event 18th/19th October 2019,"We arrived at 4.40pm on the Friday evening. The hotel was fairly easy to find. On arriving, there was a red carpet!! Not for us (there was a wedding)! We checked in at Reception and the staff there as was the staff in the bar and restaurant, very efficient. The food we had for dinner was quite pricey but all the same, quite nice. The sticky toffee pudding was delicious!! And so was Joe‚Äôs pizza (I had a tiny taste). The entertainment in the foyer which was a solo singer with his guitar and music set up was very good. We had a nice relaxing time in the foyer with a couple of drinks. The breakfast the next morning was set up by Nutricia which was absolutely delicious with plenty of choice. The hotel is ver plush and posh. Overall, we were very pleased with our hotel experience. The room is gorgeous!!",4,2019,10,19
223,Disappointed in the room,"Stayed before with my son and. Very nice room but on my own this time and booked a single room. It is very definitely single, tiny, small tv, very small sink and toilet push right against the wall. It is also on the corner of the corridor with considerable footfall quite loud as people pass. Very unimpressed. The rest of the hotel is great, nice pool and gym and plenty to Boise from for eating. ",2,2019,10,18
223,Nice hotel with great staff,"I visited the hotel for a conference staying for 3 nights, so long enough to say this is a nice hotel with helpful staff. 
The rooms are to a good standard and with enough room to spread you stuff out. The bathroom had a bath and separate shower, so no taking you life in your hands stepping out of the bath after taking a show, a big plus for me.
They offer a good buffet breakfast, not sure of the cost as it was in my package price.
The bar is well stocked with a selection of draft beers, and the bar staff are great.

On the down side, the hotel is in a rural area, so you need a car or taxi, but is that a real down side, you decide.

I would be happy to recommend this hotel, but if you are visiting to explore the city shops and bars it is possible a little too far from the city.",4,2019,10,18
223,Can‚Äôt wait to go back,"My other half and I decided we needed to have a nice night away to de-stress and treat ourselves! This hotel is the best option being only a short trip on the motorway and away from the madness of city centre. We had a gorgeous meal in the main restaurant, and while it was busy... the service was great and it felt quite spacious (not in elbows reach of another person like some spots!)
There was live music after in the bar after dinner which was a great way to chill out with a nightcap! 
A few lengths of the gorgeous pool to wake up before  breakfast was just what my head needed, and the food was so good we stayed for lunch too! 
We genuinely didn‚Äôt want to leave! Keep up the super service!! Hope to book in again over Xmas!!",5,2019,10,16
223,Dublin weekend,"We had a very nice room, that was clean and well furnished. 
Very nice staff throughout  especially Hannah and Ajay on reception who were very helpful. 
Breakfast was very good as was dinner too with plenty of choice.
There is a swimming pool and gym , a huge car park and relaxing public areas. 
It is a 15 minute taxi ride to the city centre. 10 mins or so to Pheonix park where Dublin zoo is. 
Personally, I think the hotel would benefit by having a shuttle service (Even one way) into Dublin city centre as taxi fares build up if you want to go into Dublin a few times.
We took a city sightseeing bus tour from Pheonix park which offered a round trip to the sights.",5,2019,10,10
223,"Wow, great, peaceful, plenty to do, great to ""commute"" into dublin town without driving","Spa, fabulous, great knowledge and application. Gym small but functional, rooms very very clean and well decorated, homely and incredibly quiet and warm. Staff, were do I start and finish, so so helpful and nothing too much.",5,2019,10,09
223,Wedding venue,"We had a wonderful day and evening last Saturday 5 th October 2019 .
My daughters wedding.
Civic marriage,function,meal ,service ,bedroom ,great value for money excellent all around place.
The staff were so helpful.
I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel for a wedding ,celebrations etc.",5,2019,10,08
223,Great hotel,"Really liked this hotel, quick check in. Nice bar and lobby. Breakfast is great well staffed. Rooms are large and clean. Very quiet. Pool and gym are well maintained. Staff are friendly. Free parking. Good location to Phoenix park. 

Cons
Food is expensive. Had a pizza very mediocre. Turn the heating down in the lobby. ",5,2019,10,05
223,Awful noise and staff couldn't care less,"I stayed there for 3 nights. First 2 nights in one of those rooms with a connecting door so you can hear your neighbour cough all night. 
The last night I returned to the hotel to a massive function in full swing around midnight. Unfortunately an entire wing of the hotel is above the function room and I was directly above it.rang reception at 00.40 to be told at least another hour of ear splitting bass from below.Guests angrily opening doors in corridor to discuss the commotion.rang reception at 01.40 am to be told at least another half hour of dj hits blasting throughout the hotel.i eventually moved rooms at 01.55 to the House of Pains ""jump around "".
The next morning I realised I'd left some toiletries in the original room. I wrote a letter to manager (see enclosed).complained at reception on check out.apologies but hey ho that's life I'm told.no reimbursementon toiletries or all night din. No response to complaint or letter .
Bog standard busy hotel.as soon as you've paid the service ends there.happy to pack in functions until 2am with gig level music to the disbelief of paying guests above.
My advice to anyone is to go there if they are hard of hearing but under no circumstances accept a room on the first floor if they enjoy sleeping before 3am.bog standard ",1,2019,10,05
223,Our Wedding Day,"On behalf of my new husband and I, I would like to thank Castleknock Hotel from the bottom of our hearts for providing us with the most beautiful wedding day. Everything from start to finish on the day was perfect. The quality of the food provided from the welcome canapes right through to the evening nibbles was outstanding. Any queries or questions I had in the run up to the day were answered swiftly and any concerns I had were dealt with above and beyond what was expected. 

We have received so many compliments from guests who were so impressed with the level of service and attention to detail provided by the hotel. We would like to mention in particular Audrey who was one of our main points of contact in the run up to the wedding and who was there on the day to make sure everything went perfectly. Her warm and caring nature made us feel so relaxed and we are extremely grateful to her for all her support. Kevin in the ballroom was also an absolute dream and we were very impressed with his manner and the effort he went to to make sure we were delighted with everything.

I would recommend Castleknock Hotel to any couple looking for a hotel that truly cares about it's wedding couples and will go above and beyond to ensure they have the perfect day. The quality of the service and food on offer is 2nd to none.

Breakfast the next morning was tasty, fresh and plentiful. We can't wait to return to the hotel to celebrate other special occasions in the future. 

The bridal suite was beautiful and lots of our guests commented on how comfortable their rooms were.",5,2019,10,04
223,Beautiful hotel,"Booked in here for one night 
Wonderful food bar room very good staff lovely to 
Golf course next door 
Amazing views 
 didn‚Äôt have  time to play a game next time  a must 
Hotel very near Phoenix park worth a visit to",4,2019,09,30
223,Family with toddler,"My husband, my toddler and I stayed here for 3 nights in September 2019.  We really enjoyed our stay and that was especially thanks to some of the staff in the hotel. We met Trish every morning when we went to breakfast and she was amazing with our son, there was also Sanda and another lady (I didnt get her name) that were brilliant too.  In the evenings at dinner, Olivier provided a great service. I really loved the little touches in the hotel like the Nespresso machine in our room and the blankets, sun cream and sun glasses at the back door.  We used the pool and the playground every day during our stay.  The room was spotless too.  We will definatley be returning again.",5,2019,09,28
223,Perfect Night,"We stayed at Castleknock hotel for one night but I wish it had been our whole trip.  Hotel was gorgeous, restaurant was great, and the staff were helpful and friendly.  Room was clean and good sized, and had a nice shower.",5,2019,09,19
223,A Fantastic Return,"Having previously worked in the hotel, it was exciting to be sitting in the a boardroom rather than setting up one. My business partner and I worked in the Ashtown Suite for 2 days working on strategy and the overall hospitality service was fantastic. Kevin and his highly skilled team of Hans, Stuart, Lee and Emma were a pleasure to deal with.

We will be back again!",5,2019,09,17
223,Excellent Hotel ,"We stayed at the Castleknock Hotel recently for a night we our 3 kids and we absolutely loved it. A great hotel location, fabulous staff and excellent facilities. It was easy to find from the motorway and very welcoming. We booked the restaurant and really enjoyed the food and wine. The room was spacious (for 2 adults & 3 kids) very comfortable and it is great having a smart TV in the room allowing us access to Netflix. Beds were very comfortable. Breakfast was plentiful and really nice. Tje grounds around hotel are excellent. Will definitely return and maybe bring my clubs! ",5,2019,09,13
223,"Nice, quiet, serene location but average hotel and service","I would say it is a decent hotel to stay in for the price it charges.
Location may be a bit out of the way but it is serene, tucked in a ""corner"" and beside a golf course.
Breakfast was pretty standard - nothing to rave about. Restaurant serves pretty decent quality meals.
Nice bar for drinks. There is an outdoor dining, drinking or chilling area.
Staff was friendly and helpful.
Rooms are a bit dated (much like the hotel building as well) but functioning.
Nothing fantastic but does provide quiet stay for business travelers or family on no agenda breaks.",3,2019,09,11
223,Barman was a gent,"This hotel is brilliant. Whether it be the staff or the general area, it is fantastic!!
An absolute special mention to Graham and Killian at the bar. Two special fellas at the bar who served ESB!

All the best,
Aaron",5,2019,09,10
223,"Great attention to detail, friendly and very luxurious interiors.","We stayed for a wedding over five days. The staff were so wonderful and helpful. Food was affordable and of high quality. It was the little things that I was impressed by. Sunglasses with their logo, hand wipes with a beautiful scent, damp face cloths, sun screen, arranged on a table by their garden. Playground, pool and fantastic, modern decor. Would recommend whether it be for a family or couple.",4,2019,09,10
223,Brilliant hotel for travelling as a family,"First time staying here, we only stayed one night 2nd Sep. 2 adults and a toddler (21months) in a deluxe family room which could have accommodated a family of 4. Room was spacious with tv (which we could watch Netflix on) fridge, bath and separate shower. All toiletries in bathroom. Iron, ironing board, bath robes and slippers. Kettle with plenty of tea and coffee and hot choc in room. 
We contacted hotel before our stay to make sure a travel cot was available, no issues cot was in room and ready. 
We used the swimming pool during our stay which was lovely (though to note you need to wear swimming caps which we didn‚Äôt realise and had to buy at ‚Ç¨3 each)
Playground also available for children, sadly we couldn‚Äôt use as was raining. 
Hotel itself is beautiful inside. We ate at the restaurant bar 22 for dinner, food was good and the waiting staff were wonderful with our child and even brought him a colouring book and crayons to entertain him without us needing to ask. We also had breakfast here which was included in our stay. Everything from cereals, porridge, full breakfast including beans, eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, toast. Yoghurts and fruit. 
We also had a Dublin zoo pass included in our stay which we easily got from reception on arrival. Also the hotel has facilities to heat baby food up, just had to speak to a member of staff, which we used on one occasion as he‚Äôs a fussy eater sometimes so that was so handy and easy. 
Overall the staff here were so lovely to us, very friendly and welcoming. Wish I could remember the names of more staff but one particular Ramona she made our little boy feel so special. Staff are a credit to the hotel. Wish we could‚Äôve stayed more than one night and we will definitely be back. ",5,2019,09,09
223,Great Hotel,"My husband and I stayed here for our anniversary.  The bedroom was quiet bright and very comfortable and the breakfast was delicious.  The staff were friendly and very helpful.  We would stay here again.
",4,2019,09,06
223,Attending a wedding in Lucan,"We chose this hotel as were are attending a wedding in Lucan with the reception at Luttrellstown Castle and Castleknock was ideal

Rooms very clean and we were allowed to check in prior to 4pm which was nice. A 4pm check in is rather late for guests

Facilities are great spar pool and well stocked gym. There is also a golf course were guests can enjoy reduced green fees

Plenty of parking which is secure. The hotel is about a 20 minute taxi ride from the air port and the same into Dublin

The Republic of Ireland were also staying at the hotel following  an international football match 

I would recommend this hotel but prices are high we enjoyed a discount as we booked so many rooms. 

When the sun shines there is a very nice terrace area to sit",4,2019,09,06
223,Wedding was amazing,"The food, the room the staff were all amazing for the whole day and night anything you needed you only needed to ask...
My only issue with the hotel bar is that they didn‚Äôt sell WKD or any drinks similar only in the reception bar after the wedding..",4,2019,09,04
223,22 Bar and restaurant at Castleknock Hotel,Appalling food and even worse service. When served main courses one main course was served cold. Waited half an hour for the dinner to be reserved by which time everybody else had finished meal. No apology no accountability. Nobody actually seemed to care! Would never return,1,2019,09,03
223,Upscale and lovely,"A bit off the beaten path, and full of extras. Spa, golf, several restaurants, copious lounges and bar service. Breakfast is included, dinner has some great options. I recommend the duck Bolognese highly. Staff, good. Decor, very nice.",5,2019,09,03
223,Nice stay!,"Very beautiful hotel, not small as meant to serve large group of Clients and host conference events etc.. However, very well designed just in front of a beautiful golf club. Good breakfast served and convenient fitness center / spa. Only thing perhaps is the distance from other areas of the City, not only the historic center, due to the typically jammed M50 routes. Definitively recommended for those not in a rush.",4,2019,09,01
223,For wedding,Overall good staying and the rooms may need update also iron need to replace as its not working properly. Also the breakfast area too mixed up. I order cappuccino and they charge me for it but I don‚Äôt drink any tea or coffee!,4,2019,08,30
223,"Great  hotel, but please keep your in house Arguments private.","We arrived for a 2 nights stay on August 23rd . We can't complain about the cleanliness,  facilities,  food and service we recieved from any of the staff from this beautiful hotel. But the one issue I have is the blatant bullying attitude from a senior bar staff towards he's hard working colleagues on the both nights we were there. I felt he's loud  negative attitude created more stress for the staff and the guests who were socialising in the bar area. I try and use this website to promote positive comments on any establishment's I visit, and refrain from any views I may have regarding negative experiences I happen to experience.  But, as a union representative,  it angered and saddened me greatly that a senior employee could vocally reprimand he's hard working staff in front of so many people on so many occasions on the 2 nights we were there. A more mature, calm and subtle approach to he's staff would have been much appreciated by he's colleagues and the many people in our company trying to enjoy a quiet drink. Please, be assured that this issue aside , we were more than pleased with the fantastic treatment we received from the staff that should be applauded for there hard work.",4,2019,08,29
223,Disappointing Afternoon Tea,"Rang up a few days before to book afternoon tea and everything seemed okay. I had booked afternoon tea for my mums Birthday and my sister and brother were coming to. We arrived a little early and it was very busy but we went towards the restaurant which has a spot where the host should have been but wasn't. We asked some other staff who went to find the host but for ages we just waited finally we asked could we wait in the restaurant as they located the host. We waited nearly 30minutes to finally be told my booking didn't appear to be there but they said they would still accommodate us. 

We went into a really nice room that is set up for teas. We had a really nice waiter called Eoin who despite the mix up was very accommodating. Another member of staff asked us to clarify when I booked and was I sure it was for that day which I confirmed it was. 

Our waiter Eoin was excellent but a little over stretched as there was wedding going on so there were a few small things that were over looked. Small thing but initially we had no teaspoons and the water for our tea wasn't quite hot enough. We didn't have pastry forks which would have been handy for our lovely raspberry cheesecakes. The food was excellent and I loved the scones. Attention to detail is still something to be improved and also ensuring staff are just focused on great service for one room.",2,2019,08,23
223,The perfect hotel,"First visit to Dublin for my 30th Birthday with my other half and this hotel could not be faulted from the moment we arrived to the moment we departed everything was perfect, the food, the room, the staff couldn‚Äôt do any more for us. Stayed 3 nights with breakfast and spa facilities included. Close 5 minute walk to a bus stop for cheap transfer into the city, only a 25min drive from Dublin airport. Thank you for a wonderful stay and we will be returning and wouldn‚Äôt stay anywhere else. ",5,2019,08,23
223,One of the Best Hotels I've Stayed in,"I really enjoyed my stay. The hotel is away from the hustle and bustle of Dublin- perfect for exploring Phoenix Park. Staff were courteous, efficient and friendly -from arrival to departure. The room (executive) was clean, well equipped & nicely furnished.

Dinner was delicious, beautifully presented and waiting staff were excellent. Portions were just right (and I have a good appetite!)
Carrot, corriander, coconut soup - best Ive tasted.
Corn fed Chicken - potatoes, hazelnuts, greens - Perfectly cooked- delicious.
Chocolate mousse and ice-cream - a work of art on a plate -yum!. 

The pool was smaller than I expected, but that said - it was very clean as was sauna/steam room/jacuzzi. Also, didn't feel too chlorinated (pool/sauna) which was was good! 

A wide range of foods to suit all tastes for breakfast. 

Overall. I found my stay excellent value and would certainly stay again - top marks!

An interesting quirk - very little condensation in bathroom - and mirrors didn't steam up like you'd expect after a shower. Generous bottles of filtered water in rooms and a nespresso machine (though only one capsule was provided). 

All the staff were lovely - room service was working extremely hard by the looks of things - one of the most difficult jobs in any hotel - room was immaculate and a credit to the staff.",5,2019,08,23
223,Excellent experience,"From the second we arrived we were very well looked after, we had afternoon tea booked for four of us and our waiter, Eoin , was professional and attentive the entire time we spent there.The food was excellent and we had a wonderful time.The staff in general are very helpful but Eoin shone like a star, very friendly and chatty and attended to all our needs. I will definitely recommend to friends and family as this hotel is fabulous,lovely chilled atmosphere in beautiful surroundings. Most definitely My favourite place to have afternoon tea. (Also love the soap and hand lotion in the ladies, smells fab!)",5,2019,08,23
223,Afternoon tea,"Hi

Just wanna send a quick review of our afternoon tea yesterday...
Myself and my sisters and a friend went..as soon as we went it we were so nicely greeted by eoin our waiter..for the whole afternoon he was absolutely excellent..he has a fantastic personality and made us feel so comfortable and looked after..it was 2 of our birthdays and he came out singing happy birthday on his own lol..
The food was beautiful and we felt great value. The decor is stunning.. and we loved the black napkins lol hides lipstick lol  
Thanks for such a fab afternoon and we will definitely be back to the hotel again hopefully for an overnight stay..
And a special thanks to eoin a lovely lovely waiter xxx glenda",5,2019,08,22
223,Exceptional Hotel with great management.,"Just returned from a 2 night break in Castleknock, to celebrate my wife‚Äôs birthday.  The hotel has undergone extensive upgrading to reception, restaurants, and bar areas, and looks amazing. The breakfast and food in the restaurant was delicious, with a great selection to chose from.Our room was spacious, very clean, and great comfy bed. 
It was the staff, especially Andrew that made us feel so welcomed. Andrew and his team made us feel special, and valued, and we are very much waiting to our next visit.",5,2019,08,20
223,The devil in the details,"Booked through Booking.com.  Last night on arrival there were two receptionists on duty but I still had to wait. The receptionist seemed unsure as to how payment should be made.  Today late morning, I‚Äôve been sitting waiting for a coffee for 30 minutes. It has just been served after two reminders. The paper on the floor and the remains of food on the table are from previous clients. I did ask for it to be cleaned but!  Admittedly it is busy but there are only two baristas on duty, who, although quite polite and friendly, could do with further training.  However rooms are clean, comfortable and cosy. Breakfast was excellent, staff are polite and friendly but are either badly managed or need further training. This is day one. Had I not had to wait so long for the coffee I probably wouldn‚Äôt have had time to comment. The sloppiness and lack of attention to detail is really not acceptable at this level of accommodation. ",2,2019,08,15
223,High Tea - Delicious,"This is a busy family oriented hotel. Unusually as you enter the hotel you walk straight into an entrance hall with coffee dock and comfortable seating in cosy nooks. Off this central area is reception to the left and restaurant straight ahead. Extremely busy and child friendly you can be at ease in this hotel. As we had booked high tea we were shown to a separate area adjacent to the restaurant. Quieter, bright and comfortable furnished it is a very pleasant area to sit and relax. Delicious and beautifully presented food arrives on a rustic wooden stand. Tea is replenished as many times as required. The service is outstanding, the many servers were friendly and attentive. The chefs choice of finger food, ingredients used and quantity of food is generous and delicious. I would recommend this family friendly hotel mainly due to the standard of food and the charming staff.",4,2019,08,11
223,Excellent staff,"Stayed with a group friends. The hotel is beautiful, made use of all amenities which were lovely. What made the hotel stand out were your staff, I've never left a hotel knowing more about the people who work there, from all the conversations we had. They are a class of their own and they are what makes this hotel so special. Also enjoyed the afternoon tea, we were absolutely stuffed with all the options we got and it was beautifully presented again with great staff who were attentive and chatty without being overbearing.",5,2019,08,11
223,Nice for a staycation,"Lovely hotel in a great location if you have a car. Very close to blancharstown center which has a large selection of shops and restaurants. The pool is lovely and is very clean. Bedrooms are also very clean . I would recommend going for a superior room as the standard rooms lack air conditioning and can be very warm. Stayed here previously and breakfast in bed was an option, was disappointed to find that this no longer seemed to be possible. I would recommend this hotel to families with young children due to the playground, the pool and the fact that even though it‚Äôs a good four star hotel it still manages to be family friendly without looking like a Creche! Also due to its proximity to attractions such as the zoo.",4,2019,08,08
223,Loved this hotel!,"My husband and I stayed here to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Check in was quick - we arrived at 1.30pm and our room was ready! Our room was fantastic / beautiful views over the golf course and the decor was lovely with rose petals over the bed. After 10minutes housekeeping arrived with chocolates and a card. Small touches like these are just perfect. Hotel location was easy to get to and we got the 37 bus into Dublin ‚Ç¨3.30 each way. Bus stop was less than 5mins walk from the hotel and drops you in centre of Dublin and the drive which takes about 40minutes is lovely! 
The pool area is lovely at the hotel and we really enjoyed the sauna, steam room and jacuzzi!
We got pizza in the bar which was very tasty. Also we had breakfast which to be honest was the best breakfast in a hotel I have had! It was delicious! There was a waiter from Donegal who was very nice and chatted to us so big shout out to him!
We will definitely stay again here but next time bring our daughter as I know she would love it too! :) ",5,2019,08,07
223,Wedding ,We attended a wedding here recently we booked a superior room for our stay.When we arrived the reception looked a bit busy so we decided to get a drink and come back later at the bar we were disappointed that they didn't sell the particular drink my wife drinks but he said that they sell it in the bar where the wedding was happening next door to the bar we were in I ask if he would be kind enough to go in and get a drink for her the answer was no we can't do that you will have to wait for the room to be opened. So went back to reception and stood in line for around 15 minutes got to the top after awhile we received our room key went to the room it was by no means a superior room it looked the same as other rooms we had seen but we were told no it was also the rooms were so hot we left the window open but it did no help there was a fan in the room that had seen better days. The wedding meal was really tasty but very slow took over 2 plus hours. The price of the drinks were pretty expensive and varied form one bar to the function room. We had breakfast included which was served buffet style it was very busy and you had to get in line for toast and the for the hot food not a great steak up for a hotel of this caliber overall  a bit disappointing ,3,2019,08,06
223,Parents night off,"Spent an impromptu night in the hotel with my husband. Room was lovely,  overlooked the golf course. Bed was very comfortable and we were supplied with robes and slippers, bottled water and lots of toiletries. 
At first glance I was disappointed by the amount of children running around the bar/reception area, however I could see why the hotel would be a good choice for families as there are plenty of facilities for children. Being away without our children we were delighted to see there was a bar for adults only. And they stocked a good selection of beers and spirits with a good cocktail list. 
Breakfast was delicious with lots of choice. We used the pool, sauna,  steam room and jacuzzi. 
We enjoyed our stay and would return again. I'd recommend for both couples and families. 
I'd also like to add the following based on some other reviews I read. Ths hotel was very busy and there was an event in the function room. We didn't feel let down by the service we received because of this. Our wait times were short and all staff we encountered were pleasant.",5,2019,08,05
223,"Hotel clearly struggling with occupancy level, rooms have seen better days - overall very disappointing","On arrival we had to queue for 30 minutes to checkin. When we finally made it to the desk there wasn‚Äôt even so much as an apology for the wait. But we were one of the lucky ones as we actually left the desk with keys for our interconnecting rooms - most people were being told their rooms weren‚Äôt ready despite it being after their very late 4pm checkin time. 

On making it to the room - for which we were paying over ‚Ç¨300 for the night - the room was clearly past its best. They furniture was old and tatty, there were marks on the wall, a tear in a curtain and a general sense of the place being jaded. Our ‚Äòview‚Äô overlooked a flat roof with cigarette butts, an old battery and a pint glass. 

The restaurant was seriously struggling and despite many empty tables we had to wait 40 minutes to be seated. At one stage while waiting I asked if I could order some garlic bread to keep us going as I‚Äôd 3 starving children and was told they couldn‚Äôt take orders as they didn‚Äôt want to put the kitchen under any more stress!  God knows where the stress was coming from as it couldn‚Äôt have been the restaurant. When we finally got to eat the food was average. 

On returning to our room we discovered it to be directly over the function room which was host to a ridiculously loud event which went on well into the night so not much sleep for any of us! 

Any staff we interacted with were courteous but to the point. There were no niceties. These were clearly people under pressure and I‚Äôm sure they were doing their best but the strain was abundantly clear. The management have a lot to answer for as the whole place was obviously under staffed for the number of people there.  

It beggars belief that you can charge a family so much and deliver so little. What was meant to be a treat ended up being an endurance test. Spend your hard earned money elsewhere.",2,2019,08,04
223,Nice hotel however item stolen from room.,"Stayed at this hotel recently for two nights.its a lovely hotel however unfortunately we had a amazon tablet stolen from our room,it was mentioned to reception several times however no response.very upsetting as room was,obviously accessed when we were out and tablet was taken.restaurant is very overpriced also.wouldnt stay here again.",2,2019,08,04
223,Compact but Comfortable Room,"I spent one night  last weekend ( Sunday) at this place which I had booked at short notice. As a single occupant  I was to be assigned a ""compact"" room for the night. 
When I arrived it was indeed compact; probably the smallest hotel room I have ever stayed in. However in truth I am not complaining. The room was clean and comfortable 
with all the ""bits and pieces"" one would expect of a room in a Four Star establishment. As it was in the eastern end of the hotel and up on the top floor I had a fine view of the Dublin Mountains out the front window looking south as well as the benefit of the Glorious Sunshine on the morning of my departure. 
I made good use of the Leisure facilities on both the Sunday Afternoon and Monday morning. I was well satisfied with the meal I had in the 22 Bar and Resturant there as well as breakfast on Monday morning: the food been of high quality. 
There was a generous amount of outdoor seating at the back of the hotel (just outside Bar 22) making a couple of evening drinks that bit more enjoyable. 
The overall service from the staff was polite and professional making this short stay in the Castleknock fully enjoyable.",4,2019,08,01
223,Terrible service and overpriced,"We were staying for a weekend as part of a wedding. From the minute we arrived we had a bad experience from start to finish. We were told our room wouldn‚Äôt be ready until after 5pm. This was extremely inconvenient as the wedding started at 4.30pm. So we couldn‚Äôt check in then until after half 6. Also, some people got their rooms at 2pm!!! We were one of the first people to book a room out of the whole wedding party so found this bizarre.

The shower pole in our room was broken and no bath robes or slippers were provided in the rooms. Not once were we offered fresh towels or toilet rolls for the weekend. It‚Äôs as if we weren‚Äôt even there? 
I called reception to order a sandwich to my room at 12.30am (obviously this service is available as they know people are attending weddings and may not have eaten since dinner) and I was treated like an inconvenience. The man (his name may have been Greg) was so rude to me over the phone. He made me feel bad for ordering this late, huffing and puffing and never once said‚Äùthat‚Äôs not a problem‚Äù and it took 40 minutes to drop up a toasted sandwich!! My advice: don‚Äôt provide the service if it‚Äôs too much hassle. 

The food is good but my god is it overpriced! ‚Ç¨17 for a burger and handful of chips. Also; service was super slow in bar. Understand they are busy but then there should be more staff on. 

We called reception to Enquire about a late check out and explained we were late getting our room so a late checkout should have been offered on arrival as a way of apologising. We were told they would need to ask the operational team and they would call us back. Never heard anything back after that.

Overall, I felt Wedding guests were treated as an inconvenience. I know this because others had shared their similar experiences with me from the weekend. It‚Äôs a shame as I love visiting hotels in Ireland but this was hands down the worst I‚Äôve stayed in in a while. Does not deserve 4 stars due to lack of customer service.

Staff in restaurant were friendly, other than that they were not professional.

223,fabulous hotel,"my daughter,  my husand and myself stayed here 19 to 21 July 2019 and we were made to feel special from the onset.  On speaking to other guests they had the same views as us, breakfast, the spa area and the room were excellent.  It made our trip to a family wedding in Trim most pleasant.   We would definitely stay here again.....",5,2019,07,25
223,Beautiful hotel,"We enjoyed a three night stay at Castleknock Hotel, which we thoroughly enjoyed.  The hotel was very busy with many tourists from different places of the world, atmosphere was buzzing.  

We had a lovely room, however view wasn't great, overlooking work area, which was quite noisy at times.  This meant we couldn't keep our windows open at night which caused major issues as our stay was during a beautiful spell of hot sunny weather.  Our room was extremely hot and although the fan provided helped a little, we just couldn't sleep well due to the hot room.  I do understand this is a nice problem to have while holidaying in Ireland as normally the weather isn't as beautiful.  Although air conditioning would have made our stay more comfortable during this visit, I totally understand it's not something that would always be needed. 

Any staff we met were very friendly and extremely helpful.  They are a great credit to the hotel.

Food was delicious throughout our stay.

We really enjoyed our stay and would recommend this hotel.

223,Executive room...hahahaha,"
Went into room. Like a sauna. Turned the table fan on and....nothing. Fridge couldn't have been warmer if it was on fire. Booked this place for a 2 night stay...wont be coming back. Really put a downer on my visit here. Nite on outside but no Aircon??? Makes it worse that air conditioning is on as you go to reception....to find your room is on fire! 

I've given it 3 stars as the room would be nice if it was actually air conditioned!",3,2019,07,23
223,Overall poor.,"We stayed for 2 nights midweek. The service during lunch was very poor from wrong food, having to ask for tea 3 times and a gluten  free menu which contained gluten!. When we got to our room which which quite warm but equipped with a fan and water, there was still empty bottles outside the door. We had to request an extra fan 3 times before we got one. On the 2nd day there was a gin glass outsode the door for about 4 hours even tho there was staff on the floor all day. Not sure how it even got there as we had no drink in the room. I ordered drinks at the bar then the barperson served someone else while I was left waiting to pay. The pool area was very nice and my 5 year old son loved it. the breakfast service was also good with one lady extremly helpful I think Catherine was her name. Over all for a 4 star hotel it was a let down with poor service and poor attention to detail.",2,2019,07,23
223,"Wonderful hotel, wonderful staff","I stayed here for two weeks and overall was very impressed. The hotel is lovely and clean and the staff do a very good job. The amenities are very nice i.e the pool, jacuzzi, steam room, and sauna. It‚Äôs very nice that they have a few hours in the morning and the evening where it‚Äôs adults only as it was a nice time to relax without noise. The restaurant Earth and vine has excellent food and service. I really enjoyed the few nights I went in there for dinner. The only downside is that it seems to be rented out a lot for parties, but no big deal. The staff overall was very personable and friendly towards me which is quite refreshing. Every employee seemed to go above and beyond to say hello or ask me if I needed anything or how my stay was going. One of the employees who stood out to me was Cormac. He always had a smile on his face and always asked me how I was enjoying the hotel, or asking me how my meals in the restaurant were, or recommending things on the menu. He has the ideal personality to be working in hospitality and you can tell he genuinely cares about customer satisfaction. Orliath (Apologies if the spelling isn‚Äôt accurate) was also one of my favorite employees to run into at the more casual pub/restaurant. She‚Äôs just delightful and has a personality that makes you feel welcomed and warm. I would definitely stay here again in the future, and would recommend this hotel.",5,2019,07,23
223,Bar Grub,"Visited with o/h and I ordered Caribbean chicken curry with chips when arrived came with rice also, I found it be sweet curry with the pineapple but lacking spices could have done with more sauce  also I had cheesecake which was delicious 
My o/h had pulled brisket of beef and enjoyed it
Cost ‚Ç¨17 curry and extra ‚Ç¨5 for fries
Floors under table need sweeping 
 Waiter was helpful",3,2019,07,23
223,Spa Treatment Twice the price and not even half as good as many alternatives,Spa treatment for ‚Ç¨150 which is not even listed on the website (no prices shown) was very poor. Did not do as asked and overpriced. You would get much better for less locally and in manny other hotels I have visited. Live locally and will not be going back and will share similar experience with friends and family. Such a shame.,3,2019,07,22
223,Enjoyable stay!,"We had a recent enjoyable stay at the Castleknock Hotel. I was attracted by the family staycation package on offer and it was good for the family. We made use of the hotel pool and the childrens playground during our stay and they definitely got a 5* review from my 4 year old. The welcome pack for him was also a lovely touch and we thoroughly enjoyed our trip to the zoo.
Unfortunately we had a poor experience in terms of service when eating in the bar on our first night, it seems we may have been forgotten about as we were seated outside but credit to the manager on duty it was dealt with quickly and appropriately once brought to their attention. Thankfully the food was enjoyable.
Breakfast is good, plenty of choice and good produce.
One small criticism is the heat of the rooms and no air-conditioning. I know that the need for air con in Irish hotels isn't huge but on the days when we do get hot weather it's very unpleasant trying to sleep in a stuffy hotel room with no air circulating. The hotel did provide us with a fan which did provide some relief but it's pointless moving warm air around!! As a 4* hotel, it may be time for the Castleknock Hotel ( and indeed many more in Ireland) to invest in air conditioning. 
Overall, we had a pleasant stay in a good hotel and we would return.",4,2019,07,19
223,It‚Äôs Okay ,"Castleknock hotel in Dublin is an okay place.  It‚Äôs 20mins from the city centre.  You could park for free (12mins away from Castleknock) at the Pheonix park and then use the paid for HOHO to ferry you around. 
The rooms facing the parking are just BAD as there is continuous noise of the staff and delivery trucks cars going in / out of the hotel. So if you‚Äôre a light sleeper god help you. Windows would need to be kept open for air circulation as there‚Äôs no AC/fan. But cool breeze is flowing in and out.  
The staff was kind and helpful. 
Our bathroom shower holder needs a repair. Rm143. 

Overall this hotel needs an infrastructure make over.  
Thanks ",3,2019,07,18
223,Amazing bar man,I was at a christening in the castleknock hotel yesterday had to comeon and give a special mention to the barman killian who was working the bar in the room. He was absolutely brilliant with every1 . HIS interaction with the guests was amazing he was singing and dancing and great with every1 from the adults to the kids . Great day and he played a big part in making it such a good day well done killian,5,2019,07,15
223,Family celebration,We were a family group of 9 adults and 6 children celebrating a 40th birthday party on Sunday. 14 th July. The girl who greeted us was lovely. She remembered us as former hotel guests. She took the children‚Äôs orders immediately and the food came very promptly. The adults were able to order in a relaxed fashion. All the food was delicious. Service food and ambiance was great. Thank you.,5,2019,07,15
223,Beautiful hotel. ,"I have been going to this hotel 4/5 yrs now , have always enjoyed service is great, breakfast is plentiful and evening meals are lovely. Rooms are beautiful I usually get a room over looking the golf course as my hubby enjoys it. Going here tomorrow hope it's as good as the other times I have stayed.",5,2019,07,15
223,Nice hotel ,"This was a last minute choice due to change of plans. 
The hotel is lovely. It very large but has lots of different areas to eat and drink. 
The rooms are great and the staff are very good. 
There was also music which was good. 
Breakfast was good. ",5,2019,07,14
223,Afternoon tea,"Went here with my daughter for her birthday.It was,amazing.staff were lovely and so helpful.we wanted for nothing.our glasses of water were never empty.all our sandwiches and sweet treats were explained to us.we were also asked if we had any allergies or other dietary requirements which I thought was brilliant.food was heavenly & so fresh.id like to say a special thank you to Matthew who served us and waited on us hand & foot.he was amazing he also brought my daughter out a plate with happy birthday written on it in white chocolate with a candle and a beautiful chocolate and sang happy birthday.it made her day.I would highly recommend going here its fantastic.",5,2019,07,12
223,Wedding,Amazing wedding there. Staff very helpful. Just be wary of special rates for wedding guests. Still very expensive but it meant we got a substandard room. I have sent photos and a video to them by pm so will not go into more detail here. Overall we thought we were staying in a class hotel. However that was not the case. üòí,2,2019,07,08
223,Disappointing,"This hotel has been done up in recent years, it‚Äôs beautiful there was a wedding in the hotel lovely to sit and watch, but the food was woeful for the price 2 pasta papadelle with a million sundries tomatoes and about 2 pieces of spinach and 3 pieces of asparagus, the dishes were both different consistencies one cream sauce was nice and thick and hot and the 2nd was a watery cream sauce and cold....very disappointing.....",2,2019,07,08
223,A medium sized hotel with a boutique-like feel,"As a group of 20 odd people with back to back meetings every day, it's difficult to appreciate the spirit of any place or country we visit but somehow this hotel gets it right. The rooms - spacious and comfy. The showers and bath - enjoyably relaxing. The breakfast - quite decent. The service, ehem the people - they make this place special most of all. 

The hotel restaurant is okay but a bit pricey for what one gets. However I do recommend visiting the nearby club house (golf course), which is a separate establishment. It has a bar and restaurant but we were happy with having a few drinks on the veranda with pleasant view. Also, don't let the distance from the city disappoint. There are some very nice pubs nearby (Wright's Anglers Rest, Strawberry fields Hall and The Villager.. to name 3). 

Altogether a very pleasant stay and would consider a return visit.",5,2019,07,06
223,Much more than expected,"We booked this hotel for a short Dublin visit prior to a wedding at another venue in central Ireland.
We were initially attracted by the price and location which suited as we had a car for the onward journey. The location proved to be excellent, it is easy to find and easily accessible to the motorways. From the moment we entered the hotel we were impressed. A warm welcome at reception; and the staff throughout the stay are a credit. Guests really feel that they are valued. The facilities at the hotel are excellent, the food  is impressive; and the d√©cor and furnishings at the hotel are without doubt quality.
We would without doubt stay at this hotel for a future visit.",5,2019,07,04
223,Night away ,Stayed at this hotel on route to tayto park. Room was very comfortable with a beautiful bathroom very luxurious. Staff were very friendly however the front desk could do with more help at peek times. Initially there was a smell in our bathroom but that was sorted really quickly. I would stay here again. ,4,2019,07,03
223,Beautiful,Stayed here for weekend lately fabulous and great value for money rooms were beautiful spotlessly clean fabulous beds breakfast was plentiful and very tasty very close to airport and lots of other amenities would say here again in a heartbeat,5,2019,07,02
223,Fab as usual! *****,"We stayed at the Castleknock recently on a short break to fit in a visit to Tayto Park, The Aquazone at the National Aquatic Center and the Blanchardstown center, and as usual everything was perfect, staff all so nice and friendly, good bar food menu, good breakfast selection, great drinks selection and room spacious and comfortable.
Having plenty parking and the little play area and the lovely seating area outside is just great!",5,2019,06,27
223,Perfect getaway!,"I had the pleasure of spending a weekend here recently with some girlfriends. I was in search of a weekend that was relaxing (pool/jacuzzi check, spa check), luxurious (hella check), with a decent range of cocktails (found in adult-only cocktail bar), and ultimately affordable (check).

The hotel delivered on all counts and all expectations. Rooms are well-proportioned, very comfortable, quiet and provide everything you need (including a nespresso machine).  The staff are supremely warm, accommodating and knowledgeable. Special shout out to the fella who served us dinner ‚Äì he was really helpful, affable and sweet. The range and quality of food and drinks is superb: my biggest issue was making decisions on the choice!  For the main evening meal on Saturday I had the start of scallops in a dill sauce, a main of fillet steak and a dessert of chocolate fondant. Tbh, I could easily have this as my wedding meal as it was just bloody fantastic. 

Now, there was a lot going on in the hotel ‚Äì there was a wedding (and a second wedding party celebrating elsewhere), a baby shower, several birthday meals, as well as my hen and numerous other guests.  And yet, it never once felt busy, or that the staff were stretched. The huge lobby with a range of sofas/armchairs, lots of air and light, lent to a spacious atmosphere, and even during the busy check out there was no delay on coffees. 

I really cannot recommend this highly enough as a getaway weekend. Hope you enjoy it when you decide to go!",5,2019,06,27
223,Lovely hotel,"My partner and I stayed here recently. We were in Dublin for a funeral so booked fairly last minute. We didnt get to experience a lot of the hotel unfortunately as we were late back to the hotel and had to leave early again in the morning. However what we did see was very nice. We had a drink in the lobby which was relaxing and quiet. Our room, which was the superior, was spotless and comfortable and quite spacious. There was a nespresso machine in the room which my partner appreciated. 

On first glance, the bed looked very large however we soon realised that they were two single beds joined together. The joining was very uncomfortable to sleep on. Indoet9doe this reason and a few others, I didn't get a good nights sleep. I found the room too warm and stuffy during the night. There was also a constant noise from a vent which was also disappointing, especially since I had specified a quiet room. Lastly the pillows weren't comfortable.
If i was staying again I would make sure all of these were sorted. 

We had breakfast in our room for ‚Ç¨6 extra. The breakfast was amazing with such a huge array of items to suit everyone. 

Overall I liked the atmosphere of the place and, with a few alterations I would be happy to stay here again.",4,2019,06,24
223,A nice hotel,"We stayed a few days with family and it was nice.  Our room was not deluxe so our top tip is try and book deluxe because the non deluxe have no coffee machine (yes to kettle though), no fridge, no air con and is very hot.  However we had friends in a deluxe room and we spent our time in there with them.   The bed was so comfortable and there was plenty of pillows and towels.

The staff are a mix of exceptionally lovely and helpful, to a little bit rude and unhelpful.  They messed up our taxi times twice.  Which is the only reason I knocked a star off.  The first time was ok but the second time really almost ruined our evening and was very stressful as we ended up driving. The staff member said it wasn't their fault, but tbh it was because you booked one 5 seater car and not a 6 seater car that we needed for all of us and that we asked for.  The same story the night before but less of an issue as we were just heading to Dublin. It is tiny details, or if it is the taxi company find another taxi company to use.

The bar staff were wonderful!  The cocktails were fab.  The food was really really nice.  The breakfast was superb!  They have pancake making machines and we just spent our whole time making and eating pancakes.  Loved it.

Oh we had a massage and a facial and it was fantastic!  The girls doing them were lovely and so good at what they did.  I almost fell asleep which is unheard of (I can't switch off).  They were brilliant.

The gym and pool was absolutely lovely.   Clean, friendly and very pleasant staff.

So really it was a nice stay and I would stay again.  Its a very popular hotel with evening music and lots of buzzing.  Good place to stay.

A taxi to Dublin cost us in and around 23 euros for a four seater and 30 euros for a six seater.  Cocktails are about 10 euros and worth it as they were well prepared and tasted great.",4,2019,06,23
223,Shocking,"Absolutely not a place to stay to relax!!! Staff was rude very judg
 rude but the manger had no reply for the level of treatment we got...after being not only shocked but humiliated by the accusations. We arrived for a nice relaxing break and our expectations where definitely not met. Our room was situated so far at the back of the hotel that relaxing wasnt an option. I also asked when booking for a balocony room i was told they couldn't accommodate me as they have none..breakfast was cold at 8am in the morning the eggs where under cooked.i thought i could see past all that with a nice swim until i then realized the changing room was in highly unhygienic condition with wet towel over flowing a wash basket that was so full it nearly met the ceiling over all fact of the matter is if your looking for a place to enjoy this is not the place",1,2019,06,23
223,September 2012,"Me and my girlfriend spent a relaxing weekend in this hotel in 2012.
There is a massage/spa service, big indoor swimming pool, and nice surroundings.
Restaurant food was delicious except of the service. 
The waitress was a bit rude when my girlfriend asked about ingredients replacement in the meal but it's alright it was long time ago and many things probably have changed there.

Overall the hotel itself was very nice.",5,2019,06,21
223,Needs curry consistency,"Met with my girlfriends for lunch in the bar with lovely sunny view of the patio and golf course beyond. I come here all the time and on the whole the food is excellent. However, I like to get the vegetable curry and there is no consistency as to how it is prepared. I‚Äôve said this 3 times but my comments go unheard so I‚Äôm posting this review. The think consistency of the sauce in the photo is not appetizing, nor is overloading the curry with too much aubergine. Please chefs, perfect the curry and cook consistently.",3,2019,06,12
223,Great Quality 4 Star Hotel,"Have stayed in Castleknock hotel 4 times over the past 2 years and have never had a problem with it can always rely on a nice break away. 

1st stay was September 2017, booked a last minute offer on a suite and on check in we were told it was the Bridal Suite what a treat. Beautiful, spacious & very clean. Four poster bed, separate living area, huge dressing area. Bath & Shower. All amenities and good TV choices + Netflix access available. 

Stayed again, December 2017 in the Tyrell Suite, again big, spacious and well decorated. Bath & Shower. 

Visited Easter 2018 after the refurb and stayed in the new Higgins Suite, decor was modern and fresh and really impressive, the room itself was smaller than the older suites but overall very good in a four star hotel, jet bath and separate shower. 

The last visit was in a Deluxe Room, smaller than we were used to in the property but that was expected, decor was well looked after and room suited for the visit. 

Overall, we‚Äôve never been unimpressed with any of our rooms, only improvement I would make is bigger shower areas in rooms. And maybe an A/C unit. 

Bar staff very friendly, know when to leave you alone but also know when you need a top up. Drinks well priced in a hotel settling. Only ever had room service, pizza, wings etc food was always hot and tasty. 

Breakfast is always nice, fresh eggs and fresh food constantly coming out. Great cold food selections as well. 

Will happily return anytime. Have booked a function in the hotel in November and the entire family is looking forward to it based on what I‚Äôve told them and the pics I‚Äôve showed them from my trips. 

I‚Äôve read some negative reviews and I‚Äôm baffled as I‚Äôve very high standards and I‚Äôve always been happy with my rooms and the service in this hotel. 

",4,2019,06,11
223,"Lovely Hotel, excellent for conferences","I stayed here for two nights in November 2018 for a work conference. I rang to check room rate that I was being charged, simply to confirm and they upgraded me to a superior room! The room was excellent with a Nespresso machine ( I think that is only in superior rooms...) It was quiet, ie no noise from adjoining rooms which is generally a problem I find with a lot of hotels.The bed was very comfortable and both the bedroom and bathroom were spotless.The breakfast was superb. Food in general was excellent. Staff were all very pleasant and efficient and always took that little bit of time to simply say hello, which has become so rare. Despite being there for a conference, I could easily see this would also be a great family visit ( particularly if that family like golf!)
The pool and sauna/ jacuzzi was fantastic and the gym looked great! ( Didn't quite work up the energy to actually use it! ) I would highly recommend this hotel and a big thanks to all the staff who made my brief stay so pleasant! ",5,2019,06,11
223,Took Money from my credit Card.,"We had a family get together in this hotel as it was near where my son lives and wanted to celebrate my son's Big Birthday who came from abroad. I booked 3 rooms which I paid for with my Credit Card. We also had a family meal in the hotel. I was given the receipt on my check out which read the correct amount but when I checked my bank details the next day I saw another one thousand euro was taken from my account. I contacted the Hotel immediately to be told they would get back to me about it when they checked it. This went on for a week right over Easter weekend I had to do the calling regarding this most of the time. I explained I was going away over Easter and also booking tickets to Australia and this would leave my credit card overdrawn but still money not returned by Easter weekend. I lost out on cheaper seats to Australia and a lot of 'agro' over the Holiday weekend. I am disappointed that I will not feel comfortable using this hotel again as it would be a good meeting place for future occasions for our family since my son moved nearby. In general we had a good experience during our stay there but unfortunately the stale taste left in my mouth over this, it is hard to see the positive things offered to drive a distance to the hotel to present my card to put the money back in it but this offer was declined. I had to deal with different people every time I rang which made everything more difficult. Eventually our money was returned to us and was told it was a technical problem - not satisfactory - I wonder who elses money they had over Easter.",2,2019,06,04
223,Very good ,"Stayed here for a few days on business 

Staff are friendly and efficient,

Rooms are clean 

Food is varied and good .

Pretty much what you would expect for the price .

Would stay again and recommend

223,Great for family get together ,This is a lovely hotel for a family get together. We had a meal in the restaurant and the food was excellent. Nice bar area and lobby sitting area. Plenty of outdoor seating if you get the weather. Staff were friendly and helpful. ,4,2019,05,28
223,"Nice resort, not airport  convenient","We chose our last night stay in Ireland here at the Castleknock Hotel. Thinking it was out of the city center and close to the airport it would be a convenient stay for our last night on our 10 day Irish tour, but it was not. There is no easy access from the motorway and traffic in the morning getting to airport is tragic. Other than this the place is nice. Decent rooms, good food lots of amenities. Traffic from the health club members is a bit much both in parking and foot traffic inside. I suppose it‚Äôs convenient to something just not the airport but there is nothing the hotel can do about that.  It would be unfair to rate them based on that so I give it a solid very good!",4,2019,05,27
223,3 nighter,"very nice hotel, rooms big,, food good.breakfast very good plenty of choice. handy for dublin 20 euro s in taxi, or catch the bus number 37 ten minute walk from hotel. swimming pool ok,food and drink bit pricey, again 10 minute walk from hotel is a big pub the carlton good food and drink and cheaper",4,2019,05,26
223,One night stay,"Choose this hotel as it was near an event we were attending that day. Very impressive looking hotel while the inside is contemporary and stylish. The staff were friendly, welcoming and very helpful. Loads of choice at breakfast time and the food was excellent. The only complaint I would have is the noise from what I think was an air conditioning unit led to a very poor nights sleep. I would stay here again but the next time would request a quieter room!",4,2019,05,23
223,Excellent communion lunch with family ,Visited here last Saturday for a family communion. From start to finish everything was wonderful. We had buffet style food in one of the function rooms and the food was amazing. All staff were very attentive and friendly. Cant wait to go back and try out the rest of the hotel with my hubby. Thanks again for an enjoyable afternoon here ,5,2019,05,16
223,Excellent stay,"
Enjoyed 3 nights here while adjusting to jet lag and driving on the left side of the road. Easy access to enjoy ireland without being in the city. Quiet, great breakfast and parking. Highly recommend.",5,2019,05,14
223,Overnight family of 5 stay,Just returned from an overnight stay at Castleknock Hotel (after a trip to Tayto Park) - the family room was perfect for us - loads of room with double and three single beds and we loved the jacuzzi bath! and hot chocolate...very clean hotel - and food was excellent both evening meal and breakfast- nice menu - looking forward to returning again soon,5,2019,05,13
223,Lovely Stay,"Stayed here with my wife, and have to say the hotel is lovely - i was going to give the hotel a very good mark but decided on the Excellent as there was only a couple of miner things that could been improved, but thinking about it they did not really take away the great time we had - 

Rooms - we booked a superior room and it was fantastic - the beds are massive in these rooms and i found them comfy, the room is a good size and very clean. i was very impress with the Smart tv's they have in the rooms, you are able to log in to your own Netflix account which is very hand plus you have all the standard tv channels to watch, (remember you must log out of your NETFLIX account when you leave) the bathrooms are lovely as well underfloor heating in the area - 
the only small thing about the rooms is maybe they could have instructions on how to use the Air-con as i struggled with this setting it - but reception did sort it for me - 

The Hotel is lovely and modern good size area to relax near reception, we dod not get time to use the pool so can't comment on that but did look nice. 

will be back",5,2019,05,07
223,Our Wedding Day,"We recently had our wedding at this hotel. I cannot recommend this venue highly enough. The staff were superb, in particular Audrey for her attention to detail and assistance to us as we planned for the day and Kevin and Rachel who made everyone feel so special during the reception. The food and the service we received on the day was exceptional and we could not have wished for more. The feedback we have received from our guests about this hotel has been incredible. Well done to all who were involved and thank you for making our day so special. 

Claire & Ronan",5,2019,05,05
223,Very Nice Place to Stay,Stayed at Castleknock while in Dublin for a wedding While a little outside the city centre its not best location for touring about the city but if not wanting needing to be close to city centre it is excellent place to stay Rooms are large very well appointed and the staff are excellent (very helpful friendly and attend to any needs) The breakfasts are superb as are the meals and bar There is also a great golf course attached to the property the cost to play (30-40 Euros) which when played off peak times is more than reasonable,5,2019,05,03
223,Great hotel. ,"We stayed here for 2 nights over the Easter break. This is a great hotel with a lot going for it. Lovely pool area although a little tlc wouldn‚Äôt go amiss in places. Food in the restaurant was very good as was the breakfast. Staff were very pleasant and reception staff were very knowledgeable. We did notice a few things needing attention with regard to house keeping, there was a vent in the jacuzzi which had no cover on it leaving it with quite dangerous prongs sticking out. Also our shower  pole was broken as was the window on our corridor. We saw a tray with food left overs outside a bedroom door when we arrived about 3.30, the same tray was still there when we were going to bed about 11.30 that night. Come on housekeeping, pull your socks up and keep this wee gem of a hotel up to scratch. We hope to return later this year to give you another chance. ",4,2019,04,27
223,Party,"I went to my nieces 21st birthday party for my friend in the 27th of April in the castleknock hotel . The service was great in the tower suite.  Killian was a great bar tender, he is an asset to the hotel",5,2019,04,26
223,Mothers day treat ,"Hotel was wicked busy but not a problem for all staff, check-in had a  long que but reception staff were very efficient and friendly, we had foor in Earth and Vine restaurant on site food was delicious and service was good, rooms were very large and modern and very quite.
Will definitely return for a longer stay ",4,2019,04,25
223,Very welcoming staff,"My sister and I had to travel to Dublin for an old friends funeral, during this what would be sad time, we met a member of the barstaff, Killian he welcomed us to the hotel and made us feel at home as he worked all the while chatting to us and giving us the laugh we needed. Other than that, hotel services were excellent and hope to return soon",5,2019,04,25
223,Fantastic staff,"We got the hotel at a great rate as part of a Stena deal with our ferry, will be back due to price, location and the fantastic staff.
Breakfast was well presented selection was average, lots of children around so I would be careful of selecting things that little hands may have touched.  Evening meals in the bar were poor and looked like they had just come out of the savers range at tescos, the waiter did agree the soup wasn‚Äôt fit for purpose and took it away.  Room was great but bed was not comfortable, doors in corridor banged.  I think this could be an excellent hotel but it seams somebody at the top isn‚Äôt investing in beds and food.
Great staff

223,Easter weekend,"Great hotel. Room clean,comfortable very nice a moderne design,very quiet . Restaurant good food,best staff. We was in hotel in busy Easter time,but no problem,we get food until 10min ,very tasty food. Staff no have problem resolve any asking.
Only unhappy with Spa,nobody check pool,kids playing in all areas include jacuzzy,so no relax time. We must buy hat but many people no have hat,so is only money business.NEED better service in this area.",4,2019,04,22
223,Bday ,"Stayed here for me bday because it looked a fancy hotel with a lovely golf course paid over price for 2 nights asked for a room with a golf course view, far from I was left looking at other people's windows from my room I rang and asked to pay for more of an upgrade and better view after already asking and was told it was not possible, the room is as basic as hotel rooms come way overpriced I wouldn't stay here again ruined my birthday to be honest should have went elsewhere ",1,2019,04,19
223,Absolutely Stunning,"We stayed in a suite and it was fantastic. Couldn't fault the room. 
Heated floors was a real bonus.
Would stay here again and again.
Only negative about this place would be how busy the restaurant was. However they placed us in a que and rang our room so overall happy experience.

223,Convenient location just outside of Dublin,"Spent two night gets at this hotel when first arrived in Ireland. Hotel and grounds are well maintained. The lobby bar was excellent as well as the cafe. The is a large shopping mall not far from the hotel, just ask the front desk to arrange for a taxi. The front desk staff were also very friendly and helpful. I needed to finish up some work before our Ireland vacation could really get underway and when I realized that I forgot my laptops nous they found a spare in a matter of minutes. Thanks again for the hospitality. ",5,2019,04,14
223,Gorgeous hotel but needs improvement,"Stayed here for one night, gorgeous hotel! But we went to book a table in the restaurant Vine to Fork and were to told there was only a 6.30pm reservation free as they were totally booked out which was fine. We had our meal which was so good. we didn‚Äôt leave the restaurant until 8.45pm and there was easily 10 sets of 2s that were available! We were annoyed and confused as we would have loving a later time! 
Hotel was also way too hot inside it felt like a sauna and we were told there was no air conditioning . 
Overall nice hotel but I wouldn‚Äôt return...",3,2019,04,08
223,Not my favorite,"I recently stayed at this hotel while in Dublin for business. Check-in was fine, but my room was one door away from the restricted-access door on the second floor so I heard everyone coming and going. It being Friday night there was a band in the lobby-right underneath my room! And to top it off, I could not take a shower the next morning because the hot water did not work. Srvice was fine, though.",3,2019,04,08
223,A real mix of Pros & Cons,"This hotel is a real mix of the good and the bad. We checked into the hotel, fast and efficient, no complaints. The room was good, comfortable bed, good number of towels, toiletories, clean. The TV has huge number of stations. This is all positive and good. Good gym&pool. We went for food in their 22bar/restaurant. I ordered a club sandwich with chips ‚Ç¨16 but I thought it will likely be good portion and tasty. Afraid not. It had very limited chips and the club sandwich was very bland, not well presented. Poor. My wifes vegetarian curry was cold. She sent it back and the waitress apologized. Took an age to come back but fair play it was taken off the bill. Overall the food is not great. The really need to look at improving the quality and quantity. Down the country they would ensure it was excellent as people find that very important when on a break but Castleknock need to look at spending time and energy on improving this significantly. The bar area is nice and has good range of beers, gins etc. At 4am the fire alarm went off; it was false alarm. This hotel could be a really top rate hotel if they improve the food.",3,2019,04,07
223,Sneaky and expensive. ,"We recently booked an evening meal in the Castleknock Hotel (Vine to Fork) restaurant to celebrate an event. The receptionist was at pains to have us there at 7.15 PM as they were very busy...I received 2 subsequent phone calls to confirm booking. We arrived to what you could describe as a barn of a room...with 3 other couples in a room that could easily accommodate a 100 people...I am still at a loss as to why they were so anxious to have us on time.
We ordered our meal...the waiter  asked us if we would like some side dishes...they were listed on the menu with no prices at all...when the bill arrived we were surprised to be charged top dollar for fries and roast carrots...over ‚Ç¨12 each..very sneaky.....for the scallop starter 3 scallops for ‚Ç¨11.95..rip off..
Just be very careful when visiting...
2 starters
2 mains
3 glasses house wine
1 dessert
No tea/coffee
Total ‚Ç¨124.00
A total ripoff. Avoid at all costs",1,2019,04,06
223,Nice Bar but Poor Quality and Poor Service,"We met some friends yesterday for some food and a drink in the bar. The setting and and bar are quite nice and comfortable.  a bright space.  Great potential.   The service was slow and unfriendly.  The waiter was only interested in asking us for more drinks.  We ordered food and 45 minutes later we had nothing.  When we asked how long more it would be we got an indifferent answer along the lines of I dot know or care.  When it did eventually come it was small, cold and tasted like crap.  I won't be going back",2,2019,04,06
223,Definitely not a 5*,"I always wanted to try this place and I did ,tonight. Place is huge looks so nice from the outside and inside but unfortunately the food and service were bad . I went there tonight with my husband and 3 children   ,I ordered crispy chicken tender for my 4 years old son but what we got was wet chicken pieces, i think they were already cooked and heated in the microwave ,for starters we ordered spicy chicken wings that were not hot (little bit warm) and it would've been better if they were served in bowl instead of a plate , and crab cake that tasted more like a potatoe cake ,while I was eating chicken wings the waiter who was looking after us came to the table to take the plates then he stepped back then came and took my husband's plate and left mine (ofcourse because I was still eating ) ,after I was done with the starter they brought main courses before even clearing the table and left without bringing cutlery , so waited and waved and waited till he realised that there was no cutlery, burger was good ,fish was ok ,but frozen chips? C'mon it's not a pub it's what it says a 5* hotel, the waiter who was looking after us seemed like he has problems with another staff and all waiters looked like they were forced to work . I will never be back and it's not worth paying 100 euro .",2,2019,03,27
223,Hotel review,"I have stayed at Castleknock holtel a few times on my visit to Ireland and it was always a pleasure.
Sadly on my reasons visit I did not get to stay there. They were booked up.
I did however dine there and also used their fabulous lobby as a meeting place for coffee mornings.
I highly recommend on your visit to Ireland that you stay there.",5,2019,03,25
223,Was lovely apart from breakfast staff ,"We found the hotel clean and beautiful .
We stayed here the night after our wedding they added some lovely touches like rose petals and a dessert which was amazing .
The only reason I‚Äôve not gave 5 stars is because of the breakfast staff . We found them very abrupt snotty and intimidating. And we were not late . They just didn‚Äôt seem happy . It was St Patrick‚Äôs weekend so maybe it was just because they were busy but awful customer service at breakfast. ",4,2019,03,24
223,Very good hotel,Recommend it very nice hotel very nice staff I stayed there for eight months and was treated very well All the staff go out of their way to make your stay pleasant very friendly management and waiter and waitress service even the cleaners and chambermaids go out of their way to look after you,5,2019,03,20
223,Excellent Value Hotel - looks fab now its extended,"A highly rated hotel , only 12 to 15 minutes from Dublin. Recently extended, it has very good quality bedrooms, good furniture and well cleaned rooms. really good value for money when you book in advance. Breakfast is very good value. Hotel ambience is perfect for a quiet few days break and also very good for business travellers.",5,2019,03,19
223,Paddy's day visit ,Arrived and straight away we were happy with the hotel. Clean and modern. The room was a good size. We paid more for this room given the date but generally for the price of the other hotels in the area we were happy. Spa facilities were great. The hotel allowed us to use the facilities after we had checked out. We got breakfast room service in the morning. My partner was not too keen but I thought it was tasty. Would love To go back and have more time there. Staff were super friendly! ,4,2019,03,19
223,Fab room!,"Booked an overnight for valentines with my boyfriend! Got a comp upgrade and the room was amazing definitly made the trip better! Food in hotel is not as good as it should be considering the hotel is amazing, staff were all lovely though and would definitely return.",4,2019,03,19
223,Disappointing,"Hotel seamed lovely on arrival, found multiple illegal NOS canisters and other rubbish in room. Couldn't order food from bar after hours without an extra 6 euro charge per sandwhich even though no room service was required! Overall the customer service was shocking for a supposedly 4* hotel, have stayed in better travellodges!",3,2019,03,17
223,Birthday Treat!,"Upon arrival on Saturday 2nd March, it was notable how busy the entire hotel was - families galore, with very small babies as well & lots of couples everywhere. A good sign I suppose: or was there an 'offer' somewhere that we were not aware of? 

Definitely wasn't a 'cheap' night away. 
Not a huge hotel, weather wasn't good enough to walk around outside either. So coffee & cake in the lobby was our starting point. A nice atmosphere throughout. 
Room was lovely, very large bed, comfortable surroundings - seperate walk in shower a bonus. Noticed that hotel was kept well - clean etc. but wear & tear also noticeable. 

The bar/restaurant was very busy, we thought we'd have an early bite to eat at 6.30pm and were told we'd have a 30 min wait. Was considerably shorter than that thankfully, but again, just proved how busy the whole hotel was. There were numerous parties throughout. Food was delicious. 
But I do agree with previous reviews - not cheap! Dublin prices at it's best! However, we couldn't complain as the food really was good. 

Visited the pool area - was again kept very well, small dressing area - especially when catering with the large crowd. Full with families, so unfortunately i didn't stay too long. But it's good to know what we could happily return with our own children. 

Breakfast was again of a high standard. Great selection. Plenty of space with the use of the bar/restaurant and the main restaurant. 

All in all no major complaints - a small gripe that the heating in the room didn't seem to be controllable and was quite high. Didn't bother me too much as you could just open the window though. We are still wondering was there something on we weren't aware of to have so many people visit on March 2nd?! Only wish if there was a special deal we would've known about it!",4,2019,03,11
223,overpriced,"absolutely cannot fault this hotel but it is way over priced, not a great kids menu either.  The sink in the bathroom had a big crack and the water leaked onto floor when it was filled.  Breakfast is fab",5,2019,03,08
223,UNDERWHELMED OVERPRICED,"We stayed as a family.   The hotel is solid, clean but overpriced and was full to capacity throughout our time.   The staff were lovely, but the atmosphere was more of a coach party inn than a spa hotel.   The spa is too small for the number of guests the hotel has, with a very crowded gym and restrictive rules for children.   At the weekend it was full of classes for gym and spa members, at the expense of space in the pool for hotel guests.   The spa is not for older children nor teenagers, but fine for very young children",3,2019,03,08
223,Wonderful food - excellent staff!,"Called to the hotel for lunch today and was served by Alex T. who went well above and far beyond the call of duty. The food was top notch and he and his colleagues were just great. It's a fabulous hotel and it never fails to impress - 10/10! 

Darragh Muldoon",5,2019,03,05
223,Lovely hotel,Everything in this hotel is so modern and stylish from reception up to the rooms. It is a great choice for a quiet break away the only downside I would say is that you have to upgrade your room to get Netflix on the tv but its not too much of a problem. Either way this hotel is fabulous. ,4,2019,03,02
223,Fan outside room is loud,"I have a minimum expectation of a hotel room, that I can sleep in it. There is a fan outside room 160, directly outside the window that is the outlet from the swimming pool. It would be physically impossible to sleep in the room. No other rooms available and the feedback from reception is pointless. Avoid!",1,2019,02,27
223,Pretty decent for the price but in need of some refurbishment. ,"Stayed here on a business trip as it‚Äôs reasonably well positioned just outside the city. Fairly reasonably priced the hotel portions itself as a golf and country club with gym and pool facilities.

Overall the stay was good for the pricing. The hotel breakfast is ok at best with some improvement needed on the supply chain with regards to the sausages which are cheap and if poor consistency. The orange juice is also very watered down and pretty naff which is a shame.

The restaurant is well healed for a nice evening meal, however it gets very noisy in there so maybe not a great choice for an intimate meal but fine for business.

The swimming pool is small and no good for fitness swimming but perfect for relaxing and family time. The gym is compact but has a decent cage for free weights with a good selection of dumbbells so a define bonus there.

Rooms need a refurb but in all clean and tidy. Meeting rooms need some detailing as they are becoming a bit tired. Business lunches for meetings are also a bit poor. A menu of options for businesses would be useful in this regard.

Generally as mentioned, a decent experience for middle market pricing.",3,2019,02,25
223,Let down by hospitality and warm rooms,"We stayed here for 4 nights as a family of 4 including 2 children. They have connecting rooms and family rooms which are reasonably priced and of a good standard.

The room was clean and has all the usual amenities but unfortunately one of our rooms smelled strongly of cigarette smoke. The rooms are also very hot despite us staying in winter and with the windows ajar. The rooms are not equipped with A/C.

We were attracted by the pool which had a children‚Äôs area but as it also doubles up as s club, the pool is often very busy with restricted times for kids.

All in all okay- avoid in summer and don‚Äôt always expect to be able to use the pool especially during busy school holidays. 

Restaurant food is mediocre and kids options not the healthiest.

One of the major letdowns is the customer service. One of the pool attendants was quite rude and abrupt, although perhaps not intentionally. We requested breakfast boxes on our last day for 6.30 am and they forgot to communicate this and then 15 minutes later only came back with water, apple and a yoghurt with a spoon. Breakfast staff were friendly though.",3,2019,02,23
223,Family rooms... and a few other bits.,"Couple of things and we're only here 2 hours..

1. ""Family"" rooms
I'm bitterly disappointed that the family rooms are nothing more than a standard room with additional beds crammed in.

Reported it to reception and ultimately, it's tough luck. ""Those are our family rooms"".

2. Had a bite to eat in the restaurant.
We both felt pressured when asked if we wanted desert. It was almost uncomfortable. But its ok, they changed the almost soon after.

3. When settling the bill in restaurant
The waiter stood over us, despite my telling him I was paying cash instead of card. He simply didn't leave the bill with us, just stood there waiting for me to hand over the cash. We both felt unbelievably uncomfortable.

Honest opinion, we will absolutely never come back here. And its just so disappointing considering it's the very start of our trip.

================

I deleted the above review, as I wanted to edit and add a couple of updates.

1. The beds are very poor (springs in your back, and another guest volunteered that info to me also when I said ""the beds could be a bit more comfortable"")
2. No air-conditioning, the rooms are sweltering, and if you open the windows, the noise is too much to sleep.
3. The lady at reception this morning, was absolutely lovely.

It's funny, and this is probably a generalisation I shouldn't make, but any of the ""younger""(sub 40) staff I've dealt with, were really poor. And the only person >40 I've dealt with, was just lovely. I believe she may have been the duty manager on today, and I really can't thank her enough.

Firstly she tried to move us into a superior family room, but they were all booked up. She was very pleasant and accommodating. So while this review is still very poor for the hotel, let the General Manager know that reads this, to find out which lady was on duty Fri 22nd Feb and look after her.

She has gone out of her way to accommodate us and I wish to thank her publicly. I'm only sorry I didn't get her name.",1,2019,02,22
223,Great stay,"I stayed at the hotel from June18 - January 19. The rooms were always clean and comfortable, reception staff were helpful friendly and professional. The public areas of the hotel were cosy and comfortable. All the staff through to management couldn‚Äôt be better, nothing was too much trouble.",5,2019,02,20
223,Great hotel,"We loved our stay at Castleknock Hotel. The rooms were clean and spacious. The breakfast was fantastic and the staff was very friendly. We were only there for a brief time, so we did not get to enjoy the pool or gym, but the areas did look incredible.",5,2019,02,19
223,Waste of Money,"Paid 150 for a couple retreat massage.  All treatments on the website were advertised as being one hour long, when I asked the receptionist the said the treatment was 50mins long.  I thought this was fair as it was slightly cheaper than other treatments (by 25 euro!!) Little did I know the treatment only last 25 minutes! I was so disappointed and when I questioned the receptionist she said 50 minutes divided by two, even though we were getting the treatments done together.  Waste of time the fruit looked like it had been sitting there for weeks and the drinks had gone sour from the heat of the room without having ice.",1,2019,02,16
223,Nice Hotel / Poor Restaurant Service,The biggest disappointment is the level of service in the restaurant. Its not a once off because I have stayed in the this hotel several times in the last year and the issue repeats itself. You often have to get up from your seat to get a waiter/waitress attention. The last night my colleague and I where in the restaurant there was customers complaining on both sides of our table due to the poor service or long wait for food. Have finally decided to stay else where.,3,2019,02,14
223,"Nice hotel, good food","Decent stay, rooms very good, restaurant food, good value & high standard. My only complaint.. I struggled to connect any device, laptop, mobile, I-pad to the Wifi. The hotel appeared to have no internet the evening of my visit. Not a deal breaker but frustrating when you are on business. 

Second visit, would stay again in the future.",4,2019,02,14
223,Birthday treat,"Myself and my wife stayed there as a birthday treat.
We checked in without issue and although we were there early our room was ready for us.
Check in staff were very pleasant and welcoming.
We dropped our bags to the room and went down to the 22 bar for lunch.
Very nice meal, staff were attentive without being in our face the whole time.
After lunch we went up to the room and unpacked.
A very nice size room, all the amenities you need. The gowns were fantastic and a nice touch.
Bathroom was spotless
Spent an hour or so in the pool, again the staff were helpful, towels provided.
Water was nice and warm, Jacuzzi and sauna were visited.
We had dinner in the Earth and Vine restaurant as part of the package.
We had soup and scallops to start with.
For mains we had cod fillet with clams and mussels and beef with creamed spuds (nicest I've had)
Lemon tart and chocolate fondant for dessert.
Staff were very good again but we did seem to have a different person each course and even when ordering drinks.
The hotel was busy all day, between a 50th birthday and a dinner for the Gaelic masters association but we never felt any lessening in service.
The rooms must be extremely well soundproofed because we didn't here a thing from the rooms either side or in the halls.
A very pleasant stay.",4,2019,02,13
223,Our stay,"Was really looking forward to stay,reviews looked good especially pool,check-in was straight forward,went to swimming pool with newborn baby for first swim,only informed temperature was 6degrees below normal when we entered the water,it was freezing,reception or swimmimg pool staff never informed us.food that evening was ok but heat in dinning room was cold with a/c turned too low when it's so cold outside,dinning hall just feels like your eating in the lobby,with no atmosphere,it felt you were eating in a Gaa hall.hotel is being used for emergency accoomdation also.breakfast was lovely,especially staff who were wonderful that morning.overall hotel is just a 3star at max.",3,2019,01,30
223,Would have rated it higher if the staff actually cared about customers,"Stayed for one night in a deluxe king which was supposed to be newly renovated. The room was fine, a good size, but when we arrived the room was very very cold! we turned on the heating and then went down for dinner. 
There was no one on restaurant reception and we had to wait for quite a while for anyone to acknowledge us although plenty of staff walked passed, smiled and carried on working! Although we had booked a table, when someone did finally arrive they asked us to wait in the bar as our table wasn't ready. But the group of 8 people behind us were seated straight away and they didn't have a booking! 
When we were finally shown into the restaurant it was only a third full so we don't understand why were weren't seated immediately. The food was good (not really fine dining but reasonable value for what it was). 
When we returned to the room it was still freezing cold. The duty manager came up, fiddled about with the heating, and then said he'd send up a heater as he couldn't get it to work properly. A few minutes later someone arrived with a heater, who also looked at the heating controls and said the duty manager had failed to turn it on! So she turned it on but within a few minutes it had turned itself off again and reset itself to 20 degrees. We tried turning the heating on several times but it kept turning itself off so we finally ended up sleeping in a freezing cold room with just a small heater that didn't help at all. 
Breakfast was very much a bun fight. If you like quantity rather than quality this is the place for you to eat but the quality of the food at breakfast was dreadful. 
On checking out we mentioned to the receptionist the fact there was no heating in the room. We also told her we weren't impressed with breakfast. She didn't seem particularly interested but told us that we could have a room upgrade on our next visit if we wanted. Why would we want to use this hotel again considering the lack of customer care shown on our first visit here? First visits are important and they failed miserably this time.",2,2019,01,29
223,Not bad for a very large property,"This place is on a grand scale when we visited there were at least 4 functions including a wedding in progress yet the room was spacious and clean and at the end of the corridor ‚Ç¨170 incl breakfast isn‚Äôt bad by Dublin standards
Room 7/10
Bar 7/10 
Evening meal at bar 6.5/10
Breakfast 6/10 
Nighttime ambience bar and foyer 7/10
For such a big place  it is light years ahead of city west and worth a second üëÄ ",3,2019,01,27
223,A nights break away from the kids ,"Had a wonderful fun night away from the children. We used the leisure pool. Had cocktails in the bar. Beautiful fun dinner in the restaurant. Our room was spectacular. From the moment we checked in to when we checked out the whole experience was superb. Plenty of staff available to every guest. 
We had lots of laughs. 
Pavlova had an interesting twist. 

Can‚Äôt wait to go back and make this an annual event. ",5,2019,01,26
223,Hanging out with family !,"I was visiting in from Canada for a holiday and my family organized a night at The Castleknock Hotel so we could all get together while I was home.

I have to admit I was very disappointed with the menu selection (or lack there off) and overall quality of the food - it lacked taste and came out freezing ! Same with breakfast the following morning.

The service was also very bad overall - had to keep looking for a waitress or waiter to order drinks. They just didn‚Äôt seem interested in wanting to serve us.

The room was fine but not sure if I would go back here. 

",1,2019,01,19
223,"Great location, family friendly","Great location, nice clean hotel with good food.  The kids really enjoyed their stay with so much for them to do.  Thanks to Mary for all the recommendations during our stay, really appreciated it.  Lovely swimming pool also and great kids club",5,2019,01,17
223,Family Holidays,"free parking , free buffet breakfast , family friendly , short walk to local pub and shops , 3 golf courses within mins. 
staff are young and  friendly . Drinks were not over priced food was 7 out of 10 , pizza was new on the menu and very tasty , Hotel has been just renovated and looks great . Hotel was very clean in general . Pool was warm and not to busy . ",5,2019,01,15
223,Relaxing Stay,"When we arrived we were greeted by a friendly receptionist who checked us in very quickly into room 150. The first thing we noticed when we walked into the room was that it was very spacious, but that was quickly overshadowed by a dirty pair of socks in the wardrobe area. We let this go over our head for the time being, but then we noticed there was only one robe and slippers and there were meant to be two. We sat down for a while and noticed that the room was freezing even though the radiator was on so we decided to say this to reception. They were very apologetic about all three things and didn‚Äôt hesitate in moving us to the room next door (148) which was lovely. 

While staying in Castleknock hotel we both availed of a spa treatment (a massage and a facial), both of which we were very impressed with. Before our spa treatments we used the pool, jacuzzi, sauna and steam room before relaxing in the relaxation suite for a while. We were very impressed with all elements of the spa/pool area!

We had dinner in Earth & Vine restaurant included in our stay. Since this was included the we had a reduced menu (4 starters, mains and desserts). This menu was fine and had a decent selection. We were relatively happy with our meal, although the service was not great.

The breakfast the next morning was fantastic, there was a huge variety of choice from cooked foods to continental options. We were very impressed.

This was a relaxing night away for us, so we didn‚Äôt actually leave the hotel but there is plenty to do around the hotel including Dublin Zoo, Blanchardstown Shopping Centre and The Phoenix Park if you so wish to get out and about.

Overall we enjoyed our stay and we would recommend to others.",3,2019,01,14
223,FUNCTION RUINED BY SECURITY STAFF,"We booked a function for a family event in early January and had 80 people attend many of whom where residents in the hotel. For some reason at the end of the evening the hotel used a sub contract security guard to remove our group from the room and was aggressive and shouted  at our guests when challenged. The level of aggression was such that the security guard disconnected the plugs of the entertainment paid for by us in organising the room. The evening duty manager supported the actions of the security guard and did not allow us to remain in the room and finish drinks. He confirmed that the security guard was not an employee of the hotel and the duty manager did not know the security guards name and was sympathetic to our complaints but did not treat them seriously. The security guard continued to act aggressively outside the room when asked for his name. It is clear the guard must have been acting on the authority of the hotel but was dealing with us like a nightclub bouncer instead of hotel residents remaining in a room 10 minutes after a bar had closed. Our group had not caused any problems for the hotel and were winding up our very nice evening when this occurred so it can only be that it is the hotel policy to use security guards who are not trained to deal with hotel residents in a 4 star hotel in this fashion.

I would not recommend booking a function in this hotel or wedding as the hotel policy appears to be to allow security staff to aggressively end functions and shout at guests like a bouncer and I believe it would ruin a special occasion and may lead to violence as people do not expect this kind of engagement from a so called 4 star hotel",1,2019,01,06
223,NEVER BOOK A FUNCTION ROOM HERE....,"My family booked a function room here to host my fathers 80th birthday. A lot of prep work went into the event and it was to be a great surprise with surprise family friends visiting from overseas. Firstly was had a part time bar man who closed the bar at 12.20 when the actual legal time is 12.30. At 12.30 a guy came into the room wearing a dark suit and a had a radio. He turned on all the lights and closed the bar. Two grand children wanted to sing two final songs for their grandad having traveled from overseas. My sister told the guy in the suit that just two more singers. The guy left, one song down and about to begin the second and final song when he appeared again showing and in a very aggressive manner. He went straight to the music equipment and pulled out the plugs. This is disgraceful conduct and even after we complained to the manager on duty the manager was useless...we were very upset about the whole event and when we went to get the name from the manager he refused to give it...He stated that he is from a private security firm. If that was the case why was he closing the bar and work as a hotel employee ???.
The conduct of this so called security man was a disgrace and he hid his security id card also. I will after this event never return to this hotel...How it ever obtained the four stars is a joke....I am still waiting for the name of the security firm....my guests from overseas where shocked at the event and i am sure this will leave a great impression. Everybody agreed never to return to this so called four star hotel again, so 80 plus customers gone...
NEVER BOOK A FUNCTION HERE.....",1,2019,01,05
223,Great value hotel with a nice ambiance,"Stayed in newly completed 5 person room, 3 single beds and one double. Had seperate bath and shower but bath was a jacuzzi type so we didn't use it as jacuzzi baths are notoriously unhygieneic and there's no way of telling wether they have had their internal pipes cleaned since their previous use. A regular bath would have been preferable. Our window opened out on to a flat roof with the sound of some fans running but it was barely audible at night but still not ideal. Restaurant made a mess of our order, steaks took almost 50 minutes to arrive as a result of some error in the system but staff were very apologetic about this. Foyer area has excellent seating and areas for you to meet visitors. We've been here a few times over the years and will be back again.",4,2019,01,03
223,Couples and family's Hotel,"Staff were brilliant .. bedroom and the rest of the hotel was big .... great for family's!! had a meal in restaurant it was 'New Years Eve' set menu was excellent, swimming pool sauna and spa fab... great stay.
great shopping in the town was a bonus",4,2019,01,02
223,Excellent in almost every way!,"EXCELLENT.   
Four years ago, this hotel was on a turn - for the worse.  Getting a little bit tired and sticky.   A recent visit saw refurbishments that have lifted it right back up on to the top of the 4 star leaderboard.   Gorgeous reception, lounge area and bar.

Spotlessly clean and spacious rooms.  Bath and separate shower in each bathroom.  Everything you need in each room for a comfortable stay.   
Bar food on night one was exceptional.   One of the best burgers I've eaten in a long time.  Beautiful presentation and taste.  A REAL homemade burger loaded with all the right stuff and served with a side of skinny fries.  Perfect.

Restaurant staff are very good and efficient. 
Self service Breakfast in the bright dining room was good except for the juice choice.   All three of the juices were very bad quality.   The only other issue with this hotel for visitors without their own car is location.   It's out in the suburbs.   However with our own car we were into the city centre in 25 minutes.  There must be public transport options.   Staff will give you those details.  
There was a wedding on the Saturday night of our stay, but we did not hear any sound from it when we went to bed.   Exceptionally quiet sleep and those amazing pillows did help.

Nice indoor leisure centre with pool and exceptional gym.   The only thing they need to upgrade now is the outdoor childrens playground which is very muddy and basic.  It badly needs looking at as this hotel is very popular with families.

Overall - top notch.",5,2019,01,01
223,Another great stay,We have stayed twice and really enjoyed both stays. All staff super friendly and accommodating. Room was lovely and quiet. Bar and restaurant are both fab with great service. Looking forward to next time,5,2019,01,01
223,Amazing time (could up their Xmas decorations game),"Stayed here over the Xmas week and I have to say it was a really enjoyable time. The hotel was very busy which is great to see so there was a great buzz about the place.
The staff were over obliging and extremely  helpful in anything we requested. The food in the restaurant was very good and it was nice to hear some live music.
Only criticism id have is the Xmas decorations, still deserve 5 stars as this is easily something that can be improved and it is a seasonal setting. Some of the decorations were nice but there was no real wow factor in the Xmas trees. Earth and vine restaurant wasn't really decorated at all as you walked in. Easily something that could be invested in and get a name for themselves having the wow factor as the atmosphere is certainly there. 
Saying that we Loved our stay and we will be back ",5,2018,12,31
223,Christmas gift ,"Amazing and peaceful location. I requested for a room with a view over the golf club, and I have got even much better than what I expected, even in such a busy period.We had dinner and breakfast through room service: food was really good (especially deserts!!)  and staff was so nice. We had lunch in the 22 restaurant downstairs, which was amazing as well. 
The bedroom was very quiet, very clean. At that moment, there was a wedding (with loads of children) and still, we haven't been disturbed by the noise or anything. Same for the swimming pool area: we went to the jacuzzi and steam room at ""the children hour"" (before 6pm) and we still could relax as everyone was quote respectful towards one another.
Finally, the spa showed us a warm welcome. We had hot stone and Swedish massages from Jennifer and Hazel who are really good at their job!  Very professional, even my mum who usually doesn't like massages, really loved her hot stones one! We were a lot relaxed after it.
That has been said, few points that I would improve if I was working there: the bedroom was a bit cold in the evening as the heater was a bit slow. About the spa, the relaxation area (where how wait for your treatment) is not really made to relax (very small, people talking loud there, doors slamming around). It would be amazing if the staff could have a control over that (as its obviously the other guests who were not really respectful towards our need to relax)",5,2018,12,29
223,Lunch at Castleknock Hotel,"The Castleknock Hotel is a place I was not fond of when it opened first. It has grown on me and it‚Äôs a comfortable place for a meal on a drink. 
We had lunch here today, it is in the medium price range but the staff and food quality make it value for money. It offers free parking too.
It‚Äôs also convenient to where I live . Worth a visit for food in D15.

223,Absolutely perfect stay,"Service was above average, having spent time in 5 star hotels, the service was of that standard. All staff were polite, helpful and knowledgeable. Will absolutely return. Recommended to all, couples, family or solo stay.",5,2018,12,18
223,"Noisy, staff don't want to be here","Attended a Christmas party last year here & was lovely. Same can not be said this year. No choice for starter, cod I ordered for main was dry overcooked and inedible, waitress removed plate but never asked was there a problem with it. Dessert was very nice. Shame that there was no greeting, smile or friendliness from any member of staff. 
Our room is at front of the hotel 1st floor and all we can hear is people shouting, calling each other, cars beeping their goodbyes until 4am. On top of the fact the hotel has a full strip of high beam lights outside the window which the curtains do not block. Would I come back or recommend the hotel, No, plenty of choice out there with better food choices, better service and quieter rooms.",2,2018,12,15
223,Has to be reviewed!!,"Sorry this is a rathwr long review, but one has to be made.

We had planned a family weekend away so we could take our children to dublin for the zoo and a santa a visit and thought Castlenock based on reviews would be an ideal location and family friendly. However we were somewhat let down from the very start. We arrived on the Saturday, and as you can imagine travelling with toddler twins comes with a fair amount of luggage . We struggled in and not once at check in were we asked if we would like any assistance to get to our room. We struggled to our room and passed between 5-7 staff members and again not one person asked if we were ok or needed help, and one staff member ever pushed passed us with a sigh! Anyway we put that down to the hotel being busy but still not acceptable. So we got into our room and, expected a nice family room based on the fact the hotel is a 4 star, bit when all said and done the room was not overly clean or in anyway better than a standard budget hotel offering. We found left over items from whoever stayed before us and also just wasn't a good standard. We als needed to call to reception to ask where we could dispose of nappies and were simply, told to just leave them in the waste paper bin in the room, not really an option  with twins and in one room. 

The room had no heating controls at all and was beyond stuffy, there was at least a fan. Decided we would open the window for some fresh air, however on opening the window we certainly could not leave it open. Our twins are under 2, and the window, whilst it had a safety chain in it the children could easily get through the opening, especially where the table and chairs were and where the bed was situated, with a big window sill that could easily be stood on. In no way was this a safe family room.

We arrived quite late in the day after a busy day, the children were tired so we decided we would get room service. We tried to call down 4-5 times without any answer, finally someone did answer. Unfortunately one of our children has a dairy food intolerance so we have to be very careful on what we feed her. The room service menu, was limited at best, with no child friendly options or food intolerance options. We called down to try and arrange something but all we could be offered were boiled eggs, plain bread and some ham. We would really expect a little more for a 4 star hotel. Once again we have had better from budget stays. Finally on check out we raised all the points listed here, only to be what could be called as dismissive, the front desk, wrote down on a scrap of paper and said thanks for raising. We asked for a call the next day to discuss our concerns as we knew it was being dismissed and we were quite right as we still never got a call. We are sorry to say we could certainly not recommend this hotel for a family or even couple stay. Whilst I'm sure the golfers love the course the hotel l, accomodation and staff leave a lot to be desired.

I must clearly note from the window pictures I have posted, whilst do not clearly show the size gap, I would like to restate the gap is easily big enough for a toddler to get through, and want to ensure it is raised as I would be extremely concerned to any other parents that stay here to ensure they note this. It really is a hazard and one that concerns me the most.",1,2018,12,11
223,Christmas Getaway,Great location. Suite was so spacious and suited us perfectly for our 2 night stay. The staff were extremely accomodating ams so friendly. The Christmas atmosphere was lovely and  I have no complaints about the stay.,5,2018,12,11
223,Lovely hotel ,"Accommodation was well appointed , spotless and we were really pleasantly surprised by the size of the room . 

Breakfast was delicious and hot with plenty of choice and the staff we encountered were really pleasant 

We enjoyed some really good live music in the bar on the Friday night of our stay

Would certainly return ",4,2018,12,10
223,Great Christmas Party Venue,"Visited the Castleknock hotel for my Christmas party with work. The hotel d√©cor is gorgeous and a very warm welcome from all the staff. 
Would definitely come back for dinner in the restaurant, the interiors are gorgeous and loads of cosy tables to dine for the night. 
We were greeted with prosecco, mulled wine and hot whiskeys and there was no shortage of staff around the place to grab a drink.
We dined in the larger room where the tables were laid out banquet style. Having worked in the industry myself I can say the banqueting staff on duty that night were some of the nicest, most efficient I‚Äôve come across. 
The dinner was lovely albeit lacking a little creativity but that‚Äôs not usually reserved for large party groups on Christmas nights. Nonetheless was all delicious.
A lovely hotel.",4,2018,12,07
223,Amazing but!!,Absolutely fabulous hotel but asked for a drink after 2 o clock am and  they said that the bar was closed and served no drink to us as we are residents and we're discussed at that! Don't go for a residents bar!!,3,2018,12,06
223,Planning to come back!!,"On arrival we were welcomed by Niamh on reception.  After checking in we went to our room.  As my husband is diabetic we need a fridge to keep his insulin cool.  Within minutes of requesting it from Niamh, a small fridge was promptly delivered to our room.  The first night of our stay the room was very hot despite turning off the radiator thermostats!  This was reported to reception when we went down for breakfast, after breakfast the maintenance guy came and sorted out the radiators.  The rest of our 4 night stay was uneventful,  The staff were all very polite and helpful.  Worth booking breakfast, a wide selection of food to accommodate everyone.

The hotel was only 25 mins drive from Dublin port, we left our car in the hotel car park and brought Leap visitor cards for site seeing and travelling around Dublin.  The hotel is on a bus route only a few minutes walk away.

The spa facilities and treatments were very relaxing and the therapist was very good in making the whole spa experience enjoyable.",5,2018,12,06
223,Spa treatment + afternoon tea,"My friend's 30th bithday surprise present was an amazing ""time for me pack "" which included Swedish full body massage and a facial hydration treatment which we both absolutely enjoyed. 

Superb service, wonderfully professionals and the best facilities ever.
Jennifer had a impeccable treat towards me.

We could also enjoy an afternoon tea served by lovely staff working there and surrended by the beautiful atmosphere ( very Christmary and cozy)
It was a super day in the best company .

223,Brilliant hotel and wonderful staff ,"I stayed here for 3 nights with work, and wasn't let down. Amazing room, brilliant food and fantastic service. Great staff who were very attentive to any need. I'm looking forward to a return at some point in the future when the finances allow it!! ",5,2018,12,01
223,Memories For The Wrong Reasons,"My wife and I stayed in these hotel as we could see it was a 4 star hotel plus it‚Äôs local for visiting family who live in Castleknock. We arrived ait around 10.30 and our first impressions was it  looks fabulous and we were greeted by reception in a very warm  and welcoming way. they informed us that our room was not ready but we could live our luggage which we did. On our return at around 15.00 hrs we returned to reception and was informed our room was ready and we were given room on the first floor. When we arrive in our room 
which was adjoining room we could hear the person in the other room on her phone and could hear every word she said, we unpacked and settled into 
our room, my wife was very tired and went to sleep in the bed only to be woken by the constant banging of a delivery of beer kegs being delivered and 
empty‚Äôs being picked up this carried on for some time, I believe the room had double glazing yet we could still hear the noise.I went back to reception to 
complain and requested another room to be informed by the male receptionist we are fully booked and have no rooms but by some act of god 
one appeared which was on the second floor in room 205. So I returned to our room and began backing to move. This is when I discovered a pair of 
green football socks that were stiff and smelled and obviously had been at the back of the draw for considerable amount of time as it was full of white 
dust. We went to room 205 and once again unpacked but we noticed that the previous room had 2 bedside cabinets with lights on them yet this room 
only had one bedside cabinet and the room was very dark. We were both very tired as we had been up since 5.00am. At this time I thought it would be 
better to eat at the hotel so I decided to book a table in the restaurant for 18.30 but was unable to get through as reception were not picking up this carried 
on for 20 minutes, at this point I decided to go down to reception and speak with them face to face and book a table at that point I went over to the curtains 
to close them when I noticed what I believe to be dry blood stains, It was at this point the red mist came over me as this was the final straw. I made my way 
to reception to complain to the young man on reception when a young lady appeared who I believe was called Bee who I must congratulate for

the way she represented herself for the hotel as she was very professional in the way she handled the 
situation, first of all she apologised, secondly which I was not expecting upgraded us and thirdly she booked our table for 18.30 and gave us a 
complimentary bottle of wine of wine.I myself have been in management for nearly 50 years and was so impressed in the way Bee handled my complaint 
as I said to Bee we are not professional moaners all we wanted was a good nights sleep and a 4 star hotel experience. Bee gave us all of this and more. 
On our first day we noticed that the corridors were always full of used breakfast trays, empty pizza boxes and various bottles/ Glasses which were 
there for hours. In one such case we noticed a full tray of empty plates and glasses which was obviously was from breakfast as it had left over 
sausage and bacon, small empty jam pods, plus orange juice, this we noticed at 16.30 and was still there when we went to bed at 10.30 my wife even 
took a photo as it was outside room 278 but to make matters worse a young male porter passed us with a grey trolley which was empty yet he had passed the 
various trays, trays, bottles and empty pizza boxes which all represented a health and safety hazard if there was a fire as people would trip and fall. The 
following morning when we finished our breakfast Bee asked us how were things now I think my face told the story, so we mentioned what we saw the 
previous day in all the corridors. Once again Bee listen to what we had to say and once again Bee performed miracles as we noticed throughout the 
rest of our stay the transformation she had
performed as we noticed the corridors were clutter free. On our last night we returned at around 23.00 hrs and were very hungry as we had not eaten since midday so we went to reception and I believe was a manager who had a light grey suite and yellow tie we asked could we order 2 sandwiches which he replied would you like cheese and ham which we replied no just ham plus we requested a small pot of fresh milk, we returned to our room and about 30 minutes later the porter arrive with our sandwiches, after he left we removed the covers only to find they could not even get that right as we discovered it was one sandwich with ham and the other with ham and cheese which we made it very clear we only wanted ham, plus no fresh milk and to make matters worse it came with a small salad on the side of the plate which we had to use our fingers as they had not supplied knife and fork, we never complain as it was our last night and we dud not want them thinking we are here only to moan. Once again we must thank Bee for the way she dealt with our complaint and how fast she improved the clutter in the corridors. I believe she has only been in the job a few weeks but I must say if it was not for her involvement I would never stay in the Castleknock Hotel again in our eyes it‚Äôs not a 4 star Hotel. I also believe with the intervention and drive that Bee has they will keep the 4 star statues as what she has achieved in the short stay that we were there they will improve the standards throughout the whole hotel. Once again thank you Bee for putting the customers first and making the stay warm and welcoming. Yes we will return as long as the improvements are maintained.",3,2018,11,27
223,Friendly Service & Quality Infastructure.,"The Reception was friendly and efficient both for check in and check out.
The Rooms were very spacious airy and comfortable.
The restaurant was comfortable and the menu was full of variety.
The breakfast buffet was excellent with the only issue, the orange juice was from a cartoon.
Overall a very pleasant stay.",5,2018,11,26
223,Spa treatment,"Went to Castleknock Spa with a friend for facials....had been to the spa in Castleknock hotel before it was refurbished and had found it to be ok.....yesterdays visit was extremely disappointing....totally overpriced very basic facial cost 110euros....Castleknock hotel is a suburban hotel not a high end city centre 5 star spa so to  be charging 110 for the most basic facial is excessively expensive.

It was also very obvious that they are reluctant to show their prices as there are no brochures on display... Spa itself is nothing special and having to pay for the locker was interesting....the relaxation room was full when we went in so not very relaxing.

The brown robes were also very unattractive.

On leaving the spa the lobby of the hotel was more like Blanchard stown shopping centre it was so overrun with people and children running round.

I think they will find people will visit once but not return ...they need to do a price comparison with other high end spas and see they have pitched their prices a lot higher than the facilities warrant.

223,Ideal breakfast ,"Went for breakfast with some family on Saturday morning , from start to finish ever staff member was attentive and friendly made us all feel very welcome .

223,Sunday Lunch,"We were a group of 7 ladies for Sunday lunch.  There was no carvery so we had to order from the a la carte menu.  I was good but 2 out of the 8 dishes were unavailable, one of which had been replaced with something else.  We were told the specials at the beginning, one of which was vegetarian.  I had the Chicken fillet which came on a brioche bun and fries, it was delicious. I then endulged in the chocolate fudge cake for desert, it too was deliciouse but I thought the slice was a little small for ‚Ç¨7.95.  All in all we had a great day, warm cosy and very comfortable seats. Waiter service was good too. You will need Google maps to find this hotel.",4,2018,11,19
223,Perfect spot,"Stayed overnight with my adult daughter recently.
Plentiful parking on site. Reception staff were friendly and efficient. Lifts to rooms were at reception. 
Room was comfortably warm and had adjustable heating. All amenities were available. Tea/coffee making facilities, in room safe and windows that opened properly. Good selection of channels available on the TV.
Beds felt hard but were actually very comfortable. Plugs by the bedside lockers made it easy to charge phones.
Bathroom was spotlessly clean and had a shower and separate bath and underfloor heating. Mini toiletries and shower cap were provided.
Breakfast was filling and tasty. Served from 7-11am at weekends. Good choice of hot and cold food and separate gluten free options available.
We did not use the leisure facilities or Spa while we were there.
Would reccommend this hotel for convenience, parking and all round customer experience.",5,2018,11,17
223,Not the best ,"For a 4 star hotel rooms where a joke singles squashed together room was boiling 
Hot so let's open some windows oh there a flat roof outside with 20 + fans making so much noise it would wake the dead.
Was told wrong times for breakfast 
Found 90% of staff rude and couldn't give a monkey's 
Wouldn't recommend and no I wouldn't go back ",2,2018,11,12
223,Relaxing and Enjoyable Stay,"I stayed at the Castleknock Hotel for 5 nights while attending a course. I found the hotel very well kept, and a nice friendly and relaxing atmosphere. Absolutely perfect considering my reasons for being there.
The room was very comfortable and well layed out with everything I needed. 
I had asked for extra still water and no sparkling water each day, and there was no problem with this. It‚Äôs very refreshing to NOT have to ask a second time! It shows they listened the first time! Very refreshing indeed.
The food in the restaurant is also very good. Thanks to all for a very pleasant experience.",5,2018,11,12
223,Couple getaway,"The perfect hosts!!!!! A surprise birthday present for the boyfriend..... The most gorgeous hotel, we were blown away !!!  Yummy breakfast, Lovely staff, beautiful rooms and amazing setting! Thank you so much for such a wonderful stay !!!!",5,2018,11,06
223,A good spot,"We came as a family, People with kids‚Äîbe sure to request the lobby level rooms that have patio doors that walk out to the playground...if I had one of those rooms I‚Äôd give this place a 5 star plus you can walk out of your room and the spa and pool is 10 feet away. Anyhow, rooms are very nice, fish and chips are SUPER good, Jason at the front dest was a very kind receptionist and was 5 star (when I forgot my passport he was so helpful!), the maids did entirely forget to clean our room one day and the girl who came seem upset she had to turn the room in the evening, they provide babysitting which I wish I would have utilized going back, and a cool part of the hotel is they have bootcamp group workout in the gym.  It was a negative that it was such a trek to get to the bus to head to the city BUT the walk to the bus from the hotel was beautiful and kid friendly. Anyhow, I‚Äôd stay here again. Is recommend the hotel get an indoor playroom for the kids to have a spot to go when it‚Äôs too cold outside‚Äîit‚Äôs cheap to do and they would have a monopoly on the Dublin market since no one has this kind of thing. ",4,2018,11,06
223,Conference at Hotel,"Excellent conference facilities. Attentive staff and well appointed hotel. Stayed the night in a great room recommended.
The menu in the brasserie section off the bar is very limited and the food ok but not superb.
The restaurant on the other hand is very good. 
Would stay again",4,2018,11,05
223,Beautiful hotel and golf course,"The rooms at Castleknock Hotel are large and well equipped.  The food in the restaurant was very good, with an exceptional free breakfast (some of the best Irish sausage I've had).  Wonderful service, from the wait staff to the front desk.  Short cab ride into Dublin, or easy walk to the 37 bus that takes you right into town.  The golf course is beautiful; great drainage on rainy days!  I'll stay here again.",5,2018,10,29
223,Rude Reception and Disappointing  Afternoon Tea,"Upon arrival we received a very curt and rude reception by the hostess. She was extremely rude and made a very sarcastic comment to my mother which set the tone for an awful experience. Front of House staff are very important and this person's behaviour was unacceptable. 
The Food Manager approached us but did not deal with it well and caused more offense when he alluded to the fact he didn't believe us nor that she would be rude.  

The Afternoon Tea presentation was disappointing. It was presented on a simple plate, no standard tier stand like at the other tables around us. As one of us has an allergy we guessed that was the reason we got separate plates. However, it was disappointing. Simple things like cutlery and butter were missing from the table. Simple basics.

The food itself was not great. The scones were very hard and lacked any taste. The fruit on the panna cotta tasted like tinned fruit. In my opinion, the overall plate tasted like it was pre packaged and slightly stale. Not at all like any other Afternoon Tea I have experienced. We didn't eat most of it. 

The manager eventually apologised after we paid with the gift voucher we had. He asked if we would return and I told him we wouldn't. Upon leaving the hotel he approached us with the voucher I paid with to offer it back and asked if we would return. As this was supposed to a belated celebration and was instead a very unpleasant and upsetting experience, I would not like to repeat the experience. 

If going for Afternoon Tea, go elsewhere.. Can recommend The Westbury and The Shelbourne.",1,2018,10,28
223,Short break at Castleknock Hotel.,"I have just returned from a great short break at the Castlerock Hotel    Blancharstown    Dublin.

What can l say about this fabulous hotel.. from the professional customer service at check-in to the bar / restaurant staff ...5* all the way. 

The room was large and beautifully presented. The hotel is sited within a few minutes drive to Dublin yet appears to be in a rural setting...  next to hotel is a beautifully presented. Golf course...l have stayed in many hotels throughout Europe and can say that this was as good if not better than most.

I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a relaxing break with great food / drinks and as a bonus a large pool area _ full gym and a golf course all available

Will most certainly stay here on our next visit to Dublin area.

Well done to all at Castleknock Hotel",5,2018,10,23

Front desk staff was brilliant on arrival.

Bar staff where every friendly.

We had a beautiful room nice and clean. 

We had our in in the open restaurant, we had a lovely guy serve us. 
Female waitresses could be little more friendly. 

Fantastic place for kids also with play area outside.

All the little touches that had counted, blanks if sitting out side. Sun glasses to protect the eyes, umbrellas incase of the rain and little freshen up wipes for your hands was my favourite.

223,A fantastic visit,"We are just back following a wonderful stay at Castleknock. Our room was beautiful with an amazing view overlooking the lake. 
We ate in the Restaurant the first night & a did a separate review under Earth & Vine for that delicious meal. We ate in the bar on the second night and the food was tasty & the service was great.
The breakfasts are excellent, a buffet style hot/cold selection which are topped up regularly so it doesn't feel like a buffet, more like freshly cooked straight from the kitchen.  A big shout out to Catherine who is the brightest & cheeriest person you could meet of a morning & she remembers people and asks how any activity they told her about the day before went, so she's more than doing her job she is a true people person. 
We also availed of the Spa during our stay & highly recommend both Jennifer & Faziannah for a Swedish massage. The Spa itself is beautiful and has every comfort you can think of.
This hotel has lots of parking and is so close to the City, Phoenix Park, numerous Shopping Centres like Blanchardstown & Liffey Valley to name just two, it's an absolutely gem of a hotel with a Spa, Restaurant, Bar that serves food, Leisure centre with a Pool, Jacuzzi, Steam Room, Sauna & a Gym.",5,2018,10,21
223,Outstanding service,"I recently used the hotel to facilitate a two day meeting for ~25 people from around the EU. The attendees were very complimentary of this hotel commenting that it felt like real luxury, rooms were beautiful and spacious, breakfast was great and many were happy to avail of the pool and fitness centre.
On one evening we had a meal in the Earth & Vine Restaurant in the hotel. As the Irish host of the meeting, I was delighted that the restaurant really showcased the excellent quality of Irish food. We had a set menu with 3 courses. Most people chose beef for their main which was perfectly slow cooked and with great flavour. The dishes were almost like art with such fantastic presentation.
The events manager, Emma, really helped to ensure this meeting went as smoothly as possible. She was professional and communicative at all times. The staff in the restaurant were also extremely accommodating. I would without a doubt use the hotel for business or leisure in the future.",5,2018,10,19

223,Almost there,"We stayed for 1night, the  Room was lovely, clean and comfortable beds. We had dinner in their restaurant which was beautiful. 
Afterwards we chose to have drinks in their lobby area which and paid our tab by card, upon check out we were told the drinks bill had been charged to our room and was outstanding. They checked their bar receipts and couldn't find proof this had been paid, as we had paid by card 1 of the girls showed the exact amount paid at the hotel on her online banking the previous night. This was met with a comment by the staff member that the customer is always right... No apology.

We also chose to use their spa facilities the morning after our stay. The spa had recently been renovated and wasn't complete at the time of our treatments(booked months on advance and changed to that date as requested by the spa). To access the spa we had to walk through a building site with dust covers everywhere and had pleasure of the construction workers outside the floor to ceiling glass window of the relaxation room (not very relaxing). We also couldn't avail of pool or other facilities due to the renovation works.

The treatments we had were lovely and the girls at the spa were very friendly and professional.  By way of apology for our experience the receptionist at the spa gave us our treatments free of charge and small goody bag. This was  much appreciated, however the girl who made our reservation received emails requesting payment for the spa treatments despite us being told they were complimentary. 

Between the Bar tab and follow up emails it totally took from what was an enjoyable experience and completely put all of us off using the hotel or spa facilities in the future. ",3,2018,10,05
223,Thank you,"I enjoyed a lovely visit to the Castleknock hotel, wonderful customer service. My tyre was flat this morning and Damian the manager very kindly changed my tyre. I'd like to thank him again for his assistance. I greatly appreciate it.

223,Awful Sunday lunch ,"Went to the beautiful Castleknock hotel for Sunday lunch! What a disappointment average food with Shelbourne hotel  prices!! The child‚Äôs food offering is the worst I have come across in a long time out of a packet Rock hard nuggets. We tried a cheesecake for dessert again out of a packet @ 7.95 disgraceful.
The staff don‚Äôt seem to like what they are doing no smiles on offer!! Won‚Äôt be returning. Just to finish I have previously stayed in the hotel before it was refurbished and sorry to say for me as beautiful a place it is I won‚Äôt be returning.",1,2018,10,01
223,Current trip to the hotel for our Babymoon,"Working in the hotel industry myself I know hospitality and making sure your guests are enjoying the trip is very important to a hotel... My husband and I checked into the hotel today to be greeted by the receptionist who even after informing her it was our Baby moon did not acknowledge this in anyway... She went on to tell us how we had a view of the beautiful gardens to which when we got to our room was not the case as our view is of the hotel generators... We freshend up and chose to go for dinner in the hotel bar and informed the waitresses twice that we wanted to order dessert and offered to order this at the time of our main meal to be told this could be done later and that she would ensure it was done before the chef went home as we pointed out that we were told the chef finished at 10pm to which she informed us she would get our order at 9.50pm if we had not finished eating mains yet to ensure we got dessert, when it came to ordering the dessert after we had finished our mains we were told the chef had gone home for the day, we did not order starters to ensure we had space for dessert and were left without either... not the best start to our Baby moon short break and it's only day 1 so far",2,2018,09,28
223,Family Vacation,Leigh and Siobhan were great to deal with and a pleasure to be around they were attentive and helpful to a guy who didn‚Äôt know much of the city. Would recommend anyone stop in and see them..... Great Service!!!,5,2018,09,27
223,Perfect hotel for a stay in Dublin ,It‚Äôs a perfect hotel if you don‚Äôt need to stay in the City center. The price is reasonable in comparisson to other hotels in the same class. I can surely recommand to stay here. The beds are very good and the hotel tries to accommedate all your needs.,4,2018,09,26
223,Unexpected Pleasure,"After our 7 AM arrival in Dublin from the US, we were excited to find that we were booked in this beautiful, friendly hotel. The desk clerk happily had our bags taken to our room as we were much too early for check-in. We enjoyed delicious pastry and coffee and then set out for a nearby bus stop for a day exploring Dublin.
Upon our return, we enjoyed a sunset dinner on the patio with a cool breeze and lovely sunset.
Our whole experience at the hotel was lovely. The room was clean and very well appointed. The staff was all very friendly and couldn‚Äôt have been more helpful.
This is a golf resort hotel and seemed to have all the amenities a golfer and his family could want.",5,2018,09,25
223,Incredible Place To Stay!,"We stayed a week to attend a family wedding and was truly amazed at the high level of customer service, elegance of The facilities and quality of the dining. If we ever get to go back to Dublin it will no doubt be the place we stay!",5,2018,09,23
223,Enjoyed our stay.,Stayed last weekend with my husband and a number of extended family members.  Reception staff member most helpful and pleasant.  We arrived at 11 am and were pleasantly surprised to get access to our room as we were attending a wedding on the day elsewhere.  Bar staff also very pleasant and breakfast excellent.  Overall we would recommend this hotel ,5,2018,09,19
223,Nice room. Friendly staff.,Nice hotel. Staff were friendly and helpful. Unfortunately I lost a bracelet somehow in my room but they did take my details and promise to get in touch if it was found. Breakfast was great. Didn't use pool but it looked nice. Would recommend.,5,2018,09,14
223,Castleknock stay,"Me and my boyfriend of 4 years went last week for are anniversary the spa and swimming pool was amazing then after went for dinner and the host (Amy) I hope her name was , was absolutely wonderful one of the nicest and most genuine customer service I have ever witnessed she made sure we were having a nice evening and made sure we were looked after ... unfortunately we were paying with card and couldn‚Äôt tip the sweat heart but I have to say she made are stay in the Castleknock so perfect thank you !",5,2018,09,11
223,Great service,"Stayed here last weekend and unfortunately I had mixed up the room booking and did not realise. Hannah at reception was very helpful in getting us sorted when we arrived. She offered us 2 alternative rooms - 1 for similar price and 1 upgraded room. We were so grateful that she could get us sorted. Hannah was very pleasant to deal with. The room was fabulous. It was spacious and well setup with amenities such as toiletries, nespresso machine and bathrobes. The views of the golf course were lovely. ",5,2018,09,10
223,AVOID THE  SPA!!!!!!!!,"The most unprofessional spa I have ever been to.

I arrived to stay with my boyfriends family in Dublin for the first time ever. My mother inlaw booked me for an urban warrior treatment in the Castleknock Hotel Spa. I was so excited as the journey was so long. I arrived in the spa and was greeted by a lovely receptionist who showed me to the locker area but was told I would need a coin rather than a full locker being given??
I was also confronted with naked children running around which was not relaxing at all! Things then went from bad to worse. My therapist arrived ten mins late for my treatment which was disappointing, she was a lovely older lady with blonde curly hair but she seemed very distracted with what she should be doing. The pressure of the massage was not what I asked for and she just seemed more interested in selling me products. My whole experience was a disaster and I dont feel it was worth the money what so ever. Avoid at all costs.",1,2018,09,07
223,Just ok ,"Hotels should have some buzz and zing and this property was well just flat ! Staff were process driven and really just off the game , surely, a smile , welcome to the hotel ! Upbeat tones are the least we can expect , We got monotones , and in fairness the (not air conditioning room!!!!!  )was  clean , good bed , grey towels . The inclusive breakfast featured the same flat welcome ageing rotary toasters( thrice round ) and food cooked around a hour or 3 ago . 
Sorry it‚Äôs sad because it would be so simple with some training. More a 3 star with 5 star prices really. ",3,2018,09,07
223,"Clean , efficient and friendly , good and tasty veggie choice of food , nice bar good conference rooms too!","What‚Äôs not to like ? Very nice staff - Katherine if you are reading this - thanks for taking care of me at mealtimes , food choice was good for vegetarians, bar had a wide selection - very pleasant patio to sit out on with a heated smokers area. Rooms clean , soft towels , coffee, tea and hot chocolate in room and free (and you could call for fresh milk for tea) 
Checkout super quick and all bills for restaurant and bar nicely itemised , get a room at the front , the rooms at the back can be a bit loud as there‚Äôs a bottle bank which can be a bit annoying ,",4,2018,09,03
223,"Great upgade and Fantastic spot, but dissapointed with the quality of the food","We met family here for a birthday get together.  We had heard of the recent refurb, and were looking forward to visiting.    The reception and bar area is fantastic, such a great location and ideal for our group, we really enjoyed it.
Although the staff were busy with a large wedding taking place, the service we received was timely and the staff very friendly. 
Our group of 10 was a little disappointed with the food unfortunately.  Mediocre at best for such a lovely hotel - we were expecting something of a slightly higher standard. 
Overall a great night, great location.",4,2018,09,03
223,Lovely hotel,"We stayed one night here when we were going to a show in town with friends. Lovely hotel with friendly staff from start to finish and gorgeous food in the restaurant. Only downside was I didn‚Äôt have enough time to try the leisure facilities, leaving a great excuse to stay again!",4,2018,09,02
223,Visit to Ireland,"We stayed 2 nights in the Castlenock Hotel during our recent visit to Ireland.  The hotel is part of a golf and country club, so has upscale rooms and dining.  Their breakfasts are wonderful with a large variety of hot and cold foods available.  The rooms were comfortable with nice beds and pillows.  The rooms were large for Europe and the bathrooms were nice with all the amenities.  It was also quiet.  I'd recommend it.",5,2018,08,27
223,What information ?,"Normally I only leave good feedback and just don‚Äôt tip as heavy with the poorer ones but this very lack of information hotel tops the lot, got to the hotel and looks great especially at night as does any hotel to be fair, made our way to the front desk and meet mrs bright side - not, got checked in and was given our keycards, just to be told our room numbers and nothing else, not where our rooms are located and how to get to them, what times anything is available from, breakfast hours, dinners hours, leasuire facilities opening times nothing, just maybe used to been giving this information as standard...... got our bags to our very outdated ‚Äúnewly‚Äù refurbished superior rooms..... after sitting down for 10mins to shake of the long drive, went down to the lobby to get the information, which wasn‚Äôt a problem after asking 101 questions now I know how a local GP feels..... a short time later asked could I book a golf time, knew nothing asked the opening hours of the Golf club knew nothing.... did the research myself Golf opens at 7am.... only to find after arrival at the Golf course 6:45am..... nothing was available, the staff member wouldn‚Äôt even acknowledge me bacially and told me he could do nothing for me until 6pm, even after saying I run a very large golf society and could potiently bring them to castleknock as I wanted to see the hotel and Golf surroundings before I jump from the Slieve Russell hotel and lough Erne hotel, which totally outshines the castleknock hotel one hundred times over let‚Äôs say I‚Äôll not be moving our annual trips to here......as I say I don‚Äôt nomally review poor feedback but the very lack of information for our hotel stay was very deflated, which after being all round Ireland, it‚Äôs by far the poorest to make you feel welcome, which in my experience means a great deal to me for any hotel stay, I‚Äôll give credit to the food and some staff members for it not overall bad to make out every staff member was uninviting, I‚Äôll see how the rest of the stay goes with the sounds of toilets flushing above me while I rest in bed is good for it‚Äôs keeping awake to do some review writing.",2,2018,08,25
223,Well Looked After in a Time of Need,"Went here after my mother's funeral. They could not have been more helpful. The food was great, service excellent and reception staff went out of their way to accommodate me and my family. Highly recommended!",4,2018,08,24
223,Outdated and old fashioned,"The ‚Äúspa‚Äù area was unclean with used towels littering the place, the changing rooms were filthy! The steam room was also out of order so this was not the relaxing getaway we were hoping for.

In the evening my friend and I asked the receptionist if she could recommend a restaurant or bar nearby to which she laughed at us and said we are in the middle of nowhere. When we asked about a Taxi she laughed again and pointed at a lady with her young daughter and said well they‚Äôve been waiting nearly an hour for their Taxi so good luck. I found her very unhelpful and sarcastic! We then resorted to the hotel bar which was extremely overpriced and had a horrendously cheesy jazz singer with a backing track and disco lights. 

The morning breakfast buffet was also horrible - Overflowing with grease and over cooked. 

Such a shame as the hotel has a lot of potential and I hear the golf course is very nice too. ",1,2018,08,24
223,2 Night Stay,Very nice hotel. Stayed for two nights and was impressed. Reception very welcoming and check in efficient. Had lunch in the bar area again very nice. Breakfast was also very good apart from a small wait for tea. Ordered a sandwich from the late night menu and while I didnt expect much (as it was out of hours) it was yum. Well done to all.,5,2018,08,22
223,"Poor buffet breakfast, flat white extra charge & no value ","This place and hotel is not a good value option. The breakfast options are not good at all, everything is cooked at 7am & dropped in trays, the eggs overcooked, the bacon disgusting, the potatoes over cooked. When asked for a coffee I ordered a flat white and I was told that is not
Included in the breakfast, what a ridiculous rule? Also there is no table service and no options to order food like
Poached eggs etc...Overall no worth at all to Come back ",1,2018,08,21
223,Overnight stay,"Simply looking for somewhere as a stopover prior to a business meeting the following day.  A search turned up Castleknock which seemed an attractive and well priced solution.  Checked in late afternoon and enjoyed the gym facilities followed by the sauna, jacuzzi and pool.  The highpoint, however was the delicious meal served in the bar by the most delightful Amy.  Warren tried to make his mark but was pipped at the post by Amy, the most engaging, caring and light-hearted waitress I have encountered for a very long time. A real credit to the hotel.  On checking out we had the pleasure of meeting Hannah at reception who similarly displayed the most genuine interest in us her guests.  Overall we had a great experience at Castleknock and will certainly be recommending you to our friends and family.",5,2018,08,21
223,Exceptional Customer Service & Family Friendly,"Our stay in August was for ten days at the Castleknock Hotel. The service and hospitality we received from the staff was exceptional. Staff are always willing to help, which is what we hoped for as we have four young energetic boy's. This is our twelfth year back to this hotel. We have seen many changes with staff and decor but what has always been there is the warmth of the people who look after us. A warm and deserved acknowledgement to Trish who has been at the hotel since we first started comming.Trish is extremely engaging with customers both young and old, she is always smiling. The hotel is within a lovely green Setting, facilities are great and it's a few minutes to the shopping district. We would highly recommend this hotel for families or for couples looking for a special weekend treat...",5,2018,08,21
223,Average hotel,"This hotel is in a good location and has some good points but also some just average points.

The bedrooms that our large party had were all a little dated for their decor.
I do believe some other guests we met during our stay had rooms that seemed to be more updated.
Bedrooms are quite small for a family room with very little floor space, no air conditioning, small bathroom, no space for toiletries for a family of 5, no fridge and because of the nice weather we have had recently, very stuffy and warm without any air conditioning. This might be ok for one or two nights but any more it could be uncomfortable.

The bar menu for children had a very limited choice or just not to our taste. Kids favourites of chicken nuggets/goujons/sausages/fish fingers/garlic bread were not on the menu.
Pizza was available on the standard menu which you could get for a child but they don‚Äôt have a smaller option of pizza for children.
The bar menu is expensive enough for what you are getting to eat.

Pool opening hours for children didn‚Äôt suit our group as they were only allowed in from 10am until 6pm. 
I do think it‚Äôs a good idea to have available times for adults to use the pool facility without children, however our families would usually be out during the day and because we couldn‚Äôt use the pool prior to breakfast it wasn‚Äôt suitable for us.

Bar service was very slow, I think the hotel could of had more staff on.

The gym and pool facilities are excellent. Staff in the hotel were very nice. The breakfast was good and good times for serving it.",3,2018,08,20
223,Great Stay!,My husband and I had a great stay here   The room was great and spacious. The breakfast buffet was delicious. Any hotel employee we came across was wonderful. It was easy to walk down the way a bit and catch a bus into Dublin and not fight all the traffic. We enjoyed sitting on the patio and having drinks and dinner. We like the fact that it was out of the hustle and bustle a bit. We would stay here again without a doubt. Highly recommend!,4,2018,08,18
223,Amazing hotel with a beautiful location,Amazing hotel with a beautiful location located in the country side not so far from the airport. Very good service and breakfast. Nice to stay outside to drink something in a sunny day. Clean and beautiful rooms with all the possible comforts.,4,2018,08,14
223,Great Hotel Expeience,"Stayed two nights with wife & young toddler boy. Hotel is very modern and comfortable- we booked a suite so loads of room for toddler to play in. Hotel has a nice pool and a little playground for kids. Ideally located for Dublin zoo just 10min drive. 30 mom drive to city center. The golf course looks great. The food for breakfast and in bar for dinner was superb - really good quality and plenty of choice. The gym is excellent with all necessary equipment for a good workout.

Two small negatives - at check in our room was not ready until after 4pm, this was very annoying having travelled with a toddler. Kids pool is only ok, maybe hotel could invest in some kids floats and toys. ",5,2018,08,14
223,Very nice hotel,"Stayed here for a long weekend and it was lovely, the check in was fast and informative and the room was quite big and quite well equipped although the curtains didn't shut fully which was irritating.
The breakfast selection was vast and very tasty but there was always a shortage of teas apart from breakfast tea which was a bit disappointing.
The only slight negative was the swimming pool as we wanted a swim one afternoon but were told we needed to wear a swimming cap? Very strange rule and one I've never come across before, the hotel did sell them for 3 euro but I wouldn't be seen dead in one.
Wouldn't put me off staying here again though as it was enjoyable on the whole.",4,2018,08,09
223,Best Hotel Experience,"I just came back from a one night stay here at the Castle Knock Hotel. I brought my girlfriend here for our anniversary and I was excited to stay as I had attended a wedding here back in 2013 and the place was fabulous. I booked in on the Monday and I upgraded my room from standard to executive and I got a great deal with breakfast included. When we arrived at the hotel I was greeted by a lovely man at reception and when I arrived at my room I was pleasantly surprised to see the extras put in for my special occasion. Chocolates and a card from the hotel were placed on the table when we arrived and it made our day.  Then when we arrived back from dinner which was a lovely experience also, a lady arrived at my door with balloons for us - also from the hotel.  I had left a note asking for a room with a view and I was also given that on top of everything else. The bed was huge and extremely comfortable and I couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better experience.  Planning my next trip here for my birthday in October and looking forward to it so much.",5,2018,08,08
223,Very relaxing time in a modern & stylish surrounding!,"I can only remember entering a competition once or twice before but last November I actually won on Twitter a ‚Äòone night stay + dinner‚Äô at this hotel given by the Finglas Chamber of Commerce.

Being organised for a change, we booked dinner at their Earth & Vibe restaurant, a massage treatment and I even managed to pack my swimsuit!

On arrival, we went straight for lunch and I ordered Caesar salad and himself a gorgeous Bar22 salad washed down with a crisp glass of Sauvignon Blanc.

Feeling totally relaxed now at this stage, I went to their pool for a swim, jacuzzi and sauna followed by a 45min massage. 

Dinner was exceptional! I had crab & smoked salmon tartin for starters and gnocchi for main, himself had goat cheese salad and risotto and we picked the suggested house wine, a Chilean Riesling which complimented our courses perfectly.

The restaurant is very stylishly decorated and it has lots of space so you don‚Äôt feel like being eavesdropped by other diners. Food wasn‚Äôt rushed either making it a real & proper dining experience. The bill was very well priced and came to ‚Ç¨60 which was also incl teas and desserts (not incl the ‚Ç¨30 wine).

Feeling very refreshed and re-energized today! We must do this again soon!",5,2018,08,08
223,excellent,"lovely hotel 
stayed here for two nights on august bank holiday to celebrate my boyfriends birthday hotel was spotlessly clean
there was a great variety of food/drink, outdoor patio area fab in this weather, such a relaxing vibe in this hotel
lovely comfortable plush rooms
spa and pool area fab ",4,2018,08,07
223,Nice kind bar staff,"Travelled across the city to meet friends here for a catch up, while they were staying over in the hotel for the weekend. We took the opportunity to check out the new pool area - fabulous! Has a few drinks and sandwiches in the bar afterwards. Service was good, despite the hotel being very busy. Thank you to one of the young  barmen - Tom I think his badge said - who was very kind and polite to my OAP mum.  Will return!",3,2018,08,06
223,Lovely hotel ,"We stayed for one night in deluxe twin room with travel cot for baby which was great quality, great facilities for family break, pool was fantastic, lovely outdoor terrace and also kiddie playground, as our baby is only 1 nothing really suitable for her.
We had food in restaurant mine was fine but my partner felt hungry his was not fresh. Breakfast had a good selection & definitely cater well for kids.
Overall would definitely recommend for family break, beautiful hotel great facilities & friendly staff. 
",4,2018,08,05
223,Afternoon tea a total waste of money,"Don't waste your money on this, an experience on how afternoon tea should not be. Poor staff training no choice of tea's or coffees very poor selection of cakes and buns. I wrote to the hotel chef & manager and the reply I got was correct it was not up to standard and the staff will be retrained and sandwiches and cakes will be updated and i should try again in the near future, Why should I waste any more money seeing if they have corrected their faults or not.
Need to get their act together or take afternoon tea off the menu but I doubt it, all about the money and forget about the experience.
Gerry",1,2018,08,02
223,"Beautiful hotel, small issues","This hotel is beautifully decorated and extremely comfortable. The biggest tv in a hotel room i have ever seen you can log in to your own Netflix which is great. The bathroom is stunning a seperate bath and shower which is seldom in hotel rooms.Every need is catered too. Breakfast was a buffet and everything was fresh and tasty.
I felt the staff could have been friendlier. We had to find someone at breakfast to get our tea and coffee after 20minutes waiting. Room was far too hot, there was a fan but still too warm. View from room was of the bins and there are no blinds and as I mentioned it was too hot to close curtains. Workers were walking out to bin and I felt awkward. Also a lot of noise sound the bins at around 2am. Is it possible to maybe put a little roof over the bin area and even put some flowers around it, it would really help the views.",4,2018,08,02
223,1 night stay,"Staff were very friendly and efficient at check in. 
Our room was fine, I had heard the Hotel had been renovated but I‚Äôm guessing not all the rooms were as ours didn‚Äôt look that fresh! Radiator was piping hot in the middle of the day lucky we noticed it and turned it off or we would have been roasting later. Bed was lovely and comfy but the pillows were terrible. Breakfast the next morning was buffet style and had everything you needed and fresh. 
I believe the pool etc have all been updated but didn‚Äôt get a chance to experience them. 
It‚Äôs a very busy hotel and it was a short but pleasant stay. ",4,2018,07,29
223,Good service,"Had a positive experience with a chef in the hotel , Niamh Newman was very helpful to my demands and provided the best customer service to me and my family. The hotel facicilities were very nice and the entire satff were very friendly.",5,2018,07,28
223,Exceeded expectations ,"Got a family room in the new wing and was thoroughly impressed. The room had a king and 3 singles which was great. Breakfast very good and staff all v professional. Theres a great outdoor terrace where you can eat and drink all day. 

All up, I was v impressed ",4,2018,07,27
223,Really gone downhill - service poor,"I stayed here a few years ago and it really has gone downhill since my last stay.
I was on a work trip and there were a lot of us but the hotel seemed woefully unprepared and understaffed.
2 people on reception when there was a line of 30 and each person took 5 mins to be checked in....
Lunch was chaotic. I could understand why the waiter was so blatantly disinterested and verging on rude...until I wen5 to add a tip (too polite not too) and he told me they aren‚Äôt passed on to the staff so not to bother. If that really is true it is disgraceful and is impacting customer service.
The rooms are decent, good beds and showers but the staff really let you down",3,2018,07,24
223,Weekend to visit family,"Great location, our son lives in an house near Phoenix Park, easy access to town via taxi, not very expensive around 25 Euro ,  lovely clean bedroom, had an early book in. As requested, staff very helpful,  tea, coffee etc. Good ironing board, tv etc, hairdryer of poor quality, would bring my own if staying again,  However bathroom while, well stock, and shower good, too hot, floor unbearable to walk on, we must have been over boiler room,  fan provided in bedroom,    Breakfast.at 9.30 While well stock, was so busy we had trouble finding a clean table , again as per usual  you had to make your own toast ,  tea and coffee had run out at the stations, so we had to ask a waitress,  glad we did was much warmer , sausages of poor quality. but like I said you could avoid those good enough selection   We ate in the bar area that evening ,we‚Äôd been out all day 2fish and 2short ribs ,both fish were poor , served with baby boileds and a dip no other veg,  short ribs served with the same baby boileds though ‚Äúroasted‚Äù. No veg. We ordered veg. However waiter on taking order didn‚Äôt write order down and of course forgot veg, after mentioning this ,came 30mins later, good,veg. Just too,late,and not much of an apology average price for food and wine.  Pool small but fair enoughThis hotel is well situated in  lovely surroundings. Could do so much better with a little effort",3,2018,07,22
223,Good 4 Star,We stayed here on Saturday night as we were attending a wedding close by. Staff on reception were very welcoming as well as the team in the bistro. Breakfast was good the following morning and staff very friendly too. Overall a very good 4 star and would definitely return. Jim and Eileen,4,2018,07,22
223,"Comfortable stay, beautiful lobby/room, excellent breakfast","I've visited Castleknock Hotel three times -- all three have been great stays, but this recent stay was the best. 

The hotel is easy to find in a quiet setting - perfect location if you are renting a car or have a ride to the city centre.  The room was clean and comfortable -- comfortable beds, linens, and towels, desk for working, plenty of room for luggage.  The bathroom had a heated floor (very nice in winter, still nice in summer), and everything was extremely nice.  Generous complimentary items (shampoo/conditioner).  

The breakfast buffet was wonderful -- delicious coffee, several choices of fruit, cheese, pastries, cereals, a number of hot foods, and fruit smoothie.  The room price initially seemed high this time, but the breakfast was wonderful and included (appreciated with 2 children).

The lobby is beautiful (smells wonderful).  The hotel restaurant was a little expensive but delicious for dinner.  Staff were nice and helpful.  We would definitely stay again.",5,2018,07,20
223,Enjoyable stay,"Lovely two night break with the family! Attentive staff throughout! Hotel is clean, bright and spacious! Swimming area is ideal and with life guards on duty! Good sized gym! Food in the bar area is very tasty, if not a slightly limited menu! Don‚Äôt order the Eton mess for dessert tho - it‚Äôs just a 7‚Ç¨ for a meringue, not your traditional Eton mess. Slightly disappointing breakfast - no soda or potato bread, which I was massively disappointed about, and found the food to be on the cold side! Only minor
Issues but would recommend to friends and would stay again! ",4,2018,07,18
223,Simply Stunning!,"There isn't much more to say other than that! 
Beautiful grounds, beautiful lobby, really comfortable and nicely decorated room. The service was great and the food in the restaurant was absolutely delicious. We spent both nights cwtched up in the hotel lobby drinking wine. I would not hesitate in going there again.",5,2018,07,16
223,Beautiful setting,Stayed with my sister and really enjoyed. The hotel is lovely with staff that can't do enough for you. It has nice little touches like sun cream and wet flannels for outside patio. The food is lovely with special mention of the pizza. We had breakfast which was a buffet with a wide range and always enjoyed. We used the Jacuzzi and pool which was relaxing and my sister had a massage at the spa after being fitted in at late notice. There is a bus route nearby for City Centre and drivers are very helpful just take 3 euros 30 in change for journey no notes. All in All a relaxing stay and clean well kept hotel with friendly staff.,4,2018,07,15
223,Wonderful stay,"Such a beautiful hotel with amazing staff. We stayed here for three nights during a weekend trip to Dublin. All central hotels were full since the Dublin marathon took place the same weekend, and we were a bit worried that it would be a pain to travel between Castleknock and central Dublin. No need to worry though, the bus stop was about 5 minutes from the hotel and we found the bus trips quite nice! Our room was spacious, warm and cosy (although we are from Sweden we found it cold outdoors in late October). We ate at the hotel restaurant two times, and both the staff and food was amazing. Great breakfast with a lot to choose from. I have such great memories from this trip and would really recommend Castleknock hotel!",5,2018,07,15
223,Best deal in Dublin,"I booked 3 months ahead for a destination wedding trip to Dublin. We stayed at Castleknock Hotel for 3 of 7 nights.Castleknock Hotel was the best for our money. Easy to get to downtown Dublin; great restaurant, pool and spa. A country setting outside of town it is quiet and scenic.",5,2018,07,14
223,Relaxing!,We had a beautiful room and a great breakfast. The bed was so comfortable. We had a question upon arrival and the manager helped us immediately to make sure we were comfortable.  It was relaxing looking out over the golf course.,5,2018,07,11
223,Amazing!!!,"We‚Äôre do I start,the hotel it self is beautiful,everyone who work there so helpful and can‚Äôt do enough for you,we sat outside in the sun n the waiter (young lad) couldn‚Äôt stop coming over asking if we ok for drinks  so was perfect as we didn‚Äôt have to move to refill our drinks,room was so big and spotless (Am a cleaner so i normally find something) even had a pod coffee machine,big telly and a beautiful view of the golf course,we stop for 3days and the cleaners were kind and nice and give our room a once over everyday,breakfast was amazing if anything there too much to pick from,loved my stay and we will be back,thank you one little thing tho I did ask wen I book to leave a message in my room saying happy 30th to my husband Jamie and they never but I know it was only a chance that they would ",5,2018,07,10
223,Relaxing spot,Stayed here to go see Billy Joel. Its a beautiful hotel with lovely rooms and big comfy beds. Food nice and great beer garden. We got a bus from down the road to a short walk to Aviva stadium and  back. Very handy if a little time consuming. Would reccomend and def stay there again. Only gripe was room not ready till 330 which is a little late for getting to town early,4,2018,07,09
223,Pat Hanway ,Was at wedding there this weekend had a fantastic time staff couldn‚Äôt do enough for us hotel is great room was excellent but with this hot weather it really needs air conditioning room got very warm plus the drinks were very expensive very clean will be back again great free car parking ,4,2018,07,07
223,Last few days in Ireland,"Room and hotel are lovely but the food is terrible along with the service in the restaurants.  I was served a large dry lump of meat, a plate full of potatoes and some seriously overcooked green vegetables.  Pity I didn't take a picture of it.  Breakfast was fine.  So best to stay here if you have a car and can eat dinner somewhere else",4,2018,07,05
223,Amazing hospitality,We are at the Castleknock Hotel and it has been amazing. The front desk has gone above and beyond in making this trip easy and relaxing. They were busy when we came in but Mariead took the time to ensure we had everything we needed including transportation for our departure.  She was wonderful.,5,2018,07,04
223,Perfect!,We recently stayed at Castleknock Hotel for three nights. It was a great experience and the perfect way to close out our Ireland holiday. The room was clean and we enjoyed having AC during this warm week. We played golf while there and enjoyed it immensely. There was one young lady at the Reception desk that was extremely helpful. She gave us great info on the local bus system and advice for getting to several locations (I wish I had gotten her name.),5,2018,07,03
223,Spectacular location.,"Four day working weekend in Dublin and got a room rate significantly less expensive than my other oft used hotels on the outskirts of Dublin.
Beautiful location and very comfortable although the room I had did not benefit from air conditioning which would've been a plus given the spectacularly warm weather we're enjoying at the moment. 
Room windows did open for ventilation but there was a certain level of noise from ajacent roof mounted ventilation units.
My room was provided with a desk fan which provided great relief.
The room was immaculately serviced daily, complementary bottled water refreshed daily.
Hotel comes complete with a spa and fitness centre which is as immaculately serviced as the rest of the hotel.
Dining options span both formal and informal restaurants with menu options that should suit most palates. Breakfast service doesn't start till 06:30 on weekdays and 07:00 on weekends and was slow to get going with limited breakfast options for the first half hour. Not brilliant for us early risers with stuff to do; but reception will organise a grab-and-go breakfast if you request it the night before and I can confirm its the best grab-and-go breakfast of all the Dublin hotels I've stayed in.
Didn't play any golf but the course looks pretty good and was a great opportunity to get out for a stroll.
Downsides: It's a way out of town and you'll need your own car or taxis to get out and about (I can recommend Cab 2000 as great taxi service providers).
It ticks quite a few of my boxes on several levels and the standards of service are exemplary. 
I'm booked in for another 4 day working weekend next weekend and looking forward to it.",5,2018,07,02
223,Retirement Function,"We had a retirement party at Castleknock Hotel.  It was a buffet meal.  The food was fantastic, the choice of main courses was superb.  Vegetables cooked to perfection and an amazing choice of salads.  The service was top notch and the function room provided was beautifully presented with  tall vases with fresh flowers on each table,  a really nice touch.  This was for a party of 64 people.  The room was a perfect size of this intimate group.  The staff did everything to make this night a success.",5,2018,06,27
223,Great staff,"Had a very good stay here recently. Nice food and pleasant surroundings with decent room.  Would have to single the staff out, in particular AJ, for smoothing over a booking mishap. Dealt with things impeccably.  Thanks for such a great stay.",4,2018,06,27
223,Great stay,"Stayed here our first night flying in from Canada, we didn't want to spend a lot of money staying in downtown Dublin as we would be jet lagged and just wanted a clean warm bed.. Very impressed, our superior room was cozy (had the equivalent to a Canadian king size bed) and quiet on the top floor corner, we had a wonderful breakfast (better than most 5 star resorts I've been to) and they have a great gym on site! And the advanced purchase rate price we could not beat!",5,2018,06,26
223,Perfect stay,"Have stayed here twice for a night.  There is literally nothing negative to say about the hotel and staff.  It's perfect.  Beautifully decorated, spotlessly clean, generous rooms with full size bathroom.  The food is exceptional.  The staff are lovely, very friendly and helpful.  If I was to pick one downside it would be that it's not in a central location and wouldn't be ideal for anyone intending to travel into Dublin city every day unless you have your own transport.",5,2018,06,26
223,Extremely Disappointed,"I had attended a wedding previously and the hotel was wonderful. With such nice weather i decided to bring my mum out for lunch to the castleknock hotel for bar food. The wedding party had already left for their own function room and there wasn't many people left around for a Saturday, which should have started the warning bells. We stood at the sign waiting to be seated in the half empty bar before we took it upon ourselves to find a seat. 10 mins later I had to go get our own menus from the till area where 3 staff were just hanging having a chat. When I asked for menus I was ignored and just got them myself. This service was the worst I have ever received. So rude and dismissive. When we finally got someone to come take our order, we were greeted by ""what do you want"". The soup was beautiful but the bowl was tiny. The camembert was 3 pieces of it melted with celery for ‚Ç¨10. Man had the pulled beef and asked if it came with salad, told no, ordered a side salad for it and then ended up with 2 and an extra ‚Ç¨3.50. Glass of red wine from large bottle ‚Ç¨10, then served in a dirty glass. This may sound excessive but it was just this bad. Stopped in McDonald's for dessert, treated like Queens in comparison. Will never, ever go back and certainly will not be recommending it.",1,2018,06,23
223,Not up to standard,"This has the potential to be a really lovely hotel, unfortunately it's been left to go to ruin with some of the rooms. Ours had no airconditioning and a heated bathroom floor meaning the room was very warm. The carpet pile was nice and deep but this did prevent the door from opening properly. The main problem however was the shower, the head kept falling off and leaking and it wouldn't stay angled correctly and kept falling down. Despite staff coming to look at it, wiggle some bits and bodge it, it kept falling making showering quite a task. The breakfast however was good as were the gym facilities and the staff were friendly. On first impressions it looks lovely just needs bringing up to date a bit.",2,2018,06,23
223,not quite what it pretends to be,"I was here with a group golfers and the hotel looks great when you arrive. Rooms are spacious but the temperature was really to warm. Beds are comfortable. Breakfast could be better, hot items are there for quite some time and get rather cold. We had a dinner menu for three nights with one meat, one fish and one vegetarian item  for entree and starter. Those stayed the same for three consecutive nights.
The golf course is terrific.",4,2018,06,19
223,Food lets it down,"Visited the hotel with two friends for a spa night. Hotel is in a lovely setting and while I waited on my friends to arrive I sat out on the back patio to enjoy the sun and it was lovely. We were booked into the spa so had a very quick bite to eat outside. I had a BLT which was nothing to write home about and very salty. The spa was fabulous and the girls were lovely , really enjoyed our treatments and how we were looked after. We had booked a triple room but it was a double with 3 single beds squashed in so very tight and cramped. We decided to go for a drink before dinner, at nearly ‚Ç¨10 a glass I would of expected better than a flat glass of prosecco, waiter was quite rude and dismissive of us. Dinner was a real let down. Our package included a 3 course meal in the restaurant. I'm always wary of any where that serves foam in their meals. I don't see the need to over complicate the food if it's good enough and in this case it wasn't good at all. I had the goats cheese starter which is on the menu as a salad but it was just cheese with unwanted extras and textures of a jelly which was really unpleasant. I had the beef for main which was really dry and salty. My friends both had the chicken which was also really salty and almost processed like. None of the deserts appealed to me so I asked the waitress if I could substitute it for a cocktail or something else but she declined. So I ordered the Castleknock cake which was dry and definitely reheated in the microwave. My friend who's favourite course is a desert also had the cake and left it...unheard of in her case she loves desert. I expected the food to be much better. Breakfast was ok nothing special but there was a lot of choice. Had Castleknock on my to visit list for a long time especially since the revamp but sad to say I won't be returning or recommending.",2,2018,06,19
223,A BEAUTIUL HOTEL,"Visited there recently f lunch and must say that the staff are excellent and very friendly. However may I respectfully suggest to the Chefs that they become a little more creative with their menu's as the current one is limited and boring. Just one item as an example how can anyone send our Fis & Chips without peas, what a plain dish shame on you.

As you ente the Lobby you are first met with an artificial flower arrangement. What a shame first impressions mean a lot. Please make an effort.",3,2018,06,19
223,Super hotel break in Dublin,"The Castle Knock hotel is fantastic, 2 bars, golf course right next door, spacious rooms and very friendly staff, staying in this hotel seems like a country break but yet only 15 minutes from Dublin city, if you want the best of both worlds of a country relaxing break with the city just minutes away for shopping then this is the place to stay, highly recommend this hotel.",5,2018,06,19
223,Outstanding golf experience,"Played golf one day at Castleknock middle of May, 2018. Very well conditioned course with several yardage options for play. Numbers 9 and 18 share a large green complex with each hole playing to a par 3. Pro shop was very helpful in trying to make our visit a fun day. Very nice area for breakfast over looking golf course before we began. About a 25 minute ride from near center city of Dublin. Definitely recommend.",4,2018,06,18
223,We had a very amazing time,"We stayed in the hotel over the weekend and had such a lovely time the spa is amazing and so is bar 22 and the restaurant everything about this hotel is wonderful including the staff,facilities, and the grounds we really felt welcome. The breakfast was absolutely BEAUTIFUL we were definitely very full!!!! Me and my sister are deaf, and we were signing away and to my surprise one of the staff picked up on the conversation and was signing back I think her name was Chelsea or Kelci )I‚Äôm sorry I can‚Äôt remember!!) it is very nice for someone in the hearing community to be able to sign and made me and my sister very happy she made our morning..",5,2018,06,17
223,Nice stay ,Just returned from a one night stay here. We had a family suite which was decent  enough size.  Breakfast was pretty good. Didn't have anything else to eat there during our stay. Friendly staff. Good pool ,3,2018,06,04
223,Nicely appointed modern hotel,"Had a large room and decent size bathroom but only complaint is the shower was rather small. It was a rather warm week and this was the only hotel we stayed in that had a/c. Lovely indoor pool with spectacular view. Wish it stayed open later than 10:00 pm though, being it stays light out so late! For the price I didn‚Äôt particularly enjoy our meal in the formal restaurant. They had very odd menu choices and everything just tasted very ‚Äúearthy‚Äù to me. We did enjoy the lobby restaurant and bar, however. Very nice Golf Club setting outside of Dublin near Phoenix Park. The service was good enough but not overly friendly. One thing we liked was breakfast choices delivered to the room for a service charge.",4,2018,06,03
223,"Enjoyable stay, out of Dublin centre but easy access to it","For a two night stay at the beginning of a two week tour of Ireland/Northern Ireland we chose the Castleknock Hotel as we wanted accommodation out of, and to the west of, the city centre with easy bus access into the centre.  Our clean, good sized room was comfortable once hotel staff had sorted out the overpoweringly hot  room temperature by shutting off the inlet valve.   Complimentary bottled water in large stoppered bottle was a nice touch and we enjoyed their sense of humour ‚Äì the bottled marked ‚ÄòSparkling‚Äô contained still water, and vice versa. 
We asked for, and had, a quiet room but as the receptionist pointed out, a lot depends on other guests being considerate.  The breakfast service, choice and quality was excellent and smoked salmon was an unexpected bonus for my wife.  She also enjoyed pancakes on the second morning despite a lengthy wait for the machine to be restocked. Overall , an enjoyable stay in a quality hotel at a reasonable price, we could have paid a lot more for far worse.  Shame we didn‚Äôt have time to enjoy more of the hotel‚Äôs facilities, including the swimming pool.  
",4,2018,05,28
223,Quiet rural setting,"With a a superb rural setting,the Castleknock hotel has a lot going for it. Easily reached from the M50 and by rail ,Coolmine station, this offers a quiet rural setting.The level of cleanliness is very high, the rooms are quiet and comfortable and the hotel  is helped a lot by a recent refurb. Prices are competitive for Dublin city though transport cost in to the city center would need to be thought of if on a budget. Breakfast is adequate, service is good and rural walks offer another option.....would return",4,2018,05,28
223,Very good overall,"Stayed here for a few days whilst attending a business conference 

Rooms were good size and clean 

Food was good with good choices on the menu and bar service was excellent 

Pretty much what we expected and definitely worth a visit if in the area ",4,2018,05,28
223,Great ammenities,"This was a genuinely nice hotel. The rooms were clean and nice and there was a spa and reastuarant. The breakfast in the morning had a good variety. The staff was kind and friendly. It doesnt hold the "" irish charm"" but is still a lovely place to stay. Especially if you like to golf. I would say if you stay here, have a car. There is a bus but it is kind of a hassle to deal with the public transport.",4,2018,05,27
223,Matilda magic,"Booked a one night stay to see Matilda in the city. Basically checked in, dropped bags in reception and headed off. Bags safely delivered to gorgeous, comfortable rooms, all well slept and enjoyed a scrumptious breakfast and swim the next morning. We‚Äôll definitely return!",5,2018,05,27
223,Wow,"We were here yesterday as there was a small family event going on. We‚Äôd never been to the hotel before and found it to be really lovely - perfect for an occasion. The setting is lovely and because it was a sunny day, we took advantage of the outdoor seating area and had drinks. Service was great and we had a lovely afternoon. Would definitely consider if we have a group again as we all really enjoyed ourselves. Recommend! ",5,2018,05,27
223,"Nice hotel, good price","Stayed 3 nights at Castleknock with my friend from school during an Ireland tour to celebrate our 50th birthdays. Had a great stay, nice quiet room, modern, clean, good linens, nice modern bathroom, convenient to airport. Its a bit out of town, but we walked over to bus and it was easy to get downtown. We also used taxis or my friends cousin to get around. Breakfast was awesome, lots of options hot and cold. There is a nice patio out back where you can get drinks and apps. The only downside was the wait staff, they were a little slow to get orders for coffee in am and drinks out on the patio. The bartenders were excellent, they let us get our Guinness pint in a viking drinking horn we brought for the last night for our birthday celebration. I would definitely stay here again.",4,2018,05,23
223,Short break,Just come back from this hotel and it was a lovely stay staff are real friendly food is lovely and spa is handy defiantly worth a visit and being only 25 mins away from the centre get the best of both ,5,2018,05,21
223,Excellent ,We stayed for a wedding. Food and service was excellent for the wedding. Room was beautiful very clean and spacious. Breakfast was very good. Good selection of food to choose from. Would return to stay again. ,5,2018,05,21
223,Short break ,"We stayed here for 2 night as it was close to Phoenix Park. The hotel was lovely clean the staff were friendly. Breakfast was nice with all the trimmings. The grounds are amazing and well maintained 
Would recommend 
",5,2018,05,20
223,Fantastic!!!,"We stayed one night in this hotel. Fantastic. Sun was shinning and everyone was sitting outside. The Manager was first class. Really hands on clearing tables and making sure both the customers and staff were ok. Despite being really busy, the staff were well organised and visibly happy as was the Manager. He was great and really added to the exceptional service. His name was Davor Horvat and I think he was working with a young Waiter called Cormac. They made a great team. We had dinner in the restaurant which was very special. Rooms were lovely and breakfast outstanding. Will definitely be back at this hotel. Please do pass on our thanks and well done to Davor and Cormac. ",5,2018,05,17
223,Birthday girlie gathering,A group of us girls stayed here last Sat to celebrate a 40th birthday the hotel is bright airy and relaxing the staff are lovely and went over and above to help us celebrate food is lovely rooms great have no hesitation recommending this hotel highly üéâüéâ,5,2018,05,15
223,wonderful stay,We stayed recently for a birthday treat and were pleasantly surprised with the hotel refurbishment. the hotel is very rekaci g with excellent food in the restaurant and very friendly helpful staff. We will return again and have no hesitation in recommending it to others.,5,2018,05,15
223,Leigh is the BEST Bartender,"Leigh was not only friendly, but he was willing to take the time to explain the surrounding area and give tips on where to visit, and what to take for transportation. He also knows a lot about the beers, and food the hotel offers. He is literally ONE OF. KIND!!!",5,2018,05,14
223,"Wonderful hotel, amazing breakfast","The hotel was beautiful and the rooms were nice. I wish they had some sort of air conditioning other then opening the window, but alas thus is Ireland. I think I like the gated parking lot? Not sure it's necessary but it works. The pool and fitness center were wonderful. The breakfast though was an absolute delight, great quality and variety. Last note is whoever designed the building should have thought about the view from the inner rooms which have an ugly view of the lower roof with all it's mechanical equipment.",5,2018,05,12
223,"Good stay, nice pool area!","We spend the last night in the Castleknock hotel. Check in was fast and friendly. Free parking. We liked the room. Very big bed and nice decoration. Went to the pool before breakfast. Nice for swimmung some lanes. Also nice hot tub.
Breakfat was good but a little noisy. Make sure you sit not in the main hall. Service with the coffee/tea needs some improvement.
Driving to downtown Dublin took us more than 30 min the next day even without any traffic.",4,2018,05,07
223,Really relaxing hotel,"What a lovely hotel.  Loads of room everywhere.  Spacious room. Quiet location 

All of the staff were exceptional.  The big chains could learn a lot

Nice pool. You have to wear a hat to go swimming in Ireland but the hotel sell them for 3 Euro 

Breakfast was excellent.  Even had smoked Salmon

Definitely recommend",5,2018,05,06
223,Lovely hotel in the outside of Dublin,"Lovely hotel and spa a bit out of town - great location if you are a golfer.  Lovely little town. Wonderful staff. They could not have been more helpful.  Reasonable price.  Lovely breakfast. Good public transportation into the city,",5,2018,05,06
223,I wish I stayed for more nights!,"Since our flight arrived late in the evening, we decided to book this hotel for our first night. The hotel is so nice! our room was huge with a beautiful bathroom! We even ate at 22 Restaurant and everything was so delicious! Lovely! I highly recommend!",5,2018,05,02
223,Excellent,This is a first Class Hotel at reasonable price. It is the best hotel we have ever stayed in and highly recommend. The staff were so friendly and the place was spotless. Rooms were so comfortable and clean. Breakfast was superb.,5,2018,04,30
223,What happened,"I have stayed here on a number of occasions and all have been above average, however after deciding to bring my elderly parents for a stay I was utterly shocked at the drop in standards.
Firstly it took 20 minutes to check in with wrong keys , a receptionist who spent a long period of time arranging rooms with views ( to then have both rooms have views of a wall of extraction plant with zero views-I would say the worst outlook on the site) to waiters unsure of what time opening and closing of food service was. We went for dinner , I ordered the orzo pasta with prawns as a main . This dish had 4 prawns , some diced uncooked veg and 4 half baby boiled potatoes in a seafood broth, zero pasta. 
I enquired and was told that there was no pasta left so they put potato in instead!!!
Next came the baked camembert with celery, no celery , bread instead. Same answer as before.
Breakfast had bacon that was partially cooked and lukewarm pudding. They were out of poached eggs as they were busy, also no danish as it was too busy. 
It seems that all standards from a food and service point of view have taken a tumble.
I also had a painter scraping my windowsill at 7am on his ladder, chatting and smoking next to my open window-surely not acceptable in a hotel of this standing.
When paying my bill for the two rooms and the food I mentioned the dinner and my disappointment to the receptionist. 
Her reply was , I hear that a lot lately , we are training new chefs in the kitchen and they aren‚Äôt great.
What gives a hotel the right to be as blas√© about their food and service.
I am bitterly disappointed that I have had such a ‚Äúcar crash‚Äù of a stay after a few really positive visits and nobody thought to care enough to make my situation right?
",1,2018,04,27
223,Honeymoon,"We stayed here for our honeymoon and the staff was incredibly nice from the moment we arrived. Dinner was fantastic and, I'm not a breakfast person, but I definitely was during our stay.
We will definitely return in the future.",5,2018,04,25
223,Great hotel ,"First stay at castleknock and have to say it's a fantastic hotel. The staff are friendly and helpful, breakfast is full of choice and the rooms are excellent . Great value for money, Will definitely return on my next trip ",5,2018,04,25
223,"Lovely hotel, first class staff.","We stayed here back in March during the first ""Beast from the East"". 

We paid a little extra for an executive room for the netflix and the golf course view. When we got to our room we were overlooking the hotel entrance, we went down and mentioned this and they happily moved us to a room with a better view. 

Rooms were lovely, big comfy beds, nice facilities, complimentary water. 

The Spa area and pool is lovely we mainly went in the evening and it was very peaceful. Breakfast was plentyful and great (especially the pancake machine!!) And all the food we had in the hotel was lovely. 

We ended up staying here an extra night because of a cancelled flight. The room we were moved too was also lovely. The staff dealt with our extension so well and were so helpful with everything including trying everything they could to get us an airport taxi. The snow was so bad most of the staff stayed at the hotel for three days but they still managed to keep in high spirits and good humour. We were grateful for all the kind things they did and how well they treated all of us who were stranded. Thank You so much for a lovley and memorable snowwy stay!",4,2018,04,24
223,"Great Hotel, Great Location !","We stayed here for two nights in their executive suites recently. Our suite overlooked the golf course with a nice pond to the forefront & trees lining the background, just the perfect relaxing scenery so close to Dublin City. Our suite was exquisite, spotless, comfortable with large flat screen TV's in both the bedroom & sitting room areas. A fully stocked Mini Bar was also convenient. The managers & staff in all areas were so helpful, friendly & efficient, they or our suites could not be surpassed.
On the downside the Restaurant dinner menu did not cut it but the bar menu was excellent. The buffet breakfast offered plenty of choice,  we ate at 9.30am on one morning & a lot of the hot food was rather dried up. On the second morning we ate at 6.30am & 2 full containers each of rashers & sausages were already present on the large bain-marie which was probably why they would become so dried up later in the morning. There were no fried, poached or scrambled eggs even by 6.45am on the second morning & no soda bread available on either day. These were the only slight faults during our otherwise perfect stay.
The large outside smoking / seating area which overlooked the golf course was a great asset during the sunny weather which we enjoyed during our visit.",4,2018,04,24
223,"Golf hotel, hmm?","We thought we had booked a cosy golf hotel with full of golfers and full service for golfers.
Nope, the hotel staff didn‚Äôt have a clue of golf. I asked where is the pro shop?: what‚Äôs this? Where can I get a buggy?: buggy? Where can I store the golf bags?: no storage. Courtesy shuttle to the golf club? Doesn‚Äôt exist.

Room was a good size and quiet looking over the golf course. Air conditioning was working quiet also. The big bed was quite hard but pillows were really comfortable. Bathroom with one wash, bath and a small shower cabinet (strangely fixed hand shower, you couldn‚Äôt take it down) had very basic amenities but no cotton pads or stabs etc. The floor looked dirty but when looking at it closer it was some kind of glue or concrete- in any case should be removed!
Bath ropes, slippers, still and sparkling water as a courtesy in the room. No mini bar - I don‚Äôt know if it is common in Ireland since this was a second hotel without it during our stay.

Instead of being a golf hotel it is more a noisy family hotel where kids are screaming and running around.  Restaurant area in 22 is busy, noisy and messy. During lunch time some guests even came to eat or drink in their bathrobes! I don‚Äôt know what to think about that???
During the entire breakfast our used plates etc where not collected. Breakfast was a basic hotel breakfast but all fresh vegetables were missing. Porridge was not waking the appetite at all by its look. Eggs cooked extremely hard.

One night we had dinner from the room service: unfortunately it arrived almost cold. Wine instead was too warm and we had to order extra a missing wine glass.

Dining at Earth & Wine restaurant was almost as noisy as the whole hotel ground floor area. Forget everything about a romantic dinner. My starter was good but main course (fish) over cooked and dry. A special thank for a very friendly service to Elena.

We didn‚Äôt use the spa area so I can‚Äôt comment anything about it.",3,2018,04,22
223,Appaling Service,"A friend was staying at the hotel for a conference so I called to visit and we had lunch in the bar adjacent to the hotel lobby. 

My review would have 2 stars but for the bright and airy hotel reception which has been newly renovated and does look very well. The downside is that everyone in the lobby was drinking alcohol and loudly supporting a soccer game which was shown on the TVs across the lobby. Kids also run amok in the lobby. I truly didn't mind any of this, however when I asked for a seat at the hotel restaurant that's when I did start to mind. I truly have no idea where the hotel sourced the waiters for their restaurant.

I had to ask at least 5 times for a menu and no one came to take our order either, the place wasn't even busy. I eventually did get a waiter to call over and when I asked could he take my order he turned his back to me and began counting the amount of a tip he had received from the previous table. He then walked away with his back turned which is incredibly rude and with no explanation as to his actions. He came back a minute later with a crumpled piece of paper to take our order. It was clear he didn't want to be there on that day. 

Our food came shortly after (which was average at best) but no drinks. We had finished our food by the time the drinks came (and several complaints later). 

We thought perhaps it was just us, but the table beside us had gone blue in the face trying to ask the staff to fetch them a menu. Several waiters had said that they would fetch the menu and merely disappeared with no trace. Truly the service is so abysmal that it felt like someone was going to pull out a hidden camera and let us know they were having a laugh all along. Unfortunately that didn't happen.",2,2018,04,22
223,Changes since last stay,"I stayed here recently for business and found it better than average. Room rate for 1 night was ¬£80.00. The bar and restaurant area has now been renovated and looks modern and bright. Service at reception, restaurant and bar was good and the swimming pool has reopened.
For ¬£80.00 this is a good place to stay, although not sure if I would want to pay much more than that.",4,2018,04,18
223,Returning again,"We booked a family getaway to castleknock as we have stayed before and love the hotel as it‚Äôs close to everything and child friendly. We found the hotel really hot on his visit couldn‚Äôt get over the heat. We had to sleep with window and the fan on. That was the only downfall of a lovely few days away. Breakfast was lovely and so was the bar food we ate both nights there. My daughter loved the new playroom, I think during the Easter holidays and other holidays if there was evening entertainment for kids in the playroom  it would be a plus especially during dinner time. We have done this in other hotels and it‚Äôs a real hit parents have their dinner and kids are tired out for bedtime. We will still be returning though we will just bring lighter clothes next time! 
 ",4,2018,04,09
223,Back again,"We stayed here recently for the first time since the refurbishment was complete.  We were in one of the new rooms on the ground floor.  It seems check in time has been pushed back to 4.00, which is very late.  Having said that, we arrived just after 3.00 and the room was ready.

The room was average size, overlooking a path and some grass area.  The next morning there was a digger right outside our window, as some men were digging up the grass area.  Although it didn't waken us, we felt that it was a bit early to be so close to the bedrooms.

Breakfast was the usual buffet, with plenty of choice.  Breakfast was busy and they could have done with a few extra staff.  When we arrived, nobody took a tea/coffee order, and we found it difficult to get anyone to stop to take the order.  The table next to us appeared to have the same problem.

The room itself, was clean and comfortable, with separate bath and shower.  There was plenty of parking available.

We look forward to returning.",4,2018,04,08
223,Sunday lunch ,"Had lunch here yesterday with my family, food was okay, staff were okay. The lobby and bar was like a cr√®che/nightclub! Buggies and screaming kids everywhere.  Kids were literally running wild while the parents sat their getting drunk and extremely loud. Huge groups taking over the whole place, felt like I was gate crashing their party.  Such a shame as the hotel is quite nice.  This is the second time I have gone on a Sunday afternoon and I won‚Äôt be going back a third time until they calm it down a bit. Rough crowd ",1,2018,04,02
223,Overnight stay - Disappointed,"Stayed over in the hotel while attending a party in Dublin. Have stayed as number of times before but was disappointed this time. Started with a cold coffee along with a dirty spoon on arrival. One poor staff member left on his own in a very busy bar as there was a wedding and a christening on at the time. Manager had time to conduct a job interview but not assist the staff member. Breakfast the next morning was good. I found the staff very good but there were working under constant pressure. Hopefully, the hotel will return to its former glories",3,2018,03,28
223,Room with a view?,Stayed with my children as birthday treat as there is a pool inform hotel of special occasion this is not the view l expected I know they have to put rubbish somewhere but how dirty this looks also pool roof was leaking into pool and parts of the ceiling had fallen or been taken down.On the good side breakfast was good and staff very nice ,1,2018,03,27
223,Everything was just perfect ,"We stayed here for one night when passing through Dublin. We wanted a hotel that wasn‚Äôt in the city & in a quiet area. 
This hotel ticked all the boxes,we arrived around 4,check in was fast & the receptionist was very friendly.
We had dinner in the bar that night,it was really busy,we were all very pleased with our food.Service was good.
We all had a great nights sleep in the very comfortable room.
Had breakfast the next morning,there was a brilliant selection of food,very helpful staff.",5,2018,03,26
223,Lovely Hotel,It‚Äôs a lovely hotel. Great big lobby with loads of sofas and seating areas. We used the swimming pool which was really nice and very clean. We ate in Earth & Vine with 17 in our party. Staff were very friendly and really looked after us. Food was amazing and plenty of choice on the kids menus too. Bedrooms were lovely. It was a little noisy at times with someone knocking on doors in early hours of the morning. Breakfast the next morning was very good plenty of selection for everyone although the fry was a little greasy. The only down side of the hotel was check in time. 4pm is a little late. Overall it‚Äôs a lovely hotel and I really like the space in the lobby. They‚Äôve got a small outside play area for kids which is a great idea for kids and outdoor area for adults to enjoy a drink or food. ,4,2018,03,26
223,"poor communications, a complete shambles, expected more for the money","I checked in on Sat 10th March for my fiances suprise weekend away. We were given our room card and the first thing I noticed was dirty plates and at least 3 empty wine bottles outside our door. I ignored it, I thought I would tell reception when I went down as we had to fly over so wanted to dump our bags off and get something to eat. I also paid extra 15 euros to have a balloon put in the room for his birthday. For 15 euros I was expecting something quite good - however there wasn't one there! I went down to reception to tell them to just take the 15 euros off the room charge now because it would be obvious to my partner that I mentioned it... on checking out - the 15 euros wasn't refunded but the real problems started when we got home. The hotel had charged me twice for the stay... the also took over ¬£50 out of my account which they said was an error and had to refund it back to me along with the charges I have incurred... To this day (6 days later) I waiting for the ¬£231 to be refunded to me... and I am told it will take at least another 48 hours. Nobody has really helped, I have had to do all the leg work to try and get this money back which obviously hasn't worked as I'm still out of pocket. I will never stay here again nor will I recommend it to anyone.",2,2018,03,19
223," dreadful",Arrived about 7 p.m. went to bar could not get tea staffs said machine was broke went to sit with my family and we ordered food chicken wings came out cold with no sauces soup came out with no soup spoon on table tea coffee came out with no teaspoons no milk no sugar on tables main course came out without fries how is this a 4 star hotel,1,2018,03,18
223,"Great hotel, made a disaster better!","2 night stay in a patio room. Clean, comfortable with everything needed - including hair straighteners in drawer with hairdryer- novel. Good breakfast. Staff very professional and helpful. Only annoying thing in room was the flashing green light from the aircon/heat control panel. 

This morning I awoke at 3am to the sound of a broom being used in the corridor, I soon discovered that the corridor and entrance to the room were flooded. I managed to get back to sleep. 

When I went to reception to check out this morning, before I'd even said anything, they told me that there would be no charge for my stay - not even drinks that I charged to the room! Wow! The broken pipe wasn't their fault, these things happen, but their way of rectifying the situation was 5star. 

I will return!
 ",4,2018,03,15
223,Poor communications and customer service,I heard a lot of good things about this hotel but my experience of customer service has been very poor. Staff appear to have an uncooperative and unhelpful attitude to guests. I won't be booking there again.,2,2018,03,13
223,"Andrew, Restaurant Manager","Just returned from a trip to Ireland, recommended by a friend to use this hotel. From check in, hotel room, restaurant, and staff , outstanding, they say you always remember the people and we will always remember Andrew and his staff. Nothing to much trouble. we told him we were going to Cork and he advised on the M50 toll and said he would help to sort it out when we returned, after a long day we arrived back to the hotel, Ireland v Scotland Rugby International and a wedding at the hotel Andrew gave up his precious time took us to reception and sorted out the toll. We offered him a tip of which he refused and said he would prefer to shake our hand instead. What a great man, and an asset to the Hotel",5,2018,03,12
223,Overnight stop enroute north to South,"Friendly welcome at reception. Excellent room - spacious, clean and almost everything you need (why have only one water glass in a double room?). Bar staff really friendly. Dinner a disappointment. Duck pate tasteless and accompanied by a brioche bun the size of a nut. Main course - best part was roast veg. All desserts had chocolate in them. When waiter was asked what someone who doesn‚Äôt eat chocolate could have, first option was a chocolate containing dessert, the second was vanilla, chocolate and strawberry ice cream! 
Service poor. All main courses served for party of thirty (took about 10 minutes) before any veg or potatoes arrived, so many had lukewarm food, or ate a significant amount before accompaniments arrived.",3,2018,03,09
223,Excellent customer service,A very well run hotel with lovely staff. Was looked after by an extremely pleasant young fellow named Bryan. He is a credit to the hotel. Extremely chatty with an obvious passion for good customer service.,5,2018,03,09
223,Adequate only,"Stayed here 1 night as part of a road trip. Got off to a poor start as we had to wait in a fairly long queue to check-in.  Our room was spacious and featured a super king-sized bed. WiFi was free on registering with Virgin,  and performed well. The temperature in our room on arrival was excessive, and as there was no climate control individual radiators needed to be turned off and a window opened. Unfortunately there was background noise from what sounded like either a generator or powerful extractor fans which kept me awake much of the night. I am a very light sleeper though and my wife slept through it so this might not be a problem for many guests. I was glad only to be staying one night. We'd consider returning for a 1 night stopover again, but only if management could find us a quieter room. Please see separate review of the restaurant.",3,2018,03,09
223,Spa break,"Hi. I stayed here last night with my lovely friend for a pre-wedding spa break. 
I was delayed at an appt., so I missed my inclusive treatment. 

The staff went out of their way to accommodate me to make sure I didn‚Äôt leave without my treatment. 
Which was fabulous & relaxing after a stressful day. Thank you. 

The Voya & Elemis products are amazing. 

Brought my mum back here today to celebrate International Women‚Äôs Day, once again staff very friendly. Professional & accommodating. 
Thank you all. 

The hotel itself has been refurbished. Beautiful lush carpets & bedrooms. 
Facilities - couldn‚Äôt ask for more. 

All hotel staff from front desk to restaurant & bar to house cleaning staff were friendly. Efficient & professional. 

Great to see & experience this kind of service & hospitality in Dublin. 
Liked it so much booked it for our wedding party. 

Thanks. Agnes ‚ò∫Ô∏è",5,2018,03,08
223,very pleasant stay,I stay in hotels every week and have stayed in the castleknock hotel previously. I find this hotel extremely clean in particular the glass shower doors in the rooms are always shining. The staff are very friendly. There is ample car parking space. The breakfast is a typical pre cooked buffet style but there is a nice continental selection and generally a good gluten free section. The evening bar food menu is ok regarding choice but good value for money and the restaurant menu is also an option instead. I was delighted the leisure centre had reopened again but was a bit disappointed with the cleanliness of it in comparison to the hotel itself. I never mind staying at the castkelnock hotel and would definitely bring my family here for future stays.,4,2018,03,08
223,Outstanding,"Stayed here as our last 2 nights in Ireland 

This is a large hotel but is run exceptionally well 

Large well appointed rooms that are very comfortable

Breakfast is very good

Decor is relaxing and the staff pay attention to detail

Large car park and good wifi

Certainly recommended",5,2018,03,06
223,Anniversary visit some little things let it down.,"Myself and my partner booked as an anniversary of our first date at this property.  We visit on the Saturday after storm Emma.  We arrived and the car park was still covered in snow and quite a health & safety risk for guests arriving and departing.  Management didn't think it was a priority to try clear this in any way.  We booked a suite via booking.com and it was an older one with paint on the curtains and the curtains did not close correctly by the bed so light came in at sunrise.  No robes either even though we requested them twice and on the second occasion never got a call to explain there wasn't any.  The food was tasty.  The bar staff and room service staff were so nice too.   

I emailed the management and got a response to be honest didnt like the tone of the email.  Not really happy with it.  On my visit this weekend I wouldn't recommend the hotel.  We were really disappointed and this was compounded by the tone of the emails we received back from management.  I know they had a busy few days but they were fully operational so would not of expected standards to slip to incoming guests. Sorry to say its left a bitter taste on my palette.",3,2018,03,05
223,It snowed and snowed,"Castleknock Hotel

First a couple of niggles.

1 The extractor fan in the bathroom did not turn off (no matter which way you played with the switches). Not a big issue, with the bathroom door closed you couldn't hear it.

2 The temperature dial on the shower was faulty/damaged, I asked reception to have someone look at it. No one did, but we managed with it anyway.

3 Probably the biggest niggle is, the fans that are outside of the bedroom windows. They are loud, however, with the addition of a good pair of ear plugs it was not an insurmountable issue.

That said, you couldn't really fault the hotel and staff.

The gym is free for residents to use, as is the pool, steam room Jacuzzi and sauna.
The restaurants are comfortable with some very tasty food and a lovely selection of drinks (including, quite obviously, Guinness).
With free wifi and some comfortable seating the lounge is a good place to sit and peruse the internet for bus timetables and destinations you may wish to visit. 
The 37 Bus is available a 5 minute walk away and takes you into the city centre for ‚Ç¨2.60 (Feb 2018) saving you the hassle of city driving and parking costs.

Now then, while we stayed here it snowed.
And snowed, and snowed and snowed...
So much so that we and the staff were practically snowbound. Met √âireann had issued red weather alerts and curfews were in place. The staff that stayed in the hotel were, quite obviously, getting tired but always kept smiling and looking after the guests, and nothing was too much trouble for them.

Many thanks to ALL at the hotel for lookjng after us in trying conditions. Thoroughly recommend a stay here. We WILL return one day when, hopefully, it will be warmer.",5,2018,03,05
223,Castleknock Hotel and Golf club,Just finished their renovations adding about 40 new rooms to the hotel and a renovated Spa. Food is nice of the bar menu although they could do with changing this menu more often. Carvery also at the weekend is nice.,4,2018,03,05
223,Really Good Hotel,"Just want to convey how understanding and helpful this hotel has been Due to the weather being so bad we had to delay our trip to Ireland and our stay at the Castle knock after being told we had lost our money for the room we booked they have kindly rectified this and allowed us a second night as compensation really well done to Damian Murphy duty manager your understanding and helpfulness plus all staff here top marks to you all the hotel is very comfortable nice relaxing atmosphere,spacious rooms, great food. Very good Gym and Pool. WiFi 96mb per second (very fast) FREE Nothing left to say accept come and stay you will not regret it.",5,2018,03,05
223,Lovely Hotel,Stayed here for my wife's birthday 2 days. Rooms very large and plenty of free parking. Easy access to local transport for trip into Dublin City centre. If travel by bus have exact fare as no change given.,5,2018,03,04
223,Amazing family room,"Another amazing stay in this beautiful hotel.  We stayed in one of the new family rooms; with 3 single beds and a superking size bed.  It is amazing!  So much space.  Good size pool which we loved and tasty breakfast.  Easy access to Dublin zoo, about 20minute drive.  Highly recommend.",5,2018,03,03
223,1 night stay!!,"Recently stayed in one of the new deluxe executive suites and was very impressed. The room was modern, had a lovely view, and had all the amenities you might need through out your stay, the only bad thing was the bathrobes which were missing from the room. We had afternoon tea in earth and vine restaurant and food was yummy and we were well looked after. We had dinner in the 22 bar & restaurant in the evening and while the food was great, the service was dreadful, you could see that the waiters were under pressure as the place looked understaffed, which was a bit of a shame, the breakfast was fine but yet again understaffed we had to look for someone to get us tea as no staff bothered to ask after we were seated. Overall it's a lovely hotel with loads of free parking, and i would stay again only i probably wouldn't bother again with dinner if they looked busy.",5,2018,02,21
223,Just do it,"A hotel with real ambiance, excellent staff, price worthy, spacious and fresh rooms... A real recommendation for those who don't need or want to stay downtown Dublin...

Of course recommended for golfers, but with only 15-20 minutes to get into the city,  also business or leasure stays are worthwhile.",5,2018,02,20
223,Mid term break,"Class Hotel since it's extension, the new rooms are great. We had a family room that slept 5 (and 4 proper beds, no roll-outs)! The food in the bar was good, however the service was fairly poor, both the barman and it's manager were on Day 4 on the job! The bar was very busy so not really fair to leave one staff member with 4 days experience on his own! Breakfast was good the next day, pool was good, kids had a blast!",4,2018,02,20
223,Pricey but quality,"Loved this place stayed here 16th january - 17th, receptionist at check in was a lovely young woman couldnt have been more helpful, room wasvery tidy and bathroom was spotless, we enjoyed the pool and jacuzzi however one of the saunas were way too hot for us, my only gripe would be one of the waiters were extremely rude (skinny short haired guy dont know his name) snatched my plate as soon as I had finished eating.. pog ignorant to be honest, but I would still definitely return here",4,2018,02,19
223,Overnight stsy,"The Castkeknock Hotel was a lovely hotel to stay in. We had the pleasure of a one night stay. The staff were ever do nice and accommodating. We had lunch also and the food was very nice, would definitely recommend. ",5,2018,02,17
223,"terrible bar food ,very noisy outside room","we had a quick check in by very friendly staff ,we had a executive room with a view over the golf course and part of the roof the room was a good size with a big tv the shower was small according to hotel website it's a power shower but i didn't get much power out of it .on our first night we went down to bar 22 i go a cheese burger and i got a bap small burger and a bit of cheese on my plate and that was it no salad, dressing and that for 14.50 euro and it tasted terrible my wife's pizza wasn't much better ,there were 2 large airco or some type of vent units just outside our window so got very little sleep the breakfast was lovely with plenty of choice .the pool isn't very big they only let 40 people in at a time there were about a dozen people waiting to get in when we left the pool.",3,2018,02,17
223,Not very helpfull customer service,"I tried to book a room here and there was a problem with their website and I still got charge for a night I did not stay. The wrong date went thorugh. They would not accomodate me to stay the night I needed to stay on unless i paid again and said it was tought look. I have stayed here before and it wasnt a great experience either so I will never stay in this hotel again. Custoemr service is grap, the rest of my family canceled their staty here now due to this. I should not be chargable for an issue with their webste.",1,2018,02,16
223,Wish I‚Äôd brought the clubs,Stayed for 3 nights in one of the new deluxe rooms. Mattress a bit hard but room very comfortable with separate bath and shower. Fridge in the room and a great view over what looked a stylish golf course. Some sort of photo shoot was ongoing all day in an adjacent room which was mildly annoying.The bar area was nice but we found it understaffed and had to go looking for service. Food and nibbles good especially the buffet breakfast. We used the leisure suite twice and it was all working fine with a good pool steam room and sauna. Hard to understand why we needed swim caps when the instructors who were teaching the children and swimming with them didn‚Äôt wear theirs. This hotel is handy for Phoenix Park Blanchardstown shopping and Castleknock village. I will return again as the combination of a cosy room decent leisure suite and great location with fairly decent rates make it an attractive option.,4,2018,02,15
223,Great Hotel,"We stayed for two nights and had dinner at hotel both nights. Food was great, pool was great and with 3 kids we had two adjoining rooms on 1st floor which worked out well. Newly renovated in nice location. Will be back. We had to wait 20mins for rooms but nice receptionist gave kids a party bag and adults free coffee which was a nice touch.",5,2018,02,15
223,A must stay!!!,"I recently attended a family event in the newly refurbished ‚ÄòCastleknock hotel‚Äô and feel compelled to give a very well deserved review on my stay. From our arrival to our departure the following day, we just had the best service. All of the tick boxes were covered, The welcome reception on check in, Our room was modern, really comfortable, spotless clean with a really good shower... We were in a twin and sometimes I think the single bed options aren‚Äôt the most comfortable... They were great!! The food in the hotel is fantastic! Really good menus in both the lobby area and the restaurant. They have live entertainment in the lobby in the evening, so there was a super atmosphere:) The following day, I was disappointed that I hadn‚Äôt booked a treatment when I saw the spa area, but plan to go back as it looks fantastic!!!  I did use the jacuzzi, steam room etc though, and again very well maintained leisure facilities! I run my own business dealing with the public and appreciate that‚Äôs it‚Äôs difficult to cover all bases with regards to catering for everyone, but whether it‚Äôs for a family event, girlie night away or a couples break away... I couldn‚Äôt fault this hotel.",5,2018,02,12
223,Very disappointed visitors,"Stayed here last weekend while visiting home for a family occasion. First impressions of the hotel were very good, nice open lobby with a lovely seating area and nice bar. Room was a good size and was spotlessly clean. Dinner was also nice in the restaurant that evening.  Unfortunately we had a family room which was located near the bin area which meant we had to deal with hotel staff pushing large industrial size bins around until the early hours of the morning, this included one guy who spoke at the top of his voice the whole time at 3am. As the room had no air con we had to leave the window open as the room was so hot which meant the noise was amplified. I mentioned it to the reception staff the next who were very apologetic and said they would notify the manager as that shouldn't have happened. We heard nothing back however. 
Breakfast was lovely the next morning though with some super friendly staff. 
Saturday night was a nightmare though as we had what seemed to be some very unruly teenagers running wild until the early hours, shouting, whistling, running up and down and generally behaving appallingly so for the second night in a row very little sleep was had. We had to check out very early but I quickly mentioned it to reception and they did note that that they had to eject some guests but unfortunately for us the ones in the room next door did not seem to be affected as the noise continued on and off until 5:30am. 
Overall we are very disappointed as we chose this hotel as my husband has stayed here many times for work and had an entirely different experience so he was most disappointed as it was him that recommended the the hotel.  
I really would have expected more from a 4 star hotel especially the fact that we received no feedback from the issue we reported the first morning, we have both said we will not stay again which is a shame.",3,2018,02,12
223,Great Hotel!!!,"We stayed here for 3 nights and most of our trip was very pleasant. Most of the staff are very attentive and helpful. On our first night we ventured into the restaurant and was greeted by a very unhelpful waiter. I had emailed the hotel to inform them I have coeliac disease and have to follow a gluten free diet. He informed me that if I wanted to know what had gluten in, I had to read the menu. All the items on the menu have gluten in. My husband went to reception and the most helpful staff member, Andrew Sherlock came to my rescue. The whole time we were in the hotel he was so helpful.  
The room was lovely and very clean. The breakfast was good and had its own gluten free section. A self service continental and cooked breakfast. 
The swimming pool was very warm and had a good swim. 
We didn‚Äôt experience too much noise in the hotel which makes a pleasant change and we will definitely be back.",4,2018,02,11
223,Exceptional Visit to The Spa,"Today (11-Feb) I visited the spa in Cadtleknock Hotel. Unfortunately there was a mix up with the appointment time (nothing major) but I can only say that this was such a tiny blip and did not affect my visit at all. I was immediately catered for, the staff were amazing and took care of me like i was their only customer and the treatments were relaxation at it's best! Thank you!! I will most definitely be back and will tell all my friends that I have found a haven in Dublin City to enjoy  üòäüòäüòä",5,2018,02,11
223,Good hotel,"The lobby/bar area was initially confusing with the reception desk away from the main entrance and not obviously visible initially.  The check-in staff was pleasant, professional and speedy but did not outline any of the facilities available; that seemed down to me to work out.

The superior room was big enough with functional furniture. Everything in the bedroom was clean and tidy. Bed was huge (two beds pushed together with sheets over to disguise). The TV had very poor choice of badly tuned channels for a high-end hotel.  Two bath robes and slippers provided which were nice.  Litre bottles of still and sparkling water were provided on the table.

The bathroom had a bath and a separate walk-in shower.  Tile grouting in the shower could have done with a much better clean.  The hand basin was cracked.  Towels were rough and seemed over-used.  Toilet paper was like sand-paper which was odd when all the other consumables were of a high quality.  These factors let down the room hence 4/5 rating. 

The biggest let down for me was the breakfast.  Buffet style breakfast is fine for continental but for cooked breakfast a buffet does not seem to fit the character of hotel.  The cooked breakfast buffet was not pleasant; cheap sausages that seemed more wheat than meat, poached eggs that had gone solid and no white or black pudding.

Easy to connect free WiFi system worked throughout and download speed was constantly high.

Car park was huge and easy to locate a space.  There was a coded barrier on the car park.

Overall a great hotel with just a couple of very minor niggles.",4,2018,02,10
223,Amazing Hotel !Great Service,"One of the best highlight of our vacation ! We had an amazing time... Great service and location. Beautiful hotel...

223,Sr management need to go.,"Visiting this hotel since the first day it opened. going from bad to worse under the current management. they couldn't care less. advertised as a non smoking hotel . cant walk in or out the front door without walking through an 80's bingo hall of smokers. men's shower units in spa smells of vomit. Jacuzzi will burn the skin and eyes off you with chlorine. steam room hasn't worked since reopening. sauna is hit or miss. pool was closed for weeks was forced to sign a new members contract stating the new expiry date but no new start date of when the gym/spa facilities would be fully operational . Could list so much more but not wasting anymore time with this place. Huge list of problems given to General Manager along with contact details. Did he respond?
No, couldn't be bothered. FBD have spent a lot of money upgrading the hotel end. I hope they don't let it go to waste in the hands of the current management .
oh lets not forget the rudest man in Ireland works in the lime tree bar. must have had years of training to get that surly. 
As I stated at the start I have being visiting this hotel since the day it opened so I am genuinely disappointed. This is a wonderful establishment right on my doorstep going to waste.",1,2018,02,10
223,Very bad service,Myself and my friend visited the hotel for a drink on Thursday night.  We sat for 30 minutes without service.  I finally went looking for a waitress and was told she would be with me shortly.  Nothing for another 10 minutes at which time I went in search again. After a third attempt she came to the table to take our order.  We ordered tea and dessert and she said she would check if they had it. After another 15 minutes I went in search again.  She apologies and said she forgot.  Tea was brought and when I asked about dessert she told me they had none. After a further hour my friend went to the bar for a drink. She was left standing at bar and finally asked was anyone serving she was told to go to the 'other' bar.  She did that and was left waiting again.  When she went to walk away the bar man ask her what did she want.  She asked for a 7 Up and a sparkling water and was given two bottles.  After being paid the bar man walked away.  When she didn't move he looked over his shoulder and asked her 'do you want a glass?'  We will not be returning.,2,2018,02,09
223,Such a special visit! ,"Myself and my fianc√© stayed for our anniversary . I just wanna say the staff at Castleknock hotel have been nothing but helpful and kind. Everyone of them made our stay so enjoyable,  a special thanks to Darragh and Aidan in the bar who were super helpful with any questions we had, in fact Darragh recommended the pork belly in the restaurant which we both had and it was to die for. We can not wait to come back and stay again. Thank you Castleknock hotel! ",5,2018,02,04
223,Great location for a 3 day course & extra wedding festivities,"Was there for a 3 day course and related overnight stay and loved close to the entire experience. 

The people at the hotel service you in a superb manner, the conference room was great (though getting the temperature right was tricky), the bedroom was spacious and a pleasure to be in, a shower for the morning rush, a bath for the evening relax time. What for me felt strange is that there was a wedding party that mixed with the normal hotel guests at the bar. As a normal guest it was strange to come to the bar/restaurant this way and there was little guidance. Maybe that‚Äôs a habbit in Ireland but it isn‚Äôt at my home place and initially felt strange, then again after a while it was great to see all the dressed up people having a good time. When you see people having a good so do you ;-)",4,2018,02,04
223,New year eve break ,Hotel has lovely grounds feels like your in middle of country stay with family bit of mix up with checking in and out made complaint they suppose to follow it up and never got back to me the manager on front desk was lovely unlike some of reseption staff were rude breakfast was average   Buffett breakfast  and breakfast staff were lovely we had ground floor interconnect rooms perfect for families and right beside swimming pool e.t.c the children's play room needs to updated very small for big hotel bar menu not great choice and bit expensive and the floor staff were very slow swimming pool was perfect and nice  clean great for families ,3,2018,02,02
223,Lovely ,"Stayed here with my four children in a family room.the swimming pool was perfectly warm and changing rooms spotless. We ate in the bar for dinner and food was outstanding as was the breakfast the next morning. Efficient friendly staff , not really anything I could fault . ",5,2018,02,01
223,Spa destination,"I had a marvellous experience in the newly refurbished Castleknock Hotel today.  I booked into their new spa facilities, titled ""The Spa"" for a pampering afternoon.  I had the Elemis Absolute Spa Ritual.  It was absolutely superb; the treatment and standard was of such a high standard.  However, the very last of the refurbishments this week meant that my treatment was interrupted by some loud drilling.  Whilst frustrating, the therapist and the manager were so apologetic about it that I fully appreciated their predicament.  And they made a generous gesture to waive the treatment fee.  I was so impressed with their attitude and this gesture that I will most definitely be a regular guest to this spa.  And I felt it important to write about the standard of the treatment and the facilities.  I wish the hotel success in its relaunch.  We are looking forward to a family wedding here later this year.  Thank you again for a wonderful afternoon! ",5,2018,01,30
223,Nice Break Away,This is the 2nd time we have stayed here in the last 3 months. Very pleasant trip again. It did seem to be much busier this time round.  Room was very nice with a great shower and bath. Could not really fault it.,4,2018,01,28
223,Bar service,"As a first time trip to Dublin i can recommend staying at the Castleknock Hotel the service is excellent across the whole staff. Take some time to talk to the friendly bar staff at Bar22 and the Lime Tree. A young lad named Jordon gave me some awesome advise on local craft beer locations, a favourite of mine. 
Darragh at the lime Tree delivered service with s smile exemplifying the service given by everyone at Castleknock Hotel.",5,2018,01,27
223,Nice stay,"Overnights here recently on a business trip. Nice, spacious clean room , good size bed ( if a little uncomfortable ). Had room service breakfast - just ok . Had lunch and dinner also - again nothing to rave about - desserts on the dinner menu were particularly bad and best  avoided . All stAff were very pleasant . ",4,2018,01,27
223,Most awesome service,"The service at Bar 22 is nothing short of exceptional. If your lucky enough to have David as your barman, Take the opportunity to find out about the.local craft beers, he is absolute foutain of knowledge. Now if you want to tast the best Irish whiskeys then talk to Warren he knows his stuff and is a pleasure to talk with.",5,2018,01,24
223,Weekend stay,"Stayed here for 3 nights over the weekend whilst working in Dublin, pleasant stay, staff friendly, very quick check-in, room was nice, clean and spacious, only ate there once which was very nice, had the pizza. The only issue I had was that I had to get the room key reset on 2 occasions. 

If you want to pop in to Dublin, there is a alley way opposite the hotel entrance, walk through there to a housing estate, there is a bus stop near the school, catch the number 37 to Dublin City Centre, only ‚Ç¨3.30 each way, get the Dublin Bus app on your phone for bus timetable. 

I look forward to staying there again the next time I'm over in Dublin.",4,2018,01,23
223,Badly run,"It has the.makings of an amazing venue but when they fail to get the simple things right it just screams out BAD MANAGEMENT. When we were checking in, some other guests had been checked into someone else's room. 
Restaurant service was sporadic and badly managed. Had to seek out staff for our order, remind them about our drinks and the food was mediocre. Housekeeping just walked into our room without knocking, tv broke and took 2 hours for someone to come look at it. Dinner was over priced. 10 EUR for chicken wings that were very obviously reheated. The wine was warm and had to be sent back to be chilled. 
We ordered cocktails but I don't think they know the meaning of a mojito!! It was awful!!!! 
All in all we definitely won't be back. ",2,2018,01,22
223,Late night dinner,"Called in for a late evening bite to eat. Pizza was delicious and fish and chips very good too. Ate in the bar, pizza ‚Ç¨11 so very reasonably priced. Great service too. Serves food until 9:45pm.  Lovely decor and relaxing space.",5,2018,01,22
223,Very good deals. Great food.,"We've stayed in this hotel about 5 times over the past few years and have found it to be consistently good.
Once we had a bad experience with a staff member, we discussed it with a manager and the issue was swiftly sorted. Other than that one bad experience all others have been good.
We've visited with and without children. Family rooms are a bit tight and the tv reception has been consistently rubbish.
The food however is always faultless. We mainly eat in the restaurant and the meals are delicious beyond expectation. We have also had bar food and peeped at what people were eating in the bar on our most recent trip and all looked very tasty, and plentiful.
Breakfast is also very good.
I would definitely recommend the hotel. For the price is won't be beaten!",4,2018,01,16
223,Honeymoon ,"We booked in here for a night on our way home from honeymoon. It was a beautiful room as we had booked an executive room. However we gave the room service guy our breakfast in bed request and it never arrived the next morning. I phoned three different numbers and no answer to any of the lines to enquire where our breakfast was. Eventually we went down for breakfast and enquired at reception. The girl was not at all helpful. We then went to the restaurant for breakfast. It was untidy and staff appeared to be inexperienced. 
When checking out my husband was asked how everything was and his reply was ""'teas ok"". The same girl from earlier was by no means bothered that our stay was ""ok"". 
Would be reluctant to recommend this hotel.",3,2018,01,16
223,Disappointing stay,"My husband and I have just returned from a two night stay in Castleknock. The hotel is lovely apart from Bar22 restaurant which is basically a large room with no ambiance or character. We had our first evening meal there and were very disappointed. The menu was limited and our food when it arrived was just ok. Certainly no effort was put into presentation. The waiting staff were quite unfriendly and did not engage with guests. We booked a meal (at the Reception desk) in the restaurant for the next evening and arrived only to find that it doesn‚Äôt open on a Monday! We had no choice but to eat again in the Bar 22. Again food was just ok . Breakfast on the two mornings could certainly have been better and it would have been good had we been asked if we wanted tea or coffee when we were shown to our table, instead we had to find a waitress and then order. 
Our bedroom was excellent and had everything we could have needed. It was, however very cold and we had to have a heater sent up.
All in all, a lovely hotel which is spoiled by the unfriendliness of the majority of staff and by the much hyped, but poor food. ",3,2018,01,16
223,3 night stay for business ,I stayed here for three nights in January on a business trip. Rooms were clean and comfy and the staff very friendly. The gym was pretty good too but the pool was closed due to renovations which was no issue for me. We did have to wait a while for diner one evening but should I need a hotel in Dublin I would be happy to stay here again. It‚Äôs not in the city centre so not the best location if you wish to be right in the city as it‚Äôs probably a 25 min taxi if needed. Check in and out was swift. ,4,2018,01,13
223,New year's ,"We stayed here New Years weekend for 2 nights B & B and evening meal. We stayed in the new wing that has been added to the hotel. It's was an amazing weekend. The room was fab. Gorgeous huge bed, big flat screen tv, proper hair dryer and straightener and even a mini fridge in the room. The food was gorgeous. One small issue was we were booked in for dinnear at 8.30 but as the resteraunt was underastandbly very busy being new years weekend we were seated at 9. The resteraunt manager gave us a free bottle of house wine of our choice to make up for this. Food was lovely. We had a really nice time and being a return guest was great to see the renovations that had taken place. Looking forward to our next visit. ",5,2018,01,10
223,Stay over NYE,"We stayed at he Castle knock hotel over  New Years Eve and enjoyed our stay.
Check in was very easy and there was also plenty of parking. 
On the first night, we noticed the room was extremely cold.
An member of the maintenance team was sent up to have a look but in the morning, we asked reception if we could move rooms which they done there and then.
The breakfast has a good selection of cold and hot food as well as tea and coffee.

Leisure facilities
The pool side area was average . There was litter (wrappers etc..) around some of the lounge beds. The Jacuzzi was also out of order even though none of the staff notified this upon check in or when inquiring about leisure facilities available. 
Swim hats are required when swimming i the pool, which we was charged ‚Ç¨2 each.

The spa
We had two treatments at the spa, 
Stress busting massage
Clear objective express spa
Both of these treatments were incredible and I would highly recommend the spa.
As well, Melissa the spa manager whom was extremely helpful, and provided a high level of great customer service, thanks again!

Taxi's to the city is roughly ‚Ç¨25-‚Ç¨30 euro's.
We hired a hire car through Enterprise whilst visiting and found this the best mode of transport, with cheap parking around the city centre. ",4,2018,01,07
223,Incredible stay,"We stayed for 4 nights and our experience was awesome. Family room was large (we are two adults and 3 kids),  and the atmosphere at the Lobby, bar, breakfast,... was so much family related; kids all over the place, but also adults with no kids showing no complaints at all!! Where can you see that elsewhere??! Staff at Reception was so great and accessible, and so much service minded tough to. We will repeat experience again. Dublin is a great place no matter the whether!",5,2018,01,02
223,Disappointing stay,"I was very excited to be staying at the Castleknock Hotel coming home for Christmas to surprise my family, I had contacted the hotel 1 month before we arrived to let them know of our arrival time as it would be 3 hours before the stated check in time of 4pm. 

The guy who replied was helpful, he advised they would do their very best to accomodate us and if not they would have somewhere for us to shower and freshin up....

Sadly this was not the case on arrival , the lady who checked us in started of extremely rude and there was no mention of other facilities for us to use as our room wasn‚Äôt ready and wouldn‚Äôt be until 4pm.

A room above a Christmas party in the function room which would be going till 3am (as stated by the lady)was offered for us to stay in however we declined as we thought that would be pointless as she did say it was going to be pretty loud. 

Eventually she did come around and become more friendly and helpful and got us into our room but it was disappointing and frustrating to start our stay like this.

When we got to the room my partner ordered some room service which wasn‚Äôt worth eating and was quiet expensive. 

To top it off the bed was lumpy & very uncomfortable. 

I did mention all 3 issues on check out and the other girls where lovely and did offer something for our next stay however that wasn‚Äôt an option for us to be able to accept. ",2,2018,01,02
223,Comfortable friendly hotel,"Decided to stay at Castleknock instead of a hotel in the centre of dublin for new years eve and definitely made the right choice. Staff are friendly, facilities are great, and the city centre is easily accessible by bus. Rooms are very clean and are serviced well. ",5,2018,01,02
223,Very good Hotel with excellent staff,"I booked 6 rooms for an end of year family get together & everybody thoroughly enjoyed the experience. From the time I made the reservation with Lorraine to check in & check out with Naimh at Reception, everything went like clockwork. We had a dinner reservation for the main restaurant, which was not logged in, but I must compliment Andrew, the Restaurant Manager who did a superb job in sorting the matter out, in a very discreet and timely fashion & as a gesture organized complimentary prosecco for the Party. Very professional & I hope to repeat the booking again for 2018. Gerry Buckley",4,2018,01,02
223,Thinking Factory,I attended an all day business meeting in the Thinking Factory for the first time and having heard my work colleagues rave about it as being an excellent and unique venue I was looking forward to it. The room is bright and airy with excellent Audio-visuals.  The circular seating arrangement with the flat screen TVs in a central mounting leads to excellent engagement by everyone.  We did have to chase down some flip charts at the start of the session as there were not enough set up in the room for us in advance but they came quickly.  Refreshments were delivered throughout the day to sustain the brain power and we had lunch in the main restaurant which was nice.  All in all a good location for a productive days work and I would prefer this to the more traditional conference rooms in the other part of the hotel.,4,2017,12,31
223,REALLY NOISEY,"The hotel is pretty and the staff were lovely however during my stay I got no sleep. I asked for a quiet room and the receptionist said that I would have a quiet room on the upper floor. Unfortunately I was placed next to a football team. Fine, I thought as at about 11pm the noise stopped so this was less of an issue but not ideal.  But then the loud buzzing noise started and continued. On the first night I thought it was next door and the noise would stop but it didn't and continued all night on the second night after 36 hours of no sleep and at 1am I couldn't take it anymore and called the desk. The staff tried to find out where the noise was from and initially thought it was the builders and asked them to keep it down. At 2am the noise was still there so the staff came and heard the noise which was not from the builders but from the bathroom. As nothing could be done I swapped rooms and got a few hours sleep.",1,2017,12,23
223,"Ignore the one star, they don't even deserve that!","We requested a quiet room - there is no such thing in this hotel as all the rooms surround a noisy exhaust for their air conditioning system - and I mean really noisy.  Even with the windows closed you can't hear yourself think.  The hotel was full, as there were upgrading works happening on the other side of building.  They showed us one other available room on the same floor, but this was smaller and you could still hear the hotel's air con exhaust heavily working outside, so we stayed with the first room.  

Bathroom:
Exhaust fan extremely noisy and was on automatically 24/7. I noticed wadding was placed inside the vent to try and stop some of the noise, probably there from a previous complaint.

The toilet seat was already broken, therefore you could not sit on it without slipping to one side and almost falling to the floor, and it was impossible to stay balanced on it due to the disrepair.  Reported it only to be told it would be looked at the next day.  So virtually most of our stay, we were deprived of even a basic amenity.

Restaurant:
We got back late to the hotel, so just had dinner in their cafe style restaurant.  Big mistake.  Ordered a cocktail off their menu, waited a long time.  The waitress finally came over and said the one I chose wasn't available as they didn't have the ingredients (then why have it on the menu?)  I chose another, but it was prepared very basic, and wasn't anything special for the expensive price.
Husband said his burger was ok, I ordered the beef rib meat which was tough and inedible.  I left it and didn't bother complaining as I didn't want to wait for anything else and risk it being awful too.

Breakfast was just horrible.  The cooked eggs were served in a bath of hot water, ugh.
The dried up red things were supposed to be cooked tomatoes, and sausages were dry and overcooked.  No bacon in sight, obviously replenishing the buffet regularly wasn't really wasn't a priority.  Coffee from a commercial machine to serve yourself was awful, and tasted like dirty dishwater.

Service staff:

On arrival to collect our key, the receptionist was very stern faced, not even a smile, let alone friendly.

Housekeeping didn't replenish the bottled water, so I had to keep requesting for some, and they took their good time about doing that too.

At both dinner and breakfast staff had a lack lustre attitude, some of them very young and seemed to be inexperienced trainees.

I thought I would have a little walk around outside the hotel to check out the golf course.  I walked past their delivery/restaurant back area which appeared very dirty and with empty pallets & crates strewn, and I could see staff smoking outside.  

Later I went the main desk to ask where the closest entrance is to beautiful Phoenix Park as we knew the hotel was located quite close to it.  The person did not even know where any of the entrances were.  Eventually we found an entrance nearby, it was tricky to drive to, so a guide to it would have been nice.  Its a shame a staff member was so unaware of their workplace surroundings!

In the end it all got too much, I asked to speak to a manager.  I only got the duty manager who just tolerated listening to the issues we encountered, eg bad meal, noisy room, and the broken toilet which took a long time to get fixed.  He basically just said 'what do you want me to do?'  I suggested that a credit for our dinner/drinks would be a nice gesture to compensate for the inconvenience.  Then we go to check out and he only approved a credit for dinner, not the drinks!  I couldn't be bothered querying it, I didn't want to waste my breath or anymore time in this horrible place. 

I just wanted out of there as fast as I could.",1,2017,12,20
223,Fabulous!!,Great hotel fab staff!!  Thank you so much to Dylan and Tom for the warm welcome And wild Atlantic way cocktail and whiskey sour with cherry and apple which should definitely be on the menu!!  The bar staff are exceptional!! ,5,2017,12,17
223,Not Brilliant,"We visited the Castleknock Hotel for a Christmas dinner and stayed overnight. Reception were excellent, the rooms well proportioned although all the fittings were very ordinary. The room was very hot and only by turning the radiator off and opening the window did we manage to cool the room. The dinner was disappointing, the noise with so many people crowded into the room tended to kill conversation with every one except the person to your left and right. The service despite this was generally good. Breakfast in contrast was very good with plenty of variety. ",3,2017,12,17
223,Cold room,"My husband and myself arrived at nine o‚Äôclock in the evening. We went quickly to our suite to drop off our luggage. The suite was large, well equipped and beautifully decorated.  We then went quickly to have something to eat in the bar which we both thoroughly enjoyed.  However, once back in our room we both realised the room was very cold.  My husband was so tired he went to bed but I spoke to the receptionist who kindly had a young man come to our room armed with an electric radiator and he also bleed the radiators.  Unfortunately it was cold in our room all night but once I spoke to the receptionist the next morning they were more than helpful sorting out another suite for our second night stay.  I would like to thank all the staff and praise how professional they dealt with an unfortunate situation.",5,2017,12,09
223,Lovely stay,"Spent an overnight here when I was attending an event in Dublin. Much cheaper than staying in the city centre. Paid for taxi to town. Comfortable room. Complimentary still and sparkling water in the room, as well as cookies with the tea and coffee. Lots of hot water in the morning. Reception staff very friendly and helpful. Adequate breakfast. Free parking. Christmas decorations in the lobby were lovely and very festive. Quiet night sleep-very comfy bed. Would have liked more time in the hotel. Would book again.",5,2017,12,08
223,Wedding,Beautiful hotel excellent staff family wedding drinks a bit pricey but it's Dublin so everywhere pricey food excellent really enjoyed ourselves lovely spacious rooms spotlessly clean lovely surroundings short walk to Phoenix park,5,2017,12,06
223,"curate's egg, bits are great","a one- night stay on business, so little time to have an informed view, but lots of folk stay just one night in hotels and make return decisions on limited experience.

It's a big event-type hotel, modern and a little impersoanl at first glance.  But as we arrived late at night ome of the reception staff dashed to the door to open it and wish us a warm welcome.  Lovely touch.

My room, 214, was absolutely lovely.  I've slept in rooms than the bed itself is.  If all rooms are like mine, it's a huge plus.

The hotel actually has a lovely spacious foyer and they have done well to mske the huge space as welcoming as possible.  Slightly odd that you pasx through it to get to reception.

Onlytwo things irked me.  I love to sleep with the windows open.  Cue comstant noise from the heating boiler whose chimneys are right opposite.  A Low enough level of rattle &hum, but enought to wake light sleepers every time it kicks into action.

The other?  Breakfast.  It's a reasonable buffet, little remarkable about it, but it's goodish middle of the road.  

The problem was the service.  I counted five waiting staff coming and going.  THey were elusive.  No-one spoke once to the ten customers hsving breakfast and when I chased one to order tea, becuase I was never asked, she told me a colleague would take my order.  

The colleague never showed up.  After twenty minutes I stormed the kitchen area to ask for my tea after I'd finished eating.  Odd. 

Happliy, as I finiished a very junior and youngwaitress who clearly had just started her shift bounced along to the neighbouring table with a cheery hello.  There is some hope, but they need to really smarten up.  And it's not the fault of the staff, there is an issue with whoever is in charge.

But I'd go back.  It is pleasant and the bar staff are friendly and superb.",3,2017,12,02
223,Weddings are where the money is! ,"Attended a 2 day conference in Dublin with this hotel close by. 
Looking for a good night's sleep but unfortunately all I heard until after 1am was wedding music! Couldn't sleep a wink.
Reception was as much use as a chocolate fireguard. 
Disappointed that there was no pool open either. Wasn't made aware of this prior to booking.
Would try another hotel in future, especially for business.",2,2017,11,24
223,Big and impersonal ,Arrived in the early morning and told we would not be able to get into a room till 4:00pm eventually got a key about 3:30.the spa and pool closed for refurbishment. My room had workmen right outside so no peaceful place to work. Breakfast just about OK but everything kept in plastic boxes which did nothing for any kind of presentation. ,3,2017,11,24
223,Brilliant stay,"From when we checked in Suzanne was more than welcoming. Our room was very spacious & clean. We ate in the bar that evening and was very well looked after by Amy she is an asset to the hotel. 
The burger & pizza are a must top marks to the chefs everything cooked fresh 
See you all very soon again

223,Business supreme,"Refurbishment complete and experience upgraded. Rooms spacious, warm and clean. Very quiet restful business stay. 
Gym now fully operational. 
Only confusing aspect is area between eating in the bar and restaurant; we sat on tables on edge of both I suppose (as directed I might add) and this seems to confuse both bar staff and restaurant alike; meaning they simply ignored us and got indignant when we asked for service. 
Otherwise very good.",4,2017,11,21
223,A thoroughly pleasant experience,We were 5 for afternoon tea - celebrating our mother‚Äôs 90th birthday! I can highly recommend the experience. A lovely combination of sweet and savoury - interesting sandwiches - great fillings! You have to try the scones with jam and cream!!! Thoroughly delicious! They even catered wonderfully for my gluten free niece - she was so pleased! Highly recommended!,5,2017,11,17
223,ideal spot when visiting Dublin,"I had to go to Dublin recently for work and needed to be in the city centre very early. Cost of hotels was through the roof for very little, so I started to look for further out of town and came across the Castleknock hotel. 

I was travelling from the West so it was really easy to access (via Lucan village), loads of parking (which is free), room was perfect, grub was great (dinner and breakfast) staff were extremely pleasant. The pool was being refurbished which would have been nice to have used - I'll do that next time.

Up early next morning and a relatively easy drive into the city centre where I got ripped off for parking.

Ideal spot if staying in Dublin without the silly prices of the city centre.",5,2017,11,11
223,A great hotel.  The staff are their greatest asset.,"I was staying in the hotel with my elderly mother.  There were plenty of disabled parking spots available.  The hotel is very nice and while our room did not have the greatest of views it was acceptable.  The hotel is very handy to find from the M50 and is very close to the Blanchardstown shopping centre.  The staff are wonderful and in particular Amy in the restaurant was so nice to us on the Friday evening when we had dinner.  We were trying to organise something for the Saturday and when asked to assist,  she gave us directions and advice which we were very grateful for.  Take a bow Amy !!",4,2017,11,07
223,Valentines couples weekend away ,"This hotel was really nice rooms were so big and clean beds were comfortable and does really good deals! but the only thing that I disliked about my stay was some of the staff were so rude, we went down for some drinks they took are order fast but we were left waiting over 20 mins for our drinks every time we ordered them and we were asked for our ID all night by the SAME staff which was really annoying being shown once should be enough. ",3,2017,11,06
223,Returned for Our 1st Wedding anniversary ,"We returned to the hotel for our first wedding anniversary on the 28th of October. As party of our wedding package we got a 3 course meal of our fist anniversary . We decided to stay the night and booked a suite.

We were not disappointed. Suite was gorgeous brilliant views and
Well worth the extra money. We had dinner in the restaurant it was gorgeous and the hotel staff couldn‚Äôt of done any more to ensure we were enjoying ourselves . The refurbished bar is lovely and trendy and the atmosphere amazing. We have booked to  stay again with our son in the newYear and we can‚Äôt wait to see the new pool and spa.",5,2017,11,04
223,Superb ,"Lovely hotel reception and lobby areas are all clean
Bedroom is cosy very large bed. Ample supply of towels and toiletries. Tea coffee facilities very nice as well. Breakfast was also good no complaints
We will be back. 
",4,2017,10,31
223,Weekend away,"I stayed here Friday night to Sunday afternoon for a weekend.  The hotel was very good with a good standard of room, I slept like a baby as very quiet.  However I am rating average as  it was very disappointing that  there was no gym or spa facilities open.  i found paying ¬£355 for two nights without those facilities a little bit much.  The hotel is also quite a way outside of the city so not much to do when the gym/spa is closed.   I wouldn't recommend for large friend groups  as i think this is more for  the single traveller , family group or couple.   I also had a very close call getting a taxi back to the airport.  I booked a taxi an hour in advance of needing it but after being overdue by 15 mins the receptionist had to order another taxi to ensure I made my connection.  That being said the lady at reception Fabiana Goncalves was great and due to her extra effort I made my connection.  I also found all the staff really lovely and helpful.  My rating is specific to the lack of facilities being available and if guaranteed they would be open would consider booking again.",3,2017,10,25
223,Food poisoning and awful food,"I spent a night with my wife at this hotel. The food available was dreadful, specifically the ""italian"" platter which had luncheon roll in it!! Later that evening in the restaurant I had to return the crab (as it was mainly mayonnaise). The lamb shank was served with a sauce that completely overpowered it. We had to watch while a manager argued with a staff member adjacent to us. I finished the night in my room with 7 hours of diarrhoea and vomiting. I wouldn't recommend ",1,2017,10,22
223,Brilliant,"Just back to reality after a lovely stay in the Castleknock Hotel . My daughter and I really enjoyed ourselves . 
The room was lovely and comfortable . TV wasn't great but we weren't there to watch TV . We were slightly disappointed with the view but that was just bad luck - someone has to have it . 
The food was lovely - especially the chicken .I had that . I would recommend it to anyone .
My daughter thought the risotto she had was lovely .
The service was excellent - fast and professional .
But I think the best thing about the hotel was the staff . They were lovely  . They were friendly . warm . extremely professional and so helpful . The lady who served us our dinner could not have been nicer . The young girl at breakfast was also very nice . Even Shane . The manager . took time out so see if we were ok . His interaction with his staff was excellent . I like to observe .
Thank you for a lovely stay . We really enjoyed it .",5,2017,10,09
223,beautiful Hotel,"My husband, mother and I stayed in Castleknock for one night on a dinner, bed and breakfast package.  Everything was beyond our expectations. The room was most comfortable, delicious dinner, brilliant staff like Sarah and Chiara in the restaurant.  The receptionist was so helpful and friendly.  Accommodation staff very courteous and friendly. The breakfast with little extra touches (reading glasses with morning paper) were a nice touch.  Music in lounge was lovely and we look forward to returning here again.  Many thanks to your staff for making our stay so enjoyable. The dinner in the vine restaurant was scrumptious and the presentation was class",5,2017,10,05
223,Lunch at Castleknock Hotel,"When you lunch at Castleknock Hotel, you enjoy some lovely bright modern surroundings. Food is average, a small starter size chicken salad and tea and a coffee was on the upper end of the price scale at approx 20 euro. However service was good, the waiter was attentive. The hotel appears to have undergone a refurb too, which is well done. ",4,2017,10,02
223,Hotel Good Restaurant Bad,We were a group of 4 golfers who were diverted to the Castleknock Hotel ( a perceived step down from the Portmarnock) for a 4 night stay in Dublin. The hotel and staff were very good but we made the classic mistake of eating in the hotel one night. Simply put the food was terrible and the service worse. There was a gathering in the actual restaurant and after we were told the Chef couldn‚Äôt accommodate us with the restaurant menu we were given the lounge menu. Terrible food and after our waitress went on a break??? we couldn‚Äôt even get the bill in a reasonable time. Just the waste of a night in Dublin. ,3,2017,09,29
223,50th Wedding Anniversary celebration,"A big thank you to all the staff who make our Mam and Dads 50th Wedding Anniversary celebration so fantastic (9th Sept 2017) Would like to thank all the staff for wonderful service on the day and special thanks Monika and Shane, who where on hand to help us with a few last minute hiccups. Hotel has recently been refurbished and rooms and public areas are very well appointed. Would highly recommend booking for family celebrations!",4,2017,09,27
223,Food and Drink,"We had decided to visit the Castleknock Hotel on Sunday 24/09/2017.We have had many parties here ,and have been at many weddings also .
But on our visit , the food was very very bad ,some of it was cold ,The portion's where 
very small for what we had paid , there was no taste to anything .The kids meal was a disgrace ‚Ç¨8 for a baby size meal of pasta,‚Ç¨4 for two small scoop of ice cream .
friend of ours where drinking Coorslight they needed to send pints back ,as there was 
to much gas in the beer ,all it was a big foamy head at top of pint, it was sickening .
YOU NEED A NEW CHEF NOW
AND SOME BAR MEN ,THAT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE SERVING",2,2017,09,26
223,Lunch at Castleknock Hotel,The Castleknock Hotel is currently being upgrade with a large extension and the lobby and restaurant changed with new seating. The food and service is as good as ever and worth a visit. We enjoyed our lunch in pleasant surroundings.,4,2017,09,25
223,Eh..,"Stayed here for 1 night and for the money we paid, were highly disappointed. We checked in for a standard room and the reception lady gave us an accessible room (i.e call bells in the toilet with rails, no separate bathtub as shower had a pull out accessible chair..etc) THAT and the phone didn't work and toilet didn't flush. We asked the receptionist if there was a mistake and instead of admitting the error...said ""no, ALL our STANDARD rooms are wheelchair accessible"". Like...are you serious? Every single standard room in the entire hotel have washrooms with all those features?  We LOOKED young so maybe we seemed clueless but my friend and I stay in only 4-5 star hotels so we are fully aware of what rooms to expect...and we are both nurses (we know what accessible versus regular rooms are like). ",2,2017,09,21
223,Very underwhelmed ,"I stayed in this hotel a few weeks back and paid ‚Ç¨197 for 1 night b&b! The room was nice but nothing special. Next morning we had a broken iron, I requested a new one only for another faulty iron to be delivered. Food in the bar was good, service was only ok. Next morning we were sat at a table set for 4, there were 2 of us! The extra settings were not removed so the table was full with no room whatsoever to actually eat. I think the final straw for us was when the waiter tried to charge for an Americano which is basically a hot coffee! Of all the hotels we've stayed in recently there has never been a surcharge for coffee! We paid over the odds for one night here having stayed the week before in a 5* hotel with exceptional service, amenities, entertainment etc for the same price! This stay certainly was not worth the money. I think as the hotel is going through so much change this should be reflected in the price charged to guests. ",3,2017,09,16
223,Great place to stay just outside of the city,"Castleknock Hotel is a great place to stay if you wish to be just outside of the city. Feels like you are in the countryside, but only costs around 18-20 euro in a cab into city centre. Amenities are nice and clean and staff is really friendly. Prices are great for a hotel like this. Breakfast is pretty tasty as well. Andrew the Manager is a stand up guy.",4,2017,09,13
223,Was just a bit unlucky on my visit ,"Visited the property end of May to visit friends for a birthday celebration. I knew the leisure facilities were not open due to building works but without the faculties the hotel lacked the touch of a four star in all honestly. Other guests were not happy and I overheard two complaints. after all the price point didn't reflect the lack of amenities. My room was supposed to be a double but after noting it was setup as a twin reception promised it would be changed but this didn't happen. This wasn't too much trouble and I enjoyed my meal with friends and entertainment in the lobby that evening. Hotel, overall had a weird layout but that could just be my preferences but we sat in the open plan lobby for drinks (nearly ‚Ç¨8 for a glass of wine). I was woke at 3.30am due to an issue with the plumbing/heating. The banging in the ceiling continued for two hours and I had to phone to request a room move! I was utterly exhausted. The noise stopped shortly after but the hotel was fully booked and a move wasn't an option. I requested a late checkout and this was granted. Breakfast was decent and your standard run of the mill buffet style. I was a bit unlucky in my stay with the noises in my room but I made my issues known with the hotel and I received a discount and I was happy with the apology and small discount. The hotel also said they had the issue fixed after my stay and because of that I think it warrants a return trip once the upgrades are all completed.  ",3,2017,08,29
223,Finding the Right Place,"A hotel that can offer its customers a great service at an affordable price with the top of the class amenities is a hotel that deserves a good review.

I have met so many great Staff members; to name but a few:

Daniel Nowak, Ileana, Omar, Hemino, Gica from the Breakfast Restaurant
Stephen O'Sullivan, Barbara, Anca, Suzanne from Front Office.

Well done to everyone; I am sure to come back sooooooon.",5,2017,08,28
223,Bad Attitude From Hotel,"We booked a room for family of 5 over the phone after initially checking the website. We have stayed in the hotel before. We were NOT told at time of booking that there were renovations at the hotel and that the leisure center was closed. On the morning of our trip my wife checked the receipt from the booking. At this point she saw that the leisure centre was out of commission. The kids were disappointed - why could the hotel not have been upfront at time of booking - I mean who ever checks these receipts?

We rang the hotel and were told we could use an aquatic center nearby. We expected this would be free for us but were told we would have to wait for confirmation on this and that a return call would come confirming if this would be free - no call came.

We rearranged our time of arrival at the hotel since the kids would be bored without use of the leisure center. We checked in and we expressed our dissatisfaction. Later the receptionist made the suggestion that maybe a free dinner might be on the cards. I was thinking this was overly generous but hey a free dinner is a free dinner so what the heck.

On checking with her manager this was denied on the grounds that we never actually had to check in if we didn't like the terms under which we were checking in? Really - where else were we going to go with 3 kids at that time of the day having driven 150 miles to the hotel? Also we would have faced a cancellation charge since we would have been cancelling within 24 hours. 

I really found the hotel underhand in their disclosure of information, not accommodating in arranging an alternative and a bad attitude from the manager that tried to put the onus on the customer for completing a check in if we were annoyed with the hotel in the first place. I mean in this day and age - are you serious?

Needless to say - we will not be staying again.",2,2017,08,21
223,No service,I went here with a friend for tea and dessert which should have been a nice experience but it wasn't. Firstly we came in to a great piano player however the speaker was up way too loud that you really couldn't have a conversation without speaking loudly. Then we asked a waiter if we could just have dessert and he said yes but couldn't find menu for about 5 minutes. Then we sat down and weren't served for ages I'd say about 15 minutes. When we finally ordered dessert and tea we waited about 20-25 minutes before anything came. The desserts were very good.  I don't know what happened but it looked like everyone else was being served bar us. So I don't know if I'll be coming back if service is that bad again.,2,2017,08,20
223,As good as ever,"We stayed here recently for the first time in about 18 months.  We checked in shortly after 3.00 and the check in was pleasant and efficient.
The room was on the 2nd floor at the far end of the hotel, with lovely views of the golf course.  The hotel is undergoing major refurbishment at the moment and the whole leisure centre area is currently closed.  Will have to go back to check it out again when it is completed.  Breakfast was self service and we had a great choice of all the usual breakfast foods.",4,2017,08,19
223,Will be super when renovations finished,"The hotel is being modernised. Our room was very clean, a huge bed , good shower , toiletries provided.overall service was very friendly and efficient. Breakfast was good and the one evening meal we had in the restaurant was very good.unfortunately the spa and gym were not yet open.only negative comment is the limited range of room service food after 10pm .",4,2017,08,18
223,Beautiful Stay,"Great hotel. Wonderful food and drink selection and quality. Great friendly welcoming staff. Comfortable well equiped rooms. Lovely grounds.
Room Housekeeping not up to other excellent standards of hotel. Other downside was closure of spa and leisure facilities at time of stay",4,2017,08,17
223,Fantastic Hotel and Fantastic Service.,"I have stayed at this Hotel many Times over the last few years as I have such good experiences here. The Hotel has recently had a renovation in the Bar and resterant area which has opened both areas up and has given these areas much more ambiance, There is a fantastic outdoor area with comfy seats and which is great for Kids and Adults.

Great hotel for Business Travellers such as myself, Families and Couples. Very good Free Wifi, Extremely Comfortable rooms and a good selection of fresh Tasty food. The Cocktails menu is well worth a try. 

I have had the pleasure of being served by Olivier in the Bar/Restaurant. He made my stay extra special and as he has worked at the hotel as long as I have been staying here his Food Wine and Cocktail suggestions were spot on. 

Best Dublin Hotel outside the M50 in my oppinion. * * * * *",5,2017,08,16
223,Excellent new restaurant,Have stayed here again recently and must say the standard and service in their new restaurant  is top of the class. Had a meal in the restaurant on the first night and must say it was first class from service to presentation of the food.On second night we had bar food and again  the same service and standards were delivered.Well done to the chef and team for excellent presentation.,5,2017,08,15
223,Family traveling to Ireland to build memories,We arrived at 6:30am on Aer Lingus on 7/22/17.  The hotel manager and Andrew were exceptional.  They checked us in earlier than scheduled and I was so appreciative due to a bad fall I had 3 days prior to leaving for Ireland.  The hospitality did not end there.  We met Daniella in the breakfast dining area and enjoyed our conversation with her.  She was so sweet in getting us tea and coffee as we stopped for breakfast 15 minutes before closing.  She is a gem to your team.  We observed her interaction with other guests and it was the same.  We loved your outside patio area too.  Next time we will definitely come and stay longer.  Thank you for welcoming us into your beautiful country. We look forward to returning.  ***watch for their grand opening in Dec 2017 following their completed renovations!!!!,5,2017,08,14
223,Truly superb stay ,"This hotel just hit all the right notes. Warm welcome, beautiful modern bedrooms. Just back from dinner. The service was truly spectacular and the food to die for. Very reasonably priced. Definitely would recommend. ",5,2017,08,13
223,Great hotel and location,"Family of five, stayed at this hotel in late July. Had two connecting rooms, which was great, facing south which was generally quiet. Breakfast was excellent. Had dinner twice at the restaurant - service and food were quite good. Staff was generally quite helpful. Location is great - drove into the city centre in 15-20 minutes without any traffic. Good location too for Phoenix park and the zoo.  ",5,2017,08,10
223,"Great Hotel and Location ,",Stayed at the hotel last night and could not of faulted it. Staff very friendly and location is great close to Dublin and practically located at the entrance to Phoenix Park. Our room was really nice . I had advised the hotel that it was my husbands birthday and our anniversary and they had a lovely plate of fresh fruit and some chocolates in our room upon arrival.,5,2017,08,06
223,Excellent ,"We checked in to the Castleknock Hotel for two nights. Our room was bright airy and spacious and the bathroom had separate bath and shower. There was even a pillow menu, so if you preferred a pillow of say down and feathers then you just requested it, I had never seen this before. We ate in the bar on the first night, the food and service was excellent and reasonably priced. The breakfast was again excellent, offering a very large choice, there definitely was something for everyone. 
Every member of staff that I met while staying in this hotel were friendly, helpful and acted in a professional way. I would definitely recommend this hotel.
",5,2017,08,03
223,"Great surrounds, hotel dated","Castleknock offers good golf in scenic surroundings.  The location is great for business and leisure.  It is just outside Dublin and provides a welcome relief from the city.  The hotel struck me as dated and in need of some work though.  When one enters through the front door, there is a distinct smell of what I can only describe as old carpets. There is a table with board games and the like, reminiscent of years gone by.  Rooms are ok, but not great for the money paid.  Staff were all great, very attentive and helpful.",3,2017,08,01
223,Afternoon Tea,"Afternoon tea for a 10 year old girl's party with 12 BFFs and various parents etc (at a separate table) was a complete joy. The girls were first given real fancy juice cocktails and posh service and the afternoon tea presentation of assorted cakes, sandwiches and scones looked amazing and tasted better. The playground just outside the restaurant meant that this was the best birthday party ever and probably the most relaxing for us parents. It was fabulous value too and the staff were extremely pleasant. This is a high class hotel with a down to earth attitude and I cannot wait to come back for our next family event. ",5,2017,07,29
223,Stayed for Coldplay Concert -Crokepark,"I stayed here with my Husband in a double room, my sister, husband and 3 month old also stayed in a double room. We had dinner in the area just off the bar, food was lovely, staff were helpful. Room was a good size with 2 double beds, bed was comfortable, but the room was extremely hot. (I know the one night a year in Ireland) there was a wedding in the hotel, but we didn't hear a thing. Breakfast was great, plenty of choice, they even had Soya milk available, most hotels do not. The hotel has large bright public areas with plenty of seating. The only down side was the pool was closed for renovations. If I was going to Crokepark again for anything I would definitely stay here again, its proximity  to the train station is perfect for getting into town. ",5,2017,07,25
223,Just the job.,This was our second stay at the Castleknock Hotel this year and we enjoyed it just the same as our previous stay. Staff were very friendly and helpful and the hotel was spotless. We had the same room as our previous visit and it was very comfortable and spacious with a king sized bed. There are tea & coffee making facilities in the room and a good quality hair dryer. There is also free wi-fi throughout the hotel and the car parking is also free. There is a golf course on site also and the hotel also offers spa treatments. There is a very good selection for breakfast and the food quality was very good. The service was excellent at breakfast and also in the bar. The cost was very reasonable in comparison to similar quality hotels in Dublin. Although it is not well situated for those wanting to visit the city centre it was ideal for our needs. There are building works going on in the hotel but in no way do they interfere with the guests. The only small issue was the lack of air conditioning in the room - thankfully the weather was not too warn during our visit. We will definitely stay here again unless our requirements change.,5,2017,07,22
223,Would definitely stay again! ,"The Castleknock Hotel was a lovely hotel to stay in. 

Me and my partner stay for one night as part of our Ireland tour. On arrival, the reception staff were very pleasant and helpful. When we got up to the room it was very clean and offered excellent in room services (mini fridge and desk fan). The only downside to the room was that we had booked a double room but the bed was 2 large single beds pushed together with a king size sheet over them.

The restaurant was very modern and the food was amazing, only downside was service was a little bit slow but besides that everything was great!

The next morning for breakfast, we were greeted with a very helpful server who explained how the breakfast system worked. There was a massive range of foods available from fresh fruit to cereals to cooked breakfast.

We would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking to stay in a modern stylish hotel.",4,2017,07,19
223,Nice for a weekend stay,"We spent two nights at the Castleknock Hotel in a triple room and found it to be clean and roomy. The buffet breakfast was included in the stay and had a nice variety of foods to choose from. The dining area was large and full of light. 
Our only negatives were that the room was hot and stuffy even when we opened the windows and it would have been nice to have a fan to circulate the air. Also a small fridge would have been a plus. There is a nice pub (The Carpenter) and a Spar within walking distance. Overall it was a nice experience. ",4,2017,07,19
223,Stunning new restaurant area!,Visited for business meeting and very impressed with new breakfast/dining area. Really stylish new interior and cool bar! Food delicious and coffee lovely. Staff smartly dressed and pleasant. Will be back!,5,2017,07,13
223,Pleasant evening,"Had some bar food which was good..service was a bit slow. Menu could have more of a selection, but over all it was fine. Busy with families, so found it a bit noisy as its very open area. But it is ideal for families",3,2017,07,11
223,Mr,Food was good in lounge. New restaurant layout will be checking it out. Watch out for the seafood chowder very salty not to my liking. Staff in hotel most helpful and friendly. Refurbishing going on at the moment not to much disturbance to people not saying there.,4,2017,07,11
223,A fleeting visit,"Lovely location, with great facilities. Room was top-notch and very comfortable. Friendly staff. Would definitely stay again. Walking distance to Phoenix Park, not necessarily to City Centre though, depending on how spritely you are.",4,2017,07,11
223,Poor customer service,We arrived very early in the morning after travelling all night from London to attend a relatives funeral. Upon arrival we were very pleased to find that we could have our rooms to have a shower and get changed. We were waiting to be checked in so asked if we could have our breakfast as time was against us and family were collecting us early. I explained as I booked bed and breakfast we would not be around the following morning for breakfast so we would have ours this morning. We finished breakfast and returned to reception to collect our keys. The young girl gave us one of the keys for one of the rooms and before she gave us the second key she informed us that we would have to pay for the breakfast I told her we had booked b/b and would not be around the following morning as we were leaving at 6.45am so was having breakfast this morning.  After much arguing with the receptionist she told me I could not have my key until breakfast had been paid for she told me the breakfast was only for the morning after the night that we stayed. Can you believe this!!! By now I am really losing my temper and asked to speak to the manager who read  the situation very quickly after I told him that I have stayed in many hotels in Dublin and around the world and never have been spoken to by a hotel receptionist with such a ridiculous reason as to when I could have the breakfast I had already paid for. Later that same day after the funeral we came back to the hotel felt a bit peckish and ordered a sandwich decided to have a bottle of wine as by now we were relaxing I asked for a bottle of house white wine only to be told had to order from the wine list as there is no house wine so ordered a bottle asked if we could sample a drop before we ordered the waitress came over with a bottle with at least a third used poured out the wine It was really nice so she continued to pour the wine I thought this strange but tired and hungry we drank our wine ate our sandwich when  I called her over for our refill she brought out the same bottle I pointed out that when I ordered the wine I was ordering a bottle not a glass she told me she would get me a bottle but would have to take out 2 glasses of the wine I said fine do that. I have to say she didn't but all in all its not a cheap hotel by any measure but the service is quite below par so won't be rushing back anytime soon,2,2017,07,11
223,Not very superior!,"We arrived at 3.50pm expecting to check in to be told the room was not ready. Check in time is from 3pm. We were told 5 minutes later that they had found a room. We were happy that this was resolved until we got to the room! The view was as per below picture a waste area. I'm surprised that a 'superior' room would have this view! Recycling of bottles went on until @ least 1am! We had been out all evening and returned to get a drink @ the bar. The hygiene of the bar was appalling. There was dirty glasses, broken glasses and dish clothes all over the bar area. I don't think we would return. At the minute definitely not a four star hotel!",3,2017,07,09
223,Enjoyable good value stay,"Castleknock Hotel & Country Club lies in West Dublin. It is a fine hotel. Unfortunately at present, the leisure facilities are not in operation as they are under maintenance. After an initial mix-up at reception which in fairness was quickly sorted out, my fiancee and myself went up to our room. Wow is all I can say. It was lovely and relaxing with a very spacious bed, a bathroom area with a bath and shower. It is spacious to say the least. We also received a bottle of wine in the deal. Having something like Sky Sports is an excellent way to impress guests. 

The hotel is spacious and well laid out. We went for bar food later on which was excellent (curry and steak) and the breakfast the next morning was full of variety and very tasty. This is the way a hotel of this standards should treat their guests!

Altogether I enjoyed staying in the hotel. There is a golf course next door if you are interested but I kept away from it!",5,2017,07,05
223,Biggest bed ever...,"I came across this wonderful hotel and stayed for 2 nights this month. We checked in late enough and the the receptionist was very nice, underpressure typical the minute a couple of people arrive the phones start to ring üòÅ.
When we arrived to the room there was a wonderful welcome plate and note from the GM, lovely touch. It was a beautiful selection of fruit and was so nicely wrapped needless to say we ate every bit‚ù§. 
The bed was gigantic which was great and so comfy just what I needed. The room was immaculately clean, and came with personalised bottles of water, 1 sparkling & still which was replenished every day, robes, slippers and galaxy hot chocolate along with all the other normal amenities. ( not to mention 2 postcards, I bet the tourists love that, a really great marketing team here I'm sure of)
These days I just focus on the little touches an extra probably because I'm in the business 15 years now and it's these small things I look for and love.
The hotel is very corporate and I see why they spend money and have the place wonderful, candles everywhere and fresh flowers. 
The bar and lobby are very contemporary, we had some drinks both nights big beautiful gin glasses (another point gained on the o'grady scale) we didn't eat at night never had the opportunity. Breakfast was lovely hot buffet was really good, croissants, juices smoothies, could use labels for the jugs however to let you know which is which.
I did order poached eggs and the only thing that let this wonderful hotel down was the wait and the presentation. It came at the end of my breakfast I had to remind them and it was on a half cooked slice of toast, they were good though.
They are building an extension at the moment and I'm sure it is going to be amazing if the other part of the hotel is anything to go by. 
The final piece to this wonderful puzzle is the staff, every one of them in the corridors always said hello and were extremely pleasant so good to see especially the managers.",5,2017,07,05
223,Wedding ,"I attended a wedding here last night and stayed overnight .the hotel is beautiful and staff were very polite, helpful & friendly. Breakfast was plentiful and tasty and I'd love to go back for lunch or dinner some time soon  .",5,2017,07,01
223,Perfect Hotel for a wedding,Attended wedding here in June.Hottest day of the year Had a great time and stayed for one night. Everything went perfectly except breakfast staff were lets just say a little slow. I.E. Had to ask for coffee and tea when it should have been ready.. Otherwise brekkie was excellent. I would recommend this hotel.,5,2017,06,27
223,Spa experience ,"I got for my birthday a voucher at the Spa from my husband and my 2 boys last Friday. Was a nice experience and I really enjoyed it. The staff was professional but Mariana was just brilliant. Many thanks for that. Keep it up with the amazing job you are doing!

Regards,
Maria",5,2017,06,26
223,Best staff ever,"My husband and I recently had our first visit here. Yes, there is renovation but the staff manages
to keep it as hidden as possible. We never had construction noise interfere with our stay.
From the reception staff, housekeeping and waiters everyone is sincerely friendly and
attentive. Our favorite waiter was Olivier. He would ask what we had visited at the end
of our day and make suggestions for the next. Before our week stay had ended he
knew our favorite food and drinks and all but had them ready as we walked in! A real
professional and a lovely person.",5,2017,06,25
223,"Excellent stay, very friendly staff and good rooms and bar area","My first stay here and it was very good, very friendly staff.
Room had plenty of tea and coffee, loads of free shampoos and body washes which are a nice touch as many hotels have stopped these.
Bed was comfortable and the room very clean and spacious.
the breakfast was very good and I would recommend their monk fish curry if you eat in the restaurant, the prices for eating were very competitive for a high quality meal.
Now to my favourite part ... THE BAR :) a great selection of beers, ciders and spirits, the staff here were absolutely fantastic very helpful and friendly.
I highly recommend this hotel and will stay here again",5,2017,06,25
223,Nice hotel but lacking soul,"Went on a recommendation and stayed on a Sunday so whilst building work on going it was not an issue. Room very well appointed , bed fantastic and very comfortable . Whilst the food was good , the menu was limited. I would stay again but not more than one night.",4,2017,06,21
223,nice hotel but under renovation,"My husband and i stayed here recently, having stayed a few yrs ago we returned as we had found it to be a lovely hotel...However on arrival we seen there was construction work going on which had finished for the day so there was no noise from it...we checked in quick enough and overheard another customer giving out that there was no leisure facilities, we were not informed of this at check in and didnt seen anything on their web page to state same and were disappointed and knew then why we had god a gd deal on the room for the night...Our room was nice, clean, good selection of tv channels..Breakfast as busy in the am, lots of dirty tables around, we waited a good while for the tea and coffee..the staff seemed un organised and it was only 9 am...when i checked in they swiped my card and a different price came up on the card machine and i was only informed that it was a 30e security charge that i would get back on check out if we didnt charge anything to our room, when i questioned why the price was diff..it i hadnt asked i doubt they would have told me..i got it back on check out...",3,2017,06,18
223,Very professional and friendly reception staff!,"I must say the highlight of of my visit in the Castleknock Hotel was the help and friendliness of the reception staff,especially Rebecca! A very professional and polite young woman who went out of her way to make myself and my partners stay and very welcoming one. Would definitely return again :)",5,2017,06,18
223,Building site,"So here I am at castle knock, the hotel is under renovation which was not told to us upon booking. I got an early checkin upon arriving but I could just about hear the receptionist because of the drilling. At four o clock we said we would have a pint in the bar this was closed. The drilling continued for maybe an hour with wind flying through the reception area. Some of the the staff in the corridors were very unfriendly wouldn't even say hello. Breakfast the next morning was not great watery scrambled eggs and burnt crispy fried eggs. All very dried out looking the rest of it. The building works are going on for the rest by f the year so maybe avoid this place for a while. There is no pool or gym at the moment either. ",2,2017,06,16
223,Not a family friend hotel ,"As the title reads not a family friendly hotel, pool closed, rude slow staff and in particular management, overpriced food which was really poor quality. sad when a child's portion is more appealing than an adults main course.   Won't be a returning customer that's for sure ! ",1,2017,06,15
223,Work Stay,"I stayed here for 2 nights while at a training course with work. This is the first time I have stayed here with work. A nice hotel, spotless clean and friendly staff. Some building work going on but noting intrusive. Room was nice but very warm at night, not that comfortable I found. Food was good too but portions were on the small side which was a real shame. All other than that was very good. Will probably be back again with work in the coming months. Thank you ",4,2017,06,11
223,I do BBQ,"Castle knock hosted a lovely BBQ following our wedding. The venue was brill, we had the lime tree bar all to ourselves and guests, plus the weather arrived(sun in Ireland is not common) it was such a nice touch that the hotel left factor 30 out for the pale Irish skins that were sitting outside :) the provided the food, BBQ style. Worked out really well and everyone had tons, more than enough.

The hotel overall was brill, very nice layout. Was dissapointed that the pool was not available but we did know in advance. I guess they are upgrading the hotel which is a good sign. It didn't disturb our time here. The rooms were nice, however very very warm and had no heat control. We had to leave the windows open all night and were not cold at all.

All in all a really great experience and would definitely recommend as a place to come for lunch, dinner, event, or romantic break. :)",5,2017,06,11
223,Excellent hotel,Me and my girlfriend stayed here and I have to say it was really nice staff was welcoming and polite.the food was lovely 10/10.the only thing is it's ‚Ç¨20 in a cab to Dublin city centre.the room was really nice and very clean.if you looking for a relaxing time I would recommend staying here cause even tho is a bit out of town it's in a nice location and it's quiet ,5,2017,06,08
223,No Afternoon Tea for You!,"I wanted to have a lovely afternoon tea in the Blanchardstown area. After doing my homework, I settled on Castleknock Hotel. I double checked their website--available daily from 2-4 PM. The next afternoon I set off for my long awaited tea. 

The three people at the host stand asked me what kind of tea I wanted. I explained that I didn't want a cup of tea, I was there *for* afternoon tea. I was rudely informed that because I had not made a reservation with at least 24 hours notice, it would be impossible. I explained that their website did not require notice. They said it should. Then we four stood there, just staring at one another. I was disappointed,but hungry. I counted to 10 in my head. When they still did not speak I finally asked if it would be possible to have a meal. They still stared blankly. Any food at at all, I asked. At this, there was an exchange of looks amongst the three, then I was at last taken to a table.

I wish I could say this was the end of the weirdness, but it was just getting started. They were not busy, so I cannot blame the poor service on that. My waiter was pained to serve me. I ordered a salad. After I was done, he wanted to bring the check. I declined and said I wanted to see a dessert menu and have a cup of tea. He was crestfallen. It went on like this as I asked for more water. Another sulk in response. And more Twilight Zone behavior until I paid my bill and left. 

Let me mention that the salad was lovely and the dessert outstanding. I was quite happy with the food. But what is going on with the staff???

I try to have one afternoon tea per visit in Ireland. I find it soothes my soul and I have a chance to enjoy a time honored tradition in a country that prides itself on its welcoming attitude. I have never been treated so poorly as at this hotel. I have shared this experience with others who are not surprised---they, too, have been treated poorly at Castleknock. 

I never give a venue this kind of low rating, but it is 100% necessary. I don't want anyone else to have to endure this level of insult. I've had better service at McDonalds. 

I hope they clean up their act but I am likely to never know. I won't be returning and I will be sharing this review whenever I can. ",1,2017,06,07
223,Family golf tour,"Stayed at Castleknock on the last leg of a four day golf tour with my two brothers in law. Very friendly hotel with good rooms, food and service. In particular thanks to Dylan the barman who looked after us very well during the evening of our stay. He introduced us to a number of cocktails including ""Dylan's Ginger Mist"" - in truth just Irish Mist honey liquor with ice, but very enjoyable all the same. With a wonderful golf course just next door we left with happy memories and will be back!

223,Excellent Meal,Three of us had dinner here.  I was delighted to find such good quality food in a hotel.  The staff were incredible especially the very attentive and pleasant Andrew.  The hotel is a little distance out but well worth the trip in my opinion.  Highly recommend this,5,2017,06,01
223,Everything was perfect!,"I stayed here with my partner for 2 nights as a special birthday treat. It was only a 20 minute taxi ride from the airport which was great! We arrived very early and the reception staff allowed us to check in our bags so we could go into town and come back for a 3pm check in. All staff were extremely friendly and made us feel very welcome. We even had a special birthday platter waiting for us in our room!

The room was very bright and clean and the bed was just wonderful! The shower and bathroom was great too, couldn't fault anything! 

Breakfast was amazing, there was so much choice. Highly recommend the full English! We also had one evening meal at the hotel restaurant, the food was such a high quality and our waiter was just great! 

Unfortunately the spa was out of use due to refurbishment so we couldn't use the pool or Jacuzzi but the building work didn't disrupt any part of our stay and you could still get treatments! I treated myself to a Swedish massage and I can honestly say it was one of the best massages I have ever had! My masseuse was new (think her name was Marlena?) The treatment room was so relaxing, can't wait to go back!

Best part about the hotel is its location. Our taxi in was about 20 mins and cost 30Euro. We could of easily got a taxi into the city but opted for the local bus as it was only 3Euro and only a 10 min walk to the bus station from the reception. Be aware that you need EXACT change for the bus fare, they don't accept notes and don't give change.   

All in all I cannot fault this hotel and I cant wait to go back when the spa is up and running!!",5,2017,05,30
223,Business Trip,"At Castleknock Hotel for our digital two day conference , have to say the staff and service is great , a great to see Ireland performing so well , give us confidence to seek to the UK market . Will be back ",4,2017,05,24
223,Okay stay ,"After at the hotel and checked in it was steady and the staff were friendly. Went for a bra snack and a drink. Found the service slow. One of the party had order a sandwich, chips and tea. The tea arrived swiftly but the sandwich took 40 mins then 5 minutes later the chips arrived. The bedroom was clean and a good side. The mattress would need updated found it lumpy. Breakfast is served on a Sunday morning until 11. We went down at 1045 as we had been out the night before. A lot of the food had been well picked over. The cooked breakfast looked like it had been siting for hours, there was no danishes left and when we asked about the danish we were told we could purchases them at the cafe. ",3,2017,05,20
223,Good service and management,"We have stayed here a number of times in recent years having a family in Dublin and visiting. 
This stay was for four nights for us as a couple and accompanied two nights by two families. The hotel has been well refurbished and the rooms are well presented with tea making and all necessary requirements. 
We did have to change rooms for reasons of proximity to a noisy kitchen extractor, and poor lighting such that elderly eyes can't read with 40 watt lights. But management handled our problem impeccably and the new room was ideal, our luggage handled in our absence. The reading light was sufficient too. 
Breakfast set up has been changed for the better and the staff handled busy times at the weekend efficiently and quickly. 
The service and friendliness throughout was appreciated. We have returned before and will do so again!",5,2017,05,20
223,Smelling Bathroom and untidy room,"check-in is 3:00pm, we got the room was 3:30pm and room wasnt ready. The room service complaint about the counter very bad organize. We went out to go sightsee then came back by 11:00pm. However, the bathroom smelled really bad, like dead animals. Next morning we complain to reception. By the way, the breakfast charges latte, hot chocolate for more than 3 euro.",3,2017,05,10
223,"Beautifully located, excellent Hotel","We stayed over the Easter break for three nights. Upon arrival the check in service was speedy and swift, and we were in our rom within 5 minutes of arriving. Our room had a brilliant view of the golf course, and they had gone to an awful lot of effort for my husbands 40th, lots of treats in the room. We ate in the hotel two of the evenings in both of the restaurants, the food was spectacular in both venues. Nothing was any trouble for all the staff, the service was simply perfect. My favourite hotel in Ireland and I will definitely be returning.",5,2017,05,10
223,Afternoon Tea,"A group (four) of us recently celebrated a little occasion in the Castleknock Hotel & Country Club by indulging ourselves with afternoon tea, When we arrived we were met by a very courteous and friendly waiter who escorted us to our table. We each had a glass of Prosecco to start with followed by a sumptuous variety of scones and cakes.  Beautiful coffee was also served. It was a delightful afternoon, with great service and attention, a very relaxing way to spend an afternoon and meet up with friends. I can highly recommend it. Tom O'Brien, Dublin",5,2017,05,02
223,"Fantastic Hotel, Deserves its 4 Star Rating","One of the best Hotels I have ever stayed in.

You are made to feel welcome as soon as you check in.

Really good rooms, very clean and plenty of nice views.

All the staff were very welcoming throughout our stay.

Food in the restaurant was very good for dinner and breakfast.

I stayed in a 5 Star rated hotel in Malta last year, Castleknock Hotel is a 4 Star rated hotel, but makes the Hotel in Malta look like a 3 Star. 

I highly recommend Castleknock Hotel.",5,2017,05,01
223,Lunch,"Menu reasonably comprehensive, catering for most needs for an uncomplicated lunch...clear indicators for any dietary anomalies. Service quick and courteous. Nice setting. Prices mid range. Food arrived quickly, and have to say impressed my better half, a very fussy eater. Overall, recommended, and will be back.",4,2017,04,27
223,Very Nice stay,"This Hotel is out of Dublin a bit, but its what we wanted. We stayed here 8 days. We arrived at Castleknock about 9:30 am. check in was at 3:00pm, with a short wait, they were able to get us into a room. Very Happy as we were very tired. The hotel has a nice Breakfast, 2 restaurants and two bars.  When one bar closes the second one opens. The rooms were so quiet, the only thing we heard were some doors closing, no showers, no toilets and no people talking, we were amazed. We had a nice view of the golf course and pond. The shower is a little small, you had to stand just right not to hit your elbow on the shower door. We took the Train to Pearce almost daily.  The station is walkable from the hotel. At the entrance of the hotel, cross the street, there is a small gate, go through this gate and there is a nice walking path. You past Carpenter, walk through the round about and past the tulips then you are there. (we are walkers so a short walk for us). The only problem we had, and was not necessarily the Hotels fault: when we ordered a Taxi from the hotel one night to go to Strawberry Hall, (suppose to be down the hill), it cost us $17.00 going, we used Uber to come back and it cost us only $7.00. One other time it cost us $37.00 to go to the Heuston Station and again coming home, it was only $17.00.  Both times we ordered from the hotel.  Upon checkout I asked the hotel about this, they indicated that we needed to ask for the fastest route...We did not ask this on our return trips, apparently always got the fastest route, since the hotel ordered they probably should have asked? Lesson learned.",4,2017,04,26
223,"Business conference, would be a nice place to stay for a weekend break","Stayed here for a business conference, which was very enjoyable, thought this would be a good place to visit with family. Good restaurant and facilities, excellent rooms, very professional staff. Premises are well kept and is in a good location for exploring Dublin and the surrounding area.",4,2017,04,26
223,Bad night.,"Stayed recently. Staff nice on arrival..BUT failed to inform us that we would be at a disco ,well felt like it from the thumping noise from the floor .it would of been nice to be informed that there would be entertainment below.then I'm sure we could  make a decision either way not much satisfaction in the morning either only a small apology.As I had an early start due to a race   ..to say was annoyed understatement..",2,2017,04,24
223,Great hotel,"Have stayed at Castleknock many many times over the past 7 years and have always enjoyed it. Rooms are lovely with some offering great views over the golf course. Breakfast is buffet style with a great choice. Close to Phoenix Park, City Centre and Blanchardstown.",4,2017,04,23
223,Hotel Nice but expected more from the Spa treament,"We stayed for 2 nights in the hotel. The room was lovely and comfortable and staff were really nice and friendly. The only area that I felt let it down was when I went to get my spa treatment. When I first went up the receptionist was not at her desk (which is in the corridor at the top of the stairs and not in the where the treatments are) I went into the treatment area and waited for 10 minutes or so before leaving to go back to my room, as I was walking out the receptionist was there and told me I was nearly late for my treatment! When I went into the room, the therapist talked the whole way through my message which meant it wasn't very relaxing, the message felt rushed and didn't last the full allocated time. I would stay in the hotel again, I just wouldn't get a message or treatment",3,2017,04,20
223,Not a 4 star food,"We stayed here for 1 night during the Easter break. 2 adults, 1 child and toddler.
Our room was spacious for the 4 of us, there was a vile smell coming from the shower in the bathroom which I can only presume was sewage. 
There were no bottles of water provided to our room which I thought would be the norm as I notice them in rooms next door that being cleaned when we were leaving, the receptionist didn't know whether we should have got bottled water in our room or not!!!
We ate in the bar on the evening of our arrival, the monkfish curry was watery with a good portion of fish and very small portion of rice..2 glasses of Malbec cost ‚Ç¨19.20 if I had known that I would have ordered a bottle.
Breakfast was not 4 star quality, the bacon looked like it was steamed, it actually tasted and looked like gammon as it the slices were so thick. Mushrooms were in a bed of water..nothing had that crispy bite and tasted stodgy. 
The kids enjoyed the playroom which is well catered for all ages.
Staff are friendly and helpful.
Please get the food right as this is a place we regularly stay when we come to Dublin.",3,2017,04,20
223,Wonderful Easter Weekend Stay,"Excellent property and location, short distance from the airport and City centre. Checking in and out an absolute breeze, so easy plus the staff are just the most helpful and friendly you could wish for. Our family used two rooms, one a family room and the other a twin. Both rooms very clean and spacious with very good facilities. The breakfast menu is very substantial and caters for all tastes and was of very high quality food wise. Evening meals, again very good quality and whilst not a large menu offering there was always something for us all in our group. Sadly no time to play at the golf course adjacent to the hotel but for golfers the course looks fantastic and in wonderful condition.",4,2017,04,18
223,Good couple of nights stay for a wedding!,"Stopped for 2 night for a wedding. Check in and check out simple and easy found all staff to be helpful and polite. Rooms were good size and clean and comfortable. Had good facilities wifi, well stocked bar, spa (sister and mother used and had a good experience) also linked to a very good golf course which the staff were also very accommodating. Food from restaurant was good and coffee bar in day had good section of snacks and drinks. Definitely worth a stay.",4,2017,04,15
223,Great Property-Management not up to it,"This is an excellent property that is well in excess of its current management to operate it. Has a security system to access accommodation floors that is inoperative.
Required to have shower repaired and although wall fitting was repaired after obviously a long time they didn't think to get calcium build up out of the shower head so the water couldn't have spray pattern adjusted. Just slack housekeeping. Temperature of water was jambed. Lucky setting suited me.
My host booked a party of nine in the Restaurant and when we arrived the whole restaurant was booked out so we were relegated to a lobby area and eat off a bistro menu with NO financial compensation or appropriate service.
Couldn't book late check out past 1500 for any amount of money.
If in Dublin this is Faulty Towers!",3,2017,04,15
223,"Lovely hotel, great staff!",Organised a large group to stay in this hotel. Nothing was a problem. Extremely efficient and helpful. I also stayed in this hotel while attending the conference close by. Rooms are lovely and spacious. Beds are comfy. We had dinner there on one of the nights and the food was excellent. Quick check in and check out which is important when time is against one! Couldn'f fault it. All rooms recently redecorated. Excellent staff also. Very helpful!,5,2017,04,13
223,Great experience ,"Myself and my partner stayed here couple of weeks back and thoroughly enjoyed our 2 nights breakaway. From the moment we checked in until the moment we left we felt like royalty. We arrived early and to our amazement our room was ready which was a great start. After we quickly dropped our begs we headed to the foyer for a relaxing coffee. Was great to see an area designated for just a quite tea or coffee without the hustle and bustle of people eating around you.  We had food both nights in the hotel, We had food in the bar the 1st night and in the restaurant the 2nd night, Both meals were delicious and service was second to none. I have seen a couple of negative reviews here and I'm shocked purely on the basis of the weekend we had. We will definitely be back Castleknock.",5,2017,04,12
223,What a treat !,"My wife decided to book the Castleknock Hotel for our 10th anniversary. She really chose well! The hotel is big and spacious but still inviting. We had a dinner package and although only 30 euros, we enjoyed a sublime 3 course meal in their Park Restaurant. I don't know how they do it for 30 but what a meal!!
We didn't spend much time in the bar because the huge Lobby Lounge was so inviting. We had a few cocktails and craft gins before going to our room... and huge bed.
Breakfast was good, with a huge selection .
Checkout was pleasant and they even managed to make some great suggestions on outdoor activities to really make the most of the sun.",5,2017,04,12
223,"Nice hotel, nice stay, pool currently under renovation","Just stayed at the castleknock hotel for a conference. The hotel is bright and modern. My room was large with a gigantic and confortable bed (i have a superking bed at home and the bed felt even bigger). The decoration in the room was cosy and modern. The bathroom was clean and pleasant with separate shower and bath. I had a view of the golf course. The meeting room had also bright and had access to a balcony.
The restaurant's dinner food was nice but not astonishing. Portions were big. The soup and sandwiches lunch provided was just average.
Overall, it was a nice experience.
On the downside, the pool is closed for renovation and this was flagged to us in advance. I used the gym in the morning and it was ok although 1 of 2 treadmills was out of order. The hotel is on a golf course which provides nice view but there does not seem to be anywhere to walk about as casual walkers are prohibited on or around the course and the hotel is surrounded by narrow roads with little footpaths. 
Changing small little things such as the highly inneffective hairdryers in the room would make the experience even more enjoyable.
I would still recommend this hotel but would probably wait until the pool renovation are finished before i return for a leisure trip.

223,Poor service and disappointing,This hotel is in a perfect setting but unfortunately leaves a lot to be desired. The reception team had difficulty understanding English. We also had to pay for our room before they would give us the key. The room was in poor condition. There were large stains on the carpet and the shower was dirty. Service in the restaurant was poor and the food over priced for not very tasty dishes. I really don't think that we'll be back.,3,2017,04,09
223,Definitely worth a try,This hotel was just perfect for our needs while we visited family. Very easy to travel to as it was very close to the M50 Exit 3 and the hotel was very reasonably priced. Very close to the Phoenix Park and many other attractions and not too far from the City Centre. There is ample parking (no additional charge) and a golf course within the grounds. The hotel was spotless and the room was very spacious with a king sized . Tea and coffee making facilities were available in the room. There was a great selection available for breakfast although the quality of some of the hot food was average. The staff in general were very friendly and helpful. The only minor issue we had was when we checked in ‚Äì the receptionist firstly could not find our booking (prepaid through Expedia) and then wanted to charge us again (she didn‚Äôt appear to know what she was doing). Overall we had a very enjoyable stay. We would definitely stay here again.,5,2017,04,09
223,Awful staff and overpriced,"What a beautiful hotel!, when the tractors and drilling aren't about. My boyfriend and me booked the executive suite for a night away, which was overlooking a building sight and we could hear drilling at 8am which wasn't fun when we were so hungover after the lovely cocktails downstairs. The staff aswell,  headless chickens. Starving and ready for some dinner we went downstairs to be told by a young staff member that the building outside the hotel was affecting the kitchen gas so the food would be a few minutes, this was at 6pm... so it came to 6.15 and nobody had taken our order. I couldn't find the waiter so I went to the bar beside us as he was the only member of staff I could see. I asked how long the food would be as we where told a few minutes for it to get back and running. And he said ""I dunno could be ten mins could be an hour"" and walked off. Eventually at 6.30 a different waiter came from nowhere and took our order. We eventually got the starter at 6.45 which was just chicken wings. Supposed to be in BBQ sauce but tasted more like dolmio sauce with some chilli. The mains where yummy, very small portions. Nobody came near us and apologised and the empty drink glasses gathered on our table from the lack of staff so I cleaned it myself. Very expensive too. Don't think I would return again after paying 300 quid for one night with an average room and average meal.",2,2017,04,06
223,Just OK,"Stayed in October for a wedding. Our first time to Ireland and we were both looking forward to staying at this hotel (it was our splurge on accommodation for the trip) and booked very far in advance. 

We got checked into an accessible room that could hear each and every time someone came in and out the doors that led from the hallway to the elevators. Not only did the doors creak (an easy fix) but they slammed each time they closed.  The bathroom had no space to put anything (we could barely keep our toothbrushes in there) and there was no curtain around the shower. If you wanted to have a shower *everything* in a near vicinity would get wet ‚Äì including the towel you needed to dry yourself off with. 

We were staying for a few days, so asked to be moved. The reception staff advised there was no way we could move and that all guests had been checked in. Since we were part of a wedding group we knew that people had not arrived to the hotel yet. If there‚Äôs a logical reason that someone cannot help a guest, I am okay with this, but don‚Äôt lie to me. 

The stay as a whole was average ‚Äì not horrible, but not great either. 
",3,2017,04,03
223,"It doesnt feel like a hotel, more a home from home","I have stayed in this hotel many times while in Dublin on business and therefore when we were looking for a good hotel for a family visit (all adults) to Dublin it was the obvious choice.
The front desk staff process reservations with quiet efficiency and make you feel welcome from the very first Hello.
The rooms are all good quality with tea/coffee making facilities and free wifi throughout the hotel.
The bar food menu is varied and does have something for ll tastes and is not too expensive.
They also have a wide variety of beers ( draught and bottled ) plus a great selection of gins
The staff are keen to please and manage requests with a smile.
This is a great hotel and I would strongly recommend it for business and pleasure and when their new pool/spa facility opens it will be superb
Yes it is a bit out of the city centre but a 6 seater taxi only costs ‚Ç¨25 for a one way trip into the city which isn't bad for a major city",5,2017,04,03
223,Haggling over the room with the receptionist,"We had booked a Valentines getaway for a night in here, we live down the road so knew the hotel and the grounds already. Upon entry to the room I noticed that the receptionist had given us a room with view facing the entrance road although it was stated in the description of the valentines package, that we will get a  room with view over the golf course, further to that after we were relocated, the TV in the new room was old (not flat screen) type. I said it to the receptionist again that the room description says we will get LCD flat screen, she was very unpleasant about it and told me they have the same TV's in all the rooms, I said that's not true because in the previous room they had flat screen, she called someone to bring the TV from previous room over to us. After this I felt a bit awkward each time I had to pass the reception. Another downside is that they do a lot of classes in the pool area so at the time of our stay the pool was packed and we literally  had to queue up for Jacuzzi.",3,2017,04,03
223,Disappointed ,"Escaped for the one night with my partner, the hotel itself is fabulous! 

We went for food at the bar, it took about 40mins in between waiting for our starters and mains!
Service was very poor as we had to literally hop of the chair to order another drink and at that rate by the time we got the drinks our meals were done , food was just ok they ran out of my all time favourite sweet potatoes fries, not what I would of expected for this hotel!

223,Modern comfortable surrounding with good service,"The rooms are well appointed and comfortable. The hotel has a modern ambience and appears to be a busy spot. Bar, restaurant and breakfast area are very pleasant and the service is excellent. Late night residence bar felt also comfortable - nobody rushed you to get out which was pleasant.",4,2017,03,29
223,Valentine's weekend ,"Stayed here over the Valentine's weekend with 2 other couples for a dinner and massages.we had dinner the first night in the restaurant witch was excellent and afterwards we headed to the lobby to have some drinks.we where all asked for id and room numbers by a manger and one of the bar staff witch was fine as we were in our early 20s,but after each drink order we had to show our ids each and every time we ordered a drink now the only problem with this I had was it was the same barman who served all of us so I thought he would of remembered us but no he clearly didn't and there were other couples of the same age sitting in the lobby and where never asked to show Id every time and after about the 3/4 drink the manger that served us the first time demanded all of our room numbers witch was strange as we already gave them from there on then the bar staff were very rude towards us so we decided to just go to our rooms.while the rooms were great and massages were fantastic the way we were treated in the bar on our first night was disappointing and I would have gave the hotel 5 stars if it wasn't for poor service on the first n",4,2017,03,26
223,Good 4 star,"Stayed here for just one night but would return for longer stay in the future. 

All staff were extremely courtious and efficient. The executive rooms are well appointed but disappointed not to see it showing some signs of aging and lack of maintenance.

Food was of an excellent standard with a wide range of drinks available at the bar. One point was the lack of atmosphere in the public areas, it felt quite cold and could be easily rectified to make this good hotel into a great hotel.",4,2017,03,25
223,Great hotel,"My boyfriend and I recently spent 2 nights at this beautiful hotel. From the entrance I knew it is worth every penny-the lobby looks great, with small coffee shop and great intimate atmosphere. Check-in was great and quick (there was a small problem because I couldn't get into the room,two of the keys didn't work and I had to go back at the reception but it was promptly sorted out). The room itself was gorgeous, the bed was huge,complimentary huge bottles of still and sparkling water-well done- and teas coffees and suprisingly,hot chocolates sachets were there as well. I asked if there is a mini fridge in a room on facebook and lovely Gary replied and requested it for us. I didn't hope it will be there but it was,big enough and not noisy fridge was waiting for us. It was busy those two nights,there was good few people around but we didn't hear any single noise both nights and we were delighted with that. We had a breakfast aswell, pretty good with exceptional staff-the girl who was serving coffees and teas didn't stop smiling,and that was both mornings,we were seriously impressed. Great location,near park and shopping centre. We left a sign for room cleaning and went to the centre but I realised I forgot my phone and we went straight back,20 minutes after leaving and the room was already cleaned. At the check out I dealt with lovely guy whose name is David if I remember well,and I have to say he was brilliant,so natural and relaxed,he really made.me smile. All those small things  left us with great, great impression so we had to book another night and we're coming back in two weeks (and we are only locals ;) and I hope we'll have great time again and that we'll be lucky to get a room with a view this time :)",5,2017,03,24
223,Break away,"Friendly staff ......room was lovely but very very long walk down two long corridors to our room and we were not offered assistance with our bags.. ...room was clean and spacious bathroom has bath and separate shower ..couldn't close one of the windows ..receptionist said she would send someone to fix it but on our return to the room it was still open so was obviously broken but an extra heater had been placed in the room however the heat was not the issue but the noise as our room was over the bin area and sure enough 6.15 the bin lorry arrived !!!! Beds were very comfortable 
Dinner was good as was the breakfast 
Overall a lovely experience",4,2017,03,21
223,Great Hotel,Stayed here while on business and found the hotel to be fantastic. Great leisure facilities and a great big room. The breakfast in the morning is also went do very well. Only reason not 5 star as check in took longer than I would expect as male receptionist couldn't find my name. In fairness I checked in quite late and he may have been security rather than reception.,4,2017,03,19
223,Great Hotel,Stayed here for two nights for a business event and found the staff very helpful and polite. The food was excellent with a great menu. Rooms are fantastic with all the amenities. Wifi is free throughout the hotel. Will definitely be back.,5,2017,03,19
223,A great stay again,Second time staying here. We stayed in an executive room with views of the golf course. Our room was again perfect with a super king sized bed and a pillow menu. Bathroom was bright and spacious with a bath and separate shower. The only let down I had with the hotel previously was the food. I didn't have dinner there but the breakfast has come a long way since my last stay. The staff too where pleasant and professional as always and the decor is a right up my street. Will stay again and hopefully will see if the dinner is up to par. ,4,2017,03,18
223,Nice hotel,"Stayed here last night in an executive room. Check in was quick and the reception staff are very friendly. The room itself was comfortable, a king size bed. Our room had a lovely view over the golf course and lakes. 
Dinner in bar was nice and quick service. We had the burger and the burrito. I would recommend both. 
Only downsides, the heat could have come on earlier in the day and I had to ask for capsules for the coffee machine in the room
I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a getaway break",4,2017,03,14
223,A lovely stay,"I'd heard of this hotel many times before but never had the occasion to say. I was very pleasantly surprised. The hotel is lovely, staff was very friendly, breakfast was very tasty and the room rate was very reasonable. I enjoyed my stay and I will be back with my kids for a city break and visit to the zoo as it's equally suitable for children.",5,2017,03,13
223,Sunday Lunch,"Visited with my husband and chose the carvery. My husband's lunch was perfectly satisfactory. Unfortunately, I found a hair in my food which was very off putting. Spoke with Agustin who was extremely professional. He quickly apologised and did not charge my lunch to our bill.  He also gave us complimentary tea and coffee. He is invaluable to the hotel with his smooth manner ans excellent customer service skills. Thanks to Agustin we will be back. ",3,2017,03,12
223,Possibly the best hotel in Ireland,"I have stayed here several times on business and each time my stay has been without fault.

The rooms, the reception, the restaurant, the breakfast, All of it is first class.

Plenty of parking too.

If you want a base to explore Dublin then this is probably not for you as it is a little too far out. But if you are exploring by car ot want a little luxury then this hotel is perfect.",5,2017,03,12
223,Afternoon tea ,"My daughter brought myself and mother for afternoon tea. We were treatment like royalty. Offered free tea and coffee while we waited in foyer as we were a little early. Table in beautiful dining room overlooking the golf course. Sandwiches and cakes delicious and very different, made with difficult breads - white, brown, fennel and tomatoe. Changed salmon to chicken without any problem. Waitress lovely. Wonderful and special experience.",5,2017,03,10
223,Pat,"Easy to get to, secure parking big car park. 
Very good for families with pool and play ground. Food very good but a little expensive.  Golf course nearby. Rooms were a bit warm for young children. I would strongly recommend if you like visiting the Zoo or just the phenoix park. Very easy to gain access to city from here. I used it as a based to visit the Boyne valley and the wicklow mountains.",4,2017,03,08
223,Lovely hotel!,"We stayed at Castleknock Hotel for one night whilst we were visiting Dublin. The hotel is located about 25 minutes from Dublin city centre which was perfect for us. The room was spacious, clean and comfortable. We chose to stay in the hotel for dinner that night. While dinner was lovely, the service was fairly slow. The waiter was apologetic though and we were not in a hurry. We also had a buffet breakfast the following morning which had plenty of choice and was excellent. We would stay here again if we were visiting Dublin and would recommend this hotel to anyone else visiting the area.",4,2017,03,06
223,Sunday Lunch! Avoid it... 5th March 2017,"My first visit to Castleknock Hotel for Sunday Lunch will be my last. Apart from one very attentive waiter who almost forced himself upon us to choose something to drink as we were trying to find out whether or not we were going to stay... the experience was 100% 1 star.

The person who appeared to be a manager pushed two tables together in what looked like a bar area and as we sat down handed menus that were literally sandwiches, two salad options, and two soups. When we asked if there was a lunch menu he reluctantly brought what he called a Carvery Menu... okay, the idea that it was a menu was based on large text filling the page with limited options... we even had to ask where was the Carvery. He had ZERO interest in us...

So, prepared to make the most of it we went to the Carvery area and found the hot counter shoved into a corner with nobody around... it looked like a canteen self-service in a factory.

The options were rather dried up looking fish, dried up chicken, an empty hot meat counter, and then the usual overcooked vegetables... eventually a chef came along... who had to take off covers and clingfilm so as to serve (at 1:30pm) She proceeded to open a warming oven and grabbed a lump of meat with a large fork and literally dumped it under the warming lamp!

We ordered pork chops which were not exactly juicy but were at least not dried up... We had to stop the chef piling vegetables on to our plates... and when asked if there was dairy in some of the sauces the answer given was that they were gluten free... it took three attempts to get the answer...

One of our party had soup which they declared to be very good... Another chose the deep fried shrimp sandwich... which appeared to have been thrown together... and suffered the fate of prawns cooked for too long... and may have been sitting there before it got to us as it arrived late... which considering how few were actually eating in the hotel it made no sense to any of us.

It was really hard to understand what was really going on... It really appeared that there is no effort made... all the more evidenced by what appeared to be the left over jugs of juice from breakfast which tasted like watered down Miwadi!

I'm not sure who they cater for, but it is far from a quality experience and one that I will definitely ensure that friends know about before making the trek over... We overheard several people who had obviously taken time to get there say ""We'll have to make the most of it"" as we tried to do!

and this is an aside... but the overwhelming wafts of some sort of room scent really doesn't add to the experience of people who are hoping to eat... It made one of our party feel rather ill. Added to this... dried up Kalanchoes on the table as a floral arrangement for a hotel really does set the tone... But, to be fair, we were treated to their friendly familiar florist come around with a trolley of plants to replace the dried up ones... in the middle of our meal... This place is a serious JOKE!",1,2017,03,05
223,Excellent hotel with super service,"After returning from a hectic weekend in Galway we arrived here with help of our Nav App. An outstanding hotel, all staff from reception to  breakfast table were polite, friendly and so professional. It was also so peacefull, beautifull and picturesque that we wowed to return.",5,2017,03,05
223,Angiebaby 17,"Just had a lovely meal in the Avenue Bar which was made 5 star by the exceptional service of Olivier. Friendly, professional and not ""over the top"". He made the evening!!
The food was well presented, tasty and a varied menu which catered for all tastes topped off with great service supervised by attentive managers
",4,2017,03,03
223,Special celebration,We visited the Castleknock Hotel to celebrate my mothers 80th birthday with afternoon tea for a group of her friends and relatives. From the moment we arrived the service was first class.  The birthday girl is gluten intolerant and the hotel laid on a special afternoon tea for her with suitable foods (we had arranged this in advance with the hotel).  At no pint did we feel that we were rushed or under any pressure to leave.  I had eaten in the hotel previously and was very impressed.  Glad to say this experience only added to my impression of a very well run hotel that goes the extra mile to look after its clients.,5,2017,03,02
223,wedding guest,"Stayed in executive room? no robes, slippers, toiletries that were advertised, no bottled water just tap water in containers. Breakfast was substandard nobody at the counter to check food which  was lukewarm, any hotel i have stayed in i saw chef/staff check constantly. Was told room rate was wedding guest rate but in hindsight it was more expensive than any booking site i checked. Next day food we were served was disgraceful, burgers served to children and adults were raw and extremely overpriced would not recommend eating there.",1,2017,02,28
223,Peaceful,"My husband booked a night away for us before I was due to return to work. Hotel is modern, spacious, and staff were very friendly and efficient. Room was lovely and bathroom was v clean with separate shower to bath which is nice. We had a snack in the bar before heading to blanch to shop. The soup was gorgeous. Blanch is only about 5/10mins away via car. Breakfast was lovely with a great selection. Kids play area just outside the main bar area. Also liked the idea that the lime tree bar was for adult company only. 
The one letdown was their pool wasn't opened and won't be until end of year due to a refurb. We weren't aware of this when booking. üòî",4,2017,02,27
223,Excellent Hotel,"Before Christmas my wife & I attended a wedding function and stayed overnight. Christmas weddings are beautiful and the Castleknock hotel had a warm festive feeling with all the decorations & large tree in the foyer. The reception venue/room was also delightfully decorated in a festive theme. A great night was had by all. The wedding meal was lovely and service was good. Service staff were polite and efficient. 
Our room was fine - nothing exceptional - what you'd expect. However no space between twin beds. Breakfast was good - no complaints there. Overall this is a lovely hotel and I would certainly recommend to other potential visitors. One issue however is that the bar staff did not provide a ""cash back"" service to patrons.Other than that everything was satisfactory.",5,2017,02,22
223,Nice for weddings but be careful,"I recently visited the castleknock hotel for the wedding of two friends and I stayed in the hotel the night of the wedding.

The first thing to say is that both the ceremony and the meal were beautifully hosted by the hotel and the day was indeed very special. 

We arrived on the day at about half one and because we were early we enquired about leaving our bags at reception and waiting at the bar till we could check in. We were really pleasantly surprised to be told that our room was ready and we could check in straight away if we wished. This was great for us as we still had to get ready for the wedding so it gave us some extra time.

The room itself was nice and spacious with two double beds and a table and chairs. There was also a decent sized iron and an actual ironing board provided in the room which is rare!  There were the standard tea and coffee making facilities but our room had no teaspoons when we arrived so we had to go looking for some. 
We were also pleased to see that the bathroom had a large bath and a separate shower which was great because I prefer a shower to a bath while my partner is the opposite. 

 As we were part of a wedding party we were given a discounted rate on the room. After discount we still paid ‚Ç¨110 for the room which still seemed a bit pricey but we wanted to stay the night of the wedding so we didn't mind paying it. It was only after checking in that we got talking to other people who had paid much less for their room than we had. Now I usually do look around for the cheapest room rates but you would assume that a special wedding discount would be on a par with what other websites can offer the room for. 

Some other friends who were staying for three nights chose to upgrade their room for extra money but they were really disappointed with the room. The only extras we could see was a nespresso machine and a larger television. Their room was actually smaller than ours and only had two single beds while ours had two doubles. There also weren't any bathrobes in room even though there was a sign for the them. I really would not recommend taking up the offer to upgrade. (Also our friends who were actually getting married booked the honeymoon suite for three nights and while the hotel did provide a selection of fruit on arrival they didn't provide a complimentary bottle of prosseco or champaign which was a little surprising.

In terms of the wedding reception I can't fault the quality of the food. It was simply delicious and it was served very efficiently.  We were less impressed with the breakfast and food in the restaurant the next day but it wasn't terrible. The only big niggle I have with the reception room is the layout. It's in a U shape almost with the stage and dancefloor  around a corner and obstructed for a lot of the room. There was a band booked at the wedding and some of the tables couldn't see them at all. Also the bar was right beside the stage and dance floor which was a little awkward. We ended up going to the main bar outside to get cocktails. (BTW the Amaretto Sour was divine). Also the bar can be pricey.  Luckily I took full advantage of the free wine at the wedding dinner!

You can still have a great wedding at this hotel but the function room layout might be a little unusual for some and I would double check the room rates before booking under the wedding 'discount' rate.  If you're planning on staying here just as a regular guest just be aware it is difficult to get to this hotel and there's not really a lot to see around the area. If you're coming to see  Dublin I would advise staying in the city centre but if you're coming for relaxation this is a good place. 

P.s this is the best smelling hotel I've ever been to! It's like they pipe a subtle mist of Yankee candle 'wedding day' around the entire building.

223,Complete Luxury,"Our daughter booked us in for an overnight stay with dinner & breakfast as we got married in this hotel almost 9 years ago. I loved the hotel then and still love it.
The staff are so friendly and cant do enough for you.
the room was fab and the bed was HUGE and so comfy. everything you could need is in the room nespresso machine toiletries tv is a smart tv with access to netflix.
Food in the park restaurant was delicious and the staff in there were so nice. 
we also enjoyed the music in the lobby. Breakfast was lovely wide range of options.",5,2017,02,20
223,Dublin break,"A four night break at castleknock hotel, the hotel is clean and tidy and the staff are welcoming and can't do enough for you, we arrived early in the morning and were invited for complimentary breakfast, we only ate breakfast in the hotel which was great, a great selection and although help yourself style was piping hot. 

The entertainment was not our cup of tea, would have been nice to have something a little more traditional for Ireland, however there seemed to be a lot of Irish staying here so maybe not what they want!? 

The rooms were spacious and had all the amenities that we required, we didn't visit the spa as we spent most of our time in Dublin, the taxi to Dublin was about ‚Ç¨25 one way so was a little pricey to go back and forth, we didn't look into alternative travel but would if we decided to return. All in all a competitively priced hotel for what we received not sure how competitive it is when you take into consideration the taxis? 

",4,2017,02,19
223,Good business hotel ,"Attended a meeting here. Good facilities for business and good service. Bedroom was comfortable and well equipped however shower didn't work. Breakfast was good, lunch was excellent and service throughout was very good. The bar area is too open and clinical and the hotel would benefit from a more cosy and intimate bar. 
That said, overall experience was good!",4,2017,02,17
223,Enjoyable stay will return,"Really enjoyed my stay in this hotel for valentines weekend. Fast check in. large clean room. massive comfortable bed.. wasn't feeling the best so had dinner in the hotel that night, very attentive staff and nice food. Breakfast is suitable for people with gulten issues...1st time I had seen a gulten free section clearly signed a breakfast station
location wise was perfect. short drive to train station for heading to croke park. will use again  if attending a concert or sporting event in croke park",5,2017,02,14
223,Not as I would expect from a four star Hotel,"I booked a  Night away prior to valentines night been on a Tuesday I checked in and went to our room left our bags in as our dinner booking was for 8.30 pm we went to the rest restaurant and were met by a nice friendly blonde girl . 

She brought us to our table and got us seated and gave us the Menu not a Great selection to choose from the  portions was very small i was expecting more ! Service was very slow from ordering our starters to leaving took two hours and we did not delay in eating bit of a let down . 
 
We had a drink in the Bar and retired to our room to find the Heating not working I went to reception and they sent a small heater up to the room !  In all not a Great treat for me or my wife ",3,2017,02,10
223,Relaxing,"Booked  two nights on bed ,breakfast and dinner package while visiting friends in the area.Our stay was excellent .We booked a superior double room which was very comfortable.Excellent choice for breakfast and also noticed that they now have an area set aside for gluten free customers for breakfast including it own toaster.This to me is the first time I have seen this in any hotel, however it need to be more out in the open for customers to see.Good selection on the dinner menu and all food was cooked to our taste. All service was friendly and was nice to be recognised by Andrew who greeted us ,while seating in the bar area. Well done  See you all soon again.",5,2017,02,09
223,RE: Great hospitality. ,"I stated in the Castleknock Hotel in Feb 2017. I was in Dublin for an interview so I had additional requests such as a late check out, room service etc. The staff were really helpful and courteous. The rooms were comfortable, spacious and clean and the food was good. They have a spa on the premises which I didn't have time to avail of on this occasion. I would have no hesitation recommending this hotel and I would stay here again if I am in this part of Dublin. ",5,2017,02,09
223,"Second time, great stay","We were visiting relatives in the area again and this time we had a 2 night stay. We stayed in the superior double and were thoroughly satisfied. Our room was very comfortable, with tea and coffee facilties, comfortable bed and it was immaculately clean throughout. Breakfast was fresh and filling, kudos to the waiting staff who handled us politely despite being very busy! 
We will be back again in the future.  Thank you again Castleknock hotel! ",5,2017,02,06
223,Very disappointed ,Went for lunch today with friends and we were so disappointed. Couldn't eat in the lobby like we used to be able to. The waiters English was very poor and I had trouble explaining to him what I wanted as he couldn't understand. The food took ages to arrive and when it did it was not nice at all. I got married in this hotel a few years ago and it's just gone downhill to be honest. Very disappointing. ,2,2017,02,04
223,Super Long Weekend Break,"Stayed with the family for my sons 18th birthday; we had 2 rooms. Great amenities and facilities; beautiful spot; comfortable beds; good food and bar. A lovely atmosphere. Our breakfasts were included and there was a tasty range of choice to eat. The wine selections was good: however, I didn't like the 'frizzante' and prefer a good prosecco to drink.",4,2017,02,03
223,Well worth a few nights stay.,"Stayed here for a couple of nights for my cousins wedding, such a beautiful place, the staff are very attentive to your needs.  We stayed in an executive room, definitely worth the extra money.  Breakfast in bed due to long day and plenty of drinks !!  Only downside for me was the swimming pool was closed and the hotel management failed to notify us.  ",4,2017,01,30
223,Great place to stay ,"Great hotel, very good food. Nothing was too much trouble for any member of staff. Dinner in the restaurant on Saturday night was fabulous. The only small fault the bedroom door very hard to open, possibly due to the new carpet. Would definitely  recommend this hotel and will be back!! ",5,2017,01,29
223,Great January conference with work,I spent two nights here in January for my company conference and it was a great experience. The conference rooms are great with natural light. The food quality is really good and the staff are really friendly. The rooms are clean and quite and large. Very good experience! ,5,2017,01,28
223,We got great value,"We checked in on a Friday evening which was quick and efficient. Room was warm, clean and modern. It had under floor heating in the bathroom which was a nice touch, and slippers and robes. Bed was huge but appeared to be a spring mattress. 

We had a three course meal included in our package. We both got soup for starters which was served with some bread rolls. For mains we got a trio of pork and pumpkin ravioli. They were ok. They both had a lot going on; lots of different flavors and textures. It was too much for us but someone else may like it. For dessert I ordered a mouse. It came served in a glass with sorbet on top and lots of nuts. By time I had got to the mouse I had enough. Service was great. Staff were pleasant and attentive. 

We then had some drinks in the reception area where there was some easy listening acoustic music. 

Don't miss the fresh pastries at breakfast!

Bed, dinner and breakfast only 65‚Ç¨ each. ",4,2017,01,28
223,Very average .If a bit grotty.,"had lunch here with a very large family group. It was a set lunch ,but food was fairly good and service reasonably quick . Overall its a bit of a dull place ,having said that there are a lot of repairs in hand at the moment. Plenty of car parking space .",3,2017,01,27
223,Staff,Great service staff are wonderful.tonic spa treatments very reasonable priced.would recommend this hotal to my friends n family only 20 mins from blanchardstown shopping mall.breakfast was lovely great choice of everything.will visit this hotal again ,5,2017,01,21
223,"Wow, Wow, Wow!!","I visited this hotel with my 3 children. We had never visited Dublin before and also wanted some relaxation time. This hotel was perfect! The staff were amazing and the the breakfast and dinner were exceptionally good. I loved the candle lamps which lined the atrium walkways and the atmosphere in the communal areas was very warm and welcoming. The rooms were good but the TVs were not up to much. 
We used the pool 3 days running and loved it. So tranquil and relaxing. Lovely outlook across the countryside. We really enjoyed our time here and will definately return.",5,2017,01,20
223,Shop until you drop!,"We stayed here quite recently and enjoyed our stay as we were quite active and sed the stay to eat out in the llcal area but also benefitted from the close proximity to Blanchardstown which is shopping heaven.
This time however, we had a very lazy stay, possibly making up for a busy Christmas and subsequently I found the location quite boring. This of course was our own responsibility having not organised any specific activity.
However I would advise residents, if they are staying in the hotel, to avail of the bar menu as we thoroughly the food there.
Breakfast was nice but was not the most extensive. Restaurant were also a bit obvious in their desire to clear the breakfast items away as the clock approached the 11 am deadline.
Bar staff were pleasant and keen to converse. The receptionist who booked us in was very nice and pleasant but the other reception staff were cool and unconcerned about our departure.
The bedroom was comfortable and provided all that we  needed. Chambermaid staff were very good and providing addional items was no bother.
Overall we had a good stay but it was also a bit impersonal. Alcohol was quite pricey compared ro other establishments.",4,2017,01,17
223,Tired!,Stayed here in the family room . Room was  quite small and cramped  for a family room but tidy but is in need for a serious update as the decor is outdated and tired. Not in line with a proper 4 star hotel. Breakfast is average. I did not think it was value for money for the price I paid! ,3,2017,01,17
223,Great Hotel!,"Stayed here on my first trip to Ireland and it was a great experience!  The room was very nice, clean and comfortable.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  The bar and restaurant were also very good.  We have drinks and food several times here during our stay.  I would absolutely recommend this hotel and hope to stay here again in the future!",5,2017,01,16
223,Another Great stay here,Having had our wedding and staying here before - as we really enjoyed the hotel in the past and we were attending another wedding nearby so we decided to stay at his hotel again. Unfortunately on this occasion we didn‚Äôt use the spa/pool facilities or eat in the restaurant however we did order room service at 2am and this was prompt and delicious. The staff in particular Alex on reception was very helpful and welcoming.  He accommodated us as we needed to check in early due to the wedding we attended nearby.  The room was spotless clean and spacious and the bed was very comfortable. The breakfast was plentiful and delicious.  We will definitely return again.,4,2017,01,12
223,I would recommend,"We went for bar food on two occasions in the past and we thought it was delicious, so we decided to book the hotel for a night last night. We got a good deal for B&B. We found the room very nice. The bedroom was unusually cold around the window. Might be to do with drafts getting in. However we don't like a stiflingly hot room anyway, so no major problem. The bed was huge. Perfect for my wife and I who like our space. The bar area is spacious and modern. The staff are very attentive. The breakfast is very good. Lots of food on offer. Nice hot fry up food and good selection of fruit, scones etc. Overall we found the hotel very nice, and would return again",5,2017,01,10
223,All Good,"Go for it!
Myself and my wife stayed here for 1 night. Room was very good with heated tiles in the bathroom which was nice. Reception staff were helpful and parking was good. The hotel is a taxi ride away from any other pubs/nightlife and the taxi's are expensive. An enjoyable stay.",4,2017,01,08
223,Christmas Party ,"Stayed here for one night only in December to attend our job Christmas Party.
We arrived early on a Saturday afternoon and were greeted at reception by very friendly staff who had plenty of time to explain things about hotel such as the use of the pool and leisure area. 
We went straight up to our rooms which were good size warm and spotless also beds are very comfortable. 
As we were hungry we headed down to bar area to order food, two of us got the chicken wings which were done in a tomato sauce and really not to my liking as I really like to stick to the hot sauce but maybe others would prefer them, the others with us got chicken raps and they to were not impressed with their food but again the staff at the bar were brilliant and very quick with serving. 
As we were there for our company Christmas party we later met in function room for dinner which was also attended by a number of other companies so as you can imagine there were a couple of hundred people seated for dinner, I won't go on to long about the evening but I will say that the dinner and service was a disaster in every way from the starter which was duck and tasteless and the main which was traditional Christmas dinner which was also not very nice and service was all over the place with food like potatoes been served twenty minutes after main was eaten. 
So rant over we settled in and had a great evening before heading to room for a great sleep and to wake Sunday morning to a lovely buffet breakfast back to room for rest and then finish of morning with a lovely swim and relax in jacuzzi before we had to head. 
So all in all its a lovely hotel to stay in to relax and staff are friendly and polite so I would recommend this hotel.",4,2017,01,08
223,rooms were cold,rooms were cold and heating didnt heat room well. breakfast was included in rate and this was adequate. bed was large and shower was good. parking available. staff friendly. many people were here for christmas eve parties.,4,2017,01,05
223,Everything a hotel should be.,"Spent only an overnight,  but one could tell from the moment one entered the lobby that this is what a hotel should be.. Warm, welcoming, with a 'feel good'  ambience about the place.  My wife and I were hosting a birthday dinner for 13 adults and six children. The dinner was served by very efficient and polite staff, obviously well trained.  The food was excellent too.  The room was very comfortable with a huge king bed and a view of the golf course. The only thing that I, personally,  didn't particularly fancy was the buffet style breakfast.  A bit chaotic (these occasions generally are, especially on morning 1, it's the toasters that do it.)  The menu was extensive and my wife, who is coeliac, had a good range of food to choose from.  By the way, I was the only one of the group that mentioned the breakfast set up.  All our dinner guests concurred that it was a great night and a lovely overnight and the children thoroughly enjoyed themselves.",5,2017,01,04
223,City break,"Myself and my wife stayed here while on a quick city break ..great location close to city, blanchardstown  center and Phoenix park.beautiful clean hotel with bright spacious rooms.didnt dine in the hotel but breakfast was tasty and plentiful.we will be back",5,2017,01,04
223,"Good experience, but..","At a two day wedding event here. I have to say that my personal experience was very good. It's a great location. The room set up for the wedding ceremony was beautiful, the wedding dinner room was very impressive and a manager was present throughout, overseeing everything. Food for me was very good, tasty and piping hot. The staff that I interacted with were friendly and gave good service. 
The above is my direct experience - but many others, including the main wedding party, commented very negatively on their experience with cold food, disinterested bar staff and dangerously undercooked burgers (served on the second day) and the comments were so strong, I feel the need to make mention of it. 
I'm sure this hotel dealt professionally with complaints received - but my own direct experience was good. ",4,2017,01,01
223,Have always liked this hotel but!!!!,Stayed here for one night on Dec.27th on a B&B plus dinner inclusive package which was text to me as a special offer for ‚Ç¨138 per couple. Having stayed here before on a few occasions and really enjoyed the hotel we decided to avail of the offer. Still lovely hotel but a few negatives this time. In the restaurant we were given the package dinner menu and were surprised to see a lot of supplements on various starters and mains! And then what made it worse if we wanted veg or potato  with it we had to pay an extra ‚Ç¨3.50 each per side!  And dinner would have been very small if we didn't get them. Such a pity as food was lovely! Come on if you include a meal in your special offers don't try and make more money on it! And just to end don't know if we were just unfortunate but we couldn't have a shower next morning as something wrong with thermostats in shower and couldn't regulate it and any time we sat or moved on bed the two lamps were flashing on and off! Reported problems with room to reception on checking out and they made note of it. Still like this hotel but need to improve certain things mentioned.,3,2016,12,31
223,Afternoon Tea ,"As I'm coeliac i found it very hard when looking to book afternoon tea  to cater for both myself and my Mam without it being more expensive or an inconvenience. I cannot give the castleknock hotel enough credit, the spread they put on yesterday for my Mam and I was amazing. They didn't make me feel I was an inconvenience for being coeliac. Thank you to Niamh for helping me organise it, she was so helpful. I had a great day and will be back again. ",5,2016,12,31
223,Avoid the food!,"My husband and I stayed overnight for a wedding that took place here. The food was definitely nowhere near a 4 star standard and both of us were hugely unimpressed by it. Having thought maybe it was a once off we ordered breakfast to the room for the following morning but again, hugely failed to impress. The room was nice. But I just felt that for the cost of the stay it was not worth it whatsoever. I wouldn't recommend. ",2,2016,12,30
223,Nice hotel BUT,"The hotel itself is a lovely place. Rooms are very nice also and have everything you need. 

I've been here twice now. This time was a two night stay for a wedding. The last time was four years ago but the same problems persist. 

The service is so slow it's ridiculous! The thoughts of going to the bar to get a drink was just a nightmare! It was worst this time around as we where at a wedding and the staff could not have been slower if they tried! Ended up having to leave the function room to go to the main bar which wasnt much better! Oh and be prepared to dig deep as they like to charge top dollar for drinks too! 

The pool area is nice and well kept! Bit on the small side but i do believe it is being renovated shortly. 

Breakfast is average! But the Q at breakfast is a disaster! One toaster machine that holds up the hold Q and only toasts on one side but you just give up snd take it as you feel sorry for those behind you! 

Staff are slow to restock the buffet too! 

Pleasant hotel to be in as decor is great, prices are too high especially with the service issues! Staff look miserable! Probably under paid! ",2,2016,12,30
223,Lovely hotel,"This is my third time staying here, (2 weddings and a birthday party). It is a lovely hotel with good facilities.

The pool area is nice and I believe it is going to be extended next year.

I enjoyed my stay here, however, the service in the bar is VERY slow (and has been on each and every visit). This needs to improve.",4,2016,12,28
223,Wedding night disappointment ,"Well last night we stayed here after a fantastic wedding party in another local venue which didn't provide accommodation so we booked castleknock hotel. We were so excited about staying in this 4 star hotel that I've heard so much good about. 
The hotel and rooms are stunning. But the room was like a fridge. It was after 1am and we were exhausted. The taught of having to call reception and have someone come to our room on our wedding night was not very appealing so we just put the breakfast order on the door for room service and went to bed. Then 6am someone is banging on the door. Nobody there when I opened it. 9:30am room service arrives with the breakfast. All I can say is I wouldn't give it to a dog. Not to mention I was asked for ‚Ç¨6 by the waiter for room service. Which I wouldn't have minded if it was made clear to me at time of checking in. 

So cheers Castleknock hotel for ending our wedding night with a bang. ",3,2016,12,24
223,"Quiet location, nice room, great breakfast, and ample parking.","Not easiest place to find. However, worth the five minutes extra it took to get here. On arrival, met by genuinely most helpful staff. Lovely room, great breakfast and ample parking on site. Will definitely be back here. Bed and breakfast rate was best in a few weeks in Dublin.",4,2016,12,20
223,Most polite and professional staff ever!,"I stayed in the hotel for 2 nights recently. I was there for the course that was taking place in the hotel. I cannot name one thing that would not be as I would expect it. The room was very spacious, elegant and spotless - I was very impressed with the level of cleaning! The room also had everything I could possibly need. 
Breakfast and dinner were very good and the food was fresh. 
I also used the gym and it had all the modern equipment you need for the training. 
I have to say, I was mostly impressed with the personnel. Every single staff member I passed on the corridor or spoke to in the bar or restaurant etc. was extremely polite, positive, professional and helpful. And I mean everyone - the reception staff, cleaners, restaurant staff and floor staff. I can't recall any other place, where the whole team would be of such good manners - there's always one or two people, that are not the nicest to deal with. 
Even the way the room was cleaned during the day was very respectful and I didn't feel my privacy was invaded. I will be staying in the hotel in January again and I can't wait!",5,2016,12,18
223,Great stay,"We stayed here in December and Alex on reception is as usual the star of this hotel. He sorted out a great room to suit our needs & is so friendly, professional & helpful. Treasure him CHCC he's one of your greatest assets.
We ate in the Restaurant & the Christmas menu is lovely and tasty & you can see why this Restaurant has won another award this year, although I will dispute with the chef that the Panna Cotta is a Mousse & we'll have to agree to differ in what we consider a Panna Cotta, but this is meant as a bit of light-hearted bit of banter as whatever it's named it's absolutely gorgeous. 
We were so disappointed to discover one of our favourite parts of the Hotel is closing for 12 months for a rebuild in January, namely the leisure centre & this is a large part of our choosing a hotel to stay at so we are going to struggle over the next 12 months to find a Hotel as great as this to stay in when we go to Dublin, but we will return in the future when the rebuild is finished.",4,2016,12,16
223,Bliss,"LOVED this hotel. As soon as we walked in to the scent of fresh flowers and coffee we just knew it would be an enjoyable stay. Everywhere is spotless,  the beds were so comfortable and the choice at breakfast was second to none. Not one single staff member passed us without a friendly greeting and as a customer service nut this sealed the deal for me that this was going to a regular haunt for us. 10 out of 10 from us.",5,2016,12,15
223,Classic elegance,"This was my second stay at Castleknock Hotel & Country club, and my first very positive impression was even exceeded. Very classic comfortable elegant hotel, with excellent service by their staff, made my stay here a real pleasure. My warmest recommndations!",5,2016,12,07
223,Lost luggage review from sept 30th!,"Hi Ben,

I am the other Bride that was caught up in your lost luggage the night of your wedding!

Your wife's little suitcase was left in my suite the night before my wedding.. I didn't notice it as I was rushing around for rehearsal dinner- but I did get a call at 4.30am ( 3 hours before I was getting up for my own wedding on Saturday!) by the lovely porter who had tracked down your bag.
Very unfortunate incident but thankfully for you your wife's bag was in safe! Imagine if it had been ruffled through!
Hope you had an amazing wedding.. we can chalk it up to a wedding tale!

In other reviews - the staff at the hotel are lovely but the breakfast is absolutely awful.
Convenient handy hotel and it looks nice but pity they can't sort out the food!",3,2016,12,02
223,excellent events service!,"I am happy to say that we had an absolutely perfect day on November 19th for a family party.  
 
The room looked just beautiful: I loved the table layout and the settings.  Simon and his team were hugely helpful through the set up and in terms of running the event: we had everything we needed and the event did not feel in any way rushed, though we were a little late sitting down as there was an accident on the road to the hotel and some guests were delayed arriving.
 
Every member of the waiting staff was helpful, attentive and cheerful; the welcome was warm and the food was notably excellent; everyone commented on how good the food was.  The banqueting menu had a wide range of options and it was easy to accommodate a few children and vegetarians too.
 
We found the overall cost very reasonable for the quality of everything provided, and I would not hesitate to use the Hotel again for a similar gathering.  I want to thank the events team especially for all their help in putting the event together ‚Äì it was such a great success.",5,2016,11,29
223,Grandson's Christning Dinner,"My first time visiting this very impressive Hotel & certainly I'm already looking forward to my next visit. 
We had a family meal today Sunday nov 27th for my grandsons christning.
From start to finish it was faultless.  The food was out of this world, I would safely say the best I have eaten in years anywhere.  Staff, service, friendliness to lots of young children was never a problem. 
Take a bow, I was highly impressed and definitely will be back ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ",5,2016,11,27
223,Amazing!! ,"Just had our first wedding anniversary dinner here last night after marrying there last November and it was just as amazing as it was last year. 
When we arrived the staff were so nice and showed us our table. 
They looked after us really well, without hovering around. 
Food was, as usual, exceptional!! 
Every course was just so delicious that I ended up eating 6 or7 things I normally don't like!! 
We love this hotel, all their staff and it has a special place in our hearts because it was our wedding venue.. 
I always recommend this hotel to people looking for a friendly, relaxed hotel with great spa facilities and food that is to die for. 
Well done to all the staff, managers, chefs, and events coordinator Lorraine! 
",5,2016,11,24
223,Fantastic hotel,"I had a recent stay in Dublin on a shopping break and stayed at my favourite hotel, The Castleknock Hotel and Country Club, and as usual everything was perfect. On check in we met the manager on duty Stephen, who remembered us from our previous visits, he is a fantastic, charming, professional young man, and is great at giving suggestions on things to do. As usual, food was great and the bar staff lovely and friendly.",5,2016,11,21
223,Nice spot... can be a little better,"This place is nice but a couple of tweaks could make it really good for families. 
We checked in quickly and with no fuss. We stayed as a family of 4. The room was clean and warm (it was a very cold night). There is no a/c only old school radiators. There was two double beds which isn't a problem as our two are only 4 and 6. 
We went down stairs and told we couldn't sit in the bar (at 7pm) unless we were eating. They way it was put to us wasn't very welcoming but she wasn't there to win anyone over with her smile that's for sure. Ok so we sat in the lobby which was busy but fun watching the style of the wedding party going in and out for cigarettes. 

We decided we would go up and order room service which didn't have much on it for kids but we got a mixed platter that we were told in the lobby by sulky face we could order from their menu (tasted really good and more than enough for two people)with extra chips which was a good job because the food was spicy. 
Maybe a thought to something for kids to get for room service. They would have been happy with sausage rolls or something. The overall price of the room service is very expensive. 

In the morning we had a lovely breakfast. Loads to choose from and very fresh except the croissants were over cooked Coffee was good too. 
The leisure centre needs a tiny bit of love. The locks are broken on a lot of the doors. The pool and changing room were very clean but the changing rooms were freezing and the towels were tiny. They must know this as there was a baby changing table on the pool deck wherein was a lot warmer.  It's a very peaceful place and the kids loved it. Great steam room too. 
The next night friends joined us for the night and we sat in the lobby while the kids played and no one seemed bothered by them running about. 

The coffee dock is a fantastic touch and great flavoured coffees and brownies. Maybe again drinks for kids would be profitable as there were a lot around. 

The staff didn't really communicate with us so I can't say anyone was exceptional except for housekeeping. They were very friendly. Asking us if our room was cleaned to our liking and it was. 

I would suggest something for kids on the room service menu (movie night special??). More to channels on the TV for parents who have to go to bed early!! 
One place we were in gave younger kids crayons and a few printed pages of the areas in the hotel made fun which was handy and meant the kids knew where things were. 
There is only two free plug sockets in the bedroom which was a pain as we have so many devices. Wifi was good. 
Better table service in the lobby for us lot not allowed in the bar. 
There is a landing area on the 1st floor that was empty the whole time we were there. Maybe consider running cartoons on the TV there when you have a lot of kids staying? It would keep them quiet while the parents enjoyed a (expensive) drink. 
More channels on the TVs in the rooms. 
Heating in the pool changing rooms. 
A sign pointing to reception as it's very tucked away or move it nearer the door and families could sit in that area away from the bar.
All these are just suggestions as this place does have more to give. We would like to return someday and I would recommend this hotel. ",4,2016,11,21
223,Beautiful place to stay,"Great food, day Spa was amazing, and afternoon tea was an absolute highlight.Dinner was stylishly presented and delicous.
Two bar men were in great mood and looked after us.
Andrew (F&B) manager, ensured we were having a nice time.

We will be back.",5,2016,11,20
223,Great stay!,"We booked this hotel last minute to do some Christmas shopping. I have to say we got a really good price for our family bed and breakfast so I wasn't expecting it to be of such a high standard. The room was beautifully decorated and very clean , breakfast the next morning has a great variety of food too suit all palates. We used the swimming pool which again was immaculately clean. Definitely would make a return visit. ",4,2016,11,16
223,Amazing wedding venue,"We honestly do not know how to thank all the management and staff at Castleknock, not just for our incredible day but our incredible weekend! We got married on 22 October 2016 and had our reception at the hotel. As we had a huge number of guests travelling, we needed a venue that was close to the city without being right in the city. Castleknock fitted our every requirement we had. From our initial meeting until leaving the Monday after the wedding, we were treated with nothing but kindness and professionalism. Lorraine and her team do an amazing job! The reservations team (Valarie and her colleagues) deserve special mention, they had so many queries and changes and everything was dealt with smoothly and efficiently - nothing was too much hassle for them! Since the day, all anyone can talk about is the food and the professionalism of all the staff on the day! The food was INCREDIBLE! Every member of staff knew our names and made us feel like the hotel was a home from home. We couldn't have asked for more. Thank you sincerely to you all. We couldn't have done it without you. I would highly highly recommend Castleknock to any prospective Bride or Groom - you won't be disappointed!",5,2016,11,16
223,Raspberry and tomato soup......,"Raspberry and tomato soup for pudding......it's to die for.
Had an absolutly amazing meal in The Park restaurant.  
The meal was absolutly faultless...each course a masterpiece on a plate.  Compliments to chef and his team.  
Lovely ambiance in the room and the serving staff are there when you need them.  
Any one looking at the raspberry and tomato soup on the dessert list...it's
a miltitude of tastebud explosions.   Best thing I've ever tasted. Can't stop telling people about it.",5,2016,11,15
223,Ideal location,"This was my fourth visit to this lovely  'home from home'. Set at the side of a golf course with water features and excellent walks and within easy reach of Dublin city. This hotel has just about everything most types of traveller could wish for, Spa, Gym, Swimming etc. The rooms are roomy, pun intended, and comfortable with good facilities and soundproofing. Good food, great craic, friendly and helpful staff. Good public transport to city child friendly play facilities and Family rooms too.- what more could a happy wanderer wish for? Enjoy!",5,2016,11,14
223,not so great,"I am atm in the castleknock hotel and it is not much better than crown plaza that I was in 3 months ago. Food is not so good, and everything I tried from the menu, gave me cramps in the stomach. Nice spacious room, but not much special. I still havent seen golf course, so I hope this will bring it up a bit. Pool and sauna is like public pool/spa. Breakfast not much, if you like something other than English breakfast. Service is good though.",3,2016,11,14
223,A Lovely Retreat,"Castleknock is a great hotel with exceptional rooms (we had a suite). The staff were excellent, friendly, efficient and welcoming. The rooms were very clean and well maintained. A couple of very minor things, the rooms seemed to have no way of changing the temperature so we ended up having to have windows opened as we like a slightly lower temperature. The TV's in our rooms had a slight fuzziness to the picture, despite pointing this out to two separate people, it wasn't addressed and the breakfast was average. 
But the overall stay was excellent, the Spa Tonic was great. I had a massage with Amanda and she was superb. The gym was very good and the pool was lovely. I'd definitely recommend it. ",4,2016,11,13
223,Poor Customer Service & Worst Breakfast experienced,"We have stayed in this hotel several times in the past and always enjoyed our stay.  However on this occasion both the food and customer service seriously left it down.

The reception staff made errors on our bill and failed to locate us when our room was ready for check in as promised.  
There was total confusion over our payment and when queried, the response was unsatisfactory and the reception staff appeared to have a poor understanding.

Breakfast was unsatisfactory and certainly the poorest hotel breakfast we have experienced.  No kitchen staff in attendance.  The cooked breakfast was cold, very little choice and of poor quality.

When we discussed our issues later with the staff, we received little or no acknowledgement.  At no point did a Manager appear to be in attendance or try to assist.  

Overall a very disappointing experience for what used to be a great hotel.",2,2016,11,10
223,Fabulous ,Stay here for one night must say was very happy with room was big enough and clean . Staff were lovely. One down side would not recommend room service as charged 6 euro extra so even though food was lovely it work out expensive so next time I will walked to bar to get myself. Must say breakfast was excluded and was fab eat as much as you want and I recommend the pan cake maker so cool even for us older kids. Lovely area loads of parking and very nice rooms well worth the money.,4,2016,11,10
223,Great Nights Stay,"This is a lovely hotel with great facilities
We stayed over after a wedding and was really a great way to finish our day
We got a great deal through trip advisor at the last minute as we only decided to stay over the day before
A very modern & comfortable Hotel to stay",5,2016,11,10
223,Loved everything,From check in by a very pleasant and efficient Receptionist to departure by an equally pleasant and efficient Receptionist could not fault anything. Room was spotless and very comfortable. We had dinner in the Bar. Thought the menu selection was a bit limited. However when the food arrived it was very well presented and absolutely delicious. The waiting Staff were really friendly and attentive. There was a pianist playing and singing. Breakfast was buffet. Again food was superb. Thank you so much for a very enjoyable stay.,5,2016,11,05
223,Good Place to stay near Dublin,"This is a very good hotel to stay in if you are on a driving visit to Dublin or the  surrounding area, though we found we needed a good Sat Nav to cover the last couple of miles.It is situated close to the main ring road - the M 50. excellent free parking facilities.
We visited the hotel at one of the peak weekends of the year - Halloween and a bank holiday. Although it was crowded at times, the staff dealt with the needs of all guests efficiently.
At all times the staff were polite, friendly and helpful. I will review the evening meals separately but found them to be very good.
The room was a good size and was very clean. Tea/coffee facilities were provided and the wifi worked well. It was quite warm but we noted that a fan was provided. I know its environmentally unfriendly but opening the window solved the problem.
I was very pleased with the breakfast. a nice selection of hot and cold items. The locally sourced bacon was thick, had little fat and was delicious. Plenty of fruit, cereals and breads.  
We used the pool, sauna and steam room.  All were in good condition and it was nice to see a life guard in attendance.
We did not use the golfing or spa facilities but they looked excellent.
Overall a well priced hotel on the outskirts of Dublin and I would be happy to recommend it and return again.",4,2016,11,05
223,What's gone wrong?,"Absolutely love this hotel and have stayed here on at least 10 occasions; but what has happened too the house keeping and maintenance of the rooms; I can only assume on this occasion it being booked through 'kayak' I was given sub standard room because of the room discount?

",4,2016,11,03
223,R,"Was actually October 2015 we visited we had been twice before and enjoyed it. This time the food wasn't as good, breakfast was poor and not a lot of choice. Pool, lounge area and on site golf course were good.
Rooms clean enough and staff friendly, feel lounge furniture and area could do with refurbish and 5 minute drive away additional restaurant and bars for variety. Also castleknock village near and 15 minutes away from Dublin. ",3,2016,11,02
223,Our wedding weekend 28/10/16,"From start to finish of our wedding weekend we were treated like royalty. Our wedding reception looked amazing we had a winter wonderland theme. It was perfect and go glamorous. Food was delicious also and every course came out at the the exact same time. All our guests raved about the food especially the salmon. Staff were great on the day always on hand to make sure nobody wanted for anything.
They were even on hand to help me out of the car with my dress when the bridesmaids got lost (at the bar).
The second day we had a BBQ the function was set up lovely some props from the previous day were left for us which we weren't expecting but we're delighted about everyone raved about the food again burgers and salads were gorgeous. From start to finish a fantastic weekend one we will never forget thanks so much xxx",5,2016,11,01
223,The worst food I have had in a long time,"We went for an early evening meal at the restaurant of this very nice hotel. I had just had a treatment in the wonderful spa of which I am a regular customer. It was amazing how awful the food was, except for the starters, which were passable, the three main courses were all terrible just tcan'tunderstand how they could get it so wrong.Chips raw, chicken dry, hamburger the worst, all an awful experience. THE SERVICE WAS EXCELLENT THE WAITER HANDLED OUR COMPLAINT VERY WELL.",1,2016,10,31
223,Lovely and relaxed!,Just back from a 1 night stay with my husband and our 2 year old. We stayed in the Suite which was perfect for putting our little man to bed early. The hotel is lovely and it was very busy during our stay. The room itself was really nice. It could do with a small patch up here and there on the walls but that's being picky! I would say the room overlooked the car park so a small bit of noise with taxis coming and going at night. Hotel doors opening and closing was a bit loud as well but besides that you couldn't hear any other noise and it was very busy. The breakfast had a large great choice. Staff were friendly during our stay. Overall lovely and would recommend!,4,2016,10,30
223,So noisy cannot sleep,I'm writing this review at 12.48am and the noise outside the room is unbelievable. I'm staying in a family room and no one can sleep. I've called reception and he has apologised for the wedding downstairs! When I booked no one told me there would be a wedding taking place below my room. It's just not good enough. I stay here during the year on business and will not be back after this.,1,2016,10,29
223,Such a poor service,"We were 4 adults and 5 young kids for dinner at the bar. In morning staff failed to take booking properly. In the end we got all seated ok and after 20 min staff asked us to change table. We ordered quickly but didnt see any food before an hour! And even later it took ages again to get ... ice creams for the kids. What a poor experience! Food was just ok. Each time we stood and asked for our food we had tons of ""apologies it's coming in 2 min"", but it's not what you're looking for on a Sat evening with young kids!",2,2016,10,29
223,Extremely disappointed At all aspects ,"My aunt and mother were gifted a night here with a hot stone massage. 
Please let me go through all the individual issues that carried on from beginning of their stay until they left.

1. There were thread bare towels with holes. How is this acceptable in a 4* hotel
2. The bathroom was extremely hot with no way of controlling it. Even with radiator switched off the room was unbearably hot. 
3. The lunch which my mother had chicken Ceasar was a plate with a huge amount of lettuce leaves that were barely chopped, she was told she couldn't have a small portion but what did come out was more leaves than anything else. For the price this was poor
4. After lunch, there was a spa treatment included in the package- hot stone massage for 30mins p/p. After this, they went to the relaxation area and Amanda came in to ask what type of package they had. My mother explained that they had a gift of the above mentioned and from this point the spa contacted the hotel regarding the package as they said the massage wasn't included with the stay. Nobody seemed to know what was included and there was no communication between spa and hotel, making it very awkward and stressful. My mother then had to call the person who gifted this to find out when he had paid as there was no record. He had already paid ( or so he thought) but then had to pay over the phone again! He was assured his card would be refunded if it was charged twice. This is just pure lack of organisation and communication between the spa and hotel
Nobody was willing to deal with this problem and was passed back and forth for a good half hour. This was supposed to be a relaxing day/night for both and was the complete opposite.
5. They then went into the bar for dinner. It was very quiet but the waiter was on top of them the whole time and this made dinner very uncomfortable. 
6. Both found it very difficult to sleep as the room was unbearably hot.
7. They were told breakfast is between 7-10am, they arrived at 9.55am to an unfriendly welcome. They were made feel a burden even though if they showed up at 9.59am this is still within the time stated. 
8. The dead flowers on the breakfast tables were a disgrace in dirty water probably there for days
9. They then decided to get their nails done. My mams nails were nice but my aunts was called an express manicure which she had after waiting 20mins after the time she had booked. She was unhappy with the first application of the shellac and returned for correction. Katie informed her that pushing back the cuticles wasn't included. I have seen the nails and I've seen 3 weeks of growth with less gap at the cuticle, very poor. 
10. On checking out, they were not asked how their stay was or if everything was OK. Also, when approaching the reception, Tara and her colleague were not very professional in their manner as my aunt and mam approached them. 

Overall, their experience was extremely disappointing and almost upsetting at times. If there had been only one issue, no complaint would have been made, however, a lot of problems arose from a one night stay. 
The hotel itself was quiet therefore these issues could have been easily avoided.
They have both stayed there before and has good experiences so do not understand what has happened. ",1,2016,10,27
223,Could have been bettter,"This hotel is a beautiful big hotel, staff were professional and it had adequate parking and facilities.  It was just a shame that the bathroom had a strong smell of sewage, I addressed this with reception they said it could be block up from the shower they would have it looked at.  Breakfast was disappointing.  Just pity two things let down what was otherwise a really good experience.  ",3,2016,10,26
223,"beautiful hotel and spa, great food and nice staff",i stayed here before for my sisters wedding and had a great time. Food was excellent and the staff were lovely. i recently went back for a spa treatment and afternoon tea. The spa was out of this world. the rooms were tranquil and beautiful and my massage left me feeling ultra relaxed. Afterward my and my sister had the prosecco afternoon tea. Was gorgeous but bring your appetite. We could barely get through half of the food which was all delicious.  Was a lovely day out and would recommend it as a nice treat to yourself.,5,2016,10,20
223,Incredibly Helpful Staff,"My sister had her wedding there last week and I can't say enough about the staff. 
I'm a coeliac and consequently the only coeliac at the weddin . The staff made every effort to cater for me and even made sure that I didn't miss out on a dessert

The waiting staff on the night were incredible and made sure to check if the bride and groom were happy at all times. 

The only thing that I would have an issue about was the price of soft drinks at ‚Ç¨3 was way too much and was dissapointed by this particularly because I wasn't drinking and felt like I had spent as much had I actually been drinking. 

that being said, the staff, accomodation and all were brilliant :)",5,2016,10,20
223,Short but enjoyable stay,"Our ferry from Holyhead was delayed by 7 hours so we arrived quite late at the hotel which was a shame as we had been looking forward to a leisurely evening and a decent meal in the restaurant.

That said, check in was swift, the room was excellent and a couple of hours in the bar after a long drive / day was very pleasant. Having been away from Europe for 12 years to finally savour a proper pint of Guinness was luxury itself.

Slept like a log in a very comfortable bed before heading down for the best breakfast I have had in a long while. Sausages, bacon, eggs, fried potatoes, mushrooms, toast may sound to some like lard on a plate but I think the arteries got away with this one. The food wasn't oily at all  and was all prepared the way I like it.

Sadly we had to head away to a wedding on the west Coast as quickly as we had arrived but I can certainly say we would stay there again and hopefully for longer.",5,2016,10,19
223,What a wonderful Oasis!,"Only a one night stay ~ a family engagement on Sunday. Very tired family arrived into a rose~perfumed lobby.. really classy touch! Very friendly & efficient check in staff..   Didn't avail of facilities that evening as had drinks with family in their home.  Seemed to be numerous celebratory bookings in the hotel that night which made me a little uneasy ~ party hotels do not facilitate a restful night..
However, once we got to our serene rooms, doors shut on rest of world and we frankly 'disappeared' into our beds; so glad we'd booked a late check out.. 
Our Family occasion, in the Hotel Dining Room on Sunday afternoon; was an exquisite meal; attention to detail remarkable: exciting interesting menu : ~ Bravo! 
 Merci! 
We will most DEFINITELY be back when not pressed for time ~ to properly enjoy this tremendous hotel.. Thanks for the Roses!!  üíê",4,2016,10,15
223,Total Scam,"I rang the Castleknock Hotel about six months before the needed dates to stay.  I was told that they would not take bookings directly and that I had to go through the hostess to book for a wedding.  I did that and was the FIRST to request three rooms.  So, we booked  the three rooms  for three people for the wedding that was to be a two night stay.  When we arrived we were told that we were obliged to pay 200 EURO per room extra each night for a dinner which we did not intend to have.  This was the first we had heard of this arrangement as we were having dinner out each night.  When we objected, the staff continually placed the blame firmly on BOOKING.COM.  Now, had we been warned in advance we could have easily changed plans however, there was not an ounce of consideration shown as to our dilemma.  When we were finally given our rooms, I had the delight of being place directly above where the rubbish was taken out - a extremely untidy area and not exactly the choicest of views.   The rooms were extremely pedestrian.  At 6am to 7am I had the delight of listening to the rubbish being dumped just below my window.  I would never recommend this hotel to anyone.  The cost of the dinner on top of the cost of the room is a total scam and the whole experience left a thoroughly sour taste in my mouth.  The Castleknock Hotel ruined what should have been an idyllic stay.  Our total bill was nearly ‚Ç¨2,000 for two nights and three people.  This hotel should be ashamed of itself and reimburse everyone who suffered this monetary insult last weekend.",1,2016,10,15
223,Will definitely be back.,"From the moment we arrived, until the moment we left Castleknock Hotel, we felt relaxed and at home. 
Very friendly and accommodating staff, delicious food and enjoyable entertainment in the bar ticked all the boxes.  
The hotel is spacious and modern, beds were extremely comfortable, and location was good for shopping and city centre also. 
There were two dining options for dinner, we went for The Avenue option and couldn't fault it.
I'm already looking forward to staying here again for the breakfast alone! 
Blanchardstown shopping centre is close by with plenty to do including cinema and various restaurants. 
We didn't get to visit the spa on this occasion, but will look forward to trying it on our next visit.

223,Back after a long time away for a friends wedding,"Myself and the other half were back for a wedding, (disclaimer I used to work in this hotel a few years ago). 

Upon arrival we were taken care of fantastically, nothing was to much for the team. 

It was lovely to see the place looking so well and to see all the improvements and extensions completed.

A very big thank you to all the gang especially to Rachel, Elena, Mick on the bar, Micheal on night reception, Luke, Andrew on night porter, Andrew Sherlock for welcoming us back with open arms and for making my friends wedding day so very special.

It really did feel like a return home seeing all the friendly familiar faces. 
If I missed anyone give my apologies and regards to them. 

You should be very proud and thrilled with your team there Guy Thomson, they are doing a fantastic job!

All the best Sorcha",5,2016,10,14
223,So enjoyable and excellent value,"I have stayed in Castleknock Hotel & Country Club on two occasions this year , one for business and one for pleasure . I couldn't praise it highly enough from every angle .
Location , on the edge of the City , is perfect for the peace and quiet but yet close enough to the action if that's what you want .
Food was excellent especially in the Restaurant with a varied menu beautifully prepared and presented . The atmosphere in the Bar throughout the evening was really lovely and the staff could not have been nicer .
In fact on one occasion one staff member went beyond the call of duty and helped to solve a business problem I had which saved me a lot of time having to travel into the city .
I have read some recently posted reviews which give a negative opinion of the hotel and I have to say that my experience was polar opposite as was a number of delegates who stayed with me .When i read these I felt it was only right to redress the comments.
I would have no hesitation in recommending Castleknock Hotel & Country Club to anyone interested in visiting our beautiful City

223,Excelent total great value,"Stayed there last weekend had a wonderful  time. From the time of booking nothing was too much trouble. Im a light sleeper and my request for a quiet room was met with no problems. My bedroom was lovely, the rooms are newly decorated to a really high standard. We ate here both nights, one night in the bar and the second in the restaurant. Both meals where just beautiful. The Staff could not do enough for you. The hotel itself is on beautiful grounds with views of the lake and golf course on arrival. The pool was warm and very relaxing, really we cant praise this hotel enough.  I read some of the views on this site prior to staying and all I can say is take them with a pinch of salt.  The hotel is the Irish football teams Base and I see it was the AA hotel of the year and it is well deserved.",5,2016,10,13
223,Rip off,"Unfortunately I can completely corroborate the many other TERRIBLE customer experiences relayed here. 

This is an exceptionally ugly and charmless hotel- the interior design is best described as motorway service station meets American horror film. 

The rooms are stuffy and the beds are uncomfortable. The food is canteen standard. 

But worst of all is the attitude of the staff who seem utterly unaware that they work in the services industry! 

They have no interest in making your stay comfortable or pleasant- their only aim seems to be to bill your credit card for as much as they can possibly get away with (and more). 

We were effectively tricked into paying 330 EUROS PER NIGHT which you might assume would include a coffee at breakfast? Oh no! That will be extra! And if you fancy a dip in the pool, you will need to purchase a swimming cap! 

These farce-like extra costs speak volumes- the management know guests will only be conned into staying here once so they take their sole chance to rip you off, knowing that there's no chance you'll be back. 

With the abundance of places to stay in Dublin, save your money and stay somewhere else!",1,2016,10,12
223,Delicious Lunch,"So a group of us,retired teachers meet every six weeks or so for lunch.Today we met for lunch in restaurant in Castleknock Hotel and Country Club. I had organic smoke salmon on salad and brown guinness bread.It was without exaggeration simply scrumptious ..the portion of salmon was huge....and succulent. The service was excellent.....we sat down for lunch at 1pm and honestly didn't look at our watches until someone said ...gosh it's 5pm. We're all living locally and of course chatted with other local guests who had popped in for tea and chat.A very enjoyable afternoon entirely.We will be returning for a repeat lunch on 29th November with extra numbers. ",5,2016,10,11
223,Avoid - unpleasant hotel and ripped off by staff,"I stayed here with a large group for a nearby wedding and the experience was not to be recommended. The hotel has an eerie feel, with hundreds of identical, quite ugly rooms coming off long corridors, and poor views from the windows. The beds are not comfortable and the food is average.

Moreover, a number of our group were overcharged significantly for their rooms because staff refused to remove costs for the very expensive dinner even though they would not be eating there.

Even at the stated rate it is poor value, but this experience meant that it was a monumental rip-off at c. ‚Ç¨300 per night per person.",1,2016,10,11
223,Lovely hotel just outside of Dublin!,Brilliant hotel on the outskirts of Dublin! Great service from the staff and they are very helpful with any questions you have. The rooms are clean and modern and the bed is amazing! The shower is a perfect temperature and free toiletries are included in the bathroom. The room is spacious and has everything that you would need. The food on the avenue bar and restaurant is tasty and of high quality. I would recommend the steak which was delicious. The breakfast is again of high quality and there is a lot of choice. We didn't get round to using the swimming pool and spa but it looked lovely from the outside. The hotel is about 40 minutes away from the city centre. You have to get on the 37 which is a 5 minuite walk from the hotel. The buses come often however do remember to have change because they don't take notes! Something we didn't realise at first. All in all it was a lovely hotel and would definitely recommend it. ,5,2016,10,10
223,Avoid Avoid Avoid,"Terrible customer service and extortionate prices for an average experience. They snuck extra costs for a dinner that we could not attend onto the bill and would not remove these items from the bill when I queried. ""computer says no"" from the reception staff, who had other guests in tears for similar reasons.",1,2016,10,10
223,nice and practical,Stayed here for a weekend and enjoyed it.  The bedroom was big enough and had everything we wanted   The hotel was modern  the breakfast was fine and the dinner in the Park was Mitchelan quality both in terms of quality and standard of staff  We would come again,4,2016,10,10
223,Make sure you want the compulsory dinner at ‚Ç¨200 per room,"We went there for a wedding nearby, our rooms were prebooked.  We were told when we arrived that we had to have dinner also. Dinner for each person cost ‚Ç¨100.

As my room was a double, though I was alone, I had to pay for 2 dinners, each night - ‚Ç¨200.

2 nights therefore I had to pay an extra ‚Ç¨400.  Considering I had flown to Ireland for a wedding I pleaded to be allowed off these charges as I was not around in the evenings to have these meals.  The staff were borderline aggressive at certain points. 

The place is a scam, the views were of a dump.  Would strongly recommend finding somewhere with a little more charm, though if concrete blocks by a motorway are your scene, then go ahead and pay away.",1,2016,10,10
223,Fraudulant?,"I had the misfortune to stay at this place this weekend. We were in the area for a friend's wedding. We had two rooms as we were travelling with our disabled son and his carer.
The rooms had been booked by the groom via a third party website, and due to a mistake on the booking, one of the rooms was on a very expensive package including dinner - a price difference of ‚Ç¨160 per night for each of the two nights compared to the other room (which was identical inside). 
We explained we were not going to be having dinner, and after a long argument at check in, they agreed to give us the same rate on each room. This was agreed verbally, but I never got written confirmation that they were applying the new rate from the check in clerk, but I hadn't thought I needed a contract for this amendment.

When we came to check out, they explained that due to a dispute with the third party booking website they said they wanted to charge the higher rate. It then became clear that they had already billed my credit card for the higher rate and they flatly refused to reduce the rate to the agreed level, pointing at the fact that I had no written evidence to support the fact that they had agreed to the lower rate.

They had not informed us that they would be charging the higher rate (which included a full dinner package) until we were checking out, so obviously had not had the dinner, but were charged for the full dinner package anyway.

Advice: 
1. Don't stay here
2. Ensure you have written confirmation at check in of the rate and any prices. Do not trust any verbal communication from anyone working at this hotel
3. Be very careful providing them with your credit card details - they have shown willingness to abuse the trust of customers with credit card details (billing double the agreed rate), so be very careful providing card details.",1,2016,10,09
223,One nights business Stay,"Arrived around 6pm, went to room (208) which had a view over the air conditioning, not what I expect for the money paid.

room was OK on all aspects.

had room service which arrived promptly but without the bottle of water that I ordered, that arrived after a phone call.

checkout in the morning was a slower than expected with only one person being on duty 

WiFi was good, but for the price this is an average hotel.",3,2016,10,08
223,Awful customer service!,"Stayed here a Sunday night had room 223. Arrived and room wasn't ready, which was fine as I was early myself, receptionist told me she would take my bag and have it sent up to room for me. Which was the first problem, I was later to discover, of many... I had to go chase up my bag afterwards and at around 7pm! It sat there all day with no one realising it was laying in the open and anyone could have taken it!!! 

Next I had the worst ploughmans toasted sandwich in history in this hotel, it was truely awful and I don't know what kind off pickles they uses but they are vile! 

My stay was to become worse, I arrived into room and it was cold so turned on heater and the loudest shreak was coming from the radiator! I gave it benefit of doubt and let it stay like that until my ears could bear no more (30 Mins or so) and turned it down ever so slightly until the noise stopped but STILL NO HEAT! This was after over two hours! 

We went out for a meal , due to my earlier experience with the vile pickles, and returned back to a cold room - so I decided to call reception, they said they would send up a heater, ten mins later we had a foreign girl come in to tell me heater was warm (slightly warmer than blood temperature) and that their heating only comes on when outside is below 10degrees!??! I might add it was below 10 degrees that night!. She then proceeded to tell me there was nothing she could do and that they had no heaters to provide me with and left, I was outraged! 

No consideration for guests, and even though I mentioned my problem with room I got no gestures of good will or deduction from my bill. Not even an apology! Just told I should have been offered another room as they weren't busy... So why wasn't this suggested on the night to me!!! 

I later learned that room temperature and food are a common problem here from a member of the gym/pool as she said her family who stayed here experienced the same! 

Showers are poor for power in both hotel rooms and swimming pool area and also are only Luke warm.... 

Won't be back, disgusted and throughly dissapointed!!!",1,2016,10,05
223,"Lost luggage, do not stay here","Service is appalling, you would think a nice hotel would be accustomed to checking luggage, they lost my wife's luggage on our wedding night, so I have been in the lobby while the staff is running around completely disorganized. Terrible!",1,2016,09,30
223,Good but..... ,Stayed here several times over the years. On the whole it's very good but there were a couple of niggles on this visit. We were given room 118 and I didn't sleep a wink becaus  of very loud fan outside window. Asked to be moved for second night and they moved our room but there was no real apology or attempt to make up for the disturbance from the fan. I paid good money and the noise was the hotels fault so an apology and a bottle of wine or a box of chocolates or the like would have been the least you would expect. An acoustic shield on the front of the fan would make a big difference.  Also the shower heads in qym need descaling badly as they don't work well! Other than that it is a very good hotel with excellent food and friendly staff. Just disappointed not to have received any form of compensation for what was clearly a fault of the hotel. ,4,2016,09,29
223,Lovely Weekend at Castleknock Hotel,"Our stay at Castleknock was a very pleasant one. The hotel is a beautiful hotel surrounded by a golf course for golf lover. Our room was spacious, clean and bed was very comfortable. Breakfast was equally good with lots of varieties. The hotel has a big car park to park your car if driving. Definitely will stay at Castleknock again when in Dublin.",4,2016,09,26
223,Poor service,"The hotel itself looks very well the room we stayed in was lovely, but the service is appalling from start to finish from reception to dinning staff. 
Not what you would expect from a four star. 
I wouldn't stay again and from reading the reviews many other customers have had the same complaint but nothing has changed.",2,2016,09,26
223,Great hotel and service,Stayed here for a business conference. Rooms are spacious and clean. Service is very prompt and professional. Food is good with plenty of options. Hotel is easy find and has all amenities inside. Would return and recommend,5,2016,09,22
223,"Nice Hotel, close to city","I chose this hotel as it was close enough to the city to be able to get a taxi.
We were charged on average ‚Ç¨20 as they added a call out charge on to the cost. However taxis were very prompt.

Hotel has ups and downs.
Has a fantastic golf course if you like golf.
The spa is well worth a visit if you like a pamper.

I was very surprised that there was no air conditioning in the rooms. Our room was quite warm. We did however have a fan in the room. House keeping could be better.

A word of advise, however. Our room was at the front of the hotel close to the entrance . As a consequence to having to have the windows open we also had to endure the smell of cigarettes as many smokers were standing outside to have their fix.

Maybe the hotel management could look at installing somewhere away from the front and back of the hotel for smokers.

Breakfast was ok. However there was a problem with soft poached eggs! And the rolling toaster was so slow!

I recommend the restaurant, the food was lovely and the Kerala fish curry was really good.

Mark needs a mention too.  Excellent cocktail maker. He went the extra mile when I asked if he could make a Singapore sling.
After ""Google-ing"" was able to come up with one with an alternative addition. A "" Mark alternative sling"". Excellent. Made by birthday!

A lasting thought. The hotel is used for a lot of conferences weddings etc, so it can be very noisy in the bar.

223,always fantastic service in the Castleknock hotel,"I have stayed in this wonderful hotel on many occasions and it never disappoints. The hotel itself is beautiful. The rooms are spacious and lovely. The leisure centre is always working. The food  is always good. We never come away disappointed.
",5,2016,09,20
223,Won't b back,"I booked this hotel for 1 night ,and when we arrived and handed the very unfriendly male receptionist my booking voucher, he changed my room , when I asked him why I got no reply, he was on the walkie talkie to someone for at least 5 minutes while I was standing there, with no explanation as to why, I was then handed my room keys, our bedroom had a view of a flat roof and paper thin walls, I could hear the people next door clearly. Breakfast was lukewarm,but at least we got the only warm greeting of our stay by the nice waitress, on checking out the computer was consulted. And was told that's fine, the room had been paid for so no more interest   Not even goodbye, ",3,2016,09,19
223,Wonderful Hotel,"The Castleknock Hotel was a wonderful surprise. The entrance/ reception area is large, modern & bright & all staff were welcoming, pleasant & efficient. 

My room was large, very clean & comfortable. The ensuite was roomy & included a bath & separate shower. Breakfast was excellent with a wonderful selection of cold & hot food- cereals, fresh fruit, pastries, breads, etc. 

The hotel is situated on the outskirts of Dublin city, so it's probably best for travellers with their own transport. It feels like you're deep in the Irish countryside but you're only minutes from the hustle of the city. ",5,2016,09,18
223,Outstanding Staff,"My stay was my first visit to Ireland and it was a work only visit for a week. The staff not only made me feel more than welcome but went above and beyond knowing I had problems adjusting to the time zone change. Specifically the bartender, Siobhain (I really hope I spelled that correctly), was just about the most amazing person anyone could ask to meet, she was kind, helpful, thoughtful, and all around just a joy to talk to. Also another one of the bartenders, a young man named David, also went above and beyond to make me feel welcome and at home. I don‚Äôt drink but they never batted an eye at me ordering coffee, no matter the time and how busy they were, and they always had a kind word for me and were looking out for me. Also one of the supervisors or managers, I apologize as I am not sure of his title, by the name of Andrew, was also just a totally awesome person to me. The above employees made it a point to learn my name, where I was from, and just took the time to show me they had my back.  I don‚Äôt think my trip would have been as good or successful as it was if it wasn‚Äôt for them. My memories of Ireland are amazing even though I never got to travel and see anything outside of the hotel and work and it‚Äôs all because of them. Also the complimentary breakfast is awesome and the fish and chips with pea smash is crave worthy.",5,2016,09,18
223,Hotel great but avoid 'The Avenue Bar & Restaurant' for food,"We are regulars at Castleknock Hotel & always loved it there as a great all-rounder, the food, rooms & leisure centre. On our last stay we had a disasterous/farcical meal in the bar on one evening  but we were offered a replacement meal in the restaurant & we would highly recommend the 'Park Restaurant' for food but the 'Avenue Bar & Restaurant' has gotten even worse for food & customer service which we didn't think was possible.
We ate here on Sunday night & apart from ordering/receiving our food nobody came near us again to ask if the food was okay/clear the plates when done, we couldn't see anyone to ask for condiments which weren't on out table so we ended up having to get our own & the food was for the second time (last time as well) badly overcooked & dry, and from the time we ordered it to it being served took 5 minutes showing it was not cooked fresh. 
About 20 minutes after eating a member of staff came over & cleared our plates after we practically jumped up to catch her attention and she asked do you want dessert or tea/coffee, no how was your meal probably because we had seen quite a few leaving and complaining outside the bar and she left with the plates and didn't come back to sort out the bill, eventually the lady who was on the outside desk bringing people into the tables came in we caught her eye we asked her for our bill which she delivered quickly, we paid & left.
So we will continue to stay at Castleknock but will never eat in the bar again, so our advice is eat in the restaurant or the clubhouse at the golf club and give the bar food a wide berth at the hotel because once is a mistake or bad night but twice is not on. 
We do not leave bad reviews unless they are completely warranted & we have in the past gone privately to the food & beverages manager about our bad food/waiting staff  experience in the Avenue as we feel everyone deserves a second chance but when things worsen instead of improve we will go public with it so others can avoid what we experienced.",4,2016,09,14
223,Lovely hotel,"Stayed here for one night. Hotel is very nice. Clean and comfortable. Breakfast was buffet style and had plenty of choice. Made use of the sauna, steam room and jacuzzi which was an added bonus. 10 minute drive Into the city centre.",5,2016,09,14
223,Super,"Great weekend in Dublin stayed at Castleknock  because we wanted to play golf
Nice room good breakfast buffet friendly people
Only 20-25 min drive into city center of Dublin 
Great venue for wedding or party",4,2016,09,14
223,Enjoyable Stay,"Stayed at this hotel for 2 nights at the beginning of September 2016. Staff was very courteous and efficient. We were initially given a lovely room overlooking the golf course, but there was a lot of noise from a fan/compressor outside our window, so we asked to be moved and were given an equally nice room overlooking the car park.

The bed was big and comfortable and it was nice to be given a choice of pillows. However, we encountered a problem during the night. There does not appear to be any means of controlling the temperature in the room, so despite being comfortable temperature wise we were awaken in the night by loud banging noises. We both thought someone was banging on our door, but it appeared to be coming from the radiator. Once we had established where the noise was coming from we went back to sleep but were awaken several times by the banging noises and later on in the morning by water gurgling through the radiator. We told the concierge in the morning - somehow he did not look the least bit surprised by our complaint, so think it is time to overhaul the heating system.

Bathroom was pleasant with both a shower and a bath, fluffy towels and plenty of toiletries. 

Breakfast was delicious with a wide choice of both hot and cold items. 

All in all we enjoyed our stay and would not hesitate to return at a later stage.",4,2016,09,13
223,My weekly visit ,This has got to be one of the nicest hotels I have ever visited. The friendliness of the staff are second to none. On entering the hotel you are met with a beautiful arrangement of flowers . The hotel is so clean and the decor is fabulous . The function rooms have everything you need even some little touches like a few sweets and loads of iced water I would differently recommend this hotel to anyone for business and pleasure . ,5,2016,09,13
223,Good location if you want to visit Dublin City but don't want to stay in the City.,"This hotel is about a 10 minute drive from Phoenix Park, where we spent a lovely. It is also a 10 minute drive to Blanchardstown where you could park and take the bus into Dublin. The hotel has a golf course, but not really much grounds if you wanted a nice walk after breakfast or dinner. The food was good (especially breakfast) though I did find the dinner menu for both the restaurant and bar fairly limited, but what choice there was was good.  Hotel staff where friendly and helpful. The hotel itself was good and the triple room for 3 adults was adequate (though there were only 2 chairs). As we were only there for 2 nights we didn't make use of the pool, but it did look nice. Overall a pleasant stay and I would certainly consider staying here again.",4,2016,09,13
223,Good quality hotel,This hotel is well situated in a quiet location on an old country road. It over looks a beautiful golf course on one side and is close to Castleknock village and the Phoenix park. Its a great place to meet up with friends and clients alike and has free wifi.,4,2016,09,13
223,Lovely hotel,"We have stayed her twice this year (May and Sept), both times for 2 nights. Hotel and rooms are spotless, really nice. We booked a family room which has 2 double beds. Indoor pool great for children. My only negative was at breakfast no-one cleared our table after cereal etc. With 2 toddlers the table became very crowded with plates etc. I had to clear it myself. Other tables around us were being cleared away but no-one came near us. I would stay again.",4,2016,09,12
223,Fantastic stay ,We stayed for one night on our way to the airport. All of the staff were fantastic and extremely helpful. Food was fantastic and drinks cold. Very close to the airport in a quiet location. The rooms were very clean and beds comfortable. 5 stars,5,2016,09,12
223,All the charm of an airport waiting lounge ,Possibly the only way to ruin an otherwise perfect week in Ireland. Cavernous hotel that makes guests feel like an inconvenience.  Rooms are tiny and stuffy. No AC means you either suffocate or open a window. In our case the windows opened up to some sort of loud machinery and garbage bags. So between the smell and the noise open windows were not an option. Suffocate we did. One of the only reasons we book this Hotel and not another in a more convenient location was the pool facilities. Unfortunately the day we actually wanted to use the pool we were told we cannot because there was an aerobics class for non hotel guests. Did I mention that the hotel is dated and faded and generally a place that was great in 1993 but definitely not now. ,2,2016,09,10
223,All kinds of wonderful ,"From the check in to the check out nothing but fantastic! Even had a gym sesh too. 
Good was great, didn't have time to sample the breakfast unfortunately. 
Few gripes; would love more smiles from the staff, Olivier who served me my steak was so cold, cheer up mate. 
The room had no aircon, something I am used to. 

All that said, this is my new favourite place!! Xx",5,2016,09,06
223,Fantastic golf course... ,"Visited in September 2016. Booked a golf package deal. The course is fantastic. Really picturesque and in great condition. The hotel itself is nice and modern, rooms were clean and spacious. Check in was a little delayed, it's was 5:30 before our room was ready. We ate in the bar, starter was lovely. A shared platter and was not only sizable but delicious.  Main courses were disappointing. 3 out of the 4 people got a rib eye steak. 25 euro and it was a tiny cut. It was nice but not value for money. The other main was a southern fried chicken. It was terrible, dry and seemed like it had been reheated. Lacked taste. This was the only downside, the server looked after us all night. Kept the drinks coming and was very friendly. Breakfast was standard hotel affair, self serve full irish and or continental. Overall we had a pleasant stay. ",4,2016,09,04
223,Was a nice hotel but disappointed this time,"We stayed for 2 nights at the end of August  2016 in a family room 2 adults and 2 children and 1 single occupancy room for a grandparent. We got a good deal including dinner and Dublin zoo tickets and they were very accommodating to ensure my mothers room was near the lift. However, the first night there was a very loud party in the room next to the family room from 9.30pm until 1am. Despite speaking to reception 4 times they failed to stop the party in the room and my children and I were kept awake until 1am. When I complained at reception the next day they said they didn't really hear the party and said it stopped at 10.30pm. The reception staff didn't really seem to care and were very dismissive. Maybe it was because they were more interested in the Irish Football team who were staying at the same time! The same was found of the service at breakfast and at the bar. Staff were generally short and sometimes rude. They appeared to want to avoid eye contact or collect plates or take coffee or tea orders. 
Despite these issues the spa staff were very nice and the lifeguard helped us to get an ice pack when our 6 year old son hit his shoulder badly on a sticking out hand rail under the water in the pool. 
The hotel was however very clean and obviously had new carpets in certain areas. 
It is in a nice area of Dublin and close the city. 
Overall a disappointing experience as customer service isn't hard to get right. Customers just shouldn't feel like they are causing a bother to staff!   ",2,2016,09,03
223,A real Cead Mile Failte,You may be a 4 Star hotel...But to me you are worth 5 Star status in all areas....Thank you again for a wonderful stay and good luck with the new extension...I shall send as many family and business colleagues as I can so that they too can experience a real c√©ad m√≠le f√°ilte.,5,2016,08,29
223,Quiet Luxury,This is a quality yet quiet 4 star hotel away from the hustle and bustle of Dublin yet close enough to enjoy the city life if needs be. The spacious reception area leads into the bars and restaurant whilst upstairs the rooms are tasteful and spacious. The food is top quality and breakfast very extensive from the buffet table. A leisure centre is available as well as a quality golf course with lots of water and sand. Great for a relaxing break.,5,2016,08,28
223,Excellent,"I spent one night here due to having an early morning interview nearby and I am glad I did. The staff are amazing and really go out of their way to help. Due to my very early start, the lady at reception Tara, arranged for tea and a croissant to be made available for me to take away. 
I had a compact single room which was perfect for me, comfy bed, lovely shower and cozy room. Much thanks to the staff for making my stay so relaxing.",5,2016,08,26
223,Lovely 2 night family break,"Booked 2 rooms for the family for a last minute break at the end of July, all online reviews looked positive so decided to go for it. The reviews were not wrong, lovely twin and double rooms next to each other, equipped as expected and spotlessly clean. 

The leisure facilities at the hotel were 1st class, friendly, helpful staff and well maintained and clean facilities throughout. The pool was ample size, jacuzzi lovely and one of the best steam rooms I have ever been in.

Breakfast at the hotel was superb, staff again couldn't have been nicer and the choice and selection available was 1st class, once you had breakfast there was no need to eat again until evening time.

The location of the hotel is very quiet yet only 2 miles from the massive Blanchardstown Shopping Centre and a 2 minute walk from the No.37 Bus route that takes you into the heart of Dublin.

Next time I come I'm leaving the kids at home booking her highness in for the spa and bringing my golf clubs :) the attached course looked very nice.",5,2016,08,24
223,Lovely break away,"Me and my husband stayed here in July for one night, We had such a busy weekend and had this hotel booked for the Sunday night, I couldn't have been happier when we arrived to this stunning hotel, The Room was spacious and clean, the bed was huge! (we had any exclusive Double) We love that the lift had to have the card to go to the other floors that was a great security measure. Breakfast was good, We did request gluten free toast but it didn't get to us until after we had finished everything else, but that's okay because we will just order it straight away next time. All of the staff were friendly and well mannered although Service was a little slow considering how many staff were around. We are very excited to be vising again this week to celebrate our 5th Anniversary, We can't wait to use the pool as we didn't get time last time! See you Thursday Castleknock!! :)",5,2016,08,23
223,Overall very good stay,"Stayed here for 1 night while attending a wedding nearby. Booked an executive room. Room itself was lovely, very large with huge very comfy bed and good bathroom. View was of the carpark but as I was only there for a night that didn't bother me. Staff were very nice, especially in the bar area. Only minor thing for improvement was when checking in and giving credit card for approval, I wasn't told why the amount differed from the price of my room ( price of room plus an extra 30e for any extras.) I had to ask why the price was different but I really think this should be said without me having to ask. Overall a good hotel and would stay again.",4,2016,08,22
223,Excellent rooms in a lovely location in easy access of Dublin,"Very well appointed rooms in a countryside location, but easy to get to the centre of Dublin. Breakfast buffet very good, evening meals in the bar a little expensive but OK. Service can be slow in the evening if they are busy and sometimes the staff seem more interested in cleaning up than serving customers. The gymnasium is good but a little small for the size of the hotel.",4,2016,08,18
223,lovely surroundings,"Stayed for one night, good sized room, awfully hot, but a fan was provided, communal areas were airless! Bar food was ok but breakfast was a bit cold. I reported breakfast trays with leftover food  in the corridors at 7pm  and they were still there at 10pm, there was a swimming hat on the floor by the curtains which does question the effort put into vacuuming. Really enjoyed a swim and steam room.",4,2016,08,17
223,"Good, could be great with small tweaks ","Family of 5 stayed here for a few days on a staycation.   This hotel has a function room and does a lot of weddings, sometimes can take over the hotel at certain times.  Food was excellent and bar is a bit soulless.  We had to relocate as our interlocking rooms were directly over the function room and there was a lot of noise transfer from the band playing.  All handled well but pointless having family rooms over the function room!! 
Rooms are way way too hot and there is no a/c - fans available but we stayed there at a time when daytime temp was 18-20 degrees Celsius - no need for heat on and no way of cooling the room down.  
water not in the rooms but could easily be as the hotel bottles its own - should be provided in a 4 star.  Pool was good.   Close to M50 and a good base to strike for Dublin and surrounding area.  ",4,2016,08,16
223,very disappointed,"Have stayed in this hotel before and it was ok.
Stayed there August 7th 2016 and have to say it was terrible. The service was terrible for lunch as 2 of 4 orders were completely wrong and the waiting time was 45 minutes.
For convenience we had dinner there aswell and the experience was the same.
We were seated promptly but waited almost one hour from the time we ordered.
Then some meals were wrong.
In fact the quailty of food was terrible and way over priced.
The chairs in the Avenue Dining area were dirty and stained.
The place was not been cleaned after other people had eaten.
We had a four people in our party and the table they gave us was more like a table for two.
Next morning for breakfast I saw an elderly couple struggle to get their breakfasts back to their tables because the buffet area was so far away from where they were seated.
I actually helped them with their tray. 
Very poor overall. This Hotel has gone down hill big time.
I wont be going back anytime soon.",2,2016,08,16
223,Excellent hotel,Stayed for one night there was a group of 8 of us Lovely comfortable rooms excellent staff We dined in the restaurant and the food was out of this world everyone of us commented on the quality and value of the meals we got it was superb complements to the chef the lady serving our table was brilliant and a great asset to the hotel didnt get her name but she was from Moldova she was so helpful to all explaining all aspects of the menu Had the pork belly starter and veal main one of the best meals I have had in a long time Beautiful looking golf course alongside the hotel didnt get to play it but hopefully will return sometime to stay and play the course,5,2016,08,15
223,fine 4 star hotel with 5 star food,"Just stayed here with a group of male golfers. The hotel itself was good, as expected for a good 4 star. The lobby was a bit busy and loud due to the open plan and the fact that there was a least one wedding in progress. rooms were good, clean and spacious. Breakfast was good, a bit spread out and difficult to find everything, but we managed. However the highlight was definitely the dinner, we had a great 6 course dinner for ‚Ç¨40, which was excellent from start to finish with great friendly service. Well done. I would strongly recommend it for dinner.",4,2016,08,15
223,Great hotel - lovely location ,Stayed here on a 2 night break with the hubby and we enjoyed it. Only flaw for us was we were put in a room near rowdy Golfers who seemed to drink and then make a lot of noise through the night so we didn't get rested well.  I reported this to staff who didn't seem overly bothered - I'm guessing they get a lot of revenue from the golfers! Apart from that the hotel is gorgeous very modern and clean and set in nice grounds.  We only had breakfast at the hotel which was good.  We ate out in castle knock village which is a lovely wee village.  Also visited blanchardstown centre for shopping which was brilliant. Swimming pool was good and clean. I'd go back but will take ear plugs next time lol ,4,2016,08,12
223,Great family break,"Having read some of the previous reviews regarding poor staff attitude I was a bit apprehensive about booking this hotel but my nine year old daughter wanted to stay in a hotel with a pool and I wanted to be about half an hour from the city. We arrived early, about 9:30 in the morning as we were going to go into the city by bus and leave the car at the hotel.The bus stop is about a 10 min walk and they leave about every 15 mins,(the no.37 bus).The receptionist couldn't have been nicer, she told us that our room wasn't ready yet but we could leave our bags with them until later. When we returned about 7pm,there was a man on Reception (Alex?) to check us in. He also was very courteous and polite.The room was a family room,one single,one double which was a good size and the bathroom was nice too,lovely deep bath after walking around the city all day!Breakfast the next morning was lovely with a wide range of cooked breakfast, yoghurt, smoothies, waffles and cereal. After breakfast the 3 of us headed to the pool, children are only allowed between 9am and 6pm. The pool area was well maintained and clean and my daughter loved it.Maybe a bad review is down to catching some staff on a bad day, we've all had them, or maybe the staff have had some training due to some bad reviews, who knows? All in all my family and I really enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend it to others.",5,2016,08,11
223,Charming modern country hotel surrounded by manicured grounds and golf course,"This hotel easily rated 5 stars. The location was quiet and stunningly beautiful. Our room was large with a real king size bed, plenty of closet space, big bathroom and wide windows.

The bed was very comfortable. The shower worked well with easily controlled water temperature.

The hotel staff was very friendly and accommodating, particularly the front desk team and the breakfast wait staff.

I'll definitely come back and stay here again.",5,2016,08,10
223,It is what it is. ,"Was on a business trip to ITB so the hotel was 10-15mins drive depending on traffic to the institute which was very good. 5mjn drive away from the brilliant blanchardstown shopping centre.                                                        Easy parking system in front of hotel with plenty of parking spaces. The twin room was very nice and very clean. Good view overlooking the golf course. Both shower and bath was nice. Just to note the room was very hot, no air conditioning available and when you open the window you have a constant noise, must be coming from the pool plant room that runs the leisure centre. id rather the room to be hot then cold so its not a negative just a note. 
Breakfast was good with good variety. Staff seemed distant but did their jobs professionally which is what their paid for but that 4 star vibe, experience wasn't their. It is what it is. However, id stay here again. ",4,2016,08,08
223,Lovely hotel fantastic food. ,"Just back from a 2 night stay. We really enjoyed it. We were there last year and enjoyed it so much we returned. Love the fact you are so close to.the city yet it has a country feel. The food in the Park Restaurant disappointed us the last visit. There was a huge improvement this visit. The food was amazing! We also ate in the bar and this was lovely. Breakfast is busy but lots of choice and staff do their best to keep everyone happy. The service at the bar is very very slow. I was standing at one stage for 10 mins waiting to order. Several staff walked past me. I wouldn't have minded if they were serving other people but they weren't. Staff are actually very friendly just slighted disorganised in the bar. The swimming pool is lovely, clean and warm. The grounds are very well kept. Love the touch of suncream sunglasses, blankets and umbrellas for the outside area. We will definitely return and would highly recommend it to friends and family. Would have been a 5 star review only for the slow bar service.",4,2016,08,07
223,Outside of city bustle,Lovely hotel with golf course attached. The restaurant offered excellent cuisine and wonderful service. Only problem was no A/C in the rooms. Offered a small table fan.. Ceiling fans would have been more appropriate. Super easy access to Dublin city center via a bus that you access by walking a short distance through a wooded neighborhood (maybe three blocks). Would recommend this to anyone. We had a rental and they had free parking.  ,5,2016,08,05
223,Favourite place for a family break!,"We have been going here every summer since our little girl was born ( she's 3now) and as usual this visit was faultless!! Relaxing atmosphere, plenty to keep the little one occupied and every department of staff are so pleasant! On arrival there was a bit of confusion with our booking that was quickly sorted by Alex without any fuss! The pool and park are great and breakfast is of exceptional standard! Looking forward to our next visit!!! ",5,2016,08,04
223,Another great visit,We are regular visitors to this hotel over the last 12 years. It remains a first choice. It is always lively and worthy of its rating. Food always to a high standard. I strongly recommend the Italian Stallion burger. When we found the safe in our room could not be opened it was quickly responded to by the lovely lady from Housekeeping. Beautiful swimming pool where the swimming cap rule is enforced. I do wish the hotel could more effectively persuade party guests from smoking outside the front entrance and use the designated area. ,5,2016,08,03
223,Three night break,Staff at reception could be a little more friendly and welcoming. We stayed in a room overlooking the golf course. The room was clean and bed very comfortable. A nice touch is the  large complementary bottled sparkling and still water. Bar food was not great and on our night there was spoiled with some noisy children with no parental supervision. On another night we had dinner in the nearby golf club. Excellent location over looking the course and good service/food in a pleasant environment.,4,2016,08,02
223,Very enjoyable stay,"We booked two nights under a 'special deal' and feel that we received value for money. The bedroom was spacious and comfortable, with good wi-fi reception. We liked the reception area with its little cafe/patisserie area - great idea. As was the drinks/snack machine on our floor. Like most hotels C'Knock provides a buffet style breakfast but the quality and choice of the ingredients was first class. We were greeted warmly and tea/coffee was served efficiently. We would certainly return without hesitation.",4,2016,08,02
223,Weekend break,"Grounds are beautiful around the hotel..plenty of different areas to chill out on the grounds of hotel... food was  excellent. .breakfast excellent. ..
Room was OK,  beds could be better...
Cleaning was done daily, and to a very good standard...
Check in was delayed for one of our rooms, that kinda messed up our plans for that day..
Pool was closed the next day (due to an accident), again sort of messed up our plans..but that's life...
Bar staff and cleaning staff were lovely/chatty and helpful..reception a little hostile...
 

Large hotel with plenty of areas to chill..
Excellent food/drinks selection

Great thought was put into 'outside dining area'.It offered umbrellas /sunglasses/and blankets.. lovely little extras 

Enjoyed our stay.",4,2016,08,01
223,Lacks that final touch- Some staff awful- bar manager fantastic,"My husband and I visited this hotel as a special treat for my husbands 40th birthday. Was meant to be a one off, special weekend away with no children (something we have not been able to do for quite some time). But was ruined by a catalogue of bad events that ruined what was meant to be a special weekend.
Check in was easy and we were allowed to use the facilities whilst we waited for our room to be ready. We were given our room and first impression was good, we had paid for an executive room and the room was good but nothing overly special. My husband will not sleep with windows closed so we opened the window to be greeted with the most awful constant hum drum, buzzing, fan type noise that was very loud and irritating to say the least. After 20 minutes of it we had had enough. (Plus the view for the room was awful, was the roof top of something below and in our opinion not right for an upgraded room). I went to reception and we were moved to an equivalent room on the next floor.
This was better but not great. New carpets had been laid but this made the door very very difficult to open and close.
The TV did not work, although this was sorted quickly by maintenance staff, but he was very miserable and obviously it was an inconvenience that we had called upon him.
The pool and facilities are very good and staff on that side ok. Although not very attentive to poorly behaved children. But this too should be the parents that should deal with them also, but when they are breaking rules staff should alert them of the dangers.
Drinks in the hotel are very expensive but this seems to be the case in the area. There is an off licence a short walk away which is reasonably priced.
So we tended to drink later in the room.
The bar manager was very friendly and very good at his job, he was constantly busy and the bar area was clean, fresh and welcoming. (Nice little touch was the blankets provided to keep you warm whilst outside).
The hotel in general is clean and well presented, toilets clean and tidy.
Hotel reception is not overly well organised but could be worse. Perhaps at check out/ check in times more staff could be available to make this run smoother.
First two nights of our stay was good. Nothing special but good entertainment provided and quiet and relaxing.
The third night was horrific and will haunt me for a long time! This sounds over the top but nothing could prepare me for the night we experienced.
There was a wedding on in the hotel on the Saturday night and things were not overly well organised. Staff seemed to be running around not getting much done and the bar was very busy but lacked enough staff. We went out for a while to escape the mayhem but when we returned it was very busy with lots of drunk people and very noisy.
We had decided to have a couple drinks in our room out of the way but the noise from the wedding was very loud. We asked for a fan as we could not sleep with the windows shut but with them open in was so loud you couldn't hear yourself think!
This went on and on and at about 1am we were sick of it and seemed like there was no end to it.
From about 1am through till approx 3am there was constant noise and shouting from the corridors, the language was appalling.
Then just after 3am there was lots of commotion in the corridor and on looking though the spy hole we saw two people engaging in sexual activity lying in the corridor!! This went on loudly for a long time. Security did not stop this and even after a call down to reception at 3.25am this still continued! We were disgusted that this was allowed to happen and for such a long time. Surely night security picked this up on the cameras!
Breakfast at the hotel is not very well organised and lacks heat and attention. It is mass produced and not great.
On check out I made it clear we were not happy about what had been allowed to happen the night before but it was almost laughed off. I asked for this to be discussed with a manager but my name and number was taken and I was told I would be contacted, but so far I have not! Poor customer service yet again. At ¬£145 per night this is not the standard I would expect!
We will not be returning to this hotel, it needs a huge shape up with staff and personal training.
Ruined what was meant to be a very special weekend. We were left very tired, disappointed and upset. ",2,2016,08,01
223,Wouldn't return here again!üòü,"Cannot echo enough the poor recent reviews regarding the staff at this place. We visited with our 2 year old & got off to a terrible start with 1 1/2 hour wait to check in. Then allocated a room with no bed for our son! Can't get the basics right!

We had booked & prepaid for a family room. We received an email a few days before our arrival offering the opportunity to upgrade to an executive room for a small fee so on the day of check-in we called to find out if it was still possible to upgrade. We were told it was possible to upgrade for a few extra euros & that there would be a single bed in the upgraded room for our son.

After 4 hours at the hotel, many conversations & being sent to 2 different rooms across the hotel, we managed to establish that we had been incorrectly informed...the hotel does not have executive rooms which accommodate families but clearly not all the staff know of this!

To add insult to injury we were charged twice for the upgrade which we were told would be refunded and even after leaving the place which had been a headache from start to finish, had to contact them to try to further pursue a refund due to their 'administrative' error! Unbelievable!",2,2016,07,31
223,love this place,ok have been visiting this hotel from its opening about 10 yrs ago. Now everywhere i stay i compare it to here. This is the best place you can get with international sports teams using it. I dont play golf but the hotel overlooks an amazing course. 5 min drive from Blanchardstown shoppping. and 5 mins to the M50. located out on its own. Great choice at breakfast with the pancake maker a big hit with the kids. Has got expensive since it won AA hotel of the year so best to look for specials. Family rooms are expensive and never on special. Bar area is modern.Best hotel ever...a treat to stay here.,4,2016,07,31
223,"A great hotel... In a great location... But..,","We have just returned from a 3 night stay at this hotel. It is in the perfect location 10 mins from Dublin Zoo in one direction and 10mins from Blanchardstown Shopping Centre in the other. Castleknock village nearby offers several restaurants including a lovely little Italian we tried and would recommend. 

The hotel lobby itself has a lot of impact; modern and bustling. There's a great little cafe come patisserie in the middle which is something which is quite unique. It always smelled amazing too! 

Our room was lovely; a good size and very comfortable. Super slick free wifi, comfortable beds and a well appointed bathroom; loved the stand alone shower. 

The pool and gym were also excellent. Father/child changing area was inspired and very forward thinking. We used these facilities on several occasions. There's also a great little play park outside which my daughter loved. 

The fabric and physicality of this hotel is faultless but their is a big BUT coming. At every turn we were disappointed by the levels of personal service we received. Staff overall did not make an impact overall apart from the gym/pool where a young lady at the desk was so helpful so much so she gave suggestions which entirely shaped our trip. Service at dinner on our first night was painfully slow and forgettable, each morning at breakfast we had to chase tea/coffee and there was a general lack of presence/engagement from staff. I watched an American couple ask a young waiter for tea and coffee and he carried out the request effectively but did not speak one word! Breakfast always seemed disorganised lacking in process. 

Not once did any member of staff speak to our 6 year old child... apart from the pool area. The staff here stood out by a mile. Check in and out was bland to say the least.all of the above needs work and has pulled a potentially high 4 star rating to a low one. This was disappointing given the outstanding service we received from Valerie on the telephone prior to our stay. 

We availed of a great deal at this hotel and would return again but to avail of proximity and services; further work to engage more genuinely with the customer will make such a difference to the travellers experience. ",4,2016,07,29
223,Management HR problem,Property itself and location very good. I stayed three nights with my 11 year old son. On arrival I went to check our bar menu with my son and greeted with a grunt by a bouncer type.  If this was my hotel I'd look to recruit staff who wanted to work in customer service.  My impression throughout the stay was that generally the staff were a bit grumpy and in the wrong job.  On check out  I wanted to mention that the courtyard facing rooms were pretty noisy with windows open.  The rooms were very hot! I also wanted to mention that there was an intermittent noise that kept me awake most of the last night of the stay (Room 144). I waited patiently as Alex the desk guy shared a private joke with another team member.  When he was finally wrapped up his story he didn't ask how the stay was and was everything ok.  And as he folded my  bill he continued to smirk at his own sense of humor without engaging in the slightest.  Not a great way to thank a customer who left aprox 700 euro in the till.,2,2016,07,29
223,Ideal location,"Food was delicious, waiting staff were very friendly and accommodating. Room was clean, fan was a welcome addition. Pool was great for kids along with play ground. Easy to get in and out of Dublin without going near the m50. In all had a great stay would definitely stay here again.",5,2016,07,27
223,Hotel stay and golf ,"My husband and I stayed here one night. Overall, we were disappointed. The room and ensuite were clean but there was a lack of AC and the windows provided poor ventilation so our room was hot and stuffy. The rooms were already showing some wear and tear. The hotel restaurant was overpriced. Many of the amenities like the pool closed way too early to be enjoyed. For the price paid we had higher expectations. The hotel tries to be 5 star but ends up looking pretentious. 

We played 9 holes of golf. We received average clubs that we rented. The course was well-manicured and challenging. ",3,2016,07,22
223,Excellent hotel,"stayed in January in one of the deluxe rooms and we were very impressed.Check in was welcoming and efficient. The room was of the highest standard.Extras included luxury toiletries, bathrobes the highest standard of bed linen.the d√©cor of the room was stunning.We enjoyed an excellent evening meal and retired to the lobby to enjoy a drink and listen to.music.After a heavenly nights sleep we enjoyed top class breakfast and relaxation in the leisure centre We will return",5,2016,07,20
223,"Great golf course, great staff and great place to relax","I stayed 2 nights and I will rate the following

1. Golf 5/5- paid ‚Ç¨40 per person. Lovely course (18) not difficult but have enough water around to make it interesting. Food was lovely in the club.

2. Room-4/5 no air con which made caused a sleepless night. Fan helped a bit. Only one dressing gown in the room and water wasn't replaced when room was cleaned. Room overlooking the car park and was not loud at night time with people leaving the hotel. Very comfortable bed, super king size. Modern design. Lovely bathroom. 

3. Staff- 5/5 very friendly staff especially in the bar and restaurant. 

4. Swimming pool- 5/5 if you like swimming just avoid the family times as it's very busy.

5. Food- 4/5 breakfast was disappointing if you want to eat sth different than Irish brekkie. Dinner was amazing and bar food is very tasty as well.

Weekend was great and if its wasn't for no air con I would give it 5*.",4,2016,07,18
223,Not all that great ,"The Hotel itself is beautiful but for some reason the staff seem to not have any interest in being polite or helpful at all there were kids running up and down the corridor for hours on end and the staff just turn off to it 
The food selection is nothing special and when you pay this much for two nights I think the least you could expect is a please or thank you or even a good morning would be nice 
Dublin itself is a very beautiful place and the locals are very kind ",3,2016,07,17
223,So kind and helpful,"We rang the hotel really late around 10pm  as our flight had been cancelled and we had stayed there twice in previous years. Once they heard we had got married the previous day and were now unable to go on honeymoon as planned they were so kind. Gave us a lovely room and sent up a bottle of champagne. The following morning we were allowed use the computer the receptionist was using to rebook our honeymoon, from flights to accommodation. We stayed another night in the hotel just to relax and unwind. They gave us an even nicer room for that night! Love this hotel and it's staff. ",5,2016,07,14
223,"Very disappointed, poor standard - wont be back","We booked Castleknock as recommended by friends as a family trip for parents 60th Birthdays this year. 4 rooms were booked, of which we had issues with 3 of them. Very disappointed, considering the amount of money spent on this weekend break.  Wont be back & wouldn't recommend to anyone.  

The room we were booked into - smell of smoke was overpowering, it made us feel sick.  Called reception & they said they had no other rooms to move us to & asked if we wanted housekeeping to call up.  They brought a machine to removed the smell of smoke.
Parents room - loud extractor fans right outside window.  Asked to moved, got moved to new room.  New room, horrendous smell from shower. Smelt like sewage. Again had to ring reception, who then got maintenance to take a look & address it.  Drain was blocked in shower. So we left the room with windows open to try get rid of smell.
No robes or slippers in 3 out of the 4 rooms booked.  Had to again ring to ask for these to be brought to rooms.  
Swimming pool - lovely area, thoroughly enjoyed. However we were told we had to purchase hats to swim in the pool, which we did. Yet when in the pool, number of people not wearing hats.  
Dinner -  Had booked dinner week prior to going to hotel.  On arrival for dinner, tables weren't ready so had to wait.  Then when called, put at 4 round coffee type tables  pulled together.  Spoke to manager, who said there was no tables available and again had to wait. Eventually got seated at proper dinner table.  Food was ok.  Seats in restaurant were filthy, covered in stains.
When leaving & asked how everything was, we raised these issues. Didn't even get an apology.  Hotel is definitely not up to 4 * standard.",2,2016,07,14
223,Late check in,Stayed here for one night with husband and baby. We didn't arrive in Dublin until 11 o'clock. We arrived into reception to really loud music there was a function on. I found this really off putting as we had baby with us as well. You could hardly hear the guy on reception. Thankfully when we arrived at out pr room I couldn't hear a sound. Found the room really stuffy and hot was an uncomfortable night sleep. Breakfast was good was buffet style. Found check out really unfriendly the guy on reception didn't speak two words just took my card and gave me my receipt. I used to stay at this hotel years ago for work and always found it fabulous that's why I booked for my family. Definetly has gone down hill over the years would only stay for location.,3,2016,07,13
223,Nice hotel - fantastic food!,"Our family of four stayed here mid July '16 for 2 nights / 3 days. The hotel is a little bit difficult to find, but once you've been there it's easy to navigate to nearby sights / locations.  
Overall our stay was excellent. We availed of one of the hotel's packaged deals where we had an evening meal & tickets (and picnic) to Dublin Zoo included.  
It was cheaper to book direct with the hotel rather than via one of the usual comparison sites.  
Great facilities, amazing food (breakfast and dinner) and very helpful and friendly staff.  The only drawback was that our room didn't have air con, just a table top fan.  

Overall, I recommend this hotel for family & business travellers.",4,2016,07,13
223,Great hotel,"Stayed here at the weekend with friends and had a great time.  The breakfasts are to die for and anyone walking away hungry would have to be really fussy.  The beds I found to be very comfortable, with choice of pillows. The lady on the desk on Saturday morning was very helpful offering to google anywhere we wanted to go and she would print out directions for us.  Couldnt find any fault with this hotel.",5,2016,07,11
223,Very good stay at Castleknock Hotel,"We stayed overnight at Castleknock to visit Dublin. The staff was very helpful with everything we needed; directions, printing boarding passes, serving us breakfast early so we could make our early flight. Thanks to all!",4,2016,07,11
223,Terrible ,Ordered room service after 11 for 2 sandwiches with sweetchilli chicken got a ham and cheese and a plain chicken sandwich!! Within the crisps that came with the sandwich I found a hard piece of plastic that looks like the end of a knife!!!! Also ordered 2 drinks of coke and got a milk and a ginger ale!!! Also paid ‚Ç¨200 for a suite only to be given a double room!!! Never again will I stay in such a miss manged hotel!! When I confronted reception staff I was told that I could speak to the manager in the morning and the night staff didn't even know how to work the till!!! Disgrace !!!!,1,2016,07,10
223,Good stay,Not a location to stay at of you're travelling to Dublin sightseeing. A bit far out. However the location itself is very picturesque and impressive. Our room didn't have air con as stated when booking and was above the kitchen which meant that when the windows were open there was a lot of noise from the extractors. Having said that the room was very nice and good value for money.,4,2016,07,07
223,In town for a concert,"Booked the hotel for a one night stay as we were going to a concert at the 3 Arena. The hotel is slightly out of town but this is not a problem as a straight run down through the Phoenix Park brings you out along the Quays and on to the concert hall. The room was spacious and comfortable, the staff very pleasant and the breakfast offered a good selection either cooked or continental. The hotel also has ample parking, good leisure facilities and a golf course for those who play. A nice out of town setting but yet with easy access to the city which offers the best of both worlds in my opinion.",4,2016,07,03
223,"Great Hotel,  would highly recommend to friends/family ","We recently visited here in June 16, the hotel is beautifully kept and very clean. Staff were attentive and very helpful. The bar area and restaurant were beautiful, we ate at the avenue, the food was gorgeous. The breakfast was possibly one of the best I've had, so much choice, and again very attentive staff. We stayed in room 158 next door to the spa, our room was very hot and the small fan did little to help the problem, other than that the room went without fault. The spa was a little bit of a let down, it was more of a swimming baths in my opinion than a spa. The upstairs part where treatments take part was nice, but not spectacular. I had 2 treatments that were both lovely. Although it would have been nice to be able to relax in a spa environment after my massages. 

Overall a great hotel, 20/30 mins out of city centre Dublin and around ¬£20/¬£25 euros in a taxi

223,Reservations Staff Very Rude,"We visited this hotel as we were considering it as a location to accommodate guests for a wedding hosted in another (non-hotel) venue.  Staff we dealt with were very friendly and professional.  That is, until we attempted to make a reservation.

We were told in very snide tone that no matter how big the booking, no discounts would be offered and they would refuse to do any kind of block booking just because it was for a wedding.

This is despite the fact that, as we were told by staff at reception, they do offer group discounts for bookings of other kinds.

It seems that if I was booking a golfing weekend for a large group they would have bent over backwards to accommodate us.  But because it was for a wedding they wanted to punish us for not hosting the wedding at their hotel.  There was no problem with availability of rooms, it's quite a large hotel and the reception staff confirmed that there was plenty of availability.

I found the attitude of the reservations employee we dealt with sickening and I will be instructing my guests to steer clear of this venue.",1,2016,07,01
223,Fantastic stay,"Receptionist was very friendly and accommodating on check in. The bedroom was immaculate and the bathroom was the same, the shower was fantastic and the bed was very comfortable, the room came with a kettle and ironing board along with bathrobes and slippers. Would highly recommend this hotel as it's very relaxing and has very friendly and efficient staff. Big mention to Shane Kinsella for looking after us. Will definitely be back",4,2016,06,30
223,We'll be back,"This time we took a suite. Money well spent. Food was great. In the Park restaurant the three course meal was delicious and ample. Andrei and Christina were outstanding servers. The meals in the bar were very tasty. The Curry fish was one of the best fish dishes I have ever had. Spicy for some--Great for me. The burrito was also very tasty. I just wish they gave me a choice of sides, since I don't eat French fries. Breakfast had all I wanted. I don't do the eggs and Bacon but the fruit salad, salmon, etc. Satisfied me. The waffles were the best I have ever had--and I have been eating waffles for  about 80 years. There were only two kinds of sweet pastries for breakfast--both were among the best I have ever had. Omar, the breakfast waiter, was the most helpful and accommodating server I have ever experienced.
 I think that most hotel rooms are kept quite clean, but our housekeeper, a Lithuanian girl, brightened up the room with her smile and cheery personality. Andrew, the smiling bar manager was another friendly plus. 
Golf on weekdays was only 30 Euros--great course.",5,2016,06,30
223,To play golf ,This is a fine layout and will test all of your game. Not very long but you need to be straight and it's not all about long driving. The greens are very good. The 19th is very friendly and serves good food and drink if you require any. ,4,2016,06,29
223,"A nice, average hotel ","The highlight of the hotel would be the ample parking facilities, the spa and the smoking area. The food is nice but noting exceptional. Their air conditioning system is very poor. If seated under the system in the main banquet room you will be very cold and feeling unwell-not that this was a concern for the hotel staff. ",3,2016,06,29
223,Beautiful property,"My husband and I stayed here while visiting family for 2 weeks.  The hotel was beautiful.  It was clean, staff was friendly, food was good!  The rooms were cleaned daily, and cleaned well.  Everything was well kept! All around a great experience, we will stay here again!!",5,2016,06,26
223,Disappointed!,"We stayed here for a large family do recently. The hotel foyer is moderne and comfortable. However the reception we encountered when checking in was less than warm. Customer service was certainly not a priority! I hate to say it but the majority of the staff were abrupt if not rude. The rooms were of an average standard. We were kept awake all night by a loud machine (I presume a generator) outside our window. The food was lovely and beautifully presented, but again while the service was efficient, it was not inviting. The grounds are well kept and there is a small playground to keep the little ones entertained. The pool are is well attended to and nice for a dip! All in all though I wont be going back. Customer service is of utmost importance to me and we all felt this was lacking here. ",3,2016,06,26
223,Perfect hotel,We have been to this hotel several times and love it. It is beautiful and a perfect location if you want to go shopping in blanchardstown which is about 10 minutes drive from here. The food is beautiful and the staff are friendly. We have been here as a couple with our daughter so the hotel is ideal to faciltate whatever your trip. Would highly recommend here.,5,2016,06,24
223,The ultimate experience,This was a great example of customer experience at the highest level. The staff were superb.......friendly and helpful without being over familiar. The Restaurant was spacious and well laid out. The temperature and air conditioning on warm days (outside) was controlled. The barbecue facilities on our second day was excellent.,5,2016,06,23
223,ok,This hotel was OK. Was here on business so didn't try to get into Dublin city centre. The room looked nice but the big generator outside the window made it sound like I was trying to go to sleep on a plane. And pretty sure it woke me up in the morning too.,3,2016,06,19
223,Wedding,"We had our wedding reception in the Castleknock Hotel last week & it was absolutely perfect! Amazing day from start to finish. In particular our wedding coordinator Lorraine Coyle was amazing - she couldn't do enough for us & made the planning & organising so easy & stress free. 

Thank you so much Lorraine & all the staff at the castleknock hotel who were all equally as helpful & friendly, it was certainly a day we will never forget and I would highly recommend any future bride & grooms to check it out!

Can't wait to go back already! 

Kind regards 

Lynn & Tom",5,2016,06,15
223,Afternoon Tea with Prosecco,"My mother, two sisters and I had afternoon tea on Saturday 11th June as a birthday treat. The room that the tea is held in is really beautiful - blue and white - very elegant. There were only two other tables having afternoon tea so we were very much waited on hand and foot by the lovely waiter. The food was lovely; good selection of sandwiches, scones and desserts all very fresh and delicious. A lovely place for those who enjoy afternoon tea. 
The afternoon tea runs from 2-5 so we took the last of our prosecco and moved out to the lounge area at 5. There is a very relaxed atmosphere in the lounge area and it was very busy, but be prepared for slow service. We have been going here for years and we have had many family functions here too so I don't want this to come across too harsh but the service is always slow in the lounge and restaurant. Slow sometimes to the point of mildly irritating - it has always been my experience every time I've gone but the staff are lovely and I keep going back.",4,2016,06,15
223,Simply amazing !! ,"Amazing service ! Amazing amenities ! Comfy beds! Amazing food and restaurants!  Great massage! If you want a nice place to unwind and relax this is it ! We got an early check in , our bags were waiting for us in our rooms !! Didn't even have to ask .  Staff goes above and beyond ! Thank you Castleknock staff for an amazing stay!  Only improvement would be A/C in the rooms . But we really didn't need it during our stay . 
",5,2016,06,15
223,Disappointing.,I was at the afters of a wedding. The 'buffet' was served after a long wait. The selection of food left a lot to be desired. It really was disgusting. There was not enough food for the amount of guests in attendance. All of the dirty used plates and glasses were left on the tables until the room was vacated at 2.am. The service was so bad that I stacked the dirty plates on my table. Would advise against weddings as they already have the money.,2,2016,06,13
223,family celebration,"Had the pleasure of attending a family celebration 5th june in this lovely hotel.
our first visit and it will not be the last.
welcome from the arrival by very efficient and courteous staff.
Food excellent and plenty for the hungry.
Lovely setting and well worth a visit.
Swimming pool and spa, golf course.",4,2016,06,06
223,Short visit,I arrived very late and left after breakfast so I couldn't really enjoy all the facilities of the hotel but everything looked really nice. the staff were very helpful! I arrived very late and my check-in was already half done waiting mainly for my signature. this was so nice as I was very tired and it took only a few minuted before I got my room key. The room was spacious and nice and there were machined for soft drinks and snacks near the elevators which was also very nice.,4,2016,06,05
223,Quick overnight visit ,"My husband was attending a course here so was booked in for the night before. I decided to get a night away so travelled there to meet him. The hotel was very welcoming with friendly staff & good food. The room was spacious & bright with very comfortable furnishing. They offered a super breakfast with lots of fresh fruit, yogurts, peanut butter etc & a full irish. I can happily recommend it as either a family or couples hotel. ",5,2016,06,02
223,Dublin Weekend Break,"I shared a triple room with 2 friends.  We had plenty of space in the room, beds were very comfortable and everyone slept very well.  Breakfast was great, staff were extremely helpful and friendly. Small touches such as our bags being taken up to the room for us, and our request for an additional hair dryer for the room being attended to straight away really made our stay very comfortable.  Lovely pool area with steam room and sauna.  Yes it is a bit further out from the city centre, but you can catch the no 37 bus to McConnell street for 3 euros, so not too bad really!",4,2016,06,01
223,Great alternative to Dublin city,"I work in hospitality an can be critical at the best of times but I stayed in castleknock last week as an alternative to staying in the city centre as it becomes quite monotonous staying once a week in Dublin ...
Castleknock was a pleasant surprise staff were friendly, more so than in the city centre. 
The standard of accommodation was good I had a nice room all be it overlooking the carpark but I'm sure nicer views of their golf course are available.
Leisure club staff were particularly pleasant I was greeted by a man who gave me a towel and took the time to explain where the changing rooms were etc.
Breakfast was quick and easy just what I needed.
Only negative point; the jacuzzi was cold but I was told this was in hand and I'm not surprised given my general impression of this property.
I'd definitely look at staying here again in the future 
",5,2016,05,31
223,Attended Wedding,"Amazing Hotel, the staff were all fantastic, they could not do enough for you. I had a problem signing into the Internet, the man on reception was great he straight away got me signed in. The food was excellant, breakfast was great lots of choices, they ran out of bacon we asked for ,more and even brought it to us at the table. Could not fault this Hotel and Country Club.",5,2016,05,31
223,Irish trip,Stayed 2 nights at this hotel with a group of Australian. It's good value and efficient. Good friendly staff . Difficult to commute to Dublin city if you have no car and a bit tricky to find coming from airport. But better value than most city hotels. A courtesy bus would be a suggestion.  ,4,2016,05,29
223,Lovely Family Event,"Just back from a lovely family event in the Park restaurant. Great food, nice ambience (cool covers of classics), and excellent service. Simon and Cristina (and the rest of the staff) were superb. Hats off to them as they did everything to make our dinner /event enjoyable.",4,2016,05,27
223,Relaxing Hotel Close to Dublin City,"Don't stay in the hustle and bustle of Dublin city, stay just outside at Castleknock Hotel and Country Club. The hotel is located about 6 miles (15 mins) and an easy drive into Dublin city center. It is set in the stunning grounds of a golf course. The hotel is lovely, the rooms are very large and everything is spotless. The bathrooms are large and have a shower and tub.The hotel's bar and family restaurant overlooks the golf course and is an absolutely fabulous place to relax and enjoy a Guiness or good wine after a day of sightseeing. Andrew the Assistant Bar Manager is fabulous and we loved to end our days sitting at the bar chatting with him. The breakfast buffet in the morning is excellent. Next time we are in Dublin we will definitely return to Castleknock Hotel.",5,2016,05,25
223,Family celebration,"Once again Castleknock Hotel ticks all the boxes, I live very near the hotel so we use if for different reasons, family celebrations and when we have family who need to stay nearby they book in here.  Yesterday we had a confirmation so we had 8 adults and 10 children, The meal was fabulous in the restaurant, staff so helpful too.  The gardens were amazing, they even had large games outside, chess, draughts, connect 4 and more, I cannot recommend this hotel more highly.  My sister got married there last summer and again, we cannot fault the attention to detail, the courteous manner of all the staff and food and atmosphere, nothing seems to be too much to ask for.  My son has a peanut allergy and they go out of their way to help with this too.",5,2016,05,25
223,Perfect family get togethet.,Had a fantastic family get together this weekend everything was perfect. Staff were very helpful rooms met all our needs our meal in the Park Restaurant was amazing. Reception staff were very friendly and efficient a special mention for Andrew in the bar he was extremely professional and very observant of our needs. We will definitely be returning.,5,2016,05,22
223,Work was a pleasure with good leisure,"I was booked into this hotel by my organisation who I was delivering some training for in Ireland, as I usually stay in Travelodge accommodation in England this was a welcome treat.  The leisure facilities were good and the swimming pool, steam room and Jacuzzi was excellent and it really did make for a relaxing break even though I was working my only complaint the cake bar in the lobby ran out of cake to quickly so for two days I craved some chocolate cake but never actually got to taste any.  The rooms were clean & tidy and I would stay here again. Some of the staff could do with customer services training although not rude the standard of service did not match the hotel as a couple of times I asked staff for certain information and they could not tell me but made no offer to find out.  I would expect a hotel of this standard to have efficient members of staff with the highest level of customer services.",4,2016,05,19
223,Old Friends together again,"Very beautiful grounds and hotel itself is up to date and modern.  We were a little disappointed with our room as we had bought a triple room but the room was only set out as a double... ie towels cups coffee soaps shampoo etc.   The breakfast was very disappointing.  Our breakfast table was initially a recreation tale in another bar area and very unsuitable to eat at...we asked to be moved to a suitable table and when we were the table was laid out but the six mugs were dirty :(  We asked for clean mugs and got them.
Overall the hotel staff were very lovely.",3,2016,05,18
223,Great stay,Stayed here for four nights with my girlfriend. Out of town but that made the holiday away from the hustle and bustle of the city centre but only a 30 min bus ride or 15 min cab in. Definitely recommend. Only bit that could be improved is slightly quicker service at the bar but we were on holiday so this didn't matter,4,2016,05,17
223,Splendid Venue for Family Communion,"We decided to have our twin daughters' Communion lunch at the Castleknock Hotel and we were delighted with the quality of service our guests received.

Throughout the planning the team were flexible and amenable to our requests to help accommodate the party of 30; the food and service in the Park Restaurant was excellent; and Simon & the team then made every effort to keep our girls and their guests feel special and welcomed.

Recommended for family events and we will enjoy returning in the near future!",5,2016,05,17
223,Vacation,"The hotel was very nice. The staff was friendly and helpful. The rooms were nice and the beds were comfortable. The bathrooms have heated floor tiles. The room service food was good. Golf course within walking distance. The bar was fun with live entertainment. Bar staff was very friendly. Breakfast was very good, good variety.",5,2016,05,16
223,Potential but service poor,"Stayed for 3 days on business. Rooms are good. But overall the hotel feels understaffed and some of those that are there are not the most helpful. 

The business meeting rooms are ok and breakfast was good",3,2016,05,12
223,Grace's Communion,"We attended a communion on Sunday 8th May in the Tower room 
To say we had a fantastic day is an understatement. From the time we arrived at the hotel we were met with extremely nice staff. We were made very welcome.
Our meal was outstanding and the waiting staff went above and beyond to help us enjoy our day. Any special requirement we made was catered for.

I would highly recommend the Castleknock Hotel for any function. 

Marie Eccles",5,2016,05,10
223,Communion,Attended a communion meal for my niece on Sunday 8th of may in the tower suite...The room was beautifully laid out; the staff were very friendly and couldn't do enough for us.  The food was out standing  piping hot  and served promptly ...the hotel bedroom itself was lovley and was spotless and the bed was definitely the highlight as you could of slept 5 people in it ..over all we had an fantastic day and night at the castleknock hotel and would definitely recommend the hotel to anyone ,5,2016,05,10
223,Communion,Can't say thank you enough for the  reception you  gave us from the minute we walked through the door to the service for our dinner to the waiting staff reception and bar staff absolutely fantastic my daughter had a fantastic day she is still on high so from me my wife family and friends thank you for you hospitality.And a special thank you to Luke and Elena who look after our every need thank you so much,5,2016,05,09
223,Lovely out of town hotel........,"I spent two nights here whilst on business. Check in was straight forward and my room had a huge bed which was comfortable. It was clean and well maintained, as was the bathroom which had a shower and a separate tub. It was lovely and sunny during my stay and my room did get a bit too warm and I had to open the window to cool it down as I couldn't work out how to turn the heating down. The spa facilities looked good but I didn't get time to use them. The staff were great all very helpful and friendly. We had lunch on the terrace in the sunshine which was lovely. The hotel is a few kilometres from the city centre but that wasn't an issue as we didn't go into the centre but visited restaurants nearby. Breakfast was buffet style and had something for everyone, only complaint would be that the toaster machine could do with replacing.......very dark brown one side, white the other!! All in all a good stay.",4,2016,05,08
223,Impressive room! ,"Visited here for  one night with the other half to relax.  The room was very well decorated,  clean and comfortable with water provided. Food was very good and the pool and spa facilities were very relaxing.  Overall,  I was impressed with this hotel. ",4,2016,05,03
223,Nice looking hotel ,The hotel it's self is fab ! Rooms lovely decorated ! Only some tellys are smart which is a bit disappointing! Spa and swimming pool are lovely. My let down is the breakfasts it's self service. It's just not nice ! You even have to make your own toast and paying ‚Ç¨300 for 2 nights b&b I think your breakfast should be made fresh and handed to you. Very disappointed with this. Also the restaurantand bar food are not good for a plain Jane eater. I really struggled with their menus.  ,4,2016,05,02
223,Relaxing as always and super speedy wifi,"Stayed here for 2 nights when we brought the children up to watch the Ireland/Slovakia match.  
We had 2 bedrooms next to each other and I can't fault either. Maintained to a very high standard and as always, lovely and clean.   
Amazed at the speed of the wifi.  Never experienced anything so fast.....the kids were delighted too as they could all use the Internet without it crashing. Happy kids=happy parents.
Breakfast in the restaurant was full of choice, especially for my daughter who's vegetarian. The staff are all very friendly. 
We had a lovely surprise in the room on the 2 days of little salted caramel chocolates and fruit.
Can't wait for our next stay :0)",5,2016,05,01
223,Very noisy,"We stayed at this hotel last night. We were given room 105. The room was fine, a good size and a proper double bed and a single for our six year old daughter.  The bathroom was clean and there is both a bath and a separate shower.  So far so good.  We went to the swimming pool and we thought it was great.  The pool was warm and there is a separate pool for small children.  There is also a Jacuzzi, sauna and steam room.  We really enjoyed our time at the leisure club. 

We went out to eat at TGI Fridays at the nearby Blanchardstown shopping centre. It is only 5 minutes away.  We liked the location as it was near to the amenities but you felt like you were in the countryside.  

Now comes the bad part. I must have woken up at least 10 times in the night.  There was noise from the downstairs bar area when the door at the end of the corridor was opened.  There was also the noise of the other residents going down the corridor.  But the worst thing was the strange and prolonged noise at 4am.  At first I thought it was someone moving their suitcase but as it went on I realised it couldn't be that.  My husband thinks it was the heating and other people have mentioned the generator so maybe it was that.  It sounded like someone dragging along a metal trolley.  When we were checking out the receptionist did ask me if everything was ok.  When I told her about the noise in the night she asked me if I had phoned the night reception about it and I told her we had not. This was our mistake.  I wish we had kicked up the biggest fuss possible in hindsight. Instead of apologising anyway she said I should have phoned reception in the middle of the night so they could have done something about it.  I would really love to know what they would have done about it, I will never know.  I came away really annoyed because she made me feel like it was my own fault I had a bad nights sleep.  

The breakfast was OK but I have had better at a Premier Inn.  Also some of the dishes were not replenished while we were there.  It is a shame because we have been to a lot of hotels and we really loved the leisure centre but due to the noise and the attitude of the receptionist it has put us off returning to this hotel or recommending it to anyone.",3,2016,05,01
223,Relaxing stay,"Checking in was busy but only took few minutes...room lovely looking over golf course. Room 276 
Breakfast plentiful (staff not very friendly) 
But all in all we'd be back.
Haven't eaten in hotel restaurant but looks well priced. 
Thanks for relaxing staff...cleaning staff lovely ",5,2016,05,01
223,Fantastic ,"Amazing time had. We had afternoon tea and it was stunning. We also ate in the restaurant. The food was amazing. I found our room a little small but this would not put me off. Lovely hotel I'll definitely be back
",5,2016,05,01
223,Lovely golf course a n restaurant,Here for the first society outing of the year and what a day. The course as usual is beautiful and very challenging which we love. It was a lovely day which helped to make this day great. Then up to the restaurant with the spectacular views through the full size Windows. Anybody is welcome to this restaurant not just the golfers and you won't be disappointed. The staff are friendly and efficent and the food excellent and reasonably priced. Just a perfect day.,5,2016,04,30
223,Dublin vacation ,"We enjoyed our stay at the hotel , the staff was very friendly . Initially they gave us a room looking at the parking lot but they were nice enough to change it to a golf view . Without any extra charge . The room is clean and bathroom is very good . However the bed was uncomfortable , they had 2 single beds connected together to form one king bed üò¨. The bar is nice and nice music on weekends , the bartender has a strong accent , didn't understand anything !! Pool and jacuzzi area is beautiful . ",4,2016,04,27
223,Excellent stay,The hotel is fantastic and all of the staff are so helpful and friendly. the breakfast was also to a high standard. We would recommend the hot stones massage.,5,2016,04,27
223,Good conference hotel - shame about the sandwiches!,"Just back from a conference held here over 4 days so plenty of time to test the amenities! Delighted to be able to check in before 10am - very helpful receptionist. Room was big (massive bed!) and very clean. Possibly a little tired in decor but not much time spent in there anyway. No view, other than the car park. 

Conference rooms were well equipped but either too hot or too cold and there were various issues with AV equipment. Presumably booked by the conference organisers, lunch was soup and sandwiches every day. And the exact same sandwiches every day too! Got really boring. But a small niggle, I guess. Breaks were well catered and on time with plenty of good coffee and snacks.

Breakfast was buffet style but plentiful and a good selection to suit a mainly European crowd. Room service dinner one night was HUGE (even the starters) but quite pricey  AND with a tray service charge. 

Obviously a very busy hotel with big family parties also in evidence so it has to cater to a wide range of visitors. Didn't get a chance to use the pool etc but got good reports.",4,2016,04,26
223,Bar staff,We stayed there last night lovely hotel rooms lovely but was woke at seven this morning with a fan  right out side our window it was very noicey but we met a really nice bar man he was a pleasure to talk to his name was Dylan he had a super personality   great worker  he knows his job he was by far the nicest member of staff we met  hotel near nowhere 25 in a taxi into city  Brenda,3,2016,04,25
223,"Friendly, courteous staff","Myself and my husband celebrated an anniversary recently by staying in Castleknock Hotel and Country Club for dinner, bed and breakfast. From the moment we checked in we were so delighted with the friendly, efficient service we received.  We had a beautiful room with a big en-suite and everything was spotlessly clean.  Our meal in the restaurant that night was terrific - much better than I would normally expect in a hotel restaurant.  Again the waiting staff were so helpful, pleasant and friendly!  

Our delight was complete when the bar manager sent us over two complimentary glasses of bubbles when he heard it was an anniversary. 

We will definitely be returning.",5,2016,04,25
223,Nice hotel,"Nice hotel with lovely grounds and atmosphere.
Nice pool.
Good hotel for phoenix park concerts. Ten mins in taxi.
20 euro taxi into dublin so be prepared. Bring the sat nav.
Try anglers rest for food in the evening. 5 mins in car away.",5,2016,04,24
223,Nice Family Getaway :-),"Arrived back from a great 2 days here. Hotel is fab, very clean and well maintained. Staff are great, very helpful especially Alex on reception. Pool was so nice and warm which is great with kids. Also a playground at the back for the kids to play and the weather was fab so Our little lad got loads of use out it. Again it is well maintained, they offer blankets for the terrace area  which is great for when it gets chilly in the evening. Great idea. We didnt eat here as we were away both nights at things but we did have snacks and drinks and they were fab. Will def be back and cant wait :-)",5,2016,04,24
223,Top marks,"We got a deal (B&B and dinner)  and it was as if we had paid full price.  The room, the food and service were all top drawer.. We were especially impressed with the standard of the room.  Cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.",5,2016,04,23
223,General feedback,"Excellent stay.. staff so welcoming.  Shane the restaurant manager a gent, a credit to the hotel.  Can't complain about anything .. wish I wasn't here on business as would love to use the facilities. .. will Def come again with the family next time. .",5,2016,04,21
223,Nice hotel but sub standard service ,"Very nice hotel, I stay here 3 or 4 times a year while working in the area. However the service is very poor in the bar and restaurant and despite some changes being made it hasn't improved over the last year or so. For me the service doesn't match the price of stay. All other facilities are great but big improvements needed in service before I would call this hotel 4 star or recommend to others unfortunately.",3,2016,04,21
223,Why insurance companies shouldn't run hotels,"My colleagues and I stayed here the night if the IFA ballot. Despite explaining that we were flying from the US and would be arriving at 5am our colleagues room had been given to someone else and he was forced to sleep on a sofa. There then began an unbelievably bad and continued sub standard service for the next 2 days. To add insult to injury the manager then proceeded to charge my colleague for the night that they gave his room to someone else. Unbelievable, and an embarrassment to hospitality trade in Ireland. We won't be returning to this venue for conferences or workshops at any point in the future.",1,2016,04,20
223,Top Notch!,"Castleknock is a very good place to stay, the food in the main restaurant cannot be faulted. The rooms are clean and quiet, the staff are very friendly. Theres a great leisure facility and a golf course.",5,2016,04,20
223,Nice hotel,"This is a nice hotel, the rooms are lovely all recently redone. There was a good selection of food for breakfast but the hot food wasn't great.",4,2016,04,20
223,Not a 4* Hotel,"Booked a two night stay with two children. Room was small, no air con, only two towels for a family of four, had to ring down for face cloths, dust on the shelves, travel cot broken so our baby slept in her pram, carpet looked like it had just been cut and placed down as it was ravelled up around the edges of the door. Service was slow at dinner. Our child's vegetables arrived just as we were leaving having sat there for some time. To use the swimming pool you have to cross through the lobby and there is not much space in the changing rooms to leave a pram. 
Overall, not a hotel I would be likely to return to.",3,2016,04,15
223,Afternoon tea was lovely,"5 stars for the fantastic and talented massage therapist Emer - highly recommend her for a Hot Stone Back Massage. And the Afternoon Tea was really special - in the beautiful restaurant far away from the busy, noisy bar and lobby area. Everything for the afternoon tea was delicious and fantastic service too. Great place for a treat. However, in the spa, there was no dedicated relaxation room, it was a relaxation room/waiting room with shower/toilet/changing rooms opening into it so very busy. ",5,2016,04,11
223,Family accommodation for wedding,"Very nice hotel in good location adjacent to wedding reception venue. Very pleasant staff and very efficient. Some minor issues with language difficulties. Very good breakfast offering, somewhat spoiled by tables not being cleared off quickly enough to allow more guests to sit down, seemed to be staff shortage.
Very comfortable bedrooms with all amenities, large screen TVs and good quality beds and pillows. Good experience overall.",4,2016,04,11
223,Delightful Afternoon Tea,"Was very impressed with the afternoon tea in the Castleknock Hotel. It's served in the restaurant and I loved the room, it was very bright, spacious with lovely decor. 
Service was very friendly and prompt. It wasn't your typical afternoon tea with cucumber sambos etc, which I loved. Everything was so tasty. You certainly won't leave hungry, we left a couple of items and they wrapped them up for us. For a Saturday the price was very reasonable at ‚Ç¨24. 
The restaurant was busy but we didn't feel rushed in any way. 
Why didn't I give it a 5 out of 5? The tea was a bit weak and didn't taste great! 
Would certainly recommend it for couples or a group. ",4,2016,04,11
223,Pleasant overnight stay,Had a brief stay here recently. Did not get a chance to sample the leisure facilities but the hotel itself was quite pleasant. Lovely bar/restaurant area and the room was very comfortable with a nice large double-bed. Ordered some coffees while mingling in the foyer on the Sunday morning and service was a bit slow but staff in general were very friendly and welcoming.,4,2016,04,11
223,Amaz will defiantly visit again,We arrived on April the third and the staff were very helpful with our bags.Although we were giddy twenty year old girls going for a hens party they loved having us stay and we loved staying.The pool was perfect and don't get me started on the food the hens was so good we had the wedding in the near by church and after we stayed in the hotel so I don't have a clue what all these complaints are about I thought it was b√¶,5,2016,04,08
223,Tonic Spa Day,"This was a gift for spa treatments and lunch. Very dissapointed in it. When checking in the water jug was empty and while filling out the usual health form, asked for water and was told we had to wait until we were upstairs in the spa. Not a good start. The relaxation room was literally 2 hotel bedrooms knocked together. Changing area was very small in the toilet. Small lockers had been put in the toilet but really having to change in a toilet cubicle wasn't nice. This gave us a very bad impression to start. We used the pool before our treatments which was nice but quite a long walk. The 2 girls who gave the treatments were lovely but the overall impression wasn't good. We certainly wouldn't return. Down to the bar for lunch which wasn't busy but we waited over an hour for our sandwiches. We definitely wouldn't recommend this to our friends.",3,2016,04,08
223,Few things ruined my stay ,Stayed sun 3rd April .when  I booked I said it was our anniversary and wife birthday so a nice room with view or anything would be appreciated but that did not happen I stayed in room 106 .I was looking out at a roof .I went down to reception and just asked a the reception any chance of other room he was fairly ignorant and just said no shocked .I was embarrassed .anyway the radiator would not turn off so that night had to leave window open and the noise of generator on roof let's just say no sleep .anyway break away from 3 kids for relaxing night did not happen .checking out was going tell the reception but she did not ask how was your stay she just said your paid up have nice day.asked about restaurant on checking in for dinner for booking he said it's around the corner .no information on arrival.so we went out for dinner .bar was friendly and lunch was nice .I worked in heritage golf and spa for 7 years I was bar manager for 5 so I know hotels .that was not 4 star .hate to complain but that's my stay ,3,2016,04,04
223,Kid friendly,"Clean, helpful staff, not overpriced. Gym, pool good. Room quite hot and no aircon. Restaurant service bit slow. Kids playroom is great idea but only seems to be open weekends . Playground good. Would probably struggle without a car. Handy for phoenix park. ",4,2016,04,04
223,Tonic health and day Spa,"Staff we're really friendly, we arrived 10 mins early before our treatment we we're taken up to relaxation room we we're both given robes and slippers to get changed into and we then told they where running behind by 10 mins but the girl was apologetic. We booked in for a neck shoulder and back massage but the girls taught we we're booked in for something else but they adjusted to the mix up quickly. The girls where confident in the treatment which you need when getting a massage. Would highly recommend this spa. Very relaxing. Treatment was so nice and enjoyable. ",5,2016,04,03
223,Only for the suite and bar staff it was a nice stay,"It was our first wedding anniversary and we booked to stay in one of the suites in the hotel. When we arrived the reception girl seemed uninterested and literally just checked us in gave our room card and that was it. No other information. I asked her about our breakfast which was included in our package and our dinner but she said dinner wasnt included. Then we went to our room which i must say was gorgeous and very very comfortable to sleep in. I asked the girl later as we were passing reception about dinner being included and she again said no. I then had to dig out my email with booking.com which said dinner was included it was a 3 course meal. I went back to reception and spoke with another girl and showed her the email, she apologised and said yes that is right dinner is included. I was very annoyed because we payed alot of money for one night and if i didnt go back to reception we would have payed double for our dinner. Only for the room was lovely and the bar staff were lovely that made up for everything else. Very disappointing stay overall considering and not one mention of our first wedding anniversary. I wouldnt go back. ",3,2016,04,03
223,Nice Hotel,"Stayed in this hotel on good friday, checked in early on good friday ( about 1pm) was allocated room 102 the room had a terrible view but we're happy to accept this as we were checking in early and no other room at that stage was available and we were not going to spend a whole lot of time in the room.  The room other than the view was nice, bright and modern and had sky sports tv channels.
Was heading to the city for the day but leaving the car in the hotel car park even though the hotel is located near the M50 motorway and a great location if your driving it is not served well by public transport.  Returned late that evening to the bar and enjoyed a few drinks in the lobby and later in the bar. Breakfast the following morning was excellent and the quality and choice of foods were brilliant.",4,2016,04,02
223,Great Hotel,"Great hotel lovely rooms with large pool & spa facilities. Great location to greater Dublin area and M50 motorway. Wide range of breakfast available, and evening meal in the restaurant was excellent - early bird menu available before 7pm",5,2016,03,25
223,Part time pool for residents,"Booked online for just one night. I had my three teenage sons with me aged 13,15,17. The hotel is very nicely appointed with spacious rooms and a nice communal area. Our main criteria for choosing this hotel was the spa and swimming pool. Check in staff were very efficient and welcoming.but when I inquired about the pool they, with some embarrassment, told me that the pool was closed to ""children"" from 6pm. Fair enough I said, my boys are all in their teens I said. ........No, ""children"" means under 18. ?!?

What a load of utter nonsense. You advertise a pool and then make it unavailable to residents under 18 after 6pm? If this is stated on the website then it is not clearly stated IN BIG BOLD LETTERS! 

I have never stayed at a hotel with such a ridiculous restriction, There must be a better way of appeasing the health club members without totally misleading potential overnight guests,",2,2016,03,24
223,It was a relaxing stay,"We stayed here in February for two nights, the room was lovely and comfortable, pity though the bed was two beds pushed together to make one big bed! 

The room was spotless and the bathroom was very clean and the hotel was tastefully decorated and modern. 

We ate in the restaurant the first night, it was a lovely meal and a nice ambience. They only thing I wasn't happy about was the delay in the vegetables coming out, I had to ask about them as it felt as the waiter had forgotten about the vegetables. 

The bar was stylish and comfortable, although service could be improved as it was quiet slow. 

The swimming pool is lovely and big and really nice spot to relax in. ",4,2016,03,22
223,Wonderful Wedding,"Beautiful venue for my cousins wedding.  Excellent location not to far from the city, fantastic facilities, Great  food and friendly helpful staff.  Will definitely recommend and hopefully return again",5,2016,03,21
223,Lovely experience,"I recently had dinner in the Park Restaurant with my in-laws on a Friday night in February. We were looked after so well. Christina our waitress was lovely, she was so helpful and cheerful and nothing was too much trouble. I must also mention Andrew, one of the Managers, who went out of his way to make us feel welcome & made a special very impressive non-alcoholic cocktail for my husband's teenage daughter. Later, we retired to the lobby, where he looked after us, and the guy playing music was excellent! Overall, an enjoyable night",5,2016,03,16
223,Afternoon tea,"Had a lovely Mothers Day afternoon tea here and they catered extremely well for Coeliacs.  The place was as expected given the day, very full, lots of children, but the staff kept things quietly under control.  Only query - why dress the room, tables and chairs so beautifully and have all the TVs on the walls on and showing a football match? They detracted from the ambience.  There were lots of places outside the room to watch Sports TV.  Thanks to the waitress who did switch the one at our table off when asked to do so.",4,2016,03,16
223,Rip off room service!,"Having previously enjoyed meals and drinks at this venue I opted to stay there for my week long vacation in Dublin.  Unfortunately the hotel did not meet my requirements.  The tray service charge of Eu6.50 was exorbitant and shocking.  As I had planned to avail of in room dining every night it proved unsuitable for my requirements. Despite the comfortably appointed rooms, good breakfast and pleasant environment my trip was marred by the particular service I needed being charged at this rate.  There are all of two floors in the building and they want to charge this cost for a deliver up one flight of stairs??? I had high expectations and was very disappointed.",3,2016,03,15
223,Really good will visit again.,"Stayed this weekend for a match in Dublin.

Found the hotel really good. Excellent staff and very good facilities. The steam room is particularly good.

The hotel is about a 15 minute taxi out of the City Centre. While that has the down side of a taxi, you can in the morning sit out and have coffee by the golf course.

It gives a feeling of a rural hotel while close to Dublin.

All in all and excellent hotel and I will stay again.",5,2016,03,14
223,Bad Service,"I have been to Castleknock before with grand kiddies and had a great time. Busy day at the zoo and then onto Castleknock for dinner, swimming and the usual had a great time. This time round I recommended my husbands company for a Managers getaway over this weekend. What a disaster for us. Arrrived around 1pm there was quite a wait and queue at the reception desk, was told  room was not ready which was no problem to us as we were watching the rugby all afternoon. Half time checked in got our room and walked into on someone else's allocated room, Back to down to reception and after a long wait and long queue AGAIN explained there was someone in our allocated room. Waited for 5 minutes to have another room, made sure with the receptionist it was an upgraded double executive room which we had paid for earliar and she confirmed this so trotted back of to our new room. Got to the room again superior room but no upgrade which we paid for and SINGLE beds. By now missing my rugby match, getting more cross and trotted back down to reception, Another long queue and by this time steam was coming outta my ears. Eventually spoke to the receptionist and she confirmed she would get the bed made up to a double. By now I just wanted to go home and felt so very disappointed as I had such a great experience before.
By 5pm room still wasn't made up, I didn't get resting in our room and our dinner was booked for 7.30.
Came back to the room at 6.30 to get ready for dinner the bed was made up but absolutely no extras in room to go along with my paid upgrade. Back down to reception and by then I just asked the receptionist to upgrade us to a suite and I would pay. After about 5 minutes she declared there were no suites available. I still think this is untrue but I could be wrong. Actually I should have been more demanding but by then I had just had enough. My husband's company spent an absolute fortune on this night away booking 9 superior rooms and dinner, spent a mint on alcohol and may I say Castleknock have just lost this yearly reoccurring business. Dinner was very poor, very limited menu. Be careful if you book the overnight and dinner included it really isn't worth the money. Two of our party had to send their main back and they came out of that restaurant hungry. Twice their steak went back!! They were compensated with free wine etc but when you pay for dinner you expect to eat dinner not drink extra wine!!! The attitude of the staff were you are on the stay one night and evening meal deal - what do you want. Well food fit to eat would be good.
 Breakfast was ok although had to ask for our tea three times. It came when we had finished eating our breakfast. Services has deteriorated so much since my last visit. I feel I had to write this to make the management aware of our stay. Apparently the upgrade I paid for is to refunded to me but I haven't received this yet, but will pursue as I really do feel very strongly about this. Feel quite sad as I used to rave about this hotel to all my friends. But no more.
Am currently awaiting the General Managers email address from the hotel to write directly too.",2,2016,03,14
223,Amazing service,"My fianc√© proposed to me in this hotel and the staff went above and beyond to make it a memorable Occassion, they ensured we had the entire restaurant to ourselves and brought out  compliment champagne  and a cake to say congratulations! We stayed in the bridal suite as we were upgraded and that was also fabulous with amazing views of the golf course! Thanks again ",5,2016,03,12
223,Terrible Experiance,"I went to Castleknock at the weekend for a hen party. We had organised a spa day with evening meal. we arrived 20 minutes late and rang when we knew we would be late and still there was a mess up with the Spa. we were told we would only receive one treatment even though we had paid for two. There was 20 of us in our party and the fact that we were all due one hour treatments and we were all loosing out on one did not make sense, After a lot if discussion we got our two treatments. We were given times and told to me ready for them times. NO ONE was take on time, In fact I was told 3 o'clock and I was completely forgotten about. i waiting until 5 before I was thought about i then only got one treatment as I had to get ready for dinner. 
Dinner was another disaster. We had it booked for 7.30pm and they were not ready to take us until 8.15pm the soup was cold the Pate had bones in it, one of the girls had ordered steak medium-well and it arrived late and rare. She was then given the steak 20 minutes after everyone else had eaten. trying to get a drink was impossible, it took half an hour and 3 times asking to get a jug of water. 
i would not recommend this hotel at all.",1,2016,03,10
223,A catalogue of errors,"Opted for the deluxe executive room because we wanted to treat ourselves and the receptionist had said it have beautiful views of the golf course and booked us in the dinner as it was included in the package. As you see from the photo below the room view was predominantly blocked by the roof structure and the pool ventilation system/air con was right beside our window so for the noisiness alone I rang up and asked could we change rooms. 

we waited half an hour for reception to get back to us and nothing so I rang down to tell them that we had dinner booked and they could find us there. When we arrived down for dinner it turns out reception had not booked us in...not a big deal we still got seated and was just asked for our room number. The manager found us during dinner and offered us a new room but had told us it was the far end of the hotel...again not a big deal once we had peace and quiet and it was to the same standard. Went up to the new room and the key cards they gave us were never activated... back down and up again and eventually we got into the new room where we were met with a smell of fresh cigarette smoke, at this point I had given in... we wasted most the evening either fretting about the room or moving room so we got our bags to leave because a relaxing evening wasn't happening. 

Manager then told us he had a suite available even though we had asked could we pay for one previous and told none were available, we reluctantly took the suite but just felt deflated we didn't bother using the spa ad just left the next morning. We booked breakfast to the room but one of the dishes was a club sandwich not the Full Irish we ordered. It just seemed that nothing the hotel endeavored to do was correct and just wasted our money and time.",1,2016,03,08
223,Great hotel,"I stayed in Castlerock Hotel and Country Club At the end of January with a few friends celebrating a 50th birthday the hotel was very good with a nice size room although the view from our room was overlooking a yard at the rear of the building, the breakfast was very good with a wide choice of dishes the only down side to the dinning room was underneath our table was very dirty from previous guests breakfast and as the table had to be set up to seat the six of us this should have been noticed by the staff and at least brushed up we had a great experience with our back and head massages and had a nice relax in the pool but overlooking the dining room experience I would stay at this hotel again as it was warm and comfortable with friendly staff.The food in the bar is very good and in my opinion very well priced. ",4,2016,03,05
223,Great stay for a Valentines getaway,"From the moment we arrived we were looked after by happy, friendly and pleasant members of staff. The room was lovely and spacious, the hotel is ideally located (nice quiet location and easy to find even if you're not from the area) and the food was beautiful. Whole heartedly recommend this hotel, and will certainly be revisiting.",5,2016,03,04
223,Girlie Night Away,"Myself and My best friend checked in the last Friday in January.  We had a great time.  Our twin room was big, plush and comfortable.  We had a beautiful Dinner in the Park Restaurant. Great choice on the menu and super wine collection.  We had a very relaxing dinner despite the restaurant been very busy.  Staff were great.  Afterwards we went to the Bar, Thanks to Sean for making a special Gin Cocktail.  The following day we had a lazy breakfast and chill out in the lobby.  Well done to Gael and all the team.",5,2016,03,01
223,4 Star Hotel with 5 Star Treatment!,"Stayed last Sunday night in Castleknock Hotel and had such a lovely stay.  Had a speedy check in when we arrived and got a room on the first floor, room was gorgeous big, bright and spotless with a great bed.  Headed down for dinner in The Park Restaurant and had a gorgeous meal after which went into the lobby/bar area where there was a great band on.  Really enjoyed sitting in the lobby listening to the great band and enjoyed a few drinks.  The staff in this hotel are excellent, breakfast the following morning was brilliant with great cold and hot food on offer with delicious breads/cakes.  I would thoroughly recommended this great hotel.",5,2016,03,01
223,Fantastic night,Stayed with A friend midweek. Could not fault the hotel in any way. Staff were amazing. Big hi to our friend Ciaran in the bar. The room was beautiful. The massage was so relaxing. The food was to die for. Recommend anyone to visit. Thank you for a fantastic night we will return,5,2016,02,26
223,honeymoon small break,"we went for a 1night b&b and dinner, the food for the dinner i wouldn't give to a dog it was a disgrace, wife went for the leg of lamb, leg of lamb to me is on a bone, (YES) this was a small square of meet (looked like dog food). and 1 small piece of mash, br went for breakfast to be sent to room, on arrivel at 9.30am, breakfast arrived, they charge ‚Ç¨6 charge to deliver to the room, but u have to pay the girl when she brings it up, we only new this when she was at the door she was still standing there? i had no cash on me only card, she said ok we will call to take payment over the phone, the girl was only gone and they had called to take payment, couldn't even enjoy my breakfast, i would never go back to this hotel, id never rec anyone to get married here, the rooms are very bad u can hear the grass grow in the rooms, the beds may swell be on the floor the mattress is that tin,we ended up having to order food in from a local chipper. spent a fortune here and disgusted , avoid this hotel.",1,2016,02,23
223,Wonderful Hotel,Stayed at this hotel for 2 nights just before Christmas 2015. Hotel is spotlessly clean and the staff were very friendly. Very good selection of breakfast items in the morning. Hotel bar was popular with both locals and guests. Excellent leisure facilities. Hotel is in a good location for Blanchardstown centre. Kildare outlet village and Dublin itself are easily accessable by car. Overall a very pleasent experience and would definately stay again.,5,2016,02,22
223,Great treatments with excellent beauty therapists,"We booked into the day spa for ‚Ç¨120 which included a massage, facial, manicure, pedicure, lunch and access to facilities and relaxation room. 

The treatments were great and the beauty therapists amazing! They really put you at ease and I felt very comfortable. I think my therapist was called Shauna who was absolutely lovely, really friendly and did a great job. Couldn't have asked for better.

The only small criticism I have is the lunch. We weren't given a menu and when we asked what was for lunch the waiter said it was a sandwich but we weren't given any options so ordering was a faff. He also messed up the orders by accidentally putting egg in all the sandwiches and instead of apologising whilst we waited for a new sandwich for my friend (who can't eat egg) informed us that actually all club sandwiches have egg in them. 

Except for that it was a lovely place. Beautiful views and very clean. We saw a wedding taking place there. Really enjoyed my experience. ",5,2016,02,20
223,Mid week break,We stayed in the above hotel for 2 nights very relaxing and had food on the 2nights . The  service and food in The Park  restaurant was great but we were disappointed with service in The Avenue bar waiting 2 long for food and over priced . The bedroom and hotel are well maintained and staff friendly . Would go back good location,4,2016,02,19
223,Lovely stay,Have stayed here twice now and is an amazing experience each time.  Have eaten in the restaurant and bar food and all was lovely.  They defiantly offer the best breakfast of all the hotels I have stayed in. Will definitely return,5,2016,02,18
223,Lovely break ,"Stayed here with our two children for a short break after Christmas. We had a really lovely time.  The staff are nice,  great leisure centre. We had dinner in the restaurant which was lovely. We also booked a babysitter who was really nice and the kids loved her. All in all, it's a lovely property off the beaten track. A very nice place and one I would recommend to others to try ",4,2016,02,18
223,Poor Hotel,"I have stayed at this Hotel on many occasions and its the same old story, reception staff pleasant, rooms clean, waiters/ waitresses not trained well enough. The food is poor and over priced, the menu has not changed in a long time ,portions small. The amazing thing is that if you ask for a desert after 9,30 in the evening the waiters/ waitresses reply ""I will have to see if the chef will serve it"" . its not worth staying here Crowne plaza is a better Hotel or the Carlton in Tyrellstown.",2,2016,02,17
223,Super service,Stayed here for 2 nights for a sales conference. Room was really comfortable . Breakfast was plentiful and a great choice . Ate lunch and dinner in the restaurant which was top quality for a hotel . Staff were really friendly too . Will definitely be back .,5,2016,02,17
223,"Great value, small room","I booked via Trivago and got a really good deal. I often stay in this Hotel and know that the standard room is really good and the suites are fantastic. However, I was landed in a small room. It had all the essentials and was well appointed and was great value for the money .Likewise, the breakfast was excellent. But note that you get what you pay for.. don't expect the very best if you are getting a great deal on the price.",5,2016,02,12
223,Family Wedding ,"Stay here a couple of months back at a family wedding. Was a fantastic night, everthing was up to standard and beyond expectations! I like to mention Elena for her great work and made it a night to remember and she went above and beyond to ensure out night was perfect! It was her professionalism that would make myselfand family members to book another event in the hotel! So thank you very much Elena ! GREAT WORK!!",5,2016,02,10
223,Needs Consistency,"Booked on line - everything appeared ok on confirmation email but on check in incorrect details on paperwork -  being given paperwork with another persons address and telephone number but my email address - unnerved me a little. When mentioned receptionist was completely nonplussed, drew a line through details and didn't seem that bothered. Room was lovely, Bar staff bit gruff and tried hard to sell by bottle as opposed to glass, Dinner was good and Chocolate Afternoon Tea delicious. Spa treatments gorgeous and Therapists friendly yet professional.",4,2016,02,10
223,Only ok.,"This hotel is only ok, it didn't have that ""wow factor"" that you expect when you pay big money for a weekend away. The food was very good and the staff are fine if not a bit to attentive, We wanted a quiet early evening drink in the Lime tree bar bit despite the fact that the doors were open and both TVs were on, we were told the bar was closed and asked to leave, that left a bad taste that never really left us during or stay.",3,2016,02,09
223,graet for a nice barke,just returned form there this weekend rugby weekend staff are great very helpful food good service fine room were very good with lots of room bathroom was a good size rooms spotless will be going back soon for a weekend brake,5,2016,02,09
223,Early dinner and spa treatments ,"Myself and  two friends met for dinner and some spa treatments .I was really looking forward  to meeting my friends as hadn't  seen since Christmas and having a one and a half  year  old couldn't  wait for the dinner and  treatments. Arrived  at 12.30 and 1.30 we decided to have  lunch  What a disappointment no chef behind  had to ask the manager where he was .cold plates Luke warm food mixed veg consisted of red onion, mushroom and  red pepper. We all had something  different and very disappointed. Very much over priced.All was not lost we had our spa to look forward  to ,I was looked after by Emmy and thoroughly enjoyed my pamper.My two  friends felt their therapists just didn't  want to  be there and spent more  time in the bathroom. 
Two unhappy  customers. 
We decided  to have  some coffee  before we left sadly the  milk in our cappuccinos were cold ,my friend returned them to the  bar and we waited for them again.wouldn't  recommend the food or service. ",2,2016,02,08
223,Working tri[ to Dublin,"Very nice hotel and ideal for any work location in West Dublin. Nice quiet hotel with good bar food. Excellent leisure Centre to help unwind and friendly staff.
Would recommend it.
You would need a car or else you will be using Taxi's as not much within walking distance.",4,2016,02,08
223,Expected Better for Price,"Recently Stayed and expected more for ‚Ç¨250 plus family overnight room rate.

Bedrooms were not clean, very dusty , windows not washed in a long time, as someone else mentioned overlooking bins with a bright light throughout the night.

Breakfast : Again for price expected a lot more, breakfast room spread throughout two areas, put in an adjoining bar area sitting at a reclining armchair type seat not at all suitable for breakfast, some table settings were literally adjacent to food service area.

Had little contact with staff but appeared friendly, didn't have time to use leisure centre.

Overall much better value for money can be found in Dublin",3,2016,02,08
223,Fine - Lovely food; OK room and facilities.,"This hotel is fine -- very good in some aspects, mediocre in others. Given the hotel's rating and price it really should have been very good for everything. We stayed as a family as we were attending an event in the area (weekend booking). The family room was small but very clean. The room over-looked the bin area. There was a bright light outside, it remained on over-night. The room was initially cold as the radiator was switched off. As the room was small, one of the beds blocked the radiator. There was no fridge in the room (which might be an issue if travelling with small children). There was no water provided in the room -- the hotel charges 3‚Ç¨ for a large bottle of still / sparkling water (it's ‚Ç¨6 tray charge for room service). I travel a lot on business and many hotels provide water in the room so I thought this was really poor service. Check-in was busy but we didn't have to queue for too long. The pool was extremely busy. The changing rooms were tiny and chaotic. Showers were awful. We found that no robes were provided for hotels guests to walk from room to swimming area and back. Children can only use the pool between 0900 - 1800 (so if you are an adult guest hoping to actually swim avoid the pool during these hours at the weekend!).  On the plus side, the food was lovely and the waiting staff were excellent. The dinner menu was extensive and very good. The breakfast was excellent -- really wide choice of food and it was delicious. If the rest of the hotel matched the standard of the waiting, kitchen and house-keeping staff this would be a great hotel and worth the price it charges. ",3,2016,02,07
223,A real treat,We had an overnight bed breakfast and evening meal deal. Great value all the staff were friendly and helpful. Smiling happy staff created a very pleasant atmosphere. OMG the food is delicious with very clever presentation.  The hotel was spotless a very relaxed happy place to be. The only down side is the spa. The girls and the treatments were top class very enjoyable but the premises is a let down. The relaxing room is any thing but relaxing. The changing room is a toilet. It's busy dizzy. I hear they are going to build a purpose built spa which would  add hugely to the experience,5,2016,02,05
223,50th birthday Stay,"Stayed here as a party of 6 on 29th of january for one night! Treatment in the Tonic Spa was included in our deal as well as an amazing breakfast the following day! Hotel staff were great, polite and professional! Rooms were warm clean and modern! We ate at the bar that night which again was spot on! Good selection on the menu! Service was a tad slow but the place was packed so we didnt mind! Treatments in the spa were fab, the spa itself was nice and relaxing with robes and slippers provided! Pool area was clean and enjoyable!

Very enjoyable stay! Worth a second visit",4,2016,02,04
223,Great weekend stay,"We stayed here for a 2 night Irish break. It is a little difficult to locate, but once you have found the hotel you will see how close it is (by car) to amenities. I would advise to stay here if you have a car, by foot its a little out of the way. Staff are ok. Nothing to report there. But the hotel, the surroundings and the room was great, really had a fab time enjoying the luxury of the hotel. Breakfast is great also, lovely selection of food both hot and cold, and it is held in the bar which is cheerful first thing in the morning. Blach town center is close by, and city center is no length and easy to get too. Will stay here again for my next shopping trip.",5,2016,02,04
223,Exceptional Customer Service,"This was our 4th stay here and it just gets better each time!

Our friend is going through cancer treatment at the moment and when the Bar Manager Andrew Sherlock recognised her, it just made her day. He then brought her out a specially decorated dessert, which really speaks volumes about the excellent attitude and wonderful customer service we have repeatedly experienced at this hotel. 

I personally travel extensively throughout Europe and the US and to see such attention to details and personal touches at a local hotel is simply wonderful...

Thank you again to all of the exemplary staff at the Castleknock Hotel, especially Andrew! ",5,2016,02,03
223,AVOID for business.,"I had always thought my first review would be a positive one, though unfortunately after having desperately tried to reason with this hotel and been given no apology  or any indication of rectifying their mistakes, my first review is deeply negative. Let's start from the beginning...

The building has the wow factor from the outside, but don't be fooled- 50% of the rooms overlook a large generator and court yard. If the sound of staff throwing boxes around at all hours doesn't wake you up, the generator certainly will. My room with 3 beds (why 3 beds i thought? I would find out later...) was drab and in need of a serious lick of paint with odd stains up most walls... the stag room one would assume. Being so tired I could cry and knowing I had a morning of business meetings the next day I sent a desperate call to reception at 3am after having no sleep. The response was I would be moved in the morning- phew. 

I was indeed moved in the morning, and spent my last night in a sufficient room, that really I should have been put in in the first place? Why wasn't I?  I know for a fact this room was free the night before. 

However the biggest blow came on check out, and one that I am still disputing. I discovered I had been charged 201 euros for my first night... yes... the 3 bed stag room over looking a loud generator... and 191 euros for the second night. Standard rate for both rooms was 89 euros per night. I had paid double and triple what my colleagues who had stayed the same nights had! They had mistakenly charged me for 3 people staying in the room rather than 1. 

I am still disputing the amount... just under 400 euros for a 2 night mid week stay in January... with the hotel. I have had the travel agents from our company try to reason with the hotel 3 days in a row, I've made 4 phone calls personally. Each time I get a different manager, all looking to pass the blame sideways, all rude, all unapologetic. One reception lady admitted blame, I thought I was getting somewhere, but she said they were unable to do anything because it had been booked through an online travel tool. But castleknock, I paid YOU?  The contractual agreement of my stay was with you?

You too can get 2 horrific nights sleep for 400 euros a pop. If you like the idea of being robbed in broad daylight, and having to beg for your money back, stay here.

223,Insufficient,"Was at a Christmas party here and the food portion sizes were very small - mean I would say. Had to beg for a mini mince pie! Did email the hotel directly and their response was no one else complained. I know that this was the opinion of at least 10 of our party.
Didnt stay just attended the Christmas party.",2,2016,01,27
223,Unbeatable customer service!,"Booked the 'golden ticket afternoon tea' and wanted a private, secluded area so i can propose to my girlfriend. Nothing was too much trouble and the restaurant manager was only to happy to oblige and keep a secret. He organised for us to have the Park restaurant all to ourselves for the afternoon. Took the time out to bring us complimentary champagne and congratulate us in person.
Stayed in the bridal suite and it was fantastic, clean & comfortable. Excellent views of the golf course.
Breakfast the next morning was also very nice.
Nothing was too much trouble for the staff at this place, we were made to feel like we were the only guests in the hotel. A great experience, thank you.",5,2016,01,27
223,Mini weekend Break,This was a really lovely hotel. I had never been to Dublin before and it was not far in a taxi to everywhere we wanted to go. The bar/lounge area was pleasant and also it was nice sitting outside in the grounds. We also had the 'Charlie and the chocolate factory' lunch which was nice but far too much for 2 people so a lot was wasted.,5,2016,01,25
223,Fab-U-Lous,We had a family function in this hotel last Saturday night.  The whole experience was fantastic - the management were very caring & attentive and always to hand to assist anything we needed.  The food in the restaurant was so fabulous - the consensus of all our party of 35.  I can honestly say that this hotel is definitely worth a visit.  I will be back soon - I hope!,5,2016,01,25
223,Super stay ,We had an excellent stay here for a night away . Hotel is fab . We got married here 9 years ago but they have managed to keep the standards so high. A lot of areas have been revamped . The room was huge and we happened to get the same suite we got for our wedding ! The meal was so nice ... Restaurant was fab and food and service was 5 star . So relaxing . Breakfast to our room was also top notch . Highly recommend üëç,5,2016,01,24
223,40th Birthday Celebrations,"I celebrated my 40th birthday in this wonderful hotel last night with my family & friends. We were delighted to be dealing with Audrey who helped us with planning the party and I must say her attention to detail was amazing. From the moment we checked in the staff were so attentive and very warm to the moment we checked out there was nothing to fault. Our Executive room was beautiful overlooking the golf course, it was so peaceful. Elena was fantastic on the night, nothing was too big an ask and her warm, friendly personality would put anyone at ease. I would also like to mention that Grace & Caoimhe were so helpful putting out our last bits & pieces on the tables, it took away any worries we had. All my guests were all stunned at how wonderful my room was presented, it was stunning.  As a Coeliac I always worry about food but I had no worries here, the food for my guests was delicious and the gluten-free food was to die for, so a big thank you goes out to the chef.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to celebrate in style and comfort.  All the staff are so reliable, response time is extremely quick and the helpfulness was second to none.",5,2016,01,17
223,Surprisingly very good,I visited the Castleknock hotel this week for a three day business trip and was very pleasantly surprised as it was horrendous seven years ago. The meeting rooms were very good and their digital room was just brilliant and worth attending if you have a business meeting - really interactive and energising. The food was good and the staff were excellent - they did everything they could to accommodate and service was second to none. Bedrooms nice and temperature better than most five stars that I stay in for business. Very clean bathroom and breakfast in bed lovely. Shower could be better but other than that a very good stay.,4,2016,01,16
223,A fine hotel even if it's off the beaten track. ,Stayed one night on business. All very slick and smooth as far as checking in is concerned. Very clean modern hotel the bar and restaurant is staffed with friendly waiters and bar staff. Bedroom is very comfortable with a fine bed and good TV and the usual tea coffee facilities. Bathroom is clean and modern. It's a fairly difficult hotel to find and to get back to main routes a I doubt I would have succeeded in finding it had I not got sat nav. The grounds and wonderfully laid out and maintained. A few brave January golfers seemed to be having a good time. ,5,2016,01,14
223,Feedback given ,"My wife and sister stayed for an overnight treat in December. There were also other family member ms present. Had a great time and staff were friendly. Unfortunately they both had the soup for starters. They were both in their rooms at 10 pm sick as dogs. The other family members had other starters and had no issues. 
Unfortunately for my wife and sister in law there might was spent on the bathroom and I'll spare the details. 
This was mentioned to the receptionist the morning after and the response was that there was a wedding on for 200 and most had the same soup and they would find out if there were any more complaints and come back to them via phone call. The girls left their numbers and have yet to receive either an apology or explanation. 
This is a yearly family get together and have always been happy with the castle knock hotel. This will be the last time though. ",2,2016,01,13
223,Wonderful hotel,"Just a brief visit / overnight stay but an absolute pleasure from start to end. Beautiful decor throughout. Good quality food. Pleasant & clean spa facilities. The bedroom was very nice. Massive bed. Lovely decor. Clean modern large bathroom. And every single member of staff we met was polite, professional, helpful & attentive. Always a smile and ready to help. 

A very pleasant stay and a lovely experience. Thank you",5,2016,01,11
223,Average / Good Hotel,"Stay here for a recent wedding. The venue itself is a little off the beaten path. Nothing great to look at on drive in. Lobby and reception area are ok. Nothing fancy or eloquent. Bar area very open and not comfortable. Rooms are excellent, large and spacious. Separate shower. Really nice room overall. Bed was two single pushed together which was ok for us. Food was nice. Had a great day at the wedding. Bar service slow at times. Depended on the staff you got. Nice pool area. Overall a nice hotel and couldn't overtly fault anything. Don't think I'd go out of my way to go back but if I got an offer I'd have no hesitation. Reception staff were great!  ",4,2016,01,10
223,One night stay,"Have stayed at this property a few times now and as ever not much to find fault with.swift and friendly check in.lovely spacious rooms which was spotless with walk in shower and bath tea coffee etc.wonderful breakfast,and good bar.only slight is service in bar which again has not improved since last visit,it's like the bar staff are wearing blinkers.also could a senior barman show the younger lads how to pul a pint of guinness.only slight issues I know but easily rectified",4,2016,01,05
223,New Years Eve Stay,"Stayed here on New Years Eve.  
It was a very busy time of year, but reception could handle it.  Was in a deluxe room and it was a great size for a 4 star hotel, with a nice view of the golf course.  

Had both lunch and dinner in the bar and was very nice.  Fireworks display at midnight and drinks were served without much of a waiting time right to our table all night.  
Breakfast was very nice the next morning and went for a swim and used the steam room and Sauna before checkout.  

As I said it was a very busy time of year when we were there, but all staff were friendly and the hotel coped well with the numbers.   
Well worth a visit! ",5,2016,01,05
223,Terrible service,"Was at a wedding here recently and I must admit the service left a lot to be desired. Check in was extremely slow and despite arriving at 3.30pm our room was not ready for us. Service in the main bar was also very slow, while the staff were left without change and handed me the change of a ‚Ç¨50 note in 50 cent coins. 
During dinner at the wedding there was genuinely an hour between courses and desert was not served until 11pm. 
On the positive the room was lovely and very clean and the bed was very comfortable.",2,2016,01,05
223,A dining disaster,"Visited with my mom, sister and her friends on the 20th December. Everything was fine- a few early tweaks- given the wrong drink and no robes or slippers in the room - but nothing major. We went to the spa which was nice but the chlorine in the jacuzzi was far too strong and my eyes were actually blood shot afterwards from the water that got in my eyes. We were still having a great time and were really looking forward to dinner. 

Every single one of us had a complaint about our food. Our waiter went on his break and when our food was collected we told the waitress that it was a really poor meal. She was very nice and got the manager. The girl who came out could not have been ruder to us. She told us it was a bit of a 'coincidence' that we all disliked our food. I agreed that we too found this unusual- it was why we felt the need to tell them after all! She then said as far as she could see we hadn't complained and just ate our food and then when it was finished decided to complain. We could all read between the lines there!! We pointed out that our waiter told us he was going on his break and no one else approached us and that despite the fact that we were all hungry we each left about half of our meals. She was so rude it was a really unpleasant experience and something that was just feedback became a personal attack on us. We asked to speak to the chef so he could get the feedback as she refused to accept it. This too was refused. 

She then said she would get the manager. We had been told she was. His best line was to my mom. She complained her corn chowder had only 4 small pieces of fish and was just full of tinned sweetcorn and the top was congealed - he said - so you are annoyed your corn chowder had corn in it- so sarcastically it was actually like there was a hidden camera programme. There were a few more comments about how all weekend no one had made any complaints about the food and it was so unusual that we all SUDDENLY disliked our food. We actually went around the table one by one and discussed the difficulty with each meal so that there was no further doubt as to our sincerity. 

Not one apology was forthcoming. We paid our bills and he took the bottle of wine off but by this time he and the previous lady had totally ruined our evening and insinuated very clearly to us all that our motives were cynical. Whatever about the meals, (they were quickly becoming the best part of the evening) how the staff acted in response was a passive aggressive rudeness that none of us could get over. 

Most left early the next day and skipped breakfast. Given that it was self service I took my chances! The breakfast staff were lovely actually but there was no redeeming how we had been treated. It wasn't the experience we hoped for but at least it was so bad we will have an experience to laugh about for years to come!!!

223,Nice Mid Week Break,Stayed here for a  couple of days in October and found the hotel quite pleasant. It is a good drive out of the city center and would require the use of  a car. It has a nice setting and is located on a golf course. Staff are pleasant and helpful and the hotel has a large foyer which is a relaxing area. Breakfast was good with a great selection  which should suit all tastes.,4,2015,12,28
223,Excellent,"we came here for a break just before christmas and were very pleased with the time spent here. The hotel itself was very clean and the rooms were very comfortable. The staff were very helpful. We ate dessert in the bar every night and would highly recommend it! The breakfasts were also excellent, intact we looked forward to it every day. This was a fabulous hotel and is about a 10minute walk from the bus stop or 20 mins from the train, both of which take you to the centre of dublin",5,2015,12,28
223,Quite a night.,"The Castleknock hotel was the venue chosen for a very large party. It was my  work's party.
On arrival I checked in . The reception was a bit manic with a lot of people hanging around.
As my room was not yet ready I sat down in the very spacious reception . 
The room was of average size . Two comfortable beds , and all the usual other furniture. 
Having unpacked I headed for the leisure centre.The entrance of the centre is in the main reception area. At a desk outside you sign in and are given a towel. The greeting at the desk was very friendly.
The changing room was warm as was the pool area.
However I did not like the pool itself. A very odd shape with little room for swimming laps. The water was warm.
The pool was quite busy with a lot of children in it. The main pool was divided in two by one of those ropes used to create lanes. The outer one I thought was for those who wished to swim. Unfortunately there was one man in it with a child which he was tossing up and throwing into the water.I did not dare try to share that part of the pool as I did not fancy a child landing on my head. i was very surprised that the pool staff did not say something.
My party started with a drinks reception. Plenty of staff passing out drinks.
We were then called into the ballroom for dinner.
It was from here on that the hotel excelled .Orders were taken for the main meal and also for drinks.
There were around two hundred and fifty at this party. The service was as swift as if there were only ten to serve. There was no sign of hurry or pressure. Each course was served and cleared quietly and cleanly.
The starter was a smoked bacon salad . Not anything I would have chosen but was actually very nice.
I had the beef which was very good.Those who had the fish ware as happy. Plenty of veg and spuds.
Dessert was a plate of mixed bits and pieces. Ice cream , cheesecake , that sort of thing. desserts are not really my thing.
Coffee finished the meal.
The hotel has a lot of seating area near reception. All comfortable chairs and tables. Just the place to sit and chat if you don't want to dance. 
The price of the drinks was about average.
For the guests there are seat areas upstairs . When you come out of the lift there is a foyer with chairs , sofas and a television. To gain access to the bedrooms you have to have a key card , as you need to get into the rooms.
I had a very comfortable night's sleep. 
Half past eight in the morning found me back in the pool. There I came across a member of staff ( male ) who was downright surly. He did sort out the problem with the jacuzzi but with bad grace, He certainly left his smile behind him that morning.

223,Very disappointing ,"I recently visited the hotel for a Christmas dinner with myself and 2 friends. We ate near the bar area. In this area it says wait to be seated. We waiting but not one waiter offered to seat is, in the end we went and chose our own seat and asked for menus. The person (seemed like a manager) who gave us our menus was very friendly and told us he would send a waiter over to us to take our drink order. 10 minutes later not one person had come near us. When they did they'd look in our direction and walk away. Myself and my friends are all in the 23-25 year old age gap. We noticed a family who came in after us got served straight away yet we were still waiting to get any notice from staff members. We eventually managed to get the attention of one waiter and she took our order. The food came out promptly but I would definitely consider it over priced for the quality of food served. After we finished our dinner we didn't see another waiter. We wanted to order desserts,  tea and a coke but after 20-30 minutes of getting ignored by the waiters who were more interested in serving the families around us I had to walk up to the bar myself and ask for the extra drinks & dessert. The same happened again for the bill, by this stage the three of us just wanted to leave as we felt we were not wanted there. The waiters seemed very rude towards us and because of the attention families were getting we believed this to be due to our age. I wouldn't be in a rush to visit again as I was very disappointed with the visit overall. ",1,2015,12,25
223,Food is a disgrace,"Had my Christmas party in Castleknock hotel.  Although the staff were very friendly and provided an excellent service, the food was another story.  I have never been served up worse food.  It was extremely poor and barely edible.  Noone in our group eat it and found it hard to enjoy any course.  The money charged certainly did not reflect the quality or skill.  Extremely disappointing.",2,2015,12,19
223,Night away,"Stayed here last night 
Was lovely EXACTLY what I expected, rooms r perfect massive bed
Bath ,shower, water in room tea even hot chocolate....
We ate in the restaurant too which was lovely ...
Used gym and pool aswell 
Staff r really nice and helpful 
Definitely be back thanks guys!!‚ô°",5,2015,12,18
223,Expected more,"My husband and I stayed in this hotel in early October for his birthday. I had made them aware that it was his birthday and they had left two chocolate strawberries in the room but they left them on the table at the window and they were melted by the time we got to our room.The room was very nice but at ‚Ç¨220 for one night it should be nice. We only booked the day before hand so prices were expensive. We were really looking forward to using the hot tub but it was out of order  during our stay. The pool was ok. We had dinner in the restaurant that night and I really expected more, we both got the steak and chips and when they arrived we looked at each other and burst out laughing. This is no joke there was 4 chips sticking out of a little basket and they were horrible and under cooked. My husband was starving so he ordered some other side orders but it took so long for them to come out we were finished our meal. The only saving grace was the table behind us ordered the same and  when they got their chips we all had a good laugh. I was expecting a nice romantic meal with my husband as we were married 11 years the following week but it looked like the middle of the day with full lights on, it was anything but romantic. We had a few drinks and went up to bed. Breakfast was again ok. We left straight after breakfast but wouldn't be rushing back there.",3,2015,12,17
223,Wonderful stay,"We stayed here in early December and once again we weren't disappointed. Our room was beautiful, has practically everything you want (a mini fridge would be the only thing we miss as we like fresh milk with our tea/coffee) The rooms are large, the bed is so comfortable, heavy curtains to block out all light at night, quiet rooms away from the road, gorgeous bathrooms with separate shower/bathtub. The staff are exceptional so helpful and obliging. The breakfasts are gorgeous, fantastic selection & are replenished so quickly when the buffet begins to empty. The waiting staff are great & are so attentive. The Leisure Centre is brilliant & the locals are very friendly in there, so helpful for telling you about local attractions etc. We have stayed at numerous Dublin Hotels but this is the only one we have ever felt the personal touch in, we recommend here highly for a visit to Dublin.",5,2015,12,16
223,Very nice,I fully enjoyed 2 nights at this place. The pool and gym area works and my room perfect. Not impressed with the bar food nor the breakfast. Had 30 min to the office in Bluebell. I am sure a summer time break at this place would be absolutely great!,4,2015,12,16
223,Christmas Cheer,Just returned from a two night stay and must say it has a wonderful Christmas atmosphere.Not only is the enteranc decorated but the spread of Christmas trees around the ground floor makes for that special Christmas feeling .  Had the Christmas early bird menu and I have to say it was the best in fine dining I have experienced .Its presentation was superb and taste exquisite. Also great breakfast selection and plenty of variety.,5,2015,12,08
223,Afternoon tea was a winner ...,"Stayed for one night on a package ; I sampled a bit of everything - spa, afternoon tea, the pool, and dinner at the restaurant ! 

1. The spa is v v average. Relaxation room is certainly not relaxing ! Not enough chairs , people waking in and out , no music , no robes for us, no fruit or juices ,I could go on ! 
2. Afternoon tea was AMAZING ! Def the highlight. Delicious food - loads left over , constant refills of tea and coffee ! Our waiter marco was fab!
3. Dinner was quite nice. Beef fillet was cut in half - didn't like that! Tasted the prawns - not v tasty atal! A lot of our party v disappointed with d sticky toffee pudding ( avoid!) , I had apple strudel and it was delicious ! 
4. I enjoyed the pool area , clean , very modern etc ! 

Our room was a suite, it's step above the basic rooms and I think d only diff is we got a large flat screen tv, a nespresso machine nd bath and shower in bathroom ! 
We got a taxi into dublin centre that night - approx 25-‚Ç¨30 !
The following day we wer going to get lynch at the hotel but the menu was rubbish, not enough options nothing nice on it really so we went somewhere else ! 
Staff here were v good , except maybe the bar staff, appeared disinterested like they did not want to be ther ! ",3,2015,12,06
223,Lovely weekend stay,"We travelled as a couple for a weekend getaway. The hotel is in a great location if you love golf and do not want to stay in the city. 
Nearest train station to the city is about a 10-15minute walk with regular services.
Unfortunately my boyfriend was ill during our stay from the flu, the hotel staff were very helpful giving us hot water and lemon and making sure he was okay!
Would recommend for a quiet getaway, good facilities in the hotel and friendly staff. ",4,2015,12,04
223,Nice location and decor but,"Visited this on a family celebration. Location and facilities look very nice and modern, but I would rate the experience disappointing. Food was only average at best, children menu very limited. Definitely disappointed, also considering the expectations set by the ""ambience"" and facilities. ",3,2015,12,04
223,Fine but won't be rushing back ,"The hotel was very nice. Modern inside, outside doesn't reflect the interior. The food was nice. Lots of kids running and playing football on the corridors. Signs around the hotel up asking kids to be accompanied by adult but this was ignore and not implemented by staff. Quite annoying. Staff were pleasant but quite slow... ",4,2015,11,30
223,Midweek business,"Stayed one night mid-week really liked my executive room & found the staff very helpful, kind,accommodating  and professional. Lunch was great also! Very nice pool and gym. Traffic busy in area in early morning and from 5-7 in the evening.",5,2015,11,26
223,Wonderful!,"Clean & luxurious. Breakfast was great!  Very nice golf course.  We can't wait to go back.  Hot tub wasn't working though.  You need transportation to see the area.  This is one of the nicest hotels we have ever stayed in, & we travel a lot.",5,2015,11,25
223,Relaxing Break,"We stayed for a weekend the end of September for my hubbies birthday and have to say most relaxing weekend ever. Had lunch when we arrived and staff so nice lunch fab then spa treatment which was a back massage so relaxing, staff superb in hotel and bar and wud Deffo go back ",5,2015,11,23
223,St Francis Hospice Fundraiser.,"A group of well meaning do gooders held a fundraising event in Castleknock Hotel and Country Club yesterday 22nd of November in aid of St Francis Hospice. It was an afternoon tea dance held in their large banquet room. Our liason person in the hotel was Gael Cook Allen. This event posed many challenges, from coping with crowd numbers,excessive demands on the hotel, striking a rate,advertising and general concerns. Gael on behalf of the hotel worked with us tirelessly,patiently and professionally. On the day of the event the hotel staff were amazing...nothing was too much trouble. We had ordered 240 afternoon teas but on the day 322 people turned up.The hotel staff in support of Hospice allowed us to accommodate as many as they possibly could.They served mouth watering afternoon tea and despite many many demands kept smiling and kept delivering.The staff were exceptional really they were. I couldn't say enough good things about them. If your ever thinking of holding an event don't hesitate to check in with Castleknock Hotel and Country Club. Their manager Guy....Gael Cooke Allen and other staff are exceptionally good people who always try to please and help. Thank you all very much for hosting what could only be described as a hugely successful event.",5,2015,11,23
223,Romantic Post-Wedding Stay!,"We stayed in the Castleknock for two days following our wedding which was held elsewhere locally. The standard of the hotel was excellent. The room was spacious and absolutely spotless. The bathroom was modern and clean with a separate bath and shower. The little perks like the espresso machine and hot chocolate were also quirky and nice! 

We use the spa facilities on the Saturday for a couples massage. We both really enjoyed the opportunity to unwind in such a nice atmosphere. The staff were all extremely helpful and friendly.  The sauna/steamroom and jacuzzi facilities were also lovely.

We dinned in The Park restaurant that evening. We personally found the menu a little limited however the food was delicious and the staff were extremely friendly and attentive. I would recommend checking out the menu before booking a table as It may not be to everyone's taste! We both had the 'Corn Chicken Fillet Stuffed with Herb Chorizo' which was thoroughly enjoyable! We also celebrated with a few drinks in the Avenue bar afterwards, the atmosphere in the bar was relaxed and friendly.

Our only small gripe with our stay was that on the Sunday before check out we decided to use the spa facilities once more only to be told that the would be closed for a private booking from 11-12. I have to say I was astonished that the pool would be allowed to be booked in such a way before the Sunday guests would be checking out. We were not the only guests turned away. I found the attitude of the lady looking after the spa counter quite surprising, her 'it should be on the webpage' response was  rather disappointing and not in line with our experience with all other staff to that point. It wasn't on the webpage but that is beside the point. My partner and all other guests for the Sat night stay had all paid (alot!) to stay in the hotel and it is unfair to not allow people use the facilities which are part of why most people book in the first place! 

We decided to check out then. We did raise our disappointment with the reception manager who was extremely understanding and surprised that this had happened also. I found it quite surprising that she also was not aware that this 'private booking' had been arranged. 

Overall however we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would recommend the Castleknock Hotel.",4,2015,11,19
223,Lovely hotel-just need to tighten up on processes...,"Lovely, modern hotel with good sized rooms and extra big beds.  Staff are attentive however the hotel is let down by some simple basic issues.

Restaurant/Room Service: I stayed for two nights on business and got in at just before 10pm.  Was disappointed to find out that the restaurant closed for orders at 9pm and that from 10pm their (already limited) room service menu options moved to the overnight menu.  Even worse, the overnight menu was only sandwiches and toasties - not even a simple soup, salad, burger or pasta option.  Thankfully they took pity on me and arranged to make some chips to go with the sandwich.

For a hotel of this calibre, I expected the restaurant to be open for new orders until at least 10pm, full room service menu until 11pm and have some additional dishes on the overnight menu.

In room cleaning:  Both mornings I was disturbed at 8am by someone trying to come into the room to clean.  I know I could have put a ""Do not disturb"" sign on the door but I dont expect to do this when I am going to be out before 9 or 10am.  Most hotels have a process to let their housekeeping staff know when a guest has checked out - not sure why the Castleknock team dont have this process in place.

So why didnt I raised these issues?  I was ready to do this at checkout but the standard question ""Was everything OK with your stay"" wasnt asked so I figured they if they couldnt be bothered to enquire why should I?

Would I stay there again?  If I wanted to avail myself of the leisure facilities and have plenty of time to relax in the hotel - yes.  If it was for business or as a base of sightseeing - nope.",4,2015,11,15
223,Terrible bar food but lovely hotel room,"Stay here as we were shopping near by,the room was lovely although the window was not fixed in place correctly.  We decided to have a look at the menu for the bar food in our room,it looked good so we said we would try it but to our amazement when we went to the bar for some food we were told the menu had changed???why have a menu in the room that is not actually available in the bar. We still ate at the bar but the food was just ok and would be lucky to leave with a full stomach as the choice was very poor......wouldnt stay here again as food not good...",3,2015,11,14
223,Visited spa today,"Had double massage with my wife. Absolute superb. Very comfortable, tranquil and professional. In lovely relaxing rooms and use of swimming pool, steam room etc. Afterwards had light refreshments in hotel itself",4,2015,11,10
223,Great Hotel.,"Stayed to this hotel on our first stay in Dublin, the hotel was great, room was lovely and they left chocolates in the room for our anniversary.  The restaurant was amazing ate there 2 out of 3 night as Dublin was actually too far away to go out at night which was the only downside but we just stayed in the hotel and enjoyed the posh surroundings. Last day we had a long wait till our flight so we just sat in the lobby eating and drinking and that food was delicious too!",5,2015,11,08
223,Excellent in all respects!,"Stayed here overnight for a conference meeting and can confirm that the hotel , it's rooms and staff are great. The location is about 25 minutes from the airport by road and is set in a beautiful setting.
Breakfast is one of the best I've had too!
Will definitely be back here for a leisure break.
",5,2015,11,06
223,Very enjoyable stay,"I've stayed twice in the Castleknock Hotel, once while I was pregnant for a bit of a babymoon with my husband before our little boy came along. I indulged in one of their prenatal spa treatments for my poor swollen feet and it was absolutely divine! The relaxation room after the treatment was so relaxing and I loved every minute and the girls in the spa were so lovely. The second time we stayed was only a month or so ago and we brought our little boy along, the staff had a travel cot with lovely clean sheets and some extra towels all set up in the room for us. We ended up arriving quite late to the hotel that night on check in but had rang ahead to see what time the bar food finished to see if we could get anything to eat and the lady we dealt with was so helpful that she arranged for us to have some sandwiches left in our room for when we arrived. That attention to detail went down a treat! The room we were in had a gorgeous view of the golf course and we were blessed with a lovely day the following day. Although our little boy was too young to enjoy the playground area it's definitely an added bonus that will be a hit when he's older!",5,2015,11,04
223,Lovely Weekend Getaway,"Greeted by a lovely receptionist on the desk who checked us very tired travelers into our room quiet promptly.  Great selection of breakfast items, suiting my dietary requirements. We also booked dinner for that night and it lovely, the waiters paid great attention to detail. The room was lovely and warm and very up to date. Oh we also treated ourselves to a massage.  Loved how the surround area was nice and quiet . High recommend it !",4,2015,11,02
223,Lovely hotel on the outskirts of Dublin,"We stayed 2 nights here as we were attending a wedding.  The staff was friendly at check-in and very efficient and helpful at the wedding reception which was held in the hotel.  There is a restaurant which has a very limited choice of food in the evening (although there is a more expensive restaurant on site which offers a Eur 40 - 3 course set meal).  Leisure centre next door which has gym and indoor pool.  The hotel has a spa.  It also offers afternoon tea - but upon arrival when we asked about it, we were told that you need to book 24 hours in advance!!  Breakfast was plentiful - served buffet style.
It was quite a long way outside of Dublin and seemed it was mainly used for events - conferences, weddings, etc.  
",4,2015,11,02
223,Credit to the staff.  ,"Stayed here a few times now with and without my children.   Rooms are spotless....the adjoining family room was an added bonus being able to leave the door between the rooms open and not having to go back and forth in the corridor.  Rooms are a good size too and decorated very tastefully. 
Have eaten in both the Park and Avenue restaurant.  The food is simply delicious. 
Spa facilities are great and the girls in Tonic are lovely. 
Overall a great experience and a great atmosphere. Staff are obviously busy but take time to make sure your ok.  
The hotel as a whole is a pleasure to visit. Well done to all the staff ",5,2015,11,02
223,Family Break,"Stayed here with the family for the oct mid term break. We got a good deal through the website. 

Hotel is a bit out of the way on a country road but not a problem if you have transport. Dublin zoo only 5 minutes drive which was great for the kids. There's a big shopping centre 10 minutes from the hotel.  

Property is located on beautiful grounds, countryside setting. Top notch facilities. Gym, pool and spa all under one roof although we didn't get to use the spa, it was fully booked on both days we were there. Staff were very helpful and friendly, nothing was too much trouble. The place was very clean and comfortable. 

They had some fun activities on for the little ones on Halloween which was an added bonus. 

Breakfast had a great selection of good quality food and service was prompt. We ate in the bar on one evening, it was really good too. Cannot comment on their other restaurant, we didn't eat there 

Would highly recommend ",5,2015,11,01
223,Beautiful Food!,"My husband and I recently stayed for a mid week break as he had a few days free and I had to be in Dublin for a few days for business.  So he got to enjoy the hotel facilities, including the gym and spa, and then we met for dinner in the Park Restaurant.  
He was delighted that the gym had so much to offer in comparison to most hotels, and also enjoyed the pool, hot tub and steam room.  He also enjoyed a massage, and said the ladies in the spa were all lovely.  
The highlight of my stay was the food! The steaks melted in your mouth! The waiter was attentive and prompt, and I'm rather particular about what spices I can have so even double checked with the chef for me to ensure I could enjoy what I'd ordered.  I realise that should be standard, but isn't always, so I was relieved to see that the staff here were delighted to help. 
A few things to note: Be sure to bring your swim cap as it's required in the pool.  (I think it is in most Irish hotel pools these days.) And if you're traveling on business, be sure to take time to book yourself in to the spa as well, so you don't have to hear how wonderful it is from your partner and miss out!",5,2015,11,01
223,Fantastic Hotel,"Stayed here for one night over the bank holiday and loved the place! 

Had dinner in the Avenue bar this was great I was just expecting basic bar food but received  much more, we had duck and chicken it was to die for!! The service was also great I think our waiters name was Laura she was so attentive and looked after us the whole night. 

They also have park restaurant but we didn't get to try as we were just staying for the one night : (

We had cocktails in the lime tree after dinner which was great and took them to the lobby as there was a one man bad on who was pretty good. We slept in the next morning so can't comment on breakfast but when we went for a coffee before we left the waiter was kind enough to give us some fruit and bottles of water for our journey home! 

This hotel deserves 5stars because the staff are great from the moment we arrived! ",5,2015,10,31
223,"Expensive, Expensive and VERY Poor Service","My Wife and i were invited to a wedding at this location recently. Firstly,  The price of drinks at the bar and at the other bars through out the Hotel was very expensive.
Secondly, there were 10 couples at the table and when the food was FINALLY served the main course was cold. Two small trays of potatoes and a few Vegetables to few ten people it  was a disgrace. The service was very poor with no Coordination or management plan. It was like nobody cared. When a complaint was made it took ages for any one to come back and then it was not my problem attitude. I was glad i was not staying as i am sure the service at breakfast would be a joke. I will in future  not accept a wedding invitation there ever.....how this can be call a hotel....",1,2015,10,31
223,What a great weekend!,"My husband and I spent the bank holiday weekend at Castleknock Hotel, and I can't say enough about the great service and staff.

From the moment we arrived we were welcomed with the Irish hospitality we've come to expect from all the best hotels. Reception reminded us to make our dinner booking and also suggested some great treatments at the in-house spa, Tonic.

The room was immaculate and well equipped...we even had Netflix on the TV!

Dinner was sublime. Even with the restaurant and bar being extremely busy, the staff found time to check on us and ensure we were really enjoying ourselves. We were! The bar staff do some great cocktails and my husband could choose from a pretty well stocked craft beer fridge!

Breakfast was busy with the bank holiday families but amazingly we only had to wait a few minutes to be seated on Sunday. Plenty of choice. Our room service on Monday was hot and quick although juices could have been in slightly larger glasses. I did see some previous comments about room service trays but the card on the tray did say to call for collection so not sure why people put the trays in the corridor. 

I didn't try the spa in the end because the pool was so inviting so can't comment on their treatments. I'll definitely try some next time!

All in all, a great weekend out of the house!",5,2015,10,31
223,Nowhere near 4 stars,"Very poor experience from start to finish - how this place earned 4 stars is beyond me and supposedly AA Hotel of the Year 2013?? Baffling beyond  belief.

Arrived at 3.15 to be told room not ready - had to wait 20 mins while other families came and went with no problem. Up to our room to be greeted by tray after tray of smelly food and rubbish just sitting around all over every hallway and right outside our door. Door very very hard to open, new carpet had been laid and was far too high and door very tight to it. Room ok, clean enough although there was a large hole near the 1st bed between it and the radiator. No air con, very warm and stuffy. Bed not comfortable but bearable.

Fire alarm kept going off, woke our little girl and she wet the bed. My wife phoned reception and asked for the sheets to be changed the next day  - she marked them and they werent. Alarm went on and off for 2 days.

Into restaurant 1st night for dinner, i had the burger which came out just a burger with cheese in a bun, no relish, sauce,salad or anything. And the chips were poorly cooked. My wife's chicken dish was just ok she said.

Back to room, we were at side room and there is a very bright light shining up and in all night, thru the curtains making the room very bright all night, plus the alram wasnt good.

Breakfast was ok though lack of soda and potato bread noticable. Were down early so not too busy thankfully.

Pool was ok but dont think their policy of no children after 6 is very fair - after being out all day and your wee one wants to swim but cant isnt very good. After all, they accept money for the children to stay and would not tell people the couldn't use the pool on grounds of colour, race or religion!

Very poor effort made for Halloween, no decorations of any kind put up anywhere in the hotel - we were in garages and pubs that had made more of an effort.

So overall, would i recommend? No. Will i be back? No. Never.",2,2015,10,30
223,Return visit for a wedding,"I stayed at the hotel for a wedding, the food and service were excellent. It's been a few years since my previous stay but the hotel has been well maintained. Great wedding venue or getaway destination but a little isolated for accessing the city.",4,2015,10,29
223,Disappointed,"We attended a family wedding there and were very disappointed with the reception. The meal took over four hours to serve! Some people were finished a course before other people at the table were served. Three of us at our table were told they ran out of roast beef and offered fish instead. We declined and they eventually served us grilled steak after about 30 minutes, no fresh vegetables were served so we had to make do with the cold leftovers. The others at the table who got the original roast beef described it as burnt and tough. Having eaten and stayed there before, could not believe it was the same hotel. The staff tried their best despite being understaffed for such a large group.  The kitchen obviously had insufficient food to feed the group which is crazy considering how much they charge for weddings. Would not recommend this hotel for a wedding.",2,2015,10,29
223,Not Good Enough. Returned to lipstick sheets,"'Not Good Enough' just about sums up so many aspects of our half term trip to this hotel. We have been to the Roe Park Hotel on the North Coast for the past three years at half term. We should have made it four as that is a proper 4*hotel. We arrived after 3pm and still had to wait over twenty minutes as the room wasn't ready! No offer of tea, coffee as a means of sorry to keep you waiting. When we eventually got to the room-after walking along halls of patch work paint(a very bad look) we noticed trays of stale food from the previous night had been left everywhere, along with an overflowing bin outside our room door! Then inside the room we find a leaflet detailing a 2 night 1 meal deal. When we booked direct with hotel and asked they said there were no deals available! After contacting reception we were able to avail of deal for the 2 of our 4 night stay. We ate one evening meal in the bistro. It was terrible! A burger arrived at the table without any salad and undercooked chips! McDonalds make a better effort! On returning to put our child to bed the fire alarm went for the 5th time that day! At this stage I had enough and complained to reception. I was told the meal was so terrible because they were busy- hardly an excuse! Anyway, they did cancel the charge for the room that night. At reception the next morning I explained TWICE that my child had wet the bed as the alarm had woken her out of her sleep and frightened her. We were assured the bed would be changed. To ensure that it was changed I marked the sheet with lipstick before we left for the day and when we returned sure enough the lipstick sheets were still on the bed! Breakfast is also not up to standard. No Irish bread in Dublin? Lack of waiting staff meant that cereal bowls were left on the table when people had moved on to their cooked breakfast! NEVER AGAIN",1,2015,10,28
223,Other guest given a keys to our room!!!!,"stayed in your hotel on Sunday 25/10/15. We paid ‚Ç¨174 (which i taught was a bit pricey) 1 night B&B. We went up to the room & settled in, we were just about to go to the swimming pool. We were in our room 40 minutes an door opened a English lady (very nice)  that was just after checking in at reception was given our room number & a key to get into our room, she showed us her room card details to our surprise she was given also room. Needless to say i was highly annoyed & upset to think some else was given our room & if we were not in the room could have took our beg-longings or anything may have happened. I rang down immediately to reception to report this & ask why this had happened, they said they were sorry & that they would eventually coped it!!! But yet the lady had walked into our room 40mins after we checked in with a key so how would that have coped it! I really was disguised that this happen & i was even nervous leaving the room to go for dinner. 
When i was checking out on Monday i spoke to a dark haired girl who had very broken English i don't think she understood what i was saying regarding what had happened after we checked in. I didn't ask for a manger when leaving as the front desk staff were so relaxed about what happened, that i just wanted to get out of the hotel. Needless to say my stay at your hotel wasn't a happy one! 
The hotel restaurant/bar itself was very busy to be honest the staff were run off there feet we were sitting for 25mins before our food order was taken. They hadn't got enough staff to deal with customers you could see the chaos among-st the staff on the floor.",1,2015,10,28
223,Never again,Stayed here for 1 night  24th oct 15 where do i start only tea can be served in the lobby no food allowed so you must leave where your sitting  move to eating area such a waste ordered 5 toasted sandwich  all to be toasted no staff didnt manage that all 5 were not so they had 2 be returned  then came some tea  cup filthy inside that went back ordered drinks 20 min wait so next time went ourselves  7 staff members behind the bar  but i had to walk around the  bar to get someone  attention my room had a inter connecting  door family were really loud guess the door doesnt do much 2 keep noise out asked  2 be moved  first receptionist  told  me she would check if i could be moved no sign of  her phoning  back so when i phoned again she told me she was looking thank you and goodbye she said while i was trying to explain my meal was booked for  8  eventually  a manager  phoned but  only smoking  room avaliable  no thanks i will put up with the  noise had a facial  done sat afternoon  it was lovely Suzanne  was very polite and excellent  at her job the rest of the staff need manners ita a 4 star hotel but you wont get 4 star service  cant bkame tge young staff they just have not being trained to  a high standard,2,2015,10,26
223,Evening Dining,"I am a local resident and would sometimes go to the hotel with family and friends for some food and drinks as it is within walking distance..
I was there recently and  found that you are no longer able to sit in the large reception area and had to go into the bar area, I was very disappointed as the reception area is much more relaxed and the children preferred this area. When the children say they don't want to go back as they don't like sitting in bar area something is wrong .
The food quality has also dropped and when paying ‚Ç¨15.50 for a burger and chips I was expecting something better. If thing remain this way I wont be going back which 
I find unfortunate as I always liked going here and supporting  local business.",2,2015,10,25
223,Fab stay!,"Very little wrong with this hotel if this is where you need to be. We had a family room which had two big beds and plenty of space - bath and freestanding shower, and heated bathroom floor. We ate out, although breakfast the next day was good. A very large hotel so felt maybe a little impersonal, but yet everyone we met was friendly and helpful. A touch of luxury too in the public areas. Plenty of parking and close to shops (we enjoyed the Liffey Valley shopping centre). Gets the full five stars, however, for the swimming pool and spa facilities. I like a warm pool and this was - making our morning swim very pleasant indeed. We feel that we got great value for our stay - thank you very much!",5,2015,10,25
223,Best place to stay in dublin,I just love this hotel. I've been twice now and both times have been perfect. The rooms and beds are so comfortable. The beds are huge!! Staff friendly and helpful. Breakfast and food are so good. Swimming pool is great too. I took my baby in for her first swim and she loved it. A fantastic hotel for location to Dublin zoo. 5 minutes by car. A lovely village for a walk around with a few good restaurants. Can't wait to go back and I've recommended it to family and friends who have stayed too. ,5,2015,10,23
223,Good 1 night stay,"I stayed at this hotel recently, in a Superior room. This was a one night business stay. If you are planning on using this hotel as a base to explore Dublin you would need a car or expect to use taxis as this is some way outside the city centre. Plenty of parking available at the hotel. Spa facilities were nice for relaxation at the end of the day, but I only used the pool/ sauna/ steam-room so not sure how expansive the 'spa' aspects are. The rooms are relatively modern, but as one would expect from a large hotel, they lack some character and charm. The bed was huge and comfortable however it was two singles pushed together rather than one large mattress. Shower was OK, but not the most powerful I've ever experienced. The main bar was stocked with a good range of spirits and beers. I did not eat at the hotel so cannot comment on the food. I found service to be very good, with staff attentive to any requests.",4,2015,10,22
223,"Beautiful, modern hotel","We stayed here to enjoy Dublin without being right in the city.  The room was beautiful and very clean.  They upgraded us to a suite on arrival, though I'm not sure why, but we didn't complain.  My wife said this was the nicest hotel she has ever stayed at.  The room was spacious, had robes, slippers, fridge, large seating area, and looked out over the golf course.  The included breakfast was very nice with a wide selection of pastries, meats, fruit, eggs, pancakes and a variety of other choices.  We would recommend this place, you won't be disappointed!",5,2015,10,21
223,Wedding trip! ,"This is the nicest place I've ever stayed away from home (who am I kidding way better than my home) I could live here! 
All staff were great, rooms were fantastic and clean most importantly! Love live loved it! ",5,2015,10,20
223,Disappointing spa facilities,"The staff here are lovely and very helpful, the therapists were amazing and I felt fantastic for days after but if you are looking for a full spa experience I would not recommend it. The relaxation room is a converted hotel room. There is one changing room which is the hotel room toilet. This is where the lockers are also kept. On my arrival I needed to use the bathroom but there were two ladies changing in the toilet so I had to wait. My friend was late for her treatment as she was waiting for me to use the toilet and change. When we went to use the pool afterwards we were told we would have to buy swimming hats at reception at ‚Ç¨3 each. When I called the day spa I mentioned that we would like to use the pool and bringing swimming hats was never mentioned. ",2,2015,10,19
223,Wedding Bar B Que,"We had our Daughters and new son in laws wedding bar b que the day after the wedding in the Castleknock hotel. The food was both excelent and plentiful. The service was friendly, attentive and quick. A number of our party stayed at the hotel and were extremely complimetry about the rooms and breakfast. We would have no hessitation in recomending the Castleknock hotel.",5,2015,10,13
223,weekend away,"i found this hotel to be over priced for what it had to offer. it was not well serviced by bus or train so one needed a car. The service was poor from start to finish , dinner reservation was incorrect. service in dining room was poor and finally when I was checking out I was been overcharged. all in all i did not enjoy my visit",1,2015,10,12
223,Birthday Celebration,"We can't thank the Hotel enough for the way it planned the event, set up the room, did a fantastic job on decorating the room and made it extra special by setting up a special entrance which included a red carpet. Everyone had a fantastic time . 
If your looking for excellent food an excellent venue and superb staff, then look no further than The Castleknock Hotel. ***** Five Stars A Round*****",5,2015,10,10
223,Very comfortable and reasonable priced,"A group of 4 of us went for a spa treatment, dinner and B&B. thoroughly enjoyed by all! The spa was reasonably priced and very relaxing- dinner was delicious too. We had lunch in the golf club bar which was an unexpected bonus! I would recommend this experience.",4,2015,10,07
223,Lovely hotel,"Rooms were to a high standard, staff were helpful and friendly. Food was great.
Travelled with two children who have simple tastes so when I asked for sandwiches which weren't on the menu the staff were more than happy to accommodate.

223,School Re-Union,"Just home after a wonderful week-end at this hotel.  12 of us met for a School Re-Union after 45 years and we had a ball!!  Staff were really wonderful especially the waiter we had at our meal on Sat. Night.  Everyone pleased with their rooms and food was excellent, we really had a wonderful time and many thanks are due to this hotel.",5,2015,09,28
223,Luxurious stay. ,"On arrival my first impressions were WOW. I have worked in the hospitality industry so I understand all the in's and outs of how it all goes. On arrival we were early so left our bags at reception. We had booked the spa of which I would highly recommend. We ate lunch in the restaurant which was delicious and we were served by a very friendly English girl (don't know her name). Room was very spacious. The hotel ground surroundings are amazing. 
A little far from the city but I would definitely stay again. 
",5,2015,09,28
223,Dissapointing ,"I booked the castleknock hotel as a birthday treat for my husband.I paid 265 euro for one night in a deluxe room with a four course meal.
On arriving at check in I tried to book in for dinner only to be told they were fully booked.I explained to the girl that I'd booked in for a dinner package (she was in the middle of charging my card for it!).She said it was ""the night that was in it"" and they might be able to fit me in at 6!She then gave me the number for the restaurant and told me to try them myself
I was pretty annoyed at this stage...I've stayed in numerous hotels with a dinner included and this has never been an issue.when I asked what happened if I couldn't get a reservation and was told..they'd sort out something.wow..Thanks
After getting to the room and unsuccessfully trying to get the restaurant my husband went back down and spoke to a different receptionist who managed to get us a reservation at 9.
So back to the room.It was nice..but I fail to see what the extra 35 euro paid for.Ive stayed in other 4 stars where this would be a standard room.The reception on the TV was abysmal.lucky they had netflix...not so lucky the Internet stopped working in the hotel that evening.
We decided to go down to the pool..and I was looking forward to chilling out in the jacuzzi.no such luck.jaquzzi out of order.

We decided to go down for a drink before dinner.At 8.30 the ""fully booked"" restaurant was half empty.
After a drink it took quite a while to find someone to show us to our table.
When we were seated a waitress came over...to take our dessert order!explained we had just sat down!
The meal itself was nothing to write home about to be honest.and you had to pay 3.50 extra for potato!I thought this was disgraceful given the amount of money I'd already handed over.Also coffee is apparently a ""course"".so the meal is 3 course and coffee.not 4 courses as advertised
Breakfast was fine.
The receptionist was very apologetic on check out and gave us 10% off future stays.but regretfully I won't ever be using it
I would have given this hotel 2 out of 5...but the staff were a credit to the place so that wouldn't have been fair.However lots of the issues I experienced were noted in earlier reviews and still have not been dealt with.very disappointing and not worth the money

",3,2015,09,27
223,Wonderful stay,"My family and their spouses together with my husband and I, stayed last weekend in five deluxe rooms which were excellent and all with great views of the golf course or garden. It was a special birthday surprise for my husband and we were delighted to find chocolates, birthday card and large balloon in our room on arrival. Breakfast was excellent. Reception staff were very attentive and efficient. We did not have an evening meal as we had made other arrangements.  Will return! Many thanks.",5,2015,09,24
223,Radical overhaul needed,"First impressions of this hotel are very good; the lobby is spacious and well furnished and the Reception staff are friendly, helpful and welcoming. Our family group had booked three rooms for the night before a wedding at a nearby Church. Due to a strong smell of cigarette smoke one room had to be changed, but the replacement room was above a noisy air-conditioning unit. Another couple arrived later and the allocated room was above the same air-conditioning unit. My husband and I were allocated a room overlooking outhouses which were visited before dawn by a truck with a very noisy reversing alarm. The rooms were well-furnished with comfortable beds and good showers, but none of us slept well.

We had previously booked a table for ten people in the formal dining room as other wedding guests were joining us for dinner. Our first courses were served one hour after we ordered, and some of the group had finished main courses as the others were being served. The waiters were not to blame, but there was obviously a serious problem in the kitchen. The food was disappointing; my main course consisted of overcooked fish in a sauce which was too strongly flavoured. 

The breakfast buffet offered a good selection of hot and cold dishes. However, the overall impression was of a hotel with staffing and management problems. I could not recommend this hotel.",2,2015,09,22
223,Short Break,"This is a very good hotel, rooms are excellent, very clean and nicely decorated.  The bar and restaurant are very good and most of the staff are very pleasant.  Good choice of food at breakfast including full Irish breakfast or continental, including fruit and yoghurt.  The meal is the Park Restaurant was delicious couldn't fault this at all.  The spa was also very good and you can use all the facilities at no extra cost.  All in all a very pleasant stay, even though our sat nav didn't get us to the hotel",4,2015,09,21
223,Lovely meal in The Avenue restaurant - pity about the noise from the bar !!,We hadnt been in this hotel for food for quite a while as we werent totally happy with the food or service - however we were pleasently surprised at the improvement in the restaurant The Avenue - the food we ordered was really lovely and well presented - I had the chicken supreme and my husband had the fish curry (he said it was the best meal he had in a long time and he is usually very hard to please !! ) .The waitress was lovely and very efficient.Our only gripe was that there was a wedding afters party in the bar beside the restaurant - there was a band playing in the bar and although they were very good - the noise was just deafening - we struggled to have a conversation across the table when having our meal - every time someone closed the door between the bar and the restaurant someone in the bar opened it again as the noise in the bar must have really been deafening !! I think that the Hotel will really have to take their other customers into consideration when holding weddings or other functions in public areas - just getting bands or singers to turn down the amplifiers would certainly help.,4,2015,09,21
223,Business course,The hotel looks impressive from the road and it has lovely well kept grounds. As you enter the hotel you see the open plan lobby cum bar cum restaurant with an abundance of marble and glass. The hotel was very busy yesterday. They have plenty of staff and the service appeared to be courteous and timely. We had lunch there and again excellent service and a choice of hot food or a salad at a self service. Tea and coffee was table service.,4,2015,09,18
223,Beautiful hotel,"Booked twin room for a weekend with my daughter for her 18th.  Gorgeous hotel, slightly tricky to find but satnav just about got us there. Really need to hire a car as its a way out of Dublin, but in a lovely area.  We spent the day in Dublin, back to hotel then got a taxi back into the city, cost for a taxi ...expect to pay 25 euros each way. not cheap!  
Hotel room was beautiful, really well furnished and very clean. Lovely bathroom and comfy beds. 
The pool was empty when we were there, it got busier on the sunday but it was lovely. 1 euro for the locker but hotel provides towels. You need a swimming hat so bring you own or hotel sells them for 3 euro.
Breakfast buffet was really good, loads of food and a mix of hot and continental food.  All in all, a lovely place which I would highly recommend.",5,2015,09,16
223,"""Fantastic Stay"" ","Wow....This has to be our favourite hotel in  Dublin. The staff in all areas never disappoint and look after us so well. We stayed here for our twin girls 1st Birthday & my husbands birthday. The hotel staff left a lovely birthday card in the room for our arrival which we thought was so nice...its the little things that make the biggest impact. Great place to relax!! The hotel arranged a babysitter (lovely lady)for us for a couple of hrs so we had a Fab meal at The Park Restaurant...food was fantastic,great choice and lovely relaxed atmosphere. Cant fault this hotel for a couples night away or family....worth a trip. Keep up the good work  üòä",5,2015,09,15
223,Not bad very expensive for alcohol,The food was good staff excellent service could not be faulted. Bad things were far too warm could not sleep even with windows wide open rooms not finished well not to 4 star standard exposed carpet grip visible under the radiator beside the bed in the room view from my room terrible filthy roof of an outbuilding or extension. Alcohol extremely expensive even if they are rated as a 4 star the price cannot be justified.that said the lady that greeted us in the morning for breakfast was extremely friendly and paitent with the volume of people seeking tables.,3,2015,09,15
223,Great night,"Stayed here for a girls nite out, what a lovely room & great service. Enjoyed the pool & other facilities. Would recommend this hotel highly to friends & family. Location is great to base yourself for exploring Dublin. ",4,2015,09,15
223,Castleknock hotel,"Great hotel to stay, reasonable price, they do great deals online.... food good, piano player in bar in evening, great golf course. Near a lot of sites,  Dublin Zoo, Phoenix Park, Pope Cross. not far from city centre etc.",5,2015,09,14
223,Dublin Booked out so  I tried here,"Booked here through Booking .com and got a special price ...............was very happy
Arrived at 19.00 straight to Reception no que so was happy with that . Got a room on second floor overlooking one of the greens. The room was clean very well furnished ( an idea for all hotel owners raise the level of your tv from desk top level to have the bottom of the tv around 3 ft or 1 m above the laying flat height of the bed it makes for more comfortable viewing when laying on the pillow).; Dined in the restaurant good food at reasonable price.Over all I definitely will be staying here again B&b and evening dinner for less than 120 euros",5,2015,09,12
223,A fleeting visit to a place I am very fond of,"We have stayed here on quite a few occasions however our last visit was just for tea and pastries and a chance to meet some old friends we got to know on our previous visits.
Always liked this hotel and spent many hours here in the past flying our company helicopter into the helipad at the hotel then waiting for the business meetings to finish and fly back to Donegal not as much fun as it sounds.",4,2015,09,09
223,Service above & beyond!,"Just spent a wonderful 2 nights here and I can't speak highly enough about the amazing staff and the attention we received.

My friend is undergoing chemotherapy and all of the staff could not have been more attentive or considerate to us all. The meals were excellent - breakfast, afternoon tea & dinner. The rooms were comfortable, spacious and impeccably well kept. 

Warm welcomes & kindness greeted us in every area of the hotel and we will definitely be recommending this hotel to friends & family. We will definitely be returning ourselves too! ",5,2015,09,09
223,Weekend away :-(,"For what we paid we were disappointed in the overall experience.  The breakfast was not to the standard expected for a 4 star. We had  a meal in the bar which was not good, my steak was char grilled had a bitter burnt taste.  We were also served by a new member of staff, who I felt was left to his own devices with little support.  We were disturbed on the Saturday morning before 8  by the housekeeper wanting to service our room, and felt under pressure to leave after we returned from breakfast. There were items missing from our room such as bottled water  and only one house coat was provided. ",3,2015,09,08
223,"First Visit to Dublin, Super Hotel if you have a car.","Amazing Hotel. Superb food  and helpful staff. Slight delay for breakfast, but when we got a table, an amazing selection was to be had. Swimming pool facilities were clean and loved the idea of wearing a swimming hat.. Maybe not charging for this would be kind as it seemed a bit petty for 3 euros each.",5,2015,09,07
223,excellent place for a wedding,"this hotel was brilliant. all the staff couldn't do enough for our wedding day. our guests were raving about the hotel,staff,food,rooms everything. We got married in the hotel on Sept the 4th and anything we wanted the hotel allowed. We had fireworks,fire-breathers, helicopter, and much more and the staff couldn't do enough for us and our guests.. a massive thank you to Siobhan, Nicola, and Sinead and of course Gavin and to all the staff. The most perfect day.",5,2015,09,07
223,This hotel serves the most devine afternoon tea you could wish for,"My friend was given a voucher for an afternoon's pampering and afternoon tea in this hotel. Neither of us had visited it before so were looking forward to the treats in store. We were greeted by a very friendly, smiling receptionist and from that moment we were looked after  100%. My friend and I had a lovely facial that lasted for thirty minutes and then we could relax for as long as we liked in the relaxation room, fully supplied with fresh fruit, an assortment of  herbal teas and coffee and  water . Well the best was yet to come after an hour of snoozing we made our way to The Park Restaurant for Afternoon Tea, only one word to describe it "" Heaven"" from start to finish, from the lovely friendly waitress to the gorgeous menu and as for a choice of beverages on the menu we could have tried them all. So if you want a lovely afternoon of pampering and luxurious food for the excellent price of ‚Ç¨25 for a Processo Afternoon Tea, which we had. there is also a choice of a Champagne Tea ‚Ç¨32 or just Afternoon Tea ‚Ç¨19 per head you wont be disappointed the best value  in Dublin by far and in lovely surroundings. We are planning our next trip which wont be too far away.",5,2015,09,04
223,Great for relaxation and,We were very pleased with this venue. Our son-in-law chose it. We didn't know it at all but will keep it in mind for future visits to Dublin. We walked back after Rock n Roll 1/2 marathon. It is well positioned for access to Phoenix Park area.,5,2015,09,01
223,DISGRACE!,"Just had literally the WORST customer/restaurant service experience ever. 

Food took too long. 

No acknowledgement from staff to be seated/served. 

Blatant discrimination based on attire (successful gym owner) 

No drink order when taking food order. 

Food order for light lunch was INADEQUATE, ABRUPT and RUDE. 

Completely un attentive staff, more interested in waltzing around than getting your water which I HAD TO ASK TO BE BROUGHT instead of being OFFERED like it is in any other good and bad establishment. 

Management to blame.

WILL NOT BE BACK! 

WILL NOT RECCOMMEND! 

WILL TELL OTHERS OF MY HORRENDOUS experience!

4 starts? Barely deserves the minimum 1 I have given here. 

DISGRACE.",1,2015,09,01
223,Patc,Professionally looked after our group. Meal was quite good though service could have been a bit faster. Bar staff on the ball and finally rooms were comfortable & spacious. Not 1st time here and standards are normally very good as it was on this occasion.  Didn't get a chance to try out their Spa/Pool/Golf Course but usually top notch.,4,2015,09,01
223,Lovely Tranquil Location,Stayed here while attending a business event in the hotel. Lovely quiet location just a 15 min  car or taxi ride from city centre. Nice open plan modern feel with super golf course close by. Beautiful hotel! I would suggest that some of the staff could do with refresher training in customer service. A smile and a warm greeting can make a big difference. My room was facing the rear entrance and the noise from early morning deliveries/activity and also from a generator engine of some sort was quite disturbing. The loud voices from cleaning staff moving up and down the corridor in the early morning was also somewhat annoying. These little things let down what is otherwise a fine establishment.,4,2015,09,01
223,much needed night away,"we had a lovely stay at the hotel. Staff were friendly and helpful. the room had everything we needed. lovely food and atmosphere. the swimming pool and spa was a real treat and we felt like we had the place to ourselves.
      
      
      ",4,2015,08,30
223,Lovely Place to Stay,"Lovely Place to Stay rooms big clean and tidy - ate in the hotel restaurant one night food ok but some great places to eat near by, the spa had a nice sauna and steam room which we used twice - overall a nice stay - Dublin town centre not so nice",4,2015,08,26
223,Afternoon Tea such a treat ,Myself and my friend visited the hotel for afternoon tea we got on a living social deal. It was such a treat. The food was amazing and a beautiful glass of prosseco. Such a nice relaxing way to spend an afternoon. I am looking forward to my next one already. ,5,2015,08,25
223,Such a lovely place...,"We were well received at the Reception and checked in with very helpful staff. Our room was brilliant, so quiet and cool, just what we asked for. The bed was massive and had the best three nights sleep ever. The room itself was pretty big, very spacious and we could actually open the windows wide. Large TV which made all the difference. We used the main restaurant and the food was superb! Perfect steak and perfect chicken, well...everything was just perfect! We went to bar restaurant the following evening and this was pretty good as well. The hotel facilities with their gym, sauna, steam room and pool were excellent, just ask about the best times if you would like a quiet time and they happily advise. The one thing that made this hotel that much nicer was the added touches....if you were going to sit outside there was a basket that contained rolled up blankets, bottles of sun cream and sunglasses for guests to use. Also, a selection of reading glasses next to the newspapers and umbrellas in the foyer. There was just two things that were not so good, the wifi in our room kept dropping off, fine in the large entrance seating area. The other thing was the music..... If I heard Karma Chameleon one more time ........it drove us a little bit crackers as there was no escape from listening to it and very repetitive. We loved the hotels location being out in the countryside, but close enough to Dublin and shopping centre. I must just finish by adding that each and every single member of staff that we came across made us feel very welcome with a smile on their face and eager to ensure that we had everything we needed. We shall most certainly return and for longer next time!",5,2015,08,22
223,Aug bank hol break,"We stayed for 2 nights at August bank holiday weekend and found it overall to be....ok. A couple of good things- room nice, lobby area huge plenty room for kids, breakfast great. The not so good things- bar staff poorest trained ever seen, poor kids club (none) just a room to dump them and forget them?(really?), set menu in restaurant, and just very expensive for what we got. 

We went on an annual break that we are prepared to spend a little extra for something nice but honestly this place is very expensive. Drinks and food from the bar are crazy. I got 5 small toasted sambos they cost ‚Ç¨73. I mean really it's just bread butter and a few bits! The service is really shocking. There are lots of staff but they dont know what they are doing. Several wearing ear pieces talking to someone really it makes no sense. They have a cocktail menu but when someone ordered a cocktail the whole service shuts down till all ingredients, etc are found. If you are going to offer a premium drinks service staff it properly. The set menu in the restaurant was odd, there wasn't anything normal on it no soup for instance, nothing wrong with trying to be a bit fancy but starters of raw beef, quail egg and then to stick a chicken main in the middle of the main menu as a token offering or something. Problem was the price of the set menu meant the chicken was not value. I ended up having the carrot and orange soup off the kids menu. An odd choice too but however. There is a restaurant in the golf club where we ate the night before and it's far superior and always fairly busy too. It does more ordinary food but really well. I would tell people not to eat at all in the hotel but choose the golf club. 

On a positive there is a decent playground, plenty of outside space and the rooms are nice. You just worry when you hear the words country club attached to a name that you are going to be offered something they can't do and yes they just don't get it right. 

It's such a shame the location is great but it just needs something. I will be back though.

223,Our Wedding Day & Stay,"Now that we are back to the land of the living and the dust has settled we would both like to say a huge thank you to the team at Castleknock hotel. 

Throughout the whole process the help and support was fantastic, each and every little query we had was dealt with quickly and professionally. 

The wedding day !!! 

Well what can we say about this‚Ä¶ EVERYTHING went amazingly. Each and every staff member over the two days were outstanding and a credit to the hotel and Guy. He has a fantastic team of staff and a well-oiled machine in the hotel ! 

There are a few people we would like to specifically mention. 

Nicola and Sinead ‚Ä¶. Thank you both so much. I can safely say without either of you the day would not have gone half as well as it did, you were both a fantastic help. 

Gavin .. Gavin was absolutely outstanding, his team on the day were flawless and we could not have asked for anyone better looking after us on our wedding day. No task was too big. 

Rachel ‚Ä¶ WOW, Rachel is a credit to the hotel, her hospitality and service at the top table was unbelievable.  She was an absolute gem to deal with.

Elena.. Well, what can we say‚Ä¶. Elena was an absolute pleasure to deal with over both days, we cannot express our thank you to this lady enough, words cannot describe how fantastic she was to us on the day of our wedding and the day after our wedding. We were both blown away by Elena and the service she provided us over both days. Her passion and love for her job was remarkable and it says a lot about the hotel to have such a happy and fantastic team behind them. Elena also came in on the Monday (her day off) to help us check out and get all our stuff together, this completely blew both of us away, it is very rare you would see this and again it really shows the love and commitment Elana has for her job and the Hotel. SHE IS AN ABOSLUTE CREDIT TO THE HOTEL. 

Andrew‚Ä¶In the words of Richie, what a genuinely sound, hardworking bloke! On the Sunday the service continued through Andrew, he never stopped from the time we met him on Sunday until the time we went to bed Sunday night. He was constantly in checking on us to ensure everything was ok and that we were well looked after ‚Ä¶. He was absolutely brilliant from start to finish.  

Bar staff and chefs ‚Äì The food was exceptional every person we spoke to raved about the quality and taste of the food was exceptional. Bar staff in both days were excellent , there was never a long wait time or a long que. 

Ellyn & Lorraine  ‚Ä¶ The reservation team were brilliant to deal with in regards to reservations. We had a few mishaps and nothing was too big for them to deal with. 

Last but not least !

Throughout our whole experience from organising the wedding to our wedding day and  the days after the wedding the one thing that stood out the most for us was the STAFF, each and every individual we dealt with from the reception team to floor staff , event managers and the background team were absolutely brilliant and we cannot thank you all enough.Our guests were blown away by the staff and the service they provided and it was relayed back to us by each and every person we spoke too.  Guy has an exceptional team with him and it really does show through the service and hospitality of the staff.  Coming from the hospitality industry I know I look out for stuff that others wouldn‚Äôt necessarily notice ,,, but there was genuinely nothing we could even begin to fault throughout the two years of planning the wedding right up until the wedding day. The day was fantastic and that was down to Castleknock hotel and its staff. We could not have chosen a better venue for our day. 

Again thank you all sooo much for everything. 

Ciara & Richie.",5,2015,08,19
223,Close to city but a country feel to it,"We've used the hotel for work, eaten in it and used its spa facilities. Its average in terms of food but good facilities, reasonable rates and location is excellent for Dublin city if you have a car and want to be outside the city centre.",4,2015,08,18
223,Castleknock overnight,"We stayed at the hotel on a Friday night. Checked in quickly and checkin staff very helpful. Had a good dinner in the bar with plenty choice of beers. Breakfast was great too with a huge variety.

After breakfast my wife used the spa services and had a facial while I used the gym and jacuzzi which was a very pleasant way to start the weekend.

Would definitely recommend this hotel for a relaxing stay and will be back.       ",5,2015,08,18
223,Relaxing break,"Just back from a two night stay at Castleknock and we had a fantastic time. The hotel is very good but I only gave four stars because there were a few things that niggled me. I'm not one for complaining and these aren't huge issues but I think it's always helpful for hotels to receive constructive criticism.

We had booked two family rooms and had requested that they be beside each other, or at the very least close by. Our friends arrived about ten minutes before us and had checked in and gone to their room by the time we arrived. We checked in and were given the key to Room 151. I texted our friends to say we had arrived and they replied to say they were next door in Room 235. I then rang them to explain we had been given Room 151 and they said that when they checked in the male receptionist had told them that we would be in Room 237 but it wasn't ready yet (despite check in being 3pm and this was now 3.40pm). We had been checked in by a female receptionist who had obviously panicked when she saw our room wasn't ready so had moved us to another room...which was on a different floor to our friends. I went down to reception and explained that we wanted to be beside our friends as requested and was told that the room wasn't ready...the housekeeping staff were frantically trying to clean room 237 whilst this conversation was going on...I explained that this wasn't a problem, we didn't mind waiting as our children wanted to go for a swim so there was no rush. We eventually moved to room 237 and I'm glad we did as it was a much nicer room (better decor and a bigger TV). 

Another gripe was that I rang down to reception and asked for towelling robes and was told they couldn't get any as the spa was closed but to ring down again in the morning once the spa was open. I did this but was then told that robes were only for guests staying in deluxe rooms but she offered to send them up for us anyway. She then rang back to say they didn't have any..... 

Apart from this, the hotel was very good. The pool is great (although children are only allowed in between 10am & 6pm which is a bit restrictive). The receptionist gives you towels on your way in so you don't need to carry any down from your room. 

The breakfast was outstanding. The best I've ever had in any hotel. We were down before 9am both days and it wasn't too busy. There is a brilliant choice and the staff constantly replenish everything so it never runs out. 

We had dinner in the restaurant on the Saturday night and again the food was outstanding. We did feel a bit nervous with the silver service though...it just felt a bit too grand when you've got young children with you. We were glad when other families with young children arrived and relaxed a bit more. We would have been happier sitting in the less formal restaurant to be honest but this was included in our package. The food was excellent but the male waiters were a bit cold in their manner. 

The housekeeping staff came to clean our room very early the first morning (they were there when we returned from breakfast at 9.45am and we had to wait for them to finish cleaning the bathroom so as we could use it before we headed out for the day) and they were cleaning rooms on our floor early again the morning we were due to check out so we put the Do Not Disturb on the door so as we could get ready in peace before checking out at 12pm.

The staff vary. Most of them are super nice but some are a bit rude and unfriendly. 

All in all a very good hotel that I would stay in again and would be happy to recommend. Very close to Dublin Zoo and Castleknock is a quick 5 minute drive away. We ate in Castello Bruno which was recommended by the hotel receptionist and it was very good! Very enjoyable weekend. ",4,2015,08,16
223,Best hotel stay...ever !!!,"We have just arrived back in England after a weeks stay at the Castleknock Hotel. We visted Ireland to find out information about our Irish family. The hotel room has been the most comfortable, modern,clean and spacous room..with a lovely view over the golf course. The staff have been so friendly and helpful ..They couldn't do enough to help..and that includes the breakfast staff, the bar, both restaurants, the cleaning staff and the Tonic spa staff(fantastic treatments and therapists).
Raphael was very helpful with our bags too ! The food was amazing. .especially last night in The Park...a wonderful 3 course meal. I was so relieved my Mum enjoyed it..who has never been to Ireland before.  Thankyou to all Castleknock staff for making our holiday. I can't recommend you enough !! Louise and Iris
",5,2015,08,15
223,Beautiful hotel but poor service,Waited about 15-20 minutes in bar on the our first night there but despite plenty of staff on duty no one came to take our order. We moved to lobby area and order was promptly taken but 10 minutes later wrong order. Next night order was taken promptly but after 20 minutes it had not arrived. I spoke to another staff member who brought my drink to me and did not charge for me for it. All in all very disappointing. My impression is that staff did not care. We won't be returning. ,2,2015,08,15
223,Tests your patience,"We stayed here for the night of the Rock and Roll half marathon with our toddler and four month old baby. 

We booked a family room but I couldn't see what was different in it to most hotel rooms (several family members were also staying), other than a higher tariff. The room was ok - my husband was far too hot and couldn't get comfortable. I'd just run 13.1 miles and could have slept standing up. The bathroom was ok - separate shower and bath - although the mould on the shower door was fairly advanced. With two travel cots the room was tiny and difficult to navigate. 

The pool was nice and a good temperature for little ones. There are also special kiddy swimming times and a lifeguard on duty. The jacuzzi was lovely too. 

We ate at the restaurant at lunch and then again at dinner. The service was incredibly slow - at dinner time we arrived at the restaurant at 6.30 with an exhausted two year old. At 7, I begged to order. At 8.00 I took my little one to bed even though our main courses still hadn't arrived. We complained but no one seemed remotely interested. 

Similarly next morning we were up early and went to breakfast when it was quiet. My husband put down his fork and his plate was lifted immediately whereas when we tried to get some more coffee we couldn't find a member of staff. 

The issue with service seemed to be the main problem with the hotel - some of the staff seemed great, others totally inept. On the day we checked out I went and sat in the lobby to feed my daughter. I planned to get a coffee while I was there but 45 minutes later I hadn't been able to attract any attention from the staff so gave up. I did however observe that every guest leaving the breakfast area received an apology for the long delays they had encountered. Not just us then! 

Stupidly, when we checked out we left our baby's travel bed in the room. I phoned the same day to try to recover it and the lady on reception was lovely. It took several more phone calls and emails before we managed to get the bed back, however. The hotel only charged us postage and we were grateful to recover the bed but, again, it was frustrating trying to get a response. I would suggest that this hotel has the potential to be good, but quite honestly there are so many good hotels in Dublin that this one doesn't seem worth testing your patience over. 

",2,2015,08,14
223,Wonderful hotel,Lovely hotel food was great room excellent comfortable bed and good size room close to Dublin zoo had a really enjoyable stay at this hotel staff all very helpful and friendly diffentley recommend a stay at this hotel.,5,2015,08,13
223,Nice but could be better,"Nice hotel, seem a bit understaffed esp in main area, staff great though. Bedrooms were nice but not amazing, expected amazing when pay extra. Pool lovely,  spa treatments  weren't great, had much better (had treatment over year ago and haven't returned for one because of this, may have changed )
Main restaurant,  food lovely, very dark and lacking atmosphere,  feels a bit stiff.  Overall nice  hotel  can't complain  about it but could be amazing ",4,2015,08,11
223,Business,We have used this hotel for several work functions and events . The last visit was somewhat of an eye opener as I had a male member of staff barge into my room without knocking at 10.30 am ( check out was mid day ) I was undressed and alone so you can imagine my concern here it was more fear than embarrassment . He left and I quickly dressed and packed my bag and left . Upon leaving I advised staff   And they were polite and just reinforced the check out times and gave me managers details he seemed quite relaxed about the whole thing,1,2015,08,10
223,Average!,"Booked to stay here for one night to listen to a band showcase for our wedding. As we booked last minute we paid ‚Ç¨200 for bnb with evening meal. Prob bit expensive but we thought it would be worth it as the hotel looked lovely. Very disappointed when we got there! The reception area is beautiful and very impressive. The room was a massive let down. Our deal was for a basic double room. Having paid ‚Ç¨200 for one night we thought the rooms must be nice...they are not! Very basic, no character, paint chipping, marks on the walls. The bed is probably the most uncomfortable bed I ever slept on and the pillows were rock hard! I'm all for getting what you pay for and if we had paid ‚Ç¨60 for this room I would have said fair enough but not for the price we paid! Really let the hotel down and I'm not picky at all!! The dinner was ok, set menu with not much choice. We sat in the lobby to have a drink which  was nice. Tried to book a spa treatment before we arrived but was told they had no appointments but that night sat in the lobby watching the girls working in the spa sit across from us drinking an hour before spa closed!Again over all the hotel is fine but only if you get a good deal! ",3,2015,08,09
223,Wedding,I have just been to a wedding at the castleknock hotel and I just wanted to say how wonderful a day it was. We knew from the moment we got such a lovely warm welcome at the door from Elena that it was going to a lovely place. The wedding room was fantastic and beautifully decorated. The food was delicious and service excellent. I could see Elena again taking such good care of all the guests and my niece said that she took such great care of her from the moment they arrived. I would fully recommend this hotel for a wedding or any other party. unfortunately we could not stay the night so  can not comment on the bedrooms. But myself and my husband will be back to try them out.. thanks again for a lovely day.,5,2015,08,09
223,Relaxing Hotel,"Every year we do  a Mother & Daughter Spa two nights  stay in this hotel , as we checked in I ask the receptions if a room Fan was in my room , I phoned the hotel earlier requesting one ? she said well then you should have one  with a tone. when we got to our room there wasn't one and we couldn't get Wi-Fi with our room code, so when I went to the same Receptions,   I was told, (well no one else has Problems)?   bit of a Nonsense then later our shower wouldn't cool down it was just getting hotter on its own, we were giving a up grade room to find that we couldn't opening the bed room door because they put new carpet into all room but never shave the doors!! but glad to say we were giving a other room at last . myself and daughter enjoyed our GF food in the Avenue Bar &Restaurant , enjoyed the pool ,  and had a Comfortable stay. ( lots of kids running around  at night)",4,2015,08,07
223,"far from anything, so taxi taxi everywhere!","i was expecting more for the money i paid. a good hotel, just nothing special. there were some minor issues (forgotten wake up call three times!) and some rude wait staff in the restaurant, BUT the manager does all to make things right. clean, comfortable and easy, just not the quality i expected for the price i paid. the steam and sauna were wonderful.",3,2015,08,07
223,Excellent stay,Stayed Sunday 2 August overnight and had a relaxing evening .Food and service excellent and good value for money . Room clean and tidy with a comfortable bed .Staff excellent and well trained in their roles,5,2015,08,05
223,A very busy hotel,"First impression are very important when you go to receptions at a hotel and here this ticked all the boxes. Nice and friendly, key card pack also held wi-fi code so all ok there. 
Key Card had to be used at all times when you were going in the lift on the way up a little bit of a nonsense when you are dealing with luggage but good for security.
Room larger than most hotels, clean and cosy. Food good, but menu a bit sparse and being 5 kilometres from nowhere you went through the menu quickly, desserts mean.
Staff all over very good and helpful.",4,2015,08,02
223,Highly recommended,"Our Family Room was spacious, tastefully decorated and very comfortable.  Excellent food served in The Avenue Bar & Restaurant and first class service throughout our stay!  Close to Dublin Zoo and Tayto Park.  Highly recommended for families.",5,2015,07,31
223,Nice for a family get away,I stayed here with my family last week. We got a fantastic deal of 2 nights b&b upgrande to new deluxe and bottle of wine for ‚Ç¨212. Great deal. The hotel is very clean and staff are extremely friendly. The food is above average. I ordered a prawn and cous cous salad and there was very little cous cous on my plate. This pool is great for kids but overall would need some thorough cleaning done to it. The little park out the back is great and the spa is very relaxing. I would recommend to families it's a great hotel.,4,2015,07,31
223,Nephews christening ,"When we arrived earlier than expected the staff and the limetree bar were not prepared for the christening party.
My sister in law and my hubby and kids had to find the balloon decorations that had been left earlier.
When the food was served the hot meal was beef strogonaff which sadly had no real flavour but the beef was tender,the bread was yummie and cold meats and cheeses were tasty.
As for the younger children the option of chicken goujons/burger and chips were slightly cool not totally cold .
The staff were very friendly and fun to talk to .
In all it was an ok event but some air conditioning was needed with a crowded room the heat does build up !!",3,2015,07,26
223,Afternoon at Castleknock ,"Guy Thompson General Manager,on the inspiration of Gael Cooke Allen Sales Manager reached out to guests from Castleknock Blanchardstown,Laurel Lodge and home parish of Porterstown  last Thursday 23rd. As Castleknock Hotel is celebrating its 10th successful year trading in Castleknock area the staff invited local people to their hotel as a gesture of gratitude for their support. As a guest on that list I can only say we were treated like KINGS and QUEENS to Champaign savoury foods,pastries galore baked on site by their very own PATISSERIE CHEF. Fresh strawberries and cream....and nd much more. We had a most wonderful day. The staff are second to none. We are very lucky to have a hotel of such Quality on our doorstep. ...rumour has it THE IRISH FOOTBALL TEAM WILL BE STAYING THERE VERY SOON.üòò. 
We will be supporting our Local Hotel for sure.",5,2015,07,25
223,What a great time,"I really enjoyed being here the service is fast and friendly. My co workers have had a great time. 
Price is also good and great quality. 

Rooms are great quality

But the noise in the lobby is horrible and kids are really annoying me and my team. The bar is amazing and sonis the restaurant.

I have to wait a few minutes to get service at the bar",5,2015,07,17
223,wonderful,"went here for a weekend birthday party, lovely rooms we had a 3 bed, it was great 3 single comfy beds. spa nice, you do need to wear a swim hat in the pool, take one, 3 euro to buy, a lot of children in pool. food very nice, service perfect, would go back in a heart beat.",5,2015,07,16
223,Beautiful Place!,"I stayed here for 4 days as an anniversary present. The hotel was really lovely. The hotel staff were very helpful with every request. 

The hotel is located a way out of Dublin. But there is a local train station of Coolmine about a good 20 minuet walk away then the train is ‚Ç¨6 return for an adult and takes 20 minuets to Connolly, central Dublin. 

The hotel offers a spa, Tonic, I would recommend the couples escape massage for 1 hour 30 minuets. The spa is cheaper during the week and I was also offered 10% for being a quest at the hotel. I would pre book as very busy. 

The stay was fabulous. I would definitely recommend this hotel. A perfect place to relax and still see Dublin if you are prepared to walk a lite bit.",5,2015,07,12
223,fabulous!!!!!,"The most fabulous hotel I have stayed in! Just had a lovely break at the Castleknock Hotel & Country Club, and it was absolutely perfect, all the staff were so lovely, always smiling, polite and helpful, and seemed to really enjoy their work, but I have to give particular mention to one of the staff, a manager, Stephen O' Sullivan, who was on duty on the evening of our arrival, he was just brilliant! My two children were delighted when he showed us the outdoor kids play area and The Walnut Suite, which is the dedicated children's room, they loved the kids sized pool table there, as well as the Wii.                                                                                                  Stephen gave us great advice on things to do in the area for our stay, which proved to be a hit with the family. I mentioned I was a vegetarian, so he recommended some dishes available in the hotel restaurant, and the gratin that I chose was just delicious! He remembered our names and he is a brilliant asset to the hotel .                           There was great variety at the breakfast buffet, and the pool area is so relaxing!",5,2015,07,10
223,"Nice clean hotel, bit on the warm side though!","Really nice hotel, stayed for 3 nights with wife and 4 yr daughter. Bar food was reasonably priced and not bad. Room spotless , shower could do with an upgrade and no air con in the room, which was far too warm. But great staff, nice location. Would probably book again.",4,2015,07,08
223,Happy wedding Days at Castleknock,"We were invited to a wedding at Castleknock Hotel. Lovely place. We were welcomed when we checked in (early, by arrangement) by very friendly staff. The room was spacious and had a wonderful en suite with bath and shower.
The usual toiletries and accessories. Room had Tea, coffee and you could get fresh milk from reception.
The wedding was fabulous and the food great. There were hot snacks near the evening's end, along with tasty sandwiches.
Breakfast the following morning was self service, but what a choice. 
Very pleased with Castleknock hotel.
JK & SK Dublin",5,2015,07,07
223,Very disappointing ,"Booked a suite for myself and girlfriend, paid for late checkout and ""romantic package""  no wine or chocolates in room and left waiting for 40 mins for it to arrive after complaining, room card stopped at 12 even tho paid for late checkout. Tried to order room service at 9:45pm but was told only sandwiches available as kitchen was closed, even though room services menu states that it's open until 10pm. Tray of food outside in corridor for duration of our stay. Very disappointed as I had spent a lot of money to have a nice time but was hindered by poor service. Won't be returning. Wasn't all bad as room was spotless, food was nice. Staff I encountered during my stay where very helpful and courteous. ",1,2015,07,06
223,"Clean, Comfortable and Relaxing","We arrived four hours early at this hotel as we had an early flight and it doesn't take long to drive there from the airport. We went in to the hotel to ask if we could leave our luggage and they let us check in early for no extra charge.

The reception staff were helpful - providing us with directions, for public transport and local pubs, and giving us change for our larger notes. 

Our room was a good size and very clean. We had a room at the back of the hotel, looking over the flat roof of the restaurant, and there was a generator (or some sort of machinery) running for most of the day which is a bit loud, but this was switched off by about 9pm so didn't stop us sleeping. 

The food and drink at the hotel was nice - the food was fresh and the deserts were delicious - and it wasn't massively overpriced as it sometimes can be in larger hotels.

There was live music in the lounge area on both nights. This was relaxing and the music was (luckily) to our taste. We weren't badgered to spend money on drinks, we got them at our own leisure. Sky sports news was silently on the screens keeping a happy medium for sports fans and music fans. 

The facilities at the hotel (pool, sauna, steam room etc) were clean and good for relaxing (1 euro coin needed for locker)

The area surrounding the hotel is well maintained and we felt safe walking. The bus links to Dublin were frequent and I'd happily base myself here again if I return to Ireland.",4,2015,07,06
223,A real chill out weekend,"What a way to end the week we've had in Dublin! UK holiday last week & we are staying here for the weekend as it's our wedding anniversary while going to see The Frames. 

Lovely to experience the nearby Phoenix Park at times (late evening) when we usually wouldn't have time for spending time in it as we don't live up here anymore (moved to Kilkenny recently) 

The casual seating area in the main section of hotel is lovely for a cocktail or a read of the papers or reviewing on TripAdvisor! 

Dinner in the Park Restaurant is gorgeous. Breakfast is very tasty. Wait staff are lovely. We had lunch out at a cafe in a nearby town but the lunch menu here looks good.

Check-in was easy and rooms are high quality although I never like looking at hotel aircon units when I look out my window. 

Spa is nothing to rave about though which was the only dampner on our wonderful 2 weeks. 
",4,2015,07,04
223,Very Good,"Was over with my young Family for a Wedding. Staff were excellent as were the facilities. Our room was more than adequate too.

Just a shame I didn't (couldn't) have had the golf clubs with me to further utilise the facilities. I have family in Blanchardstown and would stay at this Hotel again on future visits.

",4,2015,07,03
223,Relaxing short overnight stay!,Lovely room - great breakfast - friendly helpful stAff. We stayed and booked as a group going to a concert in Croke park taxi in shared was ‚Ç¨22 between us so not too bad - all in all great value,4,2015,07,03
223,Thoughts on a one night stay.,"Had to overnight close to Phoniness Park and this place fit the bill. Booking in was a friendly experience and we were upgraded to a better room, always good. The hotel is big and that does make it feel just a little impersonal but, the staff are friendly and efficient. The evening meal was fine, though the table we were given was constantly being passed by staff so it felt a little like Grand Central Station. No complaints about the food though, cooked well and tasty. Not much of a delay between order and service either. The room was clean and well appointed, the free WiFi was not too slow and the TV of good size. Only one easy chair? Little odd in a double room at this price. Good bed and quiet. Don't think I would recommend this place as a romantic getaway, but as a jumping off point for Dublin or a family hotel it fits the bill nicely.",4,2015,07,03
223,Cannot recommend this hotel highly enough!!!,"We stayed here as part of a Living Social deal.  Some businesses make you feel inferior if you are there on a voucher deal - give you a basic menu, or give you basic facilities.  But I can hand on heart say this hotel made no reference to be voucher, other than to ask for it at check in.  Beyond that the stay was fantastic and we were treated as valued guests.  Check in was easy, the room was beautifully clean and (hooray!!) a cot was already in the room.  We travel to the South very often and 9 times out of 10 we have to request cots again because they are never put in the room before we get there.  There was a lovely chilled bottle of wine waiting, and a plate of dark chocolates beside it.
We ate off the early bird menu on the first night.  We had been delayed arriving and technically were after the time of the menu, but they honoured our booking.  Our son was provided with his kiddie meal and some crayons to keep him entertained.
Breakfast is fantastic - freshly cooked and kept nice and hot.  Great selection of pastries, fruit, cereal, cheese, salmon, make you own granola - everything.  The morning newspapers even have reading glasses beside them.
Tuesday was a scorcher of a day and the hotel left sun cream and towels by the doors to the sun seats and play park.  A great touch.  The pool is lovely and warm and very suitable for children - there are two shallow areas for them to play in.  Changing rooms were tidy and clean and well supplied with toiletries.  My partner had a massage and thoroughly enjoyed that also.
We were due to leave on the Wednesday but enjoyed the hotel so much we stayed another night and visited the Zoo and Blanchardstown Retail Park.  The reception desk took care of the whole thing - we stayed in the room we were in and the rescheduled our afternoon tea to the next day.  
The afternoon tea is a MUST! Great value for money, a three tier stand of scones, cakes and desserts as well as a platter of sandwiches.  Served in their restaurant overlooking the park and golf area - enjoy a cocktail with it as well as a special treat.

I really cannot shout loudly enough about this hotel - I haven't stopped telling people about it since we came home.  My partner is a senior retail manager and his boss used the example of reading glasses and sun cream to tell his staff that extra details make consumer experiences stand out! Treat yourself to this hotel, you won't be disappointed.",5,2015,07,01
223,Afternoon Tea,"My mother and I had Afternoon tea in Castleknock Hotel last week June 2015. I cannot recommend it highly enough.  The food and the service were both excellent. In my opinion beats the Afternoon Tea in the Westbury hands down.
We will definitely be back.",5,2015,07,01
223,A great hotel for business.,"Located close to the n3 in a comfortable suburb, close to many corporate headquarters, the Castleknock is modern, has an excellent bar/restaurant and a golf course and pool. For us tourists, it was somewhat out of the way. Impossible without a vehicle. Nevertheless, I'd stay there again because they treated us well. Next time I'll park at the train station to go downtown.  Thank goodness for the brown signs directing you to the hotel. You can drive straight through Phoenix and find the hotel from Castleknock village by following the signs.",4,2015,06,30
223,Nice stay in Executive Suite,"We stayed for two nights with our baby in an executive Suite. The room itself was lovely, bright, modern, spacious and lovely views of the golf course. There was plenty of space for the travel cot and all the other bits and pieces needed when travelling with a baby!
However upon arrival there was a breakfast tray outside our room from the previous guests and it was not removed until later that night. Also there was a smell of smoke in the room.
We ate in the restaurant the first night. The food was lovely and the staff were very helpful and accommodating with the baby.
The second night we ate in the bar, the food was lovely but the service was slow. We were waiting nearly 30 mins for dessert and there was delays when getting drinks from the bar too.
The Jacuzzi was out of order on the first morning of our stay. Overall this is a nice hotel but if it is to be a true 4 star it needs to work on the issues mentioned above. ",3,2015,06,30
223,Inviting Friendly and Lovely Hotel,"Stayed overnight with my daughter for a spa treatment and girls night out had a few disappointments' mainly to bad luck rather than issues with the hotel ,our day was turned around completely by Shane the bar manager. The room was spacious and comfortable ,the staff in the hotel are really friendly from Charlotte who served us dinner to Andrew the bar man .The little extras in the hotel were clever touches and helped give us a terrific experience. Would definitely recommend and stay here again...",5,2015,06,30
223,Lovely place to stay,"I've stayed in this hotel several times over the last few years. I love the fact that although it's very convenient for the city, it's far enough out to be very relaxing and comfortable. Staff always very friendly, rooms very comfortable and breakfast is great with lots of choice.",4,2015,06,30
223,Thought it was fine!!,"We recently stayed here for a romantic getaway and thought it was fine!! Food was nice thou on our first night I ordered a shredded bbq sandwich meal with chips which was lovely but came with no salad r veg!! Felt it was missing something! The above review for the spa not being a real one is accurate- but I got a full body massage and it was gorgeous!! The relaxation room was exactly as described above- a dark hotel room with candles but it was nice! Niall in the tonic spa was especially helpful and v friendly- a credit to the venue!!
We had a lovely room with a HUGE bed and a nice view so no complaints that way! We paid ‚Ç¨200 for 2nghts b&b and evening meal which I think was good value for money! And I'd go there again!!",4,2015,06,30
223,"so near to home, a world apart","Stayed in Castleknock Hotel and Country Club recently and enjoyed it very much, particularly the spa treatments (and most especially the facial from Shauna, which was really really excellent - I'd go back again just for a facial from her). There was some function on the first evening and there seemed to be a lot of children but the food in the restaurant was gorgeous, and I'm vegetarian and it's not often I say that about hotel food. The chef gave me, at my request, one of the dishes from the bar or lunch menu because I didn't want the pasta on offer as the vegetarian option, and it was delicious. 
I loved the sun lotions and sunglasses laid out for customer use at the entrance to the patio/outside tables, and the fleecy blankets which we used later on that evening when it got colder. But the music/ musak is really really horrible and I found it very intrusive and annoying - other than that I'd be giving this hotel a five-star review.",4,2015,06,28
223,Nice value for money castle-like Hotel in Colin Farell's old neighbourhood,"About a 20-30 minute drive from Dublin airport lies the Castleknock Hotel & Country club. It is a lovely  big place that looks like a dreamy castle from the outside. Matching to this, one of the doormen's name is Charles. The service was excellent. Plenty of space to park a car, nice spacious rooms and Castleknock is only a 15 min train ride away from Dublin city center. Bathrooms were nice too and the hotel is in general very clean! We had a very nice stay for 2 nights.",4,2015,06,26
223,We loved it,"We stayed here for 3 nights from the 16th to the 19th June and we were wowed by the whole experience, beginning with Grace on reception, what a star above and beyond the call of duty was her ethos.
We ate in the Bar the 3 nights we stayed the food was that good we didn't want to eat anywhere else & the staff were amazing to watch, the communication between them and the speed at which they operated was outstanding. Sarah & Charlotte were the 2 stars in the Bar, they are gems treasure them CHCC.
The room was beautiful with everything catered for and the bed was so comfortable we slept soundly during our stay, and the doors have very good dampers on them so there was no banging of doors as you try sleep as they close softly. Bliss.
The leisure centre is amazing and has everything you could want, but for me what really was wonderful was as you went out to the garden area by the bar there were the biggest assortment of items to make your sitting out comfortable, sunglasses, various factor sun creams, blankets, umbrellas, all weather was catered for. Unbelievable CHCC you guys are amazing and have found 2 new clients who can't wait to come back.",5,2015,06,25
223,Good all rounder,"Stayed for work. Rooms very spacious n modern. Food was delicious and staff very helpful n friendly. Impressed with the little touches, .i.e . Sunglasses, suncream, n blankets available on the way out to the patio area to cover all eventualities!",4,2015,06,25
223,Great Birthday Break but beware room allocation,"Our overall experience was great. Friendly service, good breakfast and terrific spa facilities. The initial room we were given was very shabby, but as soon as we expressed our disappointment we were upgraded to a fabulous room and told that the original room was still awaiting refurbishment. Later on in the new room we then had a problem with the toilet being blocked and, without hesitation, we were then moved to an even more amazing executive suite. So we had three different rooms in our three night stay, but such was the good attitude of the management that we remained in good humour. You need a car to access centre of Dublin.",4,2015,06,22
223,Hen do,"11 of us stayed from 20th June to the 22nd of June . What a fantastic hotel , brilliant fun staff . We also got to try the spa day , treatments were  amazing . Special thanks to Dean from the hotel for making out stay even better . All the girls at the spa for having magic hands !",5,2015,06,22
223,Fab stay !,"Myself & my boyfriend are just home from an amazing weekend away at this brilliant hotel! Everything was perfect and we couldn't have asked for a better place to say. The surroundings are beautiful, hotel itself is stunning & the whole feeling about the hotel is incredibly friendly. It was quite expensive for just one night however we did not mind spending the money as it was more than worth it. The staff are so warming and welcoming! By far the best break and hotel we have ever stayed in! Definitely be recommending this hotel to family & friends !",5,2015,06,21
223,Good hotel,"Stayed here for two nights and it was a pleasant experience. It was hard to find even with sat av. Accommodation was four star and so were the staff;very pleasant at reception. 
Only fault was the dinner in the evening. Our waiter was over familiar and our group all felt he just crossed the line! The food itself was very good but having to ask for bread and when it arrived no butter was annoying. Same little gripe about teas & coffees we had to wait nearly 45 mins before it arrived. Hou would expect basis standards of service and monitoring of what was required.
The hotel is a bit out of the way but I would return",4,2015,06,17
223,Great Hotel,"Lovely, modern, clean hotel. Very helpful and friendly staff. The spa is brilliant. Great bar food. I have been here a few times, with family, friends and husband. We will be returning again.",5,2015,06,17
223,Amazing hotel,Stayed for two nights for birthday. Staff are so friendly and nothings too much trouble. Great location and scenery . Nice rooms. Modern looking. One of the nicest hotels ive been to. Cant fault anything,5,2015,06,15
223,Night away in Dublin,"Nice hotel, Initially met by a very friendly efficient Receptionist namedTeresa.  Received a complimentary upgrade to a suite because it was my birthday. fabulous suite.  We ate in the restaurant that night and attended to by very efficient manager and waitress. We didn't use any other facilities as we were out all day at Bloom.  Overall a lovely hotel with friendly helpful staff.",5,2015,06,12
223,"Lovely hotel, great room and friendly staff","I recently booked this hotel for a two day business trip. On the day of my travel to Dublin I got a call from the hotel to say that they had doubled booked my room (which I was not happy about) however they had already found me another place to stay, offered to pay for my additional taxi fare and upgraded me too for my stay at Castleknock. The staff really went to a great lengths to ensure that I was looked after. I will certainly stay there again.",4,2015,06,11
223,Debit card debacle!,"We stayed at the hotel last week-end with my family to attend my cousin's wedding. The hotel itself is fairly predictable in its decor and facilities. The main issue I have with the hotel is its position regarding deposits - or lack of. Apparently if you don't pay by credit card then you have to pay up front - not sure why -,perhaps they've had one runaway guest too many? 
To date 447 euros have been 'blocked' from my bank account since last Friday when we checked in (it is now Wednesday): which presumably means its in their bank account - apparently I will be refunded but this will take 'five working days', so no guesses for who gets the interest. 
On checking my bank account this morning an extra 149 euros has also been taken out - just called to ask why and they promised a call back.
The feeling we got is that the staff are overworked and under-trained - it is clearly not the receptionist's fault that the company she is employed by are using some questionable payment practices in their operation.
How could this situation be made better: tell customers from the outset that if they are paying by debit card/cash that they will pay up front. Also tell customers who are having make-up done at the Spa that it is cash only. Oh, and if the young trainee at dinner on Friday night asked us one more time if we were 'on the package' we might have screamed.",3,2015,06,10
223,Appalling dish,Paid 14.00 euro for a stew that I could only compare to a pair of old rubber boots as opposed to the beef that was advertised ! One small positive was a nice flavoured sauce which was overridden by the sore jaws that I experienced as a result of trying to chew said rubber boots !,1,2015,06,09
223,Excellent hotel!,"I stayed here with friends last week while on a trip to Dublin.  Our room was really spacious, clean and comfortable.  We ate in the Avenue restaurant before going into the city center - a really good menu with lots of choices to suit all tastes - and the food was marvelous. All the staff we met were very friendly - really good stay!",5,2015,06,09
223,Birthday treat weekend,"Spent the weekend of 5th to 7th June in this great hotel. Driving into it we knew it was going to be a lovely hotel. On arrival we were dealt with at desk promptly and when arrived in room we had been treated with an upgraded room, a bottle of wine, a balloon and card and chocolates and a fruit basket as it was my birthday. A fantastic gesture by the hotel and staff. After drinking the bottle of wine and watching the golfers pick their gold balls out off the small lakes adjacent the hotel (üòÇ) we decided to hit the bar / lounge and try out the cocktails and other beers. We had our dinner in the modern avenue restaurant and had a lovely sharing platter with other small plates. Very nice. Next day after our lovely breakfast which there was plenty to choose from ,we visited the pool , spa and steam room / sauna which was fantastic and refreshed us after previous nights cocktails. With the weather unfortunately bring very blustery we were unable to sit out in the lovely seated areas but did try for 5 mins. Had light lunch in the avenue and booked the park restaurant for later on that night. Both were lovely again .. On Sunday we done the pool thing again before checking out at 1pm which was great. All in all could not recommend this hotel and staff enough as both were fantastic and helpful and would certainly return ..if only the weather was better it would have been a 5 star stay. !! üëçüòÉ",5,2015,06,08
223,A wonderful place!,"This hotel was more than we imagined. Besides being on beautiful grounds the inside was spotless and very nice. I was more impressed with the honesty of the staff.  I left money and some valuables in the safe. I was two hours away when I realized it and called them immediately. Spoke with the front desk, with Keith and he went right away and checked with housekeeping.  They did find the money and valuables and put it away in their safe.  Keith then called me back and told me they did find it and it was locked up.  I felt secure enough to leave it there until my return to Dublin in five days.  Went to the hotel when I returned to Dublin and sure enough, all my cash and valuables were accounted for!  Thank you so much!",5,2015,06,06
223,Great place to stay,"We were not at the hotel much during the stay but my favorite thing without question was going down every night and having a pint and talking to Andrew and David the bar tenders,  great guys, super professional and frankly the highlight of the stay for me.  I met plenty of nice people but on night two each of them knew my name and always greeted ,e with and handshake and curiosity about my adventures that day,  I can't say enough about how these two made the stay enjoyable.

Aside from that Indre, the assistant manager was also great with helping us deal with our airline.  Funny, sweet, and generally amusing.

One point of advice, of your stay focuses on Dublin, budget an extra $150 to cover taxis because you can take the bus but it is a pain.",5,2015,06,05
223,Excellent!,I have always found the Castleknock Hotel and Country Club an excellent choice when staying in Dublin. Rooms are very comfortable and maintained to a very high standard. Food in either restaurants is good and staff are extremely friendly and helpful. Gym and pool are also very well kept. You will get cheaper hotels in Dublin but very few better.,5,2015,06,05
223,The reception are a credit to the hotel,"Stayed here with my partner and overall had a very nice stay. Was apprehensive with some of the reviews but I didn't see one thing wrong with it in my opinion and am bewildered at where the negative reviews came from. The receptionist with the glasses I think her name was Shauna was very helpful and friendly, she gave great personality to the hotel, a real gem in my opinion. 

Lovely grounds and is in a peaceful setting. Food was lovely and I found a few bar staff quite rude but other than that we were very pleased.",4,2015,06,03
223,Fantastic break what a hotel ,From the moment we walked in the staff where fantastic..made my mam feel very special on her birthday...With special thanks to ingrind what a lovely welcome...Food was amazing..will definitel be back...:-) :-) :-) ,5,2015,06,02
223,Beautifully presented but lacking content!!!,"On arrival I was very impressed with the setting,beautiful bar and pianist in the lobby. It was late so we went straight to the bar to eat. Decent food but had to ask twice for a drink as we never got it the first time. When we got to the room 258 we were very disappointed. Only one dressing gown and pair of slippers. The picture on the wall was stuck in with Sellotape on the corners,the shower tray had black mould all around the bottom,the wall in the bathroom was cracked and plaster falling out. The door was scratched and old looking. When the shower was on there' was a smell coming from the trap. We ordered breakfast to the room for 9am but it didn't arrive until 9.45. Porridge was stone cold but yet the orange juice was warm and tasted out of date.This place is very expensive, nice for a drink but don't waste your money staying here.",1,2015,06,01
223,Very Disappointing Afternoon Tea!,"Came to the Castleknock Hotel for a relaxing night with the girls. We were delighted to see that they offered afternoon tea and booked ourselves in.
When we arrived into the dining room the room was extremely cold. We had to askthe waitress to close the windows as it was so uncomfortable. 
We chose the prosecco afternoon tea. The teapot was metal (not what you'd expect at an afternoon tea) and leaked so badly we had puddles on our table. We then had to ask for more tea when the pot was empty and were brought a bigger metal teapot, which also leaked all over the table. 
The menu looks so appealing and we were excited for the food to arrive. However to our disappointment, we quickly realised the menu was very misleading. The quality and presentation of the sandwiches was so poor. The ""smoked salmon and lemon butter"" had plain butter on brown soda bread that wasn't that fresh. The ""maple glazed ham & gubben cheese"" sandwich was something a toddler would have in their lunchbox. The ham was not glazed and it was red cheddar, not grubeen on sliced pan bread cut using a scone cutter. It appeared to have been made by a child. The so called ""truffled"" egg mayonnaise was like it was bought in a deli. 
The scones were described in the menu as ""almond and white chocolate and cheese and chive"". Neither of these came to the table. Instead we were presented with plain or fruit scones that were heated but not made fresh. We saw the same scones on a tray at the bar which is where they obviously came from. We also had to ask the waiter for butter and jam as it never arrived. 
There wasn't much of an improvement as we moved on to the pastries. There were no coconut macaroons as the menu stated but a coconut ball with a drizzle of chocolate over it. The ""red velvet and vanilla battenburg"" appeared shop bought and was stuck to the plate requiring a knife to scrape if off. 
We were in the dining room with only one other table yet we had to go out and find a waitress to ask for the bill when we were  finished. At ‚Ç¨25, we felt it was overpriced for a very disappointing experience. The only positive I can take from it was the glass of prosecco was lovely. I wouldn't recommend the afternoon tea here at all and won't be coming here for it again.",1,2015,05,31
223,amazing suite,"this hotel was great from start to finish. booked a suite (surprise for my birthday) and it was fantastic.  dinner was included  in  the offer. 4 courses... starters were lovely but hubby didn't like them so they happily substituted one for him. steaks were amazing. deserts were yummy (expresso Panna cotta)
staff were so helpful - Keith and monika. fab ... even brought mine out with a candle xxx thank u so much",5,2015,05,31
223,A nice spot!,"Once you get passed the overwhelming flowery fragrance as you enter, it's a lovely hotel
The rooms are nice and do their job
Not luxury, but well presented 
The staff I met were all incredibly friendly and helpful, and genuinely so!

In particular the lady on breakfast guard duty, saw to my seating requirements while fending off an elderly, loud American couple who didn't understand why they had to wait all of 20 seconds!!!!
Well handled indeed....
Bar area was nice, vibrant and service was with a smile
I threw a spanner in the works with my tab, but the girl serving overcame, and never made it my issue...

A really nice place to crash after a drunken tour of Dublin :)",4,2015,05,31
223,it's my birthday,"hubby booked a ""suite"" Omg amazing... had a massage and dinner. ... couldn't ask for more. staff were  very helpful.  room AMAZING  
my newest fav hotel in dublin 

it was a surprise for my 40th birthday... child free yippee",5,2015,05,30
223,A lovely room but for for tall deaf men,"This hotel has fantastic facilities but a few annoying things spoilt an otherwise excellent stay. The rooms are not woman friendly. A step is needed to hang anything up in the wardrobe and there is no full length mirror. Walls between rooms are paper thin so whispers can be heard from the next room.

Other than that the rooms were well specced, spacious with a comfortable bed.

Otherwise",3,2015,05,30
223,Shame i had no golf clubs,"Stayed here this week, and very nice, however some things i did not like so much, the bathrooms were not really very well thought out and had no great surface areas to put your bits, the shower as well was a little underwhelming with no curtain, or even a hook to hold on the wall as you showered, in all rooms, as if it was an after thought.  A little bit out of town, but you may like that.  Not the greatest bar, but it did have good breakfast on offer in the Morning, better than average.",5,2015,05,29
223,Good Hotel.,"Pro's: Not a bad little spot to go and have a relaxing time with the family or as a couple. The decor is beautiful and the rooms are nice, even though, they are a little bit small. The patio outside is great for those summer days outside as it overlooks the brilliant Castleknock Golf Course.

Cons: The rooms are over priced to start. The food in the restaurant does not suit everyone's pallet as that too is over priced. The best way around this is the bar menu but having to wait 25 minutes for an extra potion of chips is a bit annoying. Even better head over to the (Vue) restaurant in Castleknock Golf Course and your guaranteed great food at great prices. The staff seems to change every time I come here and the only one I recognise is the grumpy barman with the face that never seems happy.

All in all it is a good hotel that has something for everyone's taste. Some of the things mentioned would be worth looking at as the hotel is lacking that extra bit for the prices charged. Would I stay here again?? maybe, I would consider going with the family for a bit of grub or a sneaky pint but would have to twist the arm to stay.",3,2015,05,27
223,Wonderful Place to stay,"This was a perfect place to stay for my 2 adult sons and myself. It was away from the bustle of Dublin City itself yet close enough to be very convenient to the city. 

The property is well-maintained, modern, and the grounds are very nice. The rooms are bright and clean, well-appointed - quite nice. 

The true beauty of the place is in its staff - they are very friendly and helpful and extend themselves to be cordial and pleasent.

In our brief stay, we managed to have a wonderful give-and-take relationship with Keith Hennessey who works in the restaurant. He has a terrific presence - bright, humorous and very friendly.  The hotel is very lucky to have such as associate working there. He enhanced our stay greatly with his warmth, humor , and great conversation,

I recommend this place whole-heartedly,",5,2015,05,27
223,Love this hotel,"Love this hotel!
I've stayed a few times with my husband and young kids and it never disappoints. 
Food is delicious. 
Great Pool. 
Spacious, clean rooms. 
Location for us coming from the west is great. Our main reason for staying is a trip to dublin for the zoo and shopping and it's only a short drive to the zoo and blanchardstown shopping centre is a short drive away. 
Highly recommended. ",5,2015,05,26
223,Quiet hotel,We stayed for just over a week.  Very nice hotel but quite a ride to Dublin.  They didn't have a shuttle service so to the city and back was 50 euro round trip.  Would definitely rate higher if they had a shuttle service.,4,2015,05,26
223,Good for midweek break. ,"This hotel well set up for short breaks.  Clean and comfortable but unfortunately there is a problem with outside noise from an extractor fan which seems to be over the kitchen area.  also rooms are quite warm a shame that there is no air conditioning option. 
Good value and nice location.  
Didn't eat dinner here but have done so previously.  Breakfast very busy if possible better to wait till after 9.30! ",3,2015,05,26
223,"Beautiful hotel, but very busy.","I stayed here last Friday night with my partner, we had got a great deal online for newly decorated executive room with late check out (1pm) and voucher for the restaurant. We arrived around 7pm and the hotel was quite busy families and children running around. Check in was quite quick although they needed credit card details as we inquired about room service we had already paid in full online. The room was simply stunning and so new i had trouble pushing the door open as the carpet was so thick. The bed was huge and so comfy a great view of the golf course and lake, (my partner had great fun teaching me all the inns and outs of teeing off and the rules of golf ha ha) we went down to the restaurant and asked could we be seated in the main area as there was a guy playing guitar and a lot of empty sofas but where told they were all reserved so we were seated in the back side part, the two young waiters where very attentive and helpful and chit chatted with us about the marriage equality vote which took place that day and were very professional about not giving an opinion even though i had my YES badge still on, the meal i cannot fault 1 steak 1 fish although a bit of a wait (45mins) was delicious. we than moved out to the front of the hotel where the music was and enjoyed a couple of drinks, my only 1 complaint was and which kind of spoiled the whole night and next morning was the generator/fan directly outside the bedroom window which very loudly buzzed until after 12pm and started back around 6am I am a very light sleeper and even with the windows closed i could still hear it. when i mentioned it on check out and asked had other guests complained i was told not normally by guests on the 2nd floor only guests on the 1st floor and if i had of said it the night before that my room could have been changed, so for future guests just be wary of this as the generator is loud and very annoying. Overall i cant fault the staff or service and the room was to die for, but please do something about that noisy fan.",4,2015,05,26
223,not worth the wait,"My husband, our daughter and myself visited this hotel on Sunday evening for something to eat, not one of my better ideas, it was a waiting game from start to finish. One of the managers took our order, my husband wanted a starter, so he ordered the chicken wings, my daughter and myself didn't want a starter. A half an hour passed and still no wings,, by this time the tables that filled up since we placed our order had got their food. I couldn't see the girl took our order anywhere, so I called over another waitress and explained we were waiting for the chicken wings, she went to the kitchen to check and brought them out a few minutes later, when she collected the plate she said the main courses would be out in a few minutes, another twenty minutes went by and still no food, I called the same waitress over again and then she called over another manager who asked us what we wanted and we told him, I said if the food was not out in a few minutes we would be out the door, another while went BG and another member of staff came out with excuses ( under pressure) Here's a joke to lighten the mood in this review "" how many staff does it take to take your order in the Castleknock hotel?"" Answer none because none can take it properly, anyway back to this serious review, main courses eventually arrived with bits missing of mine and some of it cold. Then low and behold the manager who took our order in the first place was asking around the  tables if everybody's food was alright, I asked her if she forgot to give the kitchen our order as we were only eating our food an hour and a half after it was ordered, she said oh no she put it in,, by this time my face was hotter than my food with anger, she went into the kitchen and came back out with the order slip with lots of grease on it( sounds a wee bit like hells kitchen doesn't it?) She argued it wasn't really an hour and a half but proceeded to ask if we wanted dessert or drinks, but we couldn't wait to get out of there,if took the good out of our evening, she gave us a percentage of the bill the least she could do after that incompetence. We will not be returning and would certainly not recommend this hotel",1,2015,05,25
223,Nice time at Castleknock,"I stayed here for two nights with my sister and her kids.  I was very impressed with the cleanliness of the hotel, the pool and Park restaurant.  We ate in the Park restaurant on the first evening. The level of customer service was outstanding and the food was excellent. The bedroom was a good size and the bathroom was immaculate. Breakfast on both mornings was very good.  There was a wide range of tasty food and drink on offer.  On the second evening we ate in the Fionn Uisce Bar area; it was not as good. This was due to the fact that our order got lost/mixed up?  I had a lengthy wait on my dish. When the food did arrive, it was appetizing.  
The children's play area outside and sun terrace is a great draw for families.  I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone.",4,2015,05,24
223,Beautiful hotel just outside the city,"We booked this hotel last minute during the week of Saint Patrick's Day (everything in the city was booked or overpriced).  We arrived very early in the morning after a red eye from the States and were grateful that the front desk employee was able to help us get into our room early to catch up on sleep.

Although it's a little bit of a trek into the city, we enjoyed the peace and quiet and the staff was very helpful in explaining the best way to get to the city via the public bus.  (Make sure you have exact change for the bus!)  Overall, the hotel was beautiful, clean, and we enjoyed our stay.",5,2015,05,21
223,Good hotel. Stylish.,"Hi
Stayed here just 1 night on business. 
Good location, 2 miles from Blanchardstown. Quiet area. I would definitely stay here again.
Very busy...we got an upgrade to a Suite. This was unexpected and very welcome. The suite on the 2nd floor was huge. All modcons, hair dryer and straighteners, robes, lots of soaps and shampoos. Free wifi too. Huge car park that is barrierd and free.

Ate in the restaurant... Busy. The food was good, reads nicer than it tastes.
Friendly efficient service.
Breakfast is a great affair....pancake station, hot, cold, breads, cereals ...all a great selection. Soy milk available too, which isn't always the case.
Great spot for conferences or even shopping.
Golf course and leisure centre ..that was being well used. 

Good spot!",4,2015,05,20
223,Beautiful hotel,"Stayed here while visiting Dublin for a weekend away.

The first  impression of the hotel is great, the room is clean, has everything you need and very quiet.

It is a little far out from the centre and cost about ¬£20 approx but was much better value then any city centre hotels so still worked out a brill deal.

Breakfast great to start the day and the staff very friendly, although the night manager was a little abrupt when we couldn't get the list to work,!! His attitude stunk. All I'm all though a great hotel",5,2015,05,19
223,"Lovely rooms, awful service","Initial impression of the hotel was great, room was lovely. However, dinner in the newly rebranded L'Avenue restaurant was abysmal. Took an hour for starters to arrive and when they did they were cold. After an hour and a half main courses arrived, our orders were wrong and instead of the staff taking back our food to get our correct order they left the meals down and tried to remedy it by bringing out sides. The chips were frozen chips which weren't nice even though the menu said handcut chips. When I asked for handcut chips they took another 30 minutes to come out, by this time my main course was finished. I saw other tables with the same main course with frozen chips. Very dishonest to write handcut on the menu and serve frozen. Dessert was also missing icecream. The manager and staff were apologetic, however our dinner was ruined and we were very disappointed. All of the waiting staff were lovely, however they appear to have no proper service training and the food was poor.",2,2015,05,18
223,Quick stay,"Hotel room was very good, I had requested room over the golf course but did not get one.   Hotel very lively, staff great, but wifi in the bedroom was non existent. We ate in the Golf Club, the food was great and terrific value",4,2015,05,16
223,Convenient location for Dublin,"20 minutes drive from Dublin Airport and City Centre. Chose this hotel to conduct job interviews because of easy access around Dublin. Stayed two nights.Very comfortable room,clean and spacious.Bath and separate shower in good size bathroom.
Busy hotel with courteous and helpful staff. Open plan bar area with good bar menu. Separate restaurant area with reasonable choice menu. I had a very tasty steak cooked as I like it. Again very good service. Breakfast,good choice of continental of full Irish. Meeting room was comfortable and service was efficient.
Will return and try the golf course,it looked good from my window.",4,2015,05,14
223,Lovely 5 day stay,"What a lovely hotel and the staff couldn't do enough for you. Great selection of meals. We could not find any fault with our entire stay, however much we tried. Would deffantly stay here again and would highly recommend it",5,2015,05,13
223,Very Professional in all Aspects,"The Staff Are So Friendly And Accomadating 
Always a pleasure To Visit This Hotel :) I Have Been 
There Many Times  And Have Always Had A Lovely Experience .
Highly Recommended , Looking Foward To Visiting Again Soon .",5,2015,05,11
223,Such Rude Staff,"Stayed here for two nights on the May bank holiday. Fabulous hotel but thats nothing if you dont have the staff to go with it. We payed over ‚Ç¨300 for B&B so for that kind of money I would not expect to be treated so rudely and on a couple of occasions feeling quite intimidated by some members of staff who obviosly did not want to be there and in turn just stared myself and a guest of mine out of it from behind a pillar. Be brought this up with a manager, he said the members of staff were being handled, but unfortunately either way our experience was completely ruined. Im digusted I payed the money to stay in this hotel, when I think of what else I could have done with it without the grief really upsets me!",1,2015,05,10
223,Disappointing Breakfast,"Having completed the Pieta House Darkness into Light 5km walk it was suggested we go to Castleknock Hotel for breakfast as they open especially for post walk breakfast 

We were a party of three adults two children on arrival we were asked were we voucher or cash paying basis. We were paying by cash just under ‚Ç¨12 per head no receipts given money just put into cash box 

When I pointed out two of the party were children they reduced their charge by ‚Ç¨3 my having seen a manager 

The breakfast was in main function room nicely set out with a good selection all well for fruit juices and cereal

The hot food let it down plates cold just piled high on one table   rashers edible tomatoes covered in pepper scrambled eggs watery.

Only two staff on duty doing teas and coffee. If a table was vacated there was no clear off service customers were moving used dishes onto other uncleared tables in order to have a clean table.

Will be going somewhere else next year",2,2015,05,09
223,Very helpful staff on reception,"We stayed here on Monday 5th May and had a lovely greeting on arrival to the hotel from the receptionist.  We were given a room with connecting door which we did not like so the receptionist  changed our room.  It did take a while for someone to come up to use to give us the key.  When we got to our 2nd room it was at the back of the hotel near a generator and we asked to be changed again as I am a very light sleeper.  This time I went down to reception and because of the delay in the previous key getting to us we got a free upgrade to a superior room 305.   It was lovely and had obviously just got new carpet and been painted.  i would say that the plugs need attention as one set was a bit lose and dangerous.  It was just the tiny details of the room needed finished really.  
The leisure facilities were lovely and very peaceful.
We had dinner down in the bar/restaurant with no wait for a table.  It did take a while for the food which was ok for dinner.  Was a bit disturbed by a man hoovering around us as we ate.
We had a great sleep - forgot to say shower door wouldn't close and took a long time to get hot water but got there in the end.
Breakfast was much better than dinner - really enjoyed the maple waffles! something i've never had before.  Look forward to coming back and making my own pancakes too!

Just the wee details that need addressed but definitely in the top 3 of hotels i have been too but not sure if I would pay full price for a night - liked my cheap deal!",4,2015,05,09
223,Day Spa Trip,"I recently visitied this hotel for the day spa facilities. The SPA relaxation room is lovely and very tranquil with comfortable beds and a great selection of teas, fruit and cold drinks. Myself and my Mam both went for the neck,back and sholder massage and mini facial and we shared a treatment room. The massage and facial were very relaxing, I requested a deep massage and wasn't dissapointed. The only downpoint was that during our treatments the CD was making a scratching/skipping noise at times, although it was still not enough to shop us from feeling tranquil and relaxed. We decided to make use of the sauna/jacuzzi after our treatments. The sauna etc are downstairs and through a different changing room. The pool room was quite  loud with teenagers in the jacuzzi and very bright with ceiling to floor windows, it was quite a contrast to the experience given upstairs in the SPA area. We decided to give the jacuzzi a miss as we felt it might not be the relaxing note to end our day on. Overall we really enjoyed our treatments and chillout time in the SPA area.",3,2015,05,05
223,Never again.. Rude staff ,"I stayed here for 2 nights at a christening and must say the staff ruined the night for us. The manager pulled the plug on the dj at around half 10. The bar man in the residence bar antagonised my father in law to be to which he knew was wrong and came out to apologise to my partner for his behaviour as my partner was the one who had to tell the bar man he was in the wrong the issue had been resolved and he went out of his way to re-engage with my partners father. I Would of loved to book here for my wedding but with that treatment I wouldn't even consider it. The grounds are stunning the rooms the pool, but the customer service which is the face of every hotel and company I must say yours let you'd down big time.. ",2,2015,05,05
223,‚ÄúVERY Rude and pushy staff! ‚Äù,"I have stayed in this Hotel when I return to Ireland from the US where I live at present but I am from Ireland. The last two times I have stayed at Christmas and April this year with family ‚ÄúVERY Rude and pushy staff at breakfast ! ‚ÄùWould not stay here again. For a 4 star hotel I except a lot more. I actually stayed my first weekend down in Cork in Hotel CASTLEMARTYR which is a five star and to come from that hotel to this. Anyway enough said.

223,Fantastic Experience,"Had a wonderful stay at this lovely hotel and country club.  The amenities were great and the staff were fantastic.  I would like to acknowledge a few that really brightened our stay. Indre and Shauna at reception, Andrew who served our cocktails and the young man from the Tonic Spa who was working the desk at 8am on the morning of May 4.  Although his job was the spa he helped me print some important business documents. 
Wonderful experience all around.",5,2015,05,04
223,Vanessa,"Wanted to stay here for a few days so decided to pop up & check out the service & facilities as I live locally. Brought my 3yr old daughter with me & had coffee. I thought the menu was very limited even though this was 11am- I ordered a chocolate cake to share with my daughter as there wasn't much else I could've ordered for a 3yr old, also ordered a smoothie which I'm sure was made from frozen berries- wasn't much cop! The cake came out with the spoon & no napkin again pretty average cake. Anyway I didn't bother checking out any facilities after I saw the notice card on each table stating ""children must be seated at all times""!!! In my opinion this is not a family friendly hotel & I was quite insulted by this notice hence I will never return to this hotel either as a passing customer or a guest nor will I recommend it to anyone I know.",1,2015,05,02
223,beautiful,absolutley my favorite hotel staff are lovely rooms are beautiful food amazing price reasonable lovely hotel,4,2015,05,02
223,Excellent hotel great service would definitely recommend,"Myself and my boyfriend stayed here. I could not rate it highly enough. From the moment we checked in until we checked out the service was impeccable. Very welcoming and friendly. We had a great view from our room. We ate in the Park Restaurant which I must say the quality of food was outstanding. The staff were extremely helpful and explained the menu and seem to really be educated on the food and drink they were serving.
Very broad breakfast menu which suits all.
Will definitely be staying here again
Deserves it's 4 star rating",5,2015,05,02
223,Not as good as we hoped,"We were really looking forward to staying at the hotel as a family of 2 adults and 2 kids. The pool and outdoor play area and modern looking surroundings appealed to us. However a few things let it down. The bar food was not up to scratch. We ordered a spiced beef wrap, but there was no spice very bland. The kids had a burger which was shrivelled quite badly it was pathetic looking. When we retired for the evening we were going to order room service , we were dissapointed the menu was only the bar food which we thought was very limited. So we didn't bother and opted for left over sandwiches from our earlier picnic we had brought with us to the zoo. The bar area was a private party so we had to sit on the hotel lobby which wasn't ideal. Nice hotel and lovely pool which kids loved, but I doubt I will return. ",3,2015,04,29
223,Very nice!,I havet visited Castleknock many times. I see it as one of the better hotels a stay on business travel. Great food. Great gym. The staff is also very nice. It is also good for golfers as they have a course just next to the hotel.,5,2015,04,28
223,Nice facility let down by poor service,"I use this hotel often for business use and was suitably impressed by it that I decided to book a few days for my family (wife & 1 infant). Knowing that the swimming pool was good I thought it would be ideal for our first family break away.

I had pre-booked the stay and specified that we required a cot for our daughter however upon check in there was no sign of the cot. I tried to ring down to reception but the phone in our room didn't work. It wasn't a massive ordeal so I went down to sort at reception. The cot arrived within the hour.

We had dinner pre-booked in the restaurant but were hugely disappointed in the service. Our mains were served but the sides did not accompany them. When we enquired about them we were told they were coming now but as time passed we had to eat the main meal without the sides to make sure the food didn't go any colder! We explained to the server that sides did not arrive but he offered us dessert anyway which we ordered along with tea and coffee. Whilst cups arrived for the tea and coffee, the actual liquids did not along with a pint of Guinness that was ordered 15 minutes prior. At this point our daughter had fallen asleep so we couldn't wait any longer and went on to bed extremely disappointed with our dinner.

We also had problems trying to book a spa treatment for my wife although I don't think that the hotel staff work in the spa.

The room was very basic despite my booking claiming to be a deluxe king room, and had no air conditioning which was frustrating as for a change the weather was nice in Ireland.

The name on our reservation was also spelt incorrectly which was strange as my booking was made by email and I have stayed in the hotel before and my details should have been available. I also previously complained of the poor service during a work stay and therefore expected over and above to make up for it but was let down unfortunately.

Nice hotel with good leisure facilities but poor staff and dated rooms.",2,2015,04,28
223,Nice hotel ,"Stayed here for one night. Check in was efficient, pool area was nice. Room was nice and clean with both bath and separate shower. Plenty of parking spaces. There was a good choice of fruits for breakfast and although it was self service, freshly cooked hot food was regularly being brought out.",4,2015,04,26
223,Very enjoyable stay,"Great facilities, comfortable seating in the foyer area.
Swimming pool was quiet when we were there but unfortunately the jacuzzi was out of order.
Since it was wall to wall sunshine during our stay we were able to sit outside in the patio area overlooking the golf course. This made the holiday for us as it was quiet and relaxing. 
The staff were very friendly and helpful. 
We didn't have a car but found the 37 bus to and from Dublin City centre convenient.
Our room was perfect - quiet and comfortable.
All in all a good experience and would be glad to return.",4,2015,04,26
223,Good conference facilities,"Here for a conference and found the whole experience very satisfactory from the moment we arrived to the moment we left. 
Arriving from a lunch time flight and in need of a bite to eat some sandwiches and a pot of tea very quickly arrived, plenty to go round and freshly made.
Conference facilities are good with sufficient rooms for our needs, and I suspect most with access to get vehicles inside.
Meals were OK although breakfast is a buffet and as a preference I do prefer to be pampered at that time of the day, it does speed things up so is, perhaps, understandable.
All round a good venue that served our needs well.",4,2015,04,24
223,ladies weekend away with pampering,"Just recently 5 of us took our annual weekend away to castlenock and from the moment we arrived it was fantastic. The staff, the food, the rooms and spa were super and we all enjoed it very much xxxx",4,2015,04,23
223,Wedding,"At a family wedding .  Stayed that night. Check in efficient. Room nice, had been refurbished.  New carpet.  Incredible hulk needed to open the door as carpet very thick.  In an emergency this would obviously be a major issue.  Staff are very over worked but remain pleasant,  breakfast good but no need for explanation by the guy , we've all had breakfast before? Generally a good experience if a bit haphazard. ",3,2015,04,20
223,Great staff and great breakfast. ,"This hotel is in lovely location. Great service ethos.....from welcome at reception to bar staff and restaurant staff. Particular mention for Elizabeth who served us our evening meal...skilled and professional service, ensuring everyone's needs met. Breakfast was one of the best we have had...excellent selection.

Only down point was that having booked what the website listed as a triple room we were disappointed to find we had been allocated a twin room with an extra bed put in. This left the accommodation cramped. 

However...Our overall impression of hotel was so good that we will be returning. Hopefully issue with triple room can be ironed out prior to next stay.",4,2015,04,19
223,Bad Food & Worse Attitude,"We had a Sunday family lunch here in February 2015. Our group was 3 adults, 1 teen & 2 young children. We opted for the carvery, in the main dining area. Big mistake. This was to be a birthday celebration meal for one of the younger ones. The first thing that struck me was that the dining room was half empty and none of the tables were set. The lights were turned off & the place was in semi-darkness. Food was ordered separately for the little ones & we went to the carvery in turns, two by two. There was a choice of three mains and before we could order, the chef put down her tea towel & walked away, through the double doors that led to the kitchen. No comments, no greeting, no smile, just walked off. We stood waiting, and after five to six minutes, another chef walked out. At this stage a queue had built up. So then he left without comment & returned a few minutes later with another chef, and they served lunch between them. The choice was disappointing & certainly not enticing. There was some ham floating (more like drowning) in a sea of cheesy looking sauce, there was chicken legs floating in oil with black olives and there was beef on the carvery. I went for the beef, as it looked like the safest option. I got the last serving of the beef, my plate was then passed between the two chefs, with bare hands, no serviette, no towel, just two sets of hands on my plate. I asked for some veg & potatoes & then went to the table.We had to go twice for plates & cutlery to an area off the dining room, self service had a new meaning.  There was absolutely no staff, apart from the two at the carvery. I got up to get glasses of water. There was no water on the side table, ice and two empty jugs.  I had walked completely out of the dining area & half way past the bar, before I found two staff who appeared to be patrolling the area. I asked politely for someone to help with bringing water. This was done & the same person disappeared again into a back room. We waited almost another ten minutes at the table, for this same girl to reappear, to request the kids meals for the two youngest. Sausages & chips arrived as sausages on a bed of mash (not ordered) and the chips in a separate metal container. The chips, on closer inspection, were already covered in enough salt to float a ship - not a good idea for young children. The meal passed reasonably uneventfully, except for a family sitting behind us, whose two kids insisted on sending large plastic trucks flying across the floor, all through our meal. We stood up to retrieve our desserts, there were three choices and I went for a black forest. There was another long wait, until we found someone we could ask for teas or coffees. We paid the bill, over ‚Ç¨100. and left. Later that evening I became unbelievably ill, with food poisoning. I was sick for the whole following week & had the food poisoning verified by my doctor. When I was well enough, I phoned the hotel a week later. The receptionist was far more interested in questioning me than in putting me through to a manager to speak with. I was then passed to the Assistant Bar Manager. A very pleasant guy & said he would look into my complaint. Two weeks and two phone calls later, I was asked if we would like to come back for another meal ?  To which I replied I would have to think about it for a few days. Two months have now passed and I have had no further communication from this hotel. When there is a Head Chef, an Executive Chef and a Manager, but no one to deal with a food complaint, it does not inspire confidence in an establishment. There are too few staff in the dining room & what was a lovely area in the past years now looks sad, dark & uncared for. Certainly not up to the standard of a four star hotel, food wise. A most disappointing and sickening experience and a birthday meal ruined.",1,2015,04,19
223,Easter break at Castleknock,"My wife, daughter and I stayed here for 2 nights in April during Easter. Hotel was fully booked so unfortunately had to wait until 3pm before getting our room, normally we like to chance our arms and check-in a little earlier but can't complain as hotel policy is check-in at 3pm. The hotel itself is immaculate, we used all the facilities available to us, swimming pool, outside area, bar & restaurant and were really impressed with all. Wi-fi was good and accessible all throughout the hotel. Breakfasts were amazing and our daughter really enjoyed the pancakes which she made herself (from the machine!) Location wise it was perfect for us exploring Dublin city centre. We drove to Phoenix park (took around 10 minutes) and parked the car there and got the hop-on hop-off tour bus into the centre. The bar had a nice selection of irish craft beers. Food and drink was reasonably priced. Would thoroughly recommend and will definitely return (next time with the golf clubs)
I see a few reviews recently about the hotel being noisy and full of kids. Well I agree there were a lot of kids when we were there at Easter but then it was school holidays and so was to be expected.",5,2015,04,17
223,most relaxing break,this was our second 2 night stay at Castleknock Hotel 27th -29th March and we know why we revisited. The receptionist Shauna was so pleasant and efficient at check-in and we were located in a beautiful room overlooking the golf course. Although a wedding was taking place on both days of our visit the service by staff was fantastic. We had a beautiful meal in the restaurant on the saturday evening complete with singing waitress with my dessert as it was my birthday-- lovely touch. Elizabeth the young waitress is a gem so hold on to her!!. We will be back for our 1st wedding anniversary in July.,5,2015,04,17
223,Nice hotel but not great,"Our room was lovely, big bed and nice decor but we asked for a twin room and got a double and we were not provided with the robes the hotel had stated on their website. The pool area is small and there were swimming lessons on during our trip which totally ruined the relaxing vibe we had hoped for. Dinner wasn't great either. The starters were not crowd pleaders and what we ended up choosing was inedible. The mains and deserts were nice. Breakfast was ok. Overall, the hotel is nice and the staff are lovely but the food is poor and the swimming pool is full of noisy children.",3,2015,04,15
223,Total Relaxation,"Great place to stay.  Staff are very helpful, rooms and facilities are kept really well.  The bar food wasn't great but that could be due to the fact I am vegan and the summer veg salad organic veggies weren't delivered in time. (very kind of someone to come from the kitchen and explain).  It was a two night romantic getaway for us and we hadn't intended on spending our evenings at the hotel but ended up staying. This is a perfect hotel for both couples and families and we will be back with little ones in tow on our next break.  Bus stop is a five minute walk from the hotel and runs on the half hour into Dublin city centre for 3.30.",5,2015,04,13
223,A top Hotel in a great location,"We returned to Castleknock over the Easter Week. The Hotel was buzzing, packed with Families and various Conferences. The measure of this Hotel and its Staff is that we, two Couples, were not lost in this Throng. We were well looked after. We were given recently re-decorated rooms, which are in great condition. We ate both nights in the Bar. The food was excellent and reasonably priced. The foyer area is number one, after the Westbury's piano lounge, for people watching.",5,2015,04,13
223,Good everytime we stay,"Recently stayed overnight on way to Cork. Was great as usual. Stay here when in Dublin. 10 minutes in car from Dublin City.    Food was great. Loved the chicken caesar salad. The swimming pool was great for me and my child, although they have a maximum occupancy, so go early in the morning if you dont want to wait. 

Great hotel, rooms clean,  facilities great and decor new and modern. 
",4,2015,04,11
223,Great Dublin Stop Over,"This was our third time staying here, its a great stop over hotel when travelling in or out of Dublin.   Rooms are well appointed and spacious.   Dealing with the reservations office by email or phone is alway a pleasure.   We've always been given what we asked for and rates seem negtioable.   As the hotel is a few mins drive from the nearest shops we always eat in the bar, the food is good, drinks a tad on the expensive side but what you would expect from a hotel.  The kids love the pool too and they always make the most of swimming while we are there.    Breakfast can be a bit chaotic, the buffet style layout works pretty well and is frequently restocked with fresh food.  The pancake machine was a big hit with the kids !   Overall I'd recommend this hotel as a great stop over or as a base for Dublin.   We're not golfers so can't comment on the golfing there.   I would recommed to check to see if there is a wedding on when you stay.  We've been there when there was a wedding and was woken up by rowdy guests and kids running around.   That said, if you ask for quite end of corridor rooms away from the function area you should be ok.   Definately a good place to stay and staff have always been 1st class.",5,2015,04,11
223,Number one hotel in ireland without a doubt,"Staying in castleknock hotel at present with husband & my two daughters, we visit this hotel two to three times per year and it gets better each time. From the moment you walk in the front door until you leave you are really looked after, from the food, staff, bedrooms,open plan space, childrens play areas, housekeeping staff all are first class.  I visit many hotels throughout ireland and I have to admit this hotel is ahead of the rest. Well done castleknock hotel, you never disappoint.",5,2015,04,09
223,Great night away for girls,"Great food in a comfortable setting in the restaurant. breakfast was served here too which had a great selection of hot and cold foods. Cocktails at the bar were good , staff friendly and seating comfortable with a nice piano player in the lobby area. . clean room . Hotel pool was clean and nice too .",4,2015,04,08
223,Dublin beckons - and the west is less than 2 hours away!,"A third visit for us to Castleknock.  It was somewhere we happily recommended to friends for a first stay in Ireland.  

We all met up there for a weekend in September.  The weather was fantastic and we took advantage of the proximity to Phoenix Park in doing the obligatory tour of Dublin city.

Rooms at Castleknock are spacious and have the expected amenities.  Our teenage sons had an interconnecting room, which gave as much contact and independence as needed.

The bar, with its comfy seating and large screen TVs, was a good place to relax and enjoy a drink.  The set menu in the restaurant lacked variety but was tasty and service was good.

Spa treatments are a must for us on short breaks and the in-house treatments were professionally done by friendly and competent staff.

The boys spent some time in the gym also.  Whilst it is small, the place makes good use of space and there were enough different machines/weights to offer a decent work out.

All in all, a place we are happy to return to again and again.",4,2015,04,06

223,Absolutely amazing,"I have stayed here on two different occasions. It was the first hotel I stayed in on my first arrival to Ireland and it was just brilliant. Beautiful, clean, modern, and just an amazing environment overall. I couldn't recommend this place more and have yet to see a hotel in Dublin like it!",5,2015,03,19
223,Very satisfied customer,"What can I say only excellent ! Food, hospitality !! Facilities... Privacy.... Highly recommend it the spa was a treat, the therapists were so professional.. Enjoyed a fantastic swim in the pool... Followed by good chat and great atmosphere",5,2015,03,19
223,stunning and worth the money,"Stunning scenery, classy and elegant interior, attentive staff and overall high standards. 
The rooms are spacious with comfy beds and ensuite bathrooms. The Park restaurant in the hotel is a wonderful fine-dining experience. The hotel is only a few minutes drive away from Blanchardstown Centre and other amenities. It has a pool, gameroom and small playground. The only complaint I have is the speed of service in the restaurant was a bit slow and they brought the mains out in dribs and drabs and left the accompaniments a while after the main was brought out however this would not put me off as the food was incredible and the staff were pleasant.",4,2015,03,17
223,Disappointing..,We stayed here for just one night. Whilst the hotel itself is lovely and we had a very spacious room which was very comfortable everything else was so disappointing. The pool was lovely too although the ladies changing room is very cramped. We had food in the bar and it was not good..a burger that was very dry and kids gougons that seemed very processed. Service in the hotel was abysmal.. Everyone from reception to bar to breakfast to managing staff seemed totally disengaged. They have no idea how to treat customers. Whilst the hotel itself might be 4 star the food and service are 2 star.,2,2015,03,16
223,Incredible!,"Wow, all I can say. This hotel definitely deserves it's four star status. I stayed there a few years ago for a few nights and I loved it. As soon as you go through the gates, you are amazed by the massive hotel towering above you. As soon as we walked through the door, we were awestruck at the sheer beauty of the interior. The staff were friendly as can be, were always smiling, the rooms were lovely (Although I would suggest bringing your own hair-dryer, as with many hotels, they don't work very well) the showers were lovely and warm, the beds were super comfy, and it was a pleasure to sleep there. Sadly, it was freakishly warm, and the ice machines in the halls were out of order. The lobby area was great, the lounge was lovely, there was really nice music and really comfy seating. The outside play area for kids was great too :D The breakfast was delightful, and as I said before, this place definitley deserves its' four star rating! Would definitely advise this place to anyone visiting Ireland, or just looking for a few nights of luxury!",4,2015,03,15
223,Wedding wk end,We attended this hotel part of a wedding our reception was in the anglers rest.stayed for 2 nites. Staff food is lovely.Our room was lovely and spacious bathroom to die for walk in shower room.we got breakie up to our room which the girl delivered it on our table she was a very friendly person.one fault of the room the tv is too small and the signal kept freezing.we had a meal the sat nite in the golf club.it was delicious.every one was amazed with the food.def will be back for a wk end and try out the pool etc.looks lovely.,4,2015,03,15
223,Afternoon Tea,"Visited the Castleknock hotel for Afternoon tea for 5 people recently. We choose it as it was significantly less than the prices charged in the city centre. Unfortunately I think it's a case of ""you get what you pay for."" The thing that disappointed me the most was that Afternoon Tea was held in an empty restaurant with no atmosphere or character and I found it quite a formal setting rather than relaxed. We had it booked for 5 people however only 4 afternoon tea's were served to us and we had to order a 5th which we then had to wait for. The food itself was fine, your standard egg/smoked salmon sandwiches but nothing special. It was ""nice"" and ""fine"" but certainly didn't blow me away.",3,2015,03,10
223,An excellent weekend experience,"Just returned yesterday from a package deal weekend and could not fault this hotel.  Staff friendly and helpful, and really well-trained and efficient in the dining room (we were seated in the Park Restaurant instead of the Brasserie)  The second night, . because I wasn't having a starter and my husband was, a free small bowl of soup was brought to me, a real surprise.  Meals excellent and the breakfast exceptional with an amazing variety of food, even fresh health drinks available.  Our sunny bedroom overlooked one of the golf greens and the lake.  As I was attending a workshop in the hotel I didn't use the additional facilities such as swimming pool etc. but everyone else seemed to be enjoying them.  Our room was so well heated we had to turn the radiator off.  Bathroom had underfloor heating and a walk in shower.     I would highly recommend this hotel and hope to return.",5,2015,03,09
223,Best welcome I've received in a long time!,"Most definitely one of the nicest hotels I've stayed in for quite some time. On arrival I was greeted by a most helpful reception staff member, when I arrived into my room there was a complimentary bottle of white wine, very nice touch! Given that I don't drink white I asked if it could be changed to red, within 5 minutes there was a staff member at my room door with the replacement. Ate in the bar which was perfect, very spacious yet a warm feeling. Breakfast was was you could only expect from a professional outfit like this hotel. Will definitely be bringing our business back to this hotel. ",5,2015,03,08
223,Comfortable Stay.,"Overall happy with stay.
Very well presented breakfast with excellent choice.
Would stay again.
Very well placed hotel with great shopping a short journey away.
Phoenix park is close by as well a pub/food if hotel does not suit.",4,2015,03,06
223,Midweek 2 night break,"If you want excellent service, food and room then book a stay at this hotel. Very friendly staff and great food. Plenty of relaxation options (upper back and shoulders hot stone massage highly recommended) wiil be going back soon.",5,2015,03,05
223,Awful,"never again!! have to totally agree with the two last reviews ,stayed in this hotel on the 20th feb ,it was a special occasion for myself and husband .We had the deal for 1 night stay dinner and breakfast to which was 188 euro for two . Booked it on their website  never once did it say you would have to pay extra for sides on their web site ( never heard of any hotel asking you to pay for sides after paying for a deal on their website ) and the menu was not too good at all .""No chicken tonight "" the waitress told us only guinea foul  ""ugh no thank you !! Not a lover of fish ,so we were stuck to order steak (extra 6 euro each ,ok I know you pay a supplement on steak at times .we'll let that go ) but felt pressured to taking the steak cause options were not good on the menu ,so that was twelve euro extra for two plus  7 euro  for two chips ,so the deal I thought I was getting add another sneaky 19 euro on ,ended up with a rude manager arguing the point with me about it when we question him on it ,reluctantly he took it off the bill only because I said I was not wasting my anniversary arguing with him .Now don't get me started on the breakfast , all I'll say is awful and please whatever you do if there are no eggs left ,don't disturb the waitress there ,they're not there to help at all, soooo rude . ah well you live and learn .Think next anniversary sit in with take out and a bottle of wine üòâ",1,2015,03,04
223,Big let down - standards are slipping,"Stayed in hotel, friday 27th March. On the 79pps rate. Very disappointed in the way the hotel has become since my last stay.
The adults bar was rammed with kids and the other bar was very sparse of tables and chair which were stained. The restaurant menu was below par for the restaurant which we had eaten in many times before. And we couldn't order off the menu and pay the difference. Seems the staff just couldn't be bothered. Disappointed with the 4 course dinner offered with our stay. So we decide to have breakfast the following morning in our room at 9am . So at 10 am  after we called the hotel from my mobile, since the room phone wasnt working. To be told 8 people had booked breakfast to their  rooms and ours was bad luck that it was last. So 10.30 breakfast arrived and the staff member handed us the tray charge which in fairness we would have had no problem paying if we had not waited over an hr and half for food.  So we politey said to staff member we would sort it with reception. And thanked her. 
Breakfast was cold and had been the food had most defintely been reheated and cooled. Another disappointment. 
Then a knock on our door at 10.45. Went to see who it was and it was a phone engineer guy to fix our phone in the room whilst we ate. So I started to see red at this point. Ask him would he mind until we left which was about 10 mins after. Surely in a professional hospitality industry that could have been done between 12-3pm?
So it was a major letdown. And normally would have recommended to.friends and family but sad to say its lost all its appeal.
",2,2015,03,02
223,Nice hotel but everything else is terrible,"I have rated this hotel as poor as it should really be a lot better for what it is. The setting is very nice, Hotel is presented well and restaurant is nice. Staff also nice but left just feeling ripped off if I'm completely honest. 

To the management - I would recommend specifying at the time of booking, that if you book one of the deals you are offering that you can only avail of a sub par menu.

First time staying here and would not return.
Myself and my wife decided to go for a meal after some good news and a busy few weeks. The hotel were running a deal for 69pp which included breakfast and a 3 course meal. So we booked this instead of just going for meal. We dropped our 2 boys off at their grandparents and we made our way to the hotel. Check in was smooth and staff were friendly etc. Got to the room and it was nice and clean. Standard hotel room. We went to the bar then to begin unwinding before dinner. My wife spotted a bar with the notice ""No children allowed"". Great we could have a nice quiet drink in there we thought. We we sitting all of about 5 seconds when the bar became a playground for no less than about 5 young kids who proceeded to thrash the place. Dont get me wrong - they are kids and were having great fun by the looks of things but they should not have been allowed in this bar. A staff member walked in, removed a sign they were thrashing, walked out and that was it.... So we left the ""No kid zone"" bar and went back out to the normal bar (Which had less kids in it???). We finished our drinks and got ourselves ready for Dinner. 

When we arrived at the restaurant we found out that we had a totally different menu than normal customers. This really bugged me as the choices on the menu were extremely limited. Menu resembled more of a steak house than a restaurant, if that makes sense? I settled on the pork belly which was very nice and cooked very well. My wife had the Sea bass. I will not try to rate this as I am not a fish eater and it would not be fair. She said it was nice though. Serving sizes were also perfect. The only desert that I wanted was not available so settled for a chocolate cake. 

Breakfast - This was possibly the worst experience of the stay. 
We booked the breakfast to be delivered to the room for 9am. 9:30 came and there was still no breakfast. I tried to call down to reception then realized the phone in the room was not working so had to use my mobile to call reception. I explained that the phone in the room was not working and that i needed to make this call on my phone - I was then transferred to the restaurant where I was told ""We had 8 orders for the same time of 9am this morning and your breakfast is on the tray to be delivered next"". I should think a hotel of this size could deal with more than 8 orders for the same time. The girl who delivered the breakfast which eventually came close to 10am was clearly extremely busy and had by the look of her been running all over the hotel. We wanted to get out and back to our kids as early as possible. Waiting an hour for breakfast to be delivered to our room wrecked those plans.

When the breakfast was delivered the girl asked for the ‚Ç¨6 per tray room service charge. I requested that this be put on the room and we can pay when we leave as neither of us had any actual cash on us. This apparently was a problem and could not be done. After maybe 15 to 20 seconds of awkward silence I asked what should we do now and if she would like to take the trays back. She eventually said it was fine.

When we we actually sat down to eat the breakfast we found it was pretty much inedible. I ordered Poached eggs with my full Irish breakfast. They may as well have been hard boiled eggs. They were extremely over cooked and cold. My wife had scrambled eggs which she could not eat as they were cold and very sloppy/wet. The entire breakfast was freezing cold and really was not worth waiting for.

We had just given up on breakfast when there was a knock on the door - It was a guy here here to do maintenance on the phone. We were still in the hotel room, Should have been still eating the breakfast that was delivered an hour late. Surely this should have been done in between the 12pm checkout time and the 3pm check in time?

Im afraid I would not stay here again I generally make a point of not staying in anything less than four star hotels. The odd time where i have absolutely had to - I have had a better experience. 

Avoid. Avoid. Avoid.",1,2015,03,02
223,Nice setting,"An impressive hotel set on nice grounds just beside the golf club. Decorated to a high standard, nice bedrooms. The food is the disappointing part of the hotel, breakfast is fine, but room for improvements on the rest of the menu. The bar is ok, but service slow",4,2015,03,01
223,Would NOT recommend this hotel for families,"We live in the North of Ireland and decided to take a half term break to Dublin, to visit the zoo and take the kids to Dublin for the first time.  I carried out some research (on TA of course!)  on various hotels in Dublin, both city-centre based and on the outskirts, and we went for Castleknock mainly due to the fact that it has a pool, whereas many city centre hotels don't, plus we liked that it is located close to the zoo.  The hotel was offering a 2 night package including breakfast and one 3 course dinner (the dinner was included just for the adults, the children were extra) for 260 euro (this is for a 'Family Room' which we thought was a pretty good deal for all 4 of us.  
Having already read the reviews on this hotel I knew that it was not located within easy access to the city centre, so the location did not bother us.  Basically the hotel is located beside Carpenterstown, and there is very little of significance nearby apart from the zoo.  It's a suburban area with not much to do for families really, so be warned that you do need to travel by car to get anywhere fun from the hotel!  One good restaurant nearby that I highly recommend is the Italian restaurant 'Maximilians' in Carpenterstown - which I left a review for also.  We went there for dinner on our first night's stay and loved it.  (Way better than the food in the hotel in our opinion.) 
On arriving to the hotel, the kids were excited, as it appears huge at first, however we soon realised this is because it is open-plan in design.  The main hotel bar is in the hotel lobby which makes it noisy and it was always full of business people.  It became obvious to us during our stay that Castleknock is really a business hotel, trying their hardest to tempt families as the few families in the hotel like us, were like 'outsiders' in this business-focused place.  The hotel is trying to appeal to families with new 2 night deals in a  'Family Room' which we soon realised is a standard, very bland and small room with a sofa pulled out to make a (very lumpy, small) bed!  
We were pleased to hear from reception that a function room was set aside for the children to play in. We had a look and indeed, there was a disney film on the projector, a small snooker table, table football, colouring books and a wii.  This is not supervised so parents have to stay with the kids in the room and my kids felt a bit old in there (age 8 and 6) but it's a great idea and certainly the main highlight of the hotel services offered to families - I'm giving a star just for that.
So the facilities are quite good - there is a decent sized pool which we went to as soon as we arrived.  However the pool is so highly chlorinated that we all had really itchy skin and sore, stingy eyes after leaving the pool right through to the next day and it really put us off going back to the pool the next day.  We have not had any allergic reactions before, so this was quite annoying for us - the fact that we all felt sore and itchy meant that it must be really bad!  There is a spa and I tried booking appointments both days but they were fully booked - they told me they would phone me if there was a cancellation but no joy - so disapppointed.
I mentioned the main bar in the lobby area, which serves drinks and small meals - it is very expensive - we didn't eat there as the food didn't tempt us and we didn't like the idea of sitting in the hotel lobby with people running past every few seconds while eating our lunch!  We used this area on the 2nd day to play some board games together and had a few drinks, but even the drinks were around 10 euros each which we thought was excessive and they arrived in dirty glasses.
The Lime Tree bar, which is more private is adults only so we didn't go there.
The Brasserie restaurant is where breakfast is served just past the main bar in the lobby and which is a bit bland really.  I'll talk about breakfast shortly!  The Park Restaurant is the 'posh one'!  It does look gorgeous inside as it's just been refurbished and we ate there for dinner on our 2nd night as we had 3 course dinner included.  So, onto the food :-
On our first morning it was quite quiet, as we were at the Brasserie at 9am (in good time to go to the zoo for opening at 9.30am) so there was plenty of food available.  Basically it's all buffet style.  The continental choices are great, although everything tasted dry and bland,  The fresh fruit (melon slices, strawberries) was the nicest part.  The smoked salmon and kippers tasted awful, (and I love my fish) the breads were all dry, the homemade granola sounded & looked gorgeous, but tasted awful.  The hot food wasn't hot, only luke warm, the sausages were horrible, the bacon was ok, but basically breakfast has to be fresh and hot to taste good - this buffet style just doesn't work for hot breakfasts in my opinion.  On the second morning breakfast was a horrendous experience!  We went down to the Brasserie at 9.30am and there were no eggs, no fresh fruit, no wheaten bread, no bacon and the queue was horrendous!  Not a pleasant dining experience at all - we had to go out for breakfast in the end.
Dinner at The Park - as part of our package we had a 3 course dinner included for 2 adults - we knew the kids were extra. The kids meals were 10 euros each, the cheapest bottle of wine was 26 euros a bottle and there are no side orders provided with the main courses which around 8 euros each, such as veg, or chips or potatoes.  Steak is a 6 euro supplement.  We only ordered one side, a bottle of wine and 2 kids meals and it was 60 euros.  Now I don't mind spending a bit of money on a good quality meal but the food was very average.  I ordered the seabass and it was tiny (I don't have a huge appetite but even I was still hungry after it!)  The menu for our set meal was listed separately to the main restaurant menu so obviously it's smaller, differently sized portions than the paying customers get!  The wine was like vinegar - could have got it for ¬£5 from Tescos!  The kids burgers were dry and burnt.  Walked out feeling very disappointed overall.  So onto the rooms.....
When we first arrived to our room we  asked to be moved as we were looking out onto a very noisy and ugly air conditioning unit.  I asked if there were any rooms with a view of the golf course, at the back of the hotel, and was told these were all being refurbished and none were available.  This is strange as I saw various guests coming and going from the rooms at the back of the hotel - I think those rooms are not included in the Family package (business only.)
Anyway they moved us down the corridor to a room overlooking the car park - a bit better.  The rooms are very tight as the sofa is pulled down to create a bed in front of the window and then there is literally just enough walking space between the beds and the bathroom.  The pull out bed was not big enough for the 2 kids despite being told it was a double size - it is a tiny 2 seater sofa pull out bed and there was a huge hump in the middle so they keep falling into each other when they lay on it.  One of them ended up sleeping in the adult bed with us - very romantic!  The pillows were lumpy and the main bed was hard as a rock.  The room itself was roasting hot at night but it was too windy to open the window.  There was no hot water in the bath but actually, when we phoned about it, someone came up right away and got the tap to turn, so hot water came on, so it was fixed really efficiently.  The body/hair shampoo supplied is awful stuff and the shower is tiny - small gripes but overall, the rooms are not 4 star standard, I would say 3 star at best!  The TV is tiny (a computer monitor size).  The tea and coffee cups smelt of bleach - yuck!  We were dying to get home to have a decent night's sleep after staying in those rooms.  
Overall, I can see that Castleknock is trying hard to appeal to the family market, however the basics have to be right and a hard bed and a cold breakfast just won't do it!

This sofa bed is supposed to fit 2 children!",3,2015,02,23
223,Very good stay - would recommend,"Our first time staying at the Castlenock hotel and will certainly use again.

We requested and were given a quiet room, second floor well away from any function room(s) and sleep quality was excellent - large clean room with comfortable bed and pleasant views out across the golf course.

Pleasant atmosphere in public areas, always plenty of people around and staff friendly and helpful.

Good location for public transport into the city and lots of parking.",4,2015,02,22
223,Worst hotel ever!!,"stayed here in February, room temperature was cold and the central heating didn't work well, had to get an electrical heater. While out for dinner, someone came into the room and took the heater away and left a fan?? Complained to the manager and the answer was there had been a mix up?? Free wifi hardly works in the evenings and the TV in the room has not many channels that work. Regret booking this hotel looking at the photos from the website!",1,2015,02,17
223,Very enjoyable stay,"We had been bought a 2 night stay in the hotel as part of a Christmas present.  On arrival the hotel building does not have a wow factor.  Check in was very friendly and efficient but when we got to our room on the first floor we were overlooking a rather noisy air conditioning unit.

However, despite not brilliant first impressions our stay only improved.  All the staff we encountered were extremely helpful and friendly.  When we asked to change rooms to a quieter area we were moved straightaway.  

We had dinner in the park restaurant and honestly it was one of the nicest meals we have had.  I had the seabass and it was cooked to perfection and so flavoursome.  On the second night we had bar snacks in the lobby area and again, the food was of a very high standard.  Breakfast on each morning was very good with more than adequate choice.  However, I did miss some soda and potato bread.

The spa was excellent, the staff could not have been any nicer and our treatments were of a high standard.  The therapist asked me numerous times was I comfortable, and was the temperature of the room ok, and she really catered the treatments I had to my needs.

In summary, I would say that the hotel is an excellent place to visit, and while it does not wow on first impression, throughout the course of our stay we grew to love it thanks to the wonderful staff, fabulous food and relaxing ambience.",5,2015,02,16
223,Nice hotel with good public transport links,Stayed here during the six nations game. reception staff are local and gave us good directions to the nearest train station which is only 5 mins walk. Great food and you have a good selection for breakfadt. Room ate clean and beds are comfortable. The only downside was the hotel have flood lights outside  to illuminate the building which makes the room very bright when your training to get some sleep.,4,2015,02,15
223,Work stay,"I stayed in the hotel for work in January. The hotel was spotless and the room very spacious and comfortable. The stay was mid week and the hotel was quiet. The breakfast buffet was very good, great selection of fresh fruits. The gym was nice if a little small. The only dissapointing thing was the cancellation of the 6:30 am spin class that morning due to a staff shortage, not great as January would be a very popular month for fitness and this was one of the main reasons i selected this hotel. On the whole a very good experience and i would highly reccommend.",5,2015,02,01
223,Good location for weddings!,"We have stayed here a number of times, but more recently stayed somewhere else, nearer to family location as this is a little out of the way.  It is worth it though to visit, food is good an rooms are comfy. Lovely place for weddings and we have seen  a few when staying.  That is something to be mindful of when staying as corridors can be noisy if a wedding taking place, but it is a nice hotel in a cute location.  Not too far for the airport and train station quite close by (Clonsilla)",4,2015,01,28
223,"Hotel location great, friendly service","Stayed at the hotel recently for a 2 day business meeting. It was my second time there, and I will definitely be back. It is in a great location, easy access from everywhere. The staff in reception, bars, restaurants etc, all very friendly and helpful. Obviously a good management team in place here. Meeting rooms are really good. I had used the thinking factory last year which is really impressive. This year just booked the regular meeting rooms, but they were high standard. 
Food in general was quite good quality. Lunch and dinner great, breakfast could do better.
Bedrooms were comfortable if a little on the warm side.
Overall, a nice stay, good staff, and will be back.",5,2015,01,24
223,Good value but isolated,"You will be disappointed if you think you are going to stay in a quaint country hotel.  This is the world of brash architecture, weddings, business conferences, long corridors and office parties.  The hotel is situated in country surroundings at the edge of expensive executive houses just west of Phoenix Park.  It is quite difficult to find, even with satellite navigation mainly due to the complex road structure of the M50,  but there is plenty of parking.  It is about 30 minutes from the airport by car.  It is not really convenient for the city centre so you need to think about transport.   Internally it is rather stereotyped with not a lot of charm although all facilities are there with plenty of space.  Check-in and check-out was quick but I was well out of busy hours. The hotel seems to be well run and efficient but what is lacking is a bit of empathy and friendliness to guests although all the staff were polite.  My room was large, clean and pleasant but the television did not work well with poor reception.  The bed was massive and comfortable with no noise from the outside. Bathroom was well furnished with a separate shower.  I was surprised to find a tray with the remnants of the previous occupant's breakfast outside the door (I checked in at about 7.00pm).  There was another similar tray in the corridor.  This needs to be addressed.  A full Irish breakfast was included with all the usual treats including pancakes.  It was a rather lack lustre meal with none of the food being particularly memorable but you will certainly easily fill yourself up for the day.  I had dinner in the Park Restaurant and was disappointed by the ambiance for what should be high class dining.  The service was prompt and efficient but the room uninterestingly square-like in shape with no character.  It would not be the place for a romantic meal or a destination restaurant and I suspect most of the diners were hotel guests.  It could easily be improved by breaking up the monotony of tables with foliage or screens.  The amuse-bouche  of prawn in chilli sauce was excellent as was the starter of mushroom ravioli.  Both beautifully presented in appropriate quantities with a selection of savoury breads.  The main course of fillet mignon was slightly disappointing particularly as it was the most expensive item on the menu (approximately ‚Ç¨28).  The quality of the meat was not in doubt but it was slightly overcooked and far too salty.  The chunky chips and rocket salad were standard fare without any wow factor.  Castleknock Hotel and Country Club is a good base for exploring the surrounds of Dublin but if you want to be in the city centre every evening then it may not be the place for you.  They do have good deals at the moment and I paid ¬£105 for the room, dinner and breakfast but it was mid-week in January,  However I think it represents very good value right now.",4,2015,01,23
223,Christmas party ,Had my Christmas party here in 2014. The hotel is top notch and the staff are so professional and couldn't do more for us. The rooms are big and very clean. Amazing hotel and the attention  to detail was  flawless,5,2015,01,21
223,Lovely short break.,I was bought here for a quick getaway for my birthday. We arrived early and we were given our room to check in a few hours earlier. The room was clean and tidy. The back of the hotel doesn't have the best view but was still a nice room. Reception always phoned taxis and had them there when we came downstairs. Taxis were ‚Ç¨20 each way so quite expensive and no public transport was advertised. We did however have a lovely time in the city and Kilmainham. We had a carvery on the Sunday and used the spa facilities. Lovely warm pool and jacuzzi and the sauna and steam room were veey relaxing. Staff were very helpful and even let me borrow a coin for the lockers. Shame you have to wear a hat in the pool as I have very long hair that won't fit in one! Overall we had a lovely weekend and the staff were very helpful and always smiley. Definatly recommend.,5,2015,01,19
223,Great value and very relaxing!,"I stayed here in September 2014 with a friend and thoroughly enjoyed it. We got the brilliant ‚Ç¨69 per person midweek deal which included bed and breakfast, four course evening meal, complimentary drink and 15% off spa treatments. The room was spacious and comfortable. The meal was amazing, very posh as we were just college friends meeting up but it wasn't a problem. The cocktails were yummy also. We both decided to avail of the leisure facilities, the sauna and jacuzzi were lovely. I got a hot stone back massage and it was so relaxing. I will definitely be back for another relaxing getaway.",5,2015,01,17
223,Outstanding,"

I have just come home from an overnight stay in the Castleknock hotel with my two friends and felt I have to compliment the hotel for its amazing service.

From the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty. We also got treatments in Tonic and the therapists were amazing, so professional and friendly. Our meal later in the evening was beautiful, and the staff in the restaurant were so attentive and friendly.

Overall, we had an amazing stay and will definitely go back and recommending the hotel to friends.

",5,2015,01,17
223,Romantic spa break,"Room was spotless and the new red decor is really nice . 
Sirloin steak was the BEST I've ever had! The food in the restaurant was amazing ! My back massage was really enjoyable I really felt that the therapist altered it to my needs .  Even fell asleep in the relaxation room after which is also beautifully decorated and has a great range of herbal teas and refreshments . The only negative is when we got to reception the guy told us to sign in to use the pool but no mention of the spa we didn't realise that it was the spa reception aswell so we walked through not knowing where to go we walked around the spa area trying to find where to go for our treatments a few minutes later we walked back down to ask him where to go and he told we were now late for our treatments and that they would be cut short , had we have been told where to go in the first place we wouldn't have been . ",4,2015,01,15
223,Awful staff and service,Stayed in this hotel for two nights. It wasn't my first time to stay or dine we come regularly. Left my hot new GHD straightener on table and went down for breakfast. While having breakfast the cleaner was in the room.  I was so busy doing activities I didn't pay attention to the GHD. When I left there was nothing in the room. I came home and seen my GHD was not in my bag. I called the hotel to ask if anything was left and nothing. It was obvious then that my GHD was ROBBED. I had the worst phone calls with the manager he put me on hold for a half an hour. Calls were going back and forward from 2pm till 10pm. I will never be visiting this hotel again!!!!!!!,1,2015,01,15
223,Helpful staff & beautiful hotel!,"My husband and I stayed at the Castleknock hotel & country club for 3 nights at the beginning of January. We both work a lot over Christmas and new year so enjoy a break away to spend some time together every January. There was a good deal on flight prices to Dublin airport and the hotel website was offering 20% off for visitors staying 3 nights or more. As we were looking to mostly relax and unwind as well as do a bit of sightseeing this seemed liked a great place as it was out of the city and had a spa.
Having looked at the hotel location before booking I decided that hiring a car would be beneficial as the transport links to Castleknock didn't look particular feasible for our needs. 
I'd like to thank the reception staff who went out of their way to help us, firstly when I enquired about early check in, which was accommodated on the day via email as I had no phone reception - very speedy replies! Also when we couldn't get hold of the spa to confirm an appointment they did it for us and answered many other questions and queries during our stay, nothing was too much trouble. In fact all the staff were pleasant and polite, I particularly liked that we could request fresh milk to be brought to our rooms for coffees at no extra charge.
We stayed in room 217, a standard room and it is easily one of the biggest hotel rooms I have ever stayed in for their 'standard' accommodation. Everything is decorated to a high standard including the bathroom with all fixtures and fittings. 
The pool and spa were lovely. The guide in the hotel rooms advises that the pool is busiest between 4-6pm so we avoided this time, and only used the pool when it was occupied with a few other guests later in the evenings. We booked a couples escape package in the spa which was an hour and a half of pure bliss!
We didn't eat at any of the hotel restaurants as the menus didn't particularly appeal to us, but the Blanchsrdstown shopping centre which is a short drive away has lots of restaurants and fast food outlets. I would recommend captain america's - great service and food.
There is also a smaller shopping centre a short drive away called roselawn which has a small tesco which we used to stock up on some essentials.
The only minor criticisms we had is that although the hotel looks great on an evening when it is lit up outside, we had a room overlooking the front of the building and found there was a lot of light pollution which came in above the top of the curtains which made it difficult to fall asleep on our first night (we did get used to this by the second night). Also the tv was quite small and had some issues with its volume, which would turn itself up and down during a programme of its own accord.
Other than those small niggles we had a fabulous stay and would thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone looking to stay outside of the city centre.",5,2015,01,13
223,Birthday treat,"My family organised a surprise birthday evening  for me for me at the Castleknock Hotel and Country Club last week. The hotel is modern with a very spacious lobby. I had a very large suite with everything - shower, bath, bathrobes, trousers press, iron,slippers, bottled water,two televisions and a wonderful view of the golf course and small lake. The staff had left a birthday card for me and some delicious little cakes. Dinner was superb and well presented. As it was Friday there was live music in the lounge and that got our toes tapping.and we even had a little dance .A good time was had by all including my six grandchildren. There was plenty of choice for breakfast so we all ate heartily. The staff are all friendly and efficent. I have wonderful memories of my birthday celebrations at the Castleknock Hotel and Country Club...",5,2015,01,12
223,Lovely little touches ,"Just got back from a mid week
Break to Ireland. We booked for a 2 night stay and unfortunately missed the flight. After a short email to the hotel I was offered a reduction for the first night. Which was extremely nice of them as I had not given the 24hrs notice.
On arrival the hotel looked exactly like the website pictures. We quickly checked in and went to our room. To our delight we had been upgraded and due to my email stating it was my birthday I was greeted with chocolates balloons a card and a cake ! This was fantastic of the hotel to do. 
The taxi from the airport was really expensive however we were told about the local bus service to the city centre. This was a short 5 minutes walk to the stop however the bus journey was over 30 minutes long but only cost 3.30 euros each. Where as a taxi was over 30euros. 
We didn't eat in the hotel as we only had one night n wanted to make the use of the night in Dublin. We did however have breakfast. This was disappointing. The hot food looked and tasted like it had been under the hot plate for some
Time. It was very dry and the beans had skin on them. 
We then decided to use the ""spa"". This again was disappointed. We were told that we could not use the pool without caps (which isn't mentioned anywhere on website) the sauna is very dirty and the females toilet and showers are very poor and don't flush properly. We only stayed for 30 minutes  before leaving
Due to the early departure from the spa we decided to get the bus back into Dublin and get the bus to the airport. This was much cheaper (7 euros each) than the taxi. And took the same amount of time  
All in all the hotel and staff are lovely but not a good location if you want to visit dublin city centre (without the travelling to and from and also airport)
We would def come again if we wanted a relaxing hotel not in the centre",4,2015,01,10
223,Nice hotel,Stayed here 28th December on booking took advantage of upgrade part of which was bathrobes on arrival found there was none so rang and asked two hours later rang again told on way one hour later got phone call to say no robes available when suggested that I should pay the flat price 10 minutes later my robes arrived hey presto,4,2015,01,09
223,Relaxing,A very nice relaxing hotel .. have been numerous times and always had a great time. On our last visit Only slight downfalls was the dinner menu and lack of wifi in the room but apart from that everything was great,4,2015,01,08
223,Overcrowded and understaffed,"The bedroom view was a huge area of rubbish bins and laundry, the beds were not made properly, there was no internet in the bedrooms, the pool was overcrowded as was the hotel lobby, the food was expensive but of poor quality and yet it took over an hour to be served, the New Year fireworks were short and cheap. The only nice thing about the hotel were the friendly staff but even they seemed rushed and over worked!",1,2015,01,06
223,Nice Hotel - but not so nice Spa,"We stayed for a long weekend to enjoy golfing and Spa. The Hotel is very, with friendly service, nice food and clean rooms. Nothing to complain about - BUT, using the Tonic Spa we have been in a complete different world according to cleaning service. Both, men and women locker room and showers seemed to be cleaned regularly and appear really dirty. You definitely have to wear some swimming shoes or something similar. The womens toilet did not flush properly for days and nobody cared. There is Spa Service stuff running around and they tick regularly some boxes, but obviously nobody seems to be responsible to clean up regularly. The same for the Sauna (not the steam) . Dont look on the floor. It is really dirty as well and we could even seem some lost things laying there for days. 
As I said in the beginning. The hotel is nice, but as the spa facilities belong to the complex and booking as well, it leaves us a not so nice taste at the end. This should be easily solved and I hope the management is responding, because we would like to come back.",3,2015,01,04
223,Repeat visitors,"We have stayed 3 times with our 2 young kids & find this to be a wonderful hotel. Nice restaurants & a good location for access to the likes of Dublin Zoo, Phoenix Park & Blanchardstown Shopping Centre. On our most recent stay the staff made a fuss over our daughter when they were told it was her birthday. This included leaving a birthday card, chocs & cake in our room for her!! The swimming pool is always popular with our kids too. Heartily recommend.",5,2014,12,28
223,Long walks everywhere!! ,"My sister and I stayed here over the week of St Paddy's day. We were travelers on a budget but splurged a little on the castlenock because it looked so beautiful on there website for our first trip to Ireland. We should have just stayed in the city at a cheaper place. We booked a double room online but didn't realize we had booked the furthest room away from anything in the hotel! We had to hike down 3 extremely long hallways just to make it to our room each day. We also were told from the gentleman at the front desk that the bus stop into the city was just a short walk down the road from the hotel. We were told to turn left at the gate and walk down the road. After figuring out from our surroundings and stopping a friendly bike rider we were informed we had turned the wrong direction at the gate and needed to turn back. We hiked for 2 and a half hours!!! Just to find the bus stop that wasn't anywhere the front desk said it was. This hotel is not close to anything so factor in taxi fair into your budget of you choose to stay here. We also thought that there was a bus running from the hotel into the city on the website but that is false. You have to pay for a taxi to get to and from this hotel. Our room was also very disappointing.  There was mold along the grout in the shower and on the ceiling above the shower. Our view from our hotel room was the back parking lot and garbage cans. Not your typical picture of gorgeous Ireland.  Thank goodness I had stayed in another hotel at the beginning of the trip that was in the city and I did most of my sightseeing then. We also stayed out of our hotel room as much as possible sightseeing but did not look forward to coming back everyday. We dreaded our super long walk through the hotel everyday after long days of walking around Dublin. So if you do decide to book a room here be prepared to pay for a taxi to and from, long walks if your unlucky enough to get the farthest room away from the entrance, and be prepared for lots of weddings or reunions going on all the time. We were blasted by music from the lobby and bar every time we came in. It's definitely a hotel for those types of things and not really for travelers. ",2,2014,12,28
223,Ok Hotell great staff,"Nice Hotell ,Good service even though there was two wedding going on .
Breakfast was also good 
Reception staff much better than the average ,
Outside sitting area ,pool ,and lots of parking area, wifi , rooms good for the price , 
Sadly we could only stay one night  ,",4,2014,12,23
223,Fabulous!!!!!!!!,"I recently attended a family christening at this hotel, and I cannot praise the hotel enough, the staff were so friendly (particularly Andrew who did the bar for us), but really all of the staff were so accommodating and polite.  As you can impagine we had a few children there, and i must say they were treated in the same way the adults were.  We had booked the finger food, and i must say the presentation was fantastic, they could not have done anything more for us than they did. Well done to all the staff at this hotel, i would certainly recommend it for any ocassion.",5,2014,12,22
223,Good Choice for the Dublin Suburbs,"Located to the Northwest of the City Centre, this hotel is close to the M50, Dublin's main road artery. 

It's quite a spacious hotel and has the look and style of the type of hotel you find in the Mid West of the US. It's also relatively new and has a generally modern feel.

The hotel's guests are a mix of tourists, business people and local club members.  As the name suggests, the hotel has sports facilities, including a gym, pool and golf course.

Overall, I had a positive experience, but there were a few let downs. Wifi was not great. Signal was patchy in the hotel room and the speeds were slow. 

While the hotel is quite modern, the same cannot be said of the in room TV, which was a small silver 4:3 screen that would have looked cool maybe 15 years ago. In addition the channel selection was completely random, with annoying blank channels in between those that were actually tuned in.

While in general the hotel appeared to be very clean, I managed to get a room which had a nasty sticky table. Of course I only discovered this when it was too late, so I was not happy to find my shirt sticking to the table, having worked on my laptop for a half hour.

Breakfast tasted good, but the hot buffet serving area was too congested, with about ten hot items packed into a single service area making it difficult to get food from the hot plates. You had to lift a lid, them find somewhere to put it, get the item, return the lid and so on.  It also seemed like there were fewer serving utensils than there were dishes, so the same utensils were being used for multiple items.  Not good for coeliacs or those with specific dietary preferences.",4,2014,12,09
223,Top notch Business Hotel,"A little tricky to find if driving and be sure to take care on the narrow roads nearby. 

First class rooms. Well equipped , warm and quiet. 

Staff couldn't be more friendly and helpful. Breakfast was extensive

Quite a trek though from here into the City Center . So plan ahead and allow lots of time.",4,2014,12,09
223,80th Birthday for our Mammy,"Guy Thompson, you should be very proud of your hotel and staff.

We contacted the hotel in August 2014 to arrange an overnight stay and dinner which is what my mother wanted to celebrate her 8oth Birthday. I dealt with Audrey, Sioban, Gayle and Lorraine in the initial stages and many more staff on arriving at the hotel, I wish I had the complete list of names. Nothing was of any trouble to them, their utter professionalism and attention to detail went beyond my expectations.  The event took place on Friday, December 5th at The Castle Suite, it was a fantastic night of celebration.  On behalf of our family, I want to say thank you to all of the wonderful staff that made our stay and event go so seamlessly. The little touch in my mothers room on arrival of a personally written card, balloons and chocolates was so lovely and this was the marker for how the rest of the event went.  We cannot thank you all enough as every little thing made us feel very special at such a busy time in your calendar year.

From us all, a huge thank you, your staff are absolutely amazing, we will definitely return.",5,2014,12,07
223,Winning winter escape,"Spent 3 nights here last weekend and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The twin room was very spacious and comfortable and spotlessly clean. Really enjoyed the leisure facilities staff are very friendly and accommodating and a minor issues was very quickly resolved by the floor manager. Directions to the hotel were provided by the hotel on site and they were spot on and very easy to follow. 
Breakfast at the weekend is served until 11 & had a excellent selection of  produce.
If your looking for a little bit of peace and quiet you can't look past the Castleknock Hotel :)",4,2014,12,06
223,Wedding treat.........,"We attended a wedding here in November and booked in for the night.
Firstly as we were travelling some distance to the hotel & my wife didn't want her dress to get creased I chanced my arm and called asking for an early check in (on a Saturday). The receptionist assured me that they would have a room available by 11:30am. We arrived at 11:45, reception was busy with people checking in but we didn't have to wait long and sure enough our room was ready for us. The room was large, spotless and very comfortable. The bathroom was exceptional with a great selection of toiletries and finally tea & coffee making with MUGS, yes MUGS, a fantastic alternative to the normal thimble sized cups. A great start to the day where things only got better.
We returned to the hotel for the wedding reception & I can't fault anything from there on. Bar staff in the main bar & at the wedding were great, food & service was wonderful and a great night was had by all (believe me I checked).
Breakfast the following day continued what we had come to expect. Great cold food buffet, great hot food section & selection of breads & rolls & wonderful cooked to order poached eggs.
I spoke to other wedding guests at breakfast and again nothing but praise for the hotel. Checkout was seamless and we left having had a great time at a wonderful hotel.
Will definitely return in the future.",5,2014,12,04
223,excellent stay ,Well stayed at this hotel for one night and had dinner on the 3 rd December and had a lovely server named Lauren she was so nice making sure everything was ok for me and my partner and such a lovely girl . Rooms were gorgeous advantage smoking room and bar was so relaxing and bar girl named Laura was also so nice and pleasant . leisure center was also a bonus . Would highly recommend and would be visiting again . ,4,2014,12,04
223,great night away,we stayed on We dnesday and woke to a very heavy frost. We were worried about clearing the windscreen and were amazed to find at the front door a table full of jugs of warm water!!!! Well done castleknock yet another way you put the guest first.,5,2014,11,28
223,great hotel great location,"I stayed in this hotel recently and was delighted with my stay. Good food, great decor, good staff, and a great golf course. There is also a very good pool area with steam / sauna rooms to sooth the tired limbs. The village of Castleknock is a very pleasent 20 minute walk away.",5,2014,11,19
223,Good wedding venue,Stayed at this hotel while attending a wedding. The room was good but not great. bar areas nice and modern with live music every night. Ate one night in restaurant and food was tasty especially the creme brulee.,4,2014,11,17
223,Good facilities but a disappointing welcome,"This has most things you would expect from a large hotel with spa/beauty centre attached. It is located near the River Liffey and there is a golf course beside it. But it was very difficult to find the way there from the M50 and I was not the only one to have problems finding it despite an earlier Google search. No brown signs seemed to be at any of the obvious junctions near Castleknock and I ended up touring around nearby housing estates which cover the area that was once green fields in DUBLIN WEST.
On arrival the staff at reception (four of them) were too busy dealing with a lady leaving in a cash deposit. Then after several minutes waiting they told me my room had not been paid for in advance although I was a guest at a dinner that night. The meal itself was good but the breakfast was disappointing with my wife receiving porridge with big lumps and a long wait for a table even though there seemed to be places vacant in the conservatory type overflow room. For these reasons reasons I can only give 3 rather than 4 stars though I am sure such problems would be easy enough to resolve with better staff training and a look at the breakfast arrangements. On the plus side: free wifi and parking. But another disadvantage was the location of our bedroom at the end of one of the side wings and a five minutes walk from main reception where there seemed to be only two lifts. So a bit of a strange layout for a hotel. Obviously a high-rise design was out of the question for planning reasons.",3,2014,11,17
223,Beautiful retreat,"We stayed here to attend a black tie dinner.  The meal was excellent, and the surroundings elegant , although the function room was rather dark with only a few chandeliers.
The room was clean and the bed was very comfortable.
The breakfast was disappointing as the food was cold.  The staff were pleasant and apologetic but our experience was rather tainted.
We would come back to play golf possibly.",4,2014,11,16
223,Lovely retreat,"We stayed here to attend a black tie dinner.
The hotel was clean, comfortable and we'll run.  We would have liked to play golf on the course as it looked very nice.  The surrounding area is within easy traveling distance of central Dublin, but the grounds etc are quiet and scenic.
Our breakfast was slightly disappointing as the 'hot' buffet wasn't.  The staff were apologetic and our timing may have been the problem as they replenished the buffet with fresh food immediately afterwards.  We would happily stay here again.",4,2014,11,15
223,Not worth the money ,"My partner & I booked a Saturday night get away at this hotel, we were left disappointed.
Firstly we booked a double bed & got to singles pushed together(not very comfortable if your sleeping on the crack. There was a smell in our room I can only persume it was coming from The shower. There was fans/ air con units on the roof which kept us awake at night & woke us in the morning..
Not the kind of getaway we planned  & expensive for ‚Ç¨170. On the plus side the food was nice ' the waitressing staff were friendly & helpful---didn't seem like a 4 star to me:-( 
Won't be in a hurry back... ",3,2014,11,10
223,Decent hotel in the countryside,"Stayed midweek for 3 nights break mon 3rd - thurs 6th november 
On arrival found staff to be very professional and were offered early check in and got a smoking room as requested 
Unfortunately because of this i think we got one of the worst room in the hotel , Room was tired and the view was shocking , fortunately it was however decent sized and clean with a very comfortable queen sized bed .
Food was ok but only just , bland and uninspiring and certainly not worth the price tag 
All in all i wouldnt rush back but wouldnt avoid either hence the 3/5 score",3,2014,11,06
223,Just gets better,Stayed recently for two nights in the Castleknock Hotel over the mid term break. As always top class service and excellent food . Have to say that the standard of food in the refurbished restaurant was excellent.,5,2014,11,02
223,You can feel the country side while not being far from Dublin,"Stayed here for 3 nights in September. Decided on this hotel as it was 'away' from the buzz while sufficiently near to Blanchardstown Shopping Centre (short drive away). 

While the overall stay was pleasant, we were given a room where the windows face some kind of generator. If you are a light sleeper, the buzzing noise from the generator might be a nuisance. 

Having read reviews of the possible noises from kids and pissed adults when there is a wedding going on, we were lucky that this didn't happen to us - as we stayed during midweek. 

Remember to make use of the on-site gym and swimming pool. However, you may want to avoid early mornings for the gym as it's public members use the gym before work. We didn't use the pool, as the pool is also used quite frequently for classes.",4,2014,10,30
223,Fab hotel!,Stayed here a few months ago and LOVED it. Got a great midweek rate from trivago. Rooms are lovely and we had a great view of the grounds. The staff were nice and it had great facilities. Didn't use the bar/restaurant so can't comment on that but everything else was spot on. Hopefully I will get the chance to stay here again in the not so distant future,5,2014,10,27
223,bad experience,Stayed here for one night for a wedding our room was OK on the first floor but my sister had looked a suite and when she arrived they were informed her suite she had booked two months earlier was not available after about an hour they found a suite for her but at this stage she and her partner had missed her nephew's civil ceremony the food at the reception was cold and bland not a good experience when we did go to bed could not sleep as a lot of noise from downstairs breakfast where do I start long wait to be seated food poor quality did not enjoy my stay here,3,2014,10,26
223,Poor service,Stayed here for two nights the rooms where nice and clean and the bed was very comfortable. However the service was very poor waiting long time at the bar to be serviced and when final serviced some of the bar staff were less than friendly. When we went to go have food where turn away from the dinning area stated that they where fully booked with only two ppl dining and watch most of the night there was no more than four table full at any time. Only the two of us looking to have dinner so found this very strange. Had food at the bar wait half hour for some one to take are order final went just ask the bar man to take are order. My partner did try raise our concern as to the bad bar service but did not seem very interested. Wont be back would be a nice place to stay if the service was improved could be due to it being busy but this is not a good enough reason for the service we got.,1,2014,10,19
223,disappointed,"booked at last minute. although there was a wedding in hotel and the room allocated was above the reception we were not made aware of this and the noise was deafening until approx 2pm. Also we booked a special deal with breakfast and dinner however when we arrived (half hour after booking) we were told by a cold receptionist that we needed to have dinner between 6 and 7 as restaurant too busy. (it was half 4!). She agreed to let us eat in bar with our allowance of a meal. Rooms are good and comfortable. We went to bar for dinner and ended up having to beg member of staff to serve us. The waitress was not friendly and hardly spoke a word to us thoughtout the whole evening. Food was ok, starter better than main course. We felt rushed and an inconvenience!  Only good point is breakfast was so tasty and well attended but we won't be back.",3,2014,10,18
223,Lovely views very friendly staff,Lovely walk from the Resort and very pleasant service from the staff. We did not have a meal but saw the meals being served to others and they looked delicious.,4,2014,10,14
223,Very disappointed,"We know this is a bit late but we thought we had already sent this in.
We stayed in August of this year and it was our 5th stay in exactly 2 years. The  very reason we stay here is because it is situated very conveniently near our closest friends house. Each time we have stayed the nightly rate has gone up increasingly high and the service from the Reception staff especially has gone downhill. This last time, there was no welcome back or cheerful acknowledgement from the young lady checking us in. We had a situation in the lift where the doors closed suddenly on my wife throwing her inside to the rear and left her badly shaken. We reported it immediately to a fairly uninterested. Staff member at Reception and was not contacted my a Manager or person of Authority which should have happened.",3,2014,10,14
223,"Great Service, Great Food",Had a really enjoyable two nights stay recently. Excellent food and fantastic service by Maciej. Hopefully will return again soon. One quibble the kettle in our room wasn't working and wasn't replaced until the next morning.,4,2014,10,12
223,Mixed review,"Recently stayed here for a 3night break with my boyfriend for a relaxing getaway. To start with we arrived early and were kindly offered early check in to our room, which was a good size all very clean and tidy, with a comfy bed but sadly at night was a bit noisy from some kind of generator outside the window,also an annoying tapping sound from radiator and large gap in curtains in the mornings woke me with the daylight coming through. However the breakfast was really nice with a good choice from a full cooked breakfast to cold buffet and cereals etc, it's a good idea to take advantage of vouchers from reception the night before to get a better price as very expensive to pay full price every day. Also with dinner we ordered two beer and burger offers only for them to arrive raw,pink and very bland even chips didn't taste of much :/ also then to be told we couldn't have the beers we wanted either. We are by no means tight and don't mind paying for quality food but when it's that bad and at that price plus not much apology plus still being hungry and only a 10% off the bill offered we were not to happy shall we say. 
Anyways we headed into the city for something decent to eat the next day which was great. We returned wanted to have a drink in our room, so my boyfriend went down in person and requested an ice bucket and some glasses, when one hour had passed and still no ice he went down again to a duty manager who then said would send some up by which time our drink was warm so we got it out selfs from the bar in the end,not great seeing as it's only abit of ice! Our last day we used the lovely jacuzzi, steam room,sauna and pool. Only thing not great is having to wear swimming caps, which we had paid for at the desk and were told compulsory. Bit annoyed when we saw other users not wearing them and staff said nothing :/ don't really see the point if no one else is going to do it and we felt abit silly in them. Other than those complaints we did enjoy our stay, may not return but we still made our own fun and enjoyed some of the surroundings. Hope this helps other potential guests :) ",3,2014,10,08
223,Nice setting - noisy rooms,"Situated on the outskirts of Dublin, the hotel would have great potential. 
Unfortunately there are a few shortcomings:
Food and beverage: Both meals I had were bland and left to be desired.
Front desk: On two occasions mail left for me at the front desk was not announced to my room. Only after having had a message from the senders and pro-actively asking for the respective mail it was handed over.
Sound proofing: The sound proofing inside the hotel is extremely bad, especially concerning the sanitary facilities: Every shower (and else!) from all rooms (left, right, above and below) could be heard.",3,2014,10,06
223,Peacefull setting,"We went to this Hotel for a conference and stayed three nights. The rooms are a bit tired but OK. Very noisy from the corridor. The hotel is VERY child friendly and you have children screaming at the top of their voices running around the reception area and lounge playing catch. Nobody does anything about it. I have to say, as a country retreat, it‚Äôs not ideal. Very friendly and helpful staff. A normal taxi fair to town is about 26 Euro. No restaurants close by within walking distance.",3,2014,10,01
223,"Looks beautifully located, but machinery in the yard runs all night","Staying here for a business trip I looked at the net presentation and looked forward to a peaceful stay in the outskirts of Dublin. Close to the huge Phoenix  park I expected a possibility of a walk from the hotel. In the yard outside the rooms were a huge machinery, making it impossible to sleep with the windows open. During the day the banging of doors ( no way to close them silently) also made a nap impossible. The reception offered another room, so I packed the suitcase, but on returning was gold there was no room available after all. Walking from the hotel to the Phoenix park was a hasardious activity with hardly any sidewalks and heavy traffic going fast.",3,2014,09,30
223,"Great Hotel, Lovely staff and Fab Spa","This hotel is very unassuming from the outside, but inside is a different experience. I stayed with my sister and a friend and we just wanted a little chilling out time. We booked Bed , Breakfast, evening meal and a Spa experince and I can honestly say that everything was great. We had a lovely room, Food was excellent and the Spa and it's staff were great.

Although the hotel is in the Countryside for anyone wishing to add in a shopping trip, it is about a 10 minute drive to Blanchardstown Shopping Centre and only a short Train journey to Dublin City Centre.

I definitely recommend this hotel to all.",5,2014,09,30
223,Quality hotel,"We've stayed at this hotel a few times now and have bein impressed ever time,  staff are great food is very good and the rooms and facilities are excellent very child friendly as well all makes for a super stay! ",5,2014,09,28
223,Marvellous,"Stayed in Castelknock hotel for one night on the 25th Sept, this is our fifth time to stay there ,  I booked on line late with no difficulty reservations staff very helpful sending conformation by email within five mins. 
CK in staff very efficient ,pleasant, informative with a smile.
We were given room  on 1st floor at front 117 spacious ,clean large room, bathroom was well equipped with  shower and bath full bathroom toiletries  supplied.
Had dinner which was delicious lamb cooked to my choice My wife had chicken risotto which she said was perfect no negatives on any of courses, breakfast was good although they could not supply kippers as they had run out of them.
CK out was simplest I have encountered in any hotel I have stayed in no mistakes.
Cant comment on wines don't drink alcohol .

Will be returning soon.
",5,2014,09,26
223,Four night stay,"Our room was clean, spacious with a room safe, ironing board, iron and pant press. We had a full bed and a single bed. The bathroom included a separate shower and bath, very clean. Our room overlooked the front entrance so if you want a view, ask for a room that overlooks the golf course. My sister did a spa treatment and she said it was lovely. We walked to the bus stop which was five minutes away and traveled into Dublin for 3.05 euros instead of taking a 20 euro taxi ride. The bus had free Wi-Fi, so did the hotel, and the trip only took 30 minutes leaving us off in downtown Dublin close to Temple Bar. School children ride public transportation so be careful not to return to the hotel around 4:30 pm, bus was full.",4,2014,09,26
223,Another relaxing stay,"We recently stayed at the Castleknock hotel after having stayed a week in Ireland .

Castleknock Hotel is always the hotel where we stay before returning to England. We visit Ireland a few times a year.

The staff are excellent - this includes  Management , Reception staff, dining and bar staff and Accomodation staff.

The Executive rooms are lovely and spacious with plenty of hot water in the bathrooms and excellent shower.

The food again is excellent. There are also very good offers eg: Bed & breakfast and evening meal for a very reasonable price.

The location of the hotel is very relaxing overlooking the golf course.

We are looking forward to our next visit which we hope will be early next year.",5,2014,09,24
223,Mid Week Break,We took advantage of their special offer of ‚Ç¨67pp overnight B & B plus Dinner and a free drink.It was our third visit to this property and we were never disappointed. Given an executive room overlooking the adjoining golf course. Free WiFi in room and excellent swimming pool and leisure facilities. Had our complimentary drinks with our evening meal. Food was excellent. My wife had beautiful Lamb and I paid the ‚Ç¨6 supplement for very tender steak. Reasonable breakfast following morning though dining room was very busy. We will certainly be back to take advantage of similar mid week offers,5,2014,09,23
223,Great option for any family trip to Dublin,Stayed here night before taking ferry from Dublin. Worked out really well. Nice bar food and huge plus is they were very helpful with our son's food allergies - going as far as cooking him his own fries in dedicated oil even though the kitchen was very busy. Rooms are very nice and very clean. Will be heading back next time in Dublin.,5,2014,09,22
223,Country hotel not far from Dublin,Large hotel out in country but not far from M50. Near to blanchardstown shopping centre and Phoenix Park. Price very reasonable compared to other Dublin hotels Great big foyer where you can relax have a drink food TV etc. nice outside area. Rooms good size but not many TV channels. Golf course. Staff friendly but quite slow. Dining room food delicious. Very different. Breakfast terrible. I've stayed a few times and it's always the same. No selection for the size of hotel and always busy. Saying that I love this hotel but would like a bigger breakfast area with tastier food. ,4,2014,09,18
223,Very pleasant stay on business but would enjoy for downtime too,"A real pleasure to stay here at a bargain rate booked direct online. Very well appointed, lovely staff wherever I went, all very helpful and smiling. The gym and pool are great, the rooms comfortable, spacious and well appointed. Dinner was delicious although the menu quite limited. Breakfast a buffet but good range, just dislike paper napkins!! Would stay again. ",4,2014,09,17
223,Nice hotel outside of the city,"My husband and I stayed for one night as we were attending a family function which was being held here.  We found our room to be very spacious, comfortable and nicely presented.  Room service was efficient and I would highly recommend the steak sandwich, one of the best I have eaten in a long time!  I was also impressed with the service at the function I attended and that the staff very obligingly kept the bar open so late for the lingering revellers who weren't ready for bed!  However the breakfast area seemed far too small for a hotel of this size, and we had to queue for a table.  The hot buffet was a bit uninspiring but as I had already waited so long I did not fancy having to wait even longer for something made to order.  But all in all, this would be my only criticism for what was otherwise a very pleasant stay.",4,2014,09,13
223,Lovely ,"Had a gorgeous stay here a few months ago. We booked one nights stay with dinner and really enjoyed it. 

The attention to detail is great. The food was delicious. 

The only small niggle was we had to wait 15 mins to be seated for breakfast, this was due to the fact there was a large wedding party there. ",5,2014,09,13
223,Great Hotel but standards are slipping,"I stayed here for a few nights in the last couple of weeks on Business and I think that standards are starting to slip. I stayed here a couple of years ago and it was really great back then. When I stayed this time first of all I was given a smoking room :-( the girl on reception couldn't believe it was but when she checked it she said she didn't realize that the hotel had smoking rooms??? The Wifi is extremely slow around the hotel. I taught is was because it was so busy but it wasn't much better the next time and it was quite enough around. I would advise you if you are bringing a laptop with you to bring a connection for it to be wired in room, it is lighting fast 100mps. Just as well because the TV's are very small and the station choice it very poor. The second night I stayed I was in Room 216 and the TV reception was so bad I turned it off and watched football on the laptop. Also in the same room I went to make a cup of tea and found more that 1 human hair in the top of the kettle. The pool and gym are excellent but the gym do get busy so pick your time wisely. Its a great location just a few minutes away from the M50. Bar staff are quite slow and you wouldn't want to be starving when you order, it can take a while. But when you get the food it is very good but could do with more veg and stuff. Most of the staff seem nice and friendly, they would all say hello. Would go back but hope they can sort out the few small issues. I know I am complaining about a lot but it wasn't all bad. I left in 2 feedback cards with most of these issues but no one replied to me which I was surprised about.

Donal.",3,2014,09,12
223,Castleknock Hotel & Country Club,"I was there on May/2014 on a business trip, this hotel is not suited for anyone that doesn't have a car, it's so far from everything, no bus stations taxi's are rare to find , food is very good although it's the same everyday and i was there for two weeks !, this hotel is close to a very unique and amazing golf course, i believe that this hotel would be best for a romantic trip for a couple that don't intend to leave this hotel toward the city, or else get yourself a car !! WiFi is average, during the day it hardly worked, during the night it was okay.",3,2014,09,10
223,Great hotel,"Stayed here for a weekend with the family while attending an event in Pheonix Park. The rooms were very spacious, clean and comfortable.
Breakfaast was excellent, we went early on the Saturday morning and got on much better than when we went later on the sunday where it was extremely busy. We had dinner in the Brasserie on the Saturday night also, the food was excellent and the service and attention we received was great.
I had a treatment in the spa that was fabulous and my therapist was lovely. The pool facilities are very good also.
Overall a lovely hotel in the countryside but only minutes from all the amenities Dublin has to offer!",5,2014,09,09
223,Fantastic Hotel - Highly recommended!,"Me and my Mrs stayed here recently for a few nights to celebrate my 30th birthday.

Having arrived about 40 mins before the designated check in time of 3pm, our room was ready straight away. In addition, we were advised that we had been upgraded to an Executive Suite and had been allocated ‚Ç¨29 of credit due to a price change. Result!

Our room was wonderful. Spacious, clean and modern - with a beautiful view of the golf course out of our window, which opened. We had emailed a few days earlier requesting a desk fan, which they responded to promptly and courteously, and we were pleased to find that waiting for us. Our room had free, stable, and unlimited WiFi, an iPhone/iPod dock, large TV, GHD straighteners (which I'm told are good...) comfy beds, a lovely bathroom/shower and all the amenities you would expect, or want. On top of that, we had heated bathroom floor tiles! Lovely!

My partner had also emailed a week or so before our stay to arrange a little surprise for me in our room when we arrived; a bottle of Prosecco sitting in ice. They had also gone to the extra effort of leaving a hand written birthday card and a little birthday cake. Very impressed.

Our main concern pre-trip was travelling to and from Dublin city centre. We had read some horror stories on here about ‚Ç¨20+ costs to get there from the hotel. I'm pleased to report that this is nonsense. Having spent a bit of time & effort upon arrival in Dublin we found multiple modes of transport available. At ‚Ç¨3 per trip, we settled on the train and used it multiple times to and from the city without issue. Get off at Coolmine Station, which is a pleasant 15 min walk to the hotel. There is also a bus service that goes into the city that is much closer to the hotel, but we preferred the train for speed and efficiency. The bus stop on the opposite side of the road to the city bus takes you to Blanchardstown Shopping Centre which is a modern place full of shops and places to eat.

Castleknock's Park Restaurant is pretty much as we expected. With prices at the high end, only eat here if you're happy to pay the extra. I'm pleased to say you do indeed get what you pay for, quality food, great service and a lovely ambiance. We used our ‚Ç¨29 of credit and put it towards our meal, which the reception and restaurant staff implemented with a minimum of fuss. We went for the 4 courses for ‚Ç¨37.50 option, which minus our credit, only cost us ‚Ç¨30 each for that and a beer and a wine each. Decent value.

For those wishing to play a round at the adjoining golf course, I would again highly recommend doing so. A round costs ‚Ç¨30 and high quality hire clubs are available at ‚Ç¨30 as well. The course is picturesque and challenging, whilst still being suitable for the fair weather golfer like myself. With my Mrs caddying for a birthday treat (and instagramming the views) I thoroughly enjoyed my round - including my chip in birdie on the 18th, which drew a round of applause!

Maid service was courteous and of a good standard. We used the 'Do Not Disturb' sign for a lay in one morning and they called us after midday to arrange a time for them to clean our room when it was convenient for us, which we appreciated. 

The health club and pool were of a decent quality, and well worth a visit. There were quite a lot of kids having fun in the pool during the day. However, at 6pm they are asked to leave and the place quietens right down until 9pm when it closes, which is ideal if you fancy a more peaceful relax in the jacuzzi.

All in all, we would both highly recommend the Castleknock Hotel & Country Club to anyone planning a break in the wonderful city of Dublin. We have been on quite a few city break style getaways and I can safely say that CHCC is by far the nicest place we have stayed in. Having never left a review on Tripadvisor before, we enjoyed our stay so much I felt compelled to do so. If ever we are back in Dublin, we will be staying again.

Many thanks to all the staff.

Mick (and Charlie) x",5,2014,09,08
223,Good hotel,"Stayed here a few times over the past 4 years or so, both with the kids and without. Still get emails from them but special offers are no longer as good as they used to be. Couldn't fault the rooms, leisure centre, bar or breakfast. We never ate in the restaurant so cannot comment on that. Do intend to return if we get the right deal.",4,2014,09,07
223,Prices up - standards down,"I still like this hotel but definitely prices are up and standards are down in comparison to 2013
Once again this year when we phoned to book a midweek package the ""reservations"" lady was clearly not au fait with them.  It's not rocket science, there aren't that many packages on the website.   She confused me even more than I already was AND she was not pleasant to deal with.  I felt I was a pest more than a potential guest. 

Last year - evening dinner was excellent.  This year we were seated at a table in the breakfast room instead of dining room (there were free tables in the dining room) and we had pre booked.  The food offering was way below 2013 standards.   So bad, I didn't bother with dessert.

The rooms are still in good nick, but even though my daughter and her son paid only 8euro less than us they were not treated to some of the extra in room treats that we were.   (Dressing gowns, slippers, hot chocolate, ipod connector)

Staff service standards are very mixed, some are really professional and others the complete opposite.   I want to compliment the lovely female ma√Ætre d' in the breakfast room who is cheery and helpful.  She was also there last year with the same attitude.   Housekeeping staff are really good, friendly and do a good job.   Bar staff are not friendly, quite grumpy actually.    Leisure centre staff are snooty, unfriendly and up themselves   Do they think that they are on the set of  'Bondi Rescue' and that they are too good for all the rest of us?    I think so.   I saw the  pool guard give out to a lady for taking a snapshot of her kids in the pool, yet did nothing when a group of teenagers were divebombing into the pool later.  

Our receptionist on arriving and leaving was excellent, very friendly,  professional and efficient.

I had an issue, I left my reading glasses behind me in the room.  It could have been handled so well, but was handled quite badly by the hotel.   One phone call to me from the hotel would have sorted the whole thing rather than three phone calls from me (one of which included a very rude reaction from a receptionist).    A duty manager later on told me that she would investigate this matter and get back to me, I never heard from her again, and two emails from me on the subject went unanswered.
Lack of communication among staff and varied service standards are two reasons for the  unfortunate dip in standards.

The hotel asked for a review from me, I gave it, which resulted in a phone call from the assistant manager.   He was very professional, but it was a case of too little too late unfortunately.

Would I return?  Maybe.   The positives of this hotel just slightly outweigh the negs.",4,2014,09,03
223,wonderfull hotel,had my wedding here on aug 29th and the hotel was first class from start to finsh . big thank you to roberto who made sure everyone was on their toes and the wonderfull artur from c+b whom worked so hard for us .. me and ceara have nothing but praise to you all . you should be proud of your great staff and hotel !!!,5,2014,09,02
223,"Very busy, loud, and hot hotel","We stayed here for four nights recently.  The hotel has easy access to the major highways around Dublin, which was great for sightseeing to other areas of Ireland.  The staff was friendly, breakfast hearty, and rooms very clean.  The hotel hosted two weddings over the weekend.  Saturday night the music was so loud I could hear the bass notes from our room which was two floors up and at the other end of the hotel.  Our room was VERY warm, even when using the fan.  We left the window open as much as possible, however drunken wedding guests forced us to close it.  Sleep was difficult, although the bed was comfortable.  The halls and public rooms on the floors were also stuffy.  The lobby doors to the outside stayed open so the warmth is not noticeable until one goes upstairs. I would strongly recommend asking for a room that was not on the front of the building.",3,2014,09,02
223,"Poor quality ""family room"" very friendly helpful staff...",Stayed for a family break which included a family zoo pass. Unfortunately there was a lot of conferences at the hotel at the same time so we had a little wait to be checked in as our room wasn't ready. Our family room wasn't really up to standard as the second double bed was a very small fold down sofa bed which was broken. However the staff were super friendly and tried their best to rectify the situation.,3,2014,08,31
223,Nice family spot just outside the city,"We enjoyed a short break to Dublin and chose to stay just outside the city. The hotel was easily found from the airport and had good amenities, spacious, comfortable rooms, and nice pool area. Drinks and food seemed a little pricey but I think this May be true of Dublin generally. We paid the 9.95?euros for a good breakfast a couple of mornings. There is a bus stop within a 10 min walk from the hotel. Regular buses take you into the city, about half an hour ride. We used this one day around 11 euros for 4 of us one way and drove in and parked on the other days. Parking can be a little expensive but it equated to a similar amount to the bus ride for us. With hindsight it may have been easier to not hire a car and up just pick up a bus from the airport into the city, but we did get to visit some of the surrounding area which was lovely. We used the hop on hop off green buses which were an excellent way to get around the city and learn more from the live commentary bus drivers, who added their own personal and funny twist to the narrative. I would recommend Castleknock hotel to others. It was a pleasant comfortable stay, staff were friendly and helpful. ",4,2014,08,31
223,"Smashing hotel,good food and ambience...","My husband and 11 year old son stayed here for the weekend. I would struggle to find fault with any aspect of the hotel. The receptionist was extremely pleasant, room was spotless. We loved the bar area as it was the perfect way to sit and watch the world go by. Bar food was prompt and very tasty. The staff from the cleaning staff to the bar staff were most friendly and courteous. I loved our stay and would most definately return :-)",5,2014,08,24
223,Will not be back here for lunch!,"Will not be back here for lunch!  We went here for lunch on Thursday and had Fish and Chips and a Steak Sandwich. The portions were tiny! I was shocked by the size since there was nothing small about the price. The fish was nice, but the steak sandwich was edible! That's the best that I can say about it. It came out on bread with onions. And some sauce and chips. Not a piece of salad or rocket or green on the plate. And plain white onions - nothing fancy.
Will not be going back here!",2,2014,08,23
223,Fantastic Service in both the Spa and restuarant,"Checked in on Saturday with two friends. We were early but the triple room was ready.
Had lunch in the Brasserie - 3 salads. Food and and service was really good. There were no seats in the lobby as the hotel was busy with a wedding, but really enjoyed the quieter brasserie for lunch.

The three of us went to the Spa at 4. The treatments and relaxation room were lovely - but the staff were especially attentive and helpful.

We had dinner in the restaurant at 8:30. Again the hotel was busy with a wedding but the restaurant was apart from this. Service from Keith made the meal. Nothing was a problem for him and we could even order off the menu. The food was excellent - in particular the black pudding mash. Would come back for a meal.

Breakfast the next morning was busy, but there was no wait. Again the staff were more than attentive.

Really relaxing weekend all round. Would recommend.",4,2014,08,19
223,Terrible food and bar service,"I joined my family for an 80th birthday party . At 40 euro a head for the meal  it wasn't cheap . From start to finish the meal was dreadful . There were two starters a melon starter and vegetable soup that could only be described as tasteless . This was followed by Turkey and ham that was so salty it was sickening . The vegetables that were served with it were so overcooked they were mush and very bland . There was no improvement on the desert . A small apple pie with a spot of cream lacked of flavour . I was so disappointed as I had looked forward to the meal . I wasn't  the only one to feel this way . I don't know they could get such a simple dinner so wrong .  Many of our party were also left disappointed with their meal . 
I had a right to be sceptical about the breakfast the next morning . The hot food was Luke warm and must have been the cheapest produce that the hotel could source . We had to witness an older staff member berate a young girl on how to carry dishes and we were not asked did we want tea or coffee instead we had to get up and ask another waitress for some . 
We stayed for lunch as some of our party were playing golf . A portion of chips took more than 40 minutes to reach our table . I thought that they were digging the potatoes themselves . The chips were very nice but it was to little to late . I then went to the bar to get a soft drink . I was ignored for 15 minutes before I was eventually served with no apologies . One of our party was served soup with no spoon and she had to walk around looking for staff to get one . 
On the plus side the rooms were very nice and clean and the pool facilities were also . 
I won't be visiting this hotel again . There are much better hotels out there for the price we paid .",2,2014,08,18
223,Disappointed -,"We stayed here only this week. Our experience was mixed?

On arrival we were met at reception by very nice and friendly staff .

We had booked a family room for three nights, B&B, one evening meal included.
At the time of booking this break we were attracted by the fact that there was a Kids Club and also a family pass to the zoo included. I should add we made our booking over the phone.

On arrival we were told that the Kids Club opened on Wednesday , not much use when you arrive on a Monday with two kids looking forward to the Kids Club that evening. We felt a little bit deceived at this stage. 

We expressed our disappointment but we weren't really provided with any real explanation just a friendly smile.

The room while clean, wasn't suitable for a family - A double bed and a sofa pull/out bed equivalent in size to a single bed.

We contacted reception apparently this is a family room????

Apart from that the other features of the room were fine.

After organising a travel cot for the 5yr old we decided to go to the bar for some bar food and a couple of drinks.

From the bar menu we ordered two burgers and from the kids menu we ordered a kids burger and a fish & chip.

Our waiter didn't show any sense of initiative , brought us out the food, we had to ask him for cutlery, sauces etc. The quality of the food was average and could only be described a slight step up from what one might expect from a fast food chain. 

We ordered two cordial drinks for the children, 90cent each - a bit mean I thought.

Whilst one can take or leave based on the price and go somewhere else to eat the more frustrating element was dealing with some staff who were obviously not on top of their game.

Overall I wouldn't recommend this hotel for family's, especially those of us are used to going to various hotels around Ireland on family breaks.",2,2014,08,17
223,Good Overall,Stayed for one night on way to another hotel. Room while comfortable not the best as it overlooked the back of kitchen and yard. There was a constant noise from an extract fan and the movement of bottle bins. Also it was a very warm day and with no air conditioning in the room the fan provided was of little use. We had to leave the window open for air which did not help with the noise. We had dinner in hotel and we tried the a la carte. The food was very good and reasonable with a nice selection of dishes.The waiter was efficient with just the right amount of conversation. So overall the food and the staff made up for the room location.,4,2014,08,17
223,Overall good experience..with one issue:,"Stayed over one night and overall this is a good hotel: On arrival we were upgraded to a suite which was great news and did not disappoint: Reception staff were helpful also: Had dinner in the restaurant and all the staff were attentive (well done to Keith our waiter) food was good and had no complaints: same at breakfast the next morning all good: The main issue I would have with the hotel was the lobby area and entertainment: There was a singer entertaining on the night who was very good, but why oh why have him at the entrance to the hotel: People passing in and out to smoke and to exit and enter the hotel: the guy did not have a chance to create any sort of atmosphere: It would have been better to have the entertainment located further up the lobby otherwise whats the point???? . The rooms and general areas were spotless and as stated earlier overall it was a good experience...but sort out the entertainment the performers could not be getting a chance if the policy of placing them at the main exit continues.",4,2014,08,17
223,"Great for kids, and good restaurant","Really enjoyed staying in this hotel , the kids loved the swimming pool although they are only aloud in the swimming pool to a certain time. They even have a kids club but we didn't get to use this. They have a playground just at the back of the hotel which is perfect because they have the patio area where we could sit and have some drinks while the kids played. We got our dinner inclusive so we went to the brasserie for dinner. Food was delicious but there was a supplement of 6 euro on the steak which was fine. Very efficient staff, waitress called Caroline looked after us very well she was excellent with the kids and was very helpful with the menu, would highly recommend going to the restaurant for food but you should make a booking because the restaurant was very busy. Overall pleseant stay and cant wait to return in the future",5,2014,08,17
223,Castleknock hotel,"The hotel looks good and very clean, since it is a country club is has huge lawns outside and has a 'country' feel.
Hotel staff at the front desk are very helpful and friendly
view from room window can potentially be nice, however my room on the first floor was right above the hotel dumpster area. other than that the room was perfect: spacious, clean, smells nice, comfortable bed, both shower and bathtub in the bathroom and a big desk important for a business trip.
the hotel offers a discount when buying a breakfast coupon a day in advance.
very rich breakfast, includes hot food as well as fruits, cornflakes and patisseries.
the hotel is only 20 minutes drive from the airport, located very near the Phoenix park but is remote from the city center.",4,2014,08,16
223,"Genuinely mixed feelings, lots of positives, but one negative","Large chain country club style hotels would not be a norm for us when in Dublin. We know Dublin well and felt this would be an interesting change for a short stay. We came with two young children.

Initial impression was superb. The reception were, well, receptive. The young woman remembered our call, knew all the details, spoke to our kids, answered our questions and was really friendly. We were delighted. Throughout the stay this was replicated in the other reception staff.

The room was nice and roomy, despite two cots in it. Our view was of a tee box which fascinated my 15 month daughter. Comfy bed, clean and good shower.

The location is dependent on your purpose for being there. We had to visit Dublin city centre and Blanchardstown. The city is actually quite close, if you avoid rushour. However, there is no public transport, so cars or taxis are your only options. Blanchardstown was a nightmare to get to and from. Not a great place to stay if that is where you need to be.

The bars and lobby area and restaurants, which all merge together are large with loads of paneled wood. Even with a good number there, they feel quiet. There's also a quiet bar with no children allowed. There were plenty of kids there at the same time as us and the hotel is set to cater for them. In particular, we availed of the pool, but there is a kids club, etc., too. (Also note, the hotel is close to the zoo which is ideal with children)

Returning to the bar/restaurant, I would like to mention two negatives:
The first is just a quibble. We ate there, but felt the food too expensive for what was distinctly average fare.
The second is more serious. One evening, we were joined by several friends and family from the area for drinks and food. They managed to mess up our orders on 4 rounds of drinks, as well as one food order. Further, they left the empties and plates, piling up at our table for over two hours and had a generlly grumpy demeanour. Not impressed.

One final question: we ordered a children's ham sandwich and received crisps on the plate. Why? Difficult to get a child to focus good food in that situation.

Overall, we were quite happy. My wife thoroughly enjoyed it (she was not present for the evening of the messed orders) and would go back. I would consider it, certainly.",4,2014,08,14
223,Great pool - but can be very busy / noisy,Stayed here for 4 nights at the beginning of August 2014 as a family of 4 in two interconnecting rooms.  Had great fun in the pool - but unfortunately my teenage daughter was unable to use the gym (due to a minimum age restriction).  The food offered as part of our package was of reasonable quality but the choice limited for an extended stay.  We were belatedly informed that The Park Restaurant was adult-only - so unfortunately we couldn't use this.  Having said that - the food for both restaurants appeared to be coming from the same kitchen.  The major issue for us was that we had chosen a very busy weekend (Bank Holiday in Ireland).  Two of the nights had big wedding functions booked and the noise went on into the small hours - clearly audible in the hotel corridors.  Our rooms (203 & 205) were a bit on the small size for a 4-night stay and the lack of air-conditioning made a couple of the nights uncomfortable.,3,2014,08,14
223,"Great hotel, staff were excellent. ","We are only back from castle knock, we stayed very last minute, got a good deal, we arrived and was checked in by a lovely helpful receptionist called Nicola, she informed me that the pool was  been cleaned,but the steam room  was all open crisis averted. They didn't disappoint. 
In the morning we had breakfast the main restaurant 
 was full of kids but thankfully we were seated in the bar area. 
Thank you castle knock for a lovely break from the day to day hustle and bustle of my busy life. 

",5,2014,08,13
223,Great family hotel.,We have just returned from a two night stay at this excellent hotel. We booked a superior room for the Grandparents and interconnecting rooms for our family of 2 adults and 3 children. When booking I explained to the receptionist that this holiday was a treat for my mother in law as it was her birthday. On arrival the staff had left a birthday card and chocolate truffles in her room. This was such a lovely surprise. The rooms were extremely clean and well maintained. Our 2 night package included an evening meal in the Brasserie and this this meal was of an extremely high standard. Some family joined us and there was not one complaint for any of the meals. Monika was are waitress and she was very helpful. Unfortunately we only got to use the pool once as it was closed on the Sunday night and Monday but this couldn't have been helped and the staff couldn't have apologised enough. We did get to use it on departure and the children had a great time. Staff at the desk and on the pool side were lovely. Will certainly be recommending this hotel to family and friends and look forward to returning to this excellent hotel in the future.,5,2014,08,12
223,Just Perfect,"We have just returned home after spending two wonderful days relaxing in the most beautiful accommodation, eating the most wonderful food, playing golf on one of the most aesthetically pleasing courses I have every experienced and 'having the craic' in the Lime Tree (adult only) bar having a few drinks before bedtime. Our bedroom was very tastefully decorated, the bed was massive and very comfortable, we were even able to choose our own pillow type ( duck down, hypoallergenic, anti snoring to name but a few). The En suite was gorgeous, the marble tiles were complemented with contrasting granite surfaces and beautiful mirrors there was a bath and a separate corner shower with a lovely glass door. The bedroom also boasted an iron and ironing board, powerful hair dryer, good sized flat screen TV and tea/coffee making facilities. The leisure centre was very modern and fully equipped the swimming pool was a good size and there was a nice jacuzzi. Every member of staff was welcoming, friendly, efficient, knowledgeable and kind. The food was to 'die for' something for every taste, beautifully presented and perfectly cooked. The attention to detail throughout the hotel was unbelievable for example wherever there was reading material there were also reading glasses at various strengths for the readers convenience! I have nothing negative to say about this hotel as everything was superb and we will definitely be back.",5,2014,08,12
223,Excellent waiter called Keith for dinner,"When we arrived for dinner we where seated and where given the menu as usual, then Keith a very nice guy took or order and made us laugh he was very polite and described everything very well we never had to ask for anything because he was always one step ahead. So thanks a million Keith for making the evening worth while and I would recommend anyone to dine there . Oh and the food was exceptional as well . ",5,2014,08,11
223,The restaurant,"The room itself is lovely presented well. The staff are very nice .The waiter we had was called Keith , He was a lovely person helped us out with the menu was lovely to speak to and had a laugh with us which was good .",5,2014,08,11
223,2 days of rest and relaxation in beautiful surroundings - so impressed by the little things!,"I was surprised with a weekend stay last weekend to Castleknock and having never heard of it I didnt know what to expect.
There was an intangible good vibe from the second we stepped up the red carpet (not for us but a due to arrive bride and groom!) into the large lobby with a beautiful seating area etc.
A friendly greeting from reception and a non existent wait for the lift and we found ourselves in our room.
Bright, clean, usual features of tea/coffee, spotless bathroom and massive bed!  Unfortunately our view was of the car park which led to some noise when the wedding guests were making their way home (this along with the steam room being out of order and a vacant bar on friday night are the only things i can find fault with.)
We had bar food on friday night in the hotel and made the most of the outside patio area, and break in the rain!  Soaked up some sun and the food was yummy.  We then went inside to what felt like a jazz bar but there were no bar staff behind the bar, although once a waitress had seen us she kept the drinks coming from the main bar.
Breakfast was delicious and offered all that one would expect with fresh fruit etc as well as cooked breakfast options.  on the second morning we were invited into the restaurant part of the breakfast area away from the buffet and it was a bit nicer, but no real complaints.
We spent some time in the pool which was a little deep for me as im quite short (not the hotels fault) but the jacuzzi and sauna were lovely although unfortunately the steam room was out of order.
on our last day we treated ourselves to some spa treatments.  I opted for a shelac manicure and my partner had a back massage.  No complaints from him and Shona who looked after me was an absolute star, so pleasant and friendly.
We bid a sad farewell yesterday and made the journey home with promises of a return visit soon.
I was just so impressed with the little things the hotel had thought of, I loved the special little drinks available for children at breakfast, the reading glasses available for people who forgot theirs, all the info on things to see and do was so readily available, wi fi was great, staff were all really lovely and I would love to come back with my son and use the kiddies park and kids club which were available.  Housekeeping staff left room immaculate after each visit.  the vending machines which provided the unfortunate option of snacks! lol 
All in all a wonderful visit.",4,2014,08,11
223,Nice Hotel,"Stayed here for one night as a family trip to Dublin. We were very impressed with the hotels facilities such as the swimming pool, golf course and free wifi. The room was clean and modern. I gave it 4 stars as I did find the breakfast to be very poor. ",4,2014,08,10
223,Lovely Hotel with excellent staff,"This is a great hotel and the service from the staff was second to none.  They were always very busy but still managed to be friendly and helpful.  It was highlighted that if you choose to eat breakfast between 9 and 10 there would be a queue and indeed there was but despite how busy it was staff managed to smile which is refreshing as I have stayed in other great hotels with unhelpful staff and it is annoying!

The only negative was the shower head could have been cleaned better.

I would definitely stay again.  There was also a kids club in the evening which we didn't use this time but might if we go back!",4,2014,08,09
223,Family break,"No complaints at all, staff all very professional and very friendly, the hotel was was brilliant,the grounds outstanding, food excellent, visited the golf course as well, the pro was very nice. Course was excellent, Can't wait to go back had a brilliant relaxing 4days, thankyou castleknock.

Paul Linda and wee Joel.",5,2014,08,06
223,Good,No complaints here.... Lively... Good golf... Patient staff and lovely tonic spa... Perhaps better selection on  menu in restaurant but overall good and I will hopefully use again and would recommend to friends...,4,2014,08,05
223,Wedding Bliss,"We stayed at the Castleknock to attend a friends wedding and stayed for 2 nights.  The hotel and grounds are amazing, the staff are very professional and efficient.  My husband lost his jacket - well left it in the wedding reception function room.  The next day the housekeeping and front of house staff went above and beyond to try to locate the jacket for him.  The food was wonderful and the spa is just out of this world.  It is a little pricey, however, if you are looking for 5* treatment then this is the place to go.",5,2014,08,05
223,Bad business,Booked 15 double rooms in this hotel for golf society captains day outing last feburary.The rooms were costing 186 euro each this was for b+b and evening meal not a bad deal you would think.when we rang last week to finalise datails they informed us they had no record of the bookings which we had made by e mail.To cut a long story short they said they still had 15 rooms available but at a cost of 256 euro for the same deal we booked in feburary at 186 euro. Rip off merchants or what.so not only did they miss out on 15 double rooms been booked we would have had 30 thirsty golfers drinking in bar all night.They must not need the money in castleknock.,1,2014,08,04
223,nice but expected more,"my self and my wife stayed on a one night deal ,B+B and an evening meal midweek.
check in at 3pm ,staff was helpful and pleasant,we had a double room which was really nice and modern.Headed to the leisure centre,Were given towels and you only need a one euro coin for the lockers,caps were three euro,were a little disappointed by the over all size of this facility due to the size of the hotel,changing rooms were small and the swimming pool was tiny,looked bigger on their website,was busy with kids and their was no swimming lane,so was impossible to do lengths,Jacuzzi was built for no more than four,even then you found yourself touching others legs.
Had our meal in the Brasserie Restaurant,really nice spot with views of the golf course,food was really good,just could have been more of it,were only given one slice of bread each ,had to ask for more and we had the steak for main which was gorgeous but sadly was only accompanied by one potato and some tomatoes,more veg and potato would have been nice,especially after having to pay an extra six euro each supplement for the steak,desserts were just ok,best part of the dinning experience was the nice staff.
found the bar very nice and relaxing but their prices a little high.
now for me the Breakfast was the major let down,all else could have been forgiven,waited in a queue to be seated which is fine,no problem with that as it was busy.when we were seated i was very disappointed as we were put in a small area outside of the main restaurant,which i could only describe as being a very badly run cafe,our table was on top of the food area with people bumping past you,not their fault ,area was too small.Had the full Irish breakfast which wasnt great,really dried out and not of great quality for a four star,didn't even have a full Irish really as some of the food trays were empty,when we eventually got tea and coffee after asking for it we still had to wait another five mins for the milk,what a joke and then you had to make your own toast which was another queue,it was positioned in the corner almost on top of people trying to eat,just wanted to leave ,was the worst experience for breakfast we ever had in a hotel,would but us off booking here again.",3,2014,08,04
223,Overpriced and overrated,"Stayed here for a family wedding in July 31st while the room was ok (only 2 teabags left in room) the breakfast was very poor the bar price r a joke and there is no kid's menu in the bar. The bar food menu is overpriced and the selection not great, service in the bar leaves a lot to b desired I wud stay again but I really think prices, bar services, menus and breakfast should be reviewed!",3,2014,08,02
223,Does What It Says.........,"Attended a family party here and had a private dining room with a buffet service meal which was piping hot with generous portions. The drinks service was a little slow and by the end of the evening the 'hidden' bar was exposed and we were able to go the bar ourselves which was much better.
There was no pressure for us to leave the venue and we were even welcome to use the residents bar till the early hours and when we ordered a taxi from reception and they told us 5 mins it was there in 4!!",4,2014,08,02
223,Nice hotel,"Stayed here for 3 nights with my husband, 7 month old & 12 year old niece in an adjoining room.  We booked a package of 3 nights B&B, 1 dinner & 1 spa treatment.  
Food:
We had dinner in the hotel on the first time and it was lovely.  Shame the same cant be said for the breakfast.  Thought the breakfast was rather bland.  You have to pay extra for an omelette & pancakes (‚Ç¨4 supplement).  My husband ordered an omelette and said it was very good.  My niece had a burger in the bar off the children's menu and said it was the best burger she ever had.  The price of drinks (‚Ç¨7.50 for a glass of wine) was eye watering but I guess that's Dublin.  
Room:
Big bed but I found it rather uncomfortable.  The toiletries were very basic.  There was no air con in the room and we happened to be staying during a heat wave.  We couldn't open the windows because our room was right over the employees smoking area.  
Leisure Facilities:
The pool was nice but very crowded.  You couldn't do laps in the pool with so many children in it.  I had a treatment in the spa (a back massage) and it was excellent.  
Child Facilities:
There is a small playground and a kids club in the hotel.  Was of no use to us.  What I couldn't get over was with the amount of children & babies staying that there was no facilities for a baby.  Having stayed in other hotels that had bottle sterilisers & fridges available, the lack of these here was a huge drawback for us.  I had to sterilise the baby bottles in microwave bags and get the waiters to do it for us at breakfast.  Thankfully they couldn't have been nicer.  The waiter did hold the baby food in the bar fridge for us.  For these reasons I probably wouldn't stay here again with a baby but would return when she is older.",4,2014,08,01
223,Just about three star,"If you don‚Äôt expect too much from this hotel, you won‚Äôt be disappointed.  On arrival, there appeared to be some kind of event going on, possibly a wedding?  There was quite a number of people congregated at the entrance, smoking, which didn‚Äôt give a great first impression.  There were a couple of tacky flame effect lights outside along with two cheap looking ‚Äúchiminees‚Äù, presumably to keep the smokers warm.  These really spoil an otherwise nice approach to the hotel. 

We sat in the main open foyer/lounge area.  The furnishings here are hit and miss‚Ä¶ fake leather sofas with cheap scatter cushions that have seen many better days.  Some of the furnishings were not conducive to casual dining (tables too low, seats too ‚Äúreclined‚Äù).  It would appear that a designer might have originally designed this area but that hotel management has been trying to maintain it on a meagre budget‚Ä¶ needs a professional touch!

Staff attention was hard to get but, eventually, we ordered from the bar food menu.  Two of our party ordered the fish and chips but the portion size was tiny ‚Äì it appeared that they might have been running out of fish and possibly split one normal portion into two(?).  We asked the waiter if this was the usual portion size but he didn‚Äôt know and said the kitchen was now closed so he couldn‚Äôt do anything!   Around ‚Ç¨14 seemed an okay price at first, but not for what we got.  When you‚Äôre still hungry, the local chipper would be a better bet‚Ä¶  Coffee was not good and at around ‚Ç¨3.75 it should certainly taste better.

The health club area has a nice atmosphere.  Small gym which was good as it was not packed.  Good equipment, if a bit limited (not much in the weights area).  Headphones for TV would be good (currently two silent TVs with piped music).  Pool was good, if a bit on the cold side.  However, the men‚Äôs changing area needs attention.  Mildew in the showers, very few lockers with wristbands for keys - just neglect, it seems.  

Pros: Location.  Cons: Lack of attention to detail.  Overall, definitely not the four star level they‚Äôre trying to claim.  More management supervision and more professionalism required.",3,2014,07,30
223,"Nice hotel, good food, Small rooms, no aircon","We booked a 3 night break with our 2 young children. The deal was for 3 nights including 3 breakfasts, 1 dinner and a trip to the zoo. The hotel is lovely inside, the bars and restaurants are excellent. The food in the main restaurant was excellent and we really enjoyed our meal. It's worth noting that the kids portions are huge.....the negatives are the following....1. We were given a ""family room"" however the room was very small and not suitable for 4 people. The kids had to sleep on a sofa bed which was very small and uncomfortable. I called up about this and was advised that all family rooms are the same....basically it's a slightly small double room with a small sofa bed....not a family room. 2. The hotel is very hot inside and there is no aircon in the rooms. This made for some sleepless nights. 3. There was no mini bar / mini fridge so no way of keeping drinks cool. 4. The deal was for 1 dinner...we presumed the dinner would be for everyone but on reading the small print after querying the bill...the dinner was only for 2 adults and didn't include the kids food. This should be made clearer.

Overall, the place is lovely and with a few minor improvements would be a 5/5",3,2014,07,24
223,Comfy Hotel,"Great hotel, location very good located close to the M50 motorway and Blanchardstown shopping centre. Rooms were very clean and modern ,with very comfortable beds,tea and coffee making facilities. The reception area, bar and restaurant was large and open plan, plenty of room and staff even with weddings taking place. Breakfast was awesome! Great variety of continental and full Irish. Swimming pool and sauna was clean and modern with staff at hand. All in all Staff were friendly and helpfully, would definitely recommend to anyone looking to sty close to the Dublin area.",5,2014,07,24
223,Ticked the right boxes,"For guests coming from the North, this was the ideal location - straight down the M1, on to the M50 and bob,s your uncle. This hotel has the ideal location in relation to lying in a rural setting yet only ten minutes from the city centre. The proximity to Blanchardstown shopping centre is like manna from heaven for all those shoppers, especially when the husband forgets to put your case in the boot! An ideal excuse to visit the shops. We had booked a show at Bord Gais for the Friday night and it was so convenient to drive in to town or to avail of the bus or train which is located close by.

On arrival I found the reception staff to be quite un engaged. Certainly not as engaged or helpful as the staff taking bookings by phone.
The bedroom was comfortable and well resourced but lacked something in relation to to being rated as an executive king size room. It was the same size as any other room and although I asked for a quiet room as proposed, there was a high level of noise all night from what I think was a generator in the garden area.

The breakfast was lovely especially on the Saturday morning. The porridge was perfect. On Sunday it was less perfect and on Monday it was not perfect. Too thin! I assume it was three different chefs? The overall standard of food was good though and we ate in the bar restaurant and In the main restaurant. The restaurant staff were very attentive and keen to please. They deserve great credit. We also found housekeeping staff to be helpful and friendly.
We also liked the fact that there were various different bars for different events. There was plenty of space for children to run around both inside and out which included a small playground. The latter was not well resourced but was better than nothing.
Overall a positive experience and we would stay there again.",4,2014,07,22
223,Overall a very poor experience,"Our family arrived on the 17th July for a 3 day stay.  It was 3.15 pm before we got into our rooms as they were not ready, we were not happy with this as two of our children needed to get into the rooms for a rest before returning to the finals of a swimming competition.  we were reminded by the reception staff that check-in was not until 3.00 pm.
That night we ordered drinks from one of the waiters, after 25 minutes the drinks had not arrived and we had to go to the bar to get the drinks ourselves.  Later on we ordered food and as the food arrived we ordered food.  We had the food all eaten and the drinks never arrived, despite numerous reminders.  The drinks finally arrived after the food was finished.
On Saturday my nine year old son went up to the bar for some crisps,  he arrived back to us and said the three adults were served before him and just let as no bar staff was interested in serving him.  I went to speak to the bar manager and all he said was ""right, right, right"".
I then spoke to the duty manager and explained what had happened and how it was dealt with by the bar manager.  He said that it should not have happened and that he would speak to the staff.  I told him that the service we had received from arriving was poor to say the least.  I explained in detail our experiences and again he reminded me that check-in was not until 3.00pm.
On our departure we informed the receptionist of our poor experience and she just said that management was aware of the matter and that was how it was left.

The management were not interested in try to deal with our compliant, either had not got the experience or customer service is not a priority for the hotel.

Overall we will not return to this hotel and would not recommend it",2,2014,07,21
223,Country charm with city sophistication ,"This hotel is a wonderful surprise in the suburb of Castleknock, Dublin.  It's nestled outside the busy village on a quiet country road but very close to great shopping area in the nearby Blanchardstown shopping center.  There is a stunning. golf course on site (managed by a different company), and also a fabulous indoor swimming pool, gym & spa, run by the hotel.  Staff are all very friendly & helpful especially the housekeeping staff who are so thoughtful & responded to any request extremely fast. Rooms are spotless & the hotel lobby area is a relaxing place to sit, have a snack or enjoy current sporting events on the flat screen TVs which are tastefully dotted along one side.  Breakfast is buffet style and the sausages are the best according to the youngest member of our family.  We visit this hotel every time we are in Ireland and would highly recommend it.  There is a local bus service outside the hotel but rental car necessary really for this property.

223,Family break,"Stayed here on 13th july for 2 nights, lovely hotel and friendly staff.  Downside was price , noise and heat.  Room was small for family of 4 and not 4 star standard, have stayed in better 3 stars and alot cheaper.  Breakfast standard .  Rooms noisy and hotel very busy and noisy not somewhere I would return with the kids.",3,2014,07,16
223,Lovely stay but don't order food!,"I stayed here for 2 nights with my mother and my sister. We were on a spa break. The hotel is lovely, looks very nice, big, spacious and modern when you walk in and the reception staff and welcoming, friendly and efficient. The rooms are lovely again standard enough 4 star hotel had all the usual bits and bobs, clean and comfortable, no complains at all little bonus is the proper sizes mugs in the room instead of the silly tiny tea cup and saucer ones you usually get! The room was very very very hot, I don't know if there was heating on or if it was just the very humid weather outside but none of us slept the first night it was so hot. the second night we got a fan from reception and sheets instead of duvets from housekeeping and everyone slept much better. 

We ate from the bar menu on the first night and oh dear it took so so long. We waited nearly 50 minutes for the chicken wing starters after ordering them. The waiter apologies and we received a complimentary drink. He said there was a mix up in the kitchen, this was fine. When they did come out they were lovely very tasty, it was just a shame about the delay. thankfully we were relaxed and laid back because they then tried to take the wings off us asking if we were finished despite the fact we were clearly still eating them! We ended up putting all the wings into one bowl because he really really seemed to want to take some dishes off us! When we did finish our mains came out very quickly so I imagine these were ready and that is why he was so eager to take the wings off us! Main dish was lovely no complains. The next morning we went for the buffet breakfast, I wouldn't eat a big breakfast so I ordered two poached eggs (which are on offer on the menu) the girls just got the full buffet breakfasts. 30 minutes later.... no eggs!! So again said it to them and the eggs finally came out but everyone else had finished theirs so it wasn't the nicest experience again we said nothing and moved on. That afternoon we went down the spa and it was just lovely, the relaxation room was warm, dark, candle lit with fresh fruit, herbal tea, water, juice etc... big beds with fully towels and slippers etc. The treatments were also fab, really enjoyed them and again the relaxation room after again. We also went to the pool, Jacuzzi, steam room, sauna in the leisure centre after again everything was perfect. Lunch was included as part of our spa package so we went up stairs to ""try"" and get some lunch after. The package included soup and a sandwich so after waiting 15 minutes in a quite bar for a waiter we all ordered the soup and were told to order any sandwich of the menu or whatever we wanted, we all ordered different sandwiches (a Ham and Chicken, a Ham and Cheese, and a ploughmans). We asked for the prosecco, soup and sandwiches and a jug of water to come down together. The prosecco came first which was lovely. The soup followed surprising quickly but with no plate under the soup bowl and no side plate for the bread rolls, we had to butter them on a napkin! Half way through the soup we were told by the waiter to give the go ahead when we wanted the sandwiches to be made up! At this stage we only had to laugh as the ""any sandwich on the menu or whatever you wanted"" turned out to all be Ham, Cheese and Onion!! We didn't know to laugh or cry and the waiter which may I add seemed like a lovely lad maybe just thrown in to the job or not trained I don't know asked did he get everything right, we didn't have the heart to tell him no so just told him everything was lovely to which he seem relieved. Again the sandwiches were lovely but that was now 3 out of 3 times breakfast, lunch and dinner there was a huge delay and or mix up in the kitchen. 

So overall lovely stay, hotel and spa really really nice and will def return again but I wouldn't order as much as a coffee there!!!",4,2014,07,16
223,a night away,"we were meeting a few friends in the hotel and decided to stay over which was easy to book a few hours before, there are 2 resturants and bar food which we decided to go for as it was very busy in the resturants. We had a few drinks before in the bar and it was busy with a wedding and various parties but the service was still good, we found a nice couch area the bar food menu had a good choice and service was quick and food was good and even though the staff were rushed of there feet our waitress was very friendly as were all staff .
There was live music but couldnt really hear as so busy in bar, unfortunately it was  raining and we couldnt use the terrace seating area which looked very nice. Fair play to Paul in the residence bar for keeping us topped up with our Sambuca as it got really busy later on
The hotel upgraded us with our room which was good as it was very busy on the night, we found it nice and quiet, the bed was huge and had a choice of different pillows which were lovely. All n all our room was very clean and comfortable but because we were only staying one night we didnt get to appreciate it. Himself had great intention to get up before breakfast and have a swim but the residence bar the night before put a big stop to it.
We stayed there 2 years ago in between moving house and the hotel and staff then and now were very freindly and professional. we must make a return visit so himself can have a swim and i will get to the spa.",4,2014,07,11
223,"Lovely hotel, nice staff but very noisy","We stayed here for 4 nights recently and had a great time.  had 2 adjoining rooms, very clean and plenty big.  All the staff were very nice and helpful (although everything at the front desk did seem to take an age to do) the food was fantastic, the pool and play ground went down very well with the kids too.  the only down side was on the last night when a wedding was on and the noise levels were almost unbearable.  so if staying here ask for a room on the top floor towards the back.",4,2014,07,11
223,Sleepless 7 night stay!,"As my title states, I had a 7 night stay with little or no sleep. The hotel noise level was quite high & two weddings at either end of the week did not help this. As the wedding guests made their way back to their rooms in the early hours, I was treated to several hours of doors slamming, loud conversations in the corridor and other interruptions that made a good sleep very difficult. Also, this hotel offers family deals so there can be a lot of screaming children in corridors and in the open/bar area through out the day. There is little or no variation in the bar food menu also and going elsewhere means a car journey or long walk. The location of the hotel is good, but they need to really think about better sound proofing or ensuring that guests who have early starts are kept in a different area to wedding and leisure break guests.",2,2014,07,10
223,Tonic Health & Day Spa ‚Äì Great Afternoon Relaxing!,"We visited Tonic Health & Day Spa a few weeks ago for one of their spa packages. The entrance to the Spa and leisure facilities are in the main reception area. Which was a little off putting, however once you pass by the leisure facilities and enter the relaxation room you are in a different zone, its peaceful and so calm in here with lovely lighting creating the perfect atmosphere.
My sister had the hot stone massage and a facial; I had a facial and a massage, due the booking only that morning, they could not accommodate the two of us at the same time, so one of us spent time in the relaxation room whilst the other had her treatments which were amazing, the young lady was a really great therapist.",5,2014,07,08
223,An absolute gem,"We stayed here last July for our second wedding anniversary and we came back again this year for our third anniversary. We booked the ""suite treat"" package and it's worth every penny. Everything from check-in, to dinner in The Park Restaurant, to the bar staff was absolutely excellent. Have to give a special mention to Caroline and Keith in the restaurant, they were a pleasure. Our suite was fab, overlooking the golf course. A bottle of prosecco and chocolates in the room along with a ""Happy Anniversary"" card. Nice touch!! Oh, I was also definitely recommend a Strawberry Daiquiri cocktail in the bar, delicious!!",5,2014,07,08
223,Faultless,I stayed at this place for 3 nights with the family zoo pass package.... Everything from check in to check out was fabulous. Rooms were fine and beds comfortable. Breakfast was great. Had everything a breakfast should have. Food in restaurant was nice also especially the chicken wing starter. Can't fault the staff at all. The young waitresses are a credit to this place. They gave the impression that nothing was too much bother and always smiled and said hello... I'd definitely stay here again and can't wait to do so.,5,2014,07,06
223,Very nice stay,"very nice and clean and pleasant.  Seemed a bit short staffed at the bar/ light eating area.  Pool was beautiful but closed at 730 and you were not allowed in the pool without a bathing cap, which they sold for 3 euro in the spa shop! 
If you leave early as we did, be sure they open the outer doors for you...we had to go back to the front desk and find the desk man to come unlock the doors for us,",5,2014,07,06
223,Sleepless in Castleknock,Writing this at one fifteen am. Exhausted but no sleep because of noise from wedding down below. Sounds like they are really rocking to Oasis. Shut window but now room roasting and bass thumping through floor. At least kids so tired they are sleeping through. Never staying here again lesson learned.,2,2014,07,04
223,Good hotel  but sometimes let's itself down,"I have stayed at this hotel several times before - it is a good location for Dublin or airport (by car) and has very pleasant grounds, spa and public areas. Rooms are pretty good but no heat control or air con, so can be an issue depending on weather. 
It seems to do frequent wedding and family breaks trade so be prepared for lots of children and late night noise especially at weekends. Stayed last weekend and the music from the wedding on Friday went on until after 2.00am. Despite asking for a room away from the wedding function room we found ourselves above the function room- noise levels totally unacceptable I'm afraid and really ruined our stay. 
When asked if we enjoyed our stay on checking out we did point the noise issue to no effect. I think I paid 160euro for the night in question and I would have got more sleep in my car! Would have to think hard before staying here again.",3,2014,06,30
223,Absolutely Fabulous!,"I booked the Castleknock Hotel for a 4 day business meeting earlier this month for 25 people. What a fantastic find! Beautiful scenery, lovely light and airy rooms, efficient friendly staff - nothing was too much trouble. The food was superb and the facilities were excellent. I have rarely stayed anywhere without having at least one minor problem but this was an incident-free, stress-free event thanks to the wonderful staff. Well done, I would not hesitate to use this hotel again either for business or my own personal use.",5,2014,06,30
223,The bad outweigh the good,"This is not my first time to stay at this hotel. Let me stay this,beautiful grounds and close enough to the city. Be careful staying there at the weekend because it is a wedding hotel. Knowing this we asked for a room away from the ballroom and were told we had it, not so we were right on top of it. The beat of the disco went on until well past 2 AM. There is no air conditioning in the rooms.......how can that be? So you cannot regulate the temp. No Flat sheets on the beds so when it is too hot your choice is sleep without the comforter. In June the heat was still being pumped up into the bathrooms via the floor. The showers are not more that 3 square feet in size. In our room the shower head needed to be fixed and the shower drain was not draining properly. Lot of kids and i mean lots of kids, running up and down the corridors when we were there making noise left by their parents to fend for themselves while they at the bar/wedding nonetheless a pain in the neck for other guests. 9 euros for Irish Breakfast if you book it with the desk the night /day before.  16.95 euros if you fail to do so and want it that morning. That seems a little harsh? With regards to price which was all over the place this hotel is not great value. The have become very complacent ,living off wedding traffic at the expense of ordinary leisure travelers.",2,2014,06,28
223,Lovely visit - last night in Ireland,"We booked Castleknock the morning of our stay, as we wanted to be close to the airport for our departure the next morning.  We had previously stayed at a sister hotel (Faithlegg) and loved it.  The grounds and hotel at Castleknock are modern and beautiful.  The room was perfect as we had lots of room for repacking all our suitcases in preparation for our trip.  The beds were about the best in Ireland lovely bathroom!  We had a dinner B&B package - the website said not available, but by calling we were able to book it.  It was very reasonable and made our last night in Ireland very relaxing.  Staff were very accommodating.  There was a mixup in the dining room with one of our main courses - but the staff were exceptionally apologetic and comped a glass of wine.",5,2014,06,25
223,"Excellent Hotel , Made to feel very welcome","My Wife and I stayed here for 5 Nights , Wednesday through to Monday .

We arrived extremly early for check in but this was not a problem for the excellent staff at the front desk to deal with , we had a little look around ( A couple of pints of Guinness) and in no time our room was ready. The lady at the front desk could not be more helpful and even advised us on taking a room to the back of the hotel as this would be a little bit quieter as the hotel was in for a busy weekend.  I mentioned just in a passing comment that it was my Birthday and our Wedding anniversary while we were staying at the hotel , a lovely little touch of a birthday card and some chocolates and an Anniversary card and some chocolates were sent up to our room on the above mentioned days.  Thank you little touches make the difference.

I was expecting my room to be nice because we had stayed here 3 years prior to this visit and knew what to expect.  Lovely room but attention to detail needed , marks on walls , burnt wall socket , toilet in need of some TLC , all 5 minute jobs which would have made my overall rating a five star if sorted.  Our room even though lovely and quiet was overlooking the Bins and recycling area , all of this could have been easily hid away by errecting shed which is a shame because it was a bit of a mess!!!. 

The room was cleaned everday to a very high standard and was always done whilst we were out seeing the sights , Thank you.

We ate in the hotel a couple of times and the food was always good and reasonable pricing too,  Great pint of Guinness and lovely craft beer on offer, try them all.

The Irish staff in the restuarant were brilliant , the Eastern European not so much , which again is a shame because they totally let the side down

Used the Gym which is a great facitlity, 

Overall we had a great Holiday in the Castleknock hotel , its just a shame that a few wee bits and pieces let it down .

Thanks again to all the staff , you made us feel very welcome",4,2014,06,24
223,Elegant hotel in a great location,"Just outside the city of Dublin, this elegant hotel is perfectly situated to make your way around the small country of Ireland while offering a great selection of amenities and comforts. From here, we visited the city, traveled to several nearby castles, visited the middle and south country, and drove to Blarney, and all were within a few hour's drive.

The hotel itself is luxurious and comfortable; if you're looking for the classic Ireland countryside charm, then this is not the place for you. This is not a simple B&B, it has no thatched roofing, nor is it a renovated medieval castle. This hotel is modern and stylish. It has a great bar and restaurant with a wonderful and inviting atmosphere, and the grounds are perfectly manicured and taken care of. The room was comfortable and offered a great view of the grounds.

I would definitely stay here again in the future!",4,2014,06,23
223,Definitely a hotel for families,"Stayed here while we visited the Bloom festival. Very family friendly, but as it was the June bank holiday weekend in Ireland, the hotel was jammed. Getting seating for food on the Sunday night was tricky, and the service was sketchy at best - he who shouts loudest, wins! The best of the staff were Eastern European, unsurprisingly. 

The food was good though, and the rooms (adjoining rooms, so the kids slept next door to us) were clean and modern.

Swimming pool was perfect; the only small gripe being that kids get kicked out at 6pm, which is a little early, we thought.

Overall, a hotel we'd go back to and recommend to others.",4,2014,06,21
223,Hmm.,"Stayed here for 2 nights as part of a work trip. It was very warm outside, and there was no air conditioning, however at least there was a fan in the room. I wanted to open the window to let some air in, but having been given a room at the back of the hotel the room looked straight over the goat roof of the bar/kitchen and the extractor vents were about 20ft from the window. Ok while I wasn't in the room, but too noisy when I was. 
Also, there was a heated floor in the bathroom but no way to turn it off (that I could find, anyway), which was a little much in June. 
Reception were very helpful, and staff were pleasant although bar service was slow. General condition of the hotel was good - clean room, pleasant public spaces. 
Too far from the centre of Dublin to be convenient for getting in and out if you wanted to go out for dinner without your own transport. ",3,2014,06,21
223,Excellent standard accommodation,"On arrival allocated double room designed for wheelchair access. Changed on request to standard room no hassle. Good leisure facilities with pool, sauna etc. nice spacious reception area. Overall happy with stay. Buffet breakfast very tasty.",4,2014,06,18
223,"1 night dinner, bed & breakfast deal.","Stayed here recently on 1 night dinner bed & breakfast deal.  There was 3 of us so we booked a triple room.  The room was clean & well sized.  No refrigerator which we didn't find a issue.  We had booked appointments in the spa.  The pool & spa area is lovely, the pool was very popular with families, there seemed to be a lot of families staying that weekend.  The staff in the spa where very accommodating & friendly.  We had pre booked out dinner reservation, when we arrived down for the meal at the booked time we had a 10min wait, the Maitre'd gave us a complimentary glass of champagne while we waited which was nice. The food was good & value for money.  After the meal we sat in the out door seating area which is very pleasant.  Overall we had a pleasant stay,  would recommend, families would love the pool & they also have a play area for kids outside.",4,2014,06,17
223,Deiseclan,"Myself,husband and two children stayed in a family room for a night. The room was positioned over large outdoor fans which whirred loudly until midnight and recommenced the following morning at 7am.we were unable to open a window even though it was very hot and stuffy in the room and no Ac present. On checkout the lady asked my husband was everything alright during our stay..to which he informed her of the noise and difficulty sleeping especially for our young children. She commented this problem was an ongoing issue with the room!! It left a tainted memory of an otherwise lovely hotel to which unfortunately we will not be returning to.",3,2014,06,12
223,Excellent hotel but...,I checked into this hotel with my family on a family 3 night break and it was a brillant hotel with excellent service/ location/ facilities. But there are a few things which could be added to make the experience even better. I'm an insulin dependent diabetic that regularly injects themselves but the room lacked any sort of fridge so I had to go to great lengths to try to keep my insulin cold. Another thing is my 12 month old son has allergies to diary and so takes alpro soya milk which we had to buy on a regular basis as the restaurant did not have any and we couldn't keep the milk in the room with lack of refrigeration. ,4,2014,06,11
223,From a non golfer,"When I saw I had been put into a hotel next to a golf course I did wonder - but no problem, it seems to have a wider clientele than just old guys with the hats and bright trousers. Huge room equipped with everything I needed. A wedding was going on - is there any hotel these days which isnt hosting a wedding every saturday night - but the music ended promptly at midnight. Forgot to arrange an early morning call and slept in until 9 am in total silence - gigantic comfy bed had a lot to do with this. Every member of staff smiling and charming, everything polished and clean, great lifts, fast ones. I ate two breakfasts here and you could eat every day for a week without exhausting the options on their menu or out on the fruit, hot and cold buffet areas. I'd definitely come here again even if i had to pay for it myself‚Ä¶. which, lucky me, I didnt on this visit. Lucky enough to eat here on the first night too, delicious. Much busier on the saturday than on the Sunday night, fair enough, plenty of staff in the bars and a glass of bubbly to make up for having to wait for our table.",5,2014,06,10
223,Fantastic experience,"We had our wedding in Castleknock hotel on the 10th May 2014 and it was the best day of our life.
 All started when we had to choose the venue for our wedding and in Castleknock we met Siobhan  which got our attention and was so helpful and nice to us, literally she convinced us to have our wedding there just by using her own charm.
 Then, as we were approaching the big day, we were introduced to Sinead Codd, which made it all possible for us. She helped us so much every time we had to go and discuss about the menu or everything we wanted to change regarding the wedding room, from colors, drinks, arrangements to even raise the bridal table on a stand. Everything was fantastic, on the big day we couldn't be happier, Arthur was looking after the service and he did a real good job.
 After that we spent 3 nights in a lovely suite in their hotel, everything was clean and the room was so beautiful decorated, and more than all it was very quiet, exactly what we needed after such an important event.
 I must say that we are not easy to be pleased, but the Castleknock team made our dream come true. We even had people at our wedding saying that this is the wedding of the year!
 So well done to you guys!
 I'm recommending this hotel to everyone !",5,2014,06,05
223,Lovely afternoon tea experience,"I had a voucher for this hotel so decided to use it for afternoon tea. At ‚Ç¨14.95 per person I felt it was good value for what you get and the food was freshly prepared and plentiful. There was a fair selection of sandwiches and plenty of desserts and cakes, so much so that we struggled to eat them all! They were delicious. The staff were very attentive and ensured we were being looked after with fresh tea etc. This was despite the fact that it was very busy with confirmations and conferences at the time. I was really impressed and will definitely return again with friends for a treat!",5,2014,06,04
223,Very disappointing,"Could not have been more disappointed with the standard at this hotel. While everything looks good from the outside, the service was not as it should have been and the room was extremely average.

Upon arrival I went straight to the bar to get something to eat to keep myself going until dinner. After sitting at one of the tables, I eventually had to get up and order at the bar as nobody was coming to take my order. I ordered the soup as I wanted something fast and cheap. After waiting at least ten minutes, I asked the bar man if my order had been forgotten about (it was just the soup of the day after all!). He was very apologetic and was kind enough to discount the soup off the bill. Sadly, this tardiness and lack of attention was only a sign of the overall poor service of the staff.
We stayed in one of their suites and while it was very spacious, one of the two tv's didn't work and the other tv was too small, old and cheap and the remote didn't work. Also the phone was broken, there was no hair-dryer and the back of the bathroom door was completely worn and scratched. There was also a ""pillow menu"" which I'm sure the hotel prides itself on as one of their perks but sadly there was only one kind of pillow available - the Japanese buckwheat pillow - which was awful in my opinion!
The restaurant was under construction at the time of our visit so we dined in a conference room with a 20% discount for the inconvenience. While I'm happy to say that the food was of an excellent standard, the staff's attentiveness was dreadful and certainly didn't match the menu prices. We certainly wouldn't have eaten there only for the discount and I would most definitely not go back.
While the quality of the dinner was excellent, the same can't be said for their breakfast buffet. The sausages, rashers and black pudding were the cheapest crap you'd find in the supermarket. Incredibly disappointing. There were three or four additional menu options but I believe these were extra(!) and personally not that inviting.
The leisure facilities were probably the one area of the hotel where I have little real criticism of. Their facilities were excellent and clean. However, it seemed that people tended to leave their water cups lying around the steam room which the staff seemed slow to clean up and also their bathroom facilities were cheap and tired. Something I admit the hotel has little control over but I feel nevertheless merits mention is that I shared the changing room with two ""gentlemen"" who were discussing how their friend's Audi R8 had been repossessed and how one of them had to pay a fine of ‚Ç¨50 for ""scrapping with that copper"". Charming.

Overall I was very disappointed with our stay. While our room was comfortable and everyone was very friendly, the attentiveness of staff was woeful. This is not a high end luxury hotel as their website and more importantly, their prices suggest. It's average... incredibly average.",2,2014,06,03
223,Fantastic trip,Stayed here on a trip with work. Arrived on Sunday morning and despite the hotel being busy due to One Direction being in town our room was ready. The twin room was lovely with plenty of room for 2 girls stuff. The staff on reception were really helpful and gave us a little map to point us in the right direction to get a bus into Dublin plus a timetable. We ate one night in the hotel and found it a bit pricey but that's to be expected in this sort of hotel. The service was good and the food excellent. We ventured out to the Carpenters Arms the next night which was cheaper and we thought better value for money but that's a pub for you. The spa area was lovely although we didn't expect to have to wear swimming hats. Breakfast was delicious with a good selection and great service. We were staying there for work and the reception were more than happy to organise taxis for us to our training centre. All in all great stay and I'd definitely return if I am in the area again.,5,2014,06,02
223,Amazing!,"Love love love this hotel, it's clean modern and amenities are second to none. 
The spa is exquisite very relaxing and lovely staff, pricy but worth it.
Food is beautiful and drinks where gorge best appletini in Dublin!
Rooms are spacious and clean with plenty of toiletries.
Will be back!!",4,2014,05,28
223,Misses the Mark,"The hotel is listed as a 4 star, but I had mixed feelings about the whole stay. I was booked in for one night. The location of the hotel is ideal, close to Dublin but in the countryside. First impressions were a bit mixed, lobby and reception looked modern, however the signed football shirts in the reception area looked out of place, and cheapen the area, maybe better to have these in the bar. Staff at reception were polite and engaging. I was assigned a room on the first floor which was clean and tidy. Bathroom looked impressive but the shower was broken and leaking, however this would be the only fault I would have. However the evening reception and bar staff were very disappointing. After returning from Dublin, we sat in the lobby and had a few drinks with friends, the waiter came down to the table and took our order. 20 minutes had passed, so I went up to the bar to find out what had happened to our order. I was informed that the waiter had finished his shift and had gone home for the night, I reordered and took our drinks to the table. Back in the room, we phoned reception for a menu for room service and was advised very abruptly that there wasn‚Äôt one, and we could have sandwiches, which were of a poor standard, perhaps made by a night porter rather than the hotel chef. The next morning, in the breakfast room, I really did struggle to find a clean plate, I picked up at least 7, They had either bits of dried food stuck to them or were wet. I also asked for a take away cup for my coffee. The waiter agreed to get me one, but didn‚Äôt come back, seems like a recurring problem with staff here.  I couldn‚Äôt recommend this hotel to my friends, which is a real shame.",3,2014,05,26
223,Am I the invisible woman?,"Travelled to Castleknock to have lunch and to enquire about a golf break for four friends in July. I entered the hotel and as reception was busy I went to the bar.  There was a couple at the bar and every table around it was marked reserved.  Every table.  I stood at the bar for a out five minutes and was completely ignored by the batman who was struggling with a n order as two other bar staff walked in and out.  So I found a table (with the previous diners dirty crockery still sitting there) and went and set there to study the menu.  And the staff walked up and down and despite waving politely and saying ""excuse me"" they just bustled past.  So, I decided to check the wifi out so walked down to what looked like the spa reception - it's a tiny reception and there were three females standing there talking- and again they just totally ignored me. It may be that I'm the invisible woman.  So I just decided to leave. Why would four people spent good money on a long weekend there when they just ignore the guests?  Dirty tables, rude staff, an empty bar with every table ""reserved"" - luckily the next hotel I visited was superb.  Avoid this one like the plague.",1,2014,05,24
223,Lovely hotel,Lovely hotel.  Great staff.  We had interconnecting rooms (family of 5).  Rooms were clean and nicely decorated.  Lovely bar area with good menu. All in all had a enjoyable stay and free pass to Dublin Zoo so well worth it.  Will be back.,4,2014,05,23
223,Above and beyond great,"We attended a wedding recently and couldn't get over the professionalism of the management and staff.
The Bride & Groom were treated like royalty and their special day was only enhanced by the wonderful staff.
I have an allergy to certain veg and Chef actually produced a side order without the veg I have an allergy to.
Chef just sent this out without me asking or wanting to make a fuss.
The hotel is spotless and quiet. We got a look at the rooms and they are spacious with views to rival most country hotels.
There is a golf club next door but not being a golfer I cannot comment but anybody I speak to sing it's praises.
I am a member of the gym ""Tonic,health and fitness center"" and have to sing the staff's praises.
The gym is well equipped and the pool,steam room,sauna along with a soak in the Jacuzzi are just what the doctor ordered.
Just a short taxi journey to Blanchardstown center, Dublin city,Phoenix park ,Dublin zoo etc.
Highly recommend a visit.",5,2014,05,12
223,Breakfast for DIL2014,Thank you very much to all the staff . Although we didn't stay in your hotel we had a delicious breakfast served to us on the morning of the DIL2014 walk. Thank you so much. It was very good value with the added bonus of a donation to Pieta House.,5,2014,05,11
223,AA Hotel Of The Year 2013/14 - Really?,"So, i'd like to start off by saying that overall the stay was good, obviously there were one or two issues which I will outline in my review, likewise there were also many positives which I will also detail.
So, we'd reserved the hotel over 5 months ago for a one week golfing trip, the reviews seemed good, the website was great, and to add to our excitement the hotel had recently been awarded the AA Hotel Of The Year for Ireland.

What we experienced was good, but could and should have been better, i'll start off with the negatives:
- Wifi in the room was non-existent, this was very frustrating for me and my friends as we all had work to do during the week, and one of the main reasons for choosing this hotel was the 'advertised' free Wifi in the bedrooms. We also spoke to other guests who were staying in our end of the hotel and it was clearly a frustration for them too. Its 2014, a good Wifi service in the room should be easy to arrange.
- The TV, was very small, again, I've stayed at many hotels and this was by far the smallest TV I've seen in a room for some time. Again complaining on a high level, but something that could easily be resolved.
- On entering the room there was an awful smell coming from the drains in the bathroom, I brought this to the attention of the reception and the next day it was gone, but returned throughout the week, it wasn't pleasant, but as we spent so little time in the room it wasn't a big deal.
- We ate at the hotel once, and the service was poor, the waiter was uninterested, we received one dish 10 minutes before the 2nd and 3rd dishes which were cold, and had to be sent back, the rest of the food arrived, and then 20minutes later the two dishes that were returned to be warmed up were then brought out (after constant chasing to the waiter). The quality of the food was actually good, so, no issues there either, it was just a shame that a) the meals didn't arrive together, and b) the waiter was totally lacking any enthusiasm. We spoke to the manager and were not charged for the 2 meals that arrived late, which was fair enough.

Now the POSITIVES:
- The location is excellent, if you're looking for a good hotel, away from the City with good facilities.
- The rooms were clean, and maintained well each day.
- The bar area was good, and the bar staff were good lads.
- The lounge area was bouncing on Friday and Saturday, great atmosphere, and a really nice place to spend some time.
- The Spa area was brilliant, great pool, whirlpool etc.
- The massages offered were perfect, especially after a days golfing, very much appreciated and very professional.
- The breakfast was very good, big choice, and you never felt that it was getting too busy.

Would I stay here again?, Yes
Would I recommend this hotel to others? Depends what you're looking for, location for the city is not ideal, but as a good weekend getaway its a good place.
Do I think that there are more deserving hotels worthy of the title 'AA Hotel Of The Year 2013/14'? Definitely.
It was feast or famine with the hotel workers, waiters and bar staff, they were either great, or not bothered at all.

Overall good but not great, but, with some more attention to detail I feel that this could be a really great hotel.",4,2014,05,07
223,Not our style,"Title may say it all, if you like loud, fast pace or sports this might be your place.  We were booked for two nights, the hotel was full and we got a room with some issues. I did find out next am that if you are having internet issues they can give you a piece of equipment to improve that.  Our room had issues that would take some time to fix. I don't recommend room 224.  I can say that the manager on duty Steven, was very professional and was more than fair with us. Food average for Ireland- we are from Kansas so beef is very different than back home. Bed pillow choice was nice and heated bath floors however shower is small. Location is good.",3,2014,05,01
223,"Not good for couples romantic getaway, otherwise good","We were in Ireland from the UK due to a friend being married in nearby 5* Luttrelstown Castle over the weekend, and had a good look at local hotels. Ultimately chose to book this hotel because it seemed the classiest and upmarket of the local hotels from the website. As we do not have the opportunity for many romantic holidays, we normally tend to choose the best we can afford.

On arrival, we found the car park large, and plenty of space for our rental car. There is a barrier entrance, which only requires a code upon exit. Code available from reception.

Reception welcome was great, we had a lovely Irish lady called Maria check us in who gave us all of our information. As we checked in she confirmed our spa reservation and our dinner reservation without prompting. She was very friendly and made us feel happy to be there from the start! We were several hours early to our 3pm check-in but had wanted to drop our luggage off. She was happy to help and even said we were welcome to check in early as soon as our room was ready. We had requested a quiet room on the second floor, and would recommend you do the same if you wish to avoid noise from weddings that are popular here every weekend. 

We chose to visit local Blanchardstown shopping centre while we waited for our room to become available. This is a 10 minute drive from the hotel in car, and reception are always pleased to give you helpful printed directions! Excellent shopping centre, apparently second largest in whole of Ireland.

On return as we checked in again properly, we were informed that we had been upgraded into an executive room! We were thrilled, having never been upgraded anywhere ever for anything! Our room was gorgeous, very spacious, overlooking the golf course. Humungous bathroom. Lovely large bed, and flatscreen TV. Free WIFI. As a hot chocolate lover I was thrilled to see hot chocolate amongst the hot drink selection. Robes, towels, slippers, iron, and essentials all provided. Heating fabulous and even had underfloor heating in bathroom. We had a bath and shower in the bathroom. Got ready for the wedding which was 10 minutes away in Luttrellstown Castle, and arrived back to the hotel at 1am the next morning. Had no problems getting back into the hotel at this late time. (The Castle incidentally is breathtaking, defo worth a visit if you can)

Breakfast is served from 6:30am till 11am I think on Sundays.
It is lovely how they separate families and couples appropriately - bravo for this. 
The area nearest the buffet is filled with screaming kids, and we were greatly relieved when our waitress seated us in the quieter section away from the food in a more quieter area away from the screaming uncontrollable kids. 
We thought that the selection was good, and again I was pleased to see hot chocolate was available as well as all the usual; cereals, juices, hot breakfast and croissants. Nothing was too much trouble, a few small requests were made and handled really efficiently by the lovely Polish staff.

We then visited the leisure facilities. Again, very helpful staff. You need a euro for the lockers. We entered the Jacuzzi and steam room. Both were clean and lovely. Lifeguard helpful and chatty. They offer compulsory swimming caps if you want to swim, for hygiene reasons. 
Be aware if you do want to use the pool which we didn't, there a lot of splashing families around on the weekend. Hence why we stuck to the Jacuzzi and steam room (where kids aren't allowed).

Leaving the leisure facilities, we popped out for some afternoon food from the hotel bar area. Good quality food, without too much of a wait initially we found. I asked if the beef wrap could be changed to chicken and they were happy to oblige, this tasted lovely. 
Only one complaint was that we ordered blueberry cheesecake for dessert, and a raspberry/strawberry cheesecake arrived instead which is a flavour I hate sadly. They sent it back after we asked for this to be swapped for a brownie - this took absolutely forever!
My fianc√© had to start to eat his apple crumble before the ice cream melted, which was not ideal as we had wanted to have our desserts together. As this was their error, I had expected it be rectified immediately. Got to the point where I had to go upto the bar and ask the staff member for my dessert again because my spa massage was due in 10 minutes, and this replacement dessert had now taken 20 minutes to be replaced, long after my fianc√© had finished his. 
In fairness, the lady took the brownie off the bill. But I would have rather have had the correct dessert, or ANY dessert, as soon the mistake had been identified in order to save the indigestion that followed after bolting down my dessert quickly before the spa appointment. 

I would advise against ordering food from their bar area - they do seem very busy and if they get things wrong, then take forever to correct mistakes. Go elsewhere for lunch.

Another hugely irritating episode for our stay involved another guest and a silly hotel management decision. 
On the Sunday afternoon we were staying at the hotel, there were some big football games on in the Premiership. (Namely Liverpool versus Chelsea). Myself and fianc√© deliberately chose our bar table to order our bar food so that we could be in front of one of the big screens in the hotel foyer to watch the game, along with a few other football fans watching the game around this TV monitor. 
While we were watching game (around 70 min mark), another guest came down and started looking annoyed. He approached a hotel staff member and to our surprise demanded that the Rugby Union game be shown on the screen instead, even though several people sitting by the monitor were watching the football game. 
The hotel staff member considerately noted that several people were watching the football game, and politely requested that the game be allowed to finish before Rugby could be put on the TV. 
The next 10 minutes involved some hotel idiot behind the scenes fiddling with the TV screen guide to find the Rugby channel, which meant that we could not properly watch the game at all because the screen was blocked by the constant tv guide flicking. 
The joke of it all was once the footy had finished, the inconsiderate rude Rugby man didn't even bother turning around to watch the rugby anyway. Don't know if this is how inconsiderate Dublin locals normally are but we were really not impressed. Hotel management should have had one Rugby TV from the start to avoid all this curfuffle or not flicked with the tv guide until after the footy was over. 

Anyway, then went to spa for half hour massage - was lovely. staff helpful, massage lovely. Definitely a good part of the stay.

Evening meal came with our stay, the food was not that great quality at the Park restaurant in our opinion. And you are limited by the menu. I would advise not adding the dinner option to your stay and go out to one of the lovely local restaurants in Blanchardstown instead. Pork belly was tough and vegetables portion was small. Would have preferred to have gone out to eat at this point, but were stuck with the dinner option added to our package

Overall, if you want a relaxing peaceful stay and have already booked: 
1. Avoid the hotel foyer/bar area COMPLETELY for leisure purposes (unless you enjoy the deafening noise of screaming children)
2.Furthermore do not order any food in the hotel bar area - go out for lunch/dinner at local Blanchardstown Shopping Centre, which has Wagamamas, Nandos, Italian, American Diner, coffee bars etc
3. Avoid the swimming pool, stick to the Jacuzzi and steam/sauna rooms
4. Do book yourself into their spa which has lovely treatments and staff

Overall the staff were lovely and helpful throughout for the most part. Facilities good. 
But be aware that on weekends, this place attracts a lot of idiotic and inconsiderate families. 

Would I stay here again? NEVER EVER again on a weekend, nor would I ever recommend. 
I would perhaps consider staying here, maybe on a weekday, outside of school holidays if I happened to be in the area. 

But if I'm honest I would have loved to have stayed at the 5* Luttrellstown Castle and if you can afford to do it, I would thoroughly recommend you do that instead",3,2014,04,29
223,Wonderful Hotel! Felt like home,"I stayed here for 13 days in august with 30 of my family members staying either there or at the Luttrellstown castle. The hotel staff was beyond accommodating and our room was spacious. The entertainment in the lobby in the evening was great. A talented pianist one night and a guy and his guitar the next. The bartenders at the main bar were pleasant and attentive. All in all wonderful stay,",5,2014,04,25
223,Improve food & service,"Pros: location, leisure area,household staff, cleanliness of rooms, comfy lobby/ bar& reception staff.             Cons: food, the breakfast buffet terrible , presentation very poor. Not once did I see the chef come out check t area. Have ask 2/3 staff for tea. Plenty staff on going round in circles . We had the dinner included option again terrible. We were seated in t cafe area because we had children with us! No atmosphere atall. The second night we got food in t bar which is better. Would I go back maybe? Only room only. Think manager should take a trip breakfast buffet in bewleys ballsbridge& compare. Not having brown bread or brown sauce in a four star hotel not good enough. Hotel was a disappointment .",3,2014,04,24
223,Enjoyable,"We stayed here on Good Friday night, excellent check in, beautiful room with lovely view. We were upgraded due to problems with our online reservation.  We then went to the bar for food to be told by 3 different staff that we couldn't order alcoholic drinks, we didn't even ask about drink but just wanted to get our 2 yr old fed. I ordered a baby bowl to include mash potatoes and veg with a little soup instead I got a spoonful of  cold mash with veg that I couldn't eat not to mind my son, and all topped off with gloppy salty gravy, because my son was so hungry I just fed him with the excuse for a baby dinner. We ordered a starter to share and 2 x fish and chips that eventually came all together after almost an hour, starter and main course together,  out of sheer frustration we just accepted it but couldn't eat the starter as it was cold and sent it back, fish and chips were seriously disappointing and tiny portions. Dinner came to a total of 42 euro, I was shocked to see that i was charged 3euro for baby bowel and 3.50 for a scoop of ice cream for my son! 
When we got back to our room it was so hot, like other reviewers we couldn't open window due to the loud noise coming from motor/boiler outside that continued until 12am. 
Breakfast I thought was very good, tasty, not greasy and plenty of choice, and I  did like the fact that people with small children dined in a separate area.
We thoroughly enjoyed the pool, clean and lifeguard on duty at all times.
It's a beautiful hotel, we will be back but we will definitely not be having dinner or bar food. The waiting staff seriously need a good shake up and/or training as one waiter in particular seriously frustrated us.",3,2014,04,23
223,April 21-23,"Second visit, having been here in July 13. Hotel facilities are good with nice pool and play ground out the back.  In 9 months the service and quality of food have deteriorated badly. Expect to at least be given cutlery at dinner. Seen lots of unhappy people waiting for ages with unsettled kids.  Breakfast was poor and dinner a big let down.  Won't be back.

",3,2014,04,23
223,One of the worst nights sleep!,"We had booked for two nights, when we arrived the girl at reception told us we were in Room 153, so we headed up only to find out key did not work. Luckily there was a cleaner in the corridor who let us in, my wife and two girls got settled in while I got our suitcase. I then went back to reception and told them my keys were not operating, she then informed me that our room was in fact 156! I headed back up to 153 and had to tell the girls to tidy up and move as they were in wrong room. Room 156 was at the rear of hotel and not large enough to be a family room,with a cot squeezed in, it had a very poor and limited view with numerous air conditioning units for other parts of the hotel located outside our window which were very noisy when we opened windows. I ensured that the radiator was turned off when we arrived, the weather was fantastic and with the sun beaming all day at rear off hotel, when we got back to our to our room after dinner around 6pm the room was absolutely boiling. We could not open the windows as the noise from the air con units was very irritating, my young girls could not sleep and were very agitated all night! There was a fan but it was pointless as it only moved hot air about the room. Needless to say we checked out a night early, they did not offer a refund or discount but they did say that my name is on the computer and if I book again they will locate us at a room not near any air con units????",3,2014,04,22
223,Worst hotel food ever..,"Booked into the hotel Easter Saturday for three nights we had dinner in the package.  we ate dinner on the 1st night, in an area which was like a cafe and service was terrible. We waited too long almost 1hr...kids got bored ...our waitress was not attentive, very slow and never asked us if everything was ok with our food.   Breakfast is also served in the cafe area especially
 for those who have young kids!! Unfortunately guests with young children seem to be excluded from the more elaborate area of the restaurant! Breakfast buffet was poorly presented with cheap looking plastic covers over hot food....very basic....certainly not in keeping with a 4* hotel more like a roadside cafe. Overall the standard of food was poor, so much so that we drove to other restaurants in the region to have dinner on the 2nd & 3rd nights. During our stay, we witnessed many guests complaining about the waiting time & poor quality of food.",2,2014,04,21
223,Good facilities but weak on the staff front,"Great layout and leisure centre is excellent. Not enough staff means that ordering a meal can be a slow and hit and miss affair.  Missed drinks and forgotten meals means that the whole family could not get eating at the same time, Leisure centre staff were just excellent when dealing with my handicapped son - full marks on that score
",3,2014,04,21
223,Castleknock,"Beautiful location, minutes from Phoenix Park & yet a countryside setting. Reception staff helpful & polite. Restaurant staff pleasant & polite. Food average and a 60 minute wait for a burger on night one, 70 minute wait for chicken wings on night two. Neither night was particularly busy. On check out two groups of guests complained re restaurant wait and incorrect order served. Reception staff, to my surprise, offered no compensation or adequate apology. Breakfast was poor for a hotel of such calibre. Gym is small, 7/8 aerobic machines, min weights, one deflated gym ball. Room was clean and bathroom products fantastic. Poor to no Internet connection in room. No fridge/minibar in room. Room overlooked car park, to front of hotel, and traffic was noticeable from 5am.",4,2014,04,20
223,Beautiful hotel convenient to central Dublin,"My wife, daughter and I spent a great week at this hotel over the St. Patrick's Day week. The property is absolutely beautiful, and the staff were top notch. My daughter caught a stomach bug while we were there and the staff went above and beyond to make her comfortable, offering free peppermint tea to settle her stomach and constantly asking how she was doing. When in the Dublin area we will definitely stay here again!",5,2014,04,16
223,Average would be a poor rating,"I have a view that one is either above or below average. Average is not good enough, It must be higher or lower. Marking as average is a cop out.

I stayed in this hotel recently and to treat my wife and myself, I booked a suite. The layout of the suite was very good - very spacious and plenty of room. However, as a suite should be the pinnacle of the hotel,  in our case, there were no robes provided. OK, you might say, why do they want with robes? Once you return to room after a day's travelling, it is great to have a shower and just chill out in robe for the evening - this was not possible as those on the golf course could see the room ,so lack of clothing was a problem!!!

The furnishing of the suite was good, but although there was a table for laptop, there was no chair provided. This is a problem simply resolved. 

Breakfast was good, but poached eggs proved impossible for chef. We were asked if we wanted them well done or runny. We both said runny and they both came out hard boiled. This simple request was very disappointing.  Bacon was very well done!. The elevator menu suggested that the early bird got the best bacon and he or she certainly did!! The bird who went for breakfast at 9am got a well steamed/poached fried/grilled bacon, not the best.

Bar food was of excellent quality and the accompanying wine was very reasonably priced. Well done to all the staff here.

Leisure centre was excellent. Pool was wonderful, sauna and steam rooms were very acceptable. Gym was well kitted out and staff were helpful.   

I noted when walking around that there was broken glass on the patio area. This should not be in a 4 star hotel. This was a pity. One would think that staff would not only sweep the area, but also vacuum it,

I would rate the leisure centre at 4 star, but the remainder of the hotel at 3 star. 

At the end of the day, the stay was disappointing and that was a pity.",2,2014,04,15
223,One night stay,"Myself and my bf stayed here for a night to celebrate our bdays! It has an amazing spa area and outdoors area (if it's a bit warmer) there was a wedding on when we arrived and they only had one bar which mean's we got mixed in with the party and seats were hard to find, it seemed to be busy apart from the wedding party anyway. We had a meal included in our stay and breakfast, the dinner was expensive and was nice apart from the starters they were both cold and had lumps of fat in them. The room was gorgeous, very spacious but the only negatives were that the bed was two singles pushed together, I payed extra for a king size bed so was disappointed by this and there was a generator outside the window which was noisy at night so I kept waking up. I did enjoy my stay overall though. Drinks are expensive but they have lovely cocktails. The long island ice tea was gorgeous but at 11 euro you wouldn't be having many..",3,2014,04,13
223,Very nice hotel buy not so nice prices,"I stayed here for one night only with my boyfriend nice hotel lovely spa, however the cleanliness was not that great. I think it is very pricey for what we got maybe include breakfast for the price they advertise. The bedrooms had very little light. Tried to do my make up and hair in the room was impossible :-(. Dont no if Id spend so much to stay here again.",3,2014,04,10
223,Decent Hotel Average Food,"Hotel room was ok. Nice bathroom.

Drinks were far too dear.

Food was fairly mediocre. Soup was poor, ok chicken, poor desert.

Breakfast was terrible and ridiculously expensive.The scrambled eggs were cat and the pudding was also cold.",3,2014,04,09
223,Nice but nothing special,"Great staff throughout,
Food... we had an overnight stay that included dinner which was a four course the starters was just ok ! Mains good although there was no chicken which I thought was odd, and the choice of desserts were poor I had the cheesecake pannacotta which was tasteless an stodgy the menu was lacking a bit of imagination.
Room was average but spotless we had a view of a grey flat roof very dismal it might be an idea to maybe put some decorative stones and some plant pots at least you would have something nice to look at. 
The other thing that I really hated about the room was the lighting,I like to read in bed as many people do but that was impossible as there are no ceiling spots only in the hallway there is only a beige dull standard lamp which gave out very little light and a reading lamp on the desk both were too far from the bed to be able to read I would have thought it standard to have some sort of lighting by the bed so annoying !!!!!!
Didn't use the Spa but it looks Fab 
Good buzz throughout the hotel. 
Not too sure if I would want to stay again...",3,2014,04,05
223,Lovely Hotel with great facilities.,"Second time staying for work related reasons and I have to say it offers everything for the business person as well as the tourist,weekenders or whatever your reason for staying.
Spacious rooms with all necessaries,iron,safe,coffee making etc.
Large free parking area.
Golf,Leisure center,lovely bar and Restaurant.....great food.
Great,friendly,professional staff throughout the Hotel from check in to check out.",4,2014,03,31
223,Beautiful and Relaxing,"My wife and i stayed at the castleknock hotel for one night as part of a gift we received. The front  desk staff were lovely and very courteous as were the accommodation staff as they were all very friendly and polite. We had a meal in the Park restaurant which was very delicious, as i am a Celiac they catered for my every need and payed great attention to detail. The pool staff were so very helpful and the place was very well kept, We also had treatments in the Tonic Spa which my wife said the facial she received was the best she has had in a very long time. We would like to thank Suzanne and Samantha who really looked after us and were very professional. We will definitely be back to stay.",4,2014,03,28
223,Lovely hotel,"Booked this hotel on recommendation of a friend. Stayed two nights with an evening meal. We used the pool area with a nice hot jacuzzi.  The food was excellent but there was a supplement for the steak and sides. All staff were very friendly and helpful.  
We used the bus to go into the centre of Dublin. This runs every 15 mins and was straight forward.
Room was large and clean. Bottles of water supplied plus tea/coffee facilities ( hot chocolate included).
Internet worked well.
We would go back.

223,2 expensive,"Stayed here with my family and friends for a wedding. Wedding food far below standard, melon was just piece of melon, soup had no flavour and beef was tough (hope this was just our table) Class of white wine ‚Ç¨6.75, red bull on its own ‚Ç¨6 pint of Guinness ‚Ç¨5.10 ... cocktails ‚Ç¨10 each. I dont mind paying that bit extra because I'm staying in a hotel but a toasted sandwich for ‚Ç¨12 is a bit harsh. ‚Ç¨17 for a basic breakfast???.  ordered two bowls of veg soup a glass of coke and pint of Guinness before we were heading home and we waited 15 minutes for our drinks (nobody else at the bar except us and 6 staff members standing around)I had to ask for our drinks at the bar again. Soup came out warm and a half portion if I could say the least. Bread was NOT fresh and no knife came to butter the bread. If the soup had of been of high quality I would not mind paying ‚Ç¨5.50 per bowl of vegetable soup which would of cost about 45 cent per bowl to make?? it was desperate. ... ",2,2014,03,24
223,Peaceful location!,I would give 3.5 to this hotel. The reason I stayed at this particular hotel was due to the proximity to my client's residence who lived in one of the villas adjacent to the golf course. The hotel staff was friendly. The room was spacious but the decor and furnishing appear to be outdated. The hotel lobby was very noisy. The breakfast was so so! Taxis are 30 minutes call away so hopefully you are not in a rush. ,3,2014,03,24
223,Absolutely Perfect!!,What a way to end or 10 days European tour. Castleknock hotel is gorgeous and the staff was outstanding. It was my birthday the night we stayed and 2 employees went out of their way to make the night memorable. Andrew in room service went out of his way to accommodate our late night meal as we arrived after 10pm. Then David in the bar was legend and even though it was past his time to get off he stuck around for just us and was very chatty and seemed happy to be there for us. The next day my girlfriend had a massage and said it was the best one she had ever had. We will def be back!! Thanks,5,2014,03,09
223,Good not great,"We had an overnight stay here having attended a wedding reception.  Arrival drinks which were held in the public bar was uncomfortable due to the volume of people attending, and with a distinct lack of seating a lot of the wedding guests were left in the lobby area.  The reception room was lovely and staff were helpful and pleasant, I had the beef which was a bit tough, but overall the meal was tasty.  the bedrooms were practical, comfortable and clean, finished to a high standard. Overall the experience was good but I could not say great because I felt while it suit the purpose it did not wow me",3,2014,03,09
223,Top Notch,"Myself and my wife stayed here for 2 nights. We spoiled ourselves and stayed in the Guinness Suite. From the very minute we entered the hotel, we were really impressed. The location is perfect, just a few minutes from the Phoenix Park and a short spin to Dublin City Centre, this still feels like a real country hotel. Large spacious foyer and lounge area makes relaxation easy. We dined in the Park Restaurant and it was scrumptious. Sometimes when you eat in an award winning restaurant, one fears either small portions or slow service. This had neither. The food was fab, well presented and had adequate portions.
The one constant in this hotel that hit us each day was the fantastic staff. Whether it was the reception, dining room, barstaff or the housekeeping staff, everyone was extremely helpful, friendly and did everything possible to make this stay memorable in every way. Don't miss the leisure centre.  
We will be back.",5,2014,03,09
223,Lovely Stay last November,"My Mum and I took my little girl (nearly 2) to stay at Castleknock last year. We had an amazing time and enjoyed every minute. The food was delicous and my little girl absolutely loved the pool area which has 2 great baby sections. We also both had treatments and they were incredible, would thoroughly recommend a Massage here. I come from a hotel background so can be terribly fussy but I have to say this is one of the nicest and warmest places I have stayed in Ireland.",5,2014,03,08
223,Exceptional Location for Charity Ball,"Just returned from a charity ball in the Castleknock Hotel, I am seriously impressed with the venue, had a really good meal - unusual for a big function, very pleasant and attentive service, I will be back.",5,2014,03,01
223,I'll be back!,"This is my sort of hotel. Spacious room, lovely grounds, ample parking, beautiful pool,hot jacuzzi, decent breakfast buffet and friendly staff. Just what I need when over-nighting on a  business trip. I got a very good mid-week price for which I have stayed in some crummy places n the past.
I ate bar food last night and my two dishes were tasty and good value. Absolutely no complaints - I stay in a  lot of hotels and I will definitely be staying here again in the future.",5,2014,02,28
223,Not bad...,"Stayed for valentines long weekend. Room was acceptable. . Let down by a filthy chair..which I was reluctant to sit on...and just attention to detail..cracks in plaster , cracking varnish on doors..and a really poor view of the roof and it's noisy heating and ventilation. ...It did have all the amenities we wanted.iron.wifi kettle etc.. but when we ordered room service it took nearly 40mins to get through and when it came it was wrong. 

Apart from the niggles...hotel is out of the way so a peaceful break was had. Spa is fine...Castleknock is a 20min walk and has loads of restaurants (too many to be honest?) 

If your not expecting absolute indulgence and pure luxury...just somewhere nice to get away ...you shouldn't be disappointed.",3,2014,02,20
223,What a fantastic stay,"We decided to have a few days away in Dublin. We had checked out a few places to stay and this one was the preferred choice. We arrived, and was greeted by a really helpful receptionist. She was polite and efficient. Check-in was see less. We got into the room and it was outstanding. Very comfortable and clean. The first night was a little noisy, after all there was a wedding on. We still enjoyed a comfortable stay. The hotel facilities are fantastic and it's ideally situated for the highways or the city. Pheonix Park is literally 10 minutes away. All in all, a fantastic place I would highly recommend.",5,2014,02,12
223,Very Enjoyable,"Really enjoyed this short break, the hotel was lovely and very child friendly. It was in a lovely location as although you were near the city it felt like you were out in the country. The food was excellent dined both nights in the hotel.The staff were very helpful and friendly. Would definitely stay here again.",4,2014,02,12
223,"great location, really relaxing","Our stay was a pre-Christmas trip for some shopping and relaxation. The package was for a two night stay with one evening meal and a spa treatment.  On arrival, the reception staff were very friendly, chatty and helpful.  We got to our room which was perfect, clean and with all the necessities for a short stay.  Dinner was booked for the evening we arrived.  We thought the dinner would be a dull affair as most packages like this can be, but we were pleasantly surprised.  the choice on the menu was great. Again the restaurant staff were friendly, pleasant and helpful. Dinner was beautiful.  All three courses were very well presented and tasted divine.  I seriously recommend that you have dinner.  
the following morning, we went to the spa for our treatment included in our package.  Unlike other spas I have gone to, my wife and I were not separated in different rooms but taken together to the treatment room and relaxation rooms afterwards.  it was a romantic package so they obviously kept this in mind.  The spa staff were equally friendly and helpful.
The only downside was that the room  was a little cold at night and there were no additional bed clothes or pillows.  Still this will not take from a very enjoyable stay.
Plenty of shopping close by with Blanchardstown SC being the closest and Dundrum SC and the city centre not too far away.",5,2014,02,08
223,Very Nice Hotel,I got a good deal at this hotel recently and though the location is a little remote the onsite facilities are excellent. From the moment of checkin to checkout I could not fault the place. The rooms are lovely and comfortable which ensured a good nights sleep. The food in the bar area was excellent and the buffet breakfast was perfectly adequate.  It is located on a golf course and i would have no hesitation staying here again perhaps for leisure rather than business the next time round.,5,2014,02,07
223,Nice property- excellent service,"First the excellent
Excellent
Great people and service- extremely helpful and pleasant.
Breakfast buffet was very nice- good solid choices- and of course Irish Soda Bread.
The location itself was beautiful and relaxing. Golf course very nice.
Spa (massage only) was relaxing and nice (more comments on the work out area below)-I had a one hour message - the masseuse was excellent and the room lovely and relaxing highly recommended

Good- Dinner service for our group was good and the meals (given the size of the group) were very good.  I cannot comment on dinner or lunch since I was with a larger group starting the first night of my visit.
Room- roomy for Ireland (being a Yank)- room was rather stuffy (I could not figure out how to cut off the heat) so I ended up sleeping with the Window open in January.
Meeting rooms were well equipped and AV assistance and all other (breaks) well done.

Needs Improvement- I am a workout fanatic- do it almost every day when traveling but unable to run because of knees.  Gym area needs an overhaul. Looks like it has not been touched for well on a decade. Agining Tech Gymn elliptical are not good.  Rowing machine okay (Concept 2) but also aging and the workout calculator (showing distance and time) did not work.  Weight machines aging and cranky.  Gymn packed and too many people for too small  a space.
Dumbells and mats available which I used.
They also have a spinning room with good machines. Despite the excellent spa massage experience (on a differing floor and very much a different experience than the gym workout room) because of the disrepair and aging equipment I rated the Spa as a three only (Massage a five and gym a 2).",4,2014,02,05
223,Warm and welcoming,"We went to Ireland to celebrate my wife's 50th birthday. We began our time in Ireland at the Castleknock Hotel. The rooms were clean, comfortable and inviting. A walk in the surrounding area was beautiful and quiet. Breakfast at the hotel was very good. Irish coffees in the bar during the evening were not only tasty but were presented very nicely.",4,2014,02,03
223,Fab!!!,"We went for a break away with our 4 month old daughter, from the moment we walked in everyone was so helpful, room clean and warm, we had dinner in the Brasserie that evening, staff here went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable, welcomed our baby and hurried our service when we requested it, even when baby fell asleep, they were quiet and discreet with us when clearing table.  We got our breakfast to the room, it was lovely. Went to pool for babies first time it was lovely, warm and clean.  I would definitely stay here again, I've never come across such helpful, considerate staff anywhere else!Room was fabulous, so cosy and luxurious.",5,2014,01,30
223,Fantastic spa day spent in castleknock!,"I got a present of a spa day which included a back,neck & shoulder massage & facial in the beautiful Tonic Spa...I cannot talk highly enough of the wonderful staff, the sumptuous surroundings and the utter feeling of calm & relaxing at this lovely hotel. We had dinner & wine in the hotel, and the service, food & atmosphere was wonderful, we floated home feeling thoroughly rejuvenated & relaxed. i will be recommending to all of my friends, and will most definitely be returning again.",5,2014,01,30
223,No staff answering any of the internal phone lines for over 30 mins,"I arrived about 60 mins ago., c 8.30pm and have settled into my room 151. I dialled '0' for reception to check which option on the WiFi menu I should chose for my laptop. No answer. No answer from housekeeping, the concierge, the spa or the restaurant. I dialled the hotel outside line from my hotel phone.  No answer from the reception option on the menu.  I dialled the hotel outside line from my mobile phone.  No answer from the reception option on the menu - it rang out. I dialled '0' again on my room 'phone and am hanging on for an answer while I type this review using my mobile wifi connection. I'm in my pyjamas and don't fancy having to get dressed to find someone to ask about the wifi.
I'm hanging on now for 15mins + for answer from reception.  This is like being on the Marie Celeste, or maybe Hotel California???
I would welcome any inventive suggestions from readers as to what to do about a problem like this.",1,2014,01,27
223,Luxury and fine food and friendly and expert service,"As good a hotel experience as you can have in Dublin area.
Excellent facilities, good dining experience both a.m. and p.m. 
Clean,warm and attr active pool.
Only drawback is remote location and the slow bus journey into Dublin centre-45 mini",5,2014,01,27
223,Very Disappointed,"Have just returned from an overnight stay our stay was bed breakfast and dinner package .Check in was quick and efficient very nice girl on reception. Bedrooms were fine bathroom a bit small but just there for one night so it was fine. Our problem was the restaurant we arrived for our booking at 8 no problems shown to our table there was 6 of us  ordered our meals starters ok not great our mains arrived 4 hake 1 duck and no pork which had been ordered by my husband I looked over to the door and there was a discussion going on between the manager and the waiter  my husband told us to start eating so our meals would not be cold  we finished our mains and still no meal for my husband I went to speak to the manager who said my husband had changed his order to pork  I explained to him that he had not changed his order  and if there was a problem it would have been courteous to come to the table and explain what was going on .After sitting for another 20 minutes with empty plates in front of us he arrived over to say his meal would be out soon he offered us a baileys or Irish coffee but my husband declined his meal did arrive soon after by this stage my husband did not want to eat it ,he did however and it was very nice. However we were another 20 minutes sitting with empty plates in front of us we eventually got out of the restaurant after 3 hours .My husband and 2 of our friends had a bottle of red wine which they did not charge for .Our other problem was the bar we then had a drink in the Lime tree bar and when this closed we had to use the main bar my friends husband was drinking Ballantines but when he went to the main bar they said they did'nt sell it so he had to explain he had it in the other bar and they said they would try and get him some .
I' m afraid the whole evening was spoiled by the events in the restaurant I would not be in a hurry to return.",3,2014,01,26
223,Great Stay,"This is our second time to stay in this hotel, The first time we stayed we had the children with us this time it was must myself and my husband. We found the staff very friendly and helpful, The hotel is very clean and nice d√©cor ,The rooms are specious and comfortable. We had a fantastic meal in the restaurant, the food was very well presented and very tasty and again the staff are very friendly. This hotel is suited for family's, couples, or even groups of girls which could treat themselves to the fantastic spa, and a group of men who can treat themselves to a round of golf. 

The only thing I can complain about it that the hairdryer in our room (the second visit) was awful so slow took ages to dry my hair, not what you would expect at this hotel. 

We will stay here again.",5,2014,01,22
223,All work and no play,"Location a bit of a hassle to get to, but feels out in the countryside - road noise very audible outside.

Room was odd - 3 single beds and those hangers that don't have a hook - very annoying given that the rail was about 7 feet off the ground.

Room was also really hot and little seemed to make it cooler.

Staff were friendly. Cleaners standard was very good.

For a conference it did the job.  Although getting the meeting room temperature under control was a challenge and for the set up we attended you had to walk through one meeting room to get to some others - really weird as you would actually walk through another meeting that was going on.  

When music is playing on ground floor for a party, you can hear it on higher floors.",3,2014,01,18
223,Pleasant 2 day stay,"Stayed here for 2 days after the New Year. Went with youngest daughter & her family. 
We arrived just after 1pm & even though check-in was 3 pm they were able to let us have 1 room & the other room was ready after 1 hour. We decided to have a quick bite to eat then go use the pool facilities. The staff in the bistro were very accomodating for our vegetarian daughter & were able to supply her with a toastie option that wasn't on the menu.
We decided to eat our evening meal in the hotel- we opted for the wine & dine menu. The wine was lovely but my main meal was too salty & the daughter's veggie option was not as described & very dry. The 2 guys enjoyed their meals. We also opted for the breakfast deal so ate breakfast each morning at the hotel. Couldn't fault the choice of food or the quality at the buffet breakfast.
The hotel was very busy (loads of families staying over New Year) & so was the pool, which was quite cold. We did complain about this (we had a 7 month old baby with us who luckily had a wetsuit on otherwise we couldn't have stayed in the water at all) & was told it was because it was so busy they were having to refresh the water & that it would be warmed tomorrow as a lot of guests were leaving. we used the pool 3 more times & the water temperature was fine but the changing rooms were too cold for wet bodies.
The rooms were ok. Large comfy beds, kettle etc but no fridge. Baby's food had to be put in the guest fridge in the kitchens but the staff were very quick at retrieving it whenever we wanted. Had to turn off the radiator at night as the room was very warm. Also our room had a security light right outside which the curtains didn't block completely so the room wasn't really dark enough at night.
The first night was quite noisy as a lot of guests were partying in their rooms with kids running up & down the corridors until the early hours, so we were a bit tired the next day. Luckily this didn't happen the second night.
The hotel is out on its own so if you want to eat or drink elsewhere be prepared to drive. It is within a few mins drive of Blanchardstown where there is a large shopping mall/complex with cinema, bars & restaurants. Phoenix Park is a couple of kilometres away & Dublin centre only a few kilometres further than that.",3,2014,01,14
223,"Magical hotel, not in the city but easy access to everything","This hotel was clean and friendly. I stayed for 3 nights and was not disappointed, my only criticism is that the heating was OTT and there is no fridges in the rooms. Room was so hot I had to have windows open over night! Food was ace so were the staff, I would recommend this hotel for every aspect from location to value for money. Golf course on doorstep and next door to where the Beckhams got married. When I go back to Dublin this is where I will be booking, no question.",4,2014,01,09
223,afternoon tea,"wanted a special treat for some friends, had booked in advance, asking for a nice cosy table, got a table in the foyer, with very uncomfortable chairs.
I had to order sandwiches separately, as afternoon tea did not include that......... most unusual, sandwiches were ok !!! but not what you expect, then we got 4 big scones, not warmed,4 big muffins, and the most horrible pastries, if you could call them that.I will compliment the staff, they were excellent.I recommend that the chef would visit perhaps, Radisson St Helens, which does a very nice afternoon tea.",1,2014,01,05
223,Comfy & relaxing,"Stayed here with my husband for a weekend,  thought it was a great hotel.  
Good points:
1) under floor heating in the bathroom
2) separate bath & shower but bath also had shower head
3) roomy & comfortable bed
4) good sized room
5) recycling encouraged & recycling rubbish bag provided
6) room was a nice temperature,  not too hot as most hotel rooms are
7) staff were nice
8) the hotel was quiet, lot of people staying there but not noisy.
9) swimming pool & spa facilities
10) room & hotel very clean

Bad points:
Docking half a point due to the food,  it was ok but not wow.
Another half point as I thought the water in the bath & shower could've been hotter but then I like really hot showers. 

Overall very enjoyable stay.
",4,2014,01,05
223,great stay!,"Stayed here the night of justin timberlake at pheonix park in july 2013. Such a beautiful hotel, brilliant food and comfortable room. You couldnt ask for more, and to top it off was getting midnight sandwiches which were great!.",5,2014,01,04
223,Family New Year,"Some of my family stayed here for 4 nights whilst my daughter, husband ,toddler and baby and myself joined for New Year's Eve stay. Good rooms, helpful staff and excellent meal and very child friendly. All enjoyed pool and gym.also very quiet...presence of security staff excellent",4,2014,01,03
223,"Great staff, but expensive!","Really enjoyed our stay here. The staff could not have been any more friendly, in all the areas (restaurant, check in, spa, housekeeping). There were nice touches with fresh milk delivered to the room for our tea, or a pillow menu for different types of pillows. 

We had lunch in the lobby/ bar area. It was carvery (and an expensive one at that, nearly ‚Ç¨14), and was barely warm. 

The spa was lovely, although my poor mother was booked for two treatments back to back and the second therapist clearly forgot about her as she was left lying on the bed a half hour waiting. 

The restaurant is gorgeous, really nice d√©cor and the staff were so attentive. It is so expensive though, the drinks were so dear, even the cheapest bottle of wine was almost ‚Ç¨24! 

Breakfast was nice, and they do a self service and a menu for kippers, salmon, pancakes etc. but they charge a fee (‚Ç¨3) for the menu items. I have never had to pay a surcharge on these items in any other hotel.",4,2014,01,02
223,Looking a bit tired,"1 business guest.

Had feedback from colleagues that this was the hotel to stay in when in Dublin. I was a bit disappionted, as the hotel felt quite tired and in need of a refurb. The detail was sorely lacking in most areas although the high points were: service & gym/spa facilities.

Food was okay, but the restaurant & bar area felt distinctly 3 star. Rooms were very large, but again just lacking in detail.

Its a shame as the location and facilities suggest what could be a great hotel.",3,2013,12,31
223,"Lovely hotel, a bit of a drive to the city.","We stayed here with our 3 year old toddler, and had a lovely stay here. It is an extremely family friendly hotel, all the staff were very accommodating. The rooms were lovely and clean and the bar food was great. It was very busy when we stayed there, during mid term break, but the service didn't suffer. We used the pool once while we were there, the changing areas were a bit small but it was also very busy the day we were there, so it felt a bit cramped. Breakfast was great each morning too. It was a bit of drive from the city, but close enough to the Zoo.",4,2013,12,30
223,Hotel of the year,"This hotel has been awarded hotel of the year .Stayed there for 2 nights last week end . Has a meal in the Brazier restaurant  on the Saturday evening .Must say the quality ,presentation and taste of the food was excellent.  Classic delivery of cuisine in every sense .Well done to all .",5,2013,12,19
223,Another great visit,"Once again stayed at the hotel this time for four nights. Very welcoming and family oriented. Friendly staff and first class appointed rooms. Great place to return to after a day out in Dublin or the country. Will definitely stay again, in fact have booked up for the spring 2014",5,2013,12,19
223,Fab Hotel for short break,"Hotel is out in the countryside but easily found, building and grounds are lovely and staff very friendly. Room was lovely and bar area great plenty of seats etc. one downside, the menu in the dinner inclusive package has a very poor selection compared to other hotels I have stayed in where we have had full selection from the menu. Would recommend and stay again!",4,2013,12,17
223,Positive in the main.,"Stayed here for the first time for just one night.

Check in staff were welcoming and very informative regarding the facilities.

The room which was on the second floor seemed to be a long walk from reception. The room itself was fairly large, with a settee and good size desk, everything in the room was a little tired and needed a refresh. I was disappointed that the TV was an old shape 16:9 ratio 15inch screen.On the positive side the bed was very comfortable.

In common with so many hotels the lighting was poor, with no central light. The wifi is free, worked well in the bar and lobby areas, but was hit and miss in the bedroom.

We eat in the bar and watched the football, whilst the food was simple it was well cooked and tasty, again the staff here were very chatty and welcoming.

We used the conference room for a meeting and found that facility to be good.",3,2013,12,16
223,Food not great,"Saturday 7th
Stayed here for a small Christmas party. Hotel is lovely , room was spacious & clean. Had a treatment in the Tonic Spa which was lovely thanks to Diane . The meal however took ages to arrive and was just warm which was a pity. There were long wait times between each course, I felt that our food must have been left sitting. Atmosphere in the hotel was great. ",3,2013,12,14
223,"Nice facilities, service is poor.","I've chosen to stay here 3 times due to it's location and proximity to my business meetings when in Dublin.

Overall, the hotel is very nice and for the price I have always paid it should be difficult to find fault.  The rooms are large and contain all of the expected amenities, the bar service is good and they have some great staff.  The food I have had at the hotel was brilliant but I haven't used the pool or gym at this hotel so can't comment on those.  

The reception though is a real let down for this otherwise lovely hotel, all 3 times we have had issues.  Our organisation uses a travel booking company, the deal is the same anywhere in the world, they secure the booking with the hotel and provide details so that the hotel charge payment for room and breakfast to the company, travellers pay for anything else on departure.  Despite having this in writing (which is a confirmation from the hotel) each time we have been told the room is not paid for and that we must provide payment before check in, now this isn't so much an issue but it's the necessary pain required to resolve it.

Fast forward to the following morning where at breakfast I am also told whilst trying to eat and drink that I would need to pay for that too and I am beginning to think its the service which is a bit of a let down.  The company provide credit cards so it's not a payment issue either.

On check out, magically the booking company have provided payment details and I am apologised too and asked only to settle any extras.  Repeat this course of events ALL 3 times with the same member of reception staff and I am done staying here.  

The bit I have never worked out is that some colleagues in the same stay and who book the rooms exactly the same way (through an internal travel desk who use the same agent) sail through reception processes without hindrance, .....it really is hit and miss and  if you're on the unlucky list you can't help feel you are marked as a 'potential thief' as all the staff want to do is pre-authorise a card rather than help sort the issue.  As I've said the payment is not the issue but the staff on reception really could be a little more helpful in resolving issues and learning from them in any future stays, 3 times of exactly the same pain is the last time.  

Recommendation if you're a business traveller is to call ahead and confirm the payment details.",3,2013,12,13
223,Excellent hotel,"We had a lovely break at the castleknock hotel..it was spotless clean, the staff were very friendly and professional. Our room was very comfortable. Food was excellent. There was a nice athmosphere in the hotel. We look forward to returning again. The hotel is in a great location for shopping at Blanchardstown centre.",5,2013,12,08
223,Looks good but leaves a lot to be desired....,"Met with some friends for dinner and see the usual complaints have not been resolved, very slow service. Starter was a trio of of melon salmon roulade and pate whch was quite nice. Next came the main, which took ages, couldn't find the veg ( a dish of veg arrived after everyone have finished) and topped off with a somewhat lackluster trio of deserts. When the tea/coffee arrived, the coffee was dished out, no milk on the table, and the tea never arrived. Overall unsatisfactory, and with the bar prices not out of place in templebar, this is not really great value for money. While it is a fantastic hotel, the service does not match up to expectations. Also, what is the deal with the barriers into the carpark, no dropoff area for taxis... really peeves them off....",2,2013,12,07
223,Tonic Health & Day Spa - Yummy Tummy Treatment was amazing!!,"I Visited the Tonic Health & Day Spa a few weeks ago and I got the new Yummy Tummy Treatment when I was 26 weeks pregnant. I am not normally one who would get massages but with the uncomfortable pregnancy I have had along with the need to de stress, this was the best decision I could have made.

Jennifer was the lady who looked after me, and she was nothing but warm and welcoming throughout. This girl is amazing at what she does, and has completley changed my mind about massages, having had some bad ones in the past in other hotels.
The relaxation room when you first arrive is wonderful, and after the treatment you get to come back in here again to just enjoy the surroundings, have a ly down to relax and unwind. They offer complimentary juices, teas etc aswell which is a wonderful added touch.
The treatment itself lasted an hour, mainly focusing on my belly, they even check to make sure first that you are happy with them touching the belly, apparently some people arent too keen on this, I was the complete opposite! And baby sure enjoyed it aswell, we were both completly relaxed. Jennifer fully explained before the treatment what she would be doing, what she would be using, and what kind of massages I would be getting apart from the stomach. She was even kind enough to make sure she didnt give me the usual foot massage, as I personally dont like my feet being touched! Im sure most pregnant love it I am the opposite, but that was not a problem, I got a lower leg massage, arm and hand massage, neck and shoulder massage, which was just amazing.
Lovely soothing music was playing throughout the whole treatment, and I was given little covers to go over my eyes, which really helped in relaxing.

I honestly didn't want the treatment to end, was gutted when it was finished! I can honestly say I have never been so relaxed in my whole pregnancy as I was during this treatment, if I could, I would be doing it weekly! Would hope to have another one before baby is born, fingers crossed I can squeeze this in. Would be lovely to have this again before the chaos of a new baby starts.
I cannot recommend Jennifer or this treatment highly enough. Jennifer even offered to go through each product with me afterwards which I gladly accepted as I ended up buying the stretch mark butter and the oil, which are both very good and I love the feeling on them on my belly, the baby oil I was using before just took hours to dry and was so uncomfortable, the butter dries in instantly which is great for when you are in a rush or heading off to work, no waiting around for it to dry! I prefer the butter myself but the oil is also great and the oil will also last longer, so definitely worth getting both.

All in All, it was a lovely experience, and I would recommend all Mothers to be to get this done before baby arrives!",5,2013,12,01
223,Nice hotel....service fail!!!,"My family and I recently stayed here to celebrate my fathers retirement. Everything started OK but as soon as we sat down for dinner things went downhill rapidly. First off my wife was given a different menu than everyone else (we only found this out after the food arrived). The starters came and went...then the mains came, they were put down on the table...and swiftly taken off us as they were for a different table (my dad had already starting eating his) then we waited...and waited for our food to arrive. In the meantime no one asked of we wanted another drink or if we wanted to our water topped up. Eventually we got our food...at this stage we were thinking of going to McDonalds. Then the wait for desert and coffee started. Couldn't wait to leave the table. We complained (politely) several times. ..to be told ""sorry we are very busy"" well thats not my problem, im paying to be here, the very least I expected is good service. The next morning at breakfast my sister asked for pancakes for my niece (whos birthday it was) and she was charged ‚Ç¨3!!! Unbelievable.
I hear the NZ all blacks are staying here in lue of their game against Ireland...hopefully they receive the same level of service! ",3,2013,11,24
223,Friendly atmosphere wonderful service and accommodations,We just spent 6 nights here and had a wonderful time. The room was not huge but they made good use of space. The bathroom was very spacious and modern. We loved the pool but wish bathing caps were not required. The breakfast had everything you could ask for in the morning buffet. The bar was wonderful but a little pricey. The staff were very accommodating and the meal at the wedding we attended was delicious. I would highly recommend it.,5,2013,11,19
223,"CASTLEKNOCK HOTEL AND GOLF CLUB, CO DUBLIN","CASTLEKNOCK HOTEL, CO. DUBLIN

We selected the Castleknock for our mid-week break because it was advertising itself as ‚ÄúThe AA Hotel Of The Year 2013 - 2014‚Äù.  The directions provided by the hotel were excellent and we were able to find it easily.  It‚Äôs located about 2 kilometres on the far side of Castleknock village ‚Äì which itself is only about 9 kilometres from the centre of Dublin.  The village is a lovely little place and greatly enhanced by the stunning autumnal colours of the thousands of trees everywhere.  New England; eat your heart out!

The hotel is very large and modern and all the staff are excellent and evidently enthusiastic about their roles.  Car park security is enhanced by the requirement to use a pin number for exit.  

The hotel grounds are beautiful and encompass the 18 hole Castleknock Golf Club.  It looks to me like a tough course ‚Äì but then, what do I know!

The restaurants, bar and other public areas within the hotel are attractively laid out and welcoming.  There‚Äôs an excellent gym, pool and spa ‚Äì none of which we managed to make sufficient use of.  

We did worry about signs we‚Äôd noticed cautioning us that, at certain times, we might have to queue for breakfast.  But as it turned out, this problem never arose.  We had one evening meal in the hotel‚Äôs Park restaurant and the food was excellent though the service was rather slow.

The bedrooms were well finished though the tiny triangular shower stall could have caused a problem for someone with a ‚Äòlarger figure‚Äô!  Coffee and tea-making facilities were on hand.  But no courtesy bottled water.  Nor was there a mini-bar.  And no courtesy slippers or bathrobes available.  So did we view The Castleknock as ‚ÄúThe AA Hotel Of The Year 2013 ‚Äì 2014‚Äù?  Well!  Maybe!  We were there for a mid-week break and it wasn‚Äôt wildly expensive ‚Äì decent value for money, in fact.  And yes, we would go back.

The one thing, though, that might put us off returning was finding that we were seated beside an entire family that had been allowed to come down for breakfast in their pyjamas!  Now we‚Äôre not the kind of people who think everyone needs to dress for dinner anymore.  But breakfast in a high-class hotel in your PJ‚Äôs!  Please!",4,2013,11,16
223,wonderful escape,"stayed here for 2 nights recently with children. The hotel is ideally located to visit most of the city attractions, as well as having a very good restaurant. We will be definitly be returning here again next year, just make sure to have sparkling wine in stock!!",5,2013,11,10
223,Perfect,"Only getting married a couple weeks ago we had a surprise get away to Ireland. Arriving at this walm and welcoming hotel. Having travelled from Cornwall in England we were happy that the receptionist arranged an early check-in for us without requesting this before arrival. Our room over looked the golf course and we were  welcomed with a plate of chocolates and a mini congratulations cake on our table. The room was fresh and clean great quality. We ate in the restaurant on the first night And it was superb quality. The staff were all hard working and attention to detail was spot on ,trained well. Exceeding our expectations.  We then returned to eat the flowing 2nights due to our experience.  We were helped with bus times to the city centre. We were looked after from start to finish. We will return  in the future and maybe next time bring our 2 children along as they would love the swimming pool there!!! A perfect and relaxing honeymoon :) thank you to all the staff ",5,2013,11,08
223,Nice modern hotel.....,"Stayed on Sunday night 3rd. Nov as we had to travel to Donegal and wanted hotel on north side of city of Dublin to travel early next morning. The hotel is situate some two miles from the village of Castleknock some 15 mins from the centre of the city of Dublin. Castleknock Golf Club is adjacent to the hotel and the club house is some 500 metres away.
Went there for some Sunday lunch before travelling to Dublin for reunion. As you enter the entrance, bar reception is quite open plan and was busy for lunch. Lunch was carvery style and quite good and good value. 
After reunion in Dublin decided to stay and return to the hotel. The special rate of dinner bed and breakfast midweek for November was attractive and good value. 
We checked in without fuss and allocated room 258. The writer is a very light sleeper and didnt ask for a quiet room on arrival (mea culpa). on arriving in room it was quite warm the I opened window and the units were quite noisy. Even when closed the noise would annoy me (Again I am a very light sleeper). Went to reception and explained and without fuss was allocated room 119 a much quieter room.
Went to bar for a drink. Drinks quite expensive. Plenty of alcoves and corners and places to find your own space. As the writer is a golfing fanatic decided to go over to Golf Club for a drink. Quiet for a sunday evening around 20 people (met someone I knew). Had a few drinks some 20 per cent chedaper than hotel. Golf Clubhouse closed circa 7.30. Returned to hotel for dinner and thoroughly enjoyed the food. Went to Lime Bar (Cocktail Bar) for night caps good Staff pleasant and attentive. Likewise breakfast was buffet style and good choice of frest fruit cereals yogurts etc.
Overall a modern friendly hotel and can understand why it won AA hotel of the ye
ar, Will return,",4,2013,11,07
223,Exactly what was needed!,We stayed over Halloween for 2 nights. Hotel is set on beautiful grounds with plenty of car parking. Foyer is large and beautifully decorated. There was plenty of buzz in the hotel when we arrived. Check in was efficient and we upgraded yo an exec room( a must for a nice view of the golf course) although the room was a bit if a walk from reception we didn't mind....room was great size with super king bed... My only criticism is the duvet..it was a bit flat and didn't fit the bed properly. The room was spotless and the shower was fantastic!!! Breakfast was comfortable and selection was great. Lovely layout for the buffet and everything fresh. Staff were polite and efficient esp Mark (new guy in the bar) he served us on the Friday evening.... Excellent customer service!! Great deal on the Axa leisure breaks and the upgrade is worth it! Thoroughly enjoyed our stay. ,5,2013,11,05
223,"Excellent service and facilities, need to fix technology","Stayed here from 29 ‚Äì 31 October. The hotel was excellent in nearly every way. Reception was efficient, able to supply bus information. The bus fare into town was ‚Ç¨2.80 for single journey. The bus expects the correct fare as no change is given. The local paper available in the hotel lobby notes that a fare increase will occur at the beginning of December ‚Äì the fare is to be ‚Ç¨3.05. If you walk another couple of minutes past the bus stop shown by the hotel, you come to the next bus stop with Spar supermarket, Insomnia coffee shop and chemist. The Insomnia coffee shop is useful to watch out for when returning to the hotel in the dark.

Most of the path from the hotel to the bus stop is lit, we took about 50 paces in darkness but I brought a torch to help see.

The food was good ‚Äì breakfast whilst not having a large choice still had a very good range of food which importantly tasted delicious. We stayed for an hour and half each morning having breakfast! The complimentary newspaper was a good idea as well and showed attention to detail. We enjoyed a dinner there ‚Äì whilst maybe not the largest portions, the quality was excellent and we felt full after eating. 

The foyer was always busy ‚Äì it seemed some business people did business there in the morning, and by lunchtime those staying in the hotel were using it. We liked the log fire effect on the tvs when they weren‚Äôt showing football/Sky News. 

We used the Spa which was good. Our treatments were relaxing and we enjoyed settling into the relaxation room.

One person had said they were unable to enjoy a country walk from the hotel which we disagree with. We walked out the main gate, turned right towards the GAA club and kept going along the pavement (under the M50). The road felt it was in the country ‚Äì going through fields with animals, the odd house, a river running beside the road. At the first lights, we turned right which took us towards St. Vincent‚Äôs school in lovely grounds, at its front entrance at a cross roads, we walked straight on, up a ‚ÄòNo Through Road‚Äô which took us to ‚ÄòWhite‚Äôs Gate‚Äô at Phoenix Park. We discovered that Farmleigh‚Äôs entrance was there with free tours ‚Äì we were just in time for the last one of the day. It takes about 45 minutes at a brisk pace to get there from the hotel.

The staff were always attentive and willing to help though they have difficulty with understanding technological problems. The room we were in 151 had no wifi reception- the signal did not make it into the room. If I opened my door and walked into the corridor there was a weak signal but it did not make it into the room. I should add we were at the very end of a corridor, i.e. at the extremity of the hotel. Reception gave me the business password, even though my problem was no signal. A small thing, but if I was on business I‚Äôd want my wi-fi. I tried both an ipad mini and iPhone 3GS to receive the signal.

The other odd thing was the television. Someone else mentioned it does not match the welcome guide in the room. I agree with this. Odd channel ordering and odd channels to choose. On our tv the line up was

What is odd about this to my mind is that normally when staying in Ireland, the BBC is set to ‚ÄòNorthern Ireland‚Äô especially as channel 10 has an English variant if someone does not want to see BBC Northern Ireland programming. Channel 4 was missing despite having most of the other channels from C4. Reception of TG4 was very poor ‚Äì unwatchable at times. I can understand why someone posted that they had no programmes for their children ‚Äì RTE 2 is the only station that had programming. Why is RTE Jr not provided? Or CBBC/CITV? In other hotels in Ireland, it is usually common to have the BBC bouquet of channels : Three/Four/CBBC/Cbeebies/News which is an omission. The two blanks seemed to be broadcasting, they just weren‚Äôt broadcasting anything which implies that other stations could be rebroadcast. Does the hotel really need 2 BBC Ones? I also wondered if there is a necessity for the radio stations as the tv could receive radio. This model of tv may not be throughout the hotel which could be the issue.

Channel 15 upwards had badly stretched pictures but I reckon this feed gives the Sky Sports for the foyer to widescreen tvs so it‚Äôs a trade off of correct aspect ratio in the foyer against correct aspect ratio in the bedrooms on 4:3 tvs. 

The reception of radio on the tv (using the ‚ÄòRadio‚Äô button) wasn‚Äôt great but with a small amount of investment I think the hotel might have several stations tuned in for the pleasure of guests. I ‚Äòearthed‚Äô the tv by putting my finger in the coaxial slot under the tv (the left slot beside the where the cable went into the tv) and scanned and was able to store the following frequencies, listed below, covering RTE, and I believe most of the commercial stations (room 151). Without me earthing the tv, most stations fell to blank, though some were still managing to come through. I wonder if coaxial fly-leads (easily cost less than ¬£1) were purchased and linked from the set to the wall plate (though there may be no coaxial behind the plate as a cable to feed the tv stations comes from underneath the plate) if that would sufficiently earth the aerial to give lots of radio choice. If all tvs in the hotel have an option to receive radio, then RTE Radio 1 and 2FM would not need to be rebroadcast as tv stations.

223,The Best Of Irish Hospitality And Great Wedding Venue.,"We where five ladies who stayed  overnight in the Castleknock Hotel  on Friday the 1st of November 2013 as we where attending a Civil Ceremony. We had booked two rooms a twin and a triple, both rooms where warm,spotless and had all amenities, safe,iron,tea,coffee and mugs not cups which was lovely to get a mug for a change better then little cups. The CIvil Ceremony was at 3.30 pm there was a red carpet and lanterns leading in to the room which was lovely. After the Ceremony there was a reception in the sectioned off bar area with champagne, canap√É¬É√Ç¬É√É¬Ç√Ç¬É√É¬É√Ç¬Ç√É¬Ç√Ç¬©s and cup cakes. The main meal was perfect and the serving staff excellent. A special mention for Andrew for his good sense of humour , helpfulness and excellent customer care. The entire staff where every efficient, polite, and helpful nothing was to much trouble for them when they where asked for something. On check out the following morning I asked one of the girls for a brochure on their wedding packages. The girl gave me a bag with the brochure in side along with a candle and a small bottle of prosecco a lovely touch. From start to finish our stay was wonderful and this was made possible my the warm friendly welcoming staff  working in the hotel.

I would recommend the hotel also for Christmas Party nights as three years in a row we have had our staff Christmas night there.

223,"Perfect, a little gem","What a lovely hotel this and the customer service is excellent. We arrived early having flown from South Wales . I asked if there was a possibility we could check in early and  a room was found for us around 30 mins later and our bags transferred to our room.

We booked breakfast at the 9.95 euro deal for residents and it was good value . A full Irish , fruit, juice, cereals, pastries etc.....We also ate at the Park restaurant on the first evening on a set menu with a bottle of wine for 69 euros , again very nice.
The bar menu is also good value, the sandwiches were the best I've tasted. 
The rooms are comfortable , we did have a ridge in the middle of the bed! two twins I believe pushed together but quiet and the bathroom a decent size with a bath and shower for convenience.
What makes this hotel is the excellent customer service, having worked as management for years I know when customer service goes the extra mile.
A nice touch is a daily complementary drink on offer. One day iced tea, the next herbal teas ...

We travelled as a couple in half term, I work in a school and the hotel was full of children .There is a lovely adult only bar if you wish to escape but this hotel caters for young and the older element with ease.
We will be returning in the future .....",5,2013,11,03
223,Decent stay,"Stayed here for two nights for leisure. The lobby is nice, and I had high hopes for the rooms. We chose this property because of the price and because of the pool and hot tub. The rooms were fine, nothing special. The TV was old and small, not what I would expect from a four star hotel. To get to the pool, you have to walk through the lobby, so be aware of this (and cover up!) The hot tub is quite small, but the pool is nice. At one point we wanted to get room service, but there is a six euro charge for it- so we passed. Breakfast is not worth 16.95, so if you want the buffet in the morning, make sure you purchase it the night before for 9.95. We ate dinner from the bar menu both nights and it was pretty good and reasonably priced. On the weekends they have live music which is too loud for the atmosphere. 
The staff is really lacking in their customer service skills. It seems like they need some serious training at the front desk and in the restaurant. 
Overall, not quite up to par for a four star hotel, but still a nice stay.",3,2013,11,03
223,Perfect place to relax!,We have stayed here on numerous occasions and have never been disappointed! It's the perfect place for a relaxing stay...we love sitting in the open spacious lounge which is great for people watching! The food in The Park restaurant is fab...great selection! The staff in all areas are extremely friendly and look after us very well! Something for everyone here. Download their app on their website...great offers on there! Keep up the good work! Ann & Dave :-),5,2013,10,31
223,Stamp of approval!,"I stayed here for 2 nights with work, and enjoyed it. It's a lovely hotel and the front of house staff were delightful during check-in. Few issues with my room - a few bits were missing i.e., my robe and water, etc and it was very dark with no ceiling lights - only lamps that did not suffice. I ordered room service which was easily the best room service experience I have ever had. The food arrived quickly and was delicious. The second night I dined with my group under a set menu arranged for us, but the food was very poor. Breakfast was fantastic, and the staff there are wonderful. Especially the older lady who hosts - she is lovely. Variety for breakfast also top notch. I had a client ship boxes to me and the staff held them for me in a storage room until I needed to access them. This was very helpful, and nice of them. Room cleanliness was fine, but decor could have done with a slight sprucing - though nothing to complain about. All in all, a good stay, and i'd definitely go back. If at very least, for the wonderful staff! Don't expect to get anywhere without a taxi though...",4,2013,10,29
223,Very good hotel,"Attended a wedding and had an amazing weekend, pricing reasonable for such a top hotel! The rooms were comfortable but could have been a little bigger and the bathrooms were nice and modern. The staff were friendly and accommodating and the food was lovely. Worth a stay. ",4,2013,10,29

223,Brken promise,"Stayed here Sat night 7th Sept.  Nice hotel, ideal location for us.  We had booked room only, but decided on the Sunday to have breakfast.  Breakfast was OK, satisfactory, but at ‚Ç¨33.90 for 2 people it was very expensive.  When checking out we commented on the price and were told that as residents we could have bought vouchers for breakfast at ‚Ç¨9.95 each.  They offered to refund ‚Ç¨14 to our credit card.  We made 3 follow-up phone calls and on each occasion were promised a refund.  It has never been refunded",3,2013,10,26
223,super one night stay,"We stayed recently at the Castleknock hotel for one night and had an upgrade to a newly decorated Executive double room on the second floor. Lovely room with a fabulous view of the golf course.

Everything was spotless in the whole room including the en-suite bathroom with separate shower.

We had dinner that evening in the Park restaurant which was delicious and very good value for money.
Then there was entertainment provided with a singer.

The breakfast the following morning was again very good indeed.

We didn't get chance to use the spa facilities but hopefully we will in the future.

The staff were very good in Reception and nothing was too much trouble for them.

This is an excellent 4 star hotel and we have booked to return in January, this time to try out an Executive suite for a few days.

A great hotel very accessible to the airport and the city.",5,2013,10,26
223,disappointed,"We visited this hotel at Easter and had to book an interconnecting room 2adults and 3 young kids it cost 148 Euro for 1 night b&b we found the room clean comfortable and modern but there were no kids tv channels or dvd player to entertain them while we were getting ready or so that we could relax. I phoned reception and requested a dvd player to be told that these were only supplied in superior room I couldn't understand as we paid more for our room than a s/room I explained this to the receptionist she said she would get back to me but didn't.
We then went to the lounge for supper and sat for 10mins before a drinks order was taken when I asked for a food order to be taken the waiter said he would send someone over which never happened the waiter came back with 3 drinks instead of 5 and said he would be back with the other 2 drinks we sat for 45mins with 3 drinks no menu no food order and no service we were disgusted. We took the kids to tgi Fridays 1mile away a nd the service was amazing so attentive with the kids.
We also took the kids to the pool which isn't free because you have to buy the shower caps at 2Euro each and there was no life guard or pool attendant which is unusual.
I complained about the service at checking out to be brush off with busy time excuses and  I emailed the hotel after with no response. If you read my other reviews you can see I never complain and make the best out of every break but this was a mess.",1,2013,10,25
223,great value,"located in a rural area no traffic noise I was in a standard room nothing exceptional, robes missing and bedside lights but were immediately supplied when requested, Spa very average relaxation room poor, Jennifer (I think) therapist gives excellent massage although it was shorter than advertised,Breakfast and Dinner were good not exceptional. the value was exceptional 69 euro for dinner bed and breakfast with a bottle of wine between 2 and 15% off spa treatments, Lovely outdoor seating area at bar great in warm weather. Unfortunately for a rural location no walks one had to go out on the road to walk. Staff were exceptionally helpful and would encourage a revisit.",4,2013,10,24
223,3 sunny days golfing near Dublin,"For value for money Castleknock hotel takes some beating! My wiufe and I and our grown up son shared a room for 3 nights B & B .
 The room was luxurious ,modern, clean and comfortable.
The staff were exceptional-all smiles and alert.
Dee in charge of breakfast remembered our names and our breakfast preferences after the firsat morning.

The lovely gym sauna, steam room and swimming pool were super and the staff so friendly and helpful.

We also played the golf course attached to the hotel.Again in super condition with very interesting holes. Sadly we started too late in the day and had to leave the course after 9 as it was too dark.
next time we will spend more time on the course.

We also played: Druids Glen, The Island County Down and best of all by far  The European Club.",5,2013,10,23
223,"Okay, but not magic.","I'm rating this hotel on how good/bad it is with respect to the price I paid and the grade the hotel is meant to be. This is meant to be a 4 star hotel and I'm getting a super special offer for 90 Euros a night for an ""executive double"" room. 
There's been a few comments, e.g. b0nnieb00p's about the state of pillows, sheets and beds. I have to agree with them. My room had a king size bed which was made up of 2 joined beds, so it had a hard, raised line down the middle. The sheets were nearly as worn out and piled as my rental car, like they had 90,000 miles on them and weren't decent quality to start out with. Supplied pillows are like a rock with equally cheap/old covers. There is only one duvet, which feels like it's a really old thick, packed layer of felt or something. The rooms are also very warm, so if you like to sleep cooler this could be a problem, or maybe they are just gearing up for winter. Windows open though so you can cool the room down and take advantage of the heavy bedding.

The hotel's entrance and lobby is large with lots of use of marble/tiles. Reception is not the most immediate of desks and you have to navigate across to it. Staff are really friendly, super so. So all those comments about people trying to make your stay here nice, I would agree with.

The place has masses of rooms, but I think most people staying here don't use the bar or restaurant, they are quite small. And, my only encounters with evening meals and drinks hint at why that may be. As noted, the lobby is very open and has hard floors and walls, consequently, if you wanted to sit in the bar area to drink/eat, you are going to feel like it's noisy. I grabbed my food/beer and retreated to an unused part of the floor. And talking of food, I went simple and tried and tested the night I ate there, burger. You can't go wrong there can you ? Well, you can. It's the hotel's policy to take a nice piece of mince and cook the hell out of it. They only do well done, although the waiter did persuade me that this is still nice and juicy. I should have heeded my fears, the only way you cook a burger well done is to have it end up dry and like a rock heavy. You won't feel good after you eat one of these. Stay clear. The accompanying side faired little better, no dressing on the salad, just a pile of leaves like they came straight out of a package, and so-so fries which looked pre-cooked/prepped, and tasted the same. 

There is a decent pub a mile or so away (Wright's Anglers Rest), you'd be better off going to such a place and getting more atmosphere. You may end up with the same crap burger, but at least you got more of an Irish pub.

Breakfast in the hotel is pretty standard, nothing to rave about, but good enough to leave you happy and a decent amount of choice. Go for the tea over the coffee. 

The hotel also suffers from a few of my pet peeves. The main one is a feeling of oppressive endlessness, that is, the hotel has a lot of rooms and the corridors seem to stretch for ever. In this case the ceilings in corridors, at least on the 1st floor, are about 7ft high, low enough to touch without jumping or anything, and I'm under 6 feet. The ceilings in the room I had was higher, which made the rooms better. The corridors aren't too bad, there are clean and well lit, but still, feels like walking through a small cave passage that stretches on forever. Also, you hear the slushing water sounds from bathrooms above you (I was on the 1st floor with one above). I hate that in a hotel. Although doors are majorly thick and you really need to push to get them open, once inside you still heard people walking by if they were talking. So, poor insulation.

My room had some space, a large king size bed, tv, lighting, bathroom. The lighting in the room was weird. Some lights seemed to have no way to turn them on and off, I tried every switch I could find and ended up just unplugging it. One other switch didn't seem to do anything. There's a switch for a fan in the bathroom, but you'd be lucky to find it, it's up high by the door, near the ceiling ! If you don't spot it, the fan will run all night (someone else talked about that noise). There are many UK, 3 square pin, type receptacles in the bedroom. Problem is, a number of them don't work, and half require you to crawl under things to get to. But some work, and that's a good thing, and to help out I found a power block in one drawer.

TV in my room was a nightmare, and you'd be calling the technicians to fix it if you were at home. The TV list in the booklet was nothing like the way the TV was tuned, channels in all the wrong places and many less that advertised. Most annoyingly, the format of the picture delivered to the room was different than the TV would show, so, no matter how you played with it, you always got the left and right edges cutting off something, and it was obvious when there were titles, adverts etc. TV is very low quality picture too. So, low marks on that, and this was meant to be one of the features of upgrading to a ""newly refurbished executive"" room. Poor marks for that.

Bathroom was a mix of good and bad. Bath and separate shower. Nice bath. Shower was squeezed into a corner. Hot water, but the space left for the shower made you really careful of how you moved, and there's more than one bumped elbow occasion as you whack the wall. In general things to be used in the bathroom feel like they were crammed in, scattered along the walls. However there's plenty of space in the bathroom, but it's all empty in the middle. There was underfloor heating, not everywhere, just here and there, although it wasn't cold when I was there, so not really needed. There are other quirks and foibles, but the overall sense is that, yeah, it may look okay, but that's it, just okay.

So to sum up, if this is meant to be a 4 star hotel it doesn't really hit the mark, more like 3 star and just adequate. It looks nice, the staff are nice, but to get a higher mark from me it'll need lower prices or things tightening up in the rooms and better accommodation. They advertise that they got an award from AA for best hotel for 2013. That's got to be a joke, there are so many more fabulous hotels around in Ireland. However, if you think about it, they could have got this. It's a competition, and if only a few people enter, and if it costs too much to enter and takes too much time, why would you bother ? Anyway, go and look for yourself. The place is okay, if you need a hotel, but it's not magic, and for me, average at best for a decent hotel.",3,2013,10,23
223,Can't believe hotel's negative wedding reviews,"My husband and I have just returned, to Merseyside, from this fantastic hotel, after attending his niece's wedding. Yes, the hotel was very busy. but all the staff were friendly and attentive. The food at the wedding breakfast was hot and delicious. Some tables were served the main course after we'd finished ours but this was more to do with the number of guests than the slow service.
Our bedroom  was immaculate, with lovely added touches such as bathrobes and slippers.
The room overlooked the golf course and duck pond and was very spacious.
The spa was luxurious and there was ample parking. 
On the first night we dined in the restaurant and decided on the meal for two, which included a free bottle of wine. At 69 Euros it was great value and the food was of a very high standard. Our meal cost in total 85 Euros as we paid extra for the fillet steak medallions  and the cheese board. Well worth the price
The food choices for breakfast couldn't be faulted (unless you're very picky or choosy).
We took the ferry over and the hotel is within easy driving distance from the port.
My husband and I would love to return to this lovely hotel in the near future.
Thank you Castleknock Hotel for a fabulous three day stay.",5,2013,10,19
223,October visit,"Had to travel to Dublin for 2 days at short notice, got a good deal when i rang hotel. Day one was my birthday and husband had told hotel, had a card chocolates and cake for me in the room, very nice touch!
Husband and son came to visit first night and had beautiful meal in hotel. So nice i brought colleague out the next night to taste the steak again.
room OK spacious and bed comfy. Downside the taps didn't work on bath properly, mentioned to desk staff but wasn't fixed when i came back from conference, however came immediately when I rang, so i got my bath the second night (had separate shower cubicle so wasn't too fussed).
Would definitely recommend, colleagues stayed in Clarion dearer and this was streets ahead. Helpful staff gave good directions to miss M50 toll too! will come again now i know where it is!",4,2013,10,19
223,Ugh.  Major League Uncomfortable Beds and Pillows,"My husband and I stayed here for a conference he was attending.  All I can say is that if you have to stay here, be sure to request a different pillow than the ones they provide (there is a pillow menu -- why they don't give you one of the more comfortable pillows to start with, I don't know).  We got in late and collapsed in bed for a good night sleep.  Ha!  Between the uncomfortable mattress, the bedding that was pilled and gave me the creeps, and the hard-as-rocks pillows, we didn't sleep a wink.  The first thing I did in the morning was to request a down pillows, instead of the rock hard ones on our bed.  The hotel itself is nothing to write home about.  I went out for a walk and was turned back by the signs that informed me I wasn't welcome to walk on the green, as I would get in the way of the golfers.  Please.  The reception desk was ill informed, slow, and uninterested -- a bad omen for a hotel if there ever was one.  Skip this place if you can.  It's not worth a dollar for a bad night's sleep, in my opinion.",2,2013,10,17
223,Fantastic location for weekend away,"This hotel really was beautiful, fantastic location. Easy to drive into central Dublin, close to Phoenix Park and just stunning. Staff were very good. Rooms were boutique style and very spacious. Altogether, wonderful value for money.",5,2013,10,17

223,Excellent hotel with superb service,"The hotel staff were helpful and always attentive. The grounds were lovely. My room looked out over the golf course and I enjoyed that. The food was excellent all day, while I attended a conference, coffee breaks through a five course dinner. The formal dining room was beautiful. The room had a spacious desk and a clean, well maintained bathroom. The bed was comfortable. The pool and gym looked to be very good, as well. The hotel was busy but never felt crowded or cramped. I would definitely recommend this property to others.",4,2013,10,16
223,Wonderful experience,"We spent from Oct. 3 to Oct. 11 2013 at this lovely hotel.  The staff were all very friendly and went over & above the call of duty to help in any way they could.  The room was clean and comfortable. Breakfast was good and the lady in charge of breakfast was exceptional - she even brought us fruit as we were leaving at 6 am.  I would recommend this hotel to even the most ""demanding"" people.  Only one negative:  the carrot/ginger soup was terrible.",5,2013,10,13
223,"Can't fault it, you will enjoy.","Superb stay in very comfortable surroundings. Bedrooms are a wee bit wider than the average, makes a huge difference-you just feel you have much more space. Pillow menu? Wow. Just wow...as a feather allergy sufferer this is actually important. Good sized laptop safe in the room. Wifi...free...works pretty well...in rooms as well as lobby. 
The spa is ok, changing rooms a little tired and (it's 5 years since I was last there) still they have too many edicts upon the walls. 
But back to the hotel...brilliant staff, comfortable bright surroundings, leafy lane ways to bus stops. And views of golfers messing up the shot across the water. What more can you ask for. Didn't have any food so can't comment on that. 
Final words. It's a little awkward to find off the M50 and the car park is gated with separate entrance and exit points. 
Overall, highly recommended. ",5,2013,10,13
223,Just won AA Hotel of the Year - not surprised,"Castleknock Hotel and Spa just won AA Hotel of the Year and this seems to have been well deserved.  Their attention to detail was very good even offering a variety of pillows! The welcome from Marie the receptionist was probably the best ever on checking in to a hotel. With a lovely smile she explained everything in great detail, drawing us maps of where to go for a walk and giving us comprehensive information on where to get the bus into the city, cost, timetable etc.  We ate in the hotel both nights with a 3 course dinner plus tea or coffee for 37.50 Euros pp. The food was very good quality with local produce. We enjoyed it so much we returned the following evening to find that since it was before 7pm we could have the same menu including a bottle of wine for 66 Euros for two - even better!  They also do an early bird menu without the wine which is even cheaper.  Breakfast was varied and good.  We did have a minor problem on day 2 regarding breakfast, but the waitress in charge was very helpful and chef came out and spoke to us.  All in all the staff were friendly and attentive.  The Spa was lovely and a special mention to Connie for the wonderful back massages! I would definitely reccommend this hotel and would like to return in the future.",5,2013,10,11
223,Wonderful,"Myself and my two daughters stayed in this hotel for almost 2 weeks, it is first class.   We had a fabulous time in Ireland visiting friends and family.  The hotel was beautiful, with a very professional and friendly staff.   The beds were very comfortable.  Breakfast was great every morning, and the lady in charge was extremely helpful.  There was only one thing missing,  a small fridge for the room.  I would definitely stay there again, and recommend it to anyone.",5,2013,10,10
223,A great venue for a family of friends night away,"A group of six ladies having a reunion.really enjoyed the experience of Castleknock Hotel. Room very comfortable, they even had a pillow menu so I was able to ask for my down pillow!.
We enjoyed a pre dinner drink in the bar and Isobel looked after us so so well. 
The dinner was excellent and the house wine was really good . 
The spa was most enjoyable. The only thing I would ask for is a step up to the Jacussi. It was a very high step for anyone but I am recovering from a hip replacement and I was really nervous.",5,2013,10,09
223,Exceptional,"The hotel has an impressive, grand entrance and reception. Clearly proud of a) it's mainly well-deserved awards and b) it's strong rugby and golf association. Staff could not have been nicer. We were checking in at 2am and they were very professional throughout.  A special mention to Andrew, who was so kind and courteous to bring up some warm milk and extra sheets for my 3 year old daughter at 2.30am!!

The was a wedding wrapping up at the time and we were worried that the noise from the party would reach our rooms.. No need. None of the 11 of us could hear a thing.

Next morning the breakfast buffet was great with loads of options. Take no notice of any harsh reviews about food quality. It's fantastic and so were the staff members serving. 

Rooms were tidied promptly and none of our five rooms had any housekeeping troubles. Inside the rooms we had spacious large beds, which were very comfortable. Each room had a sofa which opens up to a very comfy bed also. TV options were limited but we didn't really care about that, who watches tv that much in a hotel anyway when you have free WiFi.

The bathroom was also roomy with a bath and separate shower cubicle. There was also a trouser press and a very good iron and ironing board (they know most of their guests are going to attend a wedding or function which requires neat clothes).

All in all, the eleven of us spent most of the time praising this hotel. None of us could understand how anyone could be so petty to pick on minor details like bread rolls when the hotel and staff tick so many boxes. Maybe they are expecting every single hotel in the world to be like Claridges or The Waldorf Astoria, but whilst paying cheaper prices. Sorry, the world does not work that way.",5,2013,10,06
223,Nice Hotel + Golf Course,"Well appointed genuine 4 Star Hotel with a good range of dining options to suit a wide variety of tastes & budgets. Good location only a short distance from central Dublin &  all the  main tourist attractions,  theatres etc - a sat nav is helpful.  Adjoining Golf Course is a challenging test of controlled golf with both the Course & Clubhouse facilities maintained to a high standard - well worth playing with Hotel guests made to feel welcome.",4,2013,10,06
223,Lovely hotel,"I can't even count the amount of times I've stayed at this hotel now.. Im quite fond of it!

Im from Dublin and currently live in Carpenterstown and still stay over when i have the chance!

My most recent stay was 'free' due to points built up on my FBD loyalty card (Which also included the breakfast), plus because it was my birthday the rewards club offered me a bottle of house wine!
Not only that, when we got to the hotel there was a birthday card and some chocolates there from the hotel also.

I usually go for the executive rooms when possible for that extra bit of luxury but my most recent time it was a standard double which is fine also.
Love the bathrooms and the toiletries.

This was actually the first time i have availed of the use of the pool etc and i can't fault it. Lovely pool area with big windows etc. Nice jacuzzi/sauna/steam room etc..
Only thing is I wish there was a Separate entrance so that we didn't have to walk through reception/lobby area but a small complaint.

Due to the AA award staff were giving out free sparkling wine.. We passed as we were just coming out of the gym.. on the way back down they were packing away :( 

We were running late for dinner and when we went down we were seated in the park resturant even though we called for reservations in the brasserie.. Not sure if this was because the brasserie was closed?
Anyway it was my first time eating in the Park and I don't think i will be returning.. Decor is lovely but food i think is overpriced.. Brasserie in my opinion is much nicer for the price.

Breakfast was buffet style and plentiful. Staff serving were also very nice.

From my experience the reception staff absolutely make this hotel.. The staff i have dealt with previously were Valerie and I think Nicola? Very nice to deal with both in person and via email.

Yet again i will definitely return to this hotel the next time i need a bit of 'Me' time!!",4,2013,09,30
223,Very disappointing,"My partner treated me with a night out DBB in an exec suite. It took 2 hours for 3 course meal we were starving when our first course arrived after 45 min! We were told there was a big table so we came after! 
While we waited we had bread mine was quite hard but my partner's white bread was worse as if it had been put in the oven a few times. You can find better in your staff canteen at work. 
Salmon rillette was good but after that long a wait not exceptional. I enjoyed the hake well we had ordered the vegetarian option but there was none and we were not given the opportunity to have another vegetarian option! Potatoes Anna were overcooked. Dessert came after only 20 mins wait and was warm brownie, the inside was cold so we left half of it!
While I went to complain I talked to a few guests and they had the same experience! We were given free drinks as a good Will gesture which was nice.
It is a disappointment for a restaurant which features in the guide Michelin!
We had planned for another nite away from home but will think again about the venue!",3,2013,09,30
223,AA Hotel of the Year,"Just back from a 3 night stay in this lovely hotel. All the staff were delightful and the service terrific. Had one dinner included in our package and it was really lovely. I am  coeliac and there was a good choice for me on the menu. Great seating in this hotel with pianist playing there last night who was excellent. Quiet areas as well on landings and good room service menu. Really delighted that this hotel has won the AA award . This is our second visit and it did not disappoint.

The only small problem which I had was that it is a bit difficult to find without a Sat Nav We were asked for directions  to the M50 this morning when we were leaving and the woman had to follow us out as we had a Sat Nav. More signage would be a good idea.",5,2013,09,27
223,Decent Place,"Stayed for 2 nights in Sept. Upon arrival we were allowed to check into our room early which was a plus but it was one of the few during our stay. The bed consisted of two singles pushed together with an uncomfortable ridge down the middle which is not fun to sleep on as a couple. But we did not get much sleep as a Wedding Reception was located directly under our room and the smoking balcony outside our window. We rang the front desk at midnight and the manager told us we should never had been put in that room as it was directly above the music and the music would be on till 3 AM. The manager was not able to move us as the hotel was booked. He offered us breakfast but that was a small consolation for 3 hours of music and smokers. The next morning we went down for our breakfast and were pleasantly surprised at the selection and quality of food. The hotel also sits on the back of the golf course and is very scenic, so the views while eating breakfast from the back room were lovely. 

Besides the noise and uncomfortable bed, the hotel is in a great location right outside of Dublin that tricks you into thinking you are in the countryside while the hotel is still close to shopping and the highway.",3,2013,09,25
223,Fantastic in every way !,"I came here with my husband and our three boys aged 5 4 and 1 1/2 yrs. I couldn't find a fault we had a fantastic time the kids loved it. Rooms service food were great. The staff couldn't do enough for us. The play area was perfect.  Super close to zoo and 20 mins from Tayto park.  Looking forward
 going again next year. I would tell anyone not to hesitate you will not be disappointed!!!! ",5,2013,09,17
223,Brilliant!,"Just spent for nights here after having to leave our holiday apartment early.  Hotel is set in lovely countryside, right beside the golf course. Public areas aremodern and relaxing although there were quite a few kids around. There is a separate bar area for adults only, but was never open while we were there, just a sign directing guests to the main bar. 
Restaurant and bar staff were fantastic and could not do enough for you. Reception staff were also good but not as friendly or welcoming. 
The hotel advertising makes great play on it's golf course and there was even a card in the room advising special rates on green fees for hotel guests. We were told that the golf course though, is now unrelated to the hotel and I certainly did not get a special rate on the green fee. 
All in all a nice place to stay! ",4,2013,09,13
223,fabulous stay,"Had a fabulous stay for two nights at this hotel with my niece, the staff were very helpful and welcoming, we had lovely treatments in the spa and enjoyed the pool facilities. The bar staff were very attentive, particularly Brendan, nothing was too much trouble to ensure we had great service, food was lovely and good value, breakfast was very good. Good location and base away from the city centre, but able to travel there by bus, car or taxi, fairly near to pheonix park and Dublin Zoo.
Elegant and relaxed hotel, I would definately stay again and woud recommend it.",5,2013,09,09
223,ok hotel,"Went for a over night trip with the girls to the hotel, we had treatments in the spa and cannot fault the spa it was perfect and the staff were lovely.  The room was clean and we asked for an ice bucket and glasses to be sent to our room when we checked in and it arrived within a few minutes.  We had booked in for a meal as part of the deal.  Only fault I had with that was I ordered soup and it did not come with bread or a roll I had to ask for it.  I stayed in the hotel before and I was offered a variety of bread.
The lobby of the hotel were the bar is had live music which was great but the bar service and cocktails were not great at all.  We were standing at the bar for a while the bar staff avoided eye contact a man staying the hotel got the bar staff to serve us.  The cocktails were horrible the lounge girl was very nice and got them changed for us but they were still undrinkable very disappointed with them as they are all part of a girly weekend.
 The next morning after breakfast we went up onto the first floor and right beside the lifts there looked like a group of children were getting some sort of lessons.  There must have been about 20 kids it was a bit strange I called my friends and the woman who was teaching the class stopped talking to give me look for me ‚Äòto be quiet‚Äò!.  Don‚Äôt know what was going on but if that was a teaching class then they should be in private room and not in a public area of a hotel I felt uncomfortable in the area.  I had not seen any of these kids the day before in the hotel or at breakfast.",3,2013,09,01
223,A great family hotel,"Just spent 7 days at the hotel, 3rd time we've been there and it was just fantastic. The location is beautiful and suited us as our family is in Blanchardstown. Wanted to stay a week and found best value was to take 2 of their special packages, one for 3 days and one for 4 day. This worked out really economical as it included a large family room, very nicely appointed and plenty of space, great breakfast every day and an adult dinner one of the nights (2 dinners on the 4 night package). You can eat in the lovely restaurant or get equivalent value for bar food in the very spacious bar area. 
We also got family tickets to Dublin Zoo which is wonderful and on the 2nd package I opted for the spa treatment and had a lovely manicure at the spa. They even changed my toe nail polish for free!
The staff are lovely and everything was very efficient. They even made sure we were able to stay in the same room for all of our stay despite checking out and in again on day 3! The room was always cleaned and made up early in the day and was spotless. 
The hotel can be very busy with lots of weddings but still manages to stay calm and refined. It doesn't have air con in the rooms (not sure why for a modern hotel) so if you overlook the front and are above the function room you do get some noise if there's a wedding. 
There is a lovely playground for the kids and the pool area is great (swim hats must be worn). 
All in all a very elegant but really relaxed hotel. We had a great time!",5,2013,08,29
223,Very comfortable and clean,I was here for a family wedding the hotel had all you could need in terms of cleanliness and comfort the staff were very friendly and the rooms were big spacious with every amenity however the hotel was too warm in general and everyone else found this was the case at least our rooms were supplied with a fan the only other down side was the service it was extremely slow both at the bar and in the restaurant luckily we were a large group and had plenty of Craic regardless the service at the wedding meal was top notch so that was the main thing üòú,5,2013,08,27
223,"Indifferent staff, HAIR in the bath and noise at 3am!","My partner and I were ""treated"" to a stay at the Castleknock hotel during the Mumford and Sons concert in June. After reading several reviews of the hotel that commented on rooms not being ready at check-in, I was slightly concerned, as we had a tight schedule for checking in before heading over to the concert. However, I tried to convince myself that everything would be fine; after all, surely such a large hotel would be equipped to deal with a busy weekend.

I was wrong. We arrived at 3:15pm (as check-in was at 3pm) after several bus journeys from Belfast, looking forward to a quick shower and change of clothes before heading out again; we were brusquely greeted by a mardy-faced receptionist, who told us a room wasn't available for us yet. When I asked how long the room would be, I was told with a shrug, ""Ah, probably an hour or so."" When I explained that we had to leave again soon to go to our concert, I got another shrug and was told we could leave our bags beside the check-in desk and head on whenever we liked. All the while, the receptionist beside us was checking in guests and handing out room keys like there was no tomorrow! We actually heard her talking to somebody on her walkie-talkie about three or four other rooms that were free for guests to head up to! 

When we said we weren't really happy about leaving our bags out in the open (our cheerful friend had gestured to the side of the check-in desk, where there were people hanging around and milling about, and could easily have swiped our stuff unnoticed), she said she was ""pretty sure"" our stuff would be ok. Not really reassured, and feeling more disgruntled by the second, I gave up and went to get changed in the toilets. We surreptitiously tucked our bags behind the desk, and headed off, with some unease, to our concert.

Upon our return at 11:30pm, we were told that our bags had been taken up to our room, and were given our key by a rather surly night porter. We were satisfied with the standard of the room, and, given we hadn't had a chance to refresh upon our initial arrival, I decided to have a bath before bed. I was horrified to find several black, curly hairs strewn in plain sight on the bottom of the bath! I couldn't bring myself to brave the tub, and hurried to bed to surrender myself to blissful unconsciousness, hoping to wake in the morning to a vastly improved bathroom experience.

As the room was stiflingly hot, we opened the windows before going to bed, only to be awoken at 3am by (I can only assume) kitchen or bar staff emptying a mountain of glass bottles from one bin into another. I understand that work must be done in the kitchens and bar; working in a restaurant myself, I get that these things are necessary, and have no problem with staff doing their jobs. But at three o'clock in the morning?"" Really? Surely, having not accomplished this task earlier in the evening, the movement of the bottles could have waited until breakfast time? The racket continued for a good twenty minutes, and needless to say my beauty sleep was well and truly broken.

We arose, haggard and disgruntled, in time to check out (we didn't have breakfast with our room option). I mentioned to the receptionist who handled our checking out (different from our grumpy friend from the previous day) that our room hadn't been ready upon our arrival, and she informed us that, due to the concert on in the city centre, they had a full house and so the rooms would never have been ready at check-in time, so there was nothing to be done about it.

What?! First of all, surely they knew ahead of time that the hotel was fully booked, and should have arranged to have enough staff on to ensure an increased workload. Secondly, even if they were understaffed, check-out is at 12pm; that gives them three hours to sort out the rooms. Thirdly, the receptionist next to us was checking in other guests at a furious rate, so there definitely were rooms available; our receptionist clearly just couldn't be bothered making the effort to find us one!

I was disappointed when the receptionist didn't even apologise for the situation; it would have helped a bit and made me feel a little less annoyed. She offered us ""complimentary tea or coffee"" in the lobby to make up for the room not being ready, which (as I had read in our welcome brochure the night before) was offered to all guests anyway! Unbelievable. My partner was becoming embarrassed by my outrage by this point, so we left without availing ourselves of our doubly complimentary beverages.

I would like to say, if anybody at the Castleknock ever reads these reviews, that I was very disappointed with our stay; it is not the fault of guests if the hotel is full or understaffed, and if it is the case that check-in will be later than stated on the booking confirmation, an email informing guests wouldn't go amiss (as surely the management should know how long it takes to turn rooms around). Also, perhaps the receptionists should receive a crash course in how to deal with guests sympathetically and politely, and not rub them up the wrong way from the minute they arrive. Lastly, the cleaning staff should be taught that leaving hair in the bath is unacceptable - if I noticed them after a long day of concerting, surely they did, especially as they had an extra hour (at least) to clean our room. 

I don't enjoy leaving bad reviews, as I am generally easy to please; I have worked in the customer service industry for nearly ten years and understand that the public can be a pain. However, I pride myself on making every effort to ensure that customers have a positive experience; if only the Castleknock hotel had the same attitude.",2,2013,08,18
223,"Friendly Staff, superb food and great cocktails!",stayed with 2 friends on girls night in package! had lovely room. Spa was really relaxing with lovely staff! Dinner was amazing....staff really helpful and friendly! Swmming pool was bright and clean! Lounge and Bar in the evening relaxing with good atmosphere! Would 100% stay again!,5,2013,08,18
223,Fab stay!,"Stayed for a work conference & so glad I did. 
The hotel is in a great location, close to the city but on really nice grounds so its feels more country like.
It's modern, very clean, great facilities & the food is excellent.
I would certainly stay again for leisure as well as business.
Got upgraded to a suite so very pleased too!!

223,Another Wonderful Stay,"Just back after another wonderful stay in Castleknock. Never fails to impress myself and my partner each time. Enjoyed the Summer Lovin' package over two nights and stayed for the third too! Food as brilliant as previous experience, we ate two nights in the restaurant, one with our package meal and the other with their special Wine & Dine Menu.

 Tonic Spa wonderful haven to relax in, with very friendly staff. We found the waiting service in the lobby at night time to be very good and staff very attentive to their guests. Special note to the girl in the lobby on bank holiday Sunday night who's name badge read 'Trainee'. Definitely deserves a spot on the team at Castleknock!
Hope to return in the near future!",5,2013,08,14
223,Love this hotel,As the title says I love this hotel. It feels like its on the country with the most lovely views from the rooms. Fabulous bed. So comfortable!  The staff are very friendly and helpful.  Great facilities too and the food is just amazing!  The restaurant is pricey but its so worth it for a treat b a night off from the kids!  Will stay here again and again!,5,2013,08,13
223,Always very impressed!,"This hotel and its gym/spa facilities are one of the very best in the country. I am regular visitor to this hotel and the customer service from all the staff on my visits has always been exceptional!

Keep up good work guys!",4,2013,08,13
223,Local but not impressed at all,"Booked a spa package and on arrival we were informed by a very snooty receptionist that the pool was not in use and was not even slightly apologetic about it. Considering we had gone there for the spa that was appalling to hear. We were told we could use the pool at the national aquatic centre which is ten minutes away. I live locally in castleknock and it is not ten minutes away by any stretch of the imagination. this was my first experience here and it started off very poorly. Went for something to eat in the bar, very rude staff most of whom did not have a very good command of the English language which I would have expected at the very least. Most of the time the staff were huddled together talking. Food was not great either and overpriced for what it was. Overall not happy whatsoever with my experience and none of us will not be returning any time soon or would I recommend it to anyone.",1,2013,08,12
223,Lovely Spa,"We visited the Spa during a girls weekend and found it a great venue! They have a jaccuzzi, a steam room, a sauna and pool. All were lovely and clean, as were the changing rooms and it wasn't too crowded when we were there so we had a relaxing time altogether (10 of us). Some of us also had treatments: the hot stone massage is to die for and the Swedish massage was firm and invigorating.
Staff we informative and friendly and although we ran late at lunch, they were able to accommdoate our treatment times.
We would defintiely reccommend this venue.
I've scored it 4 as we didn't see the rest of the hotel or stay in the rooms... Also the staff at lunch were not very efficient, espeicaly compared to those in the spa.",4,2013,08,12
223,Awful experience,"Well we arrived at the hotel to find out the pool was not in use. We informed the woman at reception that we were not made aware of this prior to arriving. We where told if we wanted to speak to a manager we could. We spoke to the manger at the time and she said we could use the national aquatic centre which is 10 minutes away in a car. My wife said she would look well pulling up in her slippers and dressing gown. The manager then got a bit annoyed and told us she would not be giving us two free nights to which my wife replied she didn't want 2 free nights she only wanted a swimming pool in the hotel we booked. The manager did apologise and said she would take care of the bill in the aquatic centre. Our point was we would have booked somewhere else if we had of known about the pool! Any we then went for dinner included in our package. Order a sirloin steak for main course medium ‚Ç¨5 extra for steak anyhow got my steak and guess what it was wellllllllll done so I sent it back. My wife and child ate away and then my steak came out again and it was even more well done. I called the waiter over and asked him to look at the steak to show him it was well done. His response was baffling. He turned around and looked at all the other people in the restaurant and said no one else is complaining, I ate about half of it just to eat. The manager of the restaurant then came over at the end of the meal and asked was everything ok, I said not really the steak was overcooked she looked at it and agreed with me she then asked would I like another one and I said nope, I was leaving the restaurant when a 8 foot advert outside was promoting it as a steak house. I'm telling you all now as a chef and as a human being the food was terrible crap. So that's it so far we are only here 8 hours paying ‚Ç¨200 a night in a suite and this is what you have to put up with. It's a load of üòÅ",1,2013,08,11
223,Poor front of house. Pool not on offer,"Had a poor 4 night stay in Castlenock hotel. Booked in family for 4 night stay, 2 adults, 4 yr old, 3 yr old and 6 months. Hotel is well appointed, good location reasonable food but service is very poor in general. Notified on arrival on thurs evening August 8th by rude receptionist about pool being unavailable, very disappointing given this been a major reason for selecting hotel. Offered alternative pool in NAC but realistically not an option with young kids. Not really satisfactory and set a negative tone to the break. Would go some where else next time rather than Castlenock Hotel for family break in Dublin. Also other pet hates, late check available at rate of 10 euro and hour. ",2,2013,08,11
223,Pool Out of Bounds,So myself and 3 friends booked the spa package for one night which was to include full use of the pool. When we arrived at the hotel we were not informed at reception that the pool was closed. There was instead a sign up telling us. We were offered absolutely no compensation for the fact that we could not use the pool and a member of the pool reception was very rude saying 'well I can offer you - an apology' - in a very rude tone. It was really disappointing and there were so many families with young children who were very disappointed. Some form of compensation should have been offered and the fact that it wasn't shows that this hotel scores a ZERO on customer care - all it was after was our money - not bothered about our stay and the fact that we booked a spa package and then had no access to the pool. I would definitly NEVER return. I would also warn others about staying in a hotel were customer satisfaction is not a priority. Very back PR move.,1,2013,08,09
223,Worth it for the dinner,"The hotel itself could do with a make over. Dining tables scuffed and walls marked etc. The service was great most of the time but lacked the attention to detail that could make this a great place to stay. Things like the waitress wiping crumbs off a table on to the floor an example of how the hotel could improve things. Evening meal in the restuarant  however was the highlight of my stay. The service was excellent and the food, wow!! I forgive all that had gone before just for the food and service that night. I had turned down the wine list prior to my starter being served but after the way it was presented and the taste, I felt compelled to order a bottle and enjoy what was to come. Not one of the courses disappointed. A superb meal and for me the highlight of my stay",4,2013,08,06
223,Lovely stay and great value offers on the website,"It's four years since my last stay at Castleknock Hotel & Country Club.   I was delighted to see recently that the excellent standards in the hotel have been kept right up to scratch.  The leisure centre is showing slight signs of wear and tear but more about this later as it was not a big issue.

We booked two rooms in July for a two night 'Summer Lovin' package (try saying that to the nice girl in reservations without giggling!), and apart from being very good value IMO, it exceeded my expectations.

Firstly, I must say what a joy it is to be able phone the hotel and speak to a human in reservations who I am certain is actually employed by the hotel and not to some disinterested teenager in a call centre.  She was very helpful and the booking and the package was explained very clearly.

I booked two nights B&B, with dinner on one night and two free drinks.  That was ‚Ç¨102 per person sharing.  They also upgraded us to an executive room.  This also gives you unlimited access to the leisure centre and gym.   I thought it was very good value, and would entice me to return in a hearbeat.

Location:  The Location is good from the point of view of parking.   Parking is secure and safe.   If you want to be right in Dublin city centre, this is not the place for you, but if you want quick access to Phoenix Park, the Zoo, Farmleigh House etc, then it couldn't be better.  It is also very easy to find and access the M50 from the hotel.

Check in:  Was simple and the receptionist was very friendly and explained everything in a matter of minutes.

Checkout:  Equally friendly.

WiFi:  Is free.  They will give you the code you need on check in.  The only thing for me was that the WiFi in my room was dreadfully slow during my stay.   However I believe they had some issue with the technology during my stay.  It was not a concern for me as I was on a leisure trip, but it would have impacted greatly on me had it been a business stay.  However I am sure reception would have sorted something out for me very quickly had the issue continued.

The room:  Was a good old walk from the lifts but this did not concern us.  We were in 142 and 144.   I could not fault the rooms.  They were excellent, and the view over the golf course was a bonus (even though I'm not a golfer).   They had everything you would need for a comfortable stay, spotlessly clean and a fine big bathroom with both bath and separate shower.   Our safe didn't work when we got to the room.   Contacted reception and they had it sorted in minutes - literally.  A HUGE bed was magnificent,  I felt like Henry VIII !!!

The Food:  We ate at 'The Brasserie' and because we were on a package, I expected that the food would be bog standard 'package' fare, lashed out to us by grumpy waiters.    WHAT a surprise when it transpired that we were served a three course meal of gourmet standard, in the beautiful surroundings of the Brasserie, all served up to us by a bevy of professional, friendly and helpful staff.  However, more about that later as the Brasserie deserves a whole review all to itself.   I will summarise here though with three words 'BRAVO BRAVO BRAVO'

Breakfast.   Breakfast is a self service affair, though tea and coffee is delivered to your table.   I could not fault the breakfast, it had everything you would need in a breakfast and it was good.  Staff there bend over backwards to make sure everyone has a table even at peak periods, and nothing seems to be any trouble for them.

Bar:  The bar area is part of the large bright, modern yet comfortable lobby.  We ate in the bar on night two, and unfortunately had been spoiled by our night one meal in the Brasserie.   The service in the bar was slow (30 minute wait for main course)  though the female server was very apologetic about this.  The bar staff were friendly enough, but maybe need to take a few lessons from other members of staff.  The food in the bar was fine, I would categorise it as standard hotel bar food.  We had a mediocre fish and chips, a VERY mediocre Chicken Tikka Masala which lacked in much flavour and a very large and wet Chicken Caesar Salad.  It was lucky we were hungry, as that was the only reason we almost cleaned our plates.

Staff:  There has been a very marked improvement in staff attitude.  Last time I was there, staff were not too friendly.   This time, I noticed that the vast majority of staff were friendly and helpful.  Hats off to reception staff, and to a very nice female ma√Ætre d' (can I describe her as mature with spectacles!!!), who as far as I am concerned epitomises what good customer service is all about.  Well done spectacle lady (wish I remembered your name).  I hope they are paying you well for your welcoming and professional attitude.  Also to the Restaurant staff in general, none of whom I could fault.  Housekeeping were also very friendly and at the very least said ""Good Morning"" when we passed by.  They also did an excellent job in servicing the rooms.

Sleep:  I slept very well.   There were no night-time noises to disturb me though it was mid week so that might have helped.  If you do want to stay there at a weekend, there are plenty of good rooms enough distance away from the conference centre that will be quiet. 
It was nice to see too, that even though it was mid week the hotel was doing a brisk trade.

Leisure Centre and Gym.
I could see areas for improvement here as it is getting a little tired now.  I can't say that it was dirty, it wasn't, but it was certainly looking tired and an overuse of warning and information signs is a bit irritating.  They could at least get them professionally printed.   However as this facility is open to the public I guess it gets a lot of use   It did not stop me making full use of it though.

Families:  I notice the hotel is very popular with families.  It is nice to see that the hotel has no problem catering for them and I could see as well as the golfing community the hotel is well set up for family groups and staff equally so.

Overall, a well deserved 5 for CH&CC.   I have no doubt that the continued good standards are being maintained due to the watchful eye of GM Guy Thompson who has been at the helm there for a few years now.   At one stage, I saw him fluff up a few cushions on a sofa in the lobby as he passed by, another time he was checking out the leisure centre.  I guess it is this attention to detail that makes the CH&CC a popular with visitors and locals alike.

A most enjoyable stay and YES, I'll be back.",5,2013,08,04
223,Great service food not great,"Stayed here on a one night package,reception staff and general service is top class,had 4 course meal in park restuarant and it was very standard fare!breakfast was average also,room had no air Con but had a fan,free wifi",4,2013,08,04
223,Short Family Break,"I spent four nights at The Castleknock Hotel where I travelled with my Mother, Nana and Sister. It was a fantastic experience, the hotel is very well maintained and we had a wonderful welcome from the Reception staff on arrival. They were particularly helpful and went out of their way to ensure we had a great stay. They even arranged for us to check in a little early (as we arrived at 12 noon) The rooms were fantastic, and had everything we needed. I thoroughly recommend paying for the executive rooms, which come with robes, slippers, dvd players, straighteners, and a docking station for iPod‚Äôs/iPhone‚Äôs. The views over the golf course are wonderful, however the roof of the building is pretty ugly to look at and does spoil the view somewhat (perhaps they could be made into a feature and covered in grass or something). We each had a spa treatment, which we all enjoyed and found to be reasonably priced. The swimming area was pretty busy while we were there, and we discovered that you have to wear swimming caps when you use the facilities. Sadly the restaurant and bar were what let this hotel down. Service was poor and, being gluten intolerant I didn‚Äôt feel there was a wide range of choices for me to eat (I was also shocked when one of the waitresses told me everything on the menu was gluten free ‚Äì biscuits, bread, pasta! Good job I know which foods to avoid otherwise I would have spent the trip in agony!) We were left waiting over 40 minutes for dessert and coffee despite the restaurant being practically empty. It was a real shame as otherwise I couldn‚Äôt fault the trip. On the plus side, breakfast was pleasant and there was a nice variety of foods (including GF bread on request).

Taxi‚Äôs to Dublin were fairly expensive ‚Äì around 25 Euro‚Äôs both ways. There was however a bus (number 37) that you could catch which was about a 5 minute walk from the hotel. If you do one trip whilst in Dublin, I really recommend the trip to Wicklow Mountains which was run by Day Tours Unplugged. The scenery is stunning and they stop off at a location that is frequently used for filming (they were even filming TV Series ‚ÄúThe Vikings‚Äù whilst we were there)

All in all a lovely hotel which I would have given 5* if the quality of service in the restaurant and bar was improved.",4,2013,07,30
223,My favourite hotel in Eire,"I just love staying here. Always on business thus far, but I would like to bring the family over as this place is just lovely. Really great staff, gorgeous spacious rooms, lovely shower, very comfortable bed, wi-fi in all rooms, a great bar and terrace and a brilliant menu and wine list. The breakfast is amazing. Lovely pool and steam room. Highly recommend for business stays and from what I have seen a family would have a ball too.",5,2013,07,29
223,Fine but probably wouldn't return.,"Stayed here as family with three young children. Nice outside area with playground and adults can have a drink while being able to supervise. Pool fine but changing area very cramped and could be cleaner. Rooms very clean and were adequate. Housekeeping staff very thorough, helpful and friendly. Reception staff adequate but could be more friendly and helpful.we had recurring problem with room keys not working which is inconvenient when you have three young children. Bar staff friendly and efficient though drinks expensive I felt. Food in restaurant and bar area very good but breakfast average. Had supply of sun creams and cool moist towels available at outside seating area which was nice. ",3,2013,07,25
223,Lovely Hotel,"Friendly front desk staff. Nice lobby with plenty of seating. They have a complimentary pitcher of tea sitting out by the front desk. One evening there was live music so we had a drink at the bar. Our bartender was superb...even though he was insanely busy he came back to us a number of times to see how we were doing and chat for a minute. The indoor pool, hot tub and sauna area were well maintained and enjoyable. Everyone who uses the pool, unless bald, MUST wear a bathing cap, men and women alike. The restaurant had plenty of choices for breakfast and the food was nice, but the restaurant & staff seemed rather chaotic and stressed all 3 days we ate there. All in all it was a pleasant stay and a lovely hotel.",4,2013,07,23
223,Great Stay,"Stayed here for one night in June 2013 with a friend. Nice Lobby.Had bar food for dinner ..Very good. Nice atmosphere with music in the lobby.
Room good size, great shower separate to bath. Very impressed over all.",5,2013,07,19
223,"GREAT stay, just a lot of taxi fares to town.","My husband and I stayed here as part of a work event. From the moment of check in until check out every moment was enjoyable. I visited the spa and had a very relaxing and affordable massage. The weather was too cool for any outdoor swimming, etc...
The bar service was great and complete with a fun group of Irishmen who loved to sing. 
The breakfasts were so delicious and the wait staff remembered us from day to day. We asked to house our luggage there while we visited other areas and they graciously agreed. The only drawback in the room was that we were in two twin beds. Lastly, we went into the city several times and so taxis were frequently called for us from the front desk which was great. The fares, not so much....overall a fabulous stay.",5,2013,07,11
223,Don't eat in the Restaurant,"Was here for a Girls Night in package with my daughter to celebrate her 18th Birthday.  The hotel itself, surroundings, bar were all fine but our experience in the restaurant was terrible.  The starter was requested without dressing as my daugter does not like chilli dressing, the waitress offered a garlic sauce as a substitute but arrived with the chili sauce. When this was mentioned she went off and got a pesto and basil sauce as a replacement instead of the garlic sauce that was offered.  I ordered a glass of Cab Sab but a glass of Sav Blanc arrived and had to be changed.  The main course took an age to arrive and although the sauce for the steak had been requested on the side, it arrived over the meat.  The chicken supreme with black olive potatoes arrived and had obviously been sitting under a head lamp for a long period of time, the vegetables which was a bowl of carrotts were the same and were dry and inedible.  When the waitress saw that most of my dinner had not been eaten and I told her why we were offered a complimentary drink which is all very nice but its not dinner!!! We were seated at 7.30 pm and our coffee and dessert arrived at 9.28 pm.  All in all not an enjoyable experience and I won't be eating again in Castleknock hotel.",2,2013,07,11
223,Short Break July 2013,We spent a short break of 3 days here. The hotel was lovely. The staff were pleasant and always very helpful. We had a double room and the bed was very comfortable and the room very clean.  The bathroom had chrome fittings and all shone! I have never stayed where the bathroom was so clean. Excellent. The food was delicious. The only comment i would make was that it was a buffet breakfast. As it is a 4 star hotel i was disappointed although you could order other meals from the breakfast menu which i did. It is my personal preference to have a cooked breakfast made fresh. I would certainly consider another visit.  It is in a lovely setting and we both had a great stay.We did not use the Spa facilities but they looked really good.,5,2013,07,11
223,Super place to spend a day,"Held a christening there on Saturday. Had no expectations one way or another. Left feeling super, staff made it such a wonderful day, just when you felt they had done all that was both possible and needed they just went further. Both management and staff showed us that delivering fine food, excellent service and Value can be made magical when the entire staff personally add those s little extras, such as sun cream, sun glasses, cool wet face cloths, and set up basied up on their preseption of what would make your day special put side seating and them to top that, provide finger food as complimentary extras, it was hard to leave. More incredible it is often said if God came down again on clouds I have some issue or objection, hard to please but easy to upset, so it takes a lot to get me to write.",5,2013,07,11
223,..Do not book during May....,"Children running around , unsupervised... in First Communion Outfits... Mayhem....Booked on day of arrival.... only room available was a single non-smoking room... However, I could have walked through the cig. scent that greeted me...On entering smoking area ... ash trays filled to overflowing.... and worst of all ... broken glass outside children's ""playgound""..... surely a safety hazard..Ordered salmon meal.... it was over-cooked and inedible...food spilt on floor of dining area...and left there.... Overall ... a bad impression.... And ‚Ç¨149  for a single room....!!!!.",2,2013,07,09
223,Excellent Hotel,"Stayed here on business for two nights and found it a very nice place to stay. The hotel seemed to be run very efficiently and the staff were very helpful. The room was large and clean, though lacking aircon, which could be a problem on the few hot days they must have. We ate in the hotel on one occasion and the food was very good, though there did seem to be a bar menu too. Would certainly stay there again when I am in the area.",4,2013,07,07
223,Superb Hotel,"This was my first stay at the hotel, and I was very impressed my room was large with every mod-con, I was lucky to have a room over looking the golf course. A nice selection also on the beverage tray. The meals were very reasonable, and the food was very good. The hotel also comes with a pool and spa. What capped the stay for me was the staff they were a credit to the management and were most likely the best I have come across and I stay in hotels 200 nights a year. I will always make this my hotel of choice when travelling in Dublin.",5,2013,07,06
223,very family friendly,"We stayed here for a weekend with a 4 year old and an 18 month old.
We upgraded to a suite as our original room was rather small for all of us.
Pool and  playground are great for kids.
we ate in the bar both nights. food was great.
My only problem was that the second evening we ate in the bar there were plenty of staff, but no one seemed to be taking orders for dinner. waited over 40 mins to place an order. stressful with two small children!
Pool is also only open until six in evening for kids.",4,2013,07,04
223,Great hotel,"Had a two night break here with my husband and a person who was disabled.  The hotel was equipped to deal with him being in a wheelchair and the staff who are so efficient and  courteous also went above and beyond our expectations in getting us seated and making sure everything was ok for us.
The rooms were lovely and comfortable, the  choice of food at breakfast was unbelievable, much better than some 4star hotels that we have stayed in.  We went on a DBB package and were so glad as the quality was very, very good.
We would not hesitate to  come back to this hotel as there were so many personal touches, free newspapers, complimentary iced tea at reception, umbrellas that could be borrowed and at the outdoor patio there was complimentary suncream, sunglasses, towels and blankets. 
The hotel is about 15mins to Dublin city centre and a few mins away from Phoenix Park and Dublin Zoo which is brilliant for a day out.",5,2013,07,04
223,What a wee gem!,"The closest thing to heaven. 
We had booked this hotel online for a special wedding anniversary weekend. When we arrived the receptioist greeted us and informed us we had been upgraded to a suite. This was a very nice touch - one of many that happened over the course of the weekend. THe room was excellent - lots of little extras, like hair straightners as well as hair dryer. The bathroom had an excellent selection of extras in case you forgot anything - dental kit, shaving kit, sewing kit and nail file!
The next pleasant suprise was that the hotel delivered to us ann anniversary card signed by the management and staff.
WE had booked for a couples spa treatment in the hotel and this was exceptional. The relaxing room and the expert quality of the staff made the whole experience very special and enjoyable. 
The Park Restaurant meal was top rate. Over all I would recommned this hotel to anyone and we have already booked to return in August with our daughters.Great hotel - well done.",5,2013,07,04
223,Tranquil and green and close to the airport,"This hotel is marvellous if you have a car and you want proximity to downtown Dublin and the airport.  It is everything a modern hotel should be and has super obliging staff.  Rooms are spacious and well outfitted and the restaurant food is excellent, especially the outstanding steak.  We stayed twice within a short period and will definitely be retuning often as the lush trees and gardens are so tranquil and relaxing to gaze upon.  Despite many visits to Dublin it took us to a lovely part of town we had not seen before.",4,2013,07,03
223,Nice shiny hotel,"I arrived by car into the large car park out front and walked over to reception.  I was immediately impressed by the modern grandeur and use of shiny granite or other stones in the public area.  Checking in was easy.  I'd pre-paid to get the best deal and just had to buy some breakfast vouchers for ‚Ç¨9.95 instead of the regular ‚Ç¨16.00 on the day price.

The room was adequate.  Clean, tidy but hot with no air conditioning and windows that had been crudely restricted from opening by some dull chain seemingly out of a builders merchant's.  There was a fan to help cool the air though.

The bathroom was clean, shiny and all in order.

I went for dinner here for one night.  Service was good, the food was good, but it lacked atmosphere - especially with the weird jazz like muzak in the background.  Breakfast was more enjoyable with a generous buffet of so many hot and cold items, fresh coffee, fresh juice etc.  Just the awful muzak in the background again.

My wife joined me for the third night before we took a week's holiday in Northern Ireland.  It was nice to sit with her in the bar/lounge late on the Friday night listening to the live musicians and supping a cold Guinness.  She used the gym next morning.  I didn't so can't comment.  She seemed happy though.

I'd happily stay there again.  Hopefully it will be in the winter though!  Once again I expect I'll book through a booking site rather than directly - though both were offering great deals.",4,2013,07,03
223,Excellent value swanky hotel with spa facilities outside Dublin,"Excellent value swanky hotel with spa facilities outside Dublin. There is not really anything to do in the area, but you can make the most of things with complimentary spa. It's not huge, but there's a small sauna, steam room, jacuzzi and a pool. Gym if you fancy it too.

Impressive interior in main areas and very clean, comfortable rooms.

Can recommend the cream tea for 2 options at one of the restaurants. Very very very good value for money!

Overall we were impressed and for the price it was excellent. Just a shame it's a 20 EUR taxi ride outside of Dublin centre...",4,2013,07,01
223,Brilliant Service,"I sometimes despair when I read reviews. Here is a tiny tip, if you want 5* go and pay for it folks. This is a GOOD hotel not stunning no but good. What I must say is Service with a capital S, just had a meal served by Sarah Jane, if anyone wants a lesson in exemplary service this was it, I won't gush but simply say thank you.  I will put the average spa rating down to one over zealous member of the enjoyment police who considered it dangerous for 8 year old children to jump in a very controlled manner into a swimming pool, not bombing not running, standing on the pool edge and jumping in. I'm a pool lifeguard myself, I know what's acceptable in a pool and what's not, that set aside great few days.",4,2013,07,01
223,What a let down,"We had lunch here a few days ago to celebrate a Christening.  The service was dreadful.  The lunch was rebooked. There was nobody else in the restaurant except our party of 18.  It took 1 hr for the main course to arrive. One guest had to get up and leave as he had a prior appointment.  He left without dessert & coffee.  One of the items on the dessert menu was a selection of icecream.  by the time it got to the table it had half melted which shows it was anging around the kitchen a bit too long. It was the worst I have experienced in a long time. 

I hate having to make these remarks as I have eaten here several times and stayed overnight in the past.   I then recommended it highly.  If we had not been guests I would have called the manager.",2,2013,06,30
223,Pleasantly surprised,"The larger hotel is not really our thing, but we were pleasantly surprised at how comfortable we felt at the Castleknock Hotel, which, in the event, admirably served our purpose of visiting Dublin from a convenient out of town location. It took just 40 minutes to reach City centre by bus (running every 15 to 20 minutes and no more than a five minute walk from the hotel) at no great cost, while the hotel provided all the information we required to fill our day. We upgraded our room to Executive and this gave us a quiet corridor with a view over an internal garden area, while the external fans that at first concerned us were turned down late evening allowing a good night's sleep. Our dinner, bed and breakfast rate came with a good choice dinner menu and a well-stocked buffet breakfast, both provided in an elegant and comfortable restaurant; and dinner service was superb on both nights of our stay with food cooked to perfection and attention to our needs meticulous. The large public areas absorbed guests extremely well and customer service was of a good standard with staff welcoming and eager to please. If we had disappointments, they would be the size of the swimming pool which scarcely seemed adequate for so large an establishment, the Jacuzzi that was closed (apparently  because of unexplained earlier incidents) and we would have preferred to be able to control the bathroom's under-floor heating which left our room warmer than we would have preferred. It was also unfortunate that the sparkling wine ordered to be in our room on arrival was not actually there - an oversight at a hotel that otherwise seems to be well managed.",4,2013,06,30
223,wow,"we stayed here as a 30th wedding anniversary gift from our family, the hotel itself was fab, the food  was great, but the best thing about this hotel is the STAFF, every single one of them  either smiled, spoke or greeted us with a nod, it made us feel very welcome,  a card and a cake were left in our room  which was fab, thank you to all for a lovely stay  x x",5,2013,06,26
223,good hotel drinks pricey,stayed here for a wedding nice hotel grand big foyer food good quality drink pricey small bottle of water 3euro nice music in the foyer on the friday night. nice outdoor area for sitting down on a nice day staff and service  very good,5,2013,06,24
223,Excellent Hotel  for a few days away with friends!,"Stayed here with friends, great food, the staff very friendly and accommodating.. piano playing in lounge was lovely. Need car as its a little away from city, not far from Dublin Zoo in Phoenix Park, its a must, children will love Zoo. pool and spa all very nice.. will visit again!!!!
Tip : Book spa before you come as it was booked out when we where there.",5,2013,06,24
223,Love this hotel!!!,"Stayed here last night. Myself and my husband celebrated our second wedding anniversary with a brilliant package. We got one night in the Bridal Suite, breakfast, sparkling wine and chocolates in the room on arrival, 4 course meal in The Park restaurant and a late 1pm check out. All this for only ‚Ç¨112.50 each. The suite was amazing!! Lovely views over the golf course and lakes. Every staff member we met were so friendly. The meal was fabulous, I recommend having the chocolate fondant for dessert, heavenly! I don't have one bad thing to say about this hotel apart from the fact that our stay came to an end all too quickly. If your looking for a bit of luxury in an idyllic setting, book the Castleknock Hotel and Country Club. You will not be disappointed!!!!",5,2013,06,24
223,"Great location, Quality food","The hotel is one of my local hotels where I frequent quite regularly for evening meals and Sunday carvery but most recently I had a spa treatment and overnight stay. The food is absolutely excellent. The bar menu is massively diverse, the restaurant is classy and well priced and the Sunday carvery is one of the best I've had. The Spa treatments were amazing. I had a gift voucher so got a discounted price but it would be well worth the full price too. The room was spacious, airy and had minimal noise. Well worth a couples weekend away or a girly trip.",4,2013,06,24
223,Great hotel- noisy wedding party,"Would have given the hotel 5 stars if we hadn't had a lot of noise in the early hours of the morning from children running and shouting in the car park. When we mentioned this at reception it was taken very seriously. We were told it would be Aiken up with management as it was very much against company policy. A note was put on our customer profile to ensure a quieter room if we return. A very positive response to a complaint. Everything else about the hotel was great. Huge room. I think we may have been upgraded although it was not mentioned. Room spotlessly clean. Lovely bathroom with bath and walk in shower. Good atmosphere in general areas. Lovely pool, sauna, steam room, jacuzzi etc which was very quiet. You have to wear a swim hat in the pool. Available to buy for 3 euros. Good bar food. not much choice if you are vegetarian but pasta dish was very well cooked and tasted great. Fantastic staff. Always happy to do anything to help. Genuine service with a smile. Check out is not till 12 which means you can have really relaxed morning, use spa etc before leaving. If you have only booked a room, it's worth buying vouchers for breakfast when you check in. 9.95 euros pp and well worth it. EXCELLENT breakfast. Amazing choice etc. Costs about 7 euros more if not pre-booked. Would be very happy to stay here again but would ask for a quiet room f there was a wedding on.",4,2013,06,23
223,Good again,"Stayed here with 2 small kids. Handy for phoenix park. Rooms are a little hot at night. Generally works well for us. A little point of town but we didn't mind. Restaurant food is good quality.
Generally hits the spot for our needs with 2 under 2. Have stayed three times at this stage on basis of value in Dublin.
",4,2013,06,19
223,Lovely break with friends,"I stayed with three friends at the Castleknock Hotel on a weekend break package and had a lovely time. The hotel is fresh, welcoming and friendly. The staff were all very nice and very accommodating. Bedrooms were lovely with comfy beds and a well laid out bathroom - separate shower cubicle which I always love.  We used the spa and swimming pool which were lovely, and had dinner that night in the restaurant. Even though we were on a Dinner Bed & Breakfast package - and normally in hotels, you tend to get very basic dinners on those packages - the dinner we got was absolutely gorgeous. Breakfast on both mornings was also delicious. There was good atmosphere in the hotel lobby also on the Saturday night as there was a guy singing and playing a guitar.    The one thing to note with this hotel is it's a bit out of the way, and unless you have your own car, you will be paying a fortune with taxis to get too and from there.",5,2013,06,17
223,One night birthday stay,"Me and my wife stayed on the 16th June,it's a beautiful hotel,we were made to feel very welcome as soon as we arrived,rooms were very nice,bar was very big and spacious,we stayed on a deal of ‚Ç¨120 for two people which included b&b and a three course dinner which was great value,we'd thoroughly recommend it,and WILL be back soon....",5,2013,06,17
223,Excellent stay,"One night stay, great atmosphere, hotel buzzing, food in restaurant very tasty, one man band playing, very entertaining. Breakfast excellent. Rooms very good and beds very comfortable.  Staff extremely professional, curtious and overall a pleasure to be around. There  was a mistake on our bill but the lady at reception sorted it immediately. Top class hotel.",5,2013,06,17
223,Amazing stay,"We stayed here last weekend and must rate this fabulous hotel 5stars.  Staff were lovely, rooms amazing and every possible need met. The location is excellent for central dublin, and also easy access to public transport.

We will definitely be staying here again.",5,2013,06,14
223,Good Hotel with Great Spa,"Location:

Hotel is on the outskirts of the town of Castleknock which is a 15 minute taxi journey to Dublin and 25 minutes to the airport.

Hotel:

The hotel is set in a stunning location with a golf course next door were you get a discount green fee while staying at the hotel. The hotel has great food served throughout the day till 10pm were it changes to a plater menu. Room service is also very efficient and again the food quality is excellent as the same menu as the Fionn Ulsce Bar. Without doubt this was one of the better breakfast buffets we have had. Our room did not include breakfast and it is cheaper getting breakfast vouchers from recepition the night before as they cost 9.95 euros compared to one day price of 16.95 euros. The hotel is very popular with the locals on the weekend which provides a great vibrant atmosphere in the bars. There is also free wifi around the entire hotel.

Rooms:

The rooms are very clean and a reasonable size with all the amenities you would expect. Our one criticism of the rooms is there is no air conditioning. We visited between 9th to 12th June when the weather had been hot, which had made the rooms very stuffy and hot during the night even with the windows opened constantly throughout the day and night. Thus the reason for giving an average sleep quality rating.

Spa:

The spa is run by Tonic who provide an excellent gym, 18m pool, sauna, jacuzzi and steam room. On arrival to the Spa desk you are provided with a gym towel and a pool towel. You are required to wear a swim cap in the pool which costs 3 euros if you do not have your own. There is also changing room facilities with lockers and showers. I would highly recommend booking a spa treatment during your stay such as the hot stones massage which was excellent. The Spa treatment rooms are upstairs with relaxation and massage rooms. While staying at the hotel you get a 15% discount on all treatments you have.",4,2013,06,13
223,Surprised it was so good !,"This was my first visit to the Hotel. I was surprised by its very good standard .Situated on a very nice golf course and within 5 minutes to Phoenix Park & 15 minutes to city centre. The receptionists were very efficient and friendly - reminded of of the 'old style' friendly Irish welcome.
Food was reasonable priced ‚Ç¨ 60 for 2 including house wine. Also seemed to be many special offers for room price.
My only negative was that the window of the room ,although the golf course, could be seen was overlooking a roof with a very loud motor /compressor that did not make for a quiet night sleep.Just seemed like totally wrong place for the large sized motor and certainly did not allow for a silent night sleep. Next time will definitely ask for a quiet room !",4,2013,06,11
223,"Great spa, great food, just don't stay here..","Fantastic dining options, amazing golf course, and a fantastic spa.  Best part was the staff.  That's where it ends.  Don't get me wrong, this is a great place to spend your day, but do not spend the night.  The rooms are awful.  

Our chairs had stains on them and the bed was uncomfortable.  A few of the light bulbs were burnt out in the fixtures.  The bathroom was the worst part.  You could hear other peoples toilet flushes through the shower drain and it smelled like a sewer.  

Out of the 6 places we stayed in Ireland, this was the worst as far as rooms go.",3,2013,06,10
223,Golf Weekend,"We arrived at the hotel on Friday for a two night stay with two days of golf. As soon as we arrived first impressions were great, and those impressions got better as soon as walked into the lobby which was well decorated and spacious. We played Westmanstown Golf course on the Friday and the golf course at the hotel yesterday and both are smashing courses. Could not say a bad thing about either course however I've never seen greens as fast in my life which troubled even the best of our golfers. The hotel staff were very friendly, professional and always smiled which was good to see. The food was pretty good, I had the smoked burger and it was absolutely delicious and was a real hit with several of our party as were the steaks. The swimming pool etc where also excellent and well looked after, pitty the jacuzzi was broken as I was looking forward to relax in it. I would deffienetly go back and also recommend to friends and family but you would not get the same weather for two days straight which added to the whole expierence and stay.",5,2013,06,09
223,Lovely escape,"We arrived at the hotel for a midweek break, the hotel looked the part and first impressions were great! The receptionist was very friendly and check in was straightforward. The room was lovely and spacious and the ensuite had both shower and bath which was nice to have the option, we had booked spa treatments and they were fab! The staff there were great and very professional would defiantly recommend to others. The only problem I had with the hotel room was the heat, it was so warm and the portable fan in the room did not work, although when I spoke to the receptionist she made a note and it was replaced by the time we got back from dinner. On our first night we ate in the park restaurant. The staff were ok, we were told someone would come for a drinks order and in the end we had to bring it to their attention after the second course, despite this the food was amazing.  I was really disappointed with their attention to detail tho, as my boyfriend choose the restaurant to propose, they completely failed to notice him on one knee proposing, not even a congratulations and we left barely without notice, for an award winning restaurant this was disappointing. We had breakfast included and this was great, fantastic selection and in comparison to our dinner the breakfast waitress remembered us by name every morning. In all a good hotel!",4,2013,06,04
223,Very pleasant stay,"Stayed here last week as I was working nearby and was thrilled when I checked in and got to my room.  Room was pristine and very well laid out (had been upgraded to a suite so I was thrilled).  Best thing about this hotel is proximity to Dublin City Centre but its in the country side so it's extremely quiet.  Best night sleep I had in Dublin ever!!  Will definately return.  Travelled there by cab, not too sure how accessible it is by public transport",5,2013,06,04
223,"Little known gem , had a wonderful time !!","Had not heard of Castleknock before finding it online , but will definitley be back at some stage. Booked it as an anniversary present for my parents because of the facilities available i.e. golf course and spa. Hotel and rooms were spotless and well equipped, spa was magnificent and at a reasonable rate. Had lunch in the lobby bar area and was very impressed with food. Golf course in the resort was a good test of golf without being too difficult !! Dinner in the main restaurant was delightful and pretty reasonable at under 40 euro for a four course dinner. service at times was a bit slow due to a wedding and other things going on in the hotel but we didnt mind too much. Breakfast buffet was good standard with plenty of choice than just the traditional irish breakfast , would reccommend to anyone looking for a nice relaxing break or with whatever activities you like to do !!",5,2013,06,02
223,just missed the mark,"This hotel came highly recommended, I went for the weekend on my sisters Hen party, there was seven of us in total,  and although we had a fab time, I felt the hotel and staff treated almost as though we were second class customers. on the first night we had arranged dinner for us all, we were dining at 7pm and were placed in the ""overspill"" part of the restaurant, when there was know one in the main restaurant, as it turns out, we were the only customers seated here the whole night. the reason we got for this was that all the tables were booked, even though we booked this almost six months ago, we were the ones who were put in the ""cheap"" seats. we retired to our rooms where we had a mr and mrs type game organised, we needed a DVD player. i went down to reception to ask for one, and got the rudest man I have EVER encountered working at a front desk. he stated all the dvd players were reserved for executive rooms, and they could only be received by removing from the room before customers checked in. he said he would see what he could do, and call me up to advise. half hour later my sister phoned down to see if he was able tp do anything, where he snapped and said I was talking to you earlier and I told you that I would organise something for tomorrow night! my sister then went down to reception and again the man was rude and pushy, she said to him, I don't need you to be rude, I need you to do me a favour - this must have shocked him into action as he asked another member of staff to look for an extra dvd player (why he did not do this in the first place I don't know) so after over an hour, we could continue our night. I felt his remark about the executive rooms, and the rudeness made me feel second class. it clearly stated in the book in the room that your can get various items by requesting them from reception, clearly not. the poor service continued at the bar, we asked for burgers, and it took over an hour for our order to arrive. in the residents bar, I ordered a round, there were 2x other guests at the bar, so I wouldn't say he was rushed off his feet, but it took forever to get my round as the barman disappeared mid way though serving me, and then I had to do three trips to the table, even though I asked for help carrying the drinks! then at check out, my door was knocked at ten past 12, then again at quarter past oh and one more time at 20 past! talk about wanting rid!. there was one nice staff member, one barman was helpful but that is it. don't get me wrong, the hotel was clean, comfortable, nice outside bar area, and the spa was FAB, but I honestly do not think I will go back here.",3,2013,06,01
223,Perfect for a family break,"Got a great mid week deal for a family break. Hotel itself is pristine, rooms adequate and facilities for a break like this are excellent. Great pool / leisure centre. Have a young son and he really enjoyed the stay - spent loads of time in the pool and there is also a kids play area just outside the bar / restaurant area which was very good also. Nice grounds and excellently located close to the Phoenix Park for the zoo etc and you wouldn't even realise you were that close to the city. Food in the restaurant very good and service excellent and courteous. Defo will consider again for a family break. Only negative was the bed - not comfortable, very hard and pillows poor",5,2013,05,31
223,Great value and service,I must say I never knew this hotel was so close to the city 10kilometres . A great setting and wonderful views . The staff are very friendly from check in to the waiters . I have really enjoyed my steak and dessert and it was very reasonable .the hotel has a lovely atmosphere and I would come back here again ,4,2013,05,29
223,Beautiful and Clean Hotel,"Great place to stay.  it was quiet, and clean with nice sized rooms.  I found that the restaurant staff weren't friendly but the bar staff was and the bar food was very good.  The only complaint is that it is so far out from city centre.  There is a bus stop 10 minutes walk, so that is easy but it's finding the right bus that comes back that way in the evening that is the pain!",5,2013,05,29
223,30th birthday celebrations - May 2013,"Hotel and staff where fantastic. Our room was very clean, and nice and spacious.  You can ask for fresh milk if you want for tea or coffee instead of using those wee milks that you normally get.  Separate bath and shower in bathroom.

We arrived Tuesday 14th May and stayed until Friday 17th May .  Lovely grounds.  We stayed in room 209 which was on second floor, in the lobby area on this level there is a drink machine and a snack machine, there is also a shoe shine machine.

On the first night we decided to take it easy and went to the lobby to sit, we got a burger and a pint, something simple, but the burgers where out of this world, a classic burger but so well presented and so tasty.

We went out all day Wednesday.

Thursday was my birthday, we went to breakfast when we came back the hotel staff had kindly got me a mini cake, a card and a happy birthday balloon, such a lovely touch.  We spent a good lot of the day at the jacuzzi, sauna, steam room and swimming pool, we where they two there, so it was absolute bliss, I also had a back and Indian head massage, again total bliss.

We had a meal included on out stay, I got steak for main, it literally melted in your mouth, definitely a must!  After dinner we went for cocktails and the bar man very kindly brought me a lovely piece of cake with a candle in it and sang happy birthday to me.

All in all and excellent stay and definitely would go back again.",5,2013,05,28
223,Quick Visit,"We stayed for one night, the staff were friendly and helpful. We had dinner in the restaurant which was excellent, well presented and good value, breakfast was also excellent all helped by attentive and interested staff. The only issue was the large outside aircon unit whose vibration and hum seemed to permeate our accommodation side of the hotel, it did wake us early in the morning.",4,2013,05,28
223,'Don't eat atthe Hotel Restaurant',I was at this hotel restaurant recently for a family Communion dinner.....it was terrible......we waited an hour in between each course. We had children with us (which the fed last) and they were so bored they kept goin out to the playground outside to play in between each course because we had to wait such lengths of time. The staff were extremly rude and had no time or manners for anyone. We paid a very high price as there were 20 of us and it wasn't worth one penny......i would definitely not recommend this hotel for food or service.,1,2013,05,28
223,Poor Sleep,"Stayed in this hotel for one night. Service was excellent and thought the food in the restaurant was superb. My only problem was with the room. It was extremely warm atnight and couldnt leave the window open as there was a large air con unit outside tgat was humming loudly all night. This led to a very poor and uncomfortable sleep (for the very little sleep I got). Would recommend this hotel but ask for a room away from the air con unit.

223,willjen,"Stayed here for a 1 night stay with evening meal. The staff at reception were very friendly and helpful. Rooms were very clean and tidy . Leisure facilities were excellent and not over crowded.
Evening meal was excellent in the brassier restraunt. Breakfast was pentiful, hot and well cooked with a great selection for all tastes, and staff couldn""t be any more helpful. Over all a great hotel.",5,2013,05,20
223,Excellent Hotel,"I found this hotel Excellent. I country retreat but olny 10 to 15 mins drive from the city centre and Blanchstown Town Centre shopping Centre. 
The Hotel its self was lovely nice clean modern hotel with great facilities 
Pool (the only thing i would say is that you most wear a swiming cap in the pool so bring one with you as they charge 3 euros per person child included for one at the pool reception) Spa Restuarants and bars all of which are lovely decorated. 
The Hotel also has a play park of the childern and offer travel cot beds on request.
I have no complaints with this hote other than the price of breakfasr if its not included in your room rate ite 16.99 euros per person. Seems a little expensive to me but maybe thats just me. 
All in all the hotel was great and we will be staying here again.",5,2013,05,20
223,A nice stay but disappointing in places!,"My husband and I booked in for one night on the Suite Treat package.  This was our first visit to the hotel and our first impressions were very positive.  It was very busy when we arrived as there were a lot of Communions there.

We arrived before the 3pm check in time but the receptionist checked us in as our room was ready.  She was very friendly and efficient and it was a very good first impression of the staff.

We decided to have some lunch before we went up to the room and that sadly was our first disappointment.  The food from the carvery in The Brasserie was overdone and not very hot.  Plus, we had to attract the attention of no less than two staff members to pay as there was no one at the cash till but four staff were chatting just around the corner ‚Äì so not a good start.

Our suite was lovely and the decor was beautiful.  Sparkling wine and chocolates were included as part of the package and they were waiting in the room for us and the presentation of them was fabulous.

There were a couple of maintenance issues in the room but nothing that ruined our stay. 

Dinner in The Park Restaurant that night was exceptional.  The food was exquisite and it was a delight to eat there.  The only downside was in asking for the bill, where we were charged for the meal, despite advising the waitress when we arrived that it was part of our package and giving her the voucher we received at check in.  When the waiter returned with the correct bill, he very unprofessionally said ‚Äúsorry about the error but we‚Äôre all over the place today.‚Äù  

Our plan then was to go into ‚ÄúThe Lime Tree‚Äù bar that had an adults only notice up and enjoy a couple of cocktails.  We sat down at a table that needed clearing but we noticed that there wasn‚Äôt a bar man there.  A few minutes later a member of the bar staff arrived and cleared the table for us and we placed an order with him for drinks.  After 20 minutes he still hadn‚Äôt returned so my husband had to go out to the main bar to get some drinks as there was still no bar man in ‚ÄúThe Lime Tree‚Äù.  From there, our experience went downhill.  For the time that we were in that bar, there was no staff there.  They would come in every now and then from the main bar but that was it.  Given that it was after 10pm when we went in to the bar, there were children there the whole time, despite it being ‚Äúadults only‚Äù and despite licensing laws stating that children should not be on the premises after a certain time.  To make matters worse, a manager came in at one stage and turned up one of the televisions for the children to hear the Eurovision and showed them how to higher the sound! 

There was a musician playing in the main bar just outside the door of ‚Äúthe Lime Tree‚Äù and with the TV volume being hired, people had to talk loudly to be heard and the noise was just deafening.  The noise was so bad that we ended up having to go up to our room without cocktails etc after about 45 minutes.  This was such a disappointing end to our evening and really gave us a bad view of how the bars and rules are managed and followed up on by the hotel.

Breakfast the next morning wasn‚Äôt good.  The food was cold and the scrambled eggs were watery.  It wasn‚Äôt an enjoyable breakfast at all.

On checkout, the receptionist was really lovely and was very taken aback when I mentioned about children being in ‚ÄúThe Lime Tree‚Äù bar as she agreed that it was adults only but she also confirmed that children should not be in the bars after 9pm.  

All in all, our experience in the Castleknock Hotel was mixed. While we‚Äôd a lovely room and a nice dinner, the bar experience really soured our visit.  In addition, while the hotel might be busy due to Communions etc, it shouldn‚Äôt result in residents being affected.",3,2013,05,19
223,Uncaring.,I booked my husband into this hotel as I was going in for an operation in the Hermitage Clinic...and as this hotel was quite close and would be only a short taxi drive away we decided it was a good place for him....however it didn't turn out to be convenient as a taxi took nearly 25 mins to get to the hospital...and my husband had to pay 20euros everytime he traveled to and from the hospital...we had booked for 2 nights but we decided he needed to be nearer the hospital in case he was needed...we explained the situation to the hotel...only to be told we still had to pay for both nights...no understanding at all on their part...so my advice is don't book 2 nights together because they don't allow for any changes to your stay...and we had planned to stay with them again in June as I will be due back at the hospital for my check up...but that is out of the question now...as they were so mean about everything...God be with the day that hotels did everything they could to help out their customers...now it seems its all about the money...where is the hospitality these days.,3,2013,05,19
223,Getting better,Stayed there for tree nights last week and must say that I find the experience in is hotel only getting better. Our room was freshly decorated and had a very pleasant feeling about it. Had a bit to eat in the bar when we got there and would recommend the burger with the apple wood cheese .It was delicious .Although it was busy when we got there service was quick and excellent.One thing I noticed over my couple of days was the way the whole team work together as a unit .Every one gets involved in giving a first class service. Had a meal in the restaurant  on the second night and must say really enjoyed every bit of it .Really enjoyed our break there and well done to all for the excellent service an detail.,5,2013,05,16
223,Lovely Hotel,"I stayed here about two weeks ago and really enjoyed my stay!

At the start I was a bit disappointed that we did not get our flat screen TV as described but when I rang reception they offered straight away to move us to another room with the TV. They gave us the key to have a look at the other room. It had the TV but unfortunately the view was out onto the car park as opposed to the view of the golf course in the other room. We decided to take the new room as the other room also had a generator outside which I feel may have affected my sleep. 

The staff were extremely helpful throughout. The second evening we had food in the restaurant and it was fantastic. Really tasty food. If I remember correctly a man by the name of Callum was serving us. He was both friendly and professional.  

The breakfast the next day was perfect. It had everything you could ask for along with a complementary Sunday Independent. 

I also tried out the leisure center while I was there which I really enjoyed. 

Overall I enjoyed my stay and would definitely go back!",4,2013,05,14
223,Horrible honeymoon,"We stayed from 06/05/13 to 10/05/13. we booked under an online offer of ‚Ç¨485 for 4 nights for 2 adults & 2 kids. as we were only bringing 1 child i asked for a further discount when booking but was told no. This was fine until we arrived at the hotel to find we were to stay in a shoebox for 5 days!!! The room was horrendously small. There were no basic facilities i would have expected in a hotel room, fridge, bath robes, temp control etc! I was discuted so i complained as this was meant to be our honeymoon. The manager explained that there were no other rooms available as they were fully booked, doubtful as the dining room was nearly empty the following morning. She also said that they usually put 2 adults and 2 children into this room, (2 kids to share the sofa bed), which i find very hard to believe as there were only 3 of us and there wasn't room to swing a cat! The bar staff seemed nice & the waiting staff in the restaurant were attentive but the reception staff didn't even look up when we passed. The size of the room really ruined our stay. Also, as part of the deal was a spa treatment, which was lovely, but also 2 evening meals. One would assume that this would include all parties staying but no, it only include the 2  adults meals!! we had to pay for my sons meal. 
Overall, we were not impressed. It really ruined what was meant to be a relaxing break after getting married. I won't be going back.",1,2013,05,14
223,Highly recommend,"Stayed here with my husband... The staff at check in were so friendly & helpful, lovely for families or a romantic get away. Breakfast was the best I've had in a hotel for some time :) we will be back",5,2013,05,07
223,Satisfied Customer,"I recently stayed for two nights in this hotel and was very satisfied with the experience. The staff were very friendly and helpful, the food was excellent and the room was clean and comfortable. I have no problem recommending to anyone.",5,2013,05,07
223,Golf Break,"Spent one night in this hotel with another couple on a special offer for two with breakfast and an evening meal. We had a twin room which was beautiful. The other couple had an Executive room which also was beautiful. The women had a snack in the bar when we arrived and the food was excellent as was the service. The men played golf for the afternoon. My girlfriend had a Hot Stone Massage for an hour and she came back glowing. She said it was the best experience ever.  Went to the Restaurant for the two course meal which was included in the offer. The menu was varied, the food was wonderful  and the service was great. Went into the bar for an hour or so after the meal and again the service was great.  Breakfast was varied and we had it in the same Restaurant as the dinner the previous night. Couldn't fault anything about this hotel. What made it even better was on paying the bill we got a Euro 50 voucher for a return visit which I hope will be soon.",5,2013,05,07
223,Wonderful hotel,"My husband and I stayed as a birthday treat for him.  We had took up the tv offer for a one night stay and were so impressed with the hotel we decided to stay the second night.  As it was his birthday I asked for an upgrade to an executive room with a view of the wonderful grounds and paid a fee for this.
When we arrived to the new room it was lovely with a small birthday cake and card for my husband, we were delighted.
The whole hotel has a lovely atmosphere, spotlessly clean in all areas I actually couldn't fault it.
We went down for a drink both nights and the bar staff along with all the other members of staff were very friendly and nothing was to much trouble.
Breakfast had a great selection and was of a high quality.
The only fault was the noise from the generator outside. Even though we were a good bit away from it, it was like a lorry running its engine non stop.
I said it to the receptionist about 10pm and she said that it went off at 11pm and offered us another room but as it was to go off at 11 we were happy to stay in the room.  Although it got less noisy it was still humming all night.
On checking out I spoke to the receptionist again and she was very apologetic and called the duty manager.  She told me it was a new system and they were having some teething problems with it.  She then refunded me the cost of the upgrade and offered me a free upgrade on my next visit, which I thought was very reasonable.
I will be staying at this hotel again as it is one of the best hotels we have stayed in.  In fact I am trying to find a reason to go back.
I will just finish by saying that the staff from accommodation with their warm smiles good morning and spotless rooms, to the bar, reception and restaurant staff made our stay just about perfect..a BIG well done :)",5,2013,05,03
223,"Excellent Hotel, Golf and Location","Recent Business meeting, and were rewarded for staying 10 mins outside the city in this wonderful Hotel and Country Club.

Rooms were excellent, and I looked over the golf course. The bar was very well attended and the staff first class and friendly.

Dinner was first rate and conference facilities perfect. Breakfast only reason for not giving 5 stars. Very busy, cramped and average quality. Maybe have room service next time.

The golf course, with preferential rate, is US style, with water everywhere and good, clever bunkering. A real surprise as it was challenging but fun.

I reccommend this resort if planning Dublin Business and pleasure.",4,2013,05,03
223,Well worth a visit,"Travelled from Derry on Sunday 28th April to this lovely hotel and stayed for 3 nights. After advising us that they had no booking  i was able to provide a confirmation letter and i have to say that the receptionist was apologetic  and was able to find us a room as thankfully they were not fully booked. The standard of rooms are very good very clean and roomy but as others have said there is quite a lot of noise if you are at the back of the hotel. We were on the first floor and always have a window open at night but the unit was on until around 11.30 and on again at 07.30am which did waken us. We didn't really mind too much as we were getting up for breakfast but would certainly ask for a different room the next time.
We ate in the bar and enjoyed are food which was reasonably priced and had an inclusive dinner  which was excellent from start to finish with great service on the night. No faults there with very helpful and pleasant staff. I am coeliac and they were very accommodating throughout the stay. We  chose a dish which required us to pay  5euro each extra for our meal and were happy to do that. We do not drink and normally when we have a meal I have water and my husband has diluted orange. We did not expect to be charged 1.80 for a pint glass of diluted orange we have never been charged in other hotels and it seems a bit mean. Other than this I can say that we had a great time in the hotel and would definitely return but would suggest that you think again about charging for diluted orange.",4,2013,05,02
223,Beautiful looking hotel but had loud outside air conditioning problems..,"I stayed here for one night having had a great experience as a afters guest at a wedding in December 2012. I was given a lovely room on the second floor and everything seemed fine but I noticed a loud, low humming noise after a short while in the room. I realised it was coming from outside. It turns out it was the large air conditioning unit of the hotel on the roof at the second floor room level and it was very loud indeed. Having been assured that it would stop at 11 pm (and told that it was the air conditioning unit) I went to collect my partner and returned at midnight to find it still buzzing away. I called reception and was told that in fact it would not stop (and they knew immediately what I was talking about so it must be a regular complaint). They did however immediately, and without complaint, move me to a different room but it is obvious that they are aware of the problem and had placed me and others in the position of either ignoring it or complaining which I think is still bad form for a 4 star hotel.",3,2013,04,30
223,"Excellent value, we'll be back","Great value, friendly staff and good location to visit the zoo which is about 10 minutes drive away. Golf course looks but didn't get a chance to play. The pool was nice and warm for our young baby and there was plenty of choices of where to eat in the hotel. ",5,2013,04,28
223,Wonderful service," 1st time at the Castleknock hotel & it definetly won't be our last! We had a family confirmation party in the park restaurant and an overnight stay last weekend. 
From the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty. Sarah on reception was super friendly and helpful. The food in the restaurant was superb and even though we were a large party, service was excellent. 

Our family room was very spacious and comfortable. Children loved the swimming pool and playground.
Breakfast was excellent. We had room service and everything arrived piping and plenty of food for everyone.

We honestly found no fault during our stay. Our son had a wonderful day, thanks to the Castleknock hotel.",5,2013,04,22
223,Not up to given standard!,"This hotel is not a 4 i will only set a -3. Why? Looks nice from distance but when getting closer. Spotlight is at 3/4. Part of interior is not looking fresh. And finally, the team at the restaurant is not as expected on a place like this, or like they think they are. The staff don't know what is included in the menu. They don't know if if a dish shall be warm or could. They don't know what cheese is int cheese board. To get one glass of red, we had to ask 3 times. To me, a amateur of management of a restaurant, the team looks like running around without any order etc. And for me, used to Swedish hotel breakfast, the breakfast served have much to learn. So good intentions, but don't live up to it!",3,2013,04,22
223,"Superb bedroom,but that bloody generator!","Booked in this hotel from a lastminute.com, deal, great value and a nice short break destination, as I had been to Kildare outlet village. Initial impression of my room was superb, a really lovely room.
Housekeeping exceptional in bedroom. Nice bathroom and toiletries.  Then it started, or at least i heard it, the drone of a generator outside my window, arghhh whats that? called reception, can you move me because of that racket?  Answer no.!  Called reception again for a corkscrew,  20 minutes later I had to call again they had got the room number wrong! Chap arrived and opened the bottle.
Nice waiter and we told him about noise of generator, Jesus that's bad he said, demand another room. He was great and said he would ask the senior manager about a room change. Nothing happened.
Went to dinner arrived 8.36pm, very poor service, my starter was good see pic , and my main was good, well presented see pic also, however service was woeful, 20 mins wait for starter,  15 for main, restaurant manager  arrived at desert and said she had been distracted by some other problem. She did comp our wine because of the poor service and my wife's main course.
Back to my room and that bloody generator was still going. Read a few other trip-advisor reviews and people demanded it be turned off. I did too. It was turned down and then about 7am on Sunday morning turned up again. Never again! It's like an articulated lorry outside your window with foot on throttle. What have they got this dame Genny running 24 /7 it ruins this hotel!",2,2013,04,21
223,good but expected better!!!!,"There is no denying that the hotel is situated well and has a fab entrance and reception/lounge area. 

We stayed when there was an offer of ‚Ç¨35pp B&B, which was last year. We simply haven't returned because we haven't found a great deal for this hotel since. 

The rooms are warm, inviting and comfortable, spacious in addition. Our room however; had been quite close to a lift, so we would hear people pass by all night... some louder than others!

The Bar was strange, we didn't like the main part as you enter into reception and walk straight... we found it cold, dull and uninviting.... however, the bar to the right of the central area is smaller, cosy and has easy access to a smoking area... I think this may be the late bar? 

The breakfast was nice, there were lots to choose from... however; agreed on both of our parts that offering sausages (a breakfast staple) that are slightly spiced is not always a good idea. 

We didn't like the added spice so filled up on egg etc instead. 

All in all, it was a nice stay for the price we paid however; I would be reluctant to spend much more if I were simply looking for a getaway.",4,2013,04,11
223,Nice stay,"Stayed here tuesday night with my two friends for a girls night away. We were looking for a quiet, relaxing night away. We all shared a room which had three single beds. The room was a good size, clean and did the job, no fridge in room which woul be good for familys and tv was bit small i thought, not major thing for us though. Dinner in restaurant was afixed menu, which was part of our deal was good, not wow but was good. The staff were really nice and helpful. They had nice touches like free iced tea and news papers in foyer. The loung wearing area was very relaxed and was perfect for our girlie catch up where we could people watch but still have privacy. The line tree bar is fab, it also has a lovely patio area and playground and pool which would be great for a family getaway, getogether. 
It would be ideal base for a few days away for couple, girls night or family event. 

Over all, it was very pleasantly experience, would recommend it to family",3,2013,04,10
223,Pleasant family hotel,We recently stayed in this hotel with our 3 small children. Breakfast was very nice and the lady that runs breakfast is very efficient. Apart from her we didn't find the staff very friendly. The bedrooms are basic - we had interconnecting rooms which were fine. There was no fridge available which is handy to have when traveling with a baby (they did allow us to use a fridge in the restaurant) and there were no films or DVDs for kids. The pool was very nice - there was a kids pool but there was no lifeguard on duty any of the mornings we were there. There is also a small playground. We got a free family pass for the zoo which is very close by and always a good day out. There is a nice lounge area which is good for having a drink in the evening. Overall we felt the hotel was overpriced for what we got.,3,2013,04,08
223,All round excellence,"Stayed here for 2 nights in January as part of a bridal party for the wedding. Booked a twin room well in advance for myself and a fellow bridesmaid using the 'wedding rate'.

When we arrived at the hotel it was like a fairytale. We were greated by a red carpet and champagne. I know thats not the norm as we were there as part of a wedding but it was done very tastefully. 

After about an hour of mingling with the other guests we checked in. The reception staff were very efficient and friendly. Our luggage had been brought to the hotel earlier for us so we were pleasently surprised when it was waiting in the room for us. The room was facing the front onto the car park on the first floor. Thankfully it wasnt a very long walk to get to it.

The drinks reception was lovely and the spacious reception/bar area made for a lovely atmosphere. We spent about another hour taking photos. Then it was time to head into the function room. 

The room was as beautiful as I could have imagined it to be. The staff were extremely attentive and looked after us brilliantly. Our exceptionally large top table of 16 made for alot of staff needed to serve us our food. The 'reveal' of the courses was flawless. The meal was amazing. For a usually picky eater I tried the Chicken Liver Pate and oh my god it was beautiful. 

The room was layed out perfectly as we were not required to leave at all as a partician wall was removed revealing the band already setup and ready to dance the night away. In the early hours we left the function room and headed into The Lime Tree bar for the residents bar. We eventually retired to bed at 6am. 

The following day the bride and groom had arranged some BBQ food again in The Lime Tree bar. About 50 of the guests had stayed overnight in the hotel and stayed around to enjoy the day after food and banter. The weather was very cold but being inside we didnt have to worry. We stayed in the Lime Tree bar all day and later in the evening had ordered some sandwiches and platters for the group. The service was again prompt and of great quality.

The following morning we woke just in time to checkout. Although we had paid for bed and breakfast both mornings we didnt not wake in time. I'm told from other guests however that it was lovely. Also didnt get a chance to use the leisure centre but again was advised it was of top quality.

Despite living about 20 minuted from the hotel I would definitely go back in the future.",5,2013,04,08
223,Impressed second time round,"This was our second visit to this hotel and the standards are service are still top class.  We were given a large upgraded room (264) and couldn't have asked for more. Robes, slippers, bottled water, iPhone dock were all provided.  We dined on both evenings and couldn't fault the food or service. It's the little extras that this hotel provides which always put a smile on my face - warm water and ice scrapers were readily available at the front doors due to the recent snow and warm blankets available for those who wanted to brave the elements out beside the rear smoking area.
Will return again with friends and will continue to recommend.",5,2013,04,08
223,very good place to stay,"This was our second time staying here and I must say it was impressive as before. All of the basics were well covered. Staff most friendly, facilities top class, accomodation well maintained. Being a nit picker and looking for a few small things i have 3 suggestions,
1. Breakfast should be hotter... or maybe we were late down
2. Water in leisure centre sink taps was COLD. Difficult to shave with. Everything else was piping hot.
3. Bar service could be streamlined. One member took order, another prepared drinks, 3rd member brought to table. a bit of a tag team effort where a weak link could cause a delay in service.
Now, none of this should put you off staying here. Food was excellent in bar and restaurant at night and day, and leisure centre was an oasis. Great place to stay if you do not want to be in city centre. 
Well done to all. would come again",4,2013,04,08
223,Wedding Day,"The Castleknock Hotel is without exception the provider of the very best service, standards, attention to detail, quality of food and professionalism in the country.

From our very first contact with this hotel while looking for a sizable wedding venue the team at the Castleknock and I mean every single person we came into contact with, from the Events, Manager to the bar staff. reception staff, Hugh who was in charge of our wedding on the day, the catering team....these people delivered way beyound my already high expectations! I would urge anyone getting married in Dublin to book nothing until you meet with this hotel first.

Our wedding invloved a large number of guests staying in the hotel (some for 3 nights, most for 2 nights) and every single one of our guests raved about the service and standards from the whole team at the Castleknock Hotel. 

My wife and I can not thank you enough for making us, our wedding day and our friends and family feel so special.

It is so refreshing to experience truly amazing service backed up by exceptional standards.

Thank you",5,2013,04,06
223,Surprising 4 star!,"Despite having to travel a substantial distance out of the main City of Dublin, the time taken (particularly by bus) was not wasted because there was lots to look at on the way and we were able to get familiar with the whole area. On approach to the hotel I was initially a little disappointed that it wasn't a castle building, but it would be silly to expect this!! The ground were beautiful, and the swimming pool looked great. The hotel reception was beautifully maintained and there was ample seating at the bar area.

We stayed on 1st-4th April and expected it to be a little busy and perhaps noisy; but contrary to other reviews I have read our room was very quiet and we were at no point in the evening disturbed by any other guests. The room was very spacious, clean and house keeping standards were tip top! The bathroom was lovely, but the walk in shower did make the rest of the floor a little wet! One negative about the room was that it was a little too hot for our tastes and we didn't work out how to turn the radiator off until the second night so the first night was spent feeling a little clammy.... but the bed was so comfy I had a fabulous nights sleep!!

We ate at The Park Restaurant on the first evening. I would definitely recommend to book in advance (unlike us!) because it was fully booked around 8pm when we initially wanted to dine, but the perks of the earlier timing was that we got to order from the Early Bird Menu which was splendid. It was very filling and came to about 50 euros. (Little tip...if you want water, ask for a tap water jug because we did end up getting charged for the bottled water at the table which we didn't realise.) The waiting staff were very attentive, friendly and we didn't want for anything because they were always near enough the table to grab us anything else we needed. The food was very tasty and well presented. There was a lot of soup involved (which is great because I love a good hearty soup), The chicken main was very succulent and the dessert was just pure heaven in a dessert cup!

Just a tip if you are going to stay here logistics wise: I highly recommend purchasing the Freedom Ticket (for the number of days you are staying) online before arrival. It cost us 28 euros each for a 3 day ticket that allowed us to use The City Tour hop on-hop off bus and all buses under the ""Dublin Bus"" company! You can get the same ticket online for 26 euros for the three days and pick it up at the airport on arrival (but to do this you need to select this arrangement 3 weeks prior to travel.) This is a good idea because on the bus you have to pay for your tickets in exact change or use a pass!

The hotel is beautiful, well staffed, well maintained and just ideal for any type of trip. Next time we would be very tempted to stay in an executive room just to see what that's like and I would love to use the spa which we never got time to do this time.",4,2013,04,06
223,Nice spot for quick city escape,"Being a local we have eaten here for lunches etc and while its slightly on the pricier side it is lovely.  We decided to do an overnight stay whilst the kids got minded.  

The rooms are lovely and spacious and very quiet.  The shower in the bathroom though is a bit clostraphobic and oddly shaped but the underfloor heating is a great addition.  

We had dinner included and the restaurant is a lovely setting particularly at night.  

I'm not overly impressed with the foyer setup, the couches for me are too big and too far apart and the area around the bar is a bit cramped. 

The leisure centre is a nice retreat but the pool is tiny and so can get congested particularly as its open to local members. 

Nice spot but nothing really too special",3,2013,04,04
223,Top class hotel,"Spent St. Patrick's weekend at this hotel. Wonderful food. Great atmosphere. Extremely attentive and friendly staff. Far enough from the city for a bit of peace and quiet, but close enough to access all amenities. Great for families. The pool area was great for our 2 year old. We would return to this hotel again.",5,2013,04,04
223,"Very excited, but disappointed.","My husband and I stayed recently following a friends party which was taking place in the hotel. The lift didn't work on three different occasions. Our room was above a noisy heat recycling plant which the duty manager acknowledged was noisy and had it switched off, only for it to start early the next morning again. We were not informed that the Jacuzzi was not working only to find out when we arrived a few hours after check in at the spa. We were not informed previously that we needed 1euro for the lockers until i had changed into my swimsuit. The pool area was not as clean as I would have expected from a four star hotel. There was litter in the steam room and tiles missing from the seating area in the room. My husband bought a pint of Guinness at the party which was so flat it looked like it had been sitting overnight. This was later replaced following a complaint to the Duty Manager. Overall, we had a very disappointing experience although staff did listen, apologies meant little as its had been years since my husband and I had stayed in a hotel without the children.",3,2013,03,25
223,Girlie night - pamper package,"We booked the girlie pamper night which is very good value.  

We arrived early & although our room was not ready for us, we were able to check in & leave our bags with reception who arranged to have them brought up to our room while we were in the Tonic Spa having our treatments done. The Spa was fabulous & the staff were great. The hotel is beautiful & our room (a triple) was spacious & well equipped. 

We were booked into the Brasserie restaurant for dinner & when we arrived down were upgraded to the Park restaurant, which was much nicer.  I think this was due to the fact that there was a large (and loud!) hen party in full swing in the Brasserie. The food was great & the set menu, although limited, had great variety.  

I have a couple of small gripes with our stay. We had ordered a bottle of Prosecco to be in our room upon arrival, which we got, however, they had only left 2 glasses. When I rang housekeeping I was informed that it would be a while before they could get another glass to us as they were busy with a wedding, so I went down to the bar myself & got one.  There was also no wine opener left in the room for the wine, thankfully I had one with me.  While waiting to check into the Spa we decided to have a coffee & took a seat in one of the booths in the main lobby area. After approx 10 mins we still had not received any table service & so ended up going to the bar ourselves to order.  Attention to detail is the difference between something being good or great, and I personally felt that the staff were concentrating on the wedding party & other things were let slip because of this.

Having said this, I would still recommend this hotel & would definitely go back.",4,2013,03,24
223,Beautiful hotel for a wedding,Stayed in this hotel last weekend for a family wedding. Good quality 4 star hotel. Staff were excellent and food was second to none. Lovely country feel about the place even though its close enough to the city. Really enjoyed my stay here.,4,2013,03,18
223,4* not a chance,Nice staff. lovely reception. That is where it ends. The grubby carpet in the corridor is the first sign. The room seemed not to be dusted in days. I really can't believe a 4* hotel has a bath for people less than 5 feet tall and a shower that you have to hold over your head yourself. Unlike others I did not get a deal and  am regretting having to stay a second night. I like 3* that try to deliver 4* but hate 4* that just aren't. Sent from phone so forgive prose.,2,2013,03,16
223,great hotel,"great food good value, also beds were great and all was very clean. a really good hotel.

really nice staff with a can do approach. i will be staying here again..............................................................................",4,2013,03,15
223,Good hotel - nice location,"Had one night there. 

Got a really good deal on it - last minute. 
For what I paid, it was good value - but wouldnt want to pay what they normally charge. 

supper (burger + chips) was good - staff were pretty nice
Breakfast - I'll pass next time. 
Rooms were ok - too hot - so relied on opening the window! 
Good free wi-fi throughout the hotel - liked that
the iron was awful - kept spilling lots of water onto my shirts...

I also used the sauna/steam room, which was excellent. 

It was starting to get going when i left (Friday) as there were a few hen parties there. 

Good hotel - just not amazing",3,2013,03,15
223,An excellent and affordable hotel,"This is a modern and well kept hotel which I used for a one day business trip to Dublin. The hotel is quite away from the city and also not in the Castleknock itself (about 2 miles out), but I expected a country and gold club to be in the green belt area. The taxi from the airport cost 30 Euros. I arrived at 9pm and was in my room within 10 minutes. Complimentary wifi was a plus. The room was big with a king size bed (very comfortable, as I found out later on), large bathroom (a bath and a shower cubicle) with underfloor heating and plenty of power sockets (which is often a problem when you want to charge your phone and laptop at the same time). Coffee/tea making facilities were available (didn't use them). I paid 9.95 Euros for the breakfast at the check in as I was advised that if I decide to take it in the morning it would be 16 Euros then. The breakfast buffet offered a selection of cereals, hot and cold food. All in all, I will come again.",5,2013,03,15
223,"Location, location, location.","We stayed at Castleknock twice last year with our toddler. On both occasions we got an excellent rate for room only on the web. On arrival the hotel offer breakfast vouchers for 9 euros which is well worth the money. The receptionist was very friendly and on one occasion could not find our booking but within minutes had us in a room with free upgrade.
The rooms are spacious, clean and what you generally expect from a large 4 star hotel. The premier room having nice views over the adjoining golf course (which looks very impressive I might add).
We used the pool which is complimentary
In fact I forgot change for the lockers and the staff even lent us the euros. The pool is nice but has quite a lot of local classes taking place for babies or ladies so it can be busy. Jacuzzi, sauna and decent gym all available.
The main reception and lounge is very nice with lots of large tv screens displaying a log fire scene in the evening and a tropical aquarium by day. Lots of comfy seating. They even have blankets at the patio doors if you decide to go outside. The breakfast is good with plenty to keep you filled for the day. We did not try any other meals. 
The hotel is also very security aware with the carpark having a coded exit gate and the internal corridors only accessed by your key. This is great assurance for the traveller especially with young children.  
As already mentioned Castleknock golf club shares the property and a small oudoor kids playpark is onsite.
The hotel is in a rural location yet only mintes from Castleknock village, Dublin Zoo and Blanchardstown shopping centre
 In conclusion this is a lovely genuine 4 star resort in a super location offering great value for money.",4,2013,03,14
223,fab!,"I love staying here, fab hotel! good size rooms, large beds that are extremely comfy! The bathroom is of a good size with seperate shower/bath and has under floor heating which is great, a nice little touch! Rooms are always spotless! There is free wifi throughout the hotel, just ask for the code. 

The food is also nice, and the bar area is lovely however if there is nothing going on the bar can be a bit dull! They do have a piano player on some nights which is good! 

The hotel is a bit far out so a car is a must, as a taxi can be a bit steep! 

Never had a bad nights stay here!",5,2013,03,11
223,Shuttle Service,"Based on our recent stay which was very enjoyable and very affordable, we had one disappointment. As this hotel  is away from the main village of castleknock and also not within safe walking distance of the nearest railway station, we enquired whether there was a shuttle service from the hotel to the train station (s) locally.  The taxi was promt when booked but each trip is an extra cost, why doesn't this hotel at least at the weekends, provde complimentary transport to the nearest rail link which is less than five minutes drive away. The hotel itself was clean, comfortable and staff very courteous. Food was nice but not above average.
Will be returning and hope that a shuttle serck",4,2013,03,10
223,Nice Hotel. Nice staff,"Enjoyed my stay here in February for one night. Nice big clean room. Staff at reception and in the bar were very friendly (THANKS) and breakfast was one of the best I have had in a Hotel for some time. Would like to return again on a leisurely basis with my wife for spa and other facilities provided.

Only problem was when the barman stuck the lime into my bottle of Corona with this fingers. Pulled it out and drank it all the same. Fit for bed at that stage (-:  ENJOY",4,2013,03,06
223,Lovely Hotel with excellent staff,"Stayed in this hotel for a family function. Staff were top class-quick and friendly check in. Beautiful room. Really cannot fault the hotel as the stay was brillant. Only problem we encountered was noisy generators next to our room. But one phonecall to reception had us moved to another room in five minutes, we were even offered a complimentary drink from the bar, we declined but still lovely to be offered. Great customer service. Will definitely return.",5,2013,03,03
223,Excellent Hotel,"Situated on the outskirts of Dublin, which means it is far enough away from the city to avoid all the hustle and bustle of a city break, but close enough to either drive the 5 mile, or spend 20 Euro on a taxi. I believe there are also public transport links close by. The hotel is spacious, bright and clean, with a lovely open plan reception/ lounge/bar/restaurant. The operation of the lift can be a bit confusing as it won't take you to any other floor than the one for your room, or the ground floor. It has a well equipped pool/spa and gym.
Food was excellent, and the staff were very pleasant and helpful.
We had a family party of 14, and the staff could not have done enough to make our stay a very pleasant one.
Good weekend and mid week internet offers to had.
Highly recommended.",5,2013,02,28
223,Overcharged,"I stayed in this hotel in Spring 2013. One guest was unfortunate enough to get the camp bed which collapsed several times. At dinner we were told we could upgrade to a la carte for 4.95 each we agreed but when presented with the bill it was 24.95 each and not worth it as we had already paid for dinner as part of the package.  The food was not hot it tasted ok but anything would with a few glasses of wine. I was charged twice for the room at check out and not informed of this mistake and dont know if it would have been corrected had I not read my bank statement. Be careful of what you are charged for at this hotel!! check your change!!
Don't think I will be back as there is better value, food and beds elsewhere.",1,2013,02,25
223,Spa weekend with the girls,"Myself and 8 of my friends went for a spa package to this hotel. We had 3 triple rooms and the spa package included breakfast, massage, mini manicure and 4 course dinner all for around ‚Ç¨115 each. The rooms were a decent size with three single rooms in each room. Unfortunately, none of the rooms were close to each other. The lighting was very dull in the rooms and it was hard to put on makeup in the room. The swimming pool area is lovely with jacuzzi, swimming pool, steam room and gym. The swimming pool was busy and not for serious swimming. There was no lift between bedrooms and the spa/swimming pool which was a pity. We had appointments at 2,3 and 5 and they all started on time. The massage was relaxing and the mini manicure was more an express paint  but we were all very happy with experience. None of us wanted to get dressed to go back up to our rooms but as the hotel was v busy we didnt want to go through reception in dressing gowns. The 4 course dinner was lovely, good choice and the food quality was excellent. Overall, this was great value for money,",4,2013,02,24
223,Some minor issues.,"We stayed at the Castleknock Hotel over half-term (2 adults, 2 kids) and took out the Dublin Zoo deal (saving us a few Euros on the Zoo entrance fee). The hotel was well located for access to the Zoo, although it was perhaps a bit too isolated for anything else (we had to use the car to access any nearby shops, bars and restaurants). The rooms were clean and warm, and the food at breakfast and in the restaurant (on the one evening we dined there) were of a very good standard.

Overall we had an enjoyable stay, however there were a number of minor issues we just took the shine off our stay. These included:

We arrived after 3pm, yet our room wasn‚Äôt ready until 3:45pm - no offer of a drink from bar while we waited.
The wifi wasn‚Äôt working in the lobby / bar area until the morning we left (stayed 2 nights), nor was it working in the rooms on the first evening.
One of the Sky connections was broken in the main bar, meaning that everyone had to watch the same channel (not ideal when I had packed the kids and wife off to bed and had come down to watch the football, only to find a couple of guys watching the golf).
The Jacuzzi in the swimming pool area was cold.
There was no shampoo in any of the 4 showers in the gents changing area (they were either empty, broken or missing).
The hair-dryer wasn‚Äôt working in the ladies changing area.

Not sure if we would stay here again when visiting Dublin - probably would stay somewhere nearer the DART rail line, so we could access Dublin City Centre more easily. A courtesy bus to the nearest rail station might be useful for the hotel as an added extra.",3,2013,02,19
223,Favourite hotel yet,"Have stayed here a number of times as i just love it. Stayed here with my mum and baby, we had such a lovely time. Comp coffee n yummy biscuits in the room are always a treat upon arrival, fab shower, good tv, immaculate rooms really, dinner - served by a delightful South African waitress, delicious breakfast a heavenly treatment in the spa with Diane, really close to blanchardstown for shopping. Would definitely recommend and will certainly be back.",5,2013,02,18
223,Lovely hotel with good Christmas Party,"Myself and couple of friends stayed in Castleknock Hotel for one night back in December after attending a Christmas Party at the same hotel. We had a standard double room overlooking their parking lot. The room was spacious, clean and comfortable, everything in it was in great condition, all in all I was very pleasantly surprised with their standards. The check-in and out was very efficient and all the staff were very friendly and couldn‚Äôt do more for you. The breakfast the next morning was delivered to our room a little bit earlier than requested and was ok, but not amazing (big portions though). Food wasn‚Äôt very fresh or very hot but I guess that‚Äôs due to fact that it was waiting for the delivery for a while. Our ‚Äúbiggest problem‚Äù was that there was no sewing kit in the room. As you can see there wasn‚Äôt really much we could complain about and the above-mentioned things were really minor issues. Didn‚Äôt try their spa or golf course but all in all enjoyed this short stay. The premises are really lovely and well kept. The Christmas Party we attended was brilliant with great music and atmosphere. Again the food could be a little bit of a let down as it was nothing special nor much choice, but we had a great time regardless. Altogether, I was surprised with how lovely the place was and with the warm welcome from all the staff. Well done!",4,2013,02,18
223,"Valentines Night 2013 ""Amazing""",We booked for a valentines nght dinner yesterday. There were 3 pairs of couples of us. The reception was warm and the dining place was coozy and romantic. The place was awesome and the ambiance was cool. Think the food was worth its' value. A valentines dinner special with 4 course meal. The staff were courteous and polite. Dining room set up was beautiful and they even complimented the ladies with beautiful roses. Thanks for the generosity. It was a lovely night.,4,2013,02,15
223,After wedding wind down,"Met with a few family and friends the day after our wedding in Wicklow. Beds are great and had a lovely nap. Used the swimming pool and sauna and it was really nice all lit-up
We stayed here a few months ago and had dinner in the rsteraunt and have to say it was excellent
The night we stayed recently we just had some bar food but again service and food very good
They do some great deals including golf, meal or spa so keep an eye out for them",4,2013,02,13
223,Wonderful staff,"I would like to thank the Castleknock staff for their attentiveness and generosity. Our car had been broken into in the centre of Dublin and the duty manager went out of her way to ensure it was kept securely until it was repaired. The staff also went the extra mile to make my birthday special. The decor, beautiful food and relaxing spa all go to make this hotel a memorable experience. Thank you to the wonderful staff!",5,2013,01,30
223,Confortable,This is a comfortable Hotel. Location difficult to find. Rooms spacious. Food good but prices were too high and value lost. Check out was not relaxed as door key access were removed without any tolerance. Needs to improve approach to customers to make this an excellent experience.,3,2013,01,28
223,Good looking,"Good rooms, nice food, great gym. The sorroundings are great but a bit far frm city. 
It's great for meetings and city breaks. 
Not far from airport and close to highway.

223,Great hotel,"We had 4 days here it was great! We did get it on laterooms so paid less than going rate! Food was lovely. Just a few things wrong, staff could be more attentive at the bar/restaurant. The iron didn't work. Location, well it's in the middle of nowhere, but it is a golf club! 
Defantely would go back, spa treatments amazing",5,2013,01,24
223,"Not Faultless, but pretty close!!!!","My husband and i stayed here in Mid January.  What can i say, Lovely Room, Friendly Staff, Beautifull food and supereb Spa/Gym (Tonic).  And the Best bit was the price!!  Will definatley be staying here again!!",5,2013,01,24
223,Can't fault it ! Highly recommended.,"I've been stopping there on business for years, and on this occasion, took advantage of one of their special offers to take my wife to Dublin for a few days. It's always been good, and on one of their 'special offers', extremely good value. We couldn't fault the food, with their evening meal / brasserie menu, and the restaurant area, being 1st class. Their breakfasts have to be among the best I've ever had. We found all the staff to be unfailingly polite and helpful.",5,2013,01,24
223,Quite disappointing,We had been recommended this by friends but were quite disappointed. The room was fine and clean and the decor was very modern. But we found the staff quite cold and unwelcoming. There was a generator of some sort and the cleaning staff's office beside our room so it was very noisy. The breakfast was sub-standard and I was also very brusquely informed that I would be charged extra for a cappuccino - this is the first time I have ever heard of that in a 4 star hotel - which was the final straw. I wouldn't go back.,3,2013,01,21
223,POOR,"Ordered a family room for me & wife plus 3 kids, given double room with a sofa bed.
Awful food in the restaurant. Also very expensive for what it is. 
And get this.....guests have to pay to use the pool. Nice touch there.
No chance I would stay here again, nor would I recommend to friends or family.",2,2013,01,19
223,cold carvery,"a nice out of the way hotel, well laid out, nice bar and spacious lounge area. stayed over night
a while back and liked the place. decided to go back for lunch and a drink on sunday.
i have to say we were very disappointed with the carvery, it was cold, skimpy and way over priced @ 29euro for 2 main course's. i would go back again but not for food.",3,2013,01,15
223,Hotel keeps getting better,"This is my 6th time now staying in this hotel and my experiences are getting better each time.The service of the hotel staff on the reception desk and in the bar and restaurent was first class and they seemed genuinely pleased to be serving you.The rooms in a quite corner of the hotel were quite and peaceful (in contrast to my 1st experience with this hotel a number of years ago).The bar menu for lunch and dinner was excellent value and the food served with a smile and understanding for the children's needs was really very good.The only slight disappointment for our stay was that the bacon for the breakfeast was undercooked and tasteless.The rest of the breakfeast was fantastic and the fruit on offer was very good.
All in all I would have no hesitation in recomending this hotel to prospective clients.",5,2013,01,14
223,Great food,Stayed here on an quick over night stop on Wednesday 9th January on  short notice.As always excellent front of house service and excellent check in..Very impressed with the up dated bar menu. Great selection and good price.Tried the burger with the apple wood cheese and I must say it was delicious and tasty.Friendly service and speed check out made the stay enjoyable.,4,2013,01,12
223,Poor Customer Service,"Arrived at 3pm on 30th December and the rooms were not ready, told it would be an hour but when we objected this suddenly became 10min. It was chaos at reception no assistance with the luggage despite struggling with the luggage for 2 adults and 3 children.  The right hand lift was giving problems but no one advised of this.  When we arrived at the rooms it was like a sauna as it was so hot. Despite turning off the radiator and opening the windows it took 13 hours for the room to cool enough for sleep.  Other family members stayed in the hotel and had the same problem in their rooms.  What 4 star hotel doesn't check to see if the rooms are at a comfortable temp.  Who wants to sleep in a sauna.  We were in rooms 101 and 103.  The noise levels were rediculous.  The service levels from reception and bar staff left a lot to be desired.  Breakfast was a major dissapointment.  Even our children were dissapointed with it.  The scrambled egg was tasteless, the fired egg like rubber, the white & black pudding dried out rubber and the rashers long past it.  What child does not like sausages yet our children turned away after tasting them and I agreed with them.  This is supposed to be a 4 star hotel.  The physical structure and fittings are most definately that but the service and attention to detail leave it down is a very big way.  My wife is not in good health and the hotel was aware of this yet they provided crap service and left us feeling we were being taken for granted.  We would never darken their door again after this sad exerience.  I have reviewed hotels in the past and this was the worst 4 star I have stayed in to date ( not because of the physical surroundings but because of the lack of proper service levels applied effectively). Some friends ate at the bar prior to our heading off to a wedding and they were amazed by the limp sandwiches and tired side salads.  You wouldn't get as bad in a seedy bar.  On the following night we stayed in another 4 star hotel which provided us with a brilliant and amazing experience where everything was perfect and the standards were first class.  I know which one I would stay in again and it certainly wouldn't be this one.  At ‚Ç¨139 this hotel was vastly over priced for what was provided yet at ‚Ç¨155 Clontarf castle was cheap and value for money.",2,2013,01,05
223,Perfect Hotel for a break,"iv just stayed here for New Years Eve. We booked a package which included a nights stay with breakfast a cocktail making class ,4 course meal, a live singer  fireworks at 12am and a glass of sparkling wine/hot chocolate to ring in the new year.  upon arrival we were greeted by a red carpet along with the beautifully decorated foyer with Christmas trees  the red carpet was for a wedding that was on in the function room.  The staff were friendly and told us where our room was which was the second floor. The security is a little much as you need a key card to get the lift working and after your exit you need to use the card again to get into the hallway to your room,  if your on the second floor you cant get onto the first  and likewise The rooms were quite modern with a flat screen tv and a purple light over the bath  with the usual toiletries and coffee making facilities. our room had a view of the car park however with a side view of the golf course.  We booked our meal for 8.30pm,  we got there on time and ordered our drinks and food pretty quick and even got a salmon orderve, along with bread rolls  the 5 of us ordered nearly the same thing,  soup starters and beef medallions for the main,  the starter took a few minutes to come but nothing out of the ordinary this is when it all went wrong. Around 15mins after our starter we realised we hadnt had our plates collected and as we were chatting more time passed, around 20 minutes later we were all pretty hungry at this stage and the staff were serving people who had come in before us, my father called the waitress and asked why there was a delay on the main and she said they were out the door with orders for 2 restaurants. After another 20 minutes three out of 5 of us were given plates of food after poking at the meat which was pink ( i ordered well done) the taste seemed funny i presumed i was just being picky but mid chew on my 'beef medallion' the manager came over and said there had been a terrible mistake and they got our order mixed up and we were eating duck  we gave the paltes back but were faced with another 15-20 minute wait before our meals came to the table  we then were faced with 20 minute wait for our choc puddings as the chef had to make them himself, the serving staff dealt with this perfectly and told us that any extras including drinks we ordered were all free of charge and even gave another bottle of sparkling wine, however we did miss most of the entertainment which we paid for and the bar staff in the main bar were so slow serving as there was only 1 poor chap on his own! Apart from the meal taking over 2 hours and the slow bar staff the hotel was clean comfortable and a great location we did enjoy our stay and breakfast the next day was delicious we will be back again.",4,2013,01,02
223,One of Dublin's best kept secrets,"Just back from a fabulous overnighter in Castleknock Hotel and Country Club and I have to say, the customer service, food, spa treatments and general ambiance was fantastic. Violeta at reception was one of the best we have ever come across, her can do approach and the speed in which she got through the queue with a constant smile on her face has to be complimented. I hope the Manager appreciates how good she is at her job. We had a fabulous meal and thoroughly enjoyed the spa treatments and I am nearly afraid to tell you all how cheap it was..99.50 for B/B, Dinner and 50.00 towards spa treatments (Supervalue getaway breaks)...the hotel offer the same deal through their web site for only a little more....The reason I am afraid to tell you all is that when I go to book it again, it will be fully booked out......Well done Castleknoc Hotel and Country Club, you are doing a fine job....",5,2012,12,31
223,superb,"Absolutely gorgeous hotel, staff are wonderfully helpful and the food amazing.  We stayed for the weekend and found everything to a very high standard - the room was warm  with 24 hr heating (not cold as mentioned in previous reviews). We ate in the bistro one night and the Park restaurant another - both have excellent menus and very high quality food and service.",5,2012,12,24
223,Lovely hotel with lots of nice facilities,"This was my second stay at Castleknock hotel. Though it is tucked away, it is a pleasant environment to come back to. There are spa and swimming facilities available, and you can play golf if you want to. Since this was a business trip, I did none of that. Still, it's nice to know that they are there. The bar sitting area is very nice and spacious, and there are lots of lounges about. You can have dinner at the restaurant or near the bar. It's quite high end, so there are no riff raff about.  WIFI is available free of charge in the rooms and in the public areas, so it's convenient to catch up on emails whilst having a bite to eat. Service staff were all polite and efficient. Rooms were big and spacious.",4,2012,12,19
223,Four star on the cheap in Dublin,"We have been back to one of our favourite hotels in Dublin for one night just ¬£44 room only for two people.
The hotel has a casual feel but has all the four star amenities you expect, the radiator in our room was airlocked but was fixed right away.
Breakfast vouchers can be bought the night before for 10 euro each if you wait until morning it is then 16.95 so be warned.
The area has that country feel that we really like,we have been to this hotel over at least five years never been dissapointed and are booked twice in January next time dinner b&b booked through their owm web site at 110 euro for an executive room.",5,2012,12,18
223,night before my wedding :,"hotel is beautiful , staff , rooms amazing . memorable night before my wedding . 
we got room service and the price was brill, food was lovely . bathrooms in this hotel are massive .

best part staff so helpful , friendly 

Thank u for the card :) xx",5,2012,12,18
223,Excellent Venue for Group Event,"I spent a night here attending a school reunion event in June 2012.  Finding the hotel is a bit of a challenge with the myriad of roads going in every direction in that area. I played 18 holes on the very good course (not affiliated with the hotel, but golf packages are available). The reunion dinner and breakfast the next morning were excellent and the service always friendly and attentive.  The rooms are modern and extremely clean.  As Ireland is going through a very turbulent economic period, the prices have become very competitive and attractive for tourists.  I would definitely return here for a short break to golf and relax.",5,2012,12,16
223,unbeatable value,"I spent a night here recently with 5 of my closest firends, we had a Christmas outing here last year too.  It's a great value hotel and well worth watching out for some of the fantastic offers they have.  We did a dinner b & b deal and also there was a bottle of wine in each room.  The rooms are decorated nicely and are comfortable, because of it's location outside noise was not an issue.  Bathrooms are well equiped, one gripe and this is a problem I have with a lot of hotels is the standard of towel they use, especially the one we got at the pool, they are never big enough.  The leisure centre is very nice with the steam room and sauna nicely hot.  Dinner was pleasant and we weren't rushed from the restaurant.  We then sat in the lobby/bar area for a few drinks but it got very cold, we were told that this was due to doors being opened to smoking areas, unfortunately there didn't appear to be anything they could do to rectify the issue.  We did raise it at reception the following morning and receptionist was apologetic.  Breakfast was fine with a nice selection to choose from.  No problem with the staff, all very pleasant and helpful.  Would definitely recommend but especially if you can get an inclusive package.",4,2012,12,15
223,Splendid - Pity about inadequate heating.,"The Hotel is impressive in every way, Well managed, friendly and professional staff and really splendid decor in the common areas. Bar food menu very adequate and Restaurant menu most impressive. We opted to enjoy the bar food which was very good. Room was a reasonable size and nicely decorated. Bed was comfortable and the view was very pleasant. However as someone who has spent a life complaining about overheated Hotels, Restaurants Hospitals etc. I was cold from check in to check out. On arrival the radiator was cold. We called Reception and within minutes a maintainence man arrived. He restored heat which operated for less than 2 hours. We left the room and went to the Bar. Regardless of where we located in the Bar it was as cold as the Bedroom. We returned to the Bedroom where the temperature had dropped well below 15c. Outdoors there was a frost but certainly not a freeze up Look forward to a return stay when temperature has improved.",4,2012,12,14
223,A little disappointed,"My husband and I took 12 Green Course Managers from all over Europe to this hotel last night for dinner... We were a little disappointed with the bar food, even though we had asked to be seated in the dining room.. anyway.. we were seated in the Lime Tree room... The food was average and in fact not enough for 12 hungry men... There was no atmosphere in this hotel at all, even though when we were there for a wedding last March, it seems to have lost its soul over night....Maybe be time of year, so wont rule it out completely.",3,2012,12,11
223,Birthday Stay,"I booked the December Special Package for my husbands birthday recently. The decor, bathroom and golfcourse view in our Executive Room were lovely. All the staff were excellent, a birthday card and little cake in the room on arrival was a lovely touch. Dinner in the Brasserie was delicious, as was the room service breakfast the next morning. The hotel was very busy but we heard no noise whatsoever. The bed was extremely comfortable. The only minor disappointments were the room and bathroom were quite cold eventhough the radiator was on, some areas of the hotel were chilly too, e.g. around the piano area. Some tv channels appeared to have been deleted on our room tv and the bathroom robes listed were missing.",4,2012,12,10
223,Pleasant!,"Stayed here recently for 1 night , nice lobby area to relax and people watch, hotel seemed busy, few Christmas parties on the go. There was no noise from the corridor that night considering, same next morning. Room was fine,had a small fold out couch/bed thing, it was fairly basic but clean, certainly didn't have a luxurious feel to it or anything. There was a separate shower to the bath which I like. The meal we had in The Park restaurant was fabulous, the food is definitely the best I've had in a long time, service was good, wait staff very friendly. Breakfast next morning is a buffet style affair, food was nice cant complain about it at all. Didn't get a chance to try the spa area or pool so can't comment on that. Would stay again.",4,2012,12,09
223,Xmas party,"Had our christmas party here last night.
The menu on the table was the wrong one, when we got the right one there was no turkey and ham on it ? I don't eat beef or salmon so I had to go vegetarian.
My complaint is that the vegetarian option that I ordered, had been microwaved, the pasta wasnt even hot. The plate looked like it had been wiped around the rim but not very well, splatters all round of tomato sauce.
Could not believe the standard of the dish. The salmon and beef came out presented much better. Maybe it's something against vegetarians !!",3,2012,12,08
223,Nice and relaxing,"Stayed here for a night food was lovely room was spotless and very cosy only downside is you could clearly hear the fan outside on the roof, not a big deal though, got an ok nights sleep would definetly visit again :)",4,2012,12,07
223,Great Hotel,"Just home after our second stay at this fab hotel
Will definately be back...staff so friendly, rooms so nice and comfortable etc. etc,
One of my favourites. Restaurants are great, bars so comfy, numerous TV's, and a really good golf course on site also.",5,2012,12,02
223,Nice lunch and pamper package,"Meeting friends here for lunch , we had soup and panini , I found the soup that was unusually served in a cup was very salty , but tasty , panini was very filling and tasty .
The lounge area was very busy and had a great Christmas feel .
Then time for treatments , good back massage and facial , treatment rooms were large , warm , clean , felt warm and cosy throughout treatment which was a bonus. Jenny my therapist was great.
Relaxing room was warm and cosy , the pool was clean , but water felt colder than most swimming pools ,
After treatments we went back to lounge , I ordered lime water as I was driving , he then charged me 2.50 for lime water , what a rip off .
Over all I give lunch and treatments 9 out of 10 , will definately be back for more.",5,2012,12,02
223,Delightful Hotel & Friendly Staff,"I stayed here for quite some time whilst working in Dublin between May and October 2011. Although a bus ride outside the city, the surroundings are lovely and very peaceful. The public areas of the hotel are clean, smart and spacious. There is a lovely pool and a very well-equipped gym. In addition there are beauty treatments and massages available.
All the staff were, without exception, friendly, helpful and polite. It made such a change from other places I have stayed.
The room was a generous size with a comfortable bed, good in-room facilities and a splendid bathroom with bath and walk-in shower. My one small quibble was lack of hot water early in the morning on a couple of occasions, but it was early!
The bar food and room service were good, with good choice. The restaurant was a little hit and miss. I thought the breakfast was over-priced and not that inspiring, there are better places in Dublin city centre for a full Irish, especially on a Sunday morning.
I thought the hotel offered excellent value for money with outstanding facilities in a lovely location and I look forward to returning soon.",5,2012,11,28
223,Wedding weekend at castleknock,"Just returned from weekend at the castleknock hotel.
It s a beautiful building on a fabulous site with golf, leisure and play area for kids.
Even thought this is a large hotel, the lobby and bar area were very warm and had a great atmosphere.
Great food, service and cleanliness of the highest standard .
Plenty of families and couples here.
Wedding service/ food was top notch and we had a great time.
Will definitely return and bring our son with us to enjoy the great facilities this hotel has to offer.",5,2012,11,26
223,Best 4* Hotel I have ever been to!!! Amazing value. Such a nice hotel and country club and exceptional service!!!,"I had the executive double room for a Dublin trip with my gf. From when you enter the hotel, it boasts class and has a great ambience. The room was impressive with a nice view and the staff were so helpful. We came in contact with about 20 staff members on our 4 day trip and not 1 of them let down the team which is rare to find and really made a difference. We ordered room service all the time and they were so nice about it. 4* hotel but definitely a 5* service. The food was very reasonably priced. 23 euro per person (just under 20 quid) for a very nice fancy 4 course dinner (although they count coffee as the fourth course) but starter and main was great. Dessert was phenomenal. One if the best desserts I've had. On the topic of food, (yes we are both foodies) the breakfast can be bought in advance for 10 euros which is amazing for what you get. Make sure u get it the day before. Amazing breakfast buffet trust me its worth it and incredible value. The scrambled eggs melt in ur mouth. Best one I've had by a long shot. The room was very very nice..EXACTLY as shown in the pictures on the site (not always the case with other hotels). The location is alright. You ideally need a car because its about 25 minutes from city centre. However there is a bus stop 5 mins away that takes you to Blanchardstown, a nearby big shipping centre costs around 2 euro 1 way. Train station is 15 minutes walk and goes into city centre for under 3 euro 1 way. So overall amazing hotel, food, staff. Ok location but its a country club as well so didn't expect it to be in the city centre. Better to hire a car. Excellent value and definitely well worth it and would recommend to anyone!",5,2012,11,24
223,Very pleasant stay,"Very friendly staff, arranged a free upgrade for us at reception - very comfortable room, very good value. Location is a little bit out of the way and hard to find but once you get there it is well worth it.",4,2012,11,19
223,Great value,"Went on a Girls night in package with 4 friends, the staff were very friendly, check in/out very efficient, food was very nice, spa treatments well worth it, overall a great night away from home for 105 euro, would definately go again.",4,2012,11,17
223,Great Hotel,"I stayed here for a week on business. The hotel facilities are fantastic, especially the gym and the free wifi. I didn't eat at the restaurant so can't comment. I would definitely recommend this hotel, however the location is not great if you plan on going into Dublin city.",4,2012,11,15
223,Amazing Hotel,"Stayed for two nights recently. This is a great hotel, friendly staff in every area. Good Food served in the bar and Restaurant. Clean and comfortabel room. The decor is beautiful.
I would highly recommend this Hotel. Also good value for money! Hope to be back soon.",5,2012,11,14
223,Fabulous,"Stayed for three nights, great value, lovely large room with spacious bathroom. Spotlessly clean.
Friendly helpful staff, Beautiful lounges, dining and reception areas, set in lovely grounds.Great choice for breakfast.Country location just a short drive into city, 
Good security features and no disturbance from other areas of hotel.",5,2012,11,12
223,Great Value !!,"Stayed for one night on a ‚Ç¨79 per person B&B and evening meal deal (including weekends). Really great value. Lovely pool.  Very nice pleasant staff at reception. Rooms nice & quiet and they were happy to put in an extra camp bed for a child at no extra cost. Hotel is very clean & well maintained. Breakfast would have been better if the bacon was cooked properly. Sausages scrumptious & I'm not not usually keen on them. They had a lovely herb taste....the bacon was fatty & could be better cooked. Bacon needs to be crispy but in fairness most hotels serve it this way. Aside from the buffet breakfast menu you could order salmon, kippers, omelettes,  fresh pancakes & maple syrup - nice to have this choice too. All staff were friendly & attentive. The location is lovely too. It feels like your in the middle of the country yet you can be in Blanchardstown Shopping centre in 10 minutes.  I'd definatelty go back. ",4,2012,11,11
223,Amazing value and beautiful hotel.,"My partner and I stayed here for one night in October. We availed of their 'Autumn deal' where we got one night's stay, breakfast and dinner included, wine on arrival and full use of the leisure facilities all for 59euro. We did not know what to expect from the hotel but when we arrived we were greeted with a friendly tone and atmosphere, the staff are extremely helpful and pleasant at reception. 
Our room was lovely and we cannot fault it. We dined in 'The Park' restaurant in the hotel and the food was delicious however it is quite expensive if you add on extra's to your meal. A bottle of water is around 6euro. The restaurant staff were nice, too but some improvements could be made to their manner, but nothing major. The restaurant is beautifully decorated and the view out the window are so enjoyable. 
The Lime Tree bar closes early and so, we were a little disappointed with that but there is a main bar where you can sit and enjoy quiet drinks. 
The location is great if you arent from Dublin, it is only a few minutes down from the Phoenix park but it would be necessary to have the car with you if you plan to go out on daytrips. 
The swimming pool is huge and the view from there too is great. The only problem was the steam room was not working during out visit but we enjoyed the sauna. 
Overall, a really enjoyable stay and almost faultless hotel. The prices and deals they offer are amazing and we could not believe the offer we got. I will definitely be returning to this hotel very soon.",4,2012,11,10
223,The worst hotel I ever stayed in - Halloween Horror!,"This hotel is advertised as a spa hotel but if you want to relax in comfort avoid this hotel. I thought I was booking a pampering holiday for my wife and myself since Castleknock Hotel & Country Club is a four star hotel. We asked for a quiet room but I don't think such a place exists in this hotel. Every night the corridors were like the Children's Olympics with out of control children racing up and down and shouting all night long. Sitting in the foyer was a similar experience. The whole hotel seemed like an anarchic nightmarish children's playground where neither parents nor staff made any attempt to quieten the unruly children. We are parents ourselves but we have never experienced such noise.
The swimming pool spa was a desperate disappointment. The swimming pool was small with a very small area available for non professional swimmers. The water at the bottom of the Jacuzzi was permanently cold. The changing rooms were a disgrace and in need of redecorating. The swimming was totally basic and functional with no water massages or water therapies. There was nothing aesthetic or appealing about the environment.
The selection of main course food on the bar menu was limited to burgers and quite expensive. If you didn't want to eat burgers every day you could eat in a very functional restaurant at outrageous prices.
When checking out the receptionist asked us how was our stay and we told her the truth and gave her our completed customer comment cards. She said a manager would contact us but we have not received the courtesy of this promised contact. I didn't expect to be treated with such contempt and indifference because the only saving grace of this hotel was the rest of the staff (apart from the manager who didn't bother contacting us). The rest of the staff were superb. I would go so far as to say that they were the best, most courteous, most attentive staff we have ever met in any hotel. What a shame the hotel didn't match the staff. It saddens me to have to write such a negative review but we booked this hotel for comfort and pampering and we wrongly believed that a four star spa hotel would rejuvenate and energise us. We will never return and we cannot recommend this hotel to anybody based on our experiences. It is difficult to find and after our experiences there we are sorry that we did find it. We are even sorrier we wasted a week of our lives there. We wasted our time and our money. How this hotel can claim to be a Four Star Hotel is beyond belief. We appreciated the exceptional courtesy of the staff but they and us and all future customers deserve a better hotel. Go elsewhere.",1,2012,11,08
223,Great value for money,"Stayed in this hotel for three nights. Excellent location for golfing holiday but we found it to far from Dublin city centre for us, although the bus was only a five minute walk from hotel and only cost 235 euro each person but the journey time is about 45 mins longer when travelling back from Dublin at peak times. Breakfast very good. We were room only but bought breakfast vouchers for 9 euro per person per day, well worth it. This hotel offers great accommodation if you just want to get away from it all and relax, but also great for groups either to golf or indulge in the spa. Would definitely visit again and highly recommend a visit. Beautiful location. ",4,2012,11,06
223,What a place I'll be back...,"My girlfriend and I stayed here from October 29th to November 1st and I have to say top hotel.

On arrival we where great by a very friendly and very helpful lady on the front desk I who's I had got her name. But gave me all the info we needed to get around the city how to get there buss time just covered all bases. The same lady also checked us out on our departure day and again was so helpful phoning another one of their hotels in the city for us to drop our bags too. A massive 10/10 for the front desk.

We only ate on the hotel once and that was out in the bar we did have a look at the al a carte menu but after a long day just wanted some thing simple. The food was great not a bad word to say about the service or the food at all.

The bar staff where great very friendly and helpful and just very genuine when they had a chat with you.

Now on to the room as I have worked in hotels for a while now covering all departments I like to snoop a little around the room... The room was spotless not one bit of dust or a mark out of place was great the room was serviced each day fresh towels sheets and all toiletries where fresh every day the room had everything we needed. Only one point I did make about the room and really the hotel is the heating just didn't seem to be too warm even on its highest setting. But again I put this on the comment card and handed it in on check out and two days later a personal email from the floor manager just another bit of fantastic customer service 

Castleknock hotel over all it's just a beautiful hotel in a fantastic setting I have already recommended it to friends and family and I will certainly be returning myself in the near future and yes I would strongly recommend this hotel to whom ever reads this review.",5,2012,11,05
223,Very pleasant stay!,"Myself and my mum stayed in this hotel during the summer and we both really enjoyed our visit. We got a package deal which included one nights stay with a 3 course meal, breakfast and a spa treatment each. Our bedroom was quite big with a brilliant view of the golf course. Unfortunately we stayed on one of the hottest days of the year and our room was so hot we didn't sleep very well infact not at all. I understand there not being air con in most hotels in Ireland, as we don't usually have good weather but for a hotel of this standard I suggest getting it fitted. There was also a lot of noise which I suspect was coming from some sort of fan perhaps on the swimming pool roof which was just outside our window. It was really unbearable and I was so exhausted the next day when I got home I felt like I needed to go on another break away :-) Luckily I had my spa treatment to look forward to and help me relax a bit. We both enjoyed our 3 course meal very much. As far as I can remember I got fish and a really lovely sweet potato gratin which I ended up trying to make myself when I got home. The hotel really gives off a sort of homely feel, there was a really relaxed atmosphere inside at the bar and also outside where there is a bar and a little playground for kids. I remember on the day they had sunscreen out for guests to use as they wished which I felt was a really nice touch and showed that they actually cared for their guests. The staff at the hotel desk were very friendly as far as I can remember. The waiters at breakfast were also very nice, helpful and quick to attend to us. We both really enjoyed our Spa treatments just before we checked out of the hotel. I would definitely consider coming back to this hotel but would avoid it at all costs on a hot day!",4,2012,11,05
223,Great Hotel,"My second time staying here, Myself and boyfriend stayed for 2 nights had great time.  When we arrived the staff so friendly, we asked for smoking room when booking and was free but receptionist advise us that wedding on friday  night and be very loud, so we changed our mind and stayed non smoking, thought very nice to let us know this.   I had hot stone massage which was lovely and relaxing and my boyfriend used the gym and pool.  The resturant is lovely very high standards.  The bar nice and relaxing with good comfy sofas and music Friday night keep us entertained. the rooms were lovley and spacious. only bad thing was room can get very cold or warm and also at times felt bar was cold.",4,2012,11,05
223,Casleknock rocks!,"We absolutely loved our stay at the hotel. It's a little outside of Dublin city, but it was a wonderfully quirt place to rest after a long day of youring Dublin. Downstairs, there was always something going on, which was great if we wanted to get involved. The courteous staff was always willing to help and we were shocked that the attendant at breakfast had remembered our names the next day; an unexpected personal touch. The only downside is not the fault of the hotel but my GPS, the GPS suggested the quickest way back to downtown Dublin, which uses very tight roads. A cab driver later showed us a better way using major throughfares, I suggest using Google Maps or Mapquest next time. We will defnitely be coming back again. If your a golfer, there is a course right here!",4,2012,10,30
223,"Great Hotel, lovely settings","I had an excellent stay at the Castleknock. Well located, not too far by cab from the main centre, but in the country a bit so lovely and quiet. Well appointed, fabulous gym, staff very accommodating, and a good breakfast buffet, what more could you ask for?  Well done Castleknock!  Also a great shopping centre located very close by, so even though out of the city you can get everything you want, also includes a supermarket.",4,2012,10,29
223,Could have been so much better,"I booked this hotel based on the excellent reviews on TripAdvisor. The hotel itself is nice, well presented throughout and it looked like it was going to be a lovely stay. 

I paid for my wife to have some spa treatments carried out. The spa was nice according to my wife, although, having pre-booked hot stone head and back massage, the girl got it wrong and gave her a leg massage. My wife was too shy to say anything, and presumed that I had booked the wrong treatment. 

My email correspondence confirms that i had booked the head and back massage. It was a pity, but we decided not to complain. A little bit unprofessional to get something so wrong, but being typical Irish, we just got on with it. 

When I booked in, I did not have an Irish credit card, so I told them to take for anything with my Irish Visa debit card as I go along. This was not a problem. 
I was excited to see the room, as I was told I was to get an Executive Room. When I entered, I thought it was a nice room, but was a little disappointed that the TV was just a small set that you get in a standard room, and not the larger screen as described for an Executive Room. 
This was only because this trip was to be a relaxing time away and we knew we would spend an hour here and there watching some TV or a movie in bed, since we don't get the chance anymore with a recent new born baby. 
It wasn't the end of the world, just a pity.

So, having availed of a 2 night b&b package with one evening meal, we got spruced up and skipped down to have our dinner... This was where it was such a let down. The Park Restaurant has such excellent reviews and a seemingly great reputation. Well, when we ordered the wine, we where asked if we wanted water, so we said OK... we didn't think we would be paying for the water, which showed up on the bill! The wine was ‚Ç¨26 alone. 

We ordered the Steak which came with a ‚Ç¨6 surcharge. I asked for medium well... it was terrible... Burned underneath, and I feel like they just fobbed it off to me since I was on the cheapo deal. My wife's was OK. 

Having shared some wine together and once again, not complaining so as not to ruin the atmosphere, I just said the meal was fine. I kick myself for being so polite, because of how things went thereafter...  as we left the table, I walked towards the area where you wait to be seated, where the was a girl booking another couple in for their meal... As I walked over, a girl ran over, as if I was trying to get away without paying, to ask if I had paid! I was not picking up her mannerisms wrong... Both my wife and i looked at each other as much to say, ""calm down, we're going to pay""...  I remained polite, but was a little embarrassed and explained that I was going to the most obvious focal point in the area to settle up... I was asked what room I was at, and singed a receipt. I asked if it could be taken for now as I did NOT have a credit card on file, just a Visa Debit. The girl said that was fine, no problem. So I've paid as far as I'm concerned.

The next morning my wife decided to sleep in a little while I went for Breakfast alone. I was herded to a seat in the middle of everyone, when I wanted to choose where to sit as there were AT LEAST 15 empty tables. Yet again, I kept my mouth shut... I'm not they type to make a fuss (That has got to be obvious after the Spa and the Steak and the panic caused as we left the dinner table)... The breakfast was OK. Not great compared to other hotels, but it was OK. 

Now this is where it was getting on my nerves... THREE times I was approached to ask what was my room number... I was beginning to think, do I look like a scumbag??? 
As I left the table to go back to my room, a receptionist came jogging towards me... She said she had forgotten to take my credit card and I owed some money from the meal last night... I couldn't believe it... I told her that SHE was the girl that booked me in and I explained the whole Visa situation... There was a genuine and definite sense of panic and the 2 girls behind the desk made me feel, once again, that I was somehow trying to get away with not paying!

I had left ‚Ç¨100 with the Spa up front, I had left ‚Ç¨100 behind the bar and I had paid for bottled water that I was not aware I would be paying for, and wine... Why are the other guests not being hounded like this?, I wondered.

I told the girl that I had paid, and said that I was annoyed with how I was being approached both by them, and the staff in the restaurant and breakfast area. She was a nice girl, and I felt bad for being a little snappy, but c.mon! This is our time away! I can't believe how I was treated... I still had another night to go, IF I do owe money, do I not settle up on that day????????????

So that night, we decided not to go near the bar or restaurant. I was left feeling awkward and we spent the day in the room. 

The morning we booked out, the shift manager came out and explained that I had not paid for the wine (and bloody water) and that I had signed the bill, but it was not taken. So I apologised and said take for it now then!... See... I wasn't gonna run away!

All in all, a nice looking hotel, good rooms, food was poor, (I genuinely feel like I was fobbed off with a badly cooked steak since I was not as important because we took the freebie meal) and everything there is quite expensive... 

If I had not been hounded like I was, we may have enjoyed our stay... I wouldn't recommend it because of this, but it is a personal experience, and obviously most other guests are treated with the respect they deserve and get the meal cooked well, and the correct treatments they ordered. All i can tell you is that I am not a liar, and as a Salesperson for over 10 years, I know what good customer service is, and I can gauge how we were viewed and treated, and it was not good. 

I hope you enjoy if you do go, but we can't get our 2 days back that I had booked for my wife and I to relax and get a break after the birth of our first baby (who was unwell for the first few months)... We really needed this, and I feel like it was spoiled for us, either because of my appearance or because we got a package deal (through another group) that was considerably cheaper than booking directly with the hotel. 

All the apologies in the world won't change that, (not that we got one), but I'm guessing the reply by management will rhyme off the usual ""high standards"" and ""apologies if you felt that way"", and ""I'll pass on to the spa"" and ""feel free to contact to discuss further"" etc etc etc... 

No, your staff should have ensured we felt special on this much needed break and we should have got the treatments ordered and the food cooked as well as most other guests claim theirs were... Too many niggles that I was kind enough to keep my mouth shut about and get on with it, and we went home feeling like we should have went to Slieve Russell Hotel where we went when my wife was pregnant, and we felt like we were treated really well (eventhough we got a special offer deal for their too!!!)... 

Three stars are because the Hotel is nice, and we could have potentially had a lovely time.
We deserved better Castleknock Hotel and Country Club. Shame on you for spoiling a break that we, and especially my wife, really really needed.",3,2012,10,26
223,A let down,"Myself and my fiancee stayed here for 2 nights a few weeks ago. While the hotel is impressive and the setting is lovely we felt let down by the service. On the first night we couldn't get to sleep with the noise from the function room & the smoke alarm going off several times!
We complained the next morning and were told our bags would be moved to an alternative room, when we returned that evening we contacted the desk & they were unaware of the situation. 
We eventualy got moved to another room which was much quieter.
Also when a waiter was bringing us our drinks at one stage in the reception he dropped the tray and spilled the driks over us! It felt somewhat like faulty towers....
The spa & swimming pool were of good quality.
The buffet breakfast was very nice but the evening meal left a lot to be desired.",2,2012,10,23
223,Very Nice Hotel,"Great value!  Very nicely appointed, clean, large and comfortable rooms.  Only complaint is that you need to be 6ft plus to be able to use the clothes hangers  as the clothes rain is very high off the floor.  Great bathroom with excellent water pressure in the shower stall.   Toilet water supply was slightly inadequate.   As another reviewer noted,  the mood lightening is inadequate when you wish to read in bed.   Good desk to work from.   Excellent free Internet connectivity.  Interestingly, I have to specifically ask for the Internet password, it was not provided to me at check-in.   The hotel is off the beaten track along typical winding Irish local roads.  You really need your own car to get to and from it.   Directions provided by the hotel both online and at the desk are somewhat incorrect as they have no been updated in some time or arrive in the daytime if this is your first visit to this location.",4,2012,10,22
223,Excellent hotel,"Just back from another lovely weekend in Castleknock. Had a problem with our room when we arrived and the Receptionist moved us immediately,we even had the keys brought to us for the new room. Breakfast is plentiful with a range of options and staff are always keen to please. A very enjoyable weekend. For any shoppers out there we took a drive to the Kildare Outlet village (about 45 minutes away) it was lovely and plenty of bargains to be had,well worth a visit",5,2012,10,22
223,Good quality Hotel - fairly isolated though.,"Good quality Hotel and great value. Staff good, though looked a little overstretched at busy times.  Room comfortable and large - better than average. One thing that annoyed me - and a feature of most Hotels these days, is that there is inadequate lighting in the bedroom. I, for one, do not like mood lighting which cannot be adjusted to provide adequate illumination.",5,2012,10,20
223,"Great Hotel, close to Dublin.","The Hotel is 15/20 minutes far from Dublin city center.   Inspite of that, the hotel is quite and relaxing being in the middle of a great golf course and not far from the big park of Phoenix.
The atmosphere is very elegant, and the rooms are clean, luminous and relaxing: you can't listen any noice at all. Restaurant is good and breakfast in the morning offer a full selection of fruit, croissant, fruit juice, toast, marmalade and bacon and eggs.
I was in Dublin for business and, as I don't like the noise and confusion of the city, I really enjoyed in the night to walk around the hotel and re axing in the green and treesl.   The only point is that you really need a car to drive forth and back, as the Hotel has no connection with the city, but taxi.     I suggest the Hotel to anybody that want to relax, not good for people that are looking for crouded pub with music and beer.",4,2012,10,15
223,A well-deserved weekend away in a ‚Äúquiet‚Äù country retreat‚Äù ‚Ä¶you are ‚Äúkidding‚Äù me right!,"I recently decided to take my amazing wife away for a well-deserved break and rest. I thought long and hard about the right destination until finally I noticed the Castleknock Hotel ‚ÄúThe hotel is accessible for those seeking a city break or a ‚Äúquiet‚Äù country retreat‚Äù.  My elderly parents were good enough to take our kids who are 8 and 2 so as you can imagine a full night‚Äôs sleep was high on the agenda. We arrived at the hotel on Friday evening and were greeted by a very pleasant receptionist who checked us in. As we left the ‚Äúelegant and classic‚Äù reception and we made our way to our room. That evening we had something to eat in nearby Castleknock village and then returned to the hotel where we had 2 drinks in the hotel bar (where the staff were very friendly) and then went to bed. All was quiet until 4am, when we were suddenly awoken by individuals racing each other up and down the corridor and then locking each other out of their rooms.  I was not impressed. After 15 mins of this, I made my way out into the corridor to see what was going on and met a lady in her pajamas shouting and screaming and trying to re-enter her room using her fist.  I spoke to the lady and explained that there were other guests staying in the hotel‚Ä¶for which I received ‚Äúoh right sorry about that‚Ä¶‚Äù. The first night ruined! 

Day 2 starts (feeling more tired than when we arrived) and we headed off to Blanchardstown for a couple of hours, we later returned to the hotel and again went for something to eat in Castleknock village followed by a drink in the hotel bar. We went off to bed early to get a rest before we headed back home on Sunday however some of the other guests had other ideas‚Ä¶.remember a ‚Äúquiet‚Äù country retreat‚Äù anyway, same deal again except a little earlier this time, 2am it kicked off, my wife wouldn‚Äôt let me go out this time so I called reception and security were deployed to deal with the situation which they did and after an hour we got back to sleep.  The next morning we dragged ourselves down to reception and paid our bill after which we were asked ‚Äúdid you enjoy your stay with us‚Ä¶‚Äù I know we Irish are not good for complaining but I had to explain our experience after which out of know where a duty manager appeared and we were quickly shuffled away into the ‚Äúwedding room‚Äù away from the rest of the guests who were checking out at that time. Anyway I was delighted to see our feedback was being taken seriously so once we were in the wedding room I explained I was just answering the question honestly and we did not want ‚Äúanything‚Äù, my wife was now upset as we were going home more tired that we arrived so we just wanted to leave.  The Duty Manager thanked us for giving the feedback and agreed that it was unacceptable and explained that on Saturday night there was an UK IT Company staying and there were over 200 guests. She insisted that she would make a Hotel Manager aware of our feedback, took my contact number and ensured us that the Hotel Manager would be in contact first thing Monday morning. It has now been 6 days and we never heard back from the Castleknock Hotel and Country Club‚Ä¶

I can understand that it is difficult to control all guests but we specifically asked for a quiet room and unfortunately our well-deserved weekend away in this ‚Äúquiet‚Äù country retreat‚Äù was ruined.",2,2012,10,13
223,Does what it says on the tin..,"Hotel looks fantastic from outside. looks goo in side as well very large, food good pool small not that good to swim in also take a shower cap they charge for them and you canni get in with out one.
Rooms large clean warm everthing you need.
Nothing around the hotel with out a taxi or car.",4,2012,10,12
223,Hard to fault!,"Very helpful and empowered staff - went out of their way to make any requests happen immediately. Being part of a large group, the evening meal was suprisely quick to arrive (not preordered) and everyone said their food was excellent. Rooms also excellent - Sat TV, hairdryer and even hair straighteners (although not everyone had these). Huge range of toiletries and extras in bathroom such as lip cream, mini shaving kit. It is 30mins from Dublin centre, so was OK for a meeting, golf and spa, but if you want to be a tourist, then maybe you would stay in the City Centre.",5,2012,10,11
223,"Lovely, but not easy to get into the city","We can't really fault this lovely hotel. We stayed for 3 nights in October 2012. The staff were really friendly and helpful, rooms were great, swimming pool/ sauna/ steam room was a real added bonus that we took advantage of. The only downside is that it is a not well located to get in & out of Dublin city. The no 37 bus took at least 1/2 hour (and longer in the way back) - taxi cost about 15 euro.
But that aside, we would definitely recommend this, especially if you want to mix some leisure time with seeing what the city has to offer",4,2012,10,08
223,Relaxing stay,"I spent one night here with my husband on a business function. The staff were lovely and very helpful allowing us to check-in early as I am 33 weeks pregnant! The room was great, very modern, with a big bed and the bathroom has a separate bath and walk-in shower. The bath was lovely! Really deep and long - very relaxing for me!! 

I had a pre-natal back and leg massage at the spa and it was the best massage I've had anywhere. It was advertised at 45 minutes - usually this means from when they take you in, but then you dither around for 10/15 minutes and get a 30 minute actual treatment - but this was different, had a very relaxing 5/10 minutes on the bed in the relaxation room first, was taken to a treatment room and then actually massaged for the full 45 minutes, or possibly a little longer even! It was absolute heaven!! The girl doing the massage, Andrea, even took the time afterwards to explain how she had done my feet so I could pass the info on to my husband so he can help with my fluid retention problems!

We went for a swim later too, the pool is nice and warm, not great for proper swimming - it's not very long, but very nice for relaxing in and with a lovely view out to the golf course/green area. 

We had a function dinner which was very nice, food was lovely and very plentiful - I don't think half the platters of veggies were eaten at our table! And extra jugs of gravy were brought out too which was a nice touch. 

Breakfast in the morning was great as well - it's all buffet style, although you could order extras like smoked salmon for an additional ‚Ç¨3 cost. I found what was there to be grand though. Lovely little pastries and very tasty fresh soda bread as well as the usual cereals and hot buffet breakfast. There were also cold meats, cheeses and fruits. 

I would definitely recmommend this hotel, especially the spa!",5,2012,10,07
223,Large hotel quite a way out of town,"Nice enough hotel but it's quite a distance from the city. Breakfast was lacking and I was in room 263 in the beginning which overlooked the very noisy aircon unit however ever they moved me.
The gym was fantastic - best bit of the hotel, and the Swiming pool looks lovely",3,2012,10,06
223,Faultless,"I recently stayed at the Castleknock Hotel & Country Club on a business trip for a night and I must say I was very impressed.  I've stayed in lots of hotels and for the price, service and experience it was faultless.  I really have nothing negative to say.

I checked in and the front staff were friendly and helpful.  My room was huge, the bed was enormous and the bath/shower room was spotless.  Prices at the bar weren't bad either and the Guinness was very good.  I didn't eat dinner in the restaurant as we went to the village but the breakfast buffet was good quality and the service was attentive and polite.

I'll certainly be staying here again next time I come to Dubin.

Thank you Castleknock Hotel & Country Club for a great stay.",5,2012,09,28
223,gorgeous hotel.. 2 nights stay,"fab hotel will def go again its in a lovely area... we stayed in executive room which was beautiful stayed for 2 nights staff so helpful room was cleaned wit new towels and bottled water...breakfast was bit on the expensive side.. only thing i was dissapointed about was the spa, the girl on reception also did my treatments i was booked in for a 25 mins back massage and indian head massage for 15 mins at 40 euro which was not bad, my appointment was for 6pm but didnt get started till nearly 6.15pm they were suppose to last for 40 mins but she finished and it seemed so quick .. as she finished and left the room i looked at my phone it was 6.35 .. it only lasted really 20mins.. was not happy at all as i payed 40euro and only lasted that length.. that was the only downfall i had",4,2012,09,27
223,Great value - nice hotel and testing golf course,"I have stayed here twice, the second time being this week. Both times my stay has been excellent with great service and good food. The value this time was exceptional with a room and breakfast for under ¬£75. The bedrooms are above standard but could do with a little maintenance and the general ambiance of the place is one of a bust efficient modern hotel. The hotel also has a spa with pool, jacuzzi and sauna (pool was rather hot for serious swimming). I played the golf course last time I stayed and it is a good test of golf being well kept and with good greens. Highly recommend this hotel for a great value break especially if you want a round of golf as well.",4,2012,09,27
223,great weekend stay,I was here for two night stay cant say enough about this hotel really was a lovely stay.On checking in the staff could not be more helpful and very friendly.The rooms are spacious and all you could want trouser press and iron board with three women we needed all.We ate both nights in hotel and found the staff again to be very efficient and most of all very professional the food was of high standard it was my birthday and brought out a lovely cake and sang happy birthday to me it was really a lovely touch.We used the leisure facilities and was again a well run area very clean and given towels everything here in this hotel is of top quality but really it is it's staff thats makes the hotel.,5,2012,09,24
223,very pleasant 2 day stay,I had contacted the hotel prior to booking and again to check that a cot would be available and each time I got a prompt and courteous reply. On checking in and indeed throughout our stay the staff were both efficient and friendly. The rooms were a good size with a large double bed and included trouser press and iron/board aswell as the usual facilities. We had not booked breakfast prior to arriving but we did purchase one each morning. We were advised by the staff at check-in that it was cheaper to purchase the day before which is what we did. The food was excellent. We had a very enjoyable two days there and would look forward to staying there again.,5,2012,09,21
223,Great stay! Lovely hotel,"My wife & i stayed at castleknock for my 30th bday on 12th sept for 2 nights. this was our 2nd stay at the hotel and this time was just as good as the 1st. in short, the hotel is lovely & very clean. food, drink, staff, rooms, golf course & spa are all very good! Not too far out if city centre either so bus and taxi reasonably priced...we highly recomend & we will be back for a 3rd stay.

Mr&Mrs Curran",5,2012,09,20
223,Very solid 4 star hotel,"Spent a lovely 2 nights here in Sept 12. 

The hotel itself is very clean and the public areas modern and stylish. We stayed in a standard room, and it is as you expect: somewhat basic decor but very clean and had all of the desirable extras. Bathroom was excellent. We booked the 'romantic package' which included wine, rose petals, chocolates, candles and oil on arrival. This was perhaps the only real let down as I don't feel it was worth the 75 euro price tag for 5 choccys, unscented tealight candles and synthetic rose petals...sort it out castleknock! 

The staff at the hotel were brilliant, very helpful with all requests, if a little difficult to reach via the phone at busy times. 

Spa services/gym/pool all very good. All set in a lovely part of Dublin...what's not to like?! 

You can reach the hotel via the number 37 bus from the city centre, there is a short walk from the stop however. Alternatively it's a 20 euro taxi from O'Connell st. 

All in all would stay again",4,2012,09,19
223,Amazing Wedding Weekend,"We were married in Castleknock hotel in August and I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of the staff for the amazing day they provided us with! Everything was exceptional, from we checked in we had the most fantastic time, the rooms are lovely and breakfast is excellent. We had a small function the evening before the wedding the food provided was plentiful and delicious. The wedding itself ran like clockwork thanks in no small part the the amazing team of staff! The food was excellent and the service was impeccable we could not have asked for more. It surpassed all of our expectations of the perfect day. I can not recommend it highly enough. Everyone had a wonderful time and mentioned how good the hotel was!

Thank you so much for our amazing big day
Kind regards

223,Great Irish service,"I was here for work for 3 days and as I'm Irish, but don't live in Ireland, I was delighted to experience real Irish hospitality in front of my other colleagues while there. The staff are excellent. Dee, the lady @ breakfast remembered my order after the 1st morning each time. The breakfast is great and the foyer was excellent too. We ate there a few times and I would recommend the chicken wings for great flavour. Room was also very comfortable and when I had issues with wifi, reception were very helpful. Recommend it!",5,2012,09,12
223,"Good bed, great atmosphere","Stay here for one weekend, it is very nice, but it is really a golf hotel, but is fine also if you want a more quiet weekend, and same time have the opportunity to visit Dublin City center. 

+ Bed and room
+Free entrance to jacuzzi (very hot) and pool. You have steam and normal sauna. 
+Service and staff
+/- location (great surroundings, a little uncentral)
-Breakfast could be included and a little more interesting, but was ok.
-16 euro with taxi one way to city (35 euro from Airport)",4,2012,09,05
223,Our Wonderful Wedding Day,"What can I say about our wedding day except it was just perfect! Everything about the day went so well and we are just so delighted we chose Castleknock Hotel. Everything from the food, service, exceptional staff, beautiful rooms and how well everyone looked after us was just outstanding. We especially want to thank Audrey, Leona and Nicola.They were just fantastic with all the preparations and organisation for our big day. They are fantastic at what they do! We also want to especially thank Sylvia, Fiona, a lovely receptionist ( unfortunately I did not get her name) and the Night Manager that was on duty the night of the wedding. Again they were just fantastic and anything we asked was done without question.

All the guests that attend the wedding are still talking about how wonderful the hotel was, some of our relations are booked in again for October! :-)They all have said the meal was beautiful, lovely and hot and the staff were so professional and friendly. The pool etc was used by a lot of the guests also and they thought it was so clean and relaxing!

If you are thinking of booking your wedding here, you will not be disappointed! I would highly recommend it!We are already looking forward to coming back for our first anniversary meal!

Thank you again Castleknock Hotel",5,2012,09,01

223,"Excellent Hotel well finished interior ,food excellent and good facilities","Great stay in this hotel for two nights with our son , enjoyed the gym and the pool and spa are very good , our stay included breakfast and 1 evening meal.
breakfast was to a very good standard and great choice 
dinner was excellent with fantastic flavours in all the food 
very easy to get to and wonderful surroundings just out of city centre but you can be in the centre within 10 minutes or can go to Blanchardstown shopping and entertainment centre  which is only 5 minutes away with no parking charges and lots to do including bowling,cinema, restaurants , and shopping .
Staff were very good and we enjoyed the few days .",5,2012,08,30
223,Location! location! Location!,"We have just returned from a 3 night family midweek break and loved the fact that the hotel was located in a country setting yet adjacent to within minutes of everything we wanted to do with the kids top notch! Staff were very friendly throughout in particular reception! I have too agree with other previous reviews bar food choice's limited and pricy! Had lunch in the golf club! Much nicer and better value. Rooms were very warm and we had to make do with a fan which was a bit noisy, however all in all we really enjoyed our stay and we will definitely be returning in the near future! Great family value for your money! Well done to all concerned! the Byrnes from Galway!",4,2012,08,29
223,Superb Staff,"Just back from 2 nights in the Castleknock Hotel, and was very impressed. Top marks to the hotel staff for warmth, friendliness and helpfulness.... from the first phonecall to book the rooms, to the warm welcome at reception, friendly cleaning and room service staff, and attentive and efficient restaurant staff. The hotel itself is modern, comfortable, family friendly, and close to Dublin, but it is the staff that set it apart. We will definitely be back.",5,2012,08,29
223,Nice Hotel nice staff nice breakfast,Stayed for a wedding recently. Stayed two nights.Rooms are very nice with a bath and a separate shower. TV would not turn off using the remote. Staff are very helpful and friendly. Didn't make use of the pool and leisure centre but by all accounts it is very nice. Would definitely stay here again. Castleknock village nearby is nice with a few restaurants and pubs and the Anglers Rest is a lovely old style turf fire restaurant/pub. Breakfast was very nice.,4,2012,08,27
223,Very dissapointed ......,"Well we arrived at the hotel and was very impressed, but then it all went down hill........

We upgraded to an exec room which cost ¬£90 extra and wasn't worth it, the straightners provided didn't straighten my hair, the robes were tired and tatty, we had to ask for the comp water that is advertised on the web site, and just to top it off there was a huge fan right outside our window, when I asked reception what it was they explained it was from the spa, well it was on a timer it didn't go off till 11pm every night and came back on at 6am, I'm 32 weeks pregnent and it was ment to be a relaxing weekend, it was the worst sleep I've Eva had, they did upgrade us on the Sunday but they moved us 2 doors down the corridor, we could still hear the fan so was a bit pointless, and the noise on the corridors wasn't any better.

The food is ment to be top notch but I found it far from it, the breakfast was something u expect from a back street cafe? The bacon was pale and hard, the fried eggs looked like there had been there hours, but we ate breakfast at the advertised best time 8am, must say dee was lovely tho

The Saturday night we booked to eat in the park restaurant, not cheap so expected the best, my fillet was far from it, costing 34 euros it was undercooked, I asked for it medium but it came out rare, and being pregnent I can't eat it like that, they did offer to cook more but wanted to eat with my partner, so left half of it, wasn't offered any dessert so we got up and asked for our bill, the manager didn't say sorry all the staff were stood in a huddle chatting .

I am very dissapointed really expected something special, will not returning or recommending to friends",2,2012,08,27
223,Lovely friendly hotel in a great location,"Weve stayed in Castleknock a few times

Hotel is set right beside the golf course - and only 5 minutes from Dublin zoo - great location
Staff are friendly, rooms are first class. The hotel is very family friendly(we have 3 young kids) - this is the main reason for loving the hotel, we were totally at ease

Only downside is that the menu for the bar food is a little limited, and restaurant is expensive- but wouldn't put me off staying again

",4,2012,08,21
223,Lovely hotel for a chillout weekend away,"Stayed here for 2 night deal inclusive of 1 evening meal.  Hotel in nice location 10min drive from city centre & 5min drive from phoenix park & dublin zoo.  Executive room was spacious, clean & nicely decorated.  Had dinner in the Park restaurant on the 1st night, definitely worthy of its AA rosette.  Our complimentary meal the next night was also in the Park restaurant & again was beautiful & there were no kids so you had peace to enjoy your meal.  Booked the couples spa day which was fantastic.  Live entertainment in the bar each night however there were lots of kids running around & were quite noisy & that was right up until midnite.  I thought I read hotel policy was no kids in bar after 9.30pm.  Maybe I was wrong but this put me of returning to the hotel again & it was clear to see other couples aswell as staff in the bar were not impressed either.  All in all great hotel but I would advise if you want a chillout weekend without the kids make sure you avoid the school holidays.",4,2012,08,18
223,We will not be staying there again,"We are back from a weekend at this hotel. We were disappointed overall. The only positives were the cleaning staff and the kind helpful gentleman on reception at night. 
The rooms were too hot with no temperature control or ventilation so we had to keep our windows open & listen to all of the noise of late night revellers outside. In all our group occupied 3 rooms and this was the case in all. The food was poor and the breakfast was terrible. 

First off - when booking we requested rooms close together to suit my elderly mother - but at check -in this was not available - the only way to avoid a long trek was to opt for a room closer to the lift on another floor. 

We had bar food the first night - it wasn't good and was overpriced. The next night we availed of the meal included in the package - we were given a limited menu for those on such a deal and informed that we could order from the A la carte menu for an additional ‚Ç¨23! The food was not good - my chicken was a tired and dry looking offering. At the end of the meal we were asked if we wanted tea or coffee - I ordered an americano and the other 2 diners ordered ""the same"". When our ' wine bill' arrived there was an additional ‚Ç¨9 charged -  when I queried the charge I was informed that an americano was a speciality coffee which cost ‚Ç¨3 each!!! This was not explained when we ordered our coffees by a much used other name!

Breakfast was terrible! They have taken the self-service buffet idea to the extreme - by the time I had fished out food from the hot buffet 'trough' for my mother and then myself I then had to to trek all the way back ... past waiting staff with empty hands to cook our toast! The least we could expect to be served. The hotel breakfast buffet concept has been overdone... whatever happened to just serving the paying guests their breakfast!

It seems this hotel gets lots of weddings and families and feel they can get away with such overcharging and short cutting for the masses!

I could add more about the mistaken overcharging for one room , but to sum up - we will definitely NOT be staying there again!",1,2012,08,17
223,"Lovely hotel, great location but bar should bE child free at 11pm!","Just stayed here for 2 nites chill out on a fri and sat night. 
Food was top notch (apart from average breakfast) hotel was clean and modern, the 1hr and half spa treatment was great and the hotel is in a great location to go for a jog...

Only fAult - kids running around after 11 pm on a sat night in the bar, any adults beside us where equally as unimpressed as us, not what you want when you pay to get away from it all ",4,2012,08,13
223,Very Clean and Some Nice Touches,"Very nice hotel and it had some very nice touches, the art work and decor was lovely, staff very friendly. There was sun screen and sun glasses provided to sit out on the patio area. The rooms were large and we had a great view of the course. There was a problem with the heating, underfloor in the bathroom and we couldn't turn it off and it happened to be two very warm nights we stayed, but unfortunatley there was no air conditioning, we phoned down to reception and they sent up a fan which had little effect, we couldn't open the window as the noise from some fans were deafening.  Food was adequate, best part of menu was cheese plate. They catered very well for children and there were plenty staying. We went to play the golf course and found it in very good condition and staff friendly there too.  Don't order the omellete in the club house, it came out burnt twice!",4,2012,08,12
223,Wonderful night,Great value out of the blue night on our travels around Ireland. Found on Laterooms especially asking for a separate shower. Beautiful setting & spacious room & bathroom. Very clean. Pleasant & efficient staff. Had a lovely dinner & extensive breakfast. Sorry we didn't find this hotel the previous night & sorry we couldn't stay longer.,5,2012,08,10
223,Top Class!,"I'm writing this review from our family room on the final night before we return home tomorrow. I have to say I'm very impressed with this hotel - we normally stay in another hotel in the Dublin area, and said we'd try this hotel for a change as we had heard quite good feedback about it.

The staff are fantastic, front of house at the reception desk very informative, no hassle answering any of our queries, always pleasant. Bar and restaurant staff also very pleasant. Food is fantastic - couldn't fault it... perhaps bordering on the expensive side, but I don't complain when I get decent portions and great quality as we did here always. We too had the inclusive meal on one of our nights which we availed of, and I was interested to see that somebody else here said that they thought it was wrong not to have full a-la-carte options on it... To me that would be moaning for the sake of moaning, as the choices on this inclusive menu were smashing - something for all tastes - there was the option to upgrade (at a price obviously) for the full menu, but we didn't see the point - the menu was super, and the presentation of this 'restricted' menu was every bit as good as I have got in any top restaurant in the country. Well done Chef!

Breakfast has a wide diverse of options - can't see how anybody could say that it was like a school canteen or that it was bad... far from it. Lovely woman on charge - I think her name was Dee but I could be wrong - very helpful for us with a 3 year old and an 11 year old.

The rooms - ok I can see where people say they are a little warm... but its August - and thankfully we finally got a spell of weather... I've had warmer and I""ve had a lot more uncomfortable. The travel bed was super for our 3 year old - but I can see peoples points about being tight for 2 kids - but I suppose thats where adjoining rooms come in. Housekeeping very attentive to detail. 

As regards the location - well the clue is in the title of the Hotel - Country Club... personally speaking after braving the driving and parking obstacle course that is Dublin city it makes a change to pull into a large (free!) carpark with loads of room beside the Hotel - no multi-storey rubbish here. Yes its out in the country, but we got to Dublin Zoo in 15 minutes from here. We got to Tayto Park in Ashbourne in 30 minutes, and got from the city centre to here in 25 minutes. Now - you try telling me with city centre Dublin Traffic you'd get around much faster? Also as regards finding this place, yes its tricky, but I found set your sat-nav to 'Castleknock' Village and follow the signs - they are plentiful. My iPhone GPS brought us straight here no problems. 

If I was to make a suggestion, I would suggest the playground is a little small for the amount of children who stay here - but hey, at least they have a playground! 

Otherwise I can't enthuse enough about this place, and I'm not afraid to be critical as you can see from some of my other reviews. Thumbs up from Myself, my Wife and my 2 kids - we will be back, and we can't recommend highly enough this Hotel.",5,2012,08,08
223,Fantastic,"Attended a wedding, staying two nights and had a fabulous time. Wedding appeared well catered for. Friendly hotel with good atmosphere.  Tasty Irish breakfast and good bar food.  7 euros for a glass of wine, however this is to be expected in Dublin.  Great leisure facilities.  only negatives I could find were the temperature of the room and quite slow bar service, however 300 wedding guests were in attendance, which may have held things up a little.  Overall had a great experience and would definetly go back.",4,2012,08,07
223,First Class,"Enjoyed a first class one night stay at this hotel.  Very friendly reception staff, lovely room, fantastic food ! Lobby, bar, restaurant all spotlessly clean. Staff very friendly - couldn't do enough for you, everyone of them with smiles and greetings. Aidan in the bar let us know about an offer in the restaurant - 4 course dinner with a bottle of wine for ‚Ç¨59.00, the food was fantastic, the presentation and service was definately first class. The large lobby was very relaxing with different lighting throughout the afternoon and evening.  The leisure centre was very clean and not too crowded - enjoyed the pool, steam room & sauna, will try the jacuzzi on our next visit ! Treated ourselves to a massage on the morning of our checkout and we were not disappointed. Would definately recommend this hotels to friends and will definately visit again......soon !",5,2012,08,05
223,Good location for Dublin Zoo but that's all,"Stayed here at Easter on the Dublin Zoo offer. Good in terms of location for the zoo. It's a modern hotel with good leisure facilties - that's pretty much the positives out of the way. We had booked a family room which was supposed to accommodate 2 adults and 2 children. The fold out bed provided for the 2 children was ridiculous. Uncomfortable, too small and due to the resulting lack of sleep had a really bad effect on our holiday. The staff in the hotel were not helpful and their approach generally lacked courtesy. Breakfast also of a poor standard - quality of food and standard of service well below par. Would not return and would not recommend. Interestingly when checking out we were not asked if everything was ok with our stay - perhaps they already knew the answer???",2,2012,08,04
223,Hotel is gorgeous! Can't wait to go back!!,"I am just back from Castleknock with my boyfriend, we went on Mon 30th July - Thurs 2nd August. We loved our time there, didnt wanna leave.

First Impressions - The outside and downstairs looks amazing and very fancy but the layout was a bit all over the place. The reception was round the corner from the front doors, the layout looked like it would be very good for a wedding party that are waiting to get into the room for the recpetion. 

Hotel Room - Our room was gorgeous, not many hotel rooms have a bath and shower cubical in the bathroom, which was brillant cause he then had the choice of what we prefered. We had a smoking room which was great as it ment we didnt have to keep going down throught the reception and bar to the smoking area. We also got an iron and ironing board which we have asked for in other hotels and they never had any available, it seems that they have these in every room which is great. Our safe wasnt working, so we just carried out money around, it would of been nice to have the safe working but it wasnt essential. 

Tonic Spa - The spa was gorgeous,  we had massages and they where amazing, the best we have ever had. My boyfriend used the gym and said it was the best hotel gym he has used, he goes to a gym alot at home and he usually complains that the hotel gyms arent great and they have rubbish weights but he said this one was pretty decent. We used the swimming pool, sauna, steam room and jacuzzi aswell and it was great, very clean and relaxing!

Restaurants - We didnt eat much in the hotel, as it was very expensive and not a big selection. We had breakfast 2 mornings and the food was lovely, we had lunch and dinner one day, the food i must say was lovely. We both got steak from the restaurant, my boyfriend asked for blue cheese melted on his steak, when he got the steak it was just 2 cold lumps of cheese placed on the steak, not melted and this meant that his steak went cold very quickly. Apart from that the steaks where cooked perfectly and tasted amazing, i also had the sticky toffee pudding and i must say it was the nicest ive ever tasted!

The Staff - Staff where very helpful and friendly in all parts of the hotel, and anything we asked for was no problem at all to them, they were always willing to help, the receptionist when we checked in even asked if we needed help with our bags, we only had a few and could manage but it was nice to have this offered incase it was going to be a struggle for us, esp if you had small children or an eldery coulpe this would of been very helpful. 

Hotel security - I liked the fact that the hotel has security, for example only residents with a room card and use the lifts and only staff and residents can access the hotel room corridors. There is also a barrier in and out of the car park and you need and exit code to exit the car park, which can be obtained from the recpetion and spa reception.
 
Overall we had an amazing time and didnt want to leave, we can't wait to get booked to come back again",5,2012,08,04
223,"Brilliant Value, Fantastic Staff, well worth a trip!","These lovely people couldn't do enough for us! excellent value for money though food a little too pricey! remember to bring swim hats or pay 3 euro each! Glass of rose wine 7.70 euro, food excellent though and the kids enjoyed it very much. close to zoo ans blanchardstown shopping centre. would definately go back never had such good value in a hotel, don't be dubious about the cost it is brilliant! we saw our deal on late rooms.com but the hotel matched the price.",5,2012,08,03
223,Very enjoyable stay,Spent one night here.  Had evening meal which was delicious.  Staff were very helpful and friendly.  Will definitely return.  Rooms were a good size clean and comfortable. I would have no problem recommending this hotel,5,2012,08,01
223,Definitely worth a visit,First impression of a gorgeous hotel carried right through- extremely child friendly- swimming pool was lovely with two child areas - staff couldn't have been nicer and food was well priced and very tasty. Well worth a visit if you want to be in the Dublin area but not in the city,5,2012,08,01
223,Will not be back,"Basic room - clean and comfortable though. My gripe with this hotel is that there is no airconditioning. Our room was stuffy and I did not sleep very well. When the receptionist asked did we enjoy our stay we said not really as there was no airconditioning which made for an uncomfortable nights sleep. 
She replied by saying airconditioning was not common in Irish hotels. What?! That is not correct -first time I have stayed in a hotel with no air con and it was horrible. We came with a group of 8 friends who also said the same thing - the bedroom at night is like a sauna. It is for that reason only - I would never stay there again. 
Best part of the stay- the breakfast- it really was excellent.",2,2012,07,28
223,Nice Stay,"We booked this hotel for our first night in dublin, after searching it about 1 hour we finally found this hotel. When we arrived the check in was fast and we had very quickly the key to our room. The room was very big, nice and clean and we can recommend this hotel to everyone.",4,2012,07,23
223,Great place!,"Just back from 3 night stay in Castleknock. We booked the family package along with free pass to Dublin Zoo. All in all the hotel was excellent, staff excellent, food excellent and we will def be back again. I do have a few little pointers that I would maybe recommend...1.Change all chairs at breakfast to the red chairs given for children. 2. Extend opening of pool to abut 7.00 to allow extra time for kids and lastly our room overlooked golf course (great) but unfortunately there was a large noisey fan sounding machine which went off during the night and stayed on for a long time. But please don't let hat put of a superb hotel and staff.",4,2012,07,21
223,Lovely Hotel,"Just back from a few days in the Castleknock Hotel and would recommend the hotel. Staff at reception were very helpful with bus times and directions for driving to different places.Had a lovely meal in the Brasserie restaurant one night during the stay, the food and wine was excellent, breakfasts each morning were also quite good although a bit more room between the tables would have been nice so you didn't hear the converation of the people next to you and vice versa. Hotel is a little bit away from main town and fine if you are happy to drive in and out or stay in the hotel for drinks at night or be prepared to get a taxi! Room was very clean and modern.  Would recommend this hotel.",4,2012,07,20
223,"Pleasant, Average hotel","We stayed at the Castleknock Hotel midweek with two children. The reception staff were very nice and helpful. The room was very clean and comfortable barring the heat..we had the windows open at all times but it was still very warm. The couch bed for the children was very uncomfortable, its a pity there's not a room available with two double beds, I had enquired about adjoining room but this was 100E more expensive and not ideal with two small children. The food in the restaurant was very good. The staff were friendly in the restaurant, it was busy and sometimes hard to get attention. The morning buffet had a good variety but the cooked breakfast was a big let down, none of it was nice and we did not try it again. Thankfully there was a nice selection of cereals fruit etc. The spreads/jams etc could have done with something to put them in to bring to your table. The plastic seats at breakfast table were also not very suitable. On the second night we ate in the lobby a mixture of restaurant and bistro food..though the whole hotel nearly had to be consulted to agree if it was acceptable to eat restaurant food in the lobby. The food was average on this night and the potato gratin was very dry and tasteless not to be recommended. The lobby staff were nice and pleasant. The biggest let down of all was the leisure centre closed at 6 to children. As we had gone on a family package and been assured of a family friendly hotel this was a big let down as we intended spending days out and about and using the leisure centre in the evening. My partner brought the children down for a quick dip on the second evening at 5.35pm he was gruffly greeted by staff at the leisure centre and told that they were to be out by 6 and pointed to a clock that read 5.48? considering they had a drink and returned to the room at 5.45pm this was amazing time travel. All in all its a nice hotel but I would not be recommending it for families. Although attempting to capture the family market with a small playground out the front this only entertains children for a few minutes. Also the bus journey I was led to believe was 20mins to town. Our shortest trip on the bus was 35 mins and the longest 50mins...not good for bored kids, bus stop was 5 min walk up a laneway, ok in summer but wouldn't like to be walking it after dark. Taxis varied from 15‚Ç¨ - 20‚Ç¨ a one way trip. I would in future be paying the extra to stay in town as the bus and taxis cost will work out similar. In addition there is nothing around this hotel it is built away from anything...no shops or pubs or restaurant to be seen in walking distance...quiet like a country break.",3,2012,07,19
223,Snooty staff that did everything but make my wife and I fell welcome.,"My wife and I travelled to Ireland for our honeymoon. I booked a seven night stay at Castleknock based on reviews and pricing. 
This was a mistake. The housekeeping staff was courteous and nice, but the front desk was very hit and miss. We spent a lot of time in the beautiful countryside and touring castles so we were in jeans and hoodies, and evidently this made us lesser guests. On multiple occasions we received looks of disgust. 
Our second to last night at the hotel I went out to the rental car to get my camera to charge it, and on my way out I walked by the front desk staff, who were just outside the door I said hello, and they just went back to their conversation without acknowledging me. I went back outside a few minutes later to make sure I Locked the car. As I'm walking in between the stairway and the glass doors, I hear one say to the other ""that guy is back again."" So I get in range of the car, lock it, and get my room key out. When I return to the lobby, one of the two guys starts walking right at me with the intent of intercepting me until he sees I have a key in my hand then immediately diverts his course like he was going to the bar/lounge area. 
In all of Ireland these were by far the least friendly people we encountered, and sadly, they are being paid to be hospitable. ",2,2012,07,19
223,lovely weekend had,Hi just back from another visit to this hotel again it surpassed all you would want or need from a hotel didn't dine this time only had breakfast which i have to say was the best i ever had in any hotel the quailty of the food and the staff who i must say an nothing short of excellent the entertainment of sunday evening was also excellent in a very relax atmosphere so well done castleknock will definately be back,5,2012,07,16
223,excellent staff,on dublin outskirts transport required.modern hotel with excellent facilities including golf and pool.rooms large andcomfortable the excellent and helpful staff are a major plus.,4,2012,07,16
223,Great hotel,"Stayed here for 1 night, booked last minute & whilst we didn't get a great deal compared to some of the deals I seen due to last minute & our need for interconnecting rooms we really enjoyed it - have 2 young kids 2 & 9 months & staff were really accommodating.  Pool great, foyer was ideal for families spacious & trendy only downside was the price of the food - we had bar snacks which we ate at reception/foyer & it was extremely overpriced, will prob return some time in future",4,2012,07,14
223,Very Basic,"The common areas of the hotel are OK but the rooms are very basic.  Hard beds and rock hard pillows.
We asked for a non smoking room and we got a room that smelled very smoky.  It seems to cater to large groups, weddings and such.  Would not stay here again.  
We paid over 200 Euros a night for a room that in my opinion is maybe worth 80.  Very poor value.
Hard to find location.",2,2012,07,13
223,"Comfort, relax, family friendly","I have to say as an all round hotel, it seemed to cater for all walks of life & ages.
We went with 4 kids 3-11yrs & searched Dublin for connecting rooms. This was one of only a
small handful of venues that could offer enough beds/rooms at a competitive price.
I was a bit dubious about staying at a hotel run by an insurance company (FBD) but I have to say that i would have no hesitation staying there again and/or recommending to friends.
Grounds are well kept & groomed. Reception welcome was warm. Directions about the bar & facilities clear. Access to bedrooms via the lift which only works with your room key...which obviously stops any potential messers/non residents from getting to bedrooms...excellent idea.
Bedrooms well appointed & clean with all mod cons. We ate in the restaurant on the first evening which was quiet but lovely. Good hot food...just one point chef, don't season the kids chips...served by pleasent staff. Breakfast was great with a huge variety besides the regular hot buffet. The kids loved the smoothies & chocolate spread. We went to Tayto park for the day which suited our kids ages, especially as the day was sunny, it struck me as a venue for younger kids - primary school level. Again we ate at the hotel, outside on the patio, me & mrs tucked into bottle wine waiting on the food while kids played on the enclosed swings & slides, not a huge playground but sufficient. We used the pool before departure on day 3 which was clean & warm. So I have to say all in all a fantastic experience, maybe just because the sun shone all the time we were there or maybe just because the staff & management know how to put their best foot forward at all times. No, I don't work for the hotel I just had a great experience. Well done you lot !",5,2012,07,09
223,will return,myself and my girlfriend stayed here for a concert in the phoenix park...great location for it and for the shopping in blancherstown. staff very friendly and helpful. booked a few treatments in the spa which was lovely and reasonably priced. we wanted an early slot for our treatments but it was all booked up but when a cancellation came they(the staff) immediately rang our room and offered us the earlier slot. our room was very clean and spacious but it was a bit too warm even though a fan was provided. we will definitely be returning and next time with our baby as it seems so family friendly,4,2012,07,08
223,Nice Country location -need  a car,"Set in a green belt on a Golf course and next door to another.This modern hotel is close to  Dublin city centre, but a car is desirable.Public transport is also available.
Very good lobby and bar terrace.Free wi-fi.
Bathroom had separate shower cubicle as well as bath. Short on the usual 4 star items. no bathrobes or slippers -a pain when using the pool.Short on toiletries.No minibar . No botteled water.No newspapers.Breakfast good and staff excellent.Free car parking.Green fee 30 euro.
Hotel was full on my stay and I was unable to get Spa appointment.If staying book spa and golf well in advance.
Very well suited to children, playground outside.",3,2012,07,08
223,Fantastic value for money,"We have just returned from a 3night stay at Castleknock Hotel and Country Club and was more than pleased. The location was ideal for us, about a 20minute drive from Dublin City centre, it had great links to the motorway but was far enough way so there wasnt any traffic/city noises. The room was very big, we had our 6month old baby with us and the hotel provided us with a very clean travel cot. The bathroom had a bath with a separate shower cubicle which were both spotless. The reception is bright and welcoming and was never very busy. Breakfast is self service which was great and the food was always hot. We ate in the hotel restaurant the evening we arrived and food was beautiful and very reasonable for a hotel (especially in Dublin). We used the pool and again it was very clean and staff were very helpful and friendly, you do need to wear a swim hat if you use the pool but if you don't have one they charge 3euro, however I wasn't charged. We used the Internet to book and stayed for 47.50euro per night which was exceptional value for money. Will definitely stay here again and recommend to all.",5,2012,07,07
223,Family Break,"Stayed for a weekend on 30th June last with wife and 5yr old.  Check in was fast, friendly and efficient.  Room was very clean, bed extremely comfortable, plenty of pillows, towels, tea / coffee etc.  Bar food had plenty of choice, portion size good and quality of food great - (spcial mention to Darragh - thank you for the colour book & pencils ..... the little things mean alot).  Breakfast and Dinner were also of high quality with lots of choice.  Leisure Centre had freindly staff, a great pool, sauna & steam room, all grand and clean.  Hotel in a great location close to Blanchardstown Centre and Phoenix Park & Dublin Zoo.  All in all a fab stay - hope to be back again later in the year again.",5,2012,07,06
223,Great for a hens weekend,"Great packages available, staff nice and friendly at times forgetful. Leisure centre could be cleaner in pool area. Spa lovely shame relaxation area is so small. Dinner in restaurant amazing. Entertainment in bar great, warm atmosphere. Breakfast great selection ",4,2012,07,03
223,Regular business trips,"I stay here frequently for work reasons and I am always really happy with my experience. The staff are friendly, courteous and helpful. The hotel is bright and clean and located in a beautiful setting. This hotel is always busy and for good reason.",5,2012,07,02
223,Very Disappointing,"This is a hotel of contrasting qualities and it needs to be viewed in that context. The building itself is great: my room was excellent, was of an above average standard, and cleaned meticulously. The spa facilities are first rate, and the gym not much behind (though a little small).The bar area is very pleasant; there is a huge pleasantly furnished seating are in the foyer; and the main restaurant area has some nice views. 
However, the staff are a Jekyll and Hyde mixture and if you get a good one it's great, but it's pot luck, and the bad ones are dire.
Whilst the range of food available for breakfast was extensive, all the hot items had a 'boil-in-the-bag' taste and texture which for me made them in-edible: this was a recurring theme with the bar food, which, to make matters worse was quite expensive. I gave it a shot by eating there a couple of  nights, but it really was awful: I've never eaten steamed BBQ chicken before, and I hope to never have to again! The difficulty with this hotel is that it is a little isolated, you can't just say hay-ho, and walk to the local pub, because the nearest one is 10mins drive away.

It's a shame, it's a great place, but I was completely put off, and whilst I have to visit Dublin and surrounds reasonably often, there is no chance of my returning here.",2,2012,06,30
223,Great potential but fails to deliver,"My wife and I are just back from a 3 night stay at this hotel.  It is an attractive modern building in a semi-rural location but within easy reach of central Dublin.    There is secure free parking with lots of space and a well manicured garden.   There is a spacious and large lounge/bar area on the ground floor with comfortable seating.
We had a well-furnished bedroom on the second floor with a splendid view over the golf course.
The room became exceptionally hot and we were very surprised to find that there was no air-conditioning.   Opening the windows produced a loud and irritating noise from the ventilators on the roof of part of the ground floor making it really difficult to get to sleep.   We followed the guidance in the guests' brochure in order to obtain ice from the machines alleged to be situated outside rooms 228 and 128, but this was pure fiction -there were no ice machines anywhere and no fridge or minibar in the bedroom.   Zero out of 10 for this!
We enjoyed the breakfast buffet which offered a wide range of hot and cold food, and service in this area was friendly and efficient.   We had two evening meals in the bar area.   Service here was slow and perfunctory and no-one appeared to be responsible for managing it.   When the food eventually arrived we considered it to be significantly overpriced in relation to the quality.  
Overall, we enjoyed our trip to Dublin, but we don't think bedrooms without air conditioning merit 4 stars.",3,2012,06,29
223,Very good hotel for conference,"The hotel staff is very polite and helpful. The wifi was free and fast enough for business. Breakfast was great and service was good. Prices showed a very god value for money I thought. Overall recommended. Room was nicely presented, clean and spacious. On the downside thre was a mistake with my order that was fixed though and I had to call in maintenance twice. Again though things were fixed.",3,2012,06,28
223,Nice staff but breakfast poor for vegetarians!,Stayed last weekend with my family. On the Friday we went to the bar for a drink but every seat had a reserved sign on it for guests at a wedding. We ended up having to go back up to our room to order room service. I didn't come to the hotel to sit in my room so was a bit disappointed. Breakfast was quite expensive considering the choice available. I am a vegetarian and when I asked what option was available to me I was told I could have an omelette - at an extra charge! As I already had to pay for a full cooked breakfast despite not being able to eat any of the meat products I felt this was ridiculous. Hotel was lovely and clean but our stay was let down by these incidents. ,4,2012,06,26
223,"Nightmare of a stay, the staff are just going through the motions","The worst food I have every had in a hotel, noisy room due to wedding traffic all night in the halls. Couldn't get to my room on a number of occasions due to a hall door being broken. The staff are robotic in their responding to complaints. A very depressing experience. ",1,2012,06,23
223,Nice Hotel and good stay,Stayed here for 1 night on business and was very happy with the whole place. Rooms were spacious and clean with free wi fi. Breakfst was plentiful with a good selection of hot and cold food and not too busy despite the dinign area only looking small. Overall I would recommend to any business travellers for a conference / meeting or couples wanting a relaxing break away.,5,2012,06,21
223,Very nice hotel,"This is a fine spacious very modern hotel in a nice setting close to the city but feels like you are in the countryside and with views of the golf course.
The leisure centre is very nice and our kids loved the pool as the water was nice and warm.
There is an outdoor play area which they enjoyed also even if it is a bit small. It allows adults to sit outside and have a drink or some food while still able to keep a watchful eye on the children.
We had food in the lounge area and found it to be expensive and portions small.
No complaints about breakfast though, good quality and wide selection.
No problems with any of the staff, all were professional and courteous.
The only real complaint was that the family room we had for 2 adults + 2 small kids consisted of a double bed and a fold out bed. The fold out bed was small so our kids slept with their mother in the double bed and I slept in the fold out bed which was not comfortable. We all did get a good night's sleep though.",4,2012,06,19
223,"Comfortable, friendly, beautiful setting","We based ourselves at the hotel for a weekend because of its accessibility to that side of the city.
From the moment we checked in we had a positive experience.  Every member of staff we met was hospitable and helpful.  Our room was comfortable and the breakfast was very good.
There is a lovely big lobby with plenty of seating, and an attractive deck outside the bar - although the weather meant it was deserted while we were there!  It also  has a big car park.
We did not have time to use the leisure centre, but we would love to go back to Castleknock Hotel & Country Club so that we can enjoy all the facilities.",5,2012,06,18
223,A great hotel but choose your room!,"This was a fan hotel with excellent staff and great facilities. The only down side was the room we were put in although spacious comfortable and clean was very very hot, and when we opened the window all we could hear was the drone of the fans from the restaurant that our room overlooked. The view of the golf course was lovely but the noise was really bad. About 20 euro by taxi to temple bar but we knew that and we're happy to be out of town. ",4,2012,06,17
223,Health and day spa .. I don't think so !,"I wasn't a guest in the hotel, however i did decide to book an appointment in the spa.. I left there after spending 50euro feeling the same as when I went in .. The next day I woke up in agony. My neck + shoulders have been paining me ever since. I now have to take a day off work to go see a doctor because no matter what I do the pain does not seem to ease .. Staff were friendly enough but that's not why I booked in nor intended to pay for ! Won't be using those facilities again !",2,2012,06,17
223,Very nice place,I must say i was pleasantly surprised. A lovely setting and a lovely hotel all at a great price,5,2012,06,14
223,Staff absolutely amazing,"I recently stayed in this hotel for a conference and I must say I've never been more impressed by how friendly and helpful all they staff was during my stay , I've been to countless hotels but the Castleknock was perfect I couldn't fault on anything , I want to say that there was a particular young man ( Gavin ) who was excellent he was so helpful , friendly nothing was too much hassle ,I will be recommending this hotel for sure .",4,2012,06,07
223,"Not child friendly, not 4 star",Booked a room with a cot so got put on the furthest room from reception and lifts...had a small baby So very awkward waking 15 mins to room. Room freezing heat on one timer for whole hotel ridiculous...heat came on at approx 9...had to send down for heater. Breakfast very poor again because we had baby pushed into the far room away from the food. Receptionist was very little help. Asked for robes we could come back to room to shower after pool had to ring down 3 times and wait a couple of hours. Certainly not a four star. No mini fridge in room either. Mix up with bill on leaving...faulty  towers,2,2012,05,31
223,Wedding Package needs work!,"I attended a Civil Wedding Ceremony here recently with my wife and we booked into the hotel for the night also.  I can't fault the hotel for cleanliness and helpfulness behind the bar and the food was very nice, but as a wedding venue overall it left a good bit to be desired.  Having had our own wedding as a Civil Ceremony in a hotel, I was in a good position to compare.

The ceremony start-time was 3.30pm but when my wife and I went up to the ceremony room at 3.25 there wasn't a sinner in the place!  The groom arrived in a minute later wondering where everybody was!!!  Where was the wedding co-ordinator?  Everybody surely should've been directed to the ceremony room by 3.15 and be in place, it was left to the groom to ring the best man and ask where everyone was.  My wife went downstairs to help get guests up but the bar staff were already serving the tea and champagne BEFORE the ceremony!  So there was little if any communication between bar staff and wedding staff (if there was in fact someone designated to direct wedding guests), it was all very haphazard at the start.  That said, the ceremony was very nice, the room was spacious and nicely air-conditioned given the glorious weather outside, of which we enjoyed after the ceremony. 

The wedding meal itself was lovely and my wife well catered for regarding her coeliac diet, so big marks for that as was the coeliac option at brunch the next day.  The bedroom was very comfortable, immaculate, spotless and clean and the shower water perfect, so again no complaints on that score.

I'm not a massive fan of big marble glassy open plan bars, there's little warmth or character here but that's just me, as I said, staff couldn't be more attentive and polite and helpful.  If they want to hold civil wedding ceremonies however, there's huge room for improvement.",3,2012,05,31
223,Great hotel and a fantastic mid week deal.,"This is a great hotel - not far from the city centre if you are prepared to drive to it - 15 / 20 mins. There is something quite nice about coming out of the busy city and being able to come back to this hotel for 100% relaxation.  It is a very nicely decorated hotel - very attractive surroundings.  If you are a golfer this is definitely a hotel for you - if you enjoy jacuzzi time and pool etc - this is also the place for you.  There are really excellent facilities here - well managed and clean.  There is a gym which is really nice, lovely pools, Jacuzzi, sauna and steam room.  The bedroom was spacious, clean and from what I could gather most rooms look on to a part of the golf course, which is very attractive.  The restaurant was packed most nights with a deal on for ¬£50 3 courses and a bottle of wine for 2 - thought that looked great and as it was so busy that was also a good sign, we did not eat in the hotel as we had other plans - but as we are planning to return we will try the restaurant next time. There is a lovely golf club a short walk away on the complex and you can walk in and eat there too - we were recommended we try that - so worth investigating.  We checked out Sat - on Fri night there was light entertainment and the bar was also full - mixture of locals and residents - it was a super atmosphere.  The hotel is also very close to Blanchardstown Shopping Complex which is worth a visit with free parking etc and you could spend a day there it is fantastic for the die hard shoppers!  
Great value, service and location - we will return.",5,2012,05,28
223,Great hotel !,"Great hotel rooms were fab , bar lacked atmosphere but apart from that great . We had bar food which was delicious staff friendly :-) ",5,2012,05,28
223,Good for the deal that we got,"Stayed here with my 3 sisters last Sunday night - 20th May.  Nice hotel, lovely beauty and treatment area.  Myself and my sisters went away for the night to celebrate our birthdays.  We got a deal on pigsback.com for 80 euro each 1 night B & B and evening meal and treatments but as we only had two rooms the treatments were only 1 per room.  We had to pay extra for the other two treatments but there was a 20% discount for residents so it was only another 15 euro each.  Treatments were lovely, dinner was lovely, Bar was a little rowdy so we stayed in the foyer where there was another bar and cocktail area.  Cocktails would kill a small horse! but would want to at ‚Ç¨11.50 each!
Rooms were lovely, not too big or small and we had super king size beds instead of twin but they were so comfortable and large that you wouldn't even know you were sharing it with someone.  The shower wasn't very hot but I mentioned it to reception.  It took about 10 mins for it to get warm.  

It's nice that the hotel was on two floors so there wasn't lots of going up and down for ages in lifts.  Staff were nice, accommodating without being in your face.  ‚Ç¨6.00 per room to get room service which we did.
All in all couldn't complain only small fly in the ointment was the crowd in the bar but I think there was a christning or communion or something on.

I marked down to very good because of the water and the drunks in the bar. But all in all a good experience.  Don't know if I would pay the recommended rate of 300 euro per night for it though.",4,2012,05,25
223,Lovely for pampering,"Stayed here for a night away with the girls. We booked spa packages which turned out to be very reasonable and good professional staff at the spa. The pool is lovely and there is a decent enough playground if you had kids. Bed and room very comfortable and clean, and i liked the extras such as dvd player and ipod docking station. Food in the restaurant was lovely. 
My only negative  were the waiting staff in the restaurant, they were poor to say the least, very slow, we had to keep asking for drinks, our dessert, the bill..... they were very inefficient. I like the location of this hotel, 15 mins from dublin city centre, so you feel like you are in the countryside without making the longer journey.",4,2012,05,23
223,Our stay in the Castleknock Hotel and Country Club,"When my girlfriend and I arrived at the hotel to check in we were greeted by a very helpful and cheerful member of staff! We were checked in and up in our room within minutes! There was no waiting or delays! 

The room itself was beautiful and very elligant! Also very clean and tidy! The beds were a good size and extremely comfortable! The bathroom, again like the bedroom was beautiful, clean and tidy, with a separate shower and bath. There is also plenty of wardrobe and shelving space.

We dinned in the Park Restaurant! This personally was my favourite part of our stay. The restaurant is magnificent. The staff are very very friendly and helpful. The food is truely beautiful food. I would recommend the T-bone steak. The service was very good, our courses arrived on time, we didn't feel rushed or were never left waiting to long. It was a very relaxing and enjoyable dinner. 

The breakfast, like the dinner was very enjoyable and relaxing. There was a good variety of foods such as Irish breakfast, cereals, fresh fruits,pastries and plenty of juices! 

Check out was before 12pm and there was no problems checking out, again everything was taken care of by a helpful member of staffed thin minutes. They accept laser or debit card! 

All in all we both had an amazing stay at the hotel and would recommend it to any of our friends and family. We definitely would stay again in the future and found that also we families with children the hotel is very child friendly as there was many families with young children in restaurant aswell as the hotel itself! ",5,2012,05,09
223,"Attractive, comfortable, convenient, favorite stay","I have stayed twice at the Castleknock Hotel & Country Club, and both times had a positive experience.  The front desk staff were polite and very helpful with requests and special needs for our room & contacting a local business, the room was very clean, bathroom and towels perfect (I am not sure if bathroom floor tiles were heated, but they were warm and very welcome during a winter stay!), the room temperature was just fine, beds & pillows comfortable, and the room was quiet.  No hallway noise & no noise from neighbors or outdoors.  Parking was convenient and near the lobby, and the lobby was attractive/fancy & comfortable.  We ate twice here, both times the food was very good.  We stayed in two other Dublin hotels in the past, and Castleknock was so much better for us (more relaxing, more space in room, staff nicer, cleaner, etc).  Everyone we met here was warm & welcoming.  We really loved it.  On one stay we drove into city centre, the other stay we took a cab into the city centre and estimated we spent less while staying here than if we had stayed in city centre and paid to keep our car there.  The hotel is a short drive from Phoenix Park and it was easy to head west on the motorway from here when we were ready to leave Dublin.  We hope to stay here again and we will recommend to family & friends, thank you!!",5,2012,05,06
223,World Wise Travellers,"Been and stayed in every kind of accomodation in more than 50 countries.
Very impressed on arrival at Castleknock. Big modern hotel, security barriers, massive free car park, golf course, large light airy reception area, very helpfull desk staff, large clean bedroom, lovely bathroom, lovely dining room with happy hour menu, also a very low priced wine and dine menu (59euro for two people), great breakfast. All the staff were well trained, happy, with nothing too much trouble. We stayed for one night then, after driving around Ireland, returning  for what should have been a three night stay, unfortunately we had to leave after two nights, (we had booked 3 nights on a no cancellation rate) but due to the excellent staff intervention, we were not charged for the third night, brilliant experience !!! We're going back to Ireland just to stay in this hotel !!!",5,2012,04,29
223,Nice hotel but some things need to be improved,"Myself and my boyfriend went here to enjoy their spa facilities and we weren't disappointed. The spa treatment was brilliant however is a tad over priced. A tip would be to book the spa treatments before you arrive as we found it difficult to get a booking in the spa during our visit, a point never mentioned by the receptionist through booking. another point to mention is that my boyfriend thought it would be nice to get rose petals on the bed and a bottle of wine in the room on arrive as it was my birthday, however the ""rose petals"" were fabric which was not clarified on the website and the bottle of wine was not in the room on arrival. We also went for a meal in the hotel as it was included in our package. We went at 7.30 and were awkwardly the only people there, the staff were slow to approach us and they were talking in a huddle near our table as we sat without menus. The rooms are gorgeous however and the beds are very comfortable. they have modern flat screens which meant we could download a movie onto a USB and watch it there, the bar is lovely also. Overall not a bad experience but improvement on detail can be made in this hotel.",3,2012,04,27
223,wedding day,i was recently at a wedding here and it went great the food was beautiful and the the hotel rooms are cosey and warm there is a great atmosphere in this hotel and the staff were amazing.,5,2012,04,23
223,Luxurious and professional hotel,"I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights as part of a training course and was left with a very positive impression overall

The staff were friendly and courteous, especially the reception staff on arrival.

The rooms were spacious and comfortable, and kept to a high standard

The food was excellent and there was a great choice at breakfast

The gym, however was a little cramped and the equipment was quite old as far as I could see, but still ran well

It was ideal for me but I can imagine for someone visiting the city it may be a bit too far out. I believe it would cost around ‚Ç¨20 each way in a taxi, however I understand there is a bus route nearby ",5,2012,04,23
223,faboulous,"I have just spent a very pleasent night with my wife in this hotel.
The room we had on the 2nd floor was huge,overlookink the car park, it was excellent.
I would definitly recommend this hotel.",5,2012,04,20
223,Very good,Stayed recently at this hotel with my partner. Cannot praise the staff highly enough especially the receptionists. Very nice room with bathroom with separate bath & shower. Had a meal in the Park restaurant which was excellent. Breakfast was also good. The leisure centre was also very nice & the golf course looks to be very well kept.,5,2012,04,20
223,Hard to fault,"I've stayed in this hotel countless times with friends, family and my partner. It is pretty hard to fault it. The food is fantastic. Rooms and decor are beautiful. Staff are attentive and spa facilities are excellent. One of my favourite hotels.",5,2012,04,19
223,sun to tues break,"I booked this hotel very last minute (the night before) on booking.com, very reasonable.We found the hotel easily enough off m50 n3 exit. very impressed, our room was large with super king bed, really really nice. Bathroom was perfect, separate shower and bath. The leisure centre was brilliant, pool, jacuzzi, steam room & sauna. didnt go to the gym but looked pretty good. cons; air con unit outside room 272 a little noisy, hairdryer was useless in room use one in the leisure centre instead :) overall great break... recommend browne's steak house in blanchardstown, gorgeous!!! Will definitely be booking again....",4,2012,04,18
223,Family friendly,"Stayed for one night over the Easter Break and will be back. We had an interconnecting room which was perfect (3 kids <6yo), lots of space, comfy beds. Great leisure facilities and loved the playground which is next to an outdoor seated coffee/bar area. The staff in all areas were very helpful and children are well catered for.",4,2012,04,18
223,Really helpful staff,We booked a 2 night stay in April. Unfortunately my wife broke a bone in her leg the week before but we decided to continue with our break. The staff were ever helpful even providing a lend of a wheelchair throughout free of charge. This really allowed us to get out and do things. Gof course looks pristine although I didn't play this time. Food really nice and nice ambience throughout. We used the spa and found it really good also.  Overall a really relaxing break!,5,2012,04,15
223,Excellent,"Stayed here for one night after getting the ferry from Holyhead to Dublin, en-route to Belfast. Got a great deal on Late Rooms.com. Had a huge room overlooking a tee. Massive comfy bed. Underfloor heating in the bathroom. WIsh we could have stayed longer.  Would definitely go back.",4,2012,04,14
223,Raw Sewage,"What an experience. We had the most horrific time at this hotel. on the morning after our arrival we discovered raw sewage seeping into the shower tray. The food was awful - we all suffered from from a food related illness for some days after our stay, the breakfast was not enjoyable, the service was terrible, the general standard was not good. Waiting an hour for a main course in not acceptable. this hotel should come with a health warning.",1,2012,04,14
223,Fab one night stay,"Enjoyed a one night stay here during the week on Deal or No deal special which was great value.
Lovely welcome by reception and check in was efficient and informative.
Room was very spacious and comfortable - TV & DVD player and all usual room facilities!
We used Tonic Leisure Centre next morning and were greater by very friend and helpful staff - facilities there were great  - very clean! The pool was lovely and wasn't too crowded so we enjoyed a leisurely swim. Didn't use the spa facilities this time but they have great special offers there so will definitely be back to avail of them soon.
Check out again was efficient and very friendly. Overall thoroughly enjoyed our one night away and would recommend the hotel and facilities.",5,2012,04,13
223,"Good experience , but ....",Stayed here on one of their deal or no deal rates so got it for very cheap. It's a lovely hotel child friendly and set in a great location but since we stayed there 2 years ago they have gone security crazy. They have swipe cards on corridors to each floor and code for gate kinda makes u feel like something bad must have happened to be so security conscience especially since its in the middle of no where ,3,2012,04,12
223,right on the green,we stayed at the castleknock hotel in february for one night. overall i must say we were very pleased. the food was excellent and very good value. rooms were comfortable and we had a very good buffet breakfast. the hotel does good dinner b&b packages.,4,2012,04,12
223,Pleasant Stay,"I have just returned from a two night break with family at this hotel. This was our second visit, a lively atmosphere greeted us and even though the bar area was busy we managed to find a table for 4 of us. Bar food was good, not excellent but adequate. Room was very comfortable and any requests we had were looked after straight away. A very relaxing stay, we did not have our own transport this time so we had to rely on taxi service to get to Coolmine railway station about 6 minutes away.  We had to wait 15 minutes for a taxi and we thought it would be helpful if this hotel had a shuttle bus service to the rail station, even at weekends.",4,2012,04,10
223,Poor to Average at Best,"I stayed here for two nights with my family. Three kids (5, 3, 8m) and my wife.
I booked an interconnecting room with baby cot.
We arrived at 2:45 for check in and were told our room was not ready, ok as check in time is three.
The receptionist took my bags and mobile number and said that I would be called when my room was ready. By 3:45 I had not received a call so I returned to reception. I was able to check in but was not offered a reason for not being called.
The rooms were modern and nice, no complaints. Immediately I noticed it was too warm. I opened the windows and turned off the radiators.
We used the leisure centre twice during the visit. Kids loved the pool. Facilities were good.
We all had a bad night sleep the first night because the room was too hot.
I phoned reception the next day to comment on the heat and was told that the duty manager would be consulted and that he would call me. Needless to say I did not receive a call.

We met some friends in the hotel and joined them for dinner in the restaurant. We all had in inclusive dinner package. The dining room was very nice and the dinner was enjoyable too. One thing that really bugged us all was that my friend asked for a scoop of ice cream with her apple crumble instead of the cream and was told that she would be charged ‚Ç¨1.

Staff were helpful even though their grasp of english was not as good as it should have been.

On the second night there were a lot of kids running up and down the corridor after 10:30. I reported this to reception but this continued until 12pm. They told me at check out that they did investigate my complaint, but....

The bar food is not great and is expensive. Breakfast is buffet style with a reasonable choice but generally poor quality. Not many healty options. If you want an omlett there is an additional ‚Ç¨3 table charge.

I reported these complaints during my stay and at checkout. I received a weak apology.
I will not return or recommend this hotel to anyone. It's a shame as generally the staff were quite helpful and the location is very nice.",2,2012,04,10
223,Will not return,Stayed here for 1 night with 3 girl friends.  Evening meal was part  of our package and although we booked table for 7.45 certain items on small menu all gone and to chose something similar from another menu you had to pay extra.  Bar fine but no atmosphere. Room good. Clean with nice bathroom.  Bed very comfortable. Service at breakfast was very bad; we had to wait 10 mins to be seated although plenty of tables free. Staff very unfriendly and we really felt like we were in their way.  At one stage we had a pot of tea literally thrown on the table.  When we complained to manager when checking out. He listened to us then said he had to go off somewhere and then sent in a member of staff which we had complained about to the manager to listen to our issues again!! Eventually after 25 mins we had money taken off bill. Manager never came back out to us and actually hid in the little room behind reception!!! Would def not rcommend this hotel it's a real shame as accommodation was good.,2,2012,04,05
223,Child friendly hotel,"Wonderful hotel, fantastic food, magnificent food and a wonderful setting",5,2012,04,02
223,live in the lap of luxury,"Shared a friend's 65th birthday celebrations with her and we had a wonderful time. The rooms are quiet as the grave, clean and very well appointed. The beds are to die for and the staff were exceptionally helpful, polite and friendly. Dee( on breakfast reception duty) and Ian (our barista )were quite superb but honestly every staff member we encountered were brilliant. Yes there is a lick of paint required here and there but it in no way impeded our enjoyment. If there is a downside it's that the hotel is a 35euro taxi ride from the city but it IS in an oasis of calm tranquility.",5,2012,03,22
223,A lovely hotel,"I have recently had to spend sometime away from my family on two separate business trips. I can honestly say that staying at the Castleknock made the trips alot more pleasurable. The majority of the hotel staff as you would expect were very kind an friendly and always very polite. The 'A-La Carte restuarant was good, I only have one small complaint about the restaurant, I was asked a couple of times if I had a reservation, when I stated that I hadn't the staff seemed a little bit 'Offish'. When entering the restaurant, there were plenty of tables available and on one occasion, I was the only person in. The choice of food was also restricted but well cooked. The Smoked Duck and Pea Risotto (starter) and Winter Berry Creme Brulee were excellent, so much so I ate this every night. The spa facilities which were available to all guests were also very good, please note. If you want to enter the pool you must wear a swimming cap. Would definately return to this hotel when I am back in Ireland.",4,2012,03,20
223,"Very nice hotel, would stay again.","Stayed for a couple of nights, room was very nice with plenty of amenities but walls were very grubby with paintwork marked and scuffed - lick of paint would improve room greatly!! Asked for a quiet room and got just that. Even though there was a wedding and other groups staying our room was an oasis of calm compared to the rest of the hotel!! Breakfast was very good, was down early which made for a peaceful breakfast time with a great selection of hot and cold food and friendly and helpful staff. Had dinner on one evening which was very nice, resteraunt had a relaxed atmosphere. Biggest asset this hotel has is it's friendly, efficient and helpful staff - made our stay a pleasure. 
",4,2012,03,18
223,Great Hotel,"I stayed at this hotel for Paddy's weekend for a wedding. I was impressed with the wedding service that the hotel arranged. The meal was fanstastic and the private room was beautiful. I would recommend a wedding here to anyone.

The rooms where top notch. The beds were great and very comfortable. The bathroom is fabulous.

The Swimming in the hotel was great. The pool was warm and clean. 

The staff were absolutely amazing. They are best staff at any hotel I have stayed in. Keep up the good work.

Only problem was the rooms were freezing. You have to put your key in to power up the radiator so when you leave the room for a few hours the radiator wont come on. This is the only flaw I could find which says alot about the quality of the hotel.",5,2012,03,18
223,Fantastic hotel,"We stayed at this Hotel for our second time last week. We found the hotel to be lovely. The rooms are first rate, the facilities, including the leisure centre are fantastic. The staff are extremely courteous, friendly and professional.

We will definately be making a return visit.",5,2012,03,16
223,happy,had a great weekend at this hotel and to our suprise we were upgraded to a suite. staff were very friendly and helpful. food was very good also service. will be back.,5,2012,03,15
223,FIRST CLASS,"Stayed at this hotel recently for weekend break. Very scenic location outside Castleknock Village.
Our  room was spotlessly clean and had tv, ironing board ,tea/coffee making facilities and full bathroom.
The staff are professional and courteous. Breakfast was first class- the best I have tasted in any hotel in Dublin. I used the pool and spa and both were clean. 
Dublin is about 35 minutes away on local bus which stops about 5 minutes walk away from hotel.
Hope to return soon.
Thank you to the hard working staff.",4,2012,03,12
223,Really Enjoyed our stay,"stayed here with my boyfriend last Sat,
*room was lovely
*70.00 room only deal (we never get breakfast)
*got lunch there and 2 or 3 drinks (was expensive)
*dinner menu didn't really appeal to Us and V. Expensive so we got a Taxi to Castle-knock  Village (‚Ç¨10.00)
*we got a Massage each and were able to get it in the same room, was lovely,
*heated pool, leisure Center is really really nice,
*if you are looking for a nice Hotel that isn't too expensive to relax and chill out and get a nice Massage, then go here it's lovely,
*food is expensive i wouldn't eat here, nice places to eat 5 mins away!",4,2012,03,06
223,Great stay cut short,"Was very impressed with castleknock, beautiful and clean hotel. Staff was very nice and friendly especially the young men working/serving in the bar. As I dont use elevators we asked about using the stairs to get to out 3rd floor 268 room. There's a grand staircase in the lobby and we were told to use that. We got to the top and our room was up another level but could find no more stairs. Had to get the receptionist to show us the unmarked door to the service stairs. Our keys wouldn't work to open the door so she used her master and kindly showed us to our room. She returned shortly with a key that would allow use to use stairs. Room was spacious and clean but worth the ‚Ç¨500 plus we were paying for 2 nights? No. There is an unsightly valve pipe thingy sticking up through the floor that I imagine would be better boxed in. A fussier person might have complained. Tv was kind of a joke either that or 2 30 year old adults are thick and can't work it. Few channel selection but main issue was when using one tv it would turn the other on. Super annoying. Went to the local shop to get some snacks and when we returned seen a car had it's lights left on. We told a French gentleman at reception and he really didn't seem to care. We got the feeling he was half listening go us. Went upstairs and again our key wouldn't open the door to stairs. Went back down to speak to female reception she gave us a key and we told her again about the car. She told us they don't take reg numbers. Now if it was my car and my battery ran flat and the hotel could have tried to prevent that and didnt, I'd be welled annoyed. it was most likely a wedding guest and announcement from the dj wouldn't have hurt. Come morning we got a call that a family emergency had occurred and we need to head back to Belfast. When I explained to reception and I checked out a day early. We had paid for our stay in full when we checked in. I understand cancellation policies and that but it would have been a huge gesture had they refunded me the night not used or a voucher for a night at another time. Just something would have been nice. I am planning to return to Dublin in April with family and an incentive to return would have been nice. All in all was a lovely place and recommend staying.",4,2012,03,05
223,not very impressed....,"booked two rooms on a saturday for two adults and three kids,checked in at 4.15 to be told our rooms were'nt ready..ok we said we would take the kids swimming int the meantime to be told that children were not allowed in the pool after 6..asked how long for the rooms we were told they were being prepared,a little after 5 we got the keys and proceeded to unpack and get swimming gear etc and went to the pool for half an hour!...then went to book a table for dinner that night and were told they could only take us at 6.40?...ok let me check with my wife...5 mins later i returned to book only to be told the table was gone...could now take us at 9.30...too late for the kids..so then at 7.30 went to the bar for snack menu,lots of nice couches etc,but all full,so we decided to order room service,menu very similar to the bar menu so no problem until we were told that two of the three snacks we ordered were unavailable...bummer.the next morning we had breakfast which was nice and enjoyable until an elderly waitress chastised our table because my seven year old daughter was not wearing shoes(sitting down)...it was like one of those fr ted moments when ted kicks the bishop in the bum...i still cant believe it!",2,2012,03,04
223,"Highly recommend, lovely country setting.","Very welcoming friendly staff, lounge area is very nice with fabulous comfy sofas.  
Buffet breakfast has plenty of choice, restaurant experience was great, food was fabulous and reasonably priced and staff were attentive but gave us privacy. 
Rooms are spacoius, clean and have plenty of extras in executive rooms, the air conditioning unit outside was noisy though.
Pool was nice and warm but unfortunatley the jacuzzi was broken during our stay.  
Location is lovely with surrounding golf course, hotel is easy to find from the north, not far from city centre to do a bit of shopping and sight seeing.  
We would definatley stay here again and recommend it for a short break to all our family and friends!!!",4,2012,02,29
223,Four star steal!,"This is my second stay at the Castleknock Hotel Dublin. The first was last May and we returned as my trip to Ireland was extended from a sprained ankle.

The lobby/bar area is nicely decorated and the staff are welcoming.  Sorcha, in particular, did remember our last visit, when we got engaged.  She is a very attentive server in the bar area. She asked how we'd been since our last visit! 

While I don't usually eat the food at the hotel, (I'd rather go out and explore) this hotel is the exception.  For the money, it is an exceptional value.  A lovely toastie sandwich, made to order with chips (crisps) and a green salad for 6 euro.  There is a prix fix dinner in the restaurant for 59 euro for two with a bottle of wine!  

The rooms are clean and the housekeeping staff take care in maintaining a nice room throughout your visit.  The linens and bedding are comfortable.  My fiance works from the hotel room, and it is set up very well for the business traveler. The leisure center is convenient (for gym types), and the property's grounds are stunning. The pool looks really nice, I think I'll try it sometime this week!  I had a massage at the spa on my last visit which was very good.

The Blanchardstown shops are a short distance away, if you don't want to pay the 23 euro cab fare to Dublin.  

All in all, a great value for the price.",4,2012,02,27
223,GOOD HOTEL,"Stayed here 2 nights recently and was very happy with experience.
Our room was well laid out and very comfortable, Breakfast was a buffet with a very good selection to surely suit all tastes.
The inclusive Dinner menu was very limited but what we selected was very nice and service was good. 
The spa offers a wide range of treatments and we each availed of massages. Full body for me and full leg for my wife both were very enjoyable.
The hotel was quite busy with families due to half term break and obviously offered value for money deals.",4,2012,02,20
223,nice relaxing hotel,"stayed as we where attending a wedding near by. hotel lobby really nice on arrival. reception staff pleasant. room nice and quiet with really nice bathroom. we didnt have a nice view but didnt bother us. had a spa treatment which was amazing although the relaxation room beforehand was a little cold which was strange. had a drink in the residents bar and was pretty pricey, charged us eur2 for a pack of peanuts which was annoying as most other hotels have nibbles on the table complimentary! all round nice hotel and would go back again.",4,2012,02,20
223,nice but noisy,stayed here for one night befofe catching a flight.had stayed previously and enjoyed but not this time.was up in room watching telly at 5pm when this generator comes on making a lot of noise.i rang reception to make sure this wouldnt go on for long and was told for an hour or so which was ok.what i wasnt told was that it would come on again at 6am for another two hours.its a lovely hotel but if your staying at the back be ready to be woken early!!!!,3,2012,02,20
223,Very enjoyable,"Myself and my daughter stayed at the Castleknock Hotel a couple of weeks ago and really enjoyed it.   We went for the girls night in package which is fantastic value for 99 euro for one night B&B, one dinner, a 30 minute back massage and mini manicure.  The staff on the reception was very friendly on our arrival and we encountered this friendly service throughout our stay.   We dined in the restaurant where we had a lovely meal, thoroughly enjoyed our nights stay and would highly recommend this hotel especially for their girls package, looking forward to returning.",4,2012,02,20
223,Poor bar service.,"We stayed on a Saturday night recently on a great deal for B&B. Hotel is very big, looks great and very clean. Reception staff were lovely and very welcoming. Room was fine and spacious, had everything we needed, with a vending machine in the hall for some goodies!!!
As the restaurant was fully booked, we ate in the bar which has a good menu. The food was lovely, however the service was terrible.... It took ten minutes for someone to take our order and then they brought us the wrong drinks. Starter came out promptly, but it took ages for the main course to follow and when we had finished this no staff came near us to offer dessert. Tables either side of us began to leave as there was no staff to even order from. It wasn't like the bar was busy as there was only 4 other tables full!!! When staff finally appeared they apologised for the wait and we ordered 1 dessert and a coffee which took 20 minutes to arrive!!!
Breakfast in the morning was quick, good choice of food and nice staff.",3,2012,02,19
223,Really good hotel,"Stayed here 4 weeks back for one night's B&B. We didn't eat, so can't  comment but we had drinks in the lobby area before and after dinner in the Golf Club ( on the same grounds ). Staff were really nice, atmosphere was really good, seating area very cosy. A man was playing on the piano, was excellent. Room was really gorgeous. Big comfy bed and bathroom facilities were fab. Would highly recommend.",5,2012,02,17
223,"Lovely hotel, great value and super service!","We stayed at Castleknock Hotel for a weekend getaway in January. When we arrived and checked in, the reception staff were friendly and made you feel very welcome! The rooms are spacious and have nice views over the golf course. Bathrooms have both seperate walk-in shower and lovely deep bath, plus under floor heating, which was an added bonus!!
You'll find lots of options for dining, try the Park restuarant, we both had the steaks (which they are known for) and they were gorgeous!! Has a fantastic wine menu also.
I didn't manage to use the Spa as we headed in to Dublin, but I did have a quick look in and the pool was large and the area looked clean and well kept. Plus the treatments didn't look over priced, which you do find in some hotels.
There was a really nice atmosphere in the lobby and bar area. Whilst we were staying they had a live band playing which really made our evening.
The location is not in the centre of Dublin, which we did know before hand, but you really are not that far away, it took us around 15 mins to get in to the city centre, and also around 15 mins from the airport.
I would definitely recommend Castleknock hotel, we will be returning again duirng the year, look out for their special offers, amazing value!",5,2012,02,06
223,all i can say is pure class at a gud price,"from the minute we walked in the door i kwen it was going to a pleasurable stay.check in was quick and friendly,room was gorge and comfortable,bathroom magniff,lunch and coffee in the lobby perfect.the spa treatments totally worth the money(we got 15% off)dinner which was included in our price was lovely although not much of a selection for fussy eaters,but can order off a la carte menu and pay.and my favroite part was brekky it was exceptional,so much to choose from everything u can think of,and that was included in our price as well,my only complaint was the service in the fionn usice bar was very slow i had to wait 15mins to be served and when i got served they told me they had no mint for my mojito,but will defo be stayn there again.",5,2012,01,31
223,A very good 4 star hotel at  a very keen price,"I stayed here for 1 night break in January 2012 returning from a business meeting abroad. 
The Good points ~ overall the hotel is quite impressive and the room I stayed in was large , well decorated,  and the bed was comfortable . The bathroom with its separate walk in shower is  a bonus for people who simply don't like the bother of having to climb out of a wet  slippery bath on to a wet floor, just  to have a shower.  
The foyer and bar areas where spacious, well laid out and the Guinness  was excellent. The staff I encountered were polite, helpful and friendly,. The swimming pool and Jacuzzi were  superb  and the whole fitness area was clean and very  well maintained. In fact, the hotel, from top to bottom was spotlessly clean . For the price , this was comfortable  4 star quality at  a very keen price 
The not so good ~the bar food was ok but a tad pricey.  I had a slight a hic- up with the Wi-Fi, just before I left, I tried to log on to  the internet, but it would not connect. This could be a serious issue if you are dependent on it , however, I couldn‚Äôt wait around for it to be repaired. The only other down side is that the hotel  is, quite literally, in the middle of nowhere. It would be hard to find your way to and from it without a satnav , even though I am fairly familiar with Dublin, having lived there for many years.
That said. I was well impressed with this hotel and as a regular traveller through Dublin airport I will be back again for sure.   Well done all at  the Castleknock Hotel & Country Club",5,2012,01,27
223,Decent Hotel....but...,"I stayed here on a saturday night. The hotel looks great. The lobby/bar area are very impressive. The room was above average. It had a bath and separate walk in shower. The room had a double bed and a cheap thin hard, uneven pull out sofa bed. We didnt use it, but for those that do, i can only imagine they'd wake with a bendy spine..... it looked cheap and bad. 

Breakfast was included in the price and was goood. usual full irish buffet breakfast. I had dinner at the bar. THe chips were hard and undercooked. Other than that, it was grand. We ate our main course, but when it was done and we requested the dessert menu, we were told the kitchen was closed (??) Firstly, how hard is it to cut a slice of cheesecake, and why were we not informed during our main?? Other than this, the service was very friendly....

THere was live music and piano playing.She was not to my taste but she seemed popular. THe bar was busy for the location, I felt.

Location is in the middle of nowhere. It is just outside castleknock (Suburbia). Its a spa/golf hotel, which I didnt parttake in.....
its set on nice grounds, but is a trek to get into the local Town (or next to impossible to get into Dublin City centre).

It would make a nice weekend retreat if you were interested in Golf or just sitting around. THe food had potential, but we were let down by the staff on this occassion.

It was a nice stay but they could sort out their sofa beds and sort out their Kitchen staff....",4,2012,01,25
223,Luxurious 4 Star Hotel,"Stayed here for a 1 night break in January. The hotel is fabulous, staff very friendly and food excellent. We had a 1 night package (Bed, Breakfast & Evening Meal for 160 euro). We were very impressed with the hotel in general, beautiful decor, rooms spotless clean and fabulous spa and leisure facilities. Really enjoyed the dinner, although felt that the inclusive dinner was very limited and could of had a bit more varieity. We also had the choice of ordering from ala carte menu, but the allowance was only 20 euro per person and with some of the main courses alone being 25 euro, it would of worked out very expensive. (I think the allowance should be 30 euro each on the 160 euro package). Neverthless, the food was delicious. Thought the house wine was a bit pricey at 24 euro, as it was nothing special. Was especially impressed with the Irish Cheese Board for dessert.The Breakfast menu was great and everything to choose from cereal, fruit, breads, yogurts, juices and the full Irish Breakfast.  Although, i felt that some of the items in the hot plates had been left lying and were a bit dried up, and also the selection of cheeses and cold meats had seen better days!. Nonethless, really enjoyed the Castleknock Hotel and would have no hesitation in recommendng it to friends. Will definitely, be back.",5,2012,01,23
223,Can't keep me away,"I love staying at this hotel. Everything perfect about it except cost of food, which is a bit pricey. Would recommend this hotel to everyone and I will definitely return.",5,2012,01,23
223,Relaxing break,Stayed for 2 night short break in January and had a nice relaxing time.The hotel was relaunching their early bird menu and dining menu while we were there.Must say the food and menu's are terrific.It was nice to be asked for our opinion on the relaunch of the new early bird menu which we had .This was done in the most professional fashion by Martin and his team.The thing that makes this hotel so enjoyable is that it values it's repeat patrons and extends this welcome to new  patrons.It is professional in every aspect of hospitality even for families with young children.Well done to everyone.,5,2012,01,22
223,Love it!,"Stayed here last January with a few friends with the girls night in package and loved it so went back this jan with my boyfriend. Booked the 2 nights 1 dinner package. Was great. Food was gorgeous, breakfast was fantastic, rooms were lovely and clean. Booked a treatment in the spa, i had a facial and it was great. Really love this hotel. I love sitting in the lobby with a drink looking at the fire (on the tv :)). I had just finished some of my college finals so it was just a perfect place for me to relax and I thoroughly enjoyed it. 
I will definitely be back.",5,2012,01,22
223,Surprisingly good hotel!,"Stayed a night in December in order to go to a Christmas party, the hotel was pick due to its location and not on any other specifics.....and it was great!!

Friendly welcome and comfortable rooms with a great view and fabulous shower..... Relaxed atmosphere at the bar.....and a great breakfast to help get the next day started! 

Would recomend this hotel for business but it is a bit far out from the centre of Dublin.",4,2012,01,19
223,A place to stay for Dublin and the countryside,Have stayed at Castleknock Hotel twice and on each occasion I been impressed by the service and the friendliness. Families with children of all ages are welcome. The food is impressive and the rooms are first rate. On one occasion we stayed it was for a christening and nothing seemed to be too much trouble. Very good deals to be had depending how far in advance you book. Close to Dublin and the countryside. We have family nearby and will be using the hotel again.,4,2012,01,18
223,Great stay in a lovely hotel,"We stayed here last Saturday night, and it was lovely. Check in was swift, I like the way you need the room key to access any of the floors. The room was spacious, and spotlessly clean. It was a non smoking room, but there was a definite smell of smoke in it. Lucky it was a mild evening so we opened the window and it cleared a fair bit. There is an iron and hiar dryer in the room ( HD was in the drawer under the tv). the bathroom was again spacious and very clean. They had hair conditioner which I think is handy (I never remember to bring mine), lovely soft fluffy towels, soft tissues etc. The shower did leak out a bit onto the main floor, so maybe put down an extra towel. There was no air con in the room that we could find, but the rom didnt get warm until the morning so wasnt a problem for us.The rooms seem to be pretty sound proof, as there was a hen and a wedding and we never heard anything at all.
They have sown the curtains in the room at the top, but if you are in a room at the front the lights from outside shine in brightly over the top of them.
The pool area is lovely and all very clean (yes I am a bit of a clean freak!!) We had it to ourselves when we went down, and it was lovely. There is a viewing deck there also, if you want to sit back and relax. We didnt use the gym but it looked great, very well equiped.  You do need to sign in and out of the leisure area. Swimming hats are ‚Ç¨3 each, and you will need a euro coin for the locker. My husband said there is a dad and child changing area in the mens changig rooms, which is also good. 
All in all, this is a lovely hotel, where we would definitely go again, despite some of the smaller gripes we had. No where is perfect.",5,2012,01,11
223,Very nice hotel,"We had a lovely room which overlooked the gardens.  The hotel is very modern and clean.  The restaurant was very nice and service was great.  The only downside is that the pool is children free after 6:00pm.  Our kids wanted to go swimming and couldn't.  BUT if you don't have kids, then this is great.",5,2012,01,10
223,lovely place for family,"from the time we made phone call to book a room, the staffs are all so very kind and friendly.
they didnt have any family rooms left that night but our room was just fine for us(2adults and a small child) with a big double bed and a sofa bed.
nice food, good bar, had some fun at playground outside with child, swimming pool was very good too for family user - believe also good for non-family.
would love to go back there again sometime very soon.",5,2012,01,07
223,pure relaxation,"just stayed at the hotel for a break from the kids after the xmas madness.
and from the moment we arrived it was brilliant . reception staff so friendly .our room was spotless and had all mod coms and lovely view . we had lovely meal in the park resturant and it was really nice and relaxing meal . then out to the lobby bar for some live music and the singer was excellent and sang huge range of songs . bar staff were so good also . lovely sleep that night and then big breakfast next morning .
cant fault this hotel .
we got married here five years ago and the managed to maintain really high standards .
hotel still looks brand new .   well done",5,2012,01,01
223,A lovely spot for a morning coffee,"Regularly visit this hotel for a coffee & pastry in the morning and always enjoy the atmosphere and surroundings.  The modern and spacious decor of the lobby area and the glass wall in the bar area always make the place feel airy.  Coffee here is good and pastries or scones are very nicely presented, staff always helpful and friendly.",5,2011,12,28
223,highly recommended,"This is my third visit to Castleknock and I cannot recommend it enough for anyone looking for a relaxing break and also a chance to pamper yourself. The staff are very friendly and efficient, the spa is brilliant, the hot stones are a must and the food is excellent, even for fussy eaters. I have been on a family weekend, a girly weekend and also on a romantic break with my husband and each time I have thoroughly enjoyed the experience.",5,2011,12,28
223,Comfortable modern well run hotel,"We recently spent a night in Castleknock - our second visit - thanks to an incredible offer.
We highly recommend it.  Very friendly, efficient staff:  we had ordered a taxi and receptionist brought the driver over to us in the bar instead of just giving directions;  breakfast room staff moved tables, set up high chairs, looked after a buggy for a family with small children without being asked.
Comfortable well designed rooms and an excellent breakfast.
Only disadvantage is that the hotel is located about 30 minutes from Dublin centre.
We have not tried out the golf course or spa.",5,2011,12,17
223,Fabulous swimming pool!,"We stayed here in April and brought our youngest (at 14 months old).  My husband was working in Blanchardstown at the time so as a treat we stayed here for 3 days.  

We didn't have the best view from our bedroom but it was spacious and very clean and comfy.  

The restaurant has the most amazing light fixtures and the breakfast was amazing (I don't know how they do their sausages but they have nearly an apple flavour!)  The newspaper is an added bonus.

My daughter loved the pool and I loved getting my nails done with a friend at the spa.

My only gripe is that I was without a car and I had to get very expensive taxis to go anywhere (a return trip to Blanchardstown shopping centre cost 30 ).

All in all = a very reasonably priced break and a great place to eat and stay..",4,2011,12,16
223,Excellent hotel,"I stayed in the Castleknock hotel for one night and would highly recemmend it, clean spacious room and very friendly staff, lovely spa and leisure facilities, the only slight criticism i would have would be the prices in the park restaurant so if you are booking try to get a dinner included in the package, other than that a five star rating.",5,2011,12,05
223,Very happy with my stay,"We stayed here for a hen night a couple of weekends ago.  I have to say everything was lovely, we had massages and manicures, then a lovely four course meal and an overnight stay.

Firstly the spa was beautiful and i was very imressed with the treatments we received, the only thing i would have to say is that they did not have drier for our nails, but that's a small nearly insignificant thing compared to the service we received.

The meal we had was delicious, although a couple of our group had to wait some time after we got our main course for theirs, but I could not fault the food, either dinner, breakfast or lunch the following day, all was very satisfactory.

The night we were there there were a couple of parties on but this did not take away from the service we received.

The rooms were very spacious and very clean, but the flush on the toilet in our room wasn't great.

So overall we had a very pleasant stay and would definitely recommend it to anyone.",5,2011,11,28
223,Wonderful place to stay!,Hotel was very nice. Very friendly staff. Food we ordered from the resturant was very good also. If we return to Ireland we would stay here again! Thanks for a great stay Castleknock!,5,2011,11,25
223,Third trip here this year !,"This was the third time my husband and I had stayed here this year. I really cannot fault the hotel or staff in any way, Our room was spotless as always, beds made up every day. All the staff were friendly , polite and helpful. Although we didn't opt for breakfast , the food we had in the brasserie was excellent, The pool and gym are also spotless, and the this morning while swimming I enjoyed beautiful blue skies thru the windows. :)
Christmas was just being put up this past couple of days, the tree outside the lift area looked fab!
We hope to be back again next year !
The only thing that was annoying was the fire alarm going off early hours one morning....I can only assume some naughty person was smoking in their room ....",5,2011,11,22
223,Another excellent stay,"My family and I stay in the hotel very regularly and always avail of the offers including the 4 course meal, B&B, executive room and this time we also got the complimentary drink at the bar after dinner! Rooms really clean, very comfortable and really warm. Food and service excellent in the restaurant and breakfast was served to our room piping hot! I had emailed in advance to say we were staying for a very special occasion so like previous stays we'd thought the staff may have left a little something in the room but think they forgot but it was fine as we had a marvellous stay and will of course be back again as it is such fantastic value for money! Please keep up the special offers!!!",5,2011,11,13
223,Highly recommended,"Stayed here recently for 12 nights as I was back home from Sydney and live locally. Was very happy with our stay from start to finish - the staff on reception are very helpful, as are all the staff around the hotel. Special mention has to go to the lady who runs the restaurant at breakfast time, she really went above and beyond the call of duty and made sure that myself, my wife, and infant were well looked after.

Its been mentioned on other reviews - but yes, the rooms can get slightly hot as they are not air conditioned. A combination of using the fan provided, and opening a window in our room for an hour sorted this out quickly though.",5,2011,11,13
223,"Would recommend, well worth the trip, golf, shopping, spa, perfect","Stayed for 2 nights bb and evening meal, there were 3 couples in our party.  Got room service on first night, couldn't fault it, bit pricey, but not over the top. Couldn't get wifi in bedrooms, but could in reception, was a but of a pain, but still fine as was available in reception and bar areas, rooms were spotless, but just a bit too warm ( just opened window did the trick) staff very friendly and helpful, breakfast and dinner lovely, men played golf and found course great and clubhouse had lovely food, with beautiful views. Close to blanchardstown shopping centre. Pool wonderful overlooking course, would return in the morning, we felt like we got a wonderful deal, highly recommend here",4,2011,11,08
223,Very Good Hotel,"We had a 2 night mid week stay here recently. Hotel very clean and staff very nice. Lovely view out window of spacious room. Breakfast was fair. good selection but scrambled eggs tasted very unusual. Dinner was good. Lovely atmosphere in hotel. Staff seemed to be working very hard to cope with a busy hotel. I even saw a manager on 2 occasions helping out when the dining room and bar got very busy. Pool and sauna/ steam area was nice and clean. very crowded before 6pm and lane swimming impossible. really quietened down after 6pm.  Location is a possible issue for some people. A good distance from city. Taxi ‚Ç¨20 -‚Ç¨25 one way.
Overall a very good hotel with staff courtesy and service its prime assett.",4,2011,11,07
223,No Complimentary Water,"The food is decent and if you're a Golfer I imagine you will appreciate the beautiful course however, this hotel is massive with not enough staff. Every encounter at Reception resulted in joining a long queue. We were staying in a family room which was very small and not provided with water. When I enquired about this they confirmed that they don not provide this service but as an exception they would send 2 small bottles to our room. When I signed for them we had been charged 5 euros for Room Service! Hilarious. 
They did refund this charge and I submitted a customer questionnaire which they responded to via email. Hopefully they've changed a bit now!",2,2011,11,07
223,Excellent room,"I booked the room for the Suite Treat offer to experience a romantic break with my partner. The offer included an overnight stay in a suite, rose petals on the bed and some chocolates in the room, plus ‚Ç¨40 towards dining within the hotel. 

Getting to this hotel is not the easiest, small roads and mad drivers make it altogether a stessful start to the trip. 

The hotel looks very nice on the outside; very spacious grounds, golf course to the rear and itself, a rather well designed building. Inside had a modern look, some money was obviously spent keeping it nice. 

The first thing you notice is a large open lounge area, big screen tele which was showing football when we arrived (up one notch in my book) and a bar further to the back, so not as you'd normally expect to see first, being the reception. This is over to the left as you enter, by the restaurant. The room was lovely, probably the nicest I've ever stayed in, definitely the largest, but there was a lack of the rose petals and chocolates as detailed in the package when booked; so as far as we were concerned, it was just another hotel room and that touch of something special wasn't lacking. I went to the reception and explained the omission, the receptionist (Sabrina) was very polite and had it arranged for me while I took my partner to check out the restaurant menu.

The hotel dining consists of a brasserie and the Park Steak restaurant, both in the same place, the Park being to the rear with less noise and more comfort and a very pricey menu. We ate from the brasserie menu, price covered in the package. The meal was really nice and service was great.

The health suite is clean with the suana, steam room etc offering some relaxation. The downside was that it closes at 19:30 at the weekends, it would have been great to be able to stay a bit later. 

There was live ""entertainment"" on in the lounge that evening; it didn't appeal to either of us, given that the hotel is fairly distant from the city, we retreated to our room. 

Bed was comfortable; room was very warm (I had to turn the radiator down) and quiet if you leave the window closed, as some swans out the back make noise regularly in the night. 

All in all, it was a pleasant stay. Not a very intimite hotel, it is too big and busy for that, but it does look good, offers a good mix of services, plus the staff, while rushed off their feet, were actually polite. The prices are high, but thats Dublin!",4,2011,11,06
223,Good night,Stayed here recently for a family's birthday and found it very good.,4,2011,11,03
223,Excellent service,"I booked a double room with a great rate for dinner bed and breakfast. The weather was terrible with local flooding which made us late booking in....after 9pm. We called hotel as the road was flooded, the receptionist stayed on the phone guiding us through an alternative route. When we got to the hotel the dining room was closed, the night manager arranged for us to get dinner. Everyone we dealt with were just fantastic! Thank you",5,2011,11,01
223,Nice Hotel,Very nice extra helpful staff and a spacious and well appointed hotel.  Rooms are just about starting to show the wear from all the wedding guests over the years but perfectly clean and well looked after. The lounge and bar had a bit of a Holiday Camp feel with a Singer but that was quite nice and atmospheric.  The A La Carte Restaurant was very good. Didn't use any of the Sports facilities but they looked great.,4,2011,10,29
223,Deal of the year,"My husband and I booked a night away with the ""Deal of the Year"" offer. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this hotel. We were lucky to have been able to avail of the executive room with a fantastic view of the golf course. The staff are a credit to the hotel. Very friendly and helpful. A special mention to the lovely lady who works in the breakfast room. We had a gorgeous meal, so tasty. All in all we had a lovely relaxing time and would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2011,10,24
223,Beautiful Hotel,"Stayed here last night and the hotel room was very spacious,modern and of a high clean standard throughout. We had our dinner included and the menu was excellent for an inclusive package. Food was fabulous and service was going great until our bill was thrown done on our table at 11.20pm and was told the tills had to be closed. This made me very angry as i was enjoying a romantic evening with my husband and we were enjoying our liquer coffees and would have liked another but it was like our night had to end.
I did however appreciate the drink the manager gave me for helping out as a First Aider with an incident that happened in the dining room but i do wonder why no member of staff on duty was a trained First Aider as this is compulsory in the Hotel Industry.",4,2011,10,23
223,Midweek break,"Couldnt find much fault anywhere - friendly efficient staff - good food - very clean and tidy. A compact room which had everything including a view of the golf course. They could have turned the heat up a bit though as it is the only time we were ever supplied with a heater in a hotel room. Great offer and worth taking advantage of it. The treatments were very good also.
Enjoy it",5,2011,10,22
223,great value on special offer,"We got a special offer on this hotel and had a lovely time.  the pool is lovely and walks around the grounds are peaceful.  Im not a golfer but it looks good!! we got a room a fair walk from the reception area but was so quiet and had a great nights sleep!!  the breakfast was lovely, the restaurant was lovely with a great selection but a bit pricy.  I would have rathered a more cosy feel hotel, it is a bit too modern for my liking. i probably wouldnt pay the full price to be honest but did enjoy the stay",4,2011,10,18
223,Excellent hotel from all the points of view,"We celebrated a birthday in the family at the weekend, everything was excellent. Room was big, clean, modern, comfortable bed, nice view on the sport fields.
Breakfast was great, swimming pool and gym were very nice, personnel was very friendly and professional. We also enjoyed the live music and the very modern comfortable sofas from the lobby. 
The surroundings are amazing, it was a very nice relaxing weekend. 
This is definately one of the best hotels we ever stayed in.",5,2011,10,17
223,Nice Hotel,"This is a four star hotel. Very nice. Nothing above and beyond though.
The rooms are a little bit bigger than normal which was nice and staff are helpful.
Breakfast was lovely (but it's hard to get that wrong)
Wasn't crazy about the Restaurant, staff were really good and efficient but wasnt so taken on the food. For what you get i thought it was very overpriced.",4,2011,10,14
223,Great Night Away!,"We attended the wedding reception of a friend and stayed in this hotel last night. As we were not attending the wedding dinned we availed of an overnight package which included a four course evening meal + a drink of your choice, bed and breakfast for ‚Ç¨69! We got there at 5.45pm and the receptionist on duty (I didn't get her name) was very nice and courteous. 

The room was very spacious, and the bathroom big with a separate bath and walk in shower. The bathroom had funky purple lighting which I thought was a nice touch!

Dinner was very lovely - good choices and the restaurant was full with a good mix of golfers, couples and families. There is a good big bar and lots of nice modern seating alcoves. I enjoyed my stay and unfortunately as we were only there one night we didn't have time to avail of the spa! The one thing I would recommend would be to provide bottled water in the room.

Would I return",4,2011,10,08
223,absolutely perfect,We stayed here for a night just for a weekend away and i can honestly say i could not fault it. I had discovered a room only offer on the website which worked out at around ‚Ç¨60. The hotel was relatively easy to find with the help of a sat nav!! The hotel looks impressive.from the outside and grounds are kept immaculate. Reception is beautiful and spacious. We had arrived too early so we had a drink at the bar and service was great. Check-in was quick and simple. We had a top floor room and the room was amazing. Cleanest hotel room i have ever seen! They had even sprinkled rose petals on the bed! Bed was really comfy. We ate dinner in the bar and the food was great. Checkout was less than a minute! Cant wait to get back here!!!! :),5,2011,09,28
223,Excellent stay,"We stayed here for one night and will definately return, the hotel is spacious with plenty of sitting areas and bars, we had dinner in the restaurant on the night we arrived and the food was excellent but the waitress was a bit snobby. When we arrived at the restuarant I explained to the girl we had only one hour to have dinner and she said no bother that we would be out in plenty of time but lets just say before we were finished our main course the hour was up which was very disappointing. 
The receptionist were excellent and we stayed in a suite which was fabulous and spacious, we plan to return with our kids around christmas as there was a lovely family friendly feel to the hotel.",5,2011,09,28
223,Lovely!,"Great place, great price, great food, great spa, great service! 

Brilliant girly break spent here :)

Tip: Book spa in advance!!",5,2011,09,27
223,An Irish Gem,"We really enjoyed our stay at the CastleKnock. We've stayed there before but this was our first trip with our baby daughter. The hotel was baby-friendly, as were the staff, the rooms were unbelievably clean and the bathrooms are amazing. We had a wonderful stay and can't wait to return. :)",5,2011,09,20
223,"Very clean, rooms a bit stuffy","Stayed here with my wife and son (2years) for 3 nights. Room very clean, cleaning regime seems to be very tight! Room gets a bit hot at night but quiet enough to open window. Parking is great. The Foyer and bar/restaurant is easy on the eye but lacks a bit of atmosphere. Small kids park outside is handy and leisure facilities were fine. Great hotel for a trip to the zoo! This is my 2nd time here and I would come back again, but it wouldn't be top of my list. That being said.......it does exactly what it says on the tin.",4,2011,09,19
223,Nice Hotel,"This hotel was nice, the staff was very friendly and helpfull.  The rooms were nice, the bed wasnt the most comfortable but we made due, and there is not air conditioning but it wasnt really needed.  The hotel and rooms were clean.  The location is a little our of Dublin's main area, but if you are renting a car it is a short drive to everything.  We did not play golf or eat or drink at the hotel.  I would stay here again.",5,2011,09,15
223,Slightly overpriced,"We stayed at this hotel for our anniversary after buying an online deal for one night.

We arrived at the hotel mid afternoon and went swimming, pool area small and only room for two people to swim lengths at one time.  Jacuzzi was closed, with no sign for the reason.  I then went for some spa treatments.  Having received some of these treatments in other spas I can definitely say one of the treatments was not done by someone trained in this area.  However the other two treatments were fantastic.  , 

Bar food is extremely tasty, good selection but on the expensive side.  Bar staff nice and friendly. 

We were given an executive room as this was included in the deal, however this room was at the back of the hotel, looking out onto an extention and it had a huge air con system blasting noise into our room even with the window closed.  I phoned reception asking how long it made noise for and she said till about 11pm.  As we were there for a relaxing night away we asked could we be changed.  We were moved to the front of the hotel overlooking the car park.  

Dinner was fantastic, staff were lovely and we stayed in the lobby for a few drinks.  We did notice there were a lot of kids staying over, some well behaved, some running wild.  

We then went upstairs to finish our drinks and we could hear everything going in the hallway, people returning to their rooms and ALL of the doors slamming (they are all on springs).  

The pressure in the shower wasn't great but the bathroom was beautifully decorated with plenty of space and very clean.  We got breakfast in bed, not all of what we ordered was on the tray but we made do with what we had. 

We also got a bottle of wine in our online deal which was not in the room and I had to ring down to ask could we have it, the receptionist said it wasn't included.  When I told her I had a print out of the deal which stated a bottle of wine was included she said she'd send one up.  

I've stayed here before with a group of friends but I'm not sure we'd stay again or also not sure if I'd recommend it to a friend.....",3,2011,09,13
223,Clean and comfortable.,"My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights in August.   The room was comfortable and very clean, the bathroom had a very nice shower plus a separate bath and an array of the usual complimentary shampoos, creams, etc.   And the staff were amazingly helpful, friendly and cheerful.   One young lady who brought us a blanket to replace the too hot duvet (she was from another European country) deserves to be on the front desk as she went way beyond what was expected from cleaning staff.

We ate in the dining room both nights and took advantage of the early bird menu.   For the price it was good value.  The breakfast each morning consisted of the usual buffet style starters and then a cooked breakfast of ones choice.   This arrived hot and was very tasty.

The one BIG drawback was the fact that there was no separate dining area for the more mature couples who don't wish to be surrounded by a host of VERY noisy children.   We've been there, done that, worn the T shirt for years ... and now feel we've earned the right to some quiet meals when on holiday!   

That being said - we would go back should the occasion arise as the pluses far outweighed the cons.",4,2011,09,13
223,Superb late night service,"We stayed here for a few days from 10th - 12th of July in one of their executive suites. Room was perfect for ourselves and our 7 year old child. Our son got sick on the last night and the night attendant on duty was so kind and helpful. I just want to say a massive thank you to the hotel staff for helping our family get through the night. The hotel let us stay an extra few hours in the room for free seeing as our son was so sick (we were due to check out at 12am that afternoon). They couldn't do enough for us. 
    The hotel itself is perfectly situated in Dublin for family adventures (Tayto Park is only a 30 min drive away, Dublin Zoo is only 5 - 10 mins, Aqua centre is only 5 mins). It feels like your in the countryside even though your near the city centre. Swimming pool is lovely. Very bright and clean. Rooms are extremely clean and of 4 star quality. Will definitely be going back to stay again.

Thanks again to the all the staff (especially the night porter who was working on the 12th)",4,2011,09,12
223,Stayed again & loved it even more,"went up and stayed 1 nite with my sisters and mom as we were goin shopping in Ikea the the following morning, very fast check, room was very nice, we went for a swim which was very relaxing and had dinner in the restuarant which was part of the package and the food was delicious and service was just as great. this is my second time staying in this hotel and would def recommend this fab hotel",5,2011,09,12
223,Excellent hotel,Stayed at the hotel for three days in May. Found the staff to be very helpful. The rooms were beautifully decorated and spotless. Thee front office staff were extremely polite and even gave us an upgrade. The golf course was lovely too. Would recommend this hotel to anyone.,4,2011,09,09
223,Friendliest and Most Efficient Staff Ever,I had a wonderful stay here.  The staff were so helpful from finding Australian power adapters to getting cups of coffee when you are too early for breakfast and need to be at airport asap.,5,2011,08,31
223,Great Hotel and Excellent for Children,"Stayed at Castleknock Hotel for the bank holiday weekend in the north, two nights, room only for a good price.  The staff were friendly and helpful, but not in your face.  The room was spacious and well finished, with a shower, bath, TV, sofa bed, etc.  All in all the room was very comfortable, but aircon may have been useful and a bit of noise from extractor fan at back of hotel, but didn't really bother us.  There didn't appear to be any major attractions in walking distance, but Blanchardstown and Phoenix Park are short drive away.  The real bonus of this hotel is how it is well set up to cater for children and i would say it is very family friendly.

This place provides all you need for a comfortable weekend break in Dublin (particularly if you've a nipper in toe).

Top Tip: A voucher for irish breakfast can be purchased in advance at reception for ‚Ç¨10.",4,2011,08,30
223,Lovely hotel and setting spoiled by poor guest management,"Chose this hotel because in town for a wedding and it is so incredibly convenient to and from the airport. It was great to arrive at a haven of peace and tranquility with all the hustle and bustle of the city so close.Only booked in for one night but would have liked and will have a longer stay in the future.
Checkin was early and was no problem for the staff and room was superb!Large ,airy and light a bit like the good Sea view ones ones in Carlton Kinsale.Excellent separate shower and bath areas excellent decoration and well furnished with huge bed!!Sleep was divine and although music and functions...did not hear a thing!
Breakfast was ok, the usual buffet but in a lovely spacious and contemporary space with lots of room and light .getting down earlier is the better option although wasnt frantic at 1030 as in many places..and no queues!

.The hotel is a large and very welcoming property with acres of space both inside and outside. i mean, there were five bars and all well designed, amongst them the oval open planned bar off the foyer area with lots of alcoves and secluded as well as open areas to sit.leather couches, subtle artwork and clever lighting usually make this a very relaxing place to take a drink of an evening or sample the extensive bar menu.Baby grand piano was a most welcome but not overly intrusive distraction.Saturday night there is an excellent  trad itional music slot  which is not a well kept secret anymore, music is excellent and people came to stay for that regular event!
The pool area was alittle disappointing, sort of half thought out kidney shaped affair with not too much room but jacuzzi,sauna and steam room were ok.
There was one persistent annoying problem experienced by the majority of guests around 1030pm ,that of quite a lot of tired, bored small...very small children tearing around the place and in the bar and relaxation areas spilling drink, running bare footed ,all over the furniture with an awful racket and dangerously over marble flloring with glass bottles.completely out of control and unsupervised.Hey! now we've many of us had children and taken them to hotels and acted responsibly towards them and other hotel guests.But ....surely after 830-9, enough is enough and the poor mites are tired , distraught ,screaming and bawling would tell one so particularly by 1045!!!!?Hotel management were caught between selling a steady stream of drinks and offending the parents.They had words with several groups of parentsas requested by several sets of guests  but to no avail ,being ignored by groups of well sloshed ""adults""?? and the foyer was eventually abandoned by relaxing couples and responsible families with chaos and very bad health and safety scenarios developing.
This is mismanagement at its very very worse and i have never seen it anywhere else and it thoroughly ruined  not only our ,but many other couples and families evening and stay so be warned for guests we spoke to said this was often a regular occurrence.Parents!!if you want to unwind, get drunk and let your children create mayhem and harm...do it in your own homes where it belongs!",4,2011,08,28
223,Wedding Trip,"Good Visit

Stayed for two nights for a wedding.

Arrived at 4 O‚Äôclock to check-in.  Check-in was slow only one lady at desk, she was dealing with check-in and answering the phone.  Check-in is from 3 O‚Äôclock so room should have been ready.  My room wasn‚Äôt ready and had to wait till 6 O‚Äôclock for the room.  Staff just hand key to room and didn‚Äôt bother giving you any information about the hotel (were the restaurant/ bar/ pool or room was in hotel).

Bar and lobby area are very nice and the floor staff are more than helpful.  

Bedrooms are of a good standard.  But don‚Äôt get a room on the first floor as you won‚Äôt get any sleep till after 2am when the function room events end.  Noise levels are high.

There is a golf course on the ground which is worth a visit and I‚Äôd recommend Luttrellstown Golf Club which is only 5 minutes drive from the hotel.",4,2011,08,27
223,Nice Hotel - Disappointed with breakfast,"Just back from a two night break.  Overall the room was clean and big enough for our family of four - though too warm at night - no AC for a 4* hotel!!! (although it did take us ages to get to the room - endless corridors!

Breakfast - bit disappointed - pork & leek sausages and smoked bacon (died of thirst for two days) - I only ate it as it was paid for!

Pool - too small, and has no rails around the sides to hold on to - so if you are a poor swimmer there is nothing to hold on to... No supervision by staff / lifeguards as the reception of the pool is just off the reception area of the hotel and well away from the pool - there is no windows for them to see through...  (most people were not wearing hats - is this not law in Ireland?). Also at different times I saw young children in the jacuzzi - it is clearly stated that under 16s are not allowed in the jacuzzi but because there is no staff on hand parents ignored this.

Apart from this we had a pleasant stay and would consider going back (if breakfast menu was changed - it is definitely not too everyones taste).....",4,2011,08,20
223,GOOD HOTEL BUT IRELAND IS EXPENSIVE AT PRESENT,"Quick check in , mordern hotel very spacious and rooms are very tidy and clean.Rooms can get very warm at night and are poorly lit. The leisure centre is good but kids have to be out of the swiming pool by 6 pm and a bathing caps is 3 euro as other hotels are free and recylce their caps.
The foods is just ok nothing to write home about with the choice some what  limited if you are on a b&b and evening meal booking we had two meals out off our four night stay and the menu did not change, you can eat from the al la cate menu bu the hotel only offers a 20 euro allowance which will not get you very much. Guinness is hard to get as on two separate occassion i ordered from a waiter in the seated reception area both times it did not arrive. 
The hotel is about 9 km from DUBLIN & DUBLIN zoo but not close to public transport so a car is needed to travel around. there is a park and ride about 5- 10 minutes drive at coolmines train station 10 EURO for a return family train ticket to DUBLIN.
If you are traveling to Ireland from NI or UK it is expensive at present expect to pay from 1.5 to twice the price for goods compared to NI/ UK",4,2011,08,17
223,Great hotel. Very impressed,"Just back from a one night stay and I didn't want to leave  very relaxing hotel.  About 15 mins from Dublin city and very near to two shopping centres, Phoenix pk and zoo. I thought it great value for money.  Service was fantastic.  Nothing was too much trouble for staff.  We ate in restaurant.  4 course meal.  Couldn't finish it but food was fantastic.  B fast a buffet style. Check in very swift.  Rooms quite large well furnished.  Bathroom has bath and separate shower.  Very large foyer with lots easy sofas and coffee bar.  Separate bar for adults only.  Golf course just outside hotel, looks very good. Good pool and spa.  Yes, it's not city centre but you are not paying city centre prices.  They have a sister hotel in temple bar if that appeals more but I for one like the peace and quiet at castle knock.  You really come away refreshed.  Only complaint is that pillows very hard but next time I go I'll get the staff to change them.  For a relaxing break where you will be well looked after please try castle knock",4,2011,08,16
223,We love this place!!!,"We got married here last summer and it was fantastic. All the staff that we dealt with were never less than professional and always warm and friendly. Anytime we had meetings with the events staff we were always treated to comp. Tea, coffee, bikkies and drinks for the kids, (might seem trivial but i was a genuine groomzilla and there were a lot of meetings). The so called food and wine tasting turned out to be a full four course meal with all the wine we could drink on the night again complimentary. Then to top it all off almost a year later we recieve, in the post, an invitation to a complimentary dinner for 2 with wine to celebrate our first anniversary,(made all the better by the fact that we hadnt plannned on doing anything for it because we hadnt a washer that week).

 We are locals and in my opinion there is nothing nicer to do in dublin 15 on a hot sunday afternoon than sit in their beer garden for a few pints.

So thats why we love this place we will definitely be back and back and back again.",4,2011,08,08
223,Friendly and perfect,"Check in fast and friendly. Bedroom spacious with everything you need and expect from a four star. Big bed,comfy. Had the early bird dinner in the restraunt and it is amazing value and quality. I could go on and on and on but overall this hotel is fantastic and you will not be dissapointed. A taxi back from city centre lat at night cost 16.50.",5,2011,08,08
223,"Lovely hotel, nicely laid out, lovely grounds , nice atmosphere..","Our family stayed here last year for one night only. Although the hotel is a little bit isolated I have to say its really nice, the grounds are well maintained and its perfect even for families with younger children or tots to roam around, there is even a little playground. It is very spacious with a lovely bar area big couches and a nice atmosphere. When we stayed it was very popular with young families on mid term break and each night there seemed to be a good crowd in the bar. The rooms were fabulous, quite plush and luxurious. We had our teenage daughter with us who was accomodated on  a layaway bed in the room - Blanchardstown shopping is closeby but you will need a car to get around. We would not hesitate to come back for a relaxing weekend. Would give the Castleknock hotel and country club 8 out of 10 and wouldnt hesitate to recommend it to others..",4,2011,08,05
223,Lovely Hotel,"This was our second visit after a very enjoyable stay last October. The location is peaceful but close to the zoo in the Phoenix park  and near Blanchardstown and Liffey valley shopping centres.  We looked forward to our return visit and although the hotel was very busy we had a lovely stay. 
The check in was fast and friendly.  Our bedroom was very comfortable and spotlessly clean. It was a very warm  night but we couldn't leave our window open, as the noise from the extractor fans outside  was too loud..
The staff in the restaurant worked very hard,as the restaurant was very busy. There were lots of families with young children yet  the staff were very efficient and attentive.
The dinner was included in our stay and while it was great value, the choice was limited . The A La Carte menu was  more tempting .
Overall it is a lovely comfortable hotel in the Dublin countryside with  a lot on its doorstep. With very friendly and efficient staff we will look forward again to another visit .....perhaps at a quieter time.",4,2011,08,02
223,What a great place lovely food and lovely rooms,Went with friends for a break.  The hotel is lovely and very near the Phoenix Park if you want a visit to the zoo. Food in the restaurant is excellent and offers a very comprehensive menu and is value for money.  We will definately be back.,5,2011,08,02
223,Fantastic Hotel... The Staff were all so helpful and I would have loved to stay longer!!!,"Just back from a 2 night stay in Castleknock Hotel.  We absolutely loved our stay.  For a 4 star hotel the value for money was excellent.

The hotel is in a great location for getting into Dublin City Centre.  We walked to the train station in 15 minutes (the bus stop was closer but takes slightly longer so we opted for the train).  Also very handy to Phoenix Park (Dublin Zoo) & Blanchardstown Shopping Centre which were both only a few minutes drive away.

The hotel was extremely clean and room had everything required - the bed was very comfortable and the shower was great!!.  

I had mentioned when booking that the stay was for my partners 50th birthday and the staff had left a birthday card, cake and bowl of fruit for him.  This was a lovely touch, which was much appreciated, and made the stay even more special.

All the staff went out of their way to be helpful and were very friendly - I must especially mention Paul who works in the Fionn Uisce bar  - he made us feel very welcome when we arrived, as we had a bite to eat, whilst waiting for our room to be ready.  The food in the bar was delicious and reasonably priced.

We would highly recommend and will definitely be returning in the future.",5,2011,07,31
223,Enjoyed my stay,"Stayed here with my teenage daughter for three days. We stayed in a suite which was very nice and cosy. We were on a spa package and I got a hot stone back massage, a pedicure and a manicure done. My duaghter got a pedicure and manicure done. The staff in the spa are most friendly, a big thank you especially to Grace, she is a true professional and excellent at her job. I was very pleased.
We had dinner on the first night as it was included and it was very good, the staff were very attentive. The second night we got a taxi and went into Blanchardstown to the Ming Garden chinese, all in all a very nice evening and the service was excellent. The taxi, was 16 euro there and 12 back, not sure how that was!
We dined in the bar on our last evening, Paul gave us excellent service and again we enjoyed our food. Breakfast is very busy, however there is a good selection for everyone and service is attentive.
I did go to the pool, and used the saunas which were lovely. Overall, a nice relaxing few days, I would recommend a few days away, very close to Blanchardstown shopping centre which my daughter loved.
Just wanted to say thank you to Nicola in reception, Elaine and Kathyrn, the duty managers, Aidan the floor manager who all took time to make my stay more personal.",4,2011,07,29
223,Had a great relaxing few days,"Needed a few relaxing days so booked the hotel for a 2 night stay in July 2011.When we got there we requested if there was a room available for a third night .This was not a problem an we were allowed the same room. As we stayed before and was aware of the high standard of this hotel we were very surprised at  the high level of service given to everyone even in these difficult times .There were many families with young children who enjoyed the pool and children area.Bar and restaurant service was quick and professional.Service in the Park restaurant was super with very little wait between courses.Excellent selection of wines and food available and many different meal selections available(early bird ,bar,and evening menus).Food service in bar up to 10pm with good selection.Rooms were clean ,tidy and well maintained.Good place for those needing a relaxing break and even good for those with families.Near to Dublin Zoo.
Staff very helpful and professional.Planning our next return.",5,2011,07,29
223,Nice hotel ! but,"Attended for civil wedding at hotel - great idea - great room and lovely atmosphere - stayed night before - room was nice but had awful smell which seemed to be coming from shower drain - we informed housekeeping who sent someone to look at it - we headed into town and returned late but still had lingering smell - ( wife was undergoing chemo and very sensitive to smells etc) Informed reception next morning girl was lovely - she said she would talk to manager. On check out I was informed that next time I would be upgraded. Was happy at time but on reflection felt could and should have looked at the current stay not a future one. Would prob stay here again as overall hotel, bar and staff were  nice and golf course looked great !",4,2011,07,26
223,True 4 star hotel,"This is our second time staying here and are planning another visit later in the year with all the family.  The hotel is top class, staff are attentive and efficient, restaurant is beautiful and the food was really good.  There is a lot of good things I could say about this hotel but I would be here all day.  To sum it up, if you decide to stay here you won't be disappointed.",5,2011,07,25
223,Lovely hotel but disappointing spa,"Stayed here with my husband on a 1 night spa break. Great value for what we paid as it included dinner, breakfast plus a ‚Ç¨100 Tonic spa voucher. I had 3 treatments for the price of the voucher one of which was a french manicure...not a good move as the manicure wasn't done very well. The spa although being nice does not have shower facilities in it, you have to go down to the pool area and they don't supply towels...very disappointing in comparison to other spa hotel I have been to. The room was lovely very comfortable although our ""queen size bed was actually two twin bed pushed together not very comfortable if you want to cuddle! The food in the restaurant was very good indeed..with very efficient waiting staff! WE ordered breakfast to the room, again  not a good move, poor portions and very poor value for the ‚Ç¨6 each charge to  have i delivered. One major tip, if you pay with a debit card, you must pay cash for EVERYTHING thereafter, BUT there is no ATM in the hotel and no cashback facilities, very awkward for those who chose not to use credit cards. All in all a bit disappointing. The big highlight for me was the Clancy brothers who were the entertainment that night, they were excellent and very nice people. They saved the visit!",3,2011,07,24
223,Really nice hotel,"This hotel is really nice and the staff very helpful and friendly.  The only criticism of the hotel was that we could not have the window open at night due to the fact that the extractor fans were near to us and the noise was very loud.  It was an executive room that we had and one would not expect this to happen.  Other than that, the view over the golf course was really great and the location of the hotel within easy reach of Dublin City whilst being in a country location.  The room was beautifully decorated and the en-suite was lovely with a separate bath and shower.  The complimentary toiletries were really nice.  There is a vast choice of food for breakfast and the waiting staff were very attentive.
We would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2011,07,23
223,Not worth it.,"When we arrived, the hallway was being painted on our floor, of which, we were not forewarned which was a serious mistake as my elderly mother is very allergic to paint fumes. That evening, we waited 20 minutes for two cocktails to be mixed in the lobby bar which were mediocre and overpriced at best. We decided to dine at The Park restaurant. The hostess was perplexed when we asked for a table and had to ask her manager for assistance in seating us (we were only three !!!). The steaks we ordered, the supposed house speciality, were tough, thin, dry and overcooked. The staff forgot the side orders as well. To top it off, the bus boy would randomly review needed cutlery during the service and the jacket my husband left behind on his chair was conveniently never found. The hotel is in the middle of nowhere as well making a trip into Dublin a chore. And the laughably bad band playing in the lobby could be heard in our room until midnight. An utter waste of a night.",1,2011,07,21
223,a very average hotel,"We stayed here for 1 night (July 12th) B&B with a 4 course dinner - I think the deal was Just for July.  On arrival we were very impressed with the grandeur in the lobby area - looked really modern and comfortable.  Receptionist was efficient but lacked personality.  We were early and had to wait for our room so we took a walk then returned to the hotel and lunch on the patio overlooking the golf course.  Our snack was just ok - quite overpriced for a sandwich and a toastie. When our room was ready we had what felt like a mile hike to our room which was at the end of a long long corridor.  The room was fine - clean and well equipped.  Bathroom was ok too, towels were a bit thin though. Shower cubicle could do with a hook for your towel just outside it!  We had a four course dinner included in our deal. When went to the restaurant we were abandoned at the table and no drink order was taken, by the time I got the attention of a waiter we'd been sitting for 10 mins.  we could have ordered from either the restaurant or the bistro menu - but we discovered our deal included 20euro each for our meal - the restaurant menu had no main courses under 20euro we opted for the bistro.  How disappointing considering this hotel has 2 ""rosettes"" for excellent food.  Starters were salad - nearly a whole loaf of white pan loaf croutons and a tomato and mozzerella salad which just about passed the test!  Main course of supreme of chicken stuffed with cream cheese and sundried tomatoes was extremely disappointing.  Chicken was  slightly overcooked and it was stuffed with garlic philly cheese no trace of tomatoes and the accompanying basil infused risotto appeared to be stodgy cheesy/herby rice. It was just edible. My partner ordered sea trout with carmelised onion mash and a almond and prawn cream. Such an odd combination.  Turned out the mash was mashed potatoes with onions drenched in balsamic perched on top.  The sauce was just cream with teeny prawns and chopped almonds floating in it.  I did suggest a complaint should be made but neither of us knew what else we wanted to eat of the limited bistro menu so we ate what we could and looked forward to pudding - my partner did mentiion the carmalised onion mash was disappointing - waitress said she'd tell the chef.   So, the pudding....  3 of the puddings on the menu had ran out.  I was given the option to have an apple slice - bitter apples on bizarre sponge - like a bad supermarket offering.  My partners chocolate brownie looked good but it turned out it was stale!!!!  Outside was hard like it had been left to the elements and inside was dry.  We complained to the waitress but she shrugged and said she'd tell the chef - she offered another pudding but seeing there were no puddings left there was no point.

apart from the disppointing dinner we had a good comfortable nights sleep and my partner enjoyed the gym the next morning.

and so we anticipated breakfast.  Now there are warnings in the hotel that breakfast is most tranquil between 7 and 8am but being on a mini break we wanted a lie in.  Oh dear.  Breakfast room was like a zoo.  300 rooms worth of adults and children flitting about round the hot buffet and the toaster. There was plenty of everthing and the hot food was hot and fresh but very disorganised trying to dodge children with a hot plate in your hand is dicey.  A waiter bringing toast to the table would be a better practice to adopt.  Not to mention men golfers absent mindedly queuing up the wrong way and blocking the entrance to the breakfast room.  We regretted not taking our plates to the patio for a calm and tranquil outdoor breakfast!!!

We checked out very soon after breakfast.  The receptionist listened to our concerns about our dinner the previous night - she said we could speak to the Food & Beverage Manager but to be honest we didn't know what this would achieve.  The receptionist put a note on our file to give us an upgrade if we book again.   

To conclude it  was nice to be offered the upgrade. We had a comfortable nights stay and we didn't starve. The hotel served its purpose for the night but we will not return.",3,2011,07,18
223,Its the little things.,Myself and wife spent  the night here just as an anniversary treat due to work commitments we had to cancel a weekend in the Hudson bay hotel Athlone. And to be honest in a way we were glad we did. for a four course meal and breakfast at 99euro per couple you couldn't fault this hotel. the staff are friendly and efficiency the public toilets are spotless ( people do notice these things )  the menu is a little sparse but that said its made for a package so you get what you pay for but the food is on the mark. Its a little difficult depending were your room is trying to access ice or vending machines as your room key only operate the lift to the floor you stay on and the door leading to your hallway so you might have to contact reception for a one off key like we did if you need anything but security is security to me it all seemed a little restrictive but for a purpose I'm sure. The room like most hotel rooms standard layout clean and has all you need problems again for me sleeping for me the room was very warm althoe unlike the Sheraton Bratislava at least you could open the window. never got to use the pool ect or take advantage of the spa packages on offer very well priced maybe next time.  so in a nut shell if its a golf trip ( sorry forgot to mention the golf course one of the best i have seen in a long time ) or a romantic break then i don't think you could do better and thats it.,4,2011,07,18
223,Wonderful Hotel,"My family all stayed here for a big family birthday celebration last week and it was a wonderful stay.
The hotel is fantastic, the service in every area of the hotel was really efficient and friendly.  The rooms were clean and comfortable.

The kids loved the leisure centre and the little playground.  The playground was ideal placed for the adults to sit and relax in the sun and let the kids play.
The food was excellent too.

Overall a brilliant stay and we would love to come again some time!",5,2011,07,15
223,Best hotel in Ireland,"I can't recommend this hotel enough. Rooms are very spacious with a luxurious bathroom.

Hotel is very modern with a great bar. Breakfast is amazing and there is everything you could want... Homemade bread, fry up, fresh fruit, cereal etc.

Hotel is in a great location with Blanchardstown shopping centre 5 minutes away.

Andrew and Leona have been very helpful anytime we have stayed.  Can't wait to go back down soon.",5,2011,06,30
223,really LOVE this place!,"I stayed in the Castleknock for the first time in march 2010 and have been back so many times since,we even had our wedding reception there in April and i can not recommend it highly enough,the rooms are spotless and really big with a gorgeous bathroom and pressure shower,the food is excellent and the grounds around it are breath taking but the biggest seller to this hotel is the staff,they make it so warm and friendly and nothing is too much hassle for them to do,they always have fantastic offers so its easy to treat yourself to a night away in luxury!! im going back in July and i cant wait!!",5,2011,06,26
223,CASTLEknock hotel fit for a king and queen!!,"I have stayed in the castleknock hotel & country club on many occasions over the last year, weather it's a night out with the girls or a romantic night away with the boyfriend the hotel has always been perfect for me.. As soon as you arrive you are greeted with a friendly smile and a quick check in. The rooms are all fabulous, with all the usual things: comfy bed, tv, iPod docking station, kettle, safe, lovely bathroom (nice powerful shower), and some lovely miniture shower gels, shampoos and creams! The rooms are only made more fabulous with the gorgeous view of the excellent golf course right outside the window! If your in the mood for some dinner and drinks then the hotel bar and restaurant are brilliant. Good service and value for money, even the bar food is excellent standard. Moving onto a few cocktails order at the bar or from one of the many staff around and the bartender will come to your table and pour it right in front of you!! The staff can't do enough for you at this hotel and there is no request too big or small! It's the little touches that make this hotel so special a happy birthday balloon and mini cake on arrival in our room made the night even more special!! The entertainment in the bar is great with a variety of bands helping the night along! I would recommend this hotel to everybody weather your looking for a Girly night, a romantic getaway or a little break with the family, castleknock hotel caters for everyone!!

223,Simply the Best,"I stayed here in May, for the 3rd or 4th time. I just love this hotel. From the moment you arrive you are well looked after. The service is 2nd to none. The rooms, the food, the location, the leisure centre all combine to make this hotel a fantastic place to visit. Ideal for couples, families and groups of friends. Perfect for a spa or golfing break. Can't compliment this place enough. Can't wait to go back.",5,2011,06,21
223,Fab Hotel,"we had a wonderful stay at this top class hotel. i usually don't sleep well when away from home, but they have king koil mattresses...same as ours, so had a wonderful sleep! spotless clean rooms / bathrooms. The evening meal was really good, we went for the early bird menu, excellent & friendly service at this hotel. My only negative is that the  buffet breakfast was not really warm.",5,2011,06,18
223,"Average hotel, no value for money","My friends arranged their wedding afters in this hotel for the Irish June bank holiday weekend, so most of us decided to stay for the night.  I attempted to book a regular double room in April, priced just under 100 euro were unfortunately booked out.  I know this price for the night as I went online to book with no success, and then I called in case there was something Reservations could do for us.  There was nothing they could do, and I ended up booking the next price level up, which was an Executive double room costing around 220 for that one night.  The hotel was modern and rather average, there was nothing overly negative about it, until much later on in the evening, when I saw a friend of mine's regular double room.  To our astonishment, it looked the same as ours, in size, in decor, etc.  
***The only difference our so-called Executive double room had was the extra 100 euro price tag, a set of rough bathrobes, a cheap set of slippers, an outdated DVD player and a hair straightener that still had the previous guest's hair stuck to it.***  
I have sent a mail to the hotel with this complaint and a kind and polite Director of Sales and Marketing person got back to me promptly.   Unfortunately, he couldn't properly explain to me why we had to pay over an extra ‚Ç¨100 for the above mentioned useless commodities.   The only explanation he had given me is the business text book 'Supply-Demand phrase - where on other days the room would cost cheaper when they're not busy.  And that if i wasn't happy with the price I could have gone elsewhere.'  (Which I would have if I had known in advance what a rip off this hotel was) This still does not explain the huge price difference between a regular and an 'executive' room.  

All in all, my advice is, if you see a price tag for a room for this hotel, but it's booked out and you are offered the so called Executive room, just simply go to another hotel.",3,2011,06,15
223,"Nice relaxing break,","Stayed here with and totally enjoyed the weekend break,from the moment we checked in at reception until check out everything was just great,The hotel has a nice big foyer and relaxing area,we ate in the PARK restaurant and thought that the meal was great and was very good value for money,this hotel also has a kids play ground out the back to keep the litte ones happy, only critism is the fact that you have to walk through the foyer to get to the spa.",4,2011,06,14
223,Fantastic Hotel,Stayed at this hotel for 4 nights and had a fantastic time. Very helpful staff and superb food in the restaurant. Lovely spacious room and set it lovely grounds. Will definately return x,5,2011,06,13
223,nothing spectacular but can't fault,"This hotel appears to be a cletic tiger inspired construction with a golf course and some luxury homes on site.  There aren't any gardens to walk around and casual walkers or runners aren't allowed on the golt course.  There is a big car park with lots of free parking.  
Check in was swift and pleasant - they hotel have a policy that they don't do complimentary upgrades so don't even ask.  The rooms are functional and practical with all the necessities.  There is not a great choice of tv stations and there is no pay tv.  There is a safe and tea and coffee making facilities.  There is no mini bar.  
The bathroom was spacious with bath and seperate walk in shower unit.  
The spa is reasonably priced but not the best spa I was ever in.  I had a massage and a manicure and felt both were a little rushed but I enjoyed all the same.  The girls were very pleasant.
I thoroughly enjoed the food and felt both the dinner and breakfast menus were extensive and tasty.
The castleknock hotel and country club is definately not plush by any means but certainly it is hard to find fault with it.
Would I go back for a night or 2 mini getaway - Yes !",4,2011,06,11
223,Disappointing Stay,"Stayed here with my wife and 2 young children. We had a disappointing stay overall. Leisure centre was lovely and very quite during our stay even though the hotel was busy. Room was very small, old fashioned, and only had a small TV. We were looking forward to a relaxing weekend break with the kids. We found that the hotel was packed on the Saturday with people drinking all day. The childrens playground was too small and while we were there it was occupied by big kids throwing stones at other children. We had a meal included in our package and found the choice in the restaurant to be very poor. Would not recommend this hotel at weekends for families with young children as lobby and bar area can be quite rough.",2,2011,06,08
223,Luxury accomodation and comfort,Satyed here twice in October 2010 to attend training courses. Lovely modern clean Hotel rooms and friendly approachable staff. All in all a very pleasent stay.,5,2011,05,31
223,Living like a princess in Castleknock,"I had just spent 3 nights in a hostel and was ready to get spoiled a bit. I had my birthday coming up so I decided to give myself a gift, 2 nights at Castleknock. But i wished I had a third.

I took buss nr 73 from Dublin, it took about 15 min and the bus driver was very nice to let me off at the nearest stop. Next to a rundabout there was a path going into some woods through a resident area. It was not at all shady, more like a path into the secret garden. With houses on your left an a wall on you right, there was one place you could peek over the wall and I saw cows grassing. Yes, very gangster indeed. I reached a small gate and down to a road, I crossed it and turned to the left and from here I could see Castleknock. 

The check in was painless and I went up to my room, the elevators need to key card to function. So does the electricity in the room as well, (took me a bit to find that out. haha)
I just spent the day in my room, there was free coffe and tea. A television, a lovely bath room with seperate bath and shower. I had been shopping at Lush in Dublin for this occasion, and had a lovely bubbly time in the tub. The view was facing the recycle area, but who says you have to look downwards. I watched some late night movies on the TV and slept lovely. I slept inn in the morning and had the chambermaids knocking on my door, I let them in and they asked if I needed room service, they cleaned the bathroom fast, efficient and friendly. I asked them about the shopping mall and they recommended it to me, so I just got on bus nr 73 again and off I went on a shopping spree. 

Didnt return until 19:00, I had to return because I had ordered a spraytan session in the Tonic spa at 20:00. But when I arrived there they couldnt find my reservation, the guy at the desk said they could take do me in about 5 minutes. I had hoped to get some time to exfoliate before the session, but I just had to jump right into it. I sat in the relaxation room all alone in about 15 min, before I peeked out the door in the hall and saw a girl from the staff. She was on the phone confirming my session and came in later. It was my first time with this full body spray tan, but she was natural and helped me relax and feel cared for. I got some slippers to pop on and went back to my room. 

Being all tanned up ment I could not use the tub, pool or the whirlpool. But after a few hours I got dressed up and went downstairs to check out the bar. Before this a guy from the reception helped me with finding the hotels computers so I could print out my flight tickets. ( I had accedently thrown them in the garbage that morning). Didnt like the high cost of internet use and printing fees, I used all my bus fares. But the guy was very helpfull giving directions. 
Later I split a fiver in the bar so I had some change again. 

The bartender lady was awsome and in addition to serve me rocking drinks she also gave me directions and tips to my return travel the morning after. I met some nice people in the bar, there was some entertainment (inside joke). And after a few I returned to my room to catch some z`s. I had to get up early in the morning so I couldnt really let it loose. 

I stayed at a great price 108‚Ç¨ for to night breakfast not included. But it was no problem, if you dont want to ride into town or to the shopping mall there is a SPAR a couple of hundred meters from the busstop. But the resturant has also a great menu.

I wished I had the chance to try the pool and the whirlpool, I should have had one more night.
But that will be another time, I hope!  I will always remember Castleknock.

P.S On the train to the bus station I left my camera behind, I had mentioned to the lady next to me that I had stayed at Castleknock. She called them and they called me, giving me her number so that we could get in touch. The Irish are truely great people!

Thank you!",4,2011,05,30
223,lovely grounds,stayed here for 2 nights. receptionist was very informative. room was spotless. breakfast was plentiful.,4,2011,05,28
223,Service needs fine tuning,"I was here for a very brief visit recently. It was approximately 15:10 when we arrived and after looking around for quite some time at the menus of the restaurant (which had just been closed, to our dismay! We had been informed over the phone by the receptionist that it would be open when we arrived at 15:00!). So we sat in the lobby for about 15 minutes reading the menu before a member of staff approached us, a very polite and courteous young man who returned a number of times throughout the meal to check up on us although he did appear to be under some pressure. We availed of the bar food menu. The food was quite pleasant overall.

I visited the bar a number of times to fetch drinks as there did not appear to be much staff on. When there were 4 members of staff who appeared to be tripping over one another at the coffee machine and at the cash register while nobody tended to the rest of the floor. It did not give a great impression. There was a small tour in the bar at the time but there didn't seem to be much else happening for there to having been such confusion behind a relatively small bar at a non-peak time during the day. When I was served there did not appear to be an overly positive attitude from the staff.  Service speed could also have done with a bit of fine tuning.

Overall our experience was good but could have been made better. Seeing tables that were not bussed and crumbs on tabletops was not very nice.",3,2011,05,21
223,not for a wedding,"Hi justed stayed here for a wedding and would not reccommed it.It was like Huston station all day with people coming and going for competitions.The food for the wedding was cold,the dinner was like pub grub ,turkey and ham with awful potatoes.The money spent was terrible for this hotel and would advise anyone thinking of going there for their wedding to try out the food,also they had no non alcoholic drink on the sunday and no pringles for the kids and when we ordered bar food from the menu we were told no dinners till 5.00pm that was burgers,chicken,platers and when the toasted sandwichs come out they were cold and so was the tea and they were not happy to heat it up again ,so would never go back.Lovely rooms but staff not helpful.from a very well travelled woman",3,2011,05,18
223,"Poor location, very expensive, conflicting advice from Receptionists.","I stayed at hotel for 3 nights with my Mother for her 60th birthday but certainly won't be returning.  The room was very nice, typical twin bedroom but very clean.  The first night we overlooked the kitchen bins and the kitchen fan which was very noisy practically all night.  The rooms are not air conditioned so the windows had to be opened as very warm in rooms.  The fan could be heard operating until early hours then switched off for about 2 hours before restarting.  When you eventually fall asleep the kitchen staff then decide to move wheelie bins full of glass bottles and have converstaions into the early hours below your bedroom window.  Then they decide to move beer barrals at 4.20am, whereby waking many rooms up needlessly.  We were moved for the next 2 nights but could still hear the kitchen fans buzzing day and night.  Reception & bars were overtaken by wedding parties on 2 of the 3 nights we were there and on the third evening reception was over taken by a christening.  The main bar had notices up 'private party' so we were unable to visit the bar once during our 3 night stay.  Food and drink incredibly expensive so ate in room as too far to walk anywhere.  Defo' needed a car, hotel much too remote without a car.  Did not see one bus during our stay so ended up resorting to taxi's which made our trip very expensive.  Bland hotel and sometimes unhelpful reception staff who gave conflicting advice, ie Dublin town 5 minutes drive??? More like good 20 minutes.  Enjoyed spending time with my Mother, liked Dublin but would not return to this hotel.",2,2011,05,09
223,Excellent Hotel.,"Stayed for 3 nights in hotel with my wife and 1 year old. Would highly recommend te hotel for both families and couples looking for a get away. Hotel is set up so that families eat in one room and couples in another. It means that if you have kids you are not worried about them making noise and disrupting other people. Facilities are excellent, lovely outdoor area with a playground and also a nice pool. Food was excellent and choice of eating in restaurant or from all day bar menu.",5,2011,04,26
223,Wonderful Staff and Wonderful Hotel,"Stayed at this hotel last Thursday night as part of my first anniversary celebrations.I may be a bit biased as I also had my wedding reception here but I have yet to find a hotel anywhere where so many of their staff are so friendly and helpful. A lot of other establisments would do well to take note. Anyway We were given a room upgrade on arrival with some wonderful treats thrown in aswell as a card from the staff. We ate in the Park restaurant and the food really is superb,No complaints.Leisure facilities are top notch also. Special mention for Dearbhla,Leona,Andrew,Fiona and Maria. Great night was had and Tina and Myself are already planning a return only much sooner rather than later",5,2011,04,19
223,A good choice,"Coming across from GB by car we thought an out of town location would be easier than a city centre hotel. We felt we were also getting good value for money deal at a rate of ‚Ç¨70 per night. 

We had some difficulty finding the place. Despite its postal address it is not on Portersfield Road! 

Our room was spacious and well equipped. Our only problem was that it was too hot, despite our turning off the radiator. 

Because the excellent Anglers Rest was so close we did not use the Hotel Restaurant for anything other than Continental Breakfast. We found the (foreign) staff pleasant and efficient even though on our first day the breakfast room was very full. 

Reception staff were friendly and eager to help. 

A little map showing the hotels location and its surroundings would be useful. 

We would certainly use this hotel again on future visits to Dublin provided we had a car available.",5,2011,04,18
223,"Cracking hotel, great staff and service, a wonderful place to stay and relax","Super hotel , breakfast and dinner I have to say top marks to the chef !
Massage was fab too 
Rooms are class . Inside and out this hotel is in the top 3 hotels I've stayed in , in the country .
Faultless !
Maybe reduce the price of the pint though !!",5,2011,04,08
223,very pampered,"From the moment I walked in I felt at home. My room wasn't ready (I was early) but the receptionist took my number and promised to call as soon as I could use the room. I'd just stepped outside to get some fresh air and I got a call to say I could go up to my room. I was impressed and pleased that I could get on with my stay. The spa, pool and gym were very clean-although take a swimming cap other wise you can't use the pool. It is used by non residents so post school hours the pool was busy with children. Breakfast was great and again the staff were very helpful and friendly. The food was of a high standard and there was plenty of it.

It is someway out of Dublin but there is a bus which goes into town-about a ten minute walk from the hotel. The location isn't the best if you want the 'Dublin experience' but it's a lovely, quiet, relaxing hotel only half an hour away from the sights.

The staff couldn't be more helpful and I had a lovely two nights here-thank you!",5,2011,03,31
223,Great hotel would recommend,"Arrived at the hotel and the staff on reception very helpful rang to check if room was ready she said it would be a few minutes.  She kept bags until room was ready only had to wait a few minutes.  Room was spacious and very clean, plenty of room for the travel cot unlike some hotel rooms.  Only problem was the room was very hot.  Our night included dinner in the restaurant where the staff couldn't have been more helpful especially adrienska and she made sure to speak to our baby girl.  Service was quick and food was lovely complients to the chef.  Breakfast was also lovely although could have been slightly warmer.  I would recommended this hotel to anyone and will definitely visit again.  One of the best hotels I have stayed in in Dublin.",5,2011,03,24
223,ruined my mothers 70th birthday,"We booked this hotel to celebrate my mums 70th birthday.  We booked into the hotel with two families. Mine with three children and my brother with his two and his pregnant wife.  We flew over from the uk and collected my mum.  Booking in was quick and easy and the girls on the dest were lovely.  However this was the only lovely part to our stay.
On the friday night we were kept up all night with a works party.  To the point that my husband had to ask two adults who were ""making out"" outside our room to please move on as my 6 year old was getting upset.  This was the start of a very very long night of noise and partying.  We had asked for rooms next to each other but were about 3 rooms apart which meant that myself and my husband split up in the rooms as we didnt want the boys on their own.  At 4am I  opened the door and asked the people running up and down the hallway outside the room to please go to bed.  Finally at 6am we got to sleep.  My mum was in tears at breakfast.  I spoke to a girl in reception and she agreed to move us closer to each other and that there would not be a repeat performance.  She assured us that there would be no loud music and that security would put a stop to the noise at night.  As we had rang several times to security on the friday without anyone answering I was taking this with a pinch of salt.
We had dinner in the hotel that night.  It was average and the service was terrible, Trying to get served by one of the waiters was a lottery!! No idea if they were understaffed but its not great  I was wishing by now we had just packed up and gone to my mums. But we were stuck there as it had snowed.
That night was just as bad - we had to ring security to come and break up a party in the room next door which thankfully they did.  The music went on till all hours in the morning and the screaming and shouting outside was horrific.
The next morning my mum was again in tears and my sister in law was so tired I thought she was going to pass out!! Two nights lack of sleep was catching up with us all.
One of the duty managers asked if everything was ok and we told him no it wasnt.  Myself and my brother went to speak to him.  He dealt with it in good way and knocked off a nights stay.  However - this was not going to make up for the fact we all had a horrific stay and it ruined my mums birthday.  i was really really upset and to be honest this was sad for us as your mum only turns 70 once. 
We travel back every few months and this hotel was a great location for us.  But this experience had made us never want to return. What a shame as the hotel is lovely in location and decoration however it lets itself down with the behaviour at night and if this is the way they run a hotel of this standard its very sad.",1,2011,03,20
223,Exceeded Expectations!!,"Myself and my wife recently spent a night here on a Valentine's special offer weekend. The rate included one night b&b in an upgraded room, rose petals on the bed, a bottle of wine in the room and dinner in the Park restaurant (which is the fancy option) all for ‚Ç¨216. We had stayed in Carton House last Valentines for almost double the price and were bitterly disappointed with the service and bad attitude of the staff and a lot of what our deal was to have included was left out along with a feeling that the room we were given was not up to scratch! Anyway due to this we were fairly dubious about what kind of experience we were going to have. Well we needn't have worried one bit. The room was lovely with the petals sprinkled as promised and a bottle of Chardonnay in an ice bucket all ready to go. We don't enjoy Chardonnay as much as the other varieties so when we were on our way down to lunch we stopped into reception to see if their was any possibility of an alternative, not expecting there would be.... well the manager couldn't have been nicer she asked what we would prefer, went and got it and swapped the bottle in the room for us so we didn't have to bring it back up ourselves. We had a delicious lunch and a nice chillout with a great vibe running through the place. Dinner later in the Park was absolutely divine, and my wife was presented with a rose when we arrived which was a lovely touch. We then strolled out to the bar area were there was still a great vibe around (which was around 9.30pm), we had a little stroll to find somewhere to sit but that's the price for the good atmosphere which we didn't mind and as we sat down a trad band started up. They were really good and we honestly felt like we were on our hols a million mile from home even though we were only a short distance from home and staying breifly!!! All in all we were delighted with our stay and will definately be returning and recommending to others. Well done Castleknock Hotel and Country Club!!!",5,2011,02,20
223,"Fantastic, thoroughly recomend this hotel,","I took my husband there for a birthday surprise. We were upgraded to an executive room, which had a lot of little extras. The staff and service was particulary fantastic.The food was amazing. For the deal we got at ‚Ç¨59 pps for BB/evening meal,it was all very romantic. We were made feel very special. Would definitely go again. And certainly recomend",5,2011,02,08
223,Lovely relaxing break,"Top marks for this hotel.  The staff at reception were friendly and efficient.  The room (executive double) was furnished to a lovely standard with a separate bath and shower (always a bonus).  The gym isn't massive - but has all the equipment you need for a workout, so no complaints there.

We had a lovely meal in the Park restaurant, again with excellent service from the staff.

I would recommend this hotel for an adults only break - they seem to have quite a strict policy re children (with signs in the reception/restaurant/bar area stating children must be seated at ALL times).

Excellent location - situated near Blanchardstown shopping centre / and approximately 2km from the M50 Dublin by-pass.

All in all a lovely break - I would definitely go back.",5,2011,01,30
223,Very nice hotel,"I only booked one night at the hotel at first, but after the day i found it quite nice so at midnight I went to the reception and asked to stay another night, which turned out to be a good decision. Was meeting up with friends in town and partying , never went down for breakfast, but had breakfast in the room during my stay, food was ok. Bar staff is very helpful and friendly which I think is the best part of my stay. Only one thing during my stay made me a little bit uncomfortable, when I went to reception asking to stay another night, the staff told me to come down the next morning and then I could have it done, so I said I probably will sleep the day , could you not do it for me now?he said nothing but was giving me a weird and unpleasant look, he did do it for me eventually but he didn't even say anything to me when I said thank you when I was leaving. Anyway, i would still recommend the hotel to a friend and would come back again, just thought great customer care can always be impressive to customer and a reason to bring pol back.",4,2011,01,15
223,My Hubby will always remember his 50th Birthday....,"We stayed in Castleknock from 6th to 9th January 2011, and could not fault the hotel in any way. Two friends flew over from the UK and stayed too, and one of them asked for an upgraded room for us which we didnt know about until we arrived. The suite was fab, swans moulded from towels on the bed, gowns, slippers, 2 TVs, sofa , huge bed, chairs loads of space :), and some fruit and chocs left with a note from management. Better than our honeymoon suite albeit 30 years ago !!!
The hotel was spotless, staff friendly and very helpful, nothing too much trouble for them.
We had dinner in The Park, and it was first class, service from Albert our waiter second to none.
My husband and friends had spa treatments booked ( i cant have them due to illness) and said they were so very relaxing . The pool etc were scrupulously clean, and staff there very friendly and helpful too.
What I also liked to see were the little notices on the tables in the bar asking guests to 
 keep their children seated at all times, to be honest I don't think children should be in a bar after about 7pm....and we have 3 of our own so it's not that I am anti-children.There was a young family staying there with 4 children and they were so well behaved and all under about age 10 !!
The Hotel has standards which they would like guests to adhere to, and in my mind that is a good thing.
We hope to do a return visit later in the year again and would recommend it to others without hesitation.",5,2011,01,12
223,Do not get married here no matter what they say,"Point blank refused to serve drink in the residents Bar to Residents. Apparently while the law states hotels must serve 24 hours a day & I quote the manager ""it is hotel policy to close the residents bar at 3 a.m. Sharp"". When booking you will be promised a full residents bar.
At your reception when the band starts you get provided with a grim faced BOUNCER to stand at the dancefloor taking ladies off the floor if they have no shoes on. Apparently it's ""Policy"" which is fair enough but it is done by an ignoramus with no manners who will annoy & antagonise most people.
Be warned potential brides they will lie through their teeth to get you in",1,2011,01,08
223,Nice hotel,"We stayed in the castleknock hotel for two nights and I had booked dinner bed and breakfast for both nights for a romantic break. Check in was quick and we were greeted by a very nice lady who arranged dinner and explained how the lifts work etc. We were given an upgrade to an executive room. The room was very clean with a large bed (in fact it was two large single beds pushed together, that in itself is not uncommon, but well it was a bit uncomfortable) .The tv was small but there was an ipod docking station which was a touch. Two sets of bath robes and slippers were also provided. The bath room was again clean with a bath, separate shower (with great water pressure) There were lovely shampoos and conditioners. 
The dinner was grand, and I must say the dining room staff were excellent, nothing was too much for them. They made the evening. For dessert we both enjoyed the winter berry slice with fresh cream was to die for.
Breakfast was very typical of modern hotels, self service with ample choice. (You may have to ask for toast)
We also tried the swimming pool which was grand.
In my view the only grip I have is on check out as the clerk announced loudly my bill and this was heard by my partner (she was standing some distance away). I would have rather that she didn‚Äôt hear. Perhaps going forward the hotel could print out your bill and ask is the figure correct as printed and then process the charge.
 We enjoyed the hotel and in all but one aspect the hotel is well run the waiting staff are excellent,, oh I nearly forgot to mention that the cleaning staff in the hallways were very polite and courteous. We will come back to this hotel.",4,2011,01,04
223,A great friendly place for food drink and relaxing,Myself my partner and son stayed with the hotel for new years eve and the hotel was really busy. They had a wedding going on and what seemed to be a full house. But when it came to service they were on the ball. We were seated on time for our meal in the restaurant and the food was out of this world with excellent service the rooms are a nice size with excellent facilities and the whole atmosphere of the night was wonderful. I cant wait to stay again,5,2011,01,04
223,Pleasantly Surprised,"We spent a very restful and enjoyable night here.  The service was excellent, especially the wait staff at dinner, and the hotel was very clean.  We availed of a deal that included dinner and breakfast and a bottle of wine in our room.  The food was very good; much better than what one normally gets in a hotel.  There was a large wedding going on the night of our stay, and a group there for a wedding the following night, but the hotel was large enough that this didn't impinge on our enjoyment.  Overall I think the Castleknock Hotel is better than other four star hotels I've stayed in in Ireland.",5,2011,01,01
223,brilliant - would definitely go back,"Just back from a two night stay in the hotel which was brilliant.  from the moment we arrived it was perfect.  The receptionist (Elaine) was so efficient and friendly.  We had a light snack which was excellent and very good value for money.  Our room was beautiful, warm and inviting and spotless.   We had dinner included with our package which we had in the lovely park restaurant and the food was excellent.  Staff again extremely helpful and friendly without intruding.  All in all a great stay most definitely will be returning.  Everybody was so friendly.  And great music on Sunday evening.

S Keegan",5,2010,12,21
223,Stay here!,"Well, I'm on day 3 of a five stay stay here on business and I must say, I would certainly come back. The conference room and servicing of it is impressive, the rooms, the food, the gym, pool, Christmas deco, staff are all flawless. I got a great deal on booking.com and I will certainly be coming back if I've got anything on in west Dublin again.",5,2010,11,30
223,Alarmingly Poor in many ways.,"Room was basic with an adjoining door - not what you want in a 4 star hotel!

TV is small and in 4:3 ratio, so not widescreen. Also is very small. Basic bathroom and toilet paper is very poor standard. Cost cutting I would imagine.

Bar and Restaurant - did not enjoy our meal in the restaurant as it was very loud and noisy. We seemed to be sitting in middle of an early Christmas party night. Off putting to say the least. The restaurant only allows you ‚Ç¨20 off the A la Carte menu if you choose it. That says it all really. My wife tried to order a starter from the A la Carte and main from the Table d'Hote, but was told she could not. I said we would pay the ‚Ç¨9 extra for the starter but the waitress was adamant that this ""was not allowed"". Staggering, for a 4 star hotel.

Afterwards, we retreated to the bar and I ordered a Guinness and a Strawberry Daiquari. Waitress poured the Guinness and returned about 8 minutes later with the other drink, and proceeded to top up the Guinness. Not what you're supposed to do with GUinness. I asked for a fresh pint and got it.

Breakfast was OK - although I would like to know the meat vs fat content of their pudding and sausages. Both seemed VERY fatty and not a lot of actual meat in them.

We had some drinks in the bar that evening and I got a packet of Dry Roasted peanuts. The nuts were out of date by a couple of weeks. 

Bar food was just OK - far from 4 star standard.

That night we saw a Security Guard patrolling the corridors and actually heard him threaten someone that he would call the Gardai if he did not ""leave now"". What sort of 4 star hotel needs a security guard patrolling the corridors?

Also had to bang the walls of the adjoining room at 4.30am as they turned the TV on VERY loud.

Checked out and will not be back!

This hotel is 4 star - but is really just a good 3 star. Carton House is nearby, as is Dunboyne Castle - both also 4 star but way superior in every way.",1,2010,11,29
223,Nice room but poor breakfast,"Stayed here for one night last week .Availed of the 59 euro pp dinner/bd and breakfast offer with free wine in bedroom.Room was executive type very spacious and clean. Dinner was in the  posh restaurant and there was a choice of upgrading to the a la carte menu. We stuck with table dhote and the meal was very good with excellent service. We availed of the pool and sauna, again excellent.
Breakfast was served in the brasserie restaurant and was a self serve buffet. At 9 am the fried eggs had gone hard and seemed to be sitting for too long. The bacon was extremely salty. I believe with a little effort the breakfast could be improved.",3,2010,11,23
223,Would definitely stay again,"I loved this hotel, from the inside and out its really nice. The rooms are very spacious and comfortable. The food was nice and the staff were friendly & helpful.
Had spa treatments...bit odd that they are in hotel rooms and not proper beauty treatment rooms but was enjoyable.
Didn't use pool but looks fab and gym is handy.
Only bad point...there was a private party in the bar so we couldn't go in until the other bar closed, so we missed the music. Not much entertainment...Dublin city bit far and castleknock village is a few minutes drive away.
Blanchardstown shopping centre is also near by car.",4,2010,11,21
223,"Very, very nice hotel.","I took my girlfriend to Castleknock Golf & Country Club for a 2-night stay only a few days ago and had a very enjoyable experience indeed.
On arrival, we experienced a quick and efficient check-in, and made our way to the first floor to our room.  The original deal that I had got encorporated having an excetutive room - subject to availability - but unfortunately this was only available for one night, so I decided to opt for the late check-out of 3pm.
The room which we got was really nice; it was very spacious, clean, modern and tastefully decorated. The bathroom, although not huge, was again very clean and included some really nice shower gel & soaps.  We poured ourselves a glass of the complimentary wine before going to explore some more of this impressive hotel.
That evening we went to dinner for the 4-course meal that was inclusive in the package that we had got. We had booked at the hotel reception when we arrived, but upon discussion, thought we might change to an earlier time. Unfortunately, however, it took us at least half a dozen times to get through to the reception when ringing from our hotel room. I am not sure what was going on with that !!  Anyway, the standard of the food in the hotel was very good. We did have some botheration with our main meals as we were told that the special was pork chops, although when they arrived they were lamb chops! They did, however, exchange these for the steaks without the additional 6-50 Euro surcharge, which was kind of them. The steaks that we had, incidently, really were good !!  They also kindly gave me ice-cream for dessert when I asked for it instead of anything from the menu. This was both presented very tastefully and was delicious!
Breakfast the following morning was good; good selection of English/Irish cooked breakfast, Continential selection and cereals & breads, etc. The food was good, although one or two of the staff could have done with being more attentive and perhaps tried to put a smile on their face!!
Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. The hotel really is nice, and in my opinion, is as nice as 5-star hotels that I have stayed in.  I feel that with better staff that they could really push for 5-star status.",4,2010,11,21
223,fab,stayed here for one night and couldn't fault it and thats from someone in the hospitality industry. A really relaxing break and great value for money,4,2010,11,20
223,"A fabulous hotel, one of my favourites.","Got a great offer - 119 euro for b&b with dinner and bottle of wine for the 2 of us. Hotel is really tastefully decorated, the bar and lobby very cosy and comfy. Dinner was lovely and the staff were so efficient and very pleasant. Breakfast was excellent with so much choice and even though it was very busy, we got seated and served quickly. Wish we could have stayed longer !",5,2010,11,20
223,fabulous hotel,"Myself and My Husband stayed here for 3 nites in Nov 2010 we had a brillant time and the standard in hotel 1st class, from the quality of rooms, the food, friendliness of staff we would highly recommend for anybody to stay at this hotel.",5,2010,11,10
223,Don't stay there!!!,"Hello We were staying in this hotel with my boyfriend few months ego. I was so unhappy with the quality of our stay. I wasn't happy with service and mostly wasn't happy about the spa. It is not a SPA. There is one room which is actually a hotel room. You have to run trough the corridor to actually move from room to the room. Bathroom in the relaxation room was horrible. Was so untidy, for example there was a lipstick on the clean glasses for water. I don't know how someone can call this spa. The person who design this place should just once go to the spa and see what is this. Anyway, I am planning to go to Ireland in few weeks. Decided today to have a look for other hotels in this area. As it is very popular I have checked the Facebook page for hotels in this area as often they have good offers on Facebook. Of course I decided to see Castleknock Hotel page and after that decided to write this review. I never saw anything that unproffessional on any website of any business. The comments are so unproffessional.  The look of page is horrible and the most imported thing I think it's only one hotel which mostly have a photos with the drunk worker. Actually drunk management as they proudly sign the photo. So before you decide to book a room in this hotel check them on Facebook as it will show you how poor is this place and think would you like your services to be provide by drunk workers. I don't think so. Good Luck",1,2010,11,08
223,we enjoyed our stay but it was marred by rowdy parties in rooms at 4am,"We went for the halloween weekend with our son & daughter-in-law & 2 young grandchildren. Our rooms were a few doors away from each other ,theirs a family room & ours a double. The rooms were clean & modern with an ensuite which had a bath & seperate shower.
On our 1st night we ate in the bistro restaurant as the set meal was included in our package. The meal was enjoyable & the service good considering the place was quite busy.
On our second day the children spent an hour in the pool & we took a trip to the zoo which was very handy to the hotel.
We had our meal on the 2nd night in the A La Carte restaurant. This was quite expensive but very good.The children were well looked after & the service generally was 1st class.
There was a halloween ball that night & the hotel was packed with revellers. Unfortunately during the night a lot of them decided to party in their rooms till the early hours. Our son & daughter-in-law were particularly bothered by young lads next door . They complained to reception 3 times but nothing was done. Needless to say they got very little sleep. We were woken by shouting in the corridor & someone knocking on our door in the early hours.
Next morning when checking out we said we were disappointed that nothing had been done about the noise. The receptionist said "" well is was halloween"". I pointed out it might have been a good idea to put people with young families in the same part of the hotel away from the party goers. This was met with a shrug.
Overall we enjoyed our stay but would not go back unless we could be guarenteed a quiet room .",3,2010,11,05
223,A little piece of heaven,"We checked into the hotel room early on thursday 28 October, our room wasn't ready yet so we had lunch. The receptionist on duty was one of the friendliest people I have ever met, she was so jolly and made us feel like so welcome. Our room was fabulous with a terrific view, robes slippers and wine provided were a lovely treat. Dinner that night and breakfast the next morning were super as were lesiure facilities. We can't wait to go back and had a truly wonderful time. My only fault was that I am coeliac and I found the lunch menu a bit difficult to order from , soups and gluten free bread might be an idea to have in store for future...other than that it was all fantastic",5,2010,11,01
223,would not go back,bedrooms very clean but smell from drain in shower / staff in bar area confused got wrong bill for 5 times the amount / dinningroom staff not very friendly / asked for an extra hour at checkout told it would cost an extra 50 euro / jacuzzi not working / I wont be back!,1,2010,10,26
223,fab hotel,"my husband and i stayed here for 2nights for our wed anniversary,very quick check ,lovely touch on arrival to our room a mini cake and card from the staff ,nice room but unfortunately opposite double doors leadind to all rooms on that floor and all night late revellers coming and going kept us awake all night...we tried ringing receptoin but no answer...but when we complained to reception next morning Ruth the receptionest was so nice and upgraded us to an executive suite on account of it been our anniversary..this room was fabulous and made up for the sleepless night,thankyou Ruth!...Pool area great with heated floors,very relaxing, just thought drinks quite expensive, entertainment great..hope to go back again",4,2010,10,17
223,Cheerless and Disappointing,"This is a cheerless modern hotel in nice countryside adjacent to the Dublin suburb of Castleknock.  When we arrived a sports game was blaring from screens in the lobby and the large open plan area covered in hard tiles did little to dull the sound of children running around.  The same TV screens high on the wall were 'pretend' fireplaces later in the evening (when there was live music) and by the next morning the screens had become aquaria - all a bit tacky.  

The day before our arrival my wife had telephoned to make a reservation for dinner and had found the person she spoke to off-putting and unhelpful.  Even in response to a specific question, no information was given about the restaurant options in the hotel.  On arrival we checked with the staff to find that our booking had been taking for a brasserie rather than the dining room.  We were told equally brusquely - to the point of disinterest and rudeness - that this was all that was on offer - take it or leave it  Thankfully the duty manager, who was most helpful, came to our rescue and looked after us with a table in the quieter restaurant.  He continued to be most attentive throughout our stay.

Our room was an executive room.  It's best feature was the bathroom and the view.  There was no air-conditioning which meant we had to have windows open, which meant that we could hear some plant operating at the rear of the hotel all night, so we did not get much sleep.

Breakfast was average.  I lifted three dirty cereal bowls from the stack of bowls before finding a clean one.  My wife had a similar experience with the fruit bowls.

All in all, this hotel sufficed for a night in which we needed to stay in that part of Dublin - but otherwise I don't think I would be choosing the hotel again.",3,2010,10,11
223,Flawless,My wife and I recently attanded a gala ball and stayed overnight in the Castleknock Hotel. From the moment we arrived we could feel the welcoming and relaxed atmosphere. The food and service were excellent.,5,2010,10,11
223,Stunning Hotel & great Value,"I stayed here for 3 nights at the end of September for my birthday and had a great weekend, got to the hotel late as got lost a bit trying to find it, in the end had to ring hotel and after advice we found our we were  5mins away,  The only downfall is the Hotel needs proper gps coordinates esp as the m50 has new signs & turn offs, which isn't really the hotel fault.

besides that, the hotel is great, when i got to room there was a birthday card, fruit & cake waiting for me compliments of management which i thought were very nice of them. The bar & lounge is lovely with very fast service for food and the breakfast was very tasty & no wait time during busiest  time in the morning
Had a massage at the spa & loved it, i found it very reasonable, the pool area is great too and clean. The outside is really nice and has a playground for kids and a wooden canopy with outside tv,
I would def recomend and il def wil stay next time i come to dublin",5,2010,10,10
223,Awfully difficult to find,"I stayed at this hotel for one night in September to overnight prior to driving down the country following a late flight .  Therefore, it was dark when I set out to find the hotel.  Based on the name of the hotel, I assumed it was in Castleknock but it isn't - where it actually is I still don't know!  I had great difficulty finding it that night and equally great difficulty finding my way to the M50 southbound next morning.  The hotel needs to provide a much better map than they currently do but they are still at the mercy of Ireland's appalling signposting systems.  As regards the hotel itself, it is impressive - especially outside.  Inside is quite nice also.  I don't know what the masterplan behind the hotel is given that it is on a large site with it's own golf course but it is not expensive and I felt that this was reflected by some of the clientele eg. a couple of very drunk young people who arrived back from somewhere while I was relaxing downstairs shortly after my arrival.  My point is, that it might attract a better class of client if the charges were higher but I guess in these desperate economic times, beggars and hotels can't be choosers!  There is free internet service in the rooms but mine wasn't working when I tried it.  The staff worked hard to get that problem sorted and did eventually.  The room was nice, the staff were helpful but it was very disappointing that there isn't room service late in the evening/at night.  Despite all of the above, I would recommend this hotel - if you can find it!",4,2010,10,08
223,excellent value,"my husband and i stayed in the castleknock hotel in september, the staff were brillent, the food second to none and the price of b&b, evening meal and wine waiting in room xcellent value for money. Will return again, hopefully very soon",5,2010,09,24
223,Only OK for us,"Stayed on a 3 night package deal, left after the second night.  Hotel is nice, clean good facilities.  We had a 16 month old baby with us and while staff were helpful food choices for the baby were not great at all.  In fact we were very disappointed with the food in general.  On package deal you can't pick from the full menu, there is a surcharge if you want steak (which i ordered but it was full of fat) which is rather poor in my opinion.

Hotel is OK but maybe not for kids a young as ours, older kids maybe.",3,2010,09,24
223,Really Nice,"Really nice hotel. near dublin , foods nice, rooms are very clean.",5,2010,09,04
223,HOSPITALITY SUCKED in BLANCHARDSTOWN / Castleknock?,"We stayed in the hotel at the weekend and I can only describe this place as a glorified concrete block. On arrival it was like a childrens playground, running recklessly around the lobby, my heart sank as i was looking forward to a relaxing break away with my partner. Checked in and went to our room which was adequate and was overlooking air conditioning units, not appealing to say the least. we returned to the lobby only to be bombarded with a herd of wedding guests which took over the whole lobby and seating area. We could not get served or attract anyones attention to take our order so we left and resided in the Golf Club. It was a pleasure to sit and relax in a quiet atmosphere. Staff were very attentive and proffessional. We were due to eat in the hotel restaurant but decided to stay and eat in Golf Club which was delightful. On our return we just thought we had entered what i can only describe as a nightclub.Boom, Boom, Boom. Suprise, Suprise Children . (We have children ourselves but they certainly would be supervised and most likly in Bed)  Is it not policy that children are not in a public bar after 9pm? We got a drink and sat for a few miinutes but due to the kids running around and the noise from the wedding band we retired to our room. I am very suprised that no management was seen to be around only BOUNCERS. This was a clear indication to us that the hotel must encounter a rough crowd. Following morning we waited in line for 15 minutes to get breakfast, it was not worth the wait. A bacon Mcmuffin from McDonalds would have been a treat. 

Overall we got a cheap rate but it was not worth it.",1,2010,08,29
223,worth a visit,Hotel was very impressive. Modern decor and very clean. Our room was compact but again stylish and clean. The bathroom had separate shower and bath. Kids had sofa bed but seemed comfortable. The staff were helpful and quite friendly. The food was excellent but kids menu was extremely limited. The leisure facilities were very good and clean. There was newly opened play area for kids which was small but they loved it as was opportunity to meet other kids and on nice evening adults could sit outside in very nice patio area near playground and kids were in full view. City center was only 15 minute drive away but hotel was surrounded by golf course which made it feel more rural. We visited Fort Lucan adventure park which was only few miles away and would recommended it for younger children. Our hotel package also included family outing to the zoo which was very enjoyable but need to get there early to get parked near.  We spent 5 days at Castleknock and hope to return again.,4,2010,08,24
223,Everything a hotel should be,"The staff at Castleknock leave no stone unturned to make sure your stay is a memorable one. All parts of the hotel are impeccably clean and the rooms are very comfortable. It's a bit removed from Dublin City centre, but with a good sized pool, spa and gym everything is at hand for a nice stay. I noticed they were adding a play area for kids beside the patio at rear. The food in the restaurant is really good especially if you favour steak. The meeting rooms are spacious and comfortable and the hotel is easily accessible from the M50 motorway.",5,2010,08,23
223,Poor shower and room facilities,"I stayed at this hotel with husband and 2 children aged 10 and 11 years.  When booking I was informed that there were no rooms with 2 double beds so ended up having to book an inter connecting room for kids at extra 60 euro per night.   When staying in this area we previously stayed at Clarion Liffey Valley where family rooms comprise of 1 double bed and 2 single beds at no extra cost!

Good Points:- 

The hotel staff are very friendly and helpful. Most staff were Irish.   
Food quite expensive but good quality
Rooms clean
Excellent pool in leisure facilities
Free car parking

Negative Points:-

No DVD player available for inter connecting room.  Useful when travelling with children.
No family rooms which can accommodate 2 adults & 2 children over 8 years.

No airconditioning in bedrooms.  Found both bedrooms extremely hot even with windows open and a fan. 

Poor water pressure in ensuite shower.

On both nights at the hotel there was loud music playing until 12.30 am directly below our bedrooms.  

Asked for well done steak in restaurant which was served chargrilled and burnt.  Tasted awful.  Complained but wasnt offered any discount etc.

Hotel is about 10 mins away from Blanchardstown Shopping Centre which has wide variety of shops.  Cinema also available.",3,2010,08,22
223,"Amazing, Amazing, Amazing!!","Yes Simply this is an amazing hotel!  From arrival to department we were treated superbly.

Check-in welcoming and fast.  Rooms were fantastic. We had booked a double room but we were in an executive double room which was furnished beautifully, very spacious, spotless bathroom, robes and slippers an extra bonus.  We were celebrating our five yr wedding anniversary and what a surprise to receive a card and fruit basket on entering the room! 

Pool was stunning.  Our three old daughter loved it and it was lovely at 7.30 each morn.  Area spotless and loungers are lovely for relaxing while my child was paddling away.  Changing rooms were immaculate and plastic bags available for wet wear were brillant.  

We dined in the brassier restaurant and enjoyed a 4 course meal.  Tiarmisu  is too die for!!  Efficient friendly staff really makes this hotel.
Breakfast was also enjoyable on the 3 mornings we stayed.  Quite a queue later on in the morn but we always dined at 9ish when it was quieter.  Freshly cooked crepes with cream and strawberry sauce were a big hit with our daughter.   

We found the service in the bar fantastic.  It was great for our drinks/food to be brought down to us, children were made welcome and our daughter made loads of friends as it was more of a comfortable couch area than an actual bar.  We preferred this to the more formal area of the the Lime Tree Bar.   In the evening candles and lanterns were lit making the area lovely and cosy.

Playground is an added bonus with colourful safe and fun equipment in an enclosed area.  A great idea!

The hotel has wonderful pieces of art work all over and first impressions on entering from an amazing chandelier  to shiny tiles we knew we would enjoy our stay.  Also the public toilets downstairs are wonderfully maintained.

This hotel is really amazing and well worth a visit.  I could not find one complaint which is not the usual case of hotels in Ireland!! Will be back!",5,2010,08,05
223,Great Hotel - Punches above its' prices,"A refershingly modern styled hotel. Always a warm welcome and everything bang on. Would expect to be paying ‚Ç¨20 more per night. Compared to other hotels I have stayed in, it is great value - in a league above most that charge 30% more. The only issue is that sometimes there service from the bar is too slow - you have to go and ask to be served/ have more drinks when you are eating the bar food - you get ignored. The food is good, but the menu can be a bit too narrow in choice and stays the same for months. Gets a bit boring for me, but then I'm a regular visitor.

Great place - make sure you have a car. Try it.",5,2010,07,30
223,"Great Hotel, Fantastic Food, Service with a Smile","I stayed in Castleknock for 2 nights while in Dublin on business. I arrived on Thursday evening to a friendly, professional welcome at the front desk. I was informed about meal times and facilities available and was checked in quickly. 

I ate in the restaurant on Thursday night and enjoyed the food very much. Hot, timely, tasty and reasonably priced. Breakfast the following morning was very good with plenty of choice also. 

Before my departure I decided to check out the Leisure Centre, again no complaints. The changing rooms were spotlessly clean with plenty of space. Swim hats must be worn and could be purchased on site for a very small fee. 

I will definitely be paying another visit to Castleknock not only for business but hopefully pleasure too. Great hotel with a professional, friendly service, can't ask for more really.",4,2010,07,27
223,Great Dublin Hotel that ticks all the boxes,"Nothing was too much trouble, very easy to find and get to, friendly staff, good broadband, food was excellent adequate parking, golf if you fancy it, good leisure facility. If i were staying in Dublin and needed a location outside of the city this would be the place, close to motorway and other amenties if you wanted them.",5,2010,07,01
223,Relaxed & clean; great value for Dublin,"I have stayed here a number of times. It's near to the M50 unless you have to travel at peak times. If you venture outside the hotel you are in the countryside almost immediately. I brought my bike and spent a great 90 minutes exploring the Strawberry Beds and Phoenix Park.

The hotel is very clean ; almost a little sterile but I like it. Rooms are modern and spotless. Shower is great; it always wets the floor but that's someone else's trouble I suppose!

Have also stayed with family in adjoining rooms which are great too.",5,2010,06,30
223,Fabulous Hotel,"Just back from a ""Fabulous"" weekend at Castleknock. We had a wonderful time and cannot recommend it highly enough. Beautiful place and excellent staff, nothing is too much trouble. We will certainly return!!!!",5,2010,06,20
223,Christening,"Its was a lovely day well spend with the loved ones and the hotel was great, I wouldnt mind going back there again in future........it was fabulous!",5,2010,06,15
223,Not worth the money,"We stayed in an Executive room and were disappointed . Nothing disastrous but well short of the luxury we were expecting . Just a few of several quibbles : only one armchair , small tv too far from "" king sized bed "" ( 2 beds pushed together ) ,frayed bath robes , uninspiring view of golf links , white wine served to room without wine-cooler .......The very long corridors had well-worn and stained carpets ; the vast open-plan ground floor had railway station acoustics but was pleasant enough at night with numerous candles lit . Food was good and the main evening restaurant very pleasing . Unless you're interested in golf or in travelling into Dublin , we could find nothing of interest in the surrounding area .",3,2010,06,10
223,Great Hotel if you are not a guest!,"You must have a car to get anywhere even the bus doesn't go to Castleknock, it's not close to the city centre.The hotel and rooms are very nice and clean. Thursday through Sunday the hotel staff were busy hosting functions--from  2 weddings to a christening, the lobby was always busy with kids running around without supervision. It seemed as if hotel management enforced new rules daily-no plastic cups allowed outside, no swimming without a swimming cap, which you must purchase for 3 Euro (Although everyone else swam without a cap), and proper footware required on outside patio, etc.

Remember to take your travel documents with you, because upon eating breakfast we were told that our breakfast was not included in the booking, but I had my documents proving it was, and it sure wasn't worth the cost of $20 a person if it hadn't been included. There wasn't any variety in food opitions the entire 7 days we were there.",3,2010,06,10
223,Another Great Stay in Castleknock Hotel,"Well done again to the team at Castleknock Hotel, Guy is doing a great job there and keep up the good work.  We both had a fantastic stay here.  Staff as always very accommodating; Ruth, Elaine, Silvia and all staff who we came into contact with, were all amazing.",5,2010,06,09
223,The best Ireland has to offer!!!  We loved it here!,"Ending our trip with three night at Castleknock was the best idea we had!  In addition to being close to the airport, we were only a 30 minute bus ride to Dublin city center.  The staff of Castleknock made it a pleasure to stay there, as well as the spa!  We let them know ahead of time we were on our honeymoon, and in our room on our arrival was a handwritten card and basket of fruit to greet us!  

Room was magnificent (though the mattress was not firm enough for us - our opinion), very spacious and chic!  It ws as if we stepped into the latest trends at IKEA!  We had free Wi-Fi which was key to our international travel.  Anything we needed in our room or around the hotel, the staff responded promptly and in a cheerful manner.

Park Restaurant - Outstanding food and service!!!  We had dinner there twice and room service one night.  The massage package at the spa was nice, and reasonably priced.  If you travel Ireland cheaply, make sure you save your splurging and high-life for Castleknock!  Most definitely recommended, will stay here again if we make it back to Ireland someday!",5,2010,06,07
223,worth staying for food alone.,"very nice hotel.quiet location but yet close to city.great views over golf course.
health centre is good.bar is spacious with very good food.but i must say the restaurant
is one of the best we have eaten in.rooms are nice,quiet with good views.
staff are friendly.",4,2010,06,02
223,lovely oasis of an hotel which appears on the horizon after driving a little twisted road to get to,just back from a weekend break this is the forth time we have stayed in the hotel brought another couple with us who never stayed before decided to upgrade to an excutive suite for an extra 20 euro per night on arrival was dissapointed that there was no robes in our room but after a couple of phone calls to reception it was eventually sorted with the hotel dropping one nights upgrade after i pointed out my dissapointment  and placing a lovely bowl of fresh fruit and a magazine complimentry in our room ate both nights in the bistro and food was excellent as was the breakfast on both mornings beautiful setting will definately return received a 50 euro voucher to be used against a futher stay last but not least fabulous music saturday nite music on a sun afternoon also but didn't hear it,5,2010,06,01
223,"Excellent hotel, clean, good food, leisure facilities excellent and staff go out of their way for you","Stayed over week-end had a fantastic time all staff very courteous, polite and everyone made time to smile and say hello, thanks to Lorraine for organising birthday card in room and cake in restaurant for my partners birthday and staff in restaurant all sang happy birthday. Leisure facilities were excellent and managed to get a few treatments in in Tonic, very relaxing, will definately recommend this hotel and will stay there again",5,2010,06,01
223,Outstanding  Hotel,"What an amazing hotel. We have just had 4 nights at Castleknock Hotel & Country Club. The staff are helpful & considerate, the rooms are spacious and spotless, the facilities are just superb, from Tonic Spa and the leisure centre to the restaurants. The food in all of the facilities was very good. We will be recomending whenever we can.",5,2010,05,31
223,Stunning,"Wow.   What a beautiful hotel.  The reception staff were most welcoming and helpful.  The food and service in the Park restaurant was outstanding.  They have a beautiful, open plan, lobby with plenty of seating, bars, and live music at the weekends when we stayed.  There is a great atmosphere.   The rooms were spotless and relatively new, with a walk in shower in addition to a full bath.  Breakfast was amazing.  Even smoked bacon!  The hotel itself is situated in beautiful countryside.  We will be back!",5,2010,05,26
223,enjoyed our stay!,"really enjoyed our stay here, had dinner and breakfast in hotel restaurant, food great as were the staff, the only drawback we had was the noise from the corridors, rooms are not sound proof at all, so if you dont mind children running up and down the corridors and screaming from 8am onwards then take your break away at the weekend, otherwise take a midweek break during school term......",4,2010,05,20
223,Excellent Hotel,"Found the Castleknock hotel very good. Room was large and airy, bed was big and comfortable. Leisure centre was a good size with good amenities. Food at breakfast was varied, plentiful, and of a good quality. Dinner in the restaurant was superb. All staff encountered were friendly and professional. Only snag I had, the hotel was hard to find initially, but the roadworks on the M50 may have contributed to this.  Tips. Check out the Chinese Restaurant in the village of Caslteknock (I think it was Wangs) great  and reasonably priced food. If going into Dublin, park in the village and get the bus.

Overall a wonderful hotel I would look forward to staying at in the future.",4,2010,05,20
223,Lovely Hotel,Beautiful Hotel. Lots of car parking spaces. Large relaxing lobby. Beautiful Bedrooms with bath and seperate shower. Breakfast was buffet style with plenty of variety. I would return again to this hotel.,5,2010,05,19
223,Don't miss this place,"Castleknock is a comfortable hotel with a very helpful staff.
 Our first two days of seven were spent in Dublin. The Castleknock was a bit outside of the city in the suburb. We arrived early due to our flight from the states arriving early in the morning and the front desk staff was happy to help us with storing our luggage for us until our rooms were ready so we could start our sightseeing. 
Upon returning in the afternoon after our adventure into the city, we decided it would be best to take the bus into the city. The front desk staff was more than helpful giving us info on the bus stop and route and making change for us.
 The rooms were very comfy and spotless. The bathrooms had floor warmers in them and were nice when getting out of the showers. They're was both a stand up shower and a bath tub.
 The only negative at this hotel was the bar staff. They took a little while to take our order and we had to wait, on one occasion, about 20 minnutes to get 3 bowls of ice cream. Prices were reasonable though and the food was delicious.
The spa area and the indoor pool were very nice and offered spa services at reasonable prices.
On our last day, we decided to visit a couple more sites in Dublin before leaving for our next stop and the front desk staff was very helpful with storing our bags for us until we returned
I would defintely stay here again..",5,2010,05,18
223,"Perfect, perfect, perfect!","Me & my sister stayed at this hotel over the bank holiday weekend. We flew to dublin and the taxi from the airport cost 30 euros. On arrival we were greeted by smiling friendly staff and the lady on reception couldnt do enough for us. We unpacked and then decided to get a snack from the bar area. The service was great, the food lovely and the surroundings very relaxing. The price of wine is a little on the high side but inkeeping with other prices in Dublin.  
The purpose of our stay was to chill however we did go into dublin on the Friday. This involves a short say 5 min walk down a path to the nearest bus stop and a bus into town which took about 30 mins and cost 2 euro 50. Bargain! The buses run every 6 mins. 
On the saturday we took advantage of late breakfast and then chillled in the leisure area. The pool was great and the sauna tops.  We ate in the hotel as part of our deal on the Saturday night. I had previously read on here about having to eat in the brasserie, however we were cheeky and asked if we could eat in the Park Restaurant which is lovely. This was arranged at no extra cost and the meal from beginning to end was perfect.

The hotel rooms are very clean and modern and are lovely. I shall definitely be returning to this hotel but this time taking my whole family...and my sister of course!

If you want a relaxing stay, where nothing is too much trouble for the staff, where the food is lovely and the surrounding areas good to walk round then this is your hotel.",5,2010,05,07
223,Wonderful Relaxing Luxury Break,"My wife and I took a last minute deal to this hotel over the bank holiday through Travelzoo.  Everything that was promised in the offer was available and we were very impressed.  From check in to check out we found the service to be excellent.  All the staff were helpful and courteous.  We stayed in an executive room with a view over the golf course.  The room was large and comfortable and the bathroom was lovely with separate shower and bath. We had a flat screen TV, DVD player, IPod Docking station and even a pair of hair straighteners were in the room alongside the hairdryer. The leisure complex was great too and we totally chilled out.  This is a gem of a hotel and we will definitely be back.  Couldn't fault our stay.",5,2010,05,05
223,Everything I would want!,"Excellent facilities, accomodation, staffing.......everything! Just loved it AND made my weekend....Great value for money.",5,2010,05,04
223,Liked it a lot!,"This is a very gracious modern space. Warm welcoming staff, clean rooms, excellent pool. Gym a little small, but fairly well equipped. There did appear to be a rift between the gym membership and the gym staff. The views across the golf course are lovely.
Didn't eat there, so can't comment on the food.
There were weddings on both days we stayed, there was no noise in the rooms from these events.
There is charged wired internet in the room but free wireless in the lobby.
Bus rides into town are cheap and run regularly from a spot a half mile walk away. Taxi ride back again if you after hours costs about 20 Euro.",5,2010,05,03
223,Very relaxing break.,"I was there last Saturday night with friends we had a fantastic time and some really nice treatments in their Tonic Spa, very friendly atmosphere and we were well looked after.

Will definitely return again.",5,2010,04,27
223,"Lovely pleasant stay, could not fault","Stayed here only for one night, was family event.  Check-in was little slow, really should have been more staff on at reception.  Room was very clean and modern.  Health spa area was fantastic, and some of the girls said the treatments were lovely.  I loved the pool, great view, and clean.  Would recommend to all young and old alike.  Had evening meal at hotel, which was lovely.  There was a wedding on at the hotel, so was good atmostphere.  Dont think you could go wrong, staying here, you wont be dissapointed.",4,2010,04,24
223,they couldn't have looked after us better,"this hotel is massive.... we were a bit overawed with the reception area.  However the staff are brilliant!!   I had booked it for my son's birthday, and the staff had even got him a birthday card!... the little touches were amazing.   On dinner and breakfast reservations, we never had to divulge our room number, the staff already knew. and they made all of us feel so special.

we are booked to go back again, this time just my partner and i, we had a lovely time... we cant wait!  

The best thing about his hotel is it's service.... nothing is too much trouble and everythign is taken care of.    Always discreetly but with the highest attention to detail.",5,2010,04,23
223,Girls Night IN Experience Fantastic,"We took advantage of the Girls Night In experience at the Castleknock hotel for a friends 30th birthday on Saturday 17th April 2010. We were all impressed with the hotel, its relaxing features, entertainment and food was delicious. The hotel grounds are fabulous, and the leisure facilities are great too.
As part of the girls night in package we received 2 spa treatments in Tonic, b n b, 4 course meal and use of all leisure facilities pool, sauna etc.
We would deffinately visit again and we would reccommend this hotel to all types of people whether families, couples, girls nights away it is 4* and beautiful",5,2010,04,22
223,Supervalue Breaks,"The first time I stayed at the Hotel I had saved stamps through a supermarket to get a really good value rate at the Hotel. I live very near it but decided to treat my Mother who lives a few hours away to a nice Hotel and a treatment in their Spa. However due to crazy weather at the time my Mother couldn't travel. I ended up staying for one night with my boyfriend instead. 

The staff are lovely esp. since I was ringing every other hour changing arrangements. I went from smoking to non smoking, twin to double and even asked if I could bring my dog because I couldn't get a pet sitter and I'm quite fussy about leaving him alone (I got a polite no!) . 

The location is lovely and the hotel is very clean and spacious. There was a few Christmas parties when we were there but the noise didn't travel and there wasn't any messing. I really quite like the bar area - it's very modern. There is also more comfortable booths to throw yourself down. The Bar menu is the same as the room service menu I think it should be a little more varied. I actually couldn't get anything like peanuts or crisps at the bar which I would of liked. 

We upgraded to the fancy Steak Restaurant and I wasn't that impressed with the meal to be honest. Steak was well done even though I asked for medium - rare, the mash was watery and the veg was cold. I'd heard a lot of good things about this restaurant (I expected it to be the same standard as Tribes in Sandycove) and it really wasn't worth the extra supplement we paid. To be honest I blame my boyfriend for this. I preferred the menu for the other restaurant as I'm not a big steak person and his Vegan? but he wanted to treat me and thought I was just being polite going for a menu with better veggie options. We ended up having a great time whilst dining even though the food wasn't the quality we expected. The atmopshere and service was great. The breakfast the next morning was also lovely.

The room was lovely - very much the standard high quality room you'd expect. Really large comfy bed - good TV. Next time I might see about a room with a nice big tub and a mini bar! As I love to just relax in the room.  In comparsion to Renaissance Chancery Court in London which was the last Hotel I stayed in though the room was heaven. I'm a fan of modern charm!

The Spa was great. I got the full body Hot Stone Massage and I have a real problem switching off and I nearly did which says a lot. It was 150% better than the massage I'd gotten in LaStampa's Spa in D1 a month or so earlier which wasn't relaxing at all. The Spa area is comfy, you can make use of a lot of the facilities if you've time. The girl also gave me feedback on my skin which I appreciated. I've another booked in for next week after I got a good rate from stalking their Facebook page.

After my stay I heard how they put together a Wedding Reception for a Couple who had been trapped in traffic for hours when the snow caused chaos and their planned venue shut down due to the weather. You got a real sense that they wanted to save the day and that they did. It was just PR stunt it was about providing a service they are proud of because they know they are damn good.

This hotel has a real good factor.",4,2010,04,20
223,I would think twice!,"I would think twice of choosing a place today,not only was the service in the bar slow, but the waitors didn't seen very enthusiastic, and once we had ordered out lunch, the servers came along with the lunch menus (bit ridiculous I think!!)
When the food arrived it was cold, not the quality we had paid for!
Very disappointed all round, not in the best location either, about 20 minutes from any buses,very rural!",1,2010,04,19
223,"Fantastic, friendly, professional proper 4 star hotel.............","Have been going to the Castleknock Hotel since it opened, not exactly difficult as I live directly across from it. We have attended there for birthdays, anniversaries etc over this time but had never been upstairs. I sent my parents there over the xmas and they loved it. My young daughter and I had a girlie overnite stay recently and I was so impressed, I booked my hubby and I in overnight thereafter. Every occasion was faultless. I know I was across from my house but didn't feel it. Atmosphere is fab. Great bargains. . People are fast to complain but alot slower to show appreciation for what is a fantastic service to local residents but also to persons from further afield. This hotel is beside the Phoenix Park which is incredible, the Dublin Zoo, Blanchardstown Centre which is one of the largest shopping centres in the country so what are you waiting for. BOOK. I have never written a review on a hotel prior to this but just had to with this hotel. Boy do this hotel know what the guests require to have a brilliant 4 star experience.",5,2010,04,16
223,"Disgraceful-cancelled cos of no fly zone disruption, hotel wouldn't refund,cancelled 21 hours prearrival rather than 24","Apparently 98% of hotels were waiving their 24 hour cancellation fee because of the huge disruption caused by volcanic ash and no fly zone. Clearly this is noone's fault, however, we could not get to Dublin. Rang at 6pm THE NIGHT BEFORE - the minute new information was released - to cancel our room and was told because it was after 3pm we would still be charged ¬£80 for our stay 24 hours later.  I am appalled by the money grabbing attitude, presumably people are stranded in Dublin so room would easily be resold, so to charge ¬£80 for being 3 hours into their no cancellation policy I think is the height of greed. Would definitely select another hotel when we change our flights (free of charge!).",1,2010,04,16
223,Absolutely Abysmal,"Had heard good things about Castleknock Hotel initially but was left frustrated & disappointed afterwards. Disgusted is probably a more apt adjective.

Cleanliness was terrible, breakfast which was served to the rooms was not cleaned up until very late at night. The bar would not provide us table service in the residents bar, which was located in the middle of the entrance hall. Shocking planning for the situation of the bar in the hotel. No atmosphere, no comfort. The entrance to the hotel itself actually looks like a Supermarket, the designer may have been trying to be modern but got it terribly wrong. Tried to make a booking at the Spa reception but was left standing for approximately 15 minutes until someone showed up to deal with us. You would get better service in a hostel.

Its a shame as the location for the hotel is excellent, outside activities nearby are plentiful. Customer service we received from all areas was abysmal. I most definetely will not be returning",2,2010,04,16
223,Awful experience - stay away,From checking in at 5pm to find copious amounts of left over food from room service lying outside the rooms on until returning to our rooms that night at 11pm to cold food being served in the restaurant.,1,2010,04,15
223,Bring Ear Plugs and bear with the restaurant staff,"Having read tripadvisor reviews I selected this hotel for its mainly positive reviews. The only flies in the ointment I saw were one review stating the restaurant staff were a bit iffy and one review saying the walls were a bit thin.Bearing this in mind I asked for a quiet room.However thin walls remain thin walls . The room adjoining (or so it seemed) had two men that watched footie on their TV until 12.30 am .Then talked for 45mins in I assume normal conversational levels but I heard them none the less.So peace at1.15am ? No.. a random succession of wedding guests seemed to rove the corridors until 2.30pm. Room was great, bed was very comfortabe, but lighting a bit gloomy in main bed area. The hotel is very eco conscious so Ok. We had  a meal in the Brasserie .  on Saturday night. Food was very good and the setting of tables very clever as couples get an intamate table for two yet by simple screening (yet feeling open) they are able to accomodate large parties also, Ambience was good well lit and and clean. Service mmmmm. You stand at the ""wait here to be served point"" (we stood 5 mins) but you stand at/in the waiters ""flight path "" so we had to re-jig our positions quite often to allow for this. Whilst waiting there we noticed in front of us a very hassled (I assume Maitre D'). He didn't seem to notice us waiting. (to be fair the place was busy). We gave our room number to our waitress had a lovely meal (as part of the room package ) but as we mulled a bit the staff seemed not to pass us as nearly empty now and we just left to go to our room. We made it as far as the bar and our( later waitress) asked us to pay for the additional items we ordered to the set menu cost. I had assumed that the extras would be added to my room bill . I explained my thinking and that was ok except I had to sign for the additions. So we waited approx.10 mins for this to happen. Unfortunately I was charged for an alcohoholic beer (I am TT and drank a 0% Beer), Which was approx 1Euro dearer. So I asked for the correction. (I was made to feel as if I wasn't telling the truth) but perhaps it was a language/culture difficulty as most of the staff are not from Ireland.Any way the bill was produced quickly this time and I signed for it but for some reason I thought she wanted us to stay for a receipt. We waited for 10 mins ..eventually I went to the cash pay point and stood tthere waiting to be noticed. The Maitre D was in front of me as hassled as ever He was examining about 10 receipts in his hand and looking like thunder. I eventually asked him if it was ok to leave.He said I had to sign  a receipt. I told im I had so we took our que and escaped!  
The Spa facilities were very good. I know I am a bit picky but as you relax in the jacuzzi you can look up and see small holes in the ceiling where the recently installed  emergency button has been wired.To the staffs credit I was lent a euro for my locker and they were really friendly . The receptionist couldn't have done more for me in terms of how to get to the local railway station.",3,2010,03,25
223,Couldn't Ask for Better,"This hotel was amazing! We stayed here for my 21st birthday.  The downsides were the commute to the City Center-- but just ride the bus and all will be good.  Taxis can be expensive to get places so make sure you know the bus schedule.

The staff was more than helpful-- we were never left hanging with any question.  They were always willing to do something for you.

The bar was definitely expensive-- we went elsewhere, but there's not much in the area.

The breakfast was superb.  If I was going back I would most likely stay here again, if I could obtain the same specials.",5,2010,03,23
223,Excellent hotel and value,"Stayed here for two nights in March for around ¬£50 per room per night. The hotel was clean, staff very helpful and efficient and the rooms clean and comfortable; we didn't eat here so can't comment at all on food / service. 
The only downside for us was the distance from Dublin itself (around 20E one way) and given we needed to be in the city both days this was a considerable extra. If I were to visit Dublin for similar reasons in the future (e.g. sporting event) I would probably not consider Castleknock but would certainly return for a relaxing / romantic break outside of the city.",4,2010,03,15
223,good dublin base,"got a great deal price wise, good location for exlporing dublin but would need a car, rooms, food all decent, big modern hotel, only complaint was noise at night from band in lobby",4,2010,03,01
223,Nice Hotel. Very Handy for Visiting Dublin,"We stayed from Thu - Sat. Bedroom was very nice. Robes and Slippers provided. Beautiful View over the Golf Course, very quiet also - importent when travelling with a 5 yr old who sleeps lightly. 

Excellent Pool, very Clean. Breakfast was all you could wish for, covered all bases. All staff very friendly. Have stayed in other Hotels where the Management Presence is felt, walking around, greeting guests, didn't see much Management Presence. Also we had requested a camp-bed in the room, never materialised, but didn't matter, 5yr old sleeps in our bed usually on a stay-away. Overall Excellent. Will definitely go back. 

p.s. Very handy for Blanchardstown Shopping Center and Aquatic Center.",5,2010,02,28
223,great hotel,stayed at the castleknock hotel in may 2009 on their two night package and enjoyed my stay there.The buffet breakfast was very nice indeed and the staff were very helpful.Next time i visit dublin Ireland i will be staying there again,5,2010,02,18
223,Large rooms and friendly place,"We stayed here for 2 nights and had a very enjoyable time.  This is not, however, the best location for downtown Dublin.  The location is good for exploring the tourist attractions of Meath, and Kildare areas, but for quick trips into Dublin this is maybe not ideal.  The main road into Dublin N3 is nearly always jammed so it would take a while to get into the centre of Dublin.  Okay once but not if you wanted a base to be in and out of the centre all day. Rather  it is a decent distraction from the city, down an old country lane from the village of Castlekock and near the old Phoenix Park racecourse.  We secured a good deal from a late booking s website and overall the hotel had the feel of a spacious and relaxed 4 star corporate hotel.  Our room was spacious and well noise insulated (either that or there was no-one next door).  I thought the free super fast wifi in the communal areas was a nice touch (unlike my recent visit to Paris where the hotel wanted E4.50 per hour). The multi channel tv coverage seemed more than adequate and the leisure facilities were excellent (although on a purely personal note noisy kids curtailed my enjoyment).  We didn't have the breakfast as we enjoyed exploring local areas for that but did have the curry dish from their bar menu one evening which was delicious.  I should think the outdoor bar area at the back, beside the golf course would be great in the summer months.    The reception area had lots of space to sit and chill.  The staff were very friendly and the car park is huge and free. The Phoenix Park is on your door step and the venue is used by visiting sports teams.  The All Blacks squad stayed there recently.   All in all I would stay again but only at reduced rack rates.  If I was to pay the full rate I would want a better location and a bit more atmosphere.",5,2010,02,11
223,Lovely Stay,"We stayed here for one night at a great rate of ‚Ç¨50 for a double room, with my husband and 2 yr old daughter.  We really enjoyed it.  Our daughter slept on a pull out sofa bed which was ideal for her and was made up when we arrived.  The rooms were lovely and snug and bathroom nicely decorated with bath and free standing shower.  We had dinner in the bar that evening which was lovely and the staff were very accommodating.  We used the leisure centre which again was lovely.  I had a back massage which I would highly recommend after a days shopping in Blanchardstown Shopping Centre which is only 10 mins drive away.   The only down side is that there was a slight buzzing in the room coming from electricity box I think but not a big problem.",5,2010,02,10
223,Fell in Love,"I am very upset to read other peoples stay in Castleknock that they didnt like it. 
I had a really good night. Checked in about 4pm. Very quick check in and Reception staff fantastic, as a receptionist myself I'll always judge reception staff first. I new it would be a great stay. Got to the room, very bright clean room. The shower was out of this world, very relaxing. Tea & Coffee tray included in the room, was brill, bitta selection to choose from. Had dinner in the Park Restaurant, which I fell in love with. We went for a early bird, 3 courses ‚Ç¨20 each. You cannot go wrong. Bar staff very well knowledged in their job. Elaine our bar maid for the night was brill. Its nice to have a chatty girl behind the bar who was nice to everyone. She had a badge that said Trainee Manager, the hotel has a main asset there with her becoming a Manager. Got breakfast to the room the following morning. Full hearty brekkie, all you need after a nice of drinking.
My only fault is the room was very warm, but yet again id be moaning if it was cold. Least when its hot we can open the window. Next time we go, I'll have to check out the leisure centre and spa as I didnt get a chance when I first stayed there, but I will be back",5,2010,02,07
223,over priced food and drink,"staff were friendly , pool and spa area are very nice , booked executive room not quite up to the standards but still reasonable ,went for dinner in bar area very limited choice , food was very basic and not worth the over pricing , do not eat the pate , although food was bad waitress was very helpfull and friendly , all cocktails over 10 euro , which is a bit much , ended up paying 110 e for one starter ,2 maincourse 1 dessert 2 bottles of wine and 2 cocktails , in THE BAR and not the restaraunt , restaraunt prices were double . plenty of parking and golf course looks lovely ,",3,2010,02,04
223,Lovely Hotel / clean / relaxing,"We did a package deal 3 nights with one dinner included. it was everything we expected and more, The hotel is spotless, the food is good, we eat there every evening. The bar menus is quiet varied, and one can sit and eat in the spacious lobby..The menu in the dining room is different and delicious. The staff were helpful and lashing of food on offer.
We had full use of the swimming pool and all leisure facilities in the price, again everything spotless, all the little extras like shower cream/shampoo, hairdryers working. towels supplied plastic bags to take wet swim wear.
Bedrooms clean spacious, very nice showers and a seperate bath.
The only down side is the dull corridors which look a bit gloomy,which is of no signifance really. 
I mislaid one earring, on checkout I told the receptionist, who was very helpful and took my details  and phone No said if found they would contact me, I didnt expect to hear from them, but to my surprise I got a call at my home to say they hadn't found it.
(I had already found it when unpacking)
The hotel is about 40 t0 45 mins on the 37 bus which is just a short walk. The hotel feels as if it is in the country side. I believe one can drive through the Phoenix park and pick up the Luas there, but the bus was fine for us, Also there is huge car parking facilities and golf course at the hotel. Overall we enjoyed our stay there.I would stay there again for a relaxing quiet break.",5,2010,01,30
223,Would not go back,"Hotel is lovely and the staff on the reception were very friendly. However the staff in the restaurant were the most ignorant I have come accross in Hospitality even the woman who seemed to be the manager was so sour looking and ignorant. Myself and my partner were on a getaway break so because we were on a set dinner menu we were not allowed to eat in the restaurant, we had to eat in the breakfast area with plastic mismatched chairs and wonky tables. To make things worse a waitress serving at the table behind us was rather loud in saying 'because you are not eating off the set menu you can go into the restaurant for your dinner its a much nicer room with a better atmosphere'. The food was horrific also.",3,2010,01,29
223,What a fantastic hotel,"Have just returned from a brilliant weekend at this hotel.   About 40 of us spent weekend there to celebrate a friends birthday.  Everybody enjoyed themselves immensely.  Everything about this hotel is great.  The bedrooms are very spacious and clean.   ~The bathrooms are lovely = baths and walkin showers are great, lighting in the bathrooms is nice and bright and the mirrors are also good.  The food is very nice (breakfasts and tea lovely and hot), Dinners were also nice.  The hotel supplied us with a lovely well laid out room for the birthday dinner.The Staff are all very friendly and helpful.  The swimming pool was great and is surrounded by fabulous windows which make the area lovely and bright and provide lovely views.    I would recommend this hotel to everybody.   This was my second stay there and enjoyed both stays tremenduously.",5,2010,01,24
223,Enjoyable,"Lovely hotel, decor very pleasing, spacious, good parking, comfortable rooms though dim lighting if wanting to read or do some paper work, excellent staff, tasty and good choice of food, very friendly atmosphere, lots of business conferences going on, will go again.",5,2009,12,04
223,"Fab Food, Fab Service, Fab Hotel!! Will be back again!!","We stayed two nights and had one 3 course meal, and two lunches in the hotel. Great service from all staff. When we arrived our room was quite not ready so  while we waited we had some lunch in the lobby. (the receptionst rang us when room was ready) We had a light lunch which was fab!! Room was spacious with a couch for us to relax on while watching tv. Bathroom spacious with two showers, floor was heated in bathroom which was lovely with the cold wet mornings. We had a swin in the hotel pool. Lovely and relaxing. Low lighting and soft music. Restaurant staff very very busy that night due to a wedding, a birthday, and numberous other events on in the hotel. Staff were fully attentive at all times and could not do enough to ensure our stay was a plesurable one! Food was also great...(my partner is a chef) We will definately reccomend the hotel to others and if we are in dublin again we would stay in the hotel again.",5,2009,11,25
223,"Great hotel, great food","We stayed at this hotel for two nights with dinner included on one of the nights. The rooms were lovely, the food was excellent and the pool was great. We really enjoyed our stay and would have no hesitation recommending the hotel to anyone.",5,2009,11,12
223,A large hotel - but one with good service!,"Having just stayed at the Castleknock Hotel for a couple of nights, we would echo lots of comments in the previous reviews.  Normally we would prefer to stay in a slightly smaller hotel, but the service in this hotel was very good and we were very impressed with the cleaning staff.  The facilities in the gym and swimming pool area were good. Our room was a good size and things we liked included the separate shower and bath in the large bathroom and the smaller size television which didn't dominate the room.  We would definitely stay here again, although we would ask for a room at the front because the generator at the back of the hotel makes a constant noise throughout the night and as our room didn't have air conditioning we needed to sleep with the window open.  One thing that we feel the hotel would also benefit from is a shuttle bus into Dublin centre, perhaps just 2 or 3 times a day because it is a bit of a walk to find public transport close by.  We will wait until sterling recovers against the euro though for our because prices were high all over Dublin, however it was good to be asked if I wanted to settle our bill in sterling or euros on check-out.",5,2009,11,01
223,Amazing food!,"Stayed here for 2 nights this weekend, very very impressed.  The room was lovely, big comfy bed and spotless bathroom.  We ate in the Brasserie restaurant the first night as this was part of our package, the food was absolutely gorgeous (great chicken liver pate!) and the service was attentive but not intrusive. 
Had a massage in the spa the next morning, so relaxed after it! Myself and my boyfriend went into the pool that afternoon and had the entire place to ourselves, lovely jacuzzi that looks out onto the golf course.
We ate in the Park restaurant the next night, quite pricey but was worth every cent. Had the steak fillet and himself had the monkfish, both were cooked beautifully and very large portions. Best meal I've ever eaten!
The breakfast each morning was so tasty, also excellent service.  
However, the only bad point about our stay was the loud music from the wedding downstairs on our first night, we were on the 1st floor so thumping music was not too relaxing until 2 in the morning! 
All in all this hotel certainly deserves all the awards on the wall beside reception!",5,2009,10,26
223,Unbeatable staff...,"I've spent a number of weeks during July, August and September in this excellent hotel.  On the plus side the staff are brilliant and some of the best I've encountered, they are smiley, polite, friendly and eager to help.  The rooms are spotlessly clean and well appointed with extremely comfortable beds.  Bar meals are available in the lounge, and whilst the menu is limited, the food is very good.   There is also a restaurant which has a very varied menu and you won't be dissappointed.",4,2009,10,21
223,Geat Hotel with helpful and friendly staff,"I love walking into a hotel and feeling like I am at a home away from home. There is a really welcoming and comfortable feeling when you walk into Castleknock Hotel and this is primarily down to the staff, who are extrmely accommodating and always greet you with a smile even if you pas them in the corridor. The comtemporary decor is great and also adds to the atmosphere.
The facilaities are great from the large rooms to the bar and resaurant facilities. The bar staff where great becuase they engaged with you when having a drink at the bar.I do alot of business and there is  great lobby area with booths which can provide you with good privacy.

A great asset of the hotel is it sports facilities with a really well put together golf course, which is literally only a 2 minute walk away and has great views of theLiffey Valley. Its hard to believe your only 20 minutes drive from the Guiness Brewery and the Dublin quays.I am not into spas treatment howver my wife was really impressed by them. I am however into swimming pools and I love a morning swim. For me it is important that the pool is in easy access in any hotel i choose to stay in and Castleknock fulfills this need with flying colurs.

If you want a country hotel close to the city with exceptional facilaities I recommend you stay at the Castleknock Hotel, Golf and Country Club.",4,2009,10,21
223,3 star at best - very disappointing!,"We stayed 2 nights & paid to upgrade to suite. The room was big but for a 4 star hotel facilities were very poor, no hot water in shower, no bottle opener, no signal when we switched on telly & unfortunately management didn't seem to care too much. The mini-bar was not fully stocked up or replenished. Our ""complimentary"" dinner voucher meant we couldn't eat off the proper menu - they were taken off our table & replaced with a cheap plastic menu we were allowed to choose from. We ended up paying for food from the proper menu. My advice don't give your guests a complimentary meal then make a big deal about telling them it excludes the food from the menu that's on the table!! We complained on check-out and we're told they would comp the wine from room service - we received a bill a couple of days later with the cost of it taken from my credit-card!

On a positive note food in restaurant was lovely & service was good. The bar and lobby area are spacious and comfortable & the pool is nice.

I've stayed all around the world from 5 star hotels to hostels & Castleknock is not, in my opinion, a 4 star hotel. The lack of attention to detail, uninterested management & general atmosphere left us cold. Very disappointing. Would not rush to recommend or return.",3,2009,10,18
223,Good but watch those internet offers.,"While I liked this hotel very much, you must watch what you have been promised if you are purchasing a 'package' on the net.  I did not get all that was promised and it was a  disappointment to feel cheated.   The excuse by hotel managment was that there was a miscommunication to the staff at the check in desk.

The Hotel:
Is a very nice and modern building about one mile from Castleknock village with reduced green fees for the adjoining Golf Club. Public areas are excellent apart from the 2nd floor lift lobby which had a sickening odour during my three day stay.
The Location:
Not convenient for Dublin City.
The bedroom:
I was allocated an executive room on the 2nd floor and it was excellent.  It had everything that was required for a comfortable stay
Bathroom:
Excellent, it had everything required.  A bath and separate shower was great to have.
The Leisure Centre:
A very welcoming place after a hard days work. Spotlessly clean pool, jacuzzi, steam room, sauna and gym.  
Staff:
The check in staff that I dealt with were very helpful.
The bar:
Very modern and ok value.
The restaurant:
Did not use for an eveing meal
The restaurant for breakfast:
Buffet breakfast is standard fare.  They need to fire their tomato supplier, they were utterly tasteless.  Most of the breakfast food was just adequate though certainly filling.

Overall I would recommend  this hotel if you don't mind the distance from Dublin city.  Other than that make sure you know what you are paying for when you check in.",4,2009,10,08
223,staff not very friendly,"Myself any my friend stayed in Castleknock hotel for a weekend we saw an offer on the internet for 1 night including dinner with 2 treatment in the spa for a good price.  We contacted the hotel on the Friday and we were told we could check in at 1 because we had treatments booked for half one but on arrival we were greeted with a very unhelpful receptionist who told us no we can‚Äôt check in until 3 and we would just have to wait.  We called over to the spa area and they told us that they had left a message at reception for us that our spa time had changed so we could get our treatments together.  We were never given that note until later in the day. 
 The spa was really nice and the girls working in it were friendly and helpful.
We booked a table for dinner had 8.30 as we were told no table was available for 8 when we arrived at 8.30 the restaurant were half empty.  We were asked if we wanted some bread my friend asked for a white roll the girl rolled her eyes and said she has none and would not check in the back for any.  Our main waitress was nice and friendly but we were waiting ages for them to bring us the desert menu.  The staff was not very friendly or attentive.  The same staff was on for breakfast the next morning and we had to search for somebody to bring us some toast and tea.
The hotel itself is lovely and very well looked after but the staff really let it down.",3,2009,09,27
223,Got Robbed!,"Got a voucher for a night in the hotel as an engagement present. Things went wrong from the off! Included in the voucher were chocolates and champagne on arrival (as a surprise in the room!)...there was a bottle of prosecco (not champagne!) waiting, no chocs.  We went down to the pool for an hour.  On our return, I noticed that my jewellery had been taken out of my bag..(inexpensive, but that's irrelevant), the management don't seem to find this to be a serious problem...i think it's unbelievable! We went down to have our dinner - this and a bottle of wine were included in our voucher.  They charged us for the wine even though we explained that it had been pre-paid! They eventually refunded us the money when the realised their mistake...but seriously, how can a 4 star hotel make so many mistakes and expect return-custom?! They gave us 'complimentary' use of hotel dressing gowns for the night, to make up for the misunderstandings.....wow!!! (do most hotels not have dressing gowns as standard in their rooms...?!)",1,2009,09,22
223,Great Value & very relaxing.,"Myself and my husband satyed in this hotel in mid august as part of a mid week deal that we got on the internet for a price we couldn't refuse.

The plan was for a to spend the weekend relaxing and unwinding. We thought given the country-esque location of the hotel it would be the perfect spot to do just that without having to spend to much time travelling.

Upon arrival, we were greeted by some very nice staff at reception and then told the only bit of bad news we got all weekend, our room would not be available for check-in until three o'clock. The staff were apologetic and offered us both a free cappuccino, which was lovely, took our bags off us and gave us directions to go down town if we would like to put in the time that way.

When we checked into our room, we found a very spacious and clean room, which far excceded our expections for the price that we paid. We got ourselves organised and went down to the bar to have a drink and a nibble. The service was prompt and the staff were freindly. We had some lunch which we both thought was really good.

I decided to see what the Spa facitilities had to offer and after looking through the brochure I enquired about making a booking for some treatments. The staff explained that they were very busy as most people book before they arrive but they really did their best and managed to book me in for the following day. This then gave my husband the perfect excuse to book a round of Golf.

That evening, we went for dinner in the main restaurant and everything from the food to the atmosphere and the staff was fantastic. I couldn't reccomend the restaurant enough.

The next day we both my husband and I ent off about our respective plans for the day. On my end, the Spa treatment was exactly what I needed and the staff were fantastic, I came away feeling totally refreshed and de-stressed. My husband had a gret time on the olf course and felt that it was very well maintaitned and a real bonus to an already great hotel.

Overall, we had a great time and got superb value for money. Every staff meber we dealt with was friendly and helpful. Our room was fantastic and the housekeepers were discreet. The food and lesuire facitlites were also excellent. Not much I can fault as any issue we had was resolved immeadiately. I would reccomend a stay to anyone.",4,2009,09,12
223,FANTASTIC!,"Stayed at this hotel for 6 nights and couldn't fault it. The hotel itself is very impressive. Our room had a great view of the golf course. The food was wonderful, deserving of it's awards and the all the staff friendly and efficient. The spa is beautiful and there again the staff were professional and welcoming.
We received some bad news from home (England) and the Manager was so helpful, he offered to re-book  flights and made phone calls on our behalf...he even sent complimentary flowers to our room!  In short we had a wonderful stay and can't wait to go back!",5,2009,09,08
223,A long way to go in human relations! Pity as the hotel is nice!,"Oh my god - where to start - well it had good points and bad points.  Good points were nice welcoming reception staff, roomy lobby, spacious bedroom, good leisure centre with a warm pool(getting rarer to find!) and nice bar food.  Bad points - rooms WAY too hot, Service very slow, breakfast food too hot one morning and too cold the other one, loud band playing in bar at the end of the open plan lobby on a saturday afternoon to entertain a wedding party to the dismay of any non wedding members who could not hear themselves think!  Complaints about this were largely ignored-at least a recommendation of another quieter area to sit in would have been welcome (by the way there is a nice seating area on the first floor outside the lifts-one of the children in our group found it-we were on the second floor so had not realised this area was there).We were at the hotel celebrating a family occassion and had booked the Park Restaurant a number of weeks previously to accomodate us all in an early sitting of 6.30pm-we were first put sitting in the brasserie section (ok for a regular meal but we were there for an occassion and wanted a bit of class for it!). After much huffing and puffing about the Park restaurant being full we were moved into it. Then we were given the brasserie menu and had to ask for the Park restaurant ones. Childrens meals were ordered at 6.50 and starters for them arrived at 7.20-by 7.30 the toddlers had still not got their dinners and the requested baby bowl had not arrived either so there were 3 babies and 2 children under 4 being carried around the room as they were hungry, cranky and tired! The adults starters arrived at 7.40pm! After the main course(which for one mother of a small baby was largely eaten cold as she had to take her away from the restaurant to get her settled as it was getting late) we decided to abandon ship and leave the restaurant.  And noone
else arrived after us so the restaurant was not full-neither was the brasserie!
Then came the fiasco with the bill-which was eventually settled and paid for after some deductions. And with a bad taste in our mouths we left the restaurant. However it did not end there.The next morning we were all being foisted with another 40euro onto each room for the restaurant bill-something to do with the restaurant staff assuming were were on a 2 night bed and breakfast & 1 evening meal package which was not what we had booked at all! Our booking with the Park restaurant was a seperate matter to be paid in full on the evening. So somewhere between the front desk and the restaurant the booking had changed without anyone asking us-and we were 6 families so there was plenty of people to ask in fairness!!!!!  Then to add insult to injury the general manager has now been on to us asking for another 240 euro to finalise the Park bill- not a word of apology for the wrecked anniversary dinner for my parents and their 5 children and partners and the 10 grandchildren! I am still awaitng the finish of this matter but the staff have a long way to go in communicating between themselves and after our group leaving over 2500 euro there over a 48 hour period you would expect at least a bit of an apology and that they would chalk it up to experience and make sure they are all singing from the same hymnsheet in future!  WE WILL NOT BE RETURNING!!! A DEFINITE NO NO FOR A LARGE GROUP OF PEOPLE.",2,2009,09,07
223,two stars overrated not for special family get together.,"A ruby Wedding ruined by the ill training of staff in the restaurant and reception and for that our poor mother and fathers special and in times of darkness, happy occasion was ruined by the staff and even manager of The Castleknock Hotel. If booking restaurant book anywhere but there I am only sorry I didn't read the trip advisor before we booked it. Be very careful when checking out, hotel has tendency to take money of your credit card even when you have gone home. Its not worth your while complaining we did and the staff treated my kids and family very bad the next day at breakfast we nearly had to go into kitchen and make our toast and find our own table. As a group we spent from accommodation to bar food and so called restaurant food over ‚Ç¨3000 to have us waiting an hour  for kids meals and an hour and half for ours the kids were crying at what stage do you leave a restaurant because we're Irish we are expected to take it but not anymore times are tougher. I hope by reading this you save your money its really not worth it.",1,2009,09,07
223,"Fantastic Hotel - Peaceful, spacious and well run!","We wanted to get away for a night to enjoy a Spa Hotel and got a good deal for Castleknock.  It was easy to get to from the dreaded M50 an upon arrival we were very pleased to see a nice open lobby area with plenty of comfortable stylish sofas, it was very impressive and the rest of the facilities were even more so.  The swimming pool, steam room, whirlpool and sauna were excellent and not too busy.  Our room was very spacious and overlooked the 18th hole golf green - we were there to relax and this hotel was perfect.  I will definitely return and I would scrub the negative comments below - I have stayed in  some fantastic 4 and 5 star hotels in Europe and the USA and I can put my hand on my heart and say this holds its own. If you are after a bit of peace with good facilities then look no further. 4* plus in my estimation. PS - cant comment on the food, we took a taxi to Castleknock town and ate there.",5,2009,08,31
223,"Great Hotel, we enjoyed every second of our stay","We stayed there for two nights (me and my girlfriend) and it was great. The stuff was very friendly and answered any kind of question. We enjoyed the swimming pool two times a day (it was included), the sauna and the whirlpool we used often. 
Roomservice is expensive, but the other prices (also the room price) are fair. 

It would be great if it would be written on the website wich bus to take from Dublin city centre. It's juts written that it would be possible to travel by bus, but wich bus isn't said. So take bus 37 from Hawkins Street and ask the driver witch station to leave the bus. ;-) 

If we'll travel Ireland again, this won't be our last visit at Castleknock Hotel. Thanks for the service.",5,2009,08,19
223,quiet but you have to be careful about the early morning traffic,quiet relaxing place - great food in the restaurant - awful in the bar. of course theres a big difference in cost but the bar food was just awful. definitely worth dining in the restaurant idf you can afford it. nice peaceful feel to the hotel - shame about the city-bound traffic on weekdays. great swimming pool and fitness club,4,2009,06,12
223,Avoid like the plague,"My wife and I stayed for a weekend for a familly party, we thought we would give a local hotel a chance, We have stayed in hotels all over the world and this was by far the worst ever. The catering staff were slow, lacked knowledge of the food and in particular wines on the menu, to the extent of not even knowing which was red or white, the food on the A La Carte menu was terrible,service incredibly slow and surly, we had to return the creme brule twice as it came out like scrambled egg,before abandoning the restaurant completely out of frustration. We aired our justfied complaints and I had a call from the food and bev manager assuring I would hear from him the following week. I am still waiting!!  Just an awfull experience, do not got there.",1,2009,06,11
223,will not return,"Myself, my husband & our 15 month old daughter have just returned from a midweek 3 night stay in the Castleknock Hotel-our experience was definitely not 4 star. To begin with the room allocated to us was abit small considering we had a travel cot & the double bed-there was no iron& ironing board in the room. Half of the lights didn't work & the heating in the room was far too hot & could not be controlled manually . We ate in the open bar lobby the first night &  both of us had the steak ciabatta -which on the menu stated that it came with chips-however when we eventually got it it came with crisps!!! Breakfast the following morning was also far from even 3 star standard. the heating throughout the whole hotel ( in the lobby etc) was unbearably too hot.  On one evening we returned from the city & we decided to just have tea & desserts which took up to 40 minutes-Which brings me to the point about the staff been very slow & not very helpful even though it was not that busy .
I could not reccomend this hotel to anyone following our experience & we will definitely not return.",2,2009,06,10
223,Lovely room and great facilities.,Room is nice and spacious and clean with big bathroom. Swimming pool is relaxing and clean. Staff are friendly and helpful. Room service food was ok nothing fantastic. I had a lamb salad one night that was very average and the salad leaves were old brown and wilting. Another night I also had the fillet steak which was abit dry and had no special sauces offered. Gym and golf and other great facilities.,4,2009,06,09
223,Very comfortable hotel,"Stayed one night here with with my husband and young daughter. The staff were very friendly, the room spacious and comfortable. We used the swimming pool which was a big hit with my little girl. We slept well, undisturbed by a salsa class which we knew was going on downstairs. Our breakfast was delicious - a real change from the usual buffet fare, which is often cold and congealed. This was fresh, hot, tasty, and lots of it! Overall, we were very pleased with the hotel and would stay here again.",4,2009,05,29
223,Very Average,"Customer service very poor. Loud music kept us awake. Alot of waiting at breakfast time. If you book a package ""deal"" you will not be in the main restaurant and the menu is limited. When we complained got no satisfaction at all!!",2,2009,05,21
223,SHEER BLISS,"my friend & i stayed here on 24th & 25th april, its our annual spa break where we leave the hubbys & kids at home. this hotel was bliss to say the least, everything was wonderful from start to finish. the staff were great & nothing was too much trouble at all. we both had beauty treatments (my friend had a back massage, i had indian head massage) which were gorgeous!! the spa staff were excellent & i would highly recommend a treatment. the pool, jacuzzi etc were lovely with spotlessley clean changing areas. food was excellent at all times with great service. our room was lovely wih nice comfy beds. we will be back next year or maybe before!",5,2009,05,06
223,Fantastic Stay At Castleknock Hotel & Country Club,"My husband and I spent last weekend at Castleknock  Country Club and we both agree its a fantastic hotel! We had a 2 night b&b package arrived in fri nite and had a meal in the restaurant as it was hubbies birthday- it was fabulous - food, service all of it! spent that nite at the bar which had great selection of drinks/cocktails etc and the bar man was very friendly. Pool and leisure area was lovely and very clean - jacuzzi was fabulous!!!! Unfortunately the spa was booked up on the sat and didnt have time to have a treatment on sunday but there was a great choice on the list of treatments. Bedroom was fab v roomy  and clean all the usual facilities... bed was v comfy!  Staff were very nice and helpful. All in all we had a great stay there would definately recommend it and we will go back!!!!",5,2009,04,28
223,A hidden gem,"Stayed in Castleknock Hotel last week on a midweek deal I got on the internet. Couldn't believe it when I got there. Because the price was so low maybe my expectations weren't too high, but it was great. The lobby is bright and welcoming. The reception staff were a pleasure to deal with. In fact all the staff were just great. We had all our meals in the hotel and couldn't fault a thing. The food was definitely some of the best we tasted in any hotel as usually hotel restaurants are not as good as stand alone ones but we were extremely impressed. the staffs warm and pleasant attitudes obviously rubbed off on the other guests as we sat in the residents lounge one night and everyone was singing, it was like a family gathering yet we were all complete strangers. The only drawback was it was a bit off the beaten track, but then again thats part of its charm. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel and we will definitely back.",5,2009,04,24
223,Lovely hotel - great deal!,"We booked 2 nights B&B including an evening meal and complimentary bottle of wine for ‚Ç¨99-00 each which was a fantastic deal.  The hotel is a bit out of the way so a car
is a must but the interior is lovely and the rooms are large and well decorated - but no mini-bar which for a 4 star hotel is a bit unusual.
We ate in the Bar on the Sat night and the food was very good and when we looked at the prices on the A La carte were extremely relieved dinner for that night was included!
The only complaint we had and this sounds crass - were the really uncomfortable chairs in the brasserie/bar they are strange moulded plastic - like something you would find in McDonalds and so uncomfortable.
The Park Restaurant looked beautiful but the prices put us off.
Staff were really nice, helpful and accomodating.
Would recommend this hotel but if you are price conscious try and get a deal including dinner otherwise bring a lot of euros!",4,2009,04,15
223,excellent hotel all round,very impressed with this hotel . Nice quiet location . welcoming lobby . polite staff at check-in and throughout hotel . room and bathroom very spacious and spotlessly clean . We had a nice view of golf course which I had asked for prior to arrival.  A meal was included in the package . have to say it was the nicest meal I  have enjoyed in an hotel for a long time . relaxing music playing in dining room also.  Only thing I found was pool was small  - however changing room area and facilities very clean.  Very calm atmosphere within hotel .,5,2009,04,11
223,"Lovely hotel, look forward to bringing the family here",My wife and myself stayed here for 1 night in March on an overnight in Dublin. From the moment we arrived at reception to having a lovely meal in the bar the welcome and service was excellent. Value was very good to. Our room was lovely and very clean. To complete the visit we had a lovely breakfast the next morning. A great location just outside Dublin city particularily if you are visiting the North or West side.,5,2009,03,17
223,Great Hotel,"My partner and i stayed here at the end of Feb for our 3 year anniversary. The hotel itself is stunning with excellent views and a nice location. It is abit out of the way from everything but we knew that before going. Bus route about a ten minute walk and takes about 40minutes to get into Dublin town. Although the first day we were there we did walk 40 minutes to a bus stop and home as its not signposted, so make sure you ask at reception for the directions, they were really helpful and professional throughout our stay. The facilities were excellent and the food was gorgeous, couldnt fault it at all. Found everything about Dublin really expensive but the euro is so weak at the moment.
My partner proposed to me whilst there which topped the saty of even more.
Would definately go back to the hotel again in the future.

If you do want to ask any questions please feel free to message me : )",4,2009,03,08
223,Great break - would go back!,"I stayed in the Castleknock hotel for 3 nights at the end of February.  It was mid week so the hotel wasn't too busy.  We got a little lost on the way to the hotel as the road signs were not clearly visible in the dark!  But once there we were able to check in to our room.  We had a few problems with internet access in the room and key cards but they were quickly resolved when we contacted reception.  The food in the hotel was lovely.  We experienced a bit of a blip on the last day when we ordered food in the lobby and the wrong order was sent to the table, however the food, when it arrived made up for it. The facilities at the hotel were great - they require you to wear a swimming hat in the pool (so bring one along if you have one already).  We also made use of the gym which is well equipped.  My only complaint would be the heat of the room during the night.  There was no way to regulate the temperature!  Overall though, I would recommend the hotel and would definitely go back given it's proximity to dublin but yet with a country feel.",4,2009,03,03
223,Best Meal I have ever had,"We booked the hotel because one of our children had a diving comp in a local pool.  We stayed in a family room. The room itself was lovely.  It was very spacious and clean.  The hotel is fairly new.  On Saturday we had dinner in the park resturant.  Both myself and wife had steaks.  It was the best meal I have had in a long time. Everything about it was perfect.

The hotel itself is a little out of the way but this was perfect.  They have a lovely leisure club and a beauty salon.  Also attached to the hotel is a golf course.  It looks lovely.

Overall the weekend was fabulous and I would really recommend a break in the hotel..",5,2008,11,13
223,will return! great stay,"Myself and my girlfriend stayed here in late October, We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel. The staff were really helpful and friendly, We had  Dinner included in our rate, which was excellent value for money! the dinner in the Park Restaurant was Delicious.  we had full use to the leisure centre which was very relaxing, and the view from the swimming pool is amazing. We stayed in an executive King room which we loved. the room was very spacious, modern and extremely clean. we will definatley return very soon. i would recommend this hotel to couples looking for a great weekend break.",5,2008,11,06
223,"Nice surroundings, service poor","Stayed here whilst visiting some relatives.  Lovely location on the outskirts of  (west) Dublin.  A bit remote if you don't have transport.  Taxis would probably be your main way of getting around otherwise.  Cost us ‚Ç¨10 from here to Blanchardstown Centre (shopping) which was only 10/15 mins away.  

Rooms were nice enough - hotel is fairly new (3/4 years?) and modern, so few problems there.  

Service at the bar / restaurant was was where the hotel fell down BADLY.  Nice airy stylish lobby where bar food is available.  Menu is terrible (very small choice and poor value for the quality).  The chicken ""goujons"" turned out to be frozen processed ""nuggets"", yuck.  Burger was definitely processed, fish was just ok.  Service was poor to awful:  we had to search out a waiter ourselves and after that it was snail slow.  No proper management supervision, that we could tell.  We were going to try the Steak Restaurant, but after the poor experience of the bar food, we decided to head out.  Our advice - go to either Castleknock Village or Blanchardstown for better restaurants.  We had a fab meal for a great price at The Twelfth Lock (take note of the good service here!) and were sorry we didn't know they had accomodation also.  

Leisure centre (pool/gym) here is nice, and probably why they charge a bit more than some other hotels nearby.  However, it's not available to families with children after 6pm, which was when we generally returned back and would have enjoyed it...!  Golf course on site here also, which we didn't try.

Overall, not bad value for the location and standard, if only the food and service came up to standard.  Go out for your evening meals and if you don't want or need the Leisure Centre (or Golf) then better value elsewhere...",3,2008,10,07
223,Luxurious & peaceful,"Stayed here for a weekend in August, had a lovely dinner in the restaurant which was very fancy.  The room was great, spacious, bed very comfie, gorgeous bathroom with a separate shower.  No faults with breakfast, plenty to choose from and staff really helpful.  The reception, foyer area is lovely and relaxing with really modern seating areas.  I would definately stay here again & have recommended to friends.  It is away from the town but its definately worth staying in.",5,2008,09,10

Would definately recommend staying here.

Obviously not close to city centre however.",5,2008,09,04
223,excellent value,"We stayed in the hotel in August mid week. It offered great value for money, good rooms, excellent bathroom, very clean. The staff are very friendly and helpful and the pool is wonderful. Breakfast is self service but offers a good choice and is hot and well cooked. Coffee and tea would be nicer in a pot rather than self service. Lots of parking available but it is out of town. It is very near shopping centre, zoo etc so excellent for families wanting short break. Good restaurants in Castleknock and Blanchardstown that would suit children. Will stay here again.",5,2008,08,15
223,Great hotel Pity about the food,I stayed here on a weekend break package. This package was well worth the money for the quality of the hotel. But the Breakfast wasn't up to much it was ok but everything was self service and the cooked breakfast was all deep fried. There were pots of tea already made and you had to ask for toast to be got for you. We had a meal in the restaurant as part of our package which was ok. We had guests with us and they had to eat of a different menu to us which was well over priced for what you got. In fact it was a complete rip off. As a hotel on a package it was very comfortable but my advice would be eat somewhere else for dinner.,3,2008,08,03
223,Lovely hotel shame about the restaurant,This is a lovely hotel in a great location but the food in the restaurant is very overpriced and not great for such a high standard hotel. Very dissapointed,2,2008,08,02
223,Great alternative to Dublin if you have a car,"We had a room rate here of E86 which we felt was excellent value for a 6 Nations Rugby Weekend.  OK, you are rather north of the action but with a car it is no problem at all.  The hotel has a pleasant ambiance and the bedrooms are large and very well furnished with separate bath and shower.  Overall, this hotel exceeded our expectations for the price paid.  Only negative was being overcharged for bar food but this appeared to be a genuine mistake and was suitably rectified.",4,2008,02,24
223,Great Hotel - Good Value,I have just returned from a 3 day stay here and feel compelled to write a complimentary review. From check in to check out everything was spot on. The room was large and had all the facilities you would expect in a modern hotel - the bed was extremely comfortable and the bathroom facilities were excellent. Although the bar was extremely quiet each night I was there the bar staff were chatty and very friendly. I had the carvery lunch each day and bar food each night and found both to be delicious and extremely good value. The gym and leisure centre facilities were top notch as was the adjoining golf course (although this isn't part of the hotel complex they did offer a preferable green fee rate for hotel guets) i've stayed in many other 4 star hotels that were nothing of the sort but this one lived up to its billing. I'll be back as Arnie would say!,5,2008,02,07
223,What a  let down.,"We have just returned from Castleknock Hotel and country club on the 22nd of October 2007. I had booked the hotel after reading reviews from this website for my first wedding anniversary.
 We booked the Romantic Break -2night B&B plus 1 Dinner deal.
On arrival the hotel looked really good. When we checked in at 2pm the room wasn't ready and we sat a waited for 30 mins while it was prepared.
 We were then given our room keys and found that our room was not how we expected it had a terrible view of a roof , when we opened the window there was a large extractor fan that was very loud so the window had to be kept shut. 
The deal was supposed to include "" robes, slippers, bottle of champagne and many extra touches."" There was nothing . At this point we went back to reception to ask about this. The woman on reception was very nice and told us that there were no better rooms available as there was a wedding and that she would send up robes , we explained that it was our anniversary and expected more, she sent up a fruit bowl and a cheap bottle of fizzy white wine.
We went down for some cocktails and drinks at the bar , it was very busy with only 2 members of staff- we waited 40 minutes for our drinks- the focus of the hotels attention is looking after the big functions not the average couple wanting a short break.

During the night there was a constant buzzing noise coming from the hall- it was impossible to get some sleep.
After complaining at reception the advice was to write our thoughts /complaints on the questionnaire in our room and hand it in before we checked out.
Breakfast was fine large selection of freshly cooked food, fruit and pastries.
The evening meal was very nice food selection was pretty small but again the waitress was very friendly and attentive.
Overall this hotel was disappointing- not at all romantic.
I would not go there in the future.",2,2007,10,23
223,superb. simple as that,"i stayed here for my girlfriends birthday. and to be nice the only bad point was her mistaking our room safe. in her own words ""wow we even have our own microwave""

the hotel hadnt opened long when i stayed there and despite its posh look the staff were extremely down to earth (i cant imagine most like the site of a posh hotel being walked into by a guy unshaven, fat guy like me wearing football shirts with runners but they didnt mind me doing that). 

the staff also easily arranged a taxi which arrived right on exactly the second we wanted. the room itself was so good we even debated not going into dublin for the night as planned. the tv and furnishing were very modern with the bathroom also extremely nice.

downstairs the barstaff and bars were excellent and any time i ordered a drink the staff told me to take my seat and they would bring it down to me which they did promptly, leaving us before we even had a chance to tip them. check in staff were extremely lovely too.

ive read some reviews here about the breakfast being poor but i cant understand that at all as we enjoyed it very much. 

although the location didnt cause me any problems it is the only bone of contention most would have. it is just in the middle of nowhere. but i would recommend it big time. if you look hard enough you can get some great deals and ive purchased numerous vouchers as christmas presents for my family whom all agreed with the high standards set here. (the new zealand rugby team were checking in as we checked out so obviously it must be good although the staff didnt allow their service toward them to effect their service to everyone else)

if only there was more like it",5,2007,10,05
223,Small improvements would make the difference,"I e-mailed the hotel 2 weeks before my arrival asking for a late checkout (2pm instead of 12 noon) and I was extremely disappointed not to be allowed this...despite explaining that it was my birthday and I was running a half marathon.  I wouldn't have thought asking to check out 2 hrs late was too much to ask, but it was absolutely denied on the grounds that the hotel was full.  I was told I could have a shower in the leisure centre after my run.

Otherwise:
Got a rate of ‚Ç¨150 from a hotel booking website for double room with breakfast.  Hotel's own website had shown no availability for around a month.  Check-in was efficient and reception staff pleasant.  Unfortunately didn't have charger for new Nokias and didn''t believe me when I told them that the chargers had changed.  It would have been a bonus if they had one-didn't expect it.  They were helpful in explaining how to get to the race the next morning though.
Room was on the first floor and very large but smelt a bit musty/smoky and was freezing.  Took me a while to figure out the 2nd knob on the radiator needed to be turned and there were no instructions.  No airconditioning.   Usual tea and coffee facilities with a couple of small biscuits.  Enormous king size bed which was comfy but pillows only mediocre.  Wake-up call was provided by reception.  Relatively small TV but had a good selection of channels.  Hotel was very busy with a wedding but room was very quiet.
Bathroom was large and had separate bath and shower which was nice.  Toiletries were good quality and got good, fluffy towels.
Breakfast was included in my rate and was served in restaurant downstairs.  There was a self-service continental (cereals, breads, ham, cheeses, some fruit etc) and cooked (usual sausages, bacon, eggs etc) as well as a ""to order"" menu.  I was there at around 7.15am and they hadn't supplied all the food yet.  It came out bit by bit while I was there.  Was able to order porridge though which I really appreciated.  They also had selection like omelettes and pancakes on the ""to order"" menu.
Leisure centre is quite small-especially the pool-but clean and good selection of machines in gym.  Staff here were helpful.

Location is miles away from everything except the Phoenix Park (where the race was).  Nice hotel and some good staff (especially Jim the concierge) but wouldn't rush to stay there again.  I think a little flexibility on their behalf regarding check-out would have left me with a far better impression.",4,2007,10,02
223,Excellent Hotel,"We have just returned from a two day break at this hotel and all i can say is excellent excellent.  When we arrived the front desk staff were very friendly while checking us in.  Our room was brillient very big with seperate bath and shower.  The food is just fab. bar staff are excellent and make fab cocktails.  The pool is small but just right to get rid of that hangover.  Overall this hotel is just perfect for that break away....
",5,2007,08,13
223,Had mixed feelings,"We travelled to the hotel from the airport on the UR bus to castleknock....one piece of advise is that you dont get off the bus in the village centre and then expect to work...it took us an hour following the road signs to the hotel...theres a short cut but im not sure how u get to it from the ur bus stop.

Arriving at the hotel, eventually we were impressed by the decor and the proffessionalness of the staff who sympathetically welcomed us to the hotel after our long walk. 

Our room was on the 2nd floor looking on to the golf course, a small new housing estate that is nearly finished and a large air conditioning unit above the bar which made slight noise throughout the nite. The bathroom was clean and modern with some nice touches like a wet room type shower as well as a seperate bath with another shower unit inside...this was a pretty big bathroom.

As with most hotels in Ireland, this one didnt have air con so we had to sleep with the window open and listen to the humming noise...although u do get used to it.

Breakfast is served till 11 on weekends but there wasnt much left when we arrived...pretty standard stuff really..the staff werent the most conversational but that was more than made up for the waffles which can be ordered...as for the actual Irish breakfast as I said there wasnt really much left.

As part of our package we were doing B&B for two nights with dinner on the final nite...we were on a table d'haute menu which did the job and all of the food was well presented along with the stylish lids that they carried all the meals in...dinner was well served with very good staff.

Breakfast the next morning again was a messed up affair..with the hot food in a seperate room I dont think that the staff checked on it often which is why is didnt have much left again...the continental breakfast wasnt the best either although they did offer kippers and salmon.

On leaving our room we noticed that the room opposite had a bowl outside the door to collect a leak in the roof from a couple of rain showers...it wasnt a particularly heavy downpour and the leak was next to a lightbulb.

We spent the last afternoon in the swimming long after we had checked out...its a good pool with gym and other facilities..take ur own swimming cap if u dont want to pay 2.50 for a hotel one.

Overall this was a real mixed bag...i think I would go back if the slight improvements were made.

223,Excellent Hotel,"We have just returned from a long weekend away in Dublin. We stayed at the Castleknock Hotel and couldn't fault it.

Staff
All staff were very friendly and helpful throughout our stay.

Rooms
Very clean, modern and comfortable. Lovely decor.

Food
2 restaurants were fairly pricey, so we just ate bar snacks when we were there. Fantastic bar food, the best Burger I've ever had !! Good range of very reasonably priced bar food, with fab table service and very relaxed seating area. Buffet breakfasr was great.

Leisure
The pool was lovely, really relaxing, clean and fab changing and showering facilities.

Children
We had our 3 year old with us. They put an extra bed in our room free of charge and didn't charge for breakfast. It was extremely child friendly.

Would definately recommend highly !!",5,2007,01,24
223,Noisy hotel!,"Stayed 2nights here, great value of 99euros including breakfast. Rooms are clean and well furnished. BUT having spent a busy day out in the city, I just wanted to sleep! I was wakened up twice by drunks(once at 2am and once at 4.30am)! The first disturbance lasted few minutes, whilst the second incident was a bit scary! Imagine hearing a women sobbing outside your door at 4.30!!! She started to sob quietly, security came and she started yelling and screaming! It isn't really the hotels faults, staff were helpful and courteous....but Im not the only one that has complaints about the noise in the hotel in the past.
",2,2007,01,10
223,Great facilities,"Contrary to other reviewers we found this hotel easily from the motorway, as it is signposted. We found it excellent value at 99 Euros for a double room including buffet breakfast. We made use of the swimming pool and gym including a steps session. We also got 10% off treatments in the beauty salon. We had our own car and found it useful to park in Phoenix Park and walk to a tram stop to get to the centre of Dublin.

Nearby is the hugh Blanchardstown shopping centre and leisure complex.

The staff were friendly, helpful and knowldgable. Definitely would stay there again.
",5,2006,11,30
223,Great until breakfast,I stayed in this hotel for one night and it got off to a great start. The decor is great. The girl at reception was very friendly and helpful. The room was spacious and well decorated and the bathroom pristine. We were served food and drink in the lobby by a polite and attentive young man.  We later dined in the brasserie where the food was good. The restaurant was quiet but had they been busy I might have found the tables tightly-packed. Everything really went well until breakfast. As this was our last experience of the hotel it's a bit of a shame as it just leaves a so-so impression. They seemed to be under-staffed on a Sunday morning. We would have liked to have ordered off the breakfast menu but there just wasn't any service. We settled for the hot buffet but most of the trays were empty so we had to queue. It reminded me of a school canteen and I'd hoped for better. When we were eventually approached by a server - when we'd finished - we were offered tea or coffee. We both chose tea but there was only a cup and a half of cold tea left in her pot. It took another fifteen minutes to get the second cup filled. In all it was certainly reasonable for the price we paid. The location is nice. It's closer to Dublin city centre than you might imagine from it's parkland setting but it's not walking distance and you will be reliant on your own transport or a taxi service. Great for a golfing/spa weekend but not for a night out in Dublin city. Also beware of the families with young kids in the lobby on a Sunday afternoon - think TGI Fridays!,3,2006,11,21
223,"Comfortable, modern hotel and resort","We enjoyed our stay at the Castleknock Hotel and Country Club when we stayed there for a week at the end of July 2006.  The staff was very helpful and friendly and tried to make our stay a good one.  The rooms were big, clean and the beds were very comfortable.  The bathroom was bright, modern and roomy.  The breakfasts were buffet style with a selection of cold and hot dishes, cheeses, fruits, pastries, assortment of beverages, cold cuts, fish.  

As a resort, they provide a health club complete with classes and a pool.  Regretfully, we never got to try the pool.  There's lots of free parking available on site.  There is a golf course on site but never tried the course.  

The hotel is not located in city centre of Dublin so it's not convenient if you want to go into Dublin every day.  There is a public bus you can take that picks up within a 5 minute walking distance from the hotel.  That bus can take you into Dublin and back.  Otherwise, taxis can be ordered by the concierge.  If you need to be north of the Liffey river and in western part of Dublin, it's a convenient location.

Items on their lunch and dinner menus are pricy and sometimes if there are a lot of guests, the staff becomes overwhelmed.  This place does cater a lot of weddings and receptions and sometimes it can get noisy.  Overall, a very good stay.
",4,2006,11,16
223,"The good, the bad and the annoying","I stayed at the Castleknock in late July along with a group from the U.S.

The good:  The facility is beautiful, the decor lovely, and the room comfortable.  The bath was luxurious for Ireland.  I particularly enjoyed the mid-century modern retro decor and the open common areas on the ground floor.

The bad:  

1.  Where the heck is this place?  I had NO IDEA where I was located as compared to Dublin City.  Our tour group went back and forth several times, and it seems we went a different route each time.  I felt very disoriented and, frankly, cut off from civilization.  There are no shops within walking distance.

2.  Only one vending machine in the place, and it is in the gym.  

3.  No a/c.  It was hot in Ireland this summer.  The room was fine in the evening with the windows open, but the hallways and common areas were warm.

The annoying:  Weddings!!!!  Every night for threee nights there was a very loud, drunken wedding party in the hotel.  My room was over the front entrance, and it seems that's where the wedding guests congregated to smoke, drink and have raucous conversation.  That's fine at 10 pm, but by 2 am it is REALLY annoying.  The hotel staff did nothing - clearly weddings are their bread and butter business, and not serving American tourists.  Fair enough.

Overall:  If you are a local planning a wedding, it's perfect for you.  If you are a tourist, look for someplace in Dublin City proper.
",3,2006,10,17
223,An Alarming Hotel,"This is a difficult hotel to find if you are not familiar with the local area and would I really recommend you take a print out of the directions from the hotel website otherwise you could be driving around for hours. The traffic in and around Dublin can be diabolical and the roads and signposting could be better!

Once you arrive at the hotel they will make every effort to find you a room even if you arrive very early. The rooms are arranged over 2 floors with some long corridor walks if you are housed in the side rooms. The rooms, like the hotel, are modern and well kept. They are of a good size with flat screen TVs and good tea/coffee making facilities. The large bathrooms have a bath and separate shower and good quality toiletries are provided. The comfortable double beds are huge and we heard little noise at night except for the fire alarms ‚Äì more of that later!

 All the staff we met, other than one night manager, were efficient, very helpful and friendly. The breakfasts during the weekend were of a buffet style and I can honestly say they were the best I have encountered in this type of hotel ‚Äì the food was hot and not the congealed mess often encountered. On the Monday morning, when there were fewer guests, the breakfast was cooked to order and served at the table. We did not take any other meals in the restaurant so I cannot comment of the quality but I would say that, in common with a lot of large, modern hotels, the public rooms are a little soulless and do not have a intimate atmosphere.   

The hotel is obviously used a great deal for wedding receptions and other private parties and this caused problems on the first 2 nights of our 3 night stay when the fire alarms were set off in the early hours. On the first night the alarm, which were very loud in bedrooms, went on for about 15 seconds only ‚Äì although we got up we did not evacuate. On the Saturday night the alarm went on for several minutes and because we could not raise anyone in Reception by phone, we got dressed and evacuated the hotel. However, when we walked around the outside of the hotel we could see that the late night parties were still in full swing. When we got to the reception, along with a number of other guests, we were told that one of the party guests had thought it would be good fun to set the alarm off. What was worrying were the remarks of the night manager who said it was a common problem in Dublin and they could do nothing about it. The reason why no one was manning reception was because they had all gone to see if it was a real fire. It appears that the hotel makes the assumption that fire alarms are false unless confirmed by a member of staff. In my opinion, the assumption should be that alarms are real and evacuation should take place without delay.  

We enjoyed staying at this hotel and, if it were not for the fire alarm fiasco, I would have awarded it top marks.

223,"Loved it so much, having wedding reception here!","I stayed at this hotel last year for a friend's wedding reception and thoroughly enjoyed my stay.  The facilities were excellent, the rooms extremely spacious and comfortable and the food served at the wedding banquet was amazing.  I often returned to the hotel for lunches also and loved the decor and atmosphere in the place and the fact that the staff were always so efficient and friendly.

When I got engaged last year my first choice for the reception was the hotel as I held it in such high regard.  The staff cannot do enought to help out and now in the weeks leading up to the event, they are proving invaluable in terms of the help they are giving us.  There are event managers, planners and waiting personnel ready to answer any question and offer advice.

I heartily recommend this establishment and will be more than delighted to post a further review after the big day in November.

223,gets better every time,"We have just returned from a weekend break in this fine hotel.Although about 6 kilometers from the city a quick drive through the Phonex Park will have you in the city with in 15 minutes.Spacious rooms and fine view of the golf club makes this place a plesent and quiet hotel to stay in for those who just want to chill out for a weekend.The leisure complex compliments the hotel and fine food in both restraunt and bar even makes it better.This is our second visit there and not our last.

223,"A stylish, modern hotel","I stayed at the Castleknock Hotel and Country club with my family towards the end of August, 2006. The Hotel was lovely, with modern and stylish decor. The hotel is a few miles outside Dublin and seems as if in the Countryside. However, the hotel is always bustling, where weddings and conferences were held throughout our stay. This did not affect our stay what so ever and we could not hear any partying in our bedrooms and we had very peaceful nights sleep. There were two bars and a lounge at the hotel all decorated tastefully. There was also a brasserie and a restaurant. The brasserie was modern and more laidback than the restaurant because of the decor although had very proffessional staff and the food was very nice. The Park Restaurant's decor was much more elegant. The breakfasts were very nice and plenty of choice with full irish and continental breakfasts.
The rooms were well equipped with a safe, trouser press and for the very first hotel I've stayed in had a seperate shower cubicle and bath. The decor was very simple compared with the downstairs although inkeeping with the rest of the hotel.
The staff were proffessional but friendly and helpful. And one thing I also noticed was that there was plenty of parking spaces. The leisure centre was very well equipped with a modern gym, Jacuzzi, large pool, steam room and sauna.
The only negative point I found was finding the place. The hotel is set in a beautiful area with surrounding golf course and greenery but because of this the hotel is hard to find. Once you find it once you're fine but the first time is a bit challenging.
",4,2006,09,14
223,Absolutely stunning,"I've stayed in Castleknock a few times - for work and on the way to the airport, going on holidays. It's gorgeous, just perfect. I have to say, one of the best places I've ever stayed in. Rooms are extremely spacious and comfortable, so is the bathroom. The hotel decor, in the rooms and public areas, is really glamorous. The waffles at breakfast are yummy! The restaurant is a bit overpriced and not much going for it, but it's a hotel restaurant after all... There is an extensive car park and, being in the end in the middle of nowhere, it's really quiet. Just one negative remark: maybe my sense of direction is incredibly bad, but I was there 4 times and the 2 times we drove there, it took us hours to get there, lost as we where in Dublin suburbs... the 2 times i got a taxi, oh boy, the drivers had no clue of where they were going (thank god the fee was on the company!)... Definitely go there, but consider GPS navigation (:!
",5,2006,08,05
223,Nice place,"The Castleknock Hotel was a pleasant surprise. I was travelling for business and chose my hotel based on location (the hotel is not far from Ballycoolin). My room was spacious and clean, and the pool area and gym were great. The area is a bit blah, so I wouldn't recommend it to tourists unless you just want to golf. The bus ride in to Dublin can take an hour during rush hour. The breakfast was good, but at other meals I found the restaurant a bit overpriced and blah (though Irish food in general is not usually spectacular). There is a local pub and a fish & chips shop a short walk from the hotel. All of the staff members I had contact with in the gym, restaurant, and front desk were very pleasant and helpful.
",4,2006,06,07
223,An Excellent Choice - Great Hotel with Fabulous Staff,"Just returned from an excellent stay at the Castleknock Hotel & Country Club.  The hotel is rated properly as a 4-star hotel - new and modern, and extremely clean and well-kept.  I stayed 2 nights there, paying 99 Euro (weekday rate), and for the price I find it a well-kept secret amongst hotels in Dublin City.  Rooms are modern and well equipped, with large comfortable beds, work area, and ensuite bathrooms with bathtub and separate shower.

The hotel exudes a contemporary charm from the moment you drive in, with a sunflower and sky blue exterior color scheme that is pleasing to the eye.  Inside, you'll feel comfortable, with lounging areas in the central part of the hotel.  The bar is open and inviting, with friendly service and a nice view of the outdoor terrace.  Near to the bar,  the restaurant serves excellent food and has staff willing to please.

Don't forget the leisure centre, which is one of the best I've seen in Ireland.  The exercise room is fully equipped for all athletes, with new and latest weight training equipment, dumbbells, and plenty of treadmills and elliptical trainers.  And the pool is extraordinary - absolutely stunning and fun to wade in.  Staff have all your needs taken care of, even swim trunks if you need them.  All the other frills are there - sauna/steam, exercise rooms - great stuff.

The golf course, only opened last year, is a fun, resort-like layout that is a good challenge for an accomplished golfer, but will allow forgiveness for beginning players, too.  It is highly maintained - putting surfaces smooth and consistent, and excellent fairways, tees and greens.  As newly planted trees mature, this course will become even better.  The 18th hole, par 3, is a signature hole over water to a green surrounded by a stone wall on 3 sides - a great ending to a great round of golf.

During my stay, the well-trained staff did everything possible to accomodate me and insure that my time at the hotel was pleasant and fun.  So thanks again to Ciara, Valerie and Jennifer, who were fabulous and fun!

You could stay in many hotels in Dublin, pay a boatload of money, and get up-and-down types of service.  Or you could venture just a few miles west of the city centre, and get a fantastic hotel experience at the Castleknock Hotel!  My future stays will be at Castleknock!

Great job to the Castleknock Hotel Staff!
",5,2006,04,26
223,Castleknock is up for the craic!,"When we visited this hotel last year we could not believe what a fantastic hotel they have built. 

Honestly, it is the best hotel in Dublin. It may not be easy to find, but once you have and once you get your bearings, no problem!

Everything is positive:
 accomodation (some rooms are a walk but can help the calorie controlled diet), 
 facilities, 
 food: Some reviewers here did not like the food; we have to disagree. Breakfast fills you up through to lunch, evening meal, a small menu but to a high standard.
 staff (from our point of view, were knowledgable about their locality).

Ensure you plan time in their leisure facilities.

Seemed to be the 'in' place for weddings

Last year introductory offer of 99 euros because it had just opened. Full price this year in July 119 euros. Bargain!

Looking to return this year. Hope to see you there!",4,2006,04,20
223,Gorgeous Modern Hotel with excellent staff,"This new hotel is excellent! We stayed for the All-Ireland football weekend and were delighted with our time there. The staff are more than welcoming & helped me take my 8mth old daughter swimming for the first time- which she loved as the pool was heated. The rooms are modern & spacious, and the bars/restaurants are very good. My father assures me the Golf Course is excellent too. Its a 15min taxi ride from Temple Bar/City Centre, which is handy for shopping & 'socialising', but far enough away to be assured of a good nights sleep. All in all a really nice break.",5,2006,03,28
223,Excellent value for money,"This is an excellent hotel. The facilities in the hotel are excellent and the staff are very friendly. The leisure centre is very well equipped and the pool area is very good. The bedrooms and bathrooms were of a high standard and very well finished. If you are happy to drive to the diiferent parts of Dublin you are wishing to visit then this is an ideal hotel.The one drawback was the service in the hotel was on the slow side

223,Lovely clean modern hotel,"Went to stay in the hotel at the end of February for a much neeeded break.  The location was lovely - out in the country, but yet not too far from the city.  The staff we encountered were mostly irish and very pleasant.  The only downside was our room - we were in room 250 which was miles away from the elevator and a bit of a treck from my friends room who were with us and booked under the one reservation.  We ate in the bar area and had a bar meal,  i didnt think the menu was brilliant but you could probably find something you like.  i had a steak sandwich @ ‚Ç¨12 which wasnt bad and we all shared a combination platter for starters for ‚Ç¨30 which was lovely but pricey. I was dissappointed in the open plan design of all the restaurants as the website led me to believe there was be loads of selection, but really al the pubs and food areas are as one.  However the lesiure side of it was lovely with a well equiped gym and lovely pool area.  The rooms were spotless, lovely decorated with duvets instead of sheets and a seperate power shower!! very nice.  The breakfast was also delicious with a wide selection in buffett style - you can even get ommletts or waffles and syrup!!  If you visit this hotel I recommend visiting Blanchardstown S.C.which is only a 5min drive away and has all the best shops - far better than Dundrum!  I would definetly visit again, but perhaps eat out elsewhere for dinner.
",4,2006,03,02
223,Great escape from the city!,"Just got back from staying at the hotel for a Friday night with my fiance. I was looking around Dublin city for a nice hotel with room service which would not break the bank. This hotel was all this and a lot more! I got an excellent deal direct from the hotel for an executive room (slightly bigger double room that the standard). The room was big and immaculate with all the usual trimmings and a super bathroom.
We decided to go to the restaurant but it was booked out which is always a good sign, but they immeadiatly gave us a menu to take with us so that we could have dinner served in our room if we liked. The room service menu was excellent, but obviously there was a bit more selection on the restaurant menu. Food was delivered quickly to our room and was excellent.
I would definitely recommend this hotel as it is close to the city and about half the price of the city centre hotels of the same standard.
Only comment is that it can be a little tricky to find the hotel if you do not know the area, so get a taxi!
",5,2006,02,20
223,Nice new option in West Dublin,"I can't vouch for the 'country club' end of it, but the hotel itself was very nice with a good array of amenities. 

We stayed overnight for a company function.  The room was very nice...modern, clean and spacious.  Nice sized bathrooms are well kitted out.  Service was excellent...everyone we encountered was very friendly and quick to help us out.

The food is the only thing holding me back from calling this hotel 'excellent'.  Afternoon room service was fast but the food was nothing to write home about. The banquet itself was set up well with great service...but the food was pretty dismal.  Both the steak and salmon could have been made into shoes.  That being said, the buffet breakfast was pretty solid, with a nice selection of fruit, cheeses and hot entrees.

I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the hotel...just make sure you don't arrive with an empty stomach!",4,2006,01,24
223,Short stay,"Extremely clean and welcoming hotel. Excellent breakfast.

223,Sein und Schein,"Von au√üen und auch in der Lobby ein mehr als mond√§nes Erscheinungsbild. Gro√ües Hotel au√üerhalb Dublins mit anliegendem Golfplatz. Einzelzimmer sehr bescheiden, wenig modern, etwas abgeranzter Teppichboden, sehr kleines Bad mit megaenger Dusche und Toilette, die so nah an der Wand ist, dass man kaum vern√ºnftig darauf Platz nehmen kann. Ich m√∂chte nicht sagen, dass es schlecht ist, nur dass man sich f√ºr ‚Ç¨ 150 die Nacht etwas mehr Komfort erwartet. Bar und Restaurant prima, Fr√ºhst√ºck sehr britisch.",3,2023,04,19

223,Breve fuga,"Hotel scelto per il rapporto qualit√† prezzo, le sue 4 stelle sono pienamente meritate, stanze comode ben arredate, molto curata la pulizia, il personale e disponibile l‚Äôhotel √® situato in periferia della citt√†, questo a mio avviso √® l‚Äôunico inconveniente per chi decide di soggiornare senza l‚Äôauto a seguito, una sola linea di trasporto pubblico e dista 5/10 minuti a piedi, ci vogliono 40/50 minuti per raggiungere il centro e il servizio dura fino alle 23, pertanto voler fare vita notturna costringe all‚Äôutilizzo dei taxi con relativo costo pari a euro 20/25. Il mangiare √® all‚Äôaltezza della categoria, la colazione √® abbondante anche se c‚Äô√® una prevalente preferenza per la clientela locale, intendo dire uova, bacon, salsicce, frittata, uova fritte, ogni genere di affettati e formaggi, mentre per noi italiani cornetti, marmellata, burro e caff√® e cappuccino che stranamente sono buoni a differenza del loro caff√® servito in tutta Dublino.

223,Ottimo Hotel,"Distante circa 10 km dal centro di Dublino, questo Hotel gode di una posizione lontana dal caos e dalla confusione. Circondato da un bel campo da golf √® l'ideale per una fuga  alla ricerca della tranquillit√†. Camere ampie , spaziose e ben arredate con bagno grande, letto e cuscini buoni che consentono una buona qualit√† del sonno. Check in e out ottimo per cordialit√† e tempistica. Hall ampissima e confortevole  e servizi aggiuntivi come gym e spa che arricchiscono ulteriormente la valutazione. Da rivedere invece la colazione sia per la presentazione (bacinelle di plastica ricoperte nell'area calda) che per la qualit√† dei prodotti (la pasticceria del tutto mediocre). Personale del servizio colazione e del bar da istruire meglio (sembrano tutti e solo ragazzi della scuola in formazione con poca dimestichezza con il servizio al cliente). Per il resto della struttura gentilezza e cordialit√† presenti. Struttura da consigliare",4,2018,07,20

223,Sch√∂ne Tage im Golfhotel,"Wir waren 3 Erwachsene und insgesamt 3 N√§chte im Castleknock Hotel eingebucht. Es war eine wirklich sehr angenehme Zeit, die von uns gebuchten Standardzimmer entsprachen absolut einem 4 Sterne Hotel. Gerne h√§tten wir nat√ºrlich eine Minibar gehabt, es war aber auch nicht schlimm, dass es diese in unseren Zimmern nicht gab. Die Zimmer waren fantastisch ausgestattet, alles was man braucht, sogar Badewanne und Dusche getrennt. Sehr sauber, auch nach einer Nacht wurde alles akurat geputzt und wieder in seinen Grundzustand versetzt.

Jeden Tag gab es frisches, hauseigenes Wasser, mit und ohne Kohlens√§ure, kostenfrei, auf dem Zimmer. Wir hatten ein Zimmer nach hinten und eines nach vorne und konnten bei beiden Zimmern keinen Unterschied wegen der Lautst√§rke feststellen (Zimmer 127 und 138).

Das Fr√ºhst√ºck, welches inklusive war, hatte eine reichliche Auswahl, es war ein Buffet mit allem was man sich denken kann, f√ºr jeden Geschmack und jeden Hunger etwas dabei, immer frisch.

Auch die Rezeption war bei Ankunft und Verlassen des Hotels sehr bem√ºht und stets freundlich, so konnten wir beispielsweise bei Ankunft fr√ºher als der eigentliche Checkin (normal 16.00 Uhr, wir konnten schon um 13.30 Uhr in die Zimmer) bereits in die Zimmer. Auch Tipps wie man am besten nach Dublin reinkommt wurden reichlich gegeben und eine Wegbeschreibung mitgegeben.

Einziger Wehrmutstropfen war ein Abend, als man die Bar in Anspruch nehmen wollte. Der Kellner igonorierte uns trotzdem wir am Tisch zu Dritt sa√üen und er uns beim Kommen auch gesehen hat. Nach einem TIschwechsel in die Lobby auf ein Sofa sah uns dann eine weitere Bedienung, die uns ebenfalls nicht bediente. Erst als wir eine dritte Person ansprachen sagte dieser zu, sich darum zu k√ºmmern, dass wir Getr√§nke bestellen k√∂nnen. Was soll man sagen, der gute Mann kam nicht wieder und unsere Drinks ebenfalls nicht, es war so um 21.45 Uhr. Ich wei√ü nicht ob es ein Schichtwechsel war aber das Hotel kann so auf jedenfall nichts verdienen, vielleicht hatten wir aber auch eine falsche Vorstellung vom ""bedient werden"". Wioe gesagt, nur ein kleiner Minuspunkt, alle anderen Dinge waren wirklich sehr gut bis ausgezeichnet, Schlafkomfort √ºbrigens auch ausgezeichnet.",4,2018,05,14
223,Bello e confortevole,"La location e‚Äô davvero bella, immersa nel verde (come del resto tutta l‚ÄôIrlanda) si trova all‚Äôinterno del golf club, per gli appassionati di golf una chicca non da poco. All‚Äôinterno dell‚Äôhotel una bella SPA dove troverete tutti i confort del caso compresa una nuova piscina appena rinnovata, quest‚Äôultima inclusa gi√† nella tariffa della camera. Colazione al buffet piuttosto ricca ed indicata per una breakfast internazionale (ottime anche le brioche) e potrete trovare anche un discreto (nulla di eccezionale) caff√® espresso ma del resto non essendo in Italia dobbiamo mantenere un livello di aspettativa basso sul tema espresso. Le camere molto pulite e confortevoli, dotate di accessori come accappatoio, ciabattine monouso, caff√®, te, ecc... consigliato. Buon soggiorno. ",4,2018,04,22
223,Muy justo para el precio,"Hotel situado junto a campo de golf en las afueras de Dubl√≠n, elegido para descanso fin de semana. El relax no fue pleno porque coincidi√≥ con celebraci√≥n boda y hubo bastante ajetreo que imposibilitaba relajarse en salones.
Llave de habitaci√≥n necesaria para utilizar ascensor y pasillos de habitaciones pero nosotros cruzamos pasillos sin ella. No es totalmente seguro entonces lo que ofrecen.
Otro inconveniente es la habitaci√≥n. Reservamos nivel suite de mejor calidad. Nos asignaron la 182 y fue decepcionante ver que no era tal. Era sencillamente una habitaci√≥n doble mas un espacio de sal√≥n en el mismo ambiente que no creo alcanzase calificaci√≥n ni de junior suite. Una suite internacionalmente es una habitaci√≥n separada de un sal√≥n anexo por puerta. Deberia por lo tanto el hotel expresarlo de tal forma en su web o en caso contrario est√°n faltando a la verdad y cobrando por una supuesta calidad no ofrecida. 
No busquen canales TV en Espa√±ol porque no los encontrar√°n, Aparte de Ingl√©s creo hab√≠a uno en Alem√°n o otro en Franc√©s. Ba√±o con jacuzzi y amenities muy completas.
Ten√≠amos incluido desayuno, que era buffet muy variado y excelente calidad. Pedimos si pod√≠an servirnos un capuccino y nos avanzaron que ten√≠a suplemento. Aceptamos y nos lo sirvieron. Cuando fuimos a pagar a la salida del restaurante nos indicaron era un error de la camarera.",3,2018,04,11

E' un hotel di lusso, le camere sono fantastiche, il servizio sempre disponibilissimo e attento alle tue esigenze. Ogni tanto ci vuole una struttura del genere con tutto lo stress che accumuliamo. Posizione fuori citt√†, ma perch√© vi √® annesso un bellissimo golf club.",5,2017,08,13
223,Molto bello,"Molto bello ma un po' svantaggiato dalla posizione non proprio centrale
Per raggiungere Dublino ci  vogliono circa 25 minuti di taxi se non c'√® traffico ma se il taxi lo aspetti in albergo puoi attendere anche 1 ora circa prima che arrivi 
Se ti trovi al centro di Dublino il sabato sera oppure il pomeriggio all'ora di punta rischi di metterci circa 45 minuti per arrivare all'hotel.
Intorno non c'√® nessun posto dove passeggiare o fare anche un minimo di shopping
La prossima volta di certo sceglier√≤ un hotel pi√π centrale.... tanto io a golf non ci gioco",5,2017,06,07

223,Hotel caro para lo que es,"La habitaci√≥n tiene una cama muy grande y confortable. Estuvimos en la habitaci√≥n superior y las vistas dan a una especie de patio interior donde hay basura y ruido.
El ba√±o tiene ducha (que no utilizamos porque ol√≠a mal) y una ba√±era que no tiene mampara con lo cual se sale todo el agua. La limpieza del ba√±o es mejorable.
Desayuno muy bueno. Aparcamiento y wi-fi gratis.
La piscina est√° en obra hasta el a√±o que viene (me parece). Deber√≠an indicarlo en su p√°gina web.
Creo que este hotel es demasiado caro y no se merece este precio.",3,2017,02,27
223,Zwei Stunden warten beim checkin ,"Wir waren mit einer Gruppe von 11 Personen in diesem Hotel. Beim Einchecken wurde uns gesagt das wir uns noch 15-20 Minuten gedulden m√ºssten. Nach weiteren 20 Minuten die gleiche Aussage. Nach 2 Stunden hatten wir genug und gingen geschlossen zur Rezeption, dort wurde uns erz√§hlt sie w√ºrden mit Hochdruck daran arbeiten unsere Zimmer zu s√§ubern. Die Rezeptionisten und der Manager waren sehr unfreundlich und in keinster Weise hilfsbereit. H√§tten Sie uns ein Essen oder ein Bier angeboten w√§re die Sache halb so schlimm gewesen. Die Stimmung war nach Ca. 12 Stunden Anreise im Keller. ",1,2016,09,03
223,Zum Gl√ºck nur eine Nacht,"Nach einem einw√∂chigen Irlandurlaub noch eine Schlussnacht  in Dublin.

Wegen Gro√üveranstalltung im Hotel Krach bis weit in die Nacht. Morgens um 4.00Uhr fing die Heizung an, laute Ger√§usche zu machen.

Die Ausstattung mit B√ºgeleisen, B√ºgelbrett, Hosengl√§tter, Wasserkocher, Badewanne UND Dusche war hervorragend. Dies gilt auch f√ºr den Service. Gegessen habe ich sp√§t abends an der Bar, ebenfalls sehr gut. Auch das Fr√ºhst√ºcksbuffet war sehr umfangreich und hochwertig. Dieses Hotel kann ich nur empfehlen.",5,2015,09,11
223,stupendo!,"Ho soggiornato con la mia famiglia presso questo hotel per tre giorni a fine agosto 2015.
La struttura, anche se lontano dal caos della citt√† di Dublino, √® facilmente raggiungibile. Immersa nel verde, si ha la sensazione di abitare in una vera e propria reggia. Le camere spaziose, pulitissime e con letti grandissimi, per me e mio marito una matrimoniale King e per la mia bambina di 5 anni un matrimoniale. Molto pulito il bagno, arredato sia con vasca che con doccia.
Ottima la colazione, c'era qualsiasi cosa tu desiderassi. Il personale cordiale e disponibile.
Lo consiglio vivamente",5,2015,09,03

Mit den Zimmern waren wir soweit zufrieden, bis auf das die Dichtungen im Bad geschimmelt waren, und die T√ºren mit einem lauten Knall ins Schloss fallen, was das Hotel nicht eben als leises Hotel auszeichnet. ",4,2015,08,08
223,Zwischen Flughafen und Stadt,"Das Hotel liegt ruhig innerhalb einer gro√üen Golfanlage. Es ist sehr gro√üfl√§chig √ºber zwei Stockwerke angelegt, so dass der Weg zum Zimmer je nach Lage zu einer Wanderung werden kann. Die Zimmer sind sehr ansprechend eingerichtet, das Bad ist ger√§umig mit Badewanne und Dusche getrennt. Zimmer und √∂ffentliche Bereiche sind gepflegt. Da Personal ist in allen Bereichen sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. Das Fr√ºhst√ºck ist vielf√§ltig.
Es fahren Busse in die Stadt und zum Flughafen, f√ºr Mietwagen sind ausreichend Parkpl√§tze vorhanden. Als Ausgangspunkt f√ºr Ausfl√ºge in die Umgebung von Dublin ist die Lage g√ºnstig, bei einer reinen St√§dtereise empfiehlt sich sicher eher ein Hotel n√§her zur oder zentraler in der Stadt.

223,Sehr sch√∂nes Hotel,"Das Personal dieses Hotels war √ºberaus freundlich und hilfsbereit. Auf alle unsere Anliegen wurde sofort eingangen und geholfen. Am Abend konnte man in gem√ºtlicher Atmosph√§re zu Abend essen (war sehr gut) und nacher Cocktails mit Live-Musik genie√üen.
Der Wellnessbereich war aucht toll, nur wurde uns hier gesagt, dass f√ºr den Pool Badehauben vorgeschrieben sind welche wir vor Ort um 3‚Ç¨ / St√ºck kaufen konnten, allerdings nachher feststellten, dass einige sie nicht getragen haben.
Falls man mit dem Bus nach Dublin m√∂chte ist in der direkten N√§he eine Haltestelle mit einer Linie ins Zentrum. Entfernung zum Flughafen ist √ºber die Stra√üen ca. 16km und bequem mit dem Taxi zu fahren.

223,kein Schloss - trotzdem sehr sch√∂n,"Der Name Country Club und ""Castleknock"" l√§sst zun√§chst ein Schlosshotel auf dem Land vermuten, au√üer dass ein sch√∂ner Golfplatz angegliedert ist, w√ºrde ich dieses Haus als normales Hotel etwas au√üerhalb von Dublin bezeichnen. (kein Schloss)
Der Eingangsbereich ist gro√ü, die Bar mitten drin und somit sehr laut und zu jeder Zeit voll mit vielen Leuten. Das Fr√ºhst√ºcksbuffet ist offensichtlich recht Irisch, doch die Qualit√§t der Speisen l√§sst zu w√ºnschen √ºbrig. (Spiegeleier √ºber l√§ngere Zeit im Wasserdampf zu geschmacklosen W√ºrstchen) Hier meine Empfehlung: Etwas von der Fr√ºhst√ºckskarte bestellen (kostet nicht wirklich etwas extra) und im angegliederten Restaurant einen Tisch nehmen und schon passt wieder alles. Ansonsten hat das Haus sch√∂ne Zimmer, superspitzenklasse Mitarbeiter (alles wurde immer gleich perfekt geregelt) ein sehr sehr gutes Restaurant mit toller K√ºche. Ja, ein Platz an dem man sich wohl f√ºhlen kann.",4,2012,06,27
