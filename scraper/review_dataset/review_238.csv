238,NOT 5 Star by any measure ,"Spent a 2 night break for my wife's birthday. We were decidedly underwhelmed.
The hotel is in a lovely setting, close to Dublin and the sights of Wicklow.
On the first evening we ate in the Garden Room, supposedly an award winning dining experience. I'm not sure who those judges were. My wife's Caesar Salad was a saucy, cheesy mess with wilted leaves. I had a seafood chowder which if I'm being kind was acceptable. We ordered ribeye and strip loin steaks. Both were absolutely dreadful cuts of meat. Tellingly on the menu the beefs origin is just listed as Irish.
We had a lovely day touring Glendalough and the Wicklow mountains and spent a lovely hour in the very nice pool area. We were very much looking forward to dinner in the 2 Rosette winning Hugos Restaurant. Unfortunately the standard was just as bad/average as the night before. 

We were ignored for 5 minutes by 2 waiters before being seated. Food was just OK but the service was pretty lacking in any finesse. Starters delivered without cutlery. Soup cold in a cold bowl without the stated bread. Mains just dropped on the table while my wife was away. I have also never spent time in a fine dining restaurant with so many visible cobwebs.
The housekeeping staff failed to change our bed linen or even make the bed properly. The room was also quite dusty for a supposed 5 Star establishment.
Overall quite disappointed with the whole experience. Not up to the standard of similar establishments we have stayed in. It is an ok 4 star hotel charging premium 5 Star prices. ",3,2024,10,18
238,Lovely two night break,"Great two night stay in Druid’s Glen. Beautiful place, great staff, Hugo’s restaurant was lovely as was the Garden bar. 
The kids loved it especially the pool, play room and the walking trail. Really relaxing stay and we’ll definitely be back.",5,2024,10,16
238,Beyond Comfortable,"Sleep! I sleep more than 8 hours everytime I stay here. Comfortable beds, blackout curtains, beautiful pillows and wonderful places to go and a gorgeous breakfast. So many wonderful places to visit.  Priceless honestly.",5,2024,10,14
238,Amazing!,"This was the best night away we have had in a long time. We were thrilled to find out we had been upgraded to a suite, very much appreciated! We are in the bar, the food and cocktails were fantastic. We also had spa treatments before checking out, and I didn't want to leave. We will definitely be back! ",5,2024,10,14
238,"Excellent hotel , excellent staff","I have just returned from a night away, we have stayed here 4 or 5 times and love it. We were checked in by Aishling and Katie who are absolutely adorable, so friendly and helpful , one of the girls even went and got us hot towels, they were great . We at3 in the bar which was fab and the service was second to none. The entertainment was brilliant, one man band and he was brilliant, my son loved the pool and the games room. I will definitely return again",5,2024,10,13
238,Otherwise faultless stay ruined by managers attitude,"I am just home from a 3 night stay with my 74 year old mother. I myself have a number of hidden disabilities and have a disabled parking pass. Up until this morning, our stay was faultless. Everyone of the staff were so friendly and good at there jobs. The gentlemen in housekeeping who serviced our room, the ladies doing the turn down service, the staff in the leisure centre, the breakfast staff, the bar staff, and the wonderful reception staff, they were all outstanding. The food was also fabulous, and the hotel was spotlessly clean. Up until this morning, everything was perfect.

On our way down to breakfast this morning in the elevator it moved like normal at first. Then there was a sequence of 3 loud bangs and large jolts before the lift settled. Once we were sure the lift was settled, we started pressing all the buttons to see if it would react, but it was clear it wasn't going to move again. I had left my phone in the room charging, so I used the alarm button on the control panel to get in contact with the lift company who sent an engineer out to us. At this stage we were getting over the shock, feeling a bit sorry for our poor backs that took a beating in the landing, and starting to see the funny side of things. Neither of us could sit on the floor as we'd struggle to get up again, so it was a long wait for the engineer, who got to us about 45 minutes after we got into the lift. He was absolutely lovely to us. Opened the door to let us have a bit of air, before closing it up again to raise us up as we were stuck between floors. Another bit of a bumpy ride, but nowhere near as bad as earlier. At this stage, we can still see the funny side, and are just looking forward to getting out, having a sit down, and taking some painkillers. These things happen unfortunately.

The next time the doors open a manager has stumbled upon the situation. There was still a decent step up to get out as we weren't level with the ground, but the lovely engineer helped us. At this stage if the manager had asked were we OK, and what happened, everything would have been fine. Instead he asked were we on the way down to breakfast, and started leading us through reception as he told us about how the engineer must have cut the electricity to the lift for a couple of minutes while he was servicing it! This wasn't getting the wrong end of the situation, this was blatant lying! I replied that we'd been stuck in there for an hour, and the engineer was only there because we'd rang the alarm bell. At this stage he could have back tracked and asked what had happened, but instead he asked why we hadn't rang reception! At this stage he's walking faster and faster to try and get us out of reception in case we make a scene, and we are physically unable to keep up with him. This doesn't bother him in the slightest. He doesn't stop until he gets to the breakfast room, where he waits for us to ask us our room number. I have no clue by now what it is, but thankfully my mother remembers it, so we are finally led to a seat to ""enjoy"" our breakfast. My hands are shaking, we both feel physically sick, and our backs are really sore. The manager did check a couple of times to see if we wanted more tea, but we were just getting angrier and angrier, and didn't want to make a scene. He also came over at one stage to tell us how he once got stuck in a lift for 10 minutes which didn't improve our mood.

Things go wrong every so often, and I would never judge an establishment based on that. What I do judge them on though is how they react when things go wrong. His default position was to just lie and try and abortion blame to the engineer, without bothering to even find out what happened. It would be unacceptable in any establishment, but in a five star hotel it is absolutely shocking.",1,2024,10,10
238,Mutton Dressed as Lamb,"My husband booked this hotel as a surprise for my birthday and I dread to think how much he spent on it.

Upon arrival it seemed like a typical 3 star establishment. The decor was nice and clean but nothing spectacular. Receptionist was lovely and wished me a happy birthday before directing us to our room.

We stayed in the “superior king guest room” which sounds a lot better than it actually was. Again, it was nice and clean, but nothing spectacular.

My husband had made dinner reservations in the Garden Rooms and Bar at 7 so we decided to go to the pool beforehand. Again, it was nice and clean, but nothing spectacular. Unfortunately it was full of children, or should I say it was full of parents who didn’t look after their children as they were throwing swimming aids at some elderly residents in the pool and blocking entrances to and from the water. Not the hotel’s fault by any means, but certainly made for a less enjoyable experience. They do have family swim times in place to help with this issue, however we didn’t have the luxury of time to benefit from it.

At 7pm we headed down for dinner and approached a maître d' station in the corridor outside Hugo’s restaurant who advised us where the Garden Rooms and Bar was (down the corridor to the left some 30 feet away) so we walked on down and were met by no one for quite some time. Eventually I had to go find a waiter. The waiter looked at his screen then disappeared and came back with the maître d' from Hugo’s several minutes later and she finally proceeded to seat us. Why didn’t she just seat us in the first place? It wasn’t busy and, even if it wasn’t her job to, I think it would’ve been courteous to make sure we were taken care of as the two restaurants are right beside each other.

What followed was one of my husband and I’s worst dining experiences in quite some time. If not ever, if you take pricing into account.

My duck conflict appetiser made me physically ill to the point I wanted to make myself sick in the hotel room later to clear out my stomach. My husband got the chicken Caesar salad which was dry and as cold as my duck conflict. Management might say “Why didn’t you request something else if you didn’t like it?”. Because people don’t want the hassle of that experience. Telling the waiter it’s not nice, having to deal with their reaction, worrying if the kitchen will do something to your food for sending something back - there are many reasons people just smile and say thank you.

For main course I ordered the battered haddock and my husband ordered the chicken supreme. Unfortunately my stomach was already churning from the duck which meant I couldn’t enjoy the fish. However, even if my stomach was fine, the accompanying chips were chewy and awful. The chicken supreme was as dry as the chicken salad and the mashed potatoes were like glue.

Dessert was white chocolate and pistachio opera cake and Bailey’s crème brûlée. I was excited about ordering the opera cake as opera cakes tend to have 8+ layers of different textures. Mine had 4. The crème brûlée was just passable.

The entire meal came to over €100 but really wasn’t worth half that. The only positive thing we can say is our server Roy was very nice. If you’re reading this Roy, a big thank you from both of us.

What’s most baffling to us is the Garden Rooms and Bar was awarded with an AA rosette? I can only assume it was from Alcoholics Anonymous and the person who awarded it to them had fell off the wagon that day.

After that horrible experience we retreated to our room to lie in bed and lament to each other about how disappointed we both were before falling asleep in the fetal position.

We had a nice sleep that night even though the walls are paper thin and you can hear conversations from 4 rooms down. Comfortable bed and there was little to no noise from outside.

After the tragedy of dinner the night before, we really didn’t have high hopes for breakfast. Especially after reading online reviews and the fact breakfast was not included in the original price meaning my husband had to pay an additional €25 each. EACH! €50 for what turned out to be a rather basic buffet breakfast. Everything was ok. Which would be a fine thing to say in a cheap hotel, but at €25 a person it’s simply extortionate.

Once again we retreated to our room after another attack by Druid’s Glen dining to lie in bed in the fetal position and cry.

This is not a hotel we would ever intentionally stay in again or recommend to others. It is mutton dressed as lamb and relies on pretentious prices and faux quality to gauge money from unexpecting customers.

Sad but true.",2,2024,10,01
238,Amazing Hotel,"A truly magic time in a top class hotel. Staff are all brilliant & could not be any more helpful, we'll be back soon!",5,2024,09,30
238,Fantastic experience,"We received incredible service from your receptionist, Ash, during our stay last week for a friend's wedding. Ash was absolutely fantastic—her friendly smile and relaxed, warm personality instantly put us at ease. She has this natural way of making people feel welcome, and it truly stood out to us. We’ve done quite a bit of traveling, and I can honestly say Ash is one of the best hotel staff members we’ve ever come across. It’s clear she genuinely enjoys what she does. It’s refreshing to see someone who takes such pride in their work while making every interaction feel personal and sincere. 

Thanks for the great service.",5,2024,09,26
238,Fantastic hotel,My wife and I were gifted a 2 night break with dining experience. From arrival to departure we had a fantastic time. The hotel's location ensured a peaceful retreat.

238,Absolutely outstanding,"I stayed at Druids Glen for one night.  I was in the area to attend a wedding.  It was absolutely outstanding.  I received personalized and attentive care at check-in.  I was made to feel welcomed, and the staff member who checked me in was immensely helpful.  The room was magnificent.  It was large, clean, and well-decorated.  The air-conditioning worked beautifully.  The bathroom was perfect.  I really can't say enough.  I was really surprised, to be honest.  I didn't know what to expect.  I will return and make a point of using Druids Glen as a touring base.  ",5,2024,09,23
238,"Exceptional standard, we will be back!","Overall an incredibly relaxing midweek getaway experience!

We really enjoyed our stay. Thanks to all the hard working staff.",4,2024,09,22
238,World class service from Robbie,"Our golf trip and stay was made by the concierge Robbie. Truly some of the best service we’ve ever experienced. He looked after us brilliantly and to cap it off, he spent 15 minutes finding an umbrella for me for our drizzly round this morning. 

A credit to the hotel.",5,2024,09,22
238,Last Minute Overnight Stay,"My wife, our 8 month old baby and I decided to take a trip to Dublin zoo, and coming from the West of Ireland we decided last minute to book the Druids Glen. What a great decision that was. The hotel catered perfectly to us in every way. there is a family room with sterilisers, nappies, baby food etc on floor 2, our room was very spacious and had a crib setup and some lotions and shampoos for the baby. But what really made it for us was the staff, they were so good with our baby and were always checking in to see how our meals were and if we needed anything. You guys are doing a fanatic job and we look forward to coming back for a much longer stay in the future to see more of Druids and the beautiful County Wicklow in general.",5,2024,09,19

238,One night stay,"Fabulous from start to finish, would highly recommend. The food was delicious, the room was spacious and very comfortable and the staff went above and beyond.",5,2024,09,10
238,Wonderful stay especially for families,"We stayed in the hotel for one night and would have been delighted to stay longer had we the time.

We were travelling with our 2 year old and 7 month old and had a fantastic family room which was really big and fitted a travel cot and buggy/travel system with ease. The room was spotless with robes and slippers for all (too cute!). The bathroom was huge and very nicely decorated. The room was lovely and quiet and couldn’t hear anything outside in the corridors which was great!

The staff were fantastic and couldn’t do enough for us. 

There is a fabulous kids play room which our 2 year old loved with some old nostalgia which was nice for the grown ups too!

The outside playground is also great with all the usual stuff and a good way to pass some time! The pool was also a nice way to spend some time with floats etc provided, if required.

Staying on the kid centric side of things - but I think it is important - there is a baby pantry with a microwave and steralisers should you need them. It was also fully stocked with some baby porridge/ food items and nappies and wipes if anyone should ever find themselves stuck. Just brilliant!

We ate dinner in Hugo’s which was delicious. There were lots of families and lots of golfers. The hotel is a great option for all. Not just families but the child friendliness was a major plus point for us. 

Breakfast was one of the best buffets we have had across many hotel stays elsewhere. Really hot and loads of choice. Loved it!",5,2024,09,09

238,Druids Glen Stay,"The stay was absolutely fantastic here at Druids Glen. The moment we walked through the door, Ash provided great customer care to both of us and she was exceptional from minute one until the time we checked out. My partner and I both agree that she provided a very welcoming environment and made us feel right at home whilst being very informative, helpful and passionate about Druids Glen, she would be reason enough to go back alone! We couldn’t think highly of her! 
The food was absolutely incredible, especially in Hugo’s where we both had one of the nicest meals together! 
",5,2024,09,05
238,Exceptional in every aspect,"An exceptional hotel - my only gripe is we had to leave. Extremely clean and comfortable, food exceptional, service was perfect. All the staff went out of their way to assist and give us any information needed. We slept really well - the room was really quiet. Beautiful view. I cannot wait to return. ",5,2024,09,04
238,Few day away,"Hugo’s Restaurant service perfect ,but in my opinion Menu needs a bit more variety. Bar area staff efficient friendly & polite especially Matthew .",5,2024,08,31
238,Hmm good rooms but…..,Stayed here 2 nights with a view to spending one day in Dublin. Served its purpose really well for this purpose. Need a car to get to park and ride which works well. Noisy and chaotic during school holidays and weekends. Children running up and down corridors til 11pm. Horrendous noise. Pool far too busy and looked like a giant party. Swimhats why? Welcome was lacking in hospitality which has been lacking compared to other 5 star properties in Ireland. No luggage collection and long queue at reception. Food excellent in bar and efficient service. Chairs and tables feel like you’re sitting in  the cinema. Totally inadequate if you like sitting up. Breakfast adequate. Cafeteria service is not sufficient. Staff missing key points -serving spoons etc. No local produce. Missing polished service. Won’t return.,4,2024,08,28
238,Family Getaway,"Location- good base for exploring Wicklow. 
Food - Terrible quality in the garden room. Breakfast ;very average.
Staff were attentive and friendly.
Pool was good - long wait to access during busy periods. The plunge pool, sauna and steam room was lovely.
Guestroom - Dusty and shower was dirty. 
Check-in and check out was seamless. Good facilities for kids; kids club, playroom, walking trail and small playground.

Large family rooms, with lovey touches... dressing gowns for the kids, sink in the bathroom at childrens height so they can access it themselves, chocolates on the pillows at night.
There always seemed to be plenty of staff and the service in the restaurant was excellent. Reception staff very friendly and helpful too.
Loads to do and see in the area. Beyond the trees in Avondale was a big hit this time as well as Powerscourt and the dart from Greystones to Bray.
Looking forward to coming back again next Summer.",5,2024,08,21

A wonderful place to recharge your batteries.",5,2024,08,19
238,Awful Hotel,I was woken at 5 with loud banging. The gym was above our room. The curtain pole was broken so light flooded in and the curtains were torn. I got no sleep. Got up at 6 and went to reception. They  came to the room and heard it. I never got a proper explanation. I couldn't get a table in the bar even though I was told when we arrived that if I went down at 7 they would get me seated. Ended up spending 150 to eat outside on the decking. Awful stay and they still charged me 135 for the pleasure of no sleep 50 % off. ,1,2024,08,18
238,"Good for families, particularly older children","Large rooms, lovely grounds for walking, driving range was great, pool was very nice. Playroom, playground and fairy trail needs updating foe younger children. Waiting staff and housekeeping staff were very friendly .Breakfast was delicious and replenished late into the mmorning.

238,5 Stars Doesn't Do Druids Glen Justice,"Stayed here for one night for my partner's birthday and we were blown away.

Firstly, upon check-in we were thrilled to discover that we had received a complimentary upgrade to an Executive Suite, which was a lovely and hugely appreciated gesture. 

The room itself was massive and had more than you could ever possibly need for a month's stay, never mind one night! Separate living area, large and extremely comfortable bed, fridge, bath and shower, his and hers sinks, robes and slippers, two TV's both with satellite TV including Sky Sports, and plenty more.

The suite was located on the same floor as the Health Club which was very convenient as we had planned to enjoy a couple of hours there after checking-in. The sauna, steam room, plunge pool and swimming pool were all perfect. Very clean, plenty of room, and a fresh water dispenser was available too.

We had dinner in Hugo's Restaurant as part of our package and couldn't rate it highly enough. My partner is gluten free, and often hotel restaurants aren't up-to-speed when it comes to gluten free options, but that certainly wasn't the case here. Most of the starters and mains could be adapted to gluten free variations and there are a couple of dessert options too. I had the squid ink risotto with blue cheese croquettes for starters followed by duck for the main course. My partner had the duck for starter and chicken supreme for the main course, whilst we both had the chocolate praline for dessert. Every bite of the 6 dishes was perfect and to top it all off, at the end of the meal a Happy Birthday plate with a specially made gluten free dessert was brought out for my partner, which was completely unexpected and a fantastic surprise. Unfortunately I didn't catch the young Restaurant Manager's name (working the night of Saturday 3rd August), but would like to give him a special mention as he was superbly knowledgeable with regards to the gluten free aspect and very attentive throughout the sitting.

We had a few drinks in the bar after dinner which was a great atmosphere due to the live music offering and something that competing properties don't offer.

Breakfast the next morning was also superb. It's buffet style (with tea/coffee and toast brought to the table) but in this instance that's a positive rather than a negative. There's a mountain of beautifully cooked sausages, pudding, eggs (scrambled and fried), baby potatoes, plus pastries, smoked salmon, meats, cheeses, cereals etc on offer. Again the gluten free offering was brilliant, with a freshly cooked full Irish gluten free breakfast brought to the table for my partner, as well as a selection of gluten free scones, muffins and pastries available.

Overall, we couldn't rate our stay highly enough and a 5 star review doesn't do it justice. The property is without doubt a 5 star in terms of style, facilities and service, whilst at the same time managing to avoid the stuffiness that some of its competitors in the 5 star range suffer from, which in my view lends itself to a more relaxed feel and appeals to a wider clientele. Offerings such as the live music in the bar area are hugely welcome in this regard, as well as how openly family friendly the property is.

Thank you for a wonderful stay and for making my partner's birthday treat a very special one. We are already planning our next trip and will be back as soon as possible, but for longer than one night this time.",5,2024,08,07
238,Disappointed overall,"Just back from a One night stay with my husband and 6 year old son. When we arrived at 4.30pm to check in we were informed that our room wasn’t ready. That wasn't very convenient but we just went down to the pool while we waited. We rushed out of the pool to head up to the room to get ready for dinner, room was nice and clean however our shower was not working. This wasn’t what you would expect in a 5 star hotel, To be fair once we mentioned this to the receptionist , it was fixed by the time we came back after dinner. Dinner wasn’t fantastic, the chicken wings on the menu said spicy, they were more like bbq wings, the blue cheese resembled a garlic butter spread. The burger was just ok. My husband had the soup and the curry and he enjoyed his meal. Our waitress was lovely however she disappeared for about 20 minutes and we were left with empty glasses and a very inpatient 6 year old looking for a dessert.  Breakfast the next morning was nice, however, we were seated and when we came back to our table with our food another family had been given our table. We had to Approach the waitress for another table, Overall, we were disappointed after paying a large amount for a one night stay.",3,2024,08,05
238,Five Star’s From The Two Princes and One Princess.,"We where a family of two Adults with a 11 year old boy, a 10 year old boy and a 2 and half year old Girl, we stayed one night bed and breakfast, on arrival at check in Katie and Kevin where so nice , warm and friendly a lovely start to out stay, Joe the young man who helped us with our bags was only working there a week but know every thing and answered any questions we had, he is a credit to the hotel. We had inter connecting rooms which where both very specious with double and king size beds, the children loved that they had so much room to move around.  In the room there was two plates of cookies and two jugs of milk for the children which they really enjoyed, in their bath room there was all the little amenities called the little Prince , there where 3 small dressing gowns and three small pairs of slippers, the children just loved everything. Breakfast the next morning had a beautiful selection of hot and cold food and pancakes every thing was lovely service staff very friendly. We went to the swimming pool and also to the driving range, you go to  the golf shop to pay €5 for your token to get your basket of 100 balls over at the range and you get the golf sticks at reception.

238,Walkway not as expected,"Was very disappointed with their advertised walkway as we discovered the walkway also has cars using it and also at one stage we had to walk where golfballs were being hit by so for health and safety reasons had to turn around and finish the walk early , staff acted surprised when we advised them of this.",2,2024,08,05

238,Beautiful resort with all of the amenities!,"We thoroughly enjoyed our 3 night stay! All staff were very friendly and efficient and aimed to please. The room was in excellent condition, and we appreciated being restocked daily with fresh waters, coffee and shortbread biscuits, and evening chocolate squares. The toiletries were high-end. The gym, while fairly tight, had everything you needed for a great workout, and the spa facilities (sauna, steam room, hot tub, and plunge pool) were clean and thoroughly enjoyable! We got the bed & breakfast rate and enjoyed a delicious spread every morning!",5,2024,07,31

238,Druids Glen July 2024,Another wonderful stay in Druids Glen. Such a handy location but yet felt like a million miles away from any hustle and bustle. Beautiful room with a lovely family bathroom. The staff really make this hotel though from the housekeeping staff to Management. Particular shout out to the breakfast staff who went out of their way to be engaging (especially with children!) not to mention the quality and selection of breakfast. Outstanding. Looking forward to returning.,5,2024,07,25
238,Beautiful Hotel fantastic staff,"We stayed for one night for our Anniversary it was fantastic, our room was beautiful with a fabulous view, the dinner and breakfast were both delicious. The staff were all so friendly and helpful all the  cleaners and gardeners all smil d and said hello, will definitely be back ",5,2024,07,24
238,Very good option for luxury near Dublin and close to the best spots in Wicklow,"Comfortable rooms, good facilities, warm and welcoming staff, good food and the location is perfect to be on Dublin’s doorstep but with the beautiful tranquility of Wicklow (the garden of Ireland)",5,2024,07,22
238,Can do better!,"Beautiful location but sadly this will be my last time visiting Druids Glen as it has lost its 5 star quality. Attention to detail has gone, not going to go into any more detail as loved this hotel and sadly all good things come to an end.",4,2024,07,20
238,A touch of class,"A lovely hotel, 5 stars location a way from the hussle bustle  but 5 min drive to nearest town, 4 of us stayed had a lovely spacious deluxe family room with everything in it,  nice little touches in room staff are just excellent they go above and beyond, this place has everything pool playground games room open till 9pm cosy warm hotel excellent service and five star treatment I would definitely go back to hotel it’s in a great location so close to Greystones, bray and other attractions for day trips golf course and a driving range, car park close to hotel with plenty of parking, pull up to the door and staff greet you with help for your luggage all staff are just amazing, I will definitely coming back and I’ve stayed in lot of hotels this is the best so far ",5,2024,07,19
238,Supposed to be a five star! Five star prices and a pity about the resort! We had a pitiful shower in the room. It neither had an,Five star prices yet it doesn't deliver that service. Lack of atmosphere and services. We complained about the shower and they didn't seem to be interested. Out of all the 5 star resorts we've been to this has to be the most disappointing. The food was  middling the atmosphere was poor the services were unacceptable. The staff were in general good but you wouldn't expect any less for the exorbitant price!,2,2024,07,19
238,Fab stay at Druids Glen,Beautiful Hotel. The staff were so helpful and friendly. The lady at reception upgraded us as it was our wedding anniversary and John in the Bar restaurant was brilliant.  The room was fab and the bed and pillows so comfy.  A really lovely relaxing stay and there was a lovely atsmophere in the Hotel.  The breki was excellent We will be back,5,2024,07,17
238,Thank you Amy.,"I would like to thank Amy who was our room attendant.
She was amazing!
Very kind and thoughtful and I understand has just started at Druids Glen.
What an asset to the hotel, she is a treasure.
Thanks Amy...you were wonderful.
I have left you some chocolate to say thank you for looking after us so well.
We really appreciated it.",5,2024,07,17
238,Family time,"We have been going to Druids Glen for a number of years now as a family. The children love coming back every year. There are lots to see and do. Staff are very helpful especially Ash at Reception, who took the time finding places where we hadn’t visited before and provided us with telephone numbers of the venues. We went to Greenan Maze and were not disappointed. The children’s menu was amazing and the only fault we had was the service was slow. Looking forward to our next adventure at Druids Glen",5,2024,07,17
238,"Beautiful hotel, great for Family & Golf.","Fabulous family friendly hotel. Staff in all areas of the hotel were so helpful & friendly.  Breakfast was amazing and had a great selection of Gluten Free options which was brilliant as there were 4 Coeliacs in our group. Pool is great but worth noting, has set times for children both in the morning & afternoon up till 6pm. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay.",5,2024,07,17
238,Simply not 5 Star.,Stayed here for two nights at the beginning of July as a couple with a young child. I would say hotel is clean and quite modern. I believe it is along way off a 5 star hotel though.  We had emailed and phoned ahead to request that we have a cot in our room for arrival and had also asked if the room had Sky Golf as the Scottish Open was on while we stayed. We were assured that they had the channel in every room and that the cot would be no issue. Arrived at hotel car park is quite a distance from hotel if you have many bags and when we arrived the hotel had no one available to help with out bags so this was quite a challenge to start the day. Checked in and arrived to room and no Cot had been provided rang reception at 3:30pm and was told sorry and they would get that up now. 4:30pm still no cot so rang again and was assured it was on the way. 6pm still nothing so we went for dinner on arriving to the restaurant we were told they were completely booked out and had no tables until 8pm which wasn’t suitable with a small child. After asking at reception about any where in the area that would be good for food a man in a suit told us he would find us a table in the restaurant. We were quickly seated and order taking promptly.  When food arrived it was very middle of the road and was simply not hot. I sent my chicken back to be heated up and when it returned although it was hot very hot the bottom had been burned black. Anyway we got over this and returned to the room to find cot had finally been delivered 4 hours later. Switch on TV to discover Sky has no sound on TV and when I rang reception about this they told me this is an ongoing problem and that I could watch in the bar again not suitable with a small child. Onto to Breakfast the next morning we again were quickly seated by waiter who asked us if we wanted tea/ coffee and toast. We requested tea and toast and made our way to buffet which has great options and all was very good. The only problem the tea and toast never arrived after 20 minutes and watching tables that came after ourselves getting their toast and tea I said it to a waiter and it took a further 10 minutes to arrive. By this stage we were past it. Day 2 the same thing happened again. Then 25 minutes later two waiters arrived to us with the same thing. No management or no organisation. Certainly not 5 star service. I will say although I didn’t play golf on this stay the course seems to be in 5 star shape it is a shame the service provided by the hotel itself is not.,2,2024,07,15
238,Wonderful Stay with Family,"We booked Druids Glen as a family of 9 - 7 adults & 2 children - to celebrate our mother's 70th birthday.  From start to finish the service was excellent - from Jane in Reservations for all our help with making our reservations, to the lovely ladies on Reception checking in and all of the staff throughout the hotel.  The hotel itself is large & well appointed with lots of comfortable couches in the large lobby - ideal for relaxing after dinner in Hugos (which was delicious by the way - great food & great service) - with the whole family.  It was very busy all around the hotel and lots of families staying, similar to ourselves.   While I did not use the Health Club myself, other members of the family did and the kids in particular loved the pool - which was big - and also the playroom just down from the lobby.   There is a nice little walkiing trail running parallel to part of the golf course and a nice terrace area outside the Garden Bar, which was lovely to sit out on as the weather was lovely, which was a bonus!   The rooms were lovely and spacious and clean and the beds were very comfortable.  A lovely hotel in a lovely location, not too far from Dublin and we had a lovely time there celebrating a special birthday.  Thank you Druids Glen for helping us mark our Mum's birthday, we all really enjoyed it.",5,2024,07,15
238,A long overdue catch up with family,"Just completed a 3 night stay here as a means of catching up with an Uncle i hadnt seen since before covid and as it turns out my last stay at Druids Glen.

Firstly the little differences from both stays the little touches like a warm cloth and cold drink at check in are no longer there. In sayinv that the check in experience was very warm and welcoming, a room was even ready early which was great given we had afternoon tea booked so could take time to refresh and change.

The stay itself was really enjoyable. The twin room was large and airy. Beds were very comfortable. Housekeeping kept rooms clean daily. One quibble the air con wouldnt work so thankfully unlike alot of hotels today the windows opened which helped. There was a mini fridge which keot the water provided cold again very useful.

Breakfast was included in the package and again very enjoyable, plenty of options all of which very nice. Smoothie was way to sweet for my pallate though again a minor quibble. It can get quite busy though so depending on time be prepated to wait.

Checking out plesant the missing touch of water on check in returned on check out very welcome as it was a warm day making journey back to dublin on dart interesting so water welcome.

Overall a really nice stay and look forward to visiting again soon.",5,2024,07,14
238,Family Time 🌟,Excellent stay at Druids Glenn... Family friendly environment with lots to do at and around the hotel! All staff extremely child friendly and took time to sincerely interact with our 2 little girls. The only suggestion I would have would be to have a menu in one area that had plainer options more of pub grub vibe as i think this would appeal more to young families. I think this is needed as burgers seemed to pass us allot (and it was what we ordered as plainest ootion available). The hotel has already kindly lodged my suggestion hopefully something their team can consider. Apart from that excellent stay in a beautiful part of Ireland and we hope to call again. 😊,5,2024,07,14
238,Excellent hotel south of Dublin instead of staying in the centre of Dublin,"This is the first time we have been south of Dublin and very happy with the hotel and spar.  We found everything about this hotel top-quality, very comfortable, very good food and excellent service from all the staff that looked after us. Especially the resturant and the reception. We wished could have stayed here longer.",5,2024,07,13
238,Amazing stay,"We went here for our 6th year anniversary and had a great stay , staff were all great, when we arrived we were checked in early and as we were having a SPA treatment our room was beside the SPA ,we had lunch and dinner both lovely and breakfast was fab !",5,2024,07,11
238,Excellent stay,Just back from a wonderful family break in Druids Glen. We went as a family of 4. The kids loved the pool and play room. The food & service were exceptional. The room was spacious & comfortable. It rained most of our stay so we didn't get to see the nice gardens. There was a soft play centre a 10 minute drive away that the kids enjoyed. My husband and I both got treatments in the spa which were so lovey & relaxing. The food was without doubt the best food we've had in a hotel. We especially loved Hugo's restaurant. Would highly recommend.,5,2024,07,11
238,Family wedding,Just back from a fabulous stay.   We enjoyed it so much we decided to stay an extra night.  The staff were so welcoming.  The facilities/food was excellent.  The general atmosphere was so relaxing I can't wait to go back. ,5,2024,07,09
238,Weekend stay,"Stayed for one night with dinner in Hugo’s restaurant, which was delicious Lovely hotel. Great staff . ",5,2024,07,08
238,June/July 2024 - 2 nights - Superior Room,"As a 5-star hotel, my hopes were high with Druids Glen. There were some good points - the pool, breakfast, cleanliness, location....but our experience of the Hugo's dining was not great in terms of the main meal and service, and my wife and I found our 50min spa treatments to be well below par and very disappointing.",3,2024,07,08
238,"Several stays, never disappointed.","Best hotel ever! It was Spotless clean with a wonderful staff team, particularly Katie, Ava, Reece, Thomas, Myron and Ash. They were all most helpful and polite. Outstanding breakfast. Lovely surroundings. Good value for money. I would recommend to all families.",5,2024,07,07
238,Family vacation,"Druids Glen is a nice place but it’s very hard to justify a 5-star rating for the property. It is very much run as a hotel for families with very young kids (a bit like Kelly’s in Wexford if anyone is familiar with that hotel). Staff are friendly and breakfast is fine. The food in the garden room and bar is average. I had a chicken dish that was very poor in quality. We didn’t eat in the main restaurant during our stay. I unfortunately didn’t get to play golf during our stay but Druids Glen in particular looked in great condition. V expensive green fee though. Overall, it is a nice place but it’s a one and done for our family. ",3,2024,07,06
238,Excellent,"The staff were excellent. Was attendeding a wedding, food was amazing and service great too. The bedrooms were very clean and big. I would love to go back and avail of their spa and other facilities.

238,Family stay,"Absolutely beautiful hotel, was just exceptional from the minute we arrived. Will definitely be back to stay with the family",5,2024,07,02
238,Disappointed based on our previous stays at Druids Glen.,"Have stayed in Druids Glen several times over the years and have recommended it to many people.  However, this is our first time back in a few years.  I feel it has lost a few touches which made it stand out as a 5-star hotel.  On our previous stays, we were greeted with hot hand towels and an infused water drink on arrival.  When we previously checked out we were given water and little goodie bags for our kids.  These touches have now disappeared.  Also, there was no turndown service in the evening or chocolates in the room this time either.   A young man did come to our room shortly after check-in and asked if we had received a card and chocolates, I said we didn't, he made a mark on a piece of paper but that was it.  These things don't ruin your break but they definitely make an impression if they are present.  Also, we asked for an email to be printed on arrival.  Was told it would be done and delivered to our room but we had to chase it up before check out.   The room was clean and well-equipped.  The food in the bar was lovely and quickly served.  Staff very attentive.  Breakfast was great but limited choice on the menu to order but couldn't fault the buffet or the staff again.  Playpark could do with a lick of paint. On a side note we make a point of staying in Inchydoney Hotel every year (an excellent 4 star,) they have all the touches that have disappeared from Druids Glen therefore based on our current stay I would place it above 5 star Druids Glen.",3,2024,07,02
238,Excellent stay,"Excellent stay at the Druids Glenn as always, great location, lovely staff, really relaxing, love the pool.",5,2024,07,02
238,A good hotel in Wicklow,Lots of families with very young children were staying at this hotel - more so than golfers.  There is a lovely walk around the hotel grounds and golf courses. Hotel staff are very friendly and do their best to give good customer service.,4,2024,07,01
238,Celebration Break,We had a lovely short break at this beautifully located resort.  The reception staff were very welcoming The bedroom was large and very comfortable. Food was excellent and staff very friendly and attentive. The pool and gym areas were very well maintained.,4,2024,06,29
238,Delightful Stay at Druids Glen,"Such a lovely hotel surrounded by beautiful countryside and two wonderful golf courses. Service was 5 star as were the rooms, the food and the service. ",5,2024,06,25
238,Fine.,"While our stay was very nice this hotel is far from a 5 star rating and on this level was disappointing. The building on arrival needs a refresh, the carpets through out need replacing and in places weee simply not clean. The room was fine, a bit worse for wear in places. The beds in our family room  were very comfortable. The bathroom was fine. 
Staff in the dining room were very helpful although a little disorganized on Sunday morning. They were quite young and doing their very best but lacked a bit of direction. There was a good choice for  breakfast but again nothing that would make it stand out or put it at the same standard as other 5 star rated hotels.  The  menu cards were grotty and need replacing. 
In short our stay was nice, everything was fine  but luxurious it was not. For the rating and the price I would have expected a lot more. I’m afraid I will not be returning whilst the building is in its current state. The rating sets an expectation it cannot meet.",3,2024,06,24
238,Extraordinary stay,"Our weekend was an absolute magical experience.  All department at the hotel are giving an amazing service, friendly welcome and go the extra mile. Thank you",5,2024,06,24
238,Wedding review,"Where do I start? We had our wedding in Druids Glen on the 31st of May 2024. I will never be able to thank Nessa and the team enough for everything they did! Nessa was an absolute dream to deal with from start to finish! She went above an beyond for us without even being asked! We were the first to use the new outdoor furniture and how lucky we were to have got married in the most beautiful set up! There is nothing she can't do!! Sabha ensured our meal and night ran smoothly keeping a close eye out for our guests with dietary requirements! Robbie was amazing! He looked after us so well all weekend! He gained a new friend in our 3 year old boy and us! We will forever be grateful that our dream day was in Druids Glen! All the staff that helped us now feel like friends our guests are still raving about the food, rooms and service and I think they always will! Love to Nessa, Sabha, Robbie and all the team The McEwan's - Tommy, Lynn and Mason",5,2024,06,20
238,Amazing staff !,"Family of two adults, one toddler and one baby stayed for two nights in June 2024. The best part was the staff! They were all extremely friendly, from reception to the restaurant to the household staff who would smile at us and talk to the kids on the corridor.
Great playground and toy room was a huge hit with the 2 year old.
Breakfast was fab, as were two dinners in the garden room.
Loved our stay.",5,2024,06,19
238,To attend a wedding,We stayed in hotel last weekend to attend a wedding. From start to finish everything went very well.,5,2024,06,18
238,Lovely mini family break.,"I booked a two night family stay with my 4 year old and 9 year old and we absolutely loved it. From the time we pulled up at the front door to the time we drove away, the staff were fantastic! So child friendly and genuine about it. The beds were amazing. The room was a great size and absolutely spotless. The food was delicious in the bar and restaurant. We especially loved the pool. The staff here were so lovely. It's a 5 star golf resort that caters to families but doesn't seem to be fake about it in any way. We'll definitely be back! ",5,2024,06,14
238,Weekend in Druids Glen,"From the minute we arrived until the minute we left we had a fabulous weekend. The room was spacious. The food was fabulous all weekend. All the staff were incredibly polite, helpful and worked really hard to make everyone feel welcome. ",5,2024,06,10
238,Great hotel with excellent facilities,I would highly recommend this hotel. Large swimming pool with spa. Lovely bar areas and the food is excellent. Druids Glen golf course is very expensive but we enjoyed Druids Heath. The staff are exceptionally friendly. An expensive hotel but worth the money for the great facilities and comfort of the hotel. I would definitely return.,5,2024,06,10
238,We were attending a wedding of Tommy and Lynn McEwen,Fabulous and the staff are so polite and very professional and friendly we had a great stay at Druids Glen Hotel ,5,2024,06,04

Love the new seating/setting in woodland for outdoor reception, Neasa n her team as with all hotel staff could not be more accommodating.",5,2024,06,03
238,Beautiful hotel - Dinner Disaster :-(,"Positives:
Lovely staff - very friendly 
Family rooms - clean and big
Leisure centre - friendly girl at reception. Clean pool area.

We had a fabulous afternoon tea for adults and kids.

HOWEVER - when it came to dinner - it was a disaster - our dinner was 1.5 hours waiting - absolutely not good enough - 
No one came over to us - the man who took our order just disappeared to a different area of the bar - we had to call someone to ask about our food 
- manager made the excuse they were busy but others around us had their food and left.

So disappointed as we would have given the hotel 10/10 before dinner -  we still had to pay for the food which we waited on and our order was wrong and items missing from our dishes but when your hungry you’ll eat. Manager took €6 kids wings off the bill ( these were meant to be an adult chicken wings by the way ) 
It’s such a pity - think it should have been handled better. 

Disappointed but I’d return but go into Greystones tor dinner the next time.",3,2024,06,03
238,Recent trip,Great location. Been many times before but didn’t think as good this time. Sat outside as beautiful day but windy. Didn’t feel very safe as two huge poles rattled and banged and felt like they could come down. They need removed or at very least new coverings put on them and usable. Very untidy looking the way they have been left as torn and unusable. ,3,2024,05,31
238,Golf stay,"Played at Druids Glenn, fantastic from start to finish. Course was fantastic, a tough test and new clubhouse area very nice.",4,2024,05,30
238,"I love the playground, play den and the swimming pool","The food was the best and the swimming pool was great to. great food. Lovely robes and slippers, even for children. Had lots of fun. Breakfast is amazing. We had dinner in the Garden room which was excellent and drinks on the outdoor balcony. The staff are very friendly and helpful.",5,2024,05,29
238,Anne Treacy,"A nice hotel, staff are fantastic. Hotel bedrooms need a little facelift. Food menu is nice, could do with a little more variety.",3,2024,05,28
238,A Short Break,"My wife and l stayed for a 2 night break in the Druids Glen Hotel.  It was enjoyable and lots of good things about the Hotel. It's in an excellent location and lovely countryside, perched between two Golf Courses. We found the break very expensive for the two nights, but this is undoubtedly based on the fact that it is rated as a 5* Hotel.  That is a rating l would dispute. 
Everything else was very good. The bed was really soft and the pillows were the softest feather pillows imaginable. We slept very poorly and on the second night we asked for firm pillows which were quickly suppled and they helped greatly.  Food was excellent in the Garden Bar and the Hotel Staff were excellent. They cannot be faulted. Most obliging, hats off to all the Staff. 
We enjoyed our little break but if l am being totally honest, this is in my opinion not a 5* Hotel. I would take 1 * away.  My honest opinion. ",4,2024,05,21
238,Lovely relaxing hotel,"We had a lovely 2 night stay for our daughter’s communion. The food is excellent and comfort of the hotel also. Very friendly staff , we will be back ",5,2024,05,21
238,Great staff and some interesting extras,"We originally booked two nights but had to change at last minute to one night, the lady explained their cancellation policy but my child had an opp ointment and she understood. Room Devine , the bar was so spacious. There is a mark up on steak everywhere these days and I’m not sure why- 40 euro for a 10 ounce - a little strange here. Anyway lovely food. Staff exceptional- high praise to the chef at breakfast who overheard me say “oh no there’s no beans”, and arrived out to me with some personally- this kind of thing separates average places to really well run establishments in my book- the small things. We’ll done all fabulous stay and hotel!! Will be back",5,2024,05,20
238,Family stay after Lap of the Gap Marathon,"Following the completion of the challenging Ireland Toughest Marathon Lap of the Gap, our team stayed at Druids Glen for a night, occupying 6 rooms. The hotel staff at Druids Glen were wonderfully accommodating, displaying a high level of professionalism and courtesy throughout our stay. The accommodations were top-notch, and the food at the Garden Rooms was exceptional. We are already making plans to participate in the marathon again next year and look forward to returning to Druids Glen for a two-night stay.",5,2024,05,20

238,Druids Glen Experience,"Enjoyed our 2 night stay in Druids Glen recently, lovely food, accommodation and all round great experience.  Played golf one of the days which was a challenging experience, alas in the rain!  Loved the interior of the hotel.  Definitely worth a visit.",5,2024,05,07
238,Poor 5 star ‘Motel’!,Desperate need of money & overhaul! Tired dull & unkept - need to revamp worn bedroom futniture & new bed blankets. Bathrooms old fashioned. Arrival to set down area huge disappointment :-not 5 star .. more ‘Motel’!… tired unkept dirty broken bins dirty entrance doors & in desperate need of paint! Playground not enticing & with dirty building behind ,3,2024,05,07
238,Will book again,"Perfect 5 star mini break to get us through a long weekend. My son is autistic and gets anxious when stuck at home (thanks to Pandemic) 
Druids Glen is friendly, helpful and very welcoming. Rooms are very comfortable with air con or fresh air and beds deeply luxurious. Breakfast is included and amazing and you can take it in your room with your own coffee machine, or get silver service with a view. Enjoyed the nature walk after checking out which extended our relaxing day. ",5,2024,05,06
238,Favourite hotel stay by far,"Such an amazing stay, make sure you book for 2 nights. The atmosphere is so relaxing and cosy. The spa was exceptional, im not very good at relaxing but you have no choice jere and the sauna/steam and plunge pool really made our stay. Food was 5* as well as the service. Will definitely be returning.",5,2024,05,05
238,A Rare Find,"Stayed for the first time at Druids Glen Hotel this week and really enjoyed the overall experience.  The surroundings and service are exactly what we wanted, discreet 5 star service.  I am looking forward to staying at Curracloe, another spectacular location.  Remy and his Team in the Garden Rooms are excellent.  A large group seated next to the Bar were very loud.  I asked for a quiet table to have Dinner and was accommodated.  My impression is that everybody involved in Druids Glen is making a concerted effort and it shows.",5,2024,05,04
238,Very disappointed stay,"Overall the hotel was nice and staff were very pleasant.
Despite booking the Garden Room for dinner and the hotel confirming our reservation, we were told you cannot actually book a table and just to sit anywhere, but there were no dinner tables available, only at the bar.  And 2 tables had 'reserved' signs on them so a strange set up. Pool is closed off to children, even older children between 11am to 2pm and the driving range was closed so there wasn't much for the kids to do. Room is very dated and not enough room for a family of four.  Would not stay again.",2,2024,05,03
238,Couples short break,Beautiful hotel with very friendly staff who made us welcome at all times.  We had an excellent time with excellent food in both Hugo’s and the lounge bar.  The Spa was very clean & well organised. ,5,2024,04,30
238,Almost perfect but regret visiting the spa,"Booked this as a weekend with some friends. Staff at check in were lovely. Room wasn’t ready on arrival but staff were very accommodating and facilitated an earlier check in when it was available. All hotel and restaurant staff were accommodating and helpful for the duration of our stay. 

One thing I would point out which was disheartening during our stay (and impact our recommendations in future) was the poor experience in the spa. Although treatment was very enjoyable, the spa manager was very condescending towards my friends in the party who were waiting for me during my treatment outside of the spa. She was extremely rude on several occasions and made them feel very uncomfortable. When this was flagged by our party at reception, the spa manager acted like she knew nothing of the incident. A very disappointing experience which will certainly impact our desire to stay in future. 

With this, the health club staff and remainder of hotel staff were more than accommodating and friendly. Unfortunately one person has spoiled our experience.",3,2024,04,30
238,"An enjoyable, relaxing stay at a first class hotel","Our room was spacious, clean and comfortable and apart from the dodgy TV reception everything worked well.
The food was good with plenty of choice and the restaurant / bar staff were all friendly, efficient and helpful.
Finally, the location is superb (even for non golfers)",5,2024,04,30
238,Outstanding,"We had a fabulous one night stay in Druid's Glen. The hotel is very clean and the staff are friendly and helpful. Emiliano, in particular, ensured that we had a memorable stay.

We had lunch in the Garden Rooms and dinner in Hugo's. The food and service were excellent in both. Breakfast the following morning was great with plenty of selection. 

Our room was spacious, and the bed was comfortable. The bathroom had a walk-in shower and a bath. 

I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2024,04,30

238,5 Star Review,"As always Druids delivers 5 Star Service! I can't fault anything during our stay, staff super friendly without being under your feet, Food amazing, Beds super comfy and there is something about this hotel that makes you relax when you walk through those front doors!! We will be back again and again!!",5,2024,04,22
238,Dissapointing experience,"I came with high hopes having been here a few years previously. I wasn’t looking for issues, they just hit me in the face. On arrival we parked and found broken glass in the parking lot just beside our front tire,(a near miss). On checking into our room I found a broken handle on the latch to the balcony, a sink that only drained slowly,  a broken seal on the shower door, water leaking from the shower head when turned on and the shower mixer valve handle was loose. Clearly maintenance is slipping for some reason. 
Breakfast on day one was an altogether different issue with 80% of the tables been occupied by parents with young families. It was like eating breakfast in a crèche, horrendous cacophony of children being children. It was impossible to read the newspaper.

The grounds are lovely and peaceful and the public areas are nice but on balance It wasn’t enough to make up for the other experiences.",3,2024,04,14
238,lovely Golf Hotel lunch,"Beautifully presented hotel in a stunning area. Lunch in the Garden Room was very nice, friendly waiting staff and reasonably priced. 
The ambience of the hotel is lovely, cosy seating areas with fireplaces to relax. The hotel has a spa, gym, pool and golf course. 
We received a warm welcome by the very attentive concierges Sean and Ryan / Wicklow.",5,2024,04,07

238,Best family friendly hotel I have had the pleasure of staying in!,"I cannot recommend this hotel enough. It is simply the Best family friendly hotel I have ever stayed in. The hotel offer a kids game room, the pool,  the loveliest walk & a park all on site. We had dinner in the restaurant and the food was amazing! The pints and cocktails were a big hit too! The staff were attentive and the rooms were clean. There is even a stocked baby room with a microwave, kettle and baby porridge all available. The attention to detail is just 👌",5,2024,04,01
238,Amazing Easter weekend!,"Amazing food, staff and stay. Wonderful weekend activities for children for Easter. No ask is too much for the staff and they always have an extra smile for a child. Fantastic hotel. I would highly recommend! ",5,2024,04,01
238,Family stay during Easter break,"Really enjoyed our family Easter break at Druid’s Glen. Onsite dining options were very good. Staff was extremely friendly and helpful throughout our stay. Location is perfect with lots to do on the property, plenty of nearby family entertainment and a short drive to shopping in Dublin area. We will definitely return. ",5,2024,03,31
238,Fabulous Experience,"Such a wonderful experience from the moment we checked in to the moment we left. The staff are some of the friendliest and most helpful that I’ve come across in a long time. Genuine warmth and hospitality. The health club manager, concierge and reception in particular were all fantastic. The family facilities were fantastic for the Easter break with a whole schedule of events to choose from, kids were well catered for. We were very lucky to also have received an upgrade and found ourselves in the most magnificent suite which we were super grateful for and really enjoyed. If you’re on the fence about upgrading, do it! We had an abundance of space for ourselves and our little one. I am already looking forward to our return!",5,2024,03,30
238,The smallest things matter…especially when done by the young guns.,"I’m not so good with words or emotions (never mind writing a review)…but just wanted to give a big shout to the “young guns” at Druids Glen Hotel. Especially, the young woman who gave me some quiet space in a closed part of the hotel for me to do some work emails. Even more impressive she didn’t consult her manger…just made a call. That’s impressive. It wasn’t the only magical moment during our two night stay…every single one of which was done by these “young guns”…and led me to the conclusion…you know what - “the worlds going to be ok” - thank you for giving back my belief.",5,2024,03,30
238,Mini break,"We were a group of friends on a mini break we felt so welcome from the time we arrived. Especially want to mention Robbie, Irena and Olly they couldn’t have done more for us . The rooms are very comfortable and luxurious we had everything we needed. This was our first time here and we would recommend it . Definitely a hidden gem in a beautiful setting. We will be back.",5,2024,03,30
238,Excellent stay with great service,"As always we had a great time in Druids. From start to finish it was perfection. Robbie always goes out of his way to look after us and goes above and beyond, and his extra effort can be seen with other customers in the dining areas. Love Druids Glen. Looking forward to our next stay",5,2024,03,29
238,Fabulous Get Away,"Just returned from a fabulous overnight stay in Druids Glen.  Rooms are so comfortable.  Had a lovely meal in Hugo's where the staff could'nt have been more helpful.
We will definitely be back to this amazing venue.",5,2024,03,29
238,Golf Day Out,"We went for a round of golf and it was a perfectly kept course. Really lovely place to be.

The staff were amazing, Michael and his staff looked after us very well. The pints of guinness were beautiful and the burger was top! I would definitely recommend!",5,2024,03,26
238,Beautiful hotel in Beautiful surroundings,"Just had beautiful 1 night break in Druids Glen last Thursday & Friday, the hotel is really beautiful and probably the nicest hotel foyer that i have ever seen,  we had a tasty dinner in the Garden Restaurant and desserts were yummy, our bedroom was large with very comfy beds and pillows, breakfast was amazing with a huge choice including pancakes, after breakfast we did the 4km walking trail with some stunning views of the DG golf course. 

The staff are very friendly and helpful and we are definately coming back in May to do it all again as we just love DG hotel

Thank you to Druids Glen and all the staff for making our 1 nite break so enjoyable and memorable",5,2024,03,24
238,"Golf, Guinness and a burger 👌","Played golf with a friend here over the weekend and I have to say its one of the nicest tracks I've ever played, they've definitely done some good work out there in the course. The food in we had in the clubhouse after was almost as good as the golf! 

Top day out and well looked after by Michael and his staff. Can't wait to come back sometime in the future. ",5,2024,03,24
238,Three day visit,"Very welcoming staff and very welcoming atmosphere,  Particularly enjoyed the real-flame fires in the lobby.  Reception staff were polite, knowledgeable and efficient.  Staff in the Garden Rooms were very attentive and food was of a high standard.  Hugo's Restaurant had a very relaxing atmosphere and guests were treated in a very professional way by well trained staff.  
Much of our stay was spent outdoors and away from the hotel, sightseeing in the surrounding area so I will not comment in detail on other services in the hotel.",5,2024,03,23
238,A memorable stay,"From the moment we checked into Druids Glen we were amazed from the scenery and standard of service. Adrienne at reception was  so welcoming. Roman at the Garden Rooms was our waited and was so friendly and attentive, he even gave me a congratulations plate to help celebrate submitting my dissertation. 
The concierge was also so helpful, nice to see a member if Le Clefs in Ireland!!",5,2024,03,23
238,Fabulous stay,"This hotel is stunning, great cosy atmosphere and luxury feeling at the same time. The staff were exceptional and really make you feel like you matter! They went above and beyond to make sure we enjoyed our stay. We can’t wait to return, felt thoroughly relaxed and recharged after a nights stay. We used the baby pantry room which has bottle warmers, sterilisers etc so it’s very baby friendly. ",5,2024,03,23
238,Great relaxing couple of days,"Just back from a two day break at druids Glen with the family..Great break..food was excellent and the staff were very friendly & helpful.the pool was great and lots of room with the extra of sauna,steam and plunge pool..great kids activityroom also...we will be back again..",5,2024,03,22
238,A wonderful mini break,"A short break away which we thoroughly enjoyed. Everything was so professional while still being so personal and friendly. Food, service, room and pool area excellent. The fact that our room was only a couple of doors away from the leisure centre was fantastic.",5,2024,03,21
238,Our 3rd Stay - Another Wonderful & Relaxing Few Days,"We thoroughly enjoyed our recent two night stay. From check in to check out, everything was great. Special thanks to Irena at reception for the extremely generous upgrade to a suite. It was so appreciated. Such a lovely lady, and she always had a smile and chat for everyone. We had a lovely relaxing time. The room was fantastic (huge) and the service throughout was exceptional. We ate at the Garden Room/Bar on two occasions and at Hugos on one night. Both very different, both lovely. The staff overall at Druids are all just wonderful...so professional, friendly and helpful. We look forward to our 4th visit.",5,2024,03,21
238,The kindest staff and stunning setting,"Just back from a trip with my two children. Every member of staff was warm and welcoming. The pace of service for food/amenities and check in was spot on. The staff were attentive and efficient without ever making you feel rushed. 
My children loved the relaxed environment, especially the lovely play room and pool. 
Rooms were very nice and well kitted out, including little dressing robes and slippers for the kids. 
The food was lovely from start to finish. We ate in the bar both nights and were so happy with the food and the relaxed setting. 
I would highly recommend this hotel for a relaxing family break.",5,2024,03,18
238,Gorgeous experience!,"We had a fabulous night away in Druid’s Glen! Beautiful hotel, friendly staff, great food! We loved it all from start to finish. Room was cosy and comfortable and we had such a relaxing time! It wasn’t our first time and it won’t be our last.  Although the hotel was probably pretty full, it certainly didn’t feel that way as it’s so spacious and there are lots of areas to sit, unwind and watch the world go by. Bar food was delicious and the breakfast was perfect. Can’t wait to return!",5,2024,03,16
238,Two night stay,"Two night stay for my parents, they loved it, food excellent, staff excellent, room comfy, warm & with a lovely view. Loved it all. Thank you for their complimentary upgrade & birthday card/chocolates left in room, and a birthday wish from the staff. Thank you",5,2024,03,16
238,Fab 👌 👏,"What a gorgeous hotel, from the beautiful food to the most friendly staff members, they really do go the extra to make your stay that bit nicer. Remy the waiter made our dinner experience 🫶🏽Recommend the pork bao buns and my husband said the Chicken Supreme was excellent (only downfall was the chicken wings not very crispy). The breakfast is also top notch. Thank you Druids Glen ❤️",5,2024,03,15
238,"Poor afternoon tea, don't bother if you're vegetarian.","Partner booked afternoon tea as a special birthday treat for me. In his booking he mentioned my birthday and the fact that I am a vegetarian. Although acknowledged by reply email from the hotel, it seems that neither point of information was passed any further. 
The tea, the view, and the service were perfectly lovely. 
The food was the most disappointing I've had. My savoury plate consisted of sauce sandwiches - 2 baps filled with guacamole, a finger sandwich of tomato relish, and a focaccia with far too chunky cucumber and tomato. Not an egg or a piece of cheese to be seen. These are not sandwich ingredients, they are a disrespectful and lazy answer to vegetarian food. My partner enjoyed his savouries.
Scones were nice, but the dessert I was given to replace the gelatine filled chocolate mousse was revolting - a rock hard pastry shell, filled with something liquid, and topped with some kind of crumb. When I tried to break into it with my fork, it smashed and went all over me, the table, and the other food.
I have often been taken for afternoon tea as a birthday treat, or taken a friend, and every other establishment I've been to has made some little flourish to mark the occasion. Druids Glen couldn't be bothered. Our server, Roy was a pleasure to deal with, and is not responsible for what cones out of the kitchen. However while Roy was on his break, we were ignored by the other staff. 
An all round extremely disappointing experience, and on the higher end of the price scale to boot. 
I'm tired of being treated as second class because I don't eat animals. This is 2024.",2,2024,03,15
238,Return visit and still deserving of its 5 stars. ,"We had been to the hotel 10 years ago, so it was time to revisit. On checking in, Kevin on desk was excellent in upgrading our room and later during the stay he arranged a wee gift for my wife which was much appreciated. 
The foyer is lovely and seating plentiful. Our room was actually a family room with a king and double bed, but with the superior room items such as l'Occtane gels etc and coffee machine. 
The room decor had changed, however the orange coloured marble bathrooms could do with perhaps a modernization. 
Bed comfy, plenty of comp water, proper decent pen, bathrobes, even little ones if you had kids with you. 
The room and general hotel temperature was nice.
Breakfast buffet was good. Not as vast an array of breads etc, or the omelete making show chef as our previous visit. However it was very tasty with really good quality bacon and meats. My wife reckons the pots of G, gormet jam is the best she has tasted. 
Pool was nice and warm, and big enough to enjoy a proper swim. 
Staff were all very pleasant and we really did enjoy our stay. 
The Greystones area is only a few miles away and worth visiting. It has train link direct to Dublin city centre.
 Dundrum shopping centre only 25
 min drive from hotel. 
I have played golf here before a number of times and the Glen course is amazing. Heath is nice as well. 
Recommend. 
",5,2024,03,14
238,Food not even 3 star,"The hotel itself is lovely, rooms clean and staff very friendly. The only problem I had was the food. If this was just based on the restaurant I’d have given it one star. The issues started in the bar where we ordered chips. They unfortunately tasted of fish meaning either they fry it in the same oil as the fish or the oil used is very old. Then that evening in the restaurant we ordered as a starter scallops (the most expensive starter) and we received a plate of half a scallop and two prawns. They could not explain and we left it at that. My daughter ordered a pizza from the kids menu and out came a dry frozen pizza. If I were at a 2 star hotel I wouldn’t have minded but it was a 5 star hotel and that frozen pizza cost €11! They brought out some fish goujons for her instead but it had unfortunately been fried in that horrible oil and so she was turned off. My son’s burger was no better and it was quite annoying that when we made a complaint the next day to not make a scene or have them think we wanted a free dinner, the manager just hoped we’d have a better experience next time we visited them. Shocking",2,2024,03,13
238,AMAZINGGGG,"Amazing stay highly recommend , A staff member Jo works here she is one of the best staff here deserves all the credit she gets and the services is amazing the rooms are very big and food is great  …..",5,2024,03,12
238,A wonderful Birthday Celebration in a fantastic  5 star hotel,"Its a few years since i have stayed in Druids Glen and it had been one of my favorite Hotels in Ireland pre covid, i was a little concerned having read some negative comments but OMG , nothing has changed which is good news, the hotel is as stunning as ever service m staff are wonderful.  Arrived Saturday around 5pm and greeted by the smelliest 2 young concierges and so helpful with luggage and car parking! Reception staff were professional and efficient. We ate in the bar as the rugby match was on and great atmosphere with a good choice of wines and food to choose from. Lovely fires in the hotel lobby made it the perfect setting for our last drink of the night after the entertainment in the bar. Plenty of staff and also so helpful, thank you to the waiter who served us all night. 9 sorry we cant remember the name) 

Our bedroom was spotless and the beds are so comfortable! I am always nervous of breakfast as I think its so important and it didn't let us down! it was delicious! The breakfast host was amazing, he doesn't miss a trick! very attentive and I like my tea strong, he added a tea bag, I like views , he patiently let  me move around until I found the perfect spot. We went for a nice walk after breakfast and the views are just stunning. Didn't want to leave and I unfortunately did not get to have a spa treatment or enjoy a swim on this occasion but i will back for the next occasion for certain. thanks to all and thank you to Andrew Ryan for leaving me a lovely Birthday message  and a warm welcome.",5,2024,03,12
238,Return Visit Excellent As Usual,"Choice and Quality of food excellent. Staff attentive, friendly, well trained hence their professional work ethic. We were very pleasantly surprised and appreciative to have a room upgrade. It was our 2nd visit to hotel this time for my husbands 70th birthday. Lovely comfortable accommodation.",5,2024,03,11
238,Top notch hotel,"Stayed here for one night and will definitely be back, absolutely top hotel. Staff where so helpful and went over and above. Rooms so beautifully furnished and spacious, beds so comfortable. Facilities for young children and babies amazing. Honestly can not fault this hotel. The grounds were also beautiful, can't wait to go back.",5,2024,03,11
238,Excellent hotel,"Excellent place, merits it’s 5 stars! Rooms large and well equipped. Very helpful staff. Little extras included. Very highly recommended. Pool used for swimming lessons… and makes it very busy in afternoons. Only downside we noticed! Food excellent",5,2024,03,09
238,"Excellent staff, beautiful hotel","I booked a last minute get away for myself and my 3 year old after reading the reviews that it was very child friendly.  Have to start by saying the staff go above and beyond and are extremely excellent at their jobs.  They made me and my daughter feel so welcome and would constantly engage with my child at every chance.  I only ate in the bar and had breakfast in the restaurant.  I have to say I was very impressed with the food and how tasty it was.  A few little niggles however.  I was disappointed there was no childrens pool just the adults one but we still made the most of it.  When I was in the room with my child who feel asleep at 6pm I had a member of staff who entered and as I got to the door he asked if I wanted a complementary clean.  I got a bit of a fright as I’ve never had someone enter my room at this time in the evening but he was so nice about it I just shrugged it off.  The next morning another member of staff asked if I wanted my room cleaned which I did as my little girl had spilled her juice on the cover.  I was surprised to come back to the same stained cover and just the bed made.  Again, just little niggles that wouldn’t put me off.  I’m going to return in May with just my husband as the grounds and the hotel itself are beautiful and I really want to get to enjoy the bar and spa this time :)",4,2024,03,08
238,Excellent staff let down by poor systems.,"There is no doubt that Druid's Glen is a lovely place in an almost idyllic setting- and here is where the ""but"" comes! We have stayed here before and had a superb experience so we booked for our 53rd Wedding anniversary expecting the same high standard as before. Wrong. When we went to the room we quickly realised that there was no cold water. contacted reception and maintenance arrived whilst we went down for coffee. Reception informed us that the problem couldn't immediately be resolved and we were being upgraded to another room. Later we found out that the original room had the same issue that morning and obviously hadn't been rectified. Housekeeping check? Later we booked dinner but when we arrived there were no tables available so had to sit for a while. In fairness the waiter kept us informed but was the restaurant overbooked so why bother booking? Breakfast excellent but very few staff at start although more came on board after a while. Checking out was again an issue as they had charged us for the upgrade in the room! Said that we had asked for it! Sorted out by reception staff. Should point out that throughout our stay the staff were excellent, efficient and courteous- let down by system. 
I am aware that hotels can be busy places but I was not aware of any members of management ""walking the walk"". In many hotels that we have stayed there has been an obvious management presence- maybe they were busy?",4,2024,03,01
238,Leaves a lot to be desired,"A hotel of contrasts for a 4 star experience at best. 
- Great breakfast, disappointing dinner. We had dinner in the bar, because the restaurant, almost empty for both nights we were there, was 'fully booked'. I would have appreciated a bit more honesty. If patrons need to book a place in the restaurant a few days ahead due to understaffing or for whatever reason, or else not get a spot, it would be better to specify that in my opinion. 
- Long waiting time for food. Waited for an hour for some glorified and overpriced pub grub, and had to ask for a update from the waiter after 50 minutes. With a hungry toddler in tow. 1h and 10 minutes is too long to wait for burger and chips. 
- Nice room, but poor service: no room service despite the sign in the door. 
- Had to chase reception for the cot we requested in advance and a change of towels. 
- Playroom overall good but no batteries for the babies and toddler toys. 
- I was really excited before going, but we won't return and we don't recommend.",2,2024,02,28
238,Fab birthday night away!,"We had a wonderful stay. Jo at reception was so warm & friendly. Thomas at breakfast was so kind & made sure we had everything we could need.
Gorgeous addition of a happy birthday card for my partner made all the difference. We would absolutely be back in a heartbeat & can strongly recommend to anyone.",4,2024,02,26
238,"Great Spa, Food & Drinks, Beautiful Grounds",We had a birthday weekend for my sister-in-law including spa treatments and fabulous cocktails and foods. The live entertainment was wonderful. The spa!!! The massage and facial were wonderful! Especially the warm coconut oil that was used for the massage! The beds were extremely comfortable with plenty of fluffy pillows.,5,2024,02,26
238,Overnight,"
Excellent service from check in to check out. Beautiful hotel in a woodland setting. Bedrooms & bathrooms were spotless & so comfortable. Food was excellent & beautifully served with courtesy. All staff were so polite. ",5,2024,02,23
238,So disappointed - avoid if you aren’t a family,"This was not what we expected at all. Completely overrun with families and children. Marketed as a luxury hotel but I have been in nicer 3* hotels. Children running up and down corridors at 7.30am. Overall the room was nice, big spacious bedroom but average bathroom. Small square shower with dirty grout and sealant. I would definitely consider other hotels in the area. Breakfast average, again nothing special and didn’t seem like staff were coping with the number of people. ",2,2024,02,20
238,Beautiful hotel - food could do with improvement,"We had afternoon at the hotel, would not recommend. The sandwiches in particular weren’t great. 
We also ate at the Garden rooms and bar for dinner. Very limited menu on our package which could be improved. 
Hotel itself is very nice and clean. Service is good. ",4,2024,02,20
238,Great hotel & staff,Druids Glen Hotel was absolutely amazing. Adrienne at the front desk is a credit to the hotel. 10/10 experience. We felt so welcome and taken care of. Every member of staff greeted us and couldn't be more helpful.  ,5,2024,02,19
238,This is not a 5*hotel.,"Totally ripped off thinking I was going to a luxury 5*hotel. I would rate it 3* . Total waste of money. Went to powerscourt hotel for lunch and Druids Glen has no compassion to it. Proper 5* 

Not for couples

",3,2024,02,19
238,Average stay,"Pros: great breakfast, staff and decor. Rooms are big and adequately furnished. 

Cons: Hugo’s restaurant: no bread basket, only a server going around offering one slice of bread. 
I got a scallop starter. €18 got three TINY scallops. I would often purchase a scallop starter , but this was the smallest and most expensive I’ve had. 
No accompaniments with the mains. All were an extra €5.2, baring in mind the average price of a main was 35€. 
Charged €7 for a bottle of still water. I am a foodie and love a luxurious meal , but this did not meet expectation. 
Spa: not what I expected. No thermal suites/ segregated pool area for spa users. The only pool area was the general one on the floor below. My partner got a massage. I understand it was meant to be deep tissue , but marks and bruises were left on his body with how rough it was. He said it felt like a physio session. Areas were repeatedly and harshly targeted, in which he had to ask him to stop at certain times. His posture was commented on, along with other comments on him throughout the hour. He came out not feel king relaxed, and sore. For a 5 star hotel , this is not the treatment that was expected. 
Driving range: bought a coupon for the driving range. Walked across the car park to be told that there were no balls left and we would have to wait an hour. At this point we just left.",3,2024,02,18
238,A warm welcome awaits you followed by an extremely pleasant experience.,"Family friendly hotel with a tremendous staff always willing to help. We were there as a family of 13 celebrating a birthday. The food was out of this world. The service was phenomenal. Sandor in the restaurant looked after us extremely well, aided by the restaurant manager, Caitlan, who couldn't do enough to make our restaurant visits truly memorial. 

The general manager Aidan Ryan, a congenial gentleman, is on hand to oversee everything. A very hands on manager who helps to clear away tables on a busy morning breakfast. In my experience as an employer is that if you help with the staff they will very much appreciate it and this permeates throughout the hotel with all staff. 

We were so happy with the hotel that we signed up for the health club. The facilities are second to none. The pool is the warmest I have ever experienced. A lovely orientation allowing the sun to shine in. There is a jacuzzi, steam room and sauna also. 

Again a very helpful and cheerful staff always on hand to help. As I'm slightly disabled, due to several back surgeries, the staff look after me well. Fiachra is going to set out a program for me to work on in the pool to strengthen my back muscles.

There is a well equipped Gym overlooking the pool. There is also an amazing Spa and treatment center which is very luxurious. Michelle, the health club manager, is always on hand to ensure the guests have a wonderful experience.

When checking with reception you get the feeling that your stay is going to be one to remember. The reception staff are courteous, efficient and extremely helpful. 

After many visits to the hotel since last November we feel we are part of the family!",5,2024,02,18

238,We might come back to county Wicklow just to stay here,"Excellent hotel in beautiful surroundings. Spacious, clean and well appointed rooms. Live music in the bar on Saturday night. Top quality breakfast. Even the decaf coffee is amazing. We’d love to stay here again if we can find a good excuse to be back in County Wicklow.",5,2024,02,12
238,Birthday trip,"I took my other half here for his 40th and choose this hotel as a nice, slightly luxurious base while we travelled around beautiful Wicklow. The room was okay and quite spacious.

I had reserved a table for dinner before our stay but when we went down they couldn't find our reservation and the staff in the bar weren't the friendliest on the night. 

Other than that, the hotel is lovely and I just wish we had had more time to make use of the facilities there. The breakfast was good too.",4,2024,02,10
238,Overall great experience and staff,"Delicious food, great room and staff, and we loved the path way around the golf course. The only room for improvement for our point of view would be no have some loungers around pool and spa to chill.",5,2024,02,06
238,Family Getaway,"We loved everything about the hotel, rooms were perfect for 2 adults 2 children age 7 and 4. Breakfast was excellent lots of choice and the quality was amazing. Will definitely return great stay all round",5,2024,01,30
238,Incredibly Relaxing Weekend,Excellent weekend with superb service and staff. The spa and relaxation room were incredible. Food was delicious and rooms were spacious and clean. Overall a fantastic weekend and can’t wait to return. ,5,2024,01,30
238,Not a '5 star resort.' Would not recommend.,"Disappointing. Inconsistent service and poor hygiene standards. One evening while dining in its restaurant we noticed that a fresh linen tablecloth had ben placed over a filthy, disgusting tablecloth on our table. Food stains and remnants of breakfast was evident. I complained to the manager who expressed shock at what he saw. He took the cost of the wine off the bill as a gesture. However, the next morning over breakfast we observed the same practice again by a member of staff who placed a fresh tablecloth over a soiled one. This is obviously company policy or at best, poor staff training. We had to ask for one breakfast item three times before it was brought to the table. We also had to ask for the soar milk on our table to be replaced!

There is a glass shelf that runs above the bar counter where clients sit on bar stools. This was covered in dust and grime. It obviously had not been cleaned for months.

While housekeeping 'made up' the two bedrooms, they never vacuumed the floor. Quite extraordinary as there is a walking tail advertised around the hotel, yet obvious dirt on the carpet was not noticed by housekeeping. Again, simple things such as bottles of water not being replaced while the rooms were made up. So, we had to ask for the floor to be vacuumed and the water to be replaced.

Finally, I was asked to submit a review which I did, similar to the above. I received a manager's apologetic response and was informed that it would be brought to the attention of senior management. Interestingly, 3 weeks later, I have heard nothing back form the senior management!",2,2024,01,30
238,Not 5 star not 4 star,"Arrived to a nice reception from a very polite lady originally from balina mayo.Very  welcoming and professional in her manner.
That’s were it ended for us.The restaurant was closed and only food available in the bar area.As we arrived they weee closing one area which was nicely lit and had a nice fire burning away.room temp was ideal.
We were moved to The adjacent room which was  very cold  not inviting at all and without atmosphere.
We arrived hungry and looked forward to some food unfortunately the menu was very limited 
The menu in the bar had no pasta no rice no mash potato offered any of the mains 
Your choice is chips chips or chips in different guises.
The starters 
chicken wings were soggy and not cooked properly and the chowder was less than average with semi chilled brown bread 
We didn’t order a mains as a result and left hungry 
The waiter Myron was very nice in the bar area 
And dealt us the hand he was given 
I would not recommend this hotel for food 
And as it is away from the town make sure you make arrangements and eat before you arrive here if you must.
real dissatisfaction with the visit and we are considering heading off as it’s not yet 6pm 
We are hungry and it looks like a long night ahead here",2,2024,01,29
238,Overnight stay,One night visit and what a treat..we were treated to an upgrade and what a beautiful comfortable room it was..ate in the garden rooms that evening and the food was amazing as was breakfast the following morning..wonderful hotel and full praise to the staff who were warm and friendly..highly recommended,5,2024,01,28
238,Satisfying one nighter,Visited for a friend’s birthday celebration and only for one night. We’re not golfers and we didn’t use the leisure facilities so our stay was relatively expensive. However we were impressed by the hotel. Our room was spacious and very well equipped. The bathroom had a walk in shower which we feel is a must in a modern hotel. The beds were comfortable and the room was clean. The buffet breakfast was better than the standard version. We had a casual group meal that fitted the occasion perfectly. Overall an impressive and enjoyable stay. We’re unlikely to be in the area in the foreseeable future but if we were we’d happily stay here again.,5,2024,01,27
238,Birthday get away,"Enjoyed our overnight stay. Big spacious rooms. Enjoyed the pool before breakfast the next day. Loads of options for breakfast too. I just found our room a bit cold… we tried to make the heating work and even rang receptionist about it bit still not warm enough to give me a comfortable sleep. I dont think it was working.  We dined at Hugo restaurant and it was busy. We ordered fish and eventhough my husband is not a fan of it, he savoured his  meal. ",5,2024,01,23
238,Lovely short break away,"Love this hotel. Staff are so friendly, food is gorgeous and the place is so relaxing. It was our second time staying here as a family with our two toddlers and everyone enjoyed the break away and all wanted to stay for a third night. Would definitely recommend. ",5,2024,01,23
238,my stay,"Great location , terrific views , nice hotel , great staff and good food in all restaurants  , would highly recommend . Will stay again , not sure about the Guinness though but otherwise an excellent experience ",4,2024,01,23
238,Fab stay at Druids Glen,"Druids Glen is just fabulous. We stayed on a Saturday night in January and the atmosphere was unreal, the place was hopping. From the minute we arrived everything was flawless. Having cheekily requested a room upgrade for our birthdays they not only honoured it but also left a lovely little treat plate in our room. Such a nice touch. 
The hotel itself is gorgeous, modern and tastefully decorated. The rooms are lovely and cosy and the shower was amazing! The steaks in the Garden bar were perfection. Followed by music in the bar by the best one man band we’ve ever heard which really made our stay even better. 
The staff were so professional and friendly at all times. Buffet breakfast had everything you could want. Can’t recommend this place enough. I can’t wait to return. 10/10 from us. ",5,2024,01,22
238,10/10,"What can I say about Druids glen resort , it’s simple you have to experience it to truly understand what I’m about to say. 
I have been coming to Druids for almost 10 years at least once a year with my wife and sometimes twice with  our 2  boys.  The golf courses are to the highest level ( both been upgraded) and they were special before the upgrade. 
The hotel is as they describe it “ fall under the spell “ we stay 2 night 1st more casual at the bar and the 2nd night we get dolled up at go to Hugo’s . Both different but both excellent. 
The breakfast is out of this world and there is  no expense spared with anything. The staff from check in to check out are well trained , pleasant and helpful and nothing is  too much trouble. 
The spa, gym , pool etc are again all you need .  
So basically try it out and you will not be disappointed and you will return 👌",5,2024,01,18
238,Excellent Christmas Stay! Will be returning!,"We stayed there just before Christmas, it was fantastic! 

All of the staff throughout the golf club, reception, bar and restaurant were very accommodating, with a special mention for Conor and Jose in the bar for their excellent service throughout the night. The live music in the bar was excellent. I will definitely be returning",5,2024,01,16
238,Great for a short break from Dublin,We went to Druid's Glen for a short post Christmas break. It is perfect for families with games room and a nice pool. There's an outdoor playground for younger children. Staff were lovely and food was good too. The kids loved the mountains of pancakes available at breakfast!,5,2024,01,09
238,"Excellent experience, will be returning","Amazing weekend away with girlfriend for our anniversary where I ended up proposing. The staff were amazing and most helpful, we were kids free this time but they were many family's there with kids , playrooms and playgrounds were available. Grounds were lovely for a walk, food was ok but we went to Mountkennedy Inn for food, lovely with music entertainment in the evening. ",5,2024,01,09
238,Terrible service!,"Four of us went up for a drink at the bar.
The service was terrible. The staff were all foreign and did not understand us very well. They were not very friendly. I used to like the Druids Glen, but have no desire to go back again. What a pity!",2,2024,01,09
238,Lovely overnight stay,"An unforgettable night! My wife and I were welcomed warmly at Druid's Glen. The room was stunning, the food incredible, and the service top-notch. A perfect romantic escape, which are precious these days as we have 4 young children, so when we leave them it has to be worth it. Can't wait to go back!",5,2024,01,08
238,Sensational,"Another return visit with my children and Grandchildren. 
I have to say this hotel is sensational. 
On arrival we had 5 rooms booked, The check in was flawless and the attention to detail was excellent. 
The receptionist went above and beyond to settle us in. 
We have booked dinner in the  lounge  on the first night.
It was excellent food and service perfect, 
We booked Hugo’s restaurant for the Second night and the setting in the private room always incredible. I have to say the staff are exceptional professional and the food was excellent. 
The kids spent most of the time swimming or in the kids club. 
The location of the hotel  is close to Greystones and on day 2 we spent a delightful couple of hours in the village. 
All in all we have a very plesemt time at Druids glen. I would highly recommend this 5 star hotel and look forward to returning very soon. 
Many thanks to the manager Aidane Ryan and his team particularly the assistant manager for making our trip more special 
Thanks you very much you and your team are  credit to a true 5 star experience.
Congratulations.
Needles only to say if your not familiar with this hotel your missing out. It really is excellent. 
Exceptional service incredible food and Sensational location. 
Many thanks 
🙏",5,2024,01,05
238,Wouldn't recommend.  This is not a 5 star experience.,"Honest account of our experience.  We really didn't enjoy it and had a number of complaints throughout.  These were genuine complaints, we weren't looking for faults.  From noise outside our, to the TV's in our suite not working, to our table not being ready for our booking and numerous others, it was a really poor experience.",1,2024,01,03
238,Nice place in the country side,"This was a very pleasant stay 😊
We didn’t try so much of what was available as the main purpose was to relax 
We gave it 5 out of 5, maybe with a minus in a few areas. 
Partly because this was more a family resort rather than a couples resort. E.g. we were there for New Year’s Eve and the only fireworks were at 5pm - for the kids. The kids who I may add were up until midnight anyhow. 
Good food and service at the hotel. 
Parking close enough and WiFi was stable and quick enough.",5,2024,01,02
238,Review,"Hotel is lovely, family friendly, rooms are nice but the food is terrible. We had dinner in the bar and breakfast. The food is average for a 5 star setting and overpriced for what you get. If the food improved I would return.",4,2023,12,30
238,Great for kids by a kid,"This review was written by Aron aged 10:  staff are unbelievably kind and gave us free chocolates x2, hot chocolate and colouring in menus. There were x2 Christmas movies to pick from. We got up at 7:00am and we were the first in for breakfast. We were surprised to see that there was enough food for a kingdom. Unbelievable room service - had a bubble bath and loved my robe and slippers after. We went on the 23rd of Dec and the decorations were so Christmassy. I recommend the Avondale treetop Christmas lights walk but anyone who's 5 and below - I don't think very young kids would like it but if your child can handle heights it's great. A very good, beautiful place. I give it 5 star, a very nice place and in all honesty recommend this hotel",5,2023,12,24
238,Lovely stay ,"Bed so comfy, linen crisp , staff amazing, so attentive and lovely , actually so nice .Food was top class just delicious and just a lovely stay . I stayed Powerscourt recently but Druid’s Glen wiped the floor of them . 

Thank you

238,Couples Escape,"We had an amazing stay at Druids Glen, From the reception staff, to bar staff to restaurant staff, every single person was chatty, attentive, courteous and friendly. I have never experienced such great customer service. Will definitely return, beautiful hotel and amazing food in Hugos bar!",5,2023,12,21
238,Excellent staff and service ,"Myself and my family have stayed here several times over the last few years. We had no complaints at all and the facilities including the two golf courses are top class. There are also some lovely walks around the grounds.
I need to mention Mark in the bar who is an absolute gent along with Jose. They really made the difference for us and are the reason why we keep coming back.",5,2023,12,13
238,Badly run hotel.  Won't return,"Our family of 4 arrived at 3pm. Was informed our room should be read by 3:40. Instead of waiting we brought our 2 kids swimming. After our quick swim our room was ready and luggage was already there for us which was good. We had bar food booked for 7pm. We went to the bar at 5pm to have pre drinks before our meal. When we got to the bar it was very busy but there was 4 or 5 free tables that we found out were actually reserved. I've never been to a hotel were you need to reserve a table for drinks. We then asked the waiter where we should go and he put us in a spill off room with zero atmosphere to have our drinks. Half way through the drink a women came and told us we can't have our drink there so made us move to the lobby. When we sat down in the lobby, the waiter came after us for not paying our bill!! He was apologetic once I told him we were asked to leave the place where he had put us. On the next order, the young waiter with poor English couldn't understand me, so he struggled to get the order right. The food in the bar was fine but pricy. 

The next morning, we had a lovely breakfast before we brought our kids swimming before check out. We got to the pool at 11am in our swim gear and bath robes only to be informed that kids weren't allowed in between 11am and 2pm!!!. Ridiculous, but what was worse was we had not been informed of this hotel rule, there was no information pack in the room and there was no obvious signs anywhere to state this. We left the pool with 2 very disappointed young kids. 

On check out we relayed our issues to the girl at the desk who got the manger to speak to us. He stood and listened to our issues. His response was to ask if we wanted to come back at 2pm to swim. Which frankly was ridiculous. As we had a 2hr drive home and we were checked out at 12pm but he thought we'd hang around until 2pm to bring our kids swimming.  We paid to use the hotel and its facilities from 3pm Saturday until 12pm Sunday. So not to allow kids to swim after 11am is frankly ridiculous.  We were informed this is done to keep the leisure centre members happy. They are obviously more important to the hotel than the hotel guests that pay huge money to stay are. We left the hotel very disappointed with nothing but a business card from the manger.",2,2023,12,11
238,Nice!,"Lovely hotel but a tad tired - maybe a freshen up would make it feel more 5star. Spa was lovely, had the most amazing facial from Davor - incredible. However the massage was dire and for the price a huge let down - thought it was just me but the couples we stayed with said the same.
But all around good service, the bar staff and housekeepers were incredible - friendly, helpful and just lovely to interact with. ",4,2023,12,03
238,Wedding Anniversary,"We had our 50th Wedding Anniversary with our families last year. We returned this year just ourselves for one night. Checked in about 3 pm. Had a drink in bar and dinner at 18:00 in Garden Room. Brilliant service from Slovakian waitress who was brilliant

238,A hidden gem .,Stayed recently at Druids Glen . It was my first time and I will definitely return. Lovely sitting areas to chill and relax. Exceptional service from all staff. Comfortable beds with lovely bed linen.,5,2023,12,01
238,Great Night Away,"Stayed in Druids Glen recently with my partner the experience was fantastic. The room was amazing and the staff ensured our stay was memorable! 
Dinner service was great especially on a busy Saturday night.
Can’t recommend Karen in Reservations enough, so helpful and quick to respond! ",5,2023,12,01
238,"Amazing bed and room, food awful","Food in bar was awful. We had to go into newtown mount kennedy after our meal for another. Burger greasy and charred and salmon bagel, the bagel was like a rock. Very disappointing. 
Bed amazing, housekeeping amazing. Breakfast suffice. ",2,2023,12,01
238,Lovely relaxing place to stay,"From entering the hotel it was instant relaxation, no hassle or issues. We had lovely food and really enjoyed the Jacuzzi and sauna. The  lovely staff just want to make your stay perfect. Our suite was very comfortable.
Will be back in the summer",5,2023,11,30
238,Excellent break away,We enjoyed our break & we didn't have too far to travel. We couldn't get a spa appointment because it was booked out but others said it was good. Beds very comfortable & rooms were clean & well stocked tea/coffee facilities. ,5,2023,11,24
238,Druid's Glen does it better...,"We have reviewed Druid’s Glen quite a few times, mostly because we keep returning, and the hotel hit’s the spot every time. Any hotel can invest in comfortable beds, clean rooms and provide a good breakfast.  Druid’s Glen does all that too, but it does it better.  So well, every time we check out to go home, we start thinking about when we will return.   We love the location, we love the peace and quiet, we love the food.   We love the fact that we are still meeting staff who were there when we first visited about 10 years ago.  Two particular mentions – Thomas managing the breakfast service is a joy to behold, and thank you to  Karen in the Reservations team.  See you in 2024. ",5,2023,11,19
238,Great stay at a beautiful hotel,"Druids Glen is a high end, but family friendly hotel. The staff maintain a consistently high level of quality and service. The facilities are all top drawer and the food in the restaurant/bar is excellent.",5,2023,11,07
238,Very disappointing,I made the mistake of informing reception I had a voucher which was a wedding gift. Amazingly the room turned out to be the same monetary value of the voucher which was €345 Very overpriced and staff were very poor at reception trying to get us to pay for food which was included in our package. Would not stay here again.,2,2023,11,07
238,Lovely hotel but no sound proofing,This hotel is gorgeous. Beautiful grounds and very comfortable well designed rooms. However they are really not sound proof. We could hear every conversation of people walking past the room 24hrs a day. The most frustrating was kids running up and down the corridor from 7am to midnight. We paid a sitter for our 1st weekend away in 4 years but were still woken by kids both mornings. ,3,2023,11,06
238,Review,"Druids Glen is an exceptional hotel! From start to finish we were made to feel welcome and that the staff look after out every need! The food, service, room, pool and staff are all 10/10! We cannot wait to stay again! ",5,2023,11,04
238,Nice stay,"The staff are all very friendly and helpful. The room we stayed in had not been properly hoovered. The bar dining area has tables at the back of sofas where people are sitting, which is not great for anyone. It could be a great dining spot if it was redesigned. We were eventually moved and the staff were very nice about it. ",4,2023,11,03
238,Always above and beyond,Had a fantastic stay as a family and returning guest. This hotel never disappoints and the staff always go beyond. Kids were given Halloween treats delivered to our room which was a very generous and unexpected gift. The playroom is still fantastic asset for the kids to have a place to go and they thoroughly enjoyed making friends. The pool is always warm and inviting place to be and the changing rooms are fantastic. We booked garden room bar for dinner on both nights and we all enjoyed our meals. This hotel has never disappointed us and we plan to return soon again. ,5,2023,11,02
238,Night away with dinner and spa,Broken heating in room 132 staff did not seem to care. Also dinner in Hugo restaurant was not great for money spent on Sunday b/holiday wknd. Overall place has nice location and decor but lacks service of 5 star hotel ,3,2023,10,31
238,Ok,It was ok overall but the dinning room and large seating area from bar were uncomfortably cold and staff were already aware of that as an issue that was not being addressed by management. Expected more than that considering the price and star rating.,3,2023,10,27
238,Great Midweek Break,"Treated very well all staff well trained and made us welcome and cared for all our needs.
Rooms very clean and the few extras were a welcome surprise.
Food was excellent a great Menu with plenty of choice.",5,2023,10,26
238,"It was just amazing, ","It was perfect   The front of house team were warm in thier greeting. The hotel  was warm and cosy. The hotel was spotless. All staff were very pleasant . 

The breakfast was great, a wide range of foods available. 
The spa area also great the pool nice and warm and all areas spotless .

We have stayed here a few times so it never fails
Looking forward to our next visit
Many thanks",5,2023,10,25
238,Money grabbing rip-off merchants....BEWARE!,We booked a family room with this hotel about 6 weeks ago. We were given the full cost at the time of booking- vert clearly online and in the confirmation email. We were then told last week- some two weeks before our stay- that an additional €25 was being added to our bill because we had a child. This was despite the fact that we entered this at the booking stage- on their own website. There were no indications at the time of booking that this may happen. When challenged about this on the phone they offered a well worn line (i.e. they have done this a lot!) that their website could not cope with our type of booking initially- despite every single hotel website I've ever used being able to do it! As a point of principle we cancelled there and then on the spot- they were not even that nice about things so why we give them hundreds of euros for room and food etc with an attitude and opportunistic price gouging attitude like that. Do yourself a favour and do business with someone more honest and less disingenous than this establishment.,1,2023,10,24
238,Service continues to get better ,"We stayed in druids in September for a quick one night break away with our little daugther who is 3. Druids is the only hotel we continue to return to multiple times a year as you are guaranteed top class service every time. The staff are brilliant from reception to waiting staff, everyone we came in contact with was so professional and spoke to and interacted with  our daughter molly which means alot. We got a room that had a view of the houses and I phoned reception asking would it be possible to get a change of room with a view of the grounds to which eithout hesitation they done so for us which they didn't have to. We have stayed in hotels in ireland that say they are family orientated and cater more so for children but I have yet to receive better service then druids when it comes to our daughter. I always give honest reviews to druids and they always listen to what you have to say in regards to your thoughts on your stay. One thing i will say is it would be lovely if they changed around the bar menu as it hasnt really changed over the last few years but again not a fault as he food is always good. We are returning in November again and cannot wait.

238,A great hotel for a family break,"The hotel was very comfortable and our room was clean with very comfortable beds. The staff were lovely, very friendly and accommodating. We only wish that we had booked another night’s stay. Also the food was very good.",5,2023,10,23
238,Amazing staff made for a lovely stay,"Wonderful welcoming friendly staff, a lovely atmosphere and buzz around the place. Our room was lovely, the bed and pillows were so comfortable. Our meal in Hugo's was exceptional, the staff were so attentive and the food was delicious, such a treat. We really enjoyed our stay. It was lovely to see lots of families enjoying their stays there too. Breakfast was ok, but the scrambled eggs were powdery and not edible. The coffee was very very strong and the toast was burnt. Beautiful grounds to walk around, especially in autumn. I had a lovely massage and the relaxation room is really fabulous. All in all an amazing stay. We looks forward to our next 24 hour break from the business of life. Thank you. ",5,2023,10,22
238,Fantastic hotel in every way,"Beautiful room, very spacious and well equipped including fridge, separate bath & shower, robes & slippers and gorgeous Elemis  toiletries.  No hair conditioner but was given an ample supply when requested.  Towels so soft and fluffy they felt like new. Staff were so friendly, helpful and efficiently professional. Breakfast good quality and choice and very tasty. Surrounding grounds and walking trails so lovely too. We so enjoyed our stay here and look forward to coming back. ",5,2023,10,20
238,Very slow service ,"My family had dinner in the bar on Saturday afternoon. The bar wasn't that busy at all and at one point there were only 3 tables occupied but the service was really lacking. We had to ask a number of times for someone to take our order. We ordered for the children first and the children had finished eating their food before someone came back to take the food order for the adults. They got one of our drinks wrong and instead of apologizing the waiter told us we don't have that. It was no problem to substitute the drink for what was in stock but i wish he had explained when we ordered rather than being annoyed that we questioned why he brought a different drink. The food was ok, usual pub grub. The grounds are lovely but based on the service i wouldn't return.  ",3,2023,10,19
238,A 2 night stay,"Not satisfied from Hugo’s Restaurant.
Druïdes Glen Hotel promised a luxury four course dinner and all we got was a starter (1), main dish (2) and a dessert (3). The side dish (4) we had to pay as an extra!!! I complaintes for this on the réception and they told me that the coffee was the fourth course????",4,2023,10,18
238,Caitríona Fitzpatrick,"We had a fantastic stay here, great staff and hotel, would recommend going for the Autumn package. Beds are very comfy, food is delicious and surroundings are beautiful. Made for a lovely mid week break away and would definitely do it again ",5,2023,10,16
238,Lovely spot but just lacks what it used to stand for.,"Just returned after a night stay and felt I should review.

We have been visiting Druids for many years and would say it’s the hotel in Ireland that always set the standard for any other hotel we ever stay in.   The thing that we have always enjoyed is how tentative the staff have been but without being intrusive.  

The setting is stunning and on arrival we found a car parking space with no issue and check in was very smooth.   
We stayed in a superior room with views of the mountains.  The room had loads of space, great selection of toiletries, robe and slippers etc, the room was also very close to the pool.   TV could have used having some radio channels, but other than that the room was excellent.

The pool facilities are good, however it was grubby with almost like a black grease running down from the roof at the left hand side of the pool and with the bright sunshine, the windows needed a real good clean.  Shame as the pool is nice and has good facilities.

Now what I was really disappointed with was the lack of tentative hospitality that we always had enjoyed with Druids.   At the bar we ordered an Espresso Martini and it was really poor.   Later we went back to the bar and I stood for easily 5 minutes whilst all the staff just chatted in the corner with one another.   It felt like they had no real pride in what they were doing and it just seemed like they couldn’t be bothered.  I understand a wait if it’s busy and they are running about flat out, but they just all stood laughing among themselves.  
The food at dinner was excellent, we had Stonebass and John Dory, it really was absolutely stunning, but again…. Service just was bit of a let down and when I tried to order wine from one of the staff he kind of grunted and just pointed at another member of staff?  He could have went over to said to his colleague but I guess it was my job again?
Breakfast was good, loads of choice, papers and plenty of space.  Again though, after being shown to our seat we had to call for a member of staff to order coffee and then another staff member to order toast?  

So the shine over a stay was taken off due to multiple things.   As mentioned, these were things in the past we always found second to none, and whilst disappointing when you spend over £500 for a night away, we will return.",3,2023,10,15
238,Highly recommend ,"We really cannot fault this hotel. A really lovely hotel, with character and ambiance, while also welcoming families. The hotel has been maintained to a high standard. Rooms are excellent and spacious. Pool is one of the best hotel pools we've been to. Bar food was delicious. Special mention to all the staff who are very friendly and welcoming. This makes such a difference.",5,2023,10,09
238,5 star in every way ,"Very welcoming and informative check in and very pleasant check out. We booked a family room and the kids robes and slippers were a nice touch. Kids playroom, walking trail which leads you around the unbelievable golf course and the spa which exceeded every expectation. Food was very good too. ",5,2023,10,07
238,Relaxing stay ,Staff very friendly and helpful. Bedroom was nice and bed was very comfortable with lovely pillows. Spa is very nice and treatment  lovely and relaxing. The only complaint I had was the hairdryer in the bedroom as it had no head on it which made it impossible to dry my hair without making it frizzy. I have stayed in hotels with less star ratings that had much better hairdryers. I stayed in Castleknock hotel and there was a Dyson hairdryer with all the fittings.  Food in the hotel was very nice and everything was very clean,4,2023,10,03
238,Druids Glen Golf Course and Hotel.,"Excellent hotel and stunning golf course with great on site facilities.  The Glen course (which is a must play for any golfer) is stunning and presented in top condition and is a real challenge for any golfer; the Heath course is also a good challenge but not presented in the same way as the Glen (but still a good course).  Hotel facilities are excellent and you have everything in one place, worth the trip.",5,2023,10,02
238,Relaxing Family Stay,"We had a lovely two night stay at Druids Glen this week. The hotel had a very relaxed atmosphere even though it was quite busy with golfing & wedding parties. The staff were fantastic, especially Mark in the Garden Rooms who was so lovely to our kids & wonderful at his job. The food was delicious & our room was really comfortable & spacious. Cocktails were very expensive but that's the only gripe I can pick out of the visit.  Lovely heated swimming pool that our kids loved. Would definitely return!",5,2023,10,01
238,Superb hotel and fabulous golf courses.,"35 ladies descended on this fantastic hotel nestled in the beautiful Irish countryside. A short journey from Dublin this hotel ranks highly both for service and great food. 
I experienced the most friendly welcome from staff. Absolutely nothing was too much trouble. 
The beds and pillows so comfortable a lot of us ladies are planning on buying duplicates for home. 
The staff in the clubhouse and around the golf courses simply superb! They couldn’t do enough to make up for the disappointment of a rainy first day. 
I’m coming back with my husband in the spring and hope to make this a regular trip. Hugo’s restaurant top class.",5,2023,10,01
238,Every time worth a stay,"We knew this Hotel from a further stay years ago. The refreshing  give the setting now a new glow and comfortable impression. Staff was always at hand to help. Very nice, friendly and competent Staff at the garden room/bar. ",4,2023,09,25
238,Druids Glen,This is a lovely hotel set in lovely grounds.  The staff are very friendly & helpful but I would not recommend for children.  The Children's menu is very poor especially for younger children & accessing snacks  for children  ie. sandwich or soup out side restaurant hours is poor to say the least.,4,2023,09,25
238,Capital investment needed,Place has gone downhill an awful lot over the years. Definitely not a 5* experience. There were some positives. Afternoon tea was good. Spa treatments were good. by an large though a lot of money to be spent to bring the hotel up to standard,2,2023,09,25
238,Relax and recharge.,We were blessed with dry bright weather  and did the hotel walk. Which was really relaxing.  The pool is clean and warm and  has a nice connection to the outside. Gym was quiet and clean too. All the staff are friendly and productive in the Druid Glen.  Breakfast was lovely and the staff were really helpful. Food was really good in the restaurant. We all agree it would  be nice to have a boiled or baked potatoes with the fish main course.  Rather than ordering sides . The hotel guests  were respectful walking back to rooms at night from bar etc. We slept so well and left the hotel feeling great. Thank you  Druid Glen. ,5,2023,09,23
238,Tired hotel in beautiful setting ,"We spent one night at the Druids Glen resort for a combination of leisure and business.

Reception and restaurant/breakfast area is looking very nice.
The personnel is kind and efficient.

The rooms are big but unfortunately need a complete refurbishment;
The bathrooms are old, many features are broken in the room, the carpets are in a terrible state (and don't smell very good...)
Bedding was ok

Breakfast was very nice - we also had drinks and dinner - it was ok but it could become very noisy when the golf players were hitting the bar and surroundings....

",3,2023,09,21
238,Great place for golf and stay!,"We love this place, very nice out of the way place, restful, quiet.  Played golf and the course was gorgeous.  We also celebrated our anniversary there. Hugo's Restaurant was great and so was the Tavern.  We will be back!",5,2023,09,14
238,Micheleit,Ita a lovely hotel but  because the room was dusty and started my sinus off it didn't meet my expectations. Staff were over the top when eating constantly asking if your ok all I wanted to do was eat and enjoy,4,2023,09,14
238,Enjoyable.,"Travelled with two small kids. Service from the staff was excellent. Helpful and friendly. Pool really warm and clean. Breakfast was good, good selection. Food in the bar was really lovely, along with the service from our waiter Mark. The lobby of the hotel is beautiful. Kids loved the indoor play room, the playground outside needs a revamp.  Room was not up to standard imo, it looked like the carpet was not hoovered when we arrived, there was eggshells and other dirt on it , also the carpet was stained in a few places. The tv is very limited, and a few stations that come up are not actually available, ie Nickelodeon. The back of the wardrobe in the shelf section kept falling in on our clothes. There was no battery cover on the air con remote, I found this dangerous with a toddler in the room! Beds are comfortable. Bathroom was clean but dated. The small things in the room are overlooked and brought the experience down. ",3,2023,09,14
238,Family celebration,Absolutely fantastic weekend here from start to finish. It’s the perfect hotel for a family get together. Something for all ages. Fantastic service as always and such a great atmosphere in the hotel which is sometimes lacking in a lot of hotels. 5 stars all round. ,5,2023,09,11
238,A delightful Afternoon Tea,"We visited Druids Glen Hotel on August 26th for Afternoon Tea to celebrate our friends 60th birthday from the time we arrived till we left it was a most amazing experience the treatment we received from Thomas our waiter was fabulous he is a lovely kind helpful young man couldn’t do enough for us and made us feel so welcome even came out with a special dessert for Annette and with the managers they sang happy birthday she was thrilled to say the least
Thank you for a lovely afternoon we will be back soon
Regards 
Cynthia, Annette, Rosemaree and Mary ",5,2023,09,04
238,Ann Murphy,"Would highly recommend this hotel, look out for Abbey at reception she was absolutely wonderful member of staff , couldn't do enough for us. Thank you Abbey. look forward to staying in Druids Glen Hotel again.",5,2023,08,30
238,not a 5 star experience,"This was far from a 5 star experience. So moral of the story is please dont say its 5 star. We are not people  who complain or wish too, but our expectations of what the experience would be and what actually it was can only be described in one word disappointment. Food was average  and the atmosphere was just like been in a mad house from start to finish. Never again. Apologies for this negative but honest review. I can see some hard workers lost in the chaos and its out of their control. A pity because it is a great location",2,2023,08,29
238,Enjoyable Family break,"Family trip to Druids Glen . Interconnecting family rooms were great. Spacious with a view. 
Kids loved the swimming pool … it’s warm too! 
Breakfast is not a 5* star experience so the hotel needs to work on this but our second breakfast was much better than the first.  
The setting is beautiful and the garden bar/restaurant suited our family for evening meals. The staff were excellent in the garden bar. 
The games room for kids was well equipped , small playground also but I think the hotel could do more to entertain kids & adults alike given the number of families staying during summer. An enjoyable break.",4,2023,08,28
238,"Great hotel and experience, will be back again!","We stayed from Thursday to Saturday. Really nice experience from start to finish. Good facilities for my 3 year old with playroom, walks and outdoor playground.

Staff were really nice to deal with, attentive and polite. Food was lovely and had great options in the garden rooms bar for my kid.

Room was great with super view. Lovely large bathroom and generally, nice clean room to stay.

The swimming pool and facilities were great, didn’t want to leave and again, my 3 ye old loved her time here. Will be back again ",5,2023,08,27
238,😁,"We were upgraded to executive suite as was wedding anniversary,  such as lovely gesture, and really appreciated.  Staff were fantastic,  food was also. We had a very relaxing and enjoyable visit, and will definitely be back soon. Thanks to all. ",4,2023,08,26
238,Family break,Really enjoyed our mini break in Druids glen- two rooms were beautiful and well equipped. The golf course which surrounds the hotel is stunning! We are in garden rooms and food was delicious and whole family enjoyed wide array of food available for breakfast.it’s a great base for exploring Wicklow. We will definitely be back as husband and daughters dying to play golf course ,5,2023,08,24
238,Nice,Great location and nice hotel . Great food . Nice walks and scenery . Close to the sea and greystones . Clean rooms and helpful staff . Don’t play golf but the coarse looks great. Very relaxing experience. ,3,2023,08,24
238,A lovely trip,"Really enjoyable 4 night stay with family. 3 children aged 12,11 and 9. The hotel hasn’t changed much since our last visit almost 8 years ago but it is still excellent. Breakfast was just brilliant with plenty of options other than the traditional cooked breakfast. The meals we had in were very good, with special note to Hugo’s where the service and food were both excellent. Service in the bar area was slow especially for food but we weren’t in a hurry. Kids went to kids club for one evening and enjoyed it. The sports club during the day turned out to be only 45 mins long and parents had to accompany the kids so we didn’t stay for that. Kids must be out of the pool by 11am which wasn’t ideal but was explained at check in. Only negative is that the pool/spa area has become a bit jaded over time and could do with some investment. Used this hotel as a base to explore Powerscourt, Avoca and Avondale. Beautiful part of the world. Husband played golf and was very impressed with the course and facilities. A lovely break. ",5,2023,08,23
238,Beautiful hotel in stunning location,"We stayed here for a wedding, very relaxing room with calming colours. Bed was super comfy. Nespresso machine was great. Loccitane in the bathrooms. Gorgeous breakfast the next morning. Especially loved the smoothies! We did a walk in the beautiful grounds too. ",5,2023,08,21
238,Above and beyond service,"The hotel and staff were extremely welcoming and accommodating. Check in was efficient with ample check in locations. The facility was impeccably clean with spacious rooms. Our view overlooked The Glenn course and the tree tops. Adrienne, at the front desk, gave us splendid recommendations for off site dinning and arranged for our transportation. When a storm rolled through and many of the golf courses were closed, Robbie( the manager)  took it upon himself to arrange a tee time at an open course and arranged our transportation to and from the venue. He also help 2 members of our party get out for 9 holes at The Glenn, the course they were suppose to play the day before but it was closed due to the storm. Both Adrienne and Robbie went above and beyond to accommodate our group and I would recommend anyone to stay and play here on their travels.",5,2023,08,20
238,Dublin Duffers 2023 Golf Trip,"Outstanding experience during our entire  stay. Adrienne (front desk) and Robbie (Mgr)  were standout A storm knocked down trees, closing the Glen and Robbie (Mgr) got us another tee time/arranged a shuttle, then came back the next day and squeezed us onto the Glen.  Adrienne booked us dinner at the Castle/provided transportation and was always there to handle all questions and give us support with a smile.  The Pub was was an awesome place to have a post-round drink and the breakfast buffet and dinners were excellent.  Room accommodations were spot on and the views of the golf course was spectacular.  Hats off to all of the staff at Druids Glen who were there for us doing our stay!",5,2023,08,20
238,The hotel was very clean and staff very friendly food was lovely but golf is very expensive but noisy during the night.,The hotel was very clean and staff very friendly but my husband is a golfer and golf is very expensive.guestwere very noisy at night returning to rooms but other than that really enjoyed our stay and will return ,4,2023,08,19
238,Amazing Stay at Druids Glen Hotel,"Stayed at Druids Glen Hotel for my husband's special Birthday. Had a wonderful experience here with great facilities, friendly staff and attention to detail.  Beds were very comfortable and breakfast served until 10.45am.  Will return for sure and looking forward to our next stay at this great hotel.",5,2023,08,19
238,Highly recommend for families,Highly recommend this hotel and spa. Went as a family of 5 and we all can’t wait to go back. We used the leisure facilities which were excellent as well as the restaurants on several occasions. Food was excellent along with the staff. The kids enjoyed an hour at the driving range arranged by the hotel… and we even took a wee picnic on the grounds one of the days as the weather was great and the place has amazing views and walks around. Looking forward to our next visit.,5,2023,08,19
238,Family Wedding.,A very memorable family wedding.We had stayed at the hotel previously and this time they did not disappoint .This hotel offers consistent and an excellent level of customer service throughout every aspect of one's stay.,5,2023,08,19
238,Lovely Hotel,"Great staff.  Super breakfast with loads of choice.  Lovely reception area. Large very clean rooms. Lots to do and see in the surrounding countryside like Avondale, Avoca, Britts beach and Russborough House.
Only negative is the pool - not 5 star and needs some supervision and updating.",5,2023,08,18
238,"Fabulous! Amazing food, the friendliest staff and most comfortable beds.","Staff 10/10 , couldn’t have been nicer or more pleasant.
Bar food 7/10 
Hugo’s 9/10 , the food was soo good full of flavour 
Beds were soo comfortable and the air con was amazing as it gets very stuffy in hotel rooms sometimes. 
The spa experience was heaven , the staff are brilliant at their jobs and very professional. 
Although we didn’t have children with us we noticed and commented how well the staff interacted with the children and you could tell this makes families experiences more enjoyable . 
Would highly recommend this hotel and we will definitely be back ! 
",5,2023,08,18
238,Not an expected experience,Rooms are tired and need refurbishment.  Balcony was most disappointing as it was an extremely small juliet balcony. I don't feel this hotel warrants a five star award. Generally staff were friendly and this is a welcome experience given our disappointment with the overall hotel.,3,2023,08,17
238,Birthday Break.,"We booked a two night stay with one evening meal but ate in the hotel on both nights. The hotel, food and surroundings were great, staff were also very attentive which made for a very enjoyable break.  Thoroughly recommended.",5,2023,08,16
238,Lovely hotel,Hotel set in a beautiful location away from everything. Staff very friendly. Food in the bar and Hugo’s restaurant was absolutely beautiful. We actually got engaged when we arrived when we arrived in the gardens of the hotel. And from the moment staff went above and beyond to make us feel so special. Pool facilities were lovely very clean. Spa was lovely I had a facial and it was amazing. Breakfast was lovely so much to choose from. A wonderful weekend break that I’ll never forget. Will definitely return to this hotel. ,5,2023,08,14
238,Enjoyable stay...but slightly underwhelming ,"We had a generally pleasant stay at the hotel.  Friendly staff, convenient location, spacious rooms, overall cleanliness, and reasonable price. However, we were disappointed by not to able to eat at the bar in the evenings ss we hadn't booked in advance. We did manage to have one meal there, the food was only average, although the cocktails were quite enjoyable.  There was little or no atmosphere in the bar.
I'm uncertain about returning with kids. The kids activity golf introduction was very bad (here is a ball and a club, bye) , while the paid evening kids club was a big hit with our daughter. The children's playroom could use improvement, a modest investment could have a big impact given limited options for kids. 
The same could be said for the fairy walk and picnic area. The sauna area near the pool could also benefit from some maintenance. Though we encountered minor housekeeping issues, the staff was consistently helpful and pleasant.  It is the this and the pleasent breakfast staff that made the stay pleasent. ",4,2023,08,13
238,Stay at druids glen,"Very good stay and would recommend druids glen, hotel was spotless and all staff were very helpful, overall facilities were excellent. Hotel provided good value for money particularly for a 5 star resort, the spa and pool was excellent and the evening menu was very good. Breakfast was also excellent. ",4,2023,08,11
238,Another amazing stay,"This is our favourite hotel to go as a couple for a relaxing night away. The staff are so helpful, friendly and welcoming. The beds are like marshmallows and pillows and duvets the same. 
Our most recent visit was one of our favourites. The 5 star is in quality of service, quality of bedding, quality of breakfast.
The reception is lovely to sit and have a drink with comfy sofas and a lovely fire. ",5,2023,08,10
238,Summer Break,"Druids Glen never disappoints us. It is a very family friendly hotel and for the past number of summers we have taken our grandchildren. Our room was spacious, comfortable and very clean. Once you went to your room at night, there was no noise or disturbance to disturb your sleep. Housekeeping called everyday. Breakfasts were so good they set you up for the day. We ate in the Garden Room and thought the children’s menu was brilliant with loads to choose from. Staff were really nice and made us feel so welcome.",5,2023,08,10
238,Well worth a visit,"This was our first visit and will definately come back. A great hotel with excellent service, Staff were very helpful and friendly. We had a lovely relaxing stay. The Food was gorgeous and there is a lovely relaxing atmosphere.",5,2023,08,07
238,Fantastic Stay,"Everything about our stay, the spa, golf, dining etc was 1st class.  Staff were attentive and genuinely interested in making our stay as good as possible.  Facilities were outstanding. Definitely coming back",5,2023,08,02
238,Excellent Family Break ,Stayed two nights on a family holiday. On arrival I was impressed with the reception area which is spacious and welcoming. A lovely young man helped us to our room with our luggage which was appreciated. We dined in the garden bar and the service was seamless and everyone enjoyed their meal. Bar staff also very friendly. Our family room was large and we had a great stay. I would recommend to anyone seeking a relaxing family break. The main take away from the break was the friendly and professional staff and the beauty of Wicklow in itself. ,5,2023,08,02
238,Overall good but its the details that elevate a hotel experience to a 5 star that are sadly missing,"I first came here when Druids Glenn opened and it was luxurious then. However, I don't see any of the decor has been updated in a while, the rooms really need a revamp. Look closely and itsa little disappointing, you see that its worn around the edges and looking a little tired. Its in details that a hotel elevates itself to 5 star status and here it lacks. Nespresso machine in room not working. Beds were super comfortable though. Breakfast was buffet style and average. Food in bar was good and I can't fault the service as staff were friendly and accommodating. Overall I really enjoyed my night away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. Great place to catch up with friends. Pool was nice and not overly busy Saturday evening.  Again I think it could do with a bit of a revamp, You can see its dated. Its a bit over priced for what it is now, if they revamped it maybe they could justify the prices. ",4,2023,08,02
238,Lovely Stay,Had another wonderful stay at Druids Glen. The wonderful warm welcome to general service was first class. The Bar & Garden room is a lovely haven to relax with friends and family or the main lobby with a book and a drink. The decor is very fitting and the breakfast fantastic with plenty of options and attentive service. The walking trail was well received after a big breakfast. Can't wait to return.,4,2023,08,02
238,very enjoyable,"i stayed with my partner and we had a beautiful stay. the rooms are very spacious and well kept. food in the restaurant was magnificent and the staff for our whole visit were just so friendly and pleasant. particular note to the breakfast staff. a pleasure to meet. If i could say that the pool, sauna, jacuzzi is looking outdated and does need doing up but overall we had a super experience. dont forget to walk off the breakfast with the 5km trail through the grounds. very enjoyable",5,2023,08,02
238,Homely welcome with 5 star service,"This visit surpassed my expectations and very well done to the team! The website photos don't do the ambience and warmth of the place justice. There was a homely and safe feeling to the venue with 5 star service, and the breakfast had the best quality ingredients. L'Occitane products throughout. Lovely obliging and professional team and magnificent grounds. Wonderful experience. Thank you all. ",5,2023,08,01
238,Great night away,"Food was superb, staff were excellent, upgraded to suite when requesting quiet room, lovely breakfast, lovely relaxed atmosphere, would be delighted to
Book again. Would highly recommend for rest and relaxation ",5,2023,08,01
238,Amazing stay.,I had an amazing stay at this hotel. The bedrooms and ensuites were really spacious and the Spa was so relaxing. The staff were so friendly and helpful and there was a nice atmosphere about the place. Can't wait to go back again!,5,2023,07,30
238,Great stay - fab staff,"Just back from a lovely stay in Druids Glen - spent one night only this time, everywhere is so clean and relaxing atmosphere. Pool is great, nice and warm - food options also lovely, served by a lovely man called Roy who helped us out a lot and very kind to our kids - playroom has great potential but lack of actual toys could be improved. Overall though fab stay, will be back!",5,2023,07,29
238,Fantastic and very enjoyable,"Stayed with my 2 nieces, from the moment we arrived everything was super. The room we shared was spotless, well serviced. Beautiful toiletries. All the staff were super friendly and could not do enough for us. The garden lounge food for dinner was tasty, hot and well priced. We were on a Spa package, all 3 of us had treatments and used the pool amenities before .. super clean, very high volume of staff cleaning around the hotel. Spa treatments were really good and great value. A hotel to be put on your list to visit. Although hotel was busy there were no long queues for breakfast and the breakfast buffet best I have experienced in a long time. Silver tea pots and coffee pots .. nice touch ",5,2023,07,29
238,Amazing 5 star experience.,"Our stay did not disappoint and exceeded our expectations in every aspect.
From an extremely warm welcome from Olly at the front door on arrival who  parked our jeep, took our luggage to our room and collected us from the golf club nothing was too much trouble. Thomas at breakfast, Joseph, Mark, Nicky and all waiting staff in the bar and garden room all provided an excellent service with warmth. Household staff were also excellent, and very happy to provide extra towels etc.  Nutu the hotel manager was exceptional, extremely courteous and helpful, worth his weight in gold, nothing was too much trouble for him and to us he ensured our stay was the best it could be. He’s by far one of the best 5 star managers we’ve met during our stays in Ireland and abroad. 
We were so impressed with our stay we’ve booked to return for 4 nights in the autumn. & we’re really looking forward to it. Oonagh & Harry.",5,2023,07,28
238,A wonderful family friendly hotel !,"A beautiful hotel with amazing staff and facilities. This was our first vacation as a family and it exceeded all expectations! Would definitely recommend the spa, I had a lovely treatment which made our stay even more relaxing. Food was also 10/10. Will definitely be returning ! ",5,2023,07,27
238,Perfection,"We had a lovely family weekend at Druids Glen Hotel & Golf Resort.  It rained all weekend but there was loads for us and our grandchildren to do indoors.  The staff are great and very attentive. The hotel is spotless, there were weddings there everyday but we didn't hear a sound from them. Third time staying there and we will definitely go back. ",5,2023,07,25
238,Excellent hotel and great for families,We had an excellent 4 days at Druids Glen. Such a good location with lots to do in the area and only a short drive to Dublin. Every member of staff was friendly and could not have been more helpful. Breakfast was fabulous. Kids loved the pool and walking round the lovely grounds. We will definitely be back.,5,2023,07,21
238,Wedding guest,Enjoy Druids Glen. Go back. Great place for group holiday. Easy to find. Staff very pleasant and wanting to help you so ask. Beds very comfy. Food has great variety and not ridiculously expensive. Great sense of space indoor and outside. Front porters really helpful and nice. Front desk staff lovely. Well done Druids Glen,5,2023,07,17
238,Best Wedding! ,"It's hard to put into words how unbelievable this hotel is! We got married in Druids Glen last week and it was AMAZING!! The food is incredible!! The rooms are so cosy, with the best beds! The pool, sauna, etc all brilliant and the  grounds- just breathtaking! And then the staff who are a credit to this hotel! They are an amazing team and nothing is ever too much! Big shout out to Nessa and Nicky who are just phenomenal! Our guest as well as ourselves had the most perfect day! And we can't wait to go back! Thank you Druids Glen x",5,2023,07,16
238,Great for all of the family,"The hotel is in a convenient location with easy access from Dublin. It has good facilities with a great pool. The gym is well equipped, more than you would expect for a hotel and the walks are intertwined with the golf course with very colorful landscape.",5,2023,07,13
238,Excellent Hotel,"We chose the hotel because of its locarion, and we have loved it. The surroundings are spectacular. The staff were very friendly and professional and helpded us beyond their duties. We had a Family Room and it was spacious and very clean. The facilities were also very good. We dined two days at the hotel, at The Garden Rooms and Bar and both dinners were very pleasant. Everything was excellent and we will definitely come back, ",5,2023,07,10
238,A pleasant stay,"We spent one night at Druids glen as part of a big family trip. We had 7 young children with us and the hotel was very accommodating of this. There’s a child friendly pool, games room and playroom to keep them entertained.

We had dinner in the restaurant that night which was nice however I think they could stretch beyond one vegetarian option. Desserts were a highlight. Friendly and helpful service.

I usually don’t sleep well in hotels but actually had a very peaceful night. The only issue is we were on the first floor and there is quite a bit of noise with people coming back and forth from reception and kids running up and down. If child free it might be better to stay on a higher floor?

Breakfast was good but sadly no hash browns or beans. Other offerings were nice. 

I would recommend this hotel as a family friendly experience not far from Dublin. I would describe it as 4 star, I think 5 is pushing it a small bit. ",4,2023,07,10
238,Midweek break,Want to thank the Staff from booking to leaving from the front door to reception to bar staff to cleaners down to leaving the hotel everyone was brilliant and we were greeted with a smile and help from everyone which makes a trip a lot more enjoyable. Our stay was fantastic we loved every moment.,5,2023,07,10
238,Definitely a 5 star experience,"We had our menu tasting at the hotel this week and when we decided to go for some lunch first l, without the staff having needed to know that we were there for our wedding tasting they still went above and beyond to make sure we enjoyed our experience. Katie and Roman in the garden rooms were so friendly and attentive and made sure we had all we needed.
It was Roman's first time to work a wedding menu tasting and he did an exceptional Job.
The spa manager Michelle went above and beyond by arranging a late check out so we could enjoy our treatments then go back to our room. She personally walked me to our room to make sure our key card worked.
And Nessa the wedding coordinator is am absolute dream. She made us feel so relaxed and we are so confident thst our wedding day will be amazing in Augudt. We cannot wait. ",5,2023,07,08
238,Glen golf course is amazing. Hotel is 3 to 4 stars .,"If you go to this hotel with a 3 star expectation you will be fine. 4 stars is a stretch. This is not a 5 star hotel, the Irish tourism board needs to revise their scoring and quality controls. The hotel is in a very nice location and I visited because of its signature golf course (Glen).  The hotel  is very dated, and does not meet 5 star service by a mile, may be the reason it’s no longer a Marriot… For example: 1. we arrived on a very quiet weekday with a car full of luggage and my elderly parents. Nobody at the hotel made a single attempt to help us unload the car., 2. I booked the Glen golf course and you actually have to go out on the road and drive for about 10m to get there, so I ask reception if the hotel shuttle can take me. Receptionist looks shocked and says, “let me ask the manager about that”… in a 5 stars… really? I just grabbed my clubs and drove myself in my rented car. 3. We booked a kings size bed and got two beds… 4. The shower tube was so short I could not have a shower standing up … 5. The room’s fridge was empty, nothing in it . On a positive note the breakfast is good and the Glen golf course is truly spectacular. The Heath course is not well maintained and pricy for its condition . In summary, stay here if you like golf and don’t mind average 3 to 4 star rooms and service . But do not expect what you would know as 5 star from anywhere else in the world.",2,2023,07,03
238,Excellent hotel,I stayed with my family and it was an amazing experience. The location is great and the staff and service was brilliant. We had an interconnecting room as we had two young kids and there was plenty of space. There is lots do do with the kids especially there is a playground on the premise and the pool was amazing. I will definitely be back.,5,2023,07,03
238,"Great stay, will be back!","From the minute we arrived the staff were very attentive and friendly. The restaurant was beautiful and had fantastic vegan options. Slept so well in the beds it was hard to get up! Breakfast was great and check out was at a reasonable hour. The grounds were stunning. Will definitely be back again, had a wonderful stay.",5,2023,07,01
238,Lovely place,We had a wonderful break here. So well looked after by every member of staff we met. Had great food with a good wine and a well made cocktail before bed.Thei was not our first time here and we look forward to our next visit,5,2023,06,27
238,"Marvellous service, spectacular staff, wonderful food and a beautiful hotel!","We recently celebrated 2 occasions here – our wedding ceremony in the woodlands area, followed by a sit-down dinner on May 29th and our wedding reception with 54 guests on June 24th 2023 at Druids Glen Hotel.

Both days were absolutely magical and wonderful.
The staff are brilliant, genuinely warm and make you feel like royalty. The food is exceptional and so are the wines. All our guests still talk about how amazing the food and service were, what more can I say?

Nessa, the wedding coordinator was just brilliant, and so was the entire team. A thank you to Kevin, Joey and the whole team really for making both days so very special for us and for being so very accommodating with all of our requests. You took the stress completely out of our hands, and both days flew so smoothly. It was all so much better than I ever envisioned.

We have such fond stories to tell from both days and I can't sing enough praises. All our guests have been echoing the same sentiment and it just goes to show how amazing the experience was for everyone!

A huge thank you again! Couldn't have asked for anything better!",5,2023,06,27
238,just okay,"it was just okay, the staff were very friendly and great but the service overall was not five star for sure, definitely the pool and sauna facilities were very dated - the bar for eating at night had a poor layout and didn't have great atmosphere/ambience that you would expect of a five star hotel. ",2,2023,06,26
238,Wedding Reception,"We just had the most wonderful, magical and memorable experience at the Druids Glen for our Wedding day on Friday 23rd of June. We and all of our guests were treated like royalty.
The staff were fantastic! Thank you to all, especially our brilliant Wedding coordinator from the bottom of our hearts. We will never forget this experience. Fiona and John ",5,2023,06,26
238,This is a 3 star Hotel its no way near a 5 star,"This hotel is no more than a 3-star, they must have got 5 stars when it was built a long time ago, judging by the carpets and furniture in the room, but now it's outdated and defiantly not a 5-star,
the service is only 3 stars also,
I enjoyed my time here once I realized that it was only 3 stars,",3,2023,06,25
238,"Quiet location, with a beautiful Golf Course.","Good Hotel in a quiet location.

We booked a Superior King room and were to our pleasant surprise upgraded to an Executive Suite.

Very large bedroom with a sitting room and an equally large bathroom with separate shower.
Very comfortable indeed.
Just one negative point, the hairdryer was connect to the wardrobe closet and there was no appropriate lighting or mirror. You couldn’t unplug it, since there was no socket to it.

The Garden/Bar restaurant serves fairly good food but very large portions. Service was good. 
The seating is not very satisfactory since the tables are quiet low which is ok to have a drink but not really ideal for having a meal.

 The breakfast is served in the restaurant and the choice is quiet good.

There is also a nice Terrace where you can have a drink or a meal if the weather permits.

We enjoyed our stay although it was only for one night.",4,2023,06,22
238,Druids Glen,Beautiful hotel and the staff were excellent.  Unfortunately the mattress in our room was way to soft. We ate at the Garden bar and we're very disappointed in the food. Breakfast was really good though.,4,2023,06,21
238,AMAZING,"Everything was amazing,  Could a chair and handles be put in the bathroom shower and toilet  for some rooms and cater for people with special needs?  Thank you very much.   Role on the wedding.Role on the wedding  ",5,2023,06,20
238,Lovely hotel in beautiful surroundings ,"My daughter and I stayed here last week. The hotel is lovely. The bedroom was huge with two queen beds. The bathroom had a separate shower and bath. 
Our booking was a Pigback.com deal, so we were very surprised at the beautiful room that we got.

We had dinner in the bar and it was really nice. Breakfast was a buffet, and the food was nice and hot. 

I'd definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2023,06,20
238,Expensive dining,"Just back from a one night stay in Druids Glen. Staff were pleasant and the food was nice. 
The one thing that really irked me was having to pay 5 euro extra to add potatoes to your main course. There was already a hefty supplement for steak, but having to pay extra for potatoes was a bit much. Why have prices for mains that do not include such 'extras'.
In conclusion, this is realistically a 4 star hotel with 5 star prices. Overall a one night stay cost us in excess of 500 euros....a bit much.",3,2023,06,19
238,Wonderful weekend away,"A beautiful location with wonderful staff who did everything to make our stay an awesome experience, the dining in Hogo's restaurant was excellent. The room was very comfortable and the general friendliness from all the staff and management was noticably nice and pleasant.",5,2023,06,19
238,Exceptional,"Druids glen is an absolutely wonderful hotel. This is our second time staying here. We live in Australia and last years experience was so amazing so we decided to stay again this year. 
It did not disappoint. From the moment we walked through the doors. The staff are so warm and welcoming. The facilities are exceptional. The dining in the hotel bar was wonderful. The outdoor verandah is just a peace of heaven. The breakfast was the best I’ve ever had. If you want to feel like you are totally pampered this is the only hotel that will exceed your expectations. We will be back again next year. ",5,2023,06,17
238,Golf,Played druids glen after the redesign of the golf course. What an unbelievable course. Pricey but definitely should be on every bucket list.some new fantastic holes and I’m extremely good condition. New clubhouse is fantastic aswell.  Must play,5,2023,06,16
238,Comfortable stay,Had a lovely stay in this hotel whilst attending a wedding nearby.  Room was very spacious and comfortable.  Bar area was very relaxing and staff very good.  Breakfast was very good too with plenty of choice.  Didn’t eat in the restaurant so can’t comment on those meals but did have a bar snack which was good.  A bit pricey to stay but lovely for a special occasion!,5,2023,06,13
238,Excellent experience,"Superb 1 night stay in this beautiful hotel.  Stunning hotel and the staff are so professional and friendly.  They very kindly upgraded our room which was so nice with a stunning view of the mountains.  Reckon it was the most comfortable bed I ever slept in.  We had dinner on the balcony in the bar which was really good, again excellent service.  My only issue was I paid €11.50 for a glass of Savion Blanc, which I thought was expensive, but it was very nice.  Breakfast the next morning was delicious with a great choice and again we were looked after by really good staff.  Highly recommend the walking trail around the hotel to walk off the breakfast.  Reception staff when we checked in and out were so good at their job.  Cant wait to go back.",5,2023,06,12
238,Golf & stay at the improved Druids golf course,Excellent corporate golf event & day out. Weather & course were perfect.  Hotel post golf was also improved since the last time I stayed pre covid.  Recommend & I will be back.  Food & atmosphere was very enjoyable & I thought the hotel has definitely upped its game. ,4,2023,06,12
238,5 star experience,Our visit to Druid's Glen was an absolute 5 star experience from start to finish. I can honestly say I have never been to a hotel where every single staff member without exception were some of the nicest people I have ever met. Special mention to Sandor in the bar who was wonderful and served us some of the nicest food and cocktails we've had in ages! We had gotten engaged earlier in the day and honestly it seemed like the staff were as excited as we were! We were sad leaving and will definitely be back.,5,2023,06,11
238,One night stay,"Really enjoyed our stay at Druids Glen, front desk staff were really friendly upon arrival, room was very spacious and clean, went for dinner in the bar during the evening which staff were really friendly again and food was superb, would definitely recommended a stay in druids glen and will 100% be back in the coming future…",5,2023,06,09
238,5 Star,"I stay in the sister hotel the Royal Marine Hotel alot and I am a loyalty member and always read reviews on any place I plan to visit both good and bad reviews and I make my own mind up on weather to visit or not. For a change I decided to try the Druids Glen and I have to say I don't know what some people expect with there bad reviews but from the moment we entered to the time we left I have to say we had a wonderful time. We were made feel so special.  The staff on reception were so welcoming, friendly and helpful. We arrived early and left our baggage at reception and went for lunch and  when our room was ready the staff rang us and had our bags delivered to our room. The food was delicious and well priced. I had the stake and it was cooked to perfection. My daughter had the burger and she said it was delicious. We also had a couple of different cocktails and again they were the nicest we ever had. I was expecting our evening meal and drinks to be more expensive. The waiter Roy was so friendly, professional and attentive. 

Our room was beautiful, spacious, the perfect temperature as it was sunny out and spotless. The bar staff were very helpful. The breakfast was soo good. The pouched eggs on Guinness bread were perfect. Great selection at breakfast. The staff at breakfast were very friendly and helpful. 

We also used the pool which was so comfortable and relaxing. The cleaning girl at the pool was managing the area perfectly and doing a wonderful job,she was so helpful too. Then we went for our spa treatments, well when I say Devine I mean it the girl who did the facials was an expert at her job I never felt more comfortable and relaxed my life. My daughter also had a body massage and spoke so highly of the massure that I'll book one when I return again. We wanted 5 star and we got it. Well done to all the staff that made our visit so special. We look forward to returning again soon.",5,2023,06,08
238,Excellent !,"Fantastic Service from all the staff. From the time I made the reservation to our departure from the hotel.  Everyone was so helpful.  We were celebrating a family members 80th birthday, and the restaurant staff  fell over us to make sure every one was looked after.  Food was superb, we had breakfast, lunch and dinner and we could not fault any of it.  Beautiful walk around the golf course, and an excellent leisure centre. Definitely will be back ",5,2023,06,08
238,Very very disappointing,"I've been to nicer 4 star hotels...

The room was bright and spacious but not up to 5 star scratch. It had wires hanging out of the walls and the curtains were all ripped. 

We had a lovely swim in the pool area however the changing rooms were small and crowded. 

We had booked in the restaurant for a meal which we were so looking forward to however when we arrived down we were told that the bar would have to do. I found it completely unprofessional how nothing was done what so ever to accomate us in the restaurant. It really and truly was a very poor experience for a five star hotel. 
The bar menu is also very overpriced for what it is. Our main course was also rushed out straight after our starter. However our waiter (Sandor) was kind and attentive and made our experience a little better, unlike the manager on duty. 

All in all this was a very disappointing visit and will not be keen to return or I will not be recommending to others.  

",1,2023,06,07
238,Family Friendly,Lovely clean hotel and staff are really nice. Food is lovely. Spa treatments were fabulous. Hotel is more suited to families than couples but still a lovely hotel. Surroundings are lovely if you want to get away for a nice break. ,5,2023,06,06
238,A great hotel,"If travelling by public transport get the Dart to Greystones and then a 10 minute taxi to Druids Glen. The on site walks are very good, maintained so you can walk in all weathers. Bit of a walk to Kilcoole village so your stay will be entirely on the hotel's site (if you don't have a car). Food excellent, room and bed comfortable. Plenty of sitting areas to relax and read. Extensive breakfast in a bright and cheery room. Main restaurant has a menu to suit all tastes and the bar has an informal vibe with another excellent menu. Will return..",5,2023,06,05
238,Poor for a 5star Hotel,"My husband and I stayed for 1 night as we were celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary on arrival the hotel looked great interior presentation was to a high standard the reception process was excellent and we were given our room key.

The bedroom was large great king size bed which was very comfortable and great night's sleep
The view was lovely from our room on the 3rd floor over looking the gardens.
The bathroom was a great size only down fall was there was no magnifying mirror in the bathroom.

Dinning experience was terrible neither of the menus in both restaurants had a variety of food hugos restaurant was over priced while the garden restaurant menu looked more like a lunch menu for the evening menu.
Pasta dish i ordered and I had asked for plain chicken to be added it came with the chicken on top which looked like it had been fried and then left sitting it was hard and dry I asked was there no sauce they then came with mushroom sauce which looked like and tasted like a tin of mushroom soup. It was rotten I couldn't eat it.
My husband ordered fish and he said his was tasteless but he was hungry so he had to eat it as there was nothing else on the menu.

Breakfast was in the Hugo restaurant which was big and spacious I asked for a table a bit quiter away from screaming children but the whole restaurant had screaming children everywhere I love children but there was a lot of them in 1 area.
Would of been better to section 1 part of the restaurant for family's and the other for adults only.
Was also a bit disappointed on how the breakfast was laid out any 5star hotels I have been too serve your breakfast to your table the only thing u ever needed to get was ceral fruit yougart everything else a menu was provided. 
We were given a menu but it was only if u required extra from what was already at the buffet and all the cooked breakfasts were at the buffet.
I asked fir poach eggs but told the waitress not to bring to them for at least 20mins she brought them while I Was eating my ceral. We were not told you had to order toast either.
The tea and coffee was cold within about 5 mins in the pots they used.
So breakfast was not enjoyable in the way it was laid out plus the fact u couldn't hear urself speak with so many kids.

The spa and pool area.
The pool is small and to many children in it my husband couldn't swim.
The spa experience was poor treatment beds ripped. No comfort.

A lot of changes in this hotel could make a big difference.",3,2023,06,05
238,Pat Cook,"Hotel and staff made this a very memorable holiday - we also had fantastic weather 
Would definitely use this hotel again
We originally booked just three nights but decided to stay the full week.
We did have to vacate for one night - as the hotel was fully booked but thanks to the reception staff who found us alternative accommodation for this one night it did not detract from our overall experience- thanks again to all
",5,2023,06,02
238,Disappointing! Very dated. Rude staff,Disappointing! Not a 5 star hotel at all! Rude staff. Hotel manager didn’t follow up with the email. Woken up at 6.30 am by a lawnmower 😥 breakfast cold and tasteless. You certainly won’t be treated there like in the 5 stars hotel. Safe your money and go somewhere else.,1,2023,06,01
238,Excellent minication,"The outstanding part of our stay were the staff . Well staffed hotel and everyone smiling and helpful.main restaurant closed as Monday. Room lovely . Bed v comfortable.food good. Lovely breakfast. Nice deck to sit out ,although we were initially told we couldn’t sit out due to cleaning although cleaning had been finished (minor hiccup which was solved when we questioned this )",5,2023,05,31
238,Communion,"Dear Aidan Thank you so much for a wonderful stay. My little boy made his Communion. We stayed overnight as a treat. There was such a fuss made over my little boy. He was welcomed at reception and chatted to. He was offered a special golf token,(blew his mind). For the entire stay all the staff were so friendly and welcoming and put Ronan at the centre of it all. It was so lovely as it was his big day and he really felt so important. The highlight was a card left in the room from yourself with my son's name on it and a business card if my son needed to contact the Manager for anything. My son took the card and the very important business card home with him and showed his class and teacher on Monday. Such a simple gesture but it made his weekend. My son told everyone he must be a VIP. Thank you so much. We had a really lovely time. We are looking forward to our next stay. Thank you again Rachel",5,2023,05,30
238,Bit dissapointing for a treat night,"We felt that the bar and restaurant lacked atmosphere and could have done with some background music, our food was disappointing and I sent the chicken back uneaten as it was far too dry to eat. Such a shame as we really looked forward to this night away.",3,2023,05,29
238,Unfortunately nowhere near a 5 star,"Unfortunately this hotel  is nowhere near 5 star and to say we are disappointed is an understatement. We have travelled to a lot of 5 stars hotels in Ireland but in an honest review our experience was at most 3 star. I will say our room was clean enough but slightly dated, and the shower was old and manky. We had a few issues including our child at breakfast reaching for the individual pots or Jams etc already on your table and lifting honey which had been opened and used full of crumbs!! We said to the waiter and she said sorry and never even returned with another. We had serious noise on our floor on the Saturday night, adults and children screaming for over 20minutes past 11 at night. The toilets in the hotel reception unfortunately were at times unusable, from pee spilt all around the floor of the ladies and not to mention feces on the floor. We booked directly and we were never informed that the main golf course wasn’t open during our stay or that we couldn’t eat in the clubhouse which was one of our travellers main reason to come to this hotel. We walked to the ‘second’ course and the toilets there were also a disgrace! The kids play park is not maintained at all, the flooring is a trip hazard and really unsatisfactory for this level of a hotel. We took the walk to the fairy garden and it consisted of an area where a wedding had been having used pint glasses lying on the ground for 2 days, abandoned picnic tables etc. honestly just not acceptable. Travelling as a group here and having spend a hell of alot of money we are disappointed and unfortunately not returning guests",2,2023,05,29
238,Wonderful weekend away!,"We had the most wonderful two night stay in Druids Glen Hotel celebrating a family birthday last weekend. The room was spacious and clean and very comfortable and the food was excellent. The staff at the hotel were very friendly and made sure it was a very special birthday weekend. Michelle and her team really made it a weekend to remember. Druids glen is a very special spot, a very relaxing hotel that is luxurious but also warm and welcoming to all. ",5,2023,05,29
238,Beautiful ,"Excellent,  from start to finish. Staff couldn't do enough for us. My son had a beautiful day for his communion. The games room was brilliant for the kids and they enjoyed the swimming pool. The food in Garden Rooms was nice, nothing special, I expected more if I'm honest but it did the job. The Garden rooms is uncomfortable for dining in my opinion. I don't like the level of the seats & table. Breakfast was a buffet with plenty of choice. Our room was lovely and comfortable and plenty of room for a family. Overall, I would 100% recommend and look forward to returning.",5,2023,05,28
238,Couples retreat,"We stayed here a few years ago with family for my 60th birthday, we loved it then and decided to go back again, the gardens, the walks and surrounding area are wonderful. But we definitely think the room furniture needs revamped and the seating area in the garden rooms needs recovered. Other than that it was perfect and the location was brilliant! ",4,2023,05,27
238,Superb,Had to send back my steak as it was a little under done for my taste. The waiter and waitress couldn't have been more nice and I got a fresh meal with sides included. I was so impressed. Staff were so attentive and the hotel was spotless and welcoming. ,5,2023,05,25
238,Perfect getaway,"A fine stay. With beautiful grounds a world class golf club and attentive staff everywhere. Can't say enough good things about the staff. Obviously trained to a high level but their personalities were genuine. 
A great stay. Thank you.",5,2023,05,23
238,The Garden Of Ireland,"A brief stay in an excellent hotel. The ambience, service, friendliness and accommodation were all first class. I could find no reason for complaint and will certainly return again. Many thanks to all staff for making my stay so pleasant",5,2023,05,22
238,Anniversary Stay,Excellent visit and stay in the Druids Glen Hotel location is peaceful stay so friendly and maintaining professional the interior design is fabulous food and choices plenty and the knowledge of the staff is so good.  The Butlers chocolates gift and card for our wedding anniversary was a lovely touch also the complimentary water and shortcake biscuits in the room.  The Elemis and L'occtaine products fab.  The breakfast is very good with good choices cooked to order.  Nothing was a problem.  The complimentary water bottles at check out are a really nice touch too.  We will be back and highly recommend this hotel.,5,2023,05,20
238,Best Hotel stay ever,"The service,  warmth and friendliness in this hotel is like I have experienced before.  They go way above and beyond and you feel like you are the only guests even though there are many! My family absolutely loved it, such a lovely setting too. Even had the window open at night and no sound of traffic.  Can't wait to go back!",5,2023,05,17
238,Money2Byrne Podcast Seal Of Approval ,"Druids Glen is 5 star when it comes to food, 5 star when it comes its rooms, 5 star when it comes to its service, but for its personal touch you cannot give it enough stars. 
From the moment you arrive being greeted at reception by Adrienne you will feel a Million Bucks' She sets the tone perfectly of what you expect on your stay, world class service. 
The room was fantastic, we went for a Suite, it was huge, spotlessly clean and incredibly comfortable. I  shared a video of the room on my Instagram stories and the most common response was the WOW emoji, and it is simply wow. Ive stayed in many suites around Ireland, Las Vegas, Montreal, and this room is by far my favorite. If a room with a view is what you are after you certainly can get one that rivals the very best, gorgeous rolling hills  of Wicklow is your back drop and it is simply jaw dropping. 
Money2Byrne Podcast Seal of Approval 100%. Cannot wait to come back. ",5,2023,05,16
238,"Amazing stay, great for young families","We had such a brilliant break here. The service was second to none, the staff were wonderful, so friendly and so kind to the kids. They couldn’t have done enough for us. The atmosphere in the hotel is lovely, it’s such a relaxing place to stay. The food in the restaurant was beautiful and the breakfast fabulous also. We used the driving range and putting green, this was a highlight for my husband and kids. The pool was lovely also. Overall a fantastic hotel, we can’t wait to return. ",5,2023,05,15
238,Beautiful looking just a few things off,Food isn't great at all gad lunch dinner and the breakfast all very poor . The room had a few things broke  which was annoying the temperature was very hot in the room and then freezing and controls didn't work to fix it. Hairdryer also not working when I told Reception I was told oh we will try fix them for next time ,3,2023,05,14
238,Great customer service,"Our original trip had to be cut short, due to family emergency, and Shauna was very sympathetic, and helpful, in organising our return trip, to see out our break. Great service that is gratefully appreciated!",4,2023,05,11
238,Wedding Day,"We had the most amazing wedding day in Druids Glen last year, we had a very small wedding with only 8 of us but we felt treated like royalty. All the staff really went above and beyond to make our day so special. They were so helpful in assisting my elderly grandparents so they could enjoy the day too.  The ceremony outside and the set up was gorgeous, the area inside for drinks was very relaxing, dinner was fantastic and then the area for our evening drinks when our friends arrived was perfect. The suite we stayed in was beautiful.  The biggest thank you has to go to Nessa the Wedding & Events Executive. We have since spoken to many people who have got married in Druids Glen or are planning to get married there and everyone says the same thing 'Nessa is AMAZING', clearly a wealth of experience. Thank you so much for everything. ",5,2023,05,11
238,Great hotel in a beautiful setting,"Druids Glen is a beautiful, family friendly hotel with excellent service and great food. Less than 50mins drive from Dublin in an idyllic country setting. We've been fortunate enough to stay at the hotel several times since it first opened and the service has been consistently high on every occasion. This is one of the premier hotels in Ireland. Definitely worth checking out!  ",5,2023,05,10
238,Fantastic stay,"Family stay in Wicklow . Brilliant staff and the food and service was excellent. Bar food bit too expensive for what you get but the facilities and breakfast and rooms, location make up for that. Well worth the trip ",5,2023,05,09
238,Lovely hotel,"Very well kept and clean hotel. The staff are genuine and friendly, they’re all very attentive; especially oli ( front of house) and thomas ( breakfast server) The hotel has been kept up to the same high standard over the years. ",5,2023,05,08

238,Family friendly hotel,"This hotel is lovely. Staff are attentive. It is very family friendly but as a couple with no kids we were delighted to have eaten in Higos as few kids there. Hugos menu is superb. We are big foodies from wexford who are soilt for choices of eateries so sometimes van be hard tonplease but their menu definitely is on the top of our list for recommendations. 
The bed is a cloud. So soft and big with very comfortable pillows and plenty of duvet for 2 people. 

The pool is a good size and again family friendly so be prepared for surface dives around you. 

Reception staff were so welcoming. All staff smiled and you felt like the most  important client in the hotel. 

We had cocktails in the bar before dinner which did not disappoint. Average cocktail price is €14 but they are delicious.  There was a small Hiccup with one of the cocktails. He made 2 cocktails from one making but mine got a little short changed so I just advised it looked a little shy. He apologised and made me a new one and told me the full one that the bar maid ran off with on a tray was actually my one. ",4,2023,05,02
238,One night family stay,"Lovley stay. Great set up for kids and pool is great. Bar food and experience very good. Lovely attentive staff. Breakfast experience very poor. Waiting a long time to be served and a lot of inexperienced staff so it was a chaotic experience. Possibly a once off due to bank holiday/short staff but this could be greatly improved. Overall a lovely family hotel, reasonably priced with some lovely staff. Will return.",4,2023,05,02

238,Getaway from the hustle and bustle…,"Really nice hotel. Big open lobby area. Here on business and found the staff very helpful and accommodating. The food was lovely and the views surrounding are a breath of fresh air if trying to escape the city feel. It’s a little out from everything but nothing a car won’t fix or private transfer from the hotel itself. 
The decor is very traditional so it’s not a modern interior hotel..but that’s not a criticism. Just if you prefer that style. 
The room was lovely and comfortable bed. 
Lovely for either a stay or even to go out for a dinner or a celebration. 
Would recommend. ",4,2023,04,16

Check in very good - receptionist lovely and informative - only comment would be that maybe more than 2 points required at busier periods - overheard her saying she couldn’t answer phones as well as deal with queue of people - seemed little under pressure and as paying guests, we shouldn’t have to hear this
Room lovely - clean & spacious with fab little L’occitane products - only negatives = couldn’t/wouldn’t use coffee machine as water container was filthy plus dirty towels left in room refolded despite being left in bath to be changed - had to ask twice for fresh towels
Breakfast - FAB! Selection very impressive - everything from fruit, yogurt, seeds to home baked pastries & delicious mini muffins to excellent selection of tasty hot items. Staff very good - attentive, well trained & professional
Dinner/lunch in Garden Rooms - first night was fab - great service and tasty food - second night slightly marred by poor behaviour from maitre d’ - foreign female who practically chased us through the dining room rudely demanding if we had a reservation, demanding our room number etc despite being seated seconds earlier by the waiter?? Had to move tables at her insistance to a dirty, uncleared table?? Embarrassing & unnecessary - other staff however very friendly & professional
Spa - overall very good however a glass of Prosecco booked & paid for on arrival yet had to leave Relaxation Area to find staff member to provide
Overall for the price paid, very good
However still small ‘hitches’ that should not have occurred in a 5 star property - for the rates charged, everything should be perfect",4,2023,04,11
238,Memories last a life time at Druid's Glen!,"Family and friends had such a memorable stay at Druid's Glen for a Birthday Dinner celebration.
Exceptional experience, friendly professional staff, excellent food served to the highest standards.
Highly Recommended.

238,Nice stay,A nice stay. Some things could be improved upon for a 5 star hotel. But overall a very enjoyable stay. It’s a peaceful setting with idyllic views. Handy location and easily accessible. A little overpriced. ,4,2023,04,10
238,Perfect family break,We had the most enjoyable time at Druids Glen. Highly recommend to anyone wanting that perfect family break. The entire staff were very friendly and most helpful. The food was excellent. The beds were so comfortable. Really enjoyed our stay and will most definitely return. ,5,2023,04,09
238,Beautiful resort will definitely be back! ,"
Such a relaxing setting, a great escape to destress. Beautiful lobby area with lots of comfy seating to chat and catch up with friends.
We ate in the bar, while the staff and surroundings were lovely, wasn't overly impressed with the menu, for a coeliac there was only one dish choice, cauliflower curry. While it was very tasty it would have been nice to have an alternative choice available. When we went back to room the bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in! The bedroom was spacious & luxurious as was the ensuite, with lovely Elemis toiletries 👌
The pool area was lovely from the lovely warm pool itself to the ice cold plunge pool. 
Breakfast was delicious again however the coeliac breakfast arrived well after everyone else was finished, really if that was addressed it would be perfection.",5,2023,04,08
238,Family Birthday,Excellent meal in Hugos restaurant. Service and friendliness perfect. Atmosphere relaxed .Highly recommend. Plenty comfortable seating areas for relaxing. Breakfast had amazing selection and was delicious ,5,2023,04,08

238,1 Night Getaway,"Overpriced for a standard stay. Poor meal in the Garden rooms, again overpriced & cold. Leisure centre not relaxing, children running in & out of sauna & steam room constantly. Staff are very friendly & attentive, hotel was very clean. ",2,2023,04,03
238,Relaxing golf experience,Great place to stay for relaxing golf escape from family 😄 Staff incredibly friendly and attentive. Top class hotel. Food and drinks were amazing quality. Service was the best I've experienced in a hotel. Would definitely go back. Thank you. ,5,2023,04,02
238,Exceptional hotel,"Wow just wow, we had another hotel booked but when we arrived we were not happy, this was my second stay here and the staff  couldn't do enough for you, the kids loved the pool and there was even a little white robe and slippers for my 5 year old, we ate in the bar which was fine, the menu wasn't too big and not much to choose from, this would be my only criticism but you do have the choice of the big restaurant.   The bar area was so comfortable  and looking out at beautiful views, there was live music which was brilliant. The rooms are fabulous and the neds are so comfortable,  this has to be my favourite hotel and run so well.",5,2023,04,02
238,Such a lovely hotel,"We really enjoyed our stay here. The staff, food and room was amazing.

We didn't get a chance to use the spa as it was fully booked but we would definitely come back and book in for a spa the next time. Can't recommend enough overall a lovely hotel. ",5,2023,04,01

238,"Friendly and professional team, delicious food and lovely pool","Friendly professional team. Delicious beautifully presented food in Hugo’s. Clean and well equipped rooms. Hotel is very child friendly while being discreet.  Pool was perfect temperature for young family, great size and clean. Robes and towels for adults and children provided and were very soft!

238,Good experience overall,"Excellent attention and service in bar / dining  area , a very welcoming experience . We look forward to returning to Druids Glen in the not to distant future in what would be better weather to enjoy the surrounding grounds and walks.",5,2023,03,29
238,Great Family Hotel,"Just back home a lovely 2 night stay with young family! The hotel is lovely & relaxing , great for children! The staff were exceptionally pleasant towards us & our little boy! We really enjoyed the pool & the playrooms! We did dine in the bar 4 times & did find the menu repetitive, but over all definitely will be back again! Great choice for breakfast & lovely setting!",4,2023,03,24
238,"Food excellent, comfortable bed but not 5 star","We got a really good deal and couldn’t believe our luck at the price for a 5 star hotel. However we were baffled that this is a 5 star hotel so the price probably matched the experience. Can’t fault the food, we really enjoyed our meal but everything else was average. 
The pool area was akin to a public swimming pool. Broken jacuzzi, damaged seats in the sauna and no lanes to swim in as they were being used for children’s swimming lessons. Something seaweed like floating in the pool also. 
Room was a good size but very dated. Bed was very comfy. Would have expected conditioner in the bathroom but unfortunately there was none. Bottle of bleach was left at the sink which seemed odd. 
Breakfast selection was great. There weren’t any staff around to seat us when we came in so didn’t get the menu we saw on some tables but there was plenty in the buffet. 
I’d recommend the hotel to families as there appeared to be lots for children and many families were there. Kids playing football in the corridors, etc. 
If you’re hoping for a bit of luxury in a 5 star hotel I’d look elsewhere.",3,2023,03,22
238,Excellent Stay !!,"Five star stay at the Druids Glen with my husband and two children. What makes this hotel stand out from the rest is the staff . The nicest , friendliest and most efficient service everywhere you go  . We ate in the bar both nights and the food was really good. Pool area is great and easily accessible from the bedrooms . Lovely robes and slippers for all guests in the rooms. The hotel itself has a really relaxing atmosphere with so much space and lots of places to chill. Looking forward to coming back . ",5,2023,03,20
238,Still our favourite,"We have reviewed Druid’s Glen before, and we will review it again, because we intend to be back again before too long.  The location is ideal, just 30 mins from Dublin by car, yet nestled in amazing countryside far away from the world….  The food remains exceptional.  You know it is a special hotel when you return and find the staff haven’t changed, and they remember you.  Yes, we will admit a little bias, this is our favourite hotel in Ireland, but we keep coming back for a good reason.  Druid’s Glen is that good.  A special mention for Shauna in the Reservations team, and Padraig (Concierge) who looked after us impeccably.  We will be back soon, and to be honest, I think that is the highest recommendation any guest can make. ",5,2023,03,19
238,2 night stay,Really lovely stay for my husband's birthday. Delicious meal in Hugos restaurant and live music in the bar on Paddys night. Excellent service and the pool area was spotless. Super breakfasts and attentive staff,5,2023,03,18
238,A Sunday stay,Lovely hotel but walks were closed and bed was quiet uncomfortable. Staff were too helpful when it came to asking for drinks and additional courses. Jacuzzi was not working. Very warm and clean public areas and generally staff were very helpful. Don’t ask for board games and chess has only 3 pieces of one side ,3,2023,03,17
238,Beautiful and brilliant,I’m always amazed when I stay here at the level of customer care and attention to detail at Druids Glen. A lot of hotels could learn a thing or two from them. Kevin on reception was brilliant as where all the staff. Thank you for the use of the business suite for the day it really helped me out.,5,2023,03,16
238,Worth trying and good value.,"Stayed here recently mid week. 
From arrival staff were fabulous, friendly and helpful. Rooms are large and great. Food v. good and lots of little touches to make you feel welcome. Would recommend to anyone looking for an easy getaway within easy reach of Dublin.",5,2023,03,14
238,Great Hotel,"Staff were professional, very pleasant and friendly, helpful and welcoming. Especially Kevin on Reception. Food was a very high standard and every area was spotlessly clean. We dined in our room and it was great.   ",5,2023,03,14
238,One night stay,"Really enjoyed our night away, it was just myself and my wife, we arrived early and the staff got our room ready straight away, nice hot hand towels and a very welcoming feeling, had lunch and dinner which were both really good quality, room was perfect and the grounds are stunning.. Well done Druids 😊",5,2023,03,13
238,Wonderful relaxing stay,"My husband, 2 year old and I just returned from a stay in Druid’s Glen. We were just one night away but even just that short time has left us feeling so relaxed. Our 2 year old loved the pool (and so did we). The room was large and luxurious and the breakfast was also a particular hit! Can’t wait to come back again.",5,2023,03,12
238,Druids Glen Resort,A fantastic stay in an incredible setting. The service provided was 10/10. The staff couldnt do enough for me and my team. Druids is top class and all involved enjoyed our time on course and at the hotel immensely.,5,2023,03,10
238,Middle week break,"My partner and I went for short break in Druids Glen. The hotel is located in an amazing spot, restaurant and bar has an amazing cuisine. Afternoon it is so nice. Bedroom it’s lovely. Staff are verywelcooming and friendly. It was our first time there , we highly recommend it. We would like to thank you all for this great experience and thank very much to Vernoon , he made our stay even better. We went to celebrate our engagement and druids glen made it very special.",5,2023,03,10
238,Perfect,"A perfect stay in a beautiful hotel with exceptional staff. Warm, friendly and comfortable throughout. Delicious dinner too!! It was my second stay and I'll be back. We also played golf and were welcomed back to reception with warm hand towels which was a lovely touch. ",5,2023,03,10
238,Super relaxing and very family friendly,"Despite having lived nearby for most  of my life, I had never visited the hotel before bringing my wife and kids last week. 
Bar food was excellent - standard dishes but with a creative twist - sandwiches served open face with fresh herbs and guac, for example. Breakfast was even better with a substantial buffet and fresh coffee as well as waffles etc made to order.

our room was comfortable for two kids -
two exceptionally comfortable double beds and a cot on request. 

The leisure centre was lovely - kids had a ball and we got some time to ourselves too. 

What really made it though was the quality of service- super friendly and laid back. I was *very* casually dressed and this was no problem; and the kids were always well looked after. There’s a room for hearing bottles etc which is great even if we didn’t need it.

We’ll definitely be back.",5,2023,03,04
238,Loved it,"First time to Druids Glen. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in this fabulous hotel. We were greeted by a lovely gent Lee at reception, who was so accommodating to us and explained the layout of the hotel very well.
We had a delicious afternoon tea in Hugo's, which in my opinion was one of the best I've had to date. The facilities were great my mum enjoyed a lovely relaxing massage in the spa. 
The rooms were spacious and the beds very comfortable, with stunning views of the grounds.
I would highly recommend this hotel. Look forward to returning.

238,Magical!,"There is something about this venue that is very special.  Besides the wonderful staff, luxurious surroundings, incredibly comfortable beds and fine dining - Druid's Glen has that little bit of magic - you definitely feel particularly relaxed - the atmosphere around the hotel is one of calm, peace and luxury!  Very easy to unwind here!",5,2023,02,25
238,enjoyed!,"Wonderful staff in all areas!!!  We were given a great upgrade after issues in our original room.
Good food and ocean view at a distance. The building is tired and needs some TLC on carpets, cushions, woodwork and tiles. Convenient location for Glendalough plus Powerscourt, both garden and waterfall.",5,2023,02,24
238,Highly recommended,"Stayed here as a couple years ago, and last weekend. Exceptional service especially as other hotels I’ve stayed in are struggling for good staff. Food, service and rooms exceptional. Would highly recommend it and it’s only 50mins from dublin.",5,2023,02,22
238,Fabulous Stay,"We really enjoyed our stay. It was a friends catch up staycation & we enjoyed the atmosphere, the facilities, the friendly staff and the food !!! We were a little disappointed not to get spa treatments even though we rang a month in advance. We had a great time. ",5,2023,02,20
238,It’s worth trying,Had never been here before and decided to try it. The room we stayed in was nice and had a nice view. The food was good and presented well. The menu was very limited. It’s set in a great location. Would not consider it to be a 5 star hotel in my opinion it’s more of a 4 star hotel. Would probably go back again.,4,2023,02,19
238,Family Stay,"We had a 2 day break with our 3 kids, really enjoyed everything about this hotel, food, service, pool , gym and rooms are well maintained, really recommend a stay here and we will be back, well worth a visit, thanks",5,2023,02,17
238,Service issues,"3 day family stay, hotel, pool and rooms are really nice.
Food below par especially in Hugo's restaurant.
Service was the main let down, I know it's hard to get staff but the ones they have need training. The mature staff do the best they can.
Breakfast, best walk into the breakfast area don't stand at the entrance desk- no one's coming.
The staff do not clear anything from your table during breakfast so it gets messy with a family. You may get your tea and toast as you are finishing.
Bar, waited 45min for mains and another 30 for sweets. No one to clear plates or take drink orders, had to wait at bar to pay in the end.
Hugos, not 5 star.  You expect silver service in a good restaurant, here you pay top price but they don't top up your wine, ask if it was ok etc, poor training. Also family's eating here with crying kids, not the romantic meal you would like.
You can order drinks in the very comfortable foyer area, but again 45 min wait and no one clearing tables. Kids liked this area as there were games to play, but not much room with glasses left for hours.
It does look like students were drafted in for half term to help serve, but you need to supervise and train them. 

Altogether, nice place but poor attention to client.",3,2023,02,16
238,Food is below par of what you would expect when paying 300 euro a night.,"If you’re paying 300 euro a night for a 5 star hotel you expect the price of the food to be high, but you also expect the standard of the food to be high. The food wasn’t great in the bar of the room service food was even worse, I cannot fault the staff, lovely people. But the food really really let the place down ",3,2023,02,14
238,Druids glen stay,"Wonderful experience in Druids Glen hotel, swift check in experience, lovely bedroom, food and service in Hugos was fantastic, drinks and lunch in the Garden Rooms and Bar which were lovely also. A very enjoyable stay with fantastic staff and facilities.",5,2023,02,13
238,A place in my Heart,"We have just returned from a wonderful stay at Druids Glen , the Hotel is tranquil & beautiful. The views of the gardens & Sugar Loaf from our room were like a picture postcard.. Excellent facilities & exceptional staff, nothing is too much trouble. We very much look forward to our return visit in April.",5,2023,02,13
238,"Lovely place , food and service ",Lee at the desk was very helpful. The whole hotel was terrific. John at the bar was ever so helpful. The rooms were plush and lovely and all the staff seemed trained in customer service . Very chilled and relaxed would definitely go again. 10 out if 10 great to see .,5,2023,02,10
238,almost perfect but ....,"almost perfect !  
We can not find faults during our stay at this beautiful hotel, the Gruid's Glen. I am confident that it is always mentioned by others, the staff here are one of their greatest assets.  Very welcoming and attentive.  Our  rooms and common areas are beautifully presented and spotlessly clean.   With the fireplaces lit and the comfortable seats, the lounge reveals it elegance especially  at night,  it is a perfect quiet place for a chat and a glass of wine.  Hugo's Restaurant did exceptionally well.  It now belong to one of our top 3 favorites. The  starters, mains and desserts were beautifully presented like artworks , constructed with flair, masterfully cooked with different flavors and textures.  Portion is decent too.   Waiters and waitresses are warm and genuinely friendly.  The next day,  the chefs made a very impressive selection of morning breakfast buffet. From cereal, juices, toast, tea & coffee,  cold cut meats and cheese, fresh fruits, assorted pastries, hot food counter with sausages, rashers, eggs, mushrooms, black pudding, pancakes and syrup and lots of other things, you will be spoilt for choices.  One may also order freshly cooked items from the menu if you prefer.  The morning floor staff deserves to be complimented too.  After a sumptuous breakfast meal, my wife and I did the walking trail around the hotel.  It  is highly recommended in order to appreciate the beauty and tranquil  of the natural surroundings it has to offer.   It was an enjoyable overnight stay to remember.  My only wish on our next visit is to consider some of the seats and tables at the restaurant and the breakfast area to be more distant from the others.  Thank you once again for the great experience.  ",5,2023,02,09
238,GREAT FAMILY HOTEL WITH SUPER STAFF !!,"We had a lovely 2 days at the hotel over the long weekend. Great value with wonderful staff.. Infact they are what make it the hotel it is. Very attentive !!!
Nothing is a problem and they will all try get you anything you ask for.
I hope the owners appreciate that !!!

Rooms are lovely, food is excellent, great pool for the children too. And a great spa to relax in ..

238,I don’t think I will return,"I was a little disappointed on arrival at the hotel. It did not have that 5 star experience that I expected. It felt like a normal hotel greeting. The bed room was lovely.
However, when we went for a drink in the bar the service was slow and very little attention given to the residents The restaurant changed everything. The service was excellent and the food was lovely",4,2023,02,06
238,Nice place to stay for weekend,"Very nice hotel, perhaps a little bit on the expensive side. Good facilities. Had dinner in restaurant the first night, it was oka6 but expensive, the second night we ate in the bar, much better menu and reasonabl6 priced.",4,2023,02,06
238,Class,"The whole staff was so friendly and helpful, amazing service. It was warm and really child friendly. Breakfast buffet was unreal and the rooms are ideal. Ollie was especially helpful and kind. We really enjoyed our stay, thanks a mill. ",5,2023,02,05
238,Bad Value for food and drinks €7:50 for a pint your having a laugh 😒,"RIP OFF IRELAND AT ITS BEST 
can you explain why a pint of beer is €7.50 and a glass of wine is €9:10 

Staff are the hotels best asset x 
Decor ok 
Rooms were nice and clean but the lights in the rooms were not easy 
Some had switches some you had to turn on and off from the sockets 
Think a manager should spend a night in the hotel room to see the pros and cons for guests 

Four of us had dinner and two beers each  and the bill was €237 , food was ok for 3 of us but my steak was over cooked and looked more like rasher I should have complained but when your out in company you don’t want to be the difficult one 🤔
Chef should not have have sent it out .
Service at dinner was lovely a girl called Laura looked after us

Breakfast was nice, ordered fresh omelettes and lovely Americano ☕️ they could not do enough for us . 
Raging I didn’t get the gentleman’s name that seated us and made us feel so welcome and he had some funny one liners 

Don’t think I would be back though as felt it was bad value for food and drink

A beautiful hotel with stunning surroundings all added to the excellent service we received throughout. 
A big callout to Laura who really went above and beyond to make our little one feel special and sang happy birthday to her!
Along with the beautiful food, you just couldn't ask for a warmer, more welcoming hotel.
Thank you all so much

238,Wonderfully relaxing!,"We had a wonderful night away in the druids glen and couldn't be more relaxed checking out! The pool and gym facilities are great and the spa treatment was luxurious! 
We were upgraded on arrival to a superior room which we were delighted with, very comfy bed, well appointed bathroom with loccitaine shower gel and shampoo provided, and last but not least the views were lovely! 
We had some pre dinner drinks in the bar and the staff were so friendly and the cocktails delicious!
We then enjoyed a meal in Hugo's restaurant which was high quality and generous! We struggled to finish dessert! Breakfast the next morning was very tasty and plenty of options.
Overall the staff  were all fantastic from check in to check out, professional but friendly! Would definitely recommend 😁",5,2023,01,28
238,Excellent relaxed stay,Great short stay at Druids Glen Hotel - really relaxing and excellent facilities. V good breakfast and food generally good. However my wife had a lamb madras in the Garden Rooms on our first night which was seriously under-spiced!!,5,2023,01,26
238,Yet another fantastic stay at Druids Glen,"Five star experience all around, attention to detail and staff always going above and beyond to make the stay even more enjoyable. The facilities are well maintained and there is always a very relaxing environment around the hotel.",5,2023,01,24
238,A 5 star holiday experience.,"Had our weekend holiday break  in Druids  Glen with the whole family. This is actually my second time to stay in this hotel and as I remembered I really loved it. To start with, the rooms were nicely decorated, the bed was very comfy and they put our rooms adjacent with each other. We had a great time, the breakfast were amazing, each morning loads of choices. You can order from the menu or go with there buffet. The pool is also a highlight for us, it is a family friendly pool. There were times specific for adults and for family to use the pool. Then, for dinners you have two options in the bar or in the restaurant. The ambiance is very cozy and to mention the staff were fantastic, there costumer service is a 5 star indeed. They were very attentive and very welcoming. On our last night  the manager in the bar approach us and ask if were celebrating something special, which we are. Then he came back and give as 3 boxes of Butlers chicolates, which we think a very nice gesture.♥️ There was also a live music that night that we loved. Overall experience was fabulous,  we really enjoyed and will definitely go back again.  I highly recommend this hotel. Thank you Druids Glen for making our stay extra special.🥰",5,2023,01,24
238,A Brilliant Family Hotel,"This is our 4th time to visit Druids Glen as a family and we will be back again. It is the favorite hotel of our oldest son Shay who has autism. It was Shay's birthday in January so we decided to make the trip again. He was really excited and had been looking forward to the large DVD Collection they have and in particular 1 DVD. We had emailed ahead to ask could this DVD be kept aside for our check in but unfortunately it could not be found. However after what we believe was a detailed search and rescue mission the DVD was located and it made for a great start to our weekend and a very happy boy. 
This type of going above and beyond mentality seems to be the Druids Glen MO and we experienced this through out our stay including during dinner when we were accommodated with increasing our booking from 4 people to 8 people when we met up with friends. 
All the staff greet you with a smile and you always feel welcome. ",5,2023,01,23
238,Family friendly luxury hotel,We had a lovely stay and never felt that having a 2-year old running around was a problem - it was lovely to see so many other families there as well. Highly recommend our stay and will come back again.,5,2023,01,23
238,Nice Hotel but food overpriced,"Myself and my husband stayed here this weekend. Lovely hotel staff friendly rooms big and comfy, but food overpriced . Restaurant very expensive for what you get, bar food not great quite disappointing and service was slow. If you are willing to splash out on high restaurant prices I would recommend Chakra a fabulous Indian restaurant in Greystones only a 15 minute car drive from the hotel.   If you are looking for good food reasonably priced I would recommend Burnaby Pub and restaurant.  It was buzzing. Delicious pub grub I had sea bass  it was amazing.  ",3,2023,01,22
238,Service appalling and staff dismissive,"I came here with my husband for the night and had booked into the restaurant that evening.

On arrival at 8:30pm, they couldn’t find our reservation although it was confirmed upon check in. After waiting for some time we were escorted to our table.

The service was appalling and I’m more annoyed at myself for not walking out . We received our starters after 30 minutes of waiting.  It wasn’t what we ordered but we were so hungry we ate it. It turned out the couple next to us got our food and we got theirs…Our mains came at 10:25.  Every time I tried to get a waiters attention they kept apologising but not stopping . 

This morning upon check out I tried to explain to the young man how upset we were and he was completely dismissive and responded “ye ye, we’ll look into it.”

Needless to say we will not be returning nor recommending this rudely staffed hotel to anyone .",1,2023,01,22
238,Family Birthday weekend.,"The experience of staying in the Druids Glen Hotel was excellent from the time we arrived to the time we departed. The rooms and the food and the staff were all first class.

238,Fantastic stay,Staff were very friendly and helpful through the stay. Room was lovely and the facilities in the hotel were exceptional. Food was really nice and the service from the bar staff was above and beyond which is fantastic to have ,4,2023,01,17
238,Terrible dining experience,"I hate to leave bad reviews but I feel I have to give honest feedback after my stay. We dined in the Garden restaurant and it was a shockingly bad experience. We were a group of 4 people and 3 of our mains had problems (including a raw, pink chicken which had to be sent back). The attitude of the manager was defensive and not what I would expect. The other staff (waiting staff and bar staff) were very friendly but clearly most of them were relatively new and inexperienced which led to service which wasn't to a very high standard. I hope this improves with time. The overall problem seems to be bad management. The rooms are very big and very comfortable but unfortunately I could never return here or recommend this hotel. ",2,2023,01,14
238,Underwhelming ,"Overall a disappointing stay.. said I would treat myself and my girlfriend to valentines weekend in this hotel. It was all very basic! The decor in the hotel and rooms was again basic.. the food was disappointing given the price and reputation of the hotel.. I will say the leisure facilities and staff were amazing and made our trip.. I think the hotel probably gets its reputation through its status in the golfing community, so unless you have a keen interest in golf I would avoid it.",3,2023,01,14

238,Disappointed with the New Year's Package,"Lovely hotel, spacious rooms and the majority of the staff are so helpful and  cheerful and welcoming.  Unfortunately some needed lessons from the majority. 
Arrived New years eve for a 2 night stay.  Our package included breakfast both mornings and 1 evening meal . There was a fireworks display New years eve evening but that's were the celebrations ended. Evening dinner followed and from there went to get a table in the lounge thinking a gala celebration would happen.  Nope. No sign of any band setup or dj . Went to reception and asked if there was any entertainment,  to which there seemed to be some confusion if there was or not. A musician did arrive some time later, and did a countdown at midnight   , but it could of been any other night . Nothing on the tables for guests  , no party packs , and after paying 920 euros  a voucher for a cocktail would of been nice. There was a glass of fizz at dinner but that was it. 
Breakfast on New year's day   , we waited to be seated , or even greeted by anyone.  We waited   , and waited. Eventually a waitress passed by and said she would get someone.  Last we seen of her.  A guest who was seated and eating his breakfast noticed us , got up and went off to get us some assistance.  And only for him we would be still stood there. There is even a notice for guests to wait to be seated. Surely not that long. 
Health Centre  , there was a guy working  and i think he also does life guard at the pool. He needs to learn how to be greeting to guests . 
On the plus side, rooms Lovely   , hotel in beautiful settings. Food beautiful   , and most of the staff are fabulous.  So welcoming and helpful.  The young Ukrainian lady who served us dinner on new years eve  her smile and manner was so uplifting and Especially Sandor, a true gentleman. 
Overall very disappointing new years package.  2 breakfasts and one dinner.  No party atmosphere on the last day of the year a massive let down",3,2023,01,02
238,Wedding Stay,"Lovley Hotel, staff are exceptional so welcoming. Rooms are spacious and clean. Really good atmosphere in the Hotel, lobby area is so comfortable brilliant hotel we will definitely return. Breakfast was great plenty of options. The staff and their professionalism made a huge impression on all the guests. ",5,2023,01,02
238,Very pleasant O/N stay,"Lovely hotel and location, Staff very welcoming and friendly.
Room was lovely -comfortable and very clean
Dinner was very good and Breakfast was excellent.
The leisure facilities were good though needing updating.
Overall had a very pleasant stay",4,2022,12,29
238,Great hotel & Location,"A great hotel with superb amenities in a fantastic location. Our suite in the hotel was comfortable warm and cosy. We were greeted by staff on the walk from the car park, to the hotel lobby this set the standard for the rest of our stay. Every staff member was warm and friendly and very helpful. Dinner in Hugo’s was outstanding. Great food perfect service and friendly and knowledgeable staff.",5,2022,12,29
238,Fabulous hotel bad service,"Previously 5star all round, now a lovely property with terrible customer service. 
Food very good, rooms very nice, pool needs to be more family friendly as is a family hotel. 
Attention to detail needed asap! ",2,2022,12,28
238,Nice hotel-upscale and relaxing,"We stayed here for one night. 

The staff was very friendly and professional and eager to when needed.  

Laura in the Garden Room and bar was a delight. She was very friendly, and professional.   Her upbeat bubbly personality made our dining experience relaxing and pleasant. She is an asset to your hotel

The Druids Glen hotel is a nice hotel. Our room was inviting and the bed was very comfortable.  The surrounding area is outside of town so you have a nice view of the glen. 

We only ate here for lunch and dinner.

There are a lot of amenities on site.  This is a golf resort. 
 
Parking is available on site.",4,2022,12,24
238,Unfortunate,We were disappointed as a coupled. After paying to come away from a night the price of alcohol and food was outrageous especially for the standard. Tbe jacuzzi was broke. The only really good thing was the breakfast ,3,2022,12,24
238,Family Christmas treat,"A lovely place to visit for a Christmas family time get together , the pool family time was great  with the little ones having cute bathrobes & slipper to wear to the pool & the kids playroom was a great size with lots of things to entertain children of various ages ",5,2022,12,20
238,50th. Wedding anniversary treat.,"What a fabulous hotel. We stayed for 1 night as a family group of 12,with childrens ages from 7 to 21 and their parents and we all had a wonderful time. We could not find 1 fault with the whole stay. The staff, the service, the rooms, the food and the pool were all excellent.
We'll  be back.",5,2022,12,20
238,Wonderful hotel and exceptional staff,"Superb location, beautiful grounds and very relaxing. Dining options were great and our evening meal on both nights just divine.  Facilities are really good Each and every member of staff was so friendly, welcoming and professional. Treat yourself, you won’t regret it.",5,2022,12,18
238,Afternoon Tea & Spa,"Druids Glen Afternoon Tea & Spa. 
 Our expectations were sadly not fulfilled. I invited  my pregnant daughter and her friend for an afternoon tea experience and it was not great. The service was very very slow and lacking. The sandwiches arrived out fairly stuffed together on small plates and some of the bread was tasting stale! 
We had then to ask for the tray of cakes which looked full of e-colours when they arrived. At €42pp it was very disapointing. Would not be rushing back as even the front of house staff were not friendly and helpful when we were then trying to locate the Spa!!  The Spa was lovely but the changing area is actually the basin area to the loo with some lockers behind the door!! The treatments are the same price as the Powercourt Hotel, but their changing areas are again lacking thought for the ladies attending. Our therapists were very good however. 
Altogether not a memorable and rather expensive afternoon. 
",3,2022,12,16
238,"Beautiful hotel, but lacking the 5 star standard ","Positives: Beautiful hotel, Staff very friendly, very comfortable beds 
Negatives: no shower gel in the bathroom, just a shampoo and two body lotions which isn’t ideal, no breakfast room service card provided in the room, mess up with the breakfast order, food pretty tasteless. Other people in our party paid the same for their room but got a much nicer room with coffee machine and view etc, which we didn’t get. Both rooms were booked at the same time. We just looked onto other peoples windows. First world problems I know, but for a five star hotel, you expect more. ",3,2022,12,16
238,Unbelievable Experience,"Highly recommended, from the moment you walk in the service is fantastic. Food was beautiful. Couldn't ask for more. Lee on reception and Thomaz in the restaurant are a credit to your hotel. Will definitely return soon
",5,2022,12,10
238,Beautiful location,Loads of room in the public space area so excellent for families.  Pool small for the number of people with children who could potentially use it.  Hat policy in pool wasn't clear until we got there.  Lots of water puddles at pool so potential to slip greatly increased. ,4,2022,12,06
238,Festive Stay with friends and family,"A really warm welcome to kick off the festive period from the team at Druids Glen. A super hotel to bring your family to, with a games room for kids ideally located so parents can enjoy a relaxed drink in the lobby or bar. Kids catered for from start to finish and we never felt like an inconvenience in our group of 6 adults and 7 children. Mark in the bar looked after us all so well and really made our time so relaxed and enjoyable making a special fuss of all the children with his friendly and warm disposition. Lovely night away to kick off the festive fun!",4,2022,12,05
238,Just what we needed,Went to druids glen to relax and unwind and that's exactly what we did. Beautiful hotel lovely staff and very comfortable bed. Overall it was an Excellent stay couldn't of been more relaxed really didn't want to go home ,5,2022,11,29
238,Good stay,"Good stay, the location is great, and the room was clean and quiet, we were there on a Thursday, so not so busy which is great to use the facilities as the swimming pool/sauna, with no rush. I'd say there are some opportunities for improvement for breakfast for people with food allergies (I've booked a gluten-free breakfast) and there were very few options. ",4,2022,11,29
238,Family Xmas get -together,"Just back from a weekend break at Druids Glen with my husband , 3 children and their partners and my 2 grandchildren. A fantastic family friendly location beautifully decorated for Xmas. Everything was just what we needed from the comfortable rooms, food and bar services. Great pool facilities and a great toy room for the children. Staff were soo friendly at all times. Would definitely recommend this hotel for a break away. 
",5,2022,11,28
238,Excellent hotel,Druids Glen totally exceeded my expectations. Beautiful hotel. Excellent staff. Special mention for the Bar Manager ( ? Shane). He was very efficient and extremely friendly and lovely to everyone. Food in the bar was delicious. Great breakfast. Would recommend. ,5,2022,11,25
238,Called to tell us Hotel is closing for a week,"Hi,  this review is not about an actual stay in Druid's Glen but really about a non-stay. 

Made reservations for a stay in early January for a significant birthday as part of a family group with people travelling internationally to attend.  Got a call today with c6 weeks notice to say that the hotel is actually closing for that week and they are cancelling all bookings.  Person on phone was very pleasant but offered no real reason for the cancellation.  I can understand  cancellations if something comes up at short notice that is outside the control of the organisation (like the electricity goes as an example) but this is not that type of instance.  

We now have to completely re-organise.

Avoid this Hotel if you actually need to be assured that it will be open when you need it to be.",1,2022,11,24
238,Break,"Nice Stay and good place to chill. If you just want to relax and go no where on a break , I would highly recommend Druids . It has everything you require to make sure you have a nice break . Less than hour from the airport too ",4,2022,11,22
238,Lovely hotel but cold and shocking food,Lovely hotel and rooms but so let down by quality of food. I have been many times before and have loved it but I would be very slow to return as no where else around to eat. Food was shockingly poor both for breakfast and in Hugo’s restaurant. Presentation fabulous but taste and quality beyond poor. Such a pity they can’t get this right as this was our second visit that like this.,2,2022,11,22
238,A very different Druids Glen,"There's something missing now in Druids Glen, having been married there and staying regularly, staff changes and cost saving have made the hotel lose its sense of self. Likely won't return again, barring to mark our anniversay as we were married in Druids Glen. 
Stained ceiling tiles in the business centre, rubbish in the gardens, zero staff familiarity with returning guests, even breakfast seems to have suffered to cost saving measures. A real shame the soul is now gone from what was our favourite hotel! ",2,2022,11,22
238,Family weekend break,"Great service, very family friendly place. We will be definitely coming back. Nice, modern hotel room. Kids enjoyed the playroom on the ground floor and also the time they got to spend in the swimming pool. ",5,2022,11,21
238,Fantastic resort,"5 star weekend. Rooms were out of this world. Very clean and tidy and all staff were fantastic. 
From the moment we arrived until we left the service was top class. All staff friendly and smiling and any questions or assistance they could give they were more than happy to help. Would highly recommend
",5,2022,11,21
238,A great short family stay ,"We spent two nights here as part of a week long trip in Ireland, travelling as a family of 4 (two children age 5 and under). 

The hotel was just wonderful, the staff were friendly, great with the children, and were attentive to their needs as much as ours.  
I loved the decor; everything felt cozy and welcoming, especially with it getting cooler outside. 

Our (family) room was perfect; comfortable for all of us.  My eldest son was particularly excited by his own robe and toiletries.   

We were located on the same floor as the spa /swimming pool, and made use of it a couple of times.   We had no issues with it being too busy, or not being available when we wanted to use it, and the whole family had a fun splash about. 

We dined in the garden area; the evening meals were delicious, and we felt reasonably priced.  Even our little one ate more than I’ve ever seen him eat, so it must have been good.  I was also particularly grateful for my meal being remade after I was delayed to feed my son.  
Breakfast was delicious too; plenty of choice for everyone, and it was all of good quality.

We hope to return in the future. ",5,2022,11,20
238,Great family break,We have come here a few times with the kids. Always a great family oriented hotel. The playroom by the lobby is great for kids. The room was lovely & comfortable for the 4 of us. The food at the bar was really nice & staff are always very friendly and make a great effort with the residents.,5,2022,11,19
238,Another great stay in this superb resort,"We love Druids Glen hotel and both golf courses. Too long since we were last there. Food superb, staff very friendly and helpful, and the facilities are top class. One of us was sick for the few days we were there and the staff were exceptional in helping us out in every way they could. . Druids Heath Golf course has already been renovated thoroughly and looks fantastic. Couldn’t play it sadly on this occasion. But I used the driving range Meanwhile arguably the best course in Ireland, Druids Glen, is now being renovated and so closed. The local members told me about some of the changes and by all accounts it will be magnificent when completed. The 17th, famous par 3, will be even better too. 
Dangerous to single out anyone but John and Colm (?spelling) in the Pro Shop were outstanding. Thanks guys. Like Arnie, We’ll be back !",5,2022,11,18
238,Thoroughly Enjoyable stay,"My wife and I booked a two night stay in Druids Glen as a birthday treat.Everything about our stay was thoroughly enjoyable ,so much so  we booked a third night in the resort.From Staff to accomodation to Food to the Leisure facilities in a beautiful setting, credit is due to an excellent run establishment.As one who travels for a living one of the best hotels in a beautiful part of Ireland.Hope to return again.
Continued success.",5,2022,11,17
238,Druids glen Hotel,"Myself, spouse and family were in the Druids glen Hotel weekend 12th November 2022,
We definitely had a great weekend. Staff very welcoming and professional. Food for all including grandchildren was excellent with a great menu in both restaurants. 
For a 5 star hotel the atmosphere was of a very warm nature for all ages which is a testament to a collective effort on the Druids glen Hotel staff. Our grandchildren and their parents  enjoyed their leisure facilities and were very impressed with swimming pool and general facilities attached to sauna and jacuzzi area. 
Breakfast is to die for with everything one could envisage and repeat if one could manage all the various foods available. 
So as you can see I was very impressed and would return in a heartbeat. It is expensive but I must say in our case a significant birthday, it definitely ticked all our boxes.

238,Still special,"Druids Glen is our favourite hotel in Ireland, it was a pleasure to be back, there is nowhere else where you will enjoy this level of comfort and this level of peace and quiet. 

We look forward to returning",5,2022,11,16
238,Warm welcome and excellent facilties,"We stayed last Friday night, we received a warm welcome, our room was spotless and the added touch of the Bathrobes for kids as well as the kid's toiletries were really nice.  The whole Hotel is very well presented, and the food was 100%.  Lovley walks for the family and the kids playroom has something for all ages. ",5,2022,11,14
238,Disappointed ,"I have stayed here before and always loved it, but found the recent overnight with my two children disappointing. We arrived on Friday evening at approximately 5.30pm (after school, we couldn't arrive any earlier). I specifically asked at check in did we need to book a pool time, and was told we could go 'whenever' we wanted. We went to our room, changed and arrived at the pool at 6pm, to be told we were not allowed to go into the pool as 'family time' was over. Both children were very upset, and we had to go back to our room. No pool times were included in reservation emails either. We were only there for one night and the children were so excited to go swimming, so made the evening a massive disappointment. When I spoke to the manager he was very apologetic, and kindly included free drinks and dessert at dinner- and while I greatly appreciate the gesture, it didn't mean much to my children who missed out on a swim. We specifically booked a hotel with a pool for that purpose. I understand that hotels operate family times for swims- but the times were not communicated to me, even when speaking directly about the matter to check in staff? 
The fact that the pool/gym is open to external members takes away from the '5 star' experience to be honest, the next morning when we did get to swim there was a number of children's swimming lessons taking place in the pool at the same time,  which meant we could only use part of the pool. 
The next morning at breakfast I also saw a staff member pick up scrambled egg that had dropped on the counter at the buffet, and toss it back into the pot of eggs- with his bare hands.... I was pretty shocked. 
It's a lovely hotel, staff are very nice. But a disappointing experience overall. ",2,2022,11,11
238,Excellent Stay,"Except stay and fantastic for young families. Staff are so helpful and I never felt under pressure with the kids with us. Highly recommend this hotel. 
The area is also gorgeous, especially Greystones.",5,2022,11,05
238,Night away,"Had a wonderful experience here. 

Staff were very professional and knew exactly what they were doing. Menu is nice and I ate in the bar  for lunch and dinner - the portions were huge and tasty. 

Breakfast was lovely the next day. they had everything on display with a choice of different eggs brought fresh to you which was nice. 

The bedroom was gorgeous and the bed was so comfortable. The decor is lovely in the hotel and very modern overall. 

They have designated adult and kids times for the pool which is very clever. 

I cannot wait to come back thank you for a lovely experience.",5,2022,11,04
238,Excellent experience,Great time hotel lovely staff friendly and efficient will be back! Very family friendly rooms lovely food great unfortunately weather not great but managed stroll in grounds would like to see in summer,5,2022,11,01
238,Great Stay at Druids Glen,Excellent service during our stay ! Food quality and accommodation was very good and staff members were attentive. Druids Heath Course in excellent condition. Would certainly return on another visit to Ireland ,5,2022,10,29
238,Anniversary break,Super experience which was very relaxing with very friendly staff - we last visited in 2014 with our children and this visit didn’t disappoint - we aim to come back in the near future. Would highly recommend.,5,2022,10,29
238,"Druids Glen Hotel and Spa, Amazing!","The Druids Glen is in one word amazing!
The staff are efficient, friendly and go out of their way to make your stay great.
The food in Hugo restaurant is gorgeous.
The rooms are clean, and comfortable. 
luxurious bedding means a great sleep. Overall a fantastic experience. I would recommend to anyone looking for a luxury hotel stay. ",5,2022,10,28
238,"Good hotel, unfortunately slightly underwhelmed","A rather nice hotel but not quite 5 star IMHO, but excellent if it was a 4 star. No fridge in room, broken curtain, aircon/heating did not work, but staff really excellent and friendly. Food was good, just not quite 5 star. Architecturally it feels more like an airport hotel for business travellers than a country retreat for relaxation, not quite a home from home. The staff made up for the building. Don't wish to sound too negative, but its only fair to relate our experience. Would I go again, yes, but I would only expect 4 star standard of facilities. We've been fortunate to stay in some charming 5 star hotels that really felt like home.",3,2022,10,27
238,A most enjoyable experience.,"A superb location close to a good range of amenities including two superb in house golf courses. The choice and the quality of breakfast was superb. Hugo’s restaurant was a wonderful experience with a limited, but good range of wine. Facilities are second to none. What makes Druids Glen so special is the staff. Professional, most helpful and all with a genuine smile. Nothing is a problem for them. They made , what was a superb break, extra special. Thanks again. We will be back!",5,2022,10,26
238,Fabulous hotel,"This was our third visit to Druids Glen and will not be our last,we absolutely love this hotel especially the suite it’s so comfortable,we love having the sitting room to relax in,the bed is huge and really comfortable ",5,2022,10,24
238,Unbelievable!!,"I honestly don’t even know where to start!!
Beyond amazing from the first moment we got there until the moment we left! 
Druid’s Glen is absolutely stunning and the rooms are second to none but THE STAFF?!! They’re the real star of the show! 
Sandor, Katie, Christian & Laura are the main staff members we were chatting with in the 4 days we were there and it was like leaving friends when we were coming home!
Whatever they are being paid, it just isn’t enough! 
They honestly can’t do enough, are so attentive, always smiling, always chatty and just so friendly, they made our stay what it was!
Thank you so much to everyone in Druid’s Glen! We already can’t wait to visit again!

238,Overnight trip with friend,"The service was fantastic. The hotel is lovely and relaxing for a one night stay. Food was good in the garden room and cannot compliment the staff enough - everyone we dealt with was a pleasure. Only downside was no availability for a treatment in the spa but we only tried to book less than one week in advance. A real treat to stay here!

Really enjoyable experience and highly recommend",5,2022,10,23
238,Excellent Hotel in the heart of the ‘Garden of Ireland’,"My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights to celebrate our wedding anniversary. When we checked in the lovely lady welcomed us to the hotel and congratulated us on our anniversary and we also got a wonderful upgrade. We stayed in Room 303 and it is a lovely spacious room with a very nice view. We had our dinner in the bar area the first night which was brilliant and then the 2nd night we dined at Hugo’s restaurant. This was a wonderful treat, everything about the restaurant is great, food, service, ambiance. The hotel offers very personal touches, when we ordered desert, they wrote happy anniversary on the plates, totally unexpected but adds to the very personal touch at this hotel. Likewise, every evening a member of staff would knock on the door and check if everything was ok, if you needed extra towels, extra tea, milk etc, this was the first time we have had this service and it was excellent. Every morning there was a newspaper, which my husband loves. We used the pool facilities and they were great too, it is set out so that you can actually swim in lanes, which is really good. We got spa treatments which were very relaxing, the spa area is getting an upgrade so there is no relaxing room to go to after treatments, but hopefully this will be completed for our next visit. Overall, this hotel is excellent, you couldn’t fault it - staff are excellent and will endeavour to help and assist at all times. In addition, breakfast in the morning is first class. We would definitely return to the Druids Glen and highly recommend it.  ",5,2022,10,20
238,Overpriced. Underwhelmed.,"We stayed in Druids Glen for 2 nights midweek in august 2022 and it was very disappointing. We had a voucher for one night b & b including evening meal in Hugo’s restaurant and had decided to stay an extra night prior to our arrival. The first thing I would say about the hotel is that there are some really pleasant experienced staff but there is also a large cohort of the staff that are not attentive and do not want to be there. It was relatively quiet when we stayed yet it was almost impossible to get the attention of floor staff who frequently observed standing together at the bar chatting or looking at their phones. This was frustrating particularly when a pint of Moretti was almost €7 and most cocktails were €14! We ate in Hugo’s restaurant the first night and both decided  to order the fillet steak which was €42 without a side! The steak was one of the worst we had both ever tasted and neither of us ate the meat. The meat itself was really poor quality so we didn’t take the waitresses offer up to have a replacement and ordered a different dish from the bar menu. The room we had was ok but didn’t not feel like a 5 star experience. Reasonably clean, the showers could do with being upgraded and was small and dated. The second night we got a taxi into Greystones for food and a drink which was excellent. All in all our experience in Druids glen was underwhelming and we left feeling ripped off. The hotel food and beverage menus and staff are badly in need of a revamp. Needless to stay we won’t be returning.",2,2022,10,16
238,Excellent,"I booked here for 4 of us as I’d been a few times before. It did not disappoint. From check in to check out the staff could not have been any nicer or helpful. It really was fabulous and cannot wait to return. 

",5,2022,10,16
238,Small wedding ,"We had a small wedding in the hotel this day last week. 
From the moment we arrived the staff couldn't do more for us. Nessa the wedding coordinator was really welcoming and so easy to deal with on the day and in the weeks before. She is a lovely lady.

The management on the day/evening and also next morning were Liam Roy and John. 
3 nicer men you could not meet. They were so helpful and are a wonderful team to lead this amazing hotel. 

The food was really good and the service staff were extremely friendly and approachable. 

So glad we picked Druids Glen to celebrate our wedding. 

We will definitely go back 100%
",5,2022,10,13
238,Druids Glen Spa disappointment,"Fantastic looking Hotel, great location! Lovely food but unfortunately very disappointing spa offering. The spa facilities are based right beside the hotel Gym, the idea of a therapeutic experience that allows you unwind and forget all of the stresses of life is not going to be achievable here. 

My treatment room that was sharing a wall with the main gym, was an echo of hammering treadmills and heavy gym weights being dropped to the floor throughout my treatment

Friendly staff but I imagine even they were  embarrassed knowing this type of environment for a spa is just well below par. .

Unfortunately it was a very bad experience and won't be revisited / recommended",1,2022,10,12
238,A/C,"Shame I have to give it such a low rating as the hotel is very nice, but the a/c didn't work in our room and we only noticed when we got back from a late night out. We rang reception and two people came to look at it but there was nothing they could do, we asked to be moved but the hotel was fully booked. It was very hot in the room and we didn't get a good night sleep. After going home I emailed the hotel and told them of the problem, they said they could give me discount on my next stay, they upgraded the room and told me it was € 205 for the night. I asked if I could be put in a smaller ordinary room with discount on that type of room, which would have been €255 for the night without discount. They said they could not do this for some reason, I told them it was too expensive and I couldn't afford it but they wouldn't put me in a cheaper room. The whole experience has been bad and very stressfull.",1,2022,10,12
238,Excellent stay,Again enjoyed our stay here.. As always hotel is very clean. Breakfast was great indeed. lots of items to select and break the fast :-). Had a dinner at night in Garden room. very calm and pleasant..overall.. Kids also enjoyed the pool and playground.. and wanted to come back again to experience it..,5,2022,10,04
238,Disappointing,"I would not say this hotel is a 4 or 5 star, it was very disappointing, decor wise it was very outdated & grubby, service in bar & restaurants was dreadful !!!
Fire alarm was set off 3 times in 1 night..
We’ve visited many Irish hotels but Very disappointed with our experience here & would not recommend plus it wasn’t cheap!",1,2022,10,01
238,Weekend away with family,"Stayed here with all family members and everything was grand. The rooms are very spacious, clean, nice and beds are comfortable. The swimming pool is nice and all the facilities next to the pool are lovely. Unfortunately kids aren’t allowed into the pool until after 2pm, bit of a disappointment. The spa treatments I had were lovely and the relaxing room was very nice. The food was good but needs improvement. The breakfast was ok some hot dishes at breakfast I had were not hot enough which was a disappointment. The food at the bar was just alright one night I had soup which was lovely and then a lamb curry which wasn’t nice at all too much sauce and too salty and then one other day I had a chicken burger again not great quite bland. The food in Hugo’s restaurant well I loved every second of that, and the service was really quick as well. There also lovely walks to do, and places to visit such as Greystones.   Would I come back again. Yes I would.",4,2022,10,01
238,Disappointing break,"Booked 2 nights B&B with 4 course meal in Hugo's.  Advised 1 week prior to arrival Hugo's would be closed not compensation made.  Food in the Garden room was limited and poor quality.  Also limited tables to eat at, we were expected to eat our meal at a coffee table.  TV in rooms not working advised they were trying to upgrade their system. Trail Walk was closed due to work on the Glen Golf Course which was also closed.",2,2022,09,29
238,Druids - Small disappointments,"The location and facility are very nice. Some employees were very helpful, others were rude. The establishment could be outstanding with some TLC and staff training. The breakfast buffet was outstanding with great choices.",3,2022,09,22
238,Family trip,The service used to be much better. We were not offered high chair for our baby at the breakfast or at dinner. Very dissapointing. Otherwise room was very nice and baby pantry with sterilisator and bottle warmer is very useful. ,3,2022,09,20
238,Disappointing,"For a 5 start hotel, I was very disappointed. The breakfast selection was very poor, the breakfast service (toast and coffees) was impossible to get. Room service forgot our orders a lot. Front of house was quite rude when requesting bags that were left at reception for a bride and groom. 
Pool was nice, sauna was out of service when I went though. It was very unfortunate as I was dying to see this hotel. But I found it quite expensive for the quality of service and food.",2,2022,09,19
238,Most Relaxing Stay,"My wife and I had a 3 day break in Wicklow and this was our first time staying at Druids Glen Hotel. What a wonderful hotel it is!
Our room was a superior room which was spacious and comfortable, had a great bathroom and relaxing chairs to enjoy the superb view of the Wicklow hills. The tranquility of the room is just perfect for unwinding.
Housekeeping were very attentive during our stay and the room was well stocked with bottled water,robes,comfortable bed and toileteries. 
The lounge area in the hotel is very comfortable and we really liked the colours of the furnishings and the stonework.
Breakfast was a spectacle to behold! We haven't seen such a great selection of hot and cold items on a hotel breakfast buffet in a long time. Furthermore, the bacon,sausages,eggs, scrambled eggs were all perfectly cooked every morning. We also had lunch and evening meals on two nights in the Garden Rooms. All were perfect and my wife particularly enjoyed the Rib-eye steak (melt in your mouth!) and I enjoyed the Lamb Madras Curry.
Gitana and Roman looked after us very well in the Garden Rooms bar. Thanks for that.
The hotel is well situated for visiting numerous places e.g. Sally Gap, Glendalough,Powerscourt etc
For something different, I got a gift voucher from Newcastle Airfield (10 minutes drive away) and had a flight over Wicklow for 1 hour, even flying over the hotel on the way back to the Airfield!
Overall we had a very relaxing break and look forward to coming back again.",5,2022,09,17
238,"Wonderful, relaxing stay","Spent a week here with wife, son and daughter in law.  We used DG as our base as we traveled over the eastern and southeastern region.

P.S. great gym if you want a work out.",5,2022,09,16

238,Great service,We stayed at Druids Glenn today. We have had a wonderful experience from front desk to the gardens restaurant. In particular we had the privilege of being served by Laura in the Gardens. She is an absolute gem. What a wonderful beaming personality. She is an absolute positive asset to your staff. We wish her nothing but the best in her future,5,2022,09,10
238,Wonderful stay,"Friendly staff, caters for Coeliacs, very nice breakfast area and good breakfast. Lovely hotel grounds and beautiful places to visit within an hour or so from hotel. Also just an hour drive from Dublin airport. ",4,2022,09,08
238,2 night stay,Lovely weekend Break and i must compliment the accomondation staff rooms were spotless and staff very friendly. Food & Drink was very good. Breakfast service was ok staff were not as friendly in general although some were I hate being negative just honest review.,4,2022,09,06
238,Great hotel for kids,"We stayed here as part of a family holiday with our toddler and I couldn't recommend the hotel enough. The staff were so great at accommodating our requests, there is an onsite playground and playroom which he loved. The food in the Garden Bar was exceptional, and they had a great selection from the kids menu. ",5,2022,09,05
238,40th anniversary celebration,"Lovely hotel. Delighted to be upgraded to an Executive Suite together with a gift of chocolates. Staff very pleasant and helpful. Lovely breakfast but disappointed that restaurant not open on Mondays and Tuesdays as we would have liked a special meal for our anniversary. Water aerobic class on and jacuzzi empty on the 2nd morning when we went to use facilities. Overall, really enjoyed our stay. ",4,2022,09,01
238,Great but don’t be caught out by the dining,"Lovely hotel & staff who go the extra mile. Really lovely touch to offer us a bottle of water for our journey on checkout. The 12pm checkout was a nice surprise as well. Breakfast was lovely but please be warned if you are not going to Hugo’s (the Michelin starred one) or it’s not open, your alternative in-hotel dining option is overpriced for what it is. Like, seriously overpriced. It’s a euro or two shaved off the Michelin star restaurant prices, for pretty average pub food. In fact I’ve been to pubs which have much more gourmet food than this! It would have been fine if meals had been €13/14-16, but you’re talking €22 for a standard fish and chips, €20 for burger & chips, veggie options were still €17/18 and to get chicken and chips you were talking €26!!! And like I say, it was nowhere near top of my pub grub dining experiences!",4,2022,08,30
238,A very relaxing family trip!,"Family getaway with my husband & my 8 year old son. Our stay at Druids Glen was excellent all round. We could not have faulted anything. The welcome, the bedroom, the food and the staff were all 5 star. Will definitely be back!",5,2022,08,27
238,Absolutely superb,"I just returned from a family overnight to celebrate my mother’s milestone birthday. We dined in the restaurant, used the pool & I had a treatment in the spa. The main notable thing was the quality of the staff and service whether at reception, restaurant, spa & bar. They were so friendly, helpful & efficient. Although we arrived early our rooms were ready which I didnt expect and they are spacious. A friendly team called to the room offering more coffees, toiletries etc Dinner was delicious & great choice & service at breakfast. The treatment was great & the spa was peaceful. i couldnt recommend more highly.",5,2022,08,25
238,Excellent family stay,"We had a wonderful stay, very family friendly and a beautiful hotel with great facilities. The staff were accommodating and even in some cases where the breakfast was very busy everyone was happy to help ",5,2022,08,22
238,Birthday celebration in Wicklow,"Great location. Plenty of parking.
Two golf courses, pool, outdoor children's play area.
It also has residential properties where one can live on site, house selling around c €500k +.
Hogo's restaurant pricey. Food nice but quite expensive. Service in the restaurant was excellent",4,2022,08,22
238,Weekend stay,Excellent hotel and very friendly staff. Beautiful breakfast experience. No noise at night despite the hotel hosting two weddings during our stay.  Great location for accessing both the city and the amazing scenery that Wicklow offers. ,5,2022,08,22
238,Historic garden trip,"Great location, very clean, friendly staff excellent rooms and plenty of facilities and best value in the area. Lovely breakfast and a really nice stay. Did not try restaurant but bar food was pretty good the chicken wings were excellent. Overall good value. ",5,2022,08,21
238,Outstanding stay!,"My partner and I have just returned from a stay in Druids Glen and can't stop raving about our excellent experience. The hotel is so well maintained, staff are so friendly and the rooms are beautiful. We were fortunate enough to stay in a suite - WOW. So spacious, luxurious with two televisions! Also loved the turn-down service and beautiful toiletries. We enjoyed  an outstanding dinner in Hugo's restaurant. Food was absolutely delicious and staff were extremely professional. Very positive atmosphere. Highly recommend a few drinks in the bar afterwards - the cocktail menu is extensive. Gorgeous breakfast. Thanks so much - we can't wait to return! Don't delay - just book! Siobhán and Paul",5,2022,08,20
238,3 night family holiday,"Fabulous stay, very clean hotel, really looked after my staff especially the General Manager Aidan. Great location in centrally based to visit all the many highlights of Co Wicklow. Breakfast is full fresh every morning and the food at the hotel is really good from fine dining to casual bar food…",5,2022,08,20
238,2 night stay,Great 2 night stay in superior room. Bed very comfy and room air con excellent in the warm weather. Staff very good especially Brooke in the bar and her amazing strawberry daiquiri. Spa/ pool facilities spotlessly clean and breakfast top class. Will be back. ,5,2022,08,13
238,Druids Glen,Very welcoming hotel with friendly attentive staff. Size of the bedrooms and available beds better than in most other 5 star hotels. Prices have remained reasonable for the experience sold which is in sharp contrast to many other hotels which are essentially gouging guests with dramatic price increases,4,2022,08,12
238,Family holiday,"We stayed in druids glen for 2 nights. 2 children and 2 adults. This hotel is very beautiful and the grounds are fabulous. Our family bedroom was spacious and spotless. The Accommodation assistants were excellent.  They did great job restocking room and checking if we needed anything. The kids club were also very good. One of my children went and they had their tea there ,played games and watched a movie and they loved it. Its such a shame during summer months that it doesn't run every night as my child loves kids clubs. So the one night was disappointing especially because we only stayed for 2 nights. Staff there were very professional. The kids games room was separate to the kids club. This was in dire need of a tidy and cleaning. The toys were wrecked and the room so messy. I feel this room could be great and a lovely place for kids to make friends etc but I was shocked with how messy it was. The food in the hotel was lovely and staff were on the ball. Breakfast was also lovely. The hotel  had went up in price alot since our previous stay but this is across the board with Irish hotels. We played golf which the kids loved.We had a fabulous experience. I feel the druids strikes the balance right between luxury and family orientated which alot of other 5 star hotels struggle with. It would be nice to see more Irish people employed in the hotel. Maybe there is but on check in and at the bar there wasn't and communication just isn't the same as with the Irish. But this hotel truly is  a treat and we loved it.",5,2022,08,12
238,Friends get together,"Really enjoyed our stay.  Beds so comfy. Only thing found it hard to communicate with bar staff but they were very friendly.  (Not their fault). From the time we arrived to our departure we really enjoyed it.  We were sorry that it was so short, we plan to come back in the Autumn to try your spa and swimming pool.
Thanks again for a lovely stay.  We will be back so watch out!!!!",5,2022,08,10
238,Never Fails to Deliver,"One of the few hotels where there can be a wedding taking place & you do not feel like you are crashing the wedding, great set up & completely separated. Beautiful hotel, beautiful grounds, excellent Spa. Just one issue regarding sustainability.....operate a wonderful breakfast buffet but with that there needs to be better food management, 20 mins from close of breakfast with only a trickle of people coming in, the entire cooked breakfast was topped up with a mountain of food, such a waste. Also there should be separate recycling bins in the bedrooms. Overall ALWAYS a wonderful stay. ",5,2022,08,08
238,Annual Holiday,"We have been visiting Druid’s Glen hotel for  many years and it never fails us.It was great to see some familiar staff especially Michelle.
We had a lovely room & the grandchildren enjoyed the hotel immensely. There was plenty to keep them amused especially the swimming pool.
Staff had a great knowledge of the area & advised of a new attraction that had recently opened and we were not disappointed with Avondale.
It was a very memorable break which will be cherished for a very long time.",5,2022,08,05
238,Disappointed frequent guest ,"Just back from a night in druids glen (probably my 15/16th stay,even got married here in 2006), and I have to say although I had a great night away with my friend and our children I was so disappointed with my room (number 355). The bathroom smelt musty and all night long the ceiling light inside the front door leaked big drops of water,the carpet was drenched this morning. I mentioned this when checking out and the man said it was probably the air conditioning, although I do think it was the light fitting which was risky in terms of getting electrocuted!  Picture attached to this review. My friends room (356) had the light switch hanging off the wall (the light switch for the bathroom). The dinner in the garden room was lovely and staff very nice, kids enjoyed the playroom and the pool was great. We also had a lovely breakfast this morning. Not sure will I be returning any time soon. ",3,2022,08,02
238,Druids Glen,Overall a pleasant stay although its a bit on the expensive side regarding food and drinks. the walking track closed off in areas due to works on the course but it was badly signposted. found the staff friendly and helpful.,4,2022,08,02
238,Great Family holiday,"Stayed with our two daughters, 6 and 4. Good location for exploring Wicklow. Most things less than 30 mins away. Staff very friendly and helpful, promptly answered emails prior to us arriving to ensure we had everything we needed. Beds very comfortable, bath for the children in room. 
We used the kids club 2 nights and the children loved it. Ate at the bar on these nights- fish of the day was spot on. 
Perfect spot for a relaxing and trouble free family holiday. ",5,2022,07,30
238,Very lovely,"The place is beautiful and elegant, but also expensive. To be honest, we didn’t really get to enjoy any of the amenities as we were stay there simply because it was within walking distance of a friend’s house we were visiting. He is a member of the golf club there and encouraged us to stay there as he gets a discount. We merely slept there and left at 5:30 am the next day for a tour.",5,2022,07,29
238,Birthday celebration with a party of 11,"Stayed one night in hotel to celebrate a special birthday. Everything about the hotel was excellent, welcome gift for my wife, birthday meal, spa, children facilities, the staff were excellent, recommend staying in druids glen",5,2022,07,25
238,Excellent stay from arrival to departure.,"From arrival to departure we treated like royalty from all the staff. There was nothing that the staff could not help with and made sure that we had an unforgettable and enjoyable stay. A special mention and thanks to the black haired girl in the breakfast area who was very attentive and made arrangements for our son who has autism to be seated in a quiet area for the morning breakfast as this really calmed him down. Thank you all so much and your staff are amazing. Tony, Krista and Adam. ",5,2022,07,25
238,Wedding event,"The only negative was our room was a good walk,  but in fairness I didn't ask to be moved as we were only there for one night,But apart from that everything was Brilliant ,from the moment we arrived to the moment we left",5,2022,07,24
238,Underwhelmed,Hugo’s menu and quality of food was a big let down. This is still a great Hotel but has lost its identity a little. The staff generally were lovely but we didn’t see any Restaurant Manager or Bar Manager which can be reassuring in a top class Hotel. ,3,2022,07,23
238,Excellent family stay,"Brilliant family hotel. Staff friendly and helpful. Food lovely. Pool great for kids 
First class device. Excellent location close to beach and other locations such as powerscourt waterfall. Rooms beautiful ",5,2022,07,21
238,Another Lovely Stay....Impeccable Service ,"We're just home after a lovely night away at Druids. I've wanted to come back since my sister's wedding in 2018. As I remembered, it's still a wonderful experience. We stayed in an Executive Suite again, the room was perfect....large, well appointed, everything we needed. The staff, from the check in to the waiting staff, and housekeeping, were all so pleasant. Not easy during these difficult Covid times to keep things going smoothly. Food in the bar was nice and breakfast was great. ",5,2022,07,18
238,Holiday,"Toilet in Bathroom not suitable for disable person. I have seen far better facilities in motorway stops
and lesser grade hotels. one easy way to solve this would be to have a commode chair available when need.",3,2022,07,18
238,Hugo's Restaurant ☹️,"We booked two night stay at this five star hotel. Beautiful location and rooms beautiful and view. Everything was lovely and overall hotel staff so nice. First night we dined in garden room beautiful and food lovely service was very very good. Second night was special we decided to dine in Hugo's . High expectations but was so so disappointed,service was very bad,  insufficient inexperienced staff and was expensive. Would not recommend it. It ruined our evening. ",3,2022,07,18
238,Short Break,"Everything was excellent from arrival to departure. Staff went over and above our expectations to ensure our stay was perfect. Reception staff were so friendly and so helpful. I have visited many hotels and can honestly say I have never experienced service like I did here, it certainly made our stay all that more enjoyable.",5,2022,07,16
238,Family Getaway,"Beautiful hotel in the heart of stunning Wicklow, so much to do in the area we always find something else the next time.
My only fault would be that the service isn't always up to par or as smooth as it could be, maybe a common staffing problem at the minute, but once that's sorted I can't see anything to complain about",4,2022,07,16
238,Wedding party,"Beautiful hotel, excellent staff. I attended a wedding in Druid's Glen recently, from arrival to departure the staff couldn't do enough for the guests, top class facilities and service throughout. The hotel is well worth a visit for its beautiful location, the welcoming staff, good food , the rooms are spotless and spacious and we got a great rate which is an added bonus in the current climate..",5,2022,07,12
238,4 night stay for family wedding,"Excellent all around hotel - comfortable and friendly.  Good food in bar and restaurant.  Rooms very comfortable and nice lounge areas.  Good wedding venue with lovely area for outdoor ceremony.  Warm and friendly staff.
Only issue was service at breakfast where we were left waiting at table with no-one allocated to tables or taking tea/coffee/toast orders promptly.",5,2022,07,12
238,Well worth it,"Hotel clearly priorities customer service.
Excellent experience from start to finish.
We took the indulgence package. So experienced afternoon tea, spa treatments and dinner
Room was lovely.
No complaints and no recommendations for improvement.. keep doing what your doing",5,2022,07,10
238,Great family hotel,Excellent hotel. See @lilmisscoeliac on Instagram for review I talked about the food and facilities. Our daughter is a coeliac and they made sure she was well catered for. She wasn’t ill once and had a great time ,5,2022,07,10
238,Perfect,"The Druids Glen Hotel truly is perfect. We stayed for 6 nights during home renovation works and it was a home away from home. The staff are exceptional, the property is stunning, there is no wear and tear to the rooms, good food, beautiful grounds, fantastic health club. ",5,2022,07,10
238,10th anniversary of druids glen wedding,"We held our Wedding reception with a 2nd day bbq in druids glen Hotel at the end of june 2012. We decided to celebrate our 10 year anniversary with  a stay on the sat before the anniv.

 On booking I made the booking agent aware of the occasion as it was a surprise for my wife. We got zero acknowledgement. I mean a folded towel or box of chocolates even a card just a simple show of appreciation of what was a big occasion for us. 

We went for a pre dinner drink in the bar only  to be refused entry as there was a wedding in progress.  We asked to sit outside but as there was recent showers drying seats were apparently too much an imposition. Thankfully we had bought the €365 1 night dinner package or we would have had the choice of the lobby or back to the room.

My wife's meal was nice  I had monkfish that had the consistency of a hard rubber with an incredibly rude waitress. To her credit the staff appeared overworked. 

We spent over €500 for 1 night 20 mins from home. The hotel itself is beautifully appointed with very comfortable rooms but whomever is responsible for the administration of it is in way over their heads. Any group/person invested in this should be concerned. The money has been spent but the service is not there. 

I cannot speak for weddings but from my experience if you are looking for a night away where you intend to leave the room there are other options where your business is appreciated.

On a plus note they had a guitarist in the bar after the meal which to our relief we were allowed in. He was excellent. Well done to him.",1,2022,07,09
238,Great but potential to be excellent.,Enjoyable stay in a lovely hotel. Staff were friendly and well trained. Great choice for breakfast. Pool was great. Some attention and updating to children’s facilities would have made a big difference to our stay. ,4,2022,07,08
238,Familiy Holidays,"We had a wonderful time during our stay at Druids Glen and would definitely come back again. The staff was very kind, the rooms were perfectly clean. The Golf Course was in Perfect condition.
Overall everything was perfect.",5,2022,07,07
238,Excellent stay for family wedding,"Lovely accommodation and great level of staffing. Reception staff very helpful. One observation was there was a smell of body odour in the bedroom corridor during our stay, but did not really detract from the overall enjoyment of the stay.",5,2022,07,06
238,Anniversary,"We stayed there for our anniversary, a year later everything is still excellent, staff is very welcoming, the rooms are immaculate, the food is lovely and overall standards are kept as high as always. Absolute joy to stay in this place!",5,2022,07,05
238,Nice Hotel in a beautiful location,"When we arrived at the hotel, the checkin procedure ran smoothly.  We were shown to the room promptly and the room was really big and very clean.  We were attending a wedding so we didn't get a chance to sample the food in the bar/restaurant.  The spa was really nice and relaxing.  My only quibble was the fact that all the information was on the TV and nobody informed me about that until it was too late.  As a result I missed breakfast which I would gladly have had in the room had I known that it was a possibility.  Also, I didn't know where the pool was located until it was too late (as this information was also available on the TV)!  I just feel that it might be a good idea to put a flyer in the room to let people know where the facilities are located - especially for elderly people who may not be aware of how to find this information on the TV.  Apart from that we had a lovely stay at Druid's Glen. ",4,2022,07,04
238,Lovely location and facilities,Druid's glen is a nice family friendly hotel and a really good place to get away for a quiet night with a friend and to enjoy the pool and gym. The breakfast choice was fantastic and the rooms were lovely and clean.,5,2022,07,03
238,Over priced,"Over priced for a hyped up hotel paid money for 2 day stay then got chard extra for food that I paid for I’ll never return complete rip off pool nice and warm but jacuzzi cold, lovely area but the price on the bar menu out rages ",2,2022,06,15
238,Great Stay,We had an excellent stay at Druid's Glen. The family room was very comfortable and the little touches such as the child size dressing gown and children's toiletries were loved by our toddler. The swimming pool was warm and perfect for family swimming. Dinner in Hugo's was excellent as was the breakfast. We would be very happy to return.,5,2022,06,14
238,Extremely Rude waitress,"Booked 2 rooms for 4 nights, paid in full upon arrival.  We ordered coffee/cake on the terrace, a waitress took our order and said I hope you are going to pay as people run away. We were shocked at being spoken to like this and told her we were guests in the hotel, showed her our room cards/numbers. The next evening my friend and I ordered a meal with the same unfriendly waitress.  I  realised I had left my purse in my room, again she said I hope you come back as people run away and do not pay, in front of all the other diners.  I found this extremely humiliating and uncomfortable. The hotel needs to train their staff to treat guests with respect.",3,2022,06,10
238,Golfing tuition Patrick Geraghty,"Fantastisches Hotel , 
Excellent Golf pro Patrick Geraghty started our girls with golf 4 years ago and now put a smile on everybody. He improves everybodies game and tailors his tuition to everybodies needs.",5,2022,06,09
238,Didn't feel 5*,"We were seated for afternoon tea 20 minutes after our booking time. We had no cutlery or butter on our table and when I asked the waitress, it was all taken off a table a another couple had been sitting at for ten minutes. We were told a window seat was being cleared for us for our dinner reservation, then it was given to another couple. We requested an ice cooler to the room, it never came. Who I assume was the breakfast manager looked inconvenienced when I asked her for a glass for orange juice. Overall we didn't walk away feeling like we had been in a 5* hotel. That being said the room was very clean and the food was good quality. Some staff were very friendly and accommodating but no all.",3,2022,06,08
238,"Great location, poor food.","The hotel was great for the kids, we loved the pool, the games room, the playground and the grounds. The only let down was the restaurant. Breakfast was 9/10 to be fair, such a good spread, but dinner and lunch were 3/10. Tiny menu, poor quality and the kids didn't even eat their dinner's, they usually eat the plate. A food refund and new menu would only make us go back, which is a pity as it has so much potential as a family and golfing hotel. ",3,2022,06,08
238,"Avoid - lack of service, over charged for items, room in need of a deep clean","Prior to our stay, I had received two emails to say that my dinner and breakfast bookings were cancelled. I had to rebook and a week or so later I got another email to say that the dinner booking was cancelled again, no explanation was provided in any emails. I emailed back after receiving the second cancellation email for dinner and was told that it was because there were two bookings for dinner under my name. 
When we checked in, we went to the Garden Bar for lunch. We were left standing at the desk for over five minutes, even though staff could clearly see that we were waiting. There were two staff members, one being whom seemed like a manager (dark three piece suit) talking to one of the servers, who could see we were waiting. It wasn’t until we walked up to them were we asked if we were okay. 
While seated for lunch in one of the booths, the same manager above, was now talking to (more so at) another member of staff, seemed like the bar manager. He was giving out about something that had happened the day before and seemed like a staffing issue. This was very uncomfortable to listen to and highly unprofessional to have these conversations in earshot of guests. 
Our room (132), was not the cleanest of rooms and aged. There were very obvious spider webs visible above the bathroom mirror that could have easily have been removed if cleaned properly. The lightening in the bathroom was dull over the shower due to a light fixing not in place properly. The TV could only be turned off by pressing the button at the side of the TV. Furthermore, there were unsightly yellow stains on the side of the mattress (right hand side if lying on the bed). 
When we went for dinner, we were being shown to our reserved table, only to be told that it was given away to someone else and they had to find us another table. We were seated in a different booth this time. Both booths that we sat at for lunch and dinner had very visible stains on the seat cushions that were disgusting. 
After dinner, as my fiancé is pregnant and would be pretty tired, we had planned to watch a movie in our room on our fire stick and to find that the internet was not working, even though it was working fine prior to going for dinner. I rang the front desk and was told it was down due to the weather and they were working on it. The internet did not return for the remaining duration of our stay. I found the excuse of the weather not a realistic one as it was only raining, something that is quite common in Ireland! 
For breakfast, we were seated quite quickly at a table probably the furtherest away from the buffet, in front of a fireplace. We were told that there would be someone with us to order tea/coffee and toast. Nobody attended to us, even though we tried to get staff’s attention, and could clearly see us. After 10 minutes we had to find a server and order tea for two and toast. Only one small teapot arrived. Also our table only had one cup, no teaspoons, no spoons for cereal, no butter or jams, all of which we had to scavenge ourselves off other tables and from the corner where the servers would be as we could not get any staff’s attention and they were not coming down to us. 
When checking out, I was presented with the bill to ensure that it was correct. There was an extra charge of €56.30 that was added to my bill from the Garden Bar. I checked with my fiancé that we had paid for lunch on our card, not the room, and she said that was correct. I told the staff member at the front desk (I forget her name, badge said she was from India) that we did not charge this to the room. She spoke to her other colleague (badge said from Wicklow and had an American accent) and they tried to do something on her computer and they told me that there were problems with their computers. The girl from Wicklow asked me to wait a moment while she went to an office behind reception where she spoke to a lady there for several minutes. I overheard this lady instructing the girl to ask me to review the receipt and check that the signature (even though you have mine on file). The girl came back out and did as she was told and I instructed her again that I did not make this transaction. It was a large drinks order and the signature clearly was not my name. The girl went back into the office and then came back out and then charged me the amount that I should have been charged. Not once was I given an apology. I felt really embarrassed by this and really felt like I wasn’t being believed that I didn’t make this transaction, as if I was trying to steal something. I was pretty upset after this as it was just the icing on the cake for a bad experience.",1,2022,06,07
238,Family Birthday Celebration,Wonderful family weekend in this amazing hotel. Would definitely recommend it. Staff are so attentive and friendly and the cleanliness is top class. Lots of facilities for kids. Very spacious. Beautiful grounds to stroll around. ,5,2022,06,06
238,Never again,"Terrible stay - overpriced and low quality experience, hotel really needs to up its game to justify prices charged for everything from rooms to food to spa treatments.came home feeling exhausted and ripped off. Major disappointment to what was supposed to have been a special treat.",1,2022,06,03
238,Great family friendly hotel,Just returned from 3 day break at Druids Glen.  Hotel is clean and attractive; staff very friendly and welcoming.  Great food and great service made for a relaxing family break. Looking forward to returning again soon. ,5,2022,06,02

238,"Lovely hotel, but needs a bit of a shake up","Our third visit to Druids Glen in a fairly short period, so obviously we like the place.  This time, the ""B"" team seemed to be on duty, with long waiting times for service, a 20 minute check-in experience with a very confused receptionist, largely disinterested staff, and lots of little niggles, like cold breakfast served to room, lukewarm breakfast in restaurant, poor breakfast selection, seriously undercooked chips in Garden room, broken toilet roll holder that was not fixed despite bringing it to the attention of the housekeeping manager, badly serviced room, etc.  An enjoyable stay nonetheless, but falling far short of a five star experience.  In short, nothing to write home about, and poor value for nearly €1,000 for a two night stay (package deal, 2 x B&B, 1 dinner in suite)",4,2022,06,02
238,We should have booked Druid's Glen to start with,"A weekend of airport chaos and a cancelled flight precipitated this stay in Druid's Glen.  Oddly, on the way to the airport we did discuss how we should have booked Druid's Glen instead - and when the airline cancelled our flight (we were in the departure lounge) we made a quick call and the lovely Adrienne not only confirmed availability, a few hours later she was checking us in and welcoming us back to Druid's Glen.  

Druid's Glen is a perfect venue for long lazy lie-ins, relaxed breakfast, peace, quiet and getting away from the world.  The rooms, the food, the facilities are all excellent.  We have stayed here before, we will return again (probably this autumn), it remains our favourite hotel in Ireland.   

A special thanks to Adrienne - she is a role model for the Irish Hospitality industry and made our return trip to Druid's Glen more special.  

Thank you for having us",5,2022,06,01
238,We loved our stay in Druids Glen,"Excellent hotel with genuinely friendly staff providing a professional service.
I really enjoyed playing the Druids Heath golf course and swimming in the excellent pool. The quality of all the food we had was excellent.",5,2022,05,30
238,Spa 5* Hotel brilliant but not 5*,"This was our 3rd visit to Druids Glen and we love it. Its such a peaceful place. The spa is excellent and one of the best treatments myself or my mum have ever had. The pool area has everything you need with steam room, sauna, plunge pool and pool. We had afternoon tea as well as eating in Hugos. We were given a free dessert at lunch when the waiter over heard us talking about my birthday. As I said its our 3rd visit and we will be back but it isn't really 5*. On this occasion we were billed incorrectly 3 times at afternoon tea before we got the right bill, the seat in the sauna is broken, we had to chase 3 times for coffee at breakfast. The wee things need looked at but given COVID, staffing levels etc I know that may take a while!",4,2022,05,30
238,Excellent facilities for families,"Unfortunately we could only stay for one night but we will definitely be back again! This hotel was a big hit with our 2 young children. They loved the swimming pool, fairy garden, nature trail, outdoor playground and especially the games room which had plenty of toys for our youngest.

There was a baby room on the 2nd floor stocked with a steriliser, bottle warmer, fridge etc which was fantastic and something I haven’t come across in a hotel before.  Even though there was a wedding taking place at the hotel whilst we were staying and staff were busy, we still received excellent care as hotel guests. Highly recommend for families.",5,2022,05,30
238,Pleasant stay in very family friendly hotel,"The Druids Glen is a gem and you really get what you pay for. From the food to the facilities, everything is top notch. The staff is always nice and helpful. We enjoyed our stay as we had a really nice family time, playing with the kid in the pool and enjoying a walk along the trail or playing with him at the indoor play area. The food is top quality and I would definitely recommend anyone to go.",5,2022,05,30
238,Wedding,Had a great time with family for our nephews wedding.  Fantastic day from start to finish. All staff very attentive  especially the young chap serving the  reception drinks and we were lucky to have him as our waiter at dinner.  Plus the barbecue  the next day was as good as the wedding.,5,2022,05,29
238,Can't wait to return,"Amazing customer services is main reason I would return, then pair it with fantastic facilities and its 100% worth every penny. Even if your not into golf this place is still ideal and makes you feel like you can relax and just enjoy your stay with out having to leave the hotel. ",5,2022,05,27
238,Another lovely stay in Druids Glen,"My wife and i had another lovely stay in Druids Glen recently, staff were great as always, really friendly and helpful, the spa treatments were amazing, best massage i have had and the rooms were clean and welcoming. Garden room is a lovely area to sit and relax with good food and some drinks. ",5,2022,05,23
238,Perfect couples escape without having to drive forever,We visited Druids Glen for our wedding anniversary. It’s a perfect getaway that seems a world away from Dublin despite only being a 30 minute drive down the road. Not too big or impersonal with wonderful staff. Just perfect.,5,2022,05,20
238,Not good,"The rooms are tired and old with the need of TLC the handle of the door  of our balcony fell off leading to no access. This was rectified by upgrading us to a suite. We had booked two messages 55 mins each, my wife's was fine mine was barely 30 mins, on check out we engaged with reception we where told to wait for the manager (30 mins) he said there was nothing he could do as the particular masseuse was off until the following Monday!? The manger said he would be in contact he has not. Totally unacceptable for a 5 star Hotel let alone any establishment. Staff were great obviously under pressure and being trained but it is a 5 star resort sort it!!",3,2022,05,20
238,Wedding break,"the grounds of the hotel are gorgeous, the setting in Hugo’s bar is very modern and comfortable. Breakfast and lunch service was amazing staff couldn’t do enough. 

Some of the rooms need modernisation, for a 5 star hotel I was very disappointed with my room , decor was dated. Not what I expected for a 5 star hotel ",4,2022,05,16
238,Don't stay here with kids,"Pool is 1.2 meters and not 1m as told to us by reception 
Woodland and fairy walks are closed
Air con didn't work and no one available to fix it
We were told over the phone that there was a kids club on the Saturday night we were planning to book with a movie but on arrival were told no not this weekend we have a wedding on now. 
We had booked it was a family night away, don't waste your money, disaster.
Gave all feedback to hotel on check out, manager on duty to busy to talk to me,  was to phone,  heard nothing 
",1,2022,05,16
238,Anniversary break,"My husband and I stayed for two nights last week and had a wonderful time. We were treated to an upgrade to a suite which was wonderful as it was our 10th wedding anniversary! The staff, food, pool and spa were exceptional. We will most definitely return soon! ",5,2022,05,14
238,Two night break,"Three adults stayed for 2 nights. It was a very pleasant stay. The bedroom was comfortable, the staff were extremely pleasant. The food was very good .We ate in Hugo's on the first night,the food was amazing and the staff were exceptional. We ate in bar on second night and it was extremely  pleasant  experience. The coffee  machine in our room was not clean we left them know and a manager apologised,sent up a new machine immediately  and gave us 3 boxes of chocolates. We will def b back .The location was fabulous but for us the staff were so amazing in all areas of the hotel. We all wanted to stay longer.",5,2022,05,10
238,Needs to decide what type of hotel it is,"When looking for a relaxing spa break I wouldn’t advise coming here. Trying to cater towards both the people looking for a spa break and also those looking for a children friendly hotel doesn’t seem to be working for the guests. Hugo’s restaurant has more of a TGI Fridays feel to it and the pool area is like a Kids Club so it’s far from the relaxing romantic break I paid for. Nothing wrong with either type of break you are looking for but asking the two to co exist here is unfair to both sets of visitors.
The actual quality of the food I can’t fault and the rooms too are lovely. The grounds and the walks are very nice as well as the staff being very friendly but it does feel like I was sold something different which really taints it for me.",3,2022,05,09
238,Nicola & Joe’s Vitaflo Wkd May 6th to 8th 2022,"We arrived on the Friday at 3.50pm. The weather was abysmal but we didn’t let it deter us from enjoying ourselves! The bedroom is gorgeous! I actually thought it was like a junior suite!! The food we had for our dinner was gorgeous! The breakfast was sumptuous and there’s a good variety to choose from. We found the drinks to be a bit expensive but then we are in a 5 star hotel which one would expect! We are looking forward to the Vitaflo activities which start at 11.30am today and there’s a BBQ tonight for us Pkuers and partners so let’s hope the weather is good for that!.

There was a slight misunderstanding over the dinner bill about who was going to pay. I explained that it was part of the package we paid for when booking. It was cleared; no harm done.",5,2022,05,07
238,Hugos,"Played golf in Druids heath today (really enjoyable). However, the experience in Druids Glen hotel afterwards wasn't so enjoyable. We headed to hugos bar to order some food & were asked by a staff member: ""are you residents?"" ...""No""...""well we might need your table back if any residents come into the bar"". PLACE WAS HALF EMPTY. How rude! We just spent more money in the golf club than you would, staying for 1 night. Train your staff properly & teach them some social skills please",1,2022,05,06
238,Excellent!,"Our overnight stay at Druid’s Glen was excellent! The hotel and grounds were beautifully kept and the reception area, magnificent, with its high ceilings and roaring log fire. The staff were all truly exceptional: friendly, smiley, polite, immaculately dressed, extremely professional and certainly gave the impression that they were happy in their jobs! What struck us was the fact that they worked together as a fabulous team and that they were kind and respectful to one another. The management were always close by. They represented, for us, the essence of true Irish hospitality. Our hotel room was superbly comfortable and reasonably priced too. We dined in the bar in the evening and the food was very good, but our breakfast the next morning was something else! We were offered an absolutely fantastic selection of deliciousness, from a full Irish Breakfast, to a Continental Breakfast and everything in between. We would highly recommend Druid’s Glen, without hesitation.",5,2022,05,06
238,"Good family hotel, but not sure its quite the full 5 stars...","We stayed here during the mid-term break with the family and stayed in 2 adjoining rooms. We were really looking forward to staying in a 5-star resort, but from the check-in onwards, it really felt more like a 4 star experience. 

Appreciating it was busy wtih mid-term and COVID restrictions were still in place, we felt we were just being processed as part of a crowd at check-in and breakfast. 

The rooms were comfortable, but could have done with a good deep clean as some surfaces were quite dusty.  The breakfast was good, but nothing quite stood out as being distinctive. Scambled eggs were watery on most mornings. 

We had dinner in the restaurant which was good, but pricy for what it was. The bar food was good, but a pub level. We availed of golf and pool. The pool had very restricted times, but hopefullly this is just a COVID phenomena.

Overall a good time was had by all, in spite of the processed feel.",4,2022,05,03
238,A memorable experience for all the wrong reasons,After 2years of covid we were so pleased as a family to be able to get together  and the Druids Glenn came very highly recommended   even as we drove into the beautiful grounds of the hotel  the children were so excited     But that was about to be short lived,2,2022,05,03
238,Druids Glen Stay,Excellent stay.   Staff are always very friendly and the location is great.   Kids love the playroom.  Rooms very comfortable.   Only downside was the number of gluten free options.  We will be returning again.,5,2022,05,03
238,Druids Glen,"Breakfast is very poor we in fact got a breakfast in a local garage. The bacon, sausages, and pancakes felt like they were processed and not very tasty. No OJ in the tanks and asked several times. Didn't get offered tea or coffee and was not offered any toast. 

The AC in the room did not work and we could not sleep at all. Night snacks were awful and a sandwich from a local garage would have more taste and freshness about this. The sandwich we received was literally thrown together and it cost me €22.00 for the sandwich x 2 and handful of crisps. 

Got billed for a heap of drink to our room which we did not drink at all so on departure it was embarrassing as we had to explain these are not our drinks as we were not allowed to bill any drinks to our room so how could we of had any billed to us. 

Mix up in check in on arrival and departure that experience was very poor. Our room was downgraded and we did not get any option. We were told we could not use the voucher on a BH weekend so how were we able to book this. But we confirmed that their own hotel reservations had confirmed the booking. Again this was a little embarrassing for us upon check in. 

Our voucher entitled us to a stay for 1 night and 3 course dinner and breakfast but we actually ended up paying around €30.00 in food supplements which I was not expecting when the bill arrived. 

The experience felt very Ryanair like. The bar staff and we're very friendly and the waiters and waitresses were very friendly. ",2,2022,05,02
238,Old styled country lodge,"If you yearned for tradition and old-styled countryside living, then this is the place to be in.  Expect a slow and steady pace in everything with the quiet serenity at the nearby walking trails. 

If you can bring along your bicycle - the area is great for long riding trips.",4,2022,05,02
238,Expected 5 star got 3 star,"Just returned from a week in Ireland. Our last stay was at the Druids Glen. After having a week of wonderful hotels our final one was very disappointing. 
Our dinner sitting in the “bar” was loud and the selection of food was very disappointing.  The whole hotel felt old and tired.  Updating needs to be done!!",2,2022,05,01
238,Excellent hotel & lovely staff!,"We had a lovely stay in this hotel, food in restaurant was great! 

Breakfast was one of the best I’ve had lots of freshly chopped fruit for breakfast. Lots of choices including freshly cooked pancakes all of which were yummy!

Our room was spotlessly clean & lovely decor!

Lovely location for relaxation & walks.

Very close for lovely day trips too. We will definitely be back.",5,2022,05,01
238,Poor service,Won’t be returning unfortunately due to poor knowledge of staff and mix ups along with getting pork strips in a fish dish. Stale bread in afternoon tea. Service poor however it has to be said that the bedroom was very clean and comfortable. ,2,2022,05,01
238,Sister's Birthday,"Most friendly, helpful and efficient staff, always greeted with a smile and hello.  The hotel room was fabulous.  The Spa treatment was amazing.  Food was very good from breakfast to bar food.  A very relaxing and enjoyable stay and our sister really enjoyed her birthday.   Would highly recommend a stay in Druid's Glen.  ",5,2022,04,30
238,Excellent,"Very enjoyable. Staff very helpful. Druid’s Glen lived up to expectations. Don’t often get the opportunity to experience 5* luxury……this place has it all.. Not a golfer but ideal venue for visiting Wicklow hills and mountains

",5,2022,04,29
238,Visit spoilt by poor evening meals,Everything excellent except unfortunately evening menu and food quality.  It is a lovely hotel in a lovely area and staff are very pleasant and helpful.  Breakfast is excellent.   They really need to focus on quality of evening meals,2,2022,04,29
238,Short break with friends.,"Having stayed at Druids Glen a few years ago, I suggested to friends going there for a couple of nights.
Now having returned I would suggest we might well stay there again as our stay was extremely enjoyable. The staff were excellent in their approach to all of us. They were friendly, efficient and interested in how our break was going. Would recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2022,04,28
238,Very average stay,"Room was outdated, shower doors not closing properly causing a leak, spider webs at the ceiling, por check in experience/ little information, staff not too friendly, some sort of segregation at the bar – when asked for a table with a view we were given a table in a dark corner without a view, even though tables were available at the window, disappointing! Overall atmosphere in the hotel was not the best. The main advantage of the hotel is the location. Definitely the hospital does not represent value for money. ",3,2022,04,27
238,Not a 5 star,"Absolutely appalled by the standard of food in Hugo's restaurant. Photos shown on the website are clearly outdated from a bygone era and clearly are the rosettes, 30 euro for a monkfish I could have cooked at home with a fondant that looked like it was sitting under heat lights for the night. Nothing seasonal on the menu, desserts bought in, You'd be better to go somewhere else.",2,2022,04,26
238,Sister 50th bthday review,50th bthday celebration. Service terrible . No staff for breakfast room . Very unfriendly also n unhelpful . No interest in their customers. Phone in room not working .signage terrible for gym area n staff member didn’t know where it was or on what floor either.,1,2022,04,25
238,Disappointing rooms,"Interconnecting rooms , Bathroom had a sink leaking onto bathroom floor in one of the rooms, other room had only one bed, has to request another bed ( twice) to suit our family mix. Such details were provided on booking.",3,2022,04,25
238,Nice hotel but avoid Hugos.,"Hotel was lovely, pool facilities were good also. Would be super for families.
Hugos was a let down. Sent back both desserts - freezing cold creme brulee and a hard ish rubbery textured panna cotta. One starter and one main was lovely however the other left a lot to be desired. For the price, it was disappointing. The service was good though, our server couldn't have been nicer. Had lunch in the bar and it was delicious. 
Told we needed a booking in the bar anytime we went, that we would probably be asked for our table back,,,even though the bar was never full.
Breakfast was a bit chaotic, even though it wasn't full when we were there. The choice was good though.
We would go back but we wouldn't eat in the restaurant again. ",3,2022,04,24
238,Druids Glen Family trip,"It was very nice stay for our family, we loved the room, the pool, and the kids club.
The staff were all very friendly.
The ice cream on the kids menu (jelly and ice cream) was very nice. It's a very simple but brings out the flavours of the ingredients perfectly.
The breakfast sausages were really nice.",5,2022,04,23
238,5*+ as always,"We visited Druids over Easter for a family 2 night stay. We have been several times before and the consistency is unbelievable. 9 visits over the last 10 yrs or so and we have yet to experience any issues. From check in to check out is so perfect. The kids playroom is second to none. To sit in the Garden Room and relax with the view is an absolute pleasure. We had our 6yr old with us and the amount of things to do without leaving the grounds is fab. Lovely walks, little fairy village hidden away, the outdoor playground. Everything is top class. The staff are always friendly, rooms and hotel are so clean and the pool is brilliant too. The absolute value for money is unreal. ",5,2022,04,21
238,Nice location but disappointing dinner,"The dinner at Hugo's restaurant was overcrowded with screaming children and was disappointing as there was no ambience. The pool, spa and golf facilities were nice and the gym was well stocked with good equipment. ",3,2022,04,20
238,April break stay,"After nice time in pool and sauna,relaxing, peacfull dinner,i had best sleep ever.
Chowder for dinner...omg...love it!
And kids menue was very good too,if you have fussy eaters.
Choice of breakfas amazing!
As per kids...pancakes was better then grannys!
Lovely area,next time will be back in june,when it is a bit warmer,so we can enjoy outdoors too.",5,2022,04,18
238,Easter at Druids Glen,"This hotel did Easter very well. My kids really enjoyed the Easter trail with animals and Easter eggs at the end. We had booked kids club for the first night but they wanted to go back the second night again. Sinead & Sharon (running the club) were fabulous and my children had such fun, made friends and were very well looked after by the crew. 

I had a really lovely facial in the spa and consider the facilities generally to be excellent. 

Really enjoyed the weekend and will return again.",5,2022,04,17
238,Food poison,Before we had even got to our room.we spent 215 on it & 500 by end of night. We both myself and partner got food poison which wasn't handled correctly at all. We missed breakfast and had a whopping bill. Would never go again . The hotel did not accommodate us as we fell very ill and are still over 24 hours of eating the same meal.  We travel around all of Ireland as a family and have never had this experience . Do not recommend it Save yourself a small fortune.,1,2022,04,15
238,Super night away,"Had an amazing experience here, from start to finish. Beautiful surroundings, pleasant knowledgable staff, fantastic spa experience and excellent food. 
Couldn’t recommend Druids Glen Hotel & Golf resort highly enough. Can’t wait to go back.",5,2022,04,14
238,Very average not 5 star,"Felt this was an average hotel definitely not 5 star. The greeting going into the bar was unfriendly, no desert menu offered, no staff available to try and pay for the bill. Felt I could have gone somewhere else and got better service and for a fraction of the price. Definitely not worth a return ",3,2022,04,11
238,5* Experience,"Everything was amazing from start to finish. It was our first break away with our four month old twins and we dreaded it slightly thinking it was going to be a nightmare ( with babies of course ) They loved it. They loved the swimming Facilities, They were so calm for the two nights there. It made our experience so much better, We will definitely be back again.",5,2022,04,08
238,Family weekend break,"Functional but impersonal and lacked management . Shame as hotel had great assets. A lot of staff but no coordination. Some staff particularly friendly. Food nice bit not 5 star. Nice walks, well maintained gardens.",3,2022,04,04
238,Review from our stay 28th and 29th march 2022,Nice hotel and beautifull warm water in swimming pool.very clean. The spa was beautiful but was overcharged slightly and the staff member wouldn't accept this matter despite me explaining and my booking confirmation by email confirming same. That would put me off returning to the spa anyway .,3,2022,03,30
238,Excellent Hotel Service Provider in Ireland,One of the best hotels I stayed in and enjoyed my trip in Newtown Mount Kennedy. Staff are very helpful and foods are very delicious. I will recommend everyone to visit this hotel in life. I have plan to visit again next month. ,5,2022,03,30
238,Great stay - Recommended!,"Lovely hotel in beautiful setting and the staff were some of the best I've met. Spa was great and the food was excellent. Albeit quite expensive. Enjoyed the health suite/spa and the walks were lovley. 
",5,2022,03,28
238,Excellent staff and service. Beautiful grounds.,"Excellent professional staff and service. 
Beautiful grounds ideal for a family getaway and treat.  
Clean and modern pool facilities.
Plenty of free on site parking.
As much noise and quiet as you like.   ",4,2022,03,28
238,Friendly staff and excellent service,"I stayed here earlier this month and had nothing short of an exceptional experience. Staff were very friendly and great for a chat. Each staff member we spoke to had their own recommendations for activities and where to go on the grounds. 

Food in the bar and restaurant was delicious  and our servers were very attentive - couldn’t do enough for us! 

A very generous bonus was offered to us on the second day of our stay as we were upgraded to a suite after being informed of an issue in the double room we booked, staff were kind enough to transport our luggage from room to room. 

Overall it was a very memorable trip and would not hesitate to return at some point in the future.

-V. Keane",5,2022,03,27
238,Nice hotel but let down by restaurant,Hotel is lovely and spacious.  Lots of places to sit and relax.  Very comfortable large rooms.  Staff on check in were very helpful and helped us with out luggage without being asked.  Food in the bar and breakfast is lovely.  Only disappointment was the restaurant.  We were served cold potatoes and sent them back but the replacement dish was also cold and was served when we had finished our meal.  Staff were uninterested.  Pity because everything else was first class.  used the pool and spa and it was lovely.,4,2022,03,24
238,Excellent place to relax,"The staff is friendly and helpful! Hugo restaurant is super tasty! Pool is great, I appreciated the lanes for adult swimming.
Very nice walk around the property. The 
only minus is that hotel is not pet friendly ",5,2022,03,24
238,Lovely resort and staff with minor issues,"Great spot, lovely facilities, had a few issues that were resolved but could have been better or avoided altogether. Was just an unlucky stay in that respect but lovely otherwise. Staff were lovely and always had the right attitude ",4,2022,03,23
238,A hideaway of absolute comfort,Our stay at Druids Glen was so easy chilled and comfortable. The staff were always pleasant and willing to help. The food in the garden tooms was delicious and memorable. Lovely steam room sauna and plunge pool to be at least a little healthy !,5,2022,03,22
238,One night stay,"Excellent from start to finish sadly we only had one night this time but will be back soon we would highly recommend the hotel staff were excellent customer service at its best, room was very clean and food excellent thoroughly enjoyed the short time we had",5,2022,03,21
238,"Average hotel , lacks 5 star quality .","Dinner at Hugo restaurant was such a let down ... advise to eat in the bar instead better menu and better food better value. Leisure centre was very tired, staff uninterested in work. Rooms are spacious and clean. Staff were very friendly in most areas of the hotel. ",3,2022,03,21
238,Fantastic as always,"The hotel is situated in an amazing location. The staff is welcoming and gives the real 5 star service. Breakfast is definitely the highlight of the day, excellent quality. We love the pool and the relaxing atmosphere ",5,2022,03,21
238,Bank Holiday family break,"Enjoyed a fantastic few days with the family, although the hotel was full, the size of it gave a spacious feel throughout 
Staff, breakfast and pool facilties all super and overall a big thumbs up. 
I would strongly recommend visiting if in this part of the country 
",5,2022,03,20
238,Amazing 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟,"Simply amazing hotel. Stayed for 1 night in a suite. Would highly recommend. Yes it’s a bit pricey but it’s definitely worth it. Everything from the minute we walked in the door was amazing. Hotel is stunning. Room is very spacious with a separate reception/sitting room with a gas fire. Bed is one of the comfiest I have ever been in. Had dinner in Hugo’s and again it is absolutely top class. Spent some time in the bar afterwords and again it’s very well staffed and great atmosphere. 
The only 1 negative I would comment on is that you can’t just go into the bar for a drink without having booked, normal enough for the times we are in but you are told to take a seat in lobby and you can get drinks there. This is true but it is a very slow process with not enough (if any) staff there.  Only something small and definitely didn’t take from the experience. 
Beautiful 6k walk also available around the grounds. 
Will most definitely be Back.",5,2022,03,19
238,Can’t wait to return!!,My mother and I are currently staying here and I just couldn’t wait to write a review. It’s been fabulous. We were greeted upon check in by the most lovely girl called Tanya who couldn’t have been nicer! When she heard that I was in Wicklow for my wedding dress fitting she was super enthusiastic about my big day and even upgraded our room. It was so lovely and special and added a fab touch to our trip here. Our room was amazing and spacious. One of the best I’ve stayed in. It was a superior family room. This hotel is beautiful but most of all the staff make it outstanding. Everyone we met were so friendly and kind. We ate in Hugo’s tonight and our waiter was amazing. He made our experience even better. Our beds are super comfy and I can’t wait to come back here in the summer again. Fantastic stay here!! Highly recommend.,5,2022,03,19
238,Really good,"Very beautiful hotel , breathtaking location. Family room very well appointed and spotless clean. 
Only negative was bar food, we both had curry which was very much a let down. The food options for children were limited with no healthy options for children available. But I would still recommend the hotel",5,2022,03,15
238,Lovely hotel but evening food very poor,"Visited with wife  2 kids - hotel , lobby , rooms , staff all brilliant - top class - breakfast was really nice also -the big let down is evening food in bar/restaurant. Menu is very limited and the chicken jalfrezi had no chicken in it just vegetables - the chicken wings were dry - the burger was poor and the desserts highly over priced - you can always tell a kitchen is poor when ur order arrives within a minute - overall the hotel is lovely and relaxing - but the food , menu and price is not the food of even a 3 star hotel - I’ll go back k but will dine elsewhere.",4,2022,03,15
238,Family Break,"We visited Druids Glen recently with some family members and it was a really good experience
The facilities food etc were excellent but our most impressive memory was of the caring,efficient and HELPFUL staff
One young staff member even phoned his friend to get some information for my nine year old granddaughter about an Irish dancing competition .She was thrilled   A lovely memory. Thank you to
everyone

238,Fantastic stay brilliant stay every single one of you!!,"I had a wonderful stay here with my mum and sisters they upgraded us and treated like Queens. My mum and sister birthday chocolates in room, spotless the staff are beyond brilliant. Id be  very surprised to see a bad review. I'm coming back in October with my Hubby for our anniversary, its my new favourite place!!",5,2022,03,14
238,Very disappointed and appalled by staff behaviour,"As a paying guest and following a lunch in the Garden Rooms, to be told we can't sit in the bar unless we have a booking for lunch (again) was ridiculous. With most restrictions lifted and as a paying guest, the ability to have a simple drink in a hotel bar without a food booking is unconscionable.To also later find out non hotel guests were able to walk off the street and avail of the bar facilities was very disappointing.
The same fate awaited us when we tried to use the pool facilities and were told the pool had reached max capacity of 45 and we could either wait or come back later. 
While sitting in the pool waiting area, an argument ensued between 2 of the pool attendants (which I thought was play acting to start but soon realised it was quite the opposite) and I had to intervene before it escalated further. The language and malice shown was appalling and certainly not something I would have expected from a 5 star hotel.",2,2022,03,14
238,"Beautiful hotel, lovely staff. Highly recommended 5 ⭐️.",From the moment we arrived we were greeted with friendly smiles. All staff we had interactions with were so lovely and nothing was too much. The rooms were so clean & spacious. Food was excellent. I can't fault anything. We will definitely be back. Gorgeous walks around the hotel too.,5,2022,03,13
238,Fabulous,I recently booked a two night stay for my 79 year old mum and her partner.  She was so impressed and said it was the nicest Hotel she has stayed I'm.  Huge praise for the cleanliness of the hotel and for the  hotel rooms. Hugo's restaurant was fantastic and so was the food. And staff so kind . I would highly recommend this hotel,5,2022,03,11
238,Hotel experience,"This is a class hotel with a very warm and comfortable feeling on arrival staff are A1 and there's enough there for everyone kids included brilliant experience.
Golf and spa is tops and the grounds are stunning ",5,2022,03,07
238,Five star experience - highly recommend,"Firstly I have to praise the wonderful staff who were so friendly, helpful and fun. They really made our stay so enjoyable.
The food was exceptional, really well presented and absolutely delicious!
The hotel decor is beautiful and there was lots of space for groups. 
Fabulous spa experience and treatments were so relaxing. 
Highly recommend.",5,2022,03,06
238,Excellent !,"The area is beautiful, nature right at the doors of the hotel (sea sight, river walks). The staff is warmly welcoming, descrete and efficient. Braekfast is kingly and you are treated like in Starred restaurant. And of course the beds !! Sleeping on clouds of cotton ! Don't even hesistate, have a go!
Thank You",5,2022,03,05
238,Could do with  updating. Nice but not 5 star,"For a special occasion,  suite booked with afternoon tea and dinner.  It was OK but not the special factor I was hoping for giving the occasion.  Staff mostly lovely esp the girl serving us in Hugos restaurant. ",3,2022,03,03
238,Beautiful and relaxing,"Very relaxing beautiful views and lovely welcoming staff, I stayed here for my 40th birthday, the hotel sent a beautiful little box of chocolates and a card to my room very thoughtful, I would definitely return",5,2022,03,02
238,Top Class Service,"Beautiful hotel in a stunning location. First time staying & already planning our next visit as 1 night was not enough. The breakfast was 10/10! - lots of variety!
Your staff are fantastic - a big mention to CILLIAN working in the bar. If you want top class service, look no further - he went above & beyond. It was extremely busy in the bar, yet he made sure every table was seen to and spoke to each individual to make sure their meal was ok, & everyone was being looked after. I've never come across such fantastic hospitality, & I have worked in the business for a number of years. Keep up the good work :-)",5,2022,02,28
238,"Excellent Service , Great atmosphere","Excellent customer care and great food, staff very friendly. The room was very satisfactory and very clean on our arrival. The food in Hugos Bar was great for both Lunch and dinner and the bar staff were very efficient ",5,2022,02,28
238,Druids Glen,"I have stayed in Druids Glen numerous times and I can honestly say it is my favourite hotels in Ireland to visit. The reason I say this is from the minute I walk through the font doors  there is a beautiful non pretentious atmosphere .... The Reception  staff are always an absolute pleasure to deal with, nothing is to much trouble.

No matter what room I get I am never  disappointed as they are all beautifully finished to a very high standard .

Breakfast is a lovely relaxed experience that always sets you up well for the day . There is ample food and lots of staff to attend to your every need.

Overall I would highly recommend Druids Glen for a break away.",5,2022,02,27
238,"Excellent hotel, brilliant service.",We loved our stay in Druids Glen. Will definitely come back.  Thank you to all the staff in the hotel.  My daughter loved the pool and the staff were so kind to her.  The food was excellent. The Guinness was too!,5,2022,02,26
238,Nice hotel,"Rooms big & comfortable, everything you need. Bar menu is limited, let’s the hotel down. Didn’t use the spa as it was fully booked. Breakfast was nice, same as all hotel breakfasts. Nice walk around the hotel. ",4,2022,02,24
238,Great for families. Not so great for couples.,"It was our first visit since the summer of 2019, and it was lovely to be back for a rare kid free night away

We arrived to long queues at Reception. Thankfully it didn’t take too long to get checked in. Our room was lovely…. the beds here are so comfortable and I love the Elemis products in the bathroom. 

As always, breakfast and dinner in Hugo’s was delicious. 

There were a few disappointments. 

Firstly, we couldn’t have pre-dinner drinks in the bar as it was being used for dinner service. We had to have them in the Reception area with kids running all around us. I hope this is a temporary measure. 

Secondly the hotel is obviously marketing itself more at the family market. We will try to find somewhere more adult orientated in the future.",4,2022,02,23
238,D.OWENS,"Wonderful location, rooms are exceptional, Bar area was blissful & in general a great place to chill out & relax, ideal for family's playroom & swimming pool were clean & well maintained, the kids bath rob's are a special touch as well   ",5,2022,02,21
238,Relaxing and Refreshing Stay,"Stayed for a day/night at Druids Glen 17 February for a chillax before the weekend.  Staff exceptionally friendly and professional. Leisure facilities excellent.  Breakfast - lots of choice, even had gluten free muffins.  Definitely will stay here again. ",5,2022,02,20
238,Anniversary,What a fantastic hotel staff amazing could not do emough for us all had lovely smiles asking us were we ok brilliant breakfast beautifull organised no delays very clean  nothing was to much for them to help us well done and thank you all for our excellent stay,5,2022,02,18
238,Mediocre and far from 5 star,"A cold welcome at check in set the tone for our 2 night stay. No information given on any of the hotels facilities or surrounding area. Our room was generous in size with very comfortable beds and was mostly spotless except for a stain on the mattress protector. Shower ran hot and then cold when used. After leaving our bags we went to the bar to grab a quick bite to eat and a drink. Food quality was very poor and overpriced, cold, dry chicken burger, a sad ceaser salad but a great pint of Guinness and lovely staff. We decided to cancel our meal in Hugo’s on the following evening and eat elsewhere. 

All the little touches you’d expect from a 5 star hotel were missing, I was surprised we couldn’t have breakfast delivered to our room, as this is something we tend to do when staying at other good hotels.  Breakfast buffet had all the usual suspects, it was ok. We were left waiting to be seated for quite some time on our second morning and had to go look for a member of staff to seat us. 

A sad selection of old dvds at reception for guests to take to their room, I’m surprised that in this day in age smart TVs aren’t the standard with access to the usual streaming services, something we’ve enjoyed in many 4 star establishments. 

What really irked me was while I was getting dressed after a lovely swim and sauna there was a loud knock on the door and before I could answer it a member of concierge was in the room telling us to check out! I had the do not disturb sign outside the door which was completely ignored. A half apology was muttered from him. I asked at reception was there a mistake on our booking that would have led him to believe we had overstayed and again a frosty women said no. I did bring this up again at check out and a lovely woman took a note and said she’d bring it to the attention of the manager. 

I suppose the two awards dated from 2015 and 2011 at the front door are a sign that this hotel used to be great. Such a shame. 

Spend your money at a proper 5 star hotel.",2,2022,02,15
238,Poor customer service and awful food,"Awful check-in experience, the room was not ready and the staff at reception was quite rude and offered no information on the facilities or local amenities. The concierge insisted that we were not allowed to take our luggage to the bar while we waited for our room as the hotel wouldn't like how it looked. We were mortified by his rudeness as I had work related paperwork in my bag and was hesitant as he removed everything from us. On entering the bar there were plenty of people with their luggage also waiting on their rooms. The food in the bar was absolutely awful, we waited over 40 minutes for dinner that was tasteless and we struggled to get the attention of staff who were dealing with other complaints. The room was fine aside from the broken shower head and stain on the stool at the bottom of the bed. We didn't bother using the pool/gym. We were here years ago and really enjoyed the experience, i definitely won't be returning.",2,2022,02,14
238,Grandaughters 21st Birthday,"Stayed here for 2 nights 4th,5th February to celebrate my grand daughter's 21st Birthday from the outset i have to say staff in hotel were great. Food was lovely, service great. The manager was really great nothing was a problem he was really friendly, helpful, funny, my grandson had hurt his foot and was wearing a boot and he was in pain he gave him a stool so he could rest his foot, Saturday  the rugby match was on and he  joined in cheering and joking with everyone, Saturday night there  was music  in the bar singer was great had a great range of music to suit everyone great atmosphere. All of us enjoyed our stay.",5,2022,02,10
238,Perfect family trip,Whole family went for my mums 70th. Food & drink were fantastic.  Lovely rooms & decor thru-out.  SUPER attentive & friendly staff. Brilliantly catered to our groups dietary needs. The kids had an absolute ball in the pool. Will definitely go back. ,5,2022,02,08
238,First Class Hoel,"My wife and I stayed one night here. WE had dinner in the Garden Room abd the quality of the food was very high. Our room was spacious and very comfortable. The breakfast was also very good with a great choice of fresh fruit, juices as well as hot a nd cold food. All staff were very welcoming and eager to make sure we wre happy with everything.",5,2022,02,06
238,Not a 5 star hotel,Pleasant stay but not what we were expecting for a 5 star hotel with such great reviews. Our room was spacious with a modern bathroom however the bedding was not up to standards e.g pillows were extremely flat. We had dinner in Hugo’s restaurant which was average to say the least. The flavours just didn’t work. They also had run out of a particular dish that both myself and my friend wanted to order which I understand happens sometimes in restaurants. If you are staying in the hotel I would recommend going elsewhere for dinner. With the stunning Powerscourt Hotel only 20 minutes down the road I will definitely be making a reservation there instead on my return to Wicklow,2,2022,02,01
238,Lovely overnights break,"Had a lovely stay at Druids Glen with my daughter, we enjoyed lunch, dinner & breakfast, along with use of pool, sauna, steam room and jacuzzi. Good was great and so were the attentive staff.  Definitely recommend!",5,2022,01,31
238,Fabulous night away with Kids,Booked a fabulous deal on the Druids Glen Hotel website.  We had an amazing time at the pool with our kids and at the playground.  The food was excellent as well.  We thoroughly enjoyed every moment and arrived home relaxed and refreshed! ,5,2022,01,31
238,Excellent Stay,"My wife and I stayed here previously but this was our first hotel trip with our baby. 

We booked our dining times prior to arrival and we were advised that pool slots no longer needed to be pre-booked. 

Our room was on the second floor which was the same floor as the pool and the baby pantry which had a microwave for among other convenient items. The room was spacious and very clean. It had a small fridge which was handy for storing bottles. I requested a cot when I booked and reception arranged for a travel cot to be brought to our room. Our room was close to the lift and stairs which meant that were a lot of people passing by. I would request a room further away from there next time if we had our baby with us.

We ate lunch and dinner in the Garden Rooms which were both lovely. The pool was busy but we still had enough room. The staff in the hotel were so friendly and helpful. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.",5,2022,01,31
238,Overnight stay with a friend,"I have been to this hotel with my family twice before and decided to go with my friend.  Each time I go I am reminded of why I love this hotel so much.  The food, the staff, the rooms, the location. Everything is absolutely amazing.  I'm already planning my next trip.",5,2022,01,24
238,Super relaxing family breakaway!,"Extremely relaxing in a fabulous setting. Ideal with young children, really enjoyed their pool time. Family rooms also very spacious. Excellent breakfast. Very spacious hotel indoors and outdoors. Efficient service throughout our stay.",5,2022,01,24
238,This is a very special place,"We never get disappointed when we go there.Druids Glenn is a mix between nature, food, comfort and experiences. Highly recommended for couples, families, for anybody really! :) Staff is lovely and food is gorgeous.",5,2022,01,20
238,Beautiful hotel with amazing staff,"Beautiful hotel with amazing staff.  The hotel lobby area is fab, as are the bedrooms and bathrooms.  The room was really comfortable and warm.  Most of all the staff were amazing. They are all so friendly and helpful and they all made such an effort to chat to us over the weekend and nothing was too much trouble.  But especially Laura and Niamh who waited on our table on Friday and Saturday night and couldn’t do enough for us.  They were both amazing and so friendly.  Every member of staff was exceptional!
The reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is that it was more family orientated with lots of kids running around the reception area unsupervised which wasn’t the atmosphere we were looking for but is ideal for families.  Overall a lovely stay, thank you.",4,2022,01,19
238,Family friendly,"Enjoyable stay, excellent staff especially in bar Khristian deserves a mention. Room was outdated no smart tv & no channels. Missing few elements needed in a 5 star hotel such as valet parking bags to room 
Pool was busy swimming lessons on etc would recommend pool for families. 
 beautiful grounds",4,2022,01,16
238,Nice place. Recommended,"We went at a quiet time and enjoyed the place and facilities, especially the spa.
Good food, drink & service.
We had a few minor quibbles, but not worth mentioning. Lacked a je ne sais quoi for a 5 star.",4,2022,01,12
238,Couples retreat,Quick midweek break for the wife and I. Wonderful hotel with great facilities and brilliant service from the staff - it’s the “no request is too small/big” attitude that makes it 5star stay. Rooms are also huge!,5,2022,01,10
238,Great,Very friendly staff. So helpful . Food was amazing. Clean room. Pool attendents could be about friendlier but overall a great stay. Will return again for another stay. Games room a big hit as was the driving range and walk ,5,2022,01,10
238,Post Christmas Break With the Family,Had a lovely stay with my wife in kids in Druids Glen - the staff were all excellent and welcoming. The food was good particularly Hugo’s - had lunch in the bar one day and that was disappointing- hard bread and re heated bacon from the breakfast buffet in the sandwich. Room service was incredibly prompt and as I said before the staff were great. The kids loved the pool and driving range. The gym is very well equipped. So the down side for me was the room my wife and I had was rather tired- you can’t bandy the five star rating about and then fall down on the decor - examples were scratched tables - mini bar fridge that wouldn’t close - light in the wardrobe that didn’t go off and a large gap between the doors. None of this really impacted my stay but they don’t fit with a 5 star rating.,4,2022,01,08
238,Not a 5 star by any means,"Visited Druids Glen as a last minute end of Christmas break and I have to say we were underwhelmed by the experience in comparison to any other 5 star hotel we've stayed in over the last 2 years. Missing all the little touches you'd expect - A doorman, luggage taken at reception etc. The service in the bar both in the afternoon and post dinner when it was half empty was very poor despite there being plenty of staff and again the check out desk was being serviced by one single staff member at checkout time leading to a long wait and Q. The rooms were clean and the food in the restaurant was good but breakfast being a buffet at a 5 star hotel is unexpected. Location wise it's a handy little break but there are far superior 4 star hotels within a short drive of Dublin that focus more on service. In comparison to other 5 stars across the country Druids Glen is way off the mark. ",3,2022,01,06
238,Family bliss,We have just checked out from a wonderful two night stay. We were anxious going due to high Covid numbers but felt very comfortable and at ease in the hotel. All food was delicious. And all staff were so accommodating and friendly. Our kids did not want to leave.,5,2022,01,05
238,Thanks to your staff & management,"We arrived home this afternoon after a really great 2 night stay in Druids Glen. It was the 1st time we booked to stay in a hotel room & not opt for a hotel with self catering houses. We are really glad we did. 

We really want to say a special thanks to the managers and staff in the bar & restaurant who were so helpful and understanding of our sons allergies (sesame & peanut). They all made us feel comfortable and safe when ordering food, even cooking fresh breakfast for our 5 year old son so he didn’t have to use the buffet. This might seem like something small to people but to us it’s huge and allows us the chance to sit back & relax whilst giving our son a great experience of eating out. Each time we ordered food the staff checked with the chef and this type of communication is so important and appreciated by us. 

We will absolutely be back next Christmas. 

Thanks again",5,2022,01,03
238,Wonderful Xmas Stay.,My family stayed here for 3 days over Xmas. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Nothing was too much for them. The hotel itself was decorated beautifully and Santa visited and left present for our kids. Food was great. We are vegan and they catered well for us. My elderly mother was with us and they were really nice to her and made her feel at home. All in all we had a wonderful stay and look forward to going back.,5,2022,01,03
238,"Luxury hotel, fantastic staff & superb food","We spent 2 nights over New Year at the hotel and had a fabulous time. The food was superb in both Hugo’s and The Garden Bar. There was a huge array of breakfast options and the kids loved the homemade crepes and Nutella. The pool, sauna and jacuzzi were fantastic and spotlessly clean. The staff were really friendly and were always more than willing to help. Highly recommend the hotel and can’t wait to return again. ",5,2022,01,03
238,Fabulous hotel stay,"5 star hotel and service, friendly and helpful staff, lovely clean, modern bedrooms, great bar, lots of comfortable areas to eat and relax. Lots for children to do. Great spa facilities. We will be back! ",5,2021,12,31
238,First family holiday,"Just home after having the best few days in Druids Glen. The Christmas decorations were magical, our room was fantastic, the food was great, really couldn’t fault it. 

It was our first time away with our 14 month old so we really didn’t know what to expect. She slept extremely well in the travel cot provided and the baby pantry was great to have access to. She also had her first swim in the pool so we are taking home great memories with us.

The staff were just amazing, I can imagine they must have been under pressure given Covid levels and people out but it never showed. Everyone we came across was so helpful and really made our stay one to remember. On our last day 29/12 we had an issue with our access keys which Edel (I think!) at reception resolved for us promptly so we could go for a second swim before heading home.

We look forward to our next stay!",5,2021,12,29
238,"Disappointing experience, poor food!","Visited for a night before Christmas. Queued for 20mins to check in with just 1 person on the desk. Room was nice, spacious and clean. Dinner was a huge disaster. Plates constantly going to wrong tables. Returned my steak which was supposed to be rare but was well done(€42 for this steak). Panna Cotta was a gelatine blob which had zero taste, the waiter even said ‘yes I know it’s not nice but they won’t change it) The only silver lining was that all the staff were friendly. Wasn’t much of a Christmas atmosphere either, few lights and a messy gingerbread house and reindeer. Then queued another 15mins to check out. Supposed to be 5 star but is closer to a mediocre 4 star.",2,2021,12,26
238,Christmas wonderland ,"Stayed for Christmas eve and Christmas day. From moment of arrival the staff were incredibly helpful.  Greeted by Carol singers and mulled wine. Fireworks display that evening were magnificent.  Christmas morning,  santa arrived. Left presents outside the rooms with children.  Could even see his boot marks around the hotel !!!
Meals were superb and was the staff  , simply can't do enough for you.  And a special appreciation to Barbara,  whom at breakfast took such great care of us.
Overall   , a magical Christmas that neither one of us will ever forget.",5,2021,12,26
238,Lovely one night festive break in Druids!,"We enjoyed our family break in Druid’s Glen. The hotel was beautifully decorated … it felt so festive and cosy. The children loved the trees, reindeer and train in the lobby! All staff were so helpful and friendly and our family room was gorgeous and so spacious!  Would highly recommend!  ",5,2021,12,25
238,5 star everything,"This is our second stay at Druids Glen and we were impressed again. The hotel and rooms are spotless. The staff are really friendly and extremely attentive and well presented. The food was a real highlight of our stay, breakfast is excellent and dinner in Hugos is some of the best food I have eaten in a hotel. ",5,2021,12,23
238,Amazing hotel for families but food has deteriorated,Stayed here 4 times now and this was the only time I felt let down. Food was awful. Staff lovely hotel clean and child friendly. Amazing Christmas displays. Not sure how in such a short period the standard of food could drop so much,3,2021,12,20
238,Fantastic,Everything was outstanding. The only thing I wouldn’t recommend is the walking trail as there isn’t much to see and there are other beautiful walks in the area. The breakfast was the best I’ve ever had. The rooms are beautiful.,5,2021,12,19
238,Wonderful staff at druids,"We booked in at a advance payment deal for a Sunday night including food, breakfast and an upgraded room. The staff were wonderful, our package included the fine dining restaurant and they allowed us to have credit to eat in the garden rooms instead as we wished for a more casual experience.  The staff in the garden rooms restaurant were so nice and the food was delicious, the wings were the best we’ve ever had. The kind gentlemen at reception was very helpful when we were checking in and out and covered our anniversary treat that we had arranged to our room which was really appreciated. We didn’t use the pool facilities but had a look in and were impressed with it. We hadn’t had a breakfast buffet in quite sometime but we were actually very impressed with it, the selection of food on offer and the quality was very good. Another thing to note was their covid measures which was to a high standard, our passes were checked and they provided sanitiser around the building. The staff really make this place special, thank you for a wonderful stay.",5,2021,12,17
238,Druid's Glen dining disastrous during Covid,Poor quality control of Covid regulations in their dining area - packed out dining room  with staff wearing masks under their chins & noses - health and safety attention lacking. Have experienced better service at this hotel and dining area in pre-Covid but most disappointed to see a dining ambience ruined by poor maintenance to basic mask wearing by staff.,3,2021,12,17
238,Great,Almost perfect if it wasn’t for overcooked meat during dinner. Not a major drawback but a bit annoying when it’s a €30 dish… Kids loved borrowing DVD and the swimming pool. Shame the weather didn’t allow us to try the playground and enjoy the surroundings.,4,2021,12,13
238,Wonderful stay in the fantastic Druids Glen Hotel and Golf Resort.,"Fantastic facilities, beautiful surroundings, great food and friendly staff made this an amazing experience for us. Room was gorgeous and everything exceeded our expectations. We will be back for sure",5,2021,12,07
238,1 Night Stay,I recently stay in Druids Glen for 1 night.  What a wonderful experience from the moment we arrived. The front desk were so helpful on arrival and delivered our luggage to our room. The Front Office Manager Lukas that checked us in was  so helpful and welcoming. Nothing was too much trouble.  The room was beautiful and beds very comfortable.  I loved the food in Hugo's and the chocolate desert is to die for! The hotel was beautifully decorated for Christmas with cosy open fires. We really enjoyed our stay and will return for sure.,5,2021,12,07
238,Fabulous stay!,"We stayed for one night and from the moment we walked in, we felt relaxed. Wonderful atmosphere, lovely staff and delicious food. The grounds are beautiful and it had a lovely Christmas feel. Thank you! ",5,2021,12,07
238,Underwhelmed,"I’m not sure why this hotel has a 5 star rating, it’s 4 star at best. The service was average and food in Hugo’s was overpriced and of a very poor standard. Bar food was much nicer and a fraction of the price. Getting a drink in the bar was also problematic. We were directed to hotel foyer for a drink when we arrived which was disappointing. Overall I think this hotel was underwhelming and not at all what I expected.",3,2021,12,01
238,Not the full 5 star experience,"Was very excited to visit druids glen hotel as it is marketed very well. Staff were great, check in was fine, room was great except for the TV - small, far away from the bed and no smart TV capabilities.) Pool area was nice without being anything special. Bad dining experience, we were left on couches to eat our meal and have our drinks, fine for a quick drink but not for a few hours.",3,2021,12,01
238,Jamie Heffernan,"Everything from start to finish is exactly why this hotel is 5*. Friendly receptionists to check us in. Bar staff were very friendly and efficient. Spa was perfect and relaxing but the best part of our stay was the young woman who was serving us in the Garden Bar & Restaurant, she was the best waitress I have ever dealt with, unfortunately did not get her name but she was brilliant in every single way and a credit to the hotel. Thanks for an amazing stay. We will definitely be back! :) ",5,2021,11,29
238,Family Friendly Hotel,Lovely experience staying as a family on Saturday night. There was a lovely atmosphere upon arrival with beautiful Christmas Decorations up and a warm fire blazing. Check in was quick and efficient and friendly porter service to take our bags to our room. The room was a well appointed family room with robes for young and old!  The swimming pool was lovely and a good temperature for small children. The staff in the garden rooms were very friendly and the food was good.  There was a very nice relaxed atmosphere throughout. The children enjoyed choosing their DVD's for movie night and a play in the playground the following morning. There is a lovely walk around the grounds with bridges and brooks and a little fairy forest too. Ideal for a family night getaway.  ,4,2021,11,29
238,Baltic!!,Stayed for one night with friends. Hotel was freezing cold. Very uncomfortable in both dining and bar area. Bedroom also exceptionally cold. Slept with dressing gown on. Breakfast area next morning slightly better but still not comfortable enough to totally enjoy food. Shame because otherwise stay would have been lovely. Hotel very clean and staff lovely.,2,2021,11,28
238,One Night Family Stay,"We stayed as a family for 1 night. The hotel is lovely, staff are very friendly, the room was very comfortable and I loved the children’s toiletries in the room, and dressing gowns for kids. We ate in the Garden Room and really enjoyed it, great, warm service and the staff were especially nice to our 2 kids. It wasn’t our 1st time staying here and def won’t be our last.",5,2021,11,28
238,Couple from West of Ireland,"Fabulous hotel, beautiful stay. Staff were so very friendly, inviting and helpful. Hotel extremely clean. Lovely room, big, very warm and bed very comfortable. Beautiful breakfast. Grounds of the hotel so well kept, gorgeous scenery, fabulous walks from the hotel to golf club. Beautiful swimming pool also, including jacuzzi,  steam room, sauna, plunge pool. Would highly recommend.",5,2021,11,24
238,Amazing from start to finish,"Couldn’t fault a thing. Easy check in, amazing room.
Very clean and nice friendly staff. Couldn’t compliment our waiter enough in Hugo’s Restaurant, forgot his name, very efficient and I watched him all night moving from table to table, would love his energy. Amazing experience in the spa, I had a massage and it was the best treatment I’ve had ever. 
",5,2021,11,23
238,Lovely stay,"Lovely break at Druids Glen again, staff are very professional, food in Hugo’s was very good. Breakfast very well organised. Felt very safe with covid etc. Lots of hand sanitizer, everyone wearing masks. Will be back again. ",5,2021,11,22
238,Family stay,"Our stay was fine but slightly underwhelming. We chose this hotel as it always comes highly recommended online as a family friendly hotel. There is no children's swimming pool. Playroom has seen better days. The restaurant wasn't really too friendly with young children, we also had a bizarre comment about our credit card when asked for payment in the restaurant. The Garden Rooms is fine but seating arrangements are not always ideal for dining because the sofas and tables are a bit low. Food choice was alright but nothing special. I had difficulties when asking for a takeaway coffee that I could take to the playground. Little things that could be inproved. Children did enjoy themselves and overall it was a fine holiday but won't be coming back.",3,2021,11,22
238,Disappointing at bestmpl,Not my first time to visit not even my first visit during the pandemic but my first time to stay overnight! While I understand that there is no requirement to health pass check a hotel guest I would have expected a hotel of this rating to at least adhere to the guidelines of no buffet & ensure that all guests were considerate of others by ensuring that the minimum of covid measures were maintained.  Not so..this was very disappointing and even more so that the concierge was hoping for a “few days off” if hospitality was curtailed again! My expectations were higher but sadly I was left very disappointed & will not be in a rush to return,2,2021,11,21
238,Fantastic hotel,"Really enjoyed my stay here. Beds were very comfortable, room lovely and food fantastic. One minor complaint was that the Nespresso machine was blocked in the room which I forgot to mention to the staff but I wouldn't let that take away from a wonderful experience",5,2021,11,21
238,Beautiful grounds and walks,"We had a bowl of butternut quash soup with delicious brown brown. I did ask if it was possible to purchase a few loafs of this brown bread.  The waitress said she’d ask the chef but she never returned with an answer.
There were plenty of hand sanitisers around the hotel.
Breakfast delicious and very well organised and comfortable seating",4,2021,11,20
238,A wonderful prize to win,A minibreak with my daughter...sorry we couldn't have stayed longer...food was amazing...such a variety for breakfast...staff so friendly and helpful.....bedroom was the lap of luxury..enjoyed our massage too..thanks ,5,2021,11,17
238,Lovely relaxing stay,"Just back from our stay for our anniversary and husband's birthday and had a lovely relaxing stay. The staff were helpful and friendly, the food was great, the portobello mushroom burger delish! The grounds looked beautiful in autumnal colours. We were given a coplimentary bottle of procecco and the bed was incredibly comfortable, hard to leave and come back to reality.",5,2021,11,16
238,Super Hotel  - Great Service,My girlfriend and I went for our 2nd anniversary. We were given an upgrade to superior room upon arrival and a bottle of prosecco and personalised note from hotel arrived to our room to enjoy our stay and anniversary. Food and service was amazing. We will definitely be returning.,5,2021,11,16
238,Lovely couples weekend away,I couldn't fault our stay in Druid Glen one bit. From the great deal I got and the staff going above and beyond for us. It was my partners birthday last week and they had chocolates waiting in our room upon arrival and they also brought out a cake for my partner after our meal in Hugo's restaurant. I was honestly blown away by this as I would always have to ask and also pay extra for a small cake like this to be given to us. Honestly staff are fantastic and our overall stay exceeded our expectations ,5,2021,11,15
238,A quiet oasis,"Enjoy a walk, peace and the splendid view of the swans on golf course. Great food in bar and golf course. Spa treatment. Great comfortable bed and tranquil environment. Far enough away to destress but not too far away to enjoy a quick break. ",5,2021,11,14
238,Druids Glen 7/10,"Druids Glen is a lovely hotel, we stayed as a couple but it is also perfect for families, with family rooms containing small slippers and dressing gowns for children (adorable). The grounds offer a lovely 3km walk, fairy gardens and picnic area. Staff are all lovely,  friendly and helpful. 
The hotel  Spa was a disappointing experience. The relaxation room does not promote relaxation. The preparation room is an open adjoining room to the relaxation room allowing all the noises from this room to be clearly heard! There is no locker storage or showers/ proper facilities to change and shower before and after treatments. While my husband was playing golf I had planned to spend a few hours relaxing in the spa. This was not possible. Although the  treatment itself was lovely, the treatment bed was covered by a bed sheet which did not provide any comfort against the old hard breath hole which dug into my face throughout the treatment.  I would describe the spa as more of a treatment room set up not quite the spa experience as I was expecting. The food was very nice and seemed to cater for most food preferences - gluten free and vegetarian. It is worth mentioning that if you are eating in the bar the majority of seating and tables are coffee table height. If booking with older relatives make sure to request normal seating. Free bottled water and fruit station's were a lovely touch. ",4,2021,11,14
238,Family stay,"Excellent family hotel. 
Great facilities with loads to do. 
Friendly staff.
Excellent breakfast choices and kids menus. 
Clean rooms. 
Great 45 minute onsite running/walking trail. Top class pool and gym 
",4,2021,11,14
238,Beautiful spot,"Great few days at druids glen,food staff and very relaxed atmosphere just makes the stay unforgettable the food standard was excellent and the staff so friendly and talkative would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone",4,2021,11,13
238,Perfect,"Hands down one of the best weekends away we have ever had. They went above and beyond our entire stay. We aren't golfers and didn't bother availing of the spa treatments so cannot comment on those facilities unfortunately, however we spent 2 amazing days utterly relaxed and well fed and well watered.
The staff are a credit to the business, the best we have ever encountered. Honestly couldn't fault a single one.",5,2021,11,12
238,Midweek Break,Had a 3 night break with the wife and had a excellent stay . The staff were very friendly the hotel was very clean and the food was of great quality. The rooms were a great size very comfortable and the leisure facility was well run . With the past year living with Covid being very stressful the hotel provided a safe environment without your stay being inconvenient in anyway .,5,2021,11,11
238,Family break,"A beautiful hotel with very friendly staff.
Very relaxed atmosphere and nothing was too much trouble. Games room is great if travelling with children. Breakfast selection was very good. One negative is some menu prices quite expensive. ",4,2021,11,09
238,Luxury,"It's this simple, if you want luxury and want staff to cater for your every need, then druids Glen is the hotel for you. The staff are so friendly and helpful, the facilities are second to none and the food is out of this world. What a treat!!! ",5,2021,11,09
238,Great golf weekend,"We had a fantastic weekend at Druids Glen for an annual golf outing.  After not being able to play this event for over 2 years thanks to Covid, everyone was just so glad to be there.  The staff at Druids Glen could not have been more helpful or accommodating - nothing was a problem.  Special thanks to Shelley at Reservations, the bar staff and Corneliu, the night manager.  We had great fun and you were very patient with us and good humoured - it was much appreciated!",5,2021,11,08
238,Doesn’t even warrant 4 stars,"The most disappointing experience in a long time. The fact this hotel is regarded as a 5* is insulting to other 5* hotels, I would strongly argue it barely scrapes being called a 4* hotel. The staff are shockingly rude, particularly those at breakfast. I won’t name names. Complete lack of covid precautions in place. Not one member of staff checked our covid certs at any stage during our stay. We were so concerned regarding the lack of emphasis on following covid guidelines we actually cancelled our allocated pool slot.  The breakfast buffet was atrocious. After having the good fortune of staying in some truly incredible Irish hotels over the years, such as Ballyfin, Ashford Castle, Adare Manor etc, I strongly suggest avoiding this hotel.",1,2021,11,06
238,Birthday lunch for a special friend,"Today we had a delightful lunch in Hugo's where we were celebrating a friend's significant birthday.
The staff were most attentive and a special Thank You to Joey and Cillian who looked after our every need as well as the other staff members who served us.  A lovely touch was the surprise 'Happy Birthday' plate.
We would highly recommend this venue for the location, beautiful surroundings, social distancing consideration and excellent service. Thank you",5,2021,11,03
238,Halloween break with grandkids.,We have stayed in Druid's quite a few times and it never fails to please. Staff are both professional and friendly but never over the top. The grounds are well laid out and maintained with beautiful walks. Inside is lovely with plenty of comfortable seating both in the lobby and bar areas,5,2021,11,02
238,Another Fantastic Stay,4th time staying and it us our only hotel that we would never hesitate on booking. Again it was a first class service from very friendly staff to a very clean hotel. Food was delicious and a warm hotel. Room was very spacious and so much to do with children there. First time we visited we had no kids and family has grown since. Druids Glen has it all. Very hard to leave,5,2021,10,31
238,A very enjoyable break!,"My wife, young son and I stayed at Druids Glen this week.  We originally intended to stay for two nights but enjoyed our stay so much, we booked a third night.  The room and facilities were fantastic, there is a lovely play area for kids indoors and outdoors, the food was excellent and the staff were incredibly friendly and not just front of house staff, the housekeeping staff were so courteous each morning and often chatted to my son when walking through the corridors.  Nothing was an issue from any staff member.  We had our marriage reception in Druids Glen in 2012 and we have been back a number of times and sometimes just for a meal.  Each time, we are never disappointed.  We will definitely be back for our 10 year anniversary next June.  I firmly believe in giving credit where credit is due and the staff of Druids Glen deserve huge credit for the hospitality we received this week.",5,2021,10,30
238,Nice but way too expensive for what is is,"I booked this hotel originally for sep I changed date to oct I was informed that the same room was not available so I upgraded to another option 295 total for one night ! 
Upon arrival I was informed my original room was available now and upgraded room wasn’t 😅so therefore was thinking it was discounted to original price of 225 but the nice fella checking us in hadn’t a word of English and couldn’t understand my query 
I got a very basic room which would be a b+b 90s type room 
Still 295 I expected much better 
Pints are around 7 euro food is decent 
Pool and facilities are decent 
My recommendation would be that 295 for one night there is better places for these prices for few nights",2,2021,10,30
238,Nice experience,"Nice hotel, I would say its more of a 4 star experience, however all staff were lovely.  Bar food is a bit pricey as it is nothing fancy really.    

Another roll of toilet paper and another towel would have been nice. Only 2 large towels and 2 hand towels for 2 people.  If you have long hair like me a handtowel doesn't work.   The grounds are lovely. ",4,2021,10,30
238,Excellent family short break,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Druids Glen. The hotel facilities and delicious breakfast really enhanced our mini break. The location so close to historical Glendalough, Ireland’s highest waterfall at Powerscourt and the beautiful seaside village of Greystones meant we enjoyed a variety of day trips and returned to a luxurious and comfortable base. We would highly  recommend it. ",5,2021,10,27
238,Couples stay,Excellent food and service in the bar and restaurant. The spa treatments were very relaxing. The grounds are beautiful for a walk. The only downside is the rooms do not accommodate a family of 5 and you would have to book two separate rooms. ,5,2021,10,26
238,Family celebration,We celebrated my sons communion here after doing the same a few years ago for my daughter. It is an exceptional hotel for both adults and children the staff are friendly efficient and nothing is a problem for them. The food is exquisite and I think they are the comfiest beds we've slept in! Thank you and we will be back ,5,2021,10,25
238,Stayed 1 night,"We stayed for a wedding on a Friday night, we had a family room for me & my son, the ribs & slippers made arriving feel extra special. The beds were firm but all the feather pillows made it feel like sleeping on a cloud, I ordered room service which came quickly & the guys was so nice my son even committed on him. We got the kids fish in a light batter & it was delicious. The over all stay was fantastic & a real treat. I would love to stay again soon but it’s very pricey but night look into soon deals they may have 
Overall definitely stay if you can",5,2021,10,24
238,A “nice” stay,"Myself and my partner stayed for one night in Druids Glen. Overall I would describe the hotel as a nice 4 star hotel. We did not get the 5 star wow factor that we were expecting however for the price we paid (€280) we got what we paid for. 
Everything was “nice” and we had a lovely night. 
Our room was nice, clean and spacious with a lovely view of the golf course. 
The staff were all very pleasant however it was definitely under staffed and overall we found the service very slow. 
There was a great selection for breakfast however the self service area was filthy! The thongs for the fry were so covered in food and sauce that they could not be used and the counter top had not been cleaned which was off putting however the food was nice. 
We enjoyed a swim in the pool which was lovely and warm too. 
I would recommend to a friend however I would not get their hopes up for a 5 star experience! 
Enjoyable stay overall.",4,2021,10,23
238,Family of 4,"We booked two nights in October for our family of 4; husband and I and our 3.5 year old girls.
We stayed on the pigsback voucher so had to pay a supplement for a family room. We paid an extra €130 for a superior family room. Not sure it was worth the money as it was the same size configuration as the standard but with a vaulted ceiling and nespresso machine. The standard would have been only €30 extra.
Procecco and chocolate on arrival that evening.
We are in the bar two nights. Waiter was so nice, made a fuss of our girls and went out of his way to get us some vegetables (no vegetables for kids on the menu, apart from corn on the cob with one dish. Corn was frozen) He managed to get us peas and butternut squash and herb beans. Chips were frozen and very average as was the burger, steak and wings. The kids fish goijons were delicious! Top quality. The happy pear chana masala was delicious, so fresh and tasty. The naan was supermarket bought. 
Kids deserts were lovely. 
The second morning we hear a beeping noise coming from our door. I phoned reception who said it was the battery needing to be replaced and would send someone up to fix. We returned at 3pm that pm and were locked out with two small kids! Had to ring reception from my mobile and sat on the floor outside until someone came to fix.
Breakfast had nice parts; fresh fruit salmon etc.. lots of nice break/pastries and pancakes for the kids. The bacon and sausages were poor, pudding and veggie options were good.
Scrambled eggs had an odd texture and flavour. I ordered eggs benedict the second morning but must have been forgotten about. I had to ask again and by the time it came the other party members were finished theirs. 
Playground was good for kids, playroom not so good. Nothing really for small kids. No child for the chalk board. 
Artificial flowers in the toilets! Looked terrible and old fashioned, think they’re the same at reception. Nice pumpkin display at reception for the kids! Spa was lovely, had a very relaxing facial from Pam.
Pool was average, no kiddies section but nice and warm.
Coffee and babycinos were awful, cold and coffee was weak. Tasted like milk. I could have complained but the lady said they are free.
Would only stay of on pigsback! But a nice trip none the less, thank you.

238,Great hotel,Really enjoyed our stay On the most part staff were friendly and efficient Hotel very clean Spa really nice Great parking Room good size with very comfortable bed and choice of pillow Great size bathroom with shower and bath All the food we had was excellent The only thing I would say it would be great if hot food at breakfast was freshly prepared otherwise good We will be back Thank you to all the staff,5,2021,10,22
238,Fiadh's Greetings,"Really enjoyed relaxing few days, unfortunately because of our age and Covid, we didn't use the their excellent facilities such as the spa or pool, the food was excellent and the staff were extremely helpful and friendly ",5,2021,10,21
238,AMAZING,Amazing hotel! Staff are so so helpful and friendly. Food was fab in the garden rooms. Breakfast was fantastic a huge choice and so fresh. Rooms so clean and spacious. We walked the trail around the hotel and golf course and had lunch in Woodstock house and the food was Amazing there. Can’t recommend this hotel enough.,5,2021,10,21
238,A taste of luxury in beautiful surroundings,"Spent two nights in Druids Glen as we were celebrating a special occasion. We availed of the deal for 2 nights B&B with one dinner in Hugo's Restaurant. The hotel is set in magnificent surroundings which are particularly attractive in autumn. A wonderful display of colours. The foyer is very large and airy with cosy couches in abundance. Staff are very professional, friendly and well trained. They wore their masks at all times. I couldn't fault any of them. Our room was on the ground floor and looked out onto an enclosed green area. It was good to be able to open the large glass door for ventilation. The room was very spacious. We had two comfortable armchairs, a Super King size bed and a generous sized bathroom with both bath and shower. Robes and slippers were provided too. Rooms are well insulated. We heard no noise from any other rooms and there were plenty of guests around. Our meal in Hugo's was served with a high level of professionalism and friendliness. A lot of attention was paid to detail in the preparation of the food but I will admit that artisan food is a bit wasted on us and we don't choose it very often. We're just not into squiggles of sauce etc. The breakfast buffet was very elaborate and all that you could ask for was on offer. We particularly liked the pork sausages. 
We did the walk on the hotel grounds and got a chance to admire the  fabulous golf course (again wasted on us as we don't play golf), colourful autumn trees and water features as well as the historic clubhouse. A handy map was provided too to guide us on our way with 9 or 10 sites highlighted and relevant information printed on small notice boards at each location. An oasis of calm! We didn't avail of the spa as we are more interested in exploring the outdoors and the Wicklow countryside ... lots to choose from in Wicklow.

A few comments before concluding :
.... Although Covid Certs are not required for staying in hotels in Ireland I would have been more comfortable had they been required. The hotel was extremely busy, especially at breakfast time and there were many guests staying from all corners of our island and beyond. The hotel did nothing wrong, I just happen to think that certs should be required and I'm using this opportunity to express my views.

.... Our room was fab but .... a valance sheet on the base of the bed would have added that finishing touch to the room.

.... We reported an issue at reception about the shower dial (varied from warm to scalding to cold without touching it). I am glad to say that the report was very well received and I have no doubt that the matter will be addressed. 

.... Finally, a little teaser for staff and guests: Can u spot two spelling errors in Druids Glen? .... one is at the entrance to the breakfast area and the other is on one of the signs on the walking trail ... (wink emoji!)

....",4,2021,10,20
238,Tea less  Afternoon Tea,"Of serious concern is the lack of tea for afternoon also lack of clean cutlery in a Covid environment is something the hotel should be concerned about.  Service was good but the quality was poor and the price  was more appropriate for a higher standard offering.

I Won’t return and can’t recommend this.",1,2021,10,20
238,Trip,"Druids Glen was lovely to stay in. The room was generous in size. Breakfast served to the room is lovely. 
Having to reserve dining, swim times and breakfast all in advance is tedious for guests and staff alike (during Covid) but the system worked well. Staff were flexible to changes. ",4,2021,10,19
238,Amazing Overnight Stay,"Stayed for one night for my friends 50th and it was fantastic from start to finish.  The hotel and all its facilities are certainly 5 star.  The room we had overlooked the golf course with beautiful views.  They added little touches for my friends birthday and the staff really can't do enough for you.  We had a Spa treatment and it was the best treatment I have ever had.  We also used the pool facilities and the dinner was amazing in Hugo's restaurant that night.  Breakfast the next morning was top marks.  
Overall this is a fabulous hotel and I will most certainly be back for a longer stay next time.
Thank you Druids Glen.",5,2021,10,19
238,Excellent family experience,It was the perfect mini family holiday. Such a lovely hotel and excellent staff. We will definitely return. It was our 1st family holiday and it our toddler was made very welcome. The pool was so lovely ,5,2021,10,19
238,Great service from Cillian,Went out of his way to make sure we were looked after for our evening drinks and was great craic. Hotel was good but still very Covid centric which made just getting a table in the bar quite difficult.,5,2021,10,18
238,Couple weekend,The whole experience from start to finish was excellent . We enjoyed the golf course and had a couple of relaxing drinks afterwards. The chowder is a must . We both just relaxed for the whole weekend and nothing seemed to be a problem . ,5,2021,10,18
238,Our Wedding,"We had our wedding here in Druidsglen, 
We felt we Nessa in the lead up to the wedding and she was just incredible 

it was a two day event and it was amazing 
Ivan and the staff on duty that weekend were incredible we could not fault the food or service at all the food was excellent 
All of our guests commented on how amazing the venue food and service was 

We then stayed for a couple of days after we stayed in the presidential suite which gorgeous 
The buffet breakfast every morning did not fail it was delicious and we’re not usually ones for having breakfast we used the spa which was bliss 

It really is a fabulous hotel and we are so grateful to Ivan Nessa and the bar staff that were on duty for our wedding 
It was just an incredible weekend",5,2021,10,17
238,Lovely girls night away,Fantastic staff super responsive to an issue we had and to the night manager Joey who went above and beyond to leave us a little gift in our room. Loved the thoughtfulness of it. We had a beautiful walk around the trail in the morning and the lovely surroundings. ,5,2021,10,16
238,Absolutely faultless,"We had a suite (room 126) which was beautifully presented, as large as some apartments !  It had a lovely sitting room with fire, guest WC, and all the usual trimmings.  The bedroom had a French balcony, very comfortable bed, with high quality bedding.  Hotel was spotless, and staff were wonderful and welcoming.  The bar area is large, with lots of sofas, and two outdoor areas, one of which is covered.  Food in Hugo's Restaurant was superb, easily worth it's 2 Michelin Rosettes.  Excellent breakfast the following morning, with great selection from the buffet.  Overall standard reminded us of the Europe in Killarney, and that's saying something.  Absolute top marks.  Didn't golf, but went for lovely walk on trail around the course, which is spectacular. Looking forward to a longer stay next time.",5,2021,10,16
238,Family stay,"Thanks for a welcoming stay, already booked our next stay with ye. The food was amazing, the rooms were exceptional. Location is perfect, so close to everything but yet a nice distance away from the city. The dvds idea is brilliant in which we made good use of it. There's absolutely not one thing I could complain about. Thankyou",5,2021,10,15
238,Druids Glenn hotel feedback questionnaire,"Overall disappointing for €300 per night.
As we where at a wedding we didn’t want to rain on anyone’s parade but value for money was poor.breakfast was not warm.
No smithwicks on tap although there was a tap with Smithwicks advertised ",3,2021,10,12
238,A great family getaway,From check in to checking out and every interaction we had in between the staff are absolutely fantastic. The hotel pool was very well supervised and never overly busy as you need to book your swim time which is a great way to limit interaction in the current environment. The nature trail was a lovely way to unwind. We ate in the bar and restaurant each having a great selection and delicious food. My son was absolutely thrilled with his pizza insisting to have it both nights and in his words you’re the best hotel ever. I have one small critic I did find the hot breakfast selection cold but other items ordered from the kitchen came out  hot so it was isolated to the hot plate food only.,5,2021,10,12
238,Honest review,"Rooms are excellent, service was good, food in the Garden Room was very good with the exception of the chips, they use frozen chips which is pretty poor for a chef in a 5 star hotel. The quality of the toilet paper is not what I'd expect from a 5 star hotel either. The grounds are very well kept and the 3km walk is really nice with plenty of wildlife and views of the golf course.I also enjoyed the swimming pool which was never crowded during my visits there. Worth a visit although it is quite expensive. ",4,2021,10,11
238,Love Druids Glen,"Always a pleasure coming back to stay in Druids Glen. It’s so relaxing, the staff our wonderful and it is such a joy. Even in Covid times they have really managed things well and make clear the requirements. ",5,2021,10,10
238,"No drinks in bar, only in reception","Have stayed multiple times in hotel since it was built and in general love the place. However, during our recent stay we were told we could not have a drink in the bar and were directed to the reception area at 4pm in the afternoon. This situation drives me crazy as I like a drink at a bar. Whats the story? I assume revenue from food over rides the need to have a bar at all, it’s got to change.",5,2021,10,09
238,2nd Vitaflo  Live Life well weekend that Nicola & Joe attended,"We arrived early so ate some fruit in the car. We were warmly welcomed by the Vitaflo team and checked in with them. The yoga was on first so as Joe and I decided not to do that we sat at the back and had biscuits, muffins and coffee. We messed on our phones. The hotel is gorgeous and the rooms sublime. Most of the Pku food that we had was lovely but I didn’t like the rice pudding or Prozero milk! The Vitaflo staff including Chef Neil were very hospitable and the hotel staff helpful. All in all it was a very enjoyable weekend. The dietitians’ talks were good too.",5,2021,10,09
238,"Great hotel, great location but food disappointing","The hotel and facilities are excellent and the location is superb. The let down for us was the food. The cooked breakfast was very disappointing, not the quality expected from a 5 star hotel. The hot plate items were not as good as those found in 3 or 4 star accommodation. Also the vegetarian options in Hugo’s restaurant and the Garden rooms was very limited ",4,2021,10,09
238,Great hotel for family,Stayed in June with our two year old child. The staff at the hotel are very welcoming and attentive if you need any assistance. We had a really big room which was perfect for having a child sleep in the same room as you. There is a baby pantry we’re you can warm bottles and food. The food was really nice and we enjoyed the pool area. Would recommend for people with families.,5,2021,10,08
238,"Myself and three other guy stayed and played golf,hotel was brilliant had everything you would want food in the restaurant was l","We played druids Glen 2 times the course was in great condition also stayed at the hotel brilliant the spa was excellent in the evening we ate at the restaurant the four of us really enjoyed the meal it was beautiful can't wait to get back it's the kind of hotel that suits all couples,golfing groups it was 1st class I can't say anything negative about. ",5,2021,10,07
238,Fantastic break,A birthday treat in a beautiful hotel.  Was upgraded on arrival to a suite.  Service in all areas was excellent.  Food was delicious in restaurant and bar.  We really enjoyed the walk around the perimeter of the golf courses.  Thank you.,5,2021,10,06
238,Friendly staff,"Attended hotel for a family communion
Lovely staff very friendly and helpful. 
A lovely waitress Amelia waited on us in the lobby she was excellent and so helpful with whatever we needed. 
Great hotel for kids there’s a playroom very near lobby area and a huge playground outside",4,2021,10,04
238,Lovely family break,"Would most definitely recommend it for a family break. The hotel provides for both adults and children. The family rooms are a great size, extremely comfortable beds, robes and slippers for adults and children as well as toiletries for children.",5,2021,10,04
238,simple perfect hotel,"Everything is just right with this hotel: the service, the staff, the simple elegant rooms, the restaurant, the Garden Rooms and Bar (just not a fan of banquet seating or the low general seating - bit awkward for eating).   ",4,2021,10,03
238,Wedding stay,Very pleasant 3 day stay with all facilities to a very high standard. All staff very friendly and willing. Food was very good also. Would highly recommend Druids Glen to family and friends. Regards to everyone and looking forward to our next stay.,5,2021,09,28
238,Gorgeous stay at druids glen,Druids glen sparkled in the late September sunshine.  Service and dining excellent.  Pool area a little tired. Staff couldn't be more helpful. A lovely stay overall and highly recommended for a break away,4,2021,09,28
238,Family Wedding,Lovely hotel very clean. Friendly staff. Beautiful rooms with comfy bed and large bathroom. Delicious food and drink. Didnt use pool or book the spa so can't comment on these facilties.We recommend staying here. ,5,2021,09,27
238,Excellent hotel pity about the bar food again.,"Stayed here Wednesday and Thursday night just gone, for my partner’s birthday. Just wanted to relax and chill and not even have to leave the hotel if possible. 
We decided to eat in the bar on Wednesday night in the Garden rooms. Having been let down in this area previously we thought they may have upped their game. Unfortunately not. It’s either Cordon bleu fine dining in Hugo’s restaurant at exorbitant prices, or cheap and cheerful “typical” bar food that could be served in any average bar. There is no in between or a step up from the average bar food menu. If they could even offer an a la carte menu, it would be something better. We had to go out on our second evening to get food because of this. 
Apart from that little gripe, the hotel was clean and comfortable, although along the corridor leading to the leisure centre, was quite grubby looking. Cobwebs and spiders on the windows and the wallpaper and carpet have seen better days. 
Our room was spotless but had to ring housekeeping for pillow protectors, which I assumed would be a standard in all hotels nowadays, given the circumstances. 
We had breakfast to the room on both mornings and enjoyed it very much.",5,2021,09,26
238,Great hotel & location.,"Excellent hotel. Great for families with young children with the family pool, excellent outdoor play area and also games room. Hotel grounds are beautiful with lovely walks. Staff are excellent & very helpful. Food and drink is top notch. Keep up the great work all at Druids Glen.

238,DAVID AND ZARA,"Staff and location excellent ,however quality of the meat very disappointing. Extremely  difficult to book 
treatments at the spa resort .The staff are very friendly and willing to help .Would be prepared to return if the manager would eventually return my call to discuss our concerns",3,2021,09,21
238,"Attentive staff, fantastic for business meeting","I stayed in Druids Glen recently for a business meeting. We booked 2 bedrooms for the night before and the boardroom for our meeting. We were upgraded to suites which were HUGE and fabulous. Well appointed with coffee machine and bath bombs in the bathrooms which was a lovely touch.
The staff were all very friendly and so attentive. Dinner in the Garden Room restaurant was excellent and again we were very well taken care of.
Special mention to Pawel who took care of us in the boardroom with teas, coffees and pastries during our meeting. He was so professional and friendly. Nothing too much trouble. 
Highly recommend this hotel and look forward to visiting again in the future.",5,2021,09,21
238,Beautiful and well worth a visit.,Fab hotel and very friendly staff and the weather was fabulous we really enjoyed our trip and we have been there several times before and hopefully will be back. The golf course was amazing unfortunately we did not have time to go to the health club but next time thank you,5,2021,09,21
238,Fabulous hotel resort,"Absolutely love this hotel, always a nice relaxing stay and the staff go above and beyond to meet the needs of their guests.  The location is perfect with lovely grounds surrounding the area for walking.  Food is fantastic, rooms so comfortable, always enjoy our stays here.",5,2021,09,20
238,"Highly recommend Druids Glen , beautiful & spotless","Friendly, professional, attentive , knowledge of amenities in every department , spotless hotel and great value for money. Well done! Clearly management have a great attention to detail & training of staff at reception was nice to see as he did a great job checking us out on Friday morning . ",5,2021,09,18
238,Great for young families.,"3 night mid week stay with my wife and 1 and 3 year old boys. The hotel is ideal for young families and the staff were very friendly and helpful with our needs. 

6km walking trail and indoor and outdoor play areas means that there's plenty to do. The staff were great at meeting our unusual requests, e.g. a banana for kids dessert at the bar.",5,2021,09,18
238,Absolutely disgraceful food,"I was very hesitant on writing this review as some aspects of our stay were absolutely amazing such as the hotel itself and what it offers as a whole and the staff we personally came across looked after us extremely well and we’re so polite and efficient in their work from the concierge to check in and servers etc but unfortunately our stay was completely ruined due to the dining experience and most definitely not the fault of our amazing servers. Without going into to much detail we brought it to the attention of server that we weren’t happy with our food in Hugo’s restaurant within a couple of minutes of it been served, it was bland, tasteless and slightly cold also for a supposed 2 rosette restaurant the plates had finger prints and flecks of dirt on the plate which was noticeable from the offset as they are white plates. Our server took our plates and got us fresh meals which came within 2 minutes of him leaving but served from another server which just proved to ourselves that the chef didn’t want to put any care or thought into our plate or even the complaint. When I asked would it be possible to speak with either the head or executive chef I was told the executive chef had given a response a minute later from our server, her exact words were ‘I’m extremely sorry but our executive chef said he does not believe your criticism to be true that the food was good and seasoned perfectly and that it’s just not to your tasting and he would not be willing to discuss it further’ we could not believe what we had heard so just paid for our drinks and left. 

After doing some further digging the executive chef Neal has a reputation within the industry for his ‘Gordon Ramsay’ style of treatment on both servers and chefs as I work for a recruitment agency and many places are hesitant to pass on work for chefs within a kitchen brigade he is over and I can most definitely see why.

EDIT FOR GENERAL MANAGER: Since you reported me for writing a review on my honest stay and I also reported yours as it was disgraceful and unprofessional reply I will say I have a complete right to rate whatever I want and your executive chef absolutely ruined our night i we rated accordingly. Since you were so upset about this I gave you an extra star to please you. I made absolutely no assumptions on how the kitchen is ran and I’m sure you can go read the review again and I mentioned it was several industry based persons who have experienced this attitude from the executive chef and I just so happened to experience it myself. Thanks Aidan, yours thankfully, Conor.",2,2021,09,18
238,Excellent Hotel,"Overall we really enjoyed our stay at the Druids Glen.  Excellent location. Beautiful scenery.  Fabulous foyer really welcoming comfortable sofas.
Loved our stay there will definitely recommend it to family and friends.
",4,2021,09,17
238,2 night stay,"Have stayed at Druids Glen  before and was disappointed by aspects on this occasion.
Lovely setting and great location to visit Wicklow but breakfast was very disappointing 
Our waitress  was very friendly",3,2021,09,15
238,"Fantastic hotel, with great food and service","Druids Glen is a beautiful hotel in a peaceful setting, and close to many other attractions, small villages, parks and gardens.   The food and service are exceptional. Covid mitigations are also being taken seriously. It felt like a very safe environment for our stay. I have stayed serval times and have no hesitation in recommending.",5,2021,09,13
238,World Class Hotel & Service,"I booked Druids Glen for a three day work conference, from the first contact right through to our departure, Damien in Conference & Events could not do enough for us, the service from all staff is indeed world class.  The hotel is fabulous, the food is phenomenal and the service just makes it all the better.  Everyone at the conference was blown away and I know we will be back in both a personal and business capacity.  Thank you all again. ",5,2021,09,13
238,Anniversary stay,Fantastic service from start to finish. Beautiful hotel in a lovely location. Staff all extremely friendly and helpful. It is the second time we have stayed here and will definitely come back for another stay.,5,2021,09,10
238,We've 'Scene' it all!!,"On Tuesday and Wednesday, twenty of us came down to play golf and stay in the hotel. from the outset we were warmly welcomed and treated like Kings. Nothing was too much trouble. The Course is stupendous, with absolutely stunning views - a true jewel in beautiful countryside. We then went to the Hotel. It is luxurious. Beautifully furnished and sumptuously presented. The main, outstanding feature was the Staff. They were supremely well trained, most attentive yet not obtrusive. The bedroom is huge and we were lucky to overlook the Thirteenth Hole on the Glen course- the signature hole. Last and by no means least, we had a three  course meal, as part of the deal. this was outstanding cuisine, from start to finish. Furthermore the wine list whilst not extensive provided real value for money. This is an outstanding hotel. it is worth a visit. I will be back.",5,2021,09,09
238,Fabulous Stay,"Brought my parents here for their 51st wedding anniversary.  It was their first break away since COVID started, restrictions and social distancing were handled very well by the hotel staff which put my parents at ease.   From beginning to end our stay was so relaxing and enjoyable.  The staff were very friendly and attentive, the rooms were beautiful and spotless and the grounds are absolutely stunning.  I can not speak highly enough of this hotel definitely worthy of its 5 star rating.",5,2021,09,09
238,Luxurious!!,"Everything about the resort represents 'luxury'. We visited the resort for a wedding reception. The food, staff friendliness, and service were excellent. No complaints whatsoever. Would definitely recommend ",5,2021,09,06
238,We will bring our Apple TV next time!,"Gorgeous hotel, great staff and facilities but the tv situation is dreadful. Some of us come for the peace and comfort of staying in our luxurious rooms. Get an upgrade or at least provide a HDMI cable so we can plug our phone in and watch Netflix or Apple TV. ",5,2021,09,05
238,Short Covid Break,"Hotel managing the Covid restrictions very well, felt comfortable all the time we were in the building, good to get a break away even if only for a few days. Staff very welcoming & friendly, will definitely return soon",4,2021,09,04
238,Nope,"Service was equivalent to a service station in the West of Ireland in 1970s. The breakfast route is a covid dream its a lottery if you get toast and tea or nothing at all. The 'walk' is a deathtrap, barbed wire and ramshackle buildings all within 5m of the path are a parents worst nightmare. 
THIS IS NOT A 5 STAR, NOT A 4 STAR, ITS A DECENT 3 STAR.",2,2021,09,03
238,A Wonderful Retreat,"The Druid's Glen is an unmissable spot for anyone looking for a genuine retreat. A beautiful restaurant, spa, pool and bar make for a wonderful break. The staff is extremely helpful. The rooms are lovely and the beds extremely comfortable. They are very welcoming to families and small children in particular but the place remains calm and comfortable for all guests. ",5,2021,09,03
238,Returning guest,Our favourite hotel staff are fantastic food excellent attention to detail but just so relaxing. We have been going here for almost 20 years and never ever had anything but a lovely relaxing time. The staff contribute largely to this thank u,5,2021,09,01
238,Nice hotel,"We have just returned from a long weekend at this hotel. Overall the hotel was nice, very clean and the majority of staff were very friendly. Although very busy the hotel had a relaxing feel about it and we enjoyed our family break. The one thing I would say is that the hotel lacked something in comparison to other five star hotels I have been in - the external appearance did not have a five star appeal, the food was nice but not five star quality and the bar area lacked any type of ambiance. We ate in the bar and had breakfast. The food was nice but not excellent and not the quality you would expect from this hotel. Breakfast had a good range of choices but was very similar quality to what you would get in a three star hotel. The lobby area was very nice and a relaxing area to enjoy a drink. Overall we had a nice break and don’t have any specific complaints about our stay however the hotel would need to consider what it offers and how it could improve its offering to ensure it is five star. I would return again in the future but will be expecting a five star experience particularly in terms of the food.",4,2021,08,31
238,Couple's Getaway,"Lovely stay overall. A few shortcomings which took away. Noisy guests woke us up for prolonged period of time and the relaxation room in the spa was anything but relaxing, a little more grand central station with staff passing in and out and general feel. Food really good in the bar and for breakfast.",4,2021,08,30
238,Disappointing and not a 5 star experience,"We had many issues during our stay, some of which we reported and some we didn’t as it became a running joke with us given the amount of things wrong.
From the state of the bathroom in the lobby to the poor service and quality of food in the dining room, overall the experience wasn’t as we expected.  The spa therapist was amazing however the relaxation area was like a thoroughfare. Our room wasn’t serviced once on our 2 night stay, even though I specifically requested it. I appreciate that Covid had played a part in the operations and that there may be staffing issues but that didn’t seem to be the problem here, although I’m not sure what was. ",3,2021,08,28
238,Escape in Wicklow,One of the best places to relax & feel special. Superb customer service in the best of surroundings. Dinner in Hugo's a must. Hotel staff can not do enough for you. You will know the customer service ambassadors when you meet them & you certainly will not forget them or them you for your definite return visit.,5,2021,08,27
238,Magnificant Minimoon,"Cannot describe fairly how brilliant the Druids Glen is  from our first arrival we were treated excellently. The staff are one of the friendliest group of hotel employees we ever experienced and do their jobs brilliantly. On arrival we were treated to an upgrade room. Stayed in room 425. It is fantastic. After going for dinner on our first night came back to the room to find a congratulations letter and a box of butlers chocolates. 

Food was excellent both nights. But in particular the 3 course meal in the restaurant was outstanding. 

Druids Glen is a must and we will definitely be back. ",5,2021,08,25
238,overnight stay,"We decided to have a get away night for me and my husband and decided to go to Druids Glen because of location and we did use their day spa before. From checking in, restaurant and hotel shuttle all staff that had dealt with us are very helpful.",5,2021,08,24
238,Struggling to maintain 5*,"Future guests, for upcoming stays please ensure to request your room is refreshed otherwise this will not happen due to covid processes internally.

We stayed over a weekend, very spacious room with baby cot provided (very good child cot). Bed and room facilities were excellent.
When I’m bathroom I noticed the shower gel was half empty which was not satisfactory.  Spoke to reception and this was replaced immediately though in a 5* hotel you’d expect better and given covid they should be replaced as standard even if u used.

First meal in garden room, staff placed us on main thoroughfare of food from kitchen with high chair on this thoroughfare.  Requested to be moved which was accommodated.  Had ordered chips for baby to nibble on prior to us ordering and once at new table asked waitress if these were already ordered or not with response of ‘maybe, I don’t know’.  Seat positioning and attitude simply in my opinion down to inexperienced staff.

Wife had cod which was superb with lovely garnish (potentially too much fennel) 
I had jalfrezi which was flavoursome but no spice (though catering for the general population it generally needs to be like this).

Second night wife had battled fish and chips which was rated as very good.  I ordered rib eye which had large amounts of gristle/tendon throughout and made the meal inedible (I am not a fussy eater and got to the point where chewing the gristle made me feel queasy).  Thankfully manager (Joey) removed this from the bill and was very pleasant to deal with.

A special mention to Peter (concierge at check in who was thoroughly helpful and genuinely interested in our plans with advice on suitable local places of interest).
Barbara at breakfast was professional but very engaging with an extremely pleasant disposition.
Elsa & Krisztian in the bar were extremely good (Elsa only working there 3 months but was attentive and helpful), Krisztian was clearly an experienced waiter who constantly entertained our child and chatted to us throughout the evening (but not overly so).

All in all an enjoyable stay though the steak has left a poor memory.  Staff were pleasant and courteous at all times but not to the standard of previous stays",4,2021,08,24
238,Disappointing stay at Druids Glen,"Our stay at Druids Glen was most disappointing. We stayed in a suite where I found a shirt belong to the previous guest in a drawer, the carpet was extremely dirty & stained especially outside the bathroom door. The dining staff in the breakfast room & Hugo's restaurant need staff training, it was obvious that no staff training had taken place in these departments. The waitress told us she was not able to uncork our bottle of wine!! During our time in the restaurant 4 meals went back to the kitchen with problems, On the good side the Garden Bar was fabulous & the staff there were wonderful. This hotel certainly in my opinion is not 5 star standard. Overall very disappointing. ",3,2021,08,23
238,Staycation Success,2nd time visiting and needed to leave a review just to say thank you to the resort for making our only holiday this year extra special.  Firstly a thank you to Karen first for all the arranging and Co ordination of meal bookings and swim times everything worked out perfectly. A huge huge shout out to Adrienne and Marc on the front desk for going out of their way on check in. Adrienne in particular is a credit to the team and clearly loves her job. We spent 4 nights here and easily could have stayed another week. The food and service in the Garden rooms were superb. Breakfast choices were great and the staff couldn't do enough for you.  Great to see the leisure centre fully open and my wife really enjoyed her spa treatments.  ,5,2021,08,21
238,Family holiday,"We stayed in Druids Glen recently and we were so excited as we had hear so much about the hotel. As a five star establishment I had big expectations. I have worked in restaurants  and hotels for twenty years in this country and I was very disappointed with the hotel. I believe that a five star hotel in Ireland sets itself apart by its warm welcome, excellent food and beverage operations, top class facilities and  most of all the attention to detail. I feel the hotel let itself down on some of these points. 

On arrival we parked at the door and the young porter was standing inside the door of the hotel. I continue to unpack the car and he stood. By the time I got to the reception he was gone and the receptionist brought our bags up. Unfortunatly first impressions are so important. So much for the warm welcome in Ireland.

I have to say the hotel is beautiful and the facilities are excellent. Our room was very spacious and we had everything we needed.  The leisure facilities and gym are brilliant and this an excellent place to relax. 

I was really looking forward to breakfast most of all. I have stayed in so many 4 and 5 star hotels in Ireland and the best hotels serve an excellent breakfast. I was always told in this trade that breakfast is the last meal that your guest will have and an amazing breakfast will leave an everlasting impression on your guest. Unfortunately this is where Druids Glen really let's itself down. While other top hotels offer cooking stations where chefs are preparing everything from omelette to crepes, all to meet the individual requiremnets of a guest in a 5 star hotel, this hotel offer the same standard buffet you will find in any 3 or 4 star hotel across the country. On our first morning we were shown to our table and the process of service was explained to us. We were told that staff would bring us juice, toast and tea and coffee. We waited for a while ten had to ask for juice to be brought. We went to get our cereal then had to ask for milk for the table. We then had to ask for tea, coffee and toast. I went to lift the salt on our table to find it was empty and the plug under it was missing. This may appear petty but the same thing happened the following day and on the third day the salt was filled with rock salt and we had to open the plug to get any out. I went for my cooked breakfast and I was surprised to find the now common deep fried Sausages. The eggs being served were all poached and I asked for soft eggs and the chef serving me told me ""no they are all medium"". My breakfast was fine but nothing special. If we required any sauces, juices etc we had to ask for it. At no poi t did anyone ask us if we required anything.  During breakfast there were at least three supervisors working on any morning and they were constantly bringing peoe to tables and setting tables. There was no supervisor actually supervisor the restaurants and checking that their guests were happy. I am sure some people reading this will remember the day in any Idsoh hotel when a waitress, manager or anyone from the hotel would go around and actually ask if customers were happy or how their day was going. This doesn't happen in the Druids Glen as breakfast appears to be more of a production line with little attention to detail. 

Saying all that I must comment on an Indian waiter called Savio. Who served us on our last morning. This man has obviously been trained in a fine establishment and provided a most attentive service and restored some of my faith in the 5 star status of Druids Glen. Savio was able to.provide our juice, toast and coffee without asking. Cleared our cereals bowls promptly where on other mornings we had to ask for them to be cleared. He also took the time to talk to us and ask about our day which was very gracious. Savio received a tip from us and he definitely could be used o train most of the other breakfast star that work here. 

Another thing we were looking forward to was our dinner in the Dduids Glen 2 AA rosette restaurant. Again I had big expectations which were not met. Thankfully we were being taken care of by a lovely foreign waitress who, like Savio, was polite and very efficient and attentive. The food unfortunately was not as good as expected. I had the gin marinated salmon which was nice but although the garnish was beautiful and well presented the flavour of the salmon was not very distinct and with the bloodline still on the flesh it was quite firm to cut. My wife has the crab and she thoroughly enjoyed it. My daughter was on the kids menu and se ordered dough balls but get small bread rolls that were too hard to even bite into. We told out waitress, as they were not eaten, but they still appeared on our bill. My wife order a fillet of beef for main course medium rare but it came out medium towels with no pink at all. At €35 for this dish it was not good enough. I ordered the lamb shoulder served with a lamb croquettes. Unfortunately the lamb was over cooked and quite dry. The croquettes had big lumps of the same dry lamb with very little potato so this croquettes was not very edible.  Once again there was no supervision in the restaurant once we were brought to our table so no one ever asked us about our meal and we didn't have any sweets or tea/coffee . The bill was still £175. 

I hope you can see why I was disappointed here. In many fine hotels in this country there are managers who are floating around, supervising their teams and making sure the guests are happy and enjoying their holidays. This doesn't happen at Druids Glen! I can only finish this review by saying that as I was leaving I was carrying my bags down to reception and when I got to the top of the stairs I passed three suited male managers and not one of them could ask if I needed a hand or even bid me a good morning. 

I have read other reviews and I see most people love this place and that's great but if you are really into a five star experience with exceptional food quite and top service then there are much better options in our country.",3,2021,08,21
238,Great Place,Fantastic hotel and the rooms (the superior ones) wete absolutely fantastic.. The Glen course is a nice course and easily acceptable for any calibre of golfer ' The heath course is undergoing extensive upgrading but its still you'd want to play if your staying here ' menu is a little light on choice in both the bar and restaurant but food is quality and the food staff were always attentive and helpful ' the only thing I'd say is as we were golfing at 1pm we arrived at the hotel around midday and asked for an early check-in which we were told wasn't available so we had to change in the toilets for golf and as were were leaving to play we see  guests that arrived after us getting checked in and going upstairs...,5,2021,08,20
238,Mini break,"Family get away , super location and lots todo in the resort  from gym , swim , golf range , walks lovely welcoming atmosphere , staff all very helpful , lovely outside sitting area on a sunny day or sheltered area for drinks and food , will be going back again super value for a mini break ",5,2021,08,20
238,Never fails to impress,"We have been here several times and have always loved it. Rooms are spacious, beds so comfortable and facilities excellent. The hotel is spotless and felt very safe and Covid compliant. Staff were very friendly.
The food was exceptional. We ate in the bar, restaurant and breakfast the next morning. My only grievance is the wine list which could do with some work to elevate it to level of food. 
We will be back for sure.",5,2021,08,20
238,Amazing experience!!!!,"My boyfriend and I had recently spent a weekend and the Druids Glen hotel. From the start to finish it has been the most amazing experience. The room was huge and gorgeous, the bed was super comfortable and the view was breathtaking!!!
I have the mention the dinner at the Hugo’s restaurant, this in particular was the most amazing experience, the food was second to none, the service was incredible  and we would definitely go back to the druids even for this part alone. kudos to the chef!!! Thank you so much! And  despite COVID times we felt super safe.",5,2021,08,18
238,Disappointed with our 1st stay at Druids Glen Hotel and Spa Wicklow.,"We had a 2 night stay here in August 2021, it was our first visit to the hotel so we where very excited to go. First night we had dinner in The Garden Room and my husband ordered starter and my daughter had her dinner with him, they arrived out with our mains along with starters, so they where sent back and when they did come back 1 of the mains were  wrong, but in saying that it was lovely, We had late slots for breakfast because everything booked up quickly, So the hot breakfast was good but very little breads, cereals and pastries left and I asked could I get more and the waitress said that’s all that’s left, no soya milk either,not busy at our breakfast slots but took ages to get tea/coffee/toast aswell,  personally I think everything should be topped up or enough of everything until breakfast is over no matter what time it’s at.I think with the amount of children at this hotel they could of done with a children’s pool.My daughter cried for 2 nights going to sleep because the pillows where soo soft, she’s only 4 yrs.The  coffee machine wasn’t working in our room and they did have kettle but no coffee sachets to make it with the kettle, also we left a charger and I rang the next day about it and they where to check with house keeping and get back to me but nothing as yet 4/5 days later, the hotel was extremely  clean,and rooms are good and spacious ,they had a great park for kids and most of the staff very friendly but overall for the price we are disappointed in our stay and I mean we certainly paid enough to stay.For a 5 star hotel I wouldn’t expect these things to happen.",3,2021,08,18
238,Amazing family staycation,"We stayed 13th to 16th August. They staff are exceptional here, very helpful and friendly. Rooms spotless, public areas maintained to a very high standard. The food was delicious in both Hugo and the Garden Rooms (new chef in the Garden Rooms). Service was excellent. Both our daughters loved it here and did not want to leave. We invited another family to join us and they had the same experience. Cannot recommend this hotel enough, we will be back again for sure.",5,2021,08,17
238,nice stay,"This is a nice hotel. Not five star. Food in bar not great at all.Staff seemed to be so busy and so no time to really engage with visitors. Room was very nice and big. Felt breakfast was overcrowded, not very comfortable.Vaccine passport not checked anywhere. ",3,2021,08,17
238,Lovely hotel with exceptional service,"We had a fantastic stay at Druids Glen. Coming from the United States, we were a little worried about all of the COVID protocols in Ireland but the front desk staff, esp. Kristian and Adrienne, were very welcoming and completely reassuring and put us at ease. They set us up with swimming pool, dinner and spa reservations and even followed up multiple times when our plans changed to make sure appointments were rescheduled. 
 
The rooms were clean and very well appointed and we especially loved the nice surprise of a beautifully crafted woodland dessert to welcome us! The hotel grounds and golf course were fabulous and my partner even managed to squeeze in 18 holes (thanks to the front desk making that happen very last minute) while I had a truly top notch hot stone massage at the spa.  All of the hotel staff we met were extremely friendly and helpful– we especially appreciated Keith for making us feel very welcomed and looked after at Hugos. Overall, it was a great experience, and good value for the money. We will certainly be back!!",5,2021,08,16
238,Standards have dropped from 5 star to probably a 3 star hotel! SAD,"I feel.sad writing this review as loved this hotel. This was my 5th visit with family as we are very happy staying at Druids Glen. The overall quality is nowhere near the level it was previously. The lack of cleaning to a decent level, standard of breakfast,  menu being tired and dated with limited choice. The hotel thrived on its welcome of guests, skilled staff and going that extra yard to make the guests stay the best it could be but lack of skilled staff and the breakfast and dinner was extremely dissapointing. Sadly after 5 family visits this is probably our last visit to the resort. The one plus point that still remains is the exceptional Thomas at breakfast who is is welcoming skilled at his job will miss u my friend!",2,2021,08,16
238,Lovely Golf Hotel,"This is a lovely hotel for Golf, apart from the walk around the grounds there wasn't too much going on to fill your days.  The Spa availability was limited so we had to take what we could which meant we were a little rushed getting to the dinner reservation. Refused entry to the bar as we weren't eating although we see other group come in and just have drinks on the night we did eat there.  Hugo's and the Garden Bar food was excellent, options at Breakfast was a bit of a let down for a resort of this reputation. ",4,2021,08,16
238,Family trip,"Staff are very friendly, there's a warm welcome and good service. The grounds are lovely. The rooms could do with some freshening up and the attention to detail previously enjoyed was lacking this visit. ",3,2021,08,15
238,Fabulous getaway break,Ideal place for a friends reunion. Relaxing hotel and tasty food. Exceptional staff; anytime we made a request it was dealt with efficiently and without question. Had a great night’s sleep in a very comfy bed.,5,2021,08,15
238,Sweet luxury,"It is a stunning hotel. The lobby is beautiful and the staff were quick to welcome us. Overall the room, bar and facilities were fantastic. 

The dinner was very disappointing given the cost and reputation of Hugos. The food was slow to arrive and it lacked cohesion and imagination. Two of our dishes were just formed of large helpings of fennel, which is a very strong flavour and particularly killed the taste of the trout main.

On the flipside the leisure centre was a dream. The pool, suanu and steam room are big and in immaculate condition. The star is undoubtedly the jacuzzi. ",4,2021,08,15
238,Another relaxing stay!,We have visited Druids Glen many times over the years and we still enjoy short breaks to the hotel for dinner and walks etc. Over the years the quality of service has been consistently high and we enjoy to relaxed atmosphere.,5,2021,08,14
238,We will be coming back,"You must go on the walk around the Golf coarse, It's very well done, and the Fairy Garden is cool.
We found the staff their very friendly and helpful. We never got the chance to explore the full Hotel as we were only in the Hotel just for the one night.
Thant's to the staff for making our stay relaxed and comfortable.",5,2021,08,14
238,Highly recommended,"Excellent hotel, wonderful relaxed luxury environment, light and welcoming, staff genuinely warm and looked after us so well, great food, loved it! Loved Greystones and Bray nearby for beaches and cafés/restaurants and lots of stunning walks nearby into the Wicklow hills. Loved it!",5,2021,08,13
238,Amazing Stay,"A fantastic hotel. My friend and I went with the midweek spa package which included a meal and afternoon tea. Amazing from start to finish. Couldn’t fault anything at all!! The room was beautiful and the location means it is so quite and relaxing. 
Can’t wait to go back",5,2021,08,13
238,Downhill,"Disappointing stay, poor low quality over priced food, grumpy staff especially at breakfast, unfortunately hotel appears to have gone down hill… shame. Looks like back to Powerscourt hotels or me ……..",3,2021,08,13
238,Experience fell short of expectations,"Experience here fell short of what was expected of a 5 star resort. Taking all difficulties that hotels and staff have to face in covid times into account the overall experience unfortunately still fell short. The hotel itself is nice, clean and spacious. However the limited menus, the quality of the food and a small issue during breakfast which was reported to management  and the high price point of the overall stay would make me very reluctant to return. I did note a lot of families and I hear that there is a lot of child friendly options so perhaps a family break rather than a couples break would have been a better option but unsure after this last experience. ",3,2021,08,13
238,short couple break,"My wife and I had a two night break in Druids Glen and we really enjoyed it. Great staff , always friendly and willing to engage in conversation. Eat in bar and Hugo's , food was very good , only comment is that Hugo's menu is limited but very good, we will return",5,2021,08,11
238,Family Staycation,"Our 3rd visit to Druids Glen and yet again I could not fault a thing. Service, food, accommodation was all very good. I had concerns around Covid regulations and the possibility of restrictions on dining times etc but these were never an issue as all booked in advance, no queues or delays of any sort. The hotel went above and beyond to ensure customer safety and should be commended for this. Most importantly for us our children had a ball. Already looking forward to our next stay, ",5,2021,08,09
238,Disappointed,"We arrived back today from a two night stay and I feel it's only fair to enlighten other travellers of our experience. Firstly we have stayed in many 5 star hotels and this was no way worth the rating. The rooms were dated and not even a stocked mini bar was available in the room. Considering you couldn't just have a drink in the bar there was nowhere to sit after dinner.  The food in Hugo's was atrocious with a choice of about 4 main courses and one vegetarian option which was a poor choice considering The Happy Pear is very close to here. These guy's could teach them a thing or two at the hotel. The food and service was better in the garden rooms, where I had the vegan options and they were delicious. For a supposedly 5* hotel there was no option for an omelette, avocado on toast or even eggs benedict for breakfast. The choice was poor,  and some of the staff were simply not pleasant. Louise on check in was very helpful though and did point out some fantastic walks so thank you for that. Overall it was a nice weekend break but could have been better",3,2021,08,08
238,Disappointed,"Falls short of 5 star hotel standard. 
Cleanliness would be a concern. 
Limited menu in Garden Room. 
Some staff at breakfast were unsure of their role. Trays were given a minimal wipe with a tea towel between guests! 
",3,2021,08,08
238,Family staycation,"Lovely hotel close to many beautiful places to visit such as Powerscourt and Glenroe farm. We were a little disappointed at the quality of the playground and the playroom which are advertised for children on the main website. Very little for toddlers to actually play with in the playroom, possibly due to covid? Also noted that used glasses and empty glass bottles of Coke were not cleared away from the night before. The cleaning record had not been initialed in over a day… 
Although the food we had in the bar both nights was delicious, we found the menu to be extremely limited. Again for a 5 star resort you would expect more of a choice food wise. The one way system for breakfast is a great idea however, again, we found that there was a very limited breakfast choice. We were most disappointed about this during our stay. What we did have was beautiful but we would have expected to have a menu at our table for a hat breakfast such as eggs Benedict etc. 
Room was lovely, we stayed in room 109. Well laid out, plenty of space for the 4 of us. Our toddler loved the dvd selection! What a great idea. It would be great if these were updated but none the less it was great. 
All things considered we are planning a return trip in October again. We did not get to visit Powerscourt Waterfall so we are eager to do that! ",4,2021,08,08
238,Not even 3 stars anymore,"Been here many times in the past, but the lack of customer service, manners and poor quality of food will ensure we never darken the door again. From the disinterested and down right rude receptionist on check in, to the disorganised breakfast set up, not to mention the poor quality and lack of choice of food at breakfast....ITS A 3 STAR HOTEL AT BEST...........",2,2021,08,07
238,Family staycation,"Lovely hotel, lady at check in was great, room really good, spacious and clean. Room serviced on request each day. Breakfast excellent 1st two days, ordered eggs benedict and best I’ve ever had but next 2 days they were awful, eggs were hard and dry and were served on bottom half of burger bap with bacon on the side. Husband ordered omelette which was excellent. Pool was never too crowded due to advanced booking but would like to see sessions for families extended especially during school holidays, latest family time is 10 o’clock in morning and then between 2 o’clock and 5 o’clock in the afternoon. ",4,2021,08,07
238,Live insect,"My mother “treated” me to a stay in Druid's Glen on 17 September 2020 for my 30th birthday. The level of service we received was far from satisfactory.

My mother has made several attempts to contact management regarding the problems we encountered but the responses received have been inadequate.

We are not generally not ones to complain but there were so many issues that something needs to be said to ensure that they are addressed.

When we stayed at Druid's Glen, the country was at Level 2 on the National Framework for living with COVID-19. The neighbouring county, Dublin, was at risk of being moved to Level 3.

We arrived in reception beside a lobby full of guests drinking and some guests walking through the lobby without masks. 

We were advised that the room we had booked was a double room despite the fact that my mother had selected a twin room option at the time of booking. Eventually, the receptionist agreed to send someone up to the room to separate the beds.

We booked a meal in the restaurant of the hotel for the evening of our arrival. I ordered a cocktail and my mother ordered a glass of wine - we were waiting a long time to receive them. While I would expect it to take time for a cocktail to be made, my mother had to wait even longer than I did for her glass of wine to be brought to the table. We would have expected our drinks to arrive together or for the wine to come first at least. When my food arrived, it was lukewarm. My mother was brought someone else’s meal and explained to the waiter that it was not was she had ordered. I was almost finished my dinner by the time she received hers. There was a table in the same part of the restaurant that we were sitting in with about 8 men at it - the restrictions at the time would have meant that there should be no more than 6 to a table.

I made a booking to use the leisure facilities and was preparing for a swim on the morning of 18 September 2020. I arrived down to the door of the swimming pool and entered it at my allocated time. I was then asked to go back and wait outside while the area was being cleaned. While I was delighted it was being cleaned, I think it would be a better experience for guests if time slots were allocated maybe 10/15 minutes later to ensure that cleaning would already be done and that they wouldn’t have to wait around for this time in the hotel corridor in their bath robes. The leisure facilities attendant didn’t appear to have any record of my booking even after spelling my surname.

I was looking forward to breakfast after my swim. We headed towards the restaurant and were directed to a table and advised how the one way queuing system and buffet worked. There was a partition between our table and the one nearest to us - it was no more then the width of a tray (certainly nowhere near 1 metre). While seated, our heads were above the height of the partition - it almost felt like we were sitting at the same table as the guests beside us.

My mother came back from the buffet with a bowl of fruit and yoghurt. She was just about to eat it when something (a live insect) caught my eye and I told her to stop. It took us ages to get the attention of a waiter. When we eventually did, they asked my mother if it had fallen from the roof (neither of us are fans of insects - we don’t carry them around in our pockets to plant them in meals). They then asked her if she wanted another bowl to which she replied - “well I’m hardly going to eat this one”.

I hope that the experiences I have outlined above have given some context in terms of our stay and that improvements are made so that future guests will have a better experience than we did.",1,2021,08,07
238,Lovely family stay,"What a gem this hotel is, we stayed for 3 nights and given the current restrictions and responsibilities to keep us all safe we had a lovely stay and felt safe at all times. 
There are a few one way systems in operation, they’re very simple to follow and worked well during our stay. 
The pool needs to be pre booked, each family has there own area and the pool definitely wasn’t over crowded which was great to see. We eat in both Hugo’s and the Garden bar, food and service in both places was exceptional and catered for all ages very easily, one tip if your kids are small, one portion will easily fill two kids.
Overall it’s operating like a well oiled machine which given the current COVID circumstances can’t be easy to manage but the management team seem to be dealing with it really well. Highly recommended.",5,2021,08,06
238,Almost faultless,"Having reviewed the hotel before and mentioning the awful bacon and omelette on that occasion far too much, it is pleasing that this has been now addressed. The breakfast was excellent, well cooked and much improved. 

The unusual ordering of fried eggs at the table with the tea and toast causes a bit of a problem though as you have to get the fried food when the eggs are coming to the table or else one or other goes a bit cool. It would be better if it all could be collected from the chef at the buffet.

As for the rest if the stay it was superb. The suite was huge and the bed comfortable. It overlooked the 12 green and the 13th tee on the course. 

Nothing was too much trouble for all the staff we encountered and the place is a credit to the management.",5,2021,08,04
238,Nice night away,"We stayed ere for 1 night to celebrate a family Birthday. Overall the experience was good, the staff were very friendly and helpful, although i feel a lot are new and being trained in, this was no problem and to be expected in the circumstances. The meal in Hugo's was nice and staff here were excellent. The pool, like some other areas of the hotel could do with some work however. We had a nice time and would go again, however considering the price, I feel it falls short of 5 stars at this moment, and hopefully the new owners will invest in some much needed refurbishments. ",4,2021,08,04
238,Busy hotel,"We stayed the Sunday and Monday of the bank holiday. Druids Glen is a welcoming hotel with good amenities for adults. The staff are pleasant and helpful. The atmosphere was okay, quite rushed and always busy in the lobby, restaurant and bar. The golf courses and spa are in great condition. The rest of the hotel including the rooms and restaurants looked like they needed an update or a rethink considering the number of large families and groups who were staying in the hotel. The staff were lovely especially in the spa. ",4,2021,08,04
238,Fabulous Stay,"Myself and the husband stayed for one night in a superior room. It was a wonderful experience, extremely relaxing and unbelievably comfortable. Dinner was amazing! Spa was amazing! Staff are amazing! We will be back and we will be 100% recommending Druids Glen to friends and family.",5,2021,08,02
238,Lovely hotel,"We stayed recently at Druids Glen to celebrate our anniversary. It was overall a lovely experience. They sent us a complimentary box of chocolates and a card to greet us, which we found very thoughtful and a nice touch. We had dinner at the garden room bar and restaurant and it was lovely too. We really liked the buffalo wings. The only thing that I found was the room wasn’t dark enough for our baby, it’s summer time and it doesn’t get dark until about 10p.m. She slept a bit later and woke up earlier than she normally would because of this. So I didn’t get to enjoy the bed as much which was very comfortable. That was the only issue that I found. And special mention to all the staff were kind and helpful. ",5,2021,08,01
238,Beautiful hotel with the best staff,"Staff were excellent, so helpful and genuinely helpful. Beautiful spacious room with unreal beds! So comfortable and the bests pillows.Lots of COVID precautions in place.  Nice pool area, very well run",4,2021,08,01
238,"A beautiful golf course, pity about everything else","Overcrowded hotel, full of kids running about. Poor food and young staff who were too busy to make the effort to be pleasant. If it wasn't for the quality of the golf course, it would have been a total washout of a trip. ",3,2021,07,31
238,Not 4 or 5 star quality wouldnt return,"I had a few recommendations so was really looking forward to my first holiday in over a year and half. Costs added up to nearly 700 overall for 2 ppl and I've paid less at other 5 star hotels that couldn't be faulted. There was no atmosphere in the hotel , the food was horrendous- breakfast, lunch and dinners and for this reason I wouldn't return. I am really disappointed with my stay as I was looking forward to it so much. This hotel is not 4 star nor 5 star quality. 

On a positive note the spa was lovely and Corinna did my massage and she was absolutely amazing!",2,2021,07,31
238,Birthday stay,"Visited to celebrate a birthday and staff went out of their way to make it special. Excellent spa experience, facial was really enjoyable. Lovely comfortable room and bar food was delicious. Will be returning. ",5,2021,07,31
238,Family escape,"Regular visitor with my family and want to thank all the staff for maintaining COVID guidelines and keeping both staff and guests safe under such extraordinary times. 

Pros:
Wonderful family centric hotel
Beautiful river walk and fairy forest 
Great swimming pool and managed well 
Professional and friendly staff, patient and tolerant towards the junior guests, including my own! 
Family rooms are great, spacious and loads of room 
Really nice play room
Loads of well stocked hand sanitizer stations, thank you. 

Con: 
Only negative thing was the lack of options on the lunch menu. No vegetarian option, I asked and was offered one from the room service menu. 
Would love to see more vegetables added to the kids menu, too much chips. Some corn on the cob with chicken offered but would like carrots/broccoli as well. A potato/pasta option instead of chips would be welcomed. 

Overall a great stay, and looking forward to going back.",5,2021,07,30
238,"Great service, lovely place to stay","Stayed in Druids Hotel with my family for three nights.  We had a lovely experience.  Staff really nice. Kids had good fun in the swimming pool, and lots of activities to do with the  near by. Would go back again.",5,2021,07,28
238,Wonderful Experience from start to finish.,"Oasis of Natural Beauty, tranquil and elegant... 5 star is not simply enough to rate the Experience we had had from start to finish. Exceptionally Professional and Welcoming Staff made such an impression that we are already looking to book the Hotel again soon.
Krisztian serving us the dinner was so helpful and professional and great fun that our youngsters keep talking about him at the dinner table at home. Thank you so much. ",5,2021,07,27
238,Another lovely stay in Druids Glen.,"Wonderful hotel, amazing rooms and facilities. Lovely to relax in the Garden room area or walk the grounds. Excellent friendly staff and everyone felt really safe with very good covid measures in place.  Lovely food in Hugos and always love the breakfast. ",5,2021,07,26
238,1 night at Druids Glen,We had an amazing time. The room was fabulous and the location is just stunning. We would definitely recommend the spa. The food was great and such high quality. We were really looked after during our stay.,5,2021,07,25
238,Kid friendly is the positive,"Nice terrace looking over the trees, although in general, golfers first, which is fair enough! Service is only okay, seems like could use a good manager.  Limited dinner menu, 4 non changing main courses, both I had were over cooked. Kid friendly which is the big plus",3,2021,07,25
238,Absolutely excellent!!!,"Has just been incredible from start to finish. Staff were all so lovely. Restaurant manager at breakfast couldn’t do enough for you. We are currently in another hotel at the minute outside Gorey -
For the same price as Druids glen & there is no comparison! I wish we had stayed for the full week. Food, pool, staff, cleanliness absolutely everything is just top notch. Thank you all so much. See you soon!",5,2021,07,24
238,Gorgeous location & excellent service,The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The family room was large and comfortable. We enjoyed a good breakfast every day. The kids loved the playground and the pool. We also had a great day at the nearby beach. ,5,2021,07,24
238,Lovely hotel,"Myself and my family had a fantastic stay here. The staff were amazing and couldn’t do enough for us. Barbara at breakfast was extremely nice and welcoming. Even though we were a large family she took the time look after us each morning when we came down.
We will definitely be back. ",5,2021,07,23
238,Nice stay,"Stayed 3 nights this week. 2 adults and 2 children 10 and 9. Friendly staff. Nice big air conditioned room with excellent tea/coffee making facilities, Bathrobes and slippers provided. Ate in the bar one evening, menu nice but limited. Breakfast was nice, hotel very safe with sanitiser everywhere and very well organised eg times for pool and dining. Things to note: no hangers provided in the room except those used for robes. Hotel charged full amount for stay on arrival plus 200 euro per night incidentals. Make sure you have plenty of cash on your card!! Would stay again.",4,2021,07,22
238,More of a 3.5 ,"We stayed for 2 nights in druids glen, the reception area was really nice and we were checked in quickly, rooms were very spacious and had everything you needed inside them although our shower door constantly leaked water when showering so the bathroom floor was always wet, the terrace was lovely for drinks, if your ordering cocktails they make a lot that are not on the menu aswell which is good, the food was way below par, we got the bar menu and it was very limited, even with covid the menu just seemed flat, I got the jalfrezi chicken skewers which must have been prepared an hour beforehand because I could not even cut the chicken off the skewers it was so tough and literally stuck to the skewer. Our waitress Charlotte (I think) was so professional and very friendly and made our stay so much better. Pool area is ok felt very crowded with 9 seating stations,we could not find how to get to the swimming pool, no signs and were then told to just wait at the disabled toilet door and someone will bring us in, which was very odd, jacuzzi was not working when we were there. Overall it was a mixture of feelings, for the elegance of the hotel I feel more could be done with these menus and that everything runs a bit smoother. Breakfast was fantastic and all the waiting staff at breakfast were great aswell.",4,2021,07,22
238,M Connor,"Just home today from a lovely 2 night stay in the Druids Glen Hotel.  The hotel is situated in Newtownmountkennedy just off the N11 and is very easy to get to.    I went with my husband , 10 year old daughter and my two adult sons and their girlfriends.   We had 3 rooms booked and from the moment we walked in we were greeted by friendly efficient staff that couldn’t do enough for us.  We settled in the room and after a while went for a walk around the grounds.  The grounds are beautiful with loads of wildlife about.  We were lucky to see a few red squirrels running up and down the trees and the swans and ducks on the lakes are beautiful to watch.  We also came across a little fairy fort in the forest which was a big hit with all of us. Lovely photo opportunity.  There is a 6km walk around the golf course but just stay within the paths that say walkers only.  We had a lovely meal in the Garden bar that evening.  The next day my husband and two sons went golfing and we headed to Enniskerry to see the set of disenchanted which was really nice (looking forward to seeing the film but no sign of Mcdreamy). We then visited Powerscourt waterfall.  The highest waterfall in Ireland.  It was beautiful there.  You could really spend a day here with a picnic.  We headed back to the hotel as we had the swimming pool booked and I must say this was run so well within Covid guidelines with different zones allocated to each family.  The pool was lovely and we relaxed and did a bit of swimming before relaxing more in the sauna and jacuzzi.  I then headed to the Spa where I had a massage booked.  Well this was just out on its own.  The therapist was really good and I just didn’t want it to finish.  When I went back to the relaxation suit she came in with a delicious strawberry sorbet  and a nice cold glass of water.   We had another family meal in the Garden Bar that evening and a very special thank you to Mark who looked after us so well.  All in all we all had a wonderful time in the Druids Glen Hotel and hopefully will get back there soon.  Would really recommend a visit hence my 5 star rating.  A rating that is truly deserving.  Thank you to all the staff that made us feel so welcome. The Connor Family",5,2021,07,16
238,A great hotel for a family break,This is a great location for a family holiday. Loads to do in Wicklow and also close enough to Dublin if you run out of things to do. The bar menu is a little limited but there are plenty of restaurants in the surrounding towns. Looking forward to our next visit.,5,2021,07,16
238,Family Staycation,There was absolutely nothing to fault at this hotel..we had a thoroughly enjoyable break and will definitely return and recommend this hotel. The facility and surroundings were fab but the staff were amazing..,5,2021,07,15
238,Excellent Family Break,"We stayed for 3 nights in July 2021 as a family - 4 adults and 1 child (7). The hotel has a great atmosphere and is child friendly without being chaotic. The ""druids den"" kids area is great and allowed my daughter to make friends during her stay. Food was excellent with lots of dining choices & the facilities were great. Druids glen is a great base for exploring other towns/sites as its seems to be basically 20 mins from anywhere we wanted to go!",5,2021,07,14
238,Family stay,We stayed in Druidsglen for 3  nights.  The rooms were lovely and the staff were excellent. The pool was very nice but due to Covid restrictions there wasn't much atmosphere in the hotel in general.  The only drawback was that we booked the bar for dinner each evening.  The food for a 5 star hotel was average.  The menu including fish and burgers was not was you would expect from a hotel of this rating.   Chicken bang bang  was barely edible and the steak average.  I liked the hotel but the menu would need to improve for me to make a return visit,3,2021,07,12
238,Staycation at Druids Glen,Great hotel with fantastic service. The family room was lovely. The pool was very well run taking account of the Covid restrictions. Food was gorgeous. Would highly recommend a stay and will visit again . ,5,2021,07,12
238,Family 3 day break,"Good family friendly hotel. Staff all very friendly and helpful. Golf course excellent. Menu does not change but very helpful with gluten free choices. Hugos was not worth the extra money, the service was slow and disappointing, however the manager was very professional and dealt with us very fairly. 
",5,2021,07,11
238,In the lap of luxury in Wicklow,"Superb service across the board, this is a brilliant five-star experience suitable for young families. Food is excellent, though the menu is a little restricted in variety, rooms are spotless and staff are second to none. Under the circumstances of COVID, the communication is excellent, and friendly & helpful.",5,2021,07,11
238,Thanks you for an excellent stay!,"Excellent stay, excellent facilities, welcoming and friendly staff! My kids really enjoy it. The bathrobes and slippers for the children was such a lovely touch! In room facilities were great too and the Baby Pantry was a god send! Well done Druids Glen! We’ll be back!",5,2021,07,11
238,Enjoyable Stay in Druids Glen,"We booked a night stay at Druids Glen in July 2021.   Everything about this hotel was lovely from the minute we arrived including the beautiful flowers surrounding the Check in area. .  The staff in the Hotel were all so friendly and went above and beyond during our stay. 
Our room we were provided with was so lovely, cosy, clean and spacious.  We had a beautiful view of the grounds and were so lucky with the weather giving us an opportunity to explore the Hotel and Golf club grounds.  
We booked the Garden Room and Bar for our dinner that night.   As a Coeliac with dietary needs the restaurant was perfect. We were checked on by the Bar Manager, who was very professional, throughout the night.  He gave great recommendations on the bar food and drinks and also great recommendations on where we should visit while staying in Wicklow.  The bar food was delicious and the staff were very accommodating.   We had the Buffalo wings to share and as a Starter and I enjoyed the Grilled Irish Beef and Pork Mince Burger with a gluten free bun for my Main course.  Our waiters was well trained and very understanding on my worries of my food being prepared separately, which settled my anxiety and allowed me to enjoy the evening.    I enjoyed the beautiful Dark Chocolate Brownie.  More  GF options would be lovely!!  I cannot stress enough how nice the atmosphere, staff, food and surroundings were in the Garden Room and Bar.

Considering the current status of the country with Covid etc we could not have felt any safer or more comfortable during our stay. I felt that the hotel did a fantastic job of adhering to the regulations, while still providing a professional and quality experience.  Will absolutely be returning for a longer stay and to see more of beautiful Wicklow.",5,2021,07,10
238,Blissful,"Stayed for a short family trip, everyone was very nice and welcoming 9f our family.  All staff spoke very nicely and included the children. 100% stay here you will not be disappointed.  Food was excellent and there is plenty to do just at the hotel itself ",5,2021,07,10
238,1 star food,"We wouldn't stay here again based on the awful bar food. We could only eat in the hotel due to covid, so the 2 dinners with 2 kids was expensive and disapponting. On the final night we got a take away and brought it back to the room as we couldn't eat any more disappointing food. I highly recommend take away from the pizza shack in Newton Mount kennedy. Its an expensive place to stay, so you expect excellence and a bit of luxury, but it felt more like a 2/3 star experience. Would not stay again. ",2,2021,07,10
238,Not 5 Star,"I pondered a while before writing this review, but after speaking to a few other couples lately with similar experiences in this and 1 other 5 star hotel, I decided I really should......
 We were so excited when we booked our 1 night 5 star treat away. Restaurant dinner was very disappointing, all 3 courses!!! No taste, no attention to detail, very bland food.. 
No entrance to the bar allowed after dinner for few drinks, escorted to lobby area. Instead, Very comfy chairs here, we ordered our drinks twice with 2 different members of staff, but  within 1 hour wait,we got fed up waiting so left for bed.
No sign of any duty manager at all, young friendly staff, but clearly not enough. 
Breakfast we had to ask for Toast , coffee cold, mam almost dropped her tray carrying her hot food back to the table, she is 77 and clearly needed help, I dropped my tray to help her, it's all these little things on top of a bad meal in Restaurant, we have stayed in so many better organised 4 star hotels with amazing food.. 
June is peak season and one would expect more organisation and the presence of senior staff in a 5 star hotel, so overall very bad experience, felt worst for my mam as she cocooned for so long and she was so looking forward to the pampering treat.",2,2021,07,09
238,Such a let down,"For the last number of years I have wanted to visit the Druid's Glen. I recently spent two nights there.
We were able to check in early which was nice,on arrival at the room it was spacious and clean.
We had dinner in the Garden Rooms Bar on one night,the food wasn't what I would expect from a 5 star hotel. In the evening we had a drink around the foyer which was nice,children were walking/running from place to place unsupervised, I feel that during covid this was not good. Breakfast was very disappointing, both the service and food, there is a one way system in place,which is very confusing, having to walk up and down two sets of three steps with a tray is not safe. I was stunned that there was not table service during the current Covid situation.
Unfortunately I wouldn't visit again, in my opinion this does not live up to 5 Star.",2,2021,07,07
238,Nearly 5 star,4 star let down by its FOOD. Had 5 days here for business expo. Staff were amazing. The room and bed exceptionally  comfortable great environment however the choice of food quality of food was and look warm buffet breakfast were no better than an above average pub to be honest otherwise 5 star. The food sadly in no way reflects everything else this hotel has to offer !!! Shame.,4,2021,07,07
238,Staying at Druids Glen Hotel & Golf Resort,"My wife and I took our daughter, her husband and two children (2Girls) on a return visit to Druids Glen (Our Second Visit) for a real treat and great vacation! A beautiful location and plenty to do, we will return!",5,2021,07,07
238,Mini break Wicklow,"Beautiful Location, Easy check-in, Room was super clean & fresh. Fab View, swimming pool clean, Covid measures in place and working well. Food delicious & Staff friendly courteous and helpful.  
We will be back ",5,2021,07,06
238,Lovely hotel,"Great hotel, staff and facilities , we had our toddler and I was heavily pregnant,  we were upgraded to a family suite and it was great, food was amazing and pool was great for kids, also lovely gardens and walk ways around the hotel",5,2021,07,05
238,Weekend Away,"Everything about this hotel was lovely right from beginning to end.

We used the spa for a treat & I would definitely recommend you treat yourself in the spa. The staff were all so friendly & could not do enough to accommodate you!

We dined in the bar for dinner the cocktails & dinner were delicious! Rachel was serving our table & she was very attentive & friendly while providing 5 star service. 

A tip would be to book your meals as well as the pool well in advance we left it until the day before & couldn't really get meal times to suit & the pool was fully booked for when suited also so keep this in mind!",5,2021,07,05
238,Nice hotel and lovely staff but some improvements needed,"Overall a nice break, the room and bed was lovely and comfortable, the staff are excellent. The food didn't quite live up to expectations. The covid measures while were good in theory there were a massive number of unmasked guests walking around the lobby where drinks were served which made me very uncomfortable, I understand the staff aren't mask police and people need to take responsibility themselves but for the safety of other guests this should be addressed and I wouldnt recommend anyone to stay during covid due to this.",4,2021,07,05
238,Gorgeous night away,Stayed overnight in Druids Glen in July 2021 & we loved everything about it. The rooms are fabulous and the staff were extremely helpful. Mark in particular in the bar & restaurant area couldn’t have been anymore helpful in regards food orders as well as what drink would go well with our meals & his personality was a breath of fresh air. Leisure Center was also very nice. The grounds and walks around the property were also gorgeous. We will definitely be back soon 😍,5,2021,07,05
238,Great stay,Lovely hotel in beautiful surroundings. Easy to find our way around to surrounding attractions. It was busy and that was good to see. I would recommend this hotel for a relaxing break as it's so quiet and peaceful. ,4,2021,07,04
238,Drop in service,"Stayed here once before which was an amazing trip, this time however the service quality has dropped well below 5-Star. 

I've shared specifics with Management but key points:
Servers Jurgita and Kristian were both excellent in the Bar and Hugo respectively, 5 star service from them. Nearly all other staff seemed aloof, not overly friendly and not overly interested, I'm not sure if they are more recent hires after Covid and lacking experience but this is a 5 Star resort and thats not acceptable.

Spa staff and service was excellent from start to finish",4,2021,07,03
238,July 1 2021 FANTASTIC STAY ⭐️ ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,"My wife and I just arrived back from the beautiful Druids Glen hotel and had a really wonderful stay. The staff were so nice accommodating and very helpful for any needs and extra required. They left Butlers  chocolates in the beautiful beautiful suite they provided us with while we were at dinner which was a lovely gesture. Considering the current status of the country with Covid etc we could not of felt any safer or comfortable. The hotel was and swimming pool was so clean and time slots we allocated accordingly for safety and also for adults times and childrens times. The suite we were provided was probably the nicest most comfortable cosy clean spacious room with a beautiful fireplace and room temperatures for perfection, and I say that after years of travelling worldwide. If your looking for a beautiful relaxing getaway I would 100% recommend The Druids Glen. The dinner was beautiful in the garden restaurant and the buffet breakfast was top notch and have you set for the day. And a special special thanks to Edel on reception what a lovely lovely person and exactly the type of person you love to deal with on a break like that. From the moment we spoke to Edel she was so friendly kind accommodating and went out of her way to make sure all our needs were met. I would give it 6 stars for Edel as I mentioned to her. Absolutely beautiful relaxing stay and will definitely be back . Very easy to find plenty of room for and ease for parking right outside the front door and guys on the door also offering great accommodation and help. Thanks Edel and to all the team at the Druids Glen and keep up the fantastic work. 10/10

238,Wonderful trip,The hotel and facilities were fantastic. Really friendly efficient staff.  It helped that the weather was beautiful too so we could sit on the patio and walk the beautiful grounds.  It felt like we’d been abroad but were only an hour from home. ,5,2021,07,02
238,Mid-week overnight stay.JUNE 2021,"From the moment we arrived our stay was simply wonderful
The reception area beautiful flowers surrounding this area
Check in, rooms bright and beds so comfortable
Pool and spa service brilliant
Staff helpful and courteous 
Can’t wait to go back",5,2021,07,01
238,Family weekend stay,"This is a great hotel - stayed several times in recent years and had a very favourable experience on each occasion.   Nice facilities, relaxed atmosphere with friendly, helpful and professional staff.   Makes for a very relaxing break.....",5,2021,06,28
238,"Good service, poor food, uncomfortable seating","The service was excellent and hotel. Is immaculate but the seating in the bar is quite uncomfortable, in particular if you are eating, tables and chairs are too low. The bar menu is pretty poor for choices and the food wasn't great. ",4,2021,06,28
238,Excellent,"Wonderful experience here at druids glen, only stayed for 1 night but will definitely come back for a longer brrak in future . Special mention to the waitress in hugo's restaurant, can't remember her name but we never had service like it plus food was divine.",5,2021,06,28
238,Gorgeous hotel ,"We couldn’t fault the hotel. The rooms were really nice, beds so comfy. The staff were amazing. So friendly and helpful. We were asked was there a celebration within our group, and we told them we had two birthdays to celebrate. When we went to our rooms that evening, there was a bottle of Prosecco waiting for us in each of our rooms. Such a nice touch. ",5,2021,06,27
238,Excellent family break.,"Booked here for a short break last minute, as we had to leave The Powerscourt Hotel as it was deplorable. They kindly fitted us in and Fiona at reception was fantastic. Overall appearance outside at first was disappointing but the feel, look and professionalism inside quickly changed my mind. Staff from waiters to porters were friendly and professional. Had great sleeps and superb breakfast. Only small complaint would be the food menu, no fresh fish or fish starters, bar fish and chips, Even some chicken mains but for a short break it worked just fine. Some lovely staff members, like Elsa, she oozed kindness. 2 or 3 also in the garden rooms that I didn't catch their names also. I will return and can see why they're heavily booked, well done Druids Glen. ",5,2021,06,26
238,Family trip,We had a fabulous time here . The staff were so helpful and nothing was a problem for them . The food was fantastic and we felt very safe and comfortable with all the covid safety measures that were taken . ,5,2021,06,25
238,Family Break,"We brought our two boys (7yrs and 4yrs) down for a night.  It was our first trip to a hotel since the pandemic and it was absolutely brilliant.  The hotel was so well set up with all of the Covid measures, yet we still felt that it was a nice break from the daily grind of Covid news.  We used the pool twice when we were there and it was fabulous - really well organised.  We booked a slot and could use the pool for 45 minutes.  It wasn't busy so we felt really safe and relaxed in there.  We had dinner in Hugo's Restaurant and it was absolutely divine.  Such great choice on the menu.  The kids menu was fabulous too.  They had roast chicken, corn on the cob and chips - a really nice change from the usual nuggets and sausages and chips.  Our waiter was so warm and made such a fuss of the boys - they loved it.  We used the play room at the hotel - the boys loved the air hockey table and we passed a happy hour or two in there with them.  The set-up at breakfast was excellent - super choice and again really well set up with Covid measures.  I didn't think there would be a buffet at all but it was still there - just with staff serving it to you.  The boys had pancakes and absolutely loved them.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and look forward to returning again very soon!",5,2021,06,25
238,Really nice Hotel and Staff,"Myself and my fiance stayed here the 22nd to the 24th of June with her mother and father. Overall it was a great couple of days and found the hotel very clean and the staff really nice and helpful. The food in hugos resteraunt was delicious and so was the bar food.

There were a couple of small things that made me give it 4 stars rather than 5. Firstly, I had booked the afternoon tea for my fiance and her mam for Tuesday at 1:30 while myself and her father played golf. When I returned from. Golf my fiance informed me that they didn't have afternoon tea as there was no booking which was annoying as it was booked.

Another issue we had was when getting the courtesy car from the hotel to the golf course. We got dropped off no problem but when we got picked up the driver stopped to pick up a family of 4 who were walking back from the golf course walking trail which. Given the circumstances it made us feel quite uncomfortable sitting in a car with 4 other strangers as we thought the courtesy car was just for us.. To make things worse the driver then stopped to pick up another couple on the way back which would have filled every single seat in the car but I spoke up to say I will get out and walk if anyone else gets into the car so he didn't let them in. The whole experience wasn't very covid compliant and felt as though the driver was cutting corners as he didn't want to make a couple of trips. 

The bar was also a bit dissapoiting. The european championships are currently on and we  had to watch the Portugal v france match on our phone in the middle of the table because we were told that none of the TVs are working which is surprising for a 5 star hotel. We were also informed that the heaters in the outdoor decking area were broken so couldn't be turned on when we got a bit nippy on Tuesday evening. I think with the money they are charging to stay as well as the price of a pint (€6.50 and €9 for a glass of rose) they could pay to get these things fixed.

Don't get me wrong, it is a fantastic hotel and the staff couldn't do enough for us, but I just feel the above items score it as a 4 star hotel for me.",4,2021,06,24
238,Touring around and taking in the beautiful scenery.,"It was great to get a break after the past 18 months and travel around exploring the wonderful area within 30/40kms.  The Hotel was a bonus as everything was perfect, food was amazing and staff pleasant and kept everything moving safely and smoothly. Look forward to a return trip later in the year. ",5,2021,06,24
238,Clinging onto 5 stars status,"We found the service in both hugos and the garden rooms was poor and the atmosphere was dead (but that could be due to covid) and it was very expensive for drinks but the room was nice, and the hotel was very clean.",2,2021,06,24
238,Another Excellent Stay at Druid's Glen,"This is the second time that we stayed in Druid's Glen and it won't be our last.  As usual, the staff were extremely professional and friendly, food and drinks we had were excellent and are room was of a high quality.

We made use of the swimming pool, the spa and the walking trail around the grounds and all were excellent.

The food in both Hugo's restaurant (for dinner and breakfast) and in the Garden Room was lovely and the waiting staff did an excellent job.

Given the current restrictions, I felt that the hotel did a fantastic job of adhering to the regulations, while still providing a professional and quality experience.",5,2021,06,23
238,Service with a smile!,"Great stay in Druids Glen this weekend. Whilst the hotel itself is beautiful and exactly what you would expect from a resort like this, it was the wonderful staff that stood out for me. They are genuinely very helpful, friendly and accommodating and nothing seems to be too much trouble for them. Shout out to waiting staff Joe and Luke who looked after us all afternoon/evening in the outdoor area for a bbq. They made the whole experience extremely enjoyable for us with very attentive service and friendly conversation. We will be back!",5,2021,06,20
238,Wonderful place to stay,Myself and my wife stayed here for her birthday.We couldn’t have asked fir a better place to stay. The hotel is beautiful and very clean and welcoming. we have stayed here a few times and will again. Love this hotel and the food in Hugos restaurant is some of the best we ever had - highly recommend,5,2021,06,19
238,Midweek break treat,Really enjoyed your hotel with fresh comfortable beds and Appetising breakfasts. Our fine dining evening was something else. The food was exquisite for want of another word.  The chefs should really have been applauded! Bravo!,5,2021,06,16
238,Wonderful hotel and SPA,"We love this hotel, and visit it few times a year, especially for it's SPA. All staff are friendly, helpful and attentive. Nice food in both restaurants. Great experience. The walk trail around the hotel grounds is worth trying - beautiful views all around.",5,2021,06,13
238,Birthday trip away.,"Overall we had a lovely stay. But our stay last year was 100 percent better. Felt service and others things were missing. 
Felt it was not good value for what we received. Service for breakfast and lunch not up to a high standards for a five star hotel. ",4,2021,06,13
238,Charley in garden room & bar lovely young man,Lovely relaxing break at druids glen. Food was amazing as was service charley in garden rooms & bar was a pleasure to deal with. His service & manner were 100%. Great stay all staff were 100% friendly & helpful. ,5,2021,06,11
238,Excellent as usual,"Wonderful stay. Hotel spotlessly clean, but always was before covid. Food excellent. Staff always helpful and professional. All covid rules in place and plenty sanitizing stations around. Room perfect with wonderful view. Love Druids for the perfect getaway to chill.",5,2021,06,09
238,Relaxing Stay,"Absolutely love this hotel resort, staff are so friendly and cannot do enough for you.   Hotel is in a superb location in beautiful Wicklow and not far from the motorway.  Fabulous food and relaxing atmosphere.  Overall a truly blissful stay.",5,2021,06,09
238,Great for Families,"Very family friendly hotel, but also nice for golfers and spa break.  Overall lovely mini break, beautiful rooms very comfortable.  We only ate in the bar, same menu all day and evening which is a pity some additional lunch choices would be good so you can eat differently later particularly with kids.    Service was very slow and didn't appear to be enough staff around.  Breakfast exceptional and service.  Kids love the games room its the highlight of the trip and the pool.  Overall great stay, we pre booked everthing in advance and it works well the hotel respecting all covid guidelines excellent on that side.  ",4,2021,06,09
238,Not for small children.,"The hotel is impressive on approach and maintains high standards throughout. Staff are hardworking, friendly and efficient.  Accommodation was good. However, there are one or two minor quibbles:

The play area at the side of the hotel is in a poor state of repair and could do with a lick of paint because it looks a little seedy. That apart, the roundabout is out of action and has been for more than a year. It is probably in a dangerous condition but it has yellow warning ribbons attached. Rubber flooring is a welcome safety feature, but it is worn out and missing in parts; some has been badly repaired.
. 
The Fairy Garden is a nice idea, but no self respecting fairy would put a foot in this one. It mainly consists of small birds houses hung from trees along with streamer-type decorations, and small painted doors resting on mud piles. It is quite untidy too.

The guided walk is generally good but it leads past a row of town houses at the end of the avenue when it would be much better running  past the 14th tee.",4,2021,06,09
238,Will definitely be back,"This is my second stay in Druids but it had been 6 years since I was there. Thankfully nothing has changed. The hotel is beautiful and the surrounds are gorgeous. The room felt luxurious and the spa is the perfect place to unwind. But above all of this is the staff. They were just so lovely, exceedingly helpful and brought the hotel to life. From the front of house to the hostess, the waiters to the spa staff we can’t say enough about them. We saw them doing everything they could to aid a family who’s child had special needs to ensure the whole family enjoyed their breakfast and they kept checking with us to be sure we had received everything our package had promised. ",5,2021,06,09
238,Great Hotel,"Have stayed here a number of times. Great hotel overall. With reopening, service in the restaurant was poor but would hope that improves with time. Bar and leisure facilities were fantastic and the room was comfortable. ",4,2021,06,08
238,Bank holiday weekend,"We stayed at Druids Glenn for the BH weekend. While we had a couple of small issues initially, these were sorted out to our satisfaction. The food in the restaurant was delicious… and our lovely server Lilla, very comfortable beds and lovely room. A special mention to young Joe waiter, attentive and so helpful, Katie in the bar, Irene on reception and  Joey bar manager who were hospitable friendly and professional. A special thanks to Keith Manager who we dealt with personally and found genuine and a great role model for his staff. Overall our time was enjoyed because of the lovely staff… looking forward to our next stay! 
Linda, John and Jonathan White.",4,2021,06,07
238,Excellent service and a great weekend,We stayed in Druids Glen for the June Bank Holiday weekend. The room was beautiful with a great view and all the staff were excellent. We had food in both the bar and the restaurant during our stay and both were excellent with a great menu to choose from. We had the pleasure of talking to the Operations Manager Keith while enjoying a drink in the Foyer and he was very welcoming and you could tell he really cared when he asked if we were enjoying our stay. Great weekend and would definitely stay again.,5,2021,06,07
238,Lovely place,Room was very comfortable. (Bed was amazing) both the food in the garden rooms and Hugo’s was lovely.  2hr wait for dinner was not ideal but appreciate this was due to first weekend reopening post lockdown and a lot of new staff. Would visit again. ,4,2021,06,07
238,Our Stay At Druids (CV19),"we were one of the first guest to return to Druids on June 3rd after the partial lifting of Covid 19 restrictions . Talking all the difficulties in re opening into consideration.  A Great stay !  
we have always enjoyed our time at Druids Glen.    ",3,2021,06,07
238,Family Stay,"A lovely family trip overall. Great amenities for toddlers.... playground, pool, playroom, fairy forest and nice walks. Lovely food and friendly staff. Rooms exceptionally clean. We will most definitely return.",4,2021,06,07
238,Post lockdown mini holiday,Wonderful welcome. Check in a bit busy but expected post lockdown lucky they have an indoor and outdoor playground for our little hyper kid. Social distancing in place. Nice and comfy clean room. Scheduled meal times and pool times to comply with covid protocols. Also a nice walk where we spotted bunnies. Thank you Druids Glen!!!,5,2021,06,04
238,A wonderful stay,"Highly recommended, super hotel facilities and friendly and very helpful staff... Felt very safe in a covid environment, great space during dining and really clean room and facilities. Look forward to returning post covid and using more of the great facilities once reopened.",5,2021,01,05
238,Christmas break,"Utter bliss staycation - went with our family for a Christmas break during Covid. IT was a dream to get away to this amazing hotel and enjoy all the facilities at a social distance. The pool was a huge hit for the kids - we went every day!! 
the walks around are amazing and the golf at our doorstep was a blessing too! ",5,2021,01,05
238,Christmas ,"This was our 3rd visit to Druids Glen and the 2nd time we’ve stayed at Christmas. The Covid measures in place are very good and we felt safe. Someone else commented about staff entering the room on Christmas Day without our permission which we also noticed and was very concerning. We were told about 24th turn down but NOT 25th!This visit though was tainted for us by a couple of things. Some decor in the rooms and carpets are beginning to look tired and worn. There was a complete mess up with our St Stephen’s day booking for the evening meal where they put us in the bar with a bar menu when we’d paid for the all inclusive package. No apology or free drink offered at all which I was surprised at. This is something a hotel should always do. (See Ritz Carlton). Our meal was booked for 6.30, we were eventually given a table a 7 and only had dessert at 9.30 which was hard for 2 kids to cope with. On the 27th breakfast the milk was off and again no apology at all from the small Asian waiter. At one other breakfast we didn’t get offered tea, coffee or toast and the table was missing butter, jam and milk. There is a massive gulf in staff this time. Pawal, Simone and the clean shaven guy at the front desk were amazing and when they were around things felt calm but some of the other staff on reception including the young guy and in the restaurant really need more training. They have no conversation skills and clearly don’t enjoy their role. We missed the control Barbara brings to breakfast. Big tip Druids Glen.....please train your staff to look happy, to look like they want to work there, to engage with customers, to be proactive in resolving problems and to make us feel special.",4,2020,12,30
238,Pre Xmas Escape,"Lucky to get a family trip in between Covid lockdowns . First time visiting and defo will be back.  Check in service was very quick with lovely warm welcome. Covid precautions were excellent and everything signposted clearly. Rooms were fantastic, great size and had everything we needed. We ate in the bar both nights and food was incredible. Service did lack on both nights but I assume that was linked to Covid and staffing levels but defo could be improved. Breakfast options were great and again covid precautions were excellent but again similar point on service it could have been better in terms of getting items ordered to the table. Leisure centre was lovely but sauna and jacuzzi still not open with Covid. My wife had a spa treatment and said it was the best she's had! All in all a well needed break after a horrible year hope to visit again in 2021",4,2020,12,29
238,Christmas 2020,"Christmas 2020, the staff were very friendly and helpful.
They did go out of their way to provide Vegan dining options.
However there was no hot water in the bathroom and the heating system did not work ( we were cold )
 A Dimplex plug in heater was provided.
Also in line with Covid restrictions no housekeeping was to take place for the duration of our stay  - but housekeeping did enter our room on Xmas day without our consent ",4,2020,12,28
238,Christmas Break,"My Girlfriend and I were planning a night away together between Christmas and New Year but due to Covid 19 restrictions we had to cancel. At the last minute Druid’s Glen were able to book us in and it couldn’t of been a better stay. The room was spacious and clean, the staff were very helpful and we would recommend this Hotel at Christmas time in particular for couples. ",5,2020,12,25
238,What a let down!,Food and wine selection was a major let down. The staff are lovely but the dinner was abysmal. Starters were cold. Both mains were sent back. Desserts were less than average. This did not feel like a 5* hotel whatsoever. The breakfast the next day was also horrible. The grounds are nice and the location is good too. Front lobby is cosy but I would not return nor recommend.,2,2020,12,25
238,"Beautifully, warm and cheerful !","Highly recommend. So warm and comfortable. Staff are really genuine too and so helpful! We got engaged that day and they sent up chocolates and a card to the room. It’s the little things!
I would 100% stay again and it’s in such a beautiful setting too.",5,2020,12,21
238,Absolute pleasure to stay,"The place is extremely welcoming and i have never experienced better staff than at Druids Glen. Look forward to going back.
Atmosphere was great
Rooms and facilities were warm and comfortable.
Very enjoyable stay.",5,2020,12,21
238,Just perfect! ,"Our first time staying at Druids. Wow. We just loved it. 2 nights away with our boys after lockdown and it was bliss. Staff were so friendly and helpful. The hotel was beautifully decorated for Christmas. It felt safe with Covid too. Sanitiser everywhere, one way directions and everyone wearing masks when moving around the hotel. Well done! 

The food was yummy and drinks were spot on. Our room was fab and our boys were particularly delighted with their own kiddie sized robes for the pool. A lovely touch. 

Our older son played his ukulele a few times during our stay and got lots of positive comments from staff and other residents - made an 8 year olds day. 

It was just a brilliant stay overall. I didn’t want to leave. Thank you Druids. We have booked again. so see you on the 3rd Jan 🙌🏻😍🎄🎊 ",5,2020,12,16
238,Amazing Night Away,"Just back from a lovely night away at Druids Glen. From the moment we were greeted at the front door to the time we left earlier today everyone was so warm and personable and nothing was too much trouble. We've stayed a few times before so I was curious to see how things would be handled around Covid 19 but I need not have given it a second thought. Apart from the discreetly placed hand sanitiser and the wearing of masks it's really business as normal for this beautiful hotel which was also fabulously decorated for Christmas. The rooms are amazing, even down to the products. We ate in the bar instead of Hugos for a change (although Hugos is gorgeous if you want something a bit more formal) and it was delicious. A lovely drinks menu made things even better! The cosy seating areas in the foyer are beautiful too and a lovely place to read a book or have a coffee or glass of wine. 
Can't wait to return to return to Druids Glen soon.",5,2020,12,06
238,Our perfect wedding in the most perfect venue,"Wow! We have just had our lockdown wedding in Druids Glen and we were completely blown away by it. We had obviously viewed the hotel and had our tasting so we knew we were choosing the right venue. But nothing can prepare you for the level of service that is provided on the day. The staff were amazing - shout out to Eoin and Pawel, so helpful and even remembered most of the guests names! The food was incredible and everyone commented on how nice the mulled wine was. 
We cannot thank and praise Nessa, the wedding coordinator, enough. Throughout the entire process, she kept us at ease and was so helpful with all our requests. We put our trust in her and she couldn't have delivered a more perfect day for us. We literally could not find one thing we would've done different. 
For the photos, not only have you the gorgeous interior (especially when it's dark outside and the lights are on), but you have the amazing grounds also. The beds were extremely comfortable and we had requests to find out where the pillows were sourced from.
If you are considering a wedding of any size, then look no further than Druids Glen. We cannot wait to visit again and again throughout the years.",5,2020,11,27
238,Beautiful Hotel & Amazing Staff,"I stayed in Druids Glen Hotel a number of weeks ago. We had the most wonderful weekend and were incredibly well looked after. The food exceeded my expectations and was delicious. Really creative menus and something for everyone. The breakfast was top notch as well. We ate in Hugo’s restaurant on the 1st night and in The Garden Room & Bar on the 2nd night. We also felt very safe with all of the COVID transmission worries. The hotel had a really impressive safety protocol in place. 

Lots to do in the local area and some lovely scenic drives. The Spa treatments were a treat also.

Overall, I would absolutely recommend Druids Glen Hotel & Golf Resort. ",5,2020,10,18
238,Fabulous Anniversary Weekend ,"Myself and my husband stayed at this stunning hotel for 3 days to celebrate our wedding anniversary. I cannot compliment the hotel and the staff enough, it really did live up to our expectations. I would particular like to thank Stephen the Guest Relations Manager for the lovely little touches he added to our stay. We enjoyed meals in the bar & restaurant which have excellent standards around Covid 19 precautions, we felt very safe and the staff really played a blinder, in particular a lovely waitress called Yasmin. The spa is lovely and the treatments are top class, the pedicure I had from Erica was probably one of the best I have ever had. 

I cannot wait to return and would recommend to anyone wishing to stay, your only a 10 minute drive from the beach and the walk along the golf course is also really worth while. ",5,2020,10,18
238,"First visit, but won't be the last!","My wife and I have just returned from a very pleasant mid week stay at this beautiful hotel. All staff we encountered couldn't have been more pleasant and helpful. Hugo's restaurant was closed but the dinner we had in the bar dining area was superb, my Ribeye being cooked exactly as ordered, which is not always the case! 
There is a one way system marked on the floor throughout the main lobby area and in the breakfast dining area and social distancing is strictly adhered to.
Our room - 328 - was very large and comfortable and the bed and bedding were just superb. I sometimes have a problem sleeping in hotels, but not in that bed. I enjoyed 2 great nights sleep.
The grounds are fantastic and very well kept. I counted 3 gardeners at work cutting grass and blowing leaves on our walk.
All in all we had a very enjoyable stay and have no hesitation in recommending this very fine hotel.",5,2020,10,16
238,Very Disappointing ,"We stayed here recently and to say the stay was a disappointment is an understatement.

We were a family of four, two adults, a 14 year old girl (who we paid full price for) and a 1 year old.

We arrived to the hotel for 3 pm after being in Glendalough for the afternoon, we had swimming booked for four, so grabbed a quick bit of lunch before our swim session. The lunch menu was average and the food more so, we barely touched anything. The staff seemed very unknowledgeable when we enquired as to our seating for our dinner booking at 6, so we continued on for our swim.

The pool facilities were great and well managed.

We dressed and arrived for dinner to be greeted by the same menu, we had seen earlier, both my husband I ordered steak and the 14 year old ordered pizza and chips off the child’s menu. The food arrived extremely swiftly, too swift if the food was to be cooked freshly? The child’s pizza was completely inedible, the steaks were barley warm and the overall quality of food was atrocious. It was completely below standard and worse than “pub grub”. The best part about the dinner was the baby bowl of mash potato. 

We just about ate the steaks as we were famished, due to the poor lunch earlier.

We then had some drinks in the lobby and retired to our room. We then had to order room service as the 14 year was still hungry, as the pizza was inedible. We waited over an hour for the room service. I understand the restaurant with it’s simple menu may have been busy but this should have been advised upon ordering.

Myself and my husband eat out a lot and stay in hotels often, I have never been so displeased with the quality and service. We went down to have a nice weekend and escape the city. We spent approx €750 on the room, food and drink, spending the amount of money is not the issue, but I do expect quality and to enjoy what I am eating.

Your hotel is expected to rise to its star of standard and quite frankly you were well below it.

Would not recommend and will not revisit! ",2,2020,10,15
238,"""Amazing"" 5* all the way!!","From the time of arriving to departure it was an amazing experience. 
From the reception and porter staff, to the restaurant staff ( big call out to Katie) who was very friendly and welcoming, also to call out the lovely waiter we had when we dining in Hugo's Restaurant on the Saturday night, can' t remember his name think it was (Sovia) to the fantastic Spa staff they were so helpful and went over and beyond. The hotel was very safe and comfortable with all the Covid measures in place. The room was lovely and big and had all the amenities. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a lovely get away, will certainly be back, thanks you all !!!",5,2020,10,14
238,Above and Beyond,"Where do I start, from the minute we walked in the doors at Druid's Glen we were given the 5 star treatment.
From the amazing facilities: pool & treatment Spa to the lobby & lounge area, The rooms and the restaurant were also of the highest stranded, and the food and wine was outstanding. 
All the members of staff were happy and ready to assist at any time during our stay.
I would highly recommend Druid's Glen and will definitely be returning.",5,2020,10,13
238,5 Star Pure Bliss,"From the first minute we entered the Foyer, we were greeted by a very friendly receptionist she made us feel at home immediately  our room had being upgraded  as we were celebrating our Ruby wedding anniversary Every place was spotless and staff were excellent Meals were exquisite We felt very safe in the hotel with the standard of hygiene especially around covid concern excellent location easy to find we will definitely be back",5,2020,10,12
238,Luxury hotel with excellent staff and golf facilities,"Arrived tired after a long  drive for our first visit to this hotel. We were met at reception by Adrienne who was so helpful and genuine and immediately made us feel very welcome..... before we knew it our check in was complete. This quiet, friendly and relaxed efficiency was evident everywhere throughout our stay. Itwasn’t as if we requested anything out of the ordinary, but all our requests were met and dealt with in the same great manner and with a smile.

The facilities are certainly luxurious, very clean, and everything has been adapted around Covid measures so there is a feeling of safety and spaciousness for guests to enjoy throughout the hotel. The lobby area for example, though a large double height space, always felt cosy with lots of comfy chairs and couches which were in use throughout the day. 

I wouldn’t be the best swimmer but the pool here was large, lovely and warm, and with controlled numbers every hour so I swam every day and enjoyed it.

The golf facilities are exceptional and I have given them a separate review.

Our room was very spacious with a great view over a very challenging golf teebox.......everything was spotless, the bathroom luxurious with L’occitane touletries and the fluffiest of robes. The bed was  very comfortable with crisp white linen. 

Breakfasts most enjoyable, homemade soda bread delicious ( got the recipe!) and we ate in both the bar and restaurant for evening meals, and can recommend them both.

Prices in the restaurants are what you would expect for a 5 star hotel ( but maybe somebody mightt take a look at the pricing on the wine list which even for a 5 star seemed a bit steep and was our only quibble) but the hotel offers exceptional value 2 night b&b and one dinner midweek deals so I can highly recommend overall.

I would return in a heartbeat.

Thanks Druid’s Glen!",5,2020,10,11
238,Wonderful stay,"Had a wonderful stay here from start to finish the staff were very friendly and polite 
We got a great deal that included dinner and a bottle of processco.
We also went to the spa which was an excellent experience, ",5,2020,10,06

238,Wonderful short stay,"We stayed here last night for one night.. family of 3. Got a great Friday deal with dinner included and a bottle of Prosecco! On arrival it was clear they had Covid restrictions under control! Staff to direct you.. markings on floors., all very clear and we felt very safe immediately on arrival. Rooms spotless and fresh. Dinner in Hugo’s was fab as always.. staff all very attentive and friendly.. service impeccable. Breakfast was lovely and again the covid protocols explained very well and the breakfast area was flowing smoothly. Staff again very attentive and friendly. We had a pool slot pre booked... our first time in a pool since pre covid. They had it worked out very well.. everyone was given an area to go to and generally people stayed in one area of the pool. 
Overall another lovely stay at druids glen.. looking forward to returning.",5,2020,10,03
238,Wonderful stay from start to finish,"We recently visited the Druids Glen for an overnight stay and could not speak more highly of our experience. Our room was fabulous - clean, beautifully appointed and comfortable. All of the staff encountered throughout our stay were so lovely, being professional and personable. We had a beautiful evening meal in the bar where the seafood chowder was just amazing! The swimming pool was clean and well maintained. We also enjoyed afternoon tea on our second day there, which was very relaxing and had beautiful views. All covid-19 measures were in place and staff went above and beyond to ensure guest safety. However, the measures did not detract from the stay in any way and were executed perfectly. The service at dinner, breakfast and afternoon tea was efficient and so friendly. We highly enjoyed our stay and will be back, hopefully very soon 🙂",5,2020,09,29
238,Unforgettable weekend.,"Go to the Druids Glen. Every part of the hotel is exquisite. The food at breakfast, in the bar and the restaurant were amazing. The room was beautiful with an amazing view. I haven't seen customer service like it. Thank you for the perfect weekend. We will be returning.",5,2020,09,28
238,Great spot,Had a lovely 3 day break here with a round of golf and a spa treatment. Staff were extremely friendly and efficient. Food was lovely. Different experience due to the Covid restrictions as all dining etc had to be booked in advance but I thought the hotel were very well organised and it felt very safe.,5,2020,09,26
238,Best hotel experience I ever had,"We booked our stay incorrectly and the hotel desk were so helpful and friendly and sorted it all for us, staff were so nice and willing to help in any way, we decided to eat in the clubhouse and the front desk organised a car to bring us down and then the waitress ordered one back up when we had finished which was so handy, the dinner was one of the best I’ve ever had and breakfast was so so good as well, the pool was very nice as well as the room which was huge and clean. 100% would recommend and will definitely be back!",5,2020,09,25
238,5 star service,"We stayed one night here to celebrate our wedding anniversary. The staff in Druids Glen are fantastic and provided us with excellent service during our stay. Eoin in particular was friendly and helpful during check in and check out. 
Our bedroom was spacious and the bed was very comfortable. We ate in Hugo's restaurant and made our reservation prior to our arrival. The food was delicious and we were provided with a special dessert to recognise our anniversary which was a nice touch. 
The hotel is very safe and compliant with the COVID-19 regulations. The bar does not currently provide a drinks only service but guests can order drinks in the lobby area and there is plenty of space.
I would highly recommend this hotel. You won't be disappointed.",5,2020,09,25
238,Staycation,Excellent 2m distancing and hand sanitising facilities on arrival . I felt very safe. Minor details to improve service. Cocktails should be served in cocktail glass not a wine glass. Chocolate brownie sundae would be nicer served hot and in a glass rather than cold in a bowl. (Maybe that’s my personal preference) room service presentation could be improved for 5 star hotel. Room very clean and sanitised. Overall lovely hotel but minor details as above are expected for high quality 5 star hotel.,4,2020,09,24
238,Beautiful stay well recommended for 5 star dinning stay ,"Stayed here for 3 days . Like anyone the new rules wearing masks , pre booking all
Your meals etc takes a bit to get used to it. the hotel is very well prepared for Covid 19 safety , you feel very safe.

Rooms are lovely my only negative is bathrooms are a bit dated but other than that all great .

Food is the best , absolutely stunning. We eat every night in Hugo’s and well I was surprised by the quality , one of the best restaurants I have eaten in . 
Bar food again is excellent really great quality 

What makes this hotel is all
Of the above but the staff .
They are the best ,  so so friendly , always says hello no matter  what you ask never to
Much . It’s a Rare thing to get staff that are the best all of them so an amazing job so well 
Big shout our to Jennifer she was the best  from organised our meals to pool
Etc and then having a friendly chat so with us daily when She would see us . She was the best . 
Also Lillia in the restaurant. 
Can’t wait to get back whenever that may be ",5,2020,09,24
238,Slightly overpriced but a fabulous hotel,"Stayed September 2020 so during the pandemic. Our room was really big and really nice. I found all staff very friendly and helpful. We had a couple of hiccups, we ordered a couple of mojitos that were undrinkable but they were changed for us. The 2nd round weren't great but they were drinkable. I also ordered a rare steak but what I got was more on the way to well done. It was still extremely tasty and the manager did offer to change but I just kept it as it was nice and I was already half way through. These are minor things and I was impressed that these mistakes were rectified.
Lovely grounds to walk around 
Had a massage in the spa that was excellent too",4,2020,09,23
238,Relaxing and Luxury Experience,"This was our second stay at Druid's Glen and we will definitely be recommending it to our friends and family.

The rooms are beautiful, kept to a very high standard of cleanliness, and have everything you would want for a relaxing stay. The toiletries are L'Occitane and all of the finishing touches add to the luxury experience.

The food at Hugo's has both times been delicious, but even better is that the staff are very attentive to your needs.

Golf fans will need to make sure they play this course, and it is one of the most scenic and beautiful I have tagged along for. I am not a golfer myself, but joined my partner both times and thoroughly enjoyed it for the scenery, despite not playing myself. 

In short, if you're looking for a luxury staycation in Ireland, you won't be disappointed if you choose Druid's Glen. Perfect for a family or a couple stay, with little need to venture elsewhere meaning you can truly soak in the relaxation.",5,2020,09,22
238,Brilliant Stay!,Mother/Daughter trip which went off without a problem. The spa was incredible - great massages and lunch included which was also lovely. Comfiest mattress I’ve ever slept on - I’ll be back just for that. Great hotel and already looking forward to my next stay! ,5,2020,09,22
238,Perfect might away,"Everything was perfect, atmosphere, location, dinner was incredible and drinks! The room is beautiful and staff were so kind and accommodating! Couldn't recommend more! 
Beautiful hotel, pool was gorgeous!",5,2020,09,20
238,Fab hotel - food disappointing,Fab hotel very reaxing- give the breakfast and bar food a miss! My previous experience was much better but the quality of food for breakfast and dinner was very poor. The bar menu is really limited and breakfast was a huge disappointment! ,4,2020,09,20
238,Birthday weekend ,"This was a 30th birthday weekend for my son and our family. We took 3 double rooms (one a family room for 2 children).
We arrived early (about 10) in time for golf. Reception arranged 2 rooms immediately. They also gave a free upgrade to a suite for the birthday boy.
We had a wonderful week end. The staff were great, the rooms were comfortable, and the Covid measures were appropriate.
We ate the first night in the casual dining area and this was fine. But the second night we ate in Hugo’s. Sadly the food was significantly sub-standard; definitely avoid the duck - it either died of old age or was made of rubber. Stick to the casual dining.
The boys played both golf courses, and loved it.
All in all, an enjoyable stay.@",4,2020,09,20
238,Completely average ,"Popped in today for some lunch after a flying lesson down the road. It’s all just.... average inoffensive and boring. Hard to describe. A bit like a 4* airport hotel. Everything was okay but that my point. It’s in no way 5*, too many hotels like this now. We would be really disappointed if we had booked to stay the night. Much better in the area. ",3,2020,09,19
238,The Perfect Post Lockdown Retreat !,"We spent a wonderful 2 night break at this lovely hotel at the end of August and it definitely lived up to it's 5 star status in every way. We found the service and food in the bar area and in the breakfast room second to none.  We wish to thank all the hard working staff during these difficult times for the great service as they are working flat out all the time to keep us the guest safe during these strange times.  We did acknowledge this in the bar with a tip after our meal on the first night.

A special mention to Colm in the breakfast room who was working flat out all the time clearing and preparing tables and also to the German lady that managed the breakfast room. There is a buffet on offer for breakfast but you can also order poached eggs or omelettes at your table all included in the breakfast.  

The hospitality sector is a very tough industry to be in especially dealing with the demands of the public is not always easy.   The staff deserve a lot of respect and a big thank you especially during times like these when their workloads have increased and their jobs are more challenging now.

We found the service very professional and friendly in all areas, the hotel is 5 star and offers a true 5 star experience without any heirs or graces which we found very relaxing and refreshing.  

We were so lucky with the weather and really enjoyed our walk around the golf course.  This was just the perfect break for us we cannot  recommend the hotel and the Staff and Management highly enough.",5,2020,09,19
238,Book the Spa early,"The resort is well located although a bit out of the way.  If you addres a golfer you will relish this course. If you aren't you will enjoy the facilities. Book the spa early before you travel as it books out quickly with day clients which is not fair on staying guests who often lose out. There pool can be full during the day so early morning settings are recommended. And the food is excellent.  Plenty to see and visit locally with Roundwood, Greystones and the majestic Glendalough an easy short drive away. Themid week special is great value. ",4,2020,09,19
238,Fantastic hotel,"Stayed for 2 nights with a friend. Enjoyed the break so much that I booked again for October. Staff went over and beyond to make us feel welcome and where so friendly. It is obvious that they love their job. Food was amazing, fresh food and plenty to choose from. We both had spa treatments and again this was amazing. Plenty of sanitisers and one way system around the hotel, we felt very safe. All in all a super hotel. Cannot wait to go back.",5,2020,09,18
238,Amazing relaxing break,"Just returned home from an amazing 2 night stay in Druid’s Glen, and can’t wait to return. Everything was amazing from the modern and relaxing hotel lobby area to the immaculate fine dining available in both restaurants in the hotel.

Our room was very spacious with two large beds and also an amazing view out onto the golf course. Dining in the restaurant across all meals from breakfast to dinner were amazing and found the varied menu between Hugo’s restaurant and the Garden Bar to be a perfect mix. I also played golf on one of the days on the Druid’s glen course and it deserves a review in itself - the course is in perfect condition and is a joy to look at at this time of year!

The staff were also very friendly and attentive at all times to the needs of all guests - a special shout out also to the manager Aidan who came out to have a chat with both myself and my partner! We are already counting down to our next visit!",5,2020,09,17
238,Great Hotel,"Had a fantastic stay in Druids Glen. Staff were all very friendly and welcoming, rooms and facilities were to a very high standard and all meals were delicious. Would highly recommend for both couples and families. ",5,2020,09,17
238,Everything you need in one location,"Best hotel experience we have had in Ireland. Staff , food, location , golf, spa. Absolutely everything was a first class experience. From first booking down to the moment we left everything was super friendly and of top quality. We had an amazing room with the comfiest of beds and not a sound to be heard. The food was amazing. Felt so safe and protected in these strange times , i think I may even prefer the ease of dining and table service in our new for now normal",5,2020,09,16
238,Lovely stay,Very nice stay here recently. Lovely spacious rooms and delicious food in the restaurant for all meals. Nice relaxed atmosphere. Only downside was the pillows were too soft for my liking if that is even a downside. ,4,2020,09,15
238,Excellent as Always!,"This is my 3rd stay at Druids Glen and it's always a pleasure to stay here. The staff are friendly, helpful and inviting. The food is delicious and  resort itself and facilitates are great. Would highly recommend and will definitely return. ",5,2020,09,14
238,Staycation in Druid's Glen ,"My family and I stayed recently for two nights in this beautiful hotel while attending a Wedding. 
Check in was smooth and efficient and the front desk staff were very welcoming.

We were fortunate enough to be upgraded to a superior family room and discovered a few treats waiting for us on arrival, courtesy of the General Manager, which was a wonderful surprise.

The food and service at both the Wedding and the restaurant was first class and we found the staff to be professional yet friendly.

In my opinion the Hotel has implemented and adhered to a strict COVID policy and this is evident in the cleanliness of the public areas throughout the hotel. There was also plenty of hand gel available and the Hotel encouraged guests to wear face coverings.

It is necessary to book a slot for the pool which lasts 40 minutes and we found the pool area spotlessly clean and the water was the perfect temperature. 

Overall we really enjoyed our stay here and we look forward to returning in the near future. I would highly recommend a staycation in the amazing Druid's Glen. ",5,2020,09,13
238,cannot recommend,"I  picked this hotel based on its 5 star rating. I am a carer to an elderly relative and needed peace of mind that I was staying somewhere where covid  hygiene was a priority. How wrong I was.
Check in was at best a 2 star experience. One person on check in desk. Took us twenty minutes to check in. of which fifteen minutes was spent queuing. This with only the one guest at the desk when we arrived and one couple ahead of us. So bad that a porter came across to apologise and stated that ""seems like everyone arrives to check in at once"".  At least he was being polite.  There were only three sets of us as already stated. here's a novel idea... put two people at the check in desk! Especially as you cannot check in until 4pm. This was 5pm. When do they expect that people will arrive to check in. 5 star indeed?????
After being in the room for about twenty to twenty five mins I went to make a cup of tea. To my horror  it was obvious that one of  the mugs on the hostess tray had been used and unwashed. ( see photos)  It makes one wonder how well cleaned the rest of the room was. 
 I took it, in a disinfectant wipe, to reception and asked if this was five star. I requested new mugs and glasses. I must say the girl on reception was speechless. Being fair, she obviously showed the mug to the Duty Manage,r because about a half hour later he arrived at the door of the room. We were offered that the room be deep cleaned  while we went to our dinner . We refused this as we had at this stage ourselves already  cleaned all flat surfaces and all contact points with disinfectant wipes.  ( again so much for 5 star) and we were in the room and all our things were in the room and I didn't want someone in the room when we weren't there. (is that not the whole point at the moment?). Anyhow what were we supposed to do for the next hour and a half until our dinner reservation I don't know. . My Husband again requested fresh mugs , glasses and cutlery. Some time later we got two mugs and two glasses ( no saucers or spoons) .  I could go on and on, for example - Chairs not wiped down after use, Trays only wiped on top and not underneath where you take them in your hand. The whole experience was ruined, as I was watching everything . They really need to up their game. Overall the standard and level of care and service was dreadful and most certainly not worthy of any establishment which claims to be 5 star. Anyhow we won't be back and could not possibly recommend this place to anyone.",1,2020,09,12
238,In no way is this hotel deserving of a five star rating.,"At a recent stay we were shocked to find used, unwashed mugs on the tray in our room along with cobwebs hanging from the ceiling.  Room inspection prior to letting is a joke. Also very unhappy with the level of or more accurately lack of proper cleaning of all contact points re Covid precautions. Management of the property should hang their heads in shame.",1,2020,09,12
238,Staycation,"We recently stayed for 2 nights in Druids Glen. Every thing was lovely from the set dining times and one way system we felt very safe during these times. The spa treatments were amazing. The exotic hot coconut wrap was the nicest treatment I have ever had. 
On both nights we received a bottle of processco delivered to our room complimentary.
We will definitely come back.
Edel on reception was extremely kind and sorted me with some feminine products. All staff were polite and friendly.
Thank you.",5,2020,09,12
238,Great Staycation,"Excellent four days in Druids Glen. Lovely hotel with great staff. The staff made the COVID precautionary measures easy to understand. 

 Druids Glen golf course is simply breathtaking. The natural beauty of the estate is amazing. ",5,2020,09,10
238,Not 5 star.,"Brought my Mam down for the night last night as a birthday present because she always goes on about how great Druids glen is. We arrived down the room was nice, standard enough and  we got lunch in the bar and it was really nice. From there expectations dropped. I had booked myself into the pool a few days before saying I wanted to use the jacuzzi, no one bothered to mention the jacuzzi can't be run so I arrived down to no jacuzzi/sauna/steam room. Which I assume is due to COVID but Given I had asked about it just 3-4 days before I would assume I could've been told and I would've booked a spa treatment. 

Went for dinner.. my Mam previously raves about the food and after lunch I had high expectations. I ordered the Rigatoni.... it was literally plain pasta with cherry tomatoes and a tiny bit of Parmesan... could've made it better myself. Waste of money. The bar food was definetely much better and I wouldn't waste money on the ""5 star restaurant""

After dinner we went to try sit down and have a drink... all the tables were reserved in the lobby bar one at the front door which was uncomfortable and cold again... no music. No entertainment. Uncomfortable to sit around and we ended up back in the room by 10... 

Breakfast was quite unimpressive. Arrived down and was led to the bar as the restaurant was too full.... put on 2 couches with tables that were slightly taller than a coffee table. We told the server it was really cold and she said she'd close the windows. We went to get food and when I tried to order poached eggs I was told to wait till I got back to my table. Brought the food back... pudding is to be avoided ... greasy mush... got back to the table... ordered the eggs. Room was too cold so we asked to be moved 5 mins later we were brought into the restaurant which was a 1/3 full. The server said they'd move everything from our table in the bar into the restaurant. By the time that was sorted the food was cold and my Mam ended up going back up to get food. I've been to hostels with better service. My Mam was unhappy and looked to speak with a restaurant manager who didn't Care. 

Overall, my first visit to Druids glen was not worth the money. I don't get the hype. Definetely not 5 star. If you want a good spa holiday I'd say Farnham or seafield. Only good thing about the trip was time spent in good company with my Mam!",2,2020,09,06
238,Worth every penny,"Stayed at druids glen for a birthday celebration recently, staff went above and beyond to ensure it was marked in excellent style. Staff are truly lovely throughout, we enjoyed excellent professionally delivered massage in the spa. The food and staff were excellent with adherence to covid hygiene obvious throughout, the smoked salmon starter particularly delicious. Room was absolutely fantastic supplied with beautiful toiletries. I will definitely go back, some commented that it was very expensive well it was our experience that you got what you paid for and then some more. I would without hesitation recommend this hotel. Thank you all so very much.

Sharon",5,2020,09,06
238,Our little Big Day !!,"My wife and I stayed at the Druids Glen for 5 days in late August. We were joined by close family and friends and got married in the Oscar Wilde suite in a humanistic ceremony during our stay.

The hotel staff and management could not have been more helpful or accommodating. In particular, Nessa, Orlaigh, Eoighan and Pawvel were amazing dealing with the many hurdles that presented themselves due to COVID restrictions and storm Ellen, there are many other members of the team but I cannot recall their names, thank you.

Aidan (resort manager/ director) was incredible throughout our stay and his professionalism and charismatic approach was noted by all our guests. 

The food throughout our stay was exceptional including the day of the wedding and although we were only a small party in numbers, our many special dietary request were met to the full satisfaction of all ( gluten free, vegan, plain eaters). 

The hotel is set on vast woodland estate with two world class golf courses and nice walk ways that are easy to follow from the hotel door , the complimentary umbrellas were a great addition one morning. I played golf on the Glen course and the man in the pro shop could not have been more accommodating. The green fees were very reasonable and in my opinion the course played better than any in the country. I was enviously viewed the many golfers who passed by our suite window over the course of our stay as I didn’t get to play again.

As we were busy with the guests we did not visit the spa but were informed that it was extremely busy which indicates it’s credibility. The pool and gym was open with restrictions but was easy to access through booking.

Our wedding day (week) that looked like a mission impossible was made possible because of Nessa and Aiden. From the outset Nessa was so helpful with arranging photographers, florists, make people and everything for us locally, on the day she was again amazing. Aidan and his team worked through power outages caused by the storms to deliver an amazing day and he even ensured that all the hair and make up was in order by setting up a pop up salon in a back room. 
Some oversees guest could not attend but the hotel were very helpful setting up and letting us have these people attend through video link. Again thank you !!

 
This venue is the perfect location for either a small intimate wedding like ours or a larger gathering. It has customer service at its core with professionalism and charm at the forefront. We will definitely continue to visit this Wicklow diamond.",5,2020,09,04
238,Not a 5 star hotel,"Very comfortable bed and spacious bathroom. However, the food was extremely poor and the experience in the restaurant wasn't good. 1 hour wait between courses, extremely warm and an unromantic setting. The quality of breakfast was also very poor. No finesse in the hotel to warrant 5 stars. Basically if you're a couple on your own I'd stay well clear of the dining options. ",3,2020,09,03
238,Great staycation ,"Just finished a two night stay with my wife.
We availed of the 'Fall into Autumn' deal, which was great value.
Received excellent service from all staff. Sadly couldn't remember everyone's name.
Marc and Lee on front desk were extremely accommodating and Aiden the GM.

Social distancing and 1 way systems make you feel as safe as you can. Masks worn when moving around the hotel.
Very good breakfast setup to deal with large volumes safely. The hostess (German accent) was very nice and I'm sure she's sick to dead of advising every single person of the one way system.

Played druids heath. Course was in get condition.

Will definitely look to come back. Maybe Christmas. ",5,2020,09,02
238,Amazing Celebration,"As always a wonderful stay.

Thank you for making this trip extra special and the family who visited with us for the first time will be back.

The staff are always so friendly and everywhere is spotlessly clean.

We have stayed a couple of times during the Covid restrictions and the work they are doing here is excellent.

Breakfast is excellent and works very well.

Druids Glen is so relaxing and homely you dont want to leave and look forward to visiting again. Once again I cant fault anything.",5,2020,09,01
238,Staycation,My husband and I toured Ireland for one week. The druids glen hotel being our last stay. We found the staff in the bar area and restaurant very pleasant and friendly. The food in the restaurant in our opinion was over rated and at €25.50 for a chicken dish minus vegetables was not acceptable. The Hungarian girl seemed rushed off her feet but very professional and friendly.The breakfast in the morning was very nice and well managed by the staff.,3,2020,08,29
238,lovely,We had such a lovely stay in this hotel. The staff were really great. We loved the food and we will definitely be back to this hotel for a relaxing weekend in the very near future. Keep up the good work,5,2020,08,28
238,Nice Stay,"Had a nice 3 night stay as a family Sunday to Wednesday. First impressions not good as check in was hectic and room was not ready even though we were late arriving. There were other minor service issues with a restaurant booking but staff did make efforts to resolve our complaints. 

We had no problems getting meal bookings and swimming pool slots throughout our stay. Family room was big and clean with lots of room for the 4 of us. Kids toiletries and robes a nice touch and they also enjoyed the dvd library. Breakfast was nice, not a huge selection but tasty and no delays. The bar food was only ok and there is only a small menu to allow for quick turnaround required by Covid regs. We had afternoon tea one day which we was very nice. 

We enjoyed our stay and will return but I do feel that the service was not the same as I experienced on a previous stay most likely as there was not enough staff for the number of guests. ",4,2020,08,27
238,Beautiful hotel and amazing friendly staff,"I've never written a review of anywhere before but felt compelled to on this occasion in order to recognise the staff for how well we were looked after. The booking process was excellent and the girl who I spoke to at reception on the 16th of August in the early afternoon was so helpful. She planned our entire stay to a tee with an evening meal, breakfast, swim and spa. I told her the reason we were staying was to celebrate my girlfriend's 30th birthday. She said that she would make sure chocolates were sent to the room. I thought no more of it but an hour after check in there was chocolates and a happy birthday card sent up which was a really nice touch. 

Upon arrival the receptionist (Lee) was really helpful in answering all our questions and was so friendly in chatting to us. He was actually there the following morning too when we were going for breakfast and we chatted about the champions league final from the night before. A really nice guy. 

The girl who served us in the restaurant (a girl from Hungary whose name unfortunately escapes me) was exceptional. She was very pleasant and gave great recommendations. She also organised a complimentary dessert with happy birthday written in chocolate on the plate for my girlfriend which was a really lovely touch.

Breakfast was lovely. A huge choice and the girls working there were really friendly and completely professional. 

We had the residents special spa package which I think represents fantastic value at €99. My therapist Rachel was absolutely fantastic and so professional. My girlfriend said her girl was brilliant too but I unfortunately didn't get her name.

I will definitely return in the not too distant future I hope. We said we will try and go with a group of couples and avail of the golf course the next time as well as the spa facilities. Thank you to everyone at druids glen for making our stay so welcoming and memorable.",5,2020,08,25
238,Druids glen,"Relaxing night away one night is plenty. Afternoon tea a little disappointing as service was very slow.
Dinner and breakfast were good and good value too. Lounge area very comfortable nd staff pleasant.
Next time I will try the spa and leisure centre.",4,2020,08,25
238,Huge Disappointment... not a 5* experience ,"If you want a 5* experience you wont get it here. Avoid! 

Prior to booking, we weren’t notified about discounts for HSE frontline workers the company was offering despite me asking about offers/promotions. I later found this out through the parent group website. They also were extremely unhelpful in explaining differences in eating areas and menus. 

The Room-  Paid over 200€ for a nights stay here. The room was fine, fairly average and hard to say it was in anyway more impressive than some 3* properties I have stayed at. Instructions for operating the air con completely out of date, had to get someone up from
reception. 

Dinner- Booked in for dinner in the restaurant in the evening, we were sat at a bar table which was extremely low. We asked to be moved and we were then sat at a table slightly higher table. It was shaking everywhere and very unsteady. It happens, no problem. I notified the bar man who then handed me 5 tissues to resolve this myself.....

We then ordered 2 cocktails at 13€ each, one served in a wine glass because ‘we don’t have a cocktail glass for this’. 

Had a couple of starters which were quite nice.

Ordered the burgers- one chicken and one beef. The beef burger was dry as a bone, extremely bland. I actually think the chicken burger had salt spilt on it , was caked in it. Absolutely awful.

I made sure to raise these concerns in person, I thought it was important to voice my feedback whilst I was there so I did upon checking out. We then spoke with a restaurant manager and voiced these concerns in full and explained how dissatisfied we were. Offered absolutely no resolution except to say he would give us his card if we wanted to book in future, which we of course would not want to do after the experience. 

Nothing about this place is 5* and to top it off the complete lack of recognition/goodwill shown from the company for what was a completely unacceptable level of service was disgraceful.

238,Staycation,Myself and my husband stayed in Druids Glen Resort in early August for 2 nights. Hotel was spotless.. Room and open area well kept. It was very relaxing especially with Covid. My only issue was the dining dinner was fine..but only fine I just felt the staff were really struggling with the whole covid thing.. Just though it would be a better experience.(I have just returned from The Park House Hotel in Galway.. Now they have it so finely tuned). But it was great to be able to have relaxing drink on veranda. I felt they struggled especially with breakfast time. Tables far too close and you have to queue for hot or cold buffet but order eggs at table. This I felt caused a lot of confusion and I was not comfortable with this at all. I really feel they need to relook at how to accommodate people at breakfast as it is not working. Otherwise lovely stay.,3,2020,08,23
238,amazing hotel,we went for a 3 night stay.from the start the check in was easy and our room was ready  the check in clerk gave us the new covid information the rooms are not cleaned every day so you are not interacting with too many people.we went to our room and the basic rooms are very big with 2 large beds and lots of room  the bathroom has a bath and a seperate power shower..lovey toliteries from elmis and La Octaine there  are extra towels and bath robes and slippers for you to use.there is free  water in the room and a fridge which was great..we headed out to explore the area  there is plenty of car spaces and as we had not booked a dinner we decided to get room service it was lovely the staff do not enter your room because of covid but its ok.we had booked breakfast for 9 every morning.the dining room is very well organised  you are shown to your table and the buffet is socially distant with plenty of choice.we had booked a swimming sesion and that was well organises  they only let a small amount of people and all socially distant.there are family and adult times.the lobby bar is service only and you have to have a meal to drink there.which is ok for the times.there is free wi fi in the  hotel and lovely grounds to have a walk on the last night we booked a meal in hugos which is a fantastic restaurant.the staff were brillant for the whole stay and are very well trained and were very nice to deal with.i dont know what i expected in the times we are in from a hotel but i felt very safe in your hotel.all staff were wearing masks or visors i highly recomend,5,2020,08,23
238,More old-fashioned than expected,"A nice hotel that was probably the height of sophistication ten years ago but is quite old-fashioned compared to its luxury counterparts these days. All staff were really friendly and helpful. Social distancing in the pool was well-managed, although it was disappointing not to have access to facilities such as the jacuzzi. The spa experience was quite disappointing -- a very expensive pedicure didn't even last half an hour without smudging. The spa supervisor did offer a touch-up the next day, which was positive, but I was unable to avail of it.",3,2020,08,20
238,Holiday,"Lovely hotel with very nice staff. The views are amazing in hotel. Lovely walks for family to enjoy. 

I found it a bit expensive for what we got. The food was the biggest let down, small portions, under or overcooked. Chicken dish without chicken even in it. 

For golfers, The golf course is amazing.",3,2020,08,20
238,Lovely hotel in nice location ,"We stayed 3 nights in Druids Glen. Overall it was an excellent experience. Pricey but worth it. Staff very friendly, especially Simon in the bar!
Only small problem was shower could be cleaner.
Would stay again.",4,2020,08,20
238,Great Hotel ,"Great Hotel and well run under the current guidelines. They are taking cleanliness and customer safety very seriously and staff are fantastically friendly and reassuring in their attitudes.  Beautiful hotel,wonderful surroundings, and excellent staff. Well run so well done .",5,2020,08,19
238,Great for families ,"The positives here- this hotel is really well equipped for families. Lots to do for children and little extra touches like children’s robes and slippers which ours really enjoyed. The hotel had clearly gone to great lengths to make it a safe experience with covid restrictions too, and the staff were great. I have to say though it didn’t feel to us like a 5 star resort. Some aspects of the room required some upkeep- stains on carpet, dirt in grout of shower, rickety table in bar which we had to use napkins to balance  etc which you wouldn’t expect from a 5 star hotel. All in all we will come back as it was a good experience for the kids. Probably wouldn’t come as two adults though. ",4,2020,08,19
238,Great stay in Wicklow,"My husband and I have just returned from a stay at Druids Glen with our three month old baby. I loved everything about Druids Glen, but in particular, the rooms, and the service from the staff is excellent. Our room was a deluxe suite - was so impressed by the luxury, from the fireplace to the l'Occitane products, it exceeded expectations! We had a cot in the room , but there is also a very useful baby pantry on site for parents should you need anything for your little one(s)! The staff are also amazing, professional without being overbearing. Thank you Druids Glen for a great break. We will be back!",5,2020,08,18
238,Amazing Family Staycation,"We are just back from 3 fabulous nights in Druids Glen. The hotel is well maintained to a very high standard and I would be very picky.Shortly after a smooth check in, I asked if we could be moved to a room with a view of the golf course and it was done in 15 mins. The GM Aidan was extremely helpful and professional, nothing was a problem. We had pre booked our times for breakfast, pool and dinner. When we asked if we could move times of some bookings, all done with ease. The food in Hugo's was amazing. The staff could not do enough for us and made us all feel so welcome. There was 8 of us, 4 adults and 4 children and they really looked after us and our younger fussy eaters. The grounds are beautiful and very well kept. I did not go to the spa but we did use the pool and it was immaculate and well run. All in all one of the best experiences we have had in a hotel in Ireland. I will book another short break there again in October for sure. The Sweeney Family",5,2020,08,18
238,Family break,Really pleasant stay.  Handled the whole Covid element very well.  We always felt very comfortable and looked after.  Very good for kids - driving range and putting green being a particular highlight for them,5,2020,08,17
238,Disappointed - not a 5 star experience ,"Me and my boyfriend visited for my birthday weekend. Not taking away from the fact we had a great weekend, the hotel was extremely disappointing. On arrival we had to switch rooms as we were given a room we didnt book, we had booked our dinner for 8pm originally, the hotel changed us to 8.30pm and we were not seated until after 9pm and didnt have our food until almost 10, I had to send my rare cutlets back as I asked for well done. The service was extremely poor and we were given our wine with no glasses at one point and another tables meal. We spoke to the managers who were very accommodating apologetic and understanding which we appreciated. They told us they would cover our bill but paid for 2 main courses and we had to cover the rest I.e drinks etc. Breakfast was fine but there was similar issues in that the service was extremely poor. The second night was much better service wise as you could tell they had experienced staff on for a saturday night. I would not recommend this hotel for a romantic break as it is an extremely active family hotel. We asked for a late check out and we were firmly told no. I went for a spa treatment and I ordered prosecco and I was never given it. Adrienne, Stephen and Orlaith were very helpful when we voiced our concerns. ",2,2020,08,17
238,Beautiful hotel,"I am sorry I did not leave this review sooner! Stayed here with my partner and baby in March pre covid craziness. Absolutely beautiful hotel with best hotel food I have ever had even in the bar. Delicious cocktails too.

We got upgraded to a suite which has completely spoiled us. Looking forward to return as soon as there is availability!",5,2020,08,14
238,Great family hotel,"With staycation this hotel was great for us as a family. They had all the social distancing in place and the place felt safe.
The kids love the swimming pool (need to book slots). You need to book breakfast too
In the family room there were kids bathrobes and slippers - what a treat for them
The indoor playroom was closed due to covid
We had a great time and hope to go back again",5,2020,08,14
238,Family break ,"Rooms excellent. Went with family of two kids 11 and 12 for three nights. Staff friendly and helpful nothing was too much bother, all wearing masks but unobtrusive. Hand sanitizer everywhere. You have to pre book breakfast, dinner and the pool but this didn't impact in anyway.  Golf course excellent condition.  Only slight negative is that the bar menu did not change. Also the sink in our bedroom was blocked, despite being reported twice had to wait until the next day and reported it again before being fixed, not a 5 star hotel experience. However did not detract from overall experience ",5,2020,08,14
238,August Stay 2020,"Myself and my fiancee checked in her on Monday August 10th everything was absolutely fine with check in went smoothly. 
We went for a quick swim and then headed down to the bar for dinner, food was absolutely fantastic along with the service, however, at times you could see your drinks sitting on the bar before they made there way to your table. At one point a waiter was standing beside our drinks for a good 5 minutes before having to be asked to bring them to the table. We didn't put much pass on this though but be prepared you could be waiting for your drinks.

We went back to our room to relax after dinner and went to turn on our television when I noticed a used plaster on the back of the remote control. I rang down to reception and when the lady answered the phone she was so apologetic and said a manger would ring us straight back, within 5 minutes a manger, Joey, arrived at our door with a new remote but we expressed our concerns about the cleanliness of the room if a used plaster was missed.

Joey offered us a room change which we kindly accepted but things did not improve when we changed rooms and I had to call him back up to the new room as there was food crumbs on the chairs and all over the floor along with receipts from previous guests and hair clips. Joey was very apologetic and said he would get Keith (operations manager) to give us a call the next morning. 

When we got in contact with Keith he was extremely apologetic and very professional in his approach to dealing with the matter which Joey was too when we were dealing with him. 

Keith overseen a deep clean of our room which was badly needed. 

Once these issues were resolved and the room cleaned we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Druids Glen.

So a massive thank you to Joey & Keith.

Also we dined in the hotel bar & restaurant for the time we were there and the food is fantastic.",3,2020,08,14
238,Disappointing Lunch Experience ,"We were really looking forward to visiting Druids Glen for lunch while on a few days break in Wicklow.  I rang and booked lunch for a group of 5 on Monday for the following Thursday at 2pm.  On Thursday morning I rang again to add one more person to the reservation.  The girl I spoke to when I rang was very pleasant and accommodating.  Unfortunately when we arrived the Maitre'D was neither pleasant or accommodating.  She showed us to a table for 4, with a similar sized table next to it. We asked for a different table that would have accommodated 6 people as per our reversation. She suggested we join the nearby table to ours-her exact words were ""ye can push them together "" and she walked away.  One of the party approached her again and requested a table for 6 people as per our booking. She said the restaurant was fully booked and there was nothing she could do. The waitress, Simone, was lovely and helped us to move the two tables together.
We considered leaving but had 3 hungry children with us so this was not an option.  In the meantime two window tables became available and remained so for quite some time.
The waiting staff were very nice. However, 
when we went to pay the bill, which was incorrect, a staff member behind the bar corrected the bill immediately but then asked ""do you want to throw the tip on there or what"". 
We are on holidays from Kerry and realise how important to the local economy tourism is particularly in the current climate. Unfortunately today was an underwhelming and very disappointing experience. ",2,2020,08,13
238,"5 star hotel, almost a 5 star experience","Druids Glen is a nice spot for a family getaway or a couple’s retreat, mainly for its value for money and surrounding natural beauty.
The fire-lit lobby and bar are lovely spots to chill with a drink and play a game of cards. The rooms are very spacious and clean, our superior deluxe bed was a dream.
The five-star element of Druids Glen is undoubtedly Hugo’s Restaurant. The food and customer service were faultless and our 4 course meal here was the highlight of our stay.
The reception staff are friendly and professional, Emma definitely deserves a mention for dealing with what must have been the weirdest check-in experience anyone in the Irish hotel industry has ever experienced. Long story...
The resort falls down in standard dramatically when it comes to waiting staff in the lobby, in the bar and for breakfast. In fact, it ranged between comical and bizarre at times. To make a long story short, waiting for a server to take a drink order in the lobby is like waiting for the second coming of Jesus in the Wicklow Mountains. The waiting staff are friendly and polite but they all seem like it’s their first day on the job when asking residents if they need a drink; we had to actually chase waiters that had walked by us numerous times. On three occasions we were waiting roughly 30 minutes for our orders. At one point we sent our cocktails back because they were completely different to our orders. At breakfast, I asked for a coffee. I got tea.
At the end of the day, these aren’t deal breakers but are they really stories from a 5 star resort?
We enjoyed our stay a lot but the structure of how the waiting staff operate (at the hands of management) definitely needs looking at to make Druids Glen the all round 5 star experience it wants to be, and can be. ",4,2020,08,13
238,Short break in Wicklow,"I really enjoyed my stay at the hotel and my only regret is that I hadn't booked a longer stay.  The hotel had fantastic systems in place to deal with Covid 19, to keep guest safe.  The queue system for breakfast hot and cold buffet were simple but effective. The room was extremely comfortable and clean.  The hot breakfast on both mornings was fantastic.  We had dinner on one night and although it was simple fish and chips it was excellent. Service was also excellent from checkin, to food and drink service.  A very well run hotel and can't wait to go back.  Only suggestion for improvement would be the development of some walks around the beautiful grounds.",5,2020,08,12
238,Average hotel,"Hotel stay was good first two nights, went downhill on the third, service slow with 4 other couples ordering after us and received their food before us. Also was woken with drunk men shouting outside on third night",3,2020,08,11
238,Average,"Stayed at Druids Glen for two nights for a family birthday. Staff are very friendly and rooms very clean. Pre-booked swim and meal times is a must and worked well as hotel busy. Lovely surrounding walking trails.  Plenty of hand sanitising stations which was good. Only a few staff wearing masks or visors but I’m not sure what the policy is on this. In my opinion, overall quality of service and food not five star and having to have drinks in the lobby which has minimal seating is not ideal. I appreciate the hotel and staff are making changes and adapting as best as possible during the pandemic.",3,2020,08,10
238,Disappointed,"I have always wanted to visit Druids Glen and attended a wedding here recently.  The wedding day event and dinner was very good and no complaints there.  I  think though that  Covid19 arrangements leave a lot to be desired e.g. cleaning the room.  I think the question of whether we want our room cleaned should be asked at check in and not up to us to chase daily for clean towels, clean cups for coffee etc.  The food menu was disappointing  - I would have hated to stay for a week as it was limited with no specials.  We were there three nights.  Breakfast was fine but we weren't informed by the staff that we could order things outside the buffet breakfast.  The toast was cold each morning.  Table service for drinks was a little slow and at times, we had to chase staff.  

However, the staff were friendly, helpful and very accommodating so that is a plus.

The room itself was fine and spacious.  However, I was very disappointed that there was no Nepresso machine - for this type of hotel I would have thought that a given.

I had one spa treatment which was absolutely lovely. 

I know that it is early days for COVID19 arrangements to be assessed and hotels are working their way through things.  I just left with a sense of disappointment and not the wow factor that I was anticipating.",3,2020,08,10
238,Will always return,"Love, love, love this hotel. This is my 4th stay at the hotel, and first since Covid. This time I missed the typical porter at the front, who was always so welcoming and friendly.   I got the sense that the receptionist was a little stressed and just put it down to the current Covid situation. The room we arrived to was so clean and airy. Love the finishing touches of robes & slippers. The beds and pillows are so comfy. Dined at the bar and was obvious the hotel was taking Covid 19 seriously. The table next to us had no chairs, the hotel was ensuring we would be 2 metres away from the next customers. The food was as always amazing. Kids had no complaints either which is always a bonus. Breakfast the next morning was also lovely. There was no roaming freely around, no open buffets. All table service, again different from before but understandable. Swimming was timed for 1 hour and changing rooms had not opened. However it was very well organised with each person/ group assigned a number and area to place their towels. Again showing how seriously the hotel is managing things during the pandemic. My kids missed the game room but the outdoor facilities make up for this. The little playground, the golf, the fairy trail walk and the soccer pitch made up for this. We left so happy with our stay, as always. And I can’t wait to return again. So far this is one of my favourite hotels in Ireland. ",5,2020,08,07
238,Hard to find fault,Myself and my wife stayed here for an overnight break. We had a wonderful stay and it was very hard to find fault. We had gotten upgraded to a suite which was fabulous. With the current Covid restrictions we were seated in the bar for food. Shout out to Simon in the bar who looked after us so well. The food was fantastic as was the wine. We were not certain on the wine but Simon gave us a taster before opening the bottle which was a nice touch. We had breakfast in the room the following morning and it was very tasty. Can’t wait to return again,5,2020,08,06
238,Fanatic hotel,Everything about our stay here was pure perfection. All staff members that I encountered were superb and worked to a really high standard and could not have been nicer. This hotel constantly exceeded my expectations and every request was instantly granted. I’m looking forward to returning to Druids Glen resort again soon. Keep up the great work😊,5,2020,08,06
238,A beautiful port in a storm.,"My family and I enjoyed a wonderful evening at the hotel as well as a heavenly treatment at the spa.  The staff were wonderful, the service & food were fantastic. We felt safe in their hands so we could truly relax and enjoy ourselves.  
What a beautiful port in a storm. ♥️",5,2020,08,05
238,Good visit before covid in February,Stayed the night here just before covid came in in February. The staff was very professional. Very big rooms. Nice playground for my 2 boys. Delicious food. Highly recommend. I will come back here after covid!,5,2020,08,05
238,Staycattion...,"Stayed at the hotel for few days away, had great time. 
Staff very very friendly and helpful.
Rooms was clean and tidy .
Food lovely.
Kid friendly.
Lovely walks around the hotel.
Was told the spa was great as well, but unfortunately it was booked out,so maybe next i visit I'll get a spa appointment. 
Highly recommended and looking forward to returning.
Plus we felt very safe in terms of COVID19.
",5,2020,08,05
238,Family break,"Just returned from two nights in Druids Glen and would highly recommend.  The staff are excellent and everything is run very well, especially in light of the current Covid situation.  Lots to do in the area or just spend time in the hotel.  The restaurant was lovely too.  Will definitely return if I get the chance.",5,2020,08,04
238,Super hotel .. food awful ,"Staying in druids glen for a few nights .. fantastic hotel , rooms staff etc very high standard . 
 Ate in the bar tonight very bad .. maybe I ordered the wrong things buffalo wings were so hot I couldn’t eat them , Main of lamb cutlets .. so fatty , greasy not nice and the chips so bland .. dessert was sticky toffee pudding no bad .. the breakfast in the morning is the big test .. ",4,2020,08,03
238,Excellent hotel and staff,The staff are very friendly and accommodating from the moment you enter the hotel. They put us at ease even with covid restrictions in place. We enjoyed a peaceful and pleasant stay. Spa experience was very relaxing.,5,2020,08,03
238,"Super service, excellent food and surrounds.","Great break away.  From arrival to leaving, the staff were very attentive.  The room/suite was amazing and a great area to relax and unwind in with a drink after dinner.  The food in both the bar and Hugo’s restaurant was excellent.  The grounds were great to wander around.  Cannot wait to return",5,2020,08,02
238,Super family break.,Lovely setting. Plenty of space. Good food (and pint!). Super service. Spaceous rooms. Nice pool & playground. Well organised Covid-19 plan. Would highly recommend Druids Glen. Top marks. Hope to play golf on my next visit.,5,2020,08,02
238,Beautiful stay,"Stayed for two nights. Beautiful setting, nice gardens, welcoming staff, nice and peaceful setting. One staff member in particular stood out. Adrianne at the reception. Beautiful lady, spectacular at her job. Very helpfulm. ",5,2020,08,01
238,Disappointing Visit - Not worth the money,"Unfortunately this was a very disappointing visit. I felt during out stay the service was quite poor, and the quality didn't match the price you pay. The first evening we had dinner in Hugo's restaurant and the both the service and quality of food was quite poor. We had to wait over an hour for our main courses to arrive, when it arrived my partners steak was not cooked as he specified and it wasn't a good quality cut of meat. There was another wait for dessert which I feel had been sitting out and someone had forgotten to bring it down to the table as the sorbet was half melted. When we asked for the bill the waiter came back with chocolates which were been given to every table and said ""I'll get your bill inawhile"" which I thought was quite rude and unprofessional.We did get a drink each for free to apologise for the delays. At breakfast the next morning we were forgotten about in regard to tea/coffee/toast order and I had to go and find a waiter to help us. The next evening we had a meal in the garden bar which was nice but not to the standard of a 5 star hotel. Overall I was quite disappointed with my stay here and won't be returning, ",2,2020,07,31
238,No Way a 5 Star Experience,"After writing to the hotel twice and not receiving a response at all either times, I felt that if I air my thoughts on trip advisor that they might respond. We did after all have a bill of €700 leaving so you would think they would have the courtesy to respond without having to reach this level

We completely understand that restrictions apply due to COVID 19 and we tried to help the hotel as best as possible by booking pool times, breakfast and dinner reservations well in advance of arrival. After arriving at the pool for Saturday morning, we were shocked to learn that the pool was the only facility opened within the thermal suite. This was never communicated once via email or in person upon checking in at reception and at the pool. The other guests seemed to not be aware of this either with 7 of the 10 people within the pool area leaving within 10 mins

Another area of frustration was not to be told that the bar was closed by any of the service staff. After booking in for dinner on a Friday and Saturday night, we were shocked to not be asked for last orders in particular the Sat night in which a couple got a drink next to us and we were waiting for the server to come over yet no one arrived. My partner walked into the bar immediately after and was told the bar was closed at 11.55. She then approached the duty manager and he helped resolve the situation but as we were going to bed at approx 1am, there was further drinks brought out to a table yet we were told at 11.55 the bar was closed. This was very frustrating and confusing as we couldn't get a late drink after a late dinner Friday night either and we're still confused as to what the hotels protocol is with drinks in the lobby area 

We booked this weekend in the knowledge that the resort had an excellent reputation for service as one of the premier hotels in the country but unfortunately our experience was underwhelming and in particular at the level of communication provided to guests throughout the weekened. We understand completely the implications COVID has had on the industry  and that certain areas are very difficult to manage but these should have been communicated upon arrival or upon completion of booking. The hotel should really look at how they communicate with guests well in advance of arrival within the current climate to avoid guests having a disappointing experience . Traveled 17th-19th July",1,2020,07,29
238,Family break,"We booked and stayed during the Covid-19 pandemic. I must say I was slightly worried about travelling however all concern disappeared when we arrived. The hotel was set up well for dealing with social distancing and was clean and well sanitised. Check in went smoothly and the room was lovely, large and very clean. Daily Housekeeping was cancelled, however, this could be requested during the stay. This prevented unnecessary persons from entering the room. The swimming pool was well managed with booking necessary and assigned zones once in the pool. Breakfast and dinner was lovely and service was fantastic. Daily/evening movies were played in a designated area for the children. The outdoor play area was open and we were able to avail of the lovely 6km walk around the grounds. Very good hotel, would highly recommend.",5,2020,07,28
238,Anniversary Treat,Dinner Food was not the standard I expect from a 5 star hotel. The staff dealt with my complaint but there was no acknowledgement from Manager.Breakfast pudding was dry and little offering or choice for an egg alternative to scrambled... staff were very friendly ,3,2020,07,28
238,A getaway at the Druids Glen Hotel,An overall all great weekend getaway. The staff were very friendly and pleasant to deal with at all times . Amazing food and drinks served in the Hugo restaurant. Already missing the strawberry daiquiris!,4,2020,07,28
238,4 Day Family Staycation,"Having read some mixed reviews here about Druids Glen after we booked it for our family Staycation (10 yr old boy, 8 yr old girl) I feel it right to give our opinion on our holiday there. We were a bit worried seeing some of the reviews following the Covid re-opening, but we said we'd go ahead given the hotels great name, plus we were never in Wicklow before.
So between making the booking and then booking our meal times and pool times via the app, it was rather easy. Granted app might be tricky for some visitors but staff on the phone were really helpful as well. On arrival, met by happy gentleman at the door who directed us to either of the two check-in desks. The hotel was clean, sanitize station inside the main door, the rooms were bright and airy, beds comfy and kids loved it from the start.  We felt comfortable with the whole setup.
I see complaints about the food here, and I feel they're unwarranted. Yes, the menu is the same each day, but with good choice from bar menu and A La Carte. We ate every day in hotel, and every meal we had was lovely. Nothing was cold. Staff were very accommodating with kids requests. Special thanks to Ravi and Ygretta (I think). Breakfast was same, good selection. First day was table service, but rest of the week was self service with staff help. They managed it well in fairness. Meals are bit pricey, but you're in 5 star hotel, so expect rise in price. Its a treat and a holiday afterall l!!!
Drinks in the evening could be bone of contention for some, if you didnt get table in lobby. We ate early and did manage to get one, plus there are more upstairs. Shout out to Stuart who served us most days there.
One suggestion I'd have is to take away the big couches. A couple doesnt need a 4-seater couch and 2 chairs to sit down. Replace with single chairs and spread out tables. Also, maybe pipe some nice music in background to create an atmosphere?? I know its difficult but if the bar is closed nice to have some sense of holiday vibe :) The Movie room for kids was nice touch too. 
We also used pool each day, once booked everyone knew the drill, and its limited space so worked out well. Gym is same, well equipped and book your slot. Used driving range too, kids had a laugh. Plus lovely walk around the grounds, 3km/30 minutes one way to clubhouse restaurant. I wouldnt recommend walking it before a meal!! We dined there one evening and got local taxi to drop us. There is a shuttle bus parked up. This should be used for guests to drop them over really, but seemed to be out of service.
Overall, very enjoyable stay with friendly, helpful staff. Our first time there and we would go back. Used it as base to go to Glendalough, Powerscourt, Sally Gap and is central to all.",5,2020,07,28
238,Disappointing,"‪Nice time but it’s like staying in a crèche. Sitting in the foyer at 11pm and there are kids screaming, squealing and running around the place. Family friendly is one thing but what about others who are here for a relaxing stay?! It does ruin the experience and it’s a shame as the food and service were very good but if you are looking for a quiet, relaxing stay as a couple then this is not the place especially during the summer.",3,2020,07,27
238,Over rated,Definitely not a 5 star hotel. Therefore over rated and much too expensive. Staff wonderful. Rooms nice but not 5 star. Breakfast partly cold and to be fair partly hot but hardly acceptable for the rates charged. Cheapest bottle of wine 35 euro at dinner - outrageous. Living off back of superb golf course. Never again. Parkview Hotel down the road much much better value but it doesn't have a super golf course. Hardly matters when I don't play golf.,3,2020,07,23
238,My Family Stay at Druids Glen,Myself and my family loved our stay at Druids Glen. Although we only stayed for two nights but my kids kept talking about it until now. We loved how they handled everything with COVID perspective. Especially pool arrangements. ,5,2020,07,23
238,Magnificent.,"Great hotel, golf course really impressive, service and staff 11 out of 10. Had our company golf day here in July and the course (the glen) was beautiful and well maintained. We were looked after very well. The meal in the hotel was top class",5,2020,07,22
238,5 Star Price but 3/4 Star quality,"Stayed 16/17th July Room 118 Family Room. Found double beds very small. Unable to cast the iPad to the TV. Service average and food very disappointing on the 16th. Had booked the bar but they couldn't find our reservation and put us in the breakfast area alone. Requested to be moved and we were then moved to bar..seat beside the door. Got the impression staff were not to happy for us to ask to move. Ordered drinks which did not arrive but were on the bill. Desserts not good. Jelly came floating in melted icecream and my dessert. Asked for it to he heated but got cold and the cheapest icecream which was full off icicles. 
Experience on the Friday was better but the hotel did appear quieter. 
Pool area..was very surprised at all the cobwebs around the windows. 
Food in hotel is expensive for the quality.

238,Busy but enjoyable,"The druids glen is set in a beautiful part of Wicklow. The hotel was very busy as we stayed the first Friday after restrictions were lifted. As we could not get a table at the hotel we went into Greystones to eat. Again we could get no table as most people had booked ahead with limited spaces. 

The hotel is a pleasure yet under the government guidelines it felt sterile. Not their fault just how it is.

All staff were more than professional and welcoming.",4,2020,07,21
238,Family getaway,"Great stay. Nice to be back after the reopening. service was great as always, and food was delicious .
Would advice to book your pool time and spa treatments way in advance to avoid disappointment. 
Overall lovely time away with no complaints.Will definitely be back soon.  ",5,2020,07,21
238,Great Post-covid staycation ,"This was our first stay at druids glen and our first post covid-19 stay away from home...i have to say that we felt safe throughout our stay and we were pleasantly surprised at how child friendly the hotel is. There is currently a one way system in place around the foyer, there are cards placed on nearby tables when you sit down to alert others not to sit there due to the guidelines, there is hand sanitiser stations around the hotel and no room servicing takes place during your stay unless requested.

It's important to note that due to current restrictions you have to prebook breakfast, lunch, dinner and swimming sessions but this was very easy to do using a personalised portal once you book.

We had a lovely server Colm for breakfast each morning and he was so cheery, helpful and attentive to our needs. While I believe the format of breakfast has changed from buffet to table service, we felt like we were ordering loads, the menu is well presented to allow you to select your contential breakfast and your hot breakfast, and the staff are willing to accompany other requests. The food was very quick to arrive and big portion sizes. 

We ate in the hotel restaurant two of our evenings and the food service was prompt and the menu (again a different format than normal I believe) had a good range of choice, I had the fish and chips and also the chicken burger, both were delicious and generous portions. Thomaz was our server the first evening and he was very friendly, helpful and cheerful towards our party.

We done the walking trail which is lovely including a little fairy garden which is great for the kids, however it's worth noting that it's 45-60mins one way (you still have to get back!), the outdoor playground was great for the children letting them burn off some energy, and the pool bookings were very well organised (remember to book in before you go as there are only spaces for around 20 people during each 40min slot) you change in your bedroom and went down in the robes, picked up a towel from the poolside and were given a zone to leave your robe while you entered the pool. There are dvds to select from reception each evening to take back to the bedrooms to watch, and there was a function room set up to show kids movies at 3pm and 7pm which was a great idea, unfortunately the indoor play room was closed during our stay due to covid.

Our check-in and check out was very smooth and staff were very knowledgeable and helpful. I especially loved the little touches for the younger guests in the rooms - mini robes, mini slippers and a toiletry pack. Overall I'd definitely return to Druids Glen and thank the staff for a most enjoyable stay during difficult times.",5,2020,07,15
238,Beautiful Golf Course and Staff,"Really enjoyed our stay, lovely golf course and really helpful staff in the pro shop. Dinner in Hugo's was fabulous and the staff couldn't have been more helpful.  Food was beautiful and great wine selection.  Breakfast was room order, had to call when 15 minutes overdue and then it arrived in total 45 minutes late and was not very pleasant.  Got a €8 reduction for service but the main issue was the quality, the bacon was under cooked and rubber like, toast was soggy and a larger pot of coffee would have been nice.  ",4,2020,07,13
238,Very Dissapointing Dinner but a lovely hotel,Beautiful hotel but the food was very disappointing.  Long delays due to Covid restrictions but we were not told of backlog in kitchen unil we had already waited an hour for mains. Hostess could have warned guests,3,2020,07,13
238,Wonderful stay during covid times ,"I’m writing this review after staying for the weekend with my family. I’m genuinely baffled by all of the recent bad reviews on here and can only assume they were written by people who like to complain about little things. 
I’ve stayed at this hotel many times, but obviously it was a little different this time. You need to prebook your meals and swim times which we could do without any issues booking the day before. The jacuzzi, sauna etc are currently closed but the swim session was well organized considering. The restaurants seemed to be running smaller menus than normal but we presumed this is due to the current measures and didn’t mind. The food was still delicious, especially the steak and fish and chips in the bar. Breakfast was a little haphazard due to there no longer being a buffet, and at one point our waiter had to tell another waiter to stop trying to seat another family so close to our table. They could do better on social distancing in the breakfast room. 
The hotel is clean, the rooms were perfect and we were very happy with our stay. The price for 3 guests and a bottle of prosecco is very reasonable for a 5 star. Will definitely be back. I hope the other guests will have a bit of empathy for the staff who are trying their hardest in these difficult times. ",4,2020,07,13
238,Not a 5 star experience,"Breakfast was ok but the service was awful, otherwise the food was not good, neither the bar/all day menu nor the hugo restaurant. Rooms were not clean. The covid-19 restrictions were inconsistent and counter-productive. Rooms were not clean.",1,2020,07,10
238,Very disappointing for a five star hotel,Amazing golf course which my husband thoroughly enjoyed. Great playground for kids. Beautiful room and lovely location however the food is of a poor quality and portions are extremely small. As we had a small child with us we prefer to eat in the bar however the menu for our two day stay didn't change so for lunch both days and dinner both days we had to order from the exact same menu. Prices are also quite high for the standard of food. Portions are very small and food is quite bland. The breakfast is poor and there seems to be no system in place for who is serving who amongst the staff. We had originally booked our swim sessions for the morning both days and then we received a call to say those times were actually full so we had to go with 3pm. We used the pool the first day unfortunately missed the pool the second day and there was no slots left to go at a later time or the following morning. This is quite disappointing when you pay a large amount of money and can’t use the facilities. I understand it’s difficult due to covid but perhaps the pool could be opened for longer during the day and for later times with kids since it is renowned for being a child friendly hotel. Limited spa treatments on offer No facials on offer.,2,2020,07,10
238,Our stay in July at the Druids Glen,"The portion sizes in garden restaurant are quite small. The burger was very very average. Breakfast in the morning (full Irish) was very greasy, and cold and thrown together on the plate. I had to remove the bacon from my plate it was very unappealing. Dinner in Hugos was served with chips instead of potatoes. Again my chicken portion size was very small. My spa experience wasn't outstanding also which was unfortunate. Other than that our stay was good the hotel itself is beautiful and the staff are lovely and welcoming. The pool was very well organized with covid in mind. ",4,2020,07,07
238,Family Break,"Travelled with two children in July 2020. Beautiful setting with fabulous walks.  The fairy trail was very popular with the children.
Very accessible to Dublin.  Good Covid measures in place in reception, pool and dining areas.",4,2020,07,07
238,Disappointing stay (not 5 star).,"While the setting of this hotel is indeed beautiful and the surrounding Wicklow area has plenty of attractions, we were disappointed to say the least about our recent stay here. While we understand there are a number of limitations on services at the moment due to Covid 19, we believe that the standards fell considerably below that of a 5 star hotel and the changes or decrease in service level were not reflected in the price for a weekend here. 
- Food was average and disappointed that the menu was essentially the same all day (lunch, dinner) and in the bar and restaurant. We booked the restaurant expecting an alternative menu on the second night, but were disappointed to see the same menu as the previous night. It would certainly be an improvement to even change some dishes from night to night for those guests staying more than 2 nights.
- Breakfast service - it appears that the extra pressure to provide table only service at present was too much for the staff however friendly and accommodating they appeared to be. We were served dry toast, with no plates to eat it on and had to ask for these as well as having to subsequently request butter on all 3 mornings we had breakfast. It may sound small but serving the toast with butter automatically would be much more sensible for staff and I have never known this to happen in most hotels I have stayed in with a lower rating. In a 5 star hotel, I don't think this is too much to ask. It was difficult to gain the staff's attention for any requests such as these.
- The spa and leisure area was advertised as open when booked. However the sauna, steam room and jacuzzi were not open. Perhaps we were mistaken but it was on the premise that the leisure area was fully open that we booked this particular hotel so I think it would be better to be very clear about what is open/closed at the moment. It wasn't a huge issue but would have been nice to know and may have swayed our decision to book at this time.
- I think our final issue which really drove us to write this review was that it was advertised that rooms would not be routinely cleaned to minimise social contacts. However it was noted online that room cleaning could be arranged on request. As we were staying longer than 2 nights and we would have liked to have clean towels, we rang the reception to ask for this service. A gentleman informed my husband that this was not being offered at present due to Covid 19.
Confused we left our room and bumped into one of the cleaning staff who when we enquired why this was the case (as we had read otherwise online) told us that it was in fact a service that was available and that we should ""ring down to put our name on the list"". Stating that we had already done so we went to reception to speak to another member of staff. Unfortunately when we explained the situation we felt that  the fact we had been provided incorrect information was dismissed and the staff member rather than apologising for what appeared to be a lie by the other member of staff, I am afraid was rather condescending and said ""There is a list, are you happy?""
- I do have to compliment the spa staff who were extremely attentive and in particular Georgina who was excellent.
However, as regards management we were generally disappointed, even moreso when we realised that other guests were offered complimentary credit as a result of the fire alarm which also woke us at 6:15am on Saturday morning, something which did not appear to be hotel-wide.
Having stayed in a number of 5 star hotels both in Ireland and abroad, this fell short of our expectations. Would recommend, if you are considering spending well over 1000 euro for food and accommodation, looking elsewhere... Kilronan Castle or Lough Eske among others.",3,2020,07,06
238,Lovely hotel but disappointed with management,"I stayed here for a weekend with my partner. The hotel and grounds are fabulous. The staff were lovely and friendly in the bar, pool and at breakfast. The standards for covid for very good with plenty of sanitizers and space. You felt safe and not on top of anyone. However I was annoyed when the fire alarm went off and we had to evacuate the hotel at 6:20am that no one informed us at What had happened. It took a long time to get back to sleep. We heard some people received credits and we got nothing
Which was very annoying. I’m sure they could of rang each person who was in the hotel that night and offered the same to everyone. After spending a lot of money on food and drink for the weekend in the hotel the management could of given us a gesture drink or an apology as you are away to have a relaxing time. On Saturday evening for dinner there was no potatoes left on the menu which was disappointing as they looked so nice on the Friday evening when the table beside us got them. The food and cocktails were amazing. I really enjoyed the 6km trail and the smoking area off the bar was so relaxing 😌.",4,2020,07,05
238,The covid 19 experience,"Love this hotel. Our 3rd visit. Arrived 1st day of reopening to a very different experience. Covid 19 has hampered the 5 star service we've been accustomed to at druids glen. Pool times and all meals were booked in advance - more difficult than you think if you can only get these an hour apart.  Little flexibility in times booked due to demand and limitations on numbers.  Due to a mix up with my requested times the hotel upgraded us to a superior room which was appreciated.  No breakfast buffet as expected from media reports.  Staff were run off their feet with full table service. Lots of delays, errors and substandard food overall. For safety, no newspapers. No hot towels on arrival. No kids play room. Other issues that arose for us - broken DVD player and aircon. We waited a long time for a room change at 10pm. A nice night manager moved us to a suite.  Lovely as it was it had one bed for 4 of us!  So more waiting for an alternative room. Pool was freezing due to a power cut in days prior to reopening.  No warning given to prepare for the icy plunge in advance. Kids needed hot baths to recover.  Despite the reservations dept taking note of our anniversary at time of booking there was no mention of it or any special touch made as promised.  Despite front desk being aware of difficulties during our stay I was charged the full amount on check out with no acknowledgement. Thankfully manager Pavel did take the time to talk with us before we left and refunded us the price of a meal. Barbara also took the time to hear our frustrations after breakfast service.  Front desk and door staff kindly gave driving range tokens to the kids FOC so some positives. The shortcomings are likely caused by the pressure of covid 19 on hotel systems. Transparency and value will be important for guests' comfort during this strange time. Likewise guests please be advised that patience and lower expectations are needed.  We hope to return when all is well with the world 🙂",3,2020,07,01
238,Mother and Daughter Night Away,"Excellent arrival greeting and welcome from all staff, hotel was a delight to see. Room was spotless, all staff I encountered showed eagerness to achieve excellent customer service. We used the swimming pool, playground outdoor, and had food in the bar and restaurant and in room dining. We would love to be back ",5,2020,07,01
238,NEVER be back!!!,"Me and my partner had booked to go away for a night with our 2 year old daughter. We wanted to take her away before our 2nd Child arrives, just to have 1 last night away as a 3. 
Unfortunately my partner developed some issues during her pregnancy and was told she would be in a wheel chair until her delivery date and that she couldn't be up and about for more than 1 hour at a time.
I rang the hotel to see if i could change the date to later in the year. The girl on the other end of the phone said no as i had booked it with a date that couldn't be changed. I tried to explain to her what the situation was and that we couldn't possibly take my partner on the 2 1/2 hour journey in her current state. 
By this stage i had paid for the room, a meal in the restaurant and a pregnancy massage for my partner, well over €500.
I was told by the girl on the other end of the phone (who was dreadfully unpleasant) that if we couldn't make it, we should give the booking to someone else, but there would be a charge to do so.
This would have been our 3rd visit to the hotel for a night away and after that treatment we will NEVER be back!!!",1,2020,06,25
238,Just the place to get away ,"Just had my second visit to Druids Glen in 12 months.
Can't fault it. Lonely clean rooms, great pool and spa, indoor and outdoor play area for young kids.
Fantastic grounds for walking and just chilling. 
Not to mention the golf.
Food was delish and staff couldn't be more friendly and helpful.
Easy access from M11.
We'll be back ",4,2020,03,15
238,Lovely stay,"Hotel was lovely. Staff excellent and very helpful and friendly. Food was very good. Lovely area to go for long walks.  Would definitely go 
back for another stay with my family.  Would be a lovely place to stay during the summer and do some walking hikes ",5,2020,03,14
238,Excellent Service from beginning to end.,"My wife and I enjoyed an overnight stay at Druids Glen after I was awarded a gift voucher for becoming 2nd place in employee of the year in my workplace. Our overall experience was excellent and we could find no fault in anything.

From the pleasant warm welcome by Adrienne at Reception to housekeeping knocking on our door offering extra towels and other items for a room and finding a nice surprise birthday card and chocolates in our room also. Beating the Monday morning blues with a warm welcome into Hugo's Restaurant for breakfast with guidance and shown what was on offer. It was a pleasure to catch up with a former colleague and now Restaurant Manager at Druids Glen Pawel - a great asset to the hotel. 

We enjoyed the nicely warmed swimming pool and found at least 15 minutes to join the water aerobics class so no excuses for been stuck for something to do especially it was a rainy day we were there. We were given bottles of water upon departure and lent two umbrellas so we could not let the rain spoil our walk on the Druid Glen trail. It was nice that the Concierge took us back from Woodstock House in the hotel courtesy bus.

Excellent from beginning to end. We will recommend this hotel to others. We hope and pray we can return here again sometime. soon.  ",5,2020,03,10
238,Weekend Away,"Recently stayed here for 2 nights with my family and it was fantastic. Its hard to know where to even start. The breakfast was delicious with a great choice. We had dinner in the bar one night and dinner in Hugo's Restaurant the second night, both fantastic. The service was outstanding. The rooms were spotless and the beds were really comfortable. The spa treatments I had were amazing. You are even given a sorbet and a drink after your massage, and you can relax as long as you want in the relaxing room after your massage. The pool, sauna, steam room, Jacuzzi were great. The location is lovely, they've lovely walks. Very child friendly, the hotel is easy to get to. Would recommend this hotel to anyone. Hope to return again soon.",5,2020,03,08

238,Perfect Spa break,"This is our second time at the hotel and once again it was perfect!  The staff, without exception are not just good - they are attentive and caring.

Would highly recommend a stay here and can't wait until I go again!",5,2020,03,06
238,Early year break away,"Fabulous resort to spend a relaxing few days, good food, friendly staff and a sense of quality throughout. Didn't get to use the pool or spa this time but looking forward to going back to Wicklow again soon & will definitely book into Druids Glen again ",5,2020,03,06
238,Beautiful hotel,"We arrived for our weekend stay on a Friday and our first impressions of the hotel were very good. It is very stylish and tasteful. The check-in process was easy and the man checking us in was very friendly and helpful. The room was spacious and clean with a large very comfortable bed. On the first night we ate in the bar, it was very busy with lots of families with young children. The menu is limited and I didn't see anything I liked but eventually settled for a vegetarian pasta dish (I am not vegetarian). My husband ordered the steak. We didn't have to wait long for our food to arrive, mine was very basic little to no flavor just pasta with a tomato sauce and some chopped up courgettes. My husband's steak was very nice but lacked anything special, just steak and some chips no extras. The second night we decided to try the restaurant. We were seated quickly and there was more of an adult feel about it. Our waiter was very nice but again the menu was limited, again I couldn't find anything that I liked apart from a crab salad on the starter, so I ordered the crab salad but as a main, my husband again ordered beef (nothing else he liked on menu). The food arrived quickly but to my disappointment my salad was less of a salad and more of a puree, consisting of 5 strategically placed lumps of pureed crab meat and some green puree that I think may have been pureed cucumber and that was it, it was tasty but it needed something else like maybe the salad I thought it would come with. The husband's beef was cooked well but only came with a small tube of mash potatoes. Overall the food was overpriced and pretentious and let down a otherwise very nice stay. I would stay here again simply because the staff are very good and the hotel is beautiful but I think if I was to stay again I would eat somewhere else.",3,2020,03,05
238,Amazing customer service,"We stayed for 2 nights with my brother and his wife and all 4 of us were given the best customer service out of anywhere we have stayed before. Nothing was too much bother even when I asked for suggestions for bridal shops to visit, Aisling in the reservations team went out of her way to give me the name of a lady who was amazing.",5,2020,03,04

238,A short stay,"Lovely short stay as usual.. 
The Garden Rooms are beautiful for lunch  & dinner & a very relaxed atmosphere. The pool is always a lovely temperature and great facilities.Staff are always friendly & welcoming.
Can’t wait to return",5,2020,03,03
238,Nice hotel but dissapointing in parts. ,"Stayed for one night with a friend. Hotel is extremely clean and staff are very pleasant although service is not up to 5star quality. In the bar at lunch had to ask 3 different people for a menu and they forgot our drinks order. For dinner the service did improve but it was the same menu as the lunch menu. 
The hotel rooms were very spacious and extremely clean and beds were very comfortable. 
The pool area was the most disappointing,when booking we were looking for relaxing stay and there was  2 hour children's swim lessons in the pool when we went down to it. The parents were also in the pool area waiting and watching their children so it made for less than relaxing and uncomfortable trip. We were not advised about these lessons upon check in and might of tried to get spa treatment if we had realised what the pool area would be like. It discouraged us from opting for staying a second night.
Feel the hotel is more geared to families than relaxing get away for adults. ",3,2020,03,03
238,Not a 5 star experience,"My husband and I received a voucher for this hotel for Christmas and were really looking forward to our stay in this ""5 star resort"". However, we were hugely disappointed. At check in we were asked for a €520 pre authorisation on a credit card. Staff spoke over us to other guests checking in. Room was average, not what I would expect from a 5 star hotel.
Pool area was nothing exceptional, no different than an average 3 star hotel.
Bar was very understaffed and guests were clearly unhappy with the service. No snacks available for purchase.
Hugo's restaurant was excellent and this we thoroughly enjoyed.
Queues into the breakfast room and then more queuing to get breakfast. Some of the hot food stations were empty.
Hotel was extremely busy and noisy
Overall, not the relaxing 5 star service expected or charged for.
I would not recommend anyone to spend this kind of money on this hotel.",2,2020,03,02

Great facilities for children- baby pantry with microwave, fridge, changing facilities across the hall from our room. There was also a playroom, playground, puppet show & face painting. Loved the pool, sauna, steam room, plunge pool & children's times in the pool too. Beautiful grounds at the hotel for walks. Definitely recommend.",4,2020,02,25
238,"First class Hotel, magnificent location","We love this place. Set in Wicklow, not far from Greystones, the rooms and beds are very comfortable. Add in great service, friendly helpful staff, lots of space and a spa with a pool and you have five class luxury. But the jewel in the crown for us is two golf courses. The Druids Glen course is the best imo, as hard a golfing test one can get but utterly fabulous. Some breathtaking holes. An easy trip for tourists arriving by boat or plane",5,2020,02,25

Facilities were excellent. From the health club to the spa to the bar and restaurant there is so much here. Staff were also very friendly and efficient. The hotel is very big so plenty of space to relax. Games room for kids too and hotel was very child friendly. Although we had a great break on our own next time we would love to bring our own kids too. We would love to stay there again.",5,2020,02,22
238,Enjoyable 5 star experience,"The hotel doesn’t look like much from outside but it is beautiful inside.  The foyer is lovely with lots of comfortable seating and low tables in a large, pleasant space. Reception is a bit small and can only accommodate 3 persons at a time; the guests beside you can hear everything you discuss.  At busy times a long queue develops.  Our room was very good - spacious, comfortable and a decent sized bathroom with separate bath and shower.  The bar is very nice with efficient and hard working staff.  The breakfast was excellent, among the best we have experienced.  There is lots of choice and the staff are great and the room is very nice.  We ate in the Garden Rooms on both nights where the food was excellent but overpriced.  Throughout our visit the continuing theme was excellent, hard-working staff.
We would return but not during school holidays.  Our room was very near the swimming pool entrance which meant a noisy corridor during mid term break.",5,2020,02,20
238,"Beautiful hotel, great staff, but the whole place is a children's playground","Beautiful hotel, nice helpful staff, good food - but the whole place is a children's playground. If you are considering this hotel for a quiet or romantic break then look elsewhere. If you have kids who like to run about the corridors screaming from early in the morning to late in the night (after midnight) then this is the place for you. Breakfast was full of kids running up and down and making noise, we gobbled our breakfast to get out ASAP. The rooms are well sound proofed from the sides and above/below, but the doors are not, so you can hear the kids running the corridors as they play. We went at Valentines weekend and expected a quiet get-away, but instead we ended up in the middle of an adventure playground. Screaming, running, shouting, playing, jumping, gadgets, fights, spillages, tears, tantrums, etc. etc. Our floor had a kids games room which helped to increase the feeling of being in a playground. There was face painting one evening so we had tigers and cats racing around the corridors as we tried to relax and read.

Great place for families if you want a Butlins experience without the kid's amusement rides, very bad for couples trying to take a break. Perhaps if you are here for the Golf and sit in the bar in the evening then this won't annoy you.

The Hotel really need to try to segregate families with hordes of kids and those looking to relax - perhaps separate floors, perhaps separated seating areas (it is a big place with multiple rooms). ",3,2020,02,19
238,Druid's Glen,"Lovely child friendly hotel. Rooms are very comfortable, spacious and quiet. Staff are very friendly and helpful. They make your stay as pleasant and relaxing as possible for you. They will do their best to accommodate your needs",5,2020,02,19
238,Very disappointing....,"My partner and I stayed here for the New Years special offer which included dinner, fireworks on NYE and a 2 night stay costing nearly €800...This package and our stay was a complete let down and not value for money at all.

The Room
The hotel and the room are very outdated and in need of redesign. For a 5 star hotel I was very underwhelmed. The room was outdated and the bathroom had mould in the shower tiles. 
Bed was comfy and room was spacious.

Food
Food was bland during our set meal. Thankfully the dessert saved the day but can’t say this was a 5 star meal at all. Wouldn’t recommend. We had food at the bar too and this was far superior. Fell like the hotel let themselves down with the set menu for the NYE package. 

Another point to note that our package included fireworks for NYE. The fireworks were set off at 5pm without any notice to guests at all. Luckily our room was facing them so we were able to view them but a number of guests were complaining when we had met them later in the bar that they had missed them. 

Didn’t use the spa so cannot comment.

WiFi worked fine throughout. 

One thing very positive about our stay was the staff. Such a credit to the hotel. Every single staff member was polite and couldn’t do enough to help.",3,2020,02,18
238,Loved every second - highly recommend!,"Fabulous hotel, free parking, wonderful staff and service, beautiful rooms with everything you could ever need and delicious food! Highly recommend this hotel for any occasion. We enjoyed the walking trail through the beautiful golf course and grounds, and had a cup of tea at the golf club. Had a lovely dinner in the bar, where the staff were very friendly and attentive. The spa area is very clean and well maintained, but bear in mind that you need to wear a swim cap to use the pool as we didn't know that. Robes and slippers provided in the rooms, and towels available from the spa. Breakfast was incredibly good - such a vast array of fresh foods, including honey fresh from the comb! Bed was massive, and extremely comfortable with crisp white linens and options for the firmess of the pillow. Proper hairdryer included. Couldn't recommend this hotel any more - we'll be back to this and others in the same family of hotels.",5,2020,02,16
238,Birthday Celebration ,My mother chose this hotel to spend her birthday in over the weekend. Shauna in reservations was very accommodating and couldn’t do enough to ensure she enjoyed her stay. Rooms were large and amazing views. ,5,2020,02,12
238,Druids Glen,"This hotel was exceptional.  Beautiful location, fantastic staff and wonderful food.  Couldn't recommend enough.  We used the dream and dine offer and it was really good value.  The service by staff is the best I have ever experienced.  ",5,2020,02,12
238,Winter relax,"The Christmas break was a distant memory when I decided to book my Mum and I a little trip near home. Having visited several lovely places in Ireland, I decided to revisit an old favourite ( by old somewhere I hadn’t been in a few years!). As this was a treat for my Mum, first and foremost, I booked Afternoon tea, Spa treatments and even checked out mass times. I’m a very dutiful daughter! We arrived at 3, slightly panicked with a 3.30 Afternoon tea reservation, the minute I pulled up, a lovely man whisked my cases and car away, we were checked in and with time to spare went to our room. And what a room, spacious, airy, 2 double beds ( which turned out to be way too comfortable), lovely L’Occitane toiletries. We headed back to the garden room where we partook of a delicious tea, standouts of the exceptional offerings were the sandwich’s, wager thin roast beef, a miso bun, and the lemon curd I adored. We enjoyed a glass of Champagne, we rolled out of there with a takeaway, such a lovely experience and Clodagh our waitress was a joy. Back to our lovely room to find a complimentary bottle of bubbles and handmade Irish chocolates, we were spoilt! We ventured to the lounge much much later after a chill out ( and mass) and really enjoyed the lovely menu. So much choice! I will return just for the cauliflower wings. The hotel partner with The happy pear for vegan and vegetarian menu additions and it shows! Sunday morning , the breakfast, as someone who travels a lot, I’m a bit jaded so it’s great to see new ways to ‘do’ breakfast. Home made smoothies and an egg bar were so much nicer than the ‘full Irish’. I’d a lovely freshly made bespoke omelette. Barbara the manager was an absolute legend at juggling 5 things at once. Then to the Spa, amazing treatments from Erica, Georgia and I think Marian , Mum claims to hate being fussed over so to see her float out looking so relaxed was wonderful. She’s the typical Irish Mammy putting everyone else first so it was just great to see her giving into it, well done Marian! We had a late lunch , joined by a friend who lived nearby, the buttermilk chicken , Shepherds pie and Fish and chips were all perfect. Our evening was spent relaxing with a cheeseboard ( amazing) and wine and an early night. Overall, one of the best hotel stays I have enjoyed in a long time. Some observations, it’s very family friendly and the guest mix was very varied which shows how adaptable a space it is. Apparently there’s a rather amazing golf course too. Something for everyone. Looking forward to a summer stay to enjoy the lovely outdoor space too. ",5,2020,02,11
238,"Nice hotel, avoid interconnecting rooms if possible","Excellent food in Hugo's and a good range of choices at breakfast. Very clean room and hotel in general. One downside was the fact that the interconnecting doors between rooms does not seem to include any sound proofing so conversations can be heard crystal clear, especially at night time.",4,2020,02,10
238,Druids glen,"We had a lovely stay in druids glen, got a mother to be massage which was fabulous and the relaxation room afterwards was amazing. Had lunch in garden rooms which was nice and the pool facilities were great.room was really big and comfortable and all staff were very helpful, was the best hotel breakfast I've ever had,delicious",5,2020,02,10
238,Luxe hotel that disappoints,"This is a nice property with excellent customer service and excellent food. However, the property is older and needs to be upgraded. The rooms feel dated. The hotel service seem to be used by the local community so this is not necessarily an exclusive property. ",3,2020,02,09
238,Family wedding,A fabulous hotel lovely comfortable rooms and plenty of space they are so big with nice big beds such a nice sleep..plenty of pillows and extra towels..free bottles of water and tea and biscuits in the room..lovely breakfast the next morning with plenty to choose from..lovely friendly staff in hotel who constantly asked if you needed help with luggage or anything else even when we checked out we were handed a bottle of water for the journey home..didnt get to do anything outside of hotel because we were there for a wedding but would definitely go back again..,5,2020,02,08
238,Spring break,"Get there early and enjoy the location , the setting and views are beautiful and there is a walking trail  around the grounds that is very  enjoyable and relaxing, we didn't  have an opportunity to play the golf course6 but they  look very resting. ",5,2020,02,08
238,Lovely stay,"This is a fabulous hotel in a fabulous setting. Your experience begins with a beautiful drive into the resort. A beautiful reception/lobby area, it is very stylish and modern in design. We received a very warm and professional welcome. The bedrooms are of a high standard and you are provided with everything to ensure your comfort. 
Food wise Hugo’s restaurant is outstanding and you can see why it is of an award winning standard. You will be well looked after. The restaurant staff was lovely and interacted well with their customers.

Re: Activites. The spa is a must visit if your into exceptional treatments. I tried the luxury pedicure and my attendant Georgia was amazing. My husband played the Druid Glen golf course. He is very regular and avid golfer and thought the course was ‘exceptional’ despite the weather being poor. It really is a retreat and your interests are catered for whether you’re active or looking to relax this is a great hotel. 
There’s a lively walk around the grounds also that is lovely to do.

We did have one slightly disappointing experience in the Heath golf club bar, which I must say was the exception and not the norm. After check in we decided to have a stroll around the resort. My husband is a golfer and was booked to play Druids glen the following day. We popped into the Heath club to grab a cup of coffee. On entering my husband asked if it was still open to be told rather abruptly it was open until 5pm. (I looked around but could not see opening/closing times displayed anywhere). As it was 4:25pm we decided to have a coffee. We were told that the coffee machine was off but he did say he could turn it on(but he made it obvious that would put him out) so decided on tea. This was mild however compared to the reception an older couple received on entering at 4:45pm. They were clearly golfers and had finished. The lady asked for tea for two and some pastries. The barman was exceptionally rude and told her he was closed at 5. He went ahead and got their order together but making it very obvious that he was peeved off about it. He banged crockery and was muttering under his breath but loud enough that we could hear he was annoyed and clearly seemed unhappy. I was very uncomfortable witnessing the interaction and decided not to finish our order as I just wanted to get out of there. 

This was, however, the only downside to this trip. You won’t be disappointed with the standards in this hotel. 
I would highly recommend this hotel.
",5,2020,02,07
238,Wonderful stay,"Warm welcome, excellent service throughout the hotel, quality dining, convenience of golf courses and local wlks  and superb location.
We plan to return to Druids Glen and see more of what Co Wicklow has on offer.
",5,2020,02,07
238,Bliss,"Just back from two night stay in Druids Glen. My husband availed of the driving range and I the spa. It was my first time getting a consultation with Sinead De Hora and I can not recommend her enough.  She made out a treatment plan for me after reading my aura/energy and was spot on. A  therapist called Georgina gave me a massage accordingly. I can not recommend it highly enough. The staff in the hotel couldn’t have been more professional or approachable. The food was amazing, I didn’t know even a salad could taste as good! We honestly feel like we have come away after a much longer break rather than just a 2 nighter. It was our first time to visit but certainly won’t be our last.

238,M MacHale,"First time to visit Druids Glen, exceptional service from the moment we arrived. Golf was excellent and pre golf breakfast on a cold day was fantastic. Lovely room with views over the golf course, very comfortable bed and luxury toiletries in bathroom. Dinner a was 5 star! Great hotel, genuinely nice welcoming staff.",5,2020,02,04
238,A real treat,"We loved this hotel! Family friendly, very comfortable, beautiful scenery, great staff, loved the extras in the superior room and a little treat of a box of chocolates as it was my birthday. We pull love to go back sometime ",5,2020,02,02
238,Experience at Druids Glen--underwhelmed.,I was disappointed with the service of the staff. It was slow and lacking customer service and when I spoke to a staff member about the lack of service she was negative and moaned about the hotel being under staffed and she felt under pressure. I didn't need to hear this as I was at Druids for rest. ,3,2020,02,02
238,Let down by the Restaurant,"Nice Hotel, good facilities just that the Restaurant was very poor. Have stayed in this Hotel a number of times over the years and there is always problems with the restaurant. The restaurant was not busy on the Friday night we are there but the service was poor. We had to ask for the wine menu twice , and the wine came the same time as the starter. The server also broke the cork in the bottle. My starter was excellent but my wife's was inedible. Both mains were fine but nothing special. My wife ordered the chocolate fondont for dessert but the waiter explained that it collapsed and didn't offer to replace it and regardless how it looked it didn't taste great either. The bill was also incorrect when it was first brought to me, which is also something that I experienced on a previous trip. Hot breakfast in the morning was very greasy, taste d like it was deep fried. Such a shame as the hotel is very nice and close by. I would love to eat here on a regular basis if it wasn't for all the problems with the restaurant.",2,2020,02,02
238,Overnight stay at Druids Glen Hotel,"Expecting more from 5 star hotel having been to a few across the country.  You definitely need to book for dinner at Hugo's at the weekend as we were left disappointed, the restaurant was fully booked. There was quite a wait for a table in the bar also and I don't like to eat too late.  Not a terrible experience overall, just not the best we've had!",4,2020,02,02
238,Anniversary,"Stunning hotel and grounds. Staff are super friendly, food is amazing in Hugos Restaurant and also the bar. Cater for everyone, bedroom and bed very comfortable. Would highly recommend this hotel. Not very far from Dublin",5,2020,02,01
238,Relaxing visit to Druids glen,"Just back from a stay at Druids glen with my boyfriend. We really enjoyed our time here, so relaxing. Couldn’t fault the staff who were all lovely and helpful from the reception to the bar. Service in the was slow and not great as it was busy but we had a really nice young man who served us and apologized for all delays, trying his best to accommodate us ( we were sorry we didn’t get his name!). Our room was comfortable and spacious however walking in the corridor outside could be heard easily. Breakfast was delicious however we were a bit annoyed after finishing our meal to see the table beside us had ordered eggs Benedict. We hadn’t been offered a menu so we didn’t realize we could have had breakfast to order which we would’ve loved, so that was a pity. We finished our stay with the walking trail which was very enjoyable. Overall I would recommend a trip to this comfortable and relaxing hotel.",4,2020,02,01
238,5 star Again,"4th time staying, never let's me down. Its top class in everyway: food, service, cleanliness, children entertainment and value. Lovely touch by hotel in recognising returning visitors. Will be booking again. ",5,2020,02,01
238,Nicola & Joe’s Vitafriends Pku weekend,"On arriving at the hotel, it looked bigger than I remember. It’s a very plush hotel, a superb setting for Weddings and other events, having attended one 8 years ago.  The staff are very customer service orientated and are polite and friendly. The rooms are excellent and very plush with everything in them.  The Pku that we cooked is gorgeous and no doubt the breakfast will be tasty with excellent choice for Pkus, HCUs, etc with everything provided. I highly recommend this hotel to people who want to stay in a very luxurious setting.",5,2020,02,01
238,Home away from Home,"Every visit here feels like you are coming home. You always recieve a warm welcome and Adrienne is always fantastic and is an asset to Druids Glen.
All the staff are friendly and always smiling and provide the outstanding service you expect from this hotel. I always look forward to our visits here.

The breakfasts are fresh, warm and tasty and the Garden Room provides some lovely evening meals and drinks.

The Birthday cake is out of this world and freshly made by their in house pastry chef. Its to die for, so book one in advance if you are celebrating.

The rooms are always clean and more importantly the beds are heavenly.

I can always recommend a stay here.

I am sitting here trying to think of a negative and eventually found one. We tried the driving range once and the free golf clubs from reception didnt have the right club for teeing off. They were all the wrong type. This didnt really matter though, as I had never tried golf before and I doubt having the right club would have made any difference to my lack of ability to even hit the ball.",5,2020,01,28
238,Excellent service,"I have stayed for one night in Hotel and it was absolutely amazing.
All staff provide an exceptional service from moment of arriving.
Staff was very nice, friendly and welcoming. Room was beautiful, very clean.
I had spa treatment, my therapist was Catriona, she was very educated, professional and caring.
She was checking on me during treatment, pressure, temperature and she make sure I am comfortable. Sap relaxation area was very nice and relaxing.
I would highly recommended everyone who are staying at hotel to visit Spa.",5,2020,01,28
238,Overnight break,"We went with the family for our 7yr old daughter's birthday as she loves hotels.thebjotel was fantastic mostly down to the really super staff. We have stayed in so many places and the staff are what make it..Druids Glen was completely above our expectations. The little treats for my daughter's birthday were a hit and so thoughtful. Food was super at all times and the place is spotless everywhere. So thank you, we will be back. It's such a handy location as we live in South Dublin. ",5,2020,01,27
238,family trip,Entire stay was excellent; january discount did help make it good value; for families with teenager or young adult kids it would be good to have special offers with regards booking a second room. It was very enjoyable,5,2020,01,27
238,Relaxing Stay,"We spent 3 nights staying at the Druids Glen Hotel and we had a really enjoyable and memorable stay. We got engaged during our stay!

The hotel is in a gorgeous location. It has excellent facilities for families. Our room was lovely. The bed was comfortable. We utilised the fantastic spa facilities whilst there and would definitely recommend other guests do this also. The pool was lovely. All staff were very pleasant and helpful. We ate in the garden bar on two nights and our meals were lovely. I enjoyed the vegan options on the menu. Myself and my son have a dairy allergy. At breakfast the chef was able to make dairy free pancakes which was great. 

The bathroom would have benefited from some maintenance as both the shower and sink were slow to drain and there was mould on tile grout in the shower. I also would suggest better labelling of allergens on the hot food buffet at breakfast. Staff should know ingredients of food they are serving. 

We had a lovely stay at the Druids Glen and would certainly recommend the hotel, we do hope to return in the future.",4,2020,01,26
238,Pleasant Stay,"Great hotel, excellent welcome at reception, a very comfortable and spacious room. The grounds are very scenic for a walk and the food was excellent the the Garden rooms.

238,Beautiful relaxing break,"A fantastic hotel. All the staff were very helpful, friendly and professional. Beds very comfortable. Room great and well kitted out. Lovely grounds for a walk. The spa was excellent, best massage I had in a long time from Tom. The hotel was very comfy with plenty of lovely sofas. It was bright and airy with beautiful decor. I highly recommend it and will definitely be back 😊",5,2020,01,23
238,Perfect stay in a beautiful location,"We came with friends for an overnight break and what a fantastic experience we had. Despite booking with a Living Social voucher, which meant we were paying around half the usual price, we were upgraded to beautiful rooms, with lovely views. The rooms were spacious, spotless and tastefully decorated. The beds were so comfortable we all slept well. We dined that evening in the Garden dining room and the food and service were excellent. What can I say about the breakfast the next morning! OMG it was a feast for the eyes as well as the stomach 😍. There was such a selection of fresh fruit, compote and yogurt, cereals pastries and breads, pancakes, omelettes as well as the full Irish breakfast and continental option - delicious! We aren’t golfers and didn’t have time for the spa but we will definitely be back! Thoroughly recommend this hotel in a beautiful part of the country.",5,2020,01,21
238,Sunday Night Break,"Spent a Sunday night here with my girlfriend, Really Really Nice, 5 stars all round.. From the min we got there to the minute we left we were greeted with a smile and very helpful staff.
Rooms are up there with the most comfortable we ever stayed in. 
Deffo will be returning again.. 
Love Druids Glen.. ",5,2020,01,21
238,Business Catch-Up,"I've used the bar lounge a number of times recently for casual business meetings and was very impressed by the ambiance, friendly service and excellent food.  The seating is very comfortable with plenty of space which enables a private conversation.  The setting is very pleasant with plenty of light even on a winter’s day. 

I can recommend the seafood chowder as the best I've had in quite a while (but I would prefer if the bread was served on the side rather than on top of the chowder).",5,2020,01,20
238,Just what the doctor ordered,"Just had a fab stay in Druids Glen on Sat night. From checking in to checking out we couldn't praise the attention to detail from the staff enough. We had lunch in the Garden Room and a delicious dinner in Hugo's. Breakfast one of the best I have experienced in an Irish Hotel. 
Afterwards we enjoyed the walk around the golf course with blue skies and a multitude of wild life keeping us company as we strolled around the grounds. 
We will definitely be back.",5,2020,01,20
238,Afternoon Tea..... thank you Thomas,"It was a late Christmas celebration - afternoon tea for 4 ladies.  The food was delicious and so much of it.   Afternoon tea is served in such a lovely, quiet setting - makes you feel so special.  You could stay there for ages. Thomas treated us so well and took such good care of our 'Nanny'.   He is such an asset to your staff.",5,2020,01,20
238,Mother/Daughter Spa Break,"I had a one4all gift card, and wanted a nice hotel with a spa. It was only about 40 minutes drive from where I live. It was my daughters first spa experience.

238,they don’t  give you everything they promise on Groupon.,"they’re saying there is a vegan restaurant in a garden but they didn’t say it is 15 minutes driving from the rezort...
they closed the restaurant on the day of ours stay and we had no choice but eat in the bar where we couldn’t use the €20 voucher for the dinner.
we got a bit upset with that and tried to use it on the other day. the manager told us they are sorry and they couldn’t do anything, only give us a complimentary tea and coffee... really frustrating!
the room was good!",2,2020,01,15

The staff were amazing, the food was spectacular and the hotel was stunning. We have since had our baby girl and plan on coming back for our first family trip together. It is an extremely family friendly hotel and the atmosphere around it was so fun and relaxed. Druids was definitely one of our most enjoyable stays we have had in Ireland. Looking forward to returning in March",5,2020,01,15
238,Druids Glen Hotel and Golf Resort,I surprised my mother with a one night stay and spa treatment at Druids Glen Hotel and Golf Resort and it was hands-down the best hotel experience we've ever had. Neither of us wanted to leave the next day! ,5,2020,01,14
238,"5 star, amazing!","We come here every year, never disappointed, food is amazing, staff go above and beyond, its 5 star!

Bedrooms and hotel was clean. The ladies that ran the Kids club where excellent as where the concierge.
No information given by reception staff on check in. None of the special requests where followed even though reservation

Tried to reserve table in bar told that it is not possible however other guests where able to reserve tables. One rule for one and another for other people. Restaurant food poor we had to send back main courses as food was not cooked. Poor ",2,2020,01,06

238,Amazing staff and lovely hotel,"Our family stayed in Druid's Glen for the first time two nights ago to start off our Christmas celebrations. The rooms were very spacious and clean and we all really enjoyed the pool facilities. The staff were excellent, all very friendly and polite. One of the doormen, Colm, was especially helpful and chatty, he helped us with our bags and made checking out very easy for all 10 of us! Overall we had an excellent stay, thanks to all the Druids Glen staff who were working over the Christmas period.",5,2019,12,26
238,Average experience,I don't think this hotel experience lives up to its reputation. It seems to cater more for family stays. We had high expectations of the restaurant but unfortunately it was very unimpressive. Overall it was an average stay for what was spent. Spa treatments were overpriced.. ,3,2019,12,24
238,Fantastic hotel with phenomenal staff,"Highly recommend a stay in this beautiful hotel. The staff could not be more accommodating, the Christmas decor was really beautiful and the food in Hugo's was excellent. Really looking forward to a return trip to Druids Glen.",5,2019,12,23
238,Lovely vacation spot,"Spent a week here with the family. From the doorman to the front desk, to the wait staff-ALL were wonderful. Lobby is beautiful and inviting. The rooms were very nice, but not over the top.Large bathroom with separate tub and shower. Walking path around the hotel is lovely. Breakfast was wonderful: lots of variety over the course of our stay. There is a gym, which is mall, and spa services are also available. Large bar and restaurant also, which we ate at once. Very good.",5,2019,12,23

238,A welcome break from work and wedding planning,I have no problem with recommending anybody to visit and stay at the resort. You have it down to a tee and talking of tees it was a pleasure to have the Glen Course to myself where I was able to relax while my partner enjoyed her Spa treatment,5,2019,12,18
238,Disappointing,"Swarming with children. Hotel did not match its star rating on this occasion. Nice location, the roads leading up to it are not in great condition. Booked for a birthday get away, left feeling disappointed. Will book elsewhere in future. ",2,2019,12,16
238,Christmas,"Stayed on a Friday night a month before Christmas. There seemed to be a Christmas party on but it did not affect us at all. Check in was ok. Gave us a room with two small doubles, however easily changed to a room with a king bed. Nice, big, clean rooms with comfortable bed. Wasn’t a huge fan of the pillows but I still feel asleep rightly. 
We ate in the Garden room and bar which doesn’t take reservations. We were happy to see they collaborated with the Happy Pear. Got a steak which came with chips and pepper sauce, a Buddha bowl and some hot chicken wings. With one pint, price came to €60. Delicious food and upon request came out with a complimentary brownie and candle for my birthday. 
Breakfast was delicious however was not included in the price as we booked through booking.com. €15 each. Plenty of a selection with made to order fresh omelettes. 

12 midday checkout which was good too. 
Would return. ",5,2019,12,16
238,Overnight Stay with friends,Loved this hotel. Will definitely go back. Very relaxing and dinner was really excellent as were staff.  It was a very quiet time for the hotel. However lots of nooks and hideouts if you needed to get a bit of peace and quiet from the visitors I am sure they will have over Xmas and the New Year's celebrations.,5,2019,12,13
238,Golf Course,"Played golf here on the 11th of Dec. Poor experience,fairways  wet and greens in poor condition.
The food was good and the facilities very good. the course is looking sad and not well maintained.
Overall may come again.",3,2019,12,12
238,Lovely family stay,A lovely family friendly stay in beautiful county Wicklow. Friendly helpful staff & excellent quality food. Immaculate rooms. Exceptionally clean. Excellent facilities made this stay very enjoyable. Only wish we could have stayed longer.,5,2019,12,10
238,Lovely Hotel ,"We had a lovely one night stay here. The facilities are very good with a great spa & leisure centre and a lovely walk through the grounds and golf course including complimentary drive back to the hotel if needed.The Christmas decorations were lovely and we had a very spacious room with an extremely comfy bed. The food in the hotel was delicious and every staff member we met were very friendly.
We had heard great things about this hotel including it's previous celebrity guests so we were expecting a little more from the hotel.
We were very surprised to see so many children running around considering it's a 5 star hotel with such a big price tag. Unfortunately we have stayed in alot nicer hotels around Ireland for alot less money, but we did enjoy our stay. Thank you. ",3,2019,12,10
238,Breakfast excellent..,"2 nights stay at Druids.

Positives:Staff friendly, beds comfortable, breakfast was lovely, pool area nice, lovely grounds.

Negatives: Room quite basic for price, asked for a change of bed linen at reception and they said yes but did not change sheets. Thin walls and children playing and screaming in halls till very late and again very early.

Lovely spa and amazing massage. Relaxation room not great with the main door for staff in their they are constantly in and out, could be warmer also.",3,2019,12,09
238,Golfing break,Having stayed in Druids Glen on many occasions with my wife it was with out hesitation that i brought work colleagues for around off golf and an overnight stay which they throughly enjoyed an exceptional hotel .,5,2019,12,07
238,A lovely night away ,We booked one night and enjoyed dinner in the garden restaurant. We fancied the bar food as opposed to the fine dining in Hugo’s. We certainly weren’t disappointed. The staff were fantastic and the food was delicious. Loved the happy pear vegan options. We ordered two starters and a main to come out together and we really enjoyed it. Would definitely return ,5,2019,12,07
238,Relaxing Break: Breakfast excellent but Evening Meals Poor,"Our family were warmly welcomed and checked in at the check-in area which was most beautifully seasonally decorated.  We were all in Superior Rooms which were very comfortable.  My robe was covered in make up when I was about to go to the pool, but it was swiftly replaced.  Ourselves and the kids thoroughly enjoyed the pool and relaxation facilities.  We ate in the bar area on Friday night, varying from steak to vegetarian and chicken dishes which were all ok, for a bar menu but service was quite slow.  The kids enjoyed their pizzas. The breakfast was one of the best we have enjoyed anywhere, such a range for all pallettes.  However, it must a 101 in Catering college in all hotels that tea and toast is delivered nearly before we sit down, monitoring of table sections should allow more effective delivery of hot and tasty tea and toast.  We dined in Hugo's on our next night, service was very slow.  My husband and I had the Beef Cheek, which was the only part of our mains we could eat.  The beluga rice with it had a chilli slice on top which deemed the rice inedible, it was one of the worst main courses we have had in a very long time.  Some other mains were lukewarm, definitely not the best meal, disappointing for a ""5 star hotel"".  The chocolate fondant was tasty but my latte was lukewarm too.  Overall, it was an enjoyable and relaxing break but the dining experience was most definitely sub-par and as a result it is not a 5* hotel standard across the board.  We would need to see read and hear about a big improvement in the dinner service and food if we were every to return,",4,2019,12,06
238,Christmas get together with friends,"Great venue for a celebration, get together or simply to chill out.  Unfortunately we did not get a chance to avail of the wonderful pool, spa and gym as our stay was too short.  The fine dining was booked out but the Garden Bar and Restaurant was very adequate for our party to relax and enjoy some food and wine.",4,2019,12,03
238,Group family annual holiday.,"Group family annual holiday. First time going to Druids Glenn but will be back. Excellent service, food was very good. Everything at hand and the kids loved the kids room. Would be useful to be able to open a bill in lobby that we could transfer to table booking in restaurant. ",5,2019,12,02
238,Sister's wedding day,Visited in November for my sister's wedding. I was blown away by the service we received. Incredible staff nothing was too much trouble - especially Barry (thank you for my wake up call)! Rooms were immaculate as was the rest of the hotel. Yes it's pricey but you do get what you pay for. All in all I had a wonderful stay and my sister had the most wonderful wedding. Thank you to all of your wonderful staff!,5,2019,12,02
238,Over Night Package,"Visually this is a lovely hotel, a short journey off the motorway which makes it easily accessible. I had been gifted as a surprise an Overnight stay and Meal package by a friend which I was much looking forward to. 

I arrived at the hotel and explained this to the staff member and asked him if i could book dinner around 8pm that evening at check in which he replied he would check with the restraunt manager and ring my room. Alas an hour in the room no phone call so i went to the spa which was clean, facilities were good and it was nice relaxing afternoon. 

I came down for a drink with my partner at 6pm and asked the reception if my booking had been made for dinner and i was told that the restraunt was totally booked up. This i have to say was very disappointing. Having purchased a package that included dinner and not have availability in the restraunt is not something i would imagine is best practice. If i asked at 6pm for a dinner booking and was told of no availibility i would totally understand, i asked at check in for a dinner booking for that evening which you would expect that tables would be available. The hotel didn't appear to be anywhere near max capacity on a Sunday evening. 

I spoke later on with reception and a different staff member helped me from there, she offered me a sitting at 9,30pm which was just a little late given i was downstairs from 6.pm but i did appreciate the effort. She then gave me the breakdown of credit i could use in the bar for food, at that stage i had no other choice as waiting that long for dinner was not going to suit us. So i had the bar food which was nice, our server was plesent but it was a bit of a let down that we couldnt eat in the main restraunt. 

Overall the hotel is very nice, rooms are plesent, spa area is nicely kept and the hotel itself had a warm vibe. However i am quite disappointed about the dinner arrangements that evening. I'm not sure if this happens here on a regular basis with packages but did dampen the evening for us. Maybe the staff member who checked us in forgot to ask the restaurant when we checked in…….. Who knows maybe it was booked out. I would recommend to guests to ensure you can get a table before booking if you have a package like i did, afterall eating out for dinner is half the experience. 

3.5* stars for me, on the basis of the dinner it would have been 4 because i did enjoy the hotel and its facilities.",3,2019,11,28
238,Break in the Garden County,Unfortunately weather was bad so we didn't get to appreciate  the grounds as much as we would have liked but we did have a lovely day in the pool area and in the spa .The staff were friendly and helpful and the room was comfortable. Overall experience was very good.,4,2019,11,27
238,Lovely hotel,Had a super overnight stay here to celebrate my daughters birthday! Staff were all pleasant friendly and helpful. Hope to stay longer next time and enjoy the spa and pool facilities which looked great!,5,2019,11,27
238,Weekend Away,"Excellent stay except for weather- which couldn't be helped 
with regard to food which was excellent, but supplements extravagant .€9 extra for 7oz Steak bit ridiculous. staff very friendly & helpful. spa terrific . will return & hopefully weather  is better & MAYBE PLAY ROUND OF GOLF ",4,2019,11,25
238,Druids Glen...pure luxury.,Excellent stay. Room was super comfy. All staff in hotel we encountered from reception to the bar and restaurant were so nice and accommodating. The manager in the restaurant in particular. Nothing was an issue for her. Couldn't recommend enough.,5,2019,11,25
238,Perfect getaway ,"Myself and my wife stayed in druids glen last night. We were celebrating our anniversary, we had originally booked a trip to Prague but for family reasons decided to stay at home and have a night in another 5 star and then on to druids Glen for one night. We had a really enjoyable stay. We used the pool area, followed by lunch in the bar, dinner in Hugo’s and then finished the night listening to the live music. Room was spotless and quiet. The waitering staff are an absolute credit to this hotel. We were served by Lilla at dinner who made us feel so welcome we felt we were in a home rather that a hotel. We’ll be back for another stay sometime soon. Well done druids Glen. ",5,2019,11,23
238,Girls Night Away,"Very expensive for what you get, rooms were very clean and spacious but no better that what you would get in a 3 star hotel, staff were friendly and polite except for two staff members on Sunday morning when we arrived for breakfast, breakfast finishes at 11am and we arrived at 11.07am ( we did apologise for being 7mins late) but the staff member not too sure what her name was but it stated on her name badge that she was from Germany made a bit of a deal that we were 7mins late even though there were people still having breakfast, another staff member when asked to get us cup and saucers looked at her watch.  We had breakfast as quick as we could and apologised yet again when leaving even though there were still people finishing there breakfast.  It is a lovely hotel but a little overpriced.",3,2019,11,20
238,Druids glen,Great food location and staff will be back this time for 2 nights really enjoyable was busy but you didn't notice plenty of places to sit and enjoy well done to the team there didn't have time for golf but the course looked in brilliant condition look forward to seeing it next spring,5,2019,11,17
238,Druids Glen-A Very Relaxing Stay,"We really enjoyed our night away at Druids Glen. The staff and service was of a very highly standard. The bar food and breakfast were delicious. The pool area was adequate and clean, maybe a bit small overall but clean and nice and additional seating areas at reception etc were very well designed and comfortable. The decor in bedrooms and other areas is beautiful and spacious with warm colour palates. We would love to return soon.",5,2019,11,12
238,Lovely stay,Enjoyed a lovely time in druids Glen fro. The moment we arrived the staff are so nice welcoming a lovely hotel and the pool was great. We had a lovely suite and we definitely be back to stay.hopefully a little longer.,5,2019,11,12
238,Outstanding,"This hotel is beautiful. The staff are so friendly everyone greeted you with a smile if not stopping for a chat. Family room was spacious and comfortable. The games room, park and grounds were fantastic for kids. And dvd loans for the kids was fab.
We ate in the bar and the food and service were top class. And the breakfast was unreal.... I would go back for this alone. Pool was great for the kids. Everything was spotless. Will definitely be returning here.",5,2019,11,12
238,Afternoon Tea,"I organised a surprise 40th afternoon tea for my sister in law, the staff were great and the food was fabulous. I’ve had lots of different afternoon teas and I must say this was among the best. The savoury items were a delight, treats gorgeous and there was so much they kindly gave us goodie bags to take home what we couldn’t finish. Fantastic value too. ",5,2019,11,11
238,Excellent value in a lovely location. Really enjoyed our overnight stay. Our meal at Hugo's was really delicious .,The restaurant was lovely and the meal was delicious. All the staff were friendly and helpful. We found the rooms nice and quiet and the beds were very comfortable.  Lots 9f hot water and very soft towels. ,5,2019,11,11
238,Perfect weekend away for couples,"We had an amazing 2 night stay in Druids Glen. We stayed in a suite and the fire was lit when we arrived which was perfect in the cold evening. We thoroughly enjoyed the scenic walking trail around the grounds and made good use of the pool/hot tub/sauna + steam room facilities. 

The food in the bar was delicious however, neither of us really enjoyed our 3-course meal in Hugo's, However, this did not dampen our stay as breakfast was top quality and every staff member was super friendly. Over all the ambience in the hotel was excellent - it was very warm and cosy! 

We would 100% stay again. ",5,2019,11,11
238,Recommending Member of Staff,"On Monday 4th November 2019, we had the pleasure of having breakfast at the Druids Glen Hotel where we met the delightful Barbara. What an absolute lady! She was so pleasant and courteous in her manner. She was also very engaging and communicated with a lovely smile that made the whole experience very enjoyable. Barbara is undoubtedly an asset to the Druids Glen Hotel. It was lovely to meet her and I hope we meet her again soon. People could learn a lot from Barbara. Lovely to see someone who enjoys their work and is very pleasant to everyone. You are a star Barbara. Keep up the good work.",5,2019,11,11
238,Celebrating Engagement,Thanks to Shauna in reservations for creating a lifelong memory of our engagement and making us feel so welcome. Staff at reception were amazingly professional and welcoming. Restaurant staff were amazing and have a real eye for detail and make sure your dinner experience is seamless and memorable. Food was unreal and could not be improved. Bar staff were so welcoming and extremely attentive. Could not recommend this hotel any higher.,5,2019,11,10
238,Kate kane,10/10 for everything really enjoyed my stay will definitely be and would definitely recommend. The hotel was so welcoming we got a great deal in November. The pool was great and warm and so clean everywhere.,5,2019,11,09
238,Don't say you were not warned.   Dissappointing is an understatement old and staff need a course on courtesy,"On arrival, approached reception and while being checked in the woman kept taking phone calls it was very rude and off putting.  

Spa old and worn out robes holes in them and totally overpriced and additional glass of proseco cost E10 shooting themselves in the foot was what we both thought.  Over the top in cost.

For a supposedly called 5 star hotel the wait for dinner was an hour we decided to go to the restaurant as we were hungry.    Again, not good enough for a 5 star hotel.  Wine too expensive and as a wine buff, I know.

 We both felt so irritated decided we were not going to buy wine at all he then tried to sell us drinks. I really felt this was another drive to get us to spend it was very stressful. 

Meal eventually arrived and it was cold and just when we thought it could get any worse it did!  Staff were like headless chickens and although we did feel sorry for the amount of work they had to do, we were paying guests!   

 We had  to wave down a waitress to ask for pepper and a spoon for our sauces. The food, stone cold, the staff were confusing and all over the place.

Next we headed back to the bedroom only to discover we were never going to be able to sleep as there were very strong spotlights right outside each bedroom window 

We were supposed to stay for the weekend a nice romantic break but we packed our bags and headed home the next day never to return

We could have selected from any 3 star hotel in the are which would have given us nice warm food and a warm reception instead, this romantic trip was 
stressful and extremely understaffed with overpriced everything.   Do not fall for the reviews and seriously take a look before you stay overnight in this 1 star hotel",1,2019,11,08
238,Oh how the mighty have fallen new management not the same hotel 1 star,"We have stayed in this hotel two years ago on our annual golf trip to Ireland and how it has changed

On entry the landscaped area was overgrown which was noted immediately and not a good omen.

Stayed for a weekend with golfing buddies and would simply say never again!  Once a 5 star hotel a little gem within the wicklow countryside now a understaffed, stressful atmosphere and a long wait for any food and I mean a long long wait

Staff did their best to be friendly and helpful however, you could plainly see they were exhausted and overworked.  One of our party asked why the dismal feeling compared to our annual trip the last time which was an excellent experience and we were told Under New Management

Food arrived after hours of waiting cold.   One of the steaks was raw on arrival and supposed to be well done     Staff didn't have time to engage with customers as clearly they were under extreme duress

The golf course was overgrown with the sand bunkers sprouting weeds

nothing more to say about this establishment except We will NOT BE BACK

perhaps the new management need to downgrade their 5 stars to a 2 star at present as I have stayed in better 2 stars",1,2019,11,08
238,Complete bliss,"Love visiting Druids Glen.
 Very friendly staff,lovely relaxing atmosphere,delicious food.
Lovely walking areas and a Golfers Paradise.Great Driving Range.Ate in the bar each night,drinks a little expensive.

",5,2019,11,07
238,One night only,"Went for one night with friends. Excellent value. Food was extremely good. Our server was very attentive. Rooms quite large and luxurious with a lovely view of the gardens. Good quantity of tea and coffee capsules provided in the room.
Definitely will return",5,2019,11,05
238,Mid term break,"Beautiful hotel. Friendly, kind and courteous staff to meet and greet. I had a 2 night stay my room was very comfortable, clean and a beautiful view. Breakfast was easily the best I have had in any hotel. Dining in Hugo’s restaurant was exceptional and afternoon tea is something which cannot be missed. Beautiful golf course. I look forward to going back. Thank you",5,2019,11,04
238,"Great hotel, wonderful staff","This is a lovely hotel and I highly recommend it. From the moment we arrived as 3 adults, a toddler and my elderly very infirm mother we were looked after so well by the staff, especially the door man. The decor is fabulous, very luxurious but the hotel is also extremely child friendly. There is a great children’s menu and the food arrives really quickly. The breakfast and all our meals in the bar were also great",5,2019,11,04
238,5 star luxury,"Love this place.. Staff go overboard to make you at home.
Not into Golf but it makes no difference to the experience. The food in the Garden Rooms is excellent especially the fish and chips. Will be back soon.",5,2019,11,04
238,Weekend break,Recent stay to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Brilliant hotel with great facilities and would def consider returning with our family at some stage. Thank you to all the staff who made us feel so welcome and recommended places to visit outside of the hotel. ,4,2019,11,04
238,It was just Ok,"We stayed as a newly engaged couple and paid for the presidential suite (600 per night). Staff were very kind and did all that was asked. However the room had cobwebs around the bed and the windows were filthy it took away from the experience, we were also woken by the kids in the room next to us! 

Overall staff were super and helpful which made a difference but it was certainly not worth the 800 that was spent on the room, spa and food!

Wouldn't be in a hurry to come back and didnt feel there was value for money.",3,2019,11,03
238,Halloween stay,I stayed here with my husband and two boys for two nights over Halloween. The hotel overall is lovely. Our room was nice and spacious and although not recently refurbished very comfortable and quiet. We all had peaceful sleeps! The hotel was very busy-lots of families. This meant that the pool was just too busy. I understand the need for family swim times but perhaps at mid term this rule should be relaxed. There were just too many children in the pool for it to be fun! We had lunch in the bar and dinner in the restaurant. The food in the bar was good.The restaurant meal was delicious and beautifully presented. It is however expensive. Breakfast was delicious- lots of choice and nice food. Queuing for fried eggs at such a busy time  is perhaps unnecessary. Service is always good. The staff were very friendly. My family enjoyed a lovely walk around the grounds which are immaculate and beautiful at this time of year. We really enjoyed our stay and we all left feeling relaxed!,4,2019,11,02
238,Their rating is not deserved,"Maybe we stayed on a bad weekend but what a disappointment. From the beginning we had to queue on check in. We had to pay upfront too which I thought was very unprofessional. The room was spacious and comfortable but furnishings are tired and in need of an upgrade. 
The place was overrun with families with small children. The bar in the afternoon and evening noisy and full of kids running round and ignorant parents who thought it was acceptable for the whole bar to have to endure listening to Peppa pig on their phone to keep their children quiet while they downed their wine. This is great news for families but not so good for couples wanting a relaxing stay away from their own kids. 
The spa was also disappointing. Pool are very small. The treatment and staff were excellent however even if the treatment room was right in reception so I could hear everyone coming and going. Relax room was a joke. Very noisy and the woman beside me decided to make a phone call while there. So bizarre. 
Left the room for 5 hours and still it wasn’t cleaned. Didn’t even bother complaining as I just wanted to rest at that stage. Ordered breakfast in the morning and it was cold and missing have the items ordered. 

Overall this was a disappointing stay. I won’t be back and wouldn’t recommend. This is not a 5* hotel. The one positive was the staff.  All very friendly.",2,2019,11,02
238,Great place for a family break,"Second year running that we have stayed at Druid's Glen during the Halloween mid-term break. Excellent location for accessing Wicklow's great outdoors, which is lovely at this time of year. We enjoyed everything that we ate and drank, and although the hotel was very busy, the staff coped well and were always friendly. We were able to charge our electric car overnight at the hotel, which saved us having to use a public charging station.",4,2019,11,01
238,Family stay at druids glen,Checked into hotel for 3 nights with our kids. Kids club was a hit! Rooms appear a little outdated and hotel appeared to be high occupancy however completely under staffed to handle the crowd. We dined in the hotel and golf club for the entire duration of our stay and always seems to be looking for a waiter to take our order or for additional drinks. Overall the experience was not 5 stars worthy.  ,2,2019,10,31
238,"Lovely Hotel, really relaxed weekend","Travelled here with my husband in Sept for a 2 night stay and loved it. The atmosphere and mood in the hotel was very relaxed and welcoming. There was a wedding on while we stayed but this didnt feel overcrowded as they are in a separate ""wing"" and therefore no extra noise or too many people around. The beds were fantastic to sleep in and I had 2 wonderful nights sleep. Really enjoyed my stay!",4,2019,10,29
238,Druids Glen,"Overall a pleasant stay at Druids Glen Hotel,
Beautiful location, exception restaurant and staff, room standard was avarge though due to a few cleanliness issues. Very friendly and helpful staff in Hugo’s and the breakfast ",4,2019,10,28
238,Loved it would go back!,"Loved it! Everything about it was amazing! Excellent breakfast, and bar food. Room was gorgeous grounds fabulous! The staff are actually really great too! Slightly let down by restaurant; fillet steak wasn’t cooked to liking and starters was mediocre. Desserts excellent!! Only other complaint is pool was too cold! Everything else 5* ",5,2019,10,28
238,Service of room,We enjoyed our stay except for hassle with room not been cleaned after being away all day. Really not acceptable in a 5* hotel. Excuse from Manager was tge hotel was very busy. I don't think that is good enough,4,2019,10,28
238,Highly Recommend,"Myself and my mother stayed for 1 night. We had a fantastic stay and will definitely be back again. The hotel exceeded all expectations. Every staff member was so friendly and attentive. The food was so fresh and tasty. Our room was spotlessly clean, had lovely decor, and the beds were so comfortable we didn't want to get out of them!! We sat in the reception area for a few hours after our meal and it was so comfy and relaxing by the fire. We walked around the grounds of the golf course after breakfast which had beautiful views. I will be recommending this hotel highly to everyone and will definitely be back to stay again!",5,2019,10,27
238,Family weekend away,"As you enter the grounds I wasn’t very impressed I don’t think the hotel makes the most of its proximity to the coast. That said once inside that is soon forgotten and the decor, rooms and staff are all lovely. We found the pool and play room great. Room was lovely too. The only thing that lets it down is the food- it looks great but only tastes ok or below average. Pricey too, definitely needs improving",3,2019,10,24
238,Wedding guest,Fabulous venue for a wedding the staff were very professional and extremely polite. The food was really good and the attention to detail was brilliant . The accommodation was very comfortable and breakfast next day was amazing,5,2019,10,24
238,Lovely hotel poor sleep,Overall this was an excellent hotel.  All the public areas excellent. Food and drink was very good.  Room was of a good standard and clean.  Unfortunately I did not sleep as the pillows were far too soft. There were two extra pillows provided neither of which proved any better.  I must add this was a personal problem as my wife sleep fine.  I just need some firmness to a pillow.  Would not stop me returning.  However I’ll be bringing pillows from home next time!,3,2019,10,22
238,We will be back!,Fantastic break. Lovely food and very relaxing.  Great value. Will return with my husband and would also like to take my mother for her birthday and treat her to a spa treatment. Very easy to find coming from Dublin.  ,5,2019,10,22
238,Anniversary,"It was for my anniversary with my boyfriend. From the second we arrived we were treated like royalty. From the reception team to the dining, spa and room service, everything was perfect, lovely place!",5,2019,10,22
238,"Relax, in comfortable surroundings and enjoy a great nights sleep!","Excellent service, staff extremely helpful and friendly, beautiful setting lovely walking trail around the hotel that I would recommend. Rooms lovely and spacious, beds extremely comfortable, only down side evening meal in Hugo's restaurant very poor, would recommend staying here but give Hugos evening menu a miss",4,2019,10,22
238,Amazing hotel,"Amazing hotel cant wait to return with the kids, only thing I think missing from this hotel is outdoor pool or hot tub but other thank that it was amazing, and breakfast had to have been one of my favourites out of any hotel we have been too.",5,2019,10,22
238,Super Sundays,Lovely hotel and Spa. Great night away to relax and chill out. Dinning experience pretty disappointing. Staff are brilliant and couldn't do and more to help. Room is very spacious and has everything you need.,4,2019,10,22
238,Not 5 star,"Spent two nights at Druids Glen Resort. Check is was very fast and warm lavender towels & friendly staff set us up for what we thought was going to be a great weekend.

When we checked into our room i noticed a stain on the carpet but didn't think anymore of it. We took ourselves off to the pool area - this is not what I would expect from a five star resort, the pool area is just a small leisure centre. Not great for relaxing in at all. Make sure you bring a swim hat or you've to purchase one for a ridiculous price of €3.50. Funny thing is the use  hats doesn't seem to be enforced in the pool so not sure the point of them!!

When we returned to our room it turns out the stain was getting worse on the floor and the wallpaper above was torn. The aircon was leaking and there was a constant drip drip on the floor. We called reception and we're moved rooms which we were thankful for and received a small box of chocolates by way of apology.

The rooms were the exact same. Large and clean but elements are outdated, especially bathrooms and wardrobes.

We ate in the bar the first night and the food was fine, nothing spectacular but it's a comfy bar and staff are very attentive.

Breakfast the next morning was buffet style, no complaints about that.

We went on a nice walk of the Druids Glen walking trail & returned via the shuttle bus to the hotel as I had a treatment booked. I had the coconut wrap which was really lovely and relaxing but I found the relaxation room of the spa v crowded and noisy so couldn't really relax.

Dinner that evening was in Hugo's restaurant. Again food was fine , starters were very big, mains were nice but a bit bland & I opted not to go for a dessert but a coffee instead but the coffee couldn't be substituted for a dessert which was a bit frustrating. I was expecting more from the main restaurant.

We had a few drinks at the bar - it wasn't very well stocked as two different gins I requested were out of stock and then I asked for a glass of the wine of the month and that wasn't available either.

Overall it was a fine visit, not what I expected at all from a five start resort and I am disappointed with what we received overall for paying almost €800 for a two night stay. During our time we witnessed two other couples complain to staff about service and food too so I would imagine that this review won't come as a big surprise to management.

",3,2019,10,21
238,Excellent hotel,Would highly recommend . From start to finish a very enjoyable stay. Will be returning. Wish my stay was longer. They rooms very comfortable. The food excellent and great presentation. The staff very friendly and efficient.,5,2019,10,20
238,Enjoy the elegance," Druids Glen is a wonderful, beautiful and elegant resort with many amenities. The staff was kind and helpful. If I lived in Ireland, I could see myself enjoying this resort as an annual retreat. There were executives, parties and families all enjoying themselves and yet it was very quiet.",5,2019,10,19
238,Very relaxing hotel,"Spent two nights here very relaxing and comfortable, plenty couches and comfy chairs both in restaurant and bar, had dinner in both hugo's restaurant and the garden room ,hugohu a bit expensive but food was amazing,  food in garden rooms very reasonable and gorgeous and fresh and tasty, breakfast also very good and plenty choices, overall good place to stay, staff very friendly and helpful. ",5,2019,10,18
238,Comfortable Stay,We spent a couple of nights before leaving Ireland.  Very welcoming and warm atmosphere.  Nice accommodations and our room was comfortable. The staff was very nice and helpful.  We enjoyed the buffet breakfast.  Would stay there again.,5,2019,10,17
238,Lovely,"Absolutely love this hotel, such a fabulous treat. Rooms gorgeous, spacious and beds comfortable. Staff incredibly kind and welcoming. Went for a lovely walk down around the golf course - so beautiful. Breakfast was divine, the best I've had in a hotel. Food in the bar the night we arrived was ok, nothing special and pricey for what it was. Drink in the bar expensive as well but expected I guess. Pool area was a bit of a let down, not much of a relaxing vibe about it but served it's purpose. All in all, I loved my experience here.",5,2019,10,16
238,Sept Wedding,"We stayed her for a wedding and it was beautiful. We booked as soon as we knew the dates and a result got a cheaper price online. It was worth it. The grounds were heavenly in the gorgeous golden light of September. All staff were friendly, professional, helpful and very accommodating. All the food we had was delicious and fresh. I had an omlette the following morning for breakfast - cooked to perfection. 

Staff at reception were very accommodating, food for wedding was exquisite, really good size portions - we were all stuffed!! I wish I had of made use of the spa area - but it's just an excuse to go back to this hotel (although no excuse needed). 
Would highly recommend this hotel ",5,2019,10,16
238,Family friendly blissful stay,"Welcoming and family friendly staff, family room was spacious with kids robes and slippers which went down a treat, dvd library and kids fun room was a real hit also.  Breakfast was top quality.  Pool very well kept.  Really enjoyed our 1 night stay, would highly recommend.",5,2019,10,15
238,Incredible,One of the best hotels I have stayed in! the staff made it an incredible visit every single staff member went out of their way to make me feel comfortable and took an interest. The bed was extremely comfortable the attention to detail was impeccable and the spa facilities luxurious and extremely clean I will be visiting again thank you !,5,2019,10,15
238,Not 5 star hotel,I went with my daughter to experience the spa. It definitely not 5 star standard. The relaxation room is small and not relaxing very noisy. Been in better spas in 3 star hotels. Food average in bar. Staff very friendly. Breakfast was excellent and definitely 5 star quality.  Don't think I'll be back not what I expected ,3,2019,10,14
238,Druids review,"Lovely hotel and staff but felt ripped of by cost of dinner in bar despite having dinner package in Hugo's, awakened at 2 in the morning by drunken guests in room next door, pity as the hotel is lovely and staff friendly ",3,2019,10,13
238,"As Always, perfection","Each and everytime we stay we do jot want to leave, and when we are leaving we can not wait to return. We stay  four or five times a year and will vontinue to do so for a very, very long time. Food, service, comfort and cleanliness are always, and I mean always, excellent",5,2019,10,12
238,Family friendly,"This was our first “holiday” with baby so I was a little apprehensive as sometimes he can be good bad and cry. I shouldn’t have worried hotel caters for all the family.

First day of arrival and young concierge had baby all smiles. He also helped us out of a pickle when we forgot our room key 🙈 very pleasant young man and went out of his way to help us.

The host at breakfast is wonderful and she couldn’t do enough for you. Plenty of chat and made us feel at ease with the baby as he can get a little excited around food. I was a little disappointed though at the breakfast on offer - I would have thought a 5star hotel would at least had eggs benedict in the menu. The selection of cheeses also was not varied and the hot food I felt was also limited - no beans or mushrooms. The potato cubes were a massive let down - looked out of a frozen bag and tasted very dry. Should they not be fresh? I am a massive foodie and would have loved to have seen that the food was all local produce through labels or pamphlet. However the breakfast we had was good but I’ve had better.... lough eske is the one to beat. Very impressed high chair was spotless - usually I am getting out my detol wipes 🤣

Room was beautiful and absolutely spotless! I am very ocd and couldn’t fault it. 1 niggle we didn’t have conditioner in the room- did they forget to put one in or do they not offer this? 

Impressed they had a baby pantry - facilities to wash bottles, there was available steriliser and had a cupboards that said wipes and nappies although there was no wipes and the nappies for for newborn, but in any case great idea.

Spa was amazing and again it was spotless! There was a guy in and out polishing the handrails and a lady was forever cleaning the changing rooms and mopping the floor. 

Must mention the public areas of the hotel were so clean - no cobwebs unders the lamp shades or finger prints on doors, I could t even find dust! Brilliant job from the housekeeping staff!

Overall I would definitely stay here again as it was so relaxing and co Wicklow is beautiful. 

Thanks for having us,

Mum dad and baby 👱‍♀️👱‍♂️👶🏼",4,2019,10,10
238,Disgusted with our stay!!!!!,"Druids Glen is rated a 5 star & as such we were greatly anticipating our trip. To say 
 we were disappointed is an understatement!!!!!!!! 
 It was my Brother-in-laws 70th birthday & the first insult came when we checked in & he was told he was been given an upgrade, he got no upgrade. We began our stay with lunch, I would have to say it was just OK (the staff were excellent) We then went to the pool area which in my opinion is not a 5 star facility & was crowded with children, they did have one lane available for swimmers. The dinner that evening was the biggest disappointment, we have had better food  & service in our local restaurant for half the price. I am not hard to please but, when you pay a premium rate for a 5 star facility....... that's what you expect & in this instance we didn't receive it. I felt very sorry for my Sister-in-Law who paid a hefty bill thinking her husband would have a memorable 70th Birthday which he didn't. I would never recommend this venue to anyone!!!!!",2,2019,10,10
238,Excellent stay at the ‘Glen’,"Just returned to Scotland after a 3 night stay at the Druids Glen. The hotel is lovely but it is the staff who 100% make the whole experience. After our first night we had a few problems with our room, but this was sorted out in a very professional manner by the Duty Manager Albert. We were assigned a new room and given a beautiful suite. Breakfast in the morning is definitely the best you will experience at any hotel. We were greeted each morning by Barbara who was very welcoming and all the breakfast staff are lovely. The hotel does a courtesy shuttle bus to Greystones where it is easy to pick up the DART to go into Dublin City for a day out. The men who drive the shuttle are wonderful, very knowledgeable and extremely helpful. Without a doubt the service at this hotel is outstanding and it is a credit to find a hotel where the staff are all so welcoming and go the extra mile to ensure you have a pleasant trip. Finally, we ate out one of the nights in the hotel bar and the food was great too. If you are looking for a hotel with exceptional service, beautiful surroundings, great food and a getaway from the hussle and bussle then this hotel is the place to go. (The reception staff need to be mentioned too, they are all lovely, extremely helpful and courteous).",5,2019,10,09
238,"Hotel fab, Spa let it down though",Hotel fab but Spa let it down i feel. Relaxation room has treatment rooms off it so people moving through all the time so not very relaxing. The recption area of spa small &treatment rooms off this so we were moved out onto top of stairs 2fill out consultation forms just let it down for 5* hotel,4,2019,10,08
238,Excellent Stay ,"Visited at Druids Glen for a recent family wedding. From help offered to unload the car to bottle of water given on departure we had a great stay. Rooms clean, food beautiful and excellent facilities for children. Highly Recommend ",5,2019,10,07
238,5 Stars? Really?,"Having been surprised with a trip away for my birthday, to say I was excited was an understatement.

Unfortunately this definitely did not live up to the hype. I have heard numerous great reviews from friends and family over the years about Druids Glen.

Having arrived to the room I put on my robe to go to the spa and  put my hand in the pocket only to find a dirty tissue (visibly used) against the wishes of my girlfriend I decided not to complain as I didn't want to make a big issue of it and start the weekend end off on a bum note.

The Saturday we then spent the day relaxing and ordered some room service for lunch, the chowder arrived and was less than lukewarm, again not wanting to complain I just got on with it as I didn’t want my girlfriend worrying as it was a special weekend for us that she had spent a lot of money on. Later that evening we ordered a number of things for room service for dinner. The food took quite some time to come (1hr 10 minutes) and when the food arrived my pork bap was lovely but the calamari and the sweet potato fries were completely cold the chicken wings were soggy but were still hot so we didn’t mention this when we called reception.
 
We were offered a refund for the two cold items and asked if there was anything they could send over to apologise for this, we agreed to get a “complimentary” desert and were even offered two which we turned down and said one was enough. When the desert arrived and they were processing the refund the gentleman then took 8 euro out of the refund to cover the price of the desert. Once again biting my tongue I just left it as to note sour the weekend.

Upon leaving we raised the issues with reception and the lady seemed completely uninterested and proceeded to try and charge us 3.50 for a swimming hat purchased at the spa on the first day. She then disappeared to the back for a few moments and returned to inform us they were ""letting us off"" with the charge and thanked us for staying.

My girlfriend was visibly upset with how the weekend had gone but I was left confused more than anything as to how all the reviews contrasted to our experience.",2,2019,10,07
238,The most relaxing 5 star experience,"Druids Glen know exactly how a 5 star resort should work.My husband and I spent a weekend here before the arrival of our first baby. From the onset we were offered hot lavender towels along with the most warm and friendly welcome .Our room was comfortable and very clean. The atmosphere throughout the resort was relaxed, and there was plenty of areas to chill out and read a book. Dining options were excellent, bar staff very well trained. Spa/leisure facilities were excellent too. The breakfast was really well executed, so many options. Fresh produce, staff attentive. I have to commend all staff members of their attention to detail, in particular Alan on the front desk who really went above and beyond and also Karen on reservations who was very kind. We are dying to make another trip to Druids Glen Resort. Thank you so much for a wonderful,relaxing stay",5,2019,10,07
238,Excellent stay at Druids Glen,"What a lovely place to stay.  So welcoming, friendly and a great atmosphere.  Excellent room, big and clean.  Beds so comfortable. Evening meal and breakfast really good quality. Swimming pool very clean as well as spa area.  Only gripe - on Saturday morning no lane to swim in whilst swimming lessons were taking place.  Will be definitely returning - very soon !",5,2019,10,06
238,Amazing Stay!,Everything about our stay was amazing. The food in the restaurant is delicious with a lovely selection of dishes. Every member of staff went above and beyond in their customer service and they were very accommodating. Couldn't fault our stay whatsoever,5,2019,10,06

238,Excellent for families and couples alike,"We loved it, the atmosphere was relaxed but luxurious, the staff are excellent and we never lacked things to do. Really good food and spa treatments from heaven. There were a mix of groups staying at the hotel; lots of families, golfing groups and couples. Despite this it was easy to be considerate of non-family groups without impinging on our own enjoyment.",5,2019,10,05
238,Family Break,Excellent stay from start to finish and the service was 10/10. Very suitable for families. Breakfast was one of the best we have had in any hotel in Ireland. We don't play golf but not important at all. Great day trips in the local area.,5,2019,10,05
238,Absolute perfection,Druids Glen is the perfect location for a luxurious break. The Spa has to be experienced and the food and rooms are really special. Although 5star it is a very friendly hotel. Children are very welcome too.,5,2019,10,05
238,Well Done!,"I live only 20 minutes away from Druids Glen, I decided to come down to have a bite to eat with a few of my friends. The lunch menu was brilliant and the food so nice. When we were leaving we noticed our tyre was flat. Mark -( he said he worked on the reception) was leaving to go home. He helped us change it! His kind gesture speaks volumes for the type of people working there. We'll be back (hopefully for the night to!)",5,2019,10,04

238,Anniversary break,"front of house let it down so badly :( when you are staying in a 5 star hotel you expect to be greeted really well not how we were at all very expensive with little customer service 
positives were the restaurant was lovely as was the spa ",3,2019,09,30
238,Anniversary Break,"We had the best night away for our anniversary. Greeted with smiles as we arrived. All staff are so friendly and cant do enough. The little extra touches, from chocolates in our room, a turn down service and bottles of water for the journey home. Beautiful grounds and a super location for exploring Wicklow. We've already booked a return visit with the kids.",5,2019,09,29
238,Mini honeymoon break,"We had initially booked one night here through a luxury breaks website that included dinner and a bottle of prosecco but enjoyed ourselves so much that we decided to stay an additional night, the staff were extremely helpful and friendly, my wife had a headache on the first night and when I asked reception for aspirin, they send up a whole packet free of charge to our room, 
I can't remember her name but the lady at the front desk with short red hair was excellent, she arranged for another bottle of prosecco to be sent to our room on our second night once she heard we were on a mini honeymoon ",5,2019,09,29
238,Derek and Barbara Preston,We have been staying regularly in Druid's Glen for a number of years. We have never had a bad experience or any reason to complain about anything -- big or small. A message for the new owners - if it ain't broke don't fix it!,5,2019,09,29
238,Margaret obrien,No body can ever complain best hotel ever I go to hotels 6 to 9 times a month my first time staying in this hotel it was  fantastic  the kids loved everything  the staff was very friendly and helpful and so kind ,5,2019,09,27
238,Great hotel but let down in places,"I recently stayed in the hotel with my wife during a small mid week break. Initially we checked in and everything was great, we where looked after and we were both happy with our stay. However on the second night while in the bar before our meal we decided to head to the bar for a cocktail or two before dinner. I went to the bar to order and was taken back by the attitude of staff. I don’t know if it was because I ordered two cocktails that the staff member was unhappy to serve me. Anyway he began to make the drinks but yet I was let stand around for what was 20 minutes waiting for my drinks. Hi be been in many fine hotels in ireland and was always looked after really well. I stood and I waited for a long time while staff members just stood behind the bar. I was given my drinks and a paid up yet this staff member had a serious attitude on him. I took the drinks back to my wife and I complained to eat a duty or bar manager who was floating around, even as I stood like a spare p***k for 20 minutes at the bar never offered an apology. The norm here would be place your order, pay and drinks would be taken to your table. It really left a sour taste in what would have been a brilliant stay. We went on to have an amazing meal where we were properly take. Care of.",3,2019,09,25
238,Excellent – will be back,"My golf group (12 lads) visited Druids Glen in late September since we had heard many nice things regarding the two golf courses and the hotel. This was our first visit, but I can guarantee it is not our last. 

As expected, the facilities were very good and we enjoyed a wonderful time at the golf courses. But what really was beyond our expectations was the service. The staff was so kind and always willing to help and make us welcome and comfortable. Job well done to all of them!

I must also mention the great service I received from Gretta Doyle who was always willing to take care of all the adjustments our group had to make prior our visit.",5,2019,09,25
238,Excellent hotel and staff,"Thoroughly enjoyed our short stay at Druids Glen. The staff were friendly and  very good at their jobs. The hotel has a lovely atmosphere. The food was fabulous. The room was lovely and had a beautiful view.

238,Romantic weekend break,"Had an amazing time here for a weekend break. All the staff were brilliant and couldn't do enough to make us feel welcome, right from the receptionist at the start of our stay. It helped that we were upgraded!
The bar food was perfect the first evening, with professional, friendly and a huge amount of staff that were always on hand. We had a lovely walk through the grounds to the clubhouse and enjoyed a few drinks on the roof top terrace. 
The restaurant was top dining. They fit us in when they were busy, but you didn't feel that way when dining. The hostess was great at her job, professional, but chatty too. Our waiter was also brilliant at his job, a perfect amount of chat, gave great recommendations. I wish I knew his name to mention, he was a French man. We choose Hake and pulled pork for our mains, and they were the best we've had. 
All in all, it was a perfect weekend. I think it's the staff that really make it that bit more special.",5,2019,09,23
238,If Carlsberg did Hotels it would be Druid’s Glen Hotel & Sps,"I bought my partner to this hotel for her birthday 🎂 and boy did this hotel lay on a perfect 24 hours . At reception when we arrived we got 1,000 welcomes from the receptionist. The room was stunning. The view from the room overlooked a stunning golf tee box . The bed was so comfortable. Pillows mmm not great as I like a solid pillow . The swimming leisure centre was top notch and we were able to get ready in our room and put on a towel dressing gown and slippers and walk to the swimming area. The food we had in the bar was gorgeous and reasonably priced . The service was exceptional. I mentioned that it was my partners birthday and the waitress came out with a cake & candles and sang happy birthday with two of her colleagues. I would have no hesitation in strongly recommending this beautiful hotel ",5,2019,09,23
238,"Great staff, amazing hotel.  A must for a treat!","We previously stayed at DG for an overnight.  We loved it so much that we re booked to try soak up some more of what the hotel had to offer.

Huge thumbs up as not all hotels cater to this extent.",5,2019,09,23

Staff are amazing ,5,2019,09,22

238,Excellent stay,Excellent hotel for both couples and families. We traveled with our 18 month old and would highly recommend.

238,Great time,This is my first review ever.  Golfed at Druids Glen and had a great time.  The course was in good condition and the layout wonderful.  Stayed in hotel as this was our base for the weekend. Loved every minute,5,2019,09,17
238,Wish we could stay longer,"This property is a bit remote, but that's the idea.  It's a very nice resort with very well-maintained grounds and building.  We only stayed one night before heading to Dublin for our flight the next day, but we'll be sure to return when we come back to Ireland.",5,2019,09,16

238,Tranquility at its best,"A lovely hotel with very nice staff in a beautiful setting, Spa treatment was second to none! Although the relaxation room had alot of traffic and wasn't as peaceful as I'd like. The walking trail and druids glen golf course are a must! ",5,2019,09,11
238,Lovely stay in this lovely hotel,"Was delighted on arrival to have been upgraded to a suite. The setting of the hotel is very beautiful, with a lovely woodland walk. The playground is also a great addition for those with young children.",5,2019,09,09

My room was one of the best I have stayed in",5,2019,09,09
238,Wedding guests,We stayed here as wedding guests as the reception was hosted at this hotel.  The food and service were extremely good at the wedding.  The staff overall were very helpful and friendly.  The breakfast was disappointing as we had been looking forward to Irish sausages but found them very bland and the bacon salty.  Our room was really lovely and quiet too with extremely comfortable pillows.,4,2019,09,08
238,Perfect hours,"Just returned from a night in Druids Glen with family. From the second we walked in the door we recieved a warm welcome from Oli at the door he brought us right over to reception where we were welcomed warmly as it was early our rooms weren't ready so our bags were quickly taken and stored an we were told our keys would be sent to the spa so we wouldn't have to come back and check in.
Treatments in the spa were amazing and Michelle an Ruth couldn't do enough for us between showing us around and organising our afternoon tea. 
Food was lovely and every staff member was beyond helpful.",5,2019,09,08
238,Midweek Break,"Visited for a midweek break in September. 
On arrival we were greeted by Barry at reception. He was excellent. Courteous, friendly and helpful. Facilitated our stay really well. Gave us all the info we needed and helped us decide our POA for our stay. 
The room was class, clean and comfy. 
The pool and spa was really good (I’d recommend bringing your own swimming caps, but they provide them for a fee). 
We dined in the bar where the staff again were helpful and friendly. The food was very good. We had the calamari and the steak. 
Wine and Cocktails were delicious. 
Breakfast was yum the following morning with a great selection on offer. 
We took a stroll around their lovely walking route where the flora and fauna are interesting, and when we decided we couldn’t do the full thing they sent a courtesy car to collect us from the clubhouse. 
I’d recommend highly as we enjoyed our stay thoroughly.

238,Really great hotel for families,Fantastic hotel for families from the baby pantry to the playroom to the playground it had everything we needed. We ibny stayed one night but easily could’ve stayed longer-plenty to do. The rooms were comfortable and the extra touches of the kids robes & slippers & kids products in the bathroom were a lovely touch. Best breakfast buffet I’ve had in a hotel too. Couldn’t recommend the hotel enough. ,5,2019,09,07
238,Absolutely Superb,"Visited for a 3 night life decompression, worth the trip out as it’s a lovely hotel, great facilities and wonderful service.

I’d recommend getting a hire car to visit to give some flexibility to see the surrounding area and easy transfer to the airport. It’s a 50 minute trip.

The staff have been amazing. Thank you",5,2019,09,06
238,"Favorite hotel, far beyond 5 stars. Highly recommend this luxurious hotel","We had a brilliant stay as always in a Druids Glen, we have stayed in this hotel 7/8 times before. The staff are so pleasant and professional, spa and pool are gorgeous, the food is always delicious & this is the best hotel I have ever been to in Ireland. Highly recommend, it’s outstanding & far beyond 5 stars. Cannot wait to return to Druids Glen. ",5,2019,09,04
238,"Good, could be better","OK, so I have been thinking about travelling to the Druids Glen Hotel for a while now and finally took the plunge with my wife and baby. I had high expectations as this is a five star hotel and would be a step up from some of the excellent four stars we have visited around Ireland. So what was I looking for on arrival, a warm welcome at the front desk which didn't happen, the lady barely said hello (OUCH) BAD START. Before we even begin our stay I have a negative feeling already, terrible service at front desk. The rooms are nice but could do with a touch of paint. Pillows are soft feather which i could not sleep on, asked for firm ,hard pillows and they dont have any. I asked for ear plugs at reception because im a light sleeper, none either(small things but have got them in four star hotels. The garden bar has lovely scenery but I found myself looking for waitress,s instead of being waited on. Pool area is good and have to say that the staff are great apart from the dry front desk. Food good but not excellent. All in all I would give the hotel four stars as it does not deserve the 5 star status. As I said we expected 5 star treatment and didnt get that. Maybe they should focus more on first impressions especially at front desk.",4,2019,09,04
238,Great stay!,"We stayed just one night and found everything to be perfection! Couldn't find fault really, One small thing is that I would like to see fresh milk (in the fridge as there is one) for tea/coffee making.",5,2019,09,02

My son 10 and not much to entertain him. NOT HOTEL FAULT. Area seems more for younger kids. If they had either karting, archery or other things for around 10 to 16year old then we'd be back again.

Initially we planned to stay one night but enjoyed it so much booked a second night and this was no hassle to organise. The hotel&especially the staff are fantastic and very friendly. Nothing was too much trouble. We were also upgraded room for both nights for the original rate. Breakfast is also a high point. We had a treatment in the spa which was very good and used the gym which while not huge was very well equipped. We will definitely be back. ,5,2019,08,30
238,A luxurious finale to a tour of Ireland.,"We stayed at the Druids Glen as the finale to a two week car tour of Ireland.  It lived up to expectations in terms of luxury, the reception was grand and the rooms very well equipped and presented.  Bathroom was opulent. There's a lovely walk through the estate to the golf course clubhouse and the grounds have lovely landscaped ponds around the championship golf course.  There are two restaurants, we ate in the bar restaurant.  Service was very good and the quality of the food exceptional.  Breakfast was also ample and well presented.  I would certainly consider a short break here in the future to take advantage of all of the facilities and its a short drive from Dublin airport.",5,2019,08,29
238,Few days away,"I can not fault this hotel...it’s always delivers 👍🏼 All the staff are friendly and we will return in the future.
This having to use 200 characters is a bit annoying tho...........
.....these dots sure do help 😜",5,2019,08,28
238,Excellent resort,"Excellent Hotel. Great facilities, very clean, and great service from very friendly staff. Cannot wait to go back. Druids Heath is a good course, but Druids Glen Golf Course is fantastic. Well worth a visit.",5,2019,08,27
238,Amazing Spa day,"Wonderful experience in Druids Glen Spa. We enjoyed a day spa package which included use of the leisure facilities, lunch and treatment. The pool facilities was really clean and nice. Lunch was excellent and staff really friendly. The treatment was amazing, we could stay in the relaxation area as much as we wanted and it was really comfortable and relaxing. I definitely recommend this package and I will probably do it again soon",4,2019,08,27
238,What a great hotel,"I visited the hotel on the 8th August for a cousins wedding and i have to say that the hotel and staff are superb. The hotel has great facilities gym, swimming pool etc and great food and drink. I would definitely go again and thanks also to Barry on reception he is a star!",5,2019,08,27
238,Wonderful experience,"The beautiful weather we had on arrival highlighted the fantastic setting of Druids Glen which was more than matched by our welcome in the hotel. A surprise upgrade to a suite was a lovely touch, the room was amazing. Couldn't recommend the hotel more, thanks to the staff for their wonderful service! ",5,2019,08,27
238,margaret murphy,"Excellent food ,great service and friendly staff ,lovely bedroom and very comfortable.
Gardens and walks just fabulous. Stunning setting .Wedding meal was just excellent and breakfast was very good great selection to please everyone , I'll be back .Thank you ",5,2019,08,26
238,Special Occasion,"We cannot rate Druids Glen highly enough, we celebrated our first wedding anniversary and are going through a problematic pregnancy so we thoroughly appreciate the understanding of all the staff and and exception made to accommodate our needs. The staff were so helpful and understanding from point of booking and throughout our stay, always ready with tips or advice on busy pool times, eating options etc . We were upgraded to a suite which was absolutely wonderful, we really enjoyed the space, the extremely comfortable bed, and the quiet particularly given that it's a popular time for children, we heard nothing and could sleep soundly. 

The food in Hugo's was phenomenal, and had the added unexpected bonus of not given this pregnant person heartburn!! Breakfast was also great and huge, plenty of choice for those avoiding the traditional fry. The spa was so relaxing and the therapists were really excellent and knowledgeable.
 We loved the grounds, and being able to get a lift back after doing the lovely nature walk over to the clubhouse for a lovely terrace drink. Every staff member we came in contact with was friendly and helpful and we really felt looked after. 
Thank you for helping us have a wonderful first wedding Anniversary! 
We found the place to be squeaky clean too, loved the l'occitaine toiletries, and were delighted to find decaf coffee for the nespresso!",5,2019,08,26
238,Druids Glen,Top class resort. Druids Glen Golf Course is wonderful and beautifully maintained. The pool area in the hotel is fantastic also. Bar food was good and service was excellent. Would certainly recommend and we look forward to returning again for a longer stay next time.,5,2019,08,25
238,Wedding,Have never met friendlier staff. They were brilliant from start to finish. so good with all the kids. Food and drinks were top quality. Rooms were immaculate. Great place for kids to play in aswel they loved pool,5,2019,08,25
238,Wicklow visit.,"Fantastic hotel, staff very accommodating. The highlight was our dining experience in the garden room and the breakfast each morning. We all slept really well in the quality beds and bedding. Only gripe is that the room needed a better clean, dust cobwebs and the carpet needed a Hoover. Enjoyed the stay despite this.",5,2019,08,24
238,Family summer break,"Excellent hotel with great facilities for the family. We particularly enjoyed the pool, walking trail and use of the driving range. Breakfast was superb with freshly cooked pancakes a particular favourite with my daughter. Room was very comfortable and all staff were very polite, courteous and helpful. These personal touches and attention to detail made our stay extra special. ",5,2019,08,24
238,Marvellous family resort,"We had a great stay at Druid’s Glen resort. Rooms are large and spacious and exceptionally clean. We had a view of the golf course and it was beautiful. All staff we encountered were friendly and went out of their way to chat to the kids. The reception staff were excellent. Very efficient. The doorman was funny. Food was tasty if a little overpriced. Same with the drinks .... gorgeous cocktails etc but overpriced. The swimming pool was clean and well maintained. Changing rooms were spotless. Excellent showers with shampoo and conditioner provided. The facilities for children were outstanding. A welcome pack on arrival, small robes in the room, a games room with arcade games, movies, air hockey etc. A further games room on the third floor with table tennis, pool table, giant jenga and connect 4. Then there is also the driving range on site. And an outdoor play park. The kids had a great time. As did we. Very relaxing and will definitely be back. Short drive from shops and restaurants in the local towns. And very close to Greystones with its lovely Main Street and beaches.",5,2019,08,24
238,Feeling let down ,"We are big advocates of Druids Glen. This was our fourth year we’ve had a (rare) child-free night here, always on the same Thursday before the UK bank holiday. It’s a big treat and we always look forward to our stay. 

The hotel’s facilities and our room were as lovely as always. However, this year the atmosphere in the hotel felt different. In previous years there has been a good mix of families, golfing groups and couples. This year seemed to be mostly families with young children and large groups of golfers. The pool was absolutely rammed with kids. The outside seating area was taken over by groups of golfers in the evening.

But our biggest disappointment was Hugo’s. This is the main reason we return year after year - it has always been a special, romantic meal. Previously couples have been seated separately to families, which worked really well. It always felt romantic and intimate. This year we were sat alongside families with young children who were getting restless as it was getting late (we arrived for dinner for 8.30pm). The service was disappointing. They just didn’t have enough staff serving. Every interaction with the staff was met with an apology. It took ages to get our drinks. The set menu has gone (we paid nearly $80 for one course each!). Our main courses arrived, and we had to wait for our sides. Our bill was wrong. I’m not one to complain but I went straight to see the restaurant manager after our meal. To be fair to her, she handled it really well, and deducted the cost of our drinks. I was still bitterly disappointed. 

Will we return for a fifth time? Probably not, I’m afraid. Our time alone together as a couple is too precious to risk being disappointed again. ",3,2019,08,23
238,Great Customer Service,"My wife and I traveled to Ireland in April. We stayed at many different hotels, but Druids Glen was the most client oriented. The location and golf course are lovely, as are the rooms, but what stood out was the great customer service. I had left my prescription glasses at a different hotel a few days earlier. They found them, and I asked that they send them to Druids Glen, since it was the last hotel in Ireland where we were going to stay. Unfortunately, the glasses didn't arrive while we were still in Ireland. Luckily Silvia Kruse at Druids Glen forwarded them to me back in Minnesota. It was a great relief. I wear contact lenses during the day. but glasses in the evening, and I was fortunate not to have to get a new pair quickly. 
  Our only regret about Druids Glen was that it was our last hotel in Ireland, and we had to leave after a short night's stay to get to the Dublin airport before rush hour traffic set in. We will make sure to have a longer visit our next time in Ireland.",5,2019,08,23
238,Short Trip,"Great Resort, top class service and fantastic Golf Course (Glen),
All expectations where met and all staff where courteous and helpful. Food was fresh and cooked as one would expect. Not one bad aspect to the visit. ",5,2019,08,23
238,Highly Recommended,Really enjoyed our stay -  very relaxing - in a great location - great service - lovely staff - beautiful grounds - if you want a get away break with family - this is the place to go - wish I played golf but tempted after seeing the course.,5,2019,08,22
238,Lovely Stay,"Stayed here for one night with my family. Really lovely hotel. Buffet breakfast was great. Lovely pool area, playground and games room for children. Very family friendly hotel. The bar area is lovely and there is a nice area outside to sit too. Rooms are lovely and spacious. Beautiful lobby, reception staff very friendly and helpful particularly Emily. Loved it!:-)",5,2019,08,21
238,family treat to a golfer widows prison,"stayed with the wife and daughters and very impressed with the hospitality and warmth of the staff, a great location to discover the local area. the rooms were great and warm and double beds in both rooms, the spa treatments are a must for all guests",5,2019,08,21
238,Definitely not a 5 star to me...,"I don't know that I've ever stayed in a 5-star hotel, but this was not what I was expecting. The good things first, beds were comfortable and there were big, fluffy towels. They provided child- and adult-sized robes and slippers in the room and although I didn't use them, I appreciate them being there if I wanted to. My husband and son were impressed with the size and variety of things in the health club. We did not utilize the spa. The breakfast buffet in Hugo's was great. It was not included in our stay but I thought 15 Euro per person was very reasonable for what we got. Negatives, there was mold in the shower and cobwebs in the bathroom. Many stains in the carpeting in hallways. I thought the food in the Garden Bar was just ok. The thing I was most surprised about were the number of children. Our child is 20, so I know we're not used to having little ones around, but this hotel was taken over by families with lots and lots of children. I assumed that a 5 star with 2 golf courses would be more of an adults destination. I would not go back if given the option. We were spoiled at our previous destination on this trip at a Villa in Adare.",3,2019,08,21
238,Worth a visit,"Overall stay and experience was worth the visit, sunday lunch is great value too in Hugo's , beds are extremely comfortable and the spa was fabulous with very welcoming staff , there also seems to be lots to do for kids  with a great playroom for all ages",5,2019,08,20
238,A great stay and lovely staff,"A family gathering.. Our Dad in a wheelchair and Mum a walking stick, staff could not have been more helpfull and just so good.. The hotel is lovely, the grounds amazing, kids loved it.  Went to golf club for dinner OMG the staff just so nice..",4,2019,08,20
238,"Wonderful, Relaxing Experience ","I visited Druids Glen today with some family as a treat for my cousin’s birthday, and we all thoroughly enjoyed our visit. We had availed of a special offer package of a 55 minute spa treatment and afternoon tea, which was excellent value for money. We arrived early and spent some time unwinding in the well equipped and beautifully appointed leisure club before our treatments. The spa itself is luxurious and very comfortable, with little extras such as fresh fruit and inspirational reading material adding to the experience. Suitably relaxed after our treatments (which were to die for!), we made our way to the dining room for a sumptuous afternoon tea, complete with a glass of Prosecco. Utterly delicious! All of the staff were extremely friendly and could not have been more helpful. We all came away feeling totally rejuvenated and planning our next visit! Highly recommended.",5,2019,08,17
238,Excellent short family stay with infant,"We had a lovely stay with our 7 month old. It was a great break with lovely staff. There were many family’s there with many nice touches such as the pantry, play area and pool. We ate in room and at the bar, both of which were great. Overall a very relaxed break for us all and we’ll be back!  ",5,2019,08,17
238,Would give higher rating if not so overpriced ,"Stayed as a family of four over a weekend and would summarise as:

Fantastic layout, design and feel to the place - the staff are all excellent and very friendly and attentive to families. Rooms are well equipped and the beds are very comfy.

Surroundings are attractive and well kept but the walking trail was a bit of a non-event.

Spa / pool area is nice but the pool is a bit too small to cope with busy family weekends.

Food was good in the bar / restaurant area which has a good lively atmosphere but the prices are way over the top for what is offered which is my only gripe in general... Druids Glen is a nice resort to stay at but it really is way overpriced for what is on offer.",3,2019,08,17
238,Family focus definitely found here,My family and I just spent a week camping and exploring Wicklow. .  After hiking for miles we stopped in at Druid's Glen for much needed refreshments.  We were served in the lobby and staff were really pleasant and friendly. Biscuits for the children gratefully and readily received.  We made a point to go back before our Wicklow trip ended.  A lovely hotel with a heavy focus on customer service.  This family will certainly try to get back to stay.,5,2019,08,17
238,Couple,Nice Hotel. friendly staff. lovely walks and gardens. Food was good. Rooms spacious. perfect for a night away. near dublin. great parking. good driving range golf course looked amazing. very family friendly                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ,4,2019,08,17
238,Disappointed,Needs a better Spa set up and better detail to cleaning in bathroom would be nice to have a choice of evening meal with offers to use the restaurant or bar room as was not really interested in a heavy meal,3,2019,08,16
238,Amazing family hotel,"Went to Druids Glen for four nights two adults and five children amazing hotel for families swimming pool,Playground,driving range and a playroom with Xbox air hockey foosball  movies games books a ball pit play kitchen area and more.you won't be able to get out of the beds best sleep ever and when you do you will eat the most fantastic breakfast you ever tasted there's a live pancake and omelette station so much to choose from everything delicious, Rooms amazing air conditioning Elmeis products in huge bathroom with bath and shower kingsize beds robes and slippers you won't want to leave.The leisure centre was brilliant kids loved it they even have a little machine in the changing rooms for drying swim outfits. Found all staff were exceptionall and friendly especially Bradley on reception  he should be cloned and put in every hotel in Ireland.  So much to do outside hotel as well beautiful beaches nearby bray petfarms clara lara the list goes on.this was our third visit since May to Druids Glen  every time it comes on pigsback I book it  that's how amazing it is its a must-see.",5,2019,08,16
238,3 night stay and Evening meal,"We stayed at the Druids Glen for 3 nights for our 25th Wedding Anniversary.  Overall we were very happy with our stay. The location is convenient to Bray and Glendalough. The staff were lovely and there was a real homely feeling about the place. The breakfast was fantastic and particularly so for my wife who is gluten and dairy free. The room was spacious and quiet, the gym well equipped and the fitness classes are worth looking into.... You won't be disappointed. ",5,2019,08,16
238,Wicklow Gem,"Most enjoyable stay in this hotel which is very suited to family stays. Baby pantry on 2nd floor superb idea. Ideal location. Short spin to powerscourt waterfall, glendalough etc Staff amazing and food divine. Would highly recommend it. .",5,2019,08,16
238,Family holiday heaven,So I'm just home from two night stay from this luxorious hotel feeling totally revived with my family. From the moment we arrived the place was so accommodating. There was 4 of us... Two kids. They upgraded us to a suite and it was out of this world. I swear myself and my husband hadn't slept like that in years. The bed was amazing and the space was so so great for the kids. It was the little touches that meant so much. Like they rang a few times checking up on us in our room. Our bags were brought to the room for us. They gave us chocolates and the kids cookies and milk and a lovely card. They brought us more little chocolates in the evening and closed our curtains for us and had the bed ready for us. Like I cannot explain.. They couldn't have done more. It is VERY family orientated and they are more than accommodating towards children which is so lovely for a 5 star. The kids club was amazing. My son had after noon tea there and made new friends. They were so thorough and accommodating with him. He went in on his own so they really minded him. It was so much more professional than any of the other kids clubs I have witnessed before. The staff were brilliant and I checked in on him but he sent me off on my merry way. He had a ball!! The 2 young girls here in particular were incredibly kind to him and made me feel at ease as I dropped him off coz I was apprehensive. Jesus there is so so much to praise this place about. If I could give it 10 stars I would. The views are incredible. The druids Glen walkway is so so so beautiful. You do not have to to leave the hotel area atall to have an amazing holiday. Its so pretty and the waterfall and flowers are fabulous. Loved it 🙈 The guy at the reception desk.. I'm not sure of his name...he could possibly be the manager but he was so so warm and welcoming and went beyond and back to meet our needs. Overall the staff were excellent. Even the fact that the hotel has games and dvds to choose from in the evening time for the kids is great and two tvs and a dvd players in our suite. The hotel itself is so so beautiful. Anyhow we will definately be back and i will be recommending it to everyone I can. Greystones is such a few minutes away from it and lovely scenic areas are all around the hotel. We were blown away it.. The druids Glen is a definite place to visit and stay if possible. Only problem is you won't want to leave!,5,2019,08,15
238,"Great service, nice room","The service from the hotel staff was outstanding.   We were a little disappointed to see rust in the water in the bathroom sink, however the staff provided ample bottled water for drinking and the rest of the room was very nice.  Loved the high quality coffee machine in the room.",3,2019,08,15
238,Posh and kid-friendly resort that is worth your money,"I have stayed here several times and every single time, it has been a great experience. To begin, the place is kept in pristine conditions, is posh and has great food. What is unique about this place is that it is kid-friendly (and as a parent of a 2-year-old), this is something that is hard to find. I would definitely recommend this hotel to any parent looking to get away and enjoy some quiet time.",5,2019,08,15
238,Excellent all round,"We loved every minute of our stay. It’s such a family friendly hotel, spotless every corner of it. The rooms are super comfortable, staff excellent and very helpful, bar and restaurant top class and leisure centre couldn’t be better. You even get to go from your room to the pool in your robe and there are kiddies robes also... how cute is that",5,2019,08,14
238,Pure Luxury,"Stayed in the amazing Druids Glen Hotel on the 7th and 8th of August 2019. We  had booked through a golf travel company and were amazed what awaited us when we arrived. From the first greetings from the concierge to the warm welcome at reception we immediately felt welcome. As we were playing golf at 2, our room was not ready, but we were told our bags would be left up to our rooms. After playing the amazing Glen course we were collected by the courtesy shuttle and dropped back to the hotel. What a delightful surprise we got when we opened the door to our rooms. One of the most spacious rooms ever, complete with 2 huge beds, chocolates, bottled waters, bath robes, slippers etc... Bar staff and waiting staff were so pleasant and professional. Food was also of the highest quality. My only drawback was it would be nice if there was an ATM in reception, but this is only minor. We loved our stay so much we have already rebooked for the same time next year. Well done to the Druids Glen Resort and especially their wonderful staff...
John Costello.",5,2019,08,13
238,Great hotel,We stayed here for a wedding which was lovely and the food was superb and the staff were friendly and helpful. Our room was spacious and very clean and had everything we needed. We would definitely stay here again if we were to visit in the future,5,2019,08,12
238,3 night Family break,Very enjoyable break overall. Bathrooms need a makeover. They are a bit dated now and fixings need repairing. Price of golf buggies is extremely high at 40 euros per round. Norm in Ireland is 25-30 euros for fully electric buggies. The biggies here are petrol and are noisy and smelly and struggle on most hills.,4,2019,08,12
238,Hugo's really made our stay,"The hotel restaurant is very high standard, the experience was brilliant, and the staff are wonderful ambassadors for the hotel.

Other areas/ departments of the hotel could use a little more attention to detail.",4,2019,08,12
238,Good spot missing Atmosphere,"Attended for a family gathering .Lovely hotel.
Food was lovely but  Pricey ..Toilets spotless .Staff Friendly .No complaints . No real atmosphere to the hotel it's a pity because it's a nice hotel.....",4,2019,08,11
238,What a great Ireland venue!,"Visited Druids Glen resort for my first ever trip to Ireland - our company decided to hold our board meeting at the resort. Impeccable service, wonderful food overall including one evening of dinner at the clubhouse. Meeting went flawlessly. I throughly enjoyed my walk around the walking trail covering the hotel and golf course. Would love to come back with the family next time. Kudos to all the staff for a wonderful job in making my stay enjoyable!",4,2019,08,10
238,Family trip from the wild Atlantic way,"Recently enjoyed our 1st visit to Druids Glen with the kids but just 
a little bit of constructive criticism that I feel can be rectified quite easily to bring your standards back to a five star hotel which I feel it was lacking on our visit there. 
The hall carpets to our the bed rooms had drink spills all over them & could do with a clean.  
The cushions on our beds were torn & again drink stains all over them ( house keeping manager needs to relook at the attention to detail in the rooms)
The tiles around the jacuzzi area on pool side needs cleaning badly
Food in bar was good but took almost 40min to get our main course.  
The family deals & breaks that you offer are great but your hotel is taking the blunt of it & it's beginning to show😬 
Had booked a luxury girls break away in November but ended up cancelling unfortunately based on this experience.",3,2019,08,10
238,Underwhelming,"We stayed with our 3 month old for a family trip as a birthday present for my partner, upgraded to suite! View was fab , bed very comfy but for price paid there were no little extras that made it special. Poor entertainment selection on tv
Shower control came off in my hand and toothpaste marks on the walls.
We reserved a table in hugos- no atmosphere or ambience- stark white , very bright no music . Menu didn't have a great selection, had to pay extra for a portion of veg- paid €4.50 for a tiny baby carrot..... I actually thought they were kidding... talk about notions!!! Food was average and didnt meet standards for what they were charging!! 
Breakfast was in the same room- had to queue to have an egg fried and arrived back to our table to soggy cold toast
Most of our trips away are memorable and great because of the food , were serious foodies.... this was not one of those stays
Overall just felt very disappointed ",2,2019,08,10
238,Family stay,"Lovely hotel. Poor service in restaurants, in particular our  afternoon tea experience. Noisy air conditioning, had to switch off at night and open the full length window. Pool lovely , jacuzzi temperature seemed far too hot. Setting of hotel beautiful, staff very pleasant.",4,2019,08,10
238,Midweek break,Excellent hotel with very professional staff always ready to help. Check in and check out fast and efficient. Rooms very comfortable. Bar area and lobby very nice with a good atmosphere.Used the golf range and took a golf lesson from the pro. which was excellent. Breakfast was very good with a wide variety of food on offer the only minus was some of the food was a little cold and also difficult to serve yourself as the containers did not stay open which meant having to leave down your plate and no space to do that.  Very minor but inconvenient all the same.    Evening meal in Hugos restaurant was very good although desert was a bit disapointing.  However staff couldn't have been nicer. Overall lovely hotel and I would return.,5,2019,08,10
238,Family mini break,Fab hotel can not recommend it enough for family’s with it only a short hop from Dublin and a great base for lots of things to see and do in Wicklow. Very attentive staff throughout the hotel which has indoor and outdoor play area and swimming pool. Powerscourt gardens is only few minutes away and Glendalough 20-30 mins. Brilliant breakfast and lovely food in Garden Room. Can’t fault this hotel and will 100% return this year. ,5,2019,08,08
238,Perfect Family Break,"The ideal place for a family break and we were surprised how child-friendly the hotel and staff were. Lots to do with excellent, friendly service. Pool times are limited for children, 2 hours in the morning and 4 hours in the afternoon which takes a little planning but overall a perfect place for a relaxing and fun break. ",5,2019,08,08
238,Míní moon,excellent hotel and facilities. Beautiful grounds and gold club. Just the place to recharge the batteries after our wedding. We had a fabulous room and loved our welcome gift. I would highly recommend to a friend ,5,2019,08,08
238,Another excellent stay,"Pure perfection from the moment we arrived until the minute we checked out. We had dinner in the bar on both evenings. The food was excellent,looking out at the breath taking scenery. Breakfast was out standing. Nothing was too much trouble. There was so much selection and everything was fresh and really good quality. A trip to the spa is a must. I can't praise the staff enough,everyone we came in contact with were lovely and charming and seemed genuinely happy to be there. Looking forward to our return already ",5,2019,08,07
238,Lovely spot,"Lovely place but one or two small things that lacked attention which led to a little disappointment. Great food, gorgeous location, seemed well catered for children, looked like an amazing golf course. ",4,2019,08,05
238,Not a bad word to say,"I really couldn’t fault this hotel. From the amenities, staff, food and service it is without fault. The reservations team is beyond helpful, I had to change the dates of my reservation and they couldn’t have made it easier. Caroline (I think) checked us in at reception and she was lovely! The menus are so versatile and the quality of food is brilliant. Breakfast is also lovely. 
There is so much to do in and around the hotel it is perfect for couples and families! Can’t wait to return",5,2019,08,05
238,Incredible Hotel with Incredible Staff,"I Visited this hotel for 2 nights in July 2019 to attend a family wedding. From the moment you drive through the hotel gates there is an immense calming surround. The hotel car park is located directly across from the hotels main entrance, but doesn't take away from the beautiful golf course it looks over.

Myself and a friend took advantage of the 12km walking trail around the grounds. The views are spectacular and with its location in the heart of wicklow ""Irelands Garden"" you will most definitely not be dissapointed.

The rooms are incredible, very spacious and we're remarkably clean. At night we when returning to our room the beds were ready with a chocolate which is a lovely touch.

The Breakfast was exactly as you'd expect for a 5 star hotel such as Druids Glen. A full buffet with the added option of Pancakes and Omlettes, as well as a wide selection of cereals, pastrys and juices. Once again you won't be disappointed with views as you can take advantage of the decking area just outside the breakfast hall. 

As we were attending a wedding we had the priveledge of experiencing their function room. A very large room with a bar which is located just behind the hotels reception, and conveniently has a seperate reception area which again is very generous space wise.

The staff are second to none, and don't hesitate to go out of their way to help. From the moment we walked in we were greeted with nothing but smiles and a genuine interest. With a background in the hospitality industry I could only hope for a team like the team at Druids Glen. 

I would like to particularly mention 2 members of their team. 

Steven, the Guest Relations Manager who went above and beyond for us to make our stay as incredible as it was, informing us of the best routes to take on the grounds and always took time to speak to us and ask us about our day. You are truly blessed  to have such a person on your team.

And Krystoff, Who was a server and was behind reception. He stood out Inparticular, the whole family was talking about the hospitality they received from Krystoff. You could tell he genuinley enjoyed his job and was quick to interact whilst serving which we loved and is an All round better experience than the norm. 

My stay here was originally a 2 night stay, but after returning home for about 20 minutes I got back in the car to do the 45 minute drive back and stayed an extra night. That is a true compliment to your team especially Steven and Krystof. 

I would give this hotel a 10 if I could, it simply cannot be faulted. 
If you are thinking of staying here, just do it. You will not be dissapinted.",5,2019,08,01

238,"Great location, staff, facilities, food, golf course..... I could go on.","My wife and I spent two nights here for her birthday. No need for a long winded review it was superb in every respect. Returned to work on Monday morning like a new man. Our room overlooked the 13th tee of the course which provided much entertainment sharing a glass of wine looking out over the balcony. In the evenings you are also truly at one with nature with not a car or engine to be heard and only those  pesky birds and squirrels to worry about. Just do it, worth every penny. ",5,2019,07,29
238,Excellent Family trip,"Cant recommend the Hotel enough, I'd go every week if I could

238,Mixed experience,"Spent 2 nights in Druids Glen this week and it was an ok experience. The hotel reception and bar areas are nice and staff are very friendly. Downfalls were on arrival to our room our 2 year old found a half eaten biscuit under a table despite the room being ""cleaned"". In the main shower the steel plate behind the nozel to turn shower on was off from the wall and the cut tile was exposed. We had no hot water for the two days we were there from the shower. I rang down to have the shower fixed. They fixed the steel plate but not the water temperature. Overall it was a decent stay but i wont be rushing back for the price we paid. Better family friendly hotels around. There is a playroom and playground in the hotel for kids which are good.",3,2019,07,25
238,Best Hotel/Resort we stayed at in Ireland,"We stayed here for 3 days for business meeting. Then toured Ireland. Came back to Druids Glen for 4 more days because it was so nice. Comfy beds, cool A/C, great views if on golf course side, friendly staff, yummy breakfast, nice pool, and challenging golf course. A nit-picky con would be a little better casual dining place. There is a snack bar, but could use a better casual option. But really like our time there.and would go back in a heart beat.",5,2019,07,25
238,Wedding,"Make sure they cover all of your family and friends needs, I was expecting more and was unfortunately disappointed with the level of attention to personal requests; a five star hotel lacking the personal touch",4,2019,07,23

238,Family getaway,"Druids Glen is an excellent hotel. We booked a last minute Groupon with my partner and 2 children. From the moment we arrived we felt so welcomed.  The staff are so friendly.  We also got upgraded as we were celebrating our wedding anniversary, this was a lovely surprise. Our room was stunning. Breakfast is so yummy with lots of choice. The pool is great with set times for families. There's plenty to see and do. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The staff from the front desk, doorman. Bar staff, cleaning staff are all a credit to this hotel. Thank you for all those extra touches that really do make this hotel a 5*.",5,2019,07,20
238,Nice Hotel Pool Dissapointing.,"Stayed here with my fiancé for a one-night stay, hotel itself is beautiful and the golf course is very nice.  There is lovely walks around the hotel and the scenery is lovely.  The room was big, lovely and clean and the staff were friendly and helpful.  However, for a 5 star hotel I was not impressed with the pool at all.  It was very packed and there was a lady giving swimming lessons throughout the day, which resulted in their families and siblings sitting around the pool.  I did not find the pool relaxing at all and was very disappointed for a 5 star luxury hotel.   The pool was  packed with kids and there was no room to swim, and it was not luxurious in any way.  My fiancé joined me at the pool and only stayed 5 mins.  Also the bar food was ok just very average and very overpriced and this was the same for drinks.  So for these reasons I will not be returning to the hotel, or recommending to friends.  When I book a 5 star hotel I want a luxury relaxing break but this was not the case.",3,2019,07,18
238,Druids Glen will cast a spell on you,"Druids Glen is a fabulous family friendly relaxed luxury hotel which is convenient for Dublin and the coast but maintains a relaxed and hideaway ambience. The food is excellent, the staff are friendly and welcoming and the facilities mean that your children can be safely occupied while you get some time to yourself",5,2019,07,18
238,Birthday Present,"We initially stayed in Druids Glen in February of this year- my boyfriend had organised a night away for Valentines and we got engaged. Druids Glen were nothing but accommodating and they went over and above to make the engagement so special- the main reason why we returned here for my birthday celebrations on Saturday 13th July.

We experienced a completely different service and hotel. Firstly, on arrival we went straight to the bar to grab some lunch. About 45 minutes passed when the waitress came apologising that the chef had not seen our docket (for two ham and cheese toasties) and offered us a complimentary drink. This was not a problem with us as we were happy to just chill out and thought the staff handled it well by offering a drink complimentary- however we weren't pleased when these 'complimentary' drinks were on our bill!

Next up, we had went down to the same bar for dinner that evening. On two occasions my fiancee had went out to the reception desk and asked for a cake or something small to mark my birthday (he didn't want to ask bar staff as I might notice). We ordered our desserts and needless to say- no candle or anything to mark my birthday came. In addition, ordering a drink or a garlic dip for our dinner took about 20 minutes to come- no exaggeration! The garlic dip actually came when we had finished our main course... At this stage we decided we couldn't be bothered asking for anything more so we got a taxi to Greystones for a few drinks... with better service.

Finally, when we checked out and arrived home my mother asked me how the overnight stay went (which she had paid for for a birthday present- knowing how sentimental the place was for us). She was shocked as on two occasions she was told we would have a card and chocolates to say happy birthday in the room- again this didn't happen. I rang the front desk on Sunday evening to talk about how our stay went to be told the manager would contact us on Wednesday...

Flash forward to Wednesday, and we get a watery response to our email about how disappointed we were on our stay. Druids Glen 'appreciate' all feedback and offered us a complimentary upgrade and preferential rate should we return.

Disappointed is not the word. This is the first and only time I have ever posted on TripAdvisor as I was really upset over the money that was spent and the service that was received. We are not hard people to please and would have looked past the slow service however it was one thing after another! We had talked about going to Druids Glen next December for 3 nights after our wedding for our mini moon- and we will obviously not be wasting our time or money on this '5 star' resort.",1,2019,07,18
238,All about the Glen.,"Waited a long time to tick this off my bucket list. The Druids Glen golf course was excellent but The Heath just ok. Hotel facilities very good. Prices are quite high across the board but I suppose it was high season. I have heard about lots of good deals but I could not find them. However, I had a great time and would return.",5,2019,07,18
238,Five star hotel and staff,"I recently stayed at the Druids Glen hotel with 3 others whilst on a 3 day golfing break.
The hotel and bedrooms are a very high standard, excellent breakfast and food served by very welcoming staff, from the reception to the hotel cleaners, all are very pleasant and will assist with anything you need. they even have a shuttle bus that takes you to the nearest town in the evening. The Druids Glen golf course is one of the best i have played and in great condition, if there is a down side there was no outside space to enjoy a beer and food after the game. Druids Heath is a great course but cant match Druids Glen but still a good test for any golfer.",5,2019,07,17
238,Family Wedding,Place was amazing.From we arrived until we left we were treated first class.Couldnt fault a thing.Staff were exceptional.Would definitely go back.Food was outstanding and the atmosphere was unreal.Definitely 5 star rating.,5,2019,07,16

Didnt us gym or spa facilities but did check them out & look forward to using ssme on my return",5,2019,07,14
238,Ok but could be better. Expensive,"This is a premium 5 star resort, so it needs to deliver. The fine dining restaurant has a poor and over-priced wine list and main courses were 'average' at best. The Druids Glen golf course is lovely BUT the tee boxes and bunkers were in poor condition",3,2019,07,12
238,Anniversary Celebrations,"Fabulous hotel in a beautiful setting. The Suite we were given had everything we needed and more. Lunch, dinner and breakfast were all delicious. The service in the bar from Irina was excellent. Thank you to Emily and Caroline on Reception and the Manager Eoin for a wonderful stay. We will definitely return and would recommend the hotel for anyone looking for some relaxation in a beautiful setting.",5,2019,07,12
238,Anniversary,Beautiful hotel and great location close to Dublin. Staff are really friendly and helpful.  Would recommend doing to forest walk after the filling breakfast.  Only thing I could fault is the price but perhaps that is because we visited at peak and at weekend.  ,4,2019,07,10
238,Family time,"Had a fabulous time with my daughter and two grandchildren - amazing hotel & food. What a lovely touch to arrive to our family room and get robes for adults....but also gorgeous mini robes and slippers for the children,  Class touch, we all really loved it.  Pool was great, lovely walks and facilities.  Breakfast being super. My grandchildren loved the fantastic pancakes and the cooking demo from the chef. 
Had dinner in Hugos one of the evenings and Loic was so professional,  accommodating and understanding with our two ""busy"" little ones :)
Made us feel so relaxed and at ease while enjoying wonderful food.
Looking forward to seeing you all again in a few weeks:)",5,2019,07,08

Can't wait to return next time.",5,2019,07,08
238,Great Location for Outdoor Fun,"Our family of 4 stayed in this hotel because of it's proximity to several great hiking locations. We were so happy with everything at the hotel. The rooms and the beds were comfortable. The breakfast and the dinners were delicious. They even had gluten free options at all meals. My children (ages 8 and 11) loved the playground, the walking trail, the driving range and the play room.",5,2019,07,08
238,Absolutely stunning. A must stay,"We stayed in the lap of luxury in the Druid’s Glen. We could not fault the room, dinner, breakfast or the staff as everything was absolutely amazing. The staff went above and beyond to make sure that we were satisfied. We really enjoyed our stay and hope to be back again soon.",5,2019,07,07
238,Golfing around Ireland ,"We stayed one night and played the championship course 
Found the course absolutely fantastic , the gardens were amazing and the course was in great shape 
The staff at the resort were very attentive and helpful would highly recommend a visit ",5,2019,07,06
238,Druids Glen resort .Newtown mountkennedy,Very disappointed at the cleaniless of this hotel. We as a family have been to this hotel 6 times or more in the last few years and loved it. We are just home from a 2 night stay and we will not be returning. The location is beautiful but it  just seems a bit ran down compared to previous years.Our room was not very clean and the staff members I  dealt with were not very welcoming either.,3,2019,07,06
238,Family Stay,"Stayed at Druids Glen for 5 nights, excellent hotel & family friendly. A great base to go places. Plenty to do at the hotel & in surrounding areas. Kids loved the playroom, pool, driving range & playground. Breakfast was fantastic. We loved our stay here! It was our second visit but hadn't been in 4 years. A big thumbs up. Super staff too. All so friendly and helpful.",5,2019,07,06
238,Lovely hotel and staff,"I had an excellent 4 day stay here.  The rooms and bathrooms are a great size.  The surroundings are beautiful with many places to walk, or even exercise in the onsite pool and gym.  The staff were super friendly.  Restaurants are a little limited for lunch and dinner but the buffet breakfast was excellent! ",4,2019,07,05
238,Excellent as always,"Perfect from beginning to end. Wonderful hospitality, excellent food. Super friendly staff everywhere. Check-in is quite unique with interested reception staff.  Could not be better. One feels genuinely welcome",5,2019,07,05
238,Midweek break,"Reservation staff were very efficient. Reception staff had a problem with our bill. Initially we were informed that we had to pay separately for the golf which was understandable. When we we went to the clubhouse we were Informed that the hotel had paid. We checked with reception on our return from the golf and we were informed that it was correct. However on check out we were charged for the golf. Cannot understand how this mixup occurred.

238,Heavon,Had a wonderful relaxing stay here kids free with my partner food was lovely along with the view place was clean which is a big thing for me and had lovely bath supplies bed were super comfy looking forward to coming back,5,2019,07,04
238,Large and luxurious,"This hotel is located on acres of beautiful countryside.  The rooms are very comfortable, and the public areas very nice. The breakfast was also extensive and good.  

The hotel has several venues for eating with all having beautiful views of the surrounding areas.  The formal dining room is small, however, and the staff seemed a bit overwhelmed.

The hotel is also a popular venue for weddings, which can result in large, large crowds, which can pretty much take over the bar and some other areas. They are probably mostly on weekends, though, so if your plans are for the week, it shouldn't be a problem.

The staff is very helpful and well trained.",4,2019,07,04
238,Perfect stay.. the most attentive staff!,"Myself and my partner stayed here for one night to celebrate a birthday. From the moment we checked in we had the most perfect hotel experience. We were given a complimentary upgrade which was such a lovely and unexpected treat. Our room was just beautiful and the bed was one of the comfiest I've ever slept in. We had massages in the spa which were amazing.. the staff there were obviously very experienced and knowledgeable as well as professional and so very friendly. 
Dinner was so beautiful and again any wait staff we came in contact with were wonderful. They even picked up on my partners birthday from the form we filled in at reception and made a bit of a fuss at dessert which was such a lovely touch. 
Nothing was a problem for the staff and we had such an enjoyable night away. Thank you! ",5,2019,07,04
238,Wicklow,Excellent hotel. The breakfast was amazing! Fabulous hotel. Great location. Very clean. Rooms were very comfortable and spacious. Can not fault this hotel. Had a brilliant getaway. Will definitely be back.,5,2019,07,03

I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a relaxing stay with good food. ",5,2019,07,03
238,Spa is Awful,"Spa day with a friend and it was awful. We go to a lot of spas and were expecting a lovely day in the Druids Glen Spa. This was our first time attending the spa here despite a couple of (average) overnight stays in the hotel.

Relaxation area was just awful. Only 7 beds and an uncomfortable leather bench to wait  for one on. Decor in the room is poor, it's like a few blackout blinds have just been thrown up in a small conference room. The room is also used as a corrridor/throughway for therapists which made it seem like grand central station with the constant banging of doors and heavy footsteps through.

People are not asked to stay quiet so are chatting, whispering and laughing making it a none too relaxing experience.

The treatments themselves were also a huge letdown. I had, what was supposed to be, a full body massage and a facial. The treatment room was noisy (it was by the reception desk). The oils did not smell nice, it was as though the massage was done using just a carrier oil with zero scent. The therapist massaged my back and back of legs. She then turned me over and began the facial. At no point did she massage the front of my body?? (My friend had the same bizarre issue). Fronts of our legs, arms, feet or our hands were not massaged at all?!

Facial was very salon like and not a spa standard facial. Therapist even turned on the bright light before starting the facial after the massage!? 

Lunch was included in the package and was terrible also. For a spa in a 5 Star hotel to not have it's own lunch area is crazy! We had to fully dress and follow the receptionist through a maze of corridors to end up in a room full of screaming and running around children to get lunch from a bar menu.

Awful awful awful experience! Avoid!!!",2,2019,07,03
238,Great break,Stayed for a 3 night break. From the moment we checked in to the departure day all staff were helpful friendly and knowledgeable. Food in the restaurant was good and the ambience totally relaxing. Well done all.,5,2019,07,02
238,As a Local always have had a nice experience in this Hotel,"Nice friendly staff, food is good and facilities too. Nice for small children with playground and fairy trail. I really like the foyer with lots of private meeting places and hide away nooks!Swimming pool nice temperature.  ",4,2019,07,02
238,A lovely stay - 10/10,We had a really lovely time in Druids Glen. We arrived to check in a little early and our room was put on priority for us to get ready. The lad checking us in was fantastic and we even got a complimentary upgrade. I'd recommend the hotel for couples 100%. A real 5 star night away.,5,2019,07,02
238,Must stay hotel,Absolutely beautiful 5 star Hotel. My partner and I stayed here two nights in a family room as we were attending a friend's wedding. Couldn't fault a thing. Very beautiful setting and so comfortable and we truely enjoyed our stay. ,5,2019,07,01
238,Good golfing hotel with extensive grounds and fine views,"We were staying at Druids Glen for a leadership development event with 70 participants from around the world.  The hotel is located to the South of Dublin, and the airport is to the North, so without traffic it's a 45 minute drive away.  With traffic, allow twice that time.  The benefit is that the surrounding countryside is beautiful and the opportunity to stroll through the extensive grounds is a nice plus.
Given the number of participants, we took over the restaurant at breakfast and lunch, but this was not problematic.  The food was universally of a high quality and service was friendly.  Coffee was always strong, which is a big plus point for me!  Too many hotel restaurants serve weak coffee!
The hotel rooms are spacious, and well-furnished in a modern neutral style.  Most have French balconies so being able to open the windows is also a real plus.  The bathroom is equally spacious, with both bath and shower.  The only gripe about the shower was that it flowed warm/tepid.  
I used the swimming pool 5 times - they require you to wear a cap, which is sold at the pool - and it was always possible to swim laps even when others were in the pool as they rope off a section. The temperature is great and the pool is a decent size.
The conference room was in the basement without windows, which was far from ideal for 3 days of meetings; that said, the temperature was good (not too warm or I would have fallen asleep!) and the tech worked well.
I didn't get the chance to play golf, which was frustrating as the course we overlooked from the restaurant looked lovely (if challenging!).  There were a few golfers knocking around, easily identified by their shockingly dated attire, but the course seemed pretty quiet (unsurprising given that we were there from Tuesday to Thursday).
The hotel caters to its target market, does it well and there is nothing that I would fault beyond the niggles above.",4,2019,06,28
238,Lovely family break,Booked a family room with my 32 weeks pregnant wife and 2 year old daughter. Beautiful hotel in a lovely location. Spacious room with 2 large beds. Plenty of activities for the 2 year old. Outside play area. Indoor play room. Lovely pool where the air temperature was kept lovely and warm so it felt like a sun holiday! Will definitely return for a longer stay.,5,2019,06,24
238,Top Class,"This place is amazing from the food to the service nothing was to much,stunning breakfast,1st class clean rooms and to top it all the best golf course I have played. I played the K club the day before and it wasn't a patch on this place . You will not be disappointed",5,2019,06,23
238,Another Great Visit to Druids Glen,"A great complex something for everyone.  Excellent staff with top calss service.
A real pleasure to return on an annual basis. From the moment you arrive and are met by the Concierge you feel the welcome of Druyids Glen.  Excellent bedrooms, good size and very comfortable.
Hugo's Restaurant is great for both breakfast and dinner with a great variety of food on offer.
THe Garden Room provides a more informal dining arrangement and can be recommended.
All the facilities are great with two excellent 18 hole golf courses and the swimming pool and Spa are recommended.",5,2019,06,22
238,Not a great 5 star experience,"I have stayed in most five star hotels in Ireland and this hotel is in the bottom quarter in terms of facilities.  The room cost 230 single occupancy for one night (b and b) Check in was slow, staff were lovely, room was sparse, (I had a family room), no mini bar, hairdryer wired into the wall in the wardrobe, and the wires were exposed, hairdryer didn't work - then randomly turned on at various intervals!  Bathroom had a standard domestic shower, and standard domestic bath - pretty unimpressive - limited toiletries. The spa, is not a spa - it is a series of treatment rooms with a busy relaxation room with a lot of traffic in and out. The treatment rooms were basic. The pool area (not attached to the spa) is like a public facility, not at all luxurious, very basic. Lovely walks - food was good, service was good. Overall, a good four star - but definitely not a luxury five star resort.",3,2019,06,21
238,Afternoon tea,"Great food. Service was extremely slow, which is hard to understand as there were few guests. We didn’t drink tea or coffee, instead we had only one glass of water each. It would have been nice if we’d been offered another drink. In the past, this wasn’t an issue. Disappointed.",2,2019,06,18
238,Super stay,"Fantastic stay at the Druids Glen celebrating Father’s Day. The rooms were immaculate and the beds were just perfect for sleeping. Staff were just lovely, always with a welcoming smile. Also a great location. ",5,2019,06,18

238,Very memorable visit,"Excellent hotel, very friendly staff in a relaxed atmosphere. Lovely surroundings and decor in a location that is sufficiently outside of Dublin to 'get away from it all' but close enough that it is a short hop down.  Overall, very memorable stay",4,2019,06,17
238,Best Hotel EVER,"Me and my partner stayed here for our anniversary and honestly can say we have never had a better stay in any hotel in Ireland. The staff were so warm and welcoming. They even upgraded our rooms which was so kind. The room was immaculate with a gorgeous view of the grounds. We had dinner in the hotel and everything was so tasty and again the staff were extremely friendly which made everything even nicer. 
The beds are also very comfy. The breakfast was tasty and very fresh.

Our stay far exceeds our expectations. Staff were so attentive and friendly - we visited the swimming pool after arrival, had a few drinks in the bar prior to our dinner which was superb - delicious from start to finish. 
We were spoilt for choice at breakfast next morning and again were served by friendly and attentive staff always willing to please. Our visit to the spa for massages after breakfast was wonderful and relaxing. 
We will be back - thank you so much 😊",5,2019,06,16

Stayed here about a month ago celebrating my friends 21st birthday and we were treated amazingly, we were even upgraded to a suite to top it all off. 
I can’t remember the staff names now but a special shout-out to the receptionist on duty, the French waiter and the bar staff that all made us very welcome while being professional at the same time! 
We will be back! 
Thank you. ",5,2019,06,14

238,Great family friendly hotel,"Stayed with my 2kids at the end of May.

Pool was great kids loved it. Little bit cold on the first day but not bad the second. Very clean and friendly staff.

Ate lunch and dinner in the hotel bar. Food was ok but as some others have said maybe a bit overpriced for what it was.

Room on the 3rd floor. Big high ceilings and v spacious family room. Furthest room from the lifts possible so a bit of a trek...however, quietist room i have ever stayed in in a hotel!! No passing traffic, no door slamming, great nights sleep. Air con was just brilliant. I love a hot room but often find hotels can be very stuffy and hot at night. Hard to sleep in. The air con here really works. Choose your temp and the room very quickly heats or cools. Was so impressed by it! 
 
Very child friendly hotel. Great park, playroom and baby room.

Friendly staff especially the lady hostess at breakfast and the door man. Breakfast as mentioned in other reviews is great. Big selection pleased us all including too very fussy kids.

Will definitely be back in the future!",4,2019,06,13

238,Excellent stay yet again in Druids Glen Hotel,"I had the pleasure of staying two nights in Druids Glen with my son. Everything about the stay was excellent, from the first welcome, to the beautiful room, lovely walks and great food. We ate both evenings in the Garden Rooms with plenty of choice for casual dining. The breakfast experience is the best I have come across. But what really makes this hotel stand out is the staff. From the moment we arrived until we checked out nothing was too much trouble and we were always greeted with a smile. I would highly recommend this Hotel.",5,2019,06,11
238,Wonderfully relaxing stay in the gorgeous Druid Glen Hotel.,"We have stayed in Druids Glen multiple times now for the reason of the quality of hotel, the facilities, rooms and also the amazing staff.  Every time we return it exceeds our expectations.  We cant thank all the staff enough for making our trips there so enjoyable.

238,A beautiful hotel in a beautiful location.,We loved our stay in Druids Glen. When we arrived we were greeted by friendly staff and a warm towel. And we got a great surprise when we were upgraded to an Executive Suite! Druids Glen is a luxury we normally wouldn't be able to afford. But for our 10 year wedding anniversary we splashed out. The upgrade was the cherry on the cake. We hadn't even mentioned the occasion. ,5,2019,06,11
238,overnight stay,Really lovely hotel with helpful and friendly staff. Rooms very nice. Fabulous spa experience. We enjoyed walk in the grounds. Garden restaurant renovation really lovely overlooking beautiful surrounds.,4,2019,06,10
238,Stunning hotel,"After booking a night's stay for my Fiancé's birthday to druids geln, we arrived to be greated by warm hand towels. (lovley little touch). 
The staff non only at reception but throughout the entire hotel are so kind and friendly, they go out of their way to say hello and always smiling and making you feel so welcome. 
We had lunch in the bar which was incredible. We have been to this hotel so many times and knew it never fails. 
We went to the spa then to relax and unwind before retuning to our upgraded room of a suite. This was upgraded as we were celebrating my fiancé's birthday. 
The druids Glen team have once again kept all the faith we have had in them and reassured us that booking our wedding here was the right thing and we know they will certainly not fail to deliver. They are truly an incredible hotel and I genuinely couldn't recommend them enough. 
We are getting married in 2 years here and look forward to many more nights stay here at druids Glen.",5,2019,06,10

238,First class service with amazing value!!,"This hotel was first class in all ways - staff, room, food. There were a few little touches that just make a lasting impression e.g. no charge for bottled water in the restaurant, free bottle of water given at reception upon check out. All staff throughout the hotel were so professional, helpful & friendly. Room was very clean & very spacious for three friends sharing! Great experience & would highly recommend a stay here.

Dinner in restaurant was marginal! Server great,food mediocre! 
Bar food super! Great rooms!",5,2019,06,08
238,Reception staff need further training,"My large party and I had a wonderful dinner in the restaurant on Monday 3rd June, the staff were excellent, efficient and friendly. On Tuesday 4th June at around 4.30 pm I obviously encountered Reception having a bad day!! Particularly the mature female receptionist my husband and I dealt with, uninterested in helping, brusque to the point of rude, after half an hour our request was dealt with but only after enlisting the help of another receptionist. Off putting...reception is the first point of contact and has to be good. No matter how fab the furnishings are in a hotel, staff are key, we wouldn't stay there again.",3,2019,06,07

238,Excellent over night stay,"Throughly enjoyed my stay, I never got to get to the pool or gym however I definitely recommend the walk to Woodstock,  a pint and avail of the complimentary bus back to the hotel. 
Eating in the evening in the bar was a great experience with excellent food.",5,2019,06,05
238,Amazing hotel,We had a fantastic stay. We had a groupon voucher but were treated like we paid full price (this might sound strange  because why wouldn't you  e treated the same. However  this was not the case with other vouchers we've used in different hotels) Every staff member was so welcoming had a huge smile and said hello. Breakfast was beautiful with so many choices. The room was very big with high ceilings. Bathroom was huge and so nice. The only thing is you need a car as the hotel is very secluded (which is great) Can't wait to go back,5,2019,06,05
238,Very dissapointing,"Not quite a Five Star experience for us. We checked in at about 2pm and all was fine with the front desk and very polite lad that escorted us to our room. The room was spacious and clean and was fine.We like to take the odd break for one to two nights and this was our first visit to Druids Glen.
As usual, we decided to kick of our break with a couple of afteroon cocktails. After 10 minutes in the Garden Room, our order was eventually take. 15 minutes late (and having asked where our order was) we evenually got served. We decided to have another round, the same as the first but there was no consistancy. Quick visit to pool and sauna was abandoned due to the screaming kids who were having a great time.
The most disappointing element was dinner. The waiter adised my wife to have her dish served medium rare but it was well done and chewy. My cod was also over done and very dry. Thankfully the mashed potatoe was a treat.
Hotel was very busyand the staff were courteous and in the main attentive.",3,2019,06,04
238,Romantic treat in Druids Glen,"Myself an my wife booked a night in Druids Glen as a treat for our wedding anniversary. It was a fantastic decision! The hotel is situated in a wonderful location, with plenty of walks etc. The leisure facilities were great and the hotel facilities in general were top notch. We ate in the Garden Bar and the food was of a high standard. The atmosphere in the hotel was very welcoming and homely. Once we mentioned that we were celebrating our anniversary there were many thoughtful touches throughout our stay, which was greatly appreciated. Above all else though- the staff we encountered during our stay were, to a person, extremely attentive and friendly. They made the hotel feel like a home, which is a rare and difficult thing to accomplish. Well done!",5,2019,06,04
238,Great Trip,"Great trip to  Druids Glen Hotel & Golf Resort 
Great experience.
The staff couldn't have done more for us.

10/10 for me

238,"Not a 5 star, barely a 3!","Overall experience of this hotel .. poor ! On arrival check in for hotel was fine and we had no issues. We then had booked afternoon tea which was probably one of the worse afternoon teas we had ever had. While trying to enjoy afternoon tea there was a staff member reorganizing tables all around us. For €82 it was not worthy. 
We then decided we would go for a swim in the health Centre, facilities and pool were good, one member of staff really impressed us when he noticed my partner was deaf, he helped out with his locker and also tried to get a few tips for sign language. This was probably are one and only good experience with staff. 
That evening we had decided we would have food and drinks at the bar which turned out to be an awful experience. Mojito was one of the worse I had ever tasted and staff had no training regards to pulling pints of Guinness. The Guinness was undrinkable. We decided to let it slip and change our drinks after that. Second issue was I had asked a member of staff was it possible to change the tv channel, from golf to football, the answer given to me : ‘the football will come on when it comes on’ . About 20 minutes after that another customer had walked into the bar and had asked the same question regarding the changing of channels, the same staff member obliged and was happy enough to make that change. This totally confused me !! I had then asked the same staff member why he had given permission to another customer yet not me and had also then told him my disappointment regarding the drinks service. His reply .. ‘nothing ... a shrug of his shoulders’. At this rate I’m apauled at the treatment we are receiving but continue to try and enjoy the night. We ordered food, seafood chowder. When staff came to collect to plate of food I was never asked why I had not ate the food, it was terrible ! After this we decided to leave the bar and try and enjoy the rest of our night in the room. 
Later on that night we needed to order in room dining because we were still hungry after not eating at the bar. My partner(who is hard of hearing) went down to reception to order food. He explained that he was unable to make in room dining call from the room because he was deaf. Staff members at that time seemed to be understanding yet no longer then 5 minutes later the room phone called after my partner explains to staff members that he could not make a phone call. There was no awareness to his deafness and this was so frustrating.

238,Great Family Hotel,"Had a lovely weekend in Druids Glen. Rooms, clean and comfortable. Staff, very pleasant and friendly. Breakfast and bar food very tasty and the atmosphere very relaxing.
Loads for kids to do with games room, playground, pool and driving range. And as everyone knows, once kids are entertained, parents can relax. Lovely little touched too like kids robes and slippers in the room and kids toiletries in the bathroom.
We had one small issue tho - the heat. It was so so so hot everywhere. In the lounge, at breakfast and even the lobby, it was so warm! Uncomfortably hot. In particular the pool. The water was just too warm. Both our kids are well used to swimming pools having been in lessons for 6+ years. Both had to leave the pool due to the heat and also complained of headaches after. As soon as we got back to the room and opened the balcony door for some fresh air, they were as tight as rain again. In all our travels, they have never looked to leave a pool - indeed most of the time they have to be bribed out! But they just couldn’t stick the uncomfortable heat.
All in all, I’d definitely return. Just maybe turn down the dial in the central heating a couple of degrees.",4,2019,06,03
238,Lovely hotel,"We had a nice stay at druids Glen we got the stay as a gift and it was very relaxing while the staff where very friendly and could not do enough for us I felt at times it was a little bit over the top why? Well mainly in the afternoon a lady knocked on our door and asked did we want our beds turned down now while to some people this may be the in thing it's not for me, quite old fashioned otherwise the stay was relaxing on check out however wasn't as nice I was asked by the reception for more documentation and I did have the receipt but he wanted me to contact the person who bought it which I wasn't going to do as I had proof of purchase so be careful if you have any vouchers people make sure you have everything ready, anyway besides that it was a nice stay",3,2019,06,03
238,Great family getaway,"This resort has something for all the family. A leisure center that is beautifully warm both in and out of the water which is so rare in Ireland. Steam room and sauna and a jacuzzi. A world class golf course. A great Spa. 
Walks and a good play room and best of all great food in a very relaxing atmosphere. The staff are so helpful. We will be back. A wonderful experience. ",5,2019,06,03

238,"Very comfortable, very friendly staff, a bit too “American style”","A large hotel, in the middle of a golf, with a good  spa and a warm indoor swimming pool. They also have a play room full of games and toys for children.
The staff is very friendly.
Rooms are good and clean, although some of the bathroom equipment was ageing.
The overall facility was built like those you can find in the US in similar locations, comfortable but a bit too standard compared to what you expect in Ireland.",4,2019,06,03
238,Superb !! ,"This hotel is absolutely top notch. Everything from hotel room, grounds, service, comfort is really superb! Oh and he beds are so comfortable :) There’s nothing I could fault at all.

238,Magnificent hotel - top class service,"We had a first holy communion celebration lunch last weekend at this hotel in one of their function rooms and we had an overnight stay for myself, husband and two children.

The support and service leading up to the day were fantastic which was an indication of what was to come. From checkin to check out we were treated to one of the best experiences we have had with any hotel, at home or abroad.

Despite the fact that the hotel was extremely busy on the day and there were some issues with orders being mixed up for lunch and resulting delays, the way with which the staff addressed those issues and apologised for any service that was not in line with their expectations - I am saying ‘their’ specifically because there was a standard they expected of themselves and if they didn’t meet it they called it out, apologised and duely addressed it - that was the refreshing part.

Beyond the few delays with lunch, everything went smoothly, the room and food were fabulous, as well as all of the surroundings but the extra touches like cookies and milk in the room for the kids after a long day, a communion card for my daughter and many other little things made the whole weekend magical.

The breakfast was amazing and so fresh. Omelettes and pancakes made to order by a really young chef who was so in control of his station despite it being busy was really impressive. He told myself and my husband to sit down and he would bring the omelettes over. They were warm, fresh and delicious.

Whatever training the staff in this hotel get and whatever management is there leading this amazing team, it’s evident that you offer something really special, from the porter, to reception, bar, restaurant, waiters, waitresses, young and old, you made us all feel really special and although the hotel is magnificent and offers everything a fabulous 4 star hotel would, your service and how you made us feel is what we will remember and will definitely bring us back.",5,2019,06,01
238,Look after your customers & the rest takes care of itself.,"The room was a superior suite with a view over the grounds, Nespresso Machine and facilities in the room, we were also provided with a personalised note from the manager and a box of chocolates as a welcoming gift, hand delivered by a member of staff. 
Nora our waitress was chatty but not intrusive, well trained and courteous while still being able to carry over her own personality.
During dinner we noticed a young family struggling to calm their child, one of the staff passing was very quick and expertly skilled in the art by cracking jokes with the child and instantly calming the situation. 
The following morning, one of the breakfast staff made a huge deal over a young child being very grown up in eating their Rice Crispies. Kindness and warmth goes a very, very long way. 

On the second night we had a very minor blip with dinner, something picked up from my facial expression with not only the senior waitress but the bar manager Kevin stepping in to remedy. 

I have worked in hospitality, from bars to 5 star hotels over the years. This degree of personality, natural aptitude for people and service very rarely go together. 

On leaving the hotel we were thanked and given bottles of water for our trip in the car. 

Most interactions we have with service and hospitality staff of late lack eye contact, or genuine human personality. It can often be clinical. 

Druids Glen does not do clinical. 

Druids Glen, Kevin and Nora. Thank you. We will see you again very soon. 

John",5,2019,05,29

238,Fantastic relaxing break,"Stayed for two nights with my partner. From the moment we walked in to the moment we left everything was amazing - the staff are a credit to the hotel and made our stay extra special. 

Our room was spacious and comfortable. The pool was lovely (nice and relaxing after the kids leave at 6). We ate in the bar both nights and enjoyed lovely food and cocktails. I had a pedicure in the spa which was great - really good experience. Enjoyed a nice walk to the golf clubhouse and a drink there before heading back to the hotel for dinner (you can get a courtesy bus also if you don't feel like walking) . 

Breakfast definitely deserves a mention with lots of choice including a pancake and omelette station, smoothies etc - a definite plus for veggies (like me) as it had much more than the usual hotel fare on offer. Also served until 11am which was great. 

5 stars all the way and looking forward to a return visit!",5,2019,05,27

When booking I had mentioned it was my husband's birthday and when we arrived to check in we were greeted with a complimentary upgrade to a suite. The suite was stunning as is the rest of the hotel. This is our third stay. All staff are so very friendly and welcoming. Food delicious in restaurant and bar. Only 50 minutes from home and the 24 hour stay was so enjoyable and relaxing. Looking forward to going back and would highly recommend Druids Hken. 5 star for sure.,5,2019,05,24
238,Fantastic stay,"Incredible service from arrival to departure. The spa is so relaxing and all staff are so professional and attentive. I loved my reflexology and the sorbet and selection of herbal teas and flavoured water is a lovely addition. The food is amazing from the garden room dinner to the breakfast where you can get omelettes or pancakes made to your liking.  Mark in the garden room went above and beyond the call of duty with his cocktails.  Even a bottle of water to take you on your journey home.
Highly recommend everything about this hotel.",5,2019,05,21
238,What Luxury,Most luxurious place we stayed in Ireland.  Can't rave enough about our experience here. The hotel staff was friendly and very accommodating. I was not used to such service.  The breakfast buffet was extraordinary.  Our room was large and very comfortable.  Great nights sleep!  We walked around the golf courses in the morning.  What a beautiful place and manicured grounds.,5,2019,05,16
238,Fantastic staff,Reception staff very efficient and friendly. Rooms very comfortable and very comfy beds. Bathroom toiletries are of good quality.. Breakfast selection was good and staff were very helpful. Pawel was very friendly and made us very welcome. We also ate in the golf club and the food and service was excellent on the roof top. we had lovely views of the sea and the house was fabb. I would like to thank Teague for driving us over and back to the golf club. It was a pleasure and he made it most enjoyable. My only issue that i was disappointed with my food at the garden room but Mattie rectified the problem in minutes and was most helpful. All the staff were very attentive and i will definitely be back.,5,2019,05,16

The staff even helped us by driving to greystones to go to the bank.,5,2019,05,14
238,Fantastic from start to finish,"Just spent a lovely 24 hours in Druids Glen for our daughters communion. The service was exceptional. They were so good with the kids. Food, cleanliness, comfort all top notch. Breakfast - all I can say is we couldn't fit any more in but we did try - the spread and variety of food including local supply was really excellent. My only complaint - having to leave! Great for kids - beautiful pool, playroom, playground, walk around grounds incl. fairy woods, dvds and board games, great kids menu.
We will be back - thank you!",5,2019,05,13

My regular 6 week visit there is something I always look forward to",5,2019,05,10
238,"A true Gem in the ""Garden of Ireland""","I recently stayed in the Druids Glen with my family. This was my first time staying there and we all truly enjoyed the experience. The staff were outrageously efficient, polite and helpful and friendly. We dined in the Hugo's restaurant which was an absolute dining delight. Pick any item on the menu as we 4 all selected something different and each course and selection was simply Delicious. They have an extensive wine menu and our choice of a red and a white suited all pallets. The Leisure facilities that we used were excellent and particularly clean. After a very good night's sleep we took to the golf course. I had played it once before. You can see why this course hosted the Irish open in previous years. Signature holes offering a very nice challenge. Greens were in very good condition even though it had been raining the two previous days. I strongly recommend that you bring a distance measure gadget with you as the distance to the green can look deceptive and thus in order to fully appreciate the course you are at least hitting the right club for the distance. So to wrap up if you want to treat yourself and loved ones this offers every comfort and facility to ensure that you truly enjoy your time. We played the main championship course.",5,2019,05,09
238,Lived up to reputation ,"Druids Glen was absolutely 5* in every possible way. Staff, food, surroundings, golf and everything else was just simply flawless. 

Let’s face it, Druids isn’t cheap but good God it’s worth every penny! ",5,2019,05,08
238,Day trip,"I came to the hotel specifically to use the Spa, so I didn’t stay overnight and can’t comment on the bedrooms. I did have breakfast and the lovely staff are so friendly and accommodating in the restaurant - especially Barbara. There was a great selection of hot and cold food and complimentary newspapers.

The Spa is lovely, although the lay out is a little strange, but the building is old and the space is used as well as possible. My masseuse Tom was fantastic. The pool area was nice too and the steam room is excellent.

Will definitely return with my other half for a sneaky night away soon. The location is so beautiful and peaceful and would love to do the walking trail.  ",5,2019,05,04
238,Na,"Excellent service and over the top beautiful place. Staff was very helpful. Gentlemen walked through the rain to our car to get our luggage and delivered to our room, then repaired the car in reserved parking. Walking trail is wonderful. We lived our time there.",5,2019,05,02
238,Wonderful Stay,"We had a really enjoyable two night stay with our 15 month old son. The hotel itself is so spacious and so are the rooms, loads of crawling space. I will second the comfy beds as well. Due to the weather we didn’t get to explore the grounds but the setting is lovely.

The staff were brilliant, I don’t think there was one person who didn’t give our little boy at least a smile, he loved all the attention. I want to make special mention to the staff in the main restaurant for both dinner and breakfast who were so accommodating and wonderful in general.

The food is lovely as well and the breakfast provides loads of choice, the smoothies deserve a mention. My only small complaint were the prices charged in the bar for food were on there high side (definitely 5 star level), especially for the kids meals.

The pool area is (including the changing area) lovely as well, very bright and lovely and warm for the little ones.

Overall a wonderful stay and again one for a repeat visit in the future!",5,2019,04,30

As it was my birthday present from finance she emailed hotel and they gave some nice treats . Dinner was increadable, and service 10/10 . We did walk on grounds that took about 1 hour 30 min before dinner . Next day we before breakfast we had full use of spa area , breakfast was just as nice as dinner lots of choice and again great service . You can see this hotel realy cares and delivers on service .we well differently be back asap . It's simply a must stay !!!",5,2019,04,30
238,Wonderful ,Really enjoyed our last night in Ireland at The Druids Glen.  Very large room with a super comfortable bed. Staff was very helpful and accommodating.   It’s a little far from any pubs or restaurants but a very peaceful location ,5,2019,04,30
238,such a happy stay,"On arriving at the hotel the welcome from Kathy we received was just what I needed due to a SLIGHT accident I had just had with a car door ""ouch"" we were informed that we had been up graded -- that was such a kind gesture so as a returned guest  our stay was starting well --a hotel can have all the bells & whistles but for my husband &myself its the staff that make our stay that extra special Irina looked after us in the evening she was charming & the young man who I had seen the year before when we stayed at the hotel in the breakfast dining area had a great sense of humour because in the morning I found the HONEY COMB which I LOVE NO POTS & I remarked that I was like Winnie the phooh bear & the honey jar but this is better",5,2019,04,29
238,Family friendly,"Stayed here over Easter break, lots on for children, my son was very happy indeed in the Kids High Tea club and couldn't wait to return. Pool beautifully warm and spacious. Weather poor, so we couldn't enjoy outside seating areas or resort walks. Breakfast high standard. Have not rated 5* simply because we were both disappointed with our dinner at Hugo's. Too much (very filling) food on the plates, could not finish either starter or main course and in my opinion food needs more refining to match the quality suggested by excellent service, ambience etc. Very happy with Garden rooms, would choose this over Hugo's.
We would love to return",4,2019,04,28
238,Not a 5 star,"The staff here were outstanding, every single person was better than the last.  It is very comfortable with a lovely view.  Sadly a few things let it down.  The food was hit and miss.  The chowder at lunchtime was hot cream with fish in it but the buttermilk chicken sandwich was outstanding.  At dinner the cauliflower wings were devine but the prawns were tasteless, sadly the chicken pie was a disgrace, described as chicken pie with a wild mushroom sauce with creamed sweetcorn.  It arrived as dried stringy chicken with spicy   sweetcorn.  Everything else was lovely.  The staff have to be commended for the excellent way they handled the disappointment though.  The thing that disappointed me most  was that the two beds in the superior room were so small.  It's hard to go from a large bed at home to a very small bed in a hotel of this calibre.  To be fair I passed a room that definitely had a larger double bed.  And the member of our  party who had the small double to herself said it was extremely comfortable",4,2019,04,28
238,Fabulous stay over Easter holidays,We stayed in druids Glen over the Easter holidays and what a wonderful experience we had. The weather was dreadful but it didn't matter as there is so much to do in the resort itself. The kids had a ball in the playroom and the kids club giving us the opportunity to enjoy the bar and restaurant. The staff are all so friendly. Definite 5 star service without all the pomp and ceremony. We both used the spa facilities to top off our relaxing experience. We can't wait to come back.,5,2019,04,27
238,Family Favourite!,"Just back from relaxing Easter Break here. Lobby and bar areas have had nice refurb/extension since last stay. Food excellent as always, particularly liked Happy Pear additions. But it is the service that makes this place, although we did have to ask for our room to be cleaned (no big deal). Enjoyed room upgrade and surprise at dinner for my wife's birthday, much appreciated! Looking forward to going back already!",5,2019,04,26
238,Druid’s Glen is a resort I washed I had more time to spend at.,"We stayed at DG on our final night of a 10 day trip to Ireland.  I really loved the accommodations, meals, and ambiance of the DG.  I wished we had time to play a round or two of golf and spend time at the pool.  We were able to sightsee in Wicklow after checking in in the afternoon, and DG is a good location to explore sights and history south of London, and in the Wicklow mountains.

I will plan to stay here again on a future trip to Ireland.",5,2019,04,25
238,Beautiful Place,To bad our plans only allowed us to stay here one night. This was an awesome hotel. So much to do. The rooms were very comfortable and the staff was amazing. When back in Ireland we will have this as our starting point to head north in that all our travels this time took us south.,5,2019,04,21
238,There must be an excellent manager here,"Recently called into Druids Hotel for a casual snack in the bar  with my family. The new bar extension was very well presented, comfortable and bright, looking out on the signature hole of Druids Glen Golf course .  Food, including vegan options, were of the highest order.
   The staff were very welcoming and informative on food options.When they heard that one of my family members had a very special 102nd  birthday, Rebecca,our waitress,  went out of her way to make the visit special for the birthday girl,even organizing ,without prompt a small birthday cake with candle  and the full bar staff, including the food manager, to join in a chorus of ""Happy Birthday"" . It remains a very special memory for us all. 
   In reflection  the management and staff of the hotel must be congratulated,  creating such a terrific atmosphere in the hotel with quality service and  promoting individual initiative  . Thank you again.",5,2019,04,15
238,We cannot wait to return!,"My friend and I went for a Spa Day to Druid's Glen Resort on a Groupon voucher. It was our first visit and we were really impressed with the spectacular views. We were given comfy dressing gowns plus slippers and shown around the facilities. Before our treatments we swam in the pool, relaxed in the Jacuzzi, Sauna and Steam Room. In the changing room there is a spin dryer for wet swimsuits. Everywhere was spotless and checked regularly. 

We both chose deep body massage. Our therapists were fabulous. We then moved to the relaxation room. We reluctantly left and had a tasty lunch in the Golf Club restaurant. 

All the staff in Druids were friendly, helpful and smiling.  We cannot wait to return!",5,2019,04,13
238,Best hotel,We stayed at Druids Glenn first weekend in April in their beautiful suites. It was the nicest hotel I have stayed in and the attention to detail went above and beyond my expectations. The food both at breakfast and the evening meals was outstanding. I cannot recommend this hotel enough for special occasions and will definitely return. Fantastic.,5,2019,04,11
238,A little piece of heaven ,"I have been to the Druids Glenn lots of times it is one of my favourite hotels. I go there for afternoon tea ,coffee with friends ,or a drink in the bar .my daughter gave me a voucher for the spa for Christmas today I went what an amazing experience .Georgia was fabulous I had the coconut wrap 10 out of 10 Cannot wait to go back I definitely know what I want for my next birthday and next Christmas present. thank you so much for a fabulous relaxing experience.",5,2019,04,10
238,Gorgeous,"This is perhaps one of the finest hotels I have ever stayed and the staff was incredible.  Our only disappointment was that we were not there long enough and we couldn't get into the golf shop.  The grounds, just everything was beautiful.  I already want to go back.  The bed was so comfortable, slept like a baby and I rarely do....",5,2019,04,07
238,Amazing!,"We had an amazing two night stay in this fabulous hotel. We loved everything about it. The staff were so professional and friendly too!
We visited as a party of 5. The two children in our group were delighted with all the extra special touches such as their welcome pack, their mini robes and the games room. 
The breakfast was exceptional. 
We didn’t dine in the restaurant but enjoyed the food in bar.
Would definitely recommend this hotel! ",5,2019,04,07
238,Amazing two night stay!,"My partner and I booked a two night stay for his parents as a Christmas present, they booked to stay for the start of March which also happened to be their 25th wedding anniversary, because it was their wedding anniversary the hotel upgraded their room and gave them a suite for both night's they were there along with a bottle of champagne which was very kind of them, my partner's parent's asked me to write a review on their behalf as they told me that it was one of the best hotel's they had ever stayed in! They said the staff were amazing! Very friendly, helpful and nothing was too much for them, they stated that the service they received was ""top class"" and because of that alone they will definitely be booking again. They told us the food was beautiful and suite was very clean, they even went out for a round of golf on their last day and told us that the views were breath taking. They could not recommend this hotel enough and so because of this me and my partner will soon be booking a trip for ourselves. Thank you very much to all the staff at Druids Glen for making their trip what it was.. amazing!",5,2019,04,04
238,Ms Flynn,"First time in druids spa. Cannot reccomend them enough. Staff were very attentive and friendly and the massage was by far the best I’ve ever had. Big shout out to Devor and Paula for making us feel super relaxed. I will Definitely be back . 
Thanks guys 🌺",5,2019,04,02
238,Spacious rooms with lovely staff,"We stayed here recently for 2 nights

Pros:
- The rooms are spacious with nice design
- Large, lovely bed
- We were celebrating an occasion and having mentioned this at booking time, they had left a congratulatory note with chocolates which was such a lovely touch, really going the extra mile for customers.
- The afternoon tea is delightful, big fan of the scones
- We got facials, they were really good and the masseuses were friendly
- The breakfast room is fab and our room service dinner was so nice. I recommend the wings, ordered them as a main both nights!

Cons:
- The relaxation room after the treatment is fine but nothing to write home about
- After the treatments if you want to use other facilities you are required to move down stairs to the pool area. In my head I was imagining a separate spa 'Thermal suite' vibes but this may have been my own fault for not researching enough. The pool however does have a lovely big window for the sun to shine through.",4,2019,04,01
238,Amazing 2 night stay,"Booked a two night stay for my Mother and I and the hotel exceeded our expectations. Great food, lovely room and great service from staff. The highlights were the super comfy bed, the spa treatments we got and dinner at Hugo's restaurant. The location of the hotel is perfect. Less than an hour from Dublin yet you feel like you are far away from the hustle of the city. We will definitely be returning! :)",5,2019,04,01
238,Mothers day lunch,"Booked the Sunday lunch for mothers day & we really enjoyed the food & the service. The food was excellent and the staff did everything possible to makes sure we enjoyed our day
No hesitation in recommending this restaurant, well worth a visit",5,2019,03,31
238,"A lovely welcome, great location, fab spa and the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in","Just back from a one night stay with my sister for Mothers wk end and I couldn't fault Druids Glen at all.
We both booked in for spa treatments I was lucky enough to have Danvor and Serena I floated out of the spa but all the staff were very very helpful as we arrived about 5 mins late due to getting stuck in traffic and they couldn't of done enough for us.
The room was lovely very good size bathroom with a bath and separate shower lovely view of the golf course but the best part was the beds my word are the cozy!
We had a meal in hugos the food was lovely but not loads of options 
The breakfast was delishious so many options loved the ommlet station and could see kids loving the pancakes one.
Overall a very nice relaxing stay",5,2019,03,31
238,Very Relaxing Break,"Reception staff are courteous, professional & friendly. On arrival we were upgraded to a Superior room. Very spacious, comfortable bed nespresso coffee machine & ample toiletries in a spacioua bathroom. I had a full body massage booked & my therapist,Elaine, was just superb! She had me totally relaxed & ready to enjoy the weekend break. After a lovely walk to the club house we enjoyed a drink & the views from the roof terrace. Leisure facilities were fine ..but again it is the quality of the staff that shone through. 
We ate in the Green Room & food was lovely, a but slow to arrive but the excellent staff kept us updated. 
Superb staff at this hotel led to a very relaxing weekend break.",5,2019,03,31
238,Fantastic hotel with welcoming staff,I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Druids Glen Hotel & Golf Resort.  Myself and the family stayed here as we had organised a surprise renewal of vows for my parents 40th wedding anniversary.  What can I say from the moment we booked the venue Nessa was such a pleasure to deal with everything was looked after from start to finish no detail was left out and all the staff were aware this was a surprise and helped us keep the surprise which was great!  The food was fantastic we had 17 guests in attendance and everyones plates where cleared and everyone commented on how this was one of the nicest meals they had.  I stayed in a superior room and had views over looking the grounds.  It was so amazing to wake up and look out at these stunning views.  The breakfast was also a real treat.  They had a huge selection of items to chose from everything from contiential to hot food buffet style and eggs made to order.  The staff where all a pleasure to deal with the service exceptional.  Myself and our family are already looking forward to another stay here very soon and would recommend this hotel to anyone planning an event or a romantic getaway.,5,2019,03,28
238,Welcoming and friendly,We loved this hotel.It was a special birthday treat and lived up to and beyond all my expectations.From the moment you enter the hotel you are greeted so warmly by such a pleasant reception team.The room upgrade to a suite was a lovely touch and a happy birthday card and chocolates organised through Joanne deserves a special thank you.The spaciousness and relaxed atmosphere in the hotel made for a very memorable stay. Breakfast was great with a good selection  and choice and really helpful restaurant staff. I would highly recommend the pleasant walking trail around the golf course.The hotel was recommended to us and I will certainly be recommending it to others. ,5,2019,03,27
238,Not worth the money,"We stayed here on a Thursday for one night, we were told at reception that our room was upgraded which we were very excited about. The room was on the third floor and had beautiful views of the golf course but the room it’s self was quite average and the bathroom was quite dated.
The Spa was a big disappointment especially the relaxation room, it was more of a corridor. The staff had to walk through it to get to other rooms so it was impossible to relax with the constant traffic of people. The girl we spoke to first at the spa reception was very cold and almost came across annoyed with us as we did not have treatments booked. The manager later dealt with us later and was professional and plesent.
Later that evening we had a meal in the bar and my dinner was almost inedible, I ordered the gnocchi which was over cooked and very chewy. My partner ordered a pizza which was lovely. The bar staff were very plesent and accommodating. The breakfast was lovely and had a good selection. 
Unfortunately we were very disappointed with our stay and will not be back.",2,2019,03,26
238,A great venue to celebrate a 90th birthday ,"Our family group of 18 have just spent 2 nights in the hotel to celebrate my mother’s 90th birthday. The event was a great success and everyone especially my mother, Anna, enjoyed it thoroughly. The hotel itself was an excellent venue but what really made the the weekend was the kindness and consideration of all the staff we came into contact with. They couldn’t have been nicer and went out of their way to ensure that all went well. Special mention to Luic and his colleagues in Hugo’s restaurant who looked after us so well for the celebration dinner. And equally to Kristian who couldn’t do enough for us at our other less formal gatherings. ",5,2019,03,19
238,Fantastic,"Was here for weekend break, from the very moment you walked into hotel the staff were really polite and friendly, every staff member smiled and said hello, room was well equipped, swimming pool sauna and steam room all very clean,
Walks around were nice just a pity you had to double back on route you had already taken would have preferred to complete the circumference of grounds but I suppose with the golf course it’s maybe not possible.
Breakfast was really nice with a large selection to suit almost everyone,
Evening menu was a little sparse as my wife is very limited at to what she eats but couldn’t fault food or service.
Would definitely visit again",5,2019,03,16
238,Perfect week of relaxation,"Spent 6 nights in a deluxe room, room large and comfortable, lovely views of the Wicklow mountains. Grounds excellent,great walk around edge of golf courses. Staff all friendly efficient and very much into making your stay memorable.  Reception staff so helpful. Most staff go above and beyond. Truly exceptional experience, can’t wait to return.  It really helped recharge the batteries",5,2019,03,15
238,Excellent!,"Instayed here recently in a twin room and I was very impressed. The hotel is in a lovely setting with nice grounds and views of them from the bar and restaurant. The staff were uniformly friendly, professional, personable but unobtrusive. This hotel provides an excellent standard, services, facilities and food without all the stuffy pomp and ceremony other hotels feel are commensurate with five stars. The rooms had all possible requirements available including a small fridge. The bath products were Elemis. 
The breakfast was fantastic with a huge array and variety. I've literally never seen anything like it and I've stayed in plenty of up market hotels. 
I will definitely be back and I look forward to it. I highly recommend it!",5,2019,03,12
238,We’ll be back,"we enjoyed a very quick one night stay in Druid’s Glen. A beautiful hotel. Lovely staff at check-in; friendly and welcoming. We had a drink in the bar before dinner which we enjoyed. All credit to the barman who made a mean mojito! Dinner in the restaurant was fantastic. The waiter was so attentive and knowledgeable- and great fun! The food was a delight. Couldn’t fault any aspect of it and we had the best table in the house, in front of the fire. Lovely room, very comfy bed, etc. The only fault I have is that the face cloths badly need to be replaced - worn and rough! Gorgeous breakfast the next morning with everything you could wish for.  We’ll definitely be back!",5,2019,03,09
238,Perfect Family Break,"We had the most wonderful weekend away in this hotel. Despite the weather being awful and I ended up being really unwell for one whole day, there was no better place I could imagine to rest and recuperate. The beds are divine, the quiet room was perfectly tranquil and the staff couldn’t have been more helpful and pleasant to deal with, from check in to check out and all the meals inbetween. The room was spacious, until the camp bed and travel cot were set up for the children at least. The bathroom with separate shower and bath was ideal and the selection of toiletries was lovely, (including an adorable set for the children) was a really nice touch. We ate in Hugos (dinner) and The Garden Rooms (Lunch and dinner), both were faboulous. The options for breakfast were plentiful and delicious. The only thing I would suggest to fully complete the children’s menu/for the younger children would be for their meals to be served in/with more child friendly crockery. Smaller/lighter dishes that a child or toddler can handle and have fit on the tray of their highchair would be nice. The staff were really helpful finding a small pastry fork and teaspoon for my daughter to use (because we forgot to pack her own set for the weekend away). Any mistakes or mishaps while dining were dealt with very professionally and pleasantly which we appreciate.
When I spoke with Shauna at reception about needing a little longer in the morning after being unwell all of Saturday she was particularly  understanding and helpful. I highly recommend the place and facilities for families with young children - the playroom was especially wonderful. Thank you again to all the staff, we are looking forward to visiting again!",5,2019,03,05
238,Overnight stay,"Class hotel. So many staff. One more helpful and kind than the next. Room spectacular, food in garden room fabulous. The best breakfast choice ever. Lovely walk around the hotel. Leisure nice but packed. More facilities in the leisure area would make it perfect",5,2019,03,03
238,Perfect in everyway,"Three of us met here and upon arrival we couldn’t fault the service, the two ushers could not have done more for us, full of character, information and top quality service, food was delicious and versatile, rooms were great, reception staff helpful and friendly, it was the perfect overnight getaway ❤️😍❤️",5,2019,03,03
238,Fantastic Hotel,Spent one night for an anniversary. Staff are very professional & friendly. Hotel very clean. Food was excellent. The pool is warm and very relaxing. Great atmosphere in the bar. Perfect stay. We will be back soon. ,5,2019,03,03
238,A Classic,"This wasn't our first stay at Druids but always nice to reminded that they are so good at what they do.
We stayed on a Saturday evening, and this is a busy hotel and there was a wedding on but it never feels like that. It's relaxed and comfortable, but it's quality work and understanding of 5 star service that delivers that atmosphere.

From check in to check out, we had a great experience.
Lovely comfortable, clean room. Excellent massages and spa experience in the relaxation suite. A fantastic dinner in Hugos - very impressed actually, well thought out, delicious dishes. A few drinks in the newly refurbished bar. 
And of course the renowned Druids breakfast in the morning.

Druids is a classy outfit.",5,2019,03,02
238,Our 3rd Trip Here.,"As the title relays this was indeed our third trip the Druids Glen. We came here in 2015 were my husband proposed, last year with our two sons (age 2 years) and 4 weeks and again this February. 

And it just gets better! The refurbishment is so luxurious I can't even describe the feeling of richness and superb furniture in the lobby and garden rooms, my husband and I adore sitting here with a book and glass of wine. Lit up at night for dinner and bar activities is just the cherry on the cake. I have seen in some comments that people have said the Druids isn't 5 star due to the lack of spa facilities or other things and whilst I can see their point I do have to stress that this hotel approaches luxury in it's onw way. 1-2 hours spent in the lobby (really an insult to call it that) or the garden rooms is like a spa treatment itself! The décor has been carefully designed and thought out to ensure the atmosphere is one of utter relaxation even with kids around! And speaking of kids, I do have to emphasise that the baby pantry and family attention by the staff is most definitely 5 star for us parents struggling with little ones! 

Jo checked us in and once we arrived in our room we were greeted with our prosecco and a box of chocolates, finished with a personal letter from the CEO, Edward, to welcome us back and wish us a pleasant stay which really is a lovely touch. It's nice to feel appreciated when your custom is returning to ANY hotel! Jo rang seconds after we got into the room to offer us an upgrade which was lovely of her, she was a gem. A mention for Barry also who was just so so pleasant, really made you feel welcome to the hotel. 

There are plenty of choices for food, if you enjoy fancy rich food then Hugo's restaurant is a MUST for you! If you like less bells and whistles then the bar food is perfect although my only slight complaint is the steak comes with zero dressing which is a little odd but not a huge issue! 

The Druids Glen gives high standards and in turn it is a little more costly than other hotels both to stay in and to also have drinks/food in but it really is worth it. It's our little home away from home and we are looking forward to returning as soon as we can.",5,2019,02,27
238,Amazing Break away with baby and Toddler,"My Wife and i just had our first trip away to a hotel with a toddler(18mnths) and an 8 week old baby, eerything was made so easy by every staff member, i was so impressed with just how child friendly this hotel was and the baby pantry was very impressive indeed. We only had the bar food, which was really delicious and very accomadting for kids.

an excellent place to stay and we shall definatley be back would like to commend All the staff on a fantastic service in this hotel,

 
I cannot stress enough how child friendly this place is! TOP CLASS",5,2019,02,26
238,A little disappointing actually ,"Arrived at 3.45pm (check-in is from 4pm) to be told our room was not ready. Fine - we went for a drink in the bar and waited for the notification we were told we would get when our room, which was put at high priority, was ready. No notification came by 4.30pm so we went and asked and alas the room had been ready but nobody told us. 
The room was underwhelming, and didn’t seem like a king size bed as advertised. Anyway we came mainly to use the spa so headed straight there. 
Not a huge selection of facilities in the spa - one jacuzzi, one sauna, one steam room, a plunge pool, and the main pool. All were fine but we expected more variety. No outdoor spa facilities. 
In the evening we went to the hotel restaurant to eat. We were hungry so opted not to go to the fine dining one. The menu in the other one turned out to be surprisingly limited although both our dishes were nice. Definitely should be more options on the menu. 
There was no live entertainment which was disappointing. Yes it was a Wednesday night but the hotel was busy and some music would have really added. So instead of spending money in the bar we went back to the room. 
Didn’t eat breakfast so cannot comment on that. 
Having typically gone to Galgorm we decided to try Druid’s Glen for a change. It is considerably cheaper but that doesn’t make it good value. This hotel is not comparable to Galgorm if it’s the spa facilities that are the driver for your booking. Below par for spa, room, and lack of music but brought back up to average by the price. ",3,2019,02,26
238,Relaxing stay ,"Hotel is really nice, reception staff are efficient and welcoming. The decor and atmosphere is beautiful. Rebecca in the bar is very attentive and super friendly. Teadgh concierge is excellent. Food is really nice. Excellent value for money. Our only complaint is the cocktails are overpriced and not well made I.e. the espresso martini was curdling. ",4,2019,02,25
238,Fantastic family friendly trip,"Just left after spending a few days during mid term, we had a wonderful time. Staff were very friendly and accommodating and children's entertainment was fantastic.Food and drink was excellent. We will be back",5,2019,02,23
238,Beautiful,"My partner and I came here on Sunday evening for dinner in Hugo's it was absolutely beautiful, we had a 3 course meal to celebrate our engagement and it was absolutely gorgeous and all of the staff were so friendly. The surroundings were lovely, amazing place to see ",4,2019,02,22
238,"5 star hotel, 5 star service.","My wife and I stayed in the druids glen resort on the 15th of Feb. The service and facilities are amazing. Very friendly staff who couldn't do more to make our stay super. Jo on the reception desk  made us feel welcome from the moment we arrived surpassing any customer service expectations I had.   
The standard of the hotel is excellent and situated in such a beautiful setting. Probably my favourite hotel in Ireland.",5,2019,02,20
238,Nice hotel but did not live up to its 5 star reputation,"Myself and my boyfriend went here for a quiet night away. Room quality is excellent. Bed is super comfortable and service good. Food at the bar was not up to scratch though. Ordered a burger that was not worth the price, didn’t end up eating it and my boyfriend ordered pasta which came out as risotto. 
I was extremely disappointed with the food which put a dampener on our stay.
However breakfast was excellent, huge variety and very helpful. Overall a nice hotel but very very let down by the bar food",3,2019,02,18
238,Valentine's Babymoon,Just got back from an amazing overnight stay in Druids Glen. From start to finish we had the most amazing time in such a beautiful location. From our massages to fab dinner and amazing suite. We couldn't fault our stay. What made it even more special was the excellent service and smiles of the colleagues working there. Special mention to two fantastic ladies at reception Jo and Adrienne who upgraded us to a beautiful suite and couldn't do enough for us. Thank you! Also Jurgita at dinner was so friendly and welcoming and made me feel really comfortable as i am pregnant and she was happy talking about babies and pregnancy to me. We will certainly be back and will spread the word of what a truly fantastic hotel it is but the ladies mentioned really made it extra special.,5,2019,02,16
238,Spa day 😄,"Fab Spa, Paula and Tom were great Therapists, my husband and I had the full Body massages and they were great, deserve the recognition for their talent for sure . Thanks a million, food in bar was gorgeous too  😀",5,2019,02,13
238,Relaxation at its finest,A group of us went as a family and we felt at ease for the trip in its entirety. The breakfast was outstanding with such a variety of options (including a pancake and omelette bar). We opted for sticking to the bar menu for the food and each item ordered was delicious. Entertainment on the Friday night was brilliant as well. Rooms kept immaculately and service is excellent.,5,2019,02,12
238,Home away from home,"This is truly a give star experience. Staf is so lovely and accomodating. Food is amazing and ambiance feels luxurious yet homely! Alway a pleasure to visit. 
The stay was a birthday gift by my best friend. We arrived to have afternoon tea. Such a wonderful and tasty experience. After having slept in the utterly comfortable beds, day two comprised relaxing spa treatments and a three course meal that was spectacular. I have stayed at Druids Glen several times now and the quality and service are alway top notch. Truly feels like a home away from home. Can’t wait till my next visit.",5,2019,02,12
238,Friday night escape,"My wife booked a Friday night escape to Druids Glen. The trip crept up on us and I didn’t know what to expect. The deal included a 4 course meal, a bottle of Prosecco with bed and breakfast. 

Honestly, we had a great time. The meal was fantastic and the setting was great. Proximity to Dublin was ideal and if we could do it again I’d be sitting in Friday evening N11 traffic in a heartbeat.",4,2019,02,12
238,Tranquility,Service excellent and very comfortable rooms with all amenities. If golf is your hobby this hotel is for you with a good Golf Resort.  Great bar and food.  Reasonably priced and ideal for a couples retreat or a golfing trip.,5,2019,02,12
238,Anniversary Stay,"Myself and my partner celebrated our anniversary on Sunday. The location is amazing. Tranquil surroundings yet so close to the motorway.The hotel itself is very beautiful. Attention to detail and the staff couldn't do enough. Very hospitable and accommodating. From front desk, concierge to housekeeping. Everyone was lovely. The leisure facilities are nice. Beautiful steam room. That was a stand out for me. Only negative was our chicken main for dinner was a bit rough and the menu itself wasn't to our particular taste. But that is subjective so I can't be too critical at all. The breakfast was beautiful. The sleep was amazing and the room was very clean and spacious. Overall a pleasant experience. Excellent value for money based on the February deal.",4,2019,02,12
238,Too many mistakes!,"I mostly enjoyed my birthday weekend at this hotel-the staff, the food, and the room were lovely. The spa was good and I enjoyed my massage.

However, my stay was clouded by a few things.

Partly my fault but I hadn't realised our 2 night stay for 460 euro didnt include breakfast. We were never reminded of this, either over the phone while booking dinner or at breakfast each morning.

They pre-authorised my card for 700 euro. I also wouldn't have really minded too much if i had been warned about the amount, as it gets held for about five days after you pay your bill in full.

When I went to check out, I noticed a random charge of 95 euro for a restaurant meal we never had. i queried it and they removed it, but with no explanation. If i hadnt spotted it, then i guess we would have just paid it?

After we checked out and paid in full, i noticed 3 days later they charged ANOTHER 450 euro to my card. After calling, I was told it was an error with their processors and they refunded it, which takes a few days to process. But it got me wondering, if I hadnt noticed the extra 450 euro missing, would they have even bothered to contact me?

So I was down about 1500 euro of my own funds for a week, and this was after we paid in full for our 2 night stay.

So, while i enjoyed the warmth of the staff, the food in the restaurant and the overall ambience, i can't recommend this hotel until they beome a bit more transparent and considerate.",3,2019,02,10
238,Amazing first break as a family!! ,"I was very apprehensive about going away with my baby for our first proper break, but this was just amazing! From start to finish we had a ball. The playroom was unbelievable, as was the playground and the walks. The baby pantry stocked with nappies, food, microwave, sterilizers and washing facilities was so useful, as was the offer by staff on arrival to call for milk, warm or cold at any time. The room was spacious and clean, and quiet at all times even though the hotel was busy. The pool was lovely and the perfect temperature for a baby. The staff were faultless, making sure every need was met. They went out of their way to smile and talk to my little one, who has just started walking. Food was delicious, breakfast was a huge spread of fresh, tasty selections. Pancakes and omelettes were made on request. We also ate in the restaurant and dined in the room, each was lovely. I would so highly recommend this hotel, the relaxed, friendly atmosphere will definitely see us returning. ",5,2019,02,09
238,Disappointing in areas.,"I emailed the hotel this same review and got a reply from Eoin but I also put everything on TripAdvisor. 

I was very impressed with the extremely warm welcome I received upon my arrival on the Thursday evening from the lady on reception. She is a wonderful asset to the resort and made me and my very recent fiancee feel already appreciated guests. 

The bar staff are superb, I mean that. Very courteous and address the client with utmost respect. They have a great rapport with each other and they are smiling naturally whilst enjoying their duties. Too many hotels have lost this in bars, the strict wooden, fake greetings are unfortunately aplenty nowadays. Well done in this department. This all helps make for a more relaxing time. 

The pool facilities are brilliant, best streamroom I have visited in a long time with the bonus of a plunge pool, just perfect. Staff in pool are efficient and also welcoming.  Well done lads.

I thought that our breakfast to our room the following morning would be a nice treat and help us to relax as we were very tired after the long flight. 

Well breakfast arrived on time to our room the following morning and had everything I requested from list. However the breakfast was NOT hot , only lukewarm at best. Not good enough I'm afraid. Especially for the additional charge for a poor experience. We just ate it as we were hungry so no point in complaining then. 

Yes I found the room chilly.  I woke up at night due to this. The AC did not raise the room temperature enough even though I had it set at 30, the room at best was only 19. Too cold during the winter months, fine in the summer. 

Balcony door was also draughty.Whistled with the wind.

Now upon checking out the lady on reception was condescending in both her tone and words. She seems to have a feminist attitude, (ok but not appropriate in a hospitality environment), especially when she said to me,

""Well you're a man"" .

Now in the context of the conversation and her tone of voice she was being extremely rude to my perception and should not let her emotions interfere whilst being in the professional role.

It really ended my visit to Druids Glen Resort on a sour note.

Hotel staff are a team and all it takes is just one to let the side down.

The Reception area is the first and last impression that guests experience of any establishment and it should always be excellent as they are the face of the place too. 

So wonderful arrival, however dreadful check out on departure. ",3,2019,02,07
238,OVER THE TOP LUXURY & SERVICE,"My niece brought me to stay here for a night on Friday. She insisted that it is her absolute favourite hotel. I have to agree, I am still here and its Sunday. I had a few requests upon arrival and the staff bent over backwards to assist me. My suite is just beautiful with all that anyone could want. We have had most of the food on the room service menu and it was all very tasty. Thank u Sophia 😃. I am going to be sad leaving tomorrow but I will definately be back. Thank u to all the staff. Smiling all the time and so very nice and kind. I wish I could take Teaghue home with me. See u all soon. ",5,2019,02,03
238,Wow...... HOME FROM HOME,"This hotel is outstanding. The rooms are lovely so are the facilities. BUT what REALLY REALLY makes this hotel stand out, way above any other hotel, is the STAFF.  The minute you drive up to the front door you are greeted by such gentleman - Teaghue and Mirko. They swooped over to us - smiles and banter all around then took our luggage and parked my car.  Arriving at reception we were met with smiling faces with an easy and very friendly check-in by Adrienne, Bradly and Marie.  We had a fantastic afternoon with delish food and a “few” beverages. Patient, welcoming and extremely professional staff, Mattie, Irina & Ivana. We were only supposed to stay the one night, Friday. Still here. Not leaving till Monday. Too nice to leave. We could go on and on and on. Lifts to driving range, great room service and the breakfast buffet is to die for. Thank you all so much for a fantastic time filled with great lasting memories. ",5,2019,02,02
238,"Fantastic Bar food, Slow cooked JD Brisket burger 🍔🍔was 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻 🍔 ","We didn’t stay the night in the hotel we just popped into the hotel bar for a casual bite to eat & to warm up after climbing the Sugarloaf mountain. You are greeted with a vast open reception area and headed straight for the comfy couches located at the back of the bar area overlooking the gardens & wooded area. If it had been a warmer summer day we would have sat out on the balcony but we went that brave.

As the headline says I chose the Jd Slow Cooked Brisket burger it was Devine and quite good value for the quality & size of the plate of food I got. 
My Gf ordered the sea food chowder & was not disappointed either 👍.
We ordered a desert between us which was a sort of sorbet with a glazed pineapple slice stuck in it surround with crushed almonds & it was divinely presented and tasted great.

We shared a coffee afterwards and I think all in all it came to about €45 which was v.expensive and the reason for only getting 4stars but when you go to a 5star resort expect to pay 5star prices but it was nice for a Sunday treat.

I’d love to stay here some time but until I get bought a voucher or win the lottery it won’t be anytime soon.

So if you want a bit of comfort and luxury and don’t mind spending a few €€ pop in for lunch in lovely surroundings.",4,2019,01,29
238,Lovely stay,"We are just back from a 2 night stay @ Druids Glen and we had a lovely stay. This is the first time we travelled with our new born son so were nervous how we would get on & how he would like it. We shouldn't have worried as we all had a great time. 
We had bar food both nights, the service and food were both excellent. (The staff are very friendly. ) The Spa, gym & pool facilities are really good ….the wife recommends the hot stone massage. 
But I have to mention the kids pantry, maybe all hotels have this but because we never needed it before we never knew it was there. It definitely is there in Druids Glen & is a really nice touch, nice place where you can sterilize & heat bottles and they supply some essentials, thanks again.
Even got some nice weather so we got to walk around the grounds.",5,2019,01,29
238,Luxury Stay and Superb Staff,"Stayed in your hotel last Friday night as it was a treat for my partners 40th birthday. I had been in contact with Jessica in reservations about the booking and she was more than helpful to assist with any requests. On arrival we were greeted by a kind porter who took our luggage and Jo on reception checked us in, she was a breath of fresh air to deal with and very informative. We received an upgrade to a suite which we were blown away by, it was such a kind gesture and one that will bring me back, may i add the room was fantastic and i would highly recommend it. we had dinner in Hugo's that evening, the food and service could not be faulted. They brought out my Partners desert with a birthday greeting on the plate and a candle and sang happy birthday, I didn't even request that, its the little things that go along way. Breakfast was hot fresh and tasty, pool was clean and facilities were lovely. Druids Glen pride themselves on well trained and top class service, which is extremely evident. I would highly recommend and I already look forward to the next return.",5,2019,01,28
238,Another great stay!,"We stay at Druids Glen once or twice a year with the kids.  Our latest trip was over the Christmas break.  The facilities are excellent and the staff are brilliant.  Hugo's continues to deliver high quality meals for us.  

We keep going back because the hotel, in all areas, is consistently excellent.

I have read some recent reviews and see that some of the staff, Thomasz in particular, getting some negative comments  He served us on both nights, and on previous stays, and our experience has always been a positive one. 

See you all again at Easter!",5,2019,01,27
238,5 star treatment from start to finish,"We have just returned from a visit to Druid’s Glen and Spa.  The atmosphere in the hotel is very calming and relaxed and everyone of the staff had lovely smiles on their faces as they went about the business. 
On arrival we were given hot lavender towels which was a lovely touch and very relaxing.  We were immediately and escorted to our room despite it only being 11am. We went to the spa and began our treatments- it was very relaxing.  Georgia and Danielle were fantastic.  There was a mix up in the spa but it was handled impeccable.  
Following our treatments we relaxed in our room and ordered room service which was brought to our room by a lovely lady called Niamh.  Tasty food beautifully presented. 
They have a wide variety of choices for breakfast- we were spoilt for choice. 
We enjoyed our stay and will definitely return. ",5,2019,01,26
238,Don't let the other reviews fool you. This place is extremely poor and NOT 5 stars.,"Fancy decor does not a 5 star make.

What an absolutely horrendous experience I paid through the nose for. Don't let the 5 star moniker fool you, this place is far from 5 stars.

Restaurant staff, Thomasz in particular, was absolutely shocking. I felt like I was on some weird reality show as he threw my food down in front of me or as I asked for some water or as I waited 40 minutes for him to take our food order or as I watched him pour the wine I didn't ask for and then listen to him claim that it was despite the bottle being clearly visible. The restaurant was an absolute pig sty, the service extremely poor, the staff obnoxious and our late booking was clearly an inconvenience.

Our paid for breakfast was an hour late as we were strolling out the door of our hotel room with broken curtains that I had to repair myself.

I left this barely 2 star ""resort"" exhausted because of how loud the place is. The doors slamming all night were a nightmare. I've literally had more pleasant stays in hostels and I'm genuinely not hard to please.

This place is not worth the money. You might have an experience like some of the other ""reviews"" here, but I'm pretty certain you're more likely to an experience like mine. Don't say you weren't warned.",1,2019,01,21
238,Amazing Service & Very Tasty Food,We have been here twice in January and both stays were exceptional. Ladies at reception go above and beyond to make you feel welcome. Food is extremly tasty and I would highly recommend the wings. Cocktails are of a very high standard also.,5,2019,01,20
238,Let down by restaurant,"A bunch of friends and I stayed here and I have to say overall the hotel was very impressive - clean, nicely decorated, well-maintained and lots of areas to relax and chat/read a book etc and mostly friendly obliging staff. The bar is really nicely laid out and the bedrooms are good. However the restaurant (Hugos) was an entirely different story. Service was tepid at best and totally charmless. We have stayed/eaten in a great range of places and it is a very mean economy to serve a main course with a measly scoop of mashed potato and charge nearly €5 EXTRA for a portion of vegetable.....even more so when said vegetable was bog standard carrot which retails about 49c a bag in your local supermarket. The main courses lacked imagination - there was nothing special about them. The ""table water"" read tap water - was deemed undrinkable by all 6 of us, forcing us to buy bottled water - if your tap water is not fit for consumtion then the substitute should be on the house. Down the corridor in the bar the water was fine - go figure! No tea/coffee included on the tabled'hote menu - overall a feeling of someone cutting a few corners too many because we definitely won't be caught dining here again - pity, as the rest of the hotel was really nice.",4,2019,01,20
238,Another excellent stay,"Stayed at the Druids for our annual night away to celebrate hubby/dad birthday. We arrived around 2pm and was told our room was ready. We did the walking trail then settled in the bar to watch the Man United match. (Our 10 yr old being a fan!)
We had drinks and ordered good from the bar menu. Food was very tasty and menu choices varied. After a few games in the games room, including table football, we headed back to our room. The room was lovely and warm, spotlessley clean & as usual, contained everything we might need. Breakfast the next morning was to a very big standard, and tasty.
A big shout out to the staff at this hotel, very professional in manner yet friendly and helpful.
The bar staff in particular should get a special mention. They were working really hard and were lovely & friendly. The bar area has a lovely ambience, as does the whole hotel. If you require a night away in beautiful surroundings, in a hotel of a high standard, to unwind & relax...this is the one!
We will be back",5,2019,01,20
238,Quick bar lunch,Hadn’t been for a while so went for lunch to see what the new management was like. Food was lovely. Good menu choice. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Prices were good for the quality of the establishment. ,4,2019,01,20
238,Couldn't recommend enough,"I have never come across more helpful and friendly staff, they really were amazing, especially the waiters and reception, place was amazing and very child friendly, we got bar food which was a little over priced and small portions but still enjoyed it. I will definitely be back",5,2019,01,18
238,Perfect blend luxury and friendliness ,"I rarely take time to write reviews except when I am truly impressed by service and experience.  We stayed at this hotel in November for a 2 day break for some rest and a break from house confinement following my wife’s joint surgery leaving her house and wheelchair bound for 2 months. Both of us in need of a change of scene and some pampering we booked the presidential suite (which we got a special rate on) and from the moment we arrived to when we left the staff could not have been more accommodating or helpful. The hotel is 5 star so comfort of room lounges etc where as you’d expect it was however the friendliness and warmth of all staff that made this hotel stand out.  So much so that when it came time to leave we couldn’t bring ourselves to do so and stayed an extra night. We both took several treatments in the spa and the staff there went the extra mile to make my wife (Sorcha’s) stay as comfortable and relaxing as possible. They sent various products(cleansers, masks, moisturiser,candles etc)to our room for her to use. Cynical readers might think this a ploy to sell their products but we felt it was not that but simply they where genuine nice, caring and warm people. This also ran through all of the staff who after a day could greet us by name. 
It is rare to find a 5 star hotel that can deliver on the luxury and services and at the same time make your stay relaxed,informal,warm and homely. 

A special thanks to all of you who achieved that for us and we hope to return when Sorcha is back on her feet.

238,Utter bliss,"We honeymooned in Druids Glen last week for 3 nights. When we checked in there was a slight issue with our room. Adrienne couldn’t have been more helpful and moved us to a beautiful suite! We were gifted with a bottle of Prosecco when she heard we were on honeymoon and we were given two glasses of champagne after dinner! To say we were treated excellently is an understatement and it was such a treat. We most definitely will be back, we had a blissful few days. Top class!",5,2019,01,15
238,Christmas family fun,"We had a big family get-together at Christmas in Druids Glen ages from 0 - 67 and everyone had a ball! There was a games room for the kids, the pool worked for everyone. We swam before breakfast and then enjoyed a long breakfast ... you would need a few hours to work your way through all the fab options, the kids loved the pancake station. We did the walk around to the golf club, and after a pint were too lazy to walk back to the hotel so the shuttle brought us back! The staff were so helpful. We ate in the bar mainly, loads of comfy corners to chill out and play board games. The hotel helped organise a babysitter one evening and we squeezed in an adult only dinner in the restaurant which was amazing. I would highly recommend this hotel for families, there is so much to do including a fairy garden and a playground. We will be back!   ",5,2019,01,15
238,Most enjoyable stay,A lovely 5* hotel to stay in.  Very friendly staff who give five star service to their guests.  The waiting staff in the restaurant are to be commended.  Breakfast was delicious too.  Congratulations to the General Manager on a great product and most importantly an excellent team.  The Commissioner was a pleasure to talk to.   ,5,2019,01,13
238,An excellent stay from start to finish.,"Spent one night here with family. Could not find fault with any aspect of the hotel. Spotlessly clean, comfortable rooms. Delicious food and drink. 
But the crowning glory was the hotels very friendly and professional staff. From the doorman to the receptionist, to the bar staff, everyone  made our party feel so welcome. Even the man I passed on the corridor who was fixing a curtain tie back stopped, smiled and said ""hello"".
Will definitely be returning.",5,2019,01,13
238,Just marvellous. ,"Just love this place and of course will return. The rooms are lovely and staff so professional. I have to give a big shout-out to Barbara, the hostess in Hugo’s. Just so very friendly and even to make a point of coming over us at reception to say goodbye speaks volumes. Looking forward to our next visit. 
One thought - would be good to have a loyalty scheme or at least a Winter Sale offer that is not just mid-week! ",5,2019,01,13
238,Couples weekend trip,"Luxury! Druids glen was a brilliant place to spend a great anniversary weekend. One of the best 5* in Ireland, great stay in a suite, fine dining in the restaurant and the golf.. course was immaculate for February. Great stay recommend to anyone.",5,2019,01,10
238,Fabulous afternoon tea! ,"This hotel is a gem. I enjoyed a fabulous nights day with my friends followed by a scrumptious breakfast the next morning. We later enjoyed afternoon tea as our final treat before leaving and it was superb! 

Most definitely recommend to anyone even if dropping in for a bite! I can’t remember the lady who served us afternoon tea but I remember she was Polish (as her name badge said). Credit to her as she provided a great customer service! Thanks for making our tea delightful with your pleasant and welcoming presence :) 

The location is quite isolated but generally worth the travel. ",4,2019,01,10

The room was lovely and service is very good! Irina was very friendly who served  us at the garden bar , we think shes an asset to the hotel! 
Breakfast was amazing and staff very friendly! 
The only thing , we expected spa to have higher standards , but overall it was a very relaxing stay , and also thanks to Maria who gave us a later 1pm check out!! ",4,2019,01,09
238,Family Christmas At Druids Glen Resort,From start to finish our stay was flawless the hotel rooms were cleaned to an impeccable standard - loved the candy canes on Christmas Eve :) Nothing was too much trouble the service and the food and beverages in the Bar and Hugos restaurant were top class with a unique but very tasty selection of Gins which were helpfully recommended to us. The team on the front desk were so friendly and helpful. My signature treatment in the spa was one of the best thank you Druids Glen for a wonderful family Stay we will definitely be back soon. Happy new year :),5,2019,01,08
238,Wedding anniversary treat,"We came overnight for our wedding anniversary. Having mentioned this on booking, we were more than pleasantly surprised when we got an upgrade to an Executive suite! This was fabulous (I was sorry we were only there for one night!) and very quiet, being at the end of a corridor.
We had lunch, dinner and breakfast, all of which were lovely. We also visited the spa and the swimming pool. This pool was busy but a lane was kept free for swimmers. Lots of families and children around as it was the holiday season. The staff were very good - when our lunch was delayed because of a large group, they came over to apologise and gave us complimentary coffees which was a nice gesture. 
We ended a lovely stay with a walk around the grounds before heading home.",5,2019,01,07
238,Spa Day & High Tea,"Spent a beautiful day starting with the pool, jacuzzi, sauna and steam room before moving into the relaxation room and receiving the most amazing treatment in the spa and finishing off with delicious High Tea. The facilities are amazing but what really made our day was the wonderful treatment from all the staff, no matter what department. The spa treatment really was 5 star and would highly recommend anyone visiting to book on a treatment ⭐️ Will definitely return and will book an overnight next time to get the full experience.",5,2019,01,06
238,40th birthday treat,"I booked this hotel for my husband's 40th and we brought 2 young boys along. Overall we had a really enjoyable stay. Check in was 4pm ( a little later than I thought) so our room wasn't ready at 3pm. Not too much of a problem as we had a good look around and there was a children's entertainer so the boys were happy. We asked about booking a table in the bar for dinner but we were told that we could just come along and wait for table. I was a little concerned because my boys are not ""happy"" when they are hungry. We went for a swim and then dinner. Thankfully there was a table free but while we were waiting to be seated a lady came in and asked for her table to be changed to a later time. I made a mental note to book a table for the next night at breakfast. Dinner was good and children's menu was super! On our way to the room we saw board games and DVDs. The boys choose a couple of DVDs and they were settled for the evening. The room was lovely, it had everything we needed and it was very comfortable.
Breakfast the next day was very good but a little bit of a wait for the fried eggs (cooked to order). I tried again to book the bar but receptionist said the hotel was fully booked and they were not taking reservations for the bar that evening as they didn't want tables waiting empty. As we were around the hotel for the morning I asked again at the bar around lunch time if I could book a table for that evening. The waitress went away and brought back a clip board to tell us that they were totally booked for the evening and they had no tables free. I explained what the receptionist told me but she just repeated that the bar was booked out. Oh dear!! We went early anyway and agin thankfully they had a table. It was a low table with sofas but it was fine, considering I thought we were not going to eat!
We booked a table for 'Hugo's' the following evening. Food was good but not amazing. I would save your money and eat in the bar unless it was a special occasion.
The staff were brilliant with the boys, room very comfortable, bar lovely, pool good but no children's pool. My husband had a spa treatment and said it was lovely. It was a little confusing about booking for dinner. However we would stay again!",4,2019,01,05
238,Day spa review,"Fantastic setting but overall we were disappointed with the Spa which essentially just some treatment rooms on the side of the hotel swimming pool. 
The pool area is nice but you need to go through the health club reception and up the stairs to get to the ‘spa’.
3/4 of the treatments were very good particularly the massage. 
Lunch was lovely and even though they had no record of our reservation the staff made sure we had a good seat over looking the golf course. ",3,2019,01,05
238,Amazing spot for a family getaway,Absolutely fantastic resort.  Very family friendly and welcoming.  Highly recommend it especially if you've got young kids. The staff always go above and beyond to make you feel welcomed. They also have fantastic facilities for kids. ,5,2019,01,05
238,Post Xmas trip,came in New Year's Day for a relaxing night post Xmas .it was my 3rd time to stay .as always lovely staff and beautiful bedrooms .i do realise that there would still be many big groups still staying but after just about  getting a table at 2 for lunch we went off and came back at 6 to an extremely busy complete bar area so much so it was only open to residents .we couldn't get a table for food and couldn't book one so had to sit in lobby area where you can't eat food .i felt that upon arrival we should have notified that hotel very busy and to book a table for food we were eventually at 8 given a small table .its a shame to find that as a resident you couldn't get a table for food .i have stayed in August which was fairly busy but never a table issue .,5,2019,01,02
238,Wedding ,We attended wedding here 30 th Dec - fantastic venue and food and service second to none.  Really enjoyed our overnight stay too.  Will be back and would highly recommend hotel.

238,Staying to visit Santa nearby,"We have stayed here a few times and always come away feeling that we have had a special break away, this time was no different. Childrens’ playroom is excellent, breakfast is hard to beat, family room is nicely decorated and spacious. Thoroughly enjoyable. I did leave the hotel feedback regarding a minor issue with delays in service during our dinner which they responded to, would definitely stay here again.",5,2018,12,30
238,Excellent customer service,The hotel is only 30 km from Dublin. Great location close the the N11. Its only a short drive to Powerscourt which is worth a visit. You are made to feel welcome from the minute you arrive. All of the staff throughout the hotel are friendly and helpful. Top class customer service. Very comfortable room. We can recommend the food in the bar and the restaurant. Great breakfast. The gym and pool is a great place to relax and unwind. ,5,2018,12,30
238,Classic ambiance and amazing service,"First visit to resort -overwhelmed by wonderful venue and superb service. At dinner amicable staff member Holly noted we were celebrating an event and a celebratory desert soon arrived. Rooms were spacious and great amenities-pool, playground and running trails. Putting Druids Glen in the diary for next treat.",5,2018,12,28
238,Disappointed,"Not the 5* experience you're expecting.

Expected better for the price of a room for 1night.

Food in bar better than Hugo's.

Health club was like your local Aura, kids everywhere.

Not a place to go to relax.

Walks were nice.
Within the grounds there is a housing estate. 
It's very much a family resort and not a relaxing couple getaway.",3,2018,12,27
238,Luxurious,This is a fabulous hotel for a restful break. The overall feeling is of comfort and it is an easy hotel to feel at home in. The staff are so well trained and in tune with the guests at all times. Particular mention to Marie at reception. Her welcome was so warm and she told us any necessary information in such a friendly way. My only issue was with the Garden Room. Service there was very slow and the staff were unfriendly. The room was also cold.,5,2018,12,23
238,Lovely pre Christmas treat,Just back from a lovely night at Druid's Glen. The extras that make this a five star experience were clear from the moment we arrived and for all of our stay. The staff were very professional and friendly. Such a special place with beautiful decor throughout. The out door facilities were fantastic for families.  Unfortunately the weather wasn't great for us to enjoy them. We will just have to come back!,5,2018,12,23
238,Two Night Stay,"My wife and I stayed in Druids Glen a few months ago.
Apologies in only writing a review now!! 
We were met at reception by a lovely lady who checked us in quickly. Our room was fantastic and we had a lovely dessert plate dropped to our room. We went for food in the bar which was fantastic and the waiter looking after us I think his name was Chris. Very friendly team members and the bar is lovely. We ate in the Restaurant the second night and again all team members were extremely friendly and helpful. Lovely walks around the property. A big thank you to Romy who looked after us.
We will definitely return!!",5,2018,12,18
238,Wonderful ,"Myself and two friends treated ourselves to a night in Druid’s Glen last Sunday. I have to say, not forgetting the decor, great room size, five Star treatment and very festive decorations and atmosphere, the thing that  makes this hotel stand out it it’s staff. 
Each and every one of them, highly trained, knowledgeable, friendly and efficient. They are just wonderful.
A most enjoyable stay.
We will definitely be back. Big Thank You and Happy Christmas to all in Druids Glen.

238,Lovely Stay,"We stayed overnight using a pigsback voucher. It was very good value! The hotel is very well appointed. The room we had was big, my two kids were free (under 12). It was clean and the free toiletries were L’Occitane brand! It would have been nice though if toothbrush/toothpaste were provided as well (I forgot to pack my kids toothbrushes). The breakfast menu was very good as well! 

We had dinner in Hugo’s which was lovely!!! And do the walking trail, it is a good walk with nice views. 

Staff of the hotel were very friendly and helpful. Highly recommended.",5,2018,12,11
238,Wow wow wow!! What a stay thank you!!,"Well where to start,... simply a lovely experience. From start to finish our stay here was superb. On arrival the staff could not have been more helpful to us, travelli g with toddler twins comes with a lot of stuff, and we were so welcomed and helped.

The hotel is beyond stunning, the room luxurious and I simply cannot recommend this hotel enough. One of our twins is dairy intolerant and we had dinner in the bar that evening. The restaurant manager and staff did absolutely everything possible to make sure we were looked after. We were going to have some pasta for the girls, but the restaurant manager was concerned about the dairy and checked, and to his credit he was right to be. The kitchen even make their own pasta and confirmed there was dairy in it. So thank you again. They ensured the meal our little one was dairy free from start to finish, they had childrens items too on hand for the girls to keep occupied! Just brilliant. The room... Well what can i say again, robes for adults, robes for the kiddies!! Simply luxurious throughout, even one of the toddlers, who doesn't have many words yet said ""wow"" on checking into the room :). The leisure facilities were amazing. Just a purely perfect break. Recommend to anyone wanting to stay somewhere lovely with family.

Thank you druids Glen, we will definitely see you again soon!!",5,2018,12,11
238,Nice hotel ,"This is a nice hotel with lovely grounds. We had a nice welcome at reception.The bellboy was so nice and helpful and excellent with our kids. We had booked three rooms and one was a family room for 2 adults and 2 kids. This was a double and king, I though the kids would have their own beds. Housekeeping (Petra) was extremely helpful and sorted it for us, but just be mindful a family room is not that big. There is a nice kids play area indoors. We went to the pool and while it was great for kids, it was like being in a public pool not a 5 star hotel. It was jammed with kids, it must be open to the public. I only say this as if I was an adult with no kids I would have turned back. Having said that, there are designated kids swimming times.  There were family changing rooms which are great and the kids had bathrobes and sleepers which were a lovely touch. As there were kids with us, we had lunch and dinner in the Garden rooms. We pre booked and had the same terrible table both times just inside the door. At dinner we were jammed around people standing and drinking, we had gone down earlier in the day to ask to have another table for dinner but the waiter  and his manager had zero desire to help us.  She was not a nice person at all. Nothing 5 star at all.  Lunch was ok but we waited over 40 mins for it and the place was empty. Our waitress was so lovely, just extremely slow. Our experience in the Garden room would put me off going back.  Breakfast was good but they need to rethink the omelette and pancake counter. One girl who concentrated on omelettes only and I waited 10 mins for pancakes and gave up - all the while two empty pancake pans there. Could have easily multi tasked and asked if anyone was waiting for pancakes that could be cooked in parallel with the omelettes. We had a nice stay but this is not a 5 star hotel in terms of service and pool area (which has lots of broken chairs) ",3,2018,12,09
238,Druid’s Glen a little piece of  heaven !,"Just back from another fabulous couple of days in this gorgeous hotel. As always it surpasses all we could wish for from the wonderful staff at reception and porters, waiting and bar staff and management right through to the wide range of amenities ie spa golf etc. We were welcomed back by the very helpful staff at reception, brought to our room by the porter to then go down to the beautifully newly extended bar and garden rooms for some lunch. Our meal in Hugo’s restaurant on our first night was made all the more enjoyable by our wonderful waiter Alwyn who’s attention to my coeliac diet requirement was outstanding. the waiting staff in the bar and Garden Rioms looked after us so well and Irina as always stood out for us as she greeted us with a smile and warm welcome each time we came in.   Other senior staff like Bijoy were always on hand to make sure everything was ok during our stay.   The spa was a beautiful experience as always and it’s an added bonus to a break along with the golf. My husband could not compliment Conor and Niall in the golf shop enough for all the help and facilitating him. There is no question we will be back to Druid’s Glen again hopefully very soon it is one place we know We are guaranteed a real relaxing break with no worries and complete time out ! Thoroughly recommend it!!!",5,2018,12,08
238,Family night away wish we could have stayed longer,"Just back from a night in the hotel with out 7 month old. We're do I start, we had lunch on arrival and the staff set out a place for our little lad along with a high chair, a baby bowel of food was no issue, lunch was lovely. The room was very spacious and baby bed set and ready. We were advised of a baby room to heat up food and milk which was open 24hours that has a fridge,some food and sterlizers. On the 1st floor there was a 1st room for kids of all ages which was brilliant. We went for a swim before dinner. The man on the desk informed us of a family changing room in the pool area which was so handy. The facilities are top notch in the pool area, for adults who enjoy sauna etc there's a plunge pool which is artic cool. Did not get to use the gym on this occasion but it looks well kitted out. Dinner was lovely and the hotel lobby was very relaxing to enjoy a quiet beer after dinner. Rooms has decent sized flat screens with loads of channels. Rooms came with DVD players and at the front desk a dvd library. Breakfast was top quality. Overall the staff we encountered were very friendly and very helpful. We both wished we could stay on another night and will definitely return. For families we felt this hotel has gone the extra mile for make the stay very enjoyable.",5,2018,12,08
238,mid week getaway,"Returned from a mid week getaway with my wife, hotel is fantastic, pristine clean, amazing furnishings , exceptional food and great staff. Valarie on reception was extremely helpful and pleasant, the same can be said for all the staff in the Spa. ",5,2018,12,07
238,Nice getaway spot in a nice setting,Overnight stay was very relaxing g. Staff very friendly and professional.  Very helpful concierge whose name I should have noted. Very happy with the stay. Found out about the hotel via tg he Groupon app ,4,2018,12,04
238,Amazing ,"I’ve been to this hotel 4 times by now and I love it more every time . We had a suite this time which I highly recommend. We had the fire on , welcome treat.. you will find everything here : great service , luxury, amazing spa, amazing staff and the best restaurant ever , Hugo . The food there is divine and the atmosphere was welcoming and cozy. The staff are so attentive in special Luic , he made our night unforgettable with his knowledge about food and wine , with his welcoming attitude and with being so genuine and bubbly. Thanks Luic. Also I can’t forget Serena for the amazing facial , she is really good for treatments in the spa and she knows everything about skin and Serena will make sure that you get the right facial to suit your skin . The spa receptionist was very nice and friendly. I can’t recommend enough this hotel . Amazing stay every time .well done to the whole team . You are all amazing ",5,2018,12,04
238,A wonderful stay ,"Stayed here for my first time with my uncle for a quick pre Xmas overnight catch up as we both live at opposite ends of the country.

I have to say from even before we arrived at the hotel the service was excellent as they helped via email in terms of getting transport to hotel and were very patient with questions. 

Once checked in the service was excellent and the little touches really enhanced the experience warm towels at check in desk, the offer of bringing luggage to room the fact the bartender when we opted to go off script and have a cocktail not on menu which he did wonderfully and actually was glad as it added another new drink to his knowledge pool.

All across the board service was excellent, the room was great also very relaxing beds were very comfortable and encouraged you to chill out and facilities great walk in shower and bath, fridge,etc

Rather than doing the walking trail the concerige brought us to the country house and main golf club 

Even checking out staff were excellent gave us bottled water for the road and then because every taxi company was booked the concerirge brought us to  train station

All in all a wonderful experience from start to finish if onky I had more time to take in leisure and spa facilities maybe next time 
",5,2018,12,01
238,Nice place and location,We stayed at this lovely hotel two nights and ate dinner in the bar/restaurant both nights as well. The rooms were very comfortable and staff very helpful and accommodating. I would definitely stay here again! It’s proximity to all things Wicklow was great!,5,2018,11,27
238,Thanksgiving night away,"Just back from a super night away with my hubby Druids Glen really lived up to my high expectations. On arrival we were offered a lovely hot glass of mulled cider which was delicious check in was quick and easy . Our room was spacious with a lovely view of the golf course, bathroom was nice but shower was quite small and lighting not suitable for putting on my makeup.
We had made dinner reservations in Hugo’s restaurant v friendly staff . Had paid for a set menu but choose a la carte as the choice was much better in my opinion just had to pay the difference which wasn’t to much 
After dinner we had a few super espresso martinis in the bar great bar man he really knew his whiskeys  
Breakfast possibly had one of the biggest variety of foods I have ever seen anything you wanted they had. Overall had a great night away would recommend and will be returning in the new year .",4,2018,11,27
238,Amazing place!,"The hotel is very nice! The rooms are very spacious, beds are very comfortable. Staff is always attentive and friendly, food is great. SPA is amazing, wide choice of treatments, amazing relaxation room in SPA. Going to this hotel several times a year and highly recommend it to everybody.",5,2018,11,27
238,Total disgrace,"My experience of the Druids Glen was not a pleasant one. I booked this hotel as a gift for my parents. We had a family funeral and needed to change the date of the reservation. We rang on Thursday to try and change the date, my parents were due to check in on Saturday. They would not allow us to change the date and proceeded to tell us that they would be charging us the full amount. 
I have never experienced anything like this before and thought that it was an absolute disgrace, totally inconsiderate. ",1,2018,11,26
238,A hundred thousand welcomes,"A beautiful location within an hour of Dublin but in the beauty of Co. Wicklow. Fantastic walks, beach or parkland are a short distance away. Leisure Amenities are top class and well worth a visit or while an hour away reading in the various bar and lounge areas. Definitely coming back particularly for the wonderful welcoming smiling staff. Thank you.

Oh. . . . And there's a world class golf course literally on the doorstep. I'll have to try that next time instead of just walking it!",5,2018,11,24
238,Girls night away for Christmas,"Rooms were amazing, facilities were fab, staff were 5* the wine list was very varied so lots of options. There was nothing that I could fault. There was nothing that was too much effort for the staff.",5,2018,11,23
238,Fantastic stay!!,"We recently spent a night at Druids Glen to celebrate a special wedding anniversary.We were given an amazing upgrade to our accommodation and were made to feel special from start to finish.The Presidential Suite is a real treat, something really special.On a number of occasions over our stay we were congratulated by staff, so really personal touch to ensure they knew we were celebrating.Lovely waitress in The Garden Rooms,food delicious and a special message designed on our desserts which was a lovely touch.
Facilities are excellent, and although hotel was busy we were always quickly dealt with by warm friendly staff.We'll definitely be returning again.",5,2018,11,21
238,Amazing stay - would highly recommend!!,"I had a great stay recently as part of a conference group and can't wait to return personally! Great food in the bar, extremely helpful staff from reception to bar and fitness team, plus great spa / fitness facilities. Would highly recommend staying here!",5,2018,11,20
238,Fantastic hotel for families ,"Fantastic hotel for families from the games room to playground to swimming pool and fairy walk, we had a great time with our 3 year old. She especially loved the child robes and slippers for her in the wardrobe, very sweet. The games room is even better for older kids (7-12) who are harder to entertain. Hard to fault the hotel on anything.",5,2018,11,19
238,Wouldn’t rush back ,We stayed here for 1 night for a short break !  Staff in bar and restaurant area very scattered and un attentive for the stars they say they have you would wonder !! Menu in bar basic frozen chips a bit of a joke for 5 star hotel the price for food and drink is not worth it !! Could stay in Dublin City pay less and receive better service !!!,2,2018,11,19
238,Perfect break,We had the best short break ever. The hotel is stylish and the staff exceptionally welcoming and helpful. We were upgraded to a fabulous suite which was both a surprise and a delight. The food was fantastic and the service second to none. We had a fantastic weekend and really cannot wait to go back.,5,2018,11,14
238,A Family Hotel,"We stayed in the hotel over the second week of November and while we enjoyed our stay, I don’t think we will be in a rush back. The hotel is beautiful, modern and deserving of its 5 star status in appearance.  Both the bar food and the restaurant were equally impressive, and the staff were pleasant and efficient at all times. I understand the hotel has to cater to its younger residents ( it is very popular for families) but if it is a relaxing break you want this might not be the right place. Children were running through the reception area, through the halls and up and down stairs completely unsupervised at many stages during our stay. In the morning children can be heard in the halls from 8am onwards. Maybe we were just unlucky in the week we were there, but I advise to avoid rooms on floor one (located besode the kids club) if a quiet stay is wanted.  Druids Glen is a beautiful hotel and resort and I would 100% recommend it for families, but not couples in need of a relaxing break.",3,2018,11,13
238,A brief escape ,"Our brief stay at Druid’s Glen exceeded my expectations. It’s difficult to select one highlight, but the exceptionally friendly staff and excellent food were two factors which contributed to our experience. Wish I could have a bowl of their seafood chowder right now!",5,2018,11,12
238,Fantastic!,"Cannot wait to return here. Booked it as a surprise mini honeymoon for me and my husband and didnt want to leave. Ordered room service, very efficiant and delicious food. Stunning rooms, plus great staff!",5,2018,11,12
238,Mrs,"Druids Glen is beautiful. We were greeted firstly at check-in by professional, courteous staff. Our room (343) with Mountain view perfect, sumptuous  luxurious beds!! Room is spotlessly clean. Our first evening meal in the Garden View Room was delightful, staff so friendly , happy to have a chat really welcoming. Breakfast is abundant we were greeted by a lovely lady directing us to the wonderful choices on offer. We are still here and I do not want to leave. A magical spot!! P’s the complimentary Prosseccco was a generous touch as was the Happy Birthday acknowledgement for my husband. We will be back again. Do not hesitate to come and stay here.",5,2018,11,12
238,Tranquil of relaxation,"This is a tranquil of relaxation with brilliant staff who make you feel at home from the minute you arrive, the food is as you would expect just perfect, breakfast is a treat with relaxation the theme that sets the mood for the day ahead.",5,2018,11,12
238,Wish we could have stayed longer!,"Beautiful resort, excellent service - drinks at the bar were top notch. Room service food some of the best I have ever eaten. I ordered their Seafood Chowder & OMG it was heavenly. The room was beautiful as well as the lobby and surrounding grounds. We did not have time to try out the golf course but it was a convenient drive to Dublin to catch our flight back to the US.",5,2018,11,11
238,Excellent Family Stay,"Another excellent family stay in Druids Glen Hotel. Plenty for the kids to do with the games room, swimming & of course having fun on the driving range, even in the rain as it is covered! Never disappoints. We will be back! ",5,2018,11,11
238,A relaxing break,The ideal place to have a few days away in great surroundings with friendly and attentive staff looking after your every need. Food and accomodation excellent. A good base from which to explore Ireland's east coast.,5,2018,11,10
238,Half Term Treat,"Family friendly, kids treated like kings, food was great, attentative staff, love the recent makeover. Kids high tea a fabulous way for parents to enjoy some time on their own & my son thoroughly enjoyed it. Definitely coming back!

",5,2018,11,10
238,Lovely hotel,"This hotel is very good on a number of levels. The customer service is excellent. The rooms are beautiful and the pool area also great. Our kids enjoyed the playroom, however not as well stocked as some other hotel playrooms we have visited. They reason I didn’t give the 5th dot was the restaurant facilities. We were staying 3 nights with young kids. So ate each night in the garden rooms. The menu is quite limited and if I were to stay another night, I’m not sure what I would have eaten. Also, the seating is not great. If your lucky enough to get a table, great. If not your sitting having your meal in ‘bar seating’. The food we got was generally good. One night my husbands pizza was very overdone. In a hotel this size I would have expected more choice. For the price you expect very high quality. It’s very expensive. 
In comparison the breakfast is fantastic and one of the best setups I’ve experienced. Everything so fresh and constantly replenished so nothing ever empty at any time you go. We loved that meal each morning! ",4,2018,11,09
238,What a wonderful stay!,"The whole team made our stay truly wonderful. 
Myself, my sister, my mother and grandmother went for a treat for my Nana's 80th birthday. 
We enjoyed afternoon tea, outstanding. And also had dinner in the garden rooms, they surprised my nana with a celebratory dessert plate.

Thank you!",5,2018,11,06
238,30th wedding anniversary ,"Treated to an overnight stay by our children for our 30th wedding anniversary, loved this place and couldn’t fault it-beautiful setting and hotel superb, food excellent and thoroughly enjoyed the relaxing stay. Recommend the hotel and easy enough to get to, can take major roads but if you wish to do the minor roads -great scenery. Will be back again.",5,2018,11,05
238,Super half term break,"We stayed for two nights during half term and it was perfect for families. The kids enjoyed all of the activities for Halloween as well as the driving range, swimming pool, kids high tea and the Druids den. The staff were all very friendly and welcoming and apart from slow service in Hugo’s restaurant on the first night of our stay, the rest was great. The kids robes, slippers and toiletries in the room were a really nice touch. Great selection at breakfast. The surrounding area is beautiful and a visit to Powerscourt House and Gardens is a must. Overall great trip- 10/10 from the kids. We will be back! ",5,2018,11,02
238,Lovely stay..,"Stayed for 2 nights, lovely hotel with really good food. Room was spacious and a very comfy bed. Bathroom a bit basic and underwhelming for a 5 star.  Staff were pleasant. The only downside was the noisy children running the corridors at 8 am in the morning and running riot in the bar at night! Best avoided during school holidays as it seems popular for families. Overall a very pleasant stay.",4,2018,11,01
238,"Two nights, no kids, no dogs, no work........JUST PURE RELAXATION.","Met on arrival by smiling faces, checkin was a breeze and the level of service was excellent. 
Luggage was delivered to the room and we were guided through all facilities in the room by a gentleman who loved meeting people and made us feel welcomed and at home. Lovely dinner in the hotels restaurant and very attentive staff.
Good breakfast followed by a two mile walk to the golf club, another coffee and a return walk though hedged walkways and a beautiful Autumnal sunny day.
Half abhor to ready ourselves for the Spa Treatment. I had reflexology and I am still benefiting from the expertise, gentleness and knowledgable hands of my reflexologist. A wonderful stay. P.S. There is no shortage of bottled water, always available in room, hallway and reception.",5,2018,10,31
238,"Rooms adequate, not luxurious",Off the beaten path if you have business.  The rooms are fine.  Not luxurious.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  The breakfast was fine as was the dinner restaurant.  The bar was hopping till midnight on a Sunday night...,4,2018,10,29
238,Geared towards families...not 5 star luxury.,"My husband and I stayed here for one night over the Bank holiday weekend. It was meant to be a relaxing luxury getaway but I'm sad to say the hotel failed on that front. 
This isn't 5 star as you'd expect.Very much geared towards families and young children. 
On arrival, around 4pm, we decided to have a drink in the bar, it was quiet initially and then filled with children who were running in and out. We left and headed up to our room. Rooms are very comfortable,well maintained and spacious. 
After a stroll around outside, we got ready for dinner. We had a 'table' reserved in the garden bar for dinner. The table was laughable, a tiny 2 seater pushed up against the back of a couch were another couple were sprawled out. We're not tall by any means but, we knocked our knees off the table several times. I asked our waiter if we could move to a better table if one became available but we were told that the others weren't any better. 
Food was good, we both had steak and it was cooked as ordered. The atmosphere wasn't great and it seemed alot of people were unhappy with the seating arrangement - pic posted of the layout. Lots of couches which made the room look like a furniture showroom. Overall, we were disappointed with the dinner setting.It was very uncomfortable and again, we had the misfortune of being seated near a large family gathering with children running around and pulling out of seats. My husband did note that the only thing that saved dinner for him was the lady playing piano next door, she was exceptional. Breakfast the next morning was good. Plenty of choice however, there was a long wait at the pancake station and I felt the lady working at the station was overstretched.
To sum it up, this isn't the usual 5 star experience you get from other hotels in Ireland, I've experienced far superior 4 stars in fact. 
I wouldn't recommend to couples but fine for families.",3,2018,10,29
238,A must to stay at,This hotel was the perfect place to stay for our last night in Ireland.  It was over the top for service and cuisine.  Wish we could have stayed a few more days.  It was out in the countryside as it is also a world class golf course.  They met you at the desk with warm damp wash clothes which were scented with lavender.  They were right their to take our luggage to our rooms.  They have two dinning rooms one more formal than the other.  The breakfast buffet had everything you could ask for from smoothies to honey in a honey comb.  You don't see that very often.,5,2018,10,28
238,Short but sweet. ,"We had a very pleasant one night here but would like to have stayed a little longer, particularly since it looks like there’s some lovely walks around the hotel. Our room was extremely comfortable, the bed especially so. Breakfast was excellent, we loved the freshly made omelettes. Stars of the show however are the staff...extremely friendly and helpful. Thank you to Savir, our breakfast server with his lovely smile!",5,2018,10,28
238,Short stay ,Just home after great stay ..my daughter and baby grand daughter and myself had another wonderful stay made welcome by all..hotel is wonderful and new extension is great..it is a 5 star but i would give it more for staff who make it a special treat..rooms are spotless..thanks to jane for sorting our room for us ..see u all soon ..thanks again..from Brenda .claire and baby Annie ,5,2018,10,26
238,Heavenly hotel!,"Quite possibly one of my favourite hotels to stay in and I travel a lot!

I stayed here back in June with my boyfriend as a surprise treat before I underwent some surgery on my leg and the hotel staff were amazing.

I remember entering our room to be welcomed with a lovely note and some complimentary chocolates – it was the nicest touch!

Another amazing feature about this hotel is their breakfast. GORGEOUS! My boyfriend requested his food to be gluten free as he is a coeliac and the chef’s catered excellently for this!

Love this hotel and cannot wait to return!",5,2018,10,26
238,"Nice hotel, great food.. ","We stayed in the Druid’s Glenn hotel for one night, hotel it’s self is very nice and rooms are fab! Food and drink were very pricey for what it was, we were still hungry after our meals but it was a lovely meal. The staff were very friendly and attentive. I found the spa and the pool area very average compared to other 5 star hotels I have stayed in. Hotel was very clean. ",4,2018,10,26
238,Nice clean large rooms and close to town,"we stayed here two nights on the tail end of our Ireland trip. 

pros: the rooms are very clean. bathroom is nice size. beautiful mountain views. close to town w/ lovely restaurants (be sure to make reservations though!!). nice amenities. ample parking. kids playroom on site.

cons: no converters or usb ports. hair dryer attached to wall. shower the size of a phone booth. overcrowded bar/restaurants. lots of golfers on site w/ friends in lobby. louder lobby. unfriendly/unhelpful front desk staff. high surcharges on room service. 5miles off the beaten path.",4,2018,10,25
238,Our couples haven,"The most beautiful relaxing atmosphere, our time spent here is special, from the staff to the food and everything else in this hotel is above and beyond, absolutely beautiful. There’s is not one thing at fault in this beautiful Hotel, it’s amazing",5,2018,10,24
238,Not a five star,"This was our fifth of five stays while touring Ireland, and it was our least favorite.  There are numerous non-Irish people working here.  The female receptionist, who was Middle Eastern, was the least friendly person we encountered on our journey.  However, the Irish folks were lovely.  

The sports bar had both great food and service.  

We had to leave for the airport at 2:30 am and was told there would be a cappuccino and coffee waiting for us.  Alas, that never happened.

Sorry sendoff from such a magnificent country.
",3,2018,10,24
238,Beautiful hotel for Afternoon Tea ,"Had Afternoon Tea with a friend. Lovely hotel with picturesque views. Good service, staff very attentive and friendly. Afternoon tea was delicious, sandwiches very different and nice. Buttermilk scones to die for, loved the lemon curd served with the scones . Apple and cinnamon cake gorgeous. Selection of sweets very tasty. Good selection of teas and coffees. Very good value for money. Afternoon tea is served in a beautiful room that is lovely and bright with lovely views. Definitely a place I will visit again. ",5,2018,10,22
238,LOVELY STAFF. GREAT FOOD. GOOD HOTEL FOR GOLF...,"Spent 2 nights here and the breakfast was great! Cold buffet was lovely. SAVIO was professional and friendly at the same time-a great waiter. The second morning there were not as many staff on duty and we waited nearly five minutes at the omelette area for a chef to show. SHELLEY was lovely when we phoned and made us very welcome.  MARIO was excellent keeping our room clean and a lovely gentleman. ERIC cooks the best Fish'n'Chips and the chowder fills you up, so avoid a main course afterwards!  
The leisure centre was well maintained, altho' the jacuzzi has a sign saying '15mins on, 5mins rest'- ignore this! I waited 25mins for it to come back on, asked a lovely lady sweeping the water away and she told me there is a (grey) switch above the emergency stop that turns it on for you!.  There is a walk around the gardens that is quite pleasant, tho' once you've done it, there's not much else except play golf...if you played golf! We were told the course is very good, so we surmise it is more a Golfer's Paradise than Two Ol' Geezers away for a break. ENJOY!",4,2018,10,18
238,Wonderful break away in Druids Glen.,"We arrived on Sunday and were treated like VIP's from the moment we arrived. Amazing staff were so helpful. The Spa treatments were fantastic and made for a very relaxing afternoon being pampered and the bedroom was luxurious, we never wanted to leave. The garden room area was a wonderful area to kick back and relax over a glass of wine. We enjoyed our time there immensely and will return soon.",5,2018,10,18
238,5 STAR!!!,"Was here for a wedding, was spectacular. Such a beautiful setting, amazing food and such professional service. Have been to some amazing wedding venues and this has to be right up the top. Also had a second day BBQ which again was 5 star.

Can't fault Druids Glen from accomidation, food, service and general atmosphere all excellent.",5,2018,10,17
238,Special Occasion,"Firstly when we arrived to the hotel we were greeted by friendly staff on the reception desk. After checking in the woman behind the desk gave us some lovely lavender scented hand towels to refresh after our journey. When we got to our room we then realized that our room had be upgraded to a suite, it was amazing!! It was lovely and toasty warm as the little gas fire was lit and the Prosecco and Strawberries I had ordered were waiting upon our arrival. Also was a little personalized note from the manager to say they hoped we had a lovely stay for our anniversary. We had organized dinner and spa treatments also in our package and they exceeded every standard imagined. The staff here are a real credit to the hotel and made our stay very enjoyable. Breakfast was also amazing, something to suit every diet!",5,2018,10,17
238,Mr,This is a pleasant place to stay. Staff extremely friendly. However overall I would suggest 4* as really doesn’t measure up to other 5*’s about the country. If we played golf it may make a difference.,4,2018,10,17
238,Golf Break,"Just got back from a 4 day golfing holiday in Ireland and what a way to start.... Day 1 Druids Glen, without question the most stunning golf course I have ever played... every hole is beautifully framed, and as you walk to every tee box you have no idea what to expect next and are never disappointed. 
We played in heavy rain and some of the greens started to hold water but luckily the weather eased off and the course played beautifully. It’s a tough course (16 handicapper) with some blind shots so get a course guide/phone app.
Day 2 Druids Heath, although a lovely course it just doesn’t come close to the Glen, although again we played in heavy rain and it didn’t effect the course in any way. The greens are incredibly fast but in great condition for the time of year and again some great holes. 
If and when we return I would personally play the Glen twice but don’t let my opinion put you off the Heath
The hotel is fabulous, lovely food, friendly staff, nice spa, the most comfortable bed, satellite tv in room.. just perfect... 
If you are planning a golf trip to Ireland this is a must... 
Day 3 and 4 onto K Club :)",5,2018,10,16
238,What more can I say - yet another fabulous stay!,"We have been staying at Druids Glen now for a number of years for the last few nights of our annual holiday to Ireland and it never disappoints!  It is wonderful that so many of the staff have been there for a long time and now remember us and welcome us so warmly. It must say something about the hotel and the way it is managed that staff tend to stay!  Love the new Garden Rooms and Bar. We always ask for a room with a golf course view - so spacious and comfortable.  Everything was amazing as usual and so lovely to see everyone again - the staff at Druids Glen really make it! The weather was amazing whilst we were there. The only thing that marred our stay was that our our ferry was cancelled so we had to leave at 6.00 a.m. to catch the early ferry, Sad that we had to rush off, but we were provided with a little ""pack-up"" in lieu of breakast and the lovely Gita came to see us off!  Thanks everyone. We will be back!",5,2018,10,16
238,Excellent Resort Hotel with Golf,"We stayed here for three days while attending a nearby wedding.

Initial impressions were good with a very large and welcoming entrance hall / lounge.

The portioning and reception staff were very helpful and took us to our rooms to view them before unloading our luggage.

The bedrooms were very well-appointed and larger than usual.  Tea and coffee making facilities but no really good views, just a well-kept garden courtyard.   Nice bathrooms with separate shower and bath, and good selection of toiletries.

Very comfortable beds and good room cleaning and a turn-down service.

Nice public rooms with helpful service from all members of staff.

Lovely Golf Courses and well-signposted walks.",5,2018,10,16
238,A Perfect Pampering Treat,"Every staff member we encountered in every part of the hotel was just so friendly and helpful.  Our room was fantastic, well equipped, great size and very comfortable beds, with a gorgeous view of the grounds.  Loved having the robes and slippers to wear when going to use the spa and the pool.  Just really nice touches.  We left feeling very pampered.",5,2018,10,14
238,Definitely not a 5 star hotel ,"The outside of the hotel was not appealing and definitely not what I had expected. It had no special features outside and there was advertisement for KIA everywhere. Cheap car for an expensive hotel? The reception was lovely. The room had food stains on the carpet and an empty water bottle on the floor beside the window. The bed was comfy and a good size. The bathroom was very dated and the bath was tiny. Probably the worst bathroom I’ve seen in a hotel. The waitress in the bar got our food order wrong twice. For breakfast I asked a waitress for a boiled egg and beans, I waited 30 minutes and still no egg or beans so we left. I had a facial which was nice but the relaxation room was poor. I did not expect the swimming pool to be full of locals. There were swimming lessons on while we were there so we felt uncomfortable in the pool. A 5 star hotel shouldn’t have their leisure facilities open to people who are not staying in the hotel. Definitely not a place for couples. Overrated and disappointed. ",2,2018,10,13
238,Great staff and service ,"Co Terence with an overnight stay.
Professional staff who when they say your more than welcome make you feel that it is true.
Great entree and excellent main course followed by a classic desert.
Bar is open  late so everyone happy.
Will be back",5,2018,10,13
238,Superb,"Hot towels with lavender on arrival at reception, so refreshing. Very efficient and friendly staff here. Room absolutely perfect, with shower and bath. Welcoming chocolate surprise in room, nice touch. Very nice bed and pillows. Beautiful view over glen from room, hated to leave it. Lovely areas to sit and relax or have lunch. Must return to spend more time there. Staff were so friendly and welcoming to us, well done. ",5,2018,10,11
238,Enjoyable stay,Have stayed here a few times with kids and without. It is a great location for both kinds of stay. The food is excellent with great choice in both the bar and the restaurant. The breakfast is fantastic. Rooms are nice and comfortable with great showers. The leisure is lovely and clean. Haven’t got to the spa yet...bathe facilities for kids are brilliant. Will definitely return,4,2018,10,11
238,Very nice two-day stay with family.,"Nice rooms with very comfortable beds. As I booked with children, was chuffed to find two child-sized bathrobes in the wardrobe - that's a first. There was a very nice casual dining/bar area with comfy chairs; and the breakfast buffet was very varied. One of the staff (bizaarely) gave aus a tour of the buffet. Good pool, very good facilities. Definitely would return.",5,2018,10,11
238,Country Elegance,"After a long international flight I wasn't sure I wanted to make the drive to Wicklow but I'm so glad we did.  We went for a long walk around the beautiful grounds to the golf course, had a drink before dinner and a nightcap after dinner at the pub, then had a great night's sleep in the luxurious room.  The staff, the location and the accommodations make for a wonderful resort worth the drive.",5,2018,10,10
238,Not great...,"I brought my mum for afternoon tea here recently after we went shopping for my wedding dress and we both came away so disappointed. Firstly, my mum found a long, black, curly hair in her smoked salmon which was quite offputting. We told our server and a guy from management came over to apologise and indicated a fresh plate would be brought out. I presumed he meant a fresh plate of savoury food but they just brought another 4 smoked salmon sandwiches which was the last thing either of us wanted. When we were eventually finished and wanted to pay, we sat waiting for almost a half an hour for someone to come back to us, in the end I had to walk around the restaurant to flag down a member of staff. I had already paid for the tea online and only owed for two glasses of prosecco. I was then handed a bill for over €90!!!! Again, I had to go and find someone to point this out to. They then proceeded to check on the computer as to whether I had actually paid. Eventually, they printed a bill for the prosecco, which to be honest I felt they could have provided complimentary given the fact that the savoury course was essentially ruined. Customer service is lacking and in my opinion there are far nicer places for afternoon tea at a similar price.",2,2018,10,10
238,First class resort,"From the first impression to the last I was impressed! 
Beautiful grounds and entrance to the hotel, stunning views from the top of the hill towards the Irish Sea. 
Great golf courses and facilities.
First class rooms with plenty of space and facilities.
On checking out they even gave you a bottle of water for your journey, nice touch! Would love to return.",5,2018,10,08
238,Mid week break ,"We are a couple with a baby and took a midweek break at Druids glen. First impressions are that the grounds are beautiful and the reception area is very nicely decorated as was the bar and garden restaurant and bar. Beautiful views and overall very cozy and welcoming. Door man was very friendly and helpful. Check in was quick and staff pleasant. Room 246 was average but comfy. The bathroom really lets it down. It is old fashioned and there was a bit of a smell of urine around the toilet area. Shower was old style with old tray. Nothing luxurious about it. The bed was comfortable. Our room did not have any kind of a decent view , we could see car park and could over hear full conversations of people outside and hear golf buggies also in the morning which disturbed our sleep. 

Afternoon tea in the bar was pleasant and staff were very attentive. Everything nicely presented. Staff could not do enough for us. 

Dinner in garden rooms bar was average, not very exciting or tasty but again staff were very attentive and pleasant. 

Breakfast was also very bland in taste, overall food was very average and did not excite us at all. Presentation of food was good and again staff were excellent. 

The walking trail is very nice to have but it could be handy if this was a loop walk. Overall it’s a good hotel for families with great facilities for babies and children. The hotel reception area is lovely to sit and have a drink by the fire. 

Overall we would consider returning for location and the child friendly factor. ",3,2018,10,07
238,Wonderful stay,"My family and I stayed one night here and wished we had longer! The rooms were very clean, beds so comfortable, and the kids enjoyed the pool! Breakfast was incredible and the staff was amazing! Worth noting is if you have children and want to use the pool, pay attention to the hours. The only downfall were the limited hours the pool was available to families with children. You’ll also need to purchase a swim cap before swimming. Such a nice place and we hope to come back one day!",5,2018,10,07
238,"Great staff, beautiful surroundings, pity about the bar food","My wife and I stayed with my two small boys for three nights. Druids Glen is brilliant for kids, we had a small kitchen near our room which had nappies, wipes, a sterilizer and bottle washing facilities which is a great facility for families.
The grounds are beautiful and the kids enjoyed the trails as well as the great playground. Every staff member we encountered were superb. We ate in Hugo’s on one of the nights which had lovely food and excellent service. We ate in the clubhouse another night which was very good and, again, staff were great. The only disappointment was the food in the Garden Rooms bar, which, despite the comfortable surroundings and (again) excellent staff, was badly let down by the bland food. We had buffalo wings to start which were decent chicken wings that may have once been acquainted with some buffalo sauce, but it was difficult to see or taste any sauce at all. My wife’s fish and chips contained inedible rubbery fish (which, to be fair, they left off the bill when we said it to them). My burger, the same burger which is proudly displayed on all of the posters for the Garden Rooms bar, had to be endured rather than enjoyed, tasting of nothing in particular housed in a toasted brioche bun with the texture of old toast. 

Overall though we had a great time, and if the bar food was in any way decent it would definitely be a five star review.",4,2018,10,04
238,100% perfect,"I do it easy, all and everything deserve top score; Staff, service, food(both breakfast, lunch and dinner), the bar, rooms(the bed was like heaven), cleaning, interior, lobby, location, golf courses, just amazing!! I will be back.",5,2018,10,04
238,Special Birthday,"Stayed at Druids Glen Hotel recently, had a lovely experience, very relaxed.. Excellent service and great facilities, including the leisure centre. Unfortunately I didn't get to try the health Spa.  Staff very friendly and efficient from start to finish. Breakfast buffet was lovely and so was the food in the restaurant. There is a nice walk from hotel to Club house and loads to do and see in the area. Thanks to the staff for the special touch with the card, chocolates etc, much appreciated.  Hope to visit again soon.",5,2018,10,03
238,Child friendly,"Stayed here with my 3 & 14 year olds recently for a family gathering. Perfect for both ages. Beautiful walks in the garden even found a fairy door. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful, I felt totally relaxed, food was superb also. Looking forward to my next visit.",5,2018,10,03
238,Awsome golf vacation,Excelent service and great facilities. The room was nice with an extra plus to the spacious bathroom. Breakfast buffet was exelent with a special chef for pancaces and eggdish. Played Both golf Courses. Druids glen was among the nicest Courses that i have attended. It felt like playing golf in an lord of the rings World. Well worth a visit. I will come back with a smile on my face.,5,2018,10,02
238,Wedding day,"Amazing and professional from start to finish. Many visitors from abroad totally amazed at the Irish hospitality, top class service and loved everything , especially the beds! Oh my word, sleep the sleep of life, so incredible. Thanks staff in Druid Glen Hotel Rrsorr especially Neassa, Supreme Wedding Co ordinator par excellence",5,2018,09,28
238,Wedding Stay,"I chose Druids Glen as the hotel to recommend all my guests stay at the days surrounding my wedding. I am from the US so I had a large number of travelling guests. I couldn't have been happier with this decision! Not only did all my guests love it here, it was the perfect place for me to stay the days leading up to and after my wedding. It felt like home and was so comfortable and accommodating in every way! All the staff we met were so welcoming and friendly and genuinely invested in making sure they made your stay perfect. Can't wait to go back for my anniversary!",5,2018,09,28
238,An INCREDIBLE Luxury Hideen Irish Gem,"I visited recently for work on a scoping trip, and was bowled over by the service offered from the moment I arrived. The staff are some of the friendliest you will find in 5 star luxury hotels. The check in experience was super friendly and I instantly was made to feel welcome. I stayed in an executive suite, the room was very generous in space with a separate lounge living area, walk in closet and 2 w/c’s. The amenities in the room are super luxurious and replenished daily. The breakfast room is VERY generous with one of the widest selections of offering ive seen in a long time. Porridge through to pancakes. I ate in the bar and was impressed with the bar food menu and selection of beers. The spa is really well finished, great size pool, hot tub and steam/sauna. The hotel has some incredible views over Wicklow and the walking route is a must. I cant wait to come back for work and pleasure.",5,2018,09,28
238,Didn’t want to leave! ,"A two night stay in which I only wished lasted a bit longer. The family and I visited Druids Glen during the later part of August, just before school started. Our first impressions were good. Our room was of good size but did need some attention I.e the wooden desks were discolored due to the sun and were peeling as a result of water damage. Our room was also facing inwards towards the hotel so we were lacking any ‘Mountain View’s’. Aside from this everything was perfect. The facilities are second to none and they have a host of places for children to keep them occupied. We only had the chance to dine in the bar, but that was enough for us as it was delicious! I must say the staff are the real gems here! From Irena in the bar, a lady who knows her stuff and is extremely efficient!,Edel at front desk where nothing is ever a problem and her uplifting personality is infectious, to Mark in breakfast an energetic and welcoming character whos smile would brighten your day. Overall a very memorable stay, this was our first time at Druids Glen, but it most definitely will not be our last. ",4,2018,09,24
238,Bedding from Heaven,"Had a lovely stay at Druid's Glen. Food was fantastic. Staff are friendly and very attentive. Room very nice. Hi-light for me was the super-comfortable bed. The grounds are fabulous, surrounded by trees.",5,2018,09,24
238,Birthday overnight stay,"Top class experience- my two daughters and myself booked a one night dine and stay package for my youngest daughter's 30 th birthday. From the professionalism of the staff, the very comfortable superior room with a view of the hills and Autumn forests, the excellent meal in Hugo's restaurant and the breakfast with  a myriad of choices-everything was perfect. We enjoyed the Health Club facilities and the girls enjoyed spa treatments.
A luxury hotel with highly professional staff but with a very relaxing vibe!",5,2018,09,24
238,Splendid,"Had a wonderful stay on saturday night,
we were stayed in room 235 beautiful room lovely views,
we dined in the new lounge/dining area off the bar lush to say the least , mind you you need to book a booth really as the lower tables are impractical to eat off so i recommend booking a booth we were mostly served by the delightful friendly Emma who is a very attentive waitress and she has such a warm smile for you, 
breakfast was again a delight its so nice not to have to join a que for toast unlike in other hotels Breda was our server for breakfast and nothing was an inconvenience for her she was so helpful when it came to serving us both Breda & Emma would encourage you to return alone,
overall the staff were impeccable great attention to detail even down to there well polished shoes, check in staff are very welcoming but i feel the check in desk could be longer or have check in desks  perhaps along the corridor to the right of check in, giving you a little more privacy when submitting your details, id like to see a precheck in option on the plan your trip email you receive approx one week prior to your stay,  Over All i gige this hotel a 9.5 out of 10 rating,",5,2018,09,24
238,Birthday Treat Visit 😁,"We stayed on a Thursday night, initially at check in the receptionist informed us that confirmed checkin was not until 4pm, we explained we had spa treatment booked in for 3pm and part of the luxury was going from our room to spa, she didn’t seem concerned and cut us short saying they had a wedding and we would just have to wait and see, but then immediately handed us our room key so making us feel hassled at checkin seemed unnecessary. 

Everything was on the up from there ! Our junior suite was fabulous, complimentary tea coffee, nespresso machine 😁, and l’octaine toiletries! 

We got into our robes and slippers and headed to the spa. I had an Elemis facial with Trish and it was sublime so relaxing and Trish was brilliant. My partner had his first ever massage and really enjoyed it and the relaxed atmosphere of the spa. The sorbet after your treatment is a lovely and welcome touch ! 

We had dinner in the bar and the food was amazing ! Staff couldn’t do enough for you in the bar really helpful.  Desserts a bit pricey at €8 /€9 for what you get but mains and starters were fabulous ! 

Breakfast the next morn was top notch !! Great choice and variety and very impressed with chef there ready to cook your eggs the way you like them or fresh pancakes and they were good !!! 

My only down point was the hotel itself was cold ! I was cold having dinner and breakfast and we had to blast the heating in our room, it took from the cosy feel.

That said, overall we had such a relaxing stay and we would certainly return. 

Also my boyfriend told them when booking it was my bday and they had dropped a bday card and little box of chocolates up to our room it was a lovely touch to acknowledge it.",5,2018,09,23
238,Would have given it 5 stars but the breakfast let it down,"Overall I enjoyed my stay at this hotel. The rooms were a good size and the bedding was very luxurious and soft. You were given a good selection of toiletries in the bathroom as well slippers and dressing gowns. The grounds of the hotel are kept impeccable and the staff are all friendly and helpful. The only real let down was the breakfast. I have had better breakfast in 3 star hotels, so I was a bit disappointed. The cooked breakfast did not have beans which are my favourite part and the scrambled egg tasted very dry. There was only one flavour of yoghurt and one flavour of jam available, and I expect there to be a larger variety in a 5 star hotel. Overall it was a nice stay but the breakfast was a bit of a let down ",4,2018,09,21
238,Wedding Anniversary,"We booked as a special treat for our second wedding anniversary and boy we were not disappointed. From the moment we checked in we were welcomed by such friendly staff to be shown to our very luxurious suite which I never wanted to leave. It was out of this world. We went for a six kilometer walk that was detailed in a map that was given to us at check in. The destination was the clubhouse where we had a drink on the rooftop bar over looking the beautiful  grounds. The highlight I have to say was the chicken stir fry noodle dish. It was just perfect. We booked treatments in the spa which were amazing and tailored to you as an individual. They were so professional yet super friendly. Needless to say I hope it won’t be long until we will be returning. 
Brid&James",5,2018,09,18
238,Family friendly hotel but still 5 star service and quality,We wanted a short break away with our 2 year old but still in luxury surroundings which was Druids Glen. Beautiful hotel with playroom and play park on site for  our baby. Really impressed and we'll be back! ,5,2018,09,17
238,Golden Wedding venue,"Fabulous place to celebrate our Golden Wedding anniversary - excellent service and food . Bedroom was outstanding - food was of a very high standard and the swimming pool, jucuzzi, steam room and sauna were perfect.",5,2018,09,17
238,Wedding at Druids Glen,"We had the best day ever for our wedding but not only that, My family and some friends stayed a whole 6 days and everyday was perfect, everything was ideal and we were looked after so outstandingly well.  We will definitely be back.",5,2018,09,17
238,Luxurious stay ,I cannot recommend this hotel enough. We had a fantastic stat.  Everything was perfect from start to finish.  The decor is amazing. Luxurious big sofas and a lovely fire wher you can lie back and relax and watch the world go by. The hotel has a lovely relaxing feel to it.  Service is brilliant too. The food in the garden bar was first class with waiter service. I didn't have to leave my seat. I can't wait to my next visit!,5,2018,09,17
238,Fantastic stay & the staff are excellent,"Stayed 2 nights for a family celebration and the staff were so nice to us. Jo & team made the occasion even better with a very thoughtful and kind gift. We are looking forward to returning again soon. Excellent staff, service, food, and facilities.",5,2018,09,16
238,Friendly staff,Stayed here for two nights. Staff couldn’t do enough and very friendly at all times. We had the evening set meal included in our package which had a limited menu so we opted to pay the supplement for the main a la carte menu. All food cooked nicely. The breakfast is fantastic with a great selection and loved the omelette and pancake station. Will definitely be back ,5,2018,09,12
238,First Night in Ireland,"The Druid's Glen is a Spa/Golf Resort that doesn't feel like a big resort. The service was friendly, helpful and excellent from all staff. The room was very comfortable and reasonably quiet. The food was good and the prices were reasonable. We fully enjoyed our first day and night in Ireland.",5,2018,09,09
238,Golf Society Outing,"First class golf course, a must for anyone visiting Dublin/Wicklow on a golf trip, the 12th is a par three signature hole, from on the grenn take a look back to the tee box. Fairways, tee boxes and greens were in top class condition",5,2018,09,08
238,False rate advertising on website. ,"Stayed one night for business and decided to stay an additional night for pleasure. Room rate advertised was “from €165” on specified dates. When I clicked continue cheapest rate was €265. When querying the hotel receptionist they failed to answer my queries as to why the website rate was falsely advertised and offered me a room at €265. 

Otherwise a pleasant stay and bar staff extremely friendly, hence the extended request to stay on the property. ",2,2018,09,08
238,Lovely hotel in beautiful setting.,"Our  suite was very comfortable and spotlessly clean. We had a great sleep and even though a wedding was being celebrated we didn't hear a thing. We were there to celebrate a family occasion (a birthday), and had lunch, evening meal and breakfast all of which were delightful. Excellent food, nothing too much trouble for any of the friendly and very helpful staff.  Well worth every penny. The best hotel in County Wicklow in our opinion.",5,2018,09,07
238,Amazing food,"I stayed here with friends for the weekend. There were four of us and we managed to book two rooms side by side with an adjoining door. We loved this. It made things much easier for us. 

We booked dinner in Hugos restaurant. it was one of the nicest meals I have eaten. We all thought the same. 

Breakfast the next morning had lots of options. Some healthy, some not to healthy. Arrive early so you have time to eat everything. You'll want to try it all. ",5,2018,09,06
238,Great Public course,"This can be a challenging course,  definitely a cart course due to some pretty long treks between holes in my opinion.   I like that you can open up with big clubs and long irons or fairway woods here.  The yardage is good and the approaches can be challenging but it is a fair course and at the end a great little pub.  Enjoy.    Nice range as well.",5,2018,09,06
238,Another Great Stay,"Back to the 'bubble of niceness' for another stay (my 6th!).  Once again the staff are really lovely, can't do enough for you.  Absolutely fabulous breakfasts, the update to the facilities of the garden room and reception are really lovely.    Yes it was a time when lots of kids are around (if i could take my hols outside of school hols time i would but there's lots of ways to avoid the kids so i do.. e.g. go to the pool after 6pm!).    We were staying for 9 days so the food choice does become limited in the bar but it is really good food.    There was a piano player on Sunday night and she was brilliant.  

The rooms are lovely and spacious, had a couple of minor issues (e.g. chair missing but sorted quickly by the lovely Edel on reception).  I think the rooms could probably do with an upgrade soon in order to match the gorgeous bar and reception, they are a bit tired in parts e.g completely cracked surface in bathroom, marks on wall paper etc.. this sounds picky but it is 5 star so I think i can be picky).  The tea making area is really cramped now due to the excellent addition of a Nespresso machine.  Personally i could do without the cushions and throw on the bed.. they look slightly 'tired' to me and a bit out of place/unhygienic as I'm sure the throws aren't washed for every new guest.   During the 9 days I don't think our room was hoovered at all (even when I specifically mentioned it to housekeeping).  

Overall this a lovely place to stay and the staff are wonderful and make you feel very welcome - I've been back many times and would thoroughly recommend it to anyone (if you've got kids go.. they love them!!).",4,2018,09,04
238,An absolute gem in Wicklow,"I can't sing this hotel enough praises. From the friendly staff, to the excellent food and facilities. It's also not far from Glendalough, powers court gardens, kilruddery house, Greystones, Bray and Dublin. Would stay here again 100%. ",5,2018,09,02
238,Book it. Don't think twice!!!,"The Druids Glen was always on our bucket list but between one thing and another (kids, life etc) we couldn't 'justify' spending the money on a stay. So when a good friend got it as a gift for our surprise wedding we were thrilled. So off we went on our 'honeymoon'(kids and all 😉) and all I can say is WOW. We had an amazing stay. An AMAZING stay. It is worth every penny. Our hotel room was fab with plenty of room. The little touches in the hotel room (little bathrobe and slippers for our 2yr old, special toiletries for him too), The Druids Den was something else too. Plenty for all ages to be entertained with. Breakfast was superb, with a chef even cooking fresh omlettes and pancakes as you wait. With out a shadow of a doubt the best thing about our stay though was the staff. They are an absolute credit to management there. Everyone was so happy and helpful all the time. One leisure centre staff member lifting our buggy up the stairs to our room, the gentleman in the morning at breakfast just making life more easy for us with our 2yr old and 3 month old. 5 out of 5 stars!!",5,2018,08,31
238,Wedding,"I attended a wedding here this weekend. The hotel and grounds are stunning, the wedding arrangements were amazing and the food and service were faultless. The bar were great and there was a beautiful ambiance in a beautiful setting. The rooms were spacious and extremely comfortable. I would highly recommend this gorgeous hotel.",5,2018,08,28
238,Delicious,"Got invited at this Resort  while on busines trip to Ireland. Fantastic food, nice staff. Atmosphere you enjoy eating in. The lamb I got must have been the best I ever tasted. This is a place Irecommend when in Ireland, Wicklow.",4,2018,08,28
238,"Staff attentive, hotel much ado about little","We attended a family wedding and other than the attentiveness and efficiency of the staff the hotel had little to recommend it. Guest Room was very hot, function room very noisy, dinner food mediocre, breakfast very ordinary, children everywhere.
Won't be back in a hurry",3,2018,08,27
238,Good but can be better....,"We visited friends in Greystones for a long weekend and booked ourselves at Druids Glen. It’s a good hotel but in my opinion can be better. 
The staff are great, the grounds fantastic, and the common areas nicely done up. The latter include the reception and the bar/ bistro/ terrace. 
Yet, I felt that the rooms (and carpeted corridors) need a good facelift. They are clean and comfy but the design and style is now slightly updated as compared to the common areas that I positively highlighted. 
",4,2018,08,27
238,5 Star stay ,"We stayed in Druids Glen in July we were totally blown away by this hotel, every part of the hotel had a little part of luxury, the food served in the restaurant was lovely with a very pleasant waiter he was a lovely man, our breakfast was the best ye have ever had in a hotel it’s the little things, or room had a gorgeous view and it was very comfortable, the check in experience was perfect and everything with did while at the hotel gym, pool, fairy walk, gold was all perfect. We really can not fault this hotel we will be back next summer, also the wild flowers all over were stunning and gave a really fun quirky feel to the hotel. ",5,2018,08,27
238,Total luxury ☆☆,"I came for a night with family and from the moment you enter the lobby it's luxury and 5☆treatment all the way .from the food, service, bedrooms,nothing is too much .I would highly recommend this hotel as it's perfect for couples,families,girls trips.",5,2018,08,27
238,"Very good, with a few caveats","We had a two night break here in June during the very warm, dry spell and found the experience pleasant. However, if you are not into golf you may find yourself at a little bit of a loose end for things to do as it is not located in the most scenic part of Ireland.

The hotel itself is a modern build and is maintained in good condition with pleasant public spaces. There was a very welcome ice-cream cart in the lobby which was doing good business during our stay selling locally sourced, well-priced ice-cream.

We ate in the main restaurant on our first night and in one of the public lounges on our second night. The food was generally good and service was friendly. The price of a bottle of craft beer at €7.80 was excessive though.

It was during the start of the school holidays when we stayed and unfortunately many parents seem to let their young children have free reign of the breakfast buffet - we saw a number of unsupervised children pick up food only to put it back down again - ugh!

The room we had was very spacious and comfortable and the air-conditioning worked fine. On our second night we were awoken at 3am by the fire alarm - apparently a guest activated a break-glass panel - can't fault the hotel for this. We were given an apology the next morning at check-out.

If you play golf this would be an ideal location for a getaway. We visited during the hot sunny days of June and were able to enjoy a walk at a nearby (stony) beach. We also did the forest walk to the nearby Druids Glen Golf Club where we enjoyed a pleasant lunch.

Just to note that the championship golf course/club is not located by the hotel but some distance away and has its own entrance from the road. The course by the hotel is Druids Heath which is not as prestigious as Druids Glen.",4,2018,08,25
238,Another 5* stay,"It’s the third year running (possibly the fourth!) that we’ve had a child-free night at the Druids Glen before heading to stay with family in Wexford. And it’s been another 5* stay. 

We were upgraded to the most amazing Suite (room 126) overlooking the golf course, and even had a box of chocolates delivered to our room as a thank you for returning. 

The service here just blows me away... every single member of staff is friendly and helpful. We had an issue in our room when the hairdryer blew a fuse and knocked out some of the power in our room. The maintenance staff sorted it out within minutes of us making the call to Reception to report it. 

Dinner in Hugo’s was as romantic as ever, and the food was delicious. 

Despite the hotel being full of families at this time of the year, they do a great job of keeping couples here happy too. 

I can’t wait to return again next year! ",5,2018,08,24
238,Luxury hotel break,"We are three adults who stayed on the third floor in the family room and it was bright ,clean and spacious.The entire hotel team gave outstanding service,from hot towels at check in,to a pleasant young man who quickly replaced our broken kettle,to attentive restaurant staff at Hugos,helpful breakfast staff with an extensive selection of hot and cold food,my sister loved the fresh smoothies.The breakfast room greeter kindly offered to have my mother's breakfast sent to her room,she has mobility issues,and took an order for a lovely cooked breakfast which my mother loved.My sister and I really enjoyed the children free swimming session with the pool having a lovely warm temperature .The changing rooms and shower area were lovely and clean with shower products.I really enjoyed the Spa,having a relaxing pedicure with the amazing Sabrina.My mother did find the modern bed ,which was high, hard to access.I would advise checking with hotel in advance if you have mobility issues.The check in staff did locate us nearer to a lift.",5,2018,08,23
238,Outstanding . Family friendly.  It's all the small things you don't get elsewhere. ..,"Myself, hubby and a 10 and 11 year old  arrived on the 21/08/2018 and stayed for two nights. Before we arrived I received two calls and an email offering help and advise around our stay. On arrival the hot towels offered at reception were very welcome as was the sparkling cucumber water. Booking in was swift and when we entered our room 325 we were not disappointed. A nespresso machine with pods and lovely shortcake biscuits which the kids devoured were all very welcome. The pillows and bedlinen are amazing as were the beds. Husband is a big man and he would have liked a firmer bed. The room was very spacious with a work station, a separate table and two arm chairs, and two king or double  size beds I'm not sure. The bathroom was also spacious and the products totally luxurious. Breakfast was fabulous. No. It was outstanding. The kids loved the smoothies as did we. There was fruit, toppings, yogurts, cereal, meats, cheese board, salmon, house baked breads of all descriptions, and of course the full irish. No mushrooms or beans.  Omelettes were made to order and pancakes available also. Each night there was a turn down service. Chocolates were left on our beds ...nice touch.  The kids did not want to leave. We paid 350 for our two nights with breakfast and two buckets of balls for the driving range.  TAKE NOTE We booked direct with the hotel online. No other sites offered breakfast included at thia price. Breakfast costs 15/20 euro. The pool area is fab. Gym was closed on Wednesday which really annoyed himself. Hope ye find this helpful. ",5,2018,08,23
238,Wonderful Stay! ,"We booked a last minute night away in Druids Glen. We were extremely impressed from start to finish. Hot towels on arrival and fruit infused water were only two of the little touches that really added to our stay. There is plenty to do there, from the lovely walking trail, to the driving range! We booked dinner in Hugo’s restaurant. The food was outstanding. The staff were extremely accommodating and friendly. They could not do enough for us! I dropped my phone in water and it had stopped working. I mentioned this to a staff member and within minutes he had sourced an air tight container which he had filled with rice for me. My phone was perfectly the next morning!

I would highly recommend this location for a night away! ",5,2018,08,23
238,Amen for Druids Glen,"It is not often I give a 5 rating but Druids Glen deserves it. I have stayed in many hotels throughout Ireland and abroad but rarely have I experienced such relaxed luxury in such a lovely setting. From check in you are treated like you are the most important guest and that they have been eagerly waiting your arrival. The rooms are.luxurious, the food is excellent and the setting is glorious. This hotel is well worth experiencing. I will definitely to go back.",5,2018,08,21
238,Excellent Service,"My wife and I recently stayed at Druids Glen for two nights and returned for a subsequent one night stay with friends and their two kids. My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay and we were all well looked after. I suffer from an immune disorder that significantly limits my diet and the kitchen kindly catered for my quite specific dietary needs without issue.

The staff in generally are very friendly and can't do enough for you.
My wife thoroughly enjoyed the buffet breakfast and particularly the home made pancakes!
Kids were generally well catered for with the walk track, dvds etc although a smaller kiddies swimming pool would have been nice.
Lovely hotel",5,2018,08,21
238,Couples night away,"Splashed out for a night away. Beautiful lobby, appreciated the fruit infused water on arrival. Warm welcome from receptionist. 

The room was large, bed very comfortable. Sadly we were near either an air con system or pool heating system or something that made a constant noise, even though i was wearing ear plugs, it disturbed my sleep. 

Fine dining experience was very nice, food and service were excellent, but the aircon was absolutely freezing, visibly blowing the drapes. I had to leave and go back to the room to change into warm clothes! Bring a sweater or sit away from the aircon. Its in a conservatory style room, and the staff have uniforms and I felt it would have been unfair to ask them to turn it off! Breakfast was very nice. Also we had to wait until late for a table for dinner so do book in advance.

We went to the pool at 5:30 and it was filled with screaming children. Which is fine, but not when youre getting a break from your own! They aren't allowed in the pool after 6pm so wait until then for peace! Unfortunately some people were using the sauna and sweating buckets and getting into the pool/jacuzzi without showering, a sign in the sauna might remind them to rinse off first! It's €3.50 for a swim hat.

Soon after we arrived we went to the bar for food. The only place to sit was a sofa and low table, not ideal for eating a meal, so we opted to sit on the deck. 3 young staff members served us. Or rather didnt serve us. We both ordered food, one of us got what we ordered within 10 mins and the other item arrived 40 mins later after we eventually had to ask the manager/supervisor about it. We asked for a drink, it never arrived. Younger staff members need re-training. Not major issues, but when you are expecting a good experience it was disappointing to get this type of service so soon after arriving. 

Unfortunately I don't think we will return, but we clearly just had an underwhelming experience, there are excellent staff members, lovely facilities and delicious food, so do try for yourself.",4,2018,08,21
238,Very enjoyable stay,"We spent one night in the hotel last week. After reading the previous reviews we were looking forward to the break away. We were not disappointed. The staff were very friendly (Liz at the reception desk made us feel very welcome when we arrived). Our room was spotless and had a nice view of the golf course.

The pool facilities were excellent (temperature of the pool was great too!). We ate in the Garden Rooms & Bar at night - food was good and reasonably priced. 

Breakfast the next morning was in Hugo's Restaurant. There was plenty of selection to suit all needs - omelettes and crepes made on demand.

The only slightly negative point would be the walking path around the estate. The first and last parts are scenic - the middle part is not very picturesque.  

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay though and would definitely stay again.",5,2018,08,20
238,Afternoon tea ,Came here last week for afternoon tea with family what a disappointment for a five star hotel it was served in a conservatory which had no atmosphere I was expecting a nice view all we saw outside was people smoking cause it was the smoking area smell kept coming in the door I got up about 4 times to close the door then got fed up the food was ok nothing special and at 30 euro a head I wouldn’t recommend it ,3,2018,08,20
238,You better be a golfer,"The hotel had recently enlarged the Bar/casual dining area and is now much larger. The expansion has worked out well and the area is nice and comfortable. The hotel rooms are as described and well looked after with a proper coffee/tea making facilities and the usual amenities befitting the hotel rating (except for the mini bar which was left totally empty...).

The hotel is in a nice area albeit in an isolated part of the countryside with almost nothing else other than golf and a swimming pool for adult activities. The food in both the bar area and the main restaurant was not up to the standards one would expect and worse, on checkout a few people (myself included) were disputing our bills (I got a partial refund of some restaurant bills which were double charged etc).",4,2018,08,20
238,Amazing Stay!,"We booked Druids Glen on the back of a family recommendation and we are glad that we did. 

Before travelling down I called to ask if we could use the facilities and not only was I told yes I was told all the information that we needed to know. I also explained that due to having recent foot surgery could we request a room close to the lift, again this was no hassle. 

Upon arriving we checked in and received a personal guide of what was on offer in the hotel, along with hot towels and colouring in for the kids. We then proceeded to go for a quick bite to eat which I thought was excellent value for money. Everyone thought the food was excellent. 

When we went into our room it was spacious with 2 queen size beds and a travel cot for our baby, Nespresso coffee machine and tea making facilities with fresh bottled water. Rooms are spotless as is the bathroom with a separate bath and shower. The kids even received their own prince wash packs. 

For food we ate in the bar and got seated in a both. Our meals consisted of burgers, pizza and cod which again was excellent and we could not fault portion size or quality, again we all thought it was very reasonably priced. 

I liked the way kids could pick a dvd to bring to the room and watch which are available at reception. 

Now onto breakfast, yes it is a self service breakfast but as I was on crutches I was asked by a member of staff would I like him to get it for me. We also had coffee,tea and toast brought to the table. The only criticism I could make was the table we sat at was under the air con and it was freezing but we didn’t mention it to the staff. 

When checking out we received ice cold water as it was a warm day and we then asked did we receive and upgrade as the room was lovely and yes we did! We joke as we had another party with us who received a discount voucher for future stay and they checked out the exact same time as us. 

This hotel is very family focused with games room, a spotless pool and an outdoor area. For what we paid from the room to food and drink I think it was reasonable and I would highly recommend it to anyone and have since our stay. 

I look forward to booking another stay in the very near future. ",5,2018,08,19
238,Afternoon tea,My mum sister and myself when for afternoon tea on Friday I can’t compliment the staff enough they were amazing especially Calma what a lovely helpful girl explained everything to us in great detail so polite the setting was fabulous food absolutely amazing we all enjoyed the experience so much will definitely be back all I can say is please go and try the afternoon tea you won’t be disappointed fantastic,5,2018,08,19
238,Lovely hotel but not 5 star,My family came here for an overnight stay n to play golf .Check in was fine girl was very nice n helpful .Room was lovely with tea making facilities bottled water safe n fridge .Food was disappointing in the bar salmon n pizza were ok trout was overcooked pork chop was lovely served with onions n roasted cherry tomatoes except tomatoes weren't roasted .Burgers were excellent .Desserts were nice .Breakfast had great selection but was shocked that 5 star hotel didn't serve cooked breakfast to the table.Golf was great n the men said it was the best course they have played .,4,2018,08,16
238,"Excellent 5 star service, highly recommend","I recently visited Druid’s Glen for a one night stay with my family. I found that the hotel had so many little extra special touches which really made it a standout experience from other hotels. My son was delighted to discover the child sized robe and slippers waiting for him upon arrival. They also provided beautiful kid’s bath products, very cute. The room was spacious, spotlessly clean and very comfortable. The hotel staff were exceptional at all times - I can honestly say that each and every single staff member we encountered was genuinely friendly, helpful and welcoming. The food was of really high quality, in particular the full Irish breakfast at the buffet was one of the best I’ve had at any hotel. We also enjoyed a lovely afternoon tea on arrival. On a nice day it’s also worth following the 3km walking trail, make sure to finish at the golf club house for lunch - the seafood chowder was delicious and they have a lovely menu in general. Again the staff there were very nice. The pool facilities are very good, we swam during the child-friendly family swim times, and the pool was quite busy as it was the height of the summer holidays in August. However it was very comfortable, well run and the lifeguards were very attentive. I didn’t use the spa or gym facilities. There is also a great indoor kid’s playroom (fuseball, air hockey and a retro arcade game were the personal favorites) and also an impressive little outdoor playground for the kids to enjoy. I’d highly recommend Druid’s Glen for both families and couples breaks. ",5,2018,08,13
238,"fantastic overnight stay, customer service fabulous","Myself and my daughter celebrated my birthday in style with a bed/breakfast and dinner stay in this fabulous hotel. We were welcomed by a very efficient team who reminded us of our welcome drink and wished me a happy birthday. The Leisure centre was very enjoyable and relaxing and the room truly beautiful. Our evening meal served beautiful food and was really enhanced by two superb waiting staff...Lila from Hungary and Alwyn from Portugal who really made the occasion truly memorable. Druids Glen, Hold on to these two gems.....We will be back and thank you",5,2018,08,13
238,Can’t wait to return!,What a stunning location for probably the most luxurious hotel I have stayed in. From the highly professional staff who go above an beyond to help to absolutely stunning rooms. There are several options for dining from a relaxed meal in the Garden Room to formal dining in Hugo’s. Really could not recommend more highly. Loved it and cannot wait to return.,5,2018,08,10
238,Fantastic 3 days,"Stayed here on the 3 day family package.

From start to finish it was brilliant. The staff are amazing. The hotel is relaxed amd spotlessly clean. The rooms are spacious. They have plenty of activities to keep everyone busy. 
The kids enjoyed the Kids High Tea Club which is 3 1/2 hour evening activity for kids which includes food amd activities. Well worth doing and gives the parents a few hours to relax.

Enjoy your trip if you go here ",5,2018,08,10
238,Not 5 and even not 4 stars!,"Hi,

I was very much disappointed!The chef is bad,bad food,the bed is such uncomfortable that we couldn’t sleep 4 days-no one star deserve!

The only good moment is golf course and our personal trainer Patrick!!!!!-5 Star!",2,2018,08,10
238,Top Notch!,"Enjoyed a fantastic couple of days in Druids Glen. Booked it as a treat for a special occasion and wasn't disappointed. Warm welcome, high standard throughout.   On our 1st evening we dined in the Garden Rooms bar. Food was good and service excellent. 
Our 2nd evening dinner was in Hugo's restaurant. Again excellent, however I thought the choice of Main Course dishes available was a bit restricted, but all in all it was awesome and I wouldn't hesitate to book another stay at Druids. ",5,2018,08,10
238,Outstanding Experience,"Had three nights in this wonderful Hotel.
It is in a beautiful location and is so spacious and well designed that you feel so relaxed by the ambience.
All the staff deserve full marks for their friendliness, attention to detail and courtesy.
 The food is excellent and the leisure facilities top notch.
Can't wait to go back",5,2018,08,09
238,Excellent staff.,"Myself and my friend spent a night here recently and due to unforeseen circumstances we were very late arriving for our one night stay. 
The staff at reception are by far the most professional and friendly people I have come across in any hotel. Adrienne was with us on arrival. 
We felt instantly looked after and although our stay was short we really enjoyed dinner and the scenery on our walk the next day.  
Will definitely be coming back to spend some more
time here. Thanks to all of the staff at Druids Glenn for making our short stay memorable.",4,2018,08,08
238,Really good hotel,Just about everything the whole place is really nice the restaurant the bars the rooms and the pool and the weather was just perfect for golf with the fairways and greens really well looked after.  We will definitely be back.,5,2018,08,07
238,Bank Holiday Lunch,"So we decided to give Druid’s Glen a second chance after our disastrous visit in April 2017 for an Easter Break. We are so eager to say nice things about this place as we really like the venue and the surrounding area. We where on the lookout for an upcoming Birthday venue for January 2019 for our entire family and this was one of the locations we had in mind. 

A year on and I’m sad to say it hasn’t got better myself my wife and two kids went for some lunch on bank holiday Monday just gone. 

We dined in the bar and from start to finish it was a let down. We asked for a high chair the waiter said of course sir I’ll bring it over, we never saw him or the chair again. We got water and I sent it back their was a dead fly on the ice cube. 

Then the food came the chicken wings where  rotten as you can see from my photo. 2 portions of chips where rock hard we sent both back. Soup arrived with no bread took about 10 minutes for it to arrive, we asked for butter too waiter said of course sir but we never saw him again either. Soup was cold at this stage. 

As you can see from our menu above it wasn’t fine dining food we ordered and any decent “5” Star location should be able to cook chicken wings and chips to perfection. 

Then we ordered desert Churros which are always crispy these ones where wet on the outside and uncooked raw pastry in the inside, we asked the waiter he said “that was custard” but I’m not convinced, my stomach was off for that entire night. 

It cost us 55 euro for lunch which is not cheap either, but it could be the last amount of money Druids Glen get from us. 

It’s such a pity as we really did like the atmosphere and location. ",1,2018,08,07
238,Never Disappoints,I've been to Druids Glen on an annual basis for many years. The golf course is a marvellous test for low and high handicappers. It is always presented in pristine condition and the catering in the clubhouse is always on par.,4,2018,08,07
238,Superb hotel qwith excellent staff,"We just returned from 2 nights and even though it was a Bank holiday and the hotel was fully booked, we found everything to be excellent- the staff all so friendly and helpful, the room was excellent, we ate in the restaurant the first night- the menu was a little limited but delicious, the second night we ate in the bar where the choice was far better, we cant wait to return soon-thanks to all the superb staff for making our stay so special-much appreciated",5,2018,08,07
238,"Hotel is dated, not a 5* property","My comments refer to the hotel as I don't play golf which is obviously the main draw for the hotel. We attended a corporate away day here and I hadn't been at this hotel for approx 10 years and it had barely changed. The lobby decor looks updated but not much else. The rooms are fine but the decor is bland and uninteresting. I couldn't believe the bathroom, still completely adorned in red marble - so dated and an assault on the eyes. Cleanliness was good but then that is a expected and shouldn't even need to be noted. We had a bbq especially for our group and I could not believe they served us what seemed like frozen burgers! I think we would have eaten better in a nice pub at half the price. The service was patchy as is so often the case in Ireland. such a shame that this is the poor showing of our Irish hotels to international visitors. Nothing about this hotel says 5* property to me! I would recommend the K Club instead.",3,2018,08,07
238,It's lost it's tranquility,I use to love to go to Druids glen for the ambience. I loved the peace and tranquility-it was a place to escape and switch off but it had lost that peaceful feeling since the renovation. It was packed with children. The food was fair. Not good value for money. We were disappointed,2,2018,08,06
238,Awesome Golf Trip,"Playing golf in Ireland can be a lottery with the weather and it was our lucky day! The venue was booked for a joint 50th birthday, we played both course, The Druids and The Heath, and they were both fantastic in their own right.  The hotel and it's staff were so accommodating and friendly, the bar was well stocked and the food excellent.  Family, friends, golf or romance, this resort will deliver. Well done to all the staff for delivering a great venue. we will be back!",5,2018,08,06
238,Beautiful hotel,We stayed here for one night. It really is a beautiful hotel. The room is spacious and luxurious. The bars and restaurants are really good too with a lovely relaxed atmosphere. Very nice breakfast to top the trip off.,5,2018,08,06
238,Special trip with grandchildren,"We recently visited Druids Glen with our two young grandchildren. This was the first time we took the children here. And we would bring them back in an instance. 

On arrival the reception staff were extremely friendly to the children. Both children received a small gift pack of a book and colouring crayons. We had a short wait for our room but there was an old fashioned ice cream cart in the reception area. We availed of this at a reasonable price. Later on that evening a gift of chocolates and an acknowledgement card (for the delay in getting our room) was delivered to our room. Nice touch.

The hotel was buzzing with families taking advantage of a very reasonable deal. I can’t ever remember seeing a 5-star hotel so busy and atmospheric. The facilities for the children were great, especially the swimming pool and the play park just outside. Even though there were selected times that children could use the pool this worked out great, as you could spend several hours in the pool before getting ready for dinner. The children’s time in the pool in the morning also allowed you to have some pool time before breakfast (which was served until 11 a.m). 

The staff were very friendly to the children at all times. They made the children feel welcomed. 

We would definitely bring our grandchildren to this hotel in the future.",5,2018,08,05
238,Business - 2 nights ,"One of my favourite hotels in this area. 

The accommodation is modern, spacious and well presented. Bedrooms are exceptionally comfortable and turned down at night time. I especially love the separate bathroom and shower facilities with the extras would expect in a hotel of this calibre, fluffy towels, spa like contemporary amenities. 

I ate twice at the bar, (the restaurant was outside my business budget) the food was exceptionally good, tasty and a good selection. The only negative was service was slow and twice I had to ask where my food or drink was, disappointing as although the bar appeared busy especially with young families, my expectations weren’t met. 

I used the leisure facilities and they were clean modern and well controlled by the lifeguards/attendants. Pity the dryer (for swimming shorts) was broken. 

All in all this is an excellent hotel and I would recommend highly. 

",5,2018,08,05
238,2 night break at druids glen resort ,"I stayed at Druids Glen with my husband in June for a 2 night relaxing break away ‘ he had stayed there previously on a golf trip and absolutely loved it ‘

On arrival to the hotel the staff were so professional and accommodating’ we were upgraded to a superior king room with vaulted ceilings’ the bed was huge and super comfortable!! The bathroom was also fabulous.My only issue with the room was the decor was a little dated. 

We spent most of our time relaxing in the leisure Centre which was very busy at the time of the summer’ that area of the hotel was gorgeous. 

We had breakfast both mornings I have to say I was a little disappointed with the quality of breakfast for a 5 star hotel. 
For dinner we dined in a local pub in Wicklow called the castle inn. 

Overall we had a really enjoyable stay at the hotel ‘ However I do think it has more of a 4 star rating. 

",4,2018,07,31
238,Fabulous Stay ,We stayed in the Druids Glen at the weekend. We had a fabulous stay. We arrived at the hotel early and we were given our room within a few minutes which we so appreciated after a long journey. The room was fabulous and very comfortable. The food was amazing for breakfast lunch and dinner. Excellent service all staff were very friendly. Pool area was very clean and well maintained. Well done to all the team at Druids Glen we hope to be back again soon.  ,5,2018,07,31
238,Average stay,"Had a lovely welcome at reception and was able to check in at one which was great. Had lunch in the garden lounge service was good and food was nice one of us had a started and although was beautiful and size of a started was on dearer side of €12.00. Bit overpriced. Room was lovely and bathroom. Three of us stayed and had an individual bed each which is great.
Went to spa and was when it let us down in regards facilities there is just pool sauna and steam room and the jacuzzi wasn’t working also not relaxing compared to other spa places I’ve been to such as monart and Farnham estate.
So we went to the relaxation room which was not relaxing at all therapist kept constantly entering and the entrance door let a lot of light in so how could switch off with people walking in and out and talking I actually got a headache and left mad went back to the room. 
My treatment and my friends treatments were lovely and high standard but following it wouldn’t of been able to sleep in relaxation room.
Had dinner in the gardens lounge but not 5 start standard meal was nice but had to ask for salt and vinegar friend had to ask for her sauce with her salmon again but when came was finished her meal and also had to re ask for a side dish which was ordered the desserts were not nice.
Breakfast was very disappointing got cold toast twice asked for tea and coffee but only for tea and had to ask for butter twice plus was waiting for these for ages and also the breakfast was cold and porridge was like rubber. 
Unfortunately Would not return and said at breakfast to my friends that glad not staying a second night and usually don’t want to go home although may be picking at small things it made a difference and all 3 of us were not as impressed as other places have stayed. Did not feel like 5 star. Was disappointed ",2,2018,07,29
238,a lovely stay,Stayed here recently and would definitely recommend this hotel. The staff were very welcoming and helpful.  The rooms are large and very comfortable offering relaxing seating which I think is essential in a hotel room. We enjoyed a lovely meal and were served by a helpful waiter who was interested in asking us where we were from and offered helpful information for trips during our stay.  Breakfast was quite good but I got the impression that the hot buffet had been sitting a little too long.  Also it was a tad unimaginative and was perhaps the 'same old'.,4,2018,07,28
238,A beautiful Hotel,"We stayed two nights in this hotel, it's
Truly a lovely place to stay.
We had our two grandchildren with us, they were not disappointed, there's so much to do, they were able to make friends at the High Tea Banquet specially for children where trained staff attended to all their demands.
The rooms were tastefully decorated, beds extremely comfortable and the 
Hotel itself was impeccable.

The staff in reception and house keeping very friendly and  accommodating.

I found the service on the garden terrace erratic, three times three different  people took a drinks order,
Eventually it came, The food  was disappointing.

In the main Restaurant, the food was way over priced for what we got,
I ordered monk fish which was served on a bed of baked beans/peas 
 €31.

I love this hotel, this is my third time stsying here, yes I will definitely be back we really enjoyed our stay hope they can improve their food menu.

238,"Relaxing stay, Beautiful Hotel, Beautiful Location","We stayed here for 2 nights this week. The hotel itself is lovely. Customer service from the staff was second to none. They got ""friendly"" very well balanced - enough to make you feel welcome and that they were interested in you as a guest but not in an intrusive manner.",5,2018,07,25
238,Amazing experience!,"The hotel, restaurant, bar & golf course are all lovely.  Our room was perfect - most comfortable beds, great shower!  We played one of the courses, and it was gorgeous.  We went in November on a colder day, and had the course all to ourselves!  My boyfriend still talks about it.  The restaurant & bar were both wonderful experiences.  We were very happy with our stay!  We would absolutely stay here again & would highly recommend!",5,2018,07,24
238,Fabulous stay to celebrate our engagement,"I cannot say enough nice things about our stay in Druids Glenn. We went here for one night to celebrate our engagement and loved every minute of it. From the moment we arrived we felt like royalty, the staff were so attentive! Liz who checked us in was so friendly and made such an effort telling us about the facilities. We were congratulated so many times and it made us feel extra special.  The bar was lovely and relaxing and we sat outside on the decking overlooking the grounds in the glorious sunshine.

We had booked a suite which was fabulous and we were surprised with prosecco and desserts when we got there. We went down for dinner and again sat out on the decking. We were served by the lovely Mary who couldn’t have been friendlier. The food was gorgeous and all the staff were again, so attentive. 

Breakfast, spa facilities, the walk around the ground…everything in this hotel is top class. We can't wait to go back. Thank you for making our celebrations even more special.",5,2018,07,24
238,First Family Getaway,"Packing up with a new born we headed for The Druids Glen, having heard great recommendations from several friends. Can safely say it lived up to its expectations and made our first family holiday so enjoyable. The service was 5 star, staff were so friendly and efficient. I loved that breakfast was served until 11. The baby pantry room is a really clever idea it contained steralisers, bottle warmer, sink & microwave. Beautiful walks around the hotel, we loved that we could stop and eat in different places within the grounds. Especially loved each evening sitting out and admiring the views from the decking area in the garden bar. Looking forward to returning soon !",5,2018,07,21
238,Mrs Eilish Mackle,Druids Glen has to be one of the most enjoyable friendly hotels my family and I have stayed in everything from the moment we walked into the hotel was nothing but 5star. The gentleman man at the door the beautiful reception team the waitresses not to mention the spa and the fantastic Laura who gave me one of the best facials I’ve ever had. Our stay was just fabulous   We hope to go back soon. Thank you so much for making our stay awesome. ❤️❤️,5,2018,07,20
238,Wedding,"We attended a wedding here the other day, it wa a fantastic, the food, the reception, the ball room, everything was perfect.. I would consider it for my own wedding! A big thank you to Nikita she served our table and was fantastic, was always on call and went above and beyond. She deserves a special thank you! I will be back!",5,2018,07,20
238,Wonderful,"The most comfortable, relaxing experience. Top class staff who are both helpful and friendly. We were made to feel very special. The pool, steam room and sauna are well maintained and staff are welcoming and helpful.",5,2018,07,20
238,Celebrating 50 and 60.,"If you are looking for quality and standard of the highest level in every area then Druids Glen is the place. From the moment you enter, the grounds, You will feel special. The staff and service are outstanding and have a way of making your stay feel that you just have to return. Reception, Bar, Restaurant, Bedrooms, Spa, Pool are of an extremely high standard. I regularly visit Druids Glen and have never been disappointed.",5,2018,07,20
238,Outstanding in every way,"Having just returned from 4 nights in DG, I feel I owe it to the staff to write a note on how positive our stay was at DG. Few hotels manage to be both 5 star and child friendly and Druids Glen is the first hotel that we have come across that truly offers 5 star service for the adults but also to the children. In so many hotels the kids are almost seen as an annoyance, in Druids Glen you feel the kids are the guests and Mam and Dad are there for the break also! 

Dedicated play room, dedicated room for washing bottles and making baby food, the super playground, the fairy trees, the kids welcome pack, the swimming times, and the little robes are all examples of how far this hotel goes to welcome the little ones.

But how it does this while maintaining the five star experience for the grown ups is the real achievement. 

Breakfast was really lovely, the rooms are big and clean, the grounds are impeccable and the staff are top class - special mention to Mark in the bar who served us a meal - he was so attentive to our toddlers needs. 

Will absolutely return and would recommend families and couples alike to do the same.",5,2018,07,19
238,Paradise!,"I could write a book about how amazing this place is. We have returned year on year & i was a bit worried it would loose its magic but it just gets better with each visit. Heaven on earth. 
Liz did an absolutely stunning job & checking us in & out & looking after us on our stay. ( we loved the fairy trail by the way Liz!)  Nothing was too much trouble. The food & atmosphere are just out of this world. 
We were travelling around this year & Druids Glen was our last stop & it just felt like such a relief to be there & he looked after so well. 
This is how a five star hotel should be. Nothing left wanting. Unreal.",5,2018,07,16
238,Not to be missed,"Druids Glen is a must for golfers and non golfers 
Fantastic hotel with staff that go out of there way to make sure you just cannot wait to go back.So many courses to choose from inside 20 minutes.make sure to eat at the Glen Golf Course fantastic building with so much history ",5,2018,07,16
238,Heavenly,Over the weekend my daughter and I booked into the spa for a day of relaxation. We both had facials and full body massages. I think I have found the world's best therapist.  I had the advanced facial and it was incredible. I was asked by two people today what skincare are use and commented how radiant my skin looked.  That has not happened to me before. My full body massage has left me relaxed with no aches and pains and my skin feels incredibly soft. I slept so well last night and even went to bed two hours before my usual bedtime.  My therapist name was SERENA ; she was so knowledgeable and experienced. I hope that this review doesn't make her too busy so that I have to join the queue to see her again. Thank you so much Serena !!!!,5,2018,07,16
238,Family celebration ,"Fantastic 5 star service from reservations to check out. All of the staff we met were superb and customer focused in an unobtrusive way
Food in the Garden restaurant and Hugo’s was delicious with something to suit everyone 

Room 202 is the wheelchair accessible room and has 2 beds (queen and king I think). The mattress was soft rather than firm. The room had plenty of turning space

The wheelchair accessible bathroom had a standard height toilet with grab rails on each side of the toilet. The hand basin was a suitable height with space underneath for a wheelchair to fit. The roll in shower has one vertical grab rail and a free standing shower seat ( that is height adjustable). An added bonus is the beautiful Elemis products and plenty of towels . There is good turning space in the bathroom 

Bathrobes are provided 
The hairdryer is in the wardrobe 
There are plenty of places to charge phones and wheelchair 

The spa is tranquil and alas I only had time to get my nails painted. Next time I’ll be more organised!  The team in the spa  were so friendly 

Finally, a special word of thanks to Romy (Head of Operations) and all of the excellent staff we met during our overnight stay. They couldn’t have been more helpful to our group of 10. I’m already looking forward to my next visit ",5,2018,07,15
238,Five Star ,"Excellent , 5 Star service from beginning to end. Had a meal in the restaurant, service was impeccable , attention to detail at all times. Breakfast was excellent , gluten free choices available , Teapots were gleaning that you could actually do your make up using them. Checkout was very swift , highly recommend Druids Glen.",5,2018,07,15
238,Beautiful exec room,Beautiful hotel and upgraded exec room was really nice and large. Robes in the room however were very worn and fraid. Bar staff annoyingly slow and unattentive and could be heard complaining about hours worked etc. Despite these small things it's a fantastic hotel and will definitely return,4,2018,07,15
238,"Wonderful, family friendly hotel","We have just returned from another stay a Druids Glen and as with every other stay it was faultless...

* Excellent, friendly and welcoming staff, from the porters, to the reception staff to the breakfast staff.
* Beautiful and tasteful decor throughout with stunning flower arrangements in the lobby
* Very family friendly - small bathrobe, slippers and toiletries laid out for my son as well as a colouring in pack provided for meal times. Super play room and outdoor play park. 
* Good, varied and tasty bar menu
* Breakfast is our favourite hotel breakfast of all time, just one niggle, please do crispier bacon! The omelette and crepe bar is worth queuing up for. Lovely selection of fruit, home made granola, smoked salmon, pastries, scones etc too. 
* Lovely spa. My treatment was lovely and the touches in the relaxation room like the choice of flavoured waters, tea and fruit was great. Also appreciated the €10 discount voucher for products.
* Good gym and lovely big pool with good swimming times for families.",5,2018,07,13
238,Relaxing night inn in  Druids glen,I spent a wonderfull  night in Druids Glen.  I had lovely treatments  in the spa.  Staff  in the spa were very professional  and friendly. We had a beautiful  dinner. The ambience  was wonderfull  in the hotel. We all totally  chilled out.  We were a party of 6.. Will be back  again.,5,2018,07,09
238,Ms A Kelly,"Exceptional food, atmosphere, amazing room with beautiful view over golf course. New outside decking seated area off dinning bar tranquil setting. Visit for poor relaxation and enjoy a round of golf with a spa and pool to make it that special ***** retreat.

A visit to be had without a doubt , enjoy 😊",5,2018,07,09
238,Last minute get away,"We booked last minute myself husband and two kids, from the moment we arrived to our departure everything was superb 

The reception staff upon check in were so pleasant and friendly as were the bar and restaurant staff, our meal was delicious and our two girls loved that they could pick their own dvds for bed and snuggle up in their own little robe and slippers with a hot chocolate before bed.

We enjoyed a picnic a swim and a walk around the grounds .. we will 100%",5,2018,07,09
238,The best hotel EVER,"There are so many good things about this hotel, but the fab rooms the pool the breakfast the restaurant don't come close to the staff and they are all outstanding. The staff at this hotel don't just go the extra mile they just keep going, literally anything they can do for you they do, nothing is too much trouble. I have stayed here three times now and can't wait to come back. Love it.",5,2018,07,08
238,Absolutly fantastic,"Stayed one night here, what a stunning location with a great looking hotel to stay in. Room was spotless with a great view over the back gardens. Despite being close to the restaurant and bar area, very little noise even with the big windows open. All staff friendly, dinner was lovely with good service. Only wish I had more time to spend enjoying the facilities.",5,2018,07,08
238,The anniversary weekend that nearly never was....,"Arrived last Friday night for our 8th wedding anniversary. I’d been warned in advance that the hotel fills with kids and can be busy but the bar staff were totally swamped. We sat in the terrace and ordered some bar food. Fair play the waiter admitted the kitchen was busy, likely 30 minute wait for food, but after 1.25 hrs I’d lost my cool and went in search of the manager. I was told to wait at the bar...I waited....he didn’t turn up, so I went to reception and vented there. Food eventually turned up with abject apologies and, you guessed it, the pizza order was wrong. This pretty much lit the blue touch paper. Had I not had a beer I would have got back in the car and left. Eventually got the right order and paid....noting that nothing was removed from the bill. Had it been me I’d have waived the cost of the bill, but then I know how to manage a restaurant. Plenty of “would you like to talk to the Duty Manager...” but nothing around “we’ll address this appalling lack of service...”
After a nice walk the next morning, make sure you walk round to old clubhouse and go up to the roof terrace (course looks fantastic - photo of 18th below) then a spell in the spa, the mood had improved somewhat. Dinner in the hotel that evening was pretty good.
A quick tip....use the golfers bar in the hotel for a drink/snack. It’s far less busy and you actually get served. It’s on the spa side of the hotel on the ground floor.
May be back to play a round of golf but won’t be staying at the hotel again. Carton House a superior option.",3,2018,07,07
238,Love this hotel,"We stayed 2 nights at the hotel for our wedding anniversary at the end of June 2018. A lot of work has been carried out since our last visit and all for the better. I have never seen as many guests sitting around the hotel and the buzz was different. Staff  were friendly, helpful and courteous & nothing was any trouble.",5,2018,07,06
238,Amazing Hotel - Perfect Family Birthday,"It was my mum's birthday (a big one but she'd kill me if I said) and she wanted to something special for her and the family, a stay in a 5-star resort, but not stuffy and formal. My partner suggested we go to Druids Glen. Everyone loved the idea so it was all booked, and because it was a special trip we had requests for the Golf, Spa and dinner etc. The staff at the hotel couldn't have been more helpful an accommodating especially Shelly in reservations, in fact she arranged everything so wonderfully that the trip went perfectly.

We arrived early, before check-in time (not a problem), we were checked in, our bags taken and reception would ring us when the rooms were ready. So everyone off to the bar for lunch. We had mains, a few drinks, and lots of chat. The food enjoyable, very tasty and the service was excellent. 

We got to our rooms and they were beautifully decorated, clean and spacious. During our stay, some of us went to the spa and others played golf or just went for walks (the grounds are beautiful and well worth a walk). The facilities are excellent and everything is maintained to a high standard and the service is welcoming, friendly and professional. All the staff clearly take pride in their work and the property. 

For mums birthday dinner there was 10 of us, and we got a great table with a view in the main restaurant. The food in the dining room is superb, with lots of variety so there is something for everyone. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal and the service was impeccable, as it had been throughout our stay. 

Overall I would highly recommend a stay here. The hotel style and the atmosphere is one of relaxed luxury and simple understated elegance, perfect for a casual and carefree weekend of simple enjoyment and leisure.",5,2018,07,06
238,Great visit,"Had great two night visit to druids glen . Very comfortable and clean hotel.  And enjoyed dinner and drinks every evening.  
Played lovely course . dry due to heatwave but in good condition. Would highly recommend.",5,2018,07,05
238,Nice Midweek Getaway,"Spent two nights here and enjoyed every moment. Staff are so helpful and friendly. The hot towels are a special touch at reception on arrival. Rooms are spacious, clean and have AC which was really necessary here last week. Breakfast was buffet style, anything you wanted basically. Great atmosphere in the bar/outside decking area during our stay and a special thanks to Jose who looked after us so well. The only thing was we felt there could be a bit more of a choice on the dinner menu. What we had both nights was gorgeous & tasty. Perfect location and so close to Powerscourt Gardens & Waterfall and also Mount Usher Gardens. Definitely will visit again in the future. If you are looking for a quiet break school holidays not the best time to go here. It's a very kids friendly hotel.",5,2018,07,02
238,Family break,"Just back from weekend break with my wife, 7 year old son and extended family as we were celebrating father-in-law's 80th birthday.  First of, I'd highlight the exceptional friendliness and attentiveness of the staff, without fail every person we spoke to was fabulous.

Room was spacious and clean, to be honest we didn't spend much time in it but it had everything we needed and the beds were comfortable.

After an efficient and friendly check-in we headed to the pool which the kids loved.  Don't worry though, there are adult only times for those here without kids.

We then headed for drinks on the terrace outside to enjoy the lovely weather while the kids made use of the games room and outside playground. 

We ate in the restaurant on the Friday night and in the bar on the Saturday night, all 14 of us were happy with our meals both nights and the service was really friendly without intruding on our celebration.

The bar is relaxing with plenty of space indoors and out on the balcony to relax, after 9pm its kids free.

We hired a babysitter through an agency the hotel recommended and this worked out well, all very easy.

We visited Mount Usher gardens on the Saturday and Glendalough on the Sunday, would recommend both for couples and families.

Wasn't the weekend for golfing for us but we did use the driving range which was great and the golf courses looked immaculate.

I'm a keen runner so enjoyed the walking trail round the golf course and headed on through Kilcoole to the coast.  6 miles (10km) round trip and for those that like to get out for a jog a lovely run with beautiful views on the coast.

Overall Druids Glen helped us have a fabulous birthday celebration, the staff are excellent and I think there is something to suit everyone here, unless you want a completely kids free hotel.",5,2018,07,02
238,More suitable for families rather than couples,"Staff are really really lovely, however I wouldn’t call this a five star hotel. Very family friendly, not great for a couples weekend away as there seems to be children everywhere. Food is also fab. Would recommend to family’s rather than couples seeking a quiet break.",3,2018,07,01
238,Wonderful 4 days playing golf and eating ,"My husband and I had been here before and loved the Druids glen course though the food was not brilliant and it was overrun with kids, so it was with some trepidation that we took our friends there for our yearly get together to play golf. WHAT a change! We ate in both restaurants and both were good and the staff were super. We all enjoyed our stay immensely. This visit we played both courses and enjoyed both. I would highly recommend.",4,2018,06,28
238,Family Wedding - Beautiful Venue,"I recently stayed here for a family wedding. Everything was perfect from check-in to check-out. Staff were so friendly and professional. Nothing was an inconvenience. The food was excellent! 

The bedroom was very large and well appointed. I had a very comfortable and restful sleep. Lovely big bathroom with a great shower. 

Breakfast was excellent with so many choices. Again, staff couldn't have been better. 

The hotel is set in a beautiful part of the country with easy access to places like Glendalough, Powerscourt etc, if you're driving or, there are nice walks around the grounds. 

It would be very easy to spend many days here. 

Wedding rate was €185/night B&B. Normal rate, especially weekend, is higher.",5,2018,06,27
238,Midweek break,"Just returned home after a stay at this wonderful hotel.... 
Booked it only the day before direct with the hotel and got a good deal including dinner. 
Stayed in a superior room (128) which was beautiful, spotless clean and smelt amazing over looking the garden with a little balcony. 
Check in was flawless with very helpful friendly and informative staff. 
The grounds of the hotel are fabulous with 2 golf courses and beautiful walks. 
Also the decor throughout the hotel is stunning clean and bright. 
Dinner and breakfast was also great with lots of variety.. My only complaint is that we didn't stay longer... Can't wait for our future visits... 
Well done  to all at Druids Glen",5,2018,06,27
238,"Great Hotel, Fantastic Golf Course","If you are looking to play golf on a fantastic golf course and stay in a great hotel then choose Druids Glen! Lovely rooms, great food, great staff, and to top it off the golf course is amazing with sublime views and settings. If you have time go and play Wicklow, that’s another great course. ",5,2018,06,26
238,Nice hotel and very friendly staff,"I recently spent a night at the Druids Glen while travelling through Wicklow. The room was very clean and the bed extremely comfortable. The bathroom was spacious with a tub and standup shower. It was a really comfortable stay. I had dinner in the hotel restaurant (The Garden Room). It was really good (burger and fries) and so was the service. All of the hotel staff were exceptionally friendly and chatty, which really added to the already good impression of the hotel. Next time I'm bringing my golf clubs, as I hear the golf course is pretty awesome too.",5,2018,06,25
238,Lovely family holiday,"We stayed here for 2 nights and had a very enjoyably stay. First impressions from the lobby to our room with Tarigh (sorry if I spelled your name wrong) who gave us a  very warm welcome. He was very friendly and explained every single feature in the room :) At breakfast you can’t fail to notice the gentleman from India “Thomas” who was always smiling, active and very efficient. However, a few points at breakfast could be improved - the toaster not available (however they bring toast to your table), and it would be good to have a selection of salads. We also had dinner at the bar and lounge where “Emma” was very friendly and helpful. The Fish and Chips were amazing but the pizza was disappointing as the base was quite tough and hard to cut even with a steak knife. The team offered replacements to the pizza if we wanted, and they were keen to put things right.
The rest of the team was very good but those named here really stood out. Keep it up guys! And I Love the flower decorating around the hotel.",5,2018,06,21
238,A wonderful night away from reality!,"Unfortunately we were only able to take up a 1 night offer at this wonderful property but it certainly won't be our last visit.
We checked in a little early, 2:30ish, and after a quick hot towel refresh and glass of water, courtesy of a very nice lady on reception, we followed the porter to our room.
We were allocated room 128 which had a small balcony with pleasant views of the resort and was well equipped for 2 adults. 
Couple of minor issues that stop me from rating the hotel 5/5: tea cups were dirty unforgivable at any hotel, not enough complimentary shortbread, possibly a problem for me only, but the main issue was with the pillows which were more akin to a couple of airbags in all honesty! Minor moans really and very easily sorted.
After a quick trip to the excellent gym and pool/jacuzzi area, we really did want to make the most of our stay, we returned to find a chilled bottle of prosecco and small box of chocs had been left for us. A nice touch along with the card wishing us a happy anniversary. Turn down service arrived early around 6:30pm and, after returning with the ice bucket we requested, we were given our 2 chocolates normally reserved for the pillows!
Our package included a 3 course meal in Hugos restaurant, I will add a separate review, suffice to say we had an exceptional meal. We retired to the cosy bar area to sip an expensive post dinner cocktail, 12-13 euros each, but very well made. No live music on the Sunday evening we stayed which was a shame.There is plenty of communal seating throughout the hotel and we did locate a pool table above reception. Board games were also provided for younger guests.
Breakfast the following morning, served between 7&11am, was both welcoming and plentiful.It is mainly self service with tea/coffee and toast brought to your table.Omelettes and crepes are made to order and, after sampling the vast majority of items on offer, I would rate this as one of the best hotel breakfasts I've ever had, Complimentary newspapers are also available.
We explored the beautiful grounds, hoping to walk off breakfast, and wished we had another day at Druids Glen to enjoy....maybe next time! 
Overall a thoroughly enjoyable and relaxing stay and a special mention to the wonderful staff we encountered who are a real credit to the hotel.",4,2018,06,19
238,Outstanding!,"My husband and I had a one night break at Druids Glen. We booked a dinner, B&B deal which was fairly pricey but it was so worth it! We were upgraded to a suite which was such a lovely surprise and so appreciated. Our meal was delicious as were our drinks after (I had a non-alcoholic Tom Collins, fab!).
Our room was so comfy and breakfast was out of this world, anything you could want they had! 
We were made to feel so welcome and so comfortable by all the staff, thank you so much!
It was our one night away before baby #2 comes and it honestly was just the ticket. 
The pool facilities were also great. Don’t have a bad thing to say. Would highly recommend. Thank you Druids Glen from two well rested parents! 👍🏻",5,2018,06,19
238,"Very satisfied, breakfast amazing.","Really enjoyed our stay.   The fee charged for the room for the Saturday night was a tad high and would put me off returning in a hurry but we decided to try it this time anyhow and had a lovely time.
The breakfast was without doubt the best brekkie we've ever had in any hotel, be it Irish or abroad. The selection and quality was just amazing.  10/10 for the breakfast.
  Room was very comfy, spa is excellent, the good lady said massage was great.  Pool etc all very nice too and not over-crowded.
Lovely and quiet at night, cosy bed.  
Bar food was a bit 'meh' for the price, so I wouldn't eat in the bar again for lunch but aside from that everything was either good or excellent.
Wish I could eat breakfast there every day!",5,2018,06,18
238,Family friendly!,"I brought my husband & 2 year old son here for a night. I’ve stayed before & loved it but it was so much better this time around! From the minute we walked through the doors, staff were trying to make our stay as relaxed as possible! Really friendly staff the whole time, nothing was an issue! They made our stay so relaxed with our 2 year old. They welcome children at this hotel and the colouring packs were a big hit! The pool area is lovely, a nice warm pool! Food at the bar is gorgeous, nice menu and great selection of kids food and plenty of it! It’s the little touches for families I loved, they know what families need & what helps! The play areas were a huge hit inside and out! We never felt we were unwanted with a small child! Definitely coming back for longer the next time! Highly recommend staying here! ",5,2018,06,17
238,small wedding,"myself and my wife had our wedding celebration here. It was just a small party but the staff really went above and beyond to make sure our entire experience was an absolute pleasure.
the facilities here are excellent, the views are spectacular, but the staff are what really sells this place.",5,2018,06,16
238,Plenty to do but some of the staff...,"

A lot of positives in this hotel

Outside and indoor play areas
Nice walk around the golf course
Kids colouring pack when you check in
Nice pool
Baby changing area, with bottle sterilisers and baby formula, nappies, a fridge, a microwave
Breakfast was excellent, great friendly staff here and extremely efficient
Nice room, very clean

Negatives - a couple of the reception staff poor customer experience
Here are a couple of little things- not big enough that you would make a complaint but a little off putting 

We checked in a little early, they said they’d ring when our room was ready but they didn’t, And just reiterated checkin is at 4 when I went back to them to ask why they hadn’t rang

Went to the pool with my 2 year old and when we got back to the room both the keys didn’t work, I had to walk to reception (in my dressing gown) the lady at reception didn’t even bother to apologise, just said ‘you must have had them near a phone’
At the same time there was a woman next to me screaming at them because she had waited an hour and a half for someone to bring up some milk - their response to her was that was a different department and she’d have to get onto them herself!!

There are more little things but I won’t go on
I had a poor first impression because of my initial interactions but by the last day (wed) the staff had changed over and they were wonderful

All in all I probably would stay there again. Lots for kids and staff at breakfast and breakfast was excellent",3,2018,06,15
238,Midweek golf break with friends,"Played Druids Glen and Druids Heath over two days with a B&B stay in the Hotel. Firstly it was exceptional value for the deal that we got.

From the moment we arrived the staff could not have done enough for us. Shuttle bus from Hotel to the clubhouse.  Complimentary bottles of water for our golf from reception staff. The whole resort was immaculately clean. Dinner was lovely in the garden rooms and the pints even nicer. Breakfast the lady knew we were all together and seated us together. Plenty of choice and was suitably fueled up for the day ahead. the omelette bar was a nice touch. 

Golf courses were amazing except the 17th on Druids Glen that thoroughly beat me and my amateur skill set. We got very lucky with the weather and the views of the bay from the Heath course were immense. Both courses were in pristine condition.
   
All of agreed that this will become an annual trip.",5,2018,06,15
238,so pleased we found this hotel,we go to southern Ireland every year & have now marked up several hotels as MUST return to next year & this is now added to our list --its  a lovely hotel --not too easy to find if one takes the hilly narrow road but next time from Rosslaire we will take the coastal road but it was worth it staff are amazing made one feel a special guest --bar food was great & our room was in a lovely quiet area of the hotel --a nice touch was a card & chocs in our room --breakfast was beautifully laid out so we will be back next year,5,2018,06,11
238,Felt like a week away,"My wife and I are just back from celebrating out 10th anniversary. We only stayed 2 nights, but we feel like we've away for a week. From the moment we arrived and were greeted with a warm lavender towel, we knew we were in for a special experience. There was a little mix up with our booking but the staff sorted it out with the minimum of fuss. Our room was spotless and we were welcomed with a lovely card and chocolates to help us celebrate our anniversary. A lovely touch. 

The breakfast is wonderful and there just isn't enough time to take it all in. The egg and pancake station can get busy at times but the girl in charge never gets flustered and keeps the food coming without delay. She makes great omelettes! The walking trail around the course is very enjoyable and finishes at Woodstock House, where we enjoyed delicious food and a nice trip back to the hotel thanks to the courtesy car. It's the little things. 

The pool and other amenities are worth taking in. Even a trip to the plunge pool should be done, it's worth it. Great sense of achievement. 

If I had one gripe it's with the pillows in the room. They are quite flimsy and don't provide much support. My neck was quite sore the morning after. It's a small thing but inconvenient none the less. Overall, we had an excellent stay and will be back as soon as we can. ",5,2018,06,10
238,Excellent Hotel,"Myself my wife and our 3year old stayed for 3 nights over the weekend. I was very pleased with the hotel. I thought that the staff were excellent and made us feel very welcome and more importantly, made our son feel very welcome. The facilities were great. The swimming pool, playground and play room were ideal. The food at the hotel was also excellent, whether it was the amazing breakfast of the delicious dinners. The room was very spacious and extremely comfortable. We had one minor issue with a small leak in the air conditioning but we notified the desk and somebody was up to fix it within a few minutes. I would highly recommend. And I look forward to staying again.",5,2018,06,05
238,Nice bit of Luxury,"We had a lovely stay in Druids Glen, from the moment you walk in the door the hotel is beautiful with a large spacious reception and relaxation area with a lovely door manager who left no stone on-turned and was fantastic at predicting your needs before you even had to ask.  The rooms were spacious and the beds were extremely comfortable.   We dined in the restaurant that night as a group and the staff while very nice were so on-organised.  I believe we waited over an hour for our main course.    Breakfast was delicious, we a lovely omelette counter and raw honey comb straight from the hive... nice touch !",4,2018,06,05
238,Lovely relaxing trip ,"I stayed here for one night with my ten year old son. Just the two of us. From the moment we arrived we were made feel at ease and welcome. 
The staff in this hotel are so kind and pleasant and really take an interest in the children. Something I have never seen before - worldwide. 

The rooms are beautifully clean and spacious. 

Swimming pool ideal to relax and also have a bit of fun during family times. 

There is an excellent games room and play area for kids as well as the beautiful walk through the glen.

We ate in the bar which again had lovely friendly staff and the food could not be faulted. 

Thank you for making our trip relaxed and putting us at ease. Travelling on your own with a child is not always easy. The staff here really deserve a special mention ",5,2018,05,30
238,Lovely relaxing break.,"We stayed in Druids Glen for our birthday treat. The reception was busy but with three receptionists we didn't wait long. The room was very spacious with a king and a double bed. Tea/coffee facilities and plenty of bottled water. 
Dinner in Hugo's was delicious. Staff were efficient and we weren't rushed. 
The pool was busy at 5.30 but we had it to ourselves around 6.00. 
Would recommend this as a luxurious treat.",5,2018,05,27
238,Very pleasant stay in the Garden County !,Very enjoyable stay in Druids Glen hotel. Stylish and  spacious  5 * accommodation with excellent staff ( particular mention for Deputy Manager Eoin & Front desk Liz who looked after us very well on the occasion of our 26th wedding anniversary). Love the quiet scenic setting of the hotel together with the revamped bar and excellent food.Highly recommended !,5,2018,05,25
238,Lovely Food ,Stayed in this hotel for a night away with my boyfriend. The food (breakfast and dinner) really stood out as it was top notch. I would really recommend the food to everyone. The staff were also lovely and very helpful. ,4,2018,05,24
238,Great break away,"Had a lovely stay, rooms food and spa were really good .Pool busy at times with kids but when we went the second day we had it to ourself .Had lunch in bar and dinner in restaurant both were really good .",5,2018,05,24
238,Relaxing Afternoon Tea get away time,"I had an enjoyable and relaxing afternoon tea at the hotel. The table was nicely set up and we had a lovely attentive lady looking after us - Irina did an excellent job with her service for the afternoon tea and she seemed to enjoy herself looking after everyone, which gave the whole place a good vibe. 
The afternoon tea was consistent and looked very presentable.
We sat by the window and had a good view of the mountains in the distance. 
The whole place was decorated very good with different types of flowers, which made the best retreat to unwind for an afternoon. 
Many thanks to Irina! Excellent service.",5,2018,05,22
238,Perfect for weekend with kids,"Top class all around. Rooms, food, staff, pool, etc. Special mention to Teague the concierge who was very helpful lots of times. Perfect location for weekend away with kids, but not over run with kids at the same time! A nice balance of luxury and family friendly ...                                                   ",5,2018,05,20
238,"1st visit, really impressed","Stayed for 1 night in a suite in Druids Glen. The room was amazing, afternoon tea was good, dinner was excellent but the staff make this hotel worth staying in. Made to feel really welcome and all staff we encountered were super nice and professional. 5 star service is definitely down to the friendly staff that engage with guests and make you feel special. Thanks for such a great experience that was far better than we expected for a 1 night get away.",5,2018,05,18
238,Great Visit ,"My wife and I stayed here last Sunday. We travel to Ireland quite often and have stayed at the K Club, Portmarnock to name a few. Druids Glen absolutely measures up so the finest golf resorts on the island. The hotel has a contemporary design that stands out among other properties. We met family members and friends in the lounge for coffee and later drinks and dinner. The room is set up with a combination of tables and couches. There is also a heated outdoor patio. I played the Druids Glen championship course which is a great test at 6500 yards from the white tees. Course is in great shape, the only downside is that the driving range is on the Heath course. They do provide nets to hit in to warm up. The staff at the hotel and the golf course were professional and friendly. The only blemish was a dirty towel in the bathroom that my wife needed changed out. Great place and we'll be back next year. ",4,2018,05,16
238,Stunning backdrop for an amazing vacation!,"This property surpassed our expectations.  Hospitality is at the highest level across the board, from front desk, food service and concierge.  Standouts;  Marie and Edele at front desk and Barbara at breakfast each morning.  This hotel is set on a  lovely landscape and picteresque grounds. Be sure to enjoy a meal at Woodstock House at the Druids Glen Golf Clubhouse.  This property is understated elegance at its best.  Rest, relax, take long walks and enjoy. Druids Glen Hotel and Golf Resort is warm and inviting.  Easy to catch the DART (train) from nearby Greystones.  We had a fabulous time and can't wait to return.",5,2018,05,14
238,FABULOUS,"1 word...""Adrienne""....the most pleasant, accommodating and personal individual we have met. Check-in was dealt with an upgrade, she then phoned our room to ensure we were happy everything. The spa had the best hotstone massage ever and Sam my therapist was a wee gem! The food, ambience and personality that we experienced in Druids Glen was all inclusive and not just for the avid golfer.
5🌟all the way. Thank you Druids Glen and your fantastic staff. ",5,2018,05,13
238,Nice hotel ,"We stayed here for a couple of nights on a trip around Ireland. We are not golfers, so we chose this hotel for its standard and for its restaurant which were both great. Our room had plenty of space and it also had a view of the garden. We tried the pool one day, and it was great. We also went for nice a walk on the walking path on the outskirts of the golf course.
We had dinner both nights in Hugo’s restaurant, and food was good. The service in the restaurant was great both at dinner and breakfast. We had dinner included, and it was a good deal.
The only bad things about this hotel is that it seems popular with groups (noisy at dinner and in the bar) and that you can hear people passing by your room on their way to breakfast or on their way to bed late at night. Not much the hotel can do about people talking loudly in the corridors. ",5,2018,05,12
238,a lovely little get away...,"This trip was a present i had gotten for my 30th birthday and it was amazing.
Our bags were brought to our room, warm drinks on arrival, chilled prosecco in our suite... robes in our wardrobes....all the little things that made it extra special. 

We did pay extra to upgrade our room for a beautiful view along with l'occitane toiletries but i really thought it was worth it. The turn down service along with the little chocolates were a lovely touch and i found the hotel to be really elegant and modern.It was a quite retreat and if that's what your looking for then its perfect.",4,2018,05,10
238,Comfortable and Understated Excellence,"We visited this hotel as a celebration of my wife’s sisters birthday weekend. This hotel has nice facilities that are somewhat understated, and when we were there in Jan-18 the hotel was completely sold out so was really busy, meaning all services were stretched to the extreme, however the staff managed to pull everything off which is a testament to their relaxed yet excellent nature. Food was nice and in particular breakfast was excellent. THe kids games room was a godsend given the terrible weather outside, whilst the pool was excellent for the whole facility. We had a mini suite and the room was excellently appointed. Worth the extra money, particularly if you are travelling with children. We will be back",5,2018,05,07
238,Fantastic overnight stay,"The Druids Glen Resort is bliss. A beautiful hotel which is well maintained, large rooms with king sized comfy beds. The staff are excellent, special mention to Jo on reception, Loic in Hugo’s and Daria at the Spa. The facilities are brilliant, we used the pool and the driving range and I had the best luxury pedicure ive ever had at the Spa. I would recommend his hotel to any one looking for a little luxury in beautiful surroundings.",5,2018,05,03
238,Peaceful and beautiful,"This was a return visit and we liked the hotel as much as ever. 

The reservation staff were fantastic making sure that we would get everything we wanted. 

Upon arrival the receptionist was friendly and helpful.  

The room was large and comfortable.  We felt most welcomed when we saw the Prosecco and chocolates.  It was a lovely touch. 

We had dinner in the bar area.  Staff were lovely.  The food was OK. 

My daughter enjoyed the spa; my grand-daughter loved the beautiful pool

The breakfast was good but the service was not great - just one over-worked person doing the serving.  

I had a Shepard's Pie for lunch - it was not good.  

The business center was disappointing - printer did not work; keyboard was remapped. (People need to be reminded to delete files they download.  There was all sort of private files and photos in the Download folder. ) 

Overall we still love this hotel for its location in the beautiful Wicklow countryside, the lovely décor, the beautiful pool, and the friendly helpful staff.  We will be back.",5,2018,05,01
238,Very nice,"Very nice hotel with very comfortable and large rooms. Situated in the countryside by a golf course means calm and quite which I like.
Impressive pool area and very nice view from the hotel room.
Very good breakfast service besides the scrambled eggs..
Wouldn't hesitate for a second about coming back. ",5,2018,04,30
238,"Super friendly,helpful staff really make this place stand out","Just back from a one night stay at Druid's Glen for a friend's wedding. As I was leaving for the church I managed to split my trousers all along the seam, front and back! What could have been an extremely embarrassing incident was totally rescued by the friendly, helpful and warm-hearted (and humourous) response from the team at reception - especially Edel. An unnamed member of staff who apparently sews their own clothes volunteered to do a repair job on the trousers and while I lounged about in my jeans they had the job done in 15 minutes.It was a great example of all that is best in Irish hospitality - excellent personal service with genuine warmth. Thanks so much Edel and team at Druid's Glen.",5,2018,04,30
238,overnight stay in April,"My wife and i stayed at this hotel recently and found the hotel good but not good value for money.The overnight stay cost 260 euros for bed and breakfast.We ordered a pint and whiskey and mixer which cost over 15 euros.I had to hand the pint back because it was warm . When i asked if any of the other beers were any colder i was told they all run through the same cooler and no apology for the warm beer.We later ordered a meal , burger and chips and fish and chips and the bill was a whopping 41 euros.Breakfast was lovely but the stay was ruined by flaws that are very easily solved . Better staff that would be more attentive would help",3,2018,04,29
238,Above and beyond 5 star ,"Just back from a 2 night stay at Druids Glen. We got a warm welcome checking in, we got upgraded to a suite as we were on honeymoon and it didn't disappoint. We ate in HUGOS restaurant on the first night which was amazing. Our little girl even tried the pizza and the server (a blonde girl from Lithuania) was so good and friendly with her. The staff just went above and beyond to make our stay nicer. The next night we ate in the bar which was delicious. They playroom is great and the toiletries in the rooms are all a nice touch. The spa is so relaxing and the treatment I got from Ramona was honestly the nicest treatment I've ever had. 
The breakfast selection in the hotel is the best I've ever seen and the chef is so friendly. I cannot wait to go back here and have no problem or hesitation recommending this hotel. ",5,2018,04,27
238,engagement stay,"Had such a fantastic time at Druids Glenn. Went to celebrate our engagement and they kindly upgraded our room. We ate both in the bar and at hugos restaurant and drank in both and the food was grea. The best thing about this hotel was the staff and service. Each person we met went above and beyond to make sure our stay was great and we felt really special as guests! Romy the operations manager left a personale note on our prosecco wishing us a happy engagement. The waiters personalized our desert. Top class service and amazing rooms and facilties. My only regret was I didnt get to use the spa, but I will definitely be returning!",5,2018,04,24
238,What's not to like?,"Lovely hotel with an excellent staff. Extremely mindful of their guests. Bar food was second to none! Rooms spotlessly clean, grounds lovely to walk in, very relaxing place to stay and we didn't even play golf....",5,2018,04,22
238,Top class,"5 Star all the way.Beautiful setting even if you are not playing golf.
Dinner in the restaurant was excellent,parsnip and ginger soup with homemade brown bread,pork fillet and potato gratin,followed by baked Alaska.
The service was flawless,well worth a visit.",5,2018,04,20
238,Brownie points!,"I stayed here once a few years ago on a golf society weekend and was very impressed,mostly by the genuine care of the staff that you were being looked after. I took my wife and 7yo on an overnight stay recently and was delighted that they both thought it was an 'amazing' place for a break (even for one night). I can truthfully not speak highly enough of the attention to detail from the staff, from check in through to the pool, the bar,dinner, and breakfast, you only have to look lost or confused for a moment and someone will appear to make everything feel that all is well and show you the way. All the usual stuff for a hotel of this standard was EXCELLENT, accommodation/cleanliness/parking/facilities/food........but the staff attitude to their guests would sway me to choose Druids Glen again in preference to other quality golf resorts I have been lucky to stay at. Can't wait to return, which my wife informs me is already at the planning stage so our eldest daughter can come too when she's home from Uni'.,",5,2018,04,19
238,Perfect escape,"Stayed for Friday evening dinner, bed and breakfast. Really like the recent lounge area upgrade, lots more comfy seating. Meal was lovely but the stars are the staff. So friendly and efficient, excellent service throughout our stay. Can't wait to return.",5,2018,04,14
238,Spa and Afternoon Tea,"We had a wonderful day at the hotel, starting with fabulous treatments in the spa, followed by a swim in the lovely pool and ending with the incredible afternoon tea. The food was absolutely amazing. We thoroughly enjoyed every minute of the experience thanks to your wonderful staff who were all so lovely and friendly. We will definitely be back! ",5,2018,04,08
238,Simply the Best!,"Not having been to my family's favourite hotel for a period of time, I was delighted that Druids Glen  still remains the perfect destination for a short family break. Truly the most professional staff throughout the hotel. Everyone of them plays their own unique role to ensure the guests have a fabulous break and their comforts are important to the hotel .
Fantastic stay!",5,2018,04,06
238,Disappointing not a 5 star anymore,"Having stayed here a number of times before I have always loved this Hotel, it has great positives lovely walks around the grounds a nice spa ..large comfortable rooms the staff are extremely friendly and very helpful and a great breakfast. However this hotel seems to have had a major overhaul and has re-designed the bar/ restaurant which is not as comfortable or as cosy as previous one, the bar and restaurant now looks like a large open plan sitting room with huge couches for large groups of families, the afternoon we arrived we went in for a quite lunch a big mistake lots of very young children crying, shouting and running around,  when we went to sit down the chairs had food all over them food on the table which hadn't been cleared and food all over the floor not what you would expect from a 5 star hotel the bar and restaurant in the evening is also full of children running around un supervised right up until 9;30pm most evenings,
The bar food menu was the same both nights we stayed as was the lunch menu .

Adult time in the pool was limited 11am --2pm and from 6pm when we did go to the pool at 11;15am on our second day there was also an aerobics class on so we could not use the pool.
On check out we were not asked how our stay was or asked did we enjoy our stayed answer would have been no.

Sorry guys loved this Hotel before but won't be returning anytime soon the peace and tranquility was definately missing this time for us.",3,2018,04,05
238,Staff/service Perfection,Lets face it. Great staff in hotels are hard to find. A hotel can have all the stars in the world but really comes down to the staff. This hotel is outstanding when it comes to ALL (and I mean ALL) the staff. The service we got from the minute we arrived until we left was fantastic. They just can’t do enough. It really is like the perfect hotel to stay in. The food is delicious. Best breakfast EVER. The grounds- stunning. I just cant say enough about this hotel. A huge thank you to all of you for making our stay so amazing. Can’t wait to go back. ,5,2018,04,05
238,Excellent,"We stayed for only one night in a well appointed wheelchair accessible room, with one of the best accessible bathrooms that I have seen. Dinner in the restaurant was excellent, with a good wine list, and not overpriced. Great atmosphere in the bar, again not overpriced for a hotel of this quality. Good self-service breakfast with an impressive egg station. My partner had a treatment in the Spa the following morning and was very happy with it. What really makes this place outstanding though is the attention to detail and efforts made by all the staff.",5,2018,04,03
238,Great Stay,"We had a lovely stay in Druids Glen. Myself, my other half and our 2 year old daughter had a ball. The reception staff were extremely welcoming and informative. The room was lovely, spacious, clean and had everything we needed. Only minor downfall was the air con would not go below 17C. Great place for kids with the kids room and playground, our daughter really enjoyed herself. The walking trail was also lovely. We enjoyed it very much. The hotel itself was spotless and decor was lovely. We will definitely be back!!",5,2018,04,02
238,Fabulous stay,"Fabulous stay would definitely return. Food beautiful, staff very helpful and friendly. Amazing breakfast. Great pool for kids and lovely rooms. Turndown service and room cleaning are very good and dressing gowns are a great touch. Couldn't fault this hotel. My little 3 year old was even given a box of chocolates complimentary one morning at breakfast! Can't wait to return however it is a bit pricey.",5,2018,04,02
238,Hidden Gem..,"Have to say, we live in Dublin and didn’t realise how close Druids Glen is and how much of a hidden gem it is.. From the very warm and friendly welcome we received on arrival until the minute we left the hotel we really felt at home. 

The rooms were spacious, comfortable and well kitted out. The food was great, spa was very good and the leisure facilities were also very good. The pool was clean and the freezing cold plunge pool is a must after the sauna!

There’s a lovely walk around the hotel over the the golf clubhouse and there is just generally a nice feel to the place. We will visit again..",5,2018,03,31
238,Disappointing weekend away,I stayed in Druids Glen on St Patrick’s weekend & was not impressed at all. The first room we got was looking onto a building site as they are renovating. I had to stand in the bar for the rugby match as there were so seats anywhere in the hotel & we had to queue to get food in the bar on the Saturday night & for breakfast. Very disappointing. Definitely not a 5 star destination.,2,2018,03,31
238,Such a lovely break from the city,"Stayed for one night with my Mum. Got the package of two 55min treatments in the spa, and one night B&B. We decided to upgrade to a superior room and wow was it gorgeous (325). Room was facing out on to stunning woodland and river. Breakfast was fabulous, so much choice and constantly restocked. We ate lunch and dinner in the Thirteenth Bar which was reasonable and delicious. Chose the facial option for out treatments and they were fabulous, left our skin glowing. Went for the 3km walk around the beautiful grounds the following morning to the clubhouse, and got the courtesy car back, which was a nice touch. However, the most impressive part of our whole experience, was the staff. They were so accommodating, friendly, helpful and genuine. Would definitely recommend and stay again!",5,2018,03,30
238,5star service,"We booked in for 2 nights with interconnecting rooms as we were travelling with 3 children. The hotel is top class and staff are friendly and always willing to chat if you wanted. The lobby has a relaxed feeling beautifully decorated. The breakfast menu is well laid out with plenty of choice. We had light lunch in the lobby again good menu and quick service, The 13th bar we ate at night great menu and lovely to chat to bar staff. Excellent amount of parking at front of hotel and lovely children's playground at the side. The gym is one of the best equipped we have seen for a hotel and the pool is very clean and if your brave enough I recommend trying the plunge pool. As 5star hotels go Druids Glen is great value excellent service and you won't be disappointed.
Perfect location for exploring surrounding areas.",5,2018,03,30
238,Great Weekend Stay,"We stayed for two nights at this fantastic Hotel. It was my daughter's 21st Birthday, and we wanted somewhere not too far from Dublin, but somewhere special, to celebrate the occasion.
We were not disappointed. The Hotel management had a bottle of prosecco waiting for my daughter in her room, and they had upgraded us to a suite. It meant we had two bedrooms and a lovely sitting room cum dining room, between them. The rooms were spacious and well equipped, with decent large tvs with dvd players. They was a dvd library with a good selction of movies available. The furniture and décor in the rooms was very stylish and comfortable. 
The bar and restaurant were good too, and the breakfasts were really enjoyable. We had dinner in Hugo's fine dining restaurant and it was excellent. The pool, sauna and steam rooms were spotless and really well laid out.
Our rooms overlooked the golf course, which meant that we were looking out at immaculate greens and fairways through the trees which surround the hotel. This was really nice to wake up each morning and see the sun shining through the woodlands.
All the staff were so friendly and helpful.
All in all, a truly memorable stay.",5,2018,03,27
238,"Beautiful hotel, wonderful staff ","The staff in this hotel were 2nd to none for friendliness and for making you feel they knew you. I cannot remember all their names but Stefan on reception was great, the concierge whose name I didn't get but he had a northern Ireland accent was so knowledgeable about the hotel and nothing was too much hassle and also Katie in the spa who was my therapist for my Indian head massage was wonderful.
The hotel itself is beautiful, unfortunately they were doing works on the hotel which left a very strong smell in the bar but there was nothing they could do about that. 
The food was Beautiful, we had dinner in the bar both nights and it was fab. 
Overall we just had a wonderful 2 night stay in this hotel and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a break away from it all. ",5,2018,03,16
238,Take part in wedding ,"I was Participated in a wedding here for two days,wonderful view and comfortable room and lounge area,nice dinner and breakfast as well!!!if chance I would stay more night to enjoy swimming poor and gym ❤️",5,2018,03,11
238,Hugo ruined everything!! Blame him on the missing star..,"Friday night, myself and my wife, dinner and breakfast, €200.00. And worth every penny., or so we thought.

Check-in:
From the minute you arrive, you know this is special.
Greeted by a friendly and helpful doorman.
Actually all the staff are efficient and friendly without being pretentious or condescending, a common problem I find in good hotels but not here. Check in is quick and an enjoyable experience. Free hot cider and a warm towel to greet you.

Room:
Room is spacious, spotless, fully equipped. Beautiful view of golf course. Bottle of prosecco and chocolates arrive shortly after. Fridge, water, tea, coffee, it’s all here.
Bathroom has bath and a shower.
Plugs at bedside table for charging phone, you would be amazed how many hotels don’t have this.

Pool and Spa:
So down for a swim. The spa must be 10 years old but it looks brand new, it is spotless. You don’t need to bring anything except swimming shorts, everything is provided. Plenty of staff. Large swimming pool, jacuzzi, steam room and sauna. Sauna and steam are large and spacious. If you dare there is also a large plunge pool.

Add to this warm showers with proper controls, no annoying auto shut off buttons.
Changing rooms fully equipped. There is even a machine to dry your shorts and hat. A plastic bags to carry them. All towels, etc are provided. It was a blissful experience.

Dinner at Hugo’s restaurant;
It all goes horribly wrong. The food is quite simply terrible. Devoid of flavour.
I got whiskey salmon to start, 4 slivers of salmon so thin I could see the pattern of the plate through them. No whiskey flavouring at all! Took me 2.3 seconds to finish the dish.
My wife got pulled duck with barley. While it tasted good it looked like a lump of unappetising porridge.
For mains my wife got mushroom risotto, stodge on a plate. Inedible, she returned it after the 20 minutes it took to get servers attention,
My pork belly was dry as a bone, I’ve eaten better flavoured paper.
Now we complained, the reaction was good, they offered us an Irish coffee as recompense. Sorry we accepted.
Dessert arrived after 30 mins, we had to beg for the coffee.
Was it just us?!?!?
We arrived at 8:00, left at 10:20, we spent about 15 minutes of that time eating. Couple beside us arrived 40 minutes after us but left at same time???
His pork looked juicy! Who was managing the pass?!?
Overall.... horrible horrible experience. The chef single handedly ruined a perfect day.

The Bar:
Was full, but lobby was beautiful and got a good seat. This is without doubt a beautiful hotel.
Entertainment was a very talented guy & guitar. Drink is not cheap, see bill below.

Breakfast:
Without doubt one of the best breakfast out there.
Well staffed, great egg and pancake station. Great selection, whatever your taste for breakfast, they have it here.

So Hugo’s tasteless food spoiled what would have been a perfect weekend.
Would still recommend you visit:
",4,2018,03,10
238,Excellant,"Stayed here with my mother and sister during the week. Right from booking to checkout the staff were warm and helpful. Silvia in reservations looked after us, even when we had to change our date twice - she was always more than willing to assist and advise of available dates. The receptionists on check in were so welcoming and really made sure we were informed of all facilities in the hotel. We had food in the bar in the evening and it was delicious. The hotel has a lovely cosy reception and we were able to relax there in comfort after our meal.I made use of the leisure centre, it was clean with great facilities including an aroma steamroom. Breakfast in the morning had so much on offer Only one small thing i could say negative is that the pillows and mattress were very soft, but i think this could be personal taste. All in all a wonderful stay, and we hope to visit again in the future. Thank you Silvia, Adrienne (on reception) and all staff throughout for a truly wonderful stay - Catherine",5,2018,03,09
238,Amazing getaway!,"Myself and my partner stayed here for one night in February. We arrived early however this wasn't an issue as the very nice lady at the reception desk said our room was ready and proceeded to check us in. We were given beautiful heated lavender cloths upon check in - a nice added touch! We were guided to our room by the helpful gentleman on the door.

The room itself was very well decorated and was very spacious! The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was spacious and clean. We went to 'The Thirteenth Bar' for a few drinks which is currently partially closed over for some renovations but still was very relaxing. We booked a table in the restaurant for dinner which was absolutely beautiful. The setting was very relaxing and the food was delicious, as was the wine! 

We moved into the bar after dinner where there was great live music. 

Unfortunately we didn't have any time during our stay to make any use of the facilities, which is a good excuse for another visit to this amazing hotel!

The breakfast was also beautiful, with a wide range of food available to suit everyone. Fresh honey, fresh fruit, yoghurts, bread, cereals, smoothies, sausages, bacon, eggs, you name it they had it! 

Overall a beautiful hotel with amazing, helpful and friendly staff. Will definitely be back again to try out the spa!",5,2018,03,08
238,Birthday visit,"Had a fabulous night away here for my partners birthday. Was upgraded to a suite and the room was amazing, we had a really magical time. Enjoyed the leisure facilities too. Didn't eat in the hotel this time but will definitely be back. Very happy overall. ",5,2018,03,07
238,Fantastic stay,"We had a great stay in this family friendly luxurious hotel. The public areas have recently been renovated with ongoing work to the conservatory area at the minute and the place looks better than ever. We found the room, food and drinks in the restaurant and bar all to be fantastic. Brilliant child friendly touches like a kitchenette available , indoor play room, DVD library and board games all were great. Staff all friendly and helpful.",5,2018,03,06
238,Five star experience!,"Everything about this hotel is wonderful. The service is impeccable and we always felt catered to. The room was large, spotlessly clean, comfortable, and up-to-date. We thoroughly enjoyed the king size bed. We wanted a few extra pillows and after a quick call to the front desk, a friendly staff member brought them to our door within minutes. I didn’t utilize the bathtub but the shower was luxurious. My husband and I also really enjoyed the restaurant and bar located in the hotel. They have a good beer selection and the food is delicious. Our servers were always happy to ask what we liked and make suggestions. Druid’s Glen is easily one of my favorite hotels. We will absolutely be back!",5,2018,03,04
238,Spa = Amazing!,"Myself and my partner stayed for 1 night and made use of the spa which was AMAZING! Paula was looking after me and listened to exactly what I wanted from the “druids signature treatment”. I would highly recommend this treatment and Paula (Thanks again!). Our bedroom was beautiful and spacious( it had 3 double beds). We arrived at the hotel at 2pm and our room was not ready. Our spa treatments were booked for 2.30pm so we asked could our room keys be dropped to the spa, they accommodated straight away. Later in the evening while in the room, chocolates (butlers) and an apology card were delivered apologising for our room not being ready which was a really good touch! That evening, we decided to have dinner and drinks in the bar as opposed to the restaurant which was lovely. Although this was a really nice night away, I believe the hotel could do with additional lounge rooms in the hotel as there’s only the bar or lounge area by the lobby. ",4,2018,03,04
238,It is so nearly excellent but the bath. ,"Greeted very warmly by the staff. Room large and lovely and great view our over the golf course. Yes you could see building works. 
Bathroom looks lovely with brown marble tiles etc. But bath raised and narrow. I am over 6 ft and ageing. But with just two support handles at low level, difficult to sit down easily. Also difficult to double up to be able to reach the bath taps. But worst was how to get out with ease and comfort. As the two bath handles are so low I and my wife could not use them to stand upright. Reversed to back end of bath to try to raise myself to sitting on the rear lip of the bath,  got there, but lip so small and towel rail just where your head was and I slipped back into bath. ONLY way to get out! was to turn onto my face, which, was nearly in the water, using my elbows got up onto my knees and avoiding towel rail was able to stand upright. But as the bath is raised up and bath handles are low level, the step out onto the lower level floor precarious( I actually had to come into bath room to hold my wife’s arm as she got out of the  bath.) I think the bathrooms may be due an upgrade, when they are, the manager really needs to get a redesign. 
One other quibble, at Breakfast on Tuesday the egg chef disappeared off for quite a time and I had to call over the breakfast supervisor and ask him to go and find the chef for a poor guest who had been standing waiting for quite a while . There was no egg chef on duty on the Wednesday morning, just the usual floppy buffet scrambled eggs. 
Staff are friendly and courteous and setting special, if you are going for golf,  a wedding or for a special purpose you will love it but there are those couple of things that could be improved to make it exceptional. ",4,2018,03,02
238,Amazing spa,Had a lovely stay in this hotel. Gorgeous grounds and golf course. Spa treatment was amazing would definitely recommend booking in. Bar food wasn't great and was pricey. If I was to return I would go for the early bird in the restaurant instead. This hotel has lots of families and children around so if going as a couple I would recommend going when the schools are not on holidays. Great stay overall.,4,2018,03,01
238,Fab again,"Stayed here Valentines week. Cannot overstate how on point everything was. The check in staff were so friendly, we were stayed in the Most Fantastic suite. Gary at the bar really looked after us and we had a fabulous meal at the restaurant. Splashed out on chateaubriand and it was AMAZING, breakfast was outstandingas usual. We really enjoyed all the facilities and the gym. Was nice to have a kid free time in the pool also. Already cannot wait for my next trip to this little bit of luxury on our doorstep!!!!",5,2018,02,28
238,lovely stay with kids,"I stayed here for  He night with my mum and two kids. Everything was perfect from arrival to check out. Staff were lovely, room was perfect and the food was spot on. We went mid week so it was quiet the kids had the run of the playroom and the playground outside was great as well. Would have loved to have spent another night my son even cried on the way home because he wanted to stay. I didn’t find the renovations too noisy. One thing to note there is no kids pool so maybe bring the arm bands!",5,2018,02,21
238,Girls night away,"My mam, sister and I stayed in this hotel for a night in January. It is very close to Dublin yet you feel you are away from it all as the hotel is out in the country on a golf course. We booked the spa for treatments which were nice. I cant comment on the pool as i didn't venture there. We had dinner in the bar that night, the bar is being renovated so we were directed to the breakfast room which I found lacked atmosphere and was very sparse. Food was OK, nice but not wow. Bedrooms were large and the beds were comfortable. Breakfast next morning had a great selection and we sat in the conservatory area which was nice. Over all it was convenient for a night away, but felt a few things were missing. I would return though.",4,2018,02,20
238,Baby moon bliss,"We stayed here a few weeks back and it was fantastic. The room was in beautiful condition with complimentary water, tea and coffee. We used the pool both days and my wife had a spa also which she thoroughly enjoyed. I went for a jog a to the club house which is about 6k out and back. I can honestly say the food here was second to none. The breakfast buffet had everything. And I mean everything. Superb. And Hugo’s restaurant for an evening meal is a must. Real fine dining. But the best thing about druids glen are the staff. Outstanding. From front desk staff, to swimming pool to restaurant staff. ",5,2018,02,19
238,"Very comfortable, excellent service and lovely staff","I have stayed at the Druids Glen Hotel numerous times now. The rooms are very comfortable, clean and spacious. The food in the restaurant is top quality. Everything tastes fresh and is made with care and attention to detail. The staff is probably the best you will come across, in particular Barbara and Gita who took such good care of me each morning. I can honestly say that everyone here has been very accommodating and friendly, always greeting me with a smile and making sure to provide an exceptional service every time.  

I would definitely recommend this hotel if you're looking for a relaxing time in this beautiful part of Ireland.",5,2018,02,19
238,Great food,Have gone here a few times over the last couple years for lunch and the food is excellent .. especially the chicken wings and the BBQ pulled pork sandwich with goat cheese! Service is usually very good save for one incident but I think the waitress was new and only just getting the hang of things and was still very friendly and apologetic after getting an order wrong! ,4,2018,02,18
238,"Great hotel, disappointing restaurant","The hotel and staff were great. Only negative was restaurant. Poor range of food, badly cooked. They need a new chef. Grossly overpriced for what we got. Breakfast was great , just dinner was awful- on 2 separate nights",4,2018,02,16
238,Lovely family friendly break,"This is not our first stay here, it's always a pleasure to return. This time some renovations underway but noise and disruption barely noticeable. As the kids were on mid term the hotel had plenty to do. Face painting, movies, DVD and board games available at reception We booked the kids in for 'high tea' which includes playtime dinner and a movie from 6 until 9.30. The kids really enjoyed it and we loved the time to ourselves to have dinner and a drink. Breakfast was well organised with lots of variety available.

All in all a great stay. It lovely to see a hotel cater for families without compromising on service. The staff here are friendly and very helpful. Well done all.",5,2018,02,16
238,Great choice,"It was a toss up between Druids Glen and Powerscourt for my wifes 50th birthday break, and as our youngest daughter was coming with us, we went for Druids Glen as we had heard it was probably the most child friendly of the two hotels, and it turned out to be the perfect choice.

We arrived on Sunday afternoon and check in was very efficient and a very pleasant experience, the reception staff were lovely, as were the rest of the staff may I add.
Our room on the 3rd floor was just perfect and my daughter had a whole double bed all to herself. The room also boasted a Nespresso coffee machine, a large flat screen television with all the sky sports channels, a bonus for me as I was able to watch Newcastle beating Man Utd ... just thought i'd mention it.
The room size was ample as was the bathroom and the L'occitane toiletries were a lovely touch.
The staff also laid on a lovely card and a box of chocolates for my wife as a birthday gift which were well received.

We ate from the bar menu at night and sat out in the foyer/lounge area where there was plenty of room to enjoy our meal and drinks ... the food was of a really high standard by the way.

Breakfast for us as a family is always a must at a hotel and this was probably the best we have ever had from a hotel in relation to the choice and the quality, we easily sat for an hour and a half each morning and just enjoyed the experience ... give a special mention the ""Gita"" please for her lovely warm personality and attention to detail.

We treated ourselves to afternoon tea on Monday and it was just lovely, a great selection of sandwiches, scones and pastries and endless amounts of coffee and tea, I would reccommend this as a treat.

All in all we had a great time, we went swimming, had a lovely walk around the woods/trail to the golf club and back and just relaxed the rest of the time.
You have a really nice hotel, lovely friendly helpful staff and we would not hesitate to reccommend it to friends and family and we will definitely return at a later date with my other 2 daughters for another family break, thank you.",5,2018,02,15
238,Amazing Family Break,"Had a really enjoyable two night stay with my wife and 18 month old son. The staff were very attentive and pleasant, and we never felt out of place with having a young active boy with us. The staff who looked after breakfast were especially excellent. The facilities are great with plenty of space in the family guestroom and the kids play room was great. The swimming pool was ideal with well lots of family swimming time allowed (not just a couple of hours which you get in some hotels). The only slight issue I had was the quality of the food coming from the bar (considering the price). All in all a great stay and we will definitely be back.",5,2018,02,13
238,Staff,1st time at the hotel for a birthday party and from the time we arrived the staff were so helpful. At the meal our waiter Colm could not have done anymore for us he did do much with patience and professionalism. During the evening all the bar staff were so helpful I would definitely  go back again. Thank you,5,2018,02,12
238,Perfect!,"Just back from a two night stay from this top class excellent hotel
On arrival we were greeted by a lovely lady who told us we had got a complimentary upgrade, she was so friendly and informed us of what was on in the hotel over the weekend and the beautiful walks in there grounds
We got complimentary apple cider which was lovely and hot lavender towels to freshen up.  A very friendly porter carried our bags to the room for us.  The room itself was an  excellent suite which had a lovely open fire and sitting room. We got room service dinner in our room the first night. It was delivered quickly up to us and the burger was of high quality and very tasty
The next morning we went to the spa and I got the best massage I have had yet, we relaxed in the relaxation room afterwards with our sorbet which was very nice 
That evening we had dinner in Hugo’s restaurant,again food was of great quality and service was very good. Afterwards we went to the hotel bar which had live music and a good crowd 
We had a great nights sleep and great breakfast both mornings. The first morning we got breakfast in bed which was delivered on time and hot.
Overall it’s a great hotel with great facilities along with top class very friendly and helpful staff 
Looking forward to returning again ",5,2018,02,12
238,Top Class Hotel,Really like this hotel. Stayed with partner & 3 year old son - plenty of things to occupy the little ones including an Activity Room. Food was really nice in the bar. Large rooms. Really Family Friendly. Hopefully get to play some golf the next time :-),5,2018,02,12
238,Disappointed won't be returning ,"I visited Druids Glen to celebrate my birthday and I requested a nice room with a good view and the reservations office did promise to get me a nice room.To say I was shocked is an understatement I was angry and felt insulted.They intentionally gave me the worst room on the first floor close to the play room,kids crying and screaming at 8 a.m. The room itself looked shabby with old worn out gowns and an old grape behind the curtains.Then we went for dinner in the evening it got even worse,we were seated in the cold balcony area it took over an hour for the food to be served to make things worse the staff did not even acknowledge my birthday despite them knowing,instead they sang for 2 other customers sitting next to me. what a let down.Not exactly what I hoped my birthday weekend to be.",3,2018,02,10
238,Enjoyable Stay,"Had a golf package with our stay in October and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves in most aspects. The golf was terrific despite the cold biting wind. The resort itself is situated on beautiful grounds in rural County Wicklow with an abundance of woodlands, and wildlife (pheasants, swans, waterfowl..) which make it all the more special. 
Our accommodations were fine--spacious room with attractive furnishings and good amenities. Breakfasts were standard fare but our one attempt at dinner was so so. We were there on a weekend so the place was quite busy and overrun with families and runabout small children. They also had a large wedding adding to commotion. That being said, we still enjoyed our stay and if we were to return to Ireland we would definitely consider another golf outing here.",4,2018,02,09
238,5* Spa Treatment,"Spent a wonderful afternoon here recently! Had an amazing relaxing spa treatment! The staff were so friendly (in particular Michelle) and the facial was superb! A big thank you to Andreas, my skin was glowing afterwards and was so hydrated! The Elemis Superfood moisturiser is fantastic! Truly the best facial I've ever had, will definitely return!",5,2018,02,09
238,Amazing resort ,"Everything about this resort was incredible, the hotel was so welcoming, very happy and polite staff, our room was so clean and high standards, Elemis products which are the best . Breakfast so tasty and you get a variety of quality foods, thanks Valentin (the chef from breakfast) for the best omelette. Dinner in the Hugo restaurant was so classy and the atmosphere was perfect, good food , excellent service. I’ve used their spa and it was great, so clean, spacious, luxurious and great staff. It’s so worthy to get a treatment booked , they are using Elemis products which they are 100% organic and very good for your skin and they have amazing therapists. Katie is the best , I had an incredible Biotec treatment and I can say that her techniques were so perfect, she is a professional, also very kind, polite and great knowledge about all the products. Thanks Katie , I will be back in 2 weeks 😜",5,2018,02,01
238,Lovely mini break,"Just returned from another lovely 2 night stay in Druids Glen. We had a Groupon deal so this made it very affordable. The hotel has been refurbished since our last stay so it was nicer than usual with still the smell of new carpet. The colour scheme in the lobby is lovely and the furniture comfortable - such a lovely area to relax. On arrival we were given hot towels and lovely warm apple cider. This was a lovely touch. Part of our deal was Prosecco on arrival and this was brought to the room immediately along with a small box of Butlers chocolates. The staff at reception and the concierge were so welcoming and very efficient. We were also given an upgrade to a superior rooms which we were delighted with.
We ate in the bar on the first evening and our meal was lovely. Again,very friendly and helpful bar staff. 
The breakfast selection and freshness of produce is second to none.
Unfortunately there was a problem with water contamination in the Wicklow area during our stay but the hotel responded promptly and provided bottled water for cleaning teeth and drinking and used bottled water to make ice for drinks.
I love this hotel and will continue to return again and again and recommend to friends.
Keep up the hood work.",5,2018,01,30
238,Still the best! ,Just home from another great weekend in druids Glen. Place is being renovated but this didn't effect our stay in any way. Staff super friendly. Nice touch in the room with box of butlers chocs and a little personalised card to welcome us back. Air con in the gym could do with some updating. It's extremely warm even now in Jan. Breakfast selection is as good as ever. Great options if you want to keep it healthy or just go nuts! Can't wait to go back already. ,5,2018,01,28
238,A mixed bag,"We decided to treat ourselves to a two night stay just after Christmas, and decided to travel not to far from Dublin for a change so we picked the Druids based on previous reviews.
On arrival the welcome was warm and check in seamless.
However our stay was a bit mixed review wise so lets do the positive first.
The staff in all departments are fabulous, they all great you  and are helpful.
The room was fantastic, we had asked for a quiet room and that's what we got , plus really nice, spacious with a really comfortable bed and lovely bathroom all that you would expect from a hotel of this quality.
The spa and swimming pool are equally fab with staff to match.
The breakfast is wonderful .
I liked the bar but would love to see some cosy alcoves as it got very busy.
Now for the bad point :
for our first night we prebooked the restaurant for 8pm.
We got there at about eight, there was a queue at the reception desk for tables, which was fine ,they were busy I get that, but it took ten minutes to be seated,without being offered a seat till ready or a drink.
Then ourselves and the couple in front were seated at two tables which we could see from where we were waiting and they were ready and set for arrivals so why the wait?
On being seated we were informed there was a wait for menus but were not asked would we like a drink.
The menus were brought after ten minutes we were not asked if we would like an apertif.
Then they came to take the order at the same time advising on the daily specials.
We ordered our food and apertifs and wine.
While still drinking our apertifs, the waitress came with the wine and we were asked ""would you like to taste or shall I just pour""   sorry what ! at 40 euro a bottle I expect a slightly better quality of service.
There seemed to be quite a few clients nearby who were not happy.
The starters came and were tiny, I had chosen mine as it mentioned poached pear which I love , there were 3 tiny slivers of poached pear on the plate no bigger than your little finger. My husbands beetroot infused s.salmon was no bigger.
Each course necessitated a long wait, the mains faired slightly better,I chose pork fillet this was luke warm at best, made more noticeable by the piping hot roast cherry tomato and potato gratin.
The flavours were good but not up to standard with the supposed quality of the restaurant, desserts were fine.
We finally left at 23.30, along three and a half hours mostly spent waiting.
Overall a very disappointing experience when everywhere else in the hotel was of a good standard.
The following night needless to say, we chose to eat in the bar, which was a far more relaxing and cheerful option, although the food was barfood at best, the staff were wonderful, loved the nibbles of cheese and beetroot.
Sorry guys but frozen chips should not be served in a hotel of this quality they should be homemade!
",4,2018,01,25
238,Lovely Sunday stay,"Booked on the hotel website for one night  B&B with Dinner in Restaurant.

Beautiful hotel, less than an hour from Dublin.
Food was excellent, empty plates all round.
Staff are probably the best hotel staff we have ever came across, very friendly throughout the hotel.

We will be back..",5,2018,01,24
238,Perfect Getaway,"My mother and I visited the Druid’s Glen for a one night getaway and it was absolutely fabulous!
Traffic was heavy on the way to the hotel and we were running late for the appointments we booked in the spa so we rang ahead and they said they would try there best to fit us in. Upon arrival it was clear that the spa was extremely busy but we were still able to be squeezed in with no fuss made. My therapist was Dara (who was excellent!!) and I had the Elemis bio tech facial, it was an amazing experience and very relaxing. 
Our dinner in the restaurant was out of this world. Our room was spotless and beautifully decorated. I could find no fault in any aspect of our stay!
Overall, this hotel ticks all the boxes for a luxurious, relaxing getaway with very helpful, friendly and happy staff!",5,2018,01,20
238,Amazing stay using Cyber Monday deal,"We really enjoyed our stay there. Everything was good. Saunas clean, swimming pool warm. Spacious room. Really enjoyed the afternoon tea experience. Dinner in restaurant was tasty and well presented, staff very polite and helpful.

Bonus points to hotel: They have Type2 charging point available.

All in all enjoyed the stay, but would not pay full price for what I've got. We stayed there with Cyber Monday deal or alike. Good value.",5,2018,01,19
238,Girls night ,"My friends and I stayed here for one night and it's a lovely hotel. We stayed on a Monday in December which meant the place was quiet but we enjoyed the night very much. The staff were helpful, the beds were super comfortable and the spa was really nice. The breakfast set up was very impressive and we were served breakfast which I always find a lovely touch, as you're not queueing or waiting for trays to be refilled. My one negative is that the bar, where we ate dinner, was a bit cold despite the lovely fire. I'm already looking forward to visiting again with my fiance. ",5,2018,01,18
238,Fabulous “staycation “,Myself my husband and little boy stayed here for two nights in January. Instead of going foreign we chose to stay in Ireland for our holidays . Our trip was short but extremely sweet. I’m so glad I took the recommendations of my colleagues because this hotel does not disappoint. We were welcomed with lavender hand clothes after our journey and offered a wide selection of children dvds and colouring packs for our son. A well stocked play room kept him occupied as well as us(air hockey table) . We really enjoyed the pool during children’s hours.. (you can always go during adult only times if want to avoid the kids). Food was really good albeit slightly expensive but that’s what your going to pay in 5 star. Really comfortable room with luxuries products and plenty of space. But what really stood out for me was the atmosphere of the hotel and this is created by the staff. They really are so friendly and cannot do enough for you taking a genuine interest in our family without being over the top . I love this hotel and will def be going back !maybe just me and my husband next time so I can take advantage of the spa facilities etc . Overall a wonderful two days.,5,2018,01,11
238,Disappointing ,"We stayed 29th December for one night two adults and three kids.

The hotel was packed. The bar lounge area you can not book tables for food so as a family of 5 it was difficult getting table as parties of 2/3/4 were taking up areas for 5/6/7. So we had to pull chairs manoeuvre tables etc to find a seat for lunch. Lunch came no knifes , forks no ketchup for the kids . So my husband and I ran around grabbing these items .

We then had dinner reserved for 7.30. Hotel was so busy so it was the only available time and i did say we would take a cancellation if one came up for an earlier sitting.

We waited 50minutes on starters and kids food. Again no steak knife no ketchup for kids no spoon for baby bowl. We had to follow up on bread we were offered. Then we waited a further 40 minutes for our main. By this stage kids were tired we couldn’t wait anymore so had to ask for food to be sent up to the room which they did.

Very disappointing from one of my favourite hotels . It really made our stay quite difficult with such a large family then late bedtimes and hungry kids was not a good combination. So we are our food in 2 minutes in our room as we had to get everyone to bed.

I emailed the hotel and was disappointed  to just have an apology and an offer of a discounted stay again. But they are discounting stays  anyway so this is not a good offer. We spent €500 on that night and it was a waste. Will not return. ",1,2018,01,11
238,Bit disappointed with stay!,"Stayed at Druids Glen for one night during January.  Room was lovely and plenty of space.   Bed was extremely comfortable and staff were very friendly.  We were given early check in as I had spa treatments booked so was very grateful for that.  Unfortunately the food in the bar was a disappointment.  I had wings early in the afternoon and they were ok.  Not exactly hot but I ate them anyway,  my husband enjoyed the soup he ordered.  Evening meal in the bar was disappointing.  Haddock was very poor standard. It was dry and resembled frozen fish.   Mentioned this to waitress and manager apologised and gave us complimentary drinks.  Again my husband was happy with his duck.  The tiramisu dessert was dry and my apple pie wasn't too my liking. It was a bowl of apple with puff pastry sitting on top.  It tasted slightly sour.  I enjoyed the facial and massage but as mentioned in another review the staff continually  walking through the relaxation room takes away from what it should be.   Overall I enjoyed the stay and treatments and if the bar food was a tad better it would have been perfect. ",4,2018,01,10
238,Poor spa facilities with crowds of children,"The hotel itself is really nice, nothing out of this world but still a great place to stay with some comfort and luxury. The spa facilities, however, leave a lot to be desired. After getting our massages (which were excellent, and the staff is also amazing) and resting a bit in the relaxation room, we went down to the pool area... What a disappointment! The place consists essentially of one small swimming pool and one small Jacuzzi. There were only 2 chaise lounges. And the place was absolutely crowded with children of all ages, screaming, crying and flouncing around. We couldn't stay there for more than a few minutes, it was absolutely stressful, and it baffles me why the hotel should allow children in the spa areas at all. If you're looking for a quiet day of relaxation, Druids Glen spa is definitely not your place! Also, the changing rooms were smelly and cramped, and not even shower gel is provided in the showers. Such a contrast to the rest of the hotel, with large rooms and L'Occitane toiletries. Very disappointing.",2,2018,01,05
238,Superb Area - spoil yourself,"We spent our last night of our vacation here and thoroughly enjoyed the fancy hotel and stay. We would not have spent our own money to stay here but it was a part of our package which we booked, so we took advantage. If you want a little slice of heaven, spoil yourself here and enjoy the place.

We had the night time dinner BBQ on the patio which was quite delicious and had lots of choices to pick from!",5,2018,01,04
238,Not for Couples......only for families with kids,"Myself and my partner stayed in the hotel on the 1st of January 2018 for one night. We were really looking forward to a chilled out stay after the Christmas madness. 
Check in was very efficient and the reception staff were very friendly and welcoming. 
We had lunch in the bar and again the staff were very friendly and the food tasty if a little expensive. 
Our room was beautiful and we had a stunning view. 
But unfortunately the place was completely overun with children whose parents didn't care what they were doing. During dinner in the bar there were children running around tables and screaming. We then went to the seating area near the main reception and we felt like we had walked into a creche. We have never experienced anything like the running, shouting and screaming of children before in a hotel until after 11pm. Some were even in there pyjamas jumping down stairs. Then we had to listen to the patents shouting back at them. At no stage did hotel staff intervene. I nearly tripped over Lego a number of times in public areas of the hotel. The toilets were a mess as children had obviously being messing in them and all the toliet roll was pulled out and on the floors. 
We were so disappointed and I will never stay in this hotel again. It's really only for families with children. ",3,2018,01,04
238,Failed to meet expectations ,"We stayed here last year over the holidays and we were absolutely impressed at the service, standard, warmth and charm ... not to mention the excellent food. We rebooked for the holidays again this year and had a lovely stay however we leave with a sense of being underwhelmed. The check in lacked the wow factor compared to last year and the food in the bar seemed to be really disjointed and slow. We would have looked past this if it had only been the 1 night but the same experience over 2 nights in the restaurant. Food at the current standard and price is super inflated and really not worth it. We really hope this wonderful place can get its wow factor back!! ",3,2018,01,04
238,A little bit of heaven ,"Myself and my wife have stayed in Druids Glen on a number of occasions and have always been amazed at how the hotel is improving the staying experience for the guests at the moment the hotel is expanding the Thirteenth Bar and Pavilion lounge which will be completed in March 2018 and we have no doubt it will have the wow factor - myself and my wife would normally go abroad for a week late spring but are strongly considering returning to Druids Glen instead this year its got everything two great golf courses which have hosted the irish open in the past and are a challenge for all levels of golfers i play myself and have played both the glen which is a very scenic course and the Heath which has the links feel and has had at lot of upgrading of greens and the course in general.  Another wonderful feature of the hotel is the spa. As my wife is not a golfer it is a huge advantage to have this facility on hand and each and every time my wife visits the spa she can only compliment the staff and the fantastic treatments provided. The only way she can describe each visit is time out in a beautiful oasis!  Lastly and we feel most importantly the staff and attention given to us cannot be put into words.  From the moment you arrive being met by the charming porters to the very pleasant and helpful reception staff and all the way through to the waiting and bar staff you could not ask for better attention and service. In one line Druids Glen is a little bit of heaven that you can step into for a weekend away and not want to leave once you've arrived!

To the management, staff and all responsible for the wonder that is Druids Glen THANK YOU!

Kind regards 
Pat and Anita Kenny ",5,2018,01,01
238,World-class venue - the Irish Fort Augusta!,"Stayed here for a wedding reception and have to say it was absolutely superb. Highly professional check in (not just luggage delivered to room but lavender infused hot towels to warm your hands on arrival!) and an outstanding wedding reception, food, drink & venue wise. Breakfast was sumptuous. Also went to the “clubhouse” in Woodstock House, so elegant and impressive, and again, great food. Staff were faultless throughout. Druids has been described as the Irish Fort Augusta and I’d agree - it’s truly a world-class venue.",5,2017,12,31
238,Rooms with a very disappointing view!!,"Our extended family of 16 spent two lovely nights in Druid’s Glen with our elderly father.  He was most unhappy with the rooms allocated 101 and 103 - directly overlooking a building site with broken glass in the window- not what you would expect from a 5 star hotel.  He brought this to the attention of staff both days and was not happy with the response.  
The bar service on the first night was very poor, they did apologies for the 40 minute delay on food orders and replace the cold food they served. 
On a positive note the restaurant was exceptional on our second night and the spa treatments were fantastic.",3,2017,12,30
238,Mostly excellent but overpriced,"This was our second trip to Druid's Glen for my girlfriend's birthday. A great spot with excellent facilities, the highlight being the gym/spa which is a lot better than typical hotel facilities. However, after paying over €400 for 2 nights, you would expect to get breakfast included and we unfortunately we had to pay €15 each per day for breakfast. The staff were very friendly and helpful, especially the man at the door, Tadhg. All in all, an excellent spot. ",4,2017,12,29
238,Afternoon Tea,"Booked Afternoon tea yesterday 27-12-17 (charged at 58 euros) which was a totally unsatisfying experience for a 5 star facility. We made a booking for 2pm and after waiting around for 15 minutes for any staff at all to tend to us we were brought to a table in an open glassed dining area beside the dining room that was freezing to say the least we kept our coats on....we mentioned this to the waiter who said there wasnt anyother seating and the heat was fully on and eventually a waitress who brought us to another seat in the dining area close to the gas fire. 

We were served (without being asked or consulted on our options of food if we just wished for sweet or savory or both, drink or glass of champagne was never mentioned) a small plate of savory tiny sandwich type with minimal food content including white lettuce that had minimal effort. Worst of all the cups of coffee were just abouts warm, we were not given a pot of coffee to help ourselves, the waiter brought out new cups before the sweet tray was delivered and then 10 mins later the waitress came out with full cups of coffee again luke warm and had to take away what the other waiter brought out. There definitely seemed to be a rashioning on the coffee and waiting for it to be served luke warm was definitely a treat NOT! worth waiting for. Staff just seemed to not know what they were doing or communicating with eachother and personified an attitude they couldnt care either way. However when you charge 58 euros for that terrible service Druids glen will not have my custom again. You would get better value and service in a local coffee shop for a fraction of the price. However, i will say they offered a 10 euro reduction in the bill but even at that 48 euros for afternoon tea with 'no service' and savory food that wasn't up to scratch was still 48 euros too much...for a so called 5 star facility",1,2017,12,28
238,The most wonderful start to my Christmas,"I can't thank the team at Druids Glen enough for an incredible night away. I surprised my other half for our anniversary and we were treated so we'll throughout the 24 hours we spent at Druids Glen. I had informed the reservations team that it was a special occasion and Karen blew me away with her efficiency  and kindness. We had a card and chocolates waiting in our room as well as being upgraded to a superior room with a late check out. Our meal in Hugos was top class, our waitress was attentive and charismatic and the food was sublime. We spent some time in the bar that night with great music and a lovely festive atmosphere and we were delighted to hear that the pool and leisure facilities were available to us even after check out. We had plenty of time to relax into a food slumber after the ridiculously good breakfast. Druids Glen staff are a credit to the industry - even at Christmas time when hotels are busy beyond belief and in the midst of weddings and serving families, all the staff had a genuine smile and a kind word, they were so approachable and we felt we could rely on everyone we met. We will definitely be back, and hope to furter explore the walks and surrounding countryside next time if we can take ourselves out the door of the heavenly hotel! Thank you again to Romy, Karen, Elaine, Eimear, Jurgita and all at Druids Glen. See you in 2018. ",5,2017,12,24
238,Beautiful hotel,"I am just home after spending a night at the hotel for my birthday and a pre Christmas treat. 
Wow!!! I fell in love with the hotel as soon as I walked through the doors, the concierge who greeted me took my bag and directed me to the front desk to check in. 
Reception staff were welcoming and informative of the services provided.
My room was beautiful and immaculately clean.
I went for dinner in Hugo's and the service from the waiting staff was 1st class.
I ordered fillet steak which was well presented and tasted every bit as good as it looked.
Drinks in the bar were reasonably priced and the bar staff were knowledgeable about the drinks they served, passing on information about the range of whisky on sale.
Breakfast in the morning was of great quality with lots of choice for even the pickiest of eaters. 
There are lots of quiet/seating areas surrounding beautiful open fires throughout the place which creates a lovely atmosphere and spaces for friends to gather.
All in all a beautiful hotel and I will be back as soon as possible! 
Well done to all staff at this hotel, you do an excellent job ",5,2017,12,22
238,Lovely stay,"My daughter  treated me to an overnight stay at Druids Glen Hotel & Golf resort recently. This was our first visit & we were really looking forward to spending some time there.
We were warmly welcomed by the staff at reception & the  concierge  who provided us with hot towels to heat our hands on such a old day
Our room was spacious and  impeccably clean , as was the spacious bathroom. 
We decided to try out the pool with a swim before dinner. This was disappointing, it was nothing special, just a small pool & as there were swimming lessons going on at the time we were there we were limited to one lane.
There was also a sauna & steam too, which were fine.
We ate in the bar that night. Service was great & the staff were extremely friendly. 
Breakfast next morning quite  probably the best I have ever had, the selection was wonderful & you got to  choose from the menu if you wanted a hot breakfast. 

Definitely we both really enjoyed our short break here, and would highly recommend it.

238,A lovely Christmas visit,"Attended a wedding there last Saturday.  Everything about this hotel was great, the rooms, the beds were beautiful,  the service, breakfasts were great but the best thing of all was the staff.  Teague , on reception looked after us so well.  He is a gentleman and so friendly.  At the wedding our waiter was Billy and he went over and above the call of duty with extra teas at the end.  No thing was too much trouble and he was really good fun and extremely helpful.  Unfortunately we just had one night but I will certainly return when we have more time to enjoy this delightful hotel and staff.  It seemed like it was expensive when we booked but for the standard and quality of everything it was well worth it.",5,2017,12,12
238,WHOW!!!  What a place,I have very seldom met people who worked in a hotel who went so far to ensure your stay was hassle free and a great experience. I could rave about them all day. Good hotel made great by its staff. They close the circle on a totally great hotel.,5,2017,12,11
238,Fab experience!,"By far the nest hotel Ibhave stayed in Ireland. Room is clean, bright, big and modern. Was easy to park, swimming pool is great, food in the restaurant os delicious  and the spa treatments fantastic. Couldn't ask for a better way to celebrate my engagement. ",5,2017,12,09
238,Very disappointed never again,"A recent birthday trip to Druids glen was most disappointing. The relaxation room in spa was spoilt by constant traffic of staff in and out. We wanted to book day spa and they messed up the booking so it was just a facial. We were not informed about the choice of drinks available and fruit was hard, inedible. Our bedroom was shabby, curtains frayed, carpet stained, standard of cleaning poor. Room was cold. Breakfast was mediocre, fruit and juices were not fresh and were tinned. Tea was awful. We kept being pestered to order were they in a rush to finish? More staff than customers. Reception staff extremely unhelpful on a booking query. Need a break avoid!",1,2017,12,08
238,WOW WOW WOW,"I booked in on Saturday evening with Adrianne and Tania.They were wonderful! Having driven from Galway, the warm towels and mulled apple cider were very much appreciated. The room was fantastic, so comfortable and relaxing. I was meeting family in the bar for drinks and food. Shauna was our server for the entire evening and I cannot commend her highly enough. She was so friendly and helpful, handled all our varying orders with a smile and was above and beyond for the whole evening. 

Breakfast next morning was absolutely amazing. Jade was particularly helpful with teas and coffee, and Barbara as hostess was very attentive to everyone in the restaurant.  Checkout with Amy and Jo was so smooth and the two bottles of water were absolutely appreciated. It was a fantastic stay from beginning to end. 

It is obvious that your staff love working in the Druids Glen, because everyone was happy and helpful in their work, and the overall feeling was that of being in a family home. Thank you so much for a wonderful time",5,2017,12,05
238,Another fantastic stay,"I unfortunately was only here for 1 night this time. Having been here before, the experience was as superb as my previous visits. I also didn’t get time to visit the lovely spa. The rooms are great and the quality of sleep on those beds is amazing. The food is top notch and never disappoints.  The staff are so friendly and welcoming too. Will be staying here again next year. The Christmas decorations are truly awesome.  Well worth a visit.",5,2017,12,05
238,Superb stay with Druids Glen,"The hotel the grounds the room and the food were all excellent - but the staff were what made the experience exceptional. I stayed 1 night as part of a work function, then another night with my wife and every single member of staff was brilliant. It was the little things they did, how they went out of their way to help and their friendliness. While every single one of them was brilliant, I want to call out a waitress by the name of Min who gave us the most special service. I felt like I was her only customer, she was friendly and attentive and a pleasure to encounter. Well done Druids Glen, you've got customer service right!",5,2017,12,04
238,Vegan food options utterly disappointing ,"First of all, I would like to say that the stay was very nice everything was perfect, beside the food. To be more clear, your vegan options. Yes, there was a vegan menu(which had to be found and brought to me after 10 minutes wait), it was probably just printed. 
I am saying this with all respect, but the food was an utter disappointment. I had the red pepper with couscous, which I only ate half because I was starving after a long day. First of all is the price, which was €18. I understand that it is a 5 star resort and prices like this are expected, but, if you have the courage to charge someone €18 for a small red pepper filled with a bit of couscous, at least make it taste at least decent. These ingredients are some of the cheapest on the market. 
The couscous was very dry and had no taste at all, the pepper, which also had no taste, was burned on top(probably was in the oven at a high temperature). I could easily see that there was no effort at all put into that dish. Nobody expects mind blowing vegan dishes but its really not hard to make at least something decent, especially at that price. I had to go and buy take away food from Greystones because I left hungry and disappointed from your restaurant. 
I hope this information will be useful for your chef. 

Thank you,
Robert B",3,2017,12,02
238,Wedding of a relative;,"I was very impressed by Druids Glen Hotel and Golf Course from the minute I drove inside the entrance. I was not to be dissapointed.The receptionist was very friendly and helpful as were ALL of the staff during our stay there. Very well run hotel,staff properly focused on their customers,nothing any problem. The bedroom,bathroom etc were of a 5 star class.The dinner was excellent.All in all one of the BEST hotels I have ever stayed in. Congrats to Management and Staff.",5,2017,11,28
238,Amazing Hotel ,"Stayed for one night with some of our foreign suppliers. Great hotel, fantastic rooms and the most amazing hospitality from staff. Went to dinner in Druids Golf Club. Hotel dropped us over and back. Food in clubhouse amazing and staff even better. We had a lovely private dining room for the five of us . Well worth a visit for both business and family holiday. Did not have the time to use leisure centre but will next time ! 100% recommendation!",5,2017,11,26
238,All we expected ... and more,"Just back from a family break with our 2 children. We were looking forward to the trip immensely and were not disappointed. Heated, scented towels on arrival at the check in, a warm welcome from the lovely concierge, the most amazing hot stone massage and the very popular Druid's Den were only a few of the highlights. Food in Hugo's was most enjoyable and breakfasts were leisurely and tasty. Didn't venture out in the cold too much, but did manage to hit a few balls at the driving range and enjoyed the walking trail around the golf course, but plenty of chill out time in the Leisure Complex, well appointed foyer and the Thirteenth Bar. Rooms were cosy and the beds were too really comfy, not a sound on the corridors and had a great nights sleep. The option on borrowing DVD's from reception was great for the kids too. We'll definitely be back... looking forward to it already.",5,2017,11,26
238,5 Star Hotel,"We stayed here as a birthday celebration. The hotel has a lovely situation. We had a room overlooking the golf course. Room was very nice, spacious and equipped with everything you might expect from a 5 star hotel. We ate in the restaurant and the food was exceptional.  Breakfast in the mornings was a continental breakfast buffet and/or cooked to order hot breakfast. Again everything was very good. Our only negative was that the room was too hot at night and for obvious reasons only the heating was on the air conditioning was not available. We turned off the fan/heat and opened the windows to allow the room to cool down. In the morning we mentioned the issue and the reception staff had engineering attend the heat issue. They also kept a room available should we not be happy our room. The willingness and attentiveness of the hotel staff to make our experience a pleasurable one was very evident and much appreciated. ",5,2017,11,26
238,Great customer service and staff ,"We took a 3 day break in an executive suite with my wife and 2 young kids. The hotel is kid friendly with nice facilities and most importantly lots of families. We had an issue with the heating in our suite which the staff did their best to resolve. I feel the facilities in the rooms are more 4 star than 5, see attached pictures. The bathroom finish is not up to 5 star standard. However, the staff and management team certainly are. For a small investment his could indeed be a 5 star gem. ",5,2017,11,25
238,2 night midweek,"Stayed for 2 nights midweek in November. Although the hotel was very quiet it is a very impressive building. The staff are excellent and very accommodating. 
The rooms are large and spotless but I found the air con to be a little loud. 
Ate in the bar and it was good and had an excellent buffet breakfast on both mornings. 
Also had the full body massage which was unreal. All in all a top class resort if you are looking for a nice relaxing break away.",4,2017,11,24
238,druids glen resort co wicklow,"my wife and i have just returned from a two night stay in this beautiful 5* hotel. Did not disappoint the hotel delivers on the luxury and comfort advertised .Staff very pleasant and helpful from front of house to serving staff all very friendly and welcoming . Special word of thanks to liz at reception very helpful and great personality to meet and greet .
Great location for visiting the beautiful surrounding areas in co wicklow also very convenient to dublin also . Overall i would highly recommend this hotel for an all round experience and will definitely be back",5,2017,11,24
238,Brilliant Family Stay!,"We stayed here for 3 nights from 16th to 19th Nov. We have two young kids and we all couldn't have been made to feel more welcome...from helpful concierge on arrival to bottles of water being given out to us on check-out for our drive home it was all first class service.

Our family room was perfect for us and the hotel supplied cot was fine for our daughter. We have brought our own mattress for the cot which helped her sleep. We were right beside a baby changing room which had all sorts of useful stuff available..this is a great touch and helps parents with young kids no end.

The hotel facilities were superb. Breakfast was lovely..the pancakes were highlight of our son's stay...and we ate in the bar restaurant two nights...once again staff were great with kids etc and menus were very good. On our final night we had room service and again this was went down a treat.

There was loads to do in the hotel for children; the Druid's Den was a regular hang out for us....loads of games/ softplay/ toys/ video games etc. and the pool was also fantastic. We never even made it to the outdoor play area!

Overall we had a great stay and cannot wait to visit Druid's Glen again.",5,2017,11,20
238,Pleasant stay!,"Lovely hotel with extremely nice rooms and facilities. Friendly and professional reception staff who provide a quick and effortless check in procedure yet provide all you need to know in relation to the hotel, it's amenities, available walks etc. Great breakfast with plenty of choice and good service by efficient staff. The only minor criticism we found was that in the bar there was no table service offered. We sat at a table for 10 minutes or more before realising that we were not going to be offered service without approaching the bar. Not quit 5 star service!",4,2017,11,19
238,"Amazing stay, can’t wait to return! ","Stayed here 16th & 17th November 2017 with the hubbie. Absolutely loved our stay, staff were all so friendly and helpful especially Kevin in the restaurant and I can’t remember the name of lady in reception when we checked in but she was so welcoming and gave us great directions for a lovely walk up to Woodstock House which is about 3k each way and if you’re too tired they will even collect you! Had dinner in Hugos restaurant on the first night and it was absolutely gorgeous, the chocolate sphere dessert was amazing! Im a vegetarian and hubbie is a carnivore and we both enjoyed it all.... Had afternoon tea, the scones and pastries were really lovely but sandwich selection especially the vegetarian ones were very boring.... 
Room was very spacious with good facilities and the bed was so comfy and bedding very luxurious. 
Cant wait to return, might even bring the kids next time as there looks to be good facilities. ",5,2017,11,19
238,Very enjoyable,"Stayed just one night, the staff at reception were excellent, helping to smooth out lack of attention in the kitchen.
The room was large, well equipped and overall decor through the hotel suited the surroundings.
Lots of pleasant relaxing areas around the hotel and the pool area nice and quiet in the evening.
Breakfast area was superb with a nice quality selection of fresh food. Slight downside the the cooked foods were a bit over done, same with the room service food the night before. 
Overall a great stay and especially due to the reception staff",5,2017,11,19
238,Thoroughly enjoyed stay!! ,"We stayed from Monday to Wednesday in November 2017. Reception was good. Very well informed about what was available to us as guests. Also served warm drink and warm cloths by receptionist. Helped with bags to room and parking car! Room was spacious double room with average size bathroom. Shower was really good. Loads of tv channels and also a DVD library at reception that u can help yourself too. Modern & old movies. Had Food in bar first night it was good. Place decorated for Christmas so hung out in front of open fire for few drinks. Second day we went on the hotel resort walking trail. It was 3km on path across their lands skirting the famous Druids Glen golf course you end up at the golf club - Woodstock House. From here we had look around house and had lunch in bar overlooking the golf course and 1st tee. We skipped the offer of resort mini bus back and retraced our route back loads of wildlife. Keep an eye for squirrels near the fairy trail. That evening we went to Health Centre and made good use of pool, jacuzzi etc. Following that we indulged in the Spa. I had the lime and ginger scrub and himself had a massage. Both thoroughly enjoyed same. Ate in restaurant that night. I had crab starter. Yummy! John had salmon starter. Mains we both had steaks. All good and the dessert was chocolate bombs wow!!fab! Our last day we spent on Druids Heath golf course. What a way to finish a great few days. 

Other things to note: Breakfast was good! Tea/coffee facilities in room! Free WiFi! Playground and playroom for kids! Kitchenette on 2nd floor to heat bottles etc. Turn down service! Staff all very friendly. 

Recommend. ",4,2017,11,17
238,Halloween getaway,"Very child friendly hotel with lots of amenities to entertain the little ones. Great walks for a afternoon stroll. Relaxed atmosphere throughout the hotel. Definitely  recommend this for getaway, with great food and wine.",5,2017,11,17
238,Great place to chill out even if you are not a golfer!,"We staid for 2 weekend nights. Spacious modern rooms, great breakfast and top notch food in Hugo's, the hotel's main restaurant. Nice walk with seaviews for those like us who do not play golf.
One hour from Dublin city and you feel that you are in the country side. We went to Mount Usher Gardens. It is also not far from  Avoca for shopping; both 15 minutes drive away from the hotel.",5,2017,11,16
238,Excellent place to spend a night,"Was just taken by her good self for a night here to celebrate my birthday. To put it simply, if you want to treat yourself to a GREAT little break this place should be on your list. From the hot hand towels at reception (yes before we even booked in) ""because it was cold outside"" , to the consistent high level of attention from all the staff (without exception) I loved this place.

Upon arrival the reception gave us a clear and comprehensive overview of all the facilities of the hotel and everything we needed to know to settle in quickly. As we were on a ""chill out"" break we used very few of the hotels many attractions other than the bar and the restaurant but from what we saw and heard from other guests they all lived up to expectations.

If you do go be receptive to staff suggestions. When we went to order our starter (salmon for me and quail for her) the waiter subtly asked did we liked scallops. We had a friendly quick reconsideration of our order but decided to stick to our initial choice. While both our starters were excellent I saw the scallops being served to a neighbouring table and they did look particularly good. I think the waiter was trying to steer us in the right direction and I was sorry I didn't listen.

The rest of the food was equally superb and the little pyrotechnic touch with my dessert made the evening all the more special.

Rooms a spotless, big and with great views over the golf course. The deal we had included sparkly in the room....always a nice touch.

If anyone s looking to get hotel staff trained they should find out who Druids Glen uses and simply use them I cannot compliment the staff enough 

A lovely night spent in a beautiful hotel.",5,2017,11,15
238,Disappointing return,"I had previously stayed at Druids Glen and loved it so much I had to return. Unfortunately the return visit did not meet expectations. The room was perfect, spacious, clean and tastefully decorated. However the hairdryer turned out to be broken, inside elements glowed red and smoky smell was noted. The staff were very apologetic when I drew attention to this. The afternoon tea did not compare to that which I had the previous summer. The sanwiches were dry and bland. The cakes were ok. The scones were the saving grace. The last time I dined at the hotel we ate in the restaurant so we decided to try the bar. I have never experienced such slow bar service. The spicy chicken wings were certainly not hot! They were a dry flavourless disappointment. The burger was quite tasty. The spa was fantastic, the staff were very pleasant and I had a lovely hot stone massage. We used the sauna and steam room afterwards at the pool area. Due to the fact it was midterm, the pool area was overrun with squealing children. Needless to say we didnt stick aroubd long for our ""relaxing"" use of facilities. The breakfast was great in fairness, everything you could imagine and more was available. ",3,2017,11,08
238,Perfect,"My partner and I stayed here for one night recently and from beginning to end we had a wonderful time. We were looking for a relaxing weekend and it was exactly what we wished for. The staff are a credit to the business, friendly and efficient. The Food, breakfast and dinner was amazing, lots to choose from. We also used the spa for some treatments before we headed back home. Our only negative was that we wished we booked a second night. We will certainly be back again. A lovely luxurious getaway.",5,2017,11,08
238,Stunning Views!,"We stayed here the last two nights of our vacation. There's a golf course, a driving range and a walking path through the grounds. At the end of the golf course is the club building and from the second floor you can see all the way to the sea! It was really peaceful and gorgeous.

The rooms were amazing too! The beds were really comfortable and the bath tub was huge! This was one of the nicest hotels I've ever stayed in. I would love to come back and just spend a week here.",5,2017,11,07
238,Amazing comfortable stay,"We just went for one nights stay. We had our 20 weeks baby scan it went well so we decided that we would treat ourselves to a night away. I love this hotel all the staff are really helpful and friendly. The room was really big looking out onto the gardens and the bed was so so comfortable. I had a lovely spa treatment and my husband enjoyed a golf lesson so plenty to do for us both. They also have a wonderful warm swimming pool. Dinner is a little expensive in the main restaurant  but worth it ,my husband has allergies and they catered no problem to his needs. Again breakfast was fab and so fresh. Wish we could have stayed longer maybe next time 😊",5,2017,11,07
238,Home away from home,"Excellent hotel! Great for a weekend get away. Staff is warm and welcoming, the service is 5 star all the way. Always a personal touch. Afternoon tea and diner at readtaurant Hugo are highly recommended. Just love this place!",5,2017,11,07
238,Great service start to finish,"The level of customer service at this fine hotel was second to none from start to finish.
Check in very welcoming - colouring packs for kids and drinks on hand for adults.
Room spacious and very well maintained & nice turn down service.
Bar food and breakfast excellent and staff very attentive, all staff can't do enough for you.
Lovely walk around the grounds and play park for kids.
Bike hire & golf available on site.
Nice pool area - can get very busy during family times.

Will def return. You'll go a long way to find better service.
",5,2017,11,06
238,Food in the 13th bar,"I booked The Druids Glen as a surprise trip for my partner's birthday. I had head great thing about the Hotel and given it's 5 star rating we were really looking forward to the stay. On arriving, we were greeted with a warming smile by Adrienne. 

Later in thr evening, we went for dinner in the 13th bar, and being foodies as we are we had already planned what we were going to order and we were thoroughly looking forward to the meal as being a 5 star hotel we assumed the food would be very good and the experience of dining in The Druids Glen. To our utter disappointment the food was just awful. review restaurants and I can honestly say that this meal was the worst meal I have had in years. We were extremely disappointed and as we love food and enjoy dining out unfortunately this put quute a dampener on our stay. Both of our meals were nothing as we imagined. I opted for the Rigatonni Pasta and Basil dish which wasa pricey €17.50 considering it wasjust a pasta dish with no meat. The tastiest bit of the dish was the small sprinkle of parmesan on top of the dish. It was extremely bland, only slightly warm and it wasn't al dente it was quite undercooked. The ""seasonal roasted veg"" consisted of courgette and green pepper which did not taste roasted. Needless to say I could not finish my meal. My partner opted for the Rogan Josh. This was slightly better however very heavy and creamy and tasted like it was from a jar. As we were both dissatisfied and still hungry we decided we would get a desert between us. We got the Whisky, chocolate bread and butter pudding with vanilla ice cream. This, again was shockingly disappointing. There was a drizzle of chocolate, the bread and butter pudding was extremely hard and there was the tiniest amount of ice cream on the plate. On top of this, the service was very slow and after receiving the bill we were left half an hour before we had to go into the bar area and call the waitress over to pay.

We are not complainers and we enjoy most meals we have but this was really a let down and it certainly had a negative  impact on our stay and our view of the Druids Glen. Due to this very disappointing meal which was quite expensive for what it was, I would be hesitant to recommend the Druids Glen. 

I must add that overall the service was quite good and we had no other issues and we enjoyed the room and the breakfast the next morning and we were very happy to see there is an option for vegetarian sausages.

Unfortunately I would not go back to the Druids Glen because of the food which is disappointing as it is a lovely hotel.

238,Beautiful ground and rooms,Stayed here for 2 nights. The front deck staff are very friendly and helpful. The room was large and welcoming with a small patio overlooking a courtyard. The bar was cozy with friendly bartenders and patrons.,5,2017,11,05
238,Girls night away,"Beautiful hotel, fantastic staff, gorgeous rooms, amazing food. Everything about our visit was 5 Star. Highly recommend this hotel.
From the minute we walked in the door we were treated like princesses. Amazing gorgeous place. 
",5,2017,11,04
238,"Great stay, away of the crowd","The room was excellent, the mattress and pillow superb.The bathroom very spacious and the wardrobe closet as well.Only the central  heating/ cooler was a bit unsatisfactory.The lobby and the fireplace were excellent.The staff were very gentle and especially the restaurant maitre! The breakfast could be managed more effectively- the guy at the pancakes and omelets was starting his shift later in the morning so I missed both delicacies.The surrounding environment is green hills turned now into a golf place and you can see also the ocean from there.Its long distance from any big city can be considered a reason for choosing or not the resort.",4,2017,11,04
238,Seven Star Service,"Just returned from a very enjoyable 3 night family stay at the hotel over midterm. The friendliness and quality of service from all of the staff at hotel was far superior to anything I have ever experienced at any 5 star hotel. Breakfast is buffet style with a large selection to choose from. We played both golf courses and really enjoyed the different challenges of both. The family rooms are spacious and luxurious. We stayed in room 321 which had a lovely view of the golf course. Our kids, 11 and 12 years old, enjoyed the Xbox, air hockey and table football in the games room. Would definitely recommend ",5,2017,11,03
238,Can't be surpassed,Spent two nights here over midterm.It was exceptional to say the least.What makes a successful hotel it's is staff & here the staff were brilliant to us at all times.Nothing was a problem to them & they looked after us  so well.A special word of thanks to the team who ran the kids club.As our son is special needs we were apprehensive in sending him to high tea but the team really looked after him in everyway.He enjoyed it so much that he went the two nights we stayed.Many thanks to ye all!,5,2017,11,02
238,Country get away,My family and I stayed at Druids Glen Hotel when visiting Dublin. It is a beautiful resort and Golf club. The hotel staff is very friendly and very accommodating. Very family friendly with activities for children. It is a little far out of Dublin if you are looking for an active night life. It you are looking for quite in the country this is a great place! ,5,2017,11,02
238,Amazing Amazing Amazing!!!,"Where do I start?!?!
From the moment we walked through the front doors, everything was top class. Lovely lady at reception who was checking us in, handed us some aromatic refreshing towels which was a nice touch. 
Complimentary bottle of Prosecco in our room - thank you so much, we really appreciated it. 
Room was spacious, comfortable and great for us as a family of 4. Bathroom super clean, just the way I expect it to be. Beautiful L'Occitane toiletries - such a lovely touch.

As we checked quite late and booked hotel only couple of hours prior to arriving, we headed to the bar for our meal. Nothing to fault, it was brilliant. My husband had best wild mushroom risotto ever! My son's steak was a bit fatty but he still enjoyed it.

We had very comfortable sleep and were looking forward to our breakfast which as you can guess - didn't disappoint! AMAZING!!! Service and food were AMAZING!!! Hotel does cater for all - choice of non-dairy milk was impressive and I have spotted GF station as well. The most fabulous honey - really recommend! We both had vegetarian sausages and eggs cooked to perfection.

After breakfast we took kids to the spa/pool and again - were not disappointed! The only tiny comment would be - lack of space and absence of changing cubicles in changing rooms.

Overall, amazing stay and we definitely will be back!!! Already planning our next visit!
Thank you so much to all the staff at Druids Glen for making our stay really special!",5,2017,11,01
238,Excellent hotel in a beautiful area,"Stayed three nights last week, the hotel is in a very relaxing and beautiful area, surrounded by nature. The room we stayed in was very nice, bed comfortable and WiFi strong. Breakfast served was also top notch. 
Service was excellent in the hotel, all staff were friendly and went out of their way to be helpful. You will not have any regrets staying here, all in all, an excellent hotel.",5,2017,10,31
238,Super nice!,"This us a very nice resort hotel with all the amenities you’d want. Golf, hiking trails, a spa, dining options, etc. - something for everyone to enjoy. If ever traveling in Ireland again we’ll be sure to include a stop here.

238,Truely 5 star,My new wife and I spent a night here following our wedding in September and it was exactly what we were looking for. 5 star from check in to check out including the spa. A really terrific experience. We both got massages in the spa from Andrade and Correina which were excellent and we we used the leisure facilities also which were very well kept. We had a drink at the bar and the staff were very helpful. Room service was delivered as expected and delicious. The breakfast the next morning was excellent. Thoroughly recommend,5,2017,10,20
238,Anniversary break away ,"Booked a night away for our anniversary with Afternoon tea. When we arrived we were greeted by lovely reception staff and hot towels. Our receptionist gave us details of all the features of the hotel. We checked in our room was spacious, very comfortable bed and beautiful decor. We had booked afternoon tea which was a fab treat, a great selection of sweets and savourys and again we were met by very attentive helpful staff...With our package we received a bottle of bubbly to our room. We went to the Health centre and enjoyed the pool sauna steam room. The hotel also has a spa. We went to the 13th Bar in the evening which serves a  range of delicious dishes. Again staff were really helpful. We had hoped to try Woodstock house but unfortunately we heard the hurricane was moving north (very unusual in Ireland) and had to leave alot earlier then we had hoped... before we left we enjoyed a fanastic breakfast...loved the egg station freshly made omelettes and pancakes as well as full Irish breakfast, cerals, fruit and pastries. 
What makes the hotel special apart from the beautiful grounds is the amazing staff😀 highly recommended ",5,2017,10,16
238,"Great place, great golf","We stayed 3 nights and had a great time. Hotel had great attention to detail. Made sure everything was perfect - or fixed it! Warm, helpful staff. Food was great at Hugo's. Breakfast was wonderful. Restaurant staff very attentive. Golf course employees also wonderful. Beautiful golf course, wonderful people. We'll be back.",5,2017,10,13
238,Superb,"An excellent stay. Excellent accommodation and fine dining, the hotel and restaurant ticked both of those boxes in a big way. The staff in Hugo's were expertly attentive and treated us very well in perfect partnership with the beautifully prepared and presented food. A guaranteed stop on my next trip to Ireland.",5,2017,10,11
238,Very Good Experience ,"Visited Druids Glen in late August for a family stay of three nights, excellent facilities, excellent meal choices, great grounds and activities to suit everyone. Management handled any issues professionally and expeditiously with agreeable outcomes. Would highly recommend the hotel and would stay again without hesitation.",5,2017,10,11
238,Exceeded all expectations!,"The staff was amazing from the porter to the front desk. Barbara, the hostess at Hugo’s was truly kind. She went above and beyond. The food Sunday breakfast was worth the €20 per person. They had a full honeycomb dripping with fresh honey do drizzle on whatever you desire. Many local choices as well black and white pudding.
Kid friendly indeed, they have several playgrounds.
Lamentably, I didn’t have time to play a round of golf but can’t wait to go back.
Check is at 16:00- Checkout 12:00",5,2017,10,11
238,A long course,Got to play the Heath last week. Whilst it’s not as picturesque as the Glen it’s still quite a nice course and quite a challenge. It is a long course though so maybe take a trolly or buggy. I play off 21 and had some local knowledge from a member which helped. It was a windy day which made it tough but still enjoyable. Lots of bunkers and plenty of water to catch you out. A very enjoyable course all in all. ,5,2017,10,03
238,Family weekend break.,"I was staying in Druids Glen hotel on the weekend with family.My first impression was in reception. The staff was so polite special Thank you to Amy at the front desk,she was very friendly,helpful and so professional.Highly recommend  Amy to anyone to deal with.
That was best short holiday ever.
Kids had an excellent time in the nice swimming pool area,
Big Thank you to all of the staff who looked after the pool area.
Very well organised to keep the kids busy in the hotel kids room.The had everything to keep the children happy.
The size of the room and beds was incredible.New beds is very comfortable and big.
The restaurant staff was great special Thank you for girl from Lithuania.She was very helpful and organised.

Thanks for everything Druids Glen see you soon again.",5,2017,10,03
238,"Very comfortable bedroom, staff extremely helpful and friendly ","Stayed here September 2017, room was very comfortable, best night sleep in a long time.  Nice big bathroom with separate shower and bath. Hotel and staff were excellent,great breakfast but food options for dinner in bar and restaurant  limited and a bit overpriced but having said that will be back .
",4,2017,10,03
238,Nice stay ,"Arrived on Sunday 24th for two nights. Small issues after we checked in as package we booked was ment to be upgraded to king size but got room with 2 doubles. We eventually got room change. My mother had called to the hotel personally the previous evening with a gift for us with Champagne to be in our room when we arrived, we were also due a bottle of prosecco  (on our package) It wasn't there! Eventually it arrived. Breakfast was disappointing, not 5 star breakfast by any standards. Only option is buffet fry with the most bland scrambled egg  (salt & pepper absent) or to que while you have your food on a plate for the chef to cook your fried egg.  No options like egg Benedict, French toast etc. Disappointed. Overall average 4star. ",4,2017,10,02
238,Pleasently Surprised,"Traveling for the first time with my family. We have seven month old twins. while booking I was a little concerned about bringing babies to a five star hotel. on arrival we where made feel very welcome. the room was spacious and we where provided with two travel cots. on the floor we stayed on they had a family room. it had a microwave, steriliser, nappies and baby food. they bar area was very family friendly. We had a waitress called Min (sorry about spelling) who was great with the babies. I think my son fell in love. The staff make this hotel. they are all super friendly. The pool, gym and spa are well equipped. The Golf course looked fab. the hotel has nice walks and plenty to do. We will definitely be back.",5,2017,09,29
238,SHORT GOLF BREAK,"My wife and I stayed here with another couple for two nights and we were all highly delighted with every aspect of the hotel and golf on offer. The rooms are spacious and well appointed with large bathrooms and are clean and modern. The staff are friendly and efficient and there are choices of where to dine and drink. The food is good and there is a lovely buffet breakfast available. Two of us played golf on a Championship course (Druids Glen) and found it picturesque and not too brutal!
The price was very reasonable for the quality and service provided and I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to anyone who wants to stay in the area.",5,2017,09,28
238,Great Stay!,"Just had a 1 nights stay here and loved everything about the place. We were on a golf trip and flew in from London early morning reaching the resort by 9.30am. We knew we were early and were not really expecting our room to be available but we checked in with the wonderful Amy at the desk. She informed us that there were no rooms available currently but she would take our number and call us as soon as one is ready. True to her word Amy gave us a call an hour later and told us she had a room ready. This was great news as we were able to get a bit of kip before our round of golf at 1am.

The room was nice, modern and spacious and the beds very comfortable so we slept very well that night after the early start to the day. The bathroom area was large with both a bath tub and a shower. Breakfast was very good the next day with a variety of options available. They have a chef making eggs and pancakes as well as fry up, cereals, fruits, breads options amongst more. The staff were very good and always there to assist when needed.

We checked out by 10.30am as we had a round of golf the following day as well which would finish around 3pm. We were free to still use the facilities though to freshen up before our flight back so used the changing rooms before having a quick drink at the bar in Fairways and heading back to the airport.

Everyone was so friendly at the resort whether it be the staff, fellow players on the course or general people at the bar. Really makes for a great atmosphere throughout the whole place.

A wonderful 2 days overall and cannot wait to return again!",5,2017,09,26
238,Great hotel.,"This hotel is quite new. The room was excellent, spacious with a well laid out bathroom.
The sound insulation was excellent - no noise from either inside the hotel or outside.
The breakfast buffet was excellent. The bar was comfortable with a good range of drinks if a little expensive.
The dinner menu was limited.
The location was typical countryside.
We did not avail of the golf facilities which are a big part of this hotels offering.
Very friendly staff.
We had a very enjoyable stay but not sure we will be back.",4,2017,09,26
238,Terrific in every way- 5 *,"Stayed here with 5 of my friends this weekend for 1 night and played 2 rounds of golf, one round on each of the two 18 hole courses. 
First things first, the hotel is 5 star, it is clean, open, friendly, warm and modern. The staff are terrific from the reception, to the bar staff, to the dinner and breakfast staff and housekeeping etc; top quality and very willing to help and go the extra mile. WELL DONE. The bottle of water at check out is a nice touch. The food was great, tasty, fresh. Having breakfast till 11 in the morning is the way forward, great job. the heath club is great, clean and crisp, hint, bring a swim cap as you will need one or spend 3 euro for one. We did not have children with us but there is a kids area with pool table, games etc. and if you have infants, they have all the facilities for the late night feeds...... well done.

As to the golf courses, unreal, very good course, impeccable all round, two challenging courses and both totally different considering they 300 years apart and in excellent condition, the greens were fast, the fairways can be snug but what would golf be otherwise.",5,2017,09,25
238,Stunning surroundings ,"My partner and I stayed here for two night's on a midweek break in April. We were greeted by a friendly receptionist who checked us in & gave us warm lavender towel's for our face's after our commute. Our room was very clean & spacious. The bed was very comfortable & the  bathroom had some luxury toiletries which was a nice touch. Our room had amazing views of the golf course & garden's. We took a walk around the ground's which was very enjoyable! There was a little fairy trail which is fabulous for children. The breakfast buffet was very impressive, we were spoilt for choice! We had bar food on one of the night's of our stay, we felt it was quite expensive for bar food! However it was nice food & the service was very  good!  ",4,2017,09,24
238,Noisy,"In general I like Druids Glen. However One thing is irritating, some guests drink so much that they become rather noisy going to their room. I had this week at 3 am and at 3.15 am drunken people knocking on my room door. Quite irritating if you have to get up early the next day",2,2017,09,23
238,Back again!,"Just returned from my 5th visit to Druids Glen, once again had an amazing stay.   The hotel has the most wonderful hardworking staff where nothing is too much trouble.   It's like being in a wonderful bubble of niceness!   Coming back to work this morning in London was quite a shock,  no bubble of niceness on the commute!   I was last at Druids Glen at Easter and since then they have replaced the beds which are absolutely divine.  They've also made the two steam rooms one big steam room and it's really lovely and a great improvement.   We were staying a week so the only downside to that is you get through the menu in the bar quite quickly but it's good value and the food whilst limited in choice, is really good.   Breakfast is amazing and you couldn't ask for more (although they've removed mushrooms from breakfast and replaced with fried potatoes, not my ideal for breakfast but that's a personal thing i guess!).    The welcome back chocs were a really nice thought and it's those details that make the place.   The grounds are beautiful and i recommend a visit to Greystones as it's gorgeous.   Hopefully back at Easter again as we have family in Wicklow and Druids Glen is the perfect base.  Thank you to all the staff as I know the CEO reads these views!",5,2017,09,19
238,Kind Hospitality and Professionalism of Young Cordial Staff,"After driving all around Ireland for a week we ended our trip with 2 nights at the Druids Glen Hotel.  As everyone else has stated the resort is set in a beautiful location and the rooms are very very nice and very large.   A very well kept resort.  Most of all we enjoyed and appreciated the young profession staff.  From the moment we checked in the young woman at the desk was so kind and when we asked for a map of the area she kindly highlighted all the places we might want to drive to or do some hikes.  I wish we would have gotten her name as she deserves to be thanked for her kind hospitality.
We spent both nights in the pub which is also a gorgeous setting overlooking the 13th hole.  We are not golfers but it looked like a beautiful but difficult course.  We cannot say enough about our young waiter Hugo.  He was so endearing and was so professional at the young age of 21.  You don't often see that.  He took the time to talk to us and went as far as to tell us how we could get those delicious wasabi peanuts that they set out in the bar.  We only wish our 22 year old daughter would meet someone of his caliber.  Hugo you have a place to stay if you ever come to Virginia. And finally we must mention the young gentleman (Stephan or Steven) who checked us out at 5:00 a.m.  He was truly a godsend and once again so professional.   We had a 8:50 a.m. flight to catch and thought it would be a breeze to make it to the Dublin airport in plenty of time.  What we didn't realize is that my husband had filled up the rental car the previous evening with the wrong gas.  It took diesel and it was just an oversight on his part.  He was barely able to get the car started and knew there was no way we could make it to the airport.  While he was on the phone with the Dan Dooley rental company Stephen was on the phone getting us a cab to the airport so we wouldn't miss our flight.  The mechanic to siphon out the bad gas was there in approx 10 minutes as well as the taxi driver Lenny.  That's amazing service at 5:00 a.m.  We chose to leave the car and take the taxi so as not to miss our flight.  Stephen handled the entire situation in such a calm, courteous and professional way.  We felt very good about leaving the keys to the rental car in his hands.
You can be at the most luxurious resort in the world but if you don't have a good staff people would not want to come back.  Druids Glen has the most awesome staff and it was so nice to experience their young professionalism.  Thank you all again for a wonderful stay.  We would come back in a minute.  Ireland is beautiful and everyday we saw something even more spectacular than the previous day.",5,2017,09,17
238,5 star service,"Rooms lovely, bed like sleeping on a cloud, no usual hotel noises. Room was really spacious, lovely extras, toiletries. In every area the staff were exceptional. A walk to the golf club house is lovely and they have a nice menu for lunch and again the two bar men were really friendly and nice. Pay a little extra for this hotel, it's worth it! ",5,2017,09,16
238,Lovely family stay,"Travelled as a family with a toddler and it was a wonderful stay. The rooms were very spacious and overall the hotels offers great facilities, to specifically mention the kitchette, children's playground and swimming pool including those changing rooms specifically for families. All staff were very helpful and took time to even speak to my toddler and ask him about the holiday.  
A wonderful stay and would love to go back.  It's a great location with powerscourt gardens and waterfall with playground, national sea life life, dundrum all in 30 mins driving distance. 
Would recommend staying on the third floor superior rooms for wonderful views.  ",5,2017,09,15
238,Beautiful setting,This family friendly hotel has a beautiful setting with a really lovely trail walk on the grounds which includes a small fairy garden. They also have a lovely playground on site. We were even supplied with little robes for the children to wear going to the pool. Staff were very friendly.,4,2017,09,14
238,wonderful,"Such a beautiful, luxurious resort in wonderful surroundings. Staff were so helpful and friendly and couldn't have done more for us.
Visited here last week and i have to admit its WOW
We will come back.",4,2017,09,10
238,Perfect!,"We stayed the night here as we were attending a wedding and all I can say is WOW! Such a beautiful, luxurious resort in wonderful surroundings. Staff were so helpful and friendly and couldn't have done more for us - including porterage! Our room was a king-sized on the third floor and it was such a good size, complete with en-suite and bath tub (with Elemis toiletries - my favourite!). Our room had reasonable views over the golf course. But one thing I must mention is the bed - the mattress and bedding was so soft and perfect for me! Being heavily pregnant, I don't sleep well but I had the best nights sleep for a good few months here. All extra touches are thought of including bottled water and chocolates. Would definitely stay here again and couldn't recommend more.",5,2017,09,09
238,celebrating our anniversary,"We spent 2 nights here as part of a luxury break and it was well worth the visit.  From the time we checked in to the moment we left, we were treated as special.  The rooms are very spacious and well  equipped.  What i liked was the way they ""turned over"" the bed in the evening when we are out. There was also  a chocolate on our bed to enjoy and any towels we had used were replaced.  This is in addition to the room being serviced in the morning.  The food in the restaurant, ""Hugo's"" was excellent.  Master-Chef comes to mind here. They even decorated my dessert plate with ""Happy Anniversary"".  We are already thinking of going back next year.",5,2017,09,07
238,A wonderful Hotel,"We visited here in June with our very young babies. There was a very warm welcome at reception and I was very impressed with the decor and ambience. The room was spacious and spotlessly clean. There is a 'baby pantry' on the second floor which has a kitchenette and supplies for babies. It was a necessity for us and a great idea. All the staff we encountered over our stay were so friendly. An excellent hotel, will visit again and will definitely recommend it to others. 
",5,2017,09,06
238,Beautiful setting,"Am currently on 3rd night of our 3 night stay and have to say the place is very well kept , staff all friendly, food excellent for all meals and spotlessly clean everywhere, spacious too, only small fault is play room for the kids is small and no supervision, except from that a super place to stay ! ",4,2017,09,05
238,Amazing Stay for our 25th Wedding Anniversary,"From when we arrived we were made feel special and welcomed.
We were upgraded to a suite, which was Fabulous

Staff were so lovely , everyone seemed to know it was a very special occasion for us.

Food was amazing and our waiter was full of useful advice without being intrusive.

the lovely ladies on reception were very helpful and efficient
cant wait to go back",5,2017,09,04
238,So good to be back again....,"I have reviewed DG before and after finally getting back for a few days, as far as I'm concerned its better than ever.  With the minor complaint of food & drink at the bar being a bit dear, it really is tough to find anything uncomplimentary to say. Aside from the overall excellence of the facility, the comfy beds, the cleanliness, the setting, the massage, what really makes this one of the best hotels in the country is the Staff.  The standard of service here is unreal and you are made to feel like a VIP from the moment you arrive at the door by Teague and his tophat.    Is Luic better than Irina? Is Barbara nicer than Bradley?  I could name every member of the team here as excellent because they all are. If I ever opened a business of my own I would want to sent my own staff here to see how it's done. So, we'll start saving a few quid for our next trip because we are coming back sooner rater than later.....",5,2017,09,03
238,Fabulous resort,"We booked this hotel for 2 nights for a birthday celebration and from the moment we arrived at reception until we left we found the staff welcoming, friendly efficient and nothing was too much effort
The bar offered great snacks along with great drinks and the setting overlooking the golf course was perfect.
The meal in Hugo's was delicious and again the restaurant staff have to be praised for the service they provide.
I was totally impressed by the spa where I had the most fantastic full body massage from Laura and I have to reiterate that she was by far the best therapist I have ever had ( superior to Monart Spa) 
As a mature couple staying in the hotel we did notice many young families in the hotel however the hotel have catered for their needs with kids club and set  times for families  to use the pool and other times for the pool to be child free so there is an excellent balance for every age group to enjoy the hotel facilities
The ambience of the hotel, the fantastic staff, the excellent golf course, great food and fabulous spa made our stay really memorable and we look forward to a return visit.",5,2017,09,01
238,Lovely family weekend break,"Went for the bank holiday with the family Lovely hotel and grounds. Arrived at reception and given hot face cloths. Staff were lovely made you feel very welcome. Shown to our room lovely beds extremely comfortable the kids even had their own robes and slippers they were well pleased. Beautiful view from the room. Great pool too for the kids and staff were very friendly. Breakfast was first class plenty of choice to pick from staff greeted you and showed you around. Very child friendly too didn't feel kids shouldn't be there as it is a 5 star hotel which is what you want. Ate in the restranuant food was lovely and staff were very nice didn't have long to wait. Treated myself to the spa very relaxing and again staff made you feel so welcome and at ease. Had a lovely weekend break would definitely return.

",5,2017,08,31
238,Excellent stay,"Second visit this year.
Friendly staff from the moment we arrived.
Daughters 9th birthday and they made her feel very special!
Room was good- although a view of the golf course would be better than one of the houses next door!
Kids playroom, DVD library, bike rental.
Points for improvements would be to expand the bar menu as parents with children are banned from the main restaurant after 7 (though we actually saw many kids in there....) meaning parents only have one dining choice.
Very hard working bar staff. Friendly and accommodating.
My second experience in as many months of hotels ""double charging"". 
That is taking payment of bill in addition to the pre-authorisation amount on check-in. On the plus side, Druids Glen phoned to apologise as soon as they realised what had happened.",4,2017,08,30
238,Great way to end a trip around Ireland!,"This was our final destination after a 3 week driving holiday around Ireland - and it didn't disappoint!  We were warmly greeted upon arrival and the hot towels were a lovely touch.
Our room was large and beautifully appointed.  Staff were friendly and accommodating whilst making you feel relaxed and welcome.  Breakfast in the mornings was a real treat! Great choice of delicious, fresh and well cooked food. We had dinner in the bar area overlooking the golf course and were not disappointed in either the service or the quality of the food.  Even had an ice-cream in the afternoon from the ice cream cart in the lobby after a great game of golf on the Druids Glen Course! Whilst it was school holidays and there were plenty of children and families staying at the Hotel they were not overwhelming and appeared to be well catered for.  The lovely touch of being assisted to our car as we left by a long serving and very friendly doorman was a classy touch from a top class hotel.",5,2017,08,30
238,Excellent hotel. Perfect for a family time,"We went to Druids Glenn to celebrate our first wedding anniversary with our daughter and we couldn't have made a better choice.
They were kind enough to offer us a small gift, a box of chocolates, because of our wedding anniversary.
The hotel is a decent 5 star, very clean, very comfortable and the staff is amazing.
There's also a lot of activities for kids, like movies and a big play room where they can spend time playing games or consoles.
We went to the SPA and we absolutely loved it. The therapists and masseurs were amazing and we had a great time here.
Really a five star service all around.",5,2017,08,29
238,Weekend break,"The good... lovely location, nice staff and nice rooms.

The not so good... we thought the food was ok in the bar but nothing special for the money. The bedrooms whilst nice we thought the en-suite was in need of an upgrade. Ours was a bit dirty, we informed the staff of this and the management kindly upgraded us to a suite. The suite was a nice large room, but I have to say the en-suite let it down. Wallpaper was coming off the wall and looked a little tired. It wasnt really bad but not the standard you would expect for 5 star. Pics are from suite btw",3,2017,08,29
238,5* Irish luxury,"For the second year running, my husband and I had a child free night's stay at the Druids Glen Hotel. We were lucky to be upgraded to a suite on arrival. Wow, it was huge and absolutely stunning. The room had everything you'd expect to get at a luxury hotel, plus some lovely L'Occitane products which were replenished when we went out for dinner.

We book a dinner, bed and breakfast package. The meal at Hugo's restaurant is without doubt our favourite part of our stay. We enjoyed a drink on the outside terrace before dinner- fortunately the weather was kind to us. We were shown to the romantic conservatory for our meal. It's so romantic with the candles lit. The food, once again, was outstanding. The Irish lady who served us was lovely - attentive but not stuffy. It was all perfect. 

Breakfast the next day was also in Hugo's restaurant - there was a huge selection of hot and cold food to choose from, and drinks/toast were brought to the table. 

Before we headed back to Wexford to pick up the boys from their grandparents, we got the shuttle bus to the Golf course, had a coffee on the terrace (wonderful views over the Irish Sea towards Wales) before walking back to the hotel around the perimeter of the golf course. 

A couple of not so plus points - the wine is very expensive. 21 euro for a large glass of wine (two single measures) but I expect that in Ireland, especially with the exchange rate being so poor for the Brits this year. Also, our suite didn't have any net curtains unlike other rooms... Just a small point but from a privacy point of view, it would have been nice to have.

In summary, we had another amazing stay at the Druids Glen. See you again next August! 

",5,2017,08,28
238,Jaw dropping room service ,"It stayed in druids glen on 18th of Feb with my partner, on arriving at the hotel the grounds of hotel and reception area were beautiful.. we arrived a little after 2 went to reception to leave our bags, we had opted for executive room which was €250 for the night without breakfast, whilst waiting we went for a walk in the near by gardens.. we arrived back at the hotel and our room wasn't ready, at 420 with got our room.. the room was lovely nothing to complain about.. however it was later that evening when my partner went down to get me a Diet Coke and some nibbles at the bar and to see if any other food other than room service menu was being served.. the room service menu was all that was available and that was perfectly fine, he asked could he get the ham & cheese brown bread sandwich.. the bar man said he would have to phone it to room service and it would be brought to our room, again this was not a problem.. it was when room service arrived that a young waiter entered the room with the sandwich giving us a bill of €12.50, sandwich was €7.50 and service charge €5.00.. my partner handed him €20 to which the young man asked 'do you want change??' Automatically my partner felt obliged to say no and your fine and off the waiter went.. I do not know any establishment or business that asks their customers or guests if they want their change.. I understand it's a 5 star hotel but I was appalled at this and it's simply a matter of principal.. the following morning I rang reception to complain, can't say I was satisfied with how it was handled I was at least expecting an offer of the money to be returned that we felt obligated and uncomfortable to give in the first place.. with a price tag for the room it is not the service one would expect to receive.. ",1,2017,08,28
238,Fantastic Place to Stay,"This was our first visit to Druid's Glen, on the recommendation of family members who have stayed there.  We were very impressed with the standard of accommodation, as well as the warm welcome which we received on arrival.  Our room was excellent, with a lot of attention to detail.  We also enjoyed two lovely meals in the bar and were served by very helpful staff.  In fact, all of the staff are very friendly, including the concierge - Teague.

This is a brilliant place to stay.  We would certainly recommend this hotel, and hope to return in the future.",5,2017,08,27
238,Druids Glean - lovely break,"I went to Druids Glenn for a little away gift with my wife and we love it; we book the night with dinner, we went to the SPA and we also we took the nice walk around the park before leaving. Overall this was an excellent 24 hours break to a lovely location less than an hour way from Dublin 
We enjoyed the service, the attention, the dinner and the breakfast, even the weather help a bit our relaxing time 
Our only recommendation would be about the relaxation room in the SPA, that is beside the staff room: there was some going back and forward that didn't help the absolute relax we could have after our lovely treatments 
Otherwise it was a great experience.",4,2017,08,27
238,Clean and Green,"Gone for a run on the surroundings, by the river and it was a dream! 
The breakfast was great ( even though they soak their eggs/ omellet in oil ), we have a couple of issues trying to reserve at the main restaurant Hugo´s ( not friendly at all and always busy). 
Even though we had a great time at the bar the food was horrible I had the chicken curry and the next night the burger and they both were a great disappointment. 
The room was spacious and clean.
The most annoying experience was certainly the spa. My friend contacted  the spa for a pedicure in the morning, after 15 minutes when we found out she couldn't make it on time, she called to cancel and was informed  about a  24h cancelation policy, the full price would be charged any ways, making us rush back to the spa. how 24h policy if she called 15 min ago..? lol  
 The steaming room and sauna very good. If jumping in the pool you need to purchase a cap.",2,2017,08,25
238,Not a 5*,"This is definitely not a 5* hotel by any definition.  

Upsides:
It is well maintained with overall kind and helpful staff.
Very spacious and nicely decorated rooms  
Downsides:
The food at the 13th or Pavilion Lounge was average and the assortment was not great.  Too much goats cheese and tasteless burgers.  Kids pizza was like a frozen one from the supermarket.  Pasta dishes were tiny.
Many waiters were amateurs (they served soup without bringing a spoon, or burgers without any ketchup/mayo)
The tables at the outdoor area were poorly serviced.
The kids area was basic
The tray charge for room service was 8 euro.  I am travelling with business all over the world and I have never ever seen such a high tray charge anywhere!!!!  ",3,2017,08,24
238,Lovely Family Break,"Just spent 2 nights in Druids Glen with my husband and 4 children. From the minute we got to the hotel all of the staff were excellent and nothing was too much trouble. The hotel is very children focused and they are made feel very welcome. In the evening a bookstand is left in the reception filled with DVDs for the kids to take back to the room to watch, this was a huge novelty with my kids. Room are spacious and very well equipped. Lovely grounds surrounding the hotel over looking a beautiful golf course. Great feeling of being out in the countryside and yet only 25 mins from Dublin. Would highly recommend this hotel for Families or a couple looking for a break.",5,2017,08,23
238,Fantastic spot with brilliant staff& great food,"The Staff from reception to food service and throughout hotel could not have been more helpful or friendly from our arrival right through to our departure.
We ate in both the bar and the restaurant and the food was lovely in both places with a nice selection. 
Lovely setting and very family friendly,  our Room was lovely and clean.  ",5,2017,08,23
238,Mr James and Kathleen Tubbritt,I visited Druids Glen resort for the occasion of my 50th wedding anniversary on11th of august 2017.My wife and I were very diss appointed as the resort was very overcrowded and staff were overworked and unable to cope particularly the restaurant staff. Our meal was a disgrace including breakfast we often got better in Mc Donald's.Some of my family travelled from  USA for the occasion and they personally complained about crowds and lack of air on. As far as we can see your policy seems pack in as many people as possible without regard for comfort of your guests and the high cost they have to pay.,3,2017,08,22
238,Absolutely Top Class Stay,"My Fiancee and I stayed in this hotel in August 2017. Everything about the hotel is outstanding. The was plenty of parking upon arrival.Check in was simple and the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. 
The bedroom was large and spacious. The bed was extremely comfortable. 
We had made a dinner reservation prior to our arrival. Dinner was delicious. The setting was perfect and the staff provided a 5 star level of service.
We went to the bar area after dinner. It was busy but there was still seating available. There was live music playing. The bar area like the rest of the hotel is top class. 
There was a huge selection of food for breakfast. The food was fresh and delicious.
Our stay was perfect. I would recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2017,08,20
238,Fabulous place,"Absolutely faultless. Stayed in many 5 star hotels around the world and must say this is up there with the best. Start to finish outstanding service, door man, reception and bar staff demonstrate top customer service. Thank you druids glen for a perfect stay I'll definitely be back!",5,2017,08,19
238,Family Trip,"Excellent in every way, faultless. Staff are very professional and well trained. Hotel is spotless, room was lovely, great for families, well thought out. Food was excellent especially breakfast, full of choice. Already booked to return next year. This place is top class.",5,2017,08,19
238,Thoroughly Enjoyable Stay,"My husband, one year old boy and I stayed in this hotel for three nights last week. We were very impressed. Though the term 'family friendly' would have been grounds to avoid a few years ago, it is now a hotel trait that we look for! This hotel most certainly is very suitable for families. Our room was very spacious, clean and comfortable. We had a lovely view overlooking the golf course. There is a lovely swimming pool with designated times for children - very fair I thought, as there should be adult only times too. I would love to have availed of the spa facilities, but alas time didn't allow, so I can't comment on that. 

At breakfast, we were warmly greeted, and a high chair was immediately provided. Staff were very friendly, and engaging with our little boy (even when he got a bit shouty at breakfast.. Eek!). There was a great selection of food at breakfast and it was of a great standard too. We had lunch in the hotel on two of the three days. It was very nice, though possibly a little overpriced. We ate in the hotel on the first evening and had a barbecue. At €30 per person, although very tasty, I felt that one or two further meat/fish options would have been good. It was, however, very enjoyable. 

The hotel itself is wonderfully located, close to many amenities, the lovely town of Greystones, beaches aplenty, Glenroe Pet Farm (a wonderful afternoon was had there) and the beautiful Glen of the Downs. 

The staff are highly professional, yet wonderfully warm. We had a fabulous stay in the hotel and certainly intend to return in the future. ",5,2017,08,17
238,Great stay and top service,"Stayed here with my family for a couple of nights, the rooms were impeccable, service was excellent, staff was very welcoming.
The facilities (pool, sauna, fitness room) are great for a morning swim and an evening workout. The restaurant serves great food and staff are very nice, breakfast is very good as well. Would recommend it!! 😊",5,2017,08,17
238,Fantastic place,"We were here for a wedding, and the staff, food and place was 5 star. Absolutely fantastic. Could not fault it.  The surrounding area was lovely to. We did not stay here, but were here for one evening and one full day.",5,2017,08,16
238,One of the best hotels I have stayed in,"The Druids Glen is one of the best hotels I have stayed in.  The staff are exceptional.

the rooms are excellent and especially clean.  I visited for a conference.  I cannot express how excellent the service is.
This hotel is definitely one of the best",5,2017,08,16
238,AMAZING,"We are just back from a fabulous break at the Druids Glen Resort. Every element of our break was outstanding, starting with the warmest  welcome from the concierge  (a lovely Donegal man).
Our room was fabulous with lots of lovely touches for all guests e.g robe and slippers for the smaller guests.
The gym, pool and spa area are spotless.
Food was amazing, breakfast was probably best I ever had. Lots of choice.

The playroom is top class with no hidden extra charges, loved the DVD library.

Lastly I would like to commend the hotel on their staff. At all times staff greeted you and all seemed to be very happy. We could not find any fault and will most certainly be back.
",5,2017,08,16
238,Family getaway,"We really loved our stay in Druids glen. All the staff we encountered were so helpful and friendly. We opted to eat at the restaurant that night and the food was amazing. There was a BBQ that night and entertainment also,which everyone looked to be really enjoying. Plenty of things to keep our little girls happy.. pool, playground on the grounds, playroom inside the hotel and a lovely walking trail. It is a bit of a trek with a double buggy but staff offered to collect us if we got tired! We will definitely recommend this hotel to friends and family and look forward to our next visit :)",5,2017,08,15
238,Great 5-Star Hotel in Ireland near Greystones!!!,"We recently stayed at the Druids Glen Hotel and Golf Resort for five nights. This 5-star hotel deserves every star!  The staff are polite and will do whatever they can to help their guests have a fabulous visit! The food is wonderful, and the grounds are beautiful.  There are two golf courses along with a driving range and many other amenities.  Kudos to the Director of Operations Romy Joy and Front Office Supervisor Adrienne Hughes for the excellent training of your staff and the wonderful service you provide at the Hotel.  Joel and I will definitely be back!!!",5,2017,08,12
238,Wonderful spot,"A welcomed rest from all our driving.  A couple at a convenience store drove ahead of  us to the entrance or we still wouldn't have found it !  Great room, spacious bathroom and long, interesting walking paths around the property.  Beautifully maintained with friendly, helpful staff.",5,2017,08,12
238,Amazing overnight stay,"My friend and I recently stayed in Druids for one evening. It was wonderful from start to finish. Our room was upgraded, our spa treatments were amazing, dinner was beautiful and the service as always was exemplary. I had stayed at druids a couple of years back with my husband. It was great to see so many of the same faces amongst the staff, all still there and doing a terrific job. A wonderful hotel. ",5,2017,08,10
238,"Great if you like other people's kids, otherwise...","My husband and I paid 800 euros to stay on a DBB package for 3 nights. (+ 90 euros pp per round of golf). This hotel is absolutely full of families with babies/young children. Seemingly they do amazing deals for families!  Kids running up and down the corridors screaming. The most disappointing part for us was that babies/young children are allowed in the a la carte restaurant at any time in the evening. We booked our table for 8pm each evening hoping for peace and quiet to enjoy our meal. We couldn't even hear the restaurant background music over children's iPads belting out Peppa Pig cartoon music and the like. Even when we left the restaurant at 9.30, families were still there with whinging kids and cartoons playing at high volume. I wonder how it would be received were we to play Barry White Greatest Hits full volume on our iPhones at the table?  Come on Druids Glen, get real. Either advertise this hotel as families only, great deals, or segregate part of the restaurant/times for families/couples. This would surely be easily resolved given there are at least 4 separate areas. We certainly won't be returning or recommending to our golfing friends. Very disappointing. ",2,2017,08,10
238,Birthday golf break,Decided to stay at Druidsglen resort for a 3 night golf break with my wife. In my opinion this is not a 5* hotel more like a 4*. Staff are very friendly. but the theme is based on families with very young children with no concession for older adults that would like to eat breakfast and dinner in a relaxed calm environment. I Appreciate hotels need to cater for all but unless druidsglen does not want to be labelled children's only hotel it must take a balance view or decide what market it is targeting. We would not recommend this hotel to any golfing friends.,2,2017,08,10
238,Lovely Hotel,"We stayed just one night in the hotel in July. Staff at check in were lovely, our room was fabulous. The pool was lovely as was the walk on the hotel and golf course grounds. Breakfast was lovely and the restaurant was a lovely setting ",4,2017,08,09
238,Family get together,"Fantastic experience, excellent staff. Really relaxing stay with family ( aged from 9 months to 70+)  Games room went down really well with the younger children in the party while the 6k of walking/jogging paths around the resort were great for adults.",5,2017,08,09
238,Birthday weekend,"This Hotel  offers a five star Quality . Don’t think it delivers on the rating though. Don’t get me wrong it’s a nice hotel in a nice location. It certainly has five star prices.
We booked this for an birthday weekend. We had 10 rooms and 20 people staying. All commented that the rooms were of a high quality. We ate in the bar on the Saturday night and the bar staff were so helpful in trying to cater for all our group. They put us in the restaurant and they let us chose from the bar menu. The person who looked after us was so helpful. Nothing was a problem to him. I wish I got his name so I could mention him in this review.
He also went out of his way on the Sunday night when some of the family were playing pool. He brought extra chairs and hot towels. He even went and found some chalk for the pool ques after reception could not find any.

We booked a meal on the Sunday night. Bit of a problem in relation to the time we booked the table for. We had to change the time from 7.30pm to 7 pm at the request of the hotel a week before. But when we arrived down at 7pm the table was not ready as they said it was for 7.30pm. The reason the time was changed was the hotel wanted the children out of the restaurant by 9pm. We had no small children as the youngest was 11 and the next was 16.So we went to the bar to gets some drinks and wait. When we did sit down they rushed us to order our starters and the person looking after us was not the friendliest person. We had a problem with the Duck and they did come out and offer something else but we all had our meals nearly finished. I know it’s a small thing but not even taken off the bill.
We also had a problem with the bill when we checked out but to be fair it was sorted out . 

But the real problem which is not shown on the web site was the strange hours for children in the pool. No children (under 16) in the pool between 12-3.pm. there was only five us in the pool and we were approached and told about the rule. When I looked around there was only a handful of people in the pool. The reason we got in was there was no person on the pool reception when we went in. Still that’s something for families to watch out for . I had never some across this rule for this time period before. it’s funny they have this special steps in reception for the children to climb up when you check in and then have this rule for the pool. They are trying to be child friendly but ….

We booked Golf of the Saturday. There are two courses. Don’t play the Heath as the other course is better. You have to drive round to it but only five minutes away. 

To sum it up we had a great weekend but for the money we paid I excepted more . If you are looking for five star you might be disappointed.",4,2017,08,08
238,Very good in parts,"The room was lovely. Our daugters were delighted with their own kids robes and slippers. The pool area was great and the staff were very friendly and helpful. Hairdryers fabulous.

We ate at the bar on the night of our arrival. The food was ok. Freezer to fryer and the whole bar smells like a chipper. One daugher had meatballs which were not great. Chips were poor. Our first waiter, an older gentleman was just lovely and chatty. We moved down to the conservatory area of the bar after dinner, tables not cleared down properly, a precursory wipe with a cloth. I got the impression that the staff were students just working for the summer for college money. Was most disappointed with the food and service. We ate out the second night.

Breakfast was o.k. Scrambled eggs were over cooked. My husband had poached eggs, he asked for them with a soft yolk and they were hard. I've had better hotel breakfasts.

The room cleaning staff were fabulous, always friendly and smiling.

We didn't see any of the grounds as we were out seeing Wicklow all day.

A little rack of movies is wheeled out in the evening and you can choose a DVD to watch in your room. A lovely touch.",4,2017,08,08
238,Golf at Druids Glen or the K Club?,"I had the pleasure of playing Golf at both K Club and Druids Glen last week. The K Club was a fun day out, but Druids Glen was a better course. 
   The K Club leverages every piece of Ryder Cup memorabilia. They even include the names of the 2 teams on your score card, even though the competition was played 10 years ago ! Their greens were slow, but had been recently cored and sanded, so we'll forgive them that. The course was generally in great condition and had many good, challenging holes. 
   However, hole for hole, Druids Glen was far better, and for half the price !. Many changes in direction and elevation, plus excellent use of water made it look like Ireland's version of Augusta. Interestingly, their greens had also been recently cored, but were very fast, maybe 12 on the stimp meter .The staff were great at both. I would play both again, but given the choice, would pick Druids every time.

The staff were good at both, but Druids again clearly excelled. Their staff were polite, attentive and engaging. Overall just top notch. The K club's wait-staff seemed over run and dis-interested in non-members.

Stayed July 2017, travelled as a couple",5,2017,08,08
238,One of the worst experiences we've had!,"My girlfriend and myself had been looking forward to this stay here for months as we were recommended here by her cousin. 

We arrived on the Friday evening late and we ate in the bar. The food was ok but the bar staff were extremely rude and in no way helpful. After our meal we had some drinks and then decided on a cocktail. I went to the bar to order and gave in my visa debit to pay and twice I was told your card has been declined, have you another card? I explained that there was nothing wrong with my card and could you try another machine.....eventually after 2 more unsuccessful tries the bar man decided to use another machine where my card worked first time! He then announced to me that they didn't have the ingredients to make the 2 cocktails I had paid for and could I pick another 2 for the same price?

The next evening at dinner in the restaurant the service was no better. We felt invisible in the restaurant as the manager was busy attending to a large loud group of women on a hen night and they were obviously more important. Again the food was ok but the service left a bitter taste in our mouth. 

It's hard to believe this is a 5 star resort cas we've stayed in 3 star resorts before and since where we have had a far nicer time and the staff have been far more professional than here. So dissatisfied with our experience. 

This place is Over Rated and too expensive!",1,2017,08,07
238,Lovely hotel in beautiful grounds ,"Visited the hotel for one night with my husband and two children. From the moment you arrive the staff are very friendly, professional and helpful. Hotel is spotless and has nice touches to make the stay that bit nicer. We ate in the bar area overlooking the golf course/wooded area. Service was a little slow but we weren't in a rush anywhere so it didn't matter. Breakfast was lovely. Used the pool twice and finished off our stay with a walk in the fab grounds around perimeter of golf course. We will be back! ",5,2017,08,01
238,Super stay in a super hotel - thanks to the wonderful staff.,"I rarely give a full score rating, but Druid's Glen Hotel deserves it. In particular the staff who were so professional, helpful, courteous and friendly - they gave what is a very comfortable, though not particularly plush hotel, that extra edge.  They were trained well and with visible management who served as well as just managed (not always the case).
It was my birthday and main receiption had a note of that and wished me happy birthday, the restaurant staff had a note and again best wishes and gave us a lovely table and housekeeping provided handmade Butlers chocolates & personalised note.
The bedroom & bathroom were both spacious and the bed was so comfortable and the views from our window were super - the nice weather did enhance the experience as there were nice walks around the grounds.  I availed of the spa, which was doing good business and had a lovely dinner in Hugos Restaurant - again the wait staff was helpful and informative & the food top class.  I would strongly recommend this hotel.  Our stay ended with a compimentary bottle of water each for our journey as we left reception after paying.   We will definitely be back. Congrats to Druids Glen management for this well run and friendly customer oriented hotel visit.",5,2017,07,31
238,Another wonderful visit ,"Just back yesterday from another wonderful short stay at the beautiful Druids Glen Hotel and this was an even better experience than a previous visit a few years ago.  A warm welcome, attentive staff, fantastic surrounds and wonderful service are just a few highlights.  We lived in Australia for years and have travelled quite a bit staying in many lovely places along the way and this place compares favourably to any of them in my opinion - it really is one my absolute favourites and a bit of a hidden gem in Ireland.   

It is the great staff team that make it, this Hotel clearly puts the customer front and centre but masters it with a genuine warmth that is attentive but not intrusive.  The service in the Thirteenth Bar was very good, the breakfast was lovely, staff were so friendly and engaging throughout the hotel and they were just great with our kids.  The mini bathrobes and slippers were a lovely touch! The beds are the best anywhere and the hotel overall has a lovely atmosphere and inviting feel to it.  A great stay for families and we can't wait to return, well done all at Druids Glen and thank you for a wonderful stay.",5,2017,07,29
238,Great hotel,"We had a lovely meal at the main golf club where it was not busy but very friendly 
Meal was well prepared and a reasonable price considering where we were
The main hotel is busy with lots of children around but well behaved
We played golf in the Heath course which has plenty of bunkers",5,2017,07,28
238,Fabulous stay at the Druids Glen,"Just after spending 2 nights staying in the Druids Glen as a birthday treat. Really could not fault the stay in any way. 
Staff are very accomadating and friendly, nothing seemed to be a problem for them
.
We had no children with us but from what I seen it is a very child friendly hotel, there is even a dvd player in the room with a selection of both childrens and adults dvds to choose from for free in the reception area. 

The spa was an enjoyable and relaxing experience and again the staff were very friendly. Pool and jacuzzi area also nice and relaxing after a long day of walking and enjoying the beautiful scenery around the hotel. 
When we returned to our room after our spa treatments the hotel had a little card wishing me a happy birthday along with some butlers chocolates which i thought was a lovely touch. 
 
Breakfast was top class, something for everyone , you could eat as much or as little as you wanted and again staff could not do enough for you. 
We ate in Hugos restaurant on one night. It is very fine dining. I had steak which was lovely however only for the steak I would of found it hard to choose something to my taste on the menu but I'm sure people who enjoy fine dining would find the menu very good. The bar menu looked great and would probably of suited my taste better. But all in all Hugos was something different and a very enjoyable experience. 

Thanks to the Druids Glen for a lovely relaxing break. We will definitely be recommending the hotel to friends and hopefully get the chance to return again in future. ",5,2017,07,28
238,"Beautiful Property, amazing room, awesome breakfast and lovely Staff","We stayed here for a night, and booked a superior King room. Upon arrival, we were upgraded to a Suite. The staff at the check-in desk was very friendly, they valet parked our car, and the gentleman who helped us with our luggage to room was very sweet.  The room itself was very well decorated and spacious. The view of the golf course on a beautiful rainy day was awesome. 
For dinner we asked for their recommendation, and the staff recommended we try Indian dinner at Chakra, which by far was our best Indian dinner outside India.
The following morning breakfast had plenty of choices for us as vegetarians and the staff at the restaurant was more than happy to offer extra help. 
Check out was a breeze, though we checked out a little after the check-out time, we never got those 'please vacate the room' calls. This hotel is highly recommended.",5,2017,07,23
238,Rip off lunch,"€7.50 for a bowl of ice cream. Rubbish lunch menu €15 for a salad.
€9 for a glass of white wine. Don't understand why the prices have to be so bad at lunchtime. Won't bother with this place again
The staff were lovely though!
",1,2017,07,23
238,Outstanding place with wonderful service,"We stayed here for 2 nights and enjoyed every minute of it. We received a very warm welcome, were taken up to our room and shown around. The room was extremely spaceous and so was the bathroom. Everything was also very clean. The food was of very high quality, both at Hugo's for dinner and at the breakfast buffet. But the most important thing was how each member of staff went out of their way to make the stay special, be it for a family with 4 children, a couple on a golf stay or a few friends enjoying the calm of the environment. A truly unique experience ! And to give just one example : when we checked out we both received a bottle of water ""for the road""!",5,2017,07,22
238,Ok,"Just back from druids glen hotel the room we where in fabulous,Sadly I have to tell you the food in the hotel was off very poor quality,who would expect to see frozen chips in a 5 star hotel sadly some major improvements on the food is needed Staff are superb ",2,2017,07,22
238,Quiet stay,"Hotel is very suitable for a quiet break. Rooms are spacious and clean and en suite has a bath and small shower. Breakfast was self service but with plenty of choice - fruits, cereals, continental and cooked Irish breakfast as well as pancakes and omelettes cooked while you wait. Ideal vacation for golfers.",4,2017,07,21
238,One of my Favourite Hotels,"My boyfriend treated me to a weekend in Druids Glen and it was by far one the best weekends. On check in the lady was very friendly and efficient and even provided us with a map off our surrounding areas and recommended trails for us to do during our stay. We arrived late the Friday evening and went straight to the bar to watch the Ireland match. The bar menu was cheap for a five star hotel. I got a bottle of wine and the waiter poured for me, he was very attentive the whole night and even brought us over some hummus nuts to try which were different but full of flavour. The bar did lack atmosphere do especially as was a Friday night. The next morning we were up early to do our walks and hikes, the surrounding areas of Wicklow are beyond stunning we did the Sally Gap, Wicklow Way, Powerscourt Waterfall and Glendalough in our weekend none were a far journey from Druids Glen. The bedrooms were spacious and we had a balcony, the bathroom had a big bath and the bed was like a cloud. We went to the pool on our last morning and you could not swing an arm in the pool without hitting a child it was crazy busy full of kids so we stayed in the jacuzzi, sauna and plunge pool for the majority of the time. I will defiantly come back to Druids Glen in the future a beautiful place in the heart of Wicklow.  ",5,2017,07,21
238,Beautiful hotel,I attended a wedding reception in the Druids Glen hotel. What a lovely hotel this is. Set in beautiful grounds which looked stunning on one of the sunniest days of the year. The hotel is beautifully maintained throughout. Our room for the night was sheer luxury. A beautiful soft bed complete with chocolate on the pillow. Bathroom was excellent with lovely complimentary toiletries. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly. The wedding reception was outstanding. The morning breakfast was gorgeous. There was even a fresh omelette and pancake station. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay.   ,5,2017,07,20
238,"Great hotel, food needs work","Been coming here for years. Between weddings, conferences and more recently family weekends. Always great. Staff are fantastic and the rooms are lovely. Overall the hotel needs a little bit of an update at this stage. The breakfast is great but the bar food needs work. Very expensive for what it is despite trying a lot of options over various trips it's mediocre. Staples like steaks and burgers should be great but they're not. Just get the sense that you're being robbed. That being said we do still love it and the kids always have fun ",4,2017,07,17
238,Relaxing Stay,"I would highly recommend a stay in the Druids Glen Hotel. Whilst we were booking in we were offered hot towels to freshen up, I thought this was a lovely touch. The staff were welcoming and friendly. The room was lovely. My husband used the pool and Jacuzzi which he found relaxing.We had dinner in the restaurant which was excellent. The staff were friendly and very attentive. We sat outside for a drink which was relaxing. We had breakfast the next morning we had an extensive selection. I will definitely be back.",5,2017,07,16
238,Fabulous hotel with the nicest staff,"Me, my husband and 3 kids stayed here recently as we wanted to stay somewhere nice but somewhere were kids were welcome too. We couldn't of picked a nicer hotel, from the moment we arrived the staff couldn't do enough for us. We had a fabulous time here the food is excellent, the pool was brilliant for the kids and I had a truly relaxing time in the spa. There is a playground and a kids playroom as well as activity packs for the kids to keep them entertained. There is also a wide selection of kids DVDs for you to borrow and play in your room. The hotel and its grounds are stunning and the atmosphere is so warm and welcoming, we would definitely stay here again. The staff make this hotel, every single one of them were so friendly and helpful they are a credit to Druids Glen.",5,2017,07,16
238,Excellent Service From Stephen,"My husband and I attended a wedding here recently and it was such a beautiful setting. Everything seemed to go perfectly and there was a nice selection of canapes, icecream etc while we chatted in the private section before entering the dining hall.
One thing i would say is that more seating in this area would be helpful for girls in heels. 

The food for the wedding meal itself was delicious, as were the decorations and drink. However what made the experience for myself and everyone at my table was the service of our waiter Stephen. He was friendly, funny, helpful and exceptional at his job. The following day he was also working during the bbq the couple held and again (despite probably not getting much sleep) he was fantastic in every way!",4,2017,07,14
238,Fabulous,"I stayed a night in Druids Glen with my boyfriend last weekend to celebrate his birthday and we were both delighted that we did. Check in was very efficient and the hot towels to freshen up were a lovely touch. I opted for the Superior King room and it was wonderful-very spacious with a beautiful view of the golf course. The L'Occitane toiletries were a great touch, as was the note and complimentary box of chocolates left in the room for my boyfriend's birthday. We each had a full body massage in the spa the next morning and were delighted. The pool, sauna, plunge pool and steam room are fantastic! The relaxation area in the spa is a real treat and the complimentary sorbet after the treatment was very refreshing. We got breakfast to our room and it was absolutely fine, but perhaps it would be nice to have a bit more variety on the hot menu such as hash browns etc. Check out was similarly efficient and the complimentary bottles of water were very appreciated, as we were setting out for the day to Glendalough. We will 100% be back. ",5,2017,07,14
238,Much improved,Revisited this hotel after previously reviewing it ( didn't live up to its usual standards on last visit) attended again with family and a baby but the difference in the staff is impeccable. Baby's food arrived first without having to ask! Food was its usual standard excellent. Would recommend it as a family friendly place and would say it's much improved since my previous visit. ,4,2017,07,13
238,Amazing from start to finish ,"I recently stayed with my friend as a birthday treat. Where do I start with such an amazing weekend.. Staff extremely helpful on arrival.. Hot towels to freshen up at check in.. Bedroom fab, 2 double beds in twin room with best pillows I've ever slept on!! 
I had contacted the hotel to organise champagne for the room on arrival.. At dinner that evening (duck starter the highlight) the dessert came out with a candle and happy birthday (not requested by me but such a nice touch). Breakfast both days amazing. 
Spent the morning in the pool area, sauna, steam room, plunge pool, jacuzzi. Top class. Afternoon had spa treatment. I had a facial, my friend the massage. Both of us highly impressed with our treatment and staff. Relaxation room after I feel asleep (may have been down to the champagne and wine the night before). Thoroughly enjoyed our stay, Wicklow a beautiful spot and will definitely stay at Druids Glen again in the near future. 
Worth every penny!! ",5,2017,07,13
238,Brilliant Resort,"We did a 10 tour of Ireland, staying in 4 and 5 star hotels. Druids Glen was our final stop on the tour and it turned out to be the best hotel. So good in fact, we stayed an extra two days!

The hotel staff could not do enough to help us. The hotel was modern, spacious, had great rooms and everything worked! The food was excellent (with the summer BBQ buffet an unexpected bonus) and the bars were good fun. The facilities were very good, with two golf courses, a well kitted out gym, a spa and a pool. There was lots to do for kids also, including a games room and bikes for the trails round the resort. 

The hotel was pretty close (20 mi by car) to Dublin and made a great base. It was also very close to the cool little seaside town of Greystones

Again, the staff were brilliant 

",5,2017,07,11
238,Lovely Hotel,"We loved the hotel. Lovely rooms and a good bar and restaurant. Really enjoyed the Glen course, however, the Heath course isn't very interesting and just a bit of a long walk! 
Had a few issues with billing which were resolved and it took a full week before my credit card was reimbursed. We would go back especially for the Golf at the Glen.",4,2017,07,11
238,Amazing Stay with the Best Breakfast in Ireland,"My Girlfriend and I stayed at the Druids Glenn recently for two nights. We felt welcomed from the moment we arrived. A porter gathered all our luggage and had it delivered to the room.

There was some lovely touches which very unique and memorable from being given refreshing hot towels at check in, welcoming gifts in the room, an omelette station at breakfast where the chef went out of his way to make a 3 egg white omelette every morning for us and of course their famous ice cream station at reception.

The staff were second to none in terms of providing a first class service. They were very pleasant, approachable and went the extra mile to make you feel comfortable, relaxed and accommodate a lovely stay. 

Breakfast was the best we have ever had with such a great selection and we have stayed in many great hotels in Ireland over the years. As breakfast goes, this is simply the best.

Expecting something casual, we went to Hugos bar and Restaurant at the hotel on our first night and it far exceeded our expectations. We received top class service once again and such tasty food that we couldn't but come back here again on the second night.

Our room was very spacious, comfortable providing a great view of the golf course. There was a flat screen TV with great HD quality to enjoy from the comfiest bed ever. We slept great every night and did not hear a sound. The bathroom was amazing with L’occitane beauty products.

It is a great location to escape from the busy city life and still be in close proximity to visit amazing places like Powerscourt Gardens, Glendalough, Bray-Greystones cliffwalk and of course Dundrum Shopping centre.

The gym and leisure centre can not be overlooked either, overall it would be very hard to fault this gym.This will be the first of many stays here.",5,2017,07,11
238,A wonderful birthday gift.,Exceptionally beautiful hotel with magnificent facilities.  Impeccably dressed staff who fall over themselves to assist you . Concierge service extremely efficient. Spa facilities share a changing room which can be off putting to some. Even gave me a birthday desert.  Thanks again guys.,5,2017,07,09
238,Lovely one night stay,My husband and I stayed here for one night recently and we were very impressed with this hotel. We were greeted at reception with warm cloths to refresh us after our journey and I thought this was a nice touch. Check in was swift and the staff were all very friendly. Our room was very comfortable and the bed was fabulous. We ate in the bar and the food was good. A very nice hotel that I hope to return to in the future.,4,2017,07,09
238,Wonderful hotel,"We stayed at Druids Glen twice during our visit to Ireland, each time for about 4 nights or so. The rooms are very good size and everything is in top shape. Breakfast is very good. they have some little touches that makes this hotel very unique. For example, at night, the close the hallway doors and put a sign up to ask guest to be quiet since people are asleep. I wish more hotels would do that. They give a hot towel on arrival to refresh yourself and on departure they give you a bottle of water to take with you. But I was curious to know why did we have chocolate mints on our beds at turn down during our first visit but not during our second visit? Or why did they stop serving crepes in the morning and started to serve not very good pancakes? I have very picky when it  comes to hotel and this definitely met my standards.",5,2017,07,06
238,Such a lovely spot,"This was an amazing welcome, delicious food and lovely space. Very hard not to fault this gem really - would go more often if it was that bit nearer but nice to have it as a destination now and agin. Will be back. For pleasure next time (not business).",5,2017,07,05
238,Great stay!,Hotel was very welcoming which made a fabulous 4 night stay.  Modern comfortable room and great breakfast. Thank you to Maeve for looking after us in Hugo's restaurant and Rob was great sorting everything for us in the pro shop. Played both courses and enjoyed them both. Will return soon.,5,2017,07,05
238,Five Star Plus!,"Our seventh stay here and yet again everything was fabulous!  Lovely to see so many staff from our previous visits - always welcomed back like old friends.  Have to be the best team ever!  Nothing is too much trouble.  Stayed in one of the beautiful rooms overlooking the stunning golf course, breakfasts brilliant, loved the new menu in the bar. For the first time we ate in the club house where the food was delicious and the welcome from the two chaps working there was in true Druids Glen stye!!  On a beautiful evening it was lovely to be able to walk the Woodland Trail from the Hotel to the Club House. It was raining when we left so the Hotel taxi picked us up to take us back! Hope to be back again soon.  Thank you!",5,2017,07,04
238,Stunning ,"Played a round of golf here with my two friends we spent the day in awe of this course, the most stunning course I've ever played on and will hopefully be back very soon. 

This is a must see if visiting of from Ireland you will not be disappointed ",5,2017,07,03
238,5* service,"Having previously stayed at Druids Glen we had an issue which at the time wasn't passed onto the management chain properly,but this was down to an individual rather than Druids Glen. When our issue did get to the right people, it was handed brilliantly, professionally and how you would expect of such an establishment. The management and staff couldn't  be more friendly and helpful from start to finish and the staff are the jewel in the crown of Druids Glen.
The surrounding grounds are well maintained and worth a walk around. The bar food is good if a little expensive, and the breakfast is excellent and plentiful with a good choice.",5,2017,07,02
238,Enjoyable short break with infant,"We're a young couple who were travelling for the first time with our four month old. I can't recommend Druids Glen highly enough for a family friendly luxury break. We were apprehensive due to never having taken out baby away on an overnight stay but it all went perfectly thanks to the incredible staff and amenities. We were never made to feel out of place and we were greeted with smiles and kind words towards our little one. Everyone was so accommodating and friendly. The leisure facilities were excellent, with baby changing and family changing rooms just off the poolside so I could change baby straight away after a dip (very generous and lengthy allocated family swim times ) we stayed in a deluxe king room which was spacious and well appointed. We left behind a well loved baby comforter which staff have kindly posted back to us. We will definitely be back! ",5,2017,07,02
238,Would not take one night booking,"I have just tried to book one night in the hotel, and I was told that they will only accept a two night booking. The booking is for three weeks time and is on a Saturday night. I was told that when it is busy, the min stay is 2 nights. This is just ridiculous!

We are locals, and we were given a voucher to stay in the hotel. We have an event we are attending in the area, and though it would be a good excuse to have a night away. But now if we want to use a gift we were given, we have to pay for an additional night.

I have stayed in a lot of hotels, and I have never heard of such a ridiculous policy.
This is totally unfair and very annoying.",1,2017,06,29
238,Pleasant but...,"My husband, daughter and I have just returned home from a two night package stay. Our room was superb and the grounds of the hotel great. We really enjoyed the walk over to The druids glen golf course clubhouse.

For our daughter the pool and druids den were a fantastic addition. My only feedback would be that the experience is very dependent on staff. We found the staff on day one and two of our stay had no interest in us or to even say hello to our daughter. However, on day three when we were leaving the staff were amazing and made our little girls day. We have stayed in powerscourt on a few occasions and generally thought it slightly more family focused and luxurious.",4,2017,06,28
238,Exceptional-My favourite hotel,"I love this hotel. The staff are fantastic so professional and friendly. The receptionist I think who is from Mayo is a lady so patient and very well informed. We got some small bottles of water from her before we went on the trail walk and she advised we should go to the roof top terrace at Woodstock house and enjoy the views. It was beautiful. 

The rooms are clean, comfortable and beautifully decorated. Great air conditioning in the rooms. 

The food for breakfast, bar food and restaurant dinner was all superb. The Druids cocktail you have to try delicious!! I can't wait to return and maybe next time we might have a balcony room facing the course. 

Thanks for a lovely stay. ",5,2017,06,26
238,Dream Resort ,Druid Glen Resort was part of our vacation package and what a wonderful delight and surprise. It was a luxurious experience for 2 wonderful nights. The beds were large and comfy with great bedding. A big bathroom. Slippers and robes provided. Turn down service with chocolates. My sister in law and I made an appointment for a massage while my husband and daughter played a round of golf on a links style course in Ireland! Very reasonably priced too. On their major list of things to do! Everyone there was so nice and welcoming and helpful. We ate our meal in the casual bar restaurant and it was fantastic. The next morning the breakfast buffet was fabulous. I just can't say enough good things about this Resort. ,5,2017,06,21
238,Masters Golf Trip,"2 day golf trip for 12 guys over the golf masters Sunday was fantastic. Both courses where amazing best I've played in all Ireland. Breakfast was exceptional & the resort is beautiful, the only thing that could improve is a good residents bar like Carton House as we where rushed back to our rooms once the golf finished at 12 o'clock & the bar shut. Apart from that are party will definitely return to play both courses next April.",4,2017,06,20
238,Fantastic,"Just back from three night stay with my wife and two year old son. Had a really fantastic time. Hotel is beautiful and staff are amazing. Had wonderful meal in Hugo's on first night - definitely recommend. Food great and service very good all round. Loic (apologies if I am wrong in the spelling - who also recommended a trip to p'court waterfall) was very attentive and was great with my son also - making us feel at ease and able to enjoy the meal. All staff were superb and resort was very child-friendly, with a play park on site and a games room which was enjoyed by kids of all ages. Great selection at breakfast and good menu in bar for food the other nights. Pool area very good with a large pool and sauna steam room area also. I cannot recommend this resort highly enough. Will definitely be back!!",5,2017,06,20
238,Great country getaway!!,"I was staying for a conference for a couple of days and I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. My room was spacious and clean, and they had great facilities there with a gym and swimming pool which were a good size. The scenery around the hotel was also beautiful. The staff and food was 1st rate and I enjoyed every meal.",5,2017,06,19
238,Excellent!! ,Beautiful spot! From the moment we arrived we were very well looked after. The team of people working here are a true credit to the resort and extremely customer focused. Will definitely be back! Thanks for a great stay. ,5,2017,06,18
238,We loved this hotel!,"Our family decided to take a trip to Ireland. We wanted to see the countryside and had a car, so we picked Druids Glen as our first place to stay. This hotel was perfect in every way. Big rooms, fantastic mattresses on the beds. Robes and slippers for every family member. The walking trails were great with many photo opps. 

We decided to have dinner on site and I'm glad we did. Told that the bar was family friendly, we at down at a table. Sure enough, families started to arrive and we had children from 2 months  to 12 years all around us. It was comfortable and friendly. Wait staff was very accommodating and asked if there was anything else they could do for us. 

I would not hesitate to make reservations here again. ",5,2017,06,17
238,Honeymoon Trip,"DO IT! This place was awesome and BY FAR the best stay on our trip all over Ireland. The place is gorgeous, it has a million amenities (spa, golf pro shop, restaurants of different kinds, etc). The room was perfect- king bed with a super comfy mattress topper, spacious, separate shower and bathtub, big bathroom, big tv, and nice view of a grassy area. The staff is so nice and helpful (like almost too nice, they give you bottled water on your way out!). We loved it here and would love to stay here again!",5,2017,06,14
238,REALLY BEST HOTEL EVER,I have stayed in this hotel many times and have always received the same excellent customer service from concierge to cleaning staff.   However this time we had a few children issues and this is where the Reception and dining staff yet again proved themselves to be beyond professional and friendly - I look forward to coming back very soon to this wonderful hotel -special thanks to Amy on Reception and the lovely German (?) lady in charge of Breakfast in Hugos -,5,2017,06,12
238,My favourite hotel!,"Myself and my husband got married in Dec 2013 and we actually spent the final 3 days of our honeymoon in Druids Glen Hotel. 
When the staff realised we were on our honeymoon they sent up complimentary strawberries & cream and champagne. We ended up staying for a night extra than we planned. We loved everything about the hotel. It was quiet, gorgeous atmosphere, friendly staff and amazing food. The spa was beautiful and I can honestly say I had the best massage and facial I ever had. I can't wait to return for our anniversary this year!! ",5,2017,06,11
238," BEST HOTEL IN IRELAND! ","This hotel is just beyond expectations! 

We got married here in May & wow wow wow! We also stayed in August last year as a regular guest & I cannot fault the hotel at all!

Rooms - they are huge! Absolutely beautiful comfortable all the amenities you would need & the bathroom is huge

Facilities - spa amazing, pool and sauna etc great for families and clean

Food - amazing, my fav is the 13th bar just so gorgeous in summer or winter and so comfortable we took over this room. Hugo's restaurant great if u like fancier food too. Breakfast is the best I've had & loads of our guests said the same thing. And our wedding food was amazing!! 

Staff - out of this world! Teague on the front what a gent! He's just amazing! Receptions staff couldn't of done more for us, banqueting staff amazing! I just cannot fault anyone at all! 

This hotel is a must visit! Great location for all of Wicklow and not far from Dublin! You must stay here! ",5,2017,06,08
238,1 night stay for a bit of pampering,"Room was stunning, overlooking the golf course, had everything you could possibly need. The staff were warm and friendly and couldn't do enough for you. Had dinner in Hugos and it was fabulous, and the staff were suberb. The pool was lovely and the grounds immaculate. I can't say enough about it, definitely the nicest, most professional and friendliest hotel I have stayed in. Will be back.",5,2017,06,08
238,Good nice convenient hotel for golfers,"Druids Glen hotel is a world of contrasts. Most amiable friendly helpful staff, quiet rooms, outstanding breakfast, fast and working Wifi on one hand.  On the other hand, highly praised Hugo's fine dining restaurant serving overcooked bland food. The waiter ""knew"" how we should enjoy our food, and it was served the way he likes it and ordered it.  Fortunately, their café serves a nice fish n'chips with good ale, a nice change to the poor wine selection at Hugo's.",4,2017,06,08
238,Druids Glen Co Wicklow Secret Hotel Inspector reivew,"Hmmm .... old adage here they need to address.   If your staff are unhappy so are your guests.   Staffing is a major issue however having said that the restaurant staff and servers are excellent.  A bit of disgruntlement in the background which the hotel inspector well inspected... it appears they lost a lot of staff due to bad management!   also, it appears they altered their waiting and floor staffs tips leaving a lot to be desired this also applied with the bar staff and the kitchen staff!  The hotel inspector kept ears open .... ""is it legal to take tips back from staff who once had it as part of their low paid wage?? I think not!

Staff restaurant/bar: excellent both barstaff and the waiters were exceptional.  Young man kyle well he is truly a gentleman.  Nothing too much to ask he would do it.    
Staff: dinner service: here too we noticed disgruntled staff! Here too the ""tips"" had lost the hotel several employees - not a nice feeling when you have people who you hear talking about the CEO changing their pay and not listening to their needs.  Management here Patrick not pleasant!  
Food: exceptional and elaborate wine list
Service: excellent
Rooms: excellent

we loved our stay in this hotel resort and the golf course was a pure pleasure to play on.    

Addendum: For adults, golfers, spa is excellent, food is excellent, management could do with a refresher course on manners. Floor staff excellent another person to be mentioned here is an indian gent Bjoy I believe a true gentleman

Reception: definitely a mention could not be more helpful if they tried

overall: CEO needs to listen to staff because if you do not you will not have any left!  Still do not believe the tips issue is legal

romantic weekend, holiday, child friendly, spa excellent and golf a pleasure

fix the staff issue and perhaps the secret hotel inspector will rethink 3 stars 

regular visitor here and I simply cannot forget to mention the doorman whom I did not get his name he was exceptional",3,2017,06,07
238,Something different,"Situated in the Newtown Mount Kennedy heartland in County Wicklow , easily accessed from the N11 heading south from Bray or take the exit before to drive through typical old style Irish country roads .The Hotel is modern the surroundings are countryside plenty of space to take a quite walk a great playground for children plus spa and swimming . We dined in the restaurant which was full of charm , the staff to say they were helpful would be an understatement they were excellent the food was so well presented it was a shame to disturd the plate which was a work of art , the flavour the flavour over each course yum yum . ",4,2017,06,06
238,Thoroughly Enjoyed,"I honestly have overlooked this hotel for too long and then had the option to go a few weeks back. I don't know what I was expecting but I was very happy when I arrived. The hotel if bright, spacious and contemporary. They are family friendly and easily accommodate you children as well as every other type of guest, be it business or pleasure.
Check in was fast, efficient and our room was ready for an early check in which was a nice bonus. And its often the little things like the hot towels on arrival to freshen up that stick in my mind. Not enough hotels focus on these little things but Druids Glenn does. 
Our family room was more that adequate size wise with 2 large double beds and more than enough room for a travel cot ,so we were very comfortable.
1 thing worth noting, it was hot the days I was there and thankfully there was AC in the room. You'd be surprised how many hotels I've stayed in in Ireland without AC.Now in fairness the AC wasn't very good but I'd hate to have tried sleeping without it that day.
Breakfast and dinner was excellent, plenty to choose from and top notch quality. 
While I didn't have a round of golf I did do the walk around part of it and the course is stunning. 
An often overlooked hotel by me is now going to be up high on my lift from now on and I do think I'll be back in the coming weeks i enjoyed so much.",5,2017,06,06
238,Nice location,Hi stayed here with family - some 5star service missing in the restaurant & room had dirty cups and limited toiletries for 4 people. Reception staff were very helpful. Spa was lovely as was pool area. Walked to the golf club house and got the hotel car back lovely walk. Near to grey stones. ,4,2017,06,05
238,Great hotel - beautiful location,"I received a lovely warm welcome on arrival which included a nice touch of warm scented towel to freshen up. 

The bedroom was lovely. A good size, comfortable bed and good shower. We dined in the restaurant which was very good as was breakfast the next day which had a great selection and was above most breakfasts I've had in any hotel in Ireland or abroad with touches like fresh honey straight from the hive, homemade granola and freshly squeezed juice.  

There is a lovely walk on the ground around the golf course, a lovely terrace for pre dinner drinks and I enjoyed the pool and jacuzzi. 

We went on a Friday night and got an exceptionally impressive rate for B&B&D. I would highly recommend this hotel and will definitely visit again myself.",5,2017,06,04
238,A lovely escape,"I just have to say what a real treat it is to visit the health club here. The staff are so professional and friendly. The place is immaculate and it feels a little decadent while you are lounging in the pool looking out over the Wicklow hills, or chilling in the brand new aromatic steam room. It's just a nice treat to come here, and again it's the diligence of all the staff and the pride that they take in their jobs that makes it. I couldn't recommend it more, the best hotel in Wicklow. ",5,2017,06,03
238,Absolutely fantastic stay!,"Loved everything about this hotel! The staff are absolutely amazing! The room is very clean and spacious with very comfortable beds! The grounds on the property is truly beautiful! Dinner at bar section of the hotel was very delicious! Even through French Toast was not available at breakfast, it was made for me upon request ---and was so delicious! Used the gym on premises and it had enough equipments for a decent work out. Everything surpassed my expectations & could not ask for anything more! Highly recommended!",5,2017,06,02
238,Perfection,"Beautiful hotel and grounds, great staff and excellent food. Hotel was quite busy but this didn't adversely effect the service.  

Sometimes this hotel appears on Groupon, but just for one night. You really need to stay longer to appreciate just how good this hotel is. 

That's it, can't wait to go again, this time I'll bring my golf clubs.",5,2017,05,30
238,2nd time even better !! ,"Had our first visit here in Jan and couldn't wait to return again in easter. Staff again go out of their way to make you feel special....from check in staff to the waiting staff at breakfast. I had mentioned during booking that it was our 10 year old daughters birthday which they mentioned at check in and again recognised this with a box of chocs and little card delivered to the room a few hours after check in. She was so chuffed.  Easter sat evening we had a t shirt delivered to the room for her to wear for the easter egg Hunt on easter Sunday morning.  The kids had a ball each getting an easter egg at the end of the hunt.  Breakfast selection is unreal. We rolled out of the dining room on both mornings!! Pancake station kept our daughter going back for more !!! Gym is great if a little warm. Rooms really clean and well decorated.  Bathroom products really high quality. 
Cannot wait to return again during the summer. 
Special mention to one of the staff who's name we can't remember unfortunately.  Her name badge had Donegal mentioned on it. She is so super to deal with. Sp efficient and friendly.  Just wish I could remember her name!! ",5,2017,05,29
238,Excellent service ,"Spent one night at Druids Glen and wish it was more. The service from check in to departure was impeccable. We felt so welcome and at ease. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is the facility, although still above average, is starting to look a bit tired. ",4,2017,05,29
238,Great night away with the girls!,"Just returned from a night away with the girls. There were six of us booked in for a catch up overnight stay with dinner.
The staff at check in were extremely helpful and efficient. We went to the bar for lunch. My crab and avocado salad was delicious. Two of my friends had the chowder which was a definite winner also. We were very well looked after.
The rooms were spacious, came equipped with bath robes, slippers, hairdryer, ironing board and toiletries as well as water.
At dinner all food allergies etc were no problem and service prompt.
Breakfast was massive with buffet for breads, cereals, fruit and hot food. They even had a separate station for omelettes and crepes.

We had a fantastic time and will be back for our next girlie get together ",5,2017,05,28
238,Appalling food,"I ordered cod and chips. The fish was the worst I ever encountered. I complained and the staff replaced the meal and to their credit gave a complimentary drink while I waited for the second effort at cod n chips. However round 2 was marginally better. The manageress came over and apologised and could not have been nicer, however at that stage I was starving and ate half of the second effort. I have issue with the chef and truly awful effort that he is presenting as cod. Others in my party had average food for what were inflated prices.
Avoid.",1,2017,05,28
238,Wedding,"Rooms very spacious provide with robes, slippers, iron, ironing board, toiletries.

There is a pool (don't forget your hat must be worn at all times)

Breakfast was included with our room which was a large selection. 

Overall the place is huge we stayed for 1 night and were treated extremely well.

",4,2017,05,28
238,Lovely Golf Resort & Spa,"This is an upscale golf resort with beautiful rooms, nice spa & helpful staff. 

My room was very large & nicely decorated.  It offered air conditioning, plush carpet and a comfy seating area.  The bath included a separate shower and tub and l'occitane amenities.   

The spa was relaxing and the technicians well trained.  All in all, a perfect end to my Irish adventure.

The resort is well known for it's golf courses and I am told is ranked in the top 5 Parkland Courses in Ireland.  

I will most definitely be returning to this lovely resort.",5,2017,05,28
238,Great Classic Hotel,Stayed here 1 night and what a beautiful hotel that really exudes Ireland. Beautiful grounds and friendly staff.  Rooms and bathroom are very large.   The views from the hotel are what you imagine Ireland to deliver ,5,2017,05,27
238,Great weekend away with the kids,"We were here twice in the last 6 months, once in the Autumn and once in the Spring and both times were great. Staff very friendly, rooms spacious and modern with good blackout blinds. 

There's a small playground area for the kids, plus some nice walks through the woods around the golf course (ask reception for a map) that the kids enjoyed in the Autumn (lots of conkers, large pine cones, etc). Easy to forget how much fun the little things can be for kids! 

Didn't play it this time, but the golf course is fantastic from previous experience. Food in both the main restaurant and the bar was delicious.  Will definitely be back!",5,2017,05,26
238,Happy days,Loved every minute of our stay from the minute we arrived at reception we were greeted by a friendly smile . We have to say that all staff were extremely friendly and nothing was a problem. Our room was clean very spacious tea /coffee making available. Complimentary water every day . We enjoyed our walks around the grounds and after our 5k walk was delighted to come uponWoodstock House where we callin for a drink the view from the top of this building is fab. The courtesy taxi back to hotel was greatly appreciated. Breakfast in the morning s was beautiful loads to choose from and a section of gluten free cereals and breads . Can t wait to go back  loved it ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,5,2017,05,25
238,"Druids Glen, truly stunning Golf resort","Druids Glen Hotel & Golf Resort is simply excellent. 
The Hotel was originally built by The Marriott Group and has that feel, but since it was bought by a local consortium, they have personalized the hotel and put their stamp on it.
The rooms are as your would expect, excellent and all the resort facilities were first class. We visited all the bars, bistro and restaurant and all were first class. good menu choice and excellent fresh produce, good wind and beer selection and of course the whiskies! The staff were marvelous, no matter what their task, they were happy and happy to see you! they were knowledgeable and happy to help.
The heath Golf course is a challenge, especially as we had wind and driving rain, but the course is designed to cope with this and the quality of each hole was first class. there was not a poor hole on the course. we were greeted by Paul, the official starter who was welcoming and very helpful, really made you feel at home.
The Glen course is simply fabulous, with many holes upstaging Augusta albeit not yet in full bloom. this was truly an experience. not easy by any means as you have to carefully navigate your way round each hole carefully as trouble lurks everywhere! We played it on two days and cannot fault it.
The Glen clubhouse is charming being hosted in a wonderful Georgian mansion. The Stuart, Christi was charming and could not have made you feel more comfortable, so much so we ate an evening meal there on our wedding anniversary, and taking advantage of the courtesy car to take us between the resort and the Glen club house.
We had a visit to the Spa and again you could not fault the staff, facilities or the treatment.
So if you fancy an adventure to Ireland, I would thoroughly recommend this resort.",5,2017,05,25
238,One Night Stay - Chill and Golf,"Stayed at Druids as a birthday treat and what a treat it was.
From the moment we were greeted by the doorman, who couldn't do enough. Took my golf clubs, parked the car took our bags to our room.  Just great service.
Check in was swift and again with a smile and warm welcome. The room was big, well equipped and the bed very comfortable. We used the pool, steam etc. One tip is take a swimming cap, everyone who swims must wear one. We eat in Hugo's that night. Just first class, the food, the staff, the timings of everything. Just a great night.
Then there's the golf, Druids Glen at 75 euro was a steal. I have been fortunate enough to play many courses all over. But I think this one is the prettiest on the eye I have had the pleasure to play. Again the welcome was very friendly and informative, the course was in great condition.  Not a long course but one where you have to think a little.
All in all very much worth its 5 star rating, I can't wait to go back.",5,2017,05,24
238,Friendly & Relaxed Irish Elegance.,"My 2nd time to Druids Glen for 2 nights, you really feel like you are in the Garden of Ireland. Beautiful trees and greenery everywhere on the immaculate property.  Staff are so warm & friendly, as well as being absolute professionals. We upgraded to the Superior Rooms, definitely worth it, they are spacious, beds are so comfy and big bathrooms.  We also had a Juliette balcony which was great to enjoy some fresh air and the multiple birds singing.
We had breakfast included in our package which is a must. Delicious choices from fresh fruit,smoked salmon, pastries, bacon, tomatoes, eggs, Irish-made yogurts and even a chef to make a custom omelette or fresh crepe.- all so amazing. Good thing we hit the gym there for that.
For my nieces 21st birthday we also had Afternoon Tea. Very fancy treat that we loved. Thanks to Romy &Tina for making it a special stay.",5,2017,05,23
238,"Golfing holiday with my son and friends. Fell ""under the spell"" again. Just a great hotel. Everyone so efficient yet fre",Lovely superior room excellent food with a fabulous breakfast everything you could possibly want. Cannot wait to go back again. Also played golf this year on Druids Glen Golf Course and this is as good as it gets. Spectacular all round,5,2017,05,21
238,"Beautiful, peaceful place","This was a perfect last stop on our two-week tour of Ireland. It was a relaxing and quiet respite after a lot of driving. From doormen, to front desk, to wait staff, everyone was top-notch--friendly, helpful, professional--obviously well-trained by hospitality industry experts. Our room was very, very nice--attractive, spacious, comfortable, meticulous. There were plenty of outlets for charging devices and a beautiful view out our second-story french doors. Only suggestion would be a bit brighter lighting in the bathroom. We had a lovely dinner in the Thirteenth, Druids Glen's casual dining space. Service was excellent and attentive and the food was wonderful. Next morning's breakfast was the most gorgeous spread we'd seen in a buffet-style offering anywhere in Ireland. Didn't play golf, but course looks beautiful and I imagine a weekend of golf here would be fantastic. Druids Glen is about an hour from Dublin Airport, so it's a great place for that last night in the country without having to negotiate a busy Dublin hotel and streets.",5,2017,05,19
238,Girls spa break & dinner,"Spent a wonderful 24 hours being pampered! Spa treatment was fab and the relaxation room was exactly what it said on the tin ! Lovely hotel though physically looks a little imposing. Everything works so well, the staff are really easy and helpful, grounds amazing for walking through, incredible trees! 
What was most surprising and wow was dinner. It really was like going to a Michelin star restaurant , the lamb was like nothing I've tasted, they did say it was local! 
Had a really lovely break and only took 30 min home to Dublin which is always a bonus !",5,2017,05,19
238,Superb 5 Star hotel. ,"My husband, daughter and myself had a amazing and wonderful relaxing family break. 
Everyone so helpful. 
Children's facilities wonderful with play park, play den, children and adult dvds to borrow, board games and a lovely walk around golf course. 
Family swimming times which I thought was a wonderful idea for everyone. 
Food was lovely and breakfast delicious. 
Bedrooms well equipped and spacious. 
Our daughter loved her dressing gown and slippers and felt wonderful. 

A perfect break. ",5,2017,05,18
238,"Excellent conference facilities, true Irish hospitality ","Stayed for 3 nights on company conference, what a excellent choice great service.Located in heart of County Wicklow, regarded as the Garden County for its natural beauty, Druids Glen Resort provides a championship golf course, an Elemis spa and comprehensive meeting facilities.

Just a 10 minute drive from Greystones and within easy reach of the Sally Gap, Roundwood, Glendalough and Britta Bay, Druids Glen Resort is also just 25 miles away from Dublin.

Awarded 5-stars by the Irish Automobile Association and Failte Ireland, Druids Glen boasts 145 guestrooms, many with views over either the Wicklow Mountains or the golf course.

Highly recommended ",5,2017,05,18
238,Spellbinding Business Stay,"Druids Glen lies about 45 minutes outside of Dublin set in the hills of Wicklow. The hotel is a modern building with a nod to tradition.  

The rooms are spacious with two standard double beds, desk, two easy chairs and a bathroom the size of some hotel rooms I have stayed in. All have Juliet balconies. All are quiet and well insulated. 

Families are welcome and there are facilities for children on site including a small play room in the hotel and if you are a golf player there are two courses in a beautiful setting. 

For me, the stand out feature was the professionalism of the staff which, although Druids Glen is officially 'only' 4 star, is up to and better than many five star establishments. 

The food is both plentiful especially at breakfast and of a very height quality. I commend the chef and the rest of the brigade. 

If you are looking for a luxury break or an impressive business meeting venue, I without reservation can heartily recommend Druids Glen.",5,2017,05,18
238,Great hotel,"Stayed here for 2 nights as attending a wedding in the hotel. Couldn't recommend the place more, the staff really make this place amazing. Everyone is very friendly and helpful. Leisure facilities are good. Breakfast was really good, great selection and love the omelette station. C&B staff were also excellent, wedding was well organised and they helped everything flow seamlessly.",4,2017,05,18
238,Truly 5 star! ,"I visited Druids Glen for 3 nights in May with my partner. From the minute we walked in until we left, we were treated like royalty! 

It really is the small details that make this hotel exceptional, such as having a fire burning in your room when you arrive, your car being valeted for you, beautiful fresh flowers everywhere. Every need is preempted and nothing is too big an ask.

However, the real gems here are the staff! Many thanks to reception (Amy, Adrienne, Jo and Edel) for being so welcoming and helpful! Tadhg of course is always a true gentleman as well! Breakfast is amazing and only made better by the friendliness of Margita! Mark in the bar is always great banter.

Btw if you can get to the spa, I highly recommend it! 

Can't wait to come back here again! I liked it so much, we booked it for our wedding next year!",5,2017,05,18
238,Super hotel,"I have just stayed at this hotel for 5 days working on a event
This is one of the best hotels I have stayed at
I did not see or encounter a miserable member of staff
They where so helpful and friendly 
I arrived late on the Saturday night with all the equipment for the event and the sercuity 
Guy helped me park the truck and sorted me out booking in 
Superb
Bar staff where real good fun
As they say in Ireland having the crack
What a super place to stay
I would recommend it",5,2017,05,17
238,Brilliant stay,"Excellent room, 5 star luxury yet so child friendly, staff so helpful, playroom with all the toys the kids could want, fab pool, playground, the breakfast was out of this world we will be going back x",5,2017,05,16
238,Wedding,"Recently attended a great wedding at the Druid's Glen Hotel. 

We arrived well before the set check in time but they were quick to prioritise our rooms and get us in as quick as possible. 

The twin room was spotless and very spacious. The television had HD channels and lots of sports too, not that we could exploit it that much and the beds were super comfortable. 

Our dinner was great too and the breakfast had a great selection of cereals, fruits, cold meats, bread, nuts and seeds and of course the usual Irish fry up. My favourite thing about breakfast was the location. There is a huge space allocated for breakfast so it felt very quiet compared to the usual rush in most hotels. 

During my short time there, I didn't see one staff member who wasn't smiling and saying hello. This included everyone form the receptionists and concierge to the wait staff and room makers. 

The wedding ceremony took place in the hotel in a very well prepared room. The dinner room was beautiful too. The staff took great care of the wedding party. 

Not much I can pick fault with at all. The grounds are surroundings only add to the hotel. I would definitely recommended. ",5,2017,05,14
238,Ms J O Neill,"Myself and my daughter stayed at Druids Glen 9th to 11th May 2017
We had a lovely room very relaxing time and enjoyed a treatment each in the hotel spa. Both treatments were amazing and would definitely be repeated! 
My only gripe I'm afraid is the food in the bar... it was extremely average overpriced and I ordered the confuit leg of duck. It arrived super quick scalding on the skin and actually cold inside. The manager when I eventually caught her eye came over and  I explained. She apologised sincerely and got a fresh one? This also was out rather quickly. Similar problem but I let it go. It was a very special evening for my daughter and I didn't want to make too much of it. It certainly ruined my meal and my experience in the evening bar/food area was not good.It put us off trying Hugo Restaurant as well as putting a damper on the evening !
A pity because our stay was a good experience other than that. I think Druids Glen you could improve on this as it takes away from the wonderful overall ambience. ",3,2017,05,13
238,Not Great ,"I previously stayed here at Easter and it was very busy and full of children running everywhere. But in fairness it was mid term. Unfortunately our room was connected to another and as a result we were kept awake all night by the drunks next door. The manager kindly upgraded us on our next stay should we choose to come again.
So we did. We stayed sunday night making sure it wasn't mid term! Our twin room upgrade was lovely. The little touches and the view were great I loved the room. However there were further issues on this stay... the steam rooms and plunge pool were under construction. This was so disappointing. I would have thought it courteous to have been told beforehand. Anywhere I have stayed where this has happened or where some part is unavailable I have always been told before arrival. We would   have changed dates - it's just part of our holiday that we enjoy very much. As a result the Jacuzzi was crammed... which included kids hanging their legs over the edge and their mother roaring at them. There were also a number of children jumping into the pool doing ""bombs"" so swimming was unpleasant and loud! Kids will be kids my issue is there was no one supervising the pool during the time we were there so it was a free for all. I think we were there around 7pm sunday night. We left unimpressed and didn't return the next morning. We then went for dinner in the bar. We had chicken wings to start they  were lovely. I had prawn pasta and my sister had butter chicken curry. Both mediocre at best for very simple dishes. The staff were lovely. Notably, the floor really was quite dirty and needed a sweep. We changed table to the other side of the room and that was equally dirty. I understand it's busy but a quick sweep was necessary. We went for a lovely walk around the grounds and also to the beach. It was nice to get away from the screaming kids outside the window. Breakfast was delicious with a great selection. Again, crying babies and toddlers. Not great before coffee lol. We were probably there a good 20 minutes without said coffee. I had to chase down a waitress and ask her for it. There didn't seem to be anyone responsible for our section and it wasn't that busy. Not great service unlike the rest of the hotel staff. I think we checked out around 10am we had had enough by then and were glad to get back on the road. 

So, this in my view is not comparable to any other 5* I have stayed in before but I think the cheaper prices reflect that in fairness. The location is great and the staff are so nice and generally customer orientated. I would describe this hotel as a young family hotel which in my view is to the exclusion of all others. More has to be done to balance the needs of ALL guests. I would not stay a third time which is disappointing.  ",3,2017,05,11
238,Beautiful Golf Course,This property is absolutely beautiful and peaceful!  It is located just South of Dublin in Newtown Mount Kennedy.  My group stayed for two nights.  Very comfortable and near Wicklow Mountains National Park and a short drive to Glendalough which is located in a valley in County Wicklow.  It was founded in the 6th Century by St. Kevin.,5,2017,05,10
238,Brilliant stay,Great place to stay! Even if you don't play golf it is a close drive to attractions of Glendalough and Powerscourt. Couldn't fault the hotel at all - staff were brilliant. Great for a relaxing stay and retreat.,5,2017,05,08
238,Never disappoints!,"Glad to get back to one of our favourites after choosing somewhere different last time for family break, which didn't come close. Very friendly welcome by Teague on arrival as always, such a lovely man and then received an upgrade to suite from Adrienne -thankyou!. These guys just ooze service and could teach the young ones at breakfast a thing or two. We love this part of Ireland as so much to do and can't wait to return.",5,2017,05,08
238,Fabulous or Frustrating?,"I stayed at druids glen with my new wife as part of our mini moon from 29th April to 2nd may.  we stayed in room 303 which was nice and had a lovely view over the golf course.   The hotel grounds are lovely, the food was consistently excellent but the service was more often than not frustratingly substandard.  For example, on the first night we chose to eat at Hugo's restaurant. I had looked at the menus online and thought that the early bird menu looked tastier to my palette.  Upon arrival I had to ask for the menu and only when I said it was currently on the hotel website I was presented with it. I noticed that other diners who arrived at the same time did not get both menus.  On day 2 I fell ill with man flu.  I did not leave the room for the whole day, my wife phoned to reception to ask for 2 bottles of water for me.  45 mins later no water.  I myself phoned reception, no answer.  I thought that it was too bad that someone I'll couldn't get a bottle of water. My wife ate in the 13th bar and she had to ask for menus after being seated for 20mins.  Day 3 after feeling better we decided to have lunch at the 13th.  The food menu I received had full plates of hot meals and really all I wanted was a sandwich as I was not 100% from the previous day. I had asked a blonde haired lady at the front of restaurant whether this was the only menu or could I order a sandwich as it was lunchtime.  She said 'I'm not sure whether we serve sandwiches'. Understandably frustrated we had to drive to the golf club where I did get a delicious sandwich! So in summary the food was fantastic, room and grounds great but the service at both restaurants was far far away from what I would have expected from a reputable resort such as druids glen.",3,2017,05,02
238,Easter Break with the children,"Beautiful Hotel, excellent friendly staff, great entertainment for children with afternoon activities, playroom and bicycles available with a kids club in the evening for 3 hours allowing ample time for a wonderful meal in the restaurant ..",5,2017,05,01
238,Wish I could have stayed longer,"The room was light, bright and spacious. The staff were professional but very friendly.  Everything was spotless. The restaurant staff were very attentive and the food was great. There was a large, noisy group at the table behind us but on request we were moved to a peaceful area. At the end of the meal I was given a small box of handmade chocolates, by way of an apology. Nice gesture",5,2017,05,01
238,FAB FACILITIES,"WOW what a lovely place to stay,actually never stayed here but played golf and my wife had a spa day,the golf course is outstanding and my wif said the spa facilities were excellent so well worth the stay.",5,2017,04,30
238,Luxury Escape,"Was really looking forward to staying here and was not disappointed. The staff are the most exceptional part of the hotel. They are so friendly, professional and accommodating. Anticipating your needs before you. The hotel itself is lovely, the rooms are large and the beds are soft. We ate at the bar and at the restaurant. Would highly recommend Hugo's restaurant it is a bit more expensive but it is good value for money as the food was excellent. The pool is small and the steam room was under construction. Would not recommend swimming in the evening as there are often swimming classes at this time. There are many attractions nearby ie Glendalough or the Wicklow mountains. Would love to come back.",5,2017,04,27
238,One night treat with the family,"We arrived at the hotel on a Thursday afternoon to be greeted with hot towels at reception a nice surprise!  We took the kids to the bool and were stung for swimming hats at 4 euro a pop!  The pool was very very busy but was probably as everyone had the same idea.  We decided to eat in the bar rather than Hugos as the kids were a little tired.  
The meal started with beautiful chicken wings (which I would highly recommend)  then went down hill from there, I ate my dinner alone as did my wife, my steak had been overcooked and by the time it was changed my wife had finished her dinner.  My wife had gone for Kilmore Quay Crab & Home Cured Salmon, unfortunately sh found at least 2 lumps of crab shell in the meal, I didn't want to complain again so she just picked it out and ate on.
I would have felt a little less annoyed if there had of been some level of reimbursement, we received an apology from what looked like the bar food manager and were told that it was important to get feedback as sometimes she thinks the chefs don't know what they are doing in the kitchen.........!

The door man was amazing with the kids very friendly and we took the boys to the driving range and the kids activity room

Beds were comfortable and over all my impression was that the hotel was a good 4*, service slow, food (apart from the wings!) distinctly average in the bar.

Would I be back..........debatable at this stage",4,2017,04,24
238,Visit for a Business Event,"Came here to a walk around with my wife as she needs to organize a business event. We have been well welcomed by the person in charge who got to know we were coming only few hours before.
The location and the property are stunning, not surprised this is a Travellers' Choice. They have different areas where you can plan your event, some of these areas are better to be reached by complimentary transfer (even if you can walk on a sunny day).
Property has been refurbished in 2015 which gives you a kind of fresh air even inside the walls.
5/5 as the feeling I have is that you cannot be wrong with this location, just make sure the layout of the property suits with the needs of your business event.",5,2017,04,22
238,Easter offer,"My family and I are just home from a two night stay at the Druids Glen Hotel and to say it exceeded expectations is an understatement. It is such a family friendly hotel and the staff are so welcoming, friendly and helpful. 

Our offer included a meal in Hugo's restaurant in the hotel and it was a fine dining experience. We both had the duck for starters, it was beautifully presented and tasted delicious. Sea Bass main for me and stake for my husband both full of flavour. Dessert didn't disappoint either. 

There is also a bar area, which we ate in the second night, it has a more everyday menu on offer and a more relaxed feel. 

While we were enjoying our meal the first night, the hotel provides a high tea for the kids, which is buffet dinner with other kids in the hotel. This includes supervised play with fun and games for the children from 6-9.30pm. This was also included in our offer but you can book and pay €10 per child otherwise. It is very safe and secure and felt more than happy leaving the children to have fun. 

There is also a playroom on the first floor where you can supervise your own children and includes fooze ball table, air hockey, X box, old arcade game machine and there's always a movie playing along with lots more. 

There is a gym and swimming pool at the hotel and health spa. You can also hire bikes and cycle round the beautiful grounds. There is of course the golf and a driving range with small putting area, plus a outdoor playground beside the hotel. 

A 2k walk around the grounds takes you round to the beautiful Woodstock house build in the 1700, which is now the golf club house.  You can look around inside and see the amazing view from the upstairs balcony. There is also a cafe/restaurant to have a bite to eat but be warned there is no shortcuts back to the hotel and you have to walk back the way you came or call the shuttle bus to come and lift you. 

Overall we had a really delightful stay and would highly recommend staying here if your in the area you won't be disappointed. ",5,2017,04,22
238,Easter Package with young Kids,"So we booked an easter package for 2 nights including breakfast and dinner on one evening it also included access to the kids club for my 6 year old. The package is not cheap so we where expecting a 5 star experience. After much thinking about this I have to stay I would not view this resort as 5 star. The food is very very good and the staff are so friendly. We got a family room on the 2nd floor and I must say it wasn't great at all, its tired looking and the furniture is old and marked with all kinds of stains. As part of our package 2 double beds where included but we got 2 small doubles ( I didn't know such a thing existed until the manager informed me). I also got a robe with a large brown stain on the front right under the crest.

We ordered room service on the first night as we tried to get our 1 year old to sleep before our 6 year old returned from the kids club. The order was 1 hour 10 minutes coming and came cold with 3 onion rings 1 of which was burned batter with no onion. Saying this we called down straight away and the manager took care of the issue when we left. 

The next day the toilet roll holder fell off the wall, the doors of the lighted wardrobe would not shut so the light would not go off and the wooden helm of the wardrobe fell down. To be honest my wife was so disappointed with the room the first thing she said to me was ""this is not a 5 star experience""  I had to agree.

I spoke to the manager who was understanding and took care of us with lunch and moved us to a suite for the second night. The suite was really nice but now that we had time to think about it we would probably expect the standard of the suite to be the standard of a normal 5 star family room. I have stayed in nicer suites in 5 star hotels around the world. 

My son loved the kids club and didn't want to leave, a healthier choice of food would be welcome for the kids club.

So overall we had an ok time in a resort I would rate as 4 star,  you go away for an experience and I wasn't expecting that I would have to leave my room to move to a cleaner suite with a bigger bed and toilet roll holder that wasn't falling off the wall. 

Myself and my wife where really looking forward to this break with the kids and spent an above average rate because of the status of the hotel. I have to say we come away from the experience a little deflated. We feel we lost out on a whole day of what was already a short 2 day stay.

But I have to mention the staff they are professional helpful and nothing is an issue. The food for the rest of the stay was wonderful too.

We would love to return here someday but there is alot of work to do on the resorts behalf to warrant a 5 star price rate.",3,2017,04,21
238,Great Stay,"Just back from fourth visit, i have to say it's the staff that really make this place.  They are so friendly and can't do enough for you.   The hotel itself is lovely, although i would say it's more 4 star than 5 as there are a few details that disappoint (e.g. one steam room being out of order for whole week we were there and I know this has been mentioned on a past review, some of sofas in bar looking tired and bit grubby in daylight).   The staff however, are more than 5 star!  The area itself is great and the grounds are beautiful.  Food in bar is limited but that's probably because we've really worked our way through it!   Try the afternoon tea it's amazing, also the cream tea is excellent value.     Now planning the next trip.",4,2017,04,18
238,5 star experirnce,I must admit that when I walked into the bar upon arriving ( we were early and our room was not ready)I was disappointed with the overall atmosphere and decor of the bar but this was the only negative from my whole visit. The staff are amazing - it's the main reason why I will return. Nothing was a problem and they were friendly and courteous and went the extra mile for every interaction. They need a few more healthy options in their bar menu but other than that the food really was a great standard. Go stay there- you will not be disappointed!,5,2017,04,16
238,Great for families with younger children. Food very good. ,"We stayed here at Easter. Very popular with families with younger kids as there is a pool and staff and facilities cater to children. The food in the main restaurant Hugo's is top notch although the service, while friendly, is less than 5 star. The bar is disappointing - very plain with shiny brown tables and chairs and very little space for relaxing in a quieter atmosphere. There are limited sofas and more comfortable chairs in the lobby but drinks service is sporadic and generally you need to go to the bar to get a drink. The hotel is missing out on revenue here especially at busy check in times between 2 - 4pm. 
Overall we had a nice stay here and the surrounding area is beautiful but would rate this as a 4 star rather than 5 star hotel. ",3,2017,04,16
238,Never fails to impress!!,"We have had many visits to Druids Glen, the most recent being a three night stay for a family wedding. Everything was perfect from the moment of arrival the night before the wedding. We were greeted by Ollie, a perfect gentleman, who tirelessly helped us offload all the paraphernalia. All members of staff we encountered were friendly, helpful and efficient.
The accommodation is luxurious, especially the suites which have beautiful sitting rooms with gas fires and breathtaking views. The complimentary L'Occitane toiletries, fluffy bathrobes and slippers, as well as the nightly turn down with chocolates on pillows, all added to the luxurious feel of the hotel. We ate in the bar as well as Hugo's restaurant,  both of which served excellent food. We also managed to find time to fit in a spa treatment. I would heartily recommend the aroma stone therapy massage followed by time to unwind in the softly lit treatment room. Some party members found time for a round of golf on the challenging Heath course. The same hospitality which was evident in the hotel was reflected in the club house.  The hotel offers guests the very best in luxurious accommodation, pampering, dining and leisure facilities.
Druids Glen is the ideal venue for those looking for their fairytale wedding. After a civil ceremony which was held in a tastefully decorated room, champagne and canapés were served in another reception area and  a sweet trolley and ice-cream cart were also provided as  part of the wedding package. Both of which went down a treat with adults and children alike!
An amazing wedding dinner was prepared by award winning chefs and served in the James Joyce ballroom by an extremely efficient, professional team of waiting staff.  The whole day was perfect, due in no small part to the hard work and dedication of Nessa, the wedding co-ordinator, who ensured everything went like clockwork throughout the day and evening.
The stunning grounds and luxurious interior provide a perfect backdrop for the photographs. Definitely the ideal venue for a wedding!",5,2017,04,16
238,Another magnificent stay at this beautiful oasis!,"Just back after three amazing nights in the wonderful Druids Glen hotel and golf resort. It was a birthday surprise from my husband. We just can't get enough of this little gem, you could say we have definitely fallen under the spell of Druids Glen.  It has everything you could ever want  in a hotel.  If you like walking or cycling there is the most beautiful pathways winding through the resort and two spectacular golf courses with the most amazing views.  For relaxing, the resort also has a fantastic spa swimming pool gym and sauna, I make sure to visit the spa every time we stay here and I would highly recommend the coconut wrap or the Druids Glen signature is a real treat. I have to mention the girls in the treatment rooms - whether it's your first time or a return visit you are treated like royalty and each visit is a special one. As for the staff, well from the moment you arrive you are greeted with such warmth by Tadhg and the reception staff. From then on  the whole experience is unforgettable - we cannot say enough about the staff including housekeeping, food and beverage etc.  Each and everyone of them made our stay a memorable one but we have to give a special mention to Patrick Kickham-Lennon, director of food and beverage.  If it was possible for the hotel to have a six star rating Patrick would complete the six stars! Not only his wonderful charm and bubbly personality make him very approachable but also his attention to detail and professional way in which he deals with any situation creates the smooth running and calming atmosphere in all areas of the hotel and this is evident in each of his staff.  Special thanks to Patrick and Kate in Hugo's restaurant for surprising me with a special dessert for my birthday (not to forget our very attentive waiter Olewyn who brought it to the table along with his chorus of happy birthday!). Also we feel Irina in the bar deserves a special mention she has a unique way of making sure you are attended to at all times without any disturbance.  This is one hotel that once you go through the doors you don't want to leave.  As you can see we are big fans of this hotel so much so we have just booked four nights in May to go back to celebrate our silver wedding anniversary! Can't wait!!! Kind regards Pat &Anita Kenny",5,2017,04,16
238,Easter break at Druids Glen,"I would highly recommend Druids Glen resort for a family break. It certainly deserves each of its 5 stars!
We spent 3 nights there last week with our 2 year old son. It has amazing facilities and space for young children and yet manages to feel luxurious and relaxing too. 
The staff were always friendly and helpful, in particular the breakfast staff and those in Hugo's restaurant.

We ate in the bar on two evenings. The menu is varied and will cover most people's tastes. The food we got was of a really high standard, arrived very quickly and was very fresh.
We ate in Hugo's restaurant on one evening and loved the setting. The food was presented excellently and was very tasty. 
Breakfast was fantastic. We particularly loved the fresh omelettes and pancakes cooked to order in front of you. The chef on that station was very friendly and went out of his way to please guests.
The rooms are large and very well maintained and the L'Occataine toiletries were an added bonus.
The swimming pool is very clean and warm and the staff were lovely. We were a bit disappointed that there wasn't a children's pool as our little boy loves to be independent in the water, but he enjoyed the 'big' pool anyway.
The playroom is the best equipped and cleanest that I've seen. They are usually quite grubby and ill equipped but this one is pretty amazing! 
There is a large playground adjacent to the hotel and a little fairy trail!
My husband enjoyed the golf driving range and his game of golf immensely and I was very impressed with my treatment at the spa.

In summary, you will find it very difficult to fault anything about your stay at Druids Glen. It's one of the best hotels that we've stayed in and we'll definitely be back!",5,2017,04,15
238,Amazing stay for family wedding ,We have just returned from a wonderful stay in Druids Glen! We have stayed in many hotels in Ireland with our family but I think this is definitely one of the best! The food is fabulous as is the service! Our children loved the kids club and it gave us a few hours of quiet time in the evenings!! One small criticism was that the beds were v small just a standard double which is a bit of a shame however it won't deter us and we will most certainly return in the near future!!,5,2017,04,12
238,Never disappoints! Fabulous!,"My husband and I have stayed at the Druids Glen on numerous occasions over the last few years, it never disappoints. We usually opt for a deluxe king room which is fabulously decorated with a lovely bathroom. This time we opted for a two night spring break which was reasonably priced which included early check in and late check out, which is brilliant for us who like to relax when away, and a bottle of prosecco and chocolates. We ate in the restaurant on the first morning and opted for breakfast in bed on the second, both were excellent. We ate in the bar both evenings, which is excellent too and great value. We have eaten in the dining room on several occasions it can be expensive even with a discount voucher, but the food is really sumptuous and represents fine dining. The hotel has two golf courses which are superb for the golfing enthusiasts and pros. There is a great walkway on the course boundary for the walkers and a lovely little play are for the children. The only let down is the pool area. It's more practical than special. It's clean and well run and staff are always helpful and friendly but the sauna and steam room area is in need of an overhaul to bring it to another level. Also the staff on reception are lovely as are the cleaning staff, and I must give the doormen a mention, both are always so welcoming. Well done Druids Glen, we'll definitely be back and probably very soon.",5,2017,04,12
238,Spring golfing trip,"Just returned from our third trip to Druids glen hotel and golf resort.
We were a party 24 male golfers including two professionals we played both courses both were in tip top condition, scenery is out of this world   staff were friendly and welcoming on both courses, Hotel was very comfortable and relaxing food good staff very friendly and polite. Looking forward to returning again next year.",5,2017,04,11
238,Our favourite place,"We come back to this hotel almost every year to celebrate special events with my husband. Absolutely in love with this place. The rooms are spacious, staff members are very helpful, the food is gorgeous. Usually we go for a long walk, book a SPA treatment or have a drink beside the fireplace. 
Can definitely recommend this beautiful hotel and we will come back ;-)",5,2017,04,11
238,Druidic Dreams,"A well appointed 5 star golf resort and Spa 40 mins from Dublin. Beautiful rooms with the most comfortable beds you can imagine. Plenty of free parking. Numerous walks in the adjoining parkland and excellent golfing for the afflicted. 
Excellent food in the bar or restaurants. If I was to list a negative it would be that the location is somewhat remote, a car is a necessity, although this can be a positive for some. ",4,2017,04,11
238,Relaxed luxury,"This is a beautiful hotel, in glorious surroundings run by a friendly & professional staff. 
Our room was 317 - reasonable size room with a lovely view over a wooded section of the golf course.  Everything was comfortable, clean and well maintained with good facilities.  We ate in all of the 3 options on site: The hotel bar has a good, simple menu and very quick service.  The club house portions are huge.  The restaurant is a lovely relaxed atmosphere and again, generally excellent quality.  Breakfast is extensive including gluten free options and a chef to cook eggs & pancakes to order perfectly.  The spa is like a cosy cocoon. I had the same excellent therapist for 4 treatments (Aoife?) which made me very comfortable.  She's an excellent masseuse. Leisure facilities are good. The pool is 17m with a dedicated lengths lane although most of the pool is available for families who are made feel at home throughout the hotel. The grounds are stunning.  We were lucky to have pleasant weather for most of our visit which made walking at the edge of the golf course a joy.  We were also lucky enough to have a golf lesson with Patrick Geraghty while we were there.  He improved my swing and more importantly my confidence within about 5 mins.  I couldn't recommend him highly enough.  I left Druids Glen feeling about 6 inches taller and thoroughly relaxed.",5,2017,04,08
238,A Country Retreat,"So enjoyed my experience at the Druids Glen Hotel. Spent 4 days here at a global business meeting. The staff were friendly and helpful, the room extremely comfortable and the outdoor environment peaceful, pretty and typically Irish.",5,2017,04,08
238,A Relaxing & Enjoyable Experience ,"Recently stayed at Druids Glen Hotel and Resort for one night and wish it had off been for longer. The hotels location and facilities are perfect for a relaxing getaway. The staff encountered were all extremely friendly and attentive. Whilst dining and having drinks in the bar area we were looked after extremely well by Min the hostess. 
We stayed in a superior room on the second floor which was perfect with one disadvantage being the bed, It felt like I was sinking into the mattress which was quite uncomfortable.  
On our day of departure we enjoyed using the hotels leisure facilities and undertaking the 4km walking trail surrounding the golf course.  Thank you for an overall enjoyable stay, we will be back! 

The bottled water at check out is a lovely gesture. ",5,2017,04,06
238,Spa Day,"My two friends and I had a really enjoyable day in Druids Glen last Thursday.  I would highly recommend my therapist Sinead.  She was truely professional and a brillant therapist.  I had the most relaxing body massage, brushing and facial and she gave me such good advice afterwards. The only thing that could be improved on was there wasnt a big choice on the set lunch menu.   There was a lovely atmosphere around the hotel.  Both my colleagues had a similar experience.  We will be back and will stay overnight the next time pg.",5,2017,04,03
238,delicious food and excellent service,"I went there for lunch with my friends and we were delighted at the quality and taste of the food as well as at the service which was simply excellent; all the waiters were very friendly and nice. The place itself is impressive, too.",4,2017,04,03
238,Great family hotel - great staff,"Hi  we stayed one night in hotel recently with my husband & two young boys.  We were welcomed by Adrienne on reception who informed us of all the activities we could do which were all free.  We went on a family cycle, the driving range, done the walking trail and swimming both days.  Adrienne was so nice and friendly to my children and they have now said that Druids Glen is their favourite hotel.  The breakfast is fab and food in the bar is really nice.  I have stayed her with my husband on our own and now with the children and would highly recommend both a family or couple break.
Thank you Druids Glen & Adrienne for a great break.",5,2017,04,03
238,Amazing experience ,"I stayed here last Friday night with my mum, aunt & cousin.
From start to finish we had a wonderful time. We had lunch in the bar which was nice but the menu was being changed and some dishes were not available but we weren't informed of this until we went to order which was disappointing. The food was very nice though & service was excellent. 
We had incredible treatments in the Spa & the relaxation room was fabulous. My therapist Katie was so friendly & gave great advice about my skincare regime & recommending suitable products.
Later we had dinner in The restaurant which was beautiful. The ham hock and cod were gorgeous.
Great atmosphere in the bar afterwards & off to one of the most comfortable beds ever! Great day & night & I would highly recommend it!",5,2017,03,30
238,Very fancy!,"We stayed at the Druids the last two nights of our vacation.  We booked through Groupon and this was part of the package.  We could totally see why the travel company chose the Druids as it is such a relaxing and calming atmosphere.  The breakfast was really good as well as the restaurant.  The staff was super friendly and helpful.  Our flight was cancelled due to the storm in the NE of the USA, the staff was very helpful to connect me with the airline to reschedule.",5,2017,03,30
238,Exceptional ,We stayed at Druids Glen last night before flying back to JFK today.  It is flat out exceptional and very luxurious.  The staff was amazing and friendly.  We did not even play golf because of the duration but will add it to the must play courses in the future.  Treat yourself and go to this one. ,5,2017,03,29
238,Afternoon tea,Thank you Leticia and Min for helping to make our visit so pleasant. We wanted afternoon tea with style and were not at all disappointed. Tea was delicious as were the sandwiches and pastries. My close friend Gladys and me had a lovely relaxing unrushed afternoon in the Druids Glen and look forward to our next day out in County Wicklow. Beautiful views and friendly helpful staff.,4,2017,03,27
238,Treat from the family ,Spent 2 lovely days in the hotel. Every member of staff was very friendly and helpful with the ease of a truly 5* resort. The hotel is better than the web site presents. Standard room was large and very well furnished with excellent housekeeping and turn down service. Breakfast was great with high quality dishes with wide choice available. Dinner at Hugo's restaurant was fab with high quality service in a friendly unobtrusive manner. Swimming pool was busy on both days. Spa treatment was class leaving you stress free. What a treat. Definitely go again. ,5,2017,03,26
238,Patrick!,"We had a great stay! Staff where very helpful, room spotless and constantly cleaned! But Patrick the Restaurant manager made our stay! He was so helpful and put you at ease, BEST HOTEL MANAGER EVER!!!! Give us directions for a shop in a town which were perfect! Over all the food was great, Spa was fab! and the health suite was everything a fitness freak would need.",5,2017,03,26
238,Excellent ,"We stayed in the Druids Glen hotel on Wednesday night,  had a wonderful stay. We ate in Hugos restaurant,  we had one of the most fabulous meals and the staff were very helpful and friendly, service was excellent I couldn't recommended this hotel enough.  Can't wait to go back,  hopefully soon.  ",5,2017,03,24
238,Relaxing & Enjoyable stay,"I am one of six sisters and chose Druids Glen for our family weekend this year.  We shared two large rooms which were spotless, bright and we had plenty of space.  The meal in the dining room was exceptional and and staff couldn't have been more helpful or accommodating.  The hotel is only 30 minutes from Dublin and in a beautiful setting with lovely walks.  A really lovely weekend. Pauline Maher",5,2017,03,24
238,Fantastic hotel and overall experience,"I stayed here for one night with my girlfriend and we had a fantastic experience. 

From the moment we arrived the excellent service began. I parked the car at the set down area where we were greeted by a friendly valet attendant who offered to park our car and take care our bags. 

We entered the reception are and were greeted by very friendly staff who offered hot, moist towels to freshen up.  Check in was a pleasant and speedy experience. 

We opened the door into a beautiful, clean, spacious room.  There was a bottle of prosecco waiting on ice for us.

The beds were firm but comfortable, and the arm chairs in the sitting area were comfortable too.

The bathroom was large and clean with a separate bath and shower.  The shower was nice with good pressure and plenty of hot water. 

We spent some time in the pool area which was nice. There was a sauna, steam room, an ice cold plunge pool and a Jacuzzi. We didn't have access to the relaxation area as we did not book in for any treatments.

The food was very nice, we availed of room service for both dinner and breakfast and were not left disappointed.

Over all we had a fantastic experience and have no complaints at all.",5,2017,03,24
238,Terrible stay- Avoid!!!,"We had a terrible stay with druids glen last Saturday. We were given a family room (a door connecting to the next room) so we could hear everything that was going on in the next room so we asked to be moved, We then got moved to another room and it was horrendous. The room had not been hoovered, there was a dirty nappy on the balcony outside, the sink kept clogging up, the iron was dirty and the ironing board was broken. These are things that should not happen in a five star hotel. We did not have time to move rooms again as we were attending a wedding so I emailed them the next day when we checked out. The next day I received a phone call from Jeanette the accommodation manager to say that they were very sorry and would like to offer a room at a discounted rate. I have sent two emails to Jeanette since and she has not replied so they obviously are just fobbing me off! We should have received another nights stay for free or something to compensate our terrible stay. I would not be paying more money to have another terrible stay that's for sure. Definitely not a 5 star hotel when it comes to customer service or there rooms!!",1,2017,03,23
238,Not with visiting for the spa facilities.,"Beautiful setting and a lovely estate with a pleasant, airy lobby and high class feel. Unfortunately we had booked with the prime aim of using the standard spa facilities which were a huge disappointment. Only one of two steam rooms was working and really, it should've been marked as out of order too. It was just a lukewarm, sweaty dark cubby hole. The sauna wasn't much better, vaguely warm and full of water on the floor. Perhaps the facilities weren't up to full whack because it was a Sunday into a Monday, but still not really good enough. The room itself was lovely, great size and a beautiful bathroom too. Probably great for a golfing stay, but if you want a nice spa hotel, go elsewhere.",3,2017,03,21
238,Relaxing and beautiful stay,"We went to Druids Glen hoping to relax and unwind and the hotel did not disappoint! We were greeting with helpful and friendly staff who were nice enough to let us check in early and gave us a great run through of everything the hotel had to offer. The room was beautiful and clean, with everything we needed and even a bottle of prosecco waiting for us on arrival. There were great little touches to make our stay comfortable including l'occotaine bathroom supplies which really impressed me as a lover of these products! 
The grounds are beautiful and there are lovely walking trails which bring you through the woods and along the golf course. 
Truly relaxing night away and we would highly recommend! 10/10 for what we needed ",5,2017,03,20
238,Wow,"From start to finish it's fantastic. Staff or lovely and helpful. Rooms was beautiful and bright. Plenty of space. Bathrooms spotless. Everything was just great. 

Dinner was fantastic in Hugo's. Oh wow. Steak is to die for. Staff again were great.

Breakfast I think was my favourite. So much choice. Honey from the hive on display and was mouth watering. All fresh fruits, cereals, juices etc. 

I literally can not fault this place. More time here was needed. We will be back. ",5,2017,03,20
238,Lovely Staff and Lovely Room,"Room was lovely, perfectly clean and amazing beds. There temp control in the room as well is brilliant. 
Spa was lovely, pool and sauna were really nice.

We were there on a weekend so there were a lot of kids so was quite noisy which wasn't ideal at 8am on a Sunday morning, but not sure the staff can prevent this - more of a parenting issue. 

Staff were lovely and so nice and well informed. Would stay again but would request a quiet room. 
Definitely would recommend. It was raining and miserable wen we were there but the grounds looked fabulous.",4,2017,03,20
238,St Patrick's day break ,"Have just returned from a two night stay in druids glen ober st Patrick's day☘ and I highly  recommend this hotel!
 Staff were fabulous from checking in to the doorman wishing us a safe journey home on the way out and every single me ever of staff we met in between. The hotel itself is beautiful but it is the staff which really make it special.
We had a lovely walk along the trail  after a sumptuous breakfast, probably one of the best selections I have ever seen!
 Highly recommended, I shall definitely be back.",5,2017,03,18
238,Wonderful stay- upgraded to a suite ,"Thanks for a wonderful stay and very kindly upgrading us to the most amazing suite I ever stayed in!
The log fire in the middle of the suite was magical. 
We had a really amazing experience here. Beautiful hotel and grounds.",5,2017,03,18
238,Beautiful stay,"Stayed for a one night stay last weekend as a couple to have a break from the kids. Although on arrival the hotel was really busy with kids . They were also in the bar up to quite late while parents sat around drinking! Wasn't ideal.
Ate in the bar and the food was beautiful and well presented. Prices OK for the quality.
We were upgraded as it was our anniversary and the room was really nice with a view of the golf course. Nice l'occitane toiletries but the shower was a let down. 
Really comfy beds and pillows. Was woken by a lot of noise on the corridor around 3am with a crowd having a sing song but that's a minor thing.
Breakfast was lovely with something for everyone , fresh cooked pancakes and omelette,  lots of gluten free things too, smoked salmon, yogurts etc etc. 
Used the pool on Saturday while hubby had a treatment in the spa. Nice pool but packed with all the kids. A family of about 10 took over the jacuzzi and stayed in it for over an hour taking it in turns to get out and press the on button. Steamroomwasn't working that day either. 
Overall a nice hotel with minor let downs, lovely walk through the golf course,  will hopefully return and maybe even bring the kids!",5,2017,03,17
238,Lovely relaxing stay,"Stayed from Friday 10th March to Sunday 12th March with husband and 2 children aged 7 and 9. Lovely spacious rooms. Staff most friendly, helpful and welcoming. Didn't eat in the hotel apart from breakfast which were superb. Will definitely be back for a longer stay. ",5,2017,03,16
238,Outstanding Weekend at Druids Glen,"Excellent Food in a beautiful restaurant served by splendid staff.
The rooms were superb and the view breath taking.
Brilliant facilities including swimming pool and gym.
I will be back there in the near future. As hotels go, it was a real 10 out of 10.
To all the staff at Druids Glen thank you for making my stay enjoyable.",5,2017,03,16
238,Druids Glen Doesn't Disappoint.,Having previously visited this hotel for Sunday lunch I decided to book my extended family (fourteen of us) for an overnight stay for a special family celebration on Saturday 11/3/17. What a lovely time we had. The staff were just wonderful.They are so friendly and welcoming. They just have the knack of making everything relaxed yet professional. We had children in our party and they just loved it. I will definitely return. Well done Druids Glen.,5,2017,03,13
238,Nice resort hotel outside of city center ,"Meeting rooms were plentiful.  Everything worked in the rooms.  It is far from the nearest shops and no soda machine / gift shop.  I thought the views of the golf course were nice.  Sheep roaming the country side around you.  

Nice playground for children.  Tried walking trail, just realize it is basically a dead end so plan to walk back the way you came. ",5,2017,03,11
238,Good resort type of hotel,"This is a good hotel. From a scoring point of view I would say it is a 4.6. I am not saying it is a 4 - on the other hand it is on the fence - fitness is OK - breakfast and dinner also fine - hot water, good bed. So overall a good reliable experience",5,2017,03,10
238,Very affordable 5 star experience,Amazing service. Very friendly staff and flexible. Catered well to different requests  throughout our stay. Book dinner/spa before hand as can get quite busy. They have the best bathroom supplies! The whole building smells so nice too!,5,2017,03,10
238,Outstanding service ,"A group of us visited the hotel on Friday 03 March for Lunch and Spa treatments, 14 ladies in total. From the moment we arrived we were made feel special. Fabulous lunch served by very friendly and attentive staff.  Michelle and her team in the Spa were fantastic. Everyone of the therapists were so welcoming and professional. The overall feedback from the group is 100% satisfaction with the visit. A big thank you to Michelle and her team and all the staff in the hotel for a wonderful afternoon. ",5,2017,03,06
238,Birthday Celebration Dinner,"I had the responsibility of arranging a special birthday celebration for my older brother and chose the Druid's Glen for dinner and one night stay over. From my first encounter with the staff of the hotel in arranging the event I was highly impressed by the friendliness, professionalism and just willingness to help make this a success. Joanna, Naomi and Kate were all great in this regard. On the night we had dinner in Hugo's Restaurant, the food was great and again the staff couldn't have been nicer and more helpful .Whether it was meeting special requirements or dealing with other issues, they were terrific. Rooms in the hotel are very spacious and many in our party took advantage of the gym, swimming pool and spa facilities. All the feedback I received was good. Overall, a great night in a great hotel.",5,2017,03,06
238,5 star relaxed,"Stayed here over a wkend & found the hotel to be lovely & very welcoming. We had dinner in Hugo restaurant on the first nite which we found to be first class. 
Our room was a twin bed which were lovely big & airy with a lovely view of the Wicklow mountains. 
On your second nite we eat in the bar & had a butter chicken curry which was lovely & fish & chips . We will be back again ",5,2017,03,06
238,Definitely not a 5 star. ,"Disappointed overall, Very small area with Sauna/Steamroom could not be described as thermal suite!! Food in Hugos was ok, Staff were very nice but not 5 star hotel. Also the amount of small children made it feel like a Holiday Inn experience. ",3,2017,02,25
238,Outstanding afternoon tea!,"Me and mother had a wonderful afternoon tea in Druids glen, everything we ate was of a great standard and was very Delicious! Amazing food and the service was also very good, Our waiter was attentive and very friendly. Highly recommend the afternoon tea, make sure to make a booking in advance though!",5,2017,02,25
238,Golfers Place,"Had a lovely relaxing time in Druids Glen hotel. The bedroom was large with a comfortable bed and spacious bathroom with separate bath and shower. Toiletries were L'Occitane. Liked the storage, tea making facility and fridge. Plenty of sockets and free wifi was good. Surprised housekeeping did not stock neck pillows. Breakfast was a buffet and the chef makes omelette or pancakes to order. The 400 acre resort is a journey through windy countryroads off the N11 at Kilcoole in Wicklow. There are serviced apartment blocks near the entrance with the hotel behind, a four sided building with a central courtyard. Room 320 faced into the courtyard-best to ask for room with external views over the landscape. There are two golf courses and as a non golfer I found little to do even with pool and spa. The vaulted ceiling of the foyer fireplace seating didn't seem cosy. Same with the scattered seating near the curved staircase on the other two levels. The staff were relaxed and busy. Enjoyable stay as an 'away from it all' break but not five star. One night was enough. Give the touristy Johnny Foxes pub a miss. ",4,2017,02,24
238,Overall great stay ,"Stayed here for just one night with my sister on Sunday. It was overall a great experience. The grounds are lovely. Room decor is fab. Had some drinks in the bar when we arrived and had to wait for 20 mins to be served, but the cocktails were delicious. Dinner in Hugo's was nice. Service was very good. We went for the early bird menu which you have to ask for, it's  not automatically giving to you. Breakfast was very tasty, but trying to flag someone down for a coffee was a mission. Ended up having to get up and find someone. Had a small issue with noise from our adjoining room but the manager at the front desk handled it very well so it wouldn't put me off going again. There are areas of the hotel that could do with an extra dust and it would make a huge difference. We had a lovely time and it's only a short distance from Dublin. We will be back. ",4,2017,02,21
238,"Fantastic weekend Top Notch Hotel, Friendly Happy Staff -Highly Recommended","Top class hotel, large clean rooms which are fully equipped for any form of stay, a break, a week with family or a romantic venue - if i was getting married it would be top of my list the gardens are magical. Had a fantastic stay recently in this fabulous hotel, from the time myself and my friend arrived we were treated

Doorman - a gentleman

Check In - Handed warm towels to warm up and shown to our room. Top class.

Spa: Ohhhhhhhhh you just have to try the spa its only fantastic. we decided to try the bar food in the main hotel rather than the spa 

Bar Food: Lunch in the bar in the main hotel extensive menu with great value and the young man who served us Kyle was a pleasure and such a happy and helpful staff member. He seemed to never stop but that did not faze him a gentleman and a gem.

Restaurant: Dinner in Hugo's on our first night and have to say the food was 5 star. The staff were not as friendly as the ones in the bar however they seemed to be under pressure so well done it definitely did not intefere with our meal or the ambience.

Bar Restaurant Chef: Thank you excellent food and with my allergies i really ate well i believe the chef is BeJ and Romeo - fantastic you are masters of your craft.

Chef: Fantastic choice of food for a variety of tastes and menu is suitable for Celiacs, Vegetarians and anyone with a food allergy - thank you chef!

Staff: Very happy, friendly, some are extremely busy but well done to all the staff for making my first trip to the Druids Glen special.   I cant forget to mention John and Patrick for their assistance and general professionalism.

Inside Hotel: The décor was immaculate and the room kept in pristine condition. Wonderful relaxed atmosphere.

Grounds: Magical setting surrounded by beautifully kept lawns and plants and of course the top notch golf courses.

Location: 30 minutes from Dublin which is the main city of Ireland and all around historical sites we visited Glendalough which is a must if you go to Druids Glen

Downside: only one - children were allowed to run free by their parents which interfered with some of the staff who were delivering food to the bar but thats only a small thing!   It was however christmas and I am not a grinch!       See you all soon in Druids Glen",5,2017,02,20
238,Valentines night,"We had a very enjoyable night away at Druids Glen, food in Hugo's was exceptional, we took direction from waitress and glad we did. Front of house staff were very good, acknowledging we were repeat customers. What an upgrade!!!!! Between the Spa for herself and golf at Druids Glen we were very happy leaving. Knowing we'll be back. Thanks to all at Druids Glen. ",5,2017,02,20
238,Outstanding ,"Try to visit druids glen twice a year! Outstanding hotel your well looked after the second you walk through the door. Little touches like the porter, hot hand towels in the winter months treats for the children on arrival really is like a home away from home always thrilled to go back. Absolutely no complaints ",5,2017,02,20
238,Not as expected ,"My mum and I stayed here for a weekend. My mum really needed a break for various reasons so we were really excited to relax and unwind in a 5* setting. Unfortunately, although we had a good time as we were together, the hotel didn't live up to 5* standards whatsoever and we were very disappointed. 
The first thing - the complete lack of dining space/facilities. We ate in the formal restaurant, Hugo's, on the first night and it was nice. We were going to eat in the ""casual"" restaurant on the Saturday but seeing what it was like the evening before when we were having a drink, we thought again. It was overcrowded,noisy and hard to even get a table that wasn't low down to the floor. The staff look exhausted. So we decided to try to book Hugo's again on Saturday around lunch time. We were told quite abruptly that it was fully booked. No helpful suggestions. The member of staff (reluctantly) said that he would try to see what he could do, after we asked him to, and he said he would contact us to to let us know. We were never contacted. We went down at 7pm and asked again. A very helpful female member of staff, Victoria, said she would try to get us a table. A very unpleasant member of staff (male) was then rude and offhand saying the extra tables outside  Hugo's were for Hugo's customers only. 

We had to go to the bar, but there were no dining tables so we had to have our meals on our laps as there was nowhere else to sit. This is supposed to be a 5* hotel ""resort"" yet there was no where to sit for dinner!!

Other things- my mum ordered champagne to cheer herself up - she got prosecco instead. We ordered an Irish Times to the room - it never came so we had to go down and get it. We then brought it up to the room and left it to read later but when we got back to the room the housekeeping staff had removed it!

We spent a nice morning in Greystones, but when we wanted to leave we couldn't get a taxi for a while at the taxi rank so we called the hotel. The lady just sounded surprised and said ""do you want a taxi number?"" No- we wanted our 5* hotel to organise it for us!

Good things-The spa was very good we have to say and we had excellent facials. As I said Victoria and also Irina were v nice staff. The room was also nice but a little corporate. 

We absolutely love staying at 5* hotels and expect a certain standard when we are spending money on a 5* hotel. However we were completely let down by Druids Glen- 5*s should be all about the service and a ""can do, proactive,nothing is too much trouble"" attitude from the staff. Unfortunately we did not get this here. ",2,2017,02,18
238,Great but could be exceptional...,"Stayed for one night with husband and two children. Room was ready just after 4pm. Not sure why we were given a cot in the room as we had stated kids were 4 and 8. Room was stiflingly hot and despite reporting this to reception in the early evening and it being looked into by engineer, we had a sticky, uncomfortable night. Not helped by the fact that we were disturbed more than once by noisy guests returning to their rooms in the small hours (there was a wedding on in the hotel). Food was generally excellent- ate bar lunch and dinner. Good selection for kids. Food at breakfast was amazing but was unfortunately let down by poor service. Setting is amazing and on check- out management were immediately alerted and wanted to hear my  concerns which is excellent. ",4,2017,02,18
238,Amazing Hotel Wow staff.,"Had a fantastic stay recently in this fabulous hotel, from the time myself and my friend arrived we were treated So well from check in we were handed warm towels to warm up and shown to our room. We had booked some treatments in their spa and what can I say only fabulous. We had lunch in the bar after our spa treatments which was lovely. The weather was very cold and windy so we did not get to see the grounds of the hotel but next time I hope the weather will be a bit better. We had dinner in Hugo's on our first night and have to say the food was 5 star. Well done to the staff and chef for making my first trip to Druids Glen so special. Well done Druids Glen. Hope to come back soon.",5,2017,02,16
238,Gem of a place,"This hotel for a lone traveler on business was top notch, the staff were truly amazing and couldn't do enough for you. The food was really good from the bar meals, room service and breakfast the choice was vast.
I also managed a lovely evening trip to the spa where I left feeling pampered, relaxed and special.",5,2017,02,16
238,Absolutely top class,We spent two nights here recently on a Pigsback promotion. The hotel is absolutely top class. The rooms are large and well equipped with all the necessaries for your stay. The staff are all happy and friendly and very efficient which points to good management. My wife had a treatment in the spa and was delighted with the service she received. I found the food and waiting service to be excellent unlike one or two reviewers. We will definitely go again. The grounds are well maintained and the views from the outside rooms are beautiful.,5,2017,02,10
238,Food overpriced and poor,"Recently stayed in Druids Glen.  Staff nice, accommodation good.  Food very disappointing - meat tough, sides basic, children's dinners soo basic for the money - no effort made for kids.
Meat quality commented on to waiter when he asked but no offer on his part to make amends.
We certainly would not eat there again.Much nicer restaurants in the area that are more reasonably priced.",2,2017,02,09
238,Bar food only ordinary,Treating ourselves to bar food while watching the Ireland versus Scotland rugby match was not quite the good experience we expected.  The bar was very cold with air con. on at full blast despite a temperature outside of 6 deg.  food was really rather ordinary and overpriced.  Service was good but overall a disappointing experience.,3,2017,02,08
238,Absolutely Fantastic,"Top class. Quite simply the best hotel we have ever been to. The grounds, the common areas, the rooms, the restaurant, the food, the staff, the health centre are all five star. We don't want to leave and are contemplating barricading ourselves in our room. 11 out of 10. ",5,2017,02,07
238,Fantastic Hotel,I recently enjoyed a 2 night stay at this beautiful hotel and setting. The staff were fantastic and most professional and friendly. The décor was immaculate and the room kept in pristine condition. Everything about it was 5 star and while the dinners were very good the breakfast was unbelievable because of the vast selection to suit everybody and a chef there to prepare any speciality you may have had. The only item I could see being improved was the menu for Hugo's as it was repetitive on the second night. It is certainly expensive for food and drink but well worth it. The staff are the jewel in the crown.,5,2017,02,07
238,Fantastic night away ,We had our annual staff party here last Sunday. It was fantastic. The room was lovely and the staff were all so friendly and accommodating. I burnt my finger while getting ready and Shauna was so quick about getting the burn lotion and bandage. The food was delicious at the event and they made a beautiful vegetarian dish for me. We stayed in the residents bar until the early hours and the bar man was so friendly and very efficient. A great stay overall. ,5,2017,02,07
238,Relaxing family break,"We just spent a fabulous weekend here at Druids Glen. We received a very warm welcome by the reception staff with warm hand towels and apple cider while we checked in! We booked interconnecting rooms for our family of 6. The rooms were beautifully decorated and very comfortable. We enjoyed a very relaxing dinner in the bar with the children. Every staff member we encountered were so friendly and very welcoming to the children. The boys loved the leisure centre and were very impressed with the miniature robes and slippers in our room that they could wear to and from the Health Centre. The second night we had a fabulous early bird dinner in the restaurant. Again staff were excellent. Fantastic choice for breakfast. Playground, playroom full of toys for all ages and kitchenette for all our needs for our 7 month old baby. We were given bottled water upon check out. They really have thought of everything! This hotel is well managed and the attention to detail is excellent. We will definitely back 😃",5,2017,02,06
238,Nice,"Stayed here for two nights,its a lovely hotel,the room was of nice size,bed comfortable and bathroom was good,the hotel is clean and modern and the staff were wonderful,only bad point was the spa,its rated as a 5* hotel and spa,but I found the spa and swimming pool substandard for a 5* rating,small and dated and doesn't have an exclusive feel you would expect of a hotel with this rating,  overall this is a great hotel and I would stay here again",4,2017,02,06
238,Unimpressed ,"Have dined here many a time over the years since it opened first as the Marriott. Dined here on Sunday afternoon. Now I know the wedding fair was on so it would be busier then usual but to be honest it was the staff that let everything down. Everything was its usual pretty self aka hotel grounds hotel but the atmosphere from staff made our visit rushed and uncomfortable. As the bar was busy we had asked for a table in the restaurant and was told no! ( we probably would have stayed longer in the restaurant)
When we got a table I asked for a high chair and asked and asked! Eventually got one and ordered. 

The food  was faultless but I had asked for a baby bowl which I had asked to be brought before our food. I don't mind waiting for food but my baby does, 20 mins for a baby bowl! When I stood up to change the baby I was asked if I was leaving and if our table would be free! My dinner still un eaten in front of me! 
I can't believe how unprofessional and unfriendly the staff were.  Signed a Very disappointed customer.",2,2017,02,06
238,Staff Party,"I recently stayed at the Druids Glen Hotel for our annual staff party and I have to say the service was excellent.
The girls on the front desk were so lovely, I think it was Rebecca who checked us in.
The room was so lovely and we had a nice view of the golf course from our window.
We went to the bar for something small to eat and the food was delicious
Later in the evening my friend burnt her finger and a lovely girl named Shauna came to our room and helped us.
We had a great night at the party, all the staff were so nice.
And thank you to the concierge(cant remember his name but he was from Croatia) for assisting us with our luggage.  
I would definitely recommend this hotel to a friend and I can't wait to come back.",5,2017,02,06
238,Best ever ,"Just back from a 2 night stay with my husband and daughter, 9. From the time we arrived until check out the experience was first class. When we checked in we were offered warm hand towels to freshen up followed by warm apple cider. Just such a nice touch. Our room which was a deluxe family room, 2 double beds, really spacious modern and well decorated. 
We didn't have dinner in the hotel but breakfast on both mornings was fab. Something for everyone. Healthy, gluten free, veggie sausages, home made granola, freshly made omelets, pancakes. Just gorgeous. Staff so friendly and healthy.  Leisure centre really nice. Clean changing rooms. Really well equipped gym. Nice touch with a box of butlers chocs in the room for a birthday as well. Couldn't compliment the staff enough in all parts of the hotel.  We felt totally spoiled and really loved the whole 5 star experience! Can't wait to go back in April.  ",5,2017,02,05
238,Weather may have been dreary  but Druids Glen wasn't!,"Spent Spa Delight day and overnight at Druids Glen with a friend recently. Spa day was just wonderful and treatments amazing. Would highly recommend Exotic Lime and  Ginger Salt Glow and Customised Elemis Facial. Two hours of absolute pleasure.  Have been to a number of Spas previously but this one goes to the top of my list.
Room for overnight stay ready for us at 11.30 following phone call couple days before (check-in normally 4.00 pm). On arrival we found the staff friendly and very helpful. Room was just fantastic, with everything supplied. Chocolates and a welcome back card from the CEO was left in the room after we were asked if we had stayed there before. (Little touches like this make all the difference). Dinner in Hugo's restaurant was great and once again staff were wonderful. Would recommend Druids Glen without any hesitationews and intend visiting in the very near future.",5,2017,02,03
238,Another lovely visit!,"This is our second visit as a couple.....my husband last visited with our son and friends for a golfing Stag weekend.
This second time around didn't disappoint......we enjoyed a beautifully appointed large room  and the staff throughout the hotel were as friendly and helpful as we had remembered. . We would have no hesitation in recommending this lovely hotel.
There is plenty to see and do nearby and staff are  always available to advise and if you are a golfer it is heaven sent!! Enjoy!",5,2017,02,02
238,Fit for a king? Not for food ... ,"So this was a brilliant birthday present treated to a lovely day and night at Druids Glen resort..   So we got there round 3 and were greeted by 3 fab reception staff .. charming and lovely, funny, engaging helpful and above all most professional, ours was to be a fabulous room it was so lovely... had a treatment at spa so good I slept for an hour afterward.. then round 8 we went for food at the hotel bar sat in the beautiful conservatory and I ordered a pint and she had fancied a glass of wine which travelled round and round the room while we watched and waited, it came to our table eventually, then we waited again for what turned out to be a disappointment .. however at least my partner had fish it was serious !  Now but mine was a sirloin, but it was solid hard as old boots & yes it was cold, Cooked to perfection hours earlier it seemed and evidently reheated one can only assume...

I was so disappointed I hadn't the patience or determination to bother the service team, and spend loads of relaxing time going through the motions and become more disappointed, we weren't alone either later an other couple had a similar experience but did inform the walking waiter, and it took them ages to get the result they deserved .. I was just glad in the end i didn't take that route ... so I just enjoyed what was left to be enjoyed chocolate cake .. 

100€ for dinner and a couple of drinks .. not worth it ! Had better food in gastro pubs .. the brekkie next morning did make amends and made us smile ... 

I'm sure we will go back .. ",3,2017,02,01
238,great break,"Spent weekend at resort all excellent from room,food and general service. Special mention to Brian in bar and Alwyn in dining. Anniversary trip got complimentary drink (nice touch)Would def reccomend this establishment. 5star in every respect.",5,2017,02,01
238,Relaxing,Beautiful hotel in a beautiful location. Staff were friendly and curtious. Spa was a dream especially the relaxation room. Rooms were clean and comfortable. Plenty to do around the area aswel. We ate in both the bar and restuarant and food was fabulous. Breakfast buffet was great and included pancakes which i loved :),5,2017,01,31
238,Classy,5 stars awarded to what is a 5 star establishment. Druids Glen is a relaxing and beautifully decorated resort. Staff were charming and helpful throughout or stay which unfortunately was only 1 night! I did not sample the leisure facilities or spa so cannot comment. Restaurant food was very nicely presented. Plenty of choice at breakfast and service was very prompt. One small thing - it would be nice to have had table service for the hot breakfast offering but that is a suggestion as opposed to a criticism. ,5,2017,01,29
238,Amazing birthday dinner,"I was treated to the most special evening here to celebrate my birthday.  From the moment we walked through the door, to the moment we left, we were delighted by all.  

As you would expect, the quality of the food was superb and the standard of service impeccable.  Our server Lucie was friendly, knowledgeable and highly skilled. We certainly be back one day to relive this amazing experience!",5,2017,01,29
238,Great to be back again!,"A group of six of us made our annual visit to the Druids Glen Hotel this weekend. We were welcomed back warmly by all the staff. They couldn't do enough for us! From the warm towel, delicious warm apple cider drink and the most courteous conceige, to the Butler's chocolate,  l'occitane toiletries, prosecco and a welcome card from the manager, we were totally spoilt! My room was more than spacious and had a wonderful view of the golf course, trees, mountains and river. The twin beds were large and most comfortable with crisp white linen and a touch of warm and chic colours in the bed spread. The bed were turned down with chocolates upon our return to retire for the night. The bathroom has a shower and a bath. 

We made full use of the health club. Enjoyed the pool, jacuzzi, aromatic steam room and sauna. We were welcomed back to use the facilities even after we checked out the next day!!

We enjoyed our dinner in Hugo's restaurant in the hotel. We were looked after very well by all the staff. The food was as delicious as ever. We were the last to leave the restaurant and the staff were happily working around us, clearing tables and getting them ready for breakfast!

The breakfast that we so looking forward to never disappoint! All the food were really fresh and carefully prepared! Top class cappuccino!

We enjoyed walking around the hotel ground and around the perimeter of the golf course, surrounded by beautiful flowers, lakes, water fowls, river, waterfalls and even a quaint old stone bridge!

While waiting for our transport back to Dublin, we ordered tea in the cosy lounge. The bar was busy and the tea was delayed. The waiter was most apologetic and told us the tea was on the house! 

A big thank you to all the staff in the Druids Glen hotel, you made our stay really special and we will definitely be back again! We would vote you the best hotel in Ireland because of your wonderful staff and your excellent facilities!",5,2017,01,28
238,"Beautiful Hotel, some of the experience; not so much","This hotel is beautiful, the surrounds are fabulous and the staff are very welcoming and helpful. We also had food in the Thirteenth Bar, which was very tasty. Our only real problem was that the pool and jacuzzi were basically unusable for other guests with the number of kids running around and jumping in (despite the signs). Relaxing in the jacuzzi wasn't really practical, as the edge was being used as a diving board. Not once did a member of staff suggest to anyone this may be a danger to them and others. A shame really.",3,2017,01,27
238,Wonderful Hotel in an Amazing Setting,"Our family of 4 adults stayed here for 2 nights on New Years Eve.
 The hotel was beautifully decorated for The Christmas period and it was very warm cosy and welcoming.
Amy and Edel on Reception were very helpful to us in facilitating an early check-in as we arrived earlier than we expected.
Shauna was equally helpful when we were waiting for a particular table in the Bar/restaurant
The highlight of the weekend was probably the 6 Course Gala Dinner in Hugo’s Restaurant on New Year’s Eve- it really was a dining experience with a very attentive and pleasant Alwyn waiting on us.
The Staff are definitely the jewel in the Crown at Druids Glen . They are truly wonderful and just cannot do enough for their guest and deserve the highest of praise.
The rooms are really nice, quite spacious, and spotlessly clean with marvellous housekeeping staff.
We three girls used the Spa and we all had a fantastic treatment
It was a nice touch as we left to get the bottles of water for the trip. It’s only a small thing but it means a lot. We were going on to walk the wonderful cliff walk from Bray to Greystones.
Druids Glen is in a perfect location for touring around. We didn't have time this time to do and see all we wanted so we will be back
There were a few shortcomings which I outlined in an email to the CEO of Druids Glen Edward Stephenson when I returned home.
It’s easy to see from other Reviews on Trip Advisor that the CEO & Management are very proactive in addressing all feedback.
From my own experience, Mr Stephenson has gone to a lot of trouble to discuss these shortcomings and was eager to thrash them out in detail over the phone.
 At my last discussion with him yesterday- they had already implemented some changes to address the issues that we found  were not worthy of a 5 Star Hotel.
 They have other changes in the pipeline.
With an approach and attitude like this- Druids Glen is in very safe hands and I have no doubt that it will go from strength to strength. 
The attitude to my feedback is very impressive
We will certainly be back
Thanks from The Rafferty Family",5,2017,01,24
238,Not our first time and certainly not our last ,"We spent two fabulous night here this weekend. 

The staffs attention to detail is exceptional, from the welcome warm hand cloths on arrival to the thoughtful bottle of water when leaving. 

As this was not our first time staying in the hotel, we were given a welcome back card and chocolates. 

Although all the staff in the hotel could not be any more friendly, accommodating and thoughtful there was one member of staff in particular who made our stay very memorable. Min in the bar went above any beyond to ensure we thoroughly enjoy both of evening meals there. We had originally planned on eating in Hugo's the second night but enjoyed ourselves so much the previous night we cancelled our reservation. On the Saturday night it was my partners birthday so Min and the staff arranged a birthday plate for him. This combined with the brilliant music that night made our weekend. 

We can't wait for our next visit 😊 ",5,2017,01,22
238,Hotel is fine but food is poor and over-priced,"Hotel rooms/facilities are fine but the food is poor and over-priced, plus theres not much of it on the plate -  there are many better pubs and restaurants in the area that do better food than this place",2,2017,01,21
238,Food Not Great But Beautiful Rooms,"We stayed here for one night and apart from the room being beautiful and comfortable, it wasn't great. 
The swimming pool is like a public leisure centre pool and when we went to go for a relaxing swim the pool was jam packed with kids having swimming lessons, with their parents sitting in chairs literally on the pool deck with blue shoe covers on and in rows on chairs watching the pool, so it was a little uncomfortable to go for a leisurely swim (to say the least). 
The food in the bar was nice, but overpriced in my opinion. If you have time you'd be better to drive to Avoca Handweavers nearby and have a delicious lunch there at half the price!  We had our evening meal in Hugo's, and honestly it was just alright, not great at all. I'm baffled by the other reviews of Hugo's saying how good it is, but each to their own. I wouldn't rate a plain bowl of mashed potato, plain mange tout and plain boiled cauliflower 5 star eating. Our meal came to approx €135/40, I can't remember exactly! We had a €20 discount from a package we were on. When we were paying the bill, the waiter asked us, to both my and my husbands utter shock....... ""Are you leaving gratuity?""....I have never felt so uncomfortable in a restaurant in my life! We felt the waiter was quick cocky when serving us, but this was cockiness at it's best! Call us tight, but we had no plans on leaving a tip on an an overpriced €135 average meal. To avoid saying ""no' straight out the waiter, I said ""oh we'll leave gratuity at checkout"". He practically through our card back at us and didn't even look as us or say enjoy your evening or anything. He was clearly very pissed off we were leaving no tip for him. I immediately complained and gave my feedback to reception, who I think were equally shocked, and the lovely gentlemen there said that ""service should all be included in your stay"" . They also asked if there was anything they could do, but of course there wasn't, I just wanted to let them know that the waiter seems to be asking for tips and gratuity! I was then feeling very uncomfortable going for breakfast the next morning, in case said waiter would be there and would be rude to us (assuming he was spoken to) and also because we didn't tip him, but thank god he wasn't. At checkout, I planned on mentioning again what happened, but the receptionist only took our keys and said ""thank you, see you again"" , I thought she's ask us how are stay was or did we have a nice time and when she didn't I left it.
Don't think we'll be back.",3,2017,01,20
238,Top Hotel,"Brilliant hotel in all aspects, no complaints. Great hotel for families, very child friendly with a dvd library, great play room and club. Super spa and food was top class, with the best breakfast selection. Best hotel staff who were very helpful and friendly. 5 star hotel that you feel you could relax in! Also great location for exploring Wicklow.",5,2017,01,18
238,Great - Suitable for those with AND without kids,"We stayed here for two nights in January with our baby and were delighted with it. We had a great time walking the grounds, swimming and generally relaxing. This hotel caters very well for young children but in a respectful way to other guests e.g kids can use the pool but there are certain times during the day when the pool is adult only. Children are allowed into the bar, which serves food, but must leave by 9pm and last orders for those with kids in Hugo's is 7pm. Everyone wins. The only criticism we had was that the Bearnaise sauce on our steak in the bar was awful. The food in Hugo's was fantastic, I had delicious hake, obviously cooked by and excellent chef who understands food, flavours and textures. The staff are so friendly and accommodating and seem genuinely interested in helping in any way possible at Druids Glen.",5,2017,01,18
238,Wonderful,My other half and I shared a birthday get away to Druids Glen. The staff are friendly and attentive. The accommodation stunning and comfortable. We had a wonderful break away from it all. I could not fault a single thing. The Spa and Health Club were fantastic. One of the highlights for me though was the meal we had in Hugo's restaurant. This may just have been the best meal I have ever had when eating out anywhere. It was utterly exquisite. If you want to treat yourself or someone else or need somewhere to stay when on business do not hesitate to book at Druid's Glen you will not be disappointed.,5,2017,01,16
238,Beautiful Hotel,"We stayed in the Druids Glen on December 24th. 
Our Christmas party had booked Spa treatments followed by drinks and dinner in Hugo's restaurant. 
The Hotel was beautiful, it was warm, inviting and really well decorated for Christmas. I enjoyed a massage in the spa. One of our party booked a manicure and pedicure - not to be recommended I'm afraid, it was poorly done. 
Our dinner was the highlight, the food was excellent, as was the service.
The Menu is very well adapted for those with allergies and intolerances.
The hotel staff have to be praised, nothing is too much trouble, everything is done with a smile - even at such a busy time.",4,2017,01,15
238,Fabulous hotel,"We stayed here for a family celebration (8 people). The hotel restaurant food was gorgeous, the hotel rooms were the nicest I have ever stayed in and I have stayed in hundreds of hotels around Ireland. The spa facilities were amazing. We will be back this year with all of the family to have the 5 star experience again. ",5,2017,01,14
238,Great Retreat,Just spent a night in Druids Glen for my mother's birthday. We were checking it out ahead of my daughters wedding in a few weeks. I can't speak highly enough of the staff and the services. We dined in the  restaurant last night and had an excellent meal. The rooms were very comfortable and the spa was excellent. Keep up the good work and we will see you again in a few weeks ,5,2017,01,14
238,Overall We were pleased with our stay,"We stayed at Druids to celebrate a special  occasion - 
I gave  4 stars because it's a very good hotel but with it's own share of weak spots

When I made the reservations I was told  it was  easy to get a cab from Greystones , Unfortunately, it wasn't the case on a weekend or at least on that day  and there was no taxi company to call ,so We waited for ages for a cab (not the best way to start)

When we  arrived, at the hotel there was an event  so there were too many  staff & guests  hanging  around at the entrance  so the atmosphere was a bit chaotic. 
Upon  checked-in I asked if I could book a table for an afternoon tea and the receptionist responded right away  that it was  fully booked w/o any attempt to see if she could accommodate us.
In our room coffee  and tea making facilities  included half-used sugar  and empty sachets of  chocolate drink  used by previous guests.
Health Club staff were great but  the  compact, noisy  & crowded  swimming pool was a let-down. 
Having said that, We  enjoyed our celebration  in spite of some minor disappointments 
 Our evening meal  at Hugo's restaurant was fantastic and the staff at the restaurant  were very  pleasant 
In our room I  particularly loved   the spacious  bathroom ( a separate bath and a shower) 
We were  thankful for our  lovely and quiet room & late check-out 
All the meals we had at Druids were absolutely delicious & well presented
Staff were amiable  and courteous
Overall We were pleased with our stay 

We are considering a return visit , hopefully without  hiccups next time.",4,2017,01,12
238,My stay at druids glen.,This is my 5th time to stay in druids glen. From the guy that takes ur bags as u come to the door the receptionist team and the waitresses and waitres bar staff and cleaners. What amazing job they do they make u feel so welcome and each and everyone of them so helpful. A huge thank u to shauna who went out of her way for my daughter and myself..thank you everyone see you very soon ..,5,2017,01,10
238,Second time here - still great.,Visited with my wife to celebrate my birthday. Stayed for 2 nights. Really great occasion. Room lovely. Ate in the restaurant and it was great. Wonderful walks around the gardens. Staff very friendly and couldn't do enough for you.,5,2017,01,09
238,Very Good,"Mostly it was an amazing experience. Lovely rooms, fantastic views and lots of entertainment for adults and kids. My one problem with the hotel was the bike rental. The bikes were rickety and you were not allowed to ride on the property; you had to ride on the road. But it was one small hitch in a fantastic experience. Would recommend.",4,2017,01,08
238,Beautiful Hotel,"We stayed over here for one night with our 2 young children, we arrived in darkness so really couldn't appreciate the beautiful surroundings. Check in was easy, despite the hotel being extremely busy, the kiddie packs were a nice touch. 
Room was excellently laid out, great size, bathroom fabulous. The kiddie sized robes were a real novelty for the kids! Swimming pool area was great and this is the type of hotel where you can totally wear your robe to the leisure and spa areas. 
We had a little bit of a drama with trying to get some bedtime snacks for the kids. We only wanted some milk and some biscuits for them but couldn't get that at the bar, ended up having to go back to our room and order room service, wait 30 mins and pay the delivery charge to the room. A bit stressful and I was really not a happy camper that night. However, the following morning completely turned around our experience, from the friendly staff and the breakfast, the breakfast is fabulous, everything and anything, all fresh and super tasty. The staff were so friendly and really engaged with all residents. We were simply blown away, I really think our incident the night before was just a blip, once I let the management know about our dissatisfaction, they were wonderful and extremely apologetic. They do want your stay to be as positive as possible. 
The children's play room was also amazing and something we didn't find until the morning. The grounds of the hotel are beautiful. We will definitely be back, one night was  not enough, you need a minimum 2 night stay here to really appreciate everything this hotel has to offer.",4,2017,01,08
238,Total relaxation ,"Both myself and my wife have stayed at Druids Glen hotel many times and it never fails to impress both of us. We stayed for two nights in early December and the hotel was amazing, the reception had a beautiful Christmas tree and life size reindeer and sleigh around which the young children had a wonderful time. Even though the hotel was extremely busy the staff were still as professional as always and the high standard that Druids Glen is renowned for was still evident. We had dinner in Hugo's restaurant on the Saturday night which is always an amazing experience, the waiters and waitresses are outstanding and so professional. When you are greeted with such a warm welcome by the director of food and beverage Patrick Kickham-Lennon who's professionalism, knowledge and customer service makes a visit to Hugo's a memorable one.  I have booked three nights in March for my wife's birthday and we look forward to a special evening in Hugo's. So whether it's golf or a spa or just a break to relax Druids Glen is the ultimate experience you won't be disappointed with. Thanks again to all at Druids Glen just outstanding. Pat & Anita Kenny",5,2017,01,07
238,Relaxing stay,"We got a very nice spacious room. Pool, spa area was ok, nothing special and open to the public. Dinner and service were good. Nice hotel, good a resonable deal at the time. Didn't play golf though but looked inviting. ",4,2017,01,07
238,Post xmas break ,"Visited the hotel at start of January for post xmas break.  Beautiful hotel and grounds.  Lovely welcome by staff. Stayed in a superior room really lovely. Bed v comfy and probably the best choice tv channels I've ever had in a hotel (dvd player also in room).
Bathroom v nice with separate bath and shower.  L'occitane toiletries a lovely  luxurious touch. Ate in bar and food v nice, again staff v friendly and helpful.  Breakfast lovely  good choice of buffet and cooked breakfast  (self service ) fresh and hot. Lots of  families staying in the hotel(time of year)  didn't bother us as hotel is extremely child friendly with kids clubs available.  Check out quick small gift given for our kids ""so you don't go home empty handed"" lovely touch.  
Definately will return and bring the kids next time. Although we didn't go ,there are some lovely walks around the resort.",5,2017,01,06
238,Great hotel,"Druids Glen is set in beautifully kept grounds surrounded by very well maintained gardens, the hotel is immaculately clean, we were met by friendly and helpful staff. The room was spacious and tidy. Partner and I had a facial each in the adjoining spa, very nice, slightly annoyed that when booked I had requested a couples room and was told that this would not be a problem, this was not the case when we arrived, only a minor issue really. Went for a drink in the bar which was not overly busy, however the 5 people behind the bar made no attempt to serve us, after 10 minutes we left. Overall an enjoyable stay. ",4,2017,01,06
238,The Garden of Ireland,"Druids Glen is set in the picturesque Irish countryside. The hotel offers a very relaxing environment which is family friendly. The rooms at the back of the hotel offer far reaching views over the Wicklow mountains, 307 and 305 were on the side we stayed; the opposite side has a view over a courtyard. The rooms are large and comfortable.

The grounds of the hotel are very well kept, the golf course looked in very good condition for December. 

Overall we had a good experience at the hotel. The only negative was the bar service, it took over an hour for food to start being served and it was 15 minutes from the first dish arriving to the last. The hotel was very apologetic and provided compensation for the inconvenience.

This is a good family hotel and is very relaxing.",4,2017,01,05
238,"I experienced improved services, cleanliness and rooms compared with my last stay","My most recent annual visit to the Druids Glen was over the Christmas period. This time I could not find a single fault with my stay. The room on the third floor was superb in every respect from aesthetics and layout to the Cathedral ceilings and high quality of toiletries. Christmas Day buffet was wonderful in the main ballroom and staff could not have been more helpful in guiding guests to the wonderful tables of different spreads.

Indoor pool water was warm and I had the pool to myself for an early morning swim.

Great walks to in the grounds and down to the old golf club house.

Not surprised it is booked out every year.",5,2017,01,01
238,Fantastic hotel experience - fabulous service!,"We decided to have a staycation this year and visit some of Ireland's attractions and five star hotels. 
We booked a two night stay and got a great deal. We arrived early and checked in straight away. The receptionists were so friendly and explained everything. We have two small children and they were given little colouring packs and were delighted. It is very family orientated and children are really welcomed. 
The breakfast was excellent and had excellent choice. There was lots of space for families.
We toured around Wicklow and took in Powerscourt Waterfall and the Estate - both were excellent. We went to Glendalough and Greystones and other smaller villages which are all easily accessible from Druids Glen.
I needed to use a microwave and asked at reception. I was escorted to the baby room which was fully equipped should you need anything - nappies, wipes, fruit pots etc. It was fantastic and had a microwave and little kitchen. 
The pool was lovely and the changing facilities were good. There are lovely walks and a nice outside playground.
We had a fantastic hotel experience from start to finish. Customer service is amazing and staff were so professional and well trained and nothing was too much. I would highly recommend this hotel and the amazing service made our stay so memorable! We will definitely be back!",5,2017,01,01
238,The best scampi ever,We had a lovely evening in the club house. A warm welcome was given to us by Caroline our waitress. We ordered the scampi. It was beautifully cooked and plenty of it..crispy and succulent. Ordered a side of onion rings which went down a treat. We left happy.,5,2016,12,31
238,Super Family Break,"This is the 3rd visit I've made to Druids Glen this year and each time I visit, the party with me gets bigger as we have all grown to love it so much.
This visit was a 3 day Break starting on St Stephens day, there was 9 of us in total with an age bracket of 8-75 years of age. Hard to cater for you'd think ??? However, Druids does it perfectly. From Bike riding to spa treatments, golfing to kids club. There is literally every age very well and seamlessly catered for.
The Rooms are super comfy with ample space and all the mod cons you could ask for, also beautifully decorated.
Each and every meal we had was delicious ( and that's alot of food seeing as not one member of the party chose to eat off site) The is bar is lovely and relaxed with great service with a smile. We ate here on two nights and thoroughly enjoyed both experiences. Special mention to Chris, he is super at his job!!! Breakfast was easy and plentiful. Despite the hotel being full I honestly never waited more that a minute to be seated. The buffet selection was plentiful and varied. Mixed Berry smoothie is a winner, as is the omelette section.
We ate in Hugo's Restaurant on one evening and each and every course was a reason for envy as we shared it among the table, dipping into each others dishes. I cant remember the name of the lovely lady that served us but she was super friendly and efficient. To be fair, all of the staff are !!
Then its comes to the bill, here was where I'd be sure it would get complicated as I tried to organise the billing for 9 people over 3 days. Edel at the recption desk made really easy and painless and divided up and explained charges with ease.
So in short, a big thank you to Druids Glen for making our Christmas. Each and everyone of us enjoyed it. We are already planning our next visit !!

McGowans / Murphy's & Sweeney",5,2016,12,29
238,Another great visit to Druids Glen,"My most recent visit to Druids Glen was from 29th November for three nights.

The resort has now became our top choice when planning short breaks in Ireland.
I travel with my elderly parents and have visited several times over the last 2-3 years.
They both are made to feel welcome at the hotel and return home relaxed.
The hotel and resort is ideal for them as it is so spacious, airy and just has that warm, relaxed and homily feel to it.

Unfortunately on this occasion we didn't get to walk through the grounds but have done so previously.

Breakfast at the hotel is amazing with such a great choice on offer, including the freshly made omelettes and pancakes and also the honey.

We also ate in the bar and food here is also top notch.

I can say very little wrong about the hotel and hopefully we will be back sometime soon.

Before I sign off, I have to comment on how friendly the staff are.  they do make you feel welcome.  in particular I have to mention Adrienne and Oliver for really going out of their way in helping us along (and also remembering us from previous visits).  
Sometimes its the small touches that really make a difference.",5,2016,12,23
238,Amazing,"This is a very nice property with the most amazing service front to back.  The rooms are top notch and the staff will set a new standard of what is the best.  In the bar, Chris and Paddy were great professionals our whole start was impressive.  The gentleman wearing the top hat in the front is probably the most professional hotel staff member I have ever met.  Take care of them on your stay, they will spoil you from start to finish.",5,2016,12,22
238,Christmas mini family break,"Fantastic Cgtistmas family break from start to finish. Meibhe on reception was so welcoming and friendly. The rooms, swimming pool, grounds and hotel itself are impeccable. The games room for children is such a great idea with a great array of toys for all ages. We slept really well as the place is so quiet. Will definitely return.",5,2016,12,21
238,Haven of Tranquillity in December,"Druid's Glen is a 5-star hotel, which is a haven of tranquillity, located on a famous golf course in County Wicklow. It is easily accessible by car from the M11 motorway. We arrived at a quiet time of year and thus were given the full service individual treatment. Despite a few special requests the staff coped very well and everything was done very quickly with a minimum of fuss. The hotel is very clean and well maintained to a very high standard. Room 319 was large and spacious with a lovely soft bed and all the usual amenities.  This was a standard room with a fantastic view over the famous 13 tee on the golf course. The leisure centre is easily accessible from your room and has a well-equipped gym, an 18-metre pool, along with jacuzzi, sauna, and steam rooms. There is an excellent 4 kilometres walk over paved paths around the perimeter of the golf course to 400-hundred-year-old Woodstock house, which is the golf course clubhouse. As a hotel resident, you can explore the clubhouse and its small museum featuring some famous golf exhibits and people. Breakfast in the hotel was very good and served in the Hugo restaurant. We also had an evening meal there which came to €50 each for three courses and no wine. The food was excellent and the only complaint I could have was that the chocolate bomb for dessert was a bit of a disappointment as the chocolate sauce was not hot enough to melt the bomb. All in all, the Druid's Glen Hotel is an excellent choice for a 2-night relaxing stay.",5,2016,12,20
238,Very enjoyable,"My wife and I booked a night at Druids glen through a Groupon deal as it included money off a round of golf. 
The hotel is very cosy, especially as it was Christmas and had plenty of decoration and working fireplaces.
The room was pretty big compared to most hotels 'basic' rooms and had everything you want or need, including a huge and very comfortable bed!
The staff were helpful and were very obliging throughout the stay.
We didn't eat in any restaurants but enjoyed breakfast, nor did we use the spa but the Druids Heath golf course is just incredible. I can imagine in summer it's even better.
I'll be back to this place again.",4,2016,12,20
238,Lovely staff,I stayed at Druids glen for my friends wedding! I had an amazing night and the staff were extra kind especially a girl named Veronica who took care of our table and was very kind and considerate. Food and decorations were lovely,5,2016,12,19
238,Birthday surprise night away ,"We stayed in Druids Glen the 16th December as a surprise treat for my birthday. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and could not recommend it highly enough. From the moment we arrived the staff couldn't have done more for us. There was a lovely atmosphere in the hotel and gorgeous Christmas decorations! All the small touches were perfected including heated hand towels on arrival to reception. We could not find one fault with the hotel! The room was gorgeous and very spacious, dinner in the Hugo restaurant was excellent. We were served by a French waiter who gave superb recommendations. Leisure facilities were very good and there's a lovely long walk around the grounds of the hotel. We'll definitely be making a return visit! :) ",5,2016,12,18
238,Return visit,"We only stayed one night, but enjoyed every minute of it. Super friendly and professional check in, lovely room overlooking a stream, big bath with separate shower and tub. Hotel all decorated for the holidays looked so festive. We took advantage of the steam room, pool and hot tub. Husband had a massage!After a quick rest, we changed and enjoyed a drink in the bar then Dinner in main restaurant with fabulous service from a French gentleman that was friendly and informative. 
The next day we only had time for a quick breakfast and off we went, but we made the most of every minute at the Druids Glen and look forward to a return visit soon!",5,2016,12,17
238,Wonderful,"Stayed here last night 16th Dec. and really enjoyed our stay. From the moment we arrived we received a warm welcome from the doorman and reception. The room was clean and comfortable. The Spa was excellent and I got the best manicure ever from the lovely Joanne. Hugo's restaurant had a lovely ambience with low lighting with a fire blazing and candlelight. The waiter Loic was so friendly with excellent recommendations for the menu. The food was truly amazing and made our stay all the more special, so compliments to the very talented chefs. The bar was cosy with really good entertainment and friendly barstaff who made great cocktails. This hotel is very child friendly so as a couple it can be a bit off-putting however there was no children allowed in the restaurant and by the time we went in to the bar they were all gone to bed so this would not put us off returning. Id be back in a heartbeat!",5,2016,12,17
238,Family Visit ,"Visited with 2 adults a 2year old and an 8 week old. Fantastic first impressions as you walk into the lobby, beautifully decorated for Christmas,big open fires all very inviting. No problem checking in early so headed straight to our room. Room very spacious and equipped with everything you need. Checked out the kids play room and the baby room where you can make up bottles or sterilise your own. Both fantastic for when traveling with children. Overall very impressed with this resort, will definitely return!",5,2016,12,17
238,Wedding,"Recently went to a family wedding we stayed 3 nights and the staff could not do enough for us, even using a napkin to reset the table after my niece spilt her water. The food was lovely and the room was very spacious with a turndown service with chocolate which was a nice touch they even checked toiletries where all full at turndown time. The only downside to my whole experience was the bar staff where extremely slow not at the wedding but in the main bar and food service in the bar was also slow even when it wasn't busy. This would not stop me going back again though as overall it was a fabulous experience ",4,2016,12,14
238,Mixed,"As a family of 10 and 3 children we planned some time ago an overnight at Druid's Glen to celebrate my father's 80th birthday and we included afternoon tea and dinner for all during the stay.  
I will start with the positives:
**The hotel itself is great - rooms are spacious, comfortable, spotlessly clean and equipped with everything you could possibly need for a stay.  Depictions on the hotel's website are pretty much accurate which can quite frequently not be the case. 
**With the exception of during afternoon tea where staff seemed stressed and therefore inefficient,  staff were very friendly, attentive and accommodating.
**Dinner at Hugos offered a very good menu.  Food was of excellent quality, sourced locally as much as possible, and cooked exactly to guest's liking. Presentation was very simple with focus on taste and quality.  Service was impeccable and could not be faulted. Wines recommended excellent.  The children who travelled with us (due to age) had a babysitter in one of the rooms we were staying and ordered from roomservice since children are not permitted in Hugos after 7pm though they can eat in the bar until 9pm.  
** As it was my father's birthday, the small touches such as chocolates and note in his suite, and specially presented plates during afternoon tea and after dinner were very much appreciated and thoughtful gestures.
**Breakfast in Hugo is as you would expect - omelettes cooked to order and a good hot selection etc.
Now for the less positive:
**Children have access to the pool area between 9-12pm so if you want peace in the pool avoid during those hours at all costs!  The hotel is very child-welcoming.
**Afternoon tea - admittedly we were late for our 3pm afternoon tea but at check-in at 3.15pm reception said that they would call Hugo's to inform we would be later than expected.  By the time everyone checked in and made it down to Hugos, we were all seated by 3.45.  Again, we were 10 adults and 3 children.  It was quite apparent that afternoon teatime was busy and unfortunately there was just not enough staff to cope.  We waited 30 mins for our tea/coffee order to be taken eventually arriving some 45mins after being seated.  Equally, the food was extremely slow to arrive with the savouries arriving at just before 4.50pm - over an hour after arriving.  Sweet cakes arrived a little quicker after that.  Twice during the tea we brought it to the attention of the servers that we had been there quite a while to which we received apologies and nods of acknowledgement but this not speed matters up.  Also, things were forgotten like drinks for 2 of the children and when staff were reminded we got ""oh, yes, on their way"" and still didn't arrive.  I really can't see why it took sooooo looooong!  Everything served is pretty much pre-prepared and is just a matter of plating so I just don't know where the issue lay. We spent most of the afternoon tea feeling lost and forgotten - not how I wanted my father's big day to start.  If this had not been the case, my Service rating would have been ""Excellent"" instead of ""Very Good"".  (A small minor thing I know but it would have been nice if our food had been served on the stands like everyone else for the effect of ""afternoon tea"" as opposed to on flat plates).
Having said that, this doesn't detract from the overall experience at Druid's Glen - as said, it is a wonderfully welcoming, comfortable hotel and worth a visit.  I will certainly return.  It's just a shame that for whatever reason on the afternoon of our stay there were some issues with afternoon tea service delivery.",4,2016,12,12
238,Mrs,"Just home having had a wonderful stay in Druids Glen.   Could not fault this hotel on any aspect  Right from ths wonderful check in staff ..Fri night 9 th dec to the check out staff this morning it was thd most enjoyable relaxed break I have had in a long time .  I would put this hotel miles ahead of The Shelbourne, The Westbury for food ,rooms ,ambience, location ,.The leisure centre is beautiful and spotless. The beds are so comfortable.   I hope I haven't left any thing out .....oh yes The Breakfast....what can I say...the best I have ever seen in any hotel here ir abroad ....can't wait to go back ",5,2016,12,10
238,Great hotel facilities  and accommodation ,came to druids Glen for a wedding. We had a great time but they through the 3days we stayed. During our stay people and ourselves found the bar prices overpriced and the serviced at their restaurants very slow which is a shame. something they need to improve.,4,2016,12,10
238,"Relaxing surroundings , top class staff for 50th Birthday celebration ",We celebrated a group of good friends 50th birthdays at the weekend in Druids Glen . The dinner B&B package was good value . We added on golf for the boys and a spa treatment for the ladies and both were enjoyed at a high standard . I organised the event and has made several requests from the staff at the time of booking  and all these were fulfilled . All staff were helpful on all occasions from the Spa to reception to waiting to the room cleaning staff . Will definitely go back to Druids Glen again in the near future . A lovely relaxing hotel in wonderful surroundings with highly motivated helpful staff . What more can you ask for ! ,5,2016,12,06
238,Fabulous experience - great value for money,"We visited here in December 2015 a catch up for 5 girlfriends and had such a good time that we booked again for December 2016.  We started with Afternoon Tea at 2pm - a treat for just €24 each.  The only niggle with this was there was too much cake - very hard to digest.  We would have loved a fruit skewer or a sorbet to break down some of the bread, cakes and scones.  Service was excellent.  So dinner at 8pm was just a main course - no room for starter or dessert and I just ordered a salad to make up for all the carbs earlier in the day!  Again service was excellent.  Breakfast was a huge buffet and glad to report I didn't eat again until Sunday night!  Amazing value for money - we will be booking for December 2017!  Hot towels as a welcome at check-in and top hats on the bell hops all very well received",5,2016,12,06
238,Wonderful experience,We stayed at this hotel for our wedding anniversary weekend. Amazing from start to finish. Wonderful room overlooking the golf course. Delicious food. Very attentive service at all times during our stay. Exceptionally clean and well presented hotel. More than a 5 star experience. Highly recommended for luxurious and relaxing break. Will return again soon.,5,2016,11,30
238,Fantastic hotel,"This was my 3rd time staying in Druids Glen and the 2nd in 6 months although this time it was just my husband and I (no kids). It was a different experience being able to relax, take our time and enjoy the peace and quiet. 

The room was spacious with a view of the picturesque golf course.  The food was delicious and the service throughout was excellent.  The breakfast alone is an experience. Each night the staff came in and turned down our bed and left little chocolates on the sheets. We loved our stay, this is hands down one of the best hotels we have stayed in. ",5,2016,11,29
238,Could not be faulted.,"Warm, inviting, comfortable, spotlessly clean, rooms are well appointed. Staff are wonderfully pleasant, friendly and helpful.

We ate both lunch and dinner in the 13th Bar. Food was very good and well priced. Service was excellent. We look forward to another visit. We loved it.",5,2016,11,28
238,Terrible - should not be a 5 star hotel,"Druids Glenn has gone down hill - big time!  I have been before and had a good time, not great, but good, and then I went again 12/11/2016 with my wife and had probably the worst experience staying in a hotel ever.

I have a lot of experience staying in 5 star hotels in Ireland and Europe and I can say with experience and confidence that this hotel should not have 5 stars.

Here is why I say this:

The room:
Our room was ""bog standard"", really nothing special, faced inwards so no view - certainly not worth the £250 price tag. The bathroom was awful, the shower fluctuated hot and cold, and not just once during a busy time of the day, it did this during the evening and during the morning.  However worse than that were the flies, which weirdly kept climbing out of the toilet. I would flush them away, and within a short while more would crawl out.

The spa:
Druids Glen markets itself as somewhere peaceful and tranquil, a place to go and chill and enjoy the facilities. On our visit the spa facilities was closer to the local leisure centre, that is, very noisy and full of children, broken showers, and a malfunctioned steam room which meant that there was even less space for ""grown ups"".  Now I have children, 4 of them, and I am all for family friendly hotels, however when I want to escape the children, recuperate from the stress of life I try and find a tranquil 5 star hotel with excellent facilities where I can do that. Druids Glen appears that way when you look at the pictures and read their website, and that is why I booked it, Mr Glen, in my mind clearly mis-sold this to me.

The sleep:
At this stage I'm fed up of complaining, it actually tires me out, because it's not usually my nature, however this was my worst sleep at a hotel - ever!  Starting with the bed, which had a dip in the mattress, that made it uncomfortable - but I ventually fell asleep. I can usually sleep through anything, however at 1am lots of ladies started to return from the bar, making as much noise as a bunch of new students away from home for the first time heckling at one another. If this was just a passing racket I'd put up with it, but it went on for over an hour. Then our neighbours came back! We had one of those rooms which had an adjoining door for when families come stay, however this was so thin that I could hear every word from the conversation next door, even when they where not being particularly loud. Eventually I had to call reception and ask them to quieten them. I think I got about 4 hours broken sleep and was more exhausted on Sunday leaving the hotel, than when I arrived!

Food:
Average - restaurant bill was £100 - for an than average dinner with some very expensive drinks.

The staff:
Polite and helpful - really no complaints there.  

Conclusion:
I was so annoyed with my stay that I decided to let the staff know during checkout. The poor girl at reception was so embarrassed she promised to put their director of operations in touch in order to get the feedback directly. She then offered me a bottle of water for the trip home - all she had in her power to do.

Their director did call the next day - I explained everything above to her. I have my own business, I depend upon client feedback to make it the best it can be - I need this, so I think it is important to give it straight and to the point.  The director promised to investigate and call me back. Nearly two weeks later I've heard nothing - I didn't expect to, nor do I want them to. I won't be back, even if they where to offer compensation of a free night - time is precious and I would rather spend it elsewhere.",1,2016,11,25
238,Pleasantly boring (exactly what I was looking for),"A beautiful hotel at a fantastic location. Golf players will have a blast! The service is excellent. The bar and the restaurant very nice too. Spacious rooms. 
The atmosphere is so quiet, so relaxing, so pleasantly boring (I am not even a golf player) I didn't want to leave!
Actually, I'll definitely go back!",4,2016,11,23
238,Excellent customer service,"Stayed during the mid term; customer service was of the highest level by all the staff.  Kids were catered for so well.  Would highly recommend.  Room was clean and of a generous size.  Playroom for kids great idea.  Food was good and the bar was accommodating for families.
The staff were exemplars in customer service- nothing was a problem - they could not do enough for you.  Breakfast was fab and again the staff were brilliant. 
The hotel is well run and when you see happy staff it's a good sign of good management. 
We will definitely be back for another visit - a lot of hotels could do with taking a visit to Druids to experience and learn how a hotel should be run - excellent staff excellent hotel - well done to all the team at Druids Glen : keep up the great work",5,2016,11,23
238,Great place to relax and unwind,"Just spent a wonderful weekend with my wife in Druids Glen. A mix up with my travel agency meant that my reservation was not made, but the checkin staff were very understanding and offered me the Presidential Suite at a much reduced price for the weekend. Very generous of them. And it proved to be a wonderful room. Overall the staff were incredible - friendly, helpful and warm at every step - checkin, room service, bar, restaurant - everyone made us feel very welcome. The bar has a good buzz to it with wonderful drinks and food. The restaurant is excellent - loved the breakfast - probably the best buffet breakfast I've ever had. We spent our Saturday exploring beautiful Wicklow - there are some incredible hikes within a 20min drive from the hotel. And Sunday was spent in the spa, which was very enjoyable. Overall one of my most enjoyable hotel stays, and one I look forward to repeating again soon.",5,2016,11,21
238,Yet another fantastic stay!,"Myself and my partner have stayed in the Druids Glen a number of times and have always had a positive experience so when it came to getting my sister and her new husband a wedding present it seemed like the ideal place to all go for a night. From the moment we arrived, we were welcomed by friendly and enthusiastic staff. The lady who checked us in was delighted we were there for a special occasion and upgraded my sister and her husband to a suite completely unprompted at no extra charge. The hotel was beautifully decorated, our rooms were superb, the food was excellent as always but the high point for us was the quality of service. It is such a relaxing atmosphere, with lovely friendly staff who make you feel at ease. Would recommend to anyone looking for a relaxing get away! ",5,2016,11,20
238,Peaceful & relaxing.,"Very welcoming place for a relaxing break. Rooms are very comfortable & robes & slippers make it easy when using the pool as you can shower in the comfort of your own room. Choice of food at breakfast was excellent, & bar food was excellent too. Staff were very friendly & helpful.  Well worth a visit & great location.",5,2016,11,19
238,Family friendly hotel in the 'garden of Ireland' ,"My wife and I stayed here with our two kids  (6) & (1). Our room (206) was big and spacious. Complete with two double beds and a travel cot. Our deal included a bottle of Prosecco on arrival, which was tastefully delivered to our room soon after.  Check in was quick and polite. Hotel is just radiant and pristine clean. Cosy fires dotted throughout. Every member of staff work tirelessly and with a smile on their faces to ensure guests are looked after. Great wee childrens play park onsite, and beautiful scenic walks to the boundary of the golf course...not to mention the swimming pool and spa areas! Can't wait to go back. Thank you Druids glen.",5,2016,11,18
238,Spa treat,Visited druids  Glen spa for a massage after  walking in Glenda lough . Fabulous  spa  staff very friendly  really  relaxing massage  . I've only one negative  comment after your treatments  you go to relax in relaxing area  ehivh is mentioned to be peaceful  but all the time staff are passing  through like spaghetti  junction to another room to get items  pity it takes  from the idea of relaxation. ,3,2016,11,17
238,Great hotel,Celebrated anniversary here. Staff are very friendly and really professional. Breakfast is great. Turn down service. Big fires everywhere and lots of seats in the lobby. A nice place to relax. Walk available through golf course. Very nice for getting in your daily steps. ,5,2016,11,17
238,Very enjoyable stay,I stayed here with my girlfriend and young girl (she was 1 at the time). There was no problem when we asked for a cot. The room was very big and really nice. The room had a DVD player which came in handy that night. I went to the gym which a really good. Had all that you need. It's probably one of the best hotel gyms that I have been to. The pool was great. There is times for kids which is good. The best part of the stay was the breakfast. What a spread!! It was unreal. And the staff were really nice and friendly.,5,2016,11,16
238,Romantic stay,"I stayed here with my husband for our anniversary and it did not disappoint.the hotel is lovely and the staff are amazing,so professional and lovely.the breakfast in the morning is the best I have ever had in any hotel,the range and quality were just next to none.i dined in Hugo's restaurant and it is lovely but if I stayed again I would definitely choose the bar restaurant instead,the food is nicer and the portions are much larger and it is a little cheaper. The spa was lovely,my treatment was meant to be only 55 mins but the girl kept me a good 70 mins,very professional and a real treat,the walks around the hotel are beautiful,I can't fault this hotel,I gave it 4 stars only because I am waiting for my 5 star hotel to come yet,I will stay here again in a heart beat and I can't say that about many places.it is also so child friendly,a great hotel for a family vacation",4,2016,11,15
238,Above and Beyond,"i would like to thank the staff at Druids Glen Resort for the service we received last weekend from start to finish. In particular the lovely receptionist Edel who checked us in and was so informative about the area and the amenities and really pleasant on our arrival, and the lovely Maeve (Limerick) from the restaurant who was an absolute pleasure and could not have done enough for us and gave great recommendations. Please can you pass on my thanks and i shall look forward to my next stay and i will certainly be advising family and friends of our experience we had at your resort.",5,2016,11,14
238,Graduation day,"attended my Granddaughters graduation day last Saturday evening. not too easy to find, and main roan into it is very narrow. hotel looked nice with all the festive decorations. friendly staff, bar definitely needs a good make over, not five star*? €7.50 for house wine expensive. poor seating leatherette in the bar area,  which was well torn and worn. we had complimentary food from the graduation, which was very acceptable, petit burger baps, spring rolls, and bought in Gougons  of chicken. 5* should be making their own gougons. buffet area well laid out, and plenty of space.  Nice hotel, and looked very festive, when we were leaving.",3,2016,11,13
238,Expensive and definitely not 5 star,"Went with a friend for a spa day and stayed overnight. We were sorry we stayed. The hotel looks like it has had better days and our room was miles away from reception. 

The cheapest wine, which is the house wine is €7.50 and barely palatable. Many wines by the glass are €11 plus. 

The food in the bar is very expensive and just mediocre. The cheese plate was like a selection of crackers and cheese from tesco and was ridiculously priced at over €13 given the poor quality. 

The staff were nice but the hotel was a seriously expensive let down.",1,2016,11,12
238,You've done it again!,"This is my second time to stay here and wow! - it just gets better and better. From the porter taking the case at the door, offering to park the car and hot towels at reception, the luxury and comfort begins. The hotel is very spacious, generous, inviting and everything is of an exceptionally high standard. Also, Hugo's restaurant is superb. (Been about 4 times and it is consistently good). However, what really amazed me was when we were checking out, the receptionist asked if we had plans for the day. We mentioned we were going to be looking after our two grandchildren in the afternoon. She then produced 4 bottles of water and two packs of colouring cards and crayons for us! It's the little things that make you such a great hotel. I could happily come back here again and again.",5,2016,11,12
238,Wonderful Stay,"We stayed at Druids Glen Hotel for a 2 night stay during the mid term break. We received the warmest welcome by Tadhg on arrival & were checked in by Aimee who couldn't have been more helpful. The room was gorgeous, the food delicious & the atmosphere relaxing. The kids loved the 'High Tea' which was great value for the hot buffet dinner, dessert and an evenings entertainment. The kids golf & swimming was great too. Overall a wonderful break. ",5,2016,11,11
238,Spa treatment with lunch,"An amazing experience once again from an all-access to the swimming pool, jacuzzi, sauna, steam room and plunge pool, to the relaxation room before and after our booked spa treatment to our lunch in The Thirteenth Bar. 

Spa treatment included brown sugar and coconut leg exfoliation, indulgent back, neck and shoulder massage, and eastern head massage. Such a lovely treat for our tired bodies! 

For lunch, I had duck leg confit, with pickled puy lentils and salad, and my friend had grilled mojo spiced chicken with chips and salad. My duck was falling off the bone and lentils were cooked perfectly. Both dishes tasted delicious!",5,2016,11,11
238,Beautiful place for a wedding,I attended a wedding here in early October - I've been to Druid's Glen twice before for another wedding and work do. I really like Druid's Glen - the rooms are so clean & beautifully designed and the room for drinks is lovely. The dinner was fab - the staff were friendly and the service was very good.,5,2016,11,10
238,"Only the staff are 5*, average place. ","Stayed here after purchasing a voucher. Probably should have just booked a room as it worked out the same but with limitations with the voucher on day of the week etc. The staff were very friendly and very professional. However this is not very 5* place, the food in the restaurant was so overpriced and completely average. The room was nice but the bathroom needed updating. There are lovely views around the hotel unfortunately we got a room with a courtyard view, despite the off peak season and day of the week. We've stayed in better 4 star places. ",2,2016,11,07
238,Luxury for all the family,"Stayed here again during mid-term break October 2016 with wife, son (7) and daughter (2). It was a fantastic luxury experience for all of the family. We will be back.

The service and attention to detail was first class and seemed effortless from the moment we arrived to the moment we departed. It is exactly what you should expect from a 5* Hotel. Kudos to the staff in particular for being so professional and making us feel very welcome. Given how busy the Hotel was it was remarkable how smooth everything was with no waiting for tables or queueing for breakfast etc ( tip is the bar gets busy after 1830, and breakfast gets busy after 0900). 

We ate in both the bar and restaurant, both had excellent service, atmosphere and great food. We were a little worried about the noisy kids in the restaurant but the staff were clearly very used to making families feel welcome.

There is a great indoor kids playroom that we spent hours in (loved the retro pac man)
!) a well equipped outdoor playground, it was possible to walk or cycle Hotel bicycles around the extensive grounds. The Kids Club was a winner with my 7 year old and our 2 year old loved the puppet shows. The lady that did the puppet shows and face painting was fantastic with the kids in particular.

Leisure facilities are first class and for runners there are great options for some outdoor training also. 

Overall, would highly recommend this Hotel, for families in particular. It comes at a price but I doubt anyone that had our experience would regret the spend.",5,2016,11,05
238,Very child friendly..,Staff were warm and friendly.  Food and wine was excellent. Kids club available from 5-9 which gave us parents a nice little break for dinner and a drink or two!!  Only negative was we waited an hour for our main course on our first night and some staff in the bar were just poor.  All in all a great couple of days...  recommend...,5,2016,11,05
238,If you are looking for a golf weekend then this is the place to go,"I have visited Druids Glen twice both on business and I have to say it is fabulous. I don't say that lightly as I stay in lots of great hotels but I keep my 5 dots only for something exceptional. Not only is it in a beautiful place, with great rooms and great food but the big thing is the staff and the attention to detail it makes staying there just a wonderful thing. OK the outside of the building could be more architecturally striking but the countryside more than makes up for it. The one down side which is always a gripe of mine is that you have to ask for baked beans at breakfast. Apart from that faultless.",5,2016,11,04
238,Amazing break ,"This hotel has to be one of the best I have stayed in in Ireland and we spend a lot off weekends away 
Staff so friendly kids club amazing and Breda there was so kind and friendly . Food top notch swimming pool spotless clean rooms also so well maintained really nice and bright. Playroom for children excellent from arcade games to dolls houses all ages catered for .
Sylvia and Shauna so professional and friendly in bar
Lots of activities where on during our stay girls where took to driving range for golf and also puppet show and face painting really recommend this hotel will defiantly be returning ",5,2016,11,03
238,Great location outside the city,"this is a great hotel as Marriotts are famous for, and well appointed.  great food and amenities.  Easy access to two great golf courses, one across the street. this hotel requires a vehicle for access to surrounding points of interest though as it is a bit secluded.  this is why I gave four stars instead of five.  five stars if you have a car.  Great restaurants in nearby villages.",4,2016,11,02
238,FLAWLESS FAMILY FUN :),"Amazing resort for kids, plenty to do over school holidays, we stayed Halloween night and they had face-painting, pumpkin carving, kids high tea club (5-9pm, €15 per child, dinner included :) ) movies etc. Swimming pool was a big hit too with Jacuzzi, steam room and sauna for the adults :) don't forget your swim caps though or they're €3 each to buy. We were very lucky our room was on the second floor just a couple doors up from health club entrance so very handy for just walking down the corridor in your robe and slippers to the pool!
We enjoyed lunch and dinner in the bar, both meals were gorgeous. They made us toasted sandwiches for lunch despite them not being on menu and kids shared a pizza which was huge. breakfast was gorgeous, very tasty and plenty of choice, omelettes made to order and little pancakes too.
We had a family room which had two double beds, they were comfy and very warm, we had to put the AC on in October!
The grounds of this hotel are gorgeous esp in autumn and we will definitely be returning, particularly in school holidays to make good use of kids activities.
We had a brilliant break and have been recommending to everyone! 
All staff went out of their way to assist in every part of the hotel, we were lucky to get our room at 2.30pm and the man on concierge was very helpful and great with our kids, he gave them their free halloween t-shirts and colouring pads, and helped them with hot chocolate at the front desk! 
well worth a visit, enjoy!",5,2016,11,02
238,Great stay for family weekend,"We thoroughly enjoyed our weekend here. Kids loved the pool, the food was delicious, but our highlight was our golf lesson with local pro Patrick Geraghty. Patrick knew how to motivate our teenage kids with positive feedback and simple practice tips and tricks. He has a great way to coach each family member according to their level of skill and engagement. Try it yourself! :-)",4,2016,11,02
238,excellent staff lovely rooms,the staff were really nice. we had a spacious comfortable room. there's an excellent walk on the grounds. great view from the balcony of the clubhouse. good options available for breakfast. the leisure centre is very pleasant.,5,2016,11,01
238,Lovely stay ,"We stayed 2 nights, this was our third time visiting. Had a slight problem with key card not working three times on the first afternoon. This was dealt with very well by Adrienne on reception. The food is exceptional, however, the service is lagging behind a little. In the 13th bar/restaurant waiter service needs to be more attentive and worthy of a 5 star level. Lots of staff & supervisors walking around but not always looking to see if customers are ok or if they need something. Nice relaxing atmosphere around the whole hotel which is great. 
High Tea for the kids is great, our two boys 6&7 loved it. The play park, putting green, driving range & bike hire are all very close to reception. A lovely walk around the grounds. Pool, spa & leisure facilities are top class. Rooms are beautiful & cleaned & maintained to very high level. Will definitely be back again next year. ",5,2016,11,01
238,Halloween family break,Overmoon with our interconnecting suites rooms 120 & 122 on first floor. So spacious for the 5 of us. Kind and helpful staff organised a pumpkin carving afternoon which we all enjoyed before we had lovely swim in the pool. We were delighted that we booked Hugo's for dinner our waiter was very attentive and informative. Steak and hake was delicious. Kids cleared their plates. Kids were overjoyed to choose dvds  from reception to watch in their beds while munching on butlers chocolates that staff had kindly left on their beds. Truly thankful to the night receptionist who provided us with a new bottle of calpol for our son who had leg cramps we all slept soundly after. Very impressed with huge selection provided at breakfast kids devoured freshly made pancakes. The omelette station is a must!! Thank you again for making it very special stay and we have booked again for after Christmas as a family treat!! ,5,2016,11,01
238,"Lovely, chilled stay","We stayed for one night in one of the very comfortable rooms at Druids Glen - the beds and linens are wonderful!  Staff, without exception, were friendly and welcoming.  Decor is lovely, and there is a nice track around the golf course for a run.",4,2016,11,01
238,"Peace, Quiet and great food.","You know when you go somewhere and just feel relaxed? Well this was how I felt when I visited Druids Glen Hotel. The place was lovely, the food terrific and the staff lovely.  We just visited for the day but I will definitely return for a longer stay.",5,2016,10,31
238,Check-in time is 4pm and early check-in impossible!!!,"I received an automated guest satisfaction survey this morning  which prompted me to take 5 minutes to tell you not about the quality of our stay, which was very satisfactory but the disappointment and disturbance a simple request for flexibility prior to our arrival caused us.
We experienced a very unsatisfactory approach to a simple request for an early check-in (1.30pm). This request was first made many weeks ago at the time of booking by telephone. The request arose because we were attending a wedding at 3 pm in nearby Trudder Lodge and my wife needed to know whether she could get ready on site . This request was denied! However, she was told it could be possible be on the day, but there was ""no guarantee"". A 4pm check-in time is the latest I have ever experienced in many years travelling the world and staying in many hotels. The reservations clerk made the suggestion of ""calling closer to the time”, very unsatisfactory in the circumstances when all you want is certainty of arrangement. My wife made another phone call to reservations a week before the arrival date. She received exactly the same attitude, just unhelpful; She felt this was  deliberately obstructive, making a mountain out of a simple, easy to accommodate, request. She needed to know whether she could get ready for the wedding on site or not. The repeated policy of saying there was ""no guarantee"" offered no certainty and was just ridiculous in the circumstance.
All of this created uncertainty that could have easily been avoided. It was totally unnecessary on the part of your staff. It showed no commercial judgement or presence of mind. What should have been an enjoyable 24 hour stay was made a source of anxiety and discomfort.
I find it pointless and contradictory to have exhaustive and in depth guest surveying for satisfaction levels across a business, if you can't allow staff to exercise tiny amounts of flexibility in the circumstances described, something that would have cost you nothing.",4,2016,10,31
238,Wonderful as always,"As always, we had a wonderful stay in Druids Glen, in a beautiful room with a spectacular view of the trees and the golf course. The staff here are always incredibly welcoming and go above and beyond to help.",5,2016,10,29
238,Five Star Luxury,"As we had stayed at this hotel in the past, on arrival we were offered a room upgrade at no extra cost because of the customer loyalty policy. The decor inside was of a very high standard and the staff did everything to ensure a relaxing stay. Food a particular delight.
Great location to tour the sighs from.",5,2016,10,28
238,Romantic night away,"5 star all round....

Booked via Groupon but not a budget hotel.

We had a bottle of Prosecco on ice awaiting our arrival in the room and when we came came back in the evening the bed was turned down with chocolates.

It was my 3rd time staying but played no golf this time as my wife doesn't play, both courses are championship courses perfectly manicured.",5,2016,10,27
238,Good hotel in Wicklow Mountains. Top golf course,"Many guests are here for golfing on one of Ireland's best known golf courses. Very convenient for a drive about the Wicklow Mountains and to Glenn da Lough. Bar is busy and  noisy, but there is a nice lounge (Pavilion) that is quiet and comfortable.Meals are also available in the room.  The main restaurant is very nicely situated and serves a first class menu with very good service. If the weather is favourable, there is a nice patio. All the hotel staff are cheery and helpful.  The hotel is fairly new and seems to be well-run.",5,2016,10,27
238,Peaceful break,"We really enjoyed our two night stay at Druids Glen. The facilities were great with a pool,gym and spa. We enjoyed the fog from the 13th restaurant but didn't eat in the main restaurant. The staff were very friendly and extremely helpful. There are two great golf courses although there are no tennis courts. Rooms were comfortable. The break was enjoyable and the hotel really peaceful .",4,2016,10,26
238,Beautiful but treacherous accessibility,"A truly lovely resort and setting but dangerously hard to get to if you are driving due to the lack of lighting at night and narrow curving roads. The rooms were lush with edifying pictures and soft bedding. The bathrooms were spacious and gorgeous. Their cuisine was satisfying though not extraordinary. The pub is small and not as quaint as it could be, but after a few pints you don't really care! :) Lovely waitstaff and terrific ambiance throughout. You will pay the price for the five star rating. On a less fortunate note: when the valet was packing our car to leave, he ripped my suitcase  along the seam making it unsuitable for future traveling. It was reported to the management who were apologetic but no restitution made. They did offer that if we should ever come back to the Druids they would upgrade our room. Umm, yeah.",4,2016,10,24
238,Extremely Average Dining experience ,"Myself and a friend decided to go for a scenic drive and lunch. We went into the 13th Bar for food, we sad at a dirty table for 20minutes. We finally received menus the glasses were moved off the table but it was never wiped down. We had to ask them too. We ordered food, it arrived in a timely fashion. We asked the waiter who brought the food for condiments and he rudely say 'I'll tell your waitress'. We then waited 5 minutes for them. Our food was enjoyable. We ordered a cream tea each. We paid €17 for two teas and 6 mini scones, we asked for butter which we never received. Over all I feel the hotel is trading on its former glory. It is understaffed and overpriced.  ",3,2016,10,22
238,Very pleasant hotel,"This is a modern hotel. The rooms are very spacious. The facilities are very good. There is an excellent swimming pool. The golf course is a major feature. Even if you don't play golf, the walks are very good. The pub is pleasant. It is not a country house style hotel. The rooms are very good size. ",4,2016,10,20
238,Great as always!,"Just returned from our latest stay and have to say that this place is just as good as always , we have been coming for approx 6 or 7 years for a few days at a time and we both remarked that it is always the same (very good) . Staff as always 1st class (thank you Silvana for your help with a speedy check in, and your constant smile). Rooms spacious and well appointed , food excellent. We did experience a bit of slow service in the bar on one night and also at breakfast the following morning when it felt that we had been forgotton about , we were seated in a corner area on this occasion. The following morning was much better, even though we had other diners seated quite close to us - which seemed unneccessary as ther were plenty of other free tables available (if we were seated after the others we would have requested to be seated elsewhere). Just a few minor issues we thought we would mention.",5,2016,10,19
238,One night stay,Grounds are amazing. Modern style hotel. Rooms and lobby very nice. Spacious bar and restaurant area. Good beers in draft and food tasty. Only negative is its relatively far (40min) to cab into Dublin. ,5,2016,10,19
238,Fantastic treat,We stayed here for a lovely luxury treat. The staff at reception and the concierge were very friendly. The room was very nice. Our door did stick a bit. We had a bottle of Prosecco in the room. We had an excellent meal in Hugos. The food was fabulous and the serving staff were excellent. The buffet breakfast next morning was great. We went for a hot stone massage and facial in the Spa. It was my first Spa treatment. We found it very relaxing. Checkout was very friendly and easy. It's obvious that the hotel ensure that the staff are pleasant and friendly. I even got a friendly greeting from a workman fixing a door. Overall it was a wonderful short break and we would love to return some day.,5,2016,10,18
238,Lovely stay,Modern hotel with very friendly staff and a nice ambience. The rooms and spacious and very comfortable. We ate in the bar and the food was good. I didn't play on the golf course but it looks fantastic. The spa is very nice as well but a little pricey as you would expect in a 5 star hotel. All in all a very nice stay and we will definitely be back again some day,5,2016,10,18
238,One night stay,"Stayed here for one night mid week. Hotel grounds are nice and rooms are lovely. The pool was very busy with kids and lessons happening, about 5pm. Also we were charged €3 each for swimming caps. You'd imagine with the cost to stay there caps would be complimentary. Breakfast was nice, egg station was great, omelettes made according to your preference but it was an extra €4 to have French toast which seems peculiar. Personally I didn't consider it the same standard as other five star hotels. ",4,2016,10,18
238,Never ever disappoints!,"After a shaky start when we were not initially given the type of room we thought we had booked (and which we always have), this was speedily sorted out and once again we had a lovely four nights in our favourite hotel!  As I have said before, the staff at Druids Glen are, without exception, simply wonderful  -  so welcoming, helpful and full of Irish hospitality!  It was lovely so see again a number of staff we have met on previous stays.  Our room with golf course views was exellent, breakfasts delicious and our meal in Hugo's fabulous.  It was my husband's birthday during our stay and the plate of sweets with chocolate piping of Happy Birthday in our room was a lovely touch.  Then again in Hugo's the candle in his ice cream, acccompanied by Maeve singing Happy Birthday made his day! A stay at Druids Glen would not be complete without doing the walk around the golf course, stopping off for a coffee and a Jameson's  on the terrace of the club house. Roll on next October!",5,2016,10,18
238,For a family occasion with kids!,"Located about 25km south of Dublin, off the M11, this is not the easiest place to find.  The resort complex includes two golf courses as well as the hotel and leisure complex. While the principal golf course is championship standard, this review focusses on the hotel and restaurant.  We were agroup of 15, 8 adults and 7 kids.  We had chosen the 'balcony' area as that gave us some privacy and prevented the noise disturbing other guest diners. The three course lunch for €32 was excellent with a good variety of choices for all three courses.  The service was low key and might be considered by some to be a little slow but for us it suited the occasion perfectly.",4,2016,10,14
238,AMAZING!,"Myself and my boyfriend stayed here last week. From the moment we arrived we loved it. The hot towels on arrival at reception, the particularly friendly hotel staff who greeted us (lovely girl at reception and great guy working on concierge who swiftly grabbed our bags and took them to our room while we had lunch). Lunch was tasty, we then got changed into our robes and headed for the spa, again the girls working in the spa were noticably friendly and helpful. We enjoyed our treatments and headed for the swimming pool. This was our only downfall of the hotel. The leisure area in particular was a little outdated. When we went to the pool/sauna it was just after our treatments so we were feeling extra relaxed, but there was kid's swimming lessons on in the pool so the instructor was shouting etc, when we decided to leave the pool area prematurely it happened to coinside with the end of lessons so the changing rooms were chocca block with kids. As much as there is no problem with this if its a general leisure centre, i think with such a nice spa etc it would be great for the leisure area to compliment the spa. A little more tranquility and ambience would go a long way. We then had dinner in Hugo's which was delicious, the food, the wine and the service was impecable. I'm particularly critical of service as I have hotel experience myself and I could not fault the guys, warm friendly banter on arrival and as the evening went on we felt like we had good conversation with both our waitress and waitor throughout different times of the night even though the restaurant was pretty busy. Overall, I can't really fault the place, I would just like to see a little more of a spa atmosphere in the leisure centre, but I couldn't believe how genuinely helpful and friendly the staff were! Big thumbs up!!",5,2016,10,13
238,Lovely family break,"This is the second mini break we have had here with our young family ( 2, 4 and 5 year olds).  Our children were so excited when they heard we were going back there this summer.  Warm and friendly reception from staff from the beginning to the end of our short break.  We had interconnecting rooms, which were immaculate and beautifully decorated.  Ideal location for exploring Wicklow, with Powerscourt, Sealife centre, Glenroe open farm, Glendalough, nice beaches all on the doorstep of the hotel.

Within the hotel the play park and playroom were brilliant for small children.  The pool had dedicated times for children, which was good for families and guests visiting without children.  Bathrobes were provided for the children as well.  The pool area and changing rooms were extremely hygienic.  Our kids loved the pool area.

We had a family bereavement whilst away and had to cut our trip short, the hotel staff we very kind, bringing tea to the room for us and milk and cookies for the children.  I thought this was very thoughtful.",5,2016,10,13
238,Pure luxury,"Just back from a beautiful trip to the Druids Glen , it was a beautiful experience, pure 5 star luxury. We were greeted by a beautiful girl at reception and check in was quick. I love the hot cloth touch at reception , this was definitely a first for me. Our room was Room 108 and it was just as I expected, spacious and again the attention to detail was faultless. A bottle of Prosecco was delivered to the room also. The bed was super comfortable and 'wow' those pillows were amazing.Breakfast was also amazing. We ate in the Bar for lunch and dinner, the food here was delicious, served quickly and piping hot. The staff here were brilliant. I would love to return to the Druids Glen again.",5,2016,10,11
238,Nice Place,"At the outset I would say that this establishment is not a cheep option. I have stayed in a lot of hotels over the years from the basic to superior and have always maintained that there is really no essential difference. To get a good mark in my book they all have to have a clean room, comfortable bed, ensuite facilities and a tasty breakfast in the morning. So if the ""basic"" hotel offers all these then were does the extra cost come from and is it justified. 
My conclusion is that it is all down to your state of mind at the time of staying. I wanted to have all the things I mentioned above plus a bit of positive stroking or feel good factor. Well this place gives it in shed loads from the booking in hot towels to the complimentary water on checking out. I would highly recommend the place, the rooms, the staff and the food. I will be back.",5,2016,10,10
238,1 night break ,Just back from a night away to druids glen and can't fault it - excellent service at reception / restaurant / and health club - the food in Hugo's was fantastic - top notch - the room was lovely - very spacious and clean - the only negative thing I could say was the health club is outdated - but overall - very nice break and  you know it's good when the minute you leave - you want to go back and we will - thanks to all at druids glen - ,5,2016,10,09
238,Interrupted luxury,I celebrated my birthday in company of my immediate family. We enjoyed the location and surrounding of the hotel. Service was efficient although not overly friendly. The food was good but I wouldn't rated as five stars....in fact the bar food was really enjoyable....more than the diner we had in the restaurant. However.....the peace and quite was abruptly interrupted by tons of children that suddenly arrived and took over the place. It is certainly a place where you should have a kids free zone as having children running and screaming in corridors and main lobby and relaxing areas is just not appropriated. Staff did not make a huge effort to control the situation. It is a pity that such a nice place can be spoilt due to lack of planning to minimise impact of noise.,4,2016,10,08
238,Love this place. ..,"Stayed for 3 nights on a deal (2 vouchers) which included a bottle of prosecco. ... credit on the spa and credit on the dining... the prosecco was lovely. (Didn't receive the 2nd bottle from the 2nd voucher).... I enquired about the dining credit as it hadn't been explained on check in. .. but this was only for Hugo's restaurant. .. as I was travelling on my own I didn't use the restaurant but ate in the bar. ... was disappointing that I couldn't use it there so I lost out in that also. .. and I didn't use the spa but that was my own choice. .

I really love Druids Glen... the food is super. ..the rooms are super and really decent size. .. and I wish my stay was longer. . The shower temp wasn't great this time around. ....on full hot but still lukewarm.. but in fairness that's just a minor issue. .. 
The staff are absolutely excellent across the board. .all so friendly.. special mention to Chris behind the bar. . Every hotel needs someone like this. . Helpful. .. happy. .. clearly likes what he does. .professional. .. very polite to the customers and overall makes the bar a relaxing place. .. as I was there on my own he made an effort to introduce himself and hold a conversation (during quite times of course!! ) but just overall I appreciated it.  Well done Chris!! 😊😊

My friend and I want to stay 5 nights over Xmas but unfortunately xmas day is booked out already. .. soooo disappointed. ...😔😔😔 

Anyway as always I loved it and will definitely be back soon. ... thanks Druids and the team for another lovely stay. ..",5,2016,10,06
238,2 night family stay for a wedding,"My wife and I stayed here on Friday 23rd Sept for 2 nights with our 2 kids (aged 11 and 13) for a family wedding.

Our welcome on arrival was excellent and the room was very nice with no issues at all. The room had 2 double beds and we were asked if we wanted another single brought in which they did promptly and it was also very comfortable.

Food was excellent but due to a lot of people at the bar we felt that service was a little slow. Prices for drinks very high.

Breakfast was very well thought out and prepared - made a nice change to see a gluten free section as well. As a coeliac this was very welcome! Gluten free toast no issue either.

The wedding dinner was fantastic!

Our kids enjoyed the pool table but didn't think much of the games room.

All in all this is a truly lovely hotel in very nice surroundings but we had one issue and that was the swimming pool. The wedding was on the Saturday afternoon so we thought we could take our kids for a nice swim in the morning. When we arrived at the pool we had to buy swim hats (I understand for hygiene reasons but never had to do this before) but found the changing facilities too small to accommodate the mass of parents and their kids. The pool was even worse - jam packed with very young kids with only 1 lane for adult swimmers which was then removed at 11am. At 12 midday we were asked politely to leave the pool as no children permitted after midday. bearing in mind my kids wanted to swim lengths and not splash like a 2 year old it wouldn't have harmed anyone to let them actually swim - especially as once we left there were only 2 adults left in the pool! The hotel should have made it perfectly clear that the pool would be crowded with very young kids. My wife didn't even want to set foot in the water because she new the changing facilities afterwards would be a nightmare. 

Apart from this we enjoyed our stay very much. 

We would definitely return if we went back to Ireland but would go to the driving range with the kids instead of the pool :)",4,2016,10,06
238,Wonderful shortbreak,"Can't fault our one night stay at all, I wish I had booked for longer!! My husband said the Druids Glen golf course certainly deserves it's championship status and thoroughly enjoyed his round of golf there. I had an exotic coconut body wrap in the spa and it was amazing. The staff were very friendly and professional in all parts of the hotel. We had dinner in the 13th Bar, which was very well presented. The breakfast was explained clearly to us and very enjoyable. I can't wait to return!!",5,2016,10,05
238,"Great hotel, fantastic golf, and superb staff","Room and  breakfast excellent, extremely friendly, and attentive staff. Golf courses very good,, with the star of the show being the Glens course, some very challenging holes, with a sprinkling of beautiful wild life, and fine picturesque Irish countryside.
We'll be back!!",5,2016,10,02
238,Wonderful!,"My husband and I stayed here with friends for 3 nights. It was a wonderful beginning to our first trip to Ireland. The room was large and overlooked the golf course. Breakfast was delicious as was the supper we had in the bar on our first night. The music every night in the bar was excellent.
Plenty of free parking too.",5,2016,10,01
238,Tranquil oasis in Wicklow,Great place to unwind and enjoy the good things in life. Staff friendly and food good. Proximity to DruidsGlen Golf club makes it the ideal place to stay to combine a challenging but exquisite golf course with some Spa and R&R. Highly recommended ,4,2016,10,01
238,Wonderful hotel and staff,"Visited the wonderful Druids Glen hotel with my husband and our friends who had stayed at the hotel previously. From the moment we arrived nothing was too much trouble, we were greeted warmly by the reception staff with warm towels and asked to go into the bar as our rooms weren't quite ready. As soon as they were they phoned us gave us our keys and advised that our bags and the men's golf clubs had already been placed in our rooms.
Rooms were lovely, large and very well appointed. The bathrooms had both a bath and walk in shower with nice toiletries. Large soft fluffy towels, my favourite thing, were changed every day. Dressing gowns and slippers provided. A lovely surprise to get back to our rooms each evening to turn down service, calm music playing and a chocolate on our pillow. We were also given a card and a box of chocolates thanking us for staying! 
We stayed five nights and through this time managed to sample most of the hotel amenities. Our husbands played golf on the Druids Glen course twice, we ate in the Thirteenth bar 3 times and managed to squeeze in a fantastic 'signature' treatment in the spa. If you get the chance though make sure you get out and about there are some lovely places to visit in this very pretty part of Ireland. 
I could go on about the great breakfast, evening meals and drinks but I think you get the gist, this really is a five star hotel. 
My only disappointment although our room was fantastic, our friends received an upgrade to a suite, I think as they'd been before,  and we had to put up with them gloating about it.  A small price to pay though. 
Will certainly return hopefully very soon. ",5,2016,10,01
238,Great place,"Overall, had a great time here on recent family stay.  The breakfast is superb, with an abundance of choices.  The facilities for small kids were great and the staff very friendly One issue arose with the babysitting service which is provided by a 3rd party service, although reflects badly on a family hotel . Having used the babysitters in other hotels, i thought it was excessive for the service to request you pay a once off cost of 20 to register before you could book a minder.  Most stays or short or once off.",4,2016,09,30
238,Relaxing break ,"We stayed for one night. Neither of us is into golf but that didn't matter. With the lovely long private walk through the woods and along streams and a very auiet, well equipped pool/sauna/jacuzzi/steam room area there is plenty to do. We had dinner in the bar, which was absolutely gorgeous and reasonably priced. Attentive staff and great service. Highly recommended!",5,2016,09,30
238,Awesome place I felt spoilt.  ,"Stunning place, the room was great as was the welcome, breakfast and the bar.   
We went for a family wedding which was held locally, lots of people stayed here and socially it was ideal.  We were welcomed beautifully and looked after superbly.  Breakfast was a joy and Kevin looked after us brilliantly.   
One of our party couldn't get into his room at 4am but the front desk persuaded him quite quickly that shouting and banging wasn't the way in, thankyou guys.   
Would love to go back and have a look round the area.  ",5,2016,09,30
238,5 star,"Everything about this place is five star. From the moment we left the car we were greeted at the front door. The reception staff were extremely welcoming and helpful. The room was big with a very large bed which was like sleeping on a cloud. Of course not to forget the extras that come with being a five star like hot towels on arrival, bathrobe and slippers, seventy or so channels on the fifty inch TV, and that's just to mention a few. All staff are at your disposal for anything you need, all you have to do is ask. As we had other arrangements for dinner we only had breakfast at the resort. Yet again we were treated like royalty. All foods were cooked to perfection and presented elegantly, from fresh fruits and yogurt to a full selection of breads and pastries to juices and beverages. A rack of honeycomb to use atop your breads or porridge. A full selection of Irish breakfast was available but it is hard to pass an omelette that is made in front of you with a filling of your choice. 
Sad to leave this little slice of heaven. Can't wait to go back again.",5,2016,09,29
238,Friends wedding,"Had a great time at this hotel for my friends wedding. Food was excellent and staff very friendly. Stephen in particular made sure our drinks never got too low during dinner. 

Breakfast the next morning was the best I ever had. Eggs cooked fresh whichever way you pleased along with a great fry, fresh fruit and a selection of cold meats. You overlooked the golf course while eating. Very nice surroundings.",5,2016,09,28
238,Hen Do - Spoil yourselves!,"What a great time! We decided to have a hen party in a fancy hotel. We arrived earlier to decorate the Hen's bedroom which the staff allowed. The rooms were big and clean. We arranged for champagne & chocolates to be delivered to the hen's room.
We used the spa facilities when we got there. The steam room, jacuzzi & pool were not too far away.
The restaurant we chose to eat was the Woodstock House. This is over by the golfing part of the grounds. The hotel dropped us over and picked us up. Food was gorgeous - was absolutely stuffed! The staff couldn't have been nicer :)
We had breakfast the next morning which we had plenty of choice.",5,2016,09,27
238,Absolutely Fabulous 5* Hotel and Golf,"72 of us had the pleasure of staying and golfing here for an inter club ""Ryder Cup"" match over 4 days between Coxmoor GC and Sherwood Forest GC both from the Robin Hood County of Nottinghamshire. The 3 golf courses we played were great with Druids Glen standing out and being a real test, all the courses were well manicured and the greens a challenge. Some of us made use of the pool and it's amenities and others the gym, and one or two the Spa. The hotel is a true 5* and the staff are beyond excellence. Hats off to everyone there and look forward to returning.",5,2016,09,26
238,Peaceful,"Stayed here for our anniversary, staff were amazing, big shout out to Ali in restaurant, food was lovely if a bit pricey, room spotlessly clean, fair play to the housekeeping staff as the whole of the hotel was the same. Only one thing while sitting in the restaurant beautiful as it is outside the cobwebs were noticeable because the lighting showed them up big time, again that's the only thing and not a big deal, would stay again and highly recommended this hotel",4,2016,09,26
238,Wedding Anniversary ,Checked into the hotel an hour early asked for a wee touch of romance in the room for my wife and BOY did the staff did NOT disappoint her 👍😆  If you want CHILLED.COM this is the place for you and your better half.  Really can't fault the experience so far.  Just finished a lovely Romantic meal for two in Hugo's Restaurant and to say it was FABULOUS doesn't do it justice.  I totally recommend this hotel and the staff are  5🌟 so friendly and helpful.  I will DEFINITELY be back for next year's 18th Anniversary LOVE this place. 💗👍❤😆 ,5,2016,09,25
238,Very classy hotel in a very beautiful setting,"After a long overnight flight and a rather hair-raising drive on the left, down winding, narrow lanes, the warm flannels on arrival were very welcome! The rooms are extremely comfortable, spacious with very high ceilings and with lovely pastoral views. The gardens and grounds were amazing and my husband enjoyed the golf. Breakfast is included and had a great variety of hot and cold choices. The staff were very helpful, professional and friendly. Little extras like chocolates and shortbread at turndown felt luxurious. We stayed 4 nights and  ate dinner in the restaurant, which was excellent as well as attended a wedding reception which was fabulous.  Pool and gym were also excellent.  Fantastic stay!",5,2016,09,25
238,An anniversary gift ,"We got my mam and dad a two night stay, one evening meal , two massages and a bottle of champagne and chocolate strawberries on arrival for there 30th wedding anniversary. It was a present from all the kids to my mam and dad. And we paid for the whole thing before they went down cause we didn't want them to know how much we paid for it. But during there stay they charged a few things to the room which was grand. But when they went to pay there bill the lady showed them the bill we had already paid. Instead of keeping it separate! I have no idea why she would have the need to show my mam and dad. My mam and dad found out how much we paid which none of us want them to know !!! And we were really upset over this because we all paid a lot of money. My mam and dad did have a good time but this has just annoyed all of us! ",2,2016,09,23
238,Stunning ,"Visit to mark s special occasion and couldn't have went better, which was down to the staff. Stunning setting with some beautiful attention to detail in the bedrooms. Fix was marvellous as one would expect. Will be back someday soon!",5,2016,09,23
238,Simply incredible,"My wife and I travelled here with our 5 month old baby girl. I have travelled a lot of the world and spent loads of time in 5 star hotels, this goes the extra mile from the food, cocktail list, overall comfort and accommodation for our little baby girl. The staff were fantastic! The room and grounds were so beautiful no review would do it justice. We had some very minor car troubles on the way in and the hotel staff could not have been more helpful and supportive. If this hotel gets 5 stars, their HR manager deserves 6. 
Dont miss this place, it's unbelievable and will be an experience you wont forget. We only stayed for 1 night and upon leaving felt like we had an indulgent getaway. If only we had more time in Ireland and wonderful Wicklow. ",5,2016,09,22
238,Ideal family getaway,"We had a 2 night stay here as a family. On arrival we were made very welcome indeed. The staff made a special effort to welcome the children which was a nice touch. The rooms were spacious,light and spotless. The food was delicious. The younger  children enjoyed the  kids play areas both indoor and outside. Our older son enjoyed the driving range. All in all an excellent hotel with great staff.",5,2016,09,22
238,Flawless 5 Star Stay,"Stayed here Monday night with my boyfriend for my birthday and I am still on a high from how great our stay was! Check in was lovely the receptionists were so welcoming and warm and provided lovely warm towels which really enhanced our arrival experience. I had a wonderful suite overlooking the golf course and the bed was nice and spacious and the bathroom amenities are very luxurious. The shower had lovely pressure also. We had my birthday dinner in Hugo's and this has been the best dining experience I have ever received in my life!! Ali was our waiter and to say he is amazing is an understatement! He explained the menu very well and made us feel so special and took great care of us, made sure our drinks were always refilled and we enjoyed chatting to him. Breakfast the next day was also lovely. The restaurant is beautiful overlooking the golf course and the sun shining in was just fab. I happened to meet the Director of Operations , Ivan, at breakfast and I told him how wonderful our stay was and really everything in Druids Glen is just flawless. The spa is also great the aroma steam room had me feeling fab and so relaxed and my skin is still feeling great. The guest relations manager checked me out and she is also a lovely lady, really I was sad to be leaving. Thank you so much to everyone in Druids Glen for taking great care of us I will always remember this lovely stay ",5,2016,09,22
238,Mixed feelings but def more pro's than cons,"Just back from a 2 night midweek stay at the druids with my husband and 14 montb old . I'll start with what I wasn't keen on and end on a positive note.  OK so when I rang reservations to query a few things before I arrived i felt a bit like the girl was trying to rush me off the phone and to stop bothering her with questions. She said I could manage my booking online which I never quite worked out! But all was good because the hotel was quite quiet in the end anyways . 
I found the spa a big let down. I got a treatment done which was l lovely but I booked a 55 minuite treatment and I ended after 50 .I know it's only 5 mins but between getting all settled on the bed and waiting for the therapist to come back in it was probably all in all about 45 mins. When your paying that much you expect that and maybe a few mins more to tide over delays and preparation of the treatment . Also before I got to the treatment I rang from the room 3 times and no1 answered (wanted to confirm app) I ended up ringing the main reception and asking them to ask for me. But I didn't hear back so I ended up walking to the spa to find out . Then after my treatment I realised I forgot an item so again I rang but  no reply .so Went down again  and I couldn't get one member of staff at reception or in their staff room. I ended up wandering around diff rooms checking where my item was and I finally found it at reception behind the desk. 
Then on to the pool .I was quite surprised there was no kiddy pool I had my 14 month old with me and the pool just didn't suit her at all. She was quite cold in it for a start and then she couldn't be let down because everywhere was too deep. 
Our room was l nice but the beds were rather hollow in the middle . We had 2 doubles in it and both were the same.me and my husband ended up in separate beds because the most comfortable part was the middle of them! 
Another thing was we were told about the lovely walk we could do around the golf course but when we got down there it said no buggies and there was no way we were bringing a 1 year old on foot. Really and truly there was no point telling us about it when we could nt even do it .
On to the pros  the outdoor and the indoor play areas were great for the little one .
The hotel itself was spotless 
We ate in the bar both nights which was nice but both nights the wrong dish was brought out but it was quickly rectified but for a 5 star hotel you kind of expect diff . 
The breakfast was fab .really enjoyed that both mornings and the staff were lovely . 
Would I stay here again I'm not sure .but I did have a nice break it just didn't live up to my expectations unfortunately. 
",3,2016,09,21
238,Lovely Getaway,"I've stayed in the druids glens hotel twice in the last year and both trips exceedes expectations! Our first stay was for my birthday back in November and from the moment we drove into the resort it was clear we were in a luxurious 5 star resort. A big, free car park make its easy to find a space. We arrived late and it was winter so it was dark. Outside the entrance there were trees all lit up with elegant lights, I thought they were christmas decorations but was pleasantly surprised when they were still there when i returned in May. 
In November we were greated by an extremely friendly staff member at reception when we were checking in. She gave us a hot towel to refresh with was lovely as it was cold outside! Our bags were also brought to the room for us even though it wasnt far from reception, which was very helpful. The rooms we had on both trips were spectacular with super comfortable beds, big TVs, and great showers. Both slightly different but equally comfortable, modern and beautifully decorated. 
Breakfast at the Druids Glen is by far the nicest breakfast we have had during a hotel stay. They have a great variety of food to suit every guest. All of the food is fresh and hot as they are cooking throughout breakfast so even if your late to breakfast (finishes at 11) there's still plenty of great food. 
The surroundings of the Druids Glen are beyond beautiful! On our November trip it was raining so we never got to explore the grounds or go on the recommended nature trail given at reception during check in. This was one of our many reasons for returning in May and it was well worth it. We explored the whole resort and the gardeners who keep the grounds so amazing should be proud! The walk is about an hour or so and shouldn't be missed. 
Druids Glen is my favourite Irish hotel and I can't wait for another luxurious visit again for my birthday this year.",5,2016,09,21
238,The best hotel for miles around,"Big room, excellent bed and fine amenities.  An excellent pool and Hugo's restaurant was better than I expected.  Excellent breakfast buffet with lots of fruit.  But it's full of golfers who hold it back from a real five star rating.",4,2016,09,20
238,Wow What an amazing stay.,"Stayed here for a night while attending a weeding.
Just to start we were created at the main entrance and helped with our bags and at reception given a hot towel to freshen up and the staff were so friendly.
Straight away you can see the high standards the staff set and the hotel have and they do not disappoint. 
Rooms were so spacious and were decorated and presented to a very high standard.
Everything a family cold want and then some.
The rest of the stay only got better.Bar is brilliant service is great and bar food is fantastic.Again no matter what you needed there was always a staff member there to help no matter how small.
The words just wouldn't do the visit justice.The small things that the staff do for you is so amazing.Just makes the visit so relaxing.
All i can say is go visit and see for you self.
An amazing experience and i would like to thank all the staff.",5,2016,09,19
238,"Beautiful, Welcoming, Relaxing, Superb Food","A little break away for our 1st wedding anniversary and I must say we def made the right choice of hotel to celebrate.  When we arrived at Druids Glen it was such a warm welcoming atmosphere.. it is such a beautiful hotel with fab grounds and any staff we spoke to were so friendly and helpful and so good at their jobs, they are a credit to you.  Warm handtowels on arrival and bottled water on departure were such lovely surprises. Our room was just wow.. an executive room which has a spacious living area, balcony, air conditioning, coffee machine and a bed you sink into and dont want to leave.  Turn down service was such a lovely surprise also.  We dined in Hugo's restaurant and the food is superb, we got the dessert for two and they took the time to put ""Happy Anniversary"" on the plate.. I just love all the extra things the hotel does to make your stay extra enjoyable.  A great selection at breakfast and we really enjoyed the pancakes.  We had an amazing time here and will definitely return in the near future. I would highly recommend Druid's Glen for a romantic break. It is definitely one of the nicest hotel we've ever stayed in.  Keep up the great work guys.",5,2016,09,18
238,Golf trip,"We went and stayed there in August as 16 golfers. The hotel is 5 star quality. Single rooms could house a family!!!!! The rooms are massive, clean and the bathrooms are to a high standard. The restaurant is definitely worth a visit, excellent choice on the menu. We had a table booked for 8.30 and was late arriving, reception couldn't be more helpful and was accommodating in putting the time back to 9.30 enabling us to get into the rooms and settle. It is the one of the best hotels I've stayed in. For all future golf trips to Ireland I will be basing it on staying at Druids Glen.
Give yourself a pat on the back, you all deserve it.",5,2016,09,18
238,Perfect hotel in every way,We stayed here for 2 nights booked rooms next door for ourselves and elderly father. The rooms were deluxe and very spacious. Hotel is immaculate. The staff are brilliant can't do enough for you. Breakfast was amazing plenty of choice. Can't praise this hotel enough. From start to finish we had a fantastic time and are looking forward to coming back again soon. ,5,2016,09,17
238,Delightful hotel in beautiful location nothing lacking.,"A modern, delightfully located, well designed and  beautifully appointed hotel very well worth its fifth star. Hugo's restaurant good, service very pleasant maybe a tad slow. Hotel staff very efficient. Stayed 2 nights with party of 9 - altogether a very pleasant experience even for non golfers.",5,2016,09,17
238,Too busy,"Maybe we stayed the wrong weekend as it was a bank holiday weekend but we found the hotel to be so busy it was impossible to relax. We ate in the restaurant our second night and found the food ok. We couldn't get a seat in the bar it was that busy the Saturday night and had to sit elsewhere. The rooms are lovely, nice and big and comfortable, we had a room looking out over the golf course. We had a good breakfast each morning , plenty of options.",3,2016,09,13
238,Spa break,"Brilliant hotel. Staff went out of their way to help and had a lovely few days.
Spa was also excellent and girls were so nice and pleasant.
Restaurant was amazing and waitor was so nice, he showed us a map and gave us tips on were to travel to in Wicklow.
Would definately visit again.",5,2016,09,13
238,Great service shame about the kitchen ,"My wife and I decided to have dinner in the hotel restauraunt - after booking into Druids Glenn for a quick night away...
I ordered the consommé and slow roasted loin of lamb with a pink cutlet my wife ordered the scollops and lamb - consommé was mediocre - scollops were good - lamb was sent out but missing ""slow roasted loin"" instead an extra cutlet was added to fill the plate - I pointed this out to the waitress who apologised and told kitchen - she then returned to tell me the chef was cooking some more and apologised - 5 minutes later 3 more rare cutlets appeared - I pointed out to the Manageress that these were cutlets and definitely not slow roasted loin- she thanked me for my comments and said that they would take everything thing on board for future customers....only for the intervention of the superb waitress who had the good grace to apologise properly - I might have blown a gasket - I feel sorry for the poor front of house staff who clearly have to bear the brunt of an incompetent chef - who attempts to fool the customers - I was clearly not alone this evening as I witnessed the lamb returned by several other tables - service 5 stars food 1 star",3,2016,09,09
238,Fantastic modern family hotel!,"We have stayed in a lot of 4/5 star hotels over the years with our daughter and I have to say this is certainly one of the best! We were here for two nights midweek in early August, myself, my husband, our daughter and baby son. Upon checking in we were offered fresh towels to freshen up and homemade lemonade...a lovely touch! We booked a family room but I believe we were upgraded to the superior family room (it was our wedding anniversary). The room was very spacious with plenty of room for the three of us plus the pram and all a baby entails!! Bathroom was big with bath plus a shower, room also had mini fridge which was great for bottles. It even had fluffy robes for the children!! 
We availed of the complimentary bikes on day 2 and did the walk around the grounds which was fab. The pool is lovely and my husband advises me the golf course is a very good one! Breakfast was very good, plenty of variety and the staff were so helpful placing us in a quieter area (with pram). The staff throughout our stay were very friendly and helpful it has to be said.  We had afternoon tea which was also very good but we didn't eat in restaurant as we went to Greystones both nights.
I must mention the little kitchenette it had on second floor, there was a steriliser, sink area, microwave etc along with some nappies, wipes etc presumably if you were in need. This was great addition when travelling with a little one and much appreciated! There seemed to be plenty on offer with the kids club, our daughter was too old for this but it seemed to have plenty on offer.
Overall an excellent hotel and we will certainly be back!",5,2016,09,07
238,Wish we could have stayed longer!,"We went here for our friends wedding in August and the place is fabulous. It's too bad we couldn't have stayed longer to really enjoy the stay as we were at a wedding we didn't walk around the grounds or really get to relax in the room! 

The rooms are immaculate, they take so much care of the place that it literally looks like it was built yesterday. There is not a scratch, a scuff or a dent anywhere that I could see and I always have a habit of finding these things when we're away staying somewhere. 

It is pricy but I think it is well worth it. The food that was served was delicious, the ice cream that they had at the reception was a nice touch and fab (the strawberry in particular.. where do you get your ice cream!?!?)

The service was very good. Everyone was super nice and the breakfast - wowsas. Really good - I would put this on par with the Spencer Hotel which does a fab breakfast as well. The two best breakfasts I've ever had in a hotel ever!

The pool area is very clean. I have to say the steam room is a bit meh - only because there is a crack at the bottom of the door and perhaps this does not allow it to get that hot in my experience but other than that everything was very clean and well taken care of!

I would like to head back sometime soon, perhaps even next summer to get a chance to really enjoy what the hotel has to offer!!!",5,2016,09,07
238,great hotel for a wedding,"I really liked this hotel - it has an excellent set up for weddings 
The food and accommodations are excellent

The rooms themselves are a bit on the bland side to make it a destination hotel but the grounds are excellent",4,2016,09,07
238,Great hotel ,"We stayed here for 2 nights , booked inter connecting deluxe rooms , the rooms are very spacious and really nice decor. Staff are great, can't do enough for you. Kids loved the pool , would prefer a separate pool for kids. 2 playgrounds - Outside one is good , playroom inside not really equipped for girls aged 5. Breakfast is great , pub food was good.",5,2016,09,06
238,Nice Hotel ,Very nice Hotel with excellent food. Top equipped bar - lots of beer and spirits and nice Hotel rooms. I really liked salmon as starter and monkfish plus vegetables as maincourse. Tidy rooms and good organised hotel.  I love it. ,4,2016,09,05
238,Intimate Wedding ,"My sister and her husband decided to have a very intimate Wedding and chose Druids Glen Hotel as their setting. I cannot compliment their choice enough. From the moment we stepped foot into the hotel the day before the wedding we were treated as royalty. Every single member of staff went above and beyond to make us comfortable and welcome. I don't know if there are words enough to recommend this hotel. The Spa,  the pool, the rooms, the food, the grounds, the staff.... wow. And Patrick, what a man. We will definitely be back. Thank you all so much for a fantastic 3 days.",5,2016,09,04
238,Excellent Hotel with exceptional staff,Hi had the pleasure of staying and golfing here for a corporate outing. Golf course was great and the hotel is beautiful but the staff are beyond excellent. Hats off to everyone there and I look forward to returning. ,5,2016,09,03
238,Fabulous hotel ,"We stayed in this hotel for one night and absolutely loved it, the food in the restaurant was amazing and the staff were extremely friendly especially Samuel in the bar and Alwyn in the restaurant! We will definitely be returning again. ",5,2016,09,02
238,"If you have kids, stay here!! 💕","Myself my husband and our two children are just back from a wonderful two nights stay at Druids glen, what a fantastic kid friendly hotel! It's often difficult to find a hotel that both mammy and daddy and the kids will love but this is it!!! The staff are exceptional, I have never seen a hotel where every single member of staff was so courteous, engaging, friendly and helpful I was just flabbergasted at the level of customer service. They were so lovely to our kids, the concierge had their names off straight away and gave them so much attention each time we went through the foyer. The room itself was lovely, clean and spacious enough for a crawling baby! The indoor playroom is suitable for babies, toddlers and older children, playground outside is very impressive, child friendly swimming times, lemonade on arrival, ice cream cart, kids dressing gowns, DVD library each night, golf clubs for kids to use at the driving range really just made the holiday for the kids! And a fully equipped kitchenette with everything from a steriliser to spare nappies and baby food was just an unreal amenity for any parent travelling with a baby! Clearly this hotel works to foster relationships with those who stay and they do this so well we had such a fantastic relaxing family holiday I am literally checking dates for when We can return!",5,2016,08,31
238,Very impressive ,"Fantastic spacious rooms,great wifi, comfortable beds and a great driving range. We found the hotel staff very insightful and understanding. The pool is great and so is the gym however I would recommend going to the pool in the evening or early morning as it does get quite full. However we did think that it was a bit cheeky of them to make us pay extra for breakfast. P.S look at the driving range it's great!

",4,2016,08,31
238,"Superb hotel with excellent staff, food and facilities.","We're a family of four (children aged 12 and 8). The Druids Glen resort was simply superb. The food is delicious (loved the seafood chowder). The staff are attentative, friendly and professional, in particular Ken and Shauna (Wales). The pool was fantastic for the kids. Shallow enough for them to stand and loungers for me to read my book! I would stay here again in a flash. A seamlessly smoothly run hotel where nothing was too much trouble. Thank you for a wonderful holiday.",5,2016,08,31
238,Perfect in every way,"We recently got married and held our reception in Druids Glen! We could not have picked a better hotel to hold our wedding party. All our guests were so complimentary about the hotel! 
Nessa was a dream to work with and helped us to plan and prepare our wedding in the hotel. Each time we went to meet with her she was only too delighted to meet with us, always kindly offering us a beverage and biscuit. She was spot on with every detail for our special day! The day just flowed so well for us as we were escorted from place to place seamlessly. 
The food was absolutely delicious. My husband commented on how much he enjoyed our wedding meal- friends of his said that he wouldn't enjoy it because of wedding day nerves! It was even better than at the tasting- which was amazing!!! Compliments to the chef and his team. All the staff were so attentive and helpful throughout our day! 
I must say that the bridal suite was absolutely gorgeous. I could fit into it even in my colossal gown!! Lol!! The bed was so comfortable and we slept so well. Unfortiunately it was a windy night and the whistling coming down from the chimney did stir us from our slumber a few times. However, it was so beautiful and clean with the most amazing views of the gardens. We also were given a lovely bottle of Champagne to enjoy- thank you! We stayed a second night and were moved to another beautiful suite offering different views!! We were very impressed as we thought we would be given a standard room!! All our luggage was moved for us and they even hung up my sad looking wedding dress!! This room was just as beautiful as the last and we had to show it off to our families who were suitably impressed. We sat in the comfortable lounge area that night and chatted about the lovely weekend we had. 
The bathrooms in both suites were exquisite with gorgeous L'occitane products which smelled beautiful. A real treat. 
We also made use of the pool facilities the day after the wedding. There were a few families playing about but there was lots of room for us to relax in the pool, jacuzzi and sauna. We ate a delicious lunch in the bar that day too. We ordered individual sandwiched but we were told after that it wouldnt be possible to make them. They offered to bring a selection of sandwiches instead! This worked out so much better and there was even too much food for us all to eat (2 large families). That evening we ate a meal in the bar and everyone commented about how the food is always to such a high standard. 
We are so grateful for all that Druids Glen did for us in the preparation, during and after our wedding to make us feel so comfortable and welcome in your hotel! 
Thank you very much, Owen and Nadia Campbell",5,2016,08,30
238,Weekend getaway,"We were blown away by the service of the hotel. I emailed before hand to mention it was our anniversary - they gave us a complementary upgrade to a suite which was very nice touch (also a box of butlers chocolates). I also emailed the hotel before hand to make a booking at the Hugos restaurant. We have a very specific diet, the chef nailed it and we got a nicely presented, tasty meal - hats off to the chef. Breakfast we good. We didn't have very much interaction with the staff during our stay, but whenever we did the staff were nice and polite - however when we arrived the doorman parked my car (and returned it when we left) and took our suitcases to the room (although what you would expect from a 5*). This is a family friendly hotel, so may not be for those who are looking for a romantic, children free escape - however we didn't have much of an issues and went to the pool during the children free times. The surrounding area is o.k, bit of a construction site in places - but if you have a car, you can drive 20 mins to some of the most beautiful sights.

All in all - got what we expected from a 5* but the upgrade and the meal made the hotel stand out. Will come back next summer !",5,2016,08,30
238,Would recommend! ,"Stayed for two nights in the beginning of August and was very impressed. As I was celebrating a birthday my boyfriend had called ahead to order prosecco and strawberries and flowers. Upon check in we realised our room had been upgraded free of charge and we were not charged for the prosecco. Room and grounds were beautiful. Staff at reception were incredibly helpful and friendly throughout our stay. 
We ate at the bar both nights, food was satisfactory however the service was messy. There didn't seem to be anybody in charge of the floor either night which resulted in a poor standard of service but perhaps we were more aware of this as we both work in the industry. Have recommended this hotel to friends who have since stayed and loved it too! ",4,2016,08,29
238,Excellent for a weekend getaway,"We have stayed in the druid's Glen a number of times and we keep coming back - need I say more?
Super-friendly and efficient staff. Beautifully appointed rooms. Great spa. Fabulous food.
Perfect for a 24 hour or 48 hour romantic getaway.

Particular highlights for us have been the dinner in the main restaurant - fabulous seasonal local produce and delicious wines. Also the spa is good value for treatments (you should definitely book in advance) and even just for flopping around in the pool, steam room and jacuzzi.

The breakfast downstairs tends to be quite packed and noisy, no matter what time you go, so if you want to continue your peace-and-quiet theme, I'd recommend spending the couple of Euros for the room service option.

On one visit, we had kids running in the corridor outside our room, but we made sure to ask for a quiet end of the hotel on subsequent visits.

Highly recommended.",4,2016,08,26
238,Romantic night away,"My husband and I booked a night at the Druid Glen whilst the grandparents looked after the kids. From the moment we arrived until the time we left, everything was 5*. We'd booked a dinner, bed and breakfast package. 

Our room was very comfortable, and overlooked a courtyard close to the swimming pool. 

We had drinks on the terrace at the Thirteenth Bar, overlooking the 13th hole of the Druids Glen golf course, before our dinner. Drinks aren't cheap, but the setting is lovely. Inside was very cosy for when the weather's not so good.

Our meal in Hugo's was delicious. Service was attentive and professional, and the food was very good. We liked that they kept couples separate from families, so it felt very romantic. 

Breakfast the next morning was also served in Hugo's. Lots of choice of good quality food. The honeycomb was my favourite... Yum, yum! 

We decided to walk around the Glen Druid golf course after breakfast. There's a designated walking route, which is well marked. It's 4km each direction and takes you to the Clubhouse where you can grab a drink before you head back again the same way. Luckily we managed to hitch a lift back in the hotel's shuttle bus as we're not used to walking that far! 

We had a lovely stay and would definitely return, preferring it to the nearby Powercourt Hotel. ",5,2016,08,26
238,Slipping standards,"I'm at the end of a week's stay here. It's my third visit, I was here at Easter and in August last year.  Loved this place but I feel standards have slipped.  Staff are lovely..especially Emily at breakfast.  However, this hotel is five star and I've noticed this visit hasn't been up to standard.  One day from room still hadn't been serviced by 3.30pm! Also on three separate occasions toilet roll wasn't topped up and I would have to ring reception. Biscuits for tea and coffee weren't topped up for three days as apparently they ran out,  now these sound like minor details but this is five star.  Also the 13th bar..well everytime we went for dinner we had to sit at an uncleaned table, I appreciate they were busy but we weren't going to eat until 9.30pm so we could avoid children a bit and at that time there were always spare tables, all of them needing clear down.  I'm not blaming the staff because as I've said they are wonderful, but they obviously need more staff occasionally.  So to sum up it's a lovely hotel with amazing staff but I think it's more 4 star at present",4,2016,08,26
238,Excellent hotel with outstanding service,"The Hotel is excellent, the location a dream and the staff is outstanding, friendly, helpful and whenever you need someone there is someone. The rooms are huge and more than clean, the restaurants serve an excellent meal, especially the meat is great. For golfers the location is a must!",5,2016,08,24
238,NOT a five star experience!,"This is not a luxury hotel or a five star experience.  The biggest problem with this hotel is that they oversell and under deliver. It's true, the staff is warm and welcoming but that's where it ends.  Don't expect much in the way of local knowledge from the front desk (a concierge is nowhere to be found).  In the informal restaurant/bar you will have to wait an inordinate amount of time to be served and you'll be lucky if your dishes are cleared at the end the of meal. The hotel is chaotic, noisy and in no way refined. There are kids running around the lobby and throwing paper airplanes in the bar.  Don't get me wrong, I like kids (I've got two of my own) but decorum isn't encouraged here.  And to make matters worse, it is rough around the edges (e.g., rusty drain in the shower, missing light bulbs in the bar, etc.).  I am fortunate to have stayed in many five star hotels in my day and the Druids Glen doesn't even come close to making the cut.",2,2016,08,24
238,Fantastic family reunion!,"Utterly bowled over by the fantastic service we received last weekend.

We had a family reunion of the entire extended family ranging in age from 2 to 85 years old and they all had a brilliant time. 

My parents are still on a high.
Food was excellent from breakfast to dinner – Hugos in particular was fab - amazing beef!
The rooms were beautifully comfortable and spotless – great beds!

The service all the way was brilliant - from the young guy who brought up our luggage to the reception staff and the restaurant & bar staff.

I do need to especially mention Loic who really made my folks' evening on Saturday night (ably assisted by Tomasz). It was such a nice touch bringing out the cake with the message for them.

The ambience of the whole place was so relaxed. This was despite having 2 or maybe 3 weddings on at the weekend as well!

It’s rare for a hotel to get things so right and you really deserve to be complimented.

We’ll definitely be back",5,2016,08,24
238,Fabulous weekend,"Beautiful location, hotel and food. Lovely golf course if you like golf otherwise some really lovely walks. Great for all the family. If a couple excellent spa and pool facilities. Excellent selection of treatments. Great variety of food in bar or restaurant. Highly recommend.",5,2016,08,23
238,An Anniversary Celebration,"Our decision to treat ourselves to a stay in a top class hotel proved so successful that we all want to return as soon as possible. The Hotel is classy with lovely bedrooms, great food and drink and the staff? Well they were the icing on the cake. So friendly, helpful and courteous. They certainly know how to treat guests. And a message to the manager - Josephine on reception is a treasure.
To top it all Druids Glen Golf course is the best we have ever been to - and we've been to many.",5,2016,08,23
238,Hotel Break,"Very large and busy golf hotel.A lot of families.Hotel staff ,facilities and condition are all excellent.A bit lacking in personality as all large corporate hotels can be.Food was good,if a little pricey.No cosy food free bar to enjoy a quiet drink.",4,2016,08,23

238,"Relaxing, Indulgence!",Myself and my friend visited Druids Glen on the indulgence package as a celebration. The hotel was fabulously decorated with gorgeous rooms. It was a scorcher the day we arrived and a cocktail on the deck outside was just what we needed with lovely views. We had the 3 course meal in the restaurant which was very tasty but quite rich. The spa experience was very relaxing I had a coconut wrap and my friend had deep tissue massage and both of us felt very rejuvinated afterwards. Complimentary sorbet after treatment topped it off. Breakfast the next morning had so much choice. We also had afternoon tea as part of our package which was served in the sunshine out on the deck. Couldn't recommend this hotel enough!,5,2016,08,23
238,Comfortable hotel with friendly staff,Stayed here on an overnight visit with friends. The rooms are tastefully decorated and very spacious. The breakfast was well presented and there was a vast selection of both hot and cold foods. The eggs and pancakes were cooked to order . We had bar food at night time and again it was well prepared. It is a pity that residents cant book a table in the bar . It is worth remembering that it gets very busy. The staff were all very helpful particularly Frankie and Colin in the restaurant. Check in and checkout were both speedy and hassle free. The pool looked great but didnt use it though!,4,2016,08,20
238,Perfect,"From check in to check out the whole experience was fantastic. Staff are very well trained and very personable and friendly (not just 5 star 'robots'). Everything is considered and catered for with regards to families and our kids (5 and 2) really enjoyed it. 
The food is excellent and everything is clean and relaxing. My wife enjoyed the spa. 
Would definitely return and recommend to anyone. ",5,2016,08,19
238,Lived up to expectation,"Just been down to Druids Glen for golf and overnight stay, Golf at the Druids Glen was very good with really enjoyable holes, we had dinner at night food / steak really good all in this was better that i expected, room also great",5,2016,08,19
238,5 star experience ,"Visited Druids Glen with family including our 7 and 11 year old plus my mother. Beautiful setting, very contemporary hotel. Kids and mum loved it. Service and food superb. Duty Manager Patrick helped with the 5 star experience displaying the charm and sense of humour that can only come from Ireland. Well worth the early flight from Bristol. We will return !!!",5,2016,08,17
238,Absolutely outstanding ,"Decided to book Druids Glen to help with a celebration and delighted I did. Shauna in reservations was so helpful and delivered everything she had said she would. The room was outstanding, separate sitting room area and two bathrooms. We ate in the bar and staff and food were too quality. Breakfast was again outstanding and top quality. Make sure to book this hotel, you won't be disappointed. ",5,2016,08,14
238,One of the best places I have ever stayed,"From the moment I arrived here I was impressed.  The check-in staff (Bradley) were excellent, polite, friendly and efficient. The room was perfect. High quality fittings and finish and every detail taken care of.

Food and drinks were great, the grounds and golf course were great, the facilities were great... I knew I'd be writing a review so I was trying to find something to complain about.  I came up blank.

My compliments to the staff - great job. I'm looking forward to going back.",5,2016,08,13
238,"Close to Dublin, perfectly peaceful","We stayed for 1 night in Druid's Glen and we had a really wonderful time. We arrived for afternoon tea - which was DELICIOUS. It included some sort of lavender flavoured cheesecake which was AMAZING.
We followed afternoon tea with a massage & a glass of prosecco - both excellent - and then went for dinner in the restaurant. 
Again, the food was excellent. All of the above is probably to be expected at a 5 star resort, but what really stood out for me was the service. It was faultless across the board. Every single member of staff was warm, friendly, attentive and helpful.
I would highly recommend Druid's Glen for a break away from it all.",4,2016,08,12
238,Family Holiday,"Excellent hotel, great facilities, staff were superb, lovely rooms, nice grounds, really enjoyed our stay. 4 nights is the ideal stay here. Bar restaurant was reasonable price and great quality, main restaurant wasn't as good, expensive for quality served. As a whole the place is very child friendly. ",5,2016,08,11
238,Fantastic ,"Stayed here on a 2night break with 2 children aged 10 and 3 ! Everything was spot on kids throughly enjoyed and it was a very relaxed environment. The best was the lovely waiter in the breakfast area he was very welcoming and the breakfast was nice although would have preferred a menu for the hot breakfast instead of buffet ! Other than that it was brilliant! 
Will be back again and also great value 
",5,2016,08,09
238,Relaxing,My husband and myself got this one night as a present and we had a lovely time. The staff are friendly and efficient. We used the pool and the sauna and steam room. We also had a lovely meal in the bar. Would go back again.,5,2016,08,08
238,Afternoon Tea,"I went for afternoon tea here with my sister-in-law.  Service could be a bit more polished.  We were the only ones having afternoon tea and the table had to be set up for us.  The tea and coffee selection was good and the sandwiches were very tasty although the beef one was quite salty and had a little too much horseradish for my taste.  The banana bread and scones were lovely.  There were also five little cakes too, one of which was lavender (which tasted a bit too much like soap for my tasting) but the tart was very, very tasty.  The service was very slow (likely as we were the only people there and therefore no dedicated staff for the tea) but the waitress was extremely friendly.  The tea was also very reasonable at 21 Euro.  Overall not bad but room for improvement.  The grounds are lovely afterwards for a stroll around.",3,2016,08,08
238,Great visit,"We booked Druids Glen last minute through a deals website and it went above our expectations. We loved it. From the moment we arrived, the porter at the front door made us feel so welcome and valued. He was such a helpful man and also had a great sense of humour which made us so comfortable from the start. The rest of the staff were fantastic too. The rooms are beautiful, so spacious and very well kept. The food was beautiful and the different areas to relax with a drink were lovely - we chose the little den near the fire. The only thing that struck us as not being fabulous was the walk around the grounds. The views were fabulous most of the time but we found ourselves in the front gardens of the nearby houses at one stage and came to a dead end also. There are a few little bits that have to be cleaned up on the walk and maybe a route could be mapped out for guests in future. We look forward to returning. Overall, it is a gem of a place!",5,2016,08,08
238,Amazing!!!!,"I attended Druids Glen for a work event, what can I say, Amazing!!!! The staff are an absolute credit, couldn't do enough for us. Rooms are just gorgeous, I had a pedicure with the lovely Bushra, she is an absolute credit to Druids Glen, such a lovely lady. I will most definitely be returning. Thank you.",5,2016,08,08
238,"Family wedding, superb food","Family attended a wedding there and we stayed an extra night. Absolutely superb rooms, delicious food and most friendly staff. And two wonderful golf courses though Druids Glen better than the Heath. Everything about it five star",5,2016,08,07
238,Nice,"Stayed here with kids. Nice place. The staff were friendly and very nice to children. Breakfast was excellent choice and quality. Rooms were nice with great A/C. Shower wasn't mighty in room though, poor water pressure. There is a children's play room and playground which are excellent. The only issue I would have is the clientele. Alit of snobs with fake tan who fancy themselves!!",4,2016,08,07
238,Wheelchair users beware ,"I was organising a family overnight stay and rang the hotel to check accessibility just to check even though the website had indicated wheelchair accessibility 

On enquiry I was informed that the wheelchair ""accessible"" rooms had a lower bed and wardrobe rails and the bathroom  had grab rails in the bath but no grab rails either side of the toilet. I was also told that both the bedroom and bathroom were spacious 

How can such accommodation be classified as wheelchair accessible?  Typical lip service to the disabled community and reinforces the need to plan everything like a military operation ",1,2016,08,06
238,Luxury hotel,Excellent family friendly hotel. Our room was very big and clean. Nice swimming pool. Good restaurant and bar. The staff were friendly and professional. I would highly recommend this place for some relaxation time.,5,2016,08,05
238,Another amazing stay at the Druids Glen,"I have stayed in the Druids Glen on a number of occasions and it really is such a wonderful resort to visit for some relaxation time.  Myself and my family enjoyed a one night stay in June to celebrate a special occasion.  We were given complimentary upgrades and received chocolates in our rooms which was just lovely.  Joanna made the reservation process so easy and really looked after us to ensure our celebration was memorable.

The pool facility is lovely and there is a Jacuzzi, sauna, steam room, and plunge pool for the brave ones!  The changing rooms are spacious and clean.

We ate in the bar and the food was lovely.  It would be great if there were more vegetarian options available as I did find the menu quite limiting in this regard.  However, in saying that the pea croquettes were delicious.  Highly recommend their chunky chips - they are really good!  The early bird option in the restaurant seemed like excellent value.  Breakfast next morning was lovely.  We were seated promptly and although extremely busy, everything was regularly replenished.  I love the way you can order a specialty coffee if you wish.

This is a really lovely hotel if you are just looking for a break away from it all.  We are already looking forward to our next visit!",5,2016,08,04
238,A Wonderful Place To Chill Out,"Nestled in the Wicklow countryside is the beautiful hotel that is the Druid's Glen.
The spa facility is class and I would highly recommend a visit as the treatments and the facilities are second to none.
The hotel itself is huge but the staff are nice, friendly and courteous which is what you want and the food is delicious.
The surroundings around the hotel are idyllic, the Wicklow mountains provide a glorious backdrop as does the Irish sea. 
If you are lucky you might just see a celeb or two swinging the golf clubs",5,2016,08,03
238,Excellent family friendly hotel.,"We spent a weekend in this fabulous hotel in April and I have been meaning to write a review since then. The staff are without a doubt the most genuine and friendly that I have come across in an Irish hotel!
We were met at the door and our car was valet parked which was a lovely touch. We were shown to a lovely large room with a great view of the golf course and a super large bathroom. 
We went for a dinner option and had an outstanding meal in the restaurant on our first night. We had a small baby with us and the staff could not have been welcoming to him even in the dining room after 8pm. (He was quiet I promise!)
We took a lovely walk around the grounds on the second day as well as using the pool which was excellent and welcoming to children. 
We ate in the bar on the second night which was good however we did find the price of the drinks a bit steep. That said, it's par for the course in most hotels these days. 
As I mentioned the staff could not be more professional and helpful. They explained the breakfast options and were on hand with teas, toast etc. 
I rang the hotel after checkout as I realised we left the baby's sleepsack behind. The hotel staff were most helpful in tracking it down to the laundry, retrieving it and posted it back to us in Dublin. Thank you very much! 
Overall a great stay and hopefully one we will repeat in the not too distant future!",5,2016,08,02
238,Wedding top class,What can I say one off the best hotels I have ever Stayed in top class the staff where so friendly from the time we got there to the time we left rooms where very clean and beautiful. The wedding was amazing all the food from start to finish was so good it it was all so amazing . Can not fault this amazing Hotel in any way top marks well done to all .thank you all will see you again soon .,5,2016,08,02
238,Lovely wee treat,"Was invited to join friends to celebrate a birthday.  Attention to detail was excellent with very attentive staff all round from restaurants to spa - unfortunately don't play golf but was very busy with other guests who do.  Rooms spacious and very clean and quiet.  Had massage at spa, finished with refreshing complimentary sorbet mmmmmmmm!  Masseuse was really lovely and excellent. Can't wait to return!",5,2016,07,31
238,A little bit of luxury!,"Have just returned from a magical long weekend at Druids Glen, four couple, four golfers, plenty of luxury for everyone. Spa and health suite are wonderful. Gorgeous place with excellent and friendly service from all staff. Can't wait to return. ",5,2016,07,31
238,Below Par,Nice enough hotel with generally very good staff.  I was very disappointed with Hugo's Restaurant.  There seemed to be more effort put into presentation than taste.  Desserts were abysmal.  The Bar produced a better meal the following night.  The fish and chips was particularly good.  Dessert was again a problem.  I did not think that the decor was quite up to 5 start standard.,3,2016,07,31
238,Druids Glen simply has it all ,"I've used Druids Glen both for private stays and to organise company conferences and I would highly recommend for both. 

First and foremost there's the staff, who are absolutely wonderful; friendly, knowledgeable and attentive. 
Then there's the hotel itself which is just stunning and located in a beautiful part of the country. It's a great place to go walking and if the westher doesn't allow for that (it is Ireland after all) I highly recommend the hotel spa. 

From a conference point of view I most appreciate the eye for detail, their ability to think outside the box when a situation calls for it and their flexibility. When you bring 50 demanding managers together you want it to be perfect and the team at Druids Glen always helps me do that. 

",5,2016,07,30
238,Brilliant!!!,"From the second I stepped onto the resort we were looked after superbly. Great course, great views and very reasonable for such quality. If you only have time for one round in Ireland play here. Difficult greens, elevation changes, tight fairways and grabbing grass mean bring your A game. Take a little off your swing and enjoy the day, it's a pleasure to be alive.",5,2016,07,29
238,Birthday Treat ,"Had a lovely meal here for my birthday . Although the scallop starter was tiny , the steak was delicious . The hotel is suited to an older demograph. Some people had remarked that it was like being in the film cocoon . Make your own mind up on that one . The staff were great , very friendly , attentive , well turned out and nothing was too much trouble . I was expecting slightly more luxury in the pool area though for a 5 star hotel . Lovely view from the room . Good food in the bar , although one of my party had a lamb balti which was inedible with salt . Food is definitely priced very high. This I think should be reviewed . Either increase quality or decrease prices . Overall a nice stay . We had stayed here as a last minute trying to get into Lough Eske Resort ",4,2016,07,28
238,Top quality hotel.,"Stayed at Druids Glen again. The staff are the best thing about this hotel. They are excellent hence so is your stay. Everything about the hotel speaks quality. Reception on arrival perfect. Rooms excellent.  Complimentary WiFi. Food is Michelin Star quality on a par with Chapter One in Dublin. There's a baby room on the 1st floor. All u need us there. Steriliser, nappies, food, bottle warmer, kettle microwave. You will not be disappointed. Breakfast is superb endless choices beautifully presented. Great value for great service. ",5,2016,07,26
238,Wonderful 2 nights!,"We spent the last 2 nights of our 10 day Ireland vacation at Druids Glen.  The facility is beautiful, clean, comfortable.  But above all that was the staff and service.  Everyone went above and beyond to help us and answer our questions.  On the morning of our checkout the front desk had 4 breakfasts packed to go with us because our flight left before breakfast started!  They recommended us take a train to Dublin which ran along the coast and was beautiful.  They took us to the closest train depot and picked us up late that night!  It was so nice experiencing the train and not having to drive in Dublin.  I highly recommend a stay at Druids Glen.",5,2016,07,26
238,Outstanding and luxurious hotel,"Everything about Druids glen is impeccable. It really lives up to its 5 star status, also deserves a special mention for its accessibility for the disabled, very accomadating of all needs and the Spa staff were especially accomodating. A fabulous stay.",5,2016,07,25
238,Reservation made!,"Thankyou Naomi :-)
I rang last week and your patience and good humour as I asked a gazillion questions and chopped and changed my request, was very much appreciated.
If this is an example of what we can expect when we stay at the end of August - well....we can't wait! 
See you then!
Jacquie Richardson",5,2016,07,25
238,"""Magically Magical""","What can I say about druids Glen. I am a fuss ball at times and have always been told I will always find fault with anything. Well those people have been proven wrong. I just can't fault the druids Glen hotel. The location just amazing, looking out into the vast openness of country side and breathing in the freshness of clean air brings with it a sense of tranquility. It would inspire a person to want to paint a landscape picture or start writing a novel 😁 Call me cheesy or plain old sentimental but I truly touched by the beauty of nature that surrounded me.
   The hotel interior itself is in a league of its own, I do t know siltch about design or artictecher(I'm even struggling to spell it ha) but as I sat and took in the view of the stone work and wooden beams layout from the lobby chairs, I couldn't help but think it was so clever it was and I really appreciated it's beauty.
  The rooms were very spacious with beautiful decor, comfy beds, big flat-screen which had lots channels including sky sports 1 2 & 3 (for the men) although you won't be doing much watching telly in your room when there a plenty of things to do...
  I attended a wedding here and it was just amazing, the staff did a wonderful job at making the new married couples day magical. The food was outstanding with so any flavorsome dishes that tease the pallet for more. Presentation was also so appetising. Even the BBQ the next day was so tasty with lots of exciting varieties to goose from. Breakfast was 1 class service with plenty of fresh options to fill up up for that day of golf of sightseeing.
  I had my 2 young children with me and there never was a bored moment, which was unexpected from my 11 year old who usually latches on to my hip. The Druids Den catered for all ages with fussball table, air hockey, Xbox, books, toys, a ball pen, educational toys, creative play, and also a movie player. The swimming pool was a great place to go as a family, the design was so thought out, relaxing and enjoyable at same time. There's a sauna and steam room and also a spa for adult time. ( I never got to visit these, but a dip in pool was just as good. There is also a great children's playground where kids can play as lo g as they wish. The area and LAnd scape around hotel is wonderful, it's like a different world, you can really just forget about stress of daily life and imagine enjoy that time in the now, it would do wonders for you.
   One thing I'd like to mention and I don't think it's a negative, it all depends on how you value the good things in life, I don't mean materialistic things, but things that make you feel good, important things like family time, good food, surroundings, peace and quite, a time to recharge from real life. The price is up there with the highest I have ever paid, some might argue it's too much, which I assumed before I arrived. It didn't matter once I started experiencing the warm welcome, the relaxed atmosphere and the overall feeling of ""this was so worth it"" 

So I best stop now before trip advisor bans my for been too overly detailed lol, as I've just realised I have wrote an essay not a review haha. Above I have just written from the heart and describe and how I've returned from my weekend feeling. It's my opinions and my experience.",5,2016,07,24
238,Happy Wedding Day!!,"Excellent day from start to finish, highly recommend Druids Glen for your wedding day!!  From reviewing our hotel to the big day every member of staff was amazing.  The grounds were perfect for our pictures which turned out great!",5,2016,07,24
238,Lovely surroundings,"Hotel and setting visually pleasing and rooms were comfortable. Staff were helpful and pleasant. However, we felt it was overpriced, especially as breakfast was not included. This would have cost another€20 per person per day. Ambience and cuisine in the bar not up to scratch for a 5 star hotel - the table we were directed to was not cleared and the floor was dirty. When we stated that we weren't entirely happy with the food, nothing was done about.",4,2016,07,22
238,Paradise found!,Glorious spa treatment! 2 gorgeous golf courses! Extraordinary staff and delightful dining. A wonderful beginning to a perfect holiday in Ireland! If you love golf you will love this hotel--simply something for everyone.,5,2016,07,22
238,Amazing,"After a two night stay at Druids Glen we cannot wait to get a chance to return! 

I was initially quite nervous about our trip as my daughter has been battling cancer for 8 months, we got a little break from hospital and I thought a sneaky get away to the country side would do her the world of good.

As soon as we got to reception to check in my nerves went out the window... The staff were simply wonderful. Firstly they presented us with lemonade and wet towels while being checked in, activity books for kids, we then were upgraded to a beautiful suite (214), when we arrived into our room our daughter was given a present and a box of chocolates from staff. 
We ate in Hugo's on our first night and the bar the second night, food and staff were both fabulous in both.

Everybody knew my daughters name, April, and made a fuss of her everywhere we went in the hotel - we brought her away to spoil her before starting a new treatment next week, the staff done exactly that for us. 

April loved the play ground outside and walking around the grounds, she pretended she was in a spooky forest, hid behind trees and ran more than she has in about a year. She loved the chocolates left on her bed every evening and the shortbread left beside the Nespresso machine for her. She also loved loved loved how comfy the beds are - she has not slept in a bed on her own in a very long time as it reminds her of a week she spent in ICU, however she would not let mammy nor daddy near her special comfy little bed in Druids Glen! 

April cannot go swimming as she has a Hickman line in her chest but the bath was just as good for her, the first thing she done when we arrived to our room was have a bath and she had a further 5 in the next 2 days! She adored all the fabulous soaps and bath salts.

I visited the spa and had a signature treat, it was so amazing and has really set the bar high for future massages! The sorbet after my treatment in the relaxation room was the icing on the cake. 

Such an amazing experience, thank you so much to all at Druids Glen. It definitely gave April and ourselves wonderful memories and a well needed distraction from treatment and hospital. We really hope to return again in the future.",5,2016,07,22
238,Great stay,"The resort is great. Big clean modern rooms. There is a playground and games room for kids.  Reception provides board games and dvds also. 

There is lots to do with pool, spa etc and the grounds are really nice to go for walks. 

Food, service and bar/restaurant areas are beautiful settings.

Looking forward to staying again.  ",5,2016,07,22
238,Great hotel and really friendly staff!,"Stayed here recently for a wedding and we couldn't have been more impressed!

The hotel is located a short drive from Dublin city although once you slide off the motorway you'll find yourself deep in the Wicklow countryside. On arrival the staff almost rushed out to greet us and couldn't have been more helpful. The lobby area and the hotel itself throughout is immaculate, modern and classy. 

Our room was beautiful. Well designed with high ceilings, comfortable beds and plenty of space. We had a view looking into grassed area and other rooms across the way. It might be worth paying a little extra for a view of the mountains and the valley.

We stayed for three nights and the food was exceptional! Breakfast was amazing and dinners were the same. The gf was looking after her nephew a fair bit and the staff couldn't have been more helpful with assistance when needed.

The main thing about the hotel though is the staff. Every time we asked a question or passed someone in a corridor there was a genuine smile. Really makes a big difference. 

It is pricey though. Three days boozin and eating at a place nice this will set you back, definitely worth remembering!

Couldn't recommend more though, in fairness.",5,2016,07,21
238,Great service and facilities,"A long weekend with great weather. Everyone in the hotel was friendly and smiled with a big hello.
Breakfast was really good, lunch really nice and the evening dining was superb. All in a great location.
The kids club was such a great idea. Leave your kids at 5-9 and you go and have a meal. They even feed them. Kids really enjoyed.
Really nice walk around the golf course to the other club house but be aware there is no short cut back.
The pool is brilliant and great for a swim or play with kids. Never got too busy.
Druids Heath golf course is really good and a challenge. Great driving range and putting green.
Will require a second visit",5,2016,07,20
238,Absolutely perfect,"I genuinely don't know how to express how perfect our stay was. I have travelled the world and stayed in many places but have never encountered staff like here. From Adrienne from Mayo checking us in- such a warm, wonderful welcome. Maeve from Limerick- wow, amazing service! And Peter from Dublin- so very attentive too. We will, without doubt, be returning soon. Highly, highly recommended based on the wonderful staff- the wonderful surroundings are a bonus! ",5,2016,07,20
238,Lovely but overpriced,"So here's the good stuff,staff were brilliant,very friendly and genuine...place is in a lovely setting and there is a nice calm atmosphere...
Downside,for the price it's overpriced by a long stretch.after being to some other Wicklow Wexford hotels,recently the pool facilities are very bad,place was rampant with screaming kids and myself and my boyfriend were informed when we got down to the pool that we both need a hat,which is a great time to inform us when we've no cash on us,and none with us.
The rooms are nice but need to be updated for the price as does the decor of the entire place.the lobby area especially.i enjoyed my stay but I wouldn't rush back
",4,2016,07,20
238,A beautiful hotel in the Garden county,"I very recently enjoyed a wonderful stay here with my wife and we thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of our stay. This is a wonderful hotel, located in the absolutely beautiful Wicklow countryside, even living just down the road in Dublin I am still amazed at the beauty of Wicklow every time I visit. 

Attention to detail and going the extra mile is evident in Druids glen from the get go, the staff are very friendly and informative at reception and being offered fresh lemonade upon check in was a very nice touch, as was the water offered upon check out. 

Our room was lovely and catered for everything we needed, I found the bed and pillows very comfortable and I slept very well. 

The grounds of the hotel are amazing and guests can take in some lovely scenic walks, that include some views of the Irish sea. 

We also ate in the restaurant and found everything excellent. The Spa facilities were also fantastic, the pool, sauna and steam rooms were particularly enjoyable. 

One slight negative was that I found the hotel was not very well signposted in Newtownmountkennedy and this could be improved. 

I would recommend this hotel 100% and hope to visit again soon.",5,2016,07,19
238,Helpful Reservations,Have just booked for a first visit to Druid's Glen with Reservations office. Joanna so helpful and informative. Discussed different packages. Lots of options explained. Really looking forward to visit.,5,2016,07,19
238,Golf Trip,Another great trip to Druids Glen. Where to start. You enter and the staff are so friendly and willing to help. A nice lavender towel to freshen up at check in and then off to the spacious rooms. The facilities both spa and golf are just too notch whatever floats your boat. ,5,2016,07,18
238,Five star hotel in every way. ,"Second visit here and not disappointed. This time with our year old little girl. The facilities remain amazing, good food, wonderful staff and beautiful rooms. Nothing is too much trouble. But the thought that's gone into helping with families is unprecedented. With an amenity room on each floor, with nappies, wipes and food, in a wide range of sizes. Perfect. Setting the benchmark for 5* family hotels. ",5,2016,07,17
238,Great bar staff,"Stayed here for a weding four days of pure bliss, Irish hospitality at its finest, special mention to the barstaff who were great and looked after us all very well especially James. The golf was great and kids facilities are great. A must visit when your in the area. ",4,2016,07,17
238,Perfect Getaway,"We stayed here for 2 nights recently and it was the perfect mini break.  The staff are so friendly and helpful.  The hotel is really child friendly.  We had afternoon tea on arrival and I would highly recommend this.  My 6 year old son had his own little afternoon tea and he loved it.  We ate in the bar one night and in the restaurant the second night, the food is outstanding.  The kids bath robes is an excellent touch.  I look forward to returning to the hotel, it's ideal for both adults and kids.",5,2016,07,16
238,First night away with our son!,"I use to stay in the Druids Glen regularly but haven't been back in about 2 years or so and I'm delighted I came back again, the hotel was always a pleasure to stay in but now it seems they have taken a step forward in nearly every aspect. 

It was our first night away from home with our 6 month old son and we wanted to do something special to just get away for a night and I'm so happy we visited again.

From checking in to checking out the staff were so helpful and accommodating. Every time we came across a staff member they would greet us politely and more importantly they seemed sincere, nothing worse than a fake smile.

On the first day we had afternoon tea and this is something I enjoy a lot and have had many so I know what I like and don't like. It was amazing, the desserts were to die for the whole thing was lovely all thanks to a lovely staff member call Drew she was so nice and made the afternoon tea experience that bit better, she was very attentive but knew how to give us some space aswell. I regularly go for afternoon tea around Dublin and I reckon this was one of the best I've had in awhile, I think it was Bloom Day themed.

While sitting enjoying a drink in the conservatory looking out at all the greenery we got chatting to the operation manager who was a very nice man. My husband is in the industry all his life and he commented afterwards how professional this guy was as he spoke quite genuinely to us but he also had a keen eye looking over every customer and staff member in the area, fixing chairs and picking up a dirty napkin that had fallen to the ground as we walked away. Obviously the management expect a lot from the staff but lead by example.

Our room was spotless clean with a huge comfortable bed and all the usual amenities that you would expect. The shower product were a very high quality and I enjoyed using them. We spent a lovely hour in the room with the air conditioning on as it was a hot day.

Then we went for a swim, this was extra special as was our sons first time and it was such a wonderful experience, they have family changing rooms which I thought was great! The pool was spotless clean with plenty of space.

We then had dinner that night in the bar which was lovely and we had a conner to ourselves as we had our son with us. I would have liked maybe a few more starters but then menu was nicely varied and we were still full from afternoon tea. My husband had a steak which he enjoyed.

Then breakfast the next morning again staff couldn't do more for us, very attentive. The omelette station is a lovely touch. The only thing I didn't enjoy was the pancakes, they use to make them fresh but now have some machine, I didn't enjoy them and didn't eat them.

Overall was a wonderful stay, really love this hotel in fact we are back there in two weeks for two nights with ten extended family and I can't wait. We will definitely make this our go to hotel in the future.

We stay in hotels about 40 nights a year and we will be definitely spending lots more nights at Druids Glen.",5,2016,07,14
238,Great family friendly hotel,"We stayed here for two nights and I would thoroughly recommend it, especially good if you are looking for a very nice hotel that is child friendly.  The location is beautiful and there are bikes available to cycle round the grounds. 
The food in Hugo's was excellent, and the kids high tea club was very popular with the kids, great idea!  The breakfast was great with plenty of variety, and some nice touches like the honeycomb that make it five star, the treatments I had in the spa were also most enjoyable and as good as other five star hotels I have stayed in.  I would definitely return.",5,2016,07,12
238,Lovely Hotel,"7th time back at this hotel for a work golf trip, last time there it felt like the hotel was starting to go down hill, pleased to say it is brilliant again. Staff all very friendly, great food in the restaurant. Large rooms, very comfortable beds, very clean.",5,2016,07,12
238,So relaxing,"We stayed here for one night and I only wished we could have stayed longer. From the moment we arrived we were met with friendly and helpful staff. The room was fabulous and the bed was extremely comfortable. Dinner in the bar was good we had Pulled pork and the burger. Probably should have had dinner in the restaurant but next time we will. The walk around the hotel was beautiful and the gardens are well kept and maintained. The next morning before we left I had a lovely swim. The pool there is lovely and early in the morning it was quiet. I also made use of the sauna and hot tub. Again both lovely, just wish I had more time to spend there. 
Breakfast was superb the selection and presentation of everything was top class. Staff again could not do enough for you and there was no rushing you out. 
A fantastic place to come and visit just don't make it a short one!
We will be back for a longer stay soon.",5,2016,07,11
238,Family friendly hotel,"We had a wonderful 4 night stay at Druids Glen. From the moment we arrived we were met by very friendly and efficient staff. The little touches of lemonade and warm lavender towels were very welcome on arrival. Special mention to Marc for explaining all, and looking after us. Our family room was spotlessly clean, separate bath and shower, robes for us and the kids, empty fridge, plenty of hangers and plenty of other things that if not there, really bug me. We ate at the Thirteeneth bar, all very good and as expected. Breakfast was superb. Plenty of choice, continental and cooked Irish breakfast. I like good coffee...it hit the spot! My son loved the real fresh honeycomb on his toast and daughter loved the fresh pancakes made to order. My husband ordered poached eggs, they were perfect. We had dinner in Hugo's twice. It was wonderful. The first night we ordered from the early bird menu...thirty five euro for three courses. Thanks to Loic for looking after us so well, and to Chef for cooking steak for my kids, nothing was too much trouble. We returned the next night it was so good. Swimming pool was brilliant, again spotlessly clean with modern changing facilities, staff were also very friendly. Kids really enjoyed the outdoor play park, and the games room. All these things make such a difference when you have kids. Summed up, great facilities, super staff, spotlessly clean, we will of course be back!",5,2016,07,09
238,K,Stayed here for 2 nights back in June and had a fabulous time. Extremely helpful and friendly staff. Fantastic golf course. But the highlight of the stay was definitely Our meal in Hugo's restaurant. The best meal I've ever had. Fillet beef to die for! Cooked  to perfection. Could not recommend this hotel enough. ,5,2016,07,09
238,Great hotel ,"Spent a lovely night here recently with friends . The spa was wonderful, excellent massage and a great relaxation suite with juice, herbal teas, fruit and magazines.
Dinner was exceptional. The fillet steak was second to none. Two minor complaints- our room was very warm (despite the AC switched to 17 degrees ) and a little small for 3 people . Also there was no conditioner in the bathroom that'd would've been nice.
Lovely setting though.",4,2016,07,09
238,Splendor in many ways !,"Upon the first step ,to the last Goodbye you are treated like family in this lovely resort hotel. The grounds are beautiful ,the food delicious, and the golf is fantastic. They go the extra step to make your visit memorable ! The first staff member we met was Tigue who brought our many bags to our room Josephine who helped send some purchases we made back to the USA. , Adriene who was a fount of information, Paul ,a golf course ambassador to James a bartender were just a few of the staff that we had the pleasure to meet. Highly reccommend",5,2016,07,08
238,Brodie Bowl Golf Competition,"Another great stay at this fantastic resort that has two magnificent golf courses.
The staff are exceptionally friendly and attentive making the stay even more enjoyable in the very comfortable rooms.
Would recommend this hotel to anyone who enjoys service with a capital 'S'.",5,2016,07,08
238,Credit card problems,"We stayed here for four nights checking out on 2nd June The hotel was generally good and the food was excellent. However room servicing was a little erratic. One day we had been out and arrived at our room at 5pm and the beds were not made up and the towels not replaced. We rang reception who said we must have had the do not disturb notice on the door, this was not the case but she tried to tell us we were wrong. Even if we were wrong I don't think its a good idea for staff to argue with guests. It is now almost five weeks since we checked out paying in full and this hotel still has a hold on my credit card of 120 euro. After two weeks I sent an email querying this and it was ignored so last week I rang and was told that they had no idea why they still had this hold and it would take another two weeks to remove.That would be a hold for almost six weeks. The point I am making is that if you stayed here any length of time there would be a good amount of money on your card which you would not be able to spend and may take you over your card limit.
Visited June 2016",3,2016,07,06
238,Nice room - not enough attention to the small details of a guest's stay,"Friendly receptionist, however we were lead in a poor situation.On our honeymoon, it could have been even an even worse disaster if we did not have some luck on our side. DO NOT take their guidance.  Recommended to take walk in the evening to 13th bar for the view and offered pick up and ride back to hotel. We even asked if it would be too late and said it would be fine. Unaware of the length of walk, took an hour after the lack of signage through the woods caused us to becomes lost a few times, luckily we still had a little light. Arrived at the location which was completely closed for the night, as it was becoming dark and no way to call hotel we were in a frenzy. We would have been absolutely lost in the back golf course!!! Luckily (if you call that lucky), we caught the last remaining employee going out to his personal car who felt so bad he gave us a lift (in his personal car) back to the hotel!! Receptionists became ""busy"" when we entered hotel refraining from a welcome back. Completely disgraceful. Had to fix the a few things that were left in pieces in the room (i.e. toilet paper dispenser) and had intermittent warm/cold water in the shower. Room and bed were very nice and staff was friendly and welcoming until we walked back into hotel very upset.",2,2016,07,05
238,Great for kids,Overall had a lovely time here. Staff were particularly pleasant and helpful. However I am reviewing it because I want to mention the Kids' High-tea Club. Our two girls aged 6 and 8 absolutely loved it. Very reasonably priced and would highly recommend. ,5,2016,07,05
238,6* Experience,"The hotel is located just minutes from Dublin, yet the peaceful and tranquil setting leads you to you feel you are hours from the hustle and bustle. On arrival, we were greeted by a very friendly doorman. Check-in was excellent, Rebecca took the time to welcome us; her warm and engaging personality left us feeling right at home. Rebecca took the time to explain all facilities within the hotel leaving no details left unanswered and offered her assistance to us for the duration of our stay.

The room was excellent. It is evident that all elements within the room were chosen carefully to compliment the grounds of the resort from the colour scheme & furniture to the finer details such as the toiletries which are inspired by the natural scents of the countryside. 

We dined in both the bar for lunch & restaurant for dinner and breakfast which were excellent. The health club is well equipped boasting beautiful views from the pool. Colin in the health club was superb. From the moment we entered, he went above and beyond in every way he could. The grounds of the hotel are kept in immaculate condition, from the exterior furniture to the manicured gardens. 

Whilst all elements of the resort are truly 5*, it is the staff who take the experience to the next level. I would like to thank Ivan, Silvana, Rebecca & Colin for everything over the course of our stay.",5,2016,07,04
238,"Nice Hotel, although room for improvement","Stayed here last week, couldn't complain about the room or service, however there are a few things which were disappointing:

- The food in the bar was very overpriced and small portioned. I payed £46 sterling for a beer, coke, two mains (burger and fish) and a dessert and left feeling hungry. If I was to come back I'd probably drive to somewhere local for a meal.
- I went to watch the euro's in the bar, but with only two tiny tv screens it was disappointing and not great for watching sport. Also hard to get a seat/table.
- the 13th bar doesn't really have any clear views of the golf course, yes you can see one of the tee boxes, but for the most part the view is obstructed by trees. Really the hotel is playing on the fact that is built beside the boundary of the glen course, there isn't really any true integration between the two, as a stone wall and steep bank separates the two. 

Pro's:

- The glen golf course is worth a game or walk around, one of the best I've seen
- The pool/gym 
- Breakfast in Hugo's restaurant ",4,2016,07,04
238,A 'nice' break ,"Just returned from a one night stay at Druids Glen with my family. Have to say on the whole we enjoyed it. We had a lovely spacious room, the pool was super and the kids had a ball as did they in the playroom(great idea for kids). However i had to laugh when I read a previous  review about the bacon being like rubber and the novice egg maker! I concur wholeheartedly to both. Not that of a 5 star hotel. I also felt having had the privilege of staying in quite a few 5 star establishments the thirteen hole (bar) food wasn't anything to write home about and extremely overpriced. That aside on the whole we enjoyed our stay and would definitely come again on another Groupon deal!",4,2016,07,01
238,Special Occasion,"We stayed for one night for our Wedding Anniversary over the May Bank Holiday. The location was great and all the staff that we met over  the weekend were friendly and polite.  Facilities at the hotel were second to none. 

I was gifted a voucher for a session at the Golf Academy with Golf Pro Patrick Geraghty.  As a novice of only a couple of years playing golf, this was a great learning opportunity. After only 10 mins or so Patrick had me hitting solid shots that I would never have expected.  Although I have had several lessons elsewhere I felt this yielded almost immediate results.

The best was yet to come, on the course Patrick with his very mild manner steered me around the 9 holes.  This was a truly laid back good fun experience.  Patrick is a true gentleman. Delighted to have met him. 

We had a lovely meal in the restaurant that evening.  Food and service was good. 

Buffet breakfast next morning was exceptional. Such a choice of food. 

Truly wonderful weekend and will definitely return again.

238,Special Treat,"Myself and my wife decided to treat ourselves to a night away and we were not disappointed. when I booked online I asked for a king room with a view. We arrived early and expected that the room would'nt be ready and were surprised that the room was ready and was a king and had a lovely view over the golf course The check in staff could not have been more helpful, in fact we found all the staff extremely helpful
 The room was large with a very comfortable bed, the bathroom was also large with both a bath and separate shower. We had dinner in the restaurant and the food was cooked to perfection. We had breakfast the next day and again could find no fault with the food or the service, this hotel is one we will definitely come back to",5,2016,07,01
238,Perfect get away ,"We stayed for one night for our wedding anniversary . Hotel is perfect, beautiful setting. We had a king room, loads of space. We made use of the swimming pool, sauna. The restaurant has really good food and also catered well for my vegetarian wife. We skipped dessert as we couldn't eat any more, but 5 minutes after getting back to out room , we got a knock on our door and they had bought us a dessert with 'happy anniversary' on the plate...nice touch. Buffet breakfast next morning was wonderful, they make omelette to order and the Guinness brown bread is the best. Very happy we stayed.",5,2016,06,30
238,Very underwhelming for a 5 star place,"Very underwhelming for a 5 star place (compared to other same or even lower level places we've been to). 
Very little about my stay felt like 5 star. Feels old and outdated. No luxury. No 5 star attention to detail. 
There was nothing really wrong with the place, just very neutral and underwhelming, which a 5 star place should never be. ",3,2016,06,30
238,Wedding,"We were here for a wedding last summer. The food was lovely and the service was brilliant. The staff were professional, polite and friendly. We had a lovely young girl serving us. I cant remember here name now but she was so nice. You could have a laugh with her. Will be back.
John and Maura",5,2016,06,29
238,Luxury,"Our non golfing friends have often recommended this hotel so being golfers we gave it a go for a to night break. We were not disappointed.

The place looks very luxurious on arrival and the staff were pleasant and helpful. They have a somewhat cramped desk from which to work which means you are almost jostling the next customer when checking in. and almost part of their conversation. There's loads of room actually if only the counter was longer.

Despite this we were off to the room which was huge and more than satisfactory. The bathroom was excellent and the temperature overnight was fine. 

The first night we ate in the Hugo's restaurant and the second night we ate after our golf at the golf club. The food was lovely in both, with the golf club serving the best bowl of seafood chowder I have had in Ireland {relegating Smugglers Inn in Waterville and Fitzpatricks in Dundalk to No. 2 and 3 respectively} Absolutely outstanding.

Both golf courses are very challenging and the whole resort is terrific. Highly recommended.

However, not all was perfect and I have to mention the cooked breakfast. The continental stuff was fine and plentiful.  My wife's omelette looked like an alien life form from Star Trek and was definitely not properly cooked. The maitre d'hotel did try to sort this out when it was brought to his attention and what looked like a novice 'egg person' {as a golfing friend once called this position} suddenly had assistance from the kitchen. The heat in the pan had been set far too low making the omelette very rubbery and inedible.This is forgivable as everyone has to start somewhere but what was not was the bacon that resided in the large domed pan. 

I have a thing about bacon and the stuff served up here was only matched in it's awfulness by the Rembrandt Hotel in London {so bad I don't even want to think about it}.  However this is Ireland and standards should be a lot better, as in England breakfasts are usually pathetic when it comes to cooked food. I even got the egg person to try to frazzle up my bacon in one of his pans. After an age it looked exactly the same so I took it from him and sampled it. Big mistake.

Whoever reads this should go tomorrow to the bacon container and have a look at it. They will find a pinkish flabby pile of bacon with little colour or crispness with salty white streaks giving a wretched impression. It tastes just as bad as it looks, like a lump of cardboard. For heaven's sake, Ireland abounds in fantastic well cooked bacon, often crisp and firm with tasty fat - not this sort of rubbish. If it was served in a 'greasy spoon' you might see past it and accept you get what you pay for. 

Someone please get a grip. Get the chef out with a plate and both of you sit down and taste it. Lord knows what the American think of it. It is completely beyond repair. Has nobody ever visited North America or any other Irish 5 star hotels to see what they have to offer?

Anyway, in fairness the sausages were really excellent and I settled for these on toast on Day 2 as the egg station and bacon container looked just as bad on Day 1. I suggest you do the same if you want something tasty and meaty.

I have dwelt far too long on this, {which might be a bit unfair on the place but it has to be said} but you should not let this detract from the overall experience.

It is a really nice place, peaceful and calming with very good staff and if some wizard fixes the breakfast it would be even better. I will certainly go back and hopefully it will be fixed, though I'm not expecting much. 

I suppose somebody might reply to tell me I'm the only one to complain about it {usual  excuse number one} or that they serve thousands of satisfied customers {usual  excuse number two} or even that it ""it is very popular with our guests"" {usual excuse number three}. We've heard them all.......

If you get one thing out of this review it is the fact that the seafood chowder in the golf club is FANTASTIC and should not be missed.",5,2016,06,28
238,Highly recommend ,"Amazing hotel.rooms lovely and spacious,really clean.the staff really friendly could not do enough for you.a pity we only stayed for 1 night as would of loved to stay longer.lovely grounds surrounding the hotel also.resturant and bar top class and really lovely views.cant recommend this hotel enough",5,2016,06,27
238,Nice for a night away with friends,Good spot for a girlie night away. Nice spacious rooms. Food was good. Seems to be good for families too so a good option for a family get together. Lovely peaceful setting. The staff are really helpful and friendly. There was a wedding in but you wouldn't even realise it as its well away from the more central part of the hotel. The only criticism I had was not on the hotel but the bar entertainment. Not the best! ,4,2016,06,27
238,Wedding,"Everything about resort was top class. Unintrusive but observant to all needs and quick response to any request. We had a wonderful family stay during our son""s wedding. Staff, accommodation, food, beauty of the area, facilities. Thank you all in Druids Glen.",5,2016,06,27
238,Bustling hotel break,"Got a good offer at the last minute for this hotel. Very pleasant experience all round. Room was clean and well appointed, main areas nicely decorated and maintained, staff friendly, restaurant serving good food. The star of the show for me was the breakfast. Although tea/coffee service was a bit slow the selection of foods was amazing. Everything was delicious and I even got the wheaten bread recipe. This hotel actually has good facilities for children too. ",4,2016,06,26
238,Beautiful ,"We stayed here while playing the Druids Glen golf course. The course is about a mile away from the Hotel but they do operate a shuttle bus to and from the Hotel. The rooms are of a high quality, spacious and very comfortable. We didn't eat Dinner at the Hotel (having eaten at the Golf club which was excellent) but breakfast was great. Wide selection to choose from and the omelettes made by the chef were delicious. The staff here without exception were friendly and efficient and really made a difference, well done ! We will definitely be back for a longer stay. Highly recommended. ",5,2016,06,26
238,ALMOST PERFECT,"We visited this resort for two nights as part of a Great Value Vacation package. The difference between the resort where we had just spent 6 nights and this one was like night and day.
The welcoming was stupendous and we couldn't help ourselves comparing to the one in ""the other place"". The greeter took our luggage and parked our car at arrival. The room was fantastic with all amenities worthy of a 5 star establishment. So why 4 and not 5 stars?  I'll tell you. The room location was terrible. Giving onto the internal enclosure with the gym, air conditioning equipment, etc. with a great deal of noise coming in. Also, we were given a 5E coupon discount for the 20E breakfast at Hugo's (a great breakfast) but we read in later comments that the breakfast itself should have been included in the package. Well, anyway. It was a great place to stay.",4,2016,06,24
238,Mixed experience...,"We stayed here on May Bank Holiday weekend for one night B&B with dinner 2 adults 2 children...

Ok first the negatives...

Check in time of 4pm is way too late especially if you have children and intend on using the swimming pool and then having an early dinner.  We were told by reception that when our room came became ready they would let us know.  Unfortunately this never happened and when I returned to reception after 4pm I was told 'It's ready now'.

Dinner in Hugo's was soooo slow!!! We had been there for over 2 hours and gave up waiting for our deserts and ended up moving into the lobby.  The waiter finally brought them out to us there.

Now on to the positives...

The room was a very good size and the interior top notch.  Breakfast in the morning was excellent and there was plenty to choose from.  The seating area in the lobby is ideal if you have children and there is also a kiddies play area.

All in all we had a pleasant stay over,  but felt that the hotel didn't really deliver a true 5 star experience...more like 4 star plus.

Would we stay again? Maybe, but we wouldn't eat in the restaurant as the portion sizes were way too small and the service so slow.    The food served in the bar area seemed a decent alternative. 

",4,2016,06,20
238,Lovely Hotel in a beautiful location,"We recently stayed here with friends. The hotel is in a lovely spot and the staff made us very welcome with a sense that nothing was to much trouble. We ate in the al a carte restaurant both evenings and the food was every bit as good as the rest of the hotel. Breakfast was freshly cooked with a wide range of cereals, fruit, breads etc.
If you are golfers you must play the Druids Glen Course, scene of past Irish Opens and you won't be disappointed - in tip top condition with some truly outstanding holes.
All in all I have no hesitation in recommending this for a short break.
NB: there are time share properties in the grounds and at weekends there are significant numbers of families using the facilities.",5,2016,06,20
238,Brilliant from start to finish,"Wow , what a place. I've been to some swanky hotels and this was up there. The rooms were big and had absolutely everything with lovely views over the beautiful Wiklow countryside. Everything about this place was perfect, the restaurant , the bar, the spacious public areas and outside terrace and spa. If you are a golfer, this is heaven. The Druids Glen course is a short trip, about  a mile away with its impressive Georgian club house. Good bar food and friendly staff. There is a shuttle bus if you need it. The course is just brilliant with a very helpful pro shop. Good staff, eager to help. The 12th and 13th holes are my favorites with waterfalls, lakes, ornamental gardens, beautiful.
So if you are south of Dublin, this is the place and ideal for all the family.",5,2016,06,20
238,Fabulous Hotel,"Stayed in the Druids Glen resort with family and in laws at Halloween. From we entered the hotel the staff were extremely helpful and friendly. The hotel was spotless and restaurants and food alike were first class. Beautiful veranda area outside the main restaurant, would be great in summer months to use. We made use of the leisure facilities and were very impressed. My child used the high tea club one evening and didn't want to leave it when I went to collect him!. There was a great little playroom area with PlayStation and amusement type pax man machine and air hockey table. I believe you can rent bicycles to ride around the resort, we didn't avail of this as the weather did not permit us to. Would be a lovely idea though. Will most definitely book here again if visiting Co.Wicklow.  ",5,2016,06,19
238,Fantastic hotel 🏩 ,"This was my second stay in the Druids hotel and I loved every minute of it.  The staff are all so friendly and helpful and couldn't do enough for us, especially when the doorman offered to collect my car in the rain and drive it over so we wouldn't get wet. My 1st stay was a pamper day / night and I took another friend with me and again everything about the hotel from start to finish was fantastic,  no complaints at all. Myself and my partner have often frequented the bar with the kids on a Saturday for a drink or a coffee just to chill out as the kids love the gardens so overall it's a fantastic hotel.  ",5,2016,06,15
238,Beautiful place with excellent staff,"My wife and I stayed here in a suite last weekend.It was a really lovely experience from start to finish.
The hotel grounds are very nice.
The staff were professional and very friendly.The food in hugo's restaurant was superb as were the cocktails in the bar,we finished up with a delicious afternoon tea on Sunday before setting off for home.
Having stayed in another 5* hotel not too far from druids glen in the past,we both agreed that this was a far nicer place to stay.We hope to stay again soon.",5,2016,06,14
238,Luxury,We enjoyed our stay at the Druids Glen Resort. The staff were excellent The rooms were spacious and clean. The food in both the bar & Hugo's was delicious. Overall this is a super hotel! We will definitely be back,5,2016,06,14
238,Surprisingly excellent!,"I had concerns about booking into a 5 star hotel with two ""active"" children. I had been assured by reservations that the hotel was family friendly, but I still had doubts. 
Anyway, we took the plunge and we're delighted we did. 
This hotel isn't just good at being ""family friendly"", it excels at it. 
From the moment we checked in, we knew that it wasn't just one if those hotels that tolerates little people, it actually welcomes them and the ensuing mess!
There is a play room that caters for all ages and a playground onsite. 
The menu is excellent, with the kids having their own separate menu, not just half portions of the main meals. 
Kids are provided with colouring books and crayons to entertain them (only a small touch, but it goes down a treat). 
Staff are really friendly and all had smiles and ""hellos"" for us all. 
It was our first time here and will definitely be back. 
Probably loads of thing I've forgotten to mention, but I'll write them up after our return visit!
Well done Druids Glen.

238,Weekend break with toddler.,"We recently stayed here with our 18 month old toddler and really enjoyed our stay. The hotel is beautiful, immaculately clean and lots of amenities for children, (outdoor play area, forest walks and pool) Check in was pretty slow and we had an angry tired child that we wanted to get set up in the room. We were meant to check in for 3pm but our room wasnt ready until well after 4pm. It was a bank holiday weekend so I think the delay was sheer volume of people checking in. The room was very spacious and clean , could not fault it. We went down to the restaurant later that evening and were lucky to find a good seat. The staff were all very professional, kind and helpful all through our stay. A manager on duty checked in with us a few times to see how our stay was, (think his name was Patrick) he was a lovely person and really made a difference to our stay by adding a personal touch. Food in the restaurant was tasty, a better variety on the menu would have been nice but we could not fault what we did order. I would recommend the hotel to other couples/families without a doubt.",4,2016,06,14
238,Disappointing Stay,"My husband and 4 year old daughter stayed here last weekend and we were disappointed with it. For the money that we paid to stay one night, we both felt that it was not a 5 star experience. We ate our dinner in the bar and both agreed the food was ok - double dipped chips with a taste of fish off them. My husband had a pint of beer that was not fresh and sparkly. The walk around the hotel is not picturesque in parts - unfinished houses in view as part of the route.
The place lacks soul.
The druids den could be improved e.g supply some chalk for the black boards. 
The outside area could be improved by planting some colourful flowers at the roundabout and a few hanging baskets around the building. A  splash of colour adds a wow factor to any place.
The staff were very nice and helpful but one gets the sense they are under serious pressure to provide to request tea/coffee. The staff were too busy trying to clear tables. The staff were very nice.
In summary, I wouldn't recommend this place - the value for money is not met.",3,2016,06,14
238,Great place to enjoy a few nights,"I stayed here for a corporate event for two nights.  The hotel is in a beautiful part of the country, is well maintained with a terrific golf course.  The room seemed fairly new and was very comfortable with a view all the way down to the Irish sea.  There is a really nice hiking trail that goes through the golf course and woods there. The lounge has very comfortable and classy seating arrangements and the bar was a great place to have a drink.  I highly recommend a stay at this hotel.",5,2016,06,13
238,"Lovely hotel, beautiful setting ","We were super impressed with this hotel, the staff were so polite, friendly and down to earth. The room was beautiful and the whole hotel was gorgeously decorated. We had dinner in the bar and the food was fabulous. We also enjoyed a walk around the lovely grounds and an amazing spa treatment. So enjoyable & relaxing, will definitely be back! 😊",5,2016,06,13
238,Great place to relax and get away from it all ,"Stayed here for one night with my sister - what a lovely, relaxing hotel!

Things I loved:
- Staff were super friendly
- Hotel is surprisingly easy to get to
- Spa treatments are amazing - again, lovely staff
- Irish magazines everywhere - it may seem like a little thing but I really liked it

I didn't have time to experience the walks around the grounds but I'm sure they would have added to the experience.

The only thing I would say is that the bar food doesn't have that many ""small plate"" options - it would be good to have some additional options. Minor detail though.

Highly recommended a visit here.",5,2016,06,13
238,Amazing Hotel,Mam and I stayed here for the night. On arrival Ricardo was efficient. He was so friendly. We got 2 warm face cloths on arrival. He went through where everything was. Lovely seating areas with electric fires. Swimming pool and facilities were very good. Rooms very comfortable and spacious and comfortable. Food in the bar lovely but chips could of been hotter. All in all great place would highly recommend it to anyone. Breakfast plentiful lovely. Staff showed us where everything was. Very friendly staff. ,5,2016,06,12
238,5 star night,"What an amazing stay in this resort. It's everything what you would expect from a 5 star hotel and more. Friendly staff, amazing restaurant with absolutely fantastic food and an amazing breakfast. The rooms were next level and provided with all the luxury imaginable. Out stay was absolutely great and we will come back for sure. ",5,2016,06,10
238,Afternoon Tea - Lovely Experience!,"Went with my mum, mother-in-law and 9 week old son. From the moment we arrived the staff were so pleasant and accommodating. Immediately we were shown to our table and the afternoon tea experience began! Our waiter was very friendly throughout and the food was delicious. The area for afternoon tea in the conservatory is very comfortable and creates a relaxing atmosphere. Price wise, €21pp is great value for what you get. Overall a great experience and look forward to going again in the future. Many thanks to the staff!",4,2016,06,09
238,Nice but wasnt wowed ,"Stayed here for 2 nights midweek with our 2 year old.  We picked here based on so many positive reviews. I wasn't sure what I expected but felt it needed a bit more.
The good :
child's bathrobe in the room 
Very friendly and pleasant staff every where you went 
Good breakfast with gluten free options 
The not so good:
Terrible water pressure in the shower!!
Beds were not very comfy (twin bed room so tried both) 
Toiletries were lacking. No hair conditioner!  I have stayed at other non five star hotels and they had toiletries for kids. For a hotel that promotes itself as family friendly it's the little things that could've made it wow
What's with no waste bins in the room?! The tiniest bin in the bathroom. We have a kid with 4 nappy changes a day. No where to put them.
Overall nice place but not sure I would be running back. ",4,2016,06,09
238,Nothing here is too much trouble...,"Myself, my wife and our 2 year old daughter spent a single night in The Druids Glen Hotel over the June bank holiday weekend. 

The hotel is situated between The Druids Glen and Druids Heath golf courses and that setting is stunning. We arrived and the staff at reception were very helpful and polite and we got the instant feeling that these people would go way out their way to help.

Our room was beautifully appointed overlooking the 13th green and 14th tee of the Druids Glen course, that is a sight to behold. The room has flat screen tv and a DVD player, reception has a DVD library with a big emphasis on the younger viewer.

We booked a dinner, bed and breakfast package at €315 for 2 adults, the toddler was free. On arrival we had lunch on the bar terrace which also had stunning views, that was so nice, that rather than eat in the dining room, we decided to have dinner in the bar where young children are not only accommodated but welcomed with lots of smiles and attention. 

After our lunch we went for a walk on their designated walking trail. When the very helpful receptionist was giving me a map of the walk, she said if we got as far as the Druids Glen golf clubhouse and didn't fancy walking back, just contact the hotel and they would send a courtesy car! All this while giving us complimentary water as ""it's hot out there for walking"".  

The standard of the food at lunch, dinner and breakfast was excellent, the pool facilities are fantastic with designated adult only times. Their is a beautiful spa facility and a kids playground. 

All that is great, but I leave our final words for the staff, hotels of Ireland take note, every staff member we encountered was a pleasure to deal with. The 2 front porters, the staff on reception, the bar and waiting staff, the maitre d, housekeeping and the pool staff all so pleasant, welcoming and genuine, this was not forced. I would love to list their names but I'm worried I would leave someone out and that would not do. 

Thank you to everyone for making our short stay so relaxing and enjoyable, 10 out of 10. This family will be back. 

John and Caroline, Dublin ",5,2016,06,06
238,A little slice of heaven 5 star luxury,"From the minute you walk in you are made to feel important , hot towels lavender service A1+++++++ by staff that want to please . Best reception and door staff every not busy doing admin all kept hidden.Room ready even though we were early beautiful rooms and large bathroom spotless. Pool area fabulous . Breakfast was a pleasure with excellent food and fabulous service nothing to much trouble .Lunch was a real treat in the golf club staff again first class . A true 5 star hotel with excellent staff will return thank you a really relaxing stay .",5,2016,06,04
238,"Dissappointed,",Visited over bank holiday weekend. Room was tastefully decorated. Book in not great with minimal eye contact from staff and v little given by way of guidance to resort.no map and snapped directions difficult to grasp. Irish welcome certainly not evident. On first night ate in bar. Steak was good while vegetarian option of pea fritters were tasteless and bland. When requested some chutney this was provided but little concern shown and full meal was charged. Breakfast next day was fine and second night we ate in main restaurant. Expectations were high to match the prices. Menu quite limited so we did not choose any starter but went for main course only. The restaurant had what I can only describe as a disappointing vibe. We were welcomed but felt like staff didn't really mean it and were not genuine in their interest in us as guests. For example not one asked us where we were from. They did ask was everything ok but nothing else. I made a mistake with choice of glass of wine and waiter replaced without comment or guidance or opinion. I felt like a naughty schoolgirl even though we were charged in full for the returned wine plus the new glass.  The staff never smiled were unwelcoming and appeared not to care a hoot if we enjoyed our evening or not. It may help them to know that we had to make a huge effort to enjoy a weekend in your hotel. As we normally travel outside of Ireland and are lucky enough to to experience hospitality of five star hotels outside Ireland the staff here have a lot to learn and perhaps should travel abroad to see how it should be done. I for one will not return to Druids glen. I enjoyed my trip and it is truly a beautiful place but please staff in Druids glen. Look like you want people to go there and not just like you are doing a job!!!,3,2016,06,04
238,Wicklow's Best Kept Secret ,"What can I say about this amazing hotel that hasn't already been said. The hotel is set on the beautiful Druids Glen Golf Resort.  Service is the best of the best and you are made feel very welcome the moment you walk in the door.  They just can't do enough for you.  Our room was spacious and very comfortable, usual tea/coffee setting, TV with an abundance of stations.  The bed was also very comfortable. 

Breakfast in the morning is of a high quality and they have a great selection of foods, again the service here was top drawer.  The Gym is also of a high standard, as is the pool / sauna facilities.  I have stayed here twice before and I will be definitely back.  Thank you to all the staff for a lovely stay. ",5,2016,06,02
238,Family and Friends Lunch,"I attended a celebratory lunch for a family occasion in Druid's Glen. We were really looking forward to it, as we had been told that the food was fantastic. There were 12 adults and 11 Children. 

The lunch got off to a good start with very good starters, however, 8 of the party opted for the Roast Sirloin of Beef. It was probably the worst beef I ever encountered, slivers of fat and grizzle permeated through every slice making it a chore to try and extract some lean meat, in fact it was so bad it as almost impossible to cut into the slices. 

On complaining to the staff about the quality, the Food & Beverage Manager was dispatched to my table. He introduced himself twice, copiously apologised but immediately laid the blame on the supplier. Funny thing about Irish Hotels, in my experience, when there's a problem they often try to find a scapegoat, instead of putting their hands up and admitting the problem. 

The customer isn't the slightest bit interested in the supplier, the farmer or indeed the DNA of the animal. It is up to the chef to ensure that good quality provisions arrive in and that they are checked before delivery to the table. The excuse offered was that it is impossible to know the quality of the meat until it's served...really? Surely and most certainly in the case of Roast Beef  the problem would have been spotted as it was carved. I really don't buy into this explanation.

Of course we got the line, ""well we have served a lot of Beef today and nobody has complained"". On checking with the other 7 people who had Beef at our lunch, none would have complained if I hadn't led the charge. Sadly Irish people are inclined to ""put up and shut up"" when it comes to poor quality food or service

Now in fairness to the hotel they did their utmost to put things right with the Roast Beef swapped out for the most tender of steaks and a bottle of Prosecco while we waited for the new plates of food. In addition other generous amends where made to save the day. Nonetheless it puts a damper on the day when over half the table have to wait for their main course while the remainder had enjoyed theirs. 

Apart from that sad episode the hotel and amenities are fantastic. The staff are very friendly and helpful and indeed we found the Food and Beverage Manager to be a really nice guy once he had moved on from his defense mode!

Some of the party overnighted in the hotel and we found the rooms of a very high standard and well equipped. 
 
A hiccup on what was otherwise great day, sadly",4,2016,06,02
238,Fantastic golfing weekend venue.,"Only 1 hour from Dublin centre this hotel and resort is set in a lovely area. Large hotel with 2 golf courses and spa.

Hotel reception were very friendly and although we were there early they took care of our luggage until we finished our first game of golf. The rooms are spacious, bright and well equipped. The bed was very comfortable. Bathroom was clean and soap, shampoo and shower gel supplied.
Coffee and tea making facilities in each room and also a safe.

The bar and restaurant are reasonably priced and the staff went out of their way to look after us. The food was excellent.

Of the 2 courses the Glen was by far the best with every hole being beautiful. It took 5 hours to get round but in such scenery that did not matter. Clubhouse is a bit odd but again service was good. A shuttle bus takes you to and from the hotel.

The Heath course is about 100 yards from hotel. The course itself is a bit exposed with lots of raided greens and at some places ropey fairways. It is a bit of a slog but still enjoyable.

I would recommend a visit here and in particular the Glen course. If you are going to play both courses play the Heath first otherwise you will be disappointed after playing the Glen first.

This is a delightful hotel in a lovely setting. Highly recommended.",5,2016,06,01
238,Golfing heaven and a great hotel for a family get together too.,"Completely agree with the previous reviews. Very comfortable stay, quiet and large bedroom, good bar menu and a decent breakfast. The staff, without exception, were all very friendly, helpful and polite. It's an ideal place for a wedding with plenty of function rooms and loads of space. And of course, a great place for a lads golfing weekend. We played the Heath course and my suggestion would be to bring lots of spare balls!

Couldn't fault it at all.",5,2016,05,31
238,Fantastic golfing paradise with a true service culture,"After watching a series vlogs on YouTube recorded at Druids Glen and Druids Heath, I decided to book our groups annual few days away golfing at Druids Glen Resort.  The trip was organised via Your Golf Travel and was made very easy with the hotel being completely ready for us when we arrived.  The staff were absolutely delightful and throughout our 3 days there could not do enough to ensure all of our needs were met in a friendly and efficient manner.

Both golf courses were presented in absolutely pristine condition and were found to be tough but fair challenges.  The practice facilities were also good with putting greens, short game areas and driving range.  Course marshalling was in place to ensure appropriate speed of play was maintained, but this was in no way obtrusive and was certainly fair and within more than reasonable expectation.  Although we had three days of warm sunshine, which is maybe a slightly rare commodity for this region in May, if I had to play only these courses for the rest of my days, I'm sure I would be an extremely happy man.

Overall, a great place run by great people.",5,2016,05,27
238,Great service and huge rooms,"Great resort. I was there for business but the hotel was full of senior golfers. Great service even if at breakfast it's quite slow to get the drinks but I imagine it's not an issue when you are there for leisure. My room was really huge, great bed. View on the golf. ",4,2016,05,26
238,Little bit of luxury,This was my 4th visit to Druids Glen. And each visit seems to get better if that's even possible. Dinner in the restaurant was such a delightful treat. The scallops starter was delicious followed by melt in the mouth perfectly cooked steak. All our party were very happy with the food and the waiting staff and bar staff just can't do enough for you. Even at breakfast a beautiful omelette cooked to order. It may cost the tiny bit extra but it's just sooooo worth it! Will be back next year I hope 😊,5,2016,05,24
238,Gorgeous Resort with a Beautiful Backdrop,"I recently visited Druid's Glen for a business meeting.  Traveling to Dublin quite frequently, I had never been to Co. Wicklow, and have now been spoiled on my first trip.  The drive in from Dublin airport was beautiful and scenic (even on the motorway) with the Irish countryside passing out the window.  We stopped at Avoca (the original) on the way for a bite to eat and arrived at Druid's Glen around 11 am.  Whereas our rooms were not yet ready, the hotel did wonderfully in accommodating an early check-in with my room ready at around 12:30,  I was staying in an Executive Suite which is absolutely exquisite.  It is essentially a four room suite which includes a living room, half bath, master bed and master bath.  The living room includes a working fireplace which warmed the room literally and figuratively.  The suite featured L'Occitane products in abundance.  The room was beautifully decorated with nice touches such as Walker Shortbread biscuits included with the varietal Nespresso collection.  Once you figure out how to work that machine, life is grand!

The grounds are lovely and include two golf courses, a playground, and several outdoor areas for mingling and lounging.  The onsite bar has a great drink selection, but the service was very slow- unsure if they were short staffed??  I did not personally partake of the golf course.  The folks in our party that did said that it was a challenging course, but not so difficult that is was not enjoyable for the novice golfer.  

I did book a massage in the spa when I was there.  It was good, not the best I've had nor the worst.  The fitness club is very well appointed and even offers a wide selection of complimentary fitness classes (Boot Camp, Cycling) in conjunction with paid classes (Yoga and Pilates).  They also offer personal training as well.",5,2016,05,24
238,6 star staff,"Had a really lovely girls night way at the Druids Glen. The hotel is lovely, clean and comfortable but the most notable thing is the incredible staff. I have never experienced a hotel where every member of staff I encountered made eye contact and appeared genuinely eager to assist. So impressive . Well done to all .",4,2016,05,22
238,Another great experience ,"This is our second visit to Druids Glen and it didn't disappoint.  We received a warm welcome, the room was spacious with a beautiful view of the golf course. We loved our time there and everything was perfect. Our children loved the den and the play area outside. We will definitely be back.",5,2016,05,21
238,It's the little things ,"It's the little things that made this hotel stand out from the pack. From the hot towels on arrival to the bottles of water as you check out. Don't forget the superb staff who from the moment you park make you feel welcome. 
We had a standard room which was large and well furnished. Great views (see my pictures) great remote location yet less than an hour from the airport. 
We have never eaten in the more formal restaurant preferring the casual relaxed atmosphere of the bar go for the conservatory with its large windows and great views.  
If I could have gotten out of the jacuzzi I could have had a swim in the nearby pool but......

All in all a little but of heaven and only an hour from Dublin. ",5,2016,05,21
238,Relaxing,Wonderful service. Staff smartly dressed and attentive. Bar food excellent. Menu choices could be a bit bigger. Breakfast beautiful with a selection of top quality food from pancakes to full irish. Bedroom spotless with lovely decor.  Highly recommended. ,5,2016,05,18
238,Had a higher expectation...,"I came across Druids Glen on LuxuryBreaks.ie so I guess I expected something that had a little bit more than your average hotel. The service was good and the staff were friendly but I wouldn't rate it as a 5 star - I base this on the up keep of the hotel and the finer attention to detail. When I was booking in my spa treatment the day before our arrival (over the phone) I was asked 3 times for my name in the space of a minute's phone call. It was a special occasion for my boyfriend's 30th and when I was booking the meal a couple of days beforehand I asked if they could add a candle to his dessert. It was met with ""you will have to say it on the day"" I just thought it was a little unprofessional. It takes nothing to put a note on a table booking. So the day we arrived I mentioned it again. When we had the meal the candle came out but it was on my dessert and ""happy birthday"" directed at me. When the waitress realised the error she pulled the candle out of my dessert at the table and put it into my BFs ice cream. It's not a big ask but these little things make a big impact when you are celebrating a special occasion. The food in Hugos was lovely and the grounds were great for walks.",3,2016,05,18
238,GOLF WEEKEND,We traveled down for a golf weekend. You will enjoy the golf course but If your looking to enjoy yourself in the bar you won't Beer is poor quality and over priced. The Staff in the Bar aren't very Polite.,1,2016,05,18
238,Superb,The whole visit. My niece (9)  has been with us 3 times and she was so excited to be telling her friend (11) who was coming with us this time.  The girl who turned down the covers gave them their mints and they ate ours too.  They loved the playground the playroom and especially the pool which we visited twice. We were a little disappointed with the Restaurant asThe Menu wasn't great for the kids  as my niece wanted Garlic Bread and Chicken Wings. So we left and went into the Bar. Even tho Garlic bread wasn't on the menu it was no problem getting it and it was gorgeous   We had a wonderful waiter Think it was Christopher   He was excellent and very pleasant   And we thoroughly enjoyed our meal. The girls were very excited when they saw the card and chocolates addressed to me.   it was from urself welcoming us back for another visit and Lucy remembered getting it before   We all wanted to stay another night.  And the girls wished it was Saturday when we got up and not Sunday !!  Two nights the next time I think !!!   Thanks a Million x   Oh an extra note. Both girls loved their brownies which we enjoyed when we arrived. They were delicious I was informed 😀😀,5,2016,05,17
238,Great for a girlie weekend getaway,"A bunch of us met up for a night away to catch up, treat ourselves to some pampering and have a really good meal. Druids Glen delivered! Great rooms, friendly efficent service with a smile and great food. If you're looking for a wild night out on the town it's not for you! While not there with the kids would love to try a family break...they even had kids sized robes...so cute!",4,2016,05,17
238,St Patrick's Day Stay,"Had a lovely stay with Family for birthday treat for our 10 year old daughter. 
All the Staff are terrific from the warm welcome and to all our needs looked after in particular by Patrick for entire stay.
Facilities for kids were excellent - games room and Kids Club and Driving range
Pool was clean, nice to see a plunge pool, of which I was the only one to brave that I could see
Room was clean and tidy and quite spacious 
Bathroom spotless
Only negatives found was that the bar food was expensive, a good 20% more for food  than normal but the staff were well informed on their cocktails.
For breakfast which was included in our package I was charged extra for my eggs benedict.
First time this has ever happened to me in any hotel I have ever stayed in.
Overall this didn't impact too much on our stay and we would return if staying in the area again

",4,2016,05,17
238,Wonderful hotel,"This is a great hotel in a lovely scenic location. Staff are very friendly and helpful. Food in the bar is good but the conservatory can be cold.
Hugo's restaurant is expensive but good food for special meal. 
Bedrooms are a good size and well serviced. No body lotion and limited shower gel which surprised me for 5 star. 
will certainly return.",5,2016,05,17
238,Superb Wicklow family hotel within easy driving distance to Dublin,"International welcoming and attentive staff, even upon arrival after midnight 😃. Spacious and quite rooms! Great breakfast buffet, nice turn down service and ... a lovely pool for the family to enjoy. I am sure that the spa, the gym and the golf course are great too. The bar is also nice, even for lunch with the family. We will definitely return. Still need to try Hugo's and the golf course 😉. 5-star service worthy! Thank you!!!!",5,2016,05,17
238,Family night away,Probably one of the nicest family hotel breaks I have been on. Shame it was only for one night. Amenities for the kids was brilliant. The food was excellent. The rooms were spacious and very clean. Lovely views and thank you for our break,5,2016,05,17
238,What a wonderful stay...,"Spent one night here with my sister on a getaway and really enjoyed ourselves. Only 45 mins from Dublin city centre (much closer to village of Kilcoole than anywhere else) but feels world's away. Staff are all engaging and helpful.

Went for a walk to the golf course which was longer than we anticipated but weather was lovely so all good.

Dinner was included & only a few things had supplements. Very tasty and good service - not brilliant on wine recommendation but otherwise faultless.

Didn't use spa but did take a dip in pool - part of leisure centre, clean and well equipped. All told would really recommend this place.",5,2016,05,17
238,Outstanding,"We stayed last week in this wonderful hotel. Setting was amazing - small winding country roads, entering through a manicured driveway up to the hotel entrance. As soon as we entered the hotel, we were acknowledged & greeted warmly. Check-in was quick & efficient. Room was spacious and clean and we had a wonderful nights sleep. We ate in the bar, food was delicious - although service personnel lacked the friendliness of others we encountered. I'm not one for reviewing properties but the main reason for writing this review is to outline the fantastic customer service we received from some members of the team. We have stayed in many countries, many hotels. Oli the bellman was attentive and informative, Patrick at breakfast was a barrel of fun & Amy at reception was just wonderful. She went above & beyond and is a wonderful example of outstandingly exceptional customer service - you are a gem. Our only regret is not staying longer. Next time!",5,2016,05,17
238,Fantastic Hotel,"We were fortunate enough to stay here as guests of a wedding over the weekend.  The hotel was really lovely and the staff were very helpful and welcoming.  We had previously stayed in this hotel about 11/12 years ago and it, like a good wine, has improved with age ! They really seem to be focussing on service and it shows.",5,2016,05,16
238,A luxurious escape,"We visited Druids Glen for the first time in January. I am very excited to come back as soon as I can as we loved it!

We arrived during a downpour on a Saturday evening and as we entered the hotel looking like 2 drowned rats, we were welcomed with hot towels, a warm welcome and our wet cases and umbrellas were taken straight to our room. This welcome was the perfect start to a perfect weekend!

Our room was beautiful. Modern, spotlessly clean, spacious, bright, luxurious. One of the nicest hotel rooms we have had. 

We ate in the bar as we didn't have a reservation for the restaurant. The bar food was OK. Next time I will make sure we get a restaurant reservation!

We were pleasantly surprised to find that on our return to our room we had been given a turn down service! We weren't expecting this and hadn't paid any extra for this lovely service and loved this little touch welcoming us back to our room!

Breakfast the next morning was fabulous! So much choice and the food was delicious. We were seated in a conservatory area and the sun coming through the windows made it a lovely experience. 

The hotel itself is lovely, seating areas with open fires are lovely to read in front of and just relax in the surroundings. 

This has been my favourite hotel in Ireland to date and I will be returning as soon as I possibly can!

I highly recommend giving Druids Glen a visit.",5,2016,05,15
238,Fabulous hotel,"Stayed with my husband and 8 month old 2 weeks ago for 2 nights. It was total bliss. Everything about our stay was fab. Room, food, the flexibility for kids (the play room they have is lovely). 
Had the most amazing massage in the spa. Thought i might float away afterwards.
Walks around the grounds are so well laid out and its so beautiful there. The hotel even sent a car t come and pick us up when it started raining heavily.
This hotel is a real treat if you want a romantic get-away... even with a baby!",5,2016,05,11
238,Fantastic child friendly hotel!,"My husband and I Stayed here for one night with our one year old baby. I cannot praised them highly enough,from we arrived they made us very welcome and the hotel is catered for children and all the staff especially the staff at breakfast made sure our son was attended to at all times,nothing was a problem!! Will definitely be back!",5,2016,05,09
238,Wonderful Wedding,"Attended a wedding here last week. It was marvellous. The hotel is fabulous.  So comfortable,clean and a pleasure to stay here. The wedding ceremony was perfect with all the planning that was put into the wedding clear to see. Food was delicious and  the staff were so efficient and professional while always having a smile And the bedrooms were spacious and comfortable. I couldn't fault it.",5,2016,05,09
238,Weekend Break,"Had a weekend break in the Druid's glen resort. We had re-scheduled from a previous booking which had been problematical and to be fair the hotel upgraded us at no charge to the superior room.

Bags were delivered to the room which was spacious with comfortable armchairs, a must if you're spending any time in it. Bathroom has an excellent shower and separate bath. Aircon system again is excellent in keeping good temperature control. Water, robes and slippers are provided complimentary which is a nice touch.

I had ordered papers for both mornings which I had not expected but were complimentary also

My wife had a SPA treatment which she was very happy with.

We ate both evenings in the bar as opposed to Hugo's restaurant. Service and food were excellent.

On the whole all one would expect from a 5* establishment this has been our second visit in under a year and I have no doubt we will return.",5,2016,05,09
238,Relaxingl aesthetic experience,"Had great two days with my family there as part of a spa package, the hotel was very nice when they couldn't accommodate our request and instead we had to rebook, our double room was upgraded to king free of charge. Everything was top notch, but do check your bill at check out, we had to pay again for a room service that was paid on the spot, my husband threw away the receipt. We initially chose Druid's Glen for its playroom facilities as we had a toddler with us, we weren't disappointed, it's a spacious room with many different toys to while away the time for the little ones. As well as a nice playground outside. Thank you!",5,2016,05,06
238,Birthday Golf with Jenny,"Absolutely fabulous place, treated like a King & Queen for one night. Played golf, ate and drank ( even some cocktails to finish). Such a nice place! Extravagant yet simple to accommodate everything. ""Mighty Meal"" was served in the main dining room. It was my birthday and I even got a bar of a song from the Manageress and Waiter off the Restaurant.. Had no problem leaving a Tip for such service. Oli the Concierge was such a cool and accommodating guy. WILL GO BACK. DEFO.",5,2016,05,05
238,We will definitely return. ,"Myself, my partner and our 7 month old son returned from Druids glen yesterday eve after a 2 day break,I don't think we have ever been as relaxed coming home as we were from this hotel. From start to finish it was pure relaxation and luxury. 
Our room was a fine size which is great with all the baby equipment we had in the room. Kevin is still talking about the comfy bed!!!
 On Sunday(which was a bank holiday) we went down to have a bite to eat in the bar with our son to be told we would have to go on a waiting list as it was so busy. We both were slightly annoyed as any parents of a toddler would be. We ended up taking a table in Hugo's but ordering of the bar menu. It took an age for anyone to come to us with menus and what not. By this stage we were both getting agitated this is where we met Patrick the food and beverage manager, he is a huge asset to the Druids glen team, I could literally have talked to him for hours. After chatting with him myself and Kevin said he had made up for our annoyance,his charm and friendly manner won us over and he didn't even know we were annoyed!!! (Patrick we think your out numbered and should go once more for the boy!!) 
The food in both the bar and Hugo's was top class we couldn't fault a single thing!! The cheese board is 10/10. 
The reception to the spa area wasn't anything amazing so I judged a book by its cover and assumed I wouldn't be blown away by the rooms or treatments... Never judge a book by its cover as the relaxation room is the perfect start, It's dark and cosy with juices, herbal teas and fruit. My therapist was young so I was expecting a little bit of inexperience but my god that girl knows how to root out tension. Probably one of the best messages I have ever had(and I have had plenty) the treatment rooms themselves are fab also. I have worked in 5 star spas before so it takes a lot to impress me and this spa and therapist certainly did(I can't remember her name sorry guys)

We walked to the golf clubhouse which was beautiful and family friendly again.

We will 100% return in the near future.",5,2016,05,04
238,3 Night Stay,"2nd visit to this hotel & never fails to deliver. Family friendly & staff most helpful. Quality visitor experience and will return again and again.Food in bar was fine but could have a greater variety of dishes. We love this hotel, one of our favourites for relaxing and recharging the batteries , top marks 😉",5,2016,05,04
238,Recent visit,"Nice enough hotel but didnt inform us that the 3rd occupant of the room would have a camp bed despite it being booked for 3adults at full price.  Breakfast was a disappointment also and certainly was not 5star, with cold bacon, mushrooms and eggs.",4,2016,05,02
238,Lovely breakaway,Just had a super night in The Druids Glen Hotel... Reception was most helpful and Becca had organised our room to our exact request.. Jason & Sophie in the bar gave great service even though they were kept extremely busy. Breakfast staff were very welcoming. Overall a lovely stay.,5,2016,05,02
238,Lovely 'warm' hotel,"We felt the five stars when we walked in the door at the reception. The staff were welcoming and friendly. We made our way to our room which was lovely and large with an even larger bed, so comfy. The hotel was so warm I had to get up in the middle of the night to turn on the air con, in May, in Ireland... Roasting! We decided to eat in the bar, the Hugo menu didn't appeal to my country gal pallet.. Food was good and averagely priced. The bar had live music and a nice calm atmosphere. The breakfast was served till 11,, it was lovely massive choice to suit everyone, served in a big airy restaurant, we really enjoyed it. After breakfast we went for a walk around the grounds because the sun was shining, then topped my morning off with a massage. Our time in the Druids glen was short but wonderful.   ",4,2016,05,02
238,Fab Food,"Just back from a 2 night stay. Had dinner in Hugo's on the Fri night which was delicious, the staff were really attentive and friendly. Breakfast was lovely- counter with chef making omelettes and pancakes, hot buffet, gluten free counter, everything was well stocked and breakfast was served until 11 which was a real treat. 
A couple next door woke us having a domestic on the Fri night and we had to ring night porter to ask them to keep it down. Was all sorted in a few minutes but there was a bottle of prosecco chilling in the room for us when we got in the next day. My sister got a little box of chocolates and happy birthday on her dessert plate, we got bottled water on check out and hot towels on check in so all those little touches were nice.
Three of us shared a room. Two queens and a fold out. Comfortable sized room. Separate bath and shower in bathroom. Lots of lovely nooks and crannies around the hotel. Would def stay again.",4,2016,05,01
238,3rd Visit and Still Fantastic!!!!!!,"Stayed there for 2 nights on Sunday 14th February. This is our 3rd visit to the hotel, and it still does not disappoint. Ticked all the boxes, beautiful location, fantastic room, great food, friendly professional staff. All in all another outstanding stay and we will be back!!!",5,2016,04,28
238,Great stay,"Great stay at Druids glen-staff were friendly and helpful. Rooms and hotel in general was spotless and we'll kept.Grounds were amazing it was a pity that we couldn't walk all the grounds as it is on the golf course.The pool was good but no separate kids pool and there was a lot of chlorine in the water.
Food was fabulous and to a great standard however some of the waiting staff were slow on one night deserts never came.the bar staff were slow and easily confused.
The kids club did fail to keep the kids entertained they only stayed an hour and came back still hungry.Assured by management that this was a rare occupancy and we were not charged for the kids club and we're very apologetic.
Overall fab hotel and great stay.",4,2016,04,26
238,Amazing Hotel- highly recommend ,"My mum took us all (6adults & 1child) away for her 60th birthday at the weekend. from start to finish the hotel was fantastic. We were greeted by a very friendly doorman, and then front desk staff were so welcoming. I asked for room change as it was a twin and would prefer a double, changed within 15minutes with no issues. The hotel surroundings and walkways are beautiful and the hotel is so relaxing. We dined in both bar and restaurant- they were both fab!! 10 out of 10! Staff really accommodated both our family birthdays on the Friday and Saturday night. My only flaw of the weekend, was the ridiculous amount of children who were running wild. It was very noisy in the bar on one of the nights because of the kids and a big group of golfers but overall a fantastic stay!! Can't wait to stay again! ",5,2016,04,25
238,Could be inproved,"Packed the swin suit and looking forward to having a swim not impressed arrived and Swimming pool is been painted so cant be used not told until check in, Hotel is okay on nice grounds but not a lot to do,",3,2016,04,25
238,Family stay at wonderful Druids Glen,"Just back from a family stay at Druids Glen - we loved it. I was looking for a hotel with a pool, initially in Dublin but found that you got very little value for money in Dublin - while expensive, Druids Glen offered a lot more for a similar price as some average hotels in Dublin.

The hotel is gorgeous inside and out - some lovely seating areas outside for when we are blessed with fine weather.

We booked a family room and found it to be very spacious - with two double beds and plenty of room for a cot. We loved the child size bathrobes for the kids - plenty towels provided in the room. The beds were super comfy and had great heating/cooling, loads of room in the en-suite with separate bath and shower. Our room was very near the leisure club which was great - nice pool and changing rooms. The pool is closed to kids from 12 midday to 3 - so that's something to be aware of, no issue for us - and good for the adults who want a nice quite swim. There is a great on-site playground and indoor play room - we used both each day and the kids loved them. Simple things make a big difference - like the kitchenette with microwave/steriliser/bottle-warmer, in-room fridge and plenty of bottled water provided. There was a DVD player in the room and DVDs available from reception.

The staff were lovely - they all made an effort with the kids.

We travelled to Dublin Zoo one day (an hours drive) which was great but there is loads to see in Wicklow - we would have had plenty to do if we were staying for another few days.

A few suggestions on areas for improvement - small things which would have made our stay perfect:
- There was no blanket provided in the cot (it was a comfy travel cot with a proper mattress though! - we had a blanket with us anyway but one should be provided)
- While we have no complaints about the food, prices were a little high for the kids meals (€8.50 for chicken and chips) and for simple things like tea (€3.50)
- There were no specials on the menu - some variety would be nice when dining from the same menu a few nights in a row. There is a good value early bird menu in Hugos but we only came across it be accident (we happened to dine at 7pm one night and the waiter kindly pointed the early bird option to us). Perhaps a mention of this option at check-in or within the in-room information would be useful for some visitors.

Overall though, a great hotel - certainly a 5 star experience and I really hope to return again in the future.",4,2016,04,24
238,Ireland's golfing Jewel ,"What a fantastic resort, the hotel is first class with excellent jovial staff who make the whole experience enjoyable. The rooms are spacious and well presented.
The golf courses attached are magnificent. Even after recent heavy rain the greens were true. 
Will certainly be returning 😃",5,2016,04,21
238,Golf trip away ,"We arrived on Saturday morning to find no reservations made at the pro but staff were accommodating and when we showed our confirmation e mail they apologised and set up tee times for both courses Saturday and Sunday as previously agreed. Make sure to have written confirmation of all arrangement. The Heath is a nice course but the Glen is a golfers paradise up with the best I have played anywhere. We stayed in the hotel,rooms are of very good standard.We had dinner in Hugo's restaurant even though the food was nice the waiting time for starter was not on over 45 minutes. The manager did compliment a bottle of wine for the delay. Overall not perfect but any mistakes were rectified professionally. Will stay here again and will definitely play the Glen any opportunity I get. ",5,2016,04,20
238,Perfect spot for a celebration,"We had a one night stay to celebrate my husbands 40th. From check in to check our, our stay was nothing short of perfect. a wonderful dinner too in Hugos restaurant with super service from our waiter Alwyn (could be spelled incorrectly) I must also commend Shelly in your reservations team who couldnt have been more helpful with our room choice.",5,2016,04,18
238,Great hotel,"We stayed at Druids Glen over spring break with the kids and absolutely loved it there. The staff could not have been more friendly and helpful. 

While I was checking the family in the bellman, Teague, realized the family might want something to drink and brought everyone something cold.  

When we were headed to Dublin for the day he advised us to consider taking the train instead of driving and dealing with the hassle of parking downtown and driving in the city. I'm glad he suggested it. 

The resort included breakfast. Everything was good with the exception of the omelets. The omelet maker still has a ways to go in terms of doing a great job. He was certainly nice just not good.   

The resort also included a kids game room and free DVD rental which the kids enjoyed. We would absolutely stay here again. Great staff and experience. ",5,2016,04,17
238,Best family hotel,"We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights over easter with our 7 years old daughter.  Hotel was beautiful, rooms really well presented and staff so friendly and helpful. Couldn't fault this hotel at all, the activities for the children were fab, our daughter had a great time and even won a giant easter egg! Can't wait to go back again. ",5,2016,04,16
238,Relaxing Family break,"We stayed here with a young toddler for one night only.  Would love to visit again.

The hotel rooms were very well proportioned and plenty of space for a travel cot.  The décor is modern and well equipped with DVD player, tea and coffee making etc.  The hotel offers a baby room where you can store food in the fridge, sterilise bottles and microwave.  They even supply emergency nappies and food.  There's also a play room where DVD's are playing and lots of toys for different age groups are available.  

The hotel has a lovely pool and offers family changing rooms.

We had dinner in the lounge and it was very relaxing and the staff were very attentive and even looked after the little one for food.  Breakfast was a feast and we all enjoyed the variety of food on offer.  There was so much choice available and a high chair was easily arranged.

We would definitely return here again",5,2016,04,15
238,Outstanding dinner ,"We called at Druids Glen Hotel and decided to have dinner. And we certainly were not disappointed! A wonderful meal with exceptional service by Mauve. A very friendly and efficient server and when she heard we were celebrating my birthday,made it extra special by producing a very beautiful plate of dessert complete with candle! We will definitely return,preferably to stay next time!",5,2016,04,13
238,Great for family weekend escape,"This hotel is great to escape for the weekend with children, the kids club arrangement during dinner hours is good - children and parents very happy!

The setting is beautiful and the rooms well appointed, they cater for the whole family really well.

We were not a fan of the fine dining here as the menu was pretty much the same each night.",4,2016,04,12
238,Perfect weekend break,"I stayed 3 nights at Druids Glen over a weekend that could have been very difficult for me on a personal level.  From the moment I approached the door to the moment I left I could not fault the attention, helpfulness and cheerful service I received.  The spa treatments were perfect, the bar friendly and the restaurant accommodating with excellent food. Everyone went that extra mile to make me feel welcome and cared for.  The setting is beautiful, even if like me you are not a golfer (if you are it is paradise!). I cannot recommend Druids Glen enough.  Thank you for a lovely weekend.",5,2016,04,11
238,"Stunning Hotel  , Tucked away in the garden of Ireland !","This hotel is a find indeed!
The staff shine in this place from the very moment you arrive to this resort!
for Meetings for business , Lunch with the ladies or a romantic getaway this is the place.
Amazing rooms and suits , buzzing bar with fab food and everything else.
Weddings in this hotel are second to none - the pride of work and service is mint
there is nothing this hotel can't do for you!!
not to missed!!",5,2016,04,10
238,Perfect place for a break,"we spent a weekend in the hotel as a city break ! We high suggest this hotel for the large room, the relaxed atmosphere. Perfect for couple looking for relax just outside Dublin. There is also a nice walk around the hotel",4,2016,04,08
238,Almost perfect,"Just returned from my annual visit to Druids Glen to visit relatives in the area. Two years ago it was perfection and on my return last year l had a few issues which needed resolving so this year l arrived not knowing what to expect. Excellent staff, wonderful welcome, fantastic room, great food however, the hotel was very hot and stuffy and the wonderful breakfast was slightly spoiled by having to wait almost an hour from ordering to its arrival. Will l be back next year - without doubt, like most people l have fallen under the spell of Druids Glen",5,2016,04,07
238,"Hurray to the ""A"" Team!!","The ""A""  team at Reception Services/Concierge, Amy and Adrienne, were on top of their game with friendly yet professional & courteous service during our recent stay at the lovely Druids Glen Resort.  They truly made our stay memorable and we are grateful for their dedicated work and welcoming spirit. Loved the moist scented cloths and daffodils we were treated to upon arrival. We enjoyed our entire stay and could not have asked for more.  A special treat was to open our balcony doors and hear the sheep on the hillside. Entire staff was remarkable!",5,2016,04,06
238,Not a 5-star experience. Living on reputation I'd say.,"Myself and my girlfriend stayed here for a night last weekend. We had a lovely time but this is definitely NOT a 5-star hotel or experience and I wanted to flag that to potential visitors who may be expecting a true 5-star experience (along the lines of The Europe in Kilarney).

It felt like a decent 4-star at best:
- Service was desperate in the bar
- Food was mediocre for the prices (chunky chips were over cooked and greasy)
- Had a terrible sleep as room was roasting even with lowest A/C level set
- Pool/Spa area is like an average Leisure Center (no class)

Overall, we had a nice time but it's important to know that you're probably not getting the experience you're hoping for in this '5-star'.

We will 100% not be returning to this hotel.

Hope that helps,
Stephen",3,2016,04,05
238,Can't wait to go back!,"We have just returned from a 2 night weekend break in the stunning Druids Glen.  The hotel had been highly recommended by friends and it certainly didn't disappoint. There is a lovely welcoming atmosphere in the hotel, the staff are so friendly and chat like you are a regular customer (Patrick and the Concierge were just so lovely to chat to and enjoyed their 'craic').  This is a 5* hotel and it certainly lives up to that, delicious food and beautifully decorated and spacious rooms.  The hotel spa is definitely worth a visit.  The hotel is set amongst beautiful grounds for walking and golf - unfortunately our Irish weather didn't allow us to make use of them but it just allowed us to take the time relaxing in the hotel.  The resort is handy to neighbouring towns and attractions.  I couldn't fault the hotel in any way and would highly recommend it.  Looking forward to returning to Druids!",5,2016,04,04
238,Really good break,Just back from quick break with two kids here. Hotel hits a good balance between adult & child friendly. Bar food good & service though slightly slow was acceptable. Swimming pool was very busy though spotlessly clean. During our visit there were lots of young kids there who all seemed very happy. Perhaps a few more teenage focused facilities would be good. The hotel is very well kept and I would definitely return.,4,2016,04,03
238,Beyond five star,"Fabulous hotel in amazing grounds, surrounded by two golf courses. Lovely dingly dell (glen) running past hotel. Some limited walking paths available - most ""out ofbounds"" - due to golf; nonetheless, delightful. Impeccable staff at all levels - doormen, reception, waiters, bar staff, cleaners etc. Nothing too much trouble. Excellent breakfast choice including gluten free.  Bar and restaurant well appointed - much of the space surrounded by glass with open views of the glen. Comprehensive menus. Outdoor seating available (not used on this visit due to time of year). Five minutes from N11, forty minutes from Dublin Port. Wicklow, Greystones, Bray just around the corner. Plenty of parking and an easy offloading area for luggage at reception.",5,2016,04,02
238,"Very enjoyable, I'd definitely go back. ","My husband and I stayed for 2 nights after Easter. The hotel was full but didn't feel over crowded. There is a lovely atmosphere at Druids Glen, it is luxurious but relaxed. 

The staff were all very friendly and welcoming in every department.  We enjoyed breakfast and had dinner one of the nights in the bar which was nice.  

I had a great spa treatment, the gym and pool were good too. There's a nice walk to the golf club and enjoyable places to visit in the surrounding area. 

I can't fault the place at all and would recommend Druids Glen to anyone, whether it's for a romantic weekend, a family holiday or a couple of days away with the girls. I'd definitely go back! ",5,2016,04,01
238,Absence makes the heart grow fonder….,"Right, well I suppose this really isn’t a review by definition as I haven’t been to Druids Glen in a year & a half. (Some of the fields in this form have to be filled in...)What hit me this weekend after visiting yet another property is, I really, really want to go back.  We are luck to book our family for a few nights away 2-3 times a year. In last few years we have been to Druids Glen twice, also spent time in Westport, Belfast, Kilkenny, Dublin, and others.  I can tell you that whenever a conversation comes up with friends or co-workers about getting away for a few days we have always recommended DG highly.   Hands up, I have to confess it’s my own fault we haven’t been back, my wife will always ask “Do you want to go back to DG?” My reply is “There are so many places I haven’t been yet so lets go someplace else…”  What I can say for sure is the after visiting several other places, nothing compares to Druids Glen.  Now, I have reviewed DG in the past, I recall not being too impressed with the food though I did leave good reviews otherwise.  I can now confirm that whatever my issues were with the food, no other place has distinguished itself in any better way food-wise than DG.  I suppose it gets expensive hanging around DG all day relaxing as drinks & grub etc are a bit pricey compared to other hotels but I'm a believer that you get what you pay for so it turns out it is well worth it.
  I can also confirm that no other place even comes close to being as great in every other way as Druids Glen. The service and staff are excellent, the surroundings are fantastic. Nearby things to do are grand as well. Our 2nd time was on a birthday trip & we got upgraded to a lovely suite at end of hall that was unreal, we felt very spoiled.  Now, every other place we visit I have to hear (and think to myself) comments like, “this room isn’t as nice as that suite at DG”,,or ”the wine list here isn’t as nice as DG’s"" ""The setting is not as nice"".. etc. Seemingly,  Druids Glen isn’t a great place to take kids (we have 2 under 10…) as they don’t have a play park, or a petting zoo, or go-carts like other places do. But, kids seem to absolutely love it there. We remember fondly afternoons spent on the outside deck area & evening in the lobby drinking wine & chatting with new-found friends as loads of kids ran about.       What can I say, there are plenty of beautiful towns and sights around this Island but in our experience there are darn few hotels as good as this one. Next time when my wife asks if I want to return to Druids Glen, the answer will be a big YES…",5,2016,03,31
238,Brillian,"We really enjoyed our stay and found the hotel very family friendly... Long family pool times, playground, and a parents kitchen with bottle sterilisers was a really great touch. Staff were very friendly and helpful and restaurants spacious allowing us room to manoeuvre the pram.

Good choices at breakfast also and loved the addition of baby veg bowls on the room service menu.

The only thing we found was the pool was a bit cool on Sunday and Monday... But on Tuesday there was a remarkable difference in temperature.. Much warmer..... Not sure if someone had complained or what but Tuesday's pool temp was much better for the kids. Would have liked a baby pool also

Will definitely return.",5,2016,03,30
238,All on all not a bad place to stay,Stayed over a busy easter weekend so it was manic when we arrived. Some confusion over our booking which took some time to sort out . Rooms were a good size and 4 of us (2 adults and 2 kids) fit perfectly without issue. Rooms were well fitted out and very clean. Food was good but for 5 star hotel prices was only good. Pool and leisure areas need work as they are dated. It would be a good 4 star resort but for the cost of a 5 star I struggle to see how I got value for my money. ,3,2016,03,29
238,Amazing Hotel!,"We stayed here for 2 nights over the Easter break. Can honestly say this is by far our favourite hotel now and we have stayed in alot! Staff are so friendly and helpful. Our family room was roomy and decorated tastefully. Huge bathroom with gorgeous L'occataine products. Food in the bar was top notch. A higher standard than usual pub grub. Huge choice for breakfast and everything of a high quality. Pool was lovely. Changing rooms were spotless, bright and modern. Beautiful surroundings with a lovely walk around the golf course. Kids den and playground for kids. All in all we had an amazing time and will definitely be back again.",5,2016,03,29
238,"Great stay at a lovely hotel, Thanks for the personal touches!","Stayed at the hotel for 1 night on a Friday for my girlfriends birthday. We arrived and were immediately greeted by the lovely porters. 

We checked in and had to wait a little for our room to be ready, which wasn't a problem in the slightest. We took a brief walk around the lovely grounds which the hotel is on. 

Once the room was ready, we received a phone call from reception to notify us. Upon entering the room, we noticed the personalised greeting on the table welcoming us to the hotel and wishing my girlfriend a happy birthday, this was a lovely touch which added to the experience overall. 

We sat down for dinner at 8:30pm in Hugo's restaurant. Loic was our waiter and he was an absolute gentleman and we made it our business to get his name before writing this review. 

The service was excellent, the starter came our very quickly but I must admit the main course was rather slow to come out. We didn't mind this too much however, and when it did come out it was worth the wait. We both had the fillet of beef which was gorgeous, and cooked to perfection.

After the meal we went to the bar for a few drinks while enjoying the live music which was in the bar. 

On the Saturday morning we went down for breakfast, the buffet was one of the best we had ever experienced in a hotel. Great selection and great quality food. 

Thanks for the lovely stay to everyone @ Druids Glen! We'll be back!",5,2016,03,28
238,Hotel and Spa,"We had a 2 night stay with young kids during the Easter break. Very family friendly and the Kids Club (only during school holidays) was great. 

Room was fairly standard (nothing special)

Bar was a good size but got very full with families (no surprise there)

Pool and spa were a bit dated in my opinion. Steam room was ""cosy"" putting it politely. 

There's a decent playground for the kids as well. 

Food was ok - nothing special considering it is apparently 5 star. ",4,2016,03,28
238,Excellent,"Currently staying at this gorgeous hotel.  Excellent service and staff are amazing.  However I appreciate it's Easter but I've just had dinner in the bar with children running around and screaming, we purposely go to dinner late as according to the hotel info children are welcome in the bar until 9pm...this was 9.30pm. This would be OK if adults were welcome to eat in the conservatory area but they aren't.  Also turn down seems to vary on what exactly happens, sometimes water is replaced and dirty cups replaced and sometimes not.  I appreciate these sound like minor things but this is a 5* hotel.  I reiterate it is an amazing place and love it!",4,2016,03,27
238,Nice Hotel,"Visited here for the first time recently, it's nice as you go through the gates but the apartments in the grounds spoil the effect. The main building is nice but hide the luxury you expect and find as you enter the hote. It is very classy and impressive, the staff are very attentive as your would expect. We had some nice coffees sitting on the comfortable sofas in the sunken section of the lobby beside the lovely open fire. Will be back again.",4,2016,03,27
238,Second time and il be back again,"I was here a few years ago with work but I spent Easter weekend here with my parents. It really is heaven here. Tranquility and luxury in one! We thoroughly enjoyed the hotel and all of its features. From the gentleman at the front door who took my car and parked it, to the lovely housekeeping people, each and everyone of you made this weekend everything I thought it would be and more. My mam and I were lucky enough to go to the Spa also, the ladies in there were top class too. Druids Glen deserve their 5 stars and more. Each and every one of the staff in this hotel are so nice and helpful. It is worth every penny! Well done! ",5,2016,03,27
238,A Huge Let Down,Visited Druids Glen last week on recommendation from work colleagues. What a let down. Reception staff lacked interpersonal skills as did staff in Hugo's Restaurant. No atmosphere in hotel. Food was tepid and service extremely slow. It was also  cold in the restaurant. At a loss as to how this hotel has a 5 star rating. Won't be back!!!,2,2016,03,26
238,5star even before I get there ,A quick review to thank the reservation staff who accommodated a late cancellation due to family circumstances. Changed the booking to an alternative date at no extra cost. Looking forward to staying with you and thanks again. ,5,2016,03,26
238,Second visit,"I reviewed Druids Glen in 2014 and enjoyed it then with a few caveats. We visited again a few days ago, this time with our 6-year old grandson, for one night. The rate for the room was very good and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Our grandson had a great time what with swimming, the driving range, the playground and the playroom. The hotel is wonderful for children (and Granny and Grandad really loved it too!) Our room was spacious and spotlessly clean, all food was very nice and the staff could not have been more friendly and helpful. Our grandson's verdict was that he wants to go back, next time with ourselves and his mum, dad and sister - I'll be happy with that!",5,2016,03,26
238,3rd child surcharge!,"I had never stayed in Druids Glen before and I was looking for somewhere nice for my wife and our 3 children (6 year old, 5 year old & 4 month old). A search on line led me to Druids Glen and it seemed to fit our needs and expectation so I booked a family room for 2 adults and 2 children through Booking.com. A day later I got an email asking me to call the hotel to confirm my children's ages. So I called and gave the ages of our 3 children. When I mentioned a third to the receptionist I was offered a second room. I explained that a 2nd room was not necessary because or 3rd child was just 4 months old and hardly occuppies any space at all. Again a 2nd room was proposed and then I  realised that we were not going to be able to stay unless I booked a second room. I asked how much extra the 2nd room would be. €260 for 2 nights. I said that it was absolutely unacceptable that I was expected to pay an extra €260 just because we would have a 4 month old with us. I explained that I felt the hotel was exploiting larger families and that I would be bringing my business elsewhere  but I got  no satisfaction even after speaking to a supervisor.  I subsequently booked the Amber Springs in Gorey with no '3rd child surcharge'  and we had a fantastic time.",1,2016,03,25
238,Locations is gass!,"Not sure why it's a 5* hotel for me it's a stable 4*, spa services at not at the highest level but the over look is ok. Food.. Food is georgeous, lamb is just perfect choice. And the restaurant staff is making this place warm and I can't say this about reception staff. Reception staff are not bad not good they remind me robots.",5,2016,03,24
238,Excellent hospitality,"I stayed in Druid's Glen with my family on St .Stephen's night last year. It was a family reunion over Christmas. We had a fantastic time. We had a number of requests and the staff were so obliging and accommodating. The rooms are really luxurious and comfortable. We had a fabulous view. The hotel is really nicely decorated over Christmas with a really nice atmosphere. Most of all though, I can't speak highly enough of the staff who are really professional and friendly. I highly recommend to others.",5,2016,03,24
238,Great spot,"Stayed with colleagues, room was terrific. Ate at the bar for dinner, very good.  Staff was fun and entertaining.  Played 9 holes and golf course was also magnificent. 
Bathroom was very nicely decked out. Bed was comfortable.  The Wicklow area in general is beautiful. Also visited the Glendalough distillery while there. Great whiskey. ",5,2016,03,23
238,Excellent as always,"Got married in Druids Glen 4 years ago and recently went back to stay the night and have dinner for our anniversary. From what I can tell not much has changed, they are maintaining a very high level of service throughout the hotel and even improved in some places. We used the spa, had dinner in Hugo's restaurant and had a few drinks in the bar. It was a truly memorable stay. In particular dinner in Hugos was amazing and they even gave us a complimentary glass of champagne each. I believe our servers name was Maeve. We look forward to going back again soon.",5,2016,03,22
238,Anniversary Dinner,"I decided to have dinner in Druids Glen Hugo restaurant for my Anniversary, it was a bit dissapointing as the waiters forgot to bring a spoon and bread for soup, they never brought our sorbet after our starter, the waiters just looked confused as to what they were doing, it was not a very friendly service, my beef was nice however my wife couldnt eat her Chicken the taste was not good, i also tasted it and it was a very odd taste, so for a special night the food was a let down😕",2,2016,03,21
238,Bar Food,"Popped in to The Thirteenth Bar at Druids Glen Resort for a late lunch recently. From start to finish, I couldn't fault a thing. Although it was busy, there was a lovely relaxed atmosphere created by an excellent presence of management who were so welcoming and clearly had everything under control. Staff were extremely friendly and service was prompt. The food was fabulous - I opted for  the 'Grilled Cuban Mojo Spiced Chicken Breast' which was served on toasted ciabatta with a gorgeous blue cheese mayo and red onion jam (absolutely delicious) while my friend ordered the beef burger (the smoked cheese in this really makes it special). This was my first visit to Druids Glen and I am already planning my next! I would highly recommend it to anyone. Such a beautiful setting - there is a wonderful sense of countryside yet it's just 20 minutes from city centre.",5,2016,03,19
238,Excellent stay will return ,"Just returned from a 2 night stay at the druids glen.   Had a wonderful time. Great staff, beautiful surroundings inside and out, excellent facilities for children pool and games room.  Food excellent too.  Loved it so much that we have booked to stay again in October.  Couldn't fault anything!!!",5,2016,03,19
238,Birthday Weekend ,"I stayed here on Sunday 21st February 2016. I really enjoyed my stay. The room itself was fabulous, I adored the decor, it was very Irish/Celtic with a modern French twist. I loved it, it was so relaxing and peaceful. The bed was very comfy. 

The pool/changing facilities were extremely clean and tidy. My boyfriend loved the plunge pool!!

Breakfast was simply wonderful. My boyfriend kept going back for more pancakes! The brown (treacle?) bread was amazing. I actually snuck 2 slices into my bag to have later. It was the nicest bread I'd ever eaten.  
 
We ate in the bar on Sunday night. This was the only aspect of our stay that let us down. We were waiting ages for our drinks to be served, he ordered a Bulmers and I got a coke, basic orders. Another long wait for our food to arrive, it was worth the wait. Plenty of staff walking around but nobody thought to ask us if we wanted dessert. We decided against it in the end as we didn't fancy another long wait. The staff were nice and professional but lacked genuine warmth. Not quite 5 star. ",5,2016,03,15
238,Heaven - didnt want to check out,"From start to finish, this hotel stay was pure luxury. My husband and I stayed here to celebrate my birthday, and we were made feel special. The spa is glorious, pool and leisure centre a treat, the food is excellent. It's a more expensive hotel, but very much five star luxury. Cant wait to go back.",5,2016,03,15
238,Fantastic.,"Stayed here for the first time in February and will definately return. Couldn't fault one single thing from the moment we arrived to when we left. Friendly welcoming staff, comfortable and luxurious rooms. Afternoon tea was delicious. Had dinner in Hugo ' s and was very impressed with quality of food and staff. One of the nicest meals I've ever had. Breakfast was superb there was so much choice, great selection of fresh pastries and breads. Plenty of hot food options too. Really enjoyable trip and can't recommend enough. Thank you.",5,2016,03,14
238,We Will Be Back.,"We stayed here just before Christmas. The festive decorations were lovely! When we arrived we were greeted by the bellhop to get our bags and some lovely warm flannels for our hands at reception, very nice touch. Our room was just perfect, the bed was amazing and we have not encountered a room just quite as nice! 

Breakfast was phenomenal. They had so much to choose from PLUS a chef making fresh pancakes and omelettes. To date the best breakfast I have ever had. We dined in the restaurant Hugos, again lovely. 

Overall the experience was definitely perfect except for two things...

1, the lunch included with spa treatments in the bar 13 is very poor. Not worth the money at all.

2, the spa rooms are very cramped and mine wasn't too clean. Also my partners spa therapist got oil into his eyes which left them red and sore all day! :(

The staff were lovely and when my Fiancee proposed the hotel bought us two glasses of complimentary champage which was so thoughtful.

We will be back!",4,2016,03,14
238,Fabulous Hotel ,Stayed here for 2 nights. Room was huge with two queen sized beds. Lovely big bathroom with bath and walk in shower. Chocolates on your pillow and the bed turned down. Gorgeous wooded area to walk in. Didn't use the leisure area but other guests said it was great. Staff really friendly and helpful. Food was  expensive but  worth it. Great choice for breakfast so give yourself plenty of time to enjoy it. Obviously it's expensive as it's 4 star but it lives up to it.,5,2016,03,12
238,Exceptional Hotel in County Wicklow,"This was my third stay at Druid's Glen alongside some of my family who were visiting for the first time. This is a stunning hotel, in beautiful surroundings and we all thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Cosy, comfortable rooms with lovely views, a really relaxing place to unwind for a few days. 

We chose to do a spa day for Mothers Day and we all agreed it was probably some of the best treatments (massage & facials) we've ever had. The spa therapists were extremely knowledgeable and the facilities are of a very high standard. A particular mention had to be made to my therapist Carmen who was superb. 

Although the food is excellent no matter where you dine in the hotel, Hugo's restaurant was definite highlight. Delicious food, stylishly presented and fantastic staff.

However it is the staff throughout the entirety of Druids Glen that really make this beautiful hotel a great place to stay. Warm, welcoming, friendly and genuine - there's a real authenticity behind their excellent customer service.

We can't wait to come back and visit again",5,2016,03,12
238,Social,"I stayed one night and had use of facilities and dinner as well as breakfast
It really was a lovely stay and the setting is fabulous but the hotel itself from the outside is rather underwhelming for a 5* star hotel
Having said this the pool is lovely and the rooms really spacious and comfortable (superior twin)
The dinner was really delicious and there were about 4 different vegetarian choices which is amazing. I had the pasta and it was divine but the only criticism I had was that they had Parmesan on the the top of the rocket and this makes it non vegetarian !
The service was brilliant and the waiters (all men) were terrific
I think it could out to be really an expensive place but if you shop for offers you can do good like I did (£119 for the superior twin room, check in by 4pm, dinner and use of spa facilities, breakfast and check out by 12 which gives you a chance to use spa facilities again)
Would definitely go back again and recommend highly.",5,2016,03,11
238,Holiday break with my Daughter,"I had a great two days with my Daughter at this Hotel.  Excellent staff, food, and spa treatments.  They could not do enough for us.  I could not fault the experience we had.    We will definitely be returning to this Hotel again in the future.",5,2016,03,06
238,Brilliant,"We had a family birthday here. What a great time we had! The fact we had a wee granddaughter who had a ball here made it for us. They are so good with children with play areas, both inside and out and even a plastic duck for her in her room. We had brilliant meals here to although I would rate the bar meals a bit better than the main Restuarant. It was busy but we never had a problem and the staff were lovely especially the concierge. 
The grounds a nice and the rooms large with a fridge which is very handy especially with a little one. There is a kitchen stocked for baby stuff too. I feel I am making a lot of its child friendliness but that's what made it really special for us.",5,2016,03,03
238,Golfing trip,"Disappointing trip to Druids glen, spent 3nights here. Food extremely good , staff not so friendly although some were helpful. Bathroom not up to 5 star standard. We had a rainy day no golf, hung around the hotel a bit. Table overflowing in the bar we had to clean if off though lots of staff and a manager on duty. ",3,2016,03,01
238,Mid term break,This is a superb hotel for seasonal getaways.staff make a fuss over the kids giving them a welcome pack and a selection of dvds to borrow.kids club was popular and well attended.food is great.pool area also good.rooms spacious.highly recommend,5,2016,02,29
238,Amazing stay in Druids Glenn,Our stay in Druids Glenn at Valentines weekend was absolutely amazing. The check in was quick and efficient. Our room was upgraded to the Presidential Suite which was such a nice surprise! The Suite was absolutely fabulous and had a fire place in the middle of the room. Dinner at Hugo's Restaurant was delicious and we really enjoyed it. Breakfast had a great selection. The staff was very welcoming and attentive. Would definitely recommended.,5,2016,02,29
238,Lovely Hotel and Spa,Stayed recently with a group of friends.  Rooms are gorgeous and beautifully decorated.  Had an amazing facial treatment in the Spa.  Staff are so pleasant and courteous.  Would highly recommend the hotel to friends and family.,5,2016,02,29
238,Wonderful Hotel and Staff,"Stayed one night with a group of friends. The location and hotel is beautiful. The rooms are spacious and comfortable.The food is fab and the staff very friendly and attentive. The spa area is really tranquil with a great choice of treatments. The deep tissue massage that I had was great. Breakfast was available until 11am but the staff was very accommodating as we lingered over coffees and papers. Lovely touches like the availability of papers and magazines, and the provision of water on check out was a welcome and surprising touch. I will definitely be back and I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,02,28
238,Short weekend break ,"Hi,

Amazing and relaxing family break.
Staff were immensely friendly and obliging, they couldn't do enough for us.
Room was spacious and comfortable. 
Pool was good.
Surroundings were lovely and great way to digest the over indulgence of the delicious breakfast buffet served with some local natural product, example the honey.

I would greatly recommend it. 
",5,2016,02,27
238,First time visitor and will be definitely back!!!,"Stayed here for one night with my wife arriving 22/2/16. Had booked a break through web site pigsback.com. This allowed for spa credits, credit for Hugo's restaurant etc. The hotel is located about twenty minutes from the south of Dublin close to the towns of Greystone and Newtown Mount Kennedy County Wicklow. There are two championship golf courses Druids Glen and Druids Heath and while I do not play golf myself the two courses looked fantastic and a fantastic setting for the hotel. From the start to the end of our stay I was impressed with the level of service and genuinely felt welcomed to the hotel. Our room was extremely spacious, warm and comfortable. I was impressed that the towels used when we showered at teatime were replaced the same evening. What we liked best was the standard of service and food in Hugos restaurant excellent!!!. Breakfast was a la crate and cooked to order.There is gym, pool and spa and again I have no complaints. Hope to be back soon.",5,2016,02,24
238,"Fab hotel, love it here.","I love this hotel, staff are friendly and service is excellent. Rooms are spacious and have lovely extras like magazines, bottled water etc. Food is very good. The walk to the golf club is lovely and worth doing. Will be back very soon.  I can highly recommend this hotel.  ",5,2016,02,24
238,Romantic break ,"This was our second stay and have to say we just love it perfect getaway for my husband and I for my birthday 
We were there in may with our daughters and they were so kid friendly 
My wee girl took sick at breakfast and the staff was so amazing and attentive and even give us bags water etc for journey home in case she was sick again 
We can't wait to return 
",5,2016,02,24
238,Revitalised,"We stayed here on a girly mid-week break. We were looked after instantly on arrival. The staff were fantastic throughout our stay. We started with coffee and scones in the beautiful dinning area looking over the gardens, followed by a swim (no children between 12-3 AMAZING!) and then up to the spa for a great way to end our day. We were so relaxed from the day we couldn't make it down to dinner so had to get room service! The next morning we just about made breakfast and I am glad we did, it is one of the best breakfasts I have had in a hotel in Ireland, they have a fantastic range.",5,2016,02,24
238,Another wonderful stay. ,"This is our third visit to this wonderful hotel and once again it didn't disappoint. Everything was simply perfect the staff in the kids club are brilliant and we had a lovely evening in the bar, a special mention to Frankie who was so courteous and friendly, two weeks into the job and a credit to the place. Breakfast as usual was just yummy with a huge selection to choose from, our children in particular love the buffet aspect. Check out was easy with a special mention to Teague who is just lovely taking the time to talk to our children and ever so helpful. We will definitely  be back to this fantastic hotel where we are always made to feel special right from the time we book with the ever helpful Romy with her extremely helpful and timely replies. ",5,2016,02,23
238,More than 4 star but not quite 5.....,"I stayed here with my two daughters and baby grandson on a Sunday night in February. On arrival at 1pm one of our rooms was ready and we were able to check in. We then had lunch in the bar which was very good. Afterwards we went to the swimming pool and this is where the hotel showed itself as a 4 star family resort rather than a 5 star. We did go during children's hours as we had a baby ourselves.  We were prepared for lots of kiddies splashing about but experienced something a bit more extreme. One family had ""taken possession "" of the pool. The adults were literally throwing their children from one side of the pool to the other making it practically impossible for others to use the facilities. When not being launched by their parents the children were jumping and diving.  It was well signed that there was no lifeguard on duty but there seemed to be cctv so one would have expected someone to have approached the offenders. It was also well signed that diving was not allowed. I would not fora moment suggest that a hotel is responsible for other people's children but they do have a responsibility to ensure that everyone has a pleasant experience. Everything else was fine, dinner, breakfast and the room. Very comfortable beds. The grounds are extensive and beautiful. Reception provided me with a walking map but I still managed to get a bit lost! More signage for walkers would be helpful. Enjoyed my time at Druids and would like to return
",4,2016,02,23
238,Caught under the spell of druids glen,Just back from a 2 night stay .excellent service from start to finish kids enjoyed all that was to offer from pool to kids room and nature all around staff on their game in all departments. Can't wait to return with clubs .,5,2016,02,19
238,Top class,"Second visit to this hotel and just as impressed as last time.  

Staff at check in were very personable and helpful as were the restaurant staff.  Spa treatment for the lady was apparently out of this world and Bushra has to be commended for her expertise.

The main restaurant has changed name since our last visit,  it's now ""Hugo's""  but essentially it's just the same,  nice ambience, lovely staff and delicious food. 

The Druids Glen 18 holes was a joy to play and the course was in tip top condition.  

Highly recommended and hopefully will be back sooner rather than later.",5,2016,02,18
238,Great family break,"I cannot commend this place enough. We are having an exceptional good time, the staff cannot do enough. The food and drink are great. The rooms and facilities here are fantastic and absolutely no need to leave the grounds. The kids were kept entertained. A 5star hotel, adapts to family needs with ease.....you don't see that too often. Hats off to you",5,2016,02,18
238,Amazing,"Spend valentines weekend here and had a wonderful time. 
Beautiful hotel set in a fantastic location – spacious rooms, great value for money in a 5 star setting.
Special note to the food in the bar and restaurant, it is of the highest quality possible, 10 out of 10.
Hotel was really busy with a great atmosphere and staff are first class also",5,2016,02,17
238,"Great hotel, service and food!","We've just got back from a two night stay at the Druids Glen. 
From the minute we arrived we loved it. The staff were fantastic and made us and our two children most welcome. 
Room was immaculate and very comfortable. 
We used all the facilities and don't have a negative word to say about any of them. 
The breakfast was probably one of the best we've had despite having stayed in far more expensive hotels. The selection of food, quality of food and room where it was  served was excellent. 
We will definitely be booking to go there again.",5,2016,02,17
238,Not a 5 star.,"I bought this package for myself and my partner as a post-valentines getaway. We enjoy 5-star quality hotels, but based on our experience here, we would not consider this hotel to be of 5-star quality. We received a warm welcome from the porter on arrival and were able to check-in three hours prior to the designated time which was appreciated.  The hotels decor was modern and suited thee idyllic surroundings.  However there were several downfalls. 
1) Between the foyer, the restaurant and the bar, there was only one toilet.  This was both inconvenient and awkward.  Also there was no soap in any of the dispensers in the ladies bathroom.

2) Minimum standard in any hotel, be it 2 star or 5 star, would be that the room would be serviced i.e fresh towels, tea depot restocked and fresh cups, bed re-made, used delph, glasses removed and general upkeep of the room.  However, during our stay this was not done, considering we left out the service tag on the door and had been out of the hotel several hours. We rang reception to ask for fresh towels and toiletries, and was informed that for the room to be serviced as above, you have to ask the cleaners to do so.  

3) Leisure centre is not 5-star standard, similar to public swimming pool and the pool area in general was cold. Sauna door was broken, steam room was small and undesirable. 

4) Food was of standard quality, with 5-star prices. 

5) During our stay, the residents in the hotel were mainly families with young kids, considering it was mid-term break. Obviously people have to get away with their kids, however there should be restrictions, e.g. 15-20 kids constantly running and playing down the halls, outside bedrooms and in the foyer is unacceptable.  We noticed that 9:30pm was the curfew for children in the bar, however was not adhered to.  

5a) The first morning whilst going to breakfast, the hostess directed us to the back section of the breakfast rooms, as this appeared to be the quiet breakfast area, as compared to the adjoining room, which seated many families. A welcomed break from the many children running around. On the second morning however, this was not the case.  We were seated by a different hostess, who placed us right amongst all of the hectic family goers.  We wouldn’t have minded this if there had not been any other seating available, but this was not the case as we witnessed the same hostess, direct an elderly couple to a quieter area far from the hustle of the bustle of the families.  We felt extremely inferior at this point. 

The majority of the staff, were friendly and welcoming, especially Allawyn in Hugo’s restaurant, but we strongly feel this is not of 5-star quality, as of the points above.  
",3,2016,02,17
238,Great hotel.,"We visited here with friends who had young kids and we were all made very welcome. 

Some lovely touches such as 2 bottles of water on departure. 

The main restaurant is expensive so beware, but the bar food is great too. Good rooms, comfy beds and a separate bath in every room. 

Lovely communal area with a fire to relax after dinner with a drink, and lots to do in the surrounding area, our only regret is that we never had time to try the spa/pool area. 

Recommended,",5,2016,02,16
238,Outstanding restaurant design at Druid's Glen,"Our family of 4 including 2 boys - 11 and 12 had occasion to stay for the first time at this hotel. We have stayed on numerous occasions in the area but always thought DG was off the beaten track. With a choice  between it and powerscourt hotel we plumped for DG  because of kid-friendly vibe and games room!
Unfortunately the hotel could not accommodate us on first 2 nights in the restaurant as it was valentines w/end. Although irritating as I believe hotel should always find room for guests who wish to dine, its a minor quibble. As a 5* hotel, the decor and general ambience lives up to its billing. The restaurant known as Hugo's and surrounding seated areas which extend into a conservatory are the jewel in the hotel's design. Wooden and marble floors throughout compliment the carpeted areas and reinforce this is a 5* experience. Our superior style room with 2 queen beds was a bit tight for all but we had booked at the last minute,  otherwise room was clean, tidy and again befitting a 5* hotel. The breakfasts were lovely but the highlight of our 3 night stay  was the family dining in the restaurant on the Sunday night and it would appear families with younger children  are accommodated in the main dining as were we when we arrived. However the true star if our stay, a waiter who we believe is  called Ali, quickly appreciated that due to the noise of the younger children,  we might appreciate being seated in the area off the conservatory which is still part of the dining area. He seated us in a lovely table for 4, where we enjoyed a wonderful  meal on our last night. This gentleman  was very attentive and a credit to the hotel. The design of the restaurant is exceptional and matches if not beats anything we have ever encountered.  In conclusion, as a matter of some comedy on our  last day,  the  bottle of wine we requested at lunch could not be provided because the waitress could not locate a corkscrew anywhere  in the hotel!!!!! Overall we were delighted with the experience and will be back.  The boys are still enjoying the games room as we type this!!pps corkscrew eventually located",5,2016,02,16
238,Riddled with flies.,"I stayed here with my girlfriend on Valentine's weekend. Like everywhere that weekend it was fully booked. We were on a stay, dine and breakfast package. I have to say the food was Devine, however, the room left a lot to be desired. Largely as the bathroom was infested with flies buzzing around the toilet and shower.
We notified the reception staff on arrival and asked if they could treat it with fly spray while we were at dinner. It seems all they did was open the door letting some of the flies into the room. When they turned down the bed, even the sealed packet of slippers left on the bed had a fly in it, suggesting it was a hotel wide problem. We tried not to let it ruin our stay as we had a spa treatment booked the following day.
The following morning on checkout we notified the reception staff of the flies again and they seemed unsurprised and uninterested.
I've simply received this seemingly auto generated response when filling out their guest satisfaction survey:

""Thank you very much for taking the time to complete our survey following your recent stay with us. I appreciate your positive scoring around some aspects of your stay.
 
Needless to say I was disappointed to read you did experience a problem with room cleanliness during your break away and I would very much welcome some further feedback in this respect so that I may take appropriate action. We are continually striving to improve on our guest experience and the amenities and services we offer and we appreciate your feedback which I can assure you will be taken on-board fully""

Despite enjoying the food and the leisure facilities, it's fair to say we certainly won't be returning.",2,2016,02,15
238,Weekend Break,"Excellent hotel set in a fantastic location. Hotel rooms were exceptionally clean and modern (albeit the bathroom was very early 90's decor). Hotel grounds and golf course were exceptional.

Only down sides were the the lack of attentive staff in the bar and restaurant areas. We had to ask for menu's and waited over 30 mins for a very basic dessert. 

Breakfast was plentiful with plenty of variety, however why the hotel feels the need to prepare fresh omelettes by a chef to the detriment of providing basic scrambled egg or boiled eggs is questionable. The queue to get a table in the mornings was frustrating but staff did their best to be accommodating.

Finally, the biggest disappointment was receiving a phone call to my room an hour after finishing my meal to be effectively 'ordered' to return to the bar area, in full view of diners, to pay for my meal and drinks. A simple clarification of the meal payment options at the outset of our check in would have avoided further embarrassment.

I will certainly return to this hotel although I intend to bring my ear plugs to reduce the noise levels provided by the vast number of children at the hotel. Who needs an alarm clock when you have kids running on corridors early in the morning. On that point I would blame the parents rather than the hotel. 

Otherwise a fantastic stay in a top hotel",4,2016,02,15
238,Great for everyone ,I was here on business and cannot really find fault with anything. The spa and pool are lovely with the sauna areas going down well with UK and Scandanavian guests alike. Fabulous rooms with huge TV and fast wifi. The restaurant and bar areas are both very nice with the food of a high standard.,5,2016,02,13
238,Absolutely perfect,"Perfect in every way.. turned down beds, duck and robe in baby cot, porter so helpful and friendly taking bags to room and car, the breakfast out of this world, baby ... The extra mile at every opportunity. ",5,2016,02,12
238,Fabulous escape,"Could not say a bad word about our stay here. From the moment we arrived until check out, everything was amazing. There were so many little touches that made it that bit more special. The spa facilities were great, extremely relaxing. Every member of staff that we met were wonderful. A great stay for an escape from the real world.",5,2016,02,09
238,Superb staff!,"We're just back from our first weekend in Druids Glen Hotel. The weather was bleak so we didn't get to enjoy outside but the hotel was superb from start to finish. We got the warmest welcome, our car parked, our bags to the room and a guided tour of it from Tagdh. The travel cot arrived with extra towels(such a simple but much appreciated touch), a mini robe and a rubber duck!!! The room was flawless, spacious and spotless. We ate in the bar on both nights and it was delicious. The staff couldn't be more helpful and service was prompt and always with a smile, especially your younger staff. I noticed one girl took a families desserts to their room for them as their children had had enough! The pool/changing areas and childrens games room were all clean and tidy and attended to. In all I have only two criticisms...the Vegetarian options are very limited and the Malbec by the glass was €10!! Delicious but expensive!

We'll be back!!",5,2016,02,08
238,We WILL be back,"A wonderful night away only 45 mins from Dublin. 
Started with afternoon tea in the conservatory. Afternoon tea was lovely and there was no rush to get out when we were finished. The first course was a lovely mix of flavours and textures. The scones and desserts were flawless and beautifully presented. The only minus was the fact that it was tea bags and not leaf tea. 
Our room was very spacious with an über comfy big bed and all the creature comforts you would expect. 
We dined in the bar as we were still fairly full from the afternoon. We had a selection of starters, the portion sizes were very good and the flavours fantastic. 
The music in the bar was very good but a little too loud for what it was. 
Breakfast was wonderful, although completely buffet style, with an egg station where freshly prepared omelettes pancakes and eggs of your choice were on offer. 
The weather stopped us from getting out to enjoy the lovely grounds but the small spa was lovely to relax in 
ALL staff we met were lovely, friendly,helpful,efficient, and professional.  
We are really hoping to return soon. ",5,2016,02,07
238,Fantastic,I haven't  been to a sleepover in Druids Glen Hotel and Golf Resort with my family yet . Its a lovely hotel . The staff are nice. Perfect Location . I love going there with my family . The hotel is set on a golf course. The view is amazing.,5,2016,02,07
238,Disappointing,"Stayed here last nite, in a supposedly superior room, there were two 'queen' sized beds but my feet were hanging off the end and way to small for two people so we ended up sleeping in separate beds, which was a first. Dinner in the bar was very poor, I ordered the prawn cocktail which was tasteless and presented badly. We both ordered the monkfish which was so overcooked I thought it was chicken, inedible. The risotto it sat on was nice. When asked did we enjoy the meal ( I left most of mine) I said no, it was very poor, the waiter, Kevin, who handled it very well to be fair, comped us the two dishes, which was nice but the damage was done. 

Tanya in the bar needs to smile, she is not welcoming or friendly. I found all the other staff very nice and especially Mary at reception. The house keeping staff was excellent, very professional and gave fresh towels, water and toiletries at turn down, very good.

I found my bed very uncomfortable. 

We decided on breakfast in bed and it was nice. They didn't charge us for this.

I found the pool area basic, it needs candles in hurricane lamps, mood lighting and the pool was way to warm.

Would I return? No
Would I recommend it? No

In my opinion it is not a 5 star.",3,2016,02,07
238,Fabulous Hotel,"Stayed here for a week with business. The hotel is in a lovely location with great food and rooms with really helpful staff.

Received a very warm welcome and given a large room on the 1st floor. The room was well appointed with a good sized comfortable bed, tv and a shower & bath in the bath room. Oddly I couldn't get any hot water out the sink tap, but the shower was fine!

Unfortunately BA lost our bags so in stepped the fab hotel staff - washed our dirty clothes in a couple of hours and helped drive one of our party to a shop for toiletries etc. They even opened the golf shop for us to buy emergency clothes.

The bar and restaurant offered good food and had a wide choice of drinks. The conference centre rooms had everything we needed for our meetings.

Location is great for golfers and non golfers alike - so look forward to visiting again in the future!",5,2016,02,06
238,Lovely night away,"Impromptu night away with my husband and the welcome from staff was second to none, from the helpful doorman to the courteous reception staff. The rooms were of an extremely high standard, very clean and an amazingly comfortable bed where we had a great nights sleep. The health suite was very good as was the great selection and variety at the buffet breakfast. Looking forward to visiting again and hopefully getting time to try one of their lovely walks and a couple of spa treatments. Nice touch was the druids glen newsletter under the door in the morning, giving lots of local information. Excellent value for money and top quality :-) ",5,2016,02,06
238,A lovely modern hotel with friendly staff,The hotel is set on a golf course and is bit off the beaten track however it has a lovely ambience and the staff are helpful and the restaurant was really lovely with beautiful views.  My husband used the spa facilities while I relaxed in the bar area. The weather wasn't great during our visit but we still enjoyed ourselves.,5,2016,02,01
238,One of the best hotels in Ireland,"Spent the weekend in this hotel for my Mother-In-Laws 90th Birthday. The whole family was here for the occasion including family from Austria. We has a number of suites booked. A fabulous room with amazing views, well worth the money. The most signifigent thing about this hotel is the staff! They are with out doubt the most outstanding people you will ever meet. Teague the Concierge was incredible. He was there to greet us on our arrival helping my mother in law out of the car and assisting us where he could. By the end of the weekend he was almost like a friend and made a big fuss of the birthday girl. The girls in the breakfast room and reception were equally as friendly and couldn't do enough for us. We really felt like VIP's. The whole hotel was spotless and deserves its 5 starts. The food at dinner was outstanding although the service was a little slow. Breakfast was beautiful with so much choice and fresh tea and coffee on demand (even skinny lattes). I can't thank the hotel staff enough for all they did for us this weekend and making it so special for my 90 year old mother in law. She will be talking about it for months. We will all be back soon for sure. 
Kind regards

238,Lovely Hotel,"We visited last week. Lovely foyer and great staff. Hugos Restaurant was the highlight of our stay. Beautiful food and really professional waiters. The breakfast was really lovely with plenty of choice. The reason l do not give a five star is the room. They were supposed to be refurbished but our bathroom doors paintwork had been through the wars. Stains on wallpaper and bad stains on throw on bed. It just is not the finish you would expect compared to the rest of the building. 

",4,2016,01,31
238,Amazing visit ,"Amazing visit. The hotel was fantastic. The staff really added a special touch to our visit.
The facilities are top notch and the breakfast is out of this world.

I ordered the fillet steak in the restaurant and it was the best I have ever had. The staff even brought a box of butlers sweet to our room that evening. 

I would highly recommend and will be back soon.",5,2016,01,31
238,Where have all the good 🌟 gone?,Having stayed and eaten here on numerous occasions I decided to treat my family today for lunch. Main course( beef) was excellent but after 45 minute wait for desert we were extremely disappointed. Staff although very nice obviously weren't trained properly to deal with incoming clients to a pace expected in high end hotels. Many other clients complained to managers also. Please go back to basics with what made ye great and extraordinary from day one....5🌟Customer Service ...good luck...,3,2016,01,31
238,One year wedding anniversary ,"Wanted somewhere close to Dublin to celebrate our wedding anniversary and Druids Glen worked a treat. Got a card and some chocolates from Manager on arrival to wish us well. Stayed in a suite, one of the best rooms I've ever stayed in!",5,2016,01,31
238,Beautiful Hotel,Myself and my husband are just back from a 2 night stay in Druids Glen.  The hotel is really nice and the staff were very attentive.  The rooms were decorated very tasteful and food in both the bar and restaurant were excellent.  The breakfast buffet was delicious and chef is awaiting to cook your order if you wanted omelettes / pancakes which was a really nice touch.  We both got spa treatments which that were fab.   Overall I would highly recommend this hotel and wouldn't hesitate to visit again.,5,2016,01,31
238,Great food .... Atrocious service,"Ate in Hugos last night . The starters were pretty poor, had the starter special of prawns & crab claws, well you wouldn't want to be hungry, 2 tiny prawns & 2 small dried up crab claws.But things improved dramatically with the mains , everybody was extremely happy from the fillet steak , pork , chicken & the vegetarian option all were perfectly cooked & very tasty. The service was atrocious throughout the evening,sat down at 8.30 & was well after 10 when we got are main course , everything was extreamly slow. What a shame !",3,2016,01,31
238,A fantastic experience,"My wife brought me her for my 60th birthday.  This really is a five star hotel, right from the moment you come in the door, there is a welcoming family friendly atmosphere.  Every detail is thought about; we had a fantastic time, grandparents, parents & children. We would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,01,30
238,You won't want to leave,"Druids Glen is such a beautiful hotel, great location, beautiful interior, nice restaurants, a lovely sunroom off the bar, and one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in. It's a great night away.

There's a pool area with steam room, sauna and plunge pool and a seperate spa area. I haven't been to the spa yet - will definitely book a treatment on my next visit. The food is lovely, which is a good thing as you're a 10-15 drive from anywhere - also a plus! 

There's a real sense of calm from the moment you drive up the drive way.",5,2016,01,30
238,5 star all the way,"we stayed with two 2 young kids the week before Christmas and had an amazing time. The family room was spacious and decor gorgeous with very comfy beds. Was plenty of room for all four of us. All the staff couldn't have been nicer, going out of their way to assist us over our stay. I had an amazing massage at the spa. The food in the bar was fantastic as was the service. They have a great room with equipment if you have a baby, bottle sterilizer, food and even nappies! Thanks to all at Druids Glen you have an amazing team of staff.",5,2016,01,27
238,Lovely Night Away,"Amazing staff who could not do enough for you. Food was lovely, had food in the bar and the breakfast the next morning was amazing. More of a family place to stay then a relaxing couples break but still enjoyed it a lot and would recommend it to everyone.",4,2016,01,25
238,Fabulous Stay,"We had an amazing stay at Druids Glen Hotel this weekend. This hotel is beautiful and you feel relaxed as soon as you walk through the doors. The facilities are top notch, food is fantastic and all staff were attentive, helpful and polite. 

Special thanks to Managing Director Edward and Joanna in reservations for organising such a wonderful stay for us. 

I would highly recommend Druids Glen to anyone and look forward to returning again in the future. ",5,2016,01,25
238,This was a wonderful hotel,"This was a wonderful hotel. We were quite pleased with our stay here. The staff was incredibly helpful and kind. You could ride bikes, go for a walk through amazingly beautiful property. The restaurant was tasty. This is a must stay.",5,2016,01,24
238,Great getaway close to Dublin city,We spent one night at Druids Glen for a relaxing night away before our own wedding. Our room was spacious and extremely comfortable. Even though there was a wedding on in the hotel we weren't bothered by any excess noise. The food we had at the restaurant for dinner was exceptional. The staff was helpful throughout our stay. It was really a lovely treat to stay at Druids Glen.,4,2016,01,23
238,Wonderful hotel and staff! ,"Myself and my friend stayed at this hotel for one night as a quick break away and our only complaint is that we couldn't stay longer! From the moment we arrived the door man met us and took our bags and the receptionist (Adrienne I think) on check in was just so polite and informative. We got a lovely room on the 2nd floor which actually had 3 huge comfortable beds in it. My friend needed to go out to her car later that evening to collect a bag and the door man (sorry don't have his name) offered to go get the car and drive it to the hotel door as it was raining. That's the type of service that is provided in this great hotel!! We had a wonderful dinner in the restaurant that evening and were waited on by lovely staff particularly Ali who was very professional yet very friendly and humorous. On our way back to the room I asked Adrienne at reception if it would be possible to use the leisure facilities after our check out the next day and she said absolutely and even gave us a late check out. Another little bonus to the place. 😃Breakfast the next morning was excellent with everything a person would possibly want, from fruits and breads laid out on buffet tables to hot breakfasts that you could order off a menu. Overall, our mini stay was a great experience and we would not hesitate to return again. Well done Druids Glen!:) ",5,2016,01,22
238,FANTASTIC LOCATION,"We arrived at this five-star hotel, a gift from our family for dinner bed and breakfast, and were warmly welcomed by an efficient and friendly reception team. Our room was delightfully spacious with high quality furnishings and a very comfortable bed. Our room overlooked a beautiful garden and glen. The hotel is situated in the beautiful Wicklow hills and there are so many things to do and see in the immediate area. A drive through the Wicklow mountains reveals the most breath-taking views.
  
Our dinner was good but not spectacular and the service intermittent. The dining room is very pleasant and the ambience good. The breakfast was really high quality with a wide range of cereals, excellent porridge and a wide range of hotel and cold food. The yogurts are sourced from a local farm and really delicious as was the smoked salmon. I would like to see a wider selection of breads. Wi-Fi is free throughout the hotel and fast 

We enjoyed our stay and would like to have spent longer here to enjoy the comforts of our room and to tour the area.",4,2016,01,21
238,Amazing Hotel With Great Staff,"Great stay at Druids. Staff are great, big shout out to Jo who works there who looked after us so well.  Would definitely recommend the spa and a meal at Hugo's restaurant. Food is delicious. Our Suite was spacious and elegant. Definitely will be back.",5,2016,01,20
238,Great weekend ,"Great stay at Druids this weekend. Staff are great, big shout out to Ken who works there who looked after us so well. Makes a mean cocktail too!

238,Amazing ,"We stayed in this fabulous hotel last week with friends. From the moment we checked in the service was outstanding. The cleanliness of the entire property was perfect and we had a suite which can only be described as phenomenal. Thanks to Alina and the accommodation team for making our stay so special. 
Also highly recommend Hugo's restaurant, the food was superb. All management and staff were so professional which makes the hotel stand out from the crowd. Warm welcome from Guest relations Kate followed by amazing stay
Definitely will be back again.

238,Better that 5 star. ,"Just checked out of Druids glen room 245. I have never been so impressed by a hotel in my life. Booked a executive suite for the night and it was just sheer perfection. Upon our arrival we were greeted by the porter Ollie who immediately took our bags off us and insisted he carried them to our room and that we were to relax because it was our holiday. We were checked on by Adrianne( excuse the spelling) who I couldn't fault at all. She explained everything to go down to a T. Such a nice friendly start to the one night stay. The room itself was so spacious with everything they we might have required to hand. There was a welcome note from the director of operation along with a box of butlers chocolate. There was also a bottle of prosecco and card from the dos manager Michelle as it was our anniversary. The room was chilly when we entered but we figured that we would get ready and go for dinner and by the time we got back it would be warmer. Dinner itself was by far one of the best dinners I have ever had in a hotel. The waiters Ricardo & Sam in the bar were so attentive and professional, constantly making sure we were okay for everything without interrupting us. We went back up to the room and it wasn't  any warmer so I rang reception  and they tried to get us a warmer room but unfortunately it wasn't possible so it was arranged a heater brought up which worked for us. We ordered breakfast to the room and upon checking out I went to pay for the tray charge and they took it off the room to apologise for the inconvenience. Everything about the whole stay was absolutely fabulous. Thank you to all the staff at Druids Glen. Your doing it right. 👍 ",5,2016,01,13
238,Enjoyable experience,"This hotel offers everything for a relaxing break, great leisure facilities, excellent staff, good food and spacious bedrooms.
Staff in the leisure centre were most helpful. Dinner was superb 
while breakfast was not of the same high standard....omelette chef was absent! Strongly recommended!",5,2016,01,13
238,What a lovely hotel,"We enjoyed a lovely weekend in this beautiful hotel as a new year treat! Excellent facilities for all the family fabulous spa treatments and amazing food!! Breakfast is most definitely my favorite!

We most definitely fell under the spell

This beautiful hotel is in an amazing location very easily got to and clearly sign posted for those who haven't been before!

Although I haven't personally used the golf course it look spectacular the landscaping is beautiful and a pleasure to observe from the relaxing comforts of hotel surroundings! 

",5,2016,01,12
238,One night is not enough here,"My husband and I spent one night here over the weekend to celebrate an anniversary. The hotel is gorgeous, the staff are fantastic and so friendly and welcoming. We ate lunch and dinner in the hotel Saturday, both were delicious/ The only minor thing was at breakfast the following morning after waiting over 10 minutes we had to go and find someone to ask for toast and coffee, there didnt seem to be a system where once seated for breakfast you have your tea / coffee / toast order taken. We went for a walk in the grounds after breakfast and actually found it quite difficult to make our way back to the hotel, it may be an idea to have a few sign posts on the walking path maybe saying 'hotel 700m this way' it was very difficult to get back and we had to go out onto the main road and make our way back that way. That said, its no reflection on the great quality of the hotel and its amazing staff. We will definitely return again.",5,2016,01,12
238,"Super scenery, impressive interior and brilliant food","We checked in over the weekend for 1 night on dinner +b&b basis. Our dinner at Hugos was just brilliant esp as our server Loic was so attentive and simply fun without loosing the mood and ambience of this upscale restaurant. Happily surprised they had a vegetarian menu. Brilliantly presented tantalising dishes. The dessert platter was a perfect tasting experience after a rich dinner. We did however notice that there was not enough staff on the floor thus leading to long delays between courses and uncomfortable rushing about by all servers trying to give everyone their full attention.
The servers at The Thirteenth Bar (apart from Ricardo) looked disinterested. Ricardo was attentive and friendly. However for the 2 times we ate lunch over the weekend the rest of the staff took very long to even get us menus, take our order, serve us our drinks, then food and it was after waving down the 3rd server that we got our bill. We opted not to stay for coffee. Possibly another understaffing issue that needs to be addressed.

Another good mention would be the barman/staff Stephen who was super welcoming,  friendly and made up a wonderful cocktail of the day that we really enjoyed.

The breakfast was a good selection however there was very little in the way of vegetarian hot food apart from mushrooms and tomato. A hash brown and baked beans would not go unappreciated. The breads were yum and fresh. The coolest thing was an actual honey comb which dripped into a pouring jar for serious organic honey. See pics below.
The coffee was very strong to the point of bitter so I did not enjoy that at all. The strawberry compote/jam was the best I have had in a long time.

The room was really nice and spacious, comfy beds and pillows, quiet and over looking some serious scenery. 

We went to the spa which was decent with the steam, sauna, jacuzzi, plunge pool and swimming pool which were all full to the brim especially as it appeared kids timings were set through the core hours so not very relaxing as it was packed and loud. Prob not ideal for couples but great for families. 
",4,2016,01,11
238,One night is just not enough!,"Just returned home from a night in the Druids Glen hotel in Wicklow to celebrate my good friend's birthday 🎂. We started with a walk, picnic in the beautiful area, and then relaxed in the pool. We treated ourselves to a wonderful body massage. 
The dinner was amazing! Breakfast was suburb, especially the Guinness bread. The staff make you feel so welcome. 
Why didn't we book 2 nights?!!!",5,2016,01,11
238,Swing time at the glen,"We went on a family at the end of August 2015, so I'm late doing this review. Anyway this was our second time here. This time it was a 4 night stay at this resort . It's a 5 star resort so expectations were high. I played the glen golf course (parkland type) this is without doubt 5 star , as for the resort it's really nice spa, gym, pool , choice of restaurants, conference centre etc. It also has a links golf course as well and a driving range. Overall definitely worth a visit, for the golfer it's a 5, for the family a 4 👍.",4,2016,01,10
238,Beautiful hotel,I really wish we could have stayed two nights. One night isn't enough. It's definitely one of the best hotels in Ireland. We will be back soon.  The restaurant was lovely and we had a lovely Chilean sauvagion wine. ,5,2016,01,10
238,Outstanding hotel!!,"Stayed at Druid's Glen in September. The service and attention to detail were outstanding!! Upon arrival, we were greeted at reception - it was a nice touch when the lady on reception came out from behind the desk to speak with us.  The warm hand towels were lovely after a long journey.  We ate in the bar both evenings.  The waiter (Sonny) was extremely helpful and friendly.  There was a good selection of food on the menu and they also have a baby menu with potatoes and veg rather than just fried food!!  This was one of our first trips away with a young baby and the play/games room had lots of toys to keep her amused. Room was lovely and the breakfast was really tasty.  All this may not seem like a big deal but it was lots of wee small things which made a big difference to our stay! Would highly recommend to families and would definitely love to return!",5,2016,01,08
238,New Year visit,"We visited Druids Glen for two nights recently and enjoyed our stay.  It was extremely busy for the new year and staff coped very well with the pressure.  We were checked in promptly and efficiently by a male receptionist/manager.  We had booked into the restaurant for dinner for two evenings and this was a pleasant experience even though service was extremely slow on the first night.  The menu has good variety such as venison, pidgeon and duck (served pink).  The A La Carte menu is expensive.
Because there were so many children there for the weekend, the swimming pool had to be controlled for safety reasons which was very inconvenient for us, we could not swim when we wanted to.  The golf course was closed also but we managed to get a game in nearby Powerscourt which was very enjoyable.  We like Druids Glen but we will make sure the next time we go that it is not during school holidays.",4,2016,01,07
238,Wow !! What a super stay ,"My partner and I stayed here last night and I didn't want to come home ! 
Right from the moment we stepped inside reception the feel was good. Staff on reception were very friendly and booked us in for the evening very promptly. 
Our room was on third floor close to the lift which initially we thought would be noisey but it wasn't. The decor was superb with a super large bed , writing desk and a seated area with a view over the golf course. The Flat screen tv on the wall was watched as we drank our complementary bottle of prosecco !!
The bathroom was very clean with fluffy white towels and robes - l'occitane soap, shower gel shampoo and body moisturiser were provided which was a lovely wee touch. I don't like feather pillows which I got changed without question.
We ate in the bar area which was very reasonable and tasted amazing and the cocktails went down a treat too !!
This morning we went down for breakfast - fresh fruit, hot cooked breakfast, freshly made omelettes or crepes made to your order and a variety of cold meats cheese and breads were all available- gluten free bread is also available but the one thing that topped it was was the honey - it looked like it had just come out of the bee hive - just off the rack - amazing !!! 
I would 100% recommend you try here - I know for sure I will return - when am I off work next ???!!!!! I'm away to check 😊",5,2016,01,07
238,Fantastic Resort,"My only complaint is we didn't stay another night! The Druids Glen Resort was by far one of our most pleasing stays while in Ireland. My wife and I spent two nights here and it was nothing short of amazing from the moment we arrived until our departure. The staff at the reception desk, the housekeeping, the bar and restaurant are all so friendly and respectful. Even the gentleman in the lobby who gave us water and offered assistance with our luggage was great. Our room had everything we needed and anything else was simply a phone call away. The grounds are beautiful and kept up extremely well. Don't hesitate and book your stay here! ",5,2016,01,06
238,Great Family Break,"(1) Check in: We were welcomed by efficient friendly staff who gave us water and colouring pencils for our daughter. They asked if we wanted anything else in our room to make our stay more comfortable, they were just fab.
(2) Child friendly: there is a lovely playground outside, a lovely pool with times for kids to play and an indoor play area with games machines and toddler friendly toys. All were great and my daughter loved them. Only con of the whole trip was that there was no staff in the indoor play room and when we were there, a lot of kids were unsupervised and just left to their own devices. There was a brother and sister who were rough with eachother and they were banging into other kids while they were fighting so l found it hard to relax and took my toddler out.
(3) Food: Eating with kids can be stressful but l cannot say enough about the loveliest waitress in the restaurant. Drew Davis came to take our order equipped with colouring pencils and paper. She recommend yummy food and brought my toddler a babychinno with mini marshmallows so she wouldn't be 'helping' me with my coffee. She really made the meal relaxing and enjoyable so we didn't find ourselves rushing through our courses. Thank you Drew, you are a star!!",5,2016,01,06
238,Just book it -,"We stayed at the Druids Glen on the 30th of December for a one night break. The hotel  reception area and lobby is beautiful and comfortable. The hotel staff were very professional and friendly, including and efficient and friendly valet service. The check in time for the hotel is 1600 which we were aware of, though we had requested an early check in but as the hotel was completely full it was not likely, which was fine. My partner had a treatment booked in the hotel spa and I made use of the driving range. The hotel will provide golf clubs if needed. My partner really enjoyed the treatment (pedicure). 
Our room was ready before 3 as it turned out and wow was it worth waiting for! we were very luck to have received a complimentary upgrade to a suite and it was exquisite. The gas fire set in a traditional fireplace was a lovely touch in the living area. The suite has two separate toilets - main bathroom with separate shower and bath and the other with a toilet and sink.  The were two large tv's in each room of the suite and the decor was as you would expect in a 5 star hotel. I had read the few negative reviews of this hotel, as I always do, and there were one or two that complained about the numbers of families staying with children at the hotel and there were a lot of children staying while we were there too but we thought it was great to see. I personally don't think that 5 star should mean that children are not to be welcomed and as the Druids Glen Resort clearly demonstrates that it is possible to cater for all ages and maintain a 5 star standard (we did leave our 4 year old with grandparents though!). We will definitely stay here again and of the many 5 star hotels we have stayed in around the world this rates write up there as providing an unmatched atmosphere of relaxation and opulence.",5,2016,01,05
238,Firm Favourite,"We love coming to Druids for a couple of nights about once a year, the last few times we have stayed just after Christmas , It is a great place and we were glad to see a few familiar faces around the place ( staff ) . The place is very family orientated,  which is great if you have a few nippers in tow but not so good for those of us wanting a quiet break . why do some parents let their off spring play in the hotel corridors ? however we think we shall make our next trip  mid week to avoid the large amount of small ( noisey )children .  slight delay on getting our room initially but did receive complmentry wine as an apology , this was a nice touch and shows the true class of the place, rooms are spacious and beds super comfy . nice range of toiletries and fluffy towels.
Didnt get to play any golf on this trip but if you have not played the Glen course you seriously need to get yourself here , the heath course is also excellent.
Would certainly recommend a stay here and will no doubt be returning.",5,2016,01,04
238,Wedding Guest,"Stayed here for a wedding, had a lovely stay, hotel is fab, staff were lovely, food was unreal!!! Residents bar spa pool buffet breakfast all you could want in a luxury hotel!!.. Would def recommend it and would def go back :)",5,2016,01,04
238,Loved this place,A very rare night away sans kids. Beautiful location. Great service. Room immaculate. Spa was small but reasonably priced and I had a wonderful relaxing treatment. Dinner menu limited but food was amazing! So impressed. Loved the breakfast esp honey comb. My family would have kept bees and it's so hard to find  it now! Only wish I could have stayed longer.  ,5,2016,01,01
238,Excellent short break with the familly,"With stayed for 3 nights in this hotel with my wife and 2 small kids and overall had an excellent experience. It did not start that well as the adjacent deluxe rooms we were given were right beside the kid's play room which stays open until 11pm, with plenty of kids running around screaming (like any normal kid :). When I complained to the reception they offered us to change rooms on the spot but as this was tricky with our kids we waited until the next day...and then got a free upgrade into a magnificent suite + an extra adjacent room.
There are really a lot of positives about this place:
- very nice large deluxe rooms 
- really good and friendly overall service, starting with the reception. Special mention as well to the restaurant waiters
- excellent restaurant, much better than most the the Irish restaurant in which I have eaten
- very decent bar food as well and good breakfast
- overall great for kids (consequently i would not really recommend the place for couples), with indoor and outdoor play areas and a very decent (+warm) swimming pool (with specific time for kids)

I really do not have any major negatives to report, just a few small details that could be improved:
- supply espresso sized cups for the espresso machine...
- better cheese selection at breakfast (i.e. more than two hard cheese variants)
- ability to serve a proper decaf coffee at the excellent restaurant

We'll be back for sure.",5,2016,01,01
238,Very good hotel,"We stayed for 2 nights over New Year's Eve and I'm glad we picked this hotel. When we got there on the 30th it was very busy at the check in and our room wasn't ready yet, I wasn't too bothered as we had some coffee in the very nicely decorated lobby but we got a complimentary bottle of wine sent to our room later on to make up for the delay, I thought it was a nice gesture. Our double room was nice and big and quite close to the swimming pool which was very handy. The pool area was quite busy and maybe not 5 star standards but the pool was properly heated unlike other hotels so we spent a lot of time there. 
We only ate at the bar but the food and drinks were very nice and the staff really pleasant. I would have no hesitation recommending this hotel.",4,2016,01,01
238,Brilliant 2nd stay!,"We stayed in July 14 and returned for a 3 night stay this month from Dec 29-31st. We were a family with 2 young kids so the addition of the new kids club really made a difference to our ""relaxation"" time!  Love this hotel, staff are so friendly and very professional even when under high pressure in the bar in the evenings or at breakfast time. This hotel has everything a family needs, rooms are very spacious, swimming pool is warm, games room and kids club mean the kids are occupied and once they are happy everyone is happy!! Will be back for sure. 
",5,2015,12,31
238,Below par room service!,"For the price paid, this hotel falls short on attention to detail. The guest book needs attention and the food that was delivered for room service was awful. A very dry burger (which came with mayonnaise on it even after I asked for none) and rock hard chunky chips. Also no brown sauce available (basic) and no vinegar either. ",3,2015,12,29
238,Lack of Wow Factor.,"We stayed 2 adults and 2 children, we arrived at 15.30 the doorman was very welcoming and friendly at reception we were nicely welcome with hot towels but we were disappointed that the room was not ready, I found this quite excessive considering it is a 5 star hotel, the receptionist took our bags and dropped them himself in a rush in our room, no room orientation was provided it seems the hotel is understaffed and I did not see any porter around during our whole stay.
The hotel is modern and built to high standards, surrounded by a beautiful landscape, rooms were modern,nicely decorated, warm with a nice shower and bath with L'occitane amenities everything worked as expected.
We had dinner at Fairways, the food was nice but a bit overpriced for what we got, service was good.
The swimming pool is big but without any luxury features in the whole area besides it was overcrowded by a teaching lesson that took over the only 2 lanes for swimmers, the locker room was freezing cold and this was probably the only area were I felt I was more in a 4 star hotel rather than a 5 one.
For breakfast they have a decent selection of cold and hot food, unfortunately when I went to pick up a plate at the buffet I found the plate not clean and on the other side It was egg stuck to the plate I went through 4 plates with the same results then I checked the other pile and the second plate was ok, I mentioned this to the server then he looked at me like saying ""where is dirty?"" I gestured him to check the back of the plates, when he saw the plates he removed both piles and replaced them.
Despite the dirt on those particular plates breakfast was enjoyable, I loved the honey in the honeycomb this is the kind of things that I expect from a 5 star hotel.
Other feature that I really appreciate was the play room for kids, we had good fun in it, They have a lovely outdoor playground but we couldn't avail it because of the rain.
I think the staff was handpicked and delivered a good service in general.          
Recognition is a let down in this hotel, they deliver items to our room but they don't bother to use your last name.
I think it is a decent 5 stars hotel in most areas however I found it lacks of wow factor, it seems they are focus to just barely meet the expectations rather than exceed them.
Would I recommend this hotel?..... Yes, I would.",3,2015,12,26
238,Pre christmas break,"Welcome from reception was warm and friendly, room immaculate comfortable beds, meal in restaurant that night was superb and the breakfast in am was one of the best ever. Very 5 star hotel, didn't sample the spa but had a guided tour and very impressed, maybe next time.  Congratulations on excellent hotel staff, we will be back.",5,2015,12,26
238,Very friendly & comfortable stay,"We stayed just one night before Christmas and really enjoyed it. Everything was perfect starting with the friendly welcome from the porter, the comfortable rooms & delicious breakfast. Great job by all of the staff. Many thanks, we'll be back!",5,2015,12,26
238,Beautiful oasis in the Irish Countryside,"This is a lovely hotel set in beautiful grounds, with two excellent golf courses. Ideal for families it has a lovely large indoor pool, games room for kids and outdoor playground. They have bikes on site that can be used by guests.The setting is gorgeous, staff are extremely friendly and both food and service are great. I had a massage which was excellent. Our children really enjoyed their stay and we found it very relaxing.",5,2015,12,21
238,Magnificent property.,"This property is beautiful. The surrounds are typical of the delightful Irish countryside. Dining at Hugo's restaurant was exceptional as was that of the casual dining in the bar area. Our room, 217 on the second floor was nicely appointed with a view that was worth staying for. Staff at all levels from valet, front desk, room service through to catering were all of a standard that spoke proud of the resort. I thoroughly recommend this as a place to get away and enjoy a couple of days while in Ireland. If you are a golfer, then you are set. There are also nice walks and the resort is close to some historic places such as Glendalough, Avoca etc.",5,2015,12,17
238,Relaxing 2 nights away,"We traveled to Druids Glen in early December and  had  a memorable experience and relaxing two night break.  The surroundings are wonderful and the staff were extremely attentive. 

We will return for sure.",5,2015,12,15
238,Idyllic Irish Escape,"I was here for a couple of nights and enjoyed this hotel immensely. It took an hour and a half to get from the airport to the resort on a busy Friday night, due to traffic, but only 40 minutes on the way back (no traffic!). 

I recently visited, so it was decorated gorgeously in Christmas. The Resort has a country lodge feel about, a good balance between country and contemporary. It is a huge space and has lots of little places to sit and relax...I enjoyed a hot chocolate by the fire on one occasion. 

The rooms are large, with decor in-keeping with the Celtic resort. Complimentary water, robes and a turn-down service are all nice touches. I was in a double room and it had a huge family size bathroom - lovely.
My colleagues had junior suites; a small lounge and two bathrooms...one had an open fireplace...they were lovely! 

The food enjoyed at the hotel was also delicious. Fine wine, Guinness on tap and the chicken supreme was to die for. Overall a gorgeous stay and I have recommended it to a couple of my married friends, as somewhere to stay for a ""get-away""... the Spa for her and the Golf for him, perhaps.",5,2015,12,15
238,Perfect for our Mini-moon!!,"I booked the Druids Glen resort for my wife and i's mini-moon and I can't say anything but good things about it. 

The booking process was made so easy and I was given plenty of upgrade options with regards to rooms.

I booked one of the executive suites and was totally blown away by it, the room had a separate living area with its own tv and gas fireplace with its own independent ac system and bathroom

Our bedroom had a king sized bed, tv, fridge etc and our very own personal coffee machine. Also a huge bathroom with walk in shower and separate bath with bathrobes and lots of toiletries.

The hotel itself was absolutely stunning especially with all the Christmas decorations around the lobby and lots of snugs to sit and relax in front of the two open fires and even hot cider and mince pies to warm yourself up.

We had dinner in Hugo's and I must say the service is truly outstanding, we hadn't made a reservation but they did everything they could to find us a table, offering us a selection of breads etc while we decided what to order off their extensive menu which had lots of options for vegetarians and gluten free.

Starters were served very promptly with good sized portions and the waitress was very attentive, again mains were served promptly and must say the steak that I had was first class and my wife's monkfish was also so good we cleared our plates in no time, we ordered a dessert to share and when it was presented it had happy honeymoon written in sauce which was a very nice touch.

We had 2 spa treatments included in our package and decided to go for a full body massage which I must say was top quality, the relaxation room was lovely and available to use before and after our treatments with a variety of fruits and drinks to choose from, the therapists really know their stuff and where gentle on me as I've never had a full body massage before but definitely won't be my last.

We will definitely be back again and even have my in-laws considering booking the resort. ",5,2015,12,15
238,brilliant for families/ children,"I can't recommend this hotel enough for anyone with young kids. The bar/restaurant are welcoming to kids and have great food options, the indoor playroom and pool are great for rainy days and the outdoor playground/ surrounding area is brilliant for better weather.",5,2015,12,15
238,"Simply Great Fitness, Pool and Spa Experience","Earlier in the year I took a gym, pool and spa membership at the wonderful Druids Glen Resort as part of my golf membership there. I have to say it's been just great. The pool, jacuzzi and thermal facilities are beautifully light filled by double height floor to ceiling windows, which is a lovely change from many facilities in the country which are in the interior of buildings and dark. From the pool, or even better the elevated jacuzzi, you can survey the leafy grounds and the entrance to the Druids Heath course and relax in calm surroundings. The pool is a very good size and is pleasantly quiet a lot of the time. Importantly for me as a regular swimmer, there is always at least one lane reserved for lap swimmers which is always accessible. Among the guests, there is a vibrant club membership and the pool runs regular swimming lessons and aqua fitness which look very well run. There are also a nice big sauna; steam and aroma thermal suites, experience showers and a refreshing plunge pool. 

So, whether you're in the mood for a good workout in the pool, shooting the breeze with a regular in the jacuzzi or just chilling out and enjoying the warm surroundings, there are not many nicer places to do it.

The gym located on the first floor overlooking the pool is a very good size and provides all the usual quality equipment, cardio, weights, exercise room and there's a spinning room for classes too. Wes and the team of fitness professionals are very attentive and always very welcoming. 

After a hard day or week, a game of golf, a gym workout or swim, or just for a treat, there's no better way to wind down than with a good massage and the Druids Glen Spa excels at this. I try to get a regular massage after my workouts and have to say the service and the quality of all the therapists I've had has been first class, indeed world leading. Spa Director Michelle O'Connor and her staff always ensure you're perfectly relaxed and feeling at home and that any built up stress or muscle tension is properly dealt with. The treatment rooms are very pleasant and there's a lovely relaxation room for use before and after your treatment, also a good time to enjoy the thermal facilities. I always sleep even better than normal the night after a visit. It's definitely worth mentioning that aside from providing superb service, the spa is also excellent value. As a fitness club member, (itself good value) you get a further 30% off already well priced spa treatments from Monday to Thursday and they also offer a loyalty card where every sixth treatment is effectively free. I don't think anyone in the country beats that value at these high standards! It's refreshing to see such great customer service, coupled with good pricing for such luxury service and facilities so close to Dublin.  

Needless to say, the hotel rooms which I've stayed in on a number of occasions and Druids Glen Hotel's food and beverage offerings, are at a similar five star standard and are always a real treat. Apart from the stunning lounge and lobby area, make sure you visit the comfortable glass walled lounge with its own lovely fireplace and adjoining outdoor terrace which is great on sunny days, both of which overlook the wonderful Druids Glen golf course.  

A real Irish gem that meets and exceeds the highest standards and that's before you get to the resort's famous and absolutely superb golf courses. They'll be a separate review though.",5,2015,12,12
238,Wonderful One Night Get Away,"We stayed here on a Thursday evening (26th) as my husbands 30th birthday was on the Friday and I surprised him the night before whist driving from Dublin to Wexford! 

The Christmas decorations were the first thing we saw when we went in - the lights were spectacular and made the experience very special. 

The receptionist was so kind and welcoming.

On arrival to our room there was a little box of butlers chocolates for my husband for his birthday. 

We ate in the bar, although it can not be classified as ""bar food"" - it was €100 for two starters, two mains, one desert, one coffee and two glasses of wine. The food was exceptional. Really fantastic, i had Sea bass  and my husband had steak and neither of us could fault the food. 

The room was very clean and comfortable with beautiful furniture and a lovely shower (always the deal breaker for me!). 

The best experience of the stay for us however was the breakfast. I am coeliac and had not given the hotel prior notice, it had slipped my mind, however on arrival to breakfast we were shown the ""gluten free station""! I was very impressed! We sat and read the newspapers sipping on fresh juice, beautiful coffee and while we watched out omelette and pancakes being made in front of us. There was no rush on us? Every scrap of food was delicious and the overall experience was fantastic. 

Can't fault anything from our short but very sweet stay!",5,2015,12,11
238,One Night Escape,"It was a last minute decision to book a one night stay. We wanted something really relaxing in a secluded location.

The hotel was super busy and our check in was a little late but staff sent a complimentary bottle of prosecco to our room which was a really nice touch.

The room was really nice & spacious.

Breakfast was the highlight, there was an amazing selection of food for all tastes.

Overall, really nice but not 5 star!",4,2015,12,06
238,Stunning,"What a stunning hotel,probably one of the best hotels ive stayed in,greeted with hot towels on arrival & bottles of water,the staff were excellent and always on hand to help out or to be of service,room very nice with a massive bed,big bathroom,small fridge and big tv,the food was beautiful and the price of a pint was what you would pay in your local pub,breakfast was buffet style & omletts were made to order,on checking out we were hand bottles of water again,will definitely stay here again. ",5,2015,12,06
238,"very nice hotel, with excellent and friendly staff","We only stayed for one night, a mid week break. It's a lovely setting, we really enjoyed ourselves and would definitely come back again. 
We can't fault the staff, very friendly and efficient. We had an issue with the room we were given that was sorted out immediately to our satisfaction. So thanks in particular to the concierge and the reception staff.
it's a shame the weather didn't cooperate but you cant blame that on the hotel!",4,2015,12,04
238,"We found a hotel and staff imbued with pride and charm and, we, well we left with their glowing smiles on our faces","Normally a family with three under six, including an eleven month old who is still cribbing life a pony on anything wooden would not be the recipe for an enjoyable holiday. We were so wrong. 'Genuinely' (as Miriam would say) lovely staff who were obviously proud of their Pile. We were put in very close access to a wee room with baby bottle warmers, a nappy changing facility and even choice of baby foods and nappies within arms reach: and just far enough across the corridor to avoid the olfactory outrage of a neonates... well you know...  

Separately, food choice was brilliant for both children and adults:  the evening staff were also great with kids, even remembered the kids choice of ice-cream from the night previously. Breakfast?-a dream thanks to lovely Orla and crew.  The swimming pool and the games room from Heaven helped two wettish days get passed with an easy smile. Our Ted, who is 5 and a bit announced 'Hotel of the year' in a loud voice when escalating the circular stairs.  Thank you, thank you thank you0- Ted wanted me to also mention their 'Library ' of DVDs which kids can choose from for free and watch in their bedroom on the DVD player.  Heaven is a place that is found in Druid's Glen.",5,2015,12,03
238,Spa visit,"Visited Druid's Glen recently,  had a very relaxing stay,  and availed of the spa facilities. Ciara, the therapist was engaging, warm and welcoming and gave the best pregnancy massage I've experienced.  Will be returning!
Well done to all at Druid's Glen, especially Ciara.",5,2015,12,01
238,Our favourite family getaway hotel on the island of Ireland,"We've been to Druids Glen twice with our young family in the past year.  It covered all bases for us with young kids & no fuss at all.  The two main restaurants are family friendly & cater excellently for toddlers!  Mum & dad were highly satisfied too. We even were offered dessert in our room when the kids needed to sleep. 

The leisure & spa facilities are clean, accessible and relaxing.  The two golf courses looked great (to walk around) but maybe I'll get to play next time we visit.

Can't wait for our next trip",5,2015,11,30
238,Great hotel - highly recommend,Wonderful location. We received great service - very warm and welcoming from all staff encountered. The food was great and my party were looked after very well. This was a return visit and I am sure that we will return again.,5,2015,11,30
238,Loved it ....,"24 hours of sheer bliss - I brought a friend here for an overnight for her special birthday. The hotel is beautifully designed, spacious with so many interesting places to sit, relax and enjoy. Lovely to have a room with two queen size beds. Spacious and very tastefully furnished with many extras. Dinner in Hugo's was a superb experience - definitely recommend it. The staff in the hotel are obviously well trained, attentive and friendly - above average. ALL of them were great. Afternoon tea was also a pleasant experience. Their savouries in addition to the sandwiches were delicious. However, if I could offer one suggestion - fine china would make a great difference rather than traditional white thick cups. I have stayed in many Irish hotels (and I can be hard to please), and this is right up there with the best. I can see this hotel has worked hard to achieve and maintain an extremely high standard. It shows. Looking forward to definitely coming back.",5,2015,11,30
238,Average ,"Rooms are luxurious and very clean and the hotel does give off a gorgeous appearance. afternoon tea is not  good at all just ham and cheese sandwiches really. The staff are really unorganised and some are rude. 
Please do not arrive before 4pm because your room will not be ready 

",3,2015,11,29
238,Disappointing. Would not recommend,"We booked this resort for our anniversary weekend and due to the activities for children. 

On arrival there was no concierge or valet to meet us. So there was some confusion as to whether we were at the right place. The kids playroom was great but in need of repair. The games console controls were broken and some of the equipment (mats especially) were worn down and becoming sharp/spiky. 

On both nights we ate in the bar to accommodate our children. Both nights there was at least a 20min wait on the children's food. Neither night was that busy. We were never updated as to how long it was going to be and once the food did arrive we weren't checked on. The children were not provided with water. And each night we had to go up and organise the bill as the staff didn't come back around. 

On Saturday night we had dinner in Hugo's (fine dining restaurant) that we booked some time ago. As we were shown to our table we were told our table would be needed back at 9:15pm and were asked if this was ok. Our answer was no this is not ok. We were not advise of this at our time of booking. If the restaurant is over booked then the last people to book should be the ones to change their plans. 

Clearly the hostess mentioned something to our waiter who advised us to take our time and enjoy our night. Given it was our wedding anniversary we intended to do this. 
As I went to the bathroom our waiter spoke to my husband advising that they would need our table back and advised that we could have our desert at the table but requested that we have our coffees in the bar. How ridiculous! Our drinks could just be served at the same time to begin with. And quite simply to ask people to leave is unacceptable. Anyway we didn't say anything and waited for our desert. Which hilariously took 20mins to arrive. Clearly the hurry to get us to leave didn't include being served. And incredibly we could've had our drinks whilst we waited and waited. We were offered our drinks free of charge in the bar but I couldn't be bothered. 

A disappointing stay. I expected so much more and it could've been great.",2,2015,11,25
238,"Simply the most amazing hotel, food, staff, room and setting - thank you","With a wonderful warm and gracious welcome from Maire on arrival and hot towels to freshen up what a great start and bottles of water on departure. Hotels should learn from this wonderful start and finish - we came and left with big smiles and the only negative thing I will say about our experience is that we just booked one night 
but should have been at least two or three to actually experience this hotel fully. Then Maire gave up a great description of the great areas to explore and a wonderful walk to go -which we did and so enjoyed it. The porter then took our luggage to our rooms and both of them had the wow factor for sure. Superior rooms with king size beds and a beautiful view. It is really beyond me how anyone could fault this hotel. The rooms were spotless and the decor amazing and so quite and  relaxing. 
Thank you Marie for telling us about the walk - we so enjoyed that and ended up in the country club which is well worth a visit. There was a wonderful barman there from Dublin and we had great fun with him. He gave us all the history on the Club House and took us on a guided tour. At this point it was late and we were worried about getting back to the hotel but our wonderful barman called the hotel who in turn came with a courtesy bus to take us back to the hotel - what service.
When we got back all the Christmas lights were on and it was like a fairytale of winder wonderland. On the night we stayed there was a football match on Ireland and Bosnia so  the men wanted to watch it - we ended up eating in the bar. The food and service was just wonderful. Thank you Jason and Ali for a wonderful recommendation of wine and food.
There was a lovely turn down service when we got back to our rooms with chocolate - what a lovely thing to do.
Well the next morning our men went out early for breakfast and a game of golf which they really enjoyed - we on the other hand opted for late breakfast and a spa treatment. The breakfast was a amazing array of cereals, fruits, seeds, smoked salmon, cold meats, cheeses and then all your cooked with a wonderful chef cooking  freshly cooked omelets  - superb.
We booked two hot stone massages in the spa and meet the lovely Cathriona who gave the most amazing treatment  ever. I have a hot stone almost every week and nothing compared to this treatment - thank you so very much.
Just when we thought things could not get better -  we were running late for check our - so called reception and Maire was on the other end of the line saying don't worry we will leave your rooms until last so check when you are ready, what a relieve.The men came at 12.30 needed a quick shower before our flight back to London, so really appreciated the late check out. All we can say is the is the a wonderful 10 star tranquil hotel with efficient first class staff and a stunning setting with the wonderful Maire, making everyone feel just that bit extra special.
Thank you and we will be back. Mary & Joseph and family",5,2015,11,25
238,Pleasant stay,"Stayed here for one night! We enjoyed the leisure facilities and the quiet surrounding. Dinner in the bar was good value and breakfast was top class. The room was modern, clean and spacious with tea and coffee making facility. Bathroom has both bath and shower cubicle, a luxury!",5,2015,11,24
238,Hotel good ! Hugo's a letdown,"Visited recently for two night stay . Weekend overall was very enjoyable, hotel was good , bar food was good , facilities were good but Hugo's restaurant was a huge letdown . Veg and potato were served barely warm and steaks (3) were all sent back . Two steaks were better when they were served again but one was even worse . Would be put off staying in hotel again due to such poor food in restaurant ",3,2015,11,24
238,Amazing Family Friendly Hotel,I would highly recommend this hotel for any traveller. Myself and my husband visited with our two young kids. The hotel staff could not have been more accommodating. The facilities are amazing from the pool to the children's playroom. My kids ended up being sick- complimentary snacks and movies were sent to our room along with a birthday card for my son and some games. The food was delicious and room service was prompt and very tasty. Great experience. ,5,2015,11,23
238,Fantastic hotel. Couldn't ask for better ,"Myself and my family stayed here for my wife's birthday. To start with we were greeted by the porter and given hot fresh towels to freshen up whilst we checked in. 

All the staff are very attentive and ask if you are ok, and are you having a pleasant day. 

Breakfast is lovely, plenty of omelettes and pancakes made to order and of course all the usual breakfast items. 

The spa and swimming pool is lovely, this is the best hotel we have stayed in for a while. 

All in all couldn't ask for anything better. Brilliant service. 

I asked could I pay for something extra to celebrate my wife's birthday, the photo shows what they brought us. 

",5,2015,11,21
238,Good but could be better.....,"Ok so asked for a complimentary upgrade which I received and ended up in an Executive Suite which was really nice which included a separate living area with gas fire, plus two bathrooms. The main bathroom was not high quality, it was unappealing to look at and seemed out of place compared to the rest of the room quality. The bath had ugly wooden side panelling and a huge sheet of glass above the bath which didn't really seem safe in hindsight. The shower was small and the lighting was poor also. 

We arrived at the hotel to be greeted with warm face cloths which was a nice touch, and a porter took our bags from our car and showed us to our room, all assisted which was a great welcome. After settling in, we checked out our view through the bedroom windows which was poor to say the least. We were directly facing other bedroom windows and it reminded me instead of a block of flats rather than looking out onto the golf course of forest for example, big mistake here, especially for a suite. 

Went to lunch in the bar area and the service was appalling. Very slow, unattentive despite many members of staff walking about aimlessly. There didn't seem to be any direction or leadership. A manager actually seen us walking towards him at the bar to ask for a table and he simply walked the other direction which was frankly rude. We got lunch which was delicious and were able to have a fantastic view of the nearby forest, etc. 

We went for dinner in the bar that night also and the service was worse. Again, same problem, lots of staff running about but they didn't seem to be looking after the customers. It seemed a little chaotic. The food was ridiculous, I asked for a duck salad and got an entire bag of baby leaf lettuce on a plate with some cold, dry duck thrown in. Honestly, I've never had a full bag of lettuce on a plate before, this was a disgrace. Called the manager and he said ""was there not enough duck?"" I said there was far too much lettuce to which he took it off our bill. Main course of fish and chips was average and came with mushy peas which were that old or cheap they were almost grey. Left and just two courses and were jumped on by the waitress to sign for the meal of €70 which was a rip off for what we got. Breakfasts here are amazing though, such a variety and selection, really wouldn't need to eat lunch after it. We ate the following night in Hugo's Restaurant and it was amazing, and the kind French waiter was second to none with attention.

Had a head, back and neck massage, it was amazing as it was a couple's massage was a very good experience. Staff in the spa/pool area are very helpful and professional. 

All in all, Druid's Glen isn't a bad hotel. It looks amazing inside and out, except the terrible bathroom suite, honestly please sort this out. A few things to note, the heating is crazy here, it's actually roasting hot all the time which is uncomfortable to say the least. There are A LOT of kids staying here and when you go to the pool area, forget about a quiet relaxing swim. I am a parent by the way and when I go to a hotel, I like to be in adult company, not competing with loads of kids hogging the pool and restaurant area. Some parent's don't seem to have any control of their kids and let them run through the restaurant and bar area which does annoy many. 

So in conclusion if you want a relaxing stay with no kids, don't go here. It's full of kids, terrible, unattentive staff in the bar area, and not much to do in the surrounding area unless you drive a few miles into another town. Quite expensive too to be honest even with the exchange rate so perhaps worth shopping around. By the way, had a spin over to Powerscourt, the prices in there are eyewatering! €17 for a club sandwich! Anyway, rant over :)",3,2015,11,20
238,Cherry on top,"This was the last 2 days of a wonderful trip to Ireland! The staff was wonderful and very helpful! Just the setting alone was 5 star. We would also like to give a shout out to Adrian who offered directions for the train and a ride back and forth from Greystone for our day trip to Dublin and also offering us a light breakfast to go when we had to leave very early for our flight back home. We wished we had more time to spend here! Special place.
Thank you!!",5,2015,11,20
238,Amazing as always,"My partner and I recently stayed here for a 2 night midweek break. It was our th i 3rd time to stay here and it gets better each time! From our check in where the porter brought our bags up to our room for us, right through to checking out which was easy and quick, even though we didn't want to leave. The hotel is spotless, modern and beds so comfy. We both had treatments in the spa which we enjoyed thoroughly. Both therapists were very professional and felt very relaxed in the relaxation room afterwards. We ate in the bar which was very tasty including the desserts. Quick and friendly service from the lovely waiting staff. Breakfast was to die for and everything so fresh. We will definitely return soon. ",5,2015,11,19
238,24 Hours of Sheer Bliss,"You have to go here! Quality 5-star hotels don't come much better than Druids Glen. The staff were beyond exemplary and absolutely nothing was beyond them, from the concierge helping us with our overnight bags from the car, to the request for a late checkout. The food was ""top dollar"" again, Hugos restaurant for our evening meal and breakfast, was 5-star and the wine wasn't too pricey. We liked the food and service we had high tea before we left.",5,2015,11,16
238,Fantastic stay,"Just back from a fantastic stay at Druids Glen. From the moment we arrived and were given hot towels on check-in to when we left where we were given bottled water for our journey our stay was amazing. The staff were very friendly and attentive, and the food was just delicious. The variety of the breakfast buffet was one of the best I have seen. The spa treatment was second to none. The only sad point was that the weather didn't allow us to experience the beautiful grounds. All in all a truly wonderful stay and I would definitely recommend it. Looking forward already to coming back.",5,2015,11,16

Can't wait to go again.",5,2015,11,14
238,Great family resort,"Just checked out from a two night break at Druids Glen. Room was really spacious and luxurious. Travelled with a two year old and it's really rare to find five star luxury that is also 100% kid friendly. Great walking, golf, indoor and outdoor play areas and lovely touches such as the DVDs and board games for wet days. Loads to do in local area, we went to the sea life aquarium in Bray. Lots of dining options for both kids and adults and really lovely pool area. Your staff are a credit to you and the hotel was really nicely done up for Xmas!! We have rebooked for a short break in January...see you then!!",5,2015,11,13
238,Relaxing break in beautiful resort,My husband & I stayed Sunday through to Monday on a Groupon deal and couldn't speak highly enough of the hotel and staff. Our room was spacious and beautifully decorated with one of the most comfortable beds we have ever slept in. Bottle of prosecco chilling in our room on our return from lunch was very much appreciated. My husband used gym facilities and although small had a good selection of equipment. We ate in the hotel on Sunday night and it was very enjoyable but the best comments are kept for breakfast - such a selection! Guinness bread & walnut bread were some of the treats available & my husband was particularly impressed with the fresh honey comb. We would definitely recommend Druids Glen resort & will return again in the summer. ,5,2015,11,12
238,Yes Yes Yes!,"My Wife and i spent a night at Druids Glen last weekend with our objective being a relaxing weekend. from the moment we arrived at Druids Glen we had a five star experience right up until the moment we checked out. on arrival our luggage was taken in for us. we were offered hot towels to freshen up. this was our first break since getting married earlier this year and were upgraded to suite by the hotel. this was a lovely gesture. when we got to our suite we had chocolates with a welcome letter and some additional treats. We had some drinks in the bar that evening. My wife would recommend the strawberry Daiquiri while i was delighted with the craft beer options available. We dined at Hugo's that night and we were delighted with the food and service. clever presentation with super flavors. I had the duck for main and it was lovely. I recommend the French tempranillo to go with it. Desert for me has to be ice cream so i was very happy!! Another guest at dinner that night fell ill but thankfully some doctors were dining and were on hand to support her before the ambulance arrived. super reaction by them and the hotel staff. hope she is doing better now, We had a great sleep and after a super brekkie we took a walk down the trail which goes to the Druids Glen club house and museum. We left relaxed and refreshed and are already planning a return visit. this resort for us was a 10/10. Cannot fault the amazing service offered. well done Druids glen and thanks again.",5,2015,11,11
238,"lovely family destination, good location with lots to see in the area","Went with a late booking for two nights during October school break. 2 adults and two kids aged 12 and 14.
Overall excellent andf friendly service from the moment we arrived. Beautiful setting with the trees providing a range of autumnal colour.
Room was very good but maybe a bit cramped for us. Not hotels fault as we are probably beyond the shared family room at this stage. Well equipped room, good TV with good channel range and DVD supplied. Comfortable beds and well equipped and spacious bathroom. Room in immaculate condition and nice touch with the mints on the pillows each evening.
Dined in the bar on the first evening with a good choice for all of us. Good service and food was excellent. Dined in the dining room on the second night and this was really lovely. Hotel was busy and we had nor reserved a table as we intended eating in the bar again. Bar was very busy and a substantial delay looked likely. When we asked about the dining  room we were facilitated within 10 mins on what was a very busy evening. This was excellent made all the better by a waiter who was both helpful and entertaining at the same time. He made our kids feel very important and they are at the age where they want to be treated as adults (without acting like them I may add!!) 
Leisure centre and pool were very good and well maintained. Separate times for kids and adults only which made a big difference.Very busy at kids time but to be expected as during Halloween break from school. Our kids who love swimming really enjoyed it, Good jacuzzi, steam rooms etc. 
Overall the stay was on the expensive side but is a five star venue. Felt good value and certainly would like to visit again. Did not get near the golf courses which looked exceptional and would bring me back.
Good setting, attentive and friendly staff and well maintained premises.",4,2015,11,11
238,Shocking service ,"Have just returned from a one night stay in the Druids glen hotel. I can honestly say this has been one of the worst stays I have had in a hotel. The hotel itself is lovely, modern and clean but the entire staff are massively lacking in basic customer service training. The waiters at dinner were incredibly rude, gave no time to relax all plates were lifted as soon as we had finished the last bite, all felt very much like a conveyor belt. We then moved to the bar for a couple of drinks. With eight staff behind a bar we were still ignored and left sitting without a drink for quite a long time. I ordered a simple martini and 7up split and was given the martini and no split, was charged 4.60. The next martini I was then charged 10.00!! With no apology!! The staff were highly unprofessional. At breakfast this morning we queued for almost ten minutes to get a table. When we got to the buffet and got food we waited 20 minutes to get a pot of tea and toast.! A similar number of tables around us also waited a long time to receive a simple pot of tea. Also first thing this morning no hot water in the tap or in the shower. If all that was not enough, the receptionist while we were checking out did not even have bother to ask did we enjoy our stay!! The entire experience was overshadowed by a simple lack in customer service. Not what I expected from a five star hotel.  ",2,2015,11,07
238,Beautiful setting,This was our final stop on our Ireland trip. We arrived late and were greeted with hot refreshing face towels.  Our room was spacious and comfortable.  We took advantage of their awesome spa treatments.  The breakfast buffet was excellent and the staff at Druids Glen couldn't have been more accomodating.  This is a golf resort that next time we would take advantage of.,5,2015,11,07
238,Nice hotel but forget the internet,"Nice hotel surrounded by beautiful gardens, and staff is friendly. Wifi doesn't work in the rooms and takes forever to connect in the lobby, lobby and other areas are freezing cold. It's hard to believe that a hotel in Europe in 2015 still doesn't have internet.",3,2015,11,06
238,Mother/Daughter Weekend,"It was my first time to druid's glen, on arrival we were greeted with a big smile and a lovely welcome which made all the difference to the start of our Weekend. On the evening of our arrival, we had our dinner (BBQ style in the Bar outside) which I have to say was fabulous, the food was very well laid out and very tasty, and to round off the evening there was this lovely young man singing 60's, 70's and 80's music what a voice.!!!!. Now I am coming to the rest of the Hotel; Staff everywhere very attentive. Bedroom lovely and spacious, we had lovely view of the Grounds and Wicklow mountains. We liked the idea also that on our arrival we were handed a Map showing a lovely 5k walk which was very enjoyable as it was lovely and sunny. Would I return Yes,  and will be very soon.",5,2015,11,06
238,STUNNING,From the friendly staff at check in to the lovely open fires this is a great hotel.only a short drive from Dublin but yet it's still so peaceful and relaxing. My sister got married here(2014) and its everything that we remembered from the wedding. The bar menu could offer more but that's the only tiny little thing We would change. The grounds are lovely for photos and nice for a walk. Only problem we didn't stay longer. If your 50/50 on booking or not please stay as its everything they say it is and more. ,5,2015,11,06
238,Splendid!,"Our extended family met for a night here. I can only say - well done, Druid's Glen! Staff are amazing - the only place I have ever been where orders are taken without notes, and never failed to be spot on [and there were eight of us].  Ashlie was amazing in particular. We ate in the bar area - the food was perfectly cooked and presented. Breakfast was delicious - plenty of choice and variety and staff on hand for the personal touches.

This hotel really absorbs children well, and is very relaxing for parents. We didn't notice any 'unruly' kids, but did notice plenty of places for couples to curl up in.

The location is stunning. Finding the hotel can be a little tricky - would recommend coming off the N11 at Greystones and taking the lower road through Kilcoole; just outside Kilcoole there is a turn-off for hotel.

We will return for our family get togethers!",5,2015,11,05
238,Superb,"Stated for one night for husbands birthday. Great atmosphere and family friendly. Superb service, friendly staff for whom nothing was any trouble. Room lovely with view over glen. Bed was so comfortable I didn't wasn't to get up. Ate in bar and food was delicious. Will return. With my kids who will love it!!! Can't wait 😃😃",5,2015,11,01
238,Children treated like royalty ,Our 3 children were treated like royalty by the staff in this hotel. Lots of little touches make this place a luxurious stay. Games room isn't the usual money grabbing grubby room - it's clean with a good variety of entertainment and it's free. Popcorn and a movie in the room after dinner was a great wee touch. Bathrobes for the kids. Pool changing area can be a bit busy but there are some family changing rooms too. Breakfast is an excellent selection. We love returning to this hotel and we've recommended it to friends who love it too. ,5,2015,10,31
238,Faultless!!,"We stayed for two nights with two three year old twins. Says it is child friendly & it carries it through - park outside, playroom inside, clubs & movies for older kids. Didn't just pay lip service either to being child friendly staff were Brilliant with them too. Dinner in Hugo's the first night was stunning, we also ate in the bar the 2nd night and it was lovely too. In summary:
Staff: faultless
Food: flawless
Can't wait to go back!",5,2015,10,30
238,Great location and wonderful hotel. Out of control children,"I'd like to return to DG when it has figured out how to control access to families whose children are out of control. We were unable to find a quiet clean spot to have drinks or snacks due to several family groups setting up in the middle of the lobby, bar area, and sun porch. Children ran the halls, wrestled in the halls, and dodged in and out of rooms unmonitored. (Some families had their kids under control and were wonderful.) hats off to the staff who dealt professionally with this but not a place for couples looking for a quiet elegant spot. Hope DG gets it figured out. ",4,2015,10,30
238,Anniversary break,"Stayed at Druids Glen on 23rd October. Booked to have massage which was excellent, we were well looked after. We stayed in the superior room which was very nice and spacious, lovely toiletries. Lovely view. One hing i would say is i did not find the beds the most comforable which meant i did not have the best sleep. As it was our anniversary they kindly gave us some lovely Butlers choclates in the room. Breakfast was fabulous!! Will be back for a return trip.",5,2015,10,29
238,Lovely midweek break in Druids Glen,"Had a lovely midweek break in Druids Glen this month, it ticked all the boxes. Staff were very helpful throughout our stay, it was a lovely gesture to give us bottles of water leaving to go home. Breakfast is lovely, there is a huge variety of foods so it caters for everyone, they even have gluten free section. We had dinner in the bar one night also and the food was lovely, would definitely recommend. Leisure and spa facilities are lovely, thoroughly enjoyed our treatment in the spa.",5,2015,10,28
238,Weekend Break.2 Nites xx,"Druids Glen, Newtownmount Kennedy Ireland is an Amazing 5star Resort we went there for our 2 nite break away and to be near to Sugar Loaf Mountain which we climbed, thankfully it was a easy climb as described by staff and a magical view from the top. Staff in the Hotel very hands on each and every one especially the butler a pleasant man to meet. Food was lovely as for the buffet breakfast spread was fabulous. Immaculately clean and spacious and parking easy. Definitely hope to return again XX",5,2015,10,26
238,Excellent!,"I visited Druids Glen for 2 nights with my wife for a mid week break. The superior room was well designed, clean and very comfortable with a magnificent view of the 13th hole. Breakfast was excellent, as was our evening meal in The Thirteenth Bar. Staff were efficient and friendly although I felt the order for coffee and toast should be taken as we entered the room for breakfast not when we're almost finished our breakfast. 
I would definitely recommend Druids Glen Resort for its attention to detail and we will be back in the future.",5,2015,10,23
238,Family break ,What a great hotel not far from Dublin. Staff are great really helpful. The children had a great time this is our fourth time to stay here. Great facilities swimming pool and the location. Well done to everyone. ,5,2015,10,21
238,So welcoming,"This was a very impressive little find....hotel itself is well finished, rooms are very homely, views are fab....food in the hotel bar is fabulous along with high quality breakfast options!!hot hand towels on arrival an little bottles of water on departure was such a nice touch!!will definitely be recommending it:)",5,2015,10,19
238,A most enjoyable stay in a lovely hotel,"My husband and I stayed for one night getaway recently and were really impressed with everything about this hotel.  The staff particularly were so efficient and friendly and there was lots of them. The hotel is in a beautiful location, the rooms were very spacious and spotlessly clean and the food, we had both lunch and dinner in the 13th bar, was delicious.

For a large, relatively new building it felt very warm and welcoming and we will definitely be returning.  Well done, Druids Glen.",5,2015,10,19
238,Total Relaxation,"We stayed on Friday night for one night only.  A little bit difficult to find but once we were there check in was very smooth.  We were offered hot towels at reception which was very welcome.  Concierge parked our car and took our bags to the room.  Staff all very friendly on arrival and throughout our stay.

We booked two Spa treatments which were just wonderful.  I would like to give a special  mention to Catriona who did reflexology for me - she was fantastic.  We didn't use the pool so I can't comment on it.

We had dinner in their Hugo Restaurant and the food was excellent.  After a mix up with the starters, we thoroughly enjoyed our meal.  I had fillet steak and it was cooked to perfection, my husband had fish.  The lady that took our order and looked after our table was very helpful and friendly.

We both slept extremely well, we had asked for a quiet room (131) no noise at all.  The bed and pillows were very comfortable and we had a great sleep, although I think the reflexology played a big part! Our room was very clean, spacious, plenty of towels, bathroom spotless, two extra pillows which we used.  

We got breakfast delivered to our room, arrived on time, order correct, very enjoyable. Check out was easy, bottled water supplied for our journey home.

I would recommend this hotel to family and friends.  I would love to return for another break soon.",5,2015,10,18
238,fantastic,"Stayed in druids glen recently and i would gladly go back in a heart beat staff were absolutely brilliant hotel is spectacular,the food was to die for also. Planning 
on going back really soon.i would recommend this hotel to anyone. Family are looking into going all ready ",5,2015,10,17
238,Great for a weekend break ,"Really impressed with how friendly the staff are, they are willing to go that bit extra and all make you feel welcome.

The kids playroom and little playground are great, combined with an overall child friendly policy makes it a breeze to be here with your kids.

Will definitely be back & maybe I'll even get a round of golf in.",5,2015,10,17
238,Perfect mid week break,"Simply stunning, from the moment we arrived the welcome was fantastic warm towel. Rooms where stunning views over wicklow mts. Restaurant menu was appealing we had chef special starter sea food no lemon unfortunately followed by lamb cooked pink absolutely perfect. Bar service was super also. Nothing to much trouble really friendly staff and management. I'll be back hopefully ",5,2015,10,17
238,Great Stay,"We stayed here for a few nights during a family break to Dublin. The hotel staff could not have been more friendly and welcoming generally. We ate in Hugo's restaurant first night and the food was fabulous and the staff fantastic a real asset to the hotel. The hotel was set up really well for families between the pool , good play room facilities, driving range and bycyles all of which was complimentary. We also used the spa facility and had a fantastic treatment again staff could not have been nicer and also got a discount as we were staying on the hotel. The breakfasts were top class and again nothing was a problem and the staff again so nice. The kids each night were able to pick DVD's which were also given with popcorn which was a lovely friendly touch all complimentary. Our room faced out to the golf course and wad just perfect again great fir families. On departure again very friendly nd we were given bottles of water for our journey. Generally a great family friendly clean hotel with great facilities and amazing staff. Definitely be back and recommendations will be made. Hope you enjoy too  as much as we did . Thanks for making our stay special.",5,2015,10,16
238,Not just a Golf Resort!!! Top marks for family too,"Stayed for 3 nights with my wife and 2 very young Daughters. I know of its Golfing reputation but it gets top marks for kids too. A soft play room, well equiped outdoor playground, easily accessed swimming pool, top notch Menu and food for both Kids and Adults, not to mention fantastic staff who made the kids feel just as welcome as us. If you have a young family and want a hotel that ticks all of the boxes you cant go far wrong with Druids Glen",5,2015,10,13
238,Golf hotel  in a nice landscape,"large room and bathoom; good wardrobe space and lighting better than in most hotels.
All well maintained; very friendly and helpfull staff. Good breakfast buffet. but very expensive bar and restaurant.
Restaurant menue on Sunday evening very limited",4,2015,10,13
238,Family weekend.,"We went away for family weekend with our two daughters, the staff couldn't be any more helpful, they were so pleasant and attentive made our girls very welcome and comfortable, food delicious, facilities were fantastic! Would highly recommend! ",5,2015,10,12
238,Excellent hotel,"We stayed here for one night (my husband, 18 month old daughter and I) and we loved it so much we are already thinking about when we can go back!!

We were made feel so welcome from the moment we stepped out of the car. Every staff member we encountered, they were so friendly and helpfulness, nothing was too much for them...even when out little girl was sick & we needed the bed linen changed. 

The facilities for kids are brilliant...playground on site, playroom indoors, swimming and although we didn't need it, the baby room with changers, sterilisers etc is a welcome addition to any parents travelling with little ones.

We will definitely be back!!!",5,2015,10,12
238,Lovely hotel,"We booked in for one night and wished that we had been able to stay for longer. We were made to feel welcome from the moment we reached the entrance door to the moment we left. Our room was lovely, bathroom products perfect, the grounds stunning, spa lovely and food excellent. The staff are wonderful and we would like to thank them  all for making us feel so comfortable.",5,2015,10,11
238,Fantastic staff,"Lovely hotel, lovely food but service was outstanding. I was here with my mother & daughter and everyone we dealt with went out of their way to approach my daughter & make conversation (shes 2 so full of chat!) I thought it was a really nice touch. We didnt get to go far because of the rain but there is a brilliant play room & the complimentary dvds & popcorn were appreciated that night!",5,2015,10,07
238,2 night stay...,Really enjoyed our stay here after it being recommended by friends who have stayed before - found the staff really helpful and pleasant - swimming pool good size dinner and breakfast lovely - nice touch to be able to have a drink outside as there were patio heaters - would stay again!,5,2015,10,06
238,Amazing as always,"From the moment you check in this hotel is special. We stayed in a suite which is huge and offers the cosy comfort of a fire in the living room. The outdoor area next to the bar has heated lamps and is so tranquil. We have stayed here many times and without doubt this is our favourite hotel in the area. Very comfortable beds, good showers, tasty bar food and spotlessly clean. 5 stars! ",5,2015,10,05
238,Family weekend ,"Fantastic hotel with great staff and great food ,the rooms are all very nice ,we all went for a bike ride around the complex with bikes supplied by the hotel 
2 good golf courses on site 
Only a half hour drive from Dublin 
The swimming pool area food do with some work but apart from that it is perfect ",5,2015,10,05
238,Outrageous price for one night B&B.......And you can't book it online!,"We had previously stayed in this hotel and thought the standards were extremely high.  Our room was beautiful and breakfast was great with lots of choice.  
We are now due to play golf here next week and tried to book a room for the night  (including dinner) before our game.  On the website you can only book for a minimum of 2 nights and when I rang reservations I was told the only room they could offer for 1 night was €305 B&B!  I tried again today and was told that they really prefer to book for 2 nights but had found a room for €225B&B per night.
I just feel this is really bad customer services and definitely wont be recommending this hotel to anyone.",2,2015,10,05
238,Spectacular Wedding Venue,"We chose the Druids Glen Resort as the location for our wedding reception in October 2014. Even though it's almost one year on, we still feel so grateful and delighted with the service we received from the outset while dealing with the staff at Druids Glen Resort. 

The beautiful venue is located in the lush Co. Wicklow village of Newtownmountkennedy but is conveniently located only minutes from the M11/M50. We chose to get married in the quaint, little, white church (St. Patricks) in Kilquade and only had to travel five minutes around the the corner to reach Druids Glen for our reception and photographs. We are thrilled with the beautiful photos taken on location...we were even lucky enough to have our wedding featured on a well known Irish wedding website.

Special mention must be made of Nessa Kearney, the wedding planner at Druids Glen. Before we were married, we don' t think we fully appreciated how crucial a good wedding planner is to the smooth running of your big day. From the very first meeting, Nessa was an absolute pleasure to deal with. She was always prompt to respond, she provided sound advice when required and nothing was too much trouble in terms of the additional, special, little touches we wanted the venue to cater for. Most importantly, she was present on the day and ensured everything ran just as we had planned.

Our reception was held in an exquisite room away from the main hotel lobby. This gave us and our guests the impression of complete privacy but at the same time because we were located in the hotel many of our guests chose to book rooms in the hotel meaning there was no hassle trying to get taxis at the end of the night.

Finally, the food itself was fantastic. We have returned to Druids Glen on several occasions since and have never had a bad meal there.

We have absolutely no reservations in recommending Druids Glen Resort as a wedding venue.It truly is second to none in terms of service, price and quality.

Sean and Claire de Jong",5,2015,10,03
238,Under the spell,"In company with my son and two friends we have recently returned from our second visit to Druids Glen and as their logo says have definitely fallen "" under the spell"". Everything about this hotel and the facilities is superb. The rooms restaurant leisure facilities and the golf are simply outstanding. Nothing is too much trouble for the very friendly yet professional staff and I would  particularly single out Marie on the front desk  for all her help and Maeve in the restaurant where we dined and wined to our full one evening. The food was of a very high standard complimented by some excellent wine.  If time and money allow we will certainly be back again - cannot wait!!!",5,2015,10,03
238,Fabulous Druids Glen Resot,"What a fabulous experience we had from beginning to end on our stay.From the 1st moment the welcome from the conceirge and  staff was so warm ,the room was lovely and spacious- more than adequate for 2 adults and a boysterous 2 yr old! The hotel strikes a perfect between being a ""family friendly"" hotel and  a luxurious stay- with the leisure centre , spa,playground there's something for everyone.As for the food- breakfast alone is worth the stay and the evening fare was delicious. We will be back :)",5,2015,10,01
238,"Beautiful Hotel...Food Lets It Down,","I stayed here for a company social event in June, the hotel rooms and ground are beautiful, you cannot fault the luxury of the room, beds are the comfiest I have ever stayed in aside from my own! From check in we were greeted with warm towels, staff were friendly and attentive, ensuring you have everything you need. Even when we checked out early the next morning we were given small bottles of water as we left, a small token but much appreciated on what as a hot day. However on the night we all had a meal in their restaurant - this is where I felt so let down, although the food was yummy there was barely anything on the plate! I've never been so disappointed to finish a meal in 2 bites. Given the costs of the food, it just did not live up to expectation. I would return to the hotel but suggest anyone to bring their own snacks, especially if intending to have a few glasses of wine along with it!",4,2015,10,01
238,Highly Recommended,"I can not recommend this hotel highly enough.  We held my sons christening celebrations in Druids Glen Resort this week, and from start to finish the experience was fantastic.  The food was excellent, and it's easy to see why Hugo's restaurant has 2 AA Rosette awards.  The portions were generous, whilst the food quality was top class.  All our guests commented on how good the food was. The service was equally as impressive -  friendly, good natured, prompt and attentive.  Nothing we asked for was too much trouble.
Children are very well catered for at Druids Glen.  The children's menu was the best I have seen in a long time, with lots of choice.  The children in our group were kept occupied with crayons and an activity book when we sat down.  There is as a brilliant playroom in the hotel ideal for keeping little people happy when the weather isn't great and there is a really good playground outside.  This hotel can't be beaten if you are looking for great food and service, especially if you are bringing the children!",5,2015,09,30
238,Great time at the Glen!,"A group of sixteen golfers stayed here last weekend. The hotel was excellent in every aspect. Well proportioned and comfortable rooms - extra large single beds made sharing a lot easier.
The food both for breakfast and dinner was first class and efficiently and pleasantly served. Indeed the friendliness and helpfulness of all the staff was a feature of the hotel. They all worked extremely hard  at making your stay as memorable and comfortable as possible - a  credit to the establishment.
I would recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a touch of class outwith Dublin.",5,2015,09,30
238,"Amazing service, top class","We booked this resort to celebrate a special birthday. The rooms were great, the food fantastic but it was the staff that made the difference. So friendly and professional. We will be back!!

The weekend was great value and the surroundings were lovely. I would highly recommend this hotel ",5,2015,09,28
238,"Fantastic Hotel With Great Service, Rooms & Food","Overall an excellent hotel and we really did enjoy our two night stay. From the hot hand towels at check-in to the complementary bottles of water at checkout we had a fantastic stay. The room was clean, large, comfortable and perfect for relaxing in. We had breakfast served to our room both mornings and the trolley with the heated compartment meant that our food (and toast) was lovely and warm when we sat down to eat. The food in the 'Thirteenth' was excellent value with great service.The bar was lovely with lots of staff at hand (but it was hard at times to catch their eye for a drink). Live music on both Friday and Saturday night. We stayed in a certain so called award winning 5* hotel not a million miles away from here about 6 months ago and can honestly say that the Druids Glen Resort was miles ahead in all departments. Good to see one of the stars of the TV show 'The Shelbourne' working there now also in a senior role. Will definitely return to stay again in the future.",5,2015,09,27
238,"Comfort, courtesy and elegance.","We have fallen under their spell. From the minute I booked this hotel, and explained that it was a special treat for my partners birthday, we were treated with the highest professionalism. All our requests were promptly dealt with and handled to the letter by the wonderful staff on reception.
When we arrived at the hotel it has a beautiful driveway up to the main entrance, with scenic views over the golf course, and beyond to the sea. The grounds are a credit to the staff who manicure the lawns and tend to all the gardening needs. We arrived at the reception desk and immediately were treated like royalty, and given the key cards to our room. There was a nice chap assigned to bring our luggage to the room, which was a lovely touch, considering what a lot of other hotels dont provide. When we got to our room, we were absolutely delighted with the cleanliness and size of it. They had left a card and some chocolates for my partner for her birthday. 
My partner wanted to lie on the bed to check it for comfort, as she needs a good bed after having had spine surgery and other health issues. It was just perfect for her needs, but then we realised that the mattress topper was feather, as was the duvet and pillows. We both have asthma, so this was not going to go well. I felt terrible having to ring down to reception to ask them to come up and remake the bed using fiber instead of feather. They asked us to hold tight for a few minutes and they would call us back. After no more than five minutes, the phone rang, and they said they would move us to another room which was being made up especially for us. A manager appeared at the door and helped us to move our luggage down the corridor to our new room. As we arrived at the door, I spotted it had a double door in front, and suggested to my partner that it looked like a suite from the outside. The manager confirmed that it was indeed a suite, as the hotel was full and this was the only room available.
I could not get over the size and space in the suite, with a huge lounge area and massive bedroom. Flat screen tv in both and other little extras that would make our stay even more pleasant. It really was the lap of luxury for us, and the bed was extremely comfortable also..
On the first night we dined in the hotels 13th lounge, as we thought the menu was very appetising, and we were not disappointed. Our waiter was a very nice chap, who was always to hand, without being in your face. Why cant all hotel managers train people to be like the staff at Druids, and hand pick the right person for the job that suits them, which they know how to carry out properly.
On the next morning we opted to have breakfast delivered to the room to make use of the dining table and the view. After a couple of hours we went to the pool and were able to use the steam rooms, saunas and jacuzzi. A wonderful way of easing away the stresses of life and work. I had to head off to work the next morning, and would have been gone before the breakfast, so they had a lovely breakfast pack waiting for me at the reception. My partner stayed on in the room and had her breakfast delivered up to her, and again made use of the wonderful pool facilities.
I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough, and with it only being 30 min from us in  Dublin, yet a world apart in atmosphere and surroundings. We will most definitely be back here very soon, for the quality, value and service a proper 5 star hotel offers.",5,2015,09,26
238,Warm welcome with fab food!!!,Stayed here last weekend and I can say we had a great time. Reception was extremely helpful upon arrival. Our room was spotless and the nice touch of butlers chocolates in the room was lovely. We ate in the bar in the evening and I must say the food was absolutely gorgeous. The bar is a hive of activity with lots of people coming and going. There is plenty of staff walking around to take your orders if you want a drink.  Breakfast next morning was plentiful and fab. You can even have freshly prepared omelettes made while you wait. The only downside to our stay was that the bed was on the small size. However this has definitely not put us off returning again. ,4,2015,09,24
238,Spa Getaway,"We stayed here for our first wedding anniversary. It was amazing!!! From the minute we arrived the staff went over and above to make our stay special! When the lady on reception found out that we were staying for our anniversary she sent chocolates and a card to our room! All spa treatments were fantastic, food was amazing from the bar and restaurant and the general decor and facilities of the hotel were stunning! Would highly recommend this hotel!! :) ",5,2015,09,22
238,"Second Visit, still excellent hotel","This was my second visit to Druids Glen resort and as with my first visit the best thing about this hotel are the staff.  They are helpful and friendly without being intrusive or overbearing.  I stayed in the hotel as I had a voucher that was given to me as a gift.  It was the first time I stayed here with a child and one little grumble I had was that our room was a long way from reception which is sometimes difficult with all the paraphernalia that come with having a child in tow, having said that the room was lovely, very spacious and comfortable.  We ate both in the bar and the restaurant, the food in the restaurant in particular was excellent, the dessert was one of the nicest I have ever had.  I played 9 holes of golf on the Druids heath course in the evening when things were quiet,  I would like to have been told that the greens were sanded as I probably would have opted to play on the Glen instead if I had known this.  Overall it's an excellent hotel, again it's biggest asset are the staff who across the board were great.",5,2015,09,21
238,Great place to stay,"The resort was  wonderful! The grounds on the resort were vast and beautiful. We found the staff to be friendly and eager to please. My husband got a massage and enjoyed it immensely, as he had quite a lot of kinks from driving, It is VERY clean as that is important to us. The breakfast buffet was wonderful.",5,2015,09,16
238,Disappointing really,"Recently spent a 2 night mid week break in Druids Glen.  It had been a long summer both health wise & weather wise so a nice relaxing break was in order with a bit of golf thrown in for my husband.  Our package was for 2 B&B's & 1 dinner in Hugo's 5 Star restaurant.  Checkin was fine & we got a room with golf course view (partial) as requested.   We had lunch in the Bar & enjoyed it but as there were lots & lots of families there we decided we'd have dinner in Hugo's restaurant our first night too.  Restaurant nice decor, bright & airy but tables very close together.  Food very much nouvelle cuisine but that was okay too as we had a late lunch.   Starters & mains were good (lots of foam but with flavor) but the mash potato that came as an accompaniment to my husbands meal was bad!  Firstly, it was grey in colour, watery in flavour & reeking of salt!!! I mean reeking...,  I said nothing because the few days away were a surprise treat for my hubby & he doesn't like any fuss, for whatever reason.   Next day dawnednice & sunny but he was just on the 1st tee at Druid's Heath when the torrential rain started.  To his credit, as he is a fair weather golfer really, he stuck out the 18 holes of golf but while he was mostly dry at the end of the round, his rain gear, golf bag, shoes & clubs were not!  To our disappointment, the hotel had no facilities for drying golfers' gear.  I asked if they could be out in a boiler house even but no, so our bathroom was strewn with the clothing & the bedroom floor with the bag, clubs & shoes & we turned the heating up to maximum when we went for dinner.  Druids Glen Resort being advertised worldwide as a haven for golfers & given the Irish climate, one would think that facilities for drying golf gear would be available.  Am I being unreasonable?  I, meanwhile, spent the day having a cliff walk & pub lunch in Greystones.  Got somewhat wet but ..., then in late afternoon I had a beautiful head, neck, shoulder, arms & face massage which was bliss & ended with a wonderful facial.

Anyway, bedroom like a sauna, we returned to Hugo's restaurant for dinner again.  This was the dinner included in the package & the same menu was available to choose from with some supplements.  All was good until my main course of salmon was served.  The two little rectangles of salmon were beautiful presented on the plate with lots of foam, a grilled cherry tomato halved & four spears of asparagus.  Salmon, pan fried, looked well cooked until I got into the centre portion of first rectangle.  It was nearly raw.  I commenced to eat the second rectangle when the waitress arrived to check if everything was okay.  I showed her the uncooked salmon & asked if it could be cooked some more whereupon she insisted on removing my plate & said I'd have a replacement in 5 mins.  Meanwhile, I nibbled on the delicious hand cut chips.  Yes, they were really delicious, crisp on the outside & fluffy & full of flavour on the inside.  Spud choice so important.  It is very hard to get a good chip these days so I was impressed.  Meanwhile, my hubby dined on & within 5 mins my new salmon plate arrived.  This time the plate was adorned with slivers of courgette, & a tiny cherry tomato halved again.  I commenced eating but the salmon was so strong in taste, I left 3/4 of it!  My lovely asparagus spears were not replaced/returned so I filled up on cherry tomato & chips, not being a great courgette fan.  On collecting the plates the waitress never commented.  Desserts were good.   Overall our two dining experiences in Hugo's restaurant were very disappointing.  We know & like our food,  & being Irish, love our spuds.  Forget the foam just get the basics right first.

The hotel room was nice & spacious & tastefully decorated. It as a very nice size with both a desk & chair & then a little circular table & two comfortable chairs.  Our room had a balcony (extra) but a person, big or small could not stand on it.  It was for decoration only.  Thankfully, the bathroom had both a bath & walk in shower & the lighting was good.  Overhead the bath a clothes line could be stretched across & this proved a god send & its strength was tested to the full!

The bar area, lounges & terrace were lovely but the reception area lacked nice seating areas to chill & read.  The oval sunken seating area was small & hadn't great light & there were couches stuck  in small recesses here & there around the foyer.  There was a lovely outside playground outside for fine day usage but wet days saw the kiddies run & race in all the public areas.  Swimming pool & spa were lovely too.

On our day of departure, a beautiful day dawned & held up for a most enjoyable round of golf for my hubby on the Druids Glen course.  I had late check out and enjoyed a long walk around the grounds & perimeter of the two courses before doing so.  We enjoyed a lovely lunch in the Druids Glen clubhouse on conclusion before heading home.",3,2015,09,16
238,Relaxed but stylish,"My first stay in Druids Glen resort and it was an excellent experience overall.

The meal in Hugo's restaurant was excellent with great selection and all food cooked to perfection. The staff were polite, courteous and very knowledgeable.

The room was large and very well appointed with a spacious bathroom and all the little extras to make the stay very comfortable.",5,2015,09,15
238,Amazing!!,"Beautiful place with amazing staff. Great beds. Amazing linens, DVD player, iron , blow dryer. Everyone was extremely accommodating.., especially the front desk. 
We went to the club house for drinks and dinner and was very impressed. Only wish we had time to golf. Pool area was very nice. Can't wait to come back. It was magical. ",5,2015,09,13
238,Slightly tired,"So booked in for two nights b&b plus one evening meal.  Hotel situated around beautiful Wicklow however the hotel seriously needs a make over. Reception area very dull in decor drapes and sofas are tired looking. Heavy smell of chlorine was my first impression. Reception was fine apart from two out of three Visa card machines not working. Then to the hotel room itself quoted as a deluxe room these hotel owners really need to have a look at similar hotels in belfast as this was a fairly shabby standard room from the wallpaper peeling in the bathroom to the dated marble effect and cracked sink. The bed was clean and comfy but again the yards of Apple green dupion silk used in the hallways and again in the bedrooms were far from luxurious. The bar areas were clean and staff efficient. Hugos restaurant was very good as far as fine dining is concerned. The leisure facilities were just ok and the spa was good,,,.overall for a five star hotel rating this is not. Expensive overrated and dated. Wouldn't recommend and won't be returning. More value and style closer to home.",3,2015,09,12
238,Really incredible place,"Really close to Dublin, facilities to suit everyone (spa, gym, sauna, pool, walking trail, playground, selection of DVDs), gorgeous food and really comfortable rooms. Friendly and helpful staff. Breakfast was especially good!",5,2015,09,11
238,lovely break but check your bill!!!!,"Spent two nights in the druids glen recently compliments of our daughter who had booked it for us as an anniversary present. On arrival we were given a complementary upgrade to a beautiful Suite. The hotel is pure luxury and all the staff are very friendly. Breakfast is a wonderful selection of delicious food. We also enjoyed the pool. Our only disappointment was on checking out when we were handed a bill for our stay even though our daughter had been in touch with the hotel several times before our arrival with regard to payment. We had to sit in reception for fifteen minutes while the matter was checked. The manager while very friendly claimed there was no knowledge of our daughters involvement in the booking. Eventually we left and we were assured that the hotel would contact us when the matter was sorted. In the meantime our daughter was contacted and payment was made. To date we have had no contact from the hotel which is very disappointing as their handling of this matter caused us great embarrassment on the day. It wasn't our first visit to the hotel but it may well be our last!!
",4,2015,09,10
238,A touch of luxury,"Our group of six traveling by car through Ireland treated ourselves to comfort and luxury in the beautiful surroundings of the Wicklow Mountains as our final destination in Ireland. Our other stays included mostly B & B's as well as a house we rented Kenmare. It felt a very nice change to be in a beautiful spacious hotel, treated with every comfort beginning with the warm wash towels provided at the front desk upon arrival, to the lovely bar and lounge, to the delicious dinner and then breakfast buffet, friendly and professional service and finally the very comfortable bed. Though we didn't play golf while there, we wish we had had the time to take advantage of all the resort had to offer. This was a convenient stop within easy reach of visiting Glenalough and Powerscourt on our way back to Dublin and the flight home. However, it is not a different experience than you would have at a similar golf resort in the USA, so if you are still seeking a more traditional and historic Irish atmosphere, you should find it elsewhere. It is a little hard to find, needed to enter GPS coordinates.",5,2015,09,10
238,Relaxing in luxury! ,I stayed for 2 weeks; end of august/first of September. The staff of Druids Glen are wonderful! They were prompt in full filling any needs/wants and helpful with suggestions of things to do around the area. Loved my time in Ireland and cannot wait to return. Will recommend this establishment to others. ,5,2015,09,08
238,True 5 star experience ,"Usually hotels are not what you're expecting but I can say this was everything we expected and much more. Stayed 2 nights bed n breakfast with 2 rounds of golf. Staff were welcoming and efficient from the moment we arrived. Good quality rooms and furniture nothing tacky whatsoever. The blackout curtains and soundproof of the rooms are astonishing, we nearly missed breakfast because we thought it was still nighttime! 
Had dinner at the silver spoon restaurant which was absolutely amazing, professional and friendly service and exquisitely displayed food with good proportions. 
Had some drinks at the Thirteenth Bar, very well priced cocktails that were super tasty. Tried dinner at the Thirteenth Bar the following night which was a more relaxed vibe and pub style meals which is just what we needed.
Breakfast buffet was excellent quality with so much variety for everyone. 
We were very lucky with the weather which made the golfing experience that much more amazing. Druids Heath course was enjoyable but when we got to Druids Glen my gosh! It was the most well maintained and luscious green course I've ever been to. 
Can not commend the service enough, every staff knew their job well and did it with excellence. 
What a gem of a place, they've got a really good thing going on here. If you can spend the money looking for a luxurious relaxing holiday this is the place to go.",5,2015,09,08
238,Perfect in every way,"From check-in to check-out there was little to nothing we could complain about. Food, beds, staff were all fantastic.

My wife had a lovely massage, we used the pool and sauna/steam room, we ate in Hugo's which was fantastic, beds were ridiculously comfortable, staff were knowledgeable and very friendly.

It wasn't stuffy or ostentatious, it was laid back luxury.

Overall we couldn't have asked for more.

Wifi is fairly slow and the main meal in Hugo's was tepid rather than hot. But that's it really. That's me stretching to find some negatives to write.",5,2015,09,08
238,Excellent rooms. Spacious. Quiet,"Here for 2 nights to play golf. Very happy with the service at front desk and overall friendliness.
Fabulous rooms. Nicely furnished. Comfy beds and quiet. Good bathroom with quality L'ocetean products
Good breakfast but disappointing food in 13th bar. Tired. Overpriced. It sadly lets the redort down. ",4,2015,09,07
238,Romantic and Luxurious Weekend,"Had wonderful visit at Druids Glen with some friends. My husband played golf Sunday morning with his friend and I relaxed at the spa with Trasa. Michelle who greeted us was very welcoming. Fabulous facilities. Enjoyed the jacuzzi, steam room and sauna. We adjourned to the relaxation room where we enjoyed fruit, cold drinks and calming music. The staff at Druids Glen Hotel were very welcoming and warm as we checked in. Room very comfy. Enjoyed a bath later in day. Before dinner headed to The Thirteenth Bar for cocktail which were very colourful and tasty. Went to Hugo's Restaurant where we enjoyed the most amazing dinner served by Olwyn from India. I started with scallops recommended by Olwyn and then had steak. Delicious. As for the breakfast what a selection - had a lovely savoury omelette. Plenty of goodies, cold and hot buffet, fruit, yogurt, cheese selection, fabulous pastries, cereals, porridge, thanks to all the staff as very kind and helpful.",5,2015,09,07
238,Excellent,"Stayed here for 5 nights in August, wanted to go back for my 50th in October but looking on website they don't have the room, emailed twice but no response yet.  Also would like to book for Christmas!   As you can tell i absolutely loved this hotel, staff could not do enough for you.  There were a lot of families as unfortunately my hubby and I have to take time off during school hols, but we managed to time things right to avoid them!   Also tried the spa which was excellent, food out of this world and hubby loved the gym.",5,2015,09,07
238,True 5*****,"From start to finish, I could not recommend this hotel enough. I have stayed in some wonderful hotels in the world and this is up there withe best of them,
. The staff were always helpful and attentive. We were in Ireland to arrange to meet family of my wife and mother-in-law. It seemed easiest for us to all meet at the hotel as we had relatives coming from all over Ireland and the world. We hire one of their beautiful rooms  for the afternoon and had 45 people and children to cater for. The food that was provide for us was excellent. the staff that were provided for us were 1st class and could not do enough. The food was very good and my wife complimented the chef on several occasion's . The grounds were beautiful as were the golf courses . My son and I spent a day playing the Druid's Heath course and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Whenever we will be visiting Ireland we could not stay anywhere else,",5,2015,09,06
238,Romantic weekend away,"Druids glen resort sits in a magical Valley surrendered by mountains yet again with a great view of the sea. If love golfing you will not be disappointed. If you are not a golfer we would strongly recommend a guided walk around the resort.

We were greated with a warm welcome, we stayed in a room on the second floor with garden view, only a short stroll from the spa. The room was very large, clean and with nice view. The bathroom is quite basic not what you expect from a 5 star resort. But very clean and with good products (shower gel, shampoo, cream etc..) 

We had an unpleasant experience at the main restaurant. We booked a meal and while we were promptly greated nd seated were were left waiting for over an hour between courses! We asked the waiter what happened with our maincourse he said the restaurant was busy. He offered more bread but no apologies. After an hour and no maincourse we asked.for the manager,  which equally fobbed us off with the same excuse, no apology, but the returned with a free bottle of wine. 

I say we were just unlucky. They must have misplaced our order as we noticed other tables that arrived after us the were served before us. Anyway that was the only incident during  our short stay.

We loved the resort would recommend it",4,2015,09,06
238,"Arrive by day, not night","This is more a review of finding your way to and from the Druids Glen in the dark - MIGHTY DIFFICULT !! All the signs pointing to the Druids Glen  are non-reflective brown and white and hidden away out of the line of light from the headlights. Even as an Irish driver I nearly had a few near misses on the badly signposted local roads, if I was a local driving it everyday I'd be ok but it is dangerous especially after dark. Both the resort and the local county council should improve the road signage !",4,2015,09,04
238,Check you bill carefully,"Having travelled from London with  my wife for her birthday we were so disappointed by whole experience .this was made worse when our bill was presented .we were told the bill had been checked but on checking it we had items on the bill that were nothing to do with us .no apology was given and after the owners offered a complimentary re visit we returned in anticipation that it would be ok .the owners instigated an investigation by their auditors .
We returned and unbelievably again we had items on our bill that should not have been there .
The hotel knew we were returning but made no effort to make us feel welcome .
We are so disappointed by the whole experience .",1,2015,09,03
238,Great Service and Posh,"What a nice change, beautiful/clean accommodations, coupled with great service and wonderful food.  When checking in the doorman presented my husband and I with a warm washcloth each tied with a sprig of lavender and inquired if we'd like to wash our hands.  It appeared all staff took pride in what they were doing.  Checking out we were provided with bottled water, were thanked for choosing to stay and encouraged to have safe travels.  Glad we chose to stay here!",5,2015,09,03
238,Enjoyable and relaxing weekend stay,"Just spent a most relaxing and enjoyable weekend at Druid's Glen resort in Co. Wicklow. The accommodation was spacious and comfortable, the staff without exception extremely pleasant, and the food excellent. The facilities, spa, pool and golf all readily accessible and again the staff very helpful. All in all a very enjoyable stay and a venue which I would certainly recommend and will certainly be back.",5,2015,09,01
238,Amazing Adrian ,"The hotel is amazing but we had a small incident at Hugo's restaurant, however, Adrian dealt with this in such a fantastic way that we decided to go back to the hotel later in the week. This kind of customer service is invaluable in a hotel of this standard. I hope the Druids Glen appreciate the brilliant work she does.",5,2015,09,01
238,Our Favourite Hotel :-),"Just returned from our third stay in this wonderful hotel.  Each time we visit it seems to get better if that is at all possible!  Beautiful, clean, spacious rooms with little touches that make all the difference (ie. tiny bathrobes for the children!).  Staff are so friendly and honestly go out of their way to make you feel welcome.  Food in bar and restaurant great as usual.  Our two children attended the kids club and loved it. Lots of personal little touches that made our stay so enjoyable.  Can't wait until we return!!
P.s.  thank you for the chocolates :)",5,2015,09,01
238,Nice hotel but rooms very noisy,Stayed here for the weekend with family. The hotel itself was lovely but we had a terrible night's sleep both nights due being able to hear the TV in the room next door both late at night and early in the morning. Any noise on the corridor could also be heard perfectly in the rooms. Next door's TV may as well have been on in our own room we could hear it so well and as a result we would unfortunately never return to Druid's Glen. For a 5-star hotel and the price I think the rooms should have better sound proofing. Its a shame as otherwise this hotel has a lot to offer.,3,2015,09,01
238,Almost Excellent......,"I could rate it excellent, but excellence is something to strive for and everything I've seen suggests this is a hotel reaching for it with many hands. And so rests my confidence that my next stay will be even better than my last.

While being situated beside a golf resort this is not exclusively for the business, golfer or solo traveller but very much a fuss and hassle free family friendly hotel with excellent and varied facilities. Thankfully they seem to avoid most of the tack, drama and noise that the tag ""family friendly"" tends to bring with it. A pool, games room, various activity rooms, playground and the wild green yonder may not be enough to discourage even the most hyperactive little dear from getting tucked up early in a big comfy bed with complimentary DVDs and popcorn. Now that I think of it, despite school holidays coming to an end, I didn't spot a single grumpy face or hear a single wailing child. The place seems to be built for good behaviour and smiles.

but, with a small b, to grab that 'excellence' with a small e, I will echo a few points from other recent reviews and maybe suggest a few new ones.

WIFI wifi   w i f i..... Bitbuzz are doing you no service at all, terrible, took me 2 hours around midnight to complete an essential 5 minute booking which crashed out leaving transaction in limbo and could only be rectified by a phonecall in the morning.
Even if it did work, it looks fairly downmarket to have to access wifi through a third party provider when few others do.
HOT tea, hot coffee, an essential in the morning, the breakfast is great, it's silly but lukewarm beverages trample excellent cuisine every time. 
A few dirty cups missed by housekeeping but I'd let that go as a once off oversight.
Not a proper quibble as such, but I'd lose the clipboard from the seating at the Pavillion, unnecessarily officious and not in keeping with the otherwise friendly demeanour of the hotel.
1.2m. That is the depth of the very pleasant warm clean decent size pool. All of it. Bear a thought for those who haven't yet reached such heady heights or forgot their water wings ;)

Apart from the Pavillion lounge, it struck me that an informal cafe/afternoon tea style seating area to cater for those not dining or ""drinking"" would be welcome. There did appear to be something on the mezzanine floor but other than couches with cups/tea bags displayed nearby it didn't appear to be in use. Perhaps I picked my times wrong.

Would I go again, well of course I would, I did already, next time I may forgive the 1.2m Chances are time will prevail. ""Look daddy, I can touch the bottom standing on tippy toes"" will be just a fond memory of a very pleasant stay. Thank you, and especially your staff",5,2015,08,31
238,Vacation,"Spent 9 days in Ireland and stayed at 5 different hotels.  Druids Glenn was fabulous, by far the best of the 5 and they all where spa resorts. DRUIDS Glenn ' s service and staff members are amazing.  They pay close attention to every detail.   The bartender Mark was wonderful and went above and beyond to make the stay memorable. ",5,2015,08,30
238,Very good ,"We enjoyed an excellent midweek 3 night stay here in July. The superior room was a good size for 2 adults and a 2 year old in a cot. Used the swimming pool & kids room everyday which were good although times are restricted for kids in the pool. Breakfast was a good self service buffet. We ate in the bar twice, great service & good food. The hotel has a relaxing atmosphere with loads of space. Will go back again. ",4,2015,08,30
238,5* Family Resort,"Just back from a one-night stay at this fabulous hotel. We travelled with 3 children under 12 and my mother. From the moment we checked-in we were greeted by friendly welcoming staff. Our rooms were more than spacious, tastefully decorated and inviting. Our 3 boys loved the pool, games room, driving range...the list goes on. This really is an ideal 5* family resort.  Food in the 13th bar was delicious, with an excellent childrens menu available.Buffet breakfast the next morning was one of the best we've ever had, home or abroad. The staff could not do enough for us. Our only regret was that we could not stay for another few nights. We will definitely be back.
Minor quibble: My mother is elderly and found the walk from her room to the elevators a bit too far.",5,2015,08,28
238,Top class hotel for families,"We spent 3 nights at this hotel in August 2015.  The whole experience was first class.  From booking through to check out, the team at the hotel have thought of everything.  Whilst the hotel is famous as a golfing resort, it is much more than this.  It is also an ideal venue for non-golfing families and couples seeking a romantic get away.  We travelled with the kids and they had a ball at the Kids High Tea Club.  The staff helped enhance the experience, particularly Connor (one of the concierge) who was helpful and friendly, especially with our kids. The Spa helped entertain my other half and I am told that Emily is worthing seeking out for some treatments.  We do plan to visit the hotel again and would strongly recommend the hotel for golfers, families and couples (there's something for everyone).   Thanks Druids Glen and all your staff for a wonderful stay.",5,2015,08,26
238,Dinner Was Scrumptious.,"Excellent service, brialliant food. The Wicklow lamb was glorious. Highly recommend this place for anyone looking for a quiet, luxurious dining experience. Waiting staff are exceptionally nice and are more than happy to make the effort to ensure your night is special. ",5,2015,08,26
238,First family mini holiday ,Lovely hotel and a brilliant place to take the kids. Staff are great and very helpful throughout our visit. 2 nights was not enough in the area as lots to do. Did not have time to enjoy the wonderful facilities this hotel has to offer however had a few trips to the pool with the kids. Nice warm pool full of families. Kids loved it. Nice room however very dusty evident at night with bedside lamp on. A heavy floating sea of dust above us. Woke up feeling rather groggy in morning. All of us! Beds also bit hard. Otherwise brilliant. Breakfast has good choice. No comfy relaxing bar area however foyer has loads of comfy seating areas and couple of open fires to compensate. Despite minor issues will definitely return again to this hotel. ,4,2015,08,26
238,A truly wonderful break,"I recently stayed in Druids Glen Resort for a family celebration, we were a large group of varying ages from 10 weeks to 78 years and to say it ticked all the boxes is an understatement. The service was excellent, the food was great, very child friendly and the staff were incredibly attentive! I would highly recommend this hotel, the golf was fantastic, the bikes were a hit with the kids as was the games room which means a great time for mum and dad too!
",5,2015,08,25
238,Always perfect,"Not one bad word to say about this hotel. Most comfortable beds ever, amazing food in the restaurant & the staff always go above and beyond. Would recommend to anybody looking for a countryside retreat that's still close enough to Dublin with a car.",5,2015,08,25
238,felt more of 4 star experience but excellent,"We have just returned from a one night stay in this resort.  Myself my husband and 2 children. On arrival we were greet with friendly staff and lovely hot towels which the kids thought great..it was a lovely touch. One arrival in the hotel I thought it was very clean and had the ow factor. On arrival in the room we were slightly underwhelmed.  We stayed in room 342 and there was visible stain on carpet and also 3 cobwebs in three separate locations. Cleaners need to an more attention to detail..top of pictures etc. We went to the pool which was nice but not very child friendly. There was no separate kids pool so I had to carry my 3 year old as he wasn't tall enough to stand. We dined in the casual dining restaurant..we had a lengthy enough wait despite being advised we didn't have to book. The druids den for kids needed a lot of TLC ,  kids only wanted to stay 10 minutes.  The benefit of the kids dvds  was a great touch and they got a wee packet of popcorn so they were thrilled. BREAKFAST WAS AMAZING!  close to the best myself or hubby have experienced. The waiter/manager from Kilkenny is a great asset to the restaurant and hotel. Friendly and very professional. When at the pool Monday morning I had only got into jacuzzi 2 minutes and was told they needed to service it. I did think at 9 am this was not the best time to close it. Overall we did enjoy ourselves..I feel it's a good 4 star hotel as opposed to 5 star. But definetly will return. ",4,2015,08,24
238,"Amazing hotel, wonderful staff, brilliant facilities","We recently planned a girls trip away for a special birthday and chose Druids Glen as our hotel for the night. Well they say its the little things that mean a lot and we would just like to say that this hotel knows how to do the little special things that make a hotel just stand out as a place that really care about the guests experience. So from the three of us that went and stayed we would like to list all the little things that meant a lot....

Having our car parked by the friendly doorman because it was lashing rain
The warm hand towels at the reception check in
The lovely reception staff who got us into our room on an earlier check in
The amazing bar food lunch and again the engaging friendly staff
The spacious room and bright beautiful view of the mountains
The leisure centre was spotless comfortable and the staff were so nice again
Joanne on reception for being so nice and sending us up constant supplies of tes bags to the room
The room service food was to die for, steak amazing tender and the sides YUM
Lastly we never wanted to leave the breakfast buffet and that beautiful bright white dining area. The choice was brilliant, they make you your own omelettes or pancakes and there is even gluten free section
AGAIN the lovely staff because of our five requests for more tea

All in all wonderful hotel that go above and beyond the call of duty, with the nicest feel to it you could imagine ! Go visit and go visit soon",5,2015,08,24
238,Nice secluded place for a peaceful time,"Like any other trip of mine, went there with missus to get away from the daily clock-work like life. And I am glad I chose this place to stay. Room was spacious and we ordered room-service while we were there, which was great too. Definitely a place to stay if you don't want to spend too much time travelling from Dublin and still be away from the city life.",5,2015,08,24
238,Wicklow wedding,"Went here for a wedding. We stayed for 3 nights in a double room which was very spacious. Hotel was very nice, service fantastic and quite reasonably priced for drinks at the bar. Very good if you wanted to go away for a spa or golf holiday. Nothing was to much trouble for the staff either. It is about 40 minutes outside of Dublin.",5,2015,08,23
238,5 night stay with 2 adults 2 children,Had a lovely family break. Lovely hotel with lovely staff. Kids loved it. Special mention to Teague the concierge. A real gentleman. Barry was very helpful and friendly at reception! Ate in hugos twice and the bar the other three nights. One of the waitresses in the bar restaurant was particularly pleasant and polite. Very helpful. Not sure of her name but she had long red hair. Very professional. One of the managers from Kilkenny was also very attentive and professional. Really kept an eye on things. Food was great at both breakfasts in Hugos and in the bar. Definately highly recommend and already planning our next break to Druids Glen. ,5,2015,08,23
238,Excellent - a favourite place to stay,"We came here because friends recommended it - the first time we took our kids, the second time it was just the two of us.  We love it.  Great service, great setting, lots of amenities... Neither of us plays golf - our son does - but it doesn't matter. If you're golfers you'll think you're in paradise.

We use it to relax, gym and swim, take treatments, and sit in the foyer reading on the luxurious sofas.

Families love this place - so if kids annoy you, then you might think again.  We've raised two, and we rather like watching families with youngsters. And there are times in the pool which are child-free.  Go then.

Like with any business - stuff sometimes goes wrong - but here they fix it at once.  All the staff are chatty and friendly, even the busy maids. 

If I have one complaint - it's the Bitbuzz wifi.  Poor - woefully slow to log on and wants to log on again frequently. A hotel this classy should sort it out - for it lets the overall impression down.  I stayed at a 2-3 star hotel later in the summer where the wifi beat it hands down.

People want it, and expect it.  Fix it.

That aside - great hotel, would recommend it to anyone.",5,2015,08,21
238,Great Hotel but !!!!,"We spent three nights at this hotel in a superior king room. From check in to checkout the staff were excellent. The room was large and spotlessly clean. The food was very good. The main drawback as others have said, that going to breakfast and dinner in the bar was like going into a creche. If you are going as a couple there is no quiet ambience here even in the lounge area,however that may change when the holidays are over and if so we would definitely return as it is a lovely hotel in a scenic part of Ireland. ",4,2015,08,20
238,Wedding,"We had our wedding at Druids Glen on the 23rd July 2015. 

First of all, the wedding co-ordinator Nessa Kearney was absolutely amazing from start to finish! Nothing was ever any trouble to her and when asking general questions about the hotel and what would happen on the day etc, she would reply very promptly with in depth details of everything we needed to know and more! - she was amazing and is a real credit to Druids Glen! 

Secondly, the hotel staff couldn't have been more helpful! We had roughly 50 English guests staying and around 20 Irish guests and since the wedding all they have done is sing the praises of the hotel and its staff! Many of them have said it's the best hotel they have ever stayed in and we would agree!

The food was absolutely outstanding and the chef was brilliant! We had a tasting before the wedding and the chef came out to speak to us to see if we wanted anything on the menu tweaked to suit us but everything was perfect! - it was all about making everything right for us and the chef couldn't have been more helpful! He should be praised for his good work because the meal was perfect and definitely one of the best meals we've had even though he was cooking for 150 people!

The stay was so important to us and we have absolutely no regrets! It was absolutely perfect! 

We would recommend this hotel to anyone both as a wedding reception or for a leisurely stay! It really is top notch and we can't wait to go back!

Also, if anyone is looking to have their wedding at Druids Glen and is looking for a band, 'The Dionnes' had everyone up dancing all night! They are literally the perfect wedding band! - expensive but well worth the money!!

238,Fabulous Hotel,"Just back from one nights stay, we went up for my husbands 50th birthday with our two children.  Everything about this hotel is lovely from the moment we arrived, the grounds, hot cloths, colouring pack for kids, its a very child friendly hotel, they were taken off to play golf with a golf pro (free of charge) for an hour.  Lovely games room, playground and pool was great. Breakfast was outstanding huge variety to choose from. This hotel has the extra touches overall great experience and look forward to going again!",5,2015,08,20
238,Overnight stay at druids Glen ,"Must compliment the efficient staff who were pleasant yet keeping their distance. Attended a wedding here.  Lovely venue.  Just one thing if attending a function here the dance floor Isnt level with the surrounding area be careful!  We spotted the surface was quite wet when someone went dancING there after drink had bn spilled ;-) 
Food is first class.  Enjoyed the stay. ",4,2015,08,18
238,Lovely stay,"Stayed here for one night to attend a wedding reception. The location is only 30 minutes outside Dublin so very handy and the drive up is gorgeous. Welcome was very nice and friendly and check in was quick and efficient - the warm towels handed to you on arrival are a lovely touch. My room itself was very comfortable and had a nice view out over the gardens. Bathroom was lovely and shower very powerful. It was a ""double double"" room which personally I am not fond of when you are staying solo and I would have preferred a king bed. I was in room 101 which I would avoid if like me you have a late night ahead of you as it is located beside the kids indoor playground. Great if you have kids but not if don't you want to be woken up early the next morning with kids right outside your door demanding to go and play! 

The food at the wedding reception was absolutely delicious and the waiting staff were brilliant all night, there is clearly a high level of training here that shines through. Bar staff at the drinks reception were also very good and the ice cream cart went down a treat!

Check out the next day was equally quick and I loved how you are given bottles of water for your journey. I also managed to lose my jacket somewhere between checking out and my car which I only realised when I returned to Dublin. The front desk were great when I rang and found it quickly for me and kept it safe until I returned to the hotel to collect it. All in all I was very impressed and will definitely be back for another night as I really want to try out the spa and unfortunately didn't have time on this trip.

238,Nice Hotel and surrounds,"We spent 3 nights at Druids Glen Golf Resort after 3 weeks of playing golf around Ireland. It was a relaxing break to have a massage at the Spa to relieve tired muscles. The accommodation was amazing and the rest of the Resort would have been amazing except for the large amount of young families. At breakfast, families were everywhere which doesn't make for a very peaceful morning and then to find that in the evening there was hardly a spot to have dinner due to the number of families with young children again took the shine out of it. We are not against families staying but there should definitely be a limit to how many, or a separate more relaxed dining area for them? I couldn't fault the restaurant and we enjoyed a delicious meal.",4,2015,08,17
238,Great Hotel ruined by too many young families ,"Stayed here for 3 nights with the intention of enjoying Wicklow and relaxing. 
The hotel and staff are excellent however our visit was not relaxing, due to the large number of young families. 
The breakfast room and bar in the evening was noisy with kids running around.  The swimming pool was given over to families most of the day, it is Adult only between 12 & 3 and after 7 in the evening. 
The hotel seems to be marketing itself for family breaks, however this then makes it unsuitable for proper adult 5 star breaks. 
Would have rated it 5, if there had been an area free from young children for adults to relax. ",3,2015,08,16
238,"Gorgeous setting, great food","We stay at Druid's Glen for one night a few weeks before our wedding - just to get away and relax before things got hectic. The hotel was really lovely, our room was spacious and luxurious. I used the pool which was nice and bright (though a little crowded with kids!). We had dinner in the restaurant and the food was exceptional - really exceeded our expectations especially since there was a wedding on the same day. The grounds were gorgeous as well. Even though there was a wedding, as mentioned, the hotel was quiet all evening and we didn't notice a thing. On check out we received a bottle of water for the drive which was a nice touch. Would definitely return for a longer weekend visit.",5,2015,08,16
238,Excellent break away to relax!,"Me and my husband spent a beautiful weekend at Druids Glen for our Silver Wedding Anniversary. The rooms are so nice and specious. We also had treatments at the spa which were very relaxing and the staff were very helpful and payed attention to detail. Both the breakfast and dinner were absolutely delicious served in the beautiful elegant restaurant. Couldn't have celebrated our special day in a better hotel, definitely going back. ",5,2015,08,14
238,Perfect break away,"Excellent from start to finish, staff were so friendly and the food was lovely. Particularly enjoyed the breakfast. The rooms are fantastic!
We both went to the spa for treatments and it was so nice. The only thing I could fault is the pool area (at a push!) It was quite busy when we went, mostly with children. However, it was one of the nicest weekends away, will be back for another visit!",4,2015,08,13
238,A good 4* experience ,"Although we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Druids Glen,  we both felt that the hotel was firmly a 4*,  rather than a 5*,  experience.  Hotel rooms were beautiful,  reception staff friendly and there was a very informal,  relaxed atmosphere across the entire site. However,  we felt that the hotel lacked that 'little something' that makes a hotel 5*.  Service is extremely slow and although food in the bar area was good and reasonably priced,  we waited for a long time to place an order.  We also tried the jogging routes at the resort,  the route itself is lovely but doesn't loop,  one has to double back to reach the hotel. 

The spa area is nice and very family friendly. The secure outdoor play area was also great for children.  We felt more a family getaway than a romantic break. ",4,2015,08,13
238,First visit - outstanding,"We stayed last weekend for a wedding reception on the Saturday. We had a 'double double' room for 3 nights, which was huge and very comfortable with plenty of hanging space and a couple of easy chairs.This was one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in. We didn't use the Spa or the Golf club, but everything else was excellent, and the staff couldn't have been more helpful. A great deal of thought had gone into what should be provided in a bedroom, robes, slippers, iron and ironing board, safe, fridge,etc.
The breakfast was excellent, as was the food for the wedding reception.
Our only slight criticism was that the directions to the railway station in Greystones and Johnny Fox's pub were out of date, though the staff promised to update them immediately.
Overall, an excellent experience.",5,2015,08,12
238,Outstanding from start to finish,"My wife, 14 year old daughter and myself have just spent 2 nights at Druids Glen.  A totally outstanding experience.  

We had a lovely room with 2 Queen Beds on the 2nd floor overlooking the 13th tee of Druids Glen golf course.  

Breakfast amazing, I have never seen a selection as large, varied or well presented.  A chef was also available to cook omelettes, pancakes etc. to order.  We ate dinner in the hotel on the 2nd night.  We had food from the bar menu and it was very nice and reasonably priced.  Bar area was very busy but wait for food was not bad.  Bar drinks not too expensive unless you start going for some high end brandies or whiskers.

All staff amazing and nothing was too much trouble.  Adrienne on reception took the time to explain everything clearly on arrival and was very helpful with other little questions  we asked.  The young gentleman Connor the concierge was extremely helpful.  Both are a credit to the hotel.  

I played both golf courses on my visit and both are outstanding, with Druids Glen being the slightly better course.  However, Druids Heath is a great course in its own right.  

I had played golf at Druids Glen before but had never stayed.   All 3 of us loved it.  It is a certainty that after the fantastic experience of this 2 night stay we will return to stay again and hopefully it won't be long until we do.",5,2015,08,12
238,"Excellent hotel, one small (or maybe not small issue)","We stayed in Druids Glen Resort with our two children (2 and 5) at the end of May and we are certainly glad we did.  

On arrival we were greeted by Barry at reception, he was extremely friendly, very helpful and great with the kids.  He provided us with little kids packs and gave us the run down on the resort, great start to our little trip!

The hotel itself is fantastic and the rooms are very spacious, even with two little ones. The little dressing gowns for the kids were a nice touch, made them feel right at home!

The hotel seems very family orientated, which we have found is rare for 4 and 5* hotels.  There is a games room which the kids loved, there was plenty in it for all ages (even me) and an excellent play park outside, they really go all out for the kids.

The only let down was with the food in the bar. We ate there both nights of our stay as it was more suitable for the kids.  The menu wasn't bad, the food and service wasn't great though.  First night I had asked for the burger without the Mayo, (can't have the stuff), of course it came with mayo, they took it back and did me another one (by this time my wife and kids were nearly finished).  Whilst they gave me a fresh burger, they reheated the chips so they were like rocks, wasn't great, and the other meals were fairly mediocre also.  The kids goujons were very over cooked and not at all enjoyable and my wife's fish very stodgy, very disappointing.

The second night we had steaks, they were very tough, we did comment but nothing really they could do at that stage.  My son asked for the spaghetti with tomato and basil sauce, this was presented to him with no sauce, very random?  Obviously that was sent back and we all had to wait, again.

 The service was very slow and the overall standard of food very disappointing for such a nice hotel with such friendly helpful staff.

We have given 4 stars because the hotel was really very nice and I would definitely recommend it for families, we will stay again but really do hope there is some improvement with the bar food.",4,2015,08,10
238,LOVELY UNDERSTATED ELEGANCE.,"Just back from a lovely 2 day stay with husband and kids ages 9-18. Everyone loved it.
The staff were friendly and helpful, not at all distant like a lot of hotels. The breakfast was to die for and they served it till 11. This meant we could catch the pool before breakfast and be ready for the sumptuous spread. Of course you have the added advantage of being in the GARDEN OF IRELAND, the lovely Wicklow where the sun always shines; well nearly always!!!",5,2015,08,10
238,Good 4* experience,"Stayed with small kids for a few nights.
The good stuff - outdoor play area good. Breakfast amazing! Staff helpful. Room nice and clean. Pool lovely. 
The niggles - the BBQ doesn't work. Sorry. It's too busy. We had to sit in an overflow area so had no waiter, had to chase for cutlery as it had run out. And no drink orders. Got one order in 2 hours after chasing at the bar.  Waiter agreed they were understaffed.
Please sort out your BBQ nights. The bar is too small and can't cope.
  The BBQ area is too small.  Oh and the cook serving doesn't interact well with Us customers, they are too busy.

The indoor play area - kids are meant to be supervised. They arent.  Parents dump their kids in there and go to the bar/Lobby.  As a result the retro game machine is damaged. The table football was wrecked. The air hockey scores not working. Either supervise it or close it in the evenings. Not your fault. Just kids and feckless parents.

So over all- 4 star for the breakfast and staff. Evening meals average to be honest. 
Points off for the fact you struggle to get a pint in the evenings or a table.

I note some folk rave about it. I did notice some get bumped up, managers rush out to fawn over, get reserved parking. I assume they are high rollers etc, so possible they get preferential treatment?

I'd definitely go back, if only for the lovely pool.
Just avoid weekends/conference events when it's swamped.

238,"Fabulous stay, staff were wonderful, will come again.","We came here for a wedding and the hotel was just fab. The room was spacious and beautifully decorated. The reception staff noticed we had a baby, even though we hadn't mentioned this either at booking or at check in and very thoughtfully sent up housekeeping with a cot without us requesting one. The staff were friendly without being overbearing. The food was second to none and I would thoroughly recommend a stay here. We will definitely come back.",5,2015,08,09
238,Nice Grounds,YES  grounds lovely.. so beautiful.. golf course amazing. staff friendly. Some of the lodges / houses down the back need attention. The weather was not great so spoilt the walks etc I intended to go on.  ,5,2015,08,09
238,5 star for sure .. just 1 wee niggle,"Just back from 2 nights in Druids Glen with my wife and 14 yr old daughter. Thoroughly enjoyed it , the staff were friendly yet not overbearing , the service and food was excellent and the room was v. good. Went for a superior room overlooking golf course with a small balcony. I played golf on druids glen course on the first day which was exceptional ( beautiful weather helped!) whilst my wife went for a facial and then went for a bike ride around the resort with our daughter . Bikes are supplied  free for residents!
As I mentioned at the start we had just one wee niggle , we were in the lounge area on the first night listening to the live music ( a guy with a guitar who was excellent), unfortunately we were asked by a very nice manager to leave the bar area at 10pm because children were not allowed . This meant that we had to sit in lobby whilst everyone else was in the bar . I have to say there were no unruly children and any kids that were there had more or less drifted off to bed . I do understand that the hotel is bound by legalities but I definately thought that dicretion should be used on these occassions , yes , if there were lots of kids I do understand running about but there wasn't , when you add to the fact that our 14yr old was just sitting with us on her tablet listening to the music, we were disappointed . I have stayed in a number of similar hotels in Ireland which did show discretion and would probably favour them . That said I would definately return but as a couple and would recommend it as a couples destination",5,2015,08,08
238,Looking forward to our next trip!!!,"We booked this hotel for a two night family stay to break out journey between Berkshire and Cork. Our only regret was that we did not book 4 nights!!! The hotel is both family, couple and golfer friendly - we were delighted with the stay and will definitely be back. The pool/spa had sensible hours for kids/non kids and the indoor playroom was excellent also - important given Irelands wet summer! The rooms were above the usual 4/5 star standard and nicely spacious... The food was fantastic ... breakfast was excellent and we used the bar for both lunch and evening meals and its best suites for children..... Finally, the staff were all OUTSTANDING ... from the lady who checked us in, right through to the lady who checked us out. We will be back!!",5,2015,08,07
238,Exceeding all expectations!,"My husband and I stayed in the Druids Glen on Friday last to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary and I'm writing to say thank you for your hospitality. Having worked in a 5 star hotel myself I had high expectations towards your hotel and I have to say that we were blown away, could not fault a thing. 

We were upgraded to a suite from a superior king room, which was a great surprise, then we received chocolates, a bottle of wine and a complementary glass of prosecco (thanks Ken!) with our dinner. The management and staff were so attentive and nice, genuine-nice, the room was beautiful and luxurious, the breakfast was just unbelievable. Enjoyed the dinner so much (BBQ on the decking) with John's music and singing. 

As I said we were celebrating our anniversary which is a special occasion for us but we were also made feel so special by everyone in your hotel and for that I thank you so much.

We'll definitely return with the kids too in the near future.",5,2015,08,07
238,Outstanding hotel,"I stayed in this hotel on two occasions and could not find one fault about either stay. 
The staff was always extremely helpful and friendly and really went out of the way to make the stay extra special. 
Even got a card and chocolates as it was my birthday. 
Spa was also a great experience. 
Overall very relaxing, and the rooms are absolutely fabulous. 
An absolute steal.",5,2015,08,07
238,Family trip away,lovely hotel. Comfortable and welcoming. Sometimes 5* can be too much but this was not the case. Swimming pool and set up for the kids was first class. Disappointed with the service at diner. Waited for an hour for our meal before leaving. Too long. Made a complaint about this. Must say that it was handled first class by the manager on duty. Felt that we were listened to and things got resolved quickly. Went to bray the following evening and found a restaurant which was fab.,4,2015,08,06
238,Delicious lunch,"Went for lunch recently and we were really impressed. Sat In the lovely conservatory area where they had a lovely fire lit. While it was summer it was lashing rain and cold out so it was a nice touch. 
I had the kilkee crab and smoked salmon which was really delicious. Would go back for this alone. Hubby had the lamb which he said was also delicious. 
Service was great. Would highly recommend. We were both only sorry we weren't staying. ",5,2015,08,06
238,"Really child friendly, great experience.","We had a fantastic weekend getaway recently in Druid's Glen (my wife and I and our two small children). We would normally approach these breaks with some trepidation over the welcome you might receive with young kids in tow - sometimes 'family friendly' really means 'we can just about tolerate kids'. This wasn't the case in Druid's Glen. They really excelled at making all of our family feel welcome. The facilities and the overall customer service were excellent; we had breakfast both mornings, lunch in the 13th Bar, and dinner in Hugo's one evening. Service throughout was attentive and thoughtful. The family changing areas in the pool were great also; and also small things like the DVD collection available at reception each evening for the kids. While being very welcoming to the kids, at the same time the hotel didn't feel like a holiday camp over-run with screaming kids - my wife and I could absolutely have stayed on our own and still enjoy the experience. Overall, it was fantastic value-for-money, and we will definitely visit again.",5,2015,08,04
238,Not quite 5 star,"This is a lovely hotel but not 5 star. A very good 4 star but lacking the little touches of a 5 star experience. The hotel is modern but not plush by any means. The door to our room was scratched and marked and there were stains on one of the footstools , the bathroom was very standard but the room in general was fine but as I said 4 star rating. Nobody showed us to our room and our luggage didn't arrive until an hour later. Food in the dining room was lovely and of a v high standard but I had 2 major issues with my inclusive dinner. 1.the sides were for 2 people or you both had mash or both had chips etc when I said we didn't want to eat the same thing the waiter had some difficulty and eventually came up with a 1/2 and 1/2 solution. OMG THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE A 5 • dining experience. Also it was a basic 3 course meal - not even a cup of tea included at the end - this is ireland - tea is mandatory. Food was lovely but those little niggardly cost cutting  devices just made me cross. I spent the next night in the Heritage in Killenard - different experience much more luxurious and all those 5 star touches that you would expect. Wake up druids glen and smarten up!! The competition is stiff",3,2015,08,03
238,Weekend away from a City ,"I found this one quite pleasant. It's a weeding venue so it's mostly very lively a little bit to big for me. Hotel has a lovely tea room and very good restaurant ""Pavilion"". Room service wasn't great a specially when it comes to order
breakfast to your room, it's arrived cold and after few phone calls. When we leave a hotel our bill was overestimated what was fix quickly. ",3,2015,08,03
238,Not true five star.,"First impression was poor. All on front desk were training staff. We had to wait for check in because the rooms were still being cleaned at 15:45. We went for something to eat as there was a queue forming. I had the sea food chowder, it wasn't very hot. The bar area was also cold, I had to go back to my car for my jumper. They booked us into an interconnecting room which was OK until we heard people next door talking they may aswell have been in the room with us. We complained but they were reluctant to move us. We asked to speak to the manager we had to tell him we were going to leave before he agreed to move us. We had dinner in Hugo's restaurant that night. The food was satisfactory but well over priced. Went for drinks in the bar. No atmosphere, the decor was bland there was nothing welcoming or cosy about this hotel. It really lacked the luxury you would expect in a five star hotel. We visited a real five star hotel the next day and we experienced  true luxury we would expect from a five star. Powerscourt was very impressive. Druids Glen have a lot to do to compete with this hotel. Not sure would I return in the future.",3,2015,08,02
238,Just fabulous in every way!,"It is situated in the beautiful county of Wicklow. There are lots to do around the area, it is great for romantic getaways, business meetings but most of all for me it is fabulous for families.We have stayed here on numerous occasions and loved every stay. The staff cannot do any more for you, the children have so much to do at this hotel that it is like a holiday resort. The food is amazing and the breakfast has so much assortment it is wonderful. I have stayed in 5 star hotels all around the world and this is in my top 3 because nothing is too much to ask, love this place.",5,2015,08,01
238,"Beautiful relaxing location, but still within reach of restaurants pubs, actitives etc","Really nice place to stay. We stayed in the Trident Holiday Homes on site. 3 double bedroom, beautiful views, excellent location to tour Dublin and Wicklow, hotel on site with free pass to leisure centre, excellent pool. Really enjoyed our stay. ",5,2015,07,29
238,Ticked all the boxes for me,"My wife and I stayed here for 1 night on 25 July 2015.  I would rate this as one of the best hotels we have stayed in. The whole hotel was air conditioned so no stuffy corridors. The room was well appointed with a sensible bathroom in which everything was functional without any unnecessary frills. Lighting was excellent and in the right places for mirrors. Lots of high quality soap and gels.  Separate shower and a large bath. Bed was very comfortable and the TV received a good range of channels. Surprisingly the TV had the Northern Ireland version of BBC one.  Other hotels in which we have stayed in the Republic of Ireland have shown the London version which seems a bit odd. The room had a fridge as well as tea/coffee making facilities.

We had dinner in Hugo's restaurant. The waiter was excellent and knew all about the food and wine. The wine list was comprehensive without being overpriced. The food was exceptionally good. We had sirloin steaks which almost melted in the mouth. The breakfast was comprehensive with freshly squeezed Orange juice and fresh fruit. Eggs cooked as you watched. 

Staff were so welcoming and helpful.  

The only downside was finding the hotel from the N11. Without a sat nav I would have got lost.",5,2015,07,29
238,Outstanding 3 Night Summer Break,"We stayed here for 3 nights with the family package in July having visited Druids Glen at the same time last year. This is a genuinely family friendly resort that provides for kids and adults = all happy. Bedroom, restaurant, facilities all top notch and our kids loved the kids club with high tea from 5 to 9 pm (Note to Parents - Yes - thats 4 hours of uninterrupted Adult time!). What really stood out for me having stayed at numerous hotels was the standard of professional service - helpful and efficient staff throughout the Hotel and having stayed recently in several 4* Hotels the step up in Druids Glen in that respect was very noticeable. This does not happen by magic, but of course by good management - and in that respects Druids Glen is to be highly commended. We will definitely be back.",5,2015,07,27
238,Sons wedding,"My son had his wedding at the Druids Glen. My wife and our family stayed at the hotel for five nights . The staff were exceptional and very professional, the hotel accommodation was exceptional . The wedding went without any problems and was well organised from start to finish. Special thanks to the wedding organiser. We will defiantly stay at this resort again",5,2015,07,26
238,One of the top hotels I've visited ,"Stayed here in July 2015 for a family break. Four days of pure relaxation supported by great staff and a pure relaxed atmosphere. Highly trained staff who really know how to treat guests right from arrival in the lobby until checkout. 
I would highly recommend sending the kids to the gold lessons with the resident pro (Patrick). He had our 2 kids for two clinics and is an extremely patient and encouraging coach. 
Well done next trip to Dublin area we will make Druids Glen our base camp. Lots to see in the area also. ",5,2015,07,26
238,Simply the best,"This is simply my favourite hotel in the world bar none. Have eaten here, stayed here, drank here and got married here. There is no fault I can find. Food is always sensational, the bar is the best hotel bar I've ever been in, the rooms are big, spacious, clean and the beds are incredibly comfortable. The staff are brilliant, helpful, personable and supremely professional. And our wedding was everything we hoped it would be, the hotel could not do enough for us, everything we asked for was done without the slightest hesitation. Nessa Kearney the wedding co-ordinator is excellent at her job and one of the nicest people we have ever met in our life. We will continue to go back to this hotel over and over again. We have booked two nights in August and I cannot wait. For me this hotel is simply the best, at home or abroad. ",5,2015,07,20
238,Out of this world,"Have been meaning to post a review about this fabulous place since I came home, we stayed here about 3 weeks ago my husband, my daughter and myself. We stayed for 4 nights and from start to finish our experience was faultless. By far the best hotel l have ever stayed in! l can,t praise it enough, the food was faboulous, our room was perfect, so clean and spacious and with a large bathroom. There was lots for kids to do and l was very impressed with the large playroom the druids den and also big play area out the back.The pool was fab so clean and lovely big changing room and showers. Also every night there was a big stand put out in front of reception with a great selection of dvds on offer which a lot of people availed of. Lastly l would like to give a mention to the staff who were fantastic from check in to check out and the whole way through, thank you so much you are all a credit to the hotel! We will def be back!!",5,2015,07,18
238,Spa and lunch,"I was treated by my children to the Day Spa Dream which consists of three treatments and lunch in the 13th bar.
From the moment I walked into the Spa reception I was greeted warmly and politely by Michelle. She explained that after I changed into the soft comfy robe and slippers provided I was to wait in the relaxation area and my therapist Amy would be with me shortly. 
I would highly recommend Amy especially for massage, and will definitely be returning soon.   
When my treatments finished, I went back to the relaxation room where Amy gave my a glass of water and a bowl of sorbet. 
My family met me and we went for lunch. I chose the crab & Salmon. It was delicious. I can't praise the Druids Glen staff enough, from Michelle, Amy and all the staff in the bar, each one of them are courteous, polite, friendly and smiling, and every inch of the hotel is spotless. 
Will definitely be returning.

If you are interested in golf this is the place for you. The have an very good spa and pool facility also.",5,2015,07,17
238,Highly recommend,"We had a great experience from the moment we entered the hotel , reception were attentive and friendly , our room was to do die for , spacious and very relaxing! We didn't dine in the restaurant but ate in the bar lounge , food may have been a bit slow arriving but was worth the wait , absolutely gorgeous and our waitress Sophie was fab and funny she made us feel so welcome , would highly recommend this resort and their great staff!!",5,2015,07,17
238,Lovely weekend away!,"Had a lovely weekend away here, the staff were excellent and the food and service was great for our whole stay. We had a meal included in our package and it was incredible. The only thing I was a little disappointed with was the spa it was still good but don't think the experience is 5 star. ",4,2015,07,16
238,Perfect,"We had a wonderful stay at this lovely hotel - I couldn't recommend it highly enough. From the moment we checked in the staff without exception were incredibly friendly, helpful and so polite. Our room was first class - large, bright and so comfortable. The bed was excellent and two squishy armchairs to relax in as well. Ironing board, fridge, hairdryer and just about everything you could need was supplied. The bathroom was huge with large bath and separate shower. We strolled around the grounds one evening - a gorgeous walk and relaxed most nights on one of the comfy sofas in the reception area. Lovely pool area, great kids playroom with X-Box and plenty of other stuff and a kids club in the evening (we didn't use it but heard great reviews). Our son very much appreciated the DVD library in reception and came away with several movies to watch before bed. Breakfast was excellent - loved the fresh honeycomb - a great touch and we had the BBQ one evening which was also good. All in all a wonderful stay, we loved every second of it here and would most definitely go back.",5,2015,07,16
238,Great! Will stay again,"I had a really nice stay at Druids Glen the hotel is lovely to look at and as well the staff were so friendly. There is a man to welcome you at the door who is so nice. Not really anything around the hotel so we ate in the bar both nights we were there but the food is so delicious that we were so happy to eat there both nights. The staff couldnt help us enough, very accomodatiting to my family. There was a lovely blonde girl rebecca that made sure that were taken care of all weekend she gave the kids colouring books and heated up the baby' dinner, nothing was too much trouble. 
The pool and spa facilities are really really great too, myself and my husband loved it! Great spot for romantic weekend id say. Highly recommend this place.",5,2015,07,16
238,Fabulous relaxing stay,"Myself and my husband recently stayed for one night in the Druids Glen.  We have stayed here on a number of occasions in the past and were very much looking forward to our stay.  Email communication with the hotel in advance of our stay was excellent and very prompt.

We arrived very early, around 1pm, but we were delighted to be told that our room was already ready.  Check-in was extremely prompt and the lady was very helpful.  We were given hot towels to freshen our hands which was a lovely touch.  We were given an upgrade to a King Superior guestroom which had a small balcony and we were really grateful for this.  The room was very spacious, with a lovely little seating area.  Complimentary water as well as tea, coffee and walker's shortbread biscuits were very much welcomed.  The bathroom was spacious with a separate bath and lovely L'occtaine products.  A turndown service was provided while we were at dinner which was nice and included a chocolate on our pillow!  We also arrived back to a complimentary box of Butler's chocolates and a personalised letter welcoming us back to the hotel for our special occasion.  It is little touches like these that really do make the difference during a short stay.

We had afternoon tea with prosecco when we arrived and it was delicious.  JD looked after us very well ensuring that there were plenty of vegetarian options available. Service was excellent with our tea and coffee being topped up regularly.  We had dinner in the bar later on in the night and again it was very nice with very good service.  Breakfast the next morning was excellent.  We were promptly seated and served toast and coffee.  There is a wide variety of options available including cereals, fresh fruits, meat and cheese, yogurt, hot breakfasts, pancakes and pastries.  Impressively, there is a separate selection of gluten free products available.

The pool area is great to relax in and also has a Jacuzzi, steam room, sauna and plunge pool.  There were a lot of children there at the time we visited it, but it didn't impact us one bit.  If this is something that might bother you, there are specific times that children are allowed to use the pool.

Like check-in, check out was prompt and friendly.  We were given two bottles of complimentary water for our journey which was a lovely touch.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and all the extra little touches were an added bonus.  We are already looking forward to returning very soon!",5,2015,07,15
238,Disappointed !,"Stayed here for three nights over weekend and Monday, was really looking forward as advertised as 5 star resort, however there is no way I could call this hotel/resort 5 star having stayed in many 5 star before, check in time is advertised for 4pm, we arrived shortly after 4 and our room was not ready, reception kept ringing I presume house keeping and they said 5 mins or so each time, I would say had to wait a good 45 mins to get to room, this was a problem as had arranged to play golf in Wicklow and would miss tee time, when returned to room later was a complementary bottle of wine and an apology which was a nice touch, however would have preferred check in on time, the room was nice and large however a few things which would not expect for 5 star, fridge was a disaster, it was plugged in and on but not cooling, our main lamp did not work, we never used the restaurant but did eat in the bar area, we ordered a starter and it was served very quickly, however we then had to wait easy 1 hour for main course, this is just not good, I watched other people coming in and getting their food before us so ne excuse for that, the staff did keep telling us would be a few mins but a few minutes just kept coming and going and no food ! I have to say overall the staff were very good and friendly, wouldn't put the problems down to them, we used the pool and were told had to wear a cap, 3 euro each didn't really see that coming, yes not a lot of money but not a good touch, on check out when given the bill we were charged for 3 rounds of golf at the Glen when only myself and Nephew had played it, only us two in room so not sure how they came up with that one, again don't really expect this in a 5 star resort, wasn't really much of an apology for this however the girl on reception was training I think, overall not what I had expected and really looked forward to, I would definitely play the Glen course again as the course is excellent however think would maybe choose to stay elsewhere.",3,2015,07,15
238,Excellent,"As soon as we arrived we were meet with such a friendly welcome. The staff were lovely, I couldn't praise them enough. After a long drive from Galway with two young children it was like a breath of fresh air. We had just come from a hotel in Galway and Druids Glen was such a different experience. The room was fab, so spacious with a lovely view over the golf course. Everything about the stay was first class, from the food to the facilities, especially the outside and inside play area for the children. I couldn't recommend it enough.",5,2015,07,14
238,Disappointing,"Stayed her for two nights for a special occasion. On check in felt the receptionist was not informative as to breakfast times, where lift was etc. When we got up to our room I was disappointed we had two double beds...not the luxurious room I was expected for our romantic getaway. We ate in the bar that evening and to say service is atrocious would be an understatement. The waiters do not seem to be assigned an area as such and service is all over the place as a result. On both nights the two tables next to us complained regarding the slow service. Menu is quiet limited. The food was very disappointing, lacks flavour and presentation. I did see what appeared to be a manager walking around the bar on both evenings but he seemed oblivious to what was going on with the service. The bar staff member did apologise and gave us a discount on our meal. Breakfast service was very slow, my partner had breakfast form the buffet ate by the time we got our tea/coffee. I ordered poached eggs and again a very slow wait. The milk in our jug on the table was sour also, however was replaced but a new cup wasn't brought (I had tea poured and the milk in it when I seen the sour milk floating on top). We had a turn down service on the first night but not on the second night. Certainly would not return for the price we paid I had expected a lot more.",3,2015,07,13
238,Impressive,"Druids Glen is a great resort type Hotel,next to Golf coarse,great meals and over all pleasant play to stay,it is a short drive into Dublin,and has many other features.The staff were all very good to deal with.",5,2015,07,09
238,Luxurious,Luxurious hotel with an excellent breakfast and exceptional staff . Rooms very clean tidy and spacious . Only fault we had was its quite a distance out from the city and not much else but golf which we were not interested in and the roads to it are to be driven with care as they are country roads .All said this is an exceptional weekend away treat though we didn't try the restaurant the bar was a little expensive but the service was excellent Two teenage granddaughters that stayed with us would find it difficult to amuse themselves so it was a journey away every day of our four day stay We would stay again but maybe just for a night as playing golf does nothing for me,4,2015,07,09
238,Not 5 Star Maybe 4.5,"Stayed at the Druids 2 weeks ago and I must say its a really nice spot. I'm not quite sure how Hotels get 5 Star ratings !!! Anyway, I wouldn't call a worn carpet or piping on one or two seats frayed etc along with unmown grass outside the bedroom window 5 star. Still the staff are very very good and the atmosphere is really very nice. Good food, good facilities, great golf etc. If your looking for a really nice weekend away - then this is an ideal spot. Another plus for this hotel is that there was a wedding on in the venue and you would not have noticed. Nice comfy beds, however our room had two 'doubles' which were on the small side.",4,2015,07,09
238,Half term holiday,"I stayed at Druids Glen for 4 nights over half term with my husband and 3 children. The service was excellent, with a very warm welcome for the children. There is a decent play area in the grounds and plenty to do nearby (aquarium in bray, fun pebbly beach, powerscourt). The pub-style restaurant was great and that's where we ate most of the nights but we had one meal in the more formal area, which was a bit more of a struggle with our kids. 
The pool area was lovely and the children really enjoyed the whole stay. They were a bit young to avail of the clubs or the games room but it's easy to see how they could eventually enjoy that kind of thing. 

One of the main advantages for us was that they were able to accommodate us and our 3 children in one room (2 double beds and a travel cot). However, having recently tried to book for another visit, we have discovered they will no longer do this and would suggest interconnecting rooms. For the sake of a baby in a cot, I don't think this is something we will do in the near future,as it's an extra €150 per night! Perhaps their lodges are worth a look...or another nearby hotel instead! 
",4,2015,07,08
238,Short stay in lovely hotel,"Spent one night here with my partner in late June. It's about a 45 minute drive from center of Dublin. Hotel is on two golf courses Druids Glen and Druids Heath. The former is regarded as one of the best parkland golf courses in Ireland.
When we checked in we were given warm hand towels which were very refreshing. Hotel room was lovely with really nice furnishings . Huge bathroom, fridge and tea/coffee making facilities. Also a nice bottle of Prosecco well chilled. 

Hotel has a upmarket restaurant and more casual dining. We went for the casual dining and food was really nice and reasonably priced. 
Breakfast was super with everything you could want including the full Irish.

Overall while a short stay a lovely hotel with great service.",5,2015,07,08
238,Stunning hotel but..,"The hotel is fabulous and we found staff to be friendly. However we did sit down in the bar on a Saturday afternoon and have to get up to get staff members attention to ask for menus and do the same again for the bill. We were also given the wrong room at check in, resulting in a hotel porter having to chase us and ask us to come back to the front desk. 
The bedrooms are beautiful and spacious. Only complaint we had was our room had an adjoining door to the bedroom next door. This was an issue when we were woken to people talking so loudly at 6am that it sounded like they were in our room! Being a golfing hotel I am assuming these were golfers. We also heard their TV over our own at night.
We ate in the bar for dinner and the food was delicious. My boyfriends surf and turf came out without the prawns however they brought these out quickly once we pointed it out. The cocktails we had were also very very good! However surprised to see they didn't do frozen daquiaris - surely the most commonly asked for cocktail! We were advised by staff as well that children were not allowed in the bar after 9pm which suited us well however we were disappointed to find this wasn't strictly adhered to.
Breakfast the next day was very good with a really impressive choice and selection of things to eat. Egg/omelette/pancake station is a big plus. Was just disappointed they had no nutella for pancakes and only a runny chocolate sauce which didn't taste great and only made my pancakes soggy. We also were sat down for a good 10-15minutes before staff asked us if we wanted tea/coffee and toast. She brought out our tea and coffee but no toast. We had to ask again for this when 10 minutes later it had still not arrived.
It is a very busy hotel with lots of children so if you're looking for a relaxing quiet night away I would stay elsewhere. However I would stay here again due to the excellent quality of the food and nice rooms.",4,2015,07,06
238,Hotel can accommodate large group,"We travelled as a family unit of 4 but meeting up with a larger group for a private dinner. This hotel can cater for such groups. It has good, large (and if required adjoining) comfortable rooms. Facilities good, family friendly, with pool (although temperature way too hot for proper swimming), spa, golf etc. I saw a playground. Found it easy to book spa which was good. Private dinner quite good, with efficient service. Fish dish very good. Private dinner food presentation of the fancy sort with smears of sauce across the plate and wee cubes of jellied whatsits to accompany your fish. Food in bar more casual, cheaper, with big chunky chips with your massive club sambo etc. Overall, I'm afraid, not my type of hotel being large,  characterless, anonymous but others would love it, I'd guess. Bet its popular for big weddings. Would not say this is a five star hotel but really a good 4 star.",4,2015,07,06
238,Very good place,"We stay 2 nights with baby . I loved every second of our stay. Beautiful accommodation, food was superb very good place for children.
very professional staff 
we would like to come back in october. would highly recommend this hotel",5,2015,07,05
238,Absolutely Beautiful!,"What a gem!  If you ever have the chance to spend some time in Wicklow, you won't find a nicer location to relax, eat and enjoy!  Druids Glen is a wonderful hotel - from check in to check out, the service is classy and welcoming.
We stayed for 2 nights - 2 adults, 1 child - and we can't wait to go back again.  The surroundings are gorgeous (helped by the sunshine!) and there is loads for adults and children alike - bikes, DVDs (with popcorn!), games room, outdoor playground, driving range . . . . well, well worth a visit!",5,2015,07,05
238,Delightful surprise,"we came upon the Druid's Glen Resort after arriving in Dublin without confirmation of accommodation.  Druid's Glen is a beautiful venue surrounded by lovely grounds, has an extensive menu, great facilities and the staff couldn't have been more helpful. Definitely deserving of 5 stars. It is a little out of town but easily reached by Dart (train) or bus + taxi. Wish we had more time there.",5,2015,07,04
238,Fantastic Massage,"Headed down to Druids Glen this week to avail of a spa treatment and lunch and had a lovely day.  The hotel itself is very impressive, the reception area when you arrive is bright, airy and the staff were so lovely there.  There were three of us and we all had massages, I had a massage with Orla and it was the best massage I ever had.  She was friendly, efficient and I thoroughly enjoyed my treatment, would highly recommend this lady.  We then had lunch in the restaurant and it was delicious, the staff were exceptional so friendly and very informative about the menu and drinks available.  We had the pate, pasta and caesar salad then the most gorgeous chocolate brownies which were huge portions and again delicious.  I would highly recommend this hotel for their spa, the treatments available there, the restaurant for their great food but most of all for all the great staff that this hotel is full of.",5,2015,07,03
238,Luxury,"Thank goodness for AC/DC who were playing in Dublin and we couldn't find accomodation. How lucky were we to find Druids Glen Resort. The staff are so helpful, the resort is in a lovely location and very relaxing.",5,2015,07,02
238,Did not want to leave!!,"Spent two nights here. Checked in by Adrienne who was welcoming. Teague, the concierge most friendly and great asset to the hotel as he took time out to explain getting to Powerscourt Waterfall and Gardens. 
Stayed in room 352..was really nice and a very comfortable bed. Lovely big bathroom with a good shower. Rooms exceptionally clean. Dined outside on decking on first night. Sean served us and service was very good. Barfood was reasonable and portions generous. Kevin served us drinks and was good craic. 
Breakfast was amazing..homemade guinness bread, homemade muesli and great selection of everything you could think off. Ordered an omelette on first morning made by Cillian which was very nice. 
Aoife served us dinner on second night..a brilliant and most pleasant waitress who was so efficient. 
We used the pool and facilities which were very relaxing.
On check out Marie was so lovely and made you want to stay. She also was great.
Enjoyed our stay in Druid's Glen and will return at some stage.",5,2015,07,02
238,Superb experience,"After horse riding nearby, my husband and I booked an overnight stay at the Druid's Glen to celebrate his birthday. Even before we stepped foot in the hotel we were impressed, having received a call a week before our stay to book a dinner reservation, and on arrival the service was just as attentive. 

Our room was spacious and traditionally decorated, very much in keeping with the country-theme, and we had a Juliet balcony to enjoy the beautiful views of the grounds. 

One of the big highlights was dinner, the menu was creative and with plenty of choice. The waiter who served us that night took the time to go through the specials, make suggestions and ask about our preferences. It was clear that a great deal of effort, skill and thought had gone into the menu, which we loved and appreciated. 

This is probably the first time I've experienced the kind of service you hope to get in every hotel you ever visit, complete with all the little touches (like complimentary water for our journey home) that made our special occasion even more so.  

Unfortunately we only stayed for one night, but we'll definitely go back again.",5,2015,07,01
238,Excellent Hotel Perfect for a few days Relaxation and Great Golf Course,I stayed here on a few occasions in the past but this time I found the Service and Staff were superb.The bedroom was excellent bathroom very well fitted out with shower separate.The breakfast was buffet but it offered a great choice and the Restaurant Manager gave us a full briefing as to where all the services were.We only stayed One night as we were at a Golf event but we plan to return soon as we felt the value was exceptional for this really fine property.,5,2015,07,01
238,Absolutely top notch.,"I loved every second of our stay. Beautiful accommodation, food was superb but what made it really special for us were the staff. I cannot recommend it enough and have already planned our return visit. Best money we have spent in a long time.",5,2015,06,29
238,Spa and restaurant afternoon,"Myself and a friend booked into the spa to avail of their special offers for June, and also had lunch and, later, afternoon tea in the hotel.  The service in the restaurant was excellent and afternoon tea was great value - especially as we shared a single portion between two, which was more than adequate.  The treatments were indulgent and enjoyable, although my treatment room opened directly onto the spa reception area, so I could hear all the conversations at reception during my treatment, so relaxing was somewhat compromised.  I was also disappointed with the facilities for changing.  I undressed in the treatment room, and was given a robe AFTER the treatment, which meant awkwardly gathering up my day-clothes and carrying them to a small and rather inadequate locker room where they were stored while i went to the relaxation room.  I think there may be a larger changing room, but as we weren't planning on using the pool, we weren't offered that option.  Later, our only option for dressing ourselves was to do so in the adjacent toilet, which did make the whole experience rather less indulgent.  But the treatment itself WAS lovely, and the venue was stunning.  I do plan on going again but might be more demanding about access to the changing facilities, and checking the location of the treatment rooms prior to booking.",4,2015,06,28
238,Nice hotel but nothing amazing ,Rooms were lovely however some parts a bit worn such as the doors.  Very family friendly hotel with lots of kids which I did know prior to going but not great for a romantic getaway.  The bar is very disappointing it was hard to get a nice seat and the service was quite poor. There was also a lack of atmosphere with no entertainment the night we were there.  However the food in the restaurant was gorgeous.  Overall it's a nice hotel but more like a three star.  ,3,2015,06,28
238,Wedding 27th June,"What can I say an amazing hotel, Greeted by very professional staff the minute we arrived . Room was really beautiful with all the facilities that we needed . Food was amazing , every thing cooked to perfection , Breakfast just as nice , will certainly visit again , Thank you",5,2015,06,28
238,Fabulous Stay,"Fabulous stay, from check in to check out we found the staff to be professional, polite & efficient. The room was of great standard, breakfast was amazing.  The amenities are well maintained and the hotel is very child friendly.  Will definitely be back !",5,2015,06,28
238,Absolutely the best resort in Ireland,"We went to Druids Glen Resort for a long weekend recently . We booked thru the hotel direct and the price was a lot cheaper than all the booking sites which was great. Honestly from check in to check out we had the best experience ever. Maria checked us in and couldn't be more helpful. Tadgh took us up to our room and all the way was chatting and a very warm and welcoming man. My wife is heavily pregnant and his congratulations to us were heartfelt and genuine. We ate in the bar the first afternoon and it was gorgeous, very busy but you never waited for service. One thing we noted all weekend was that there are plenty of staff employed. We had dinner in the restaurant and again the service from David was above and beyond and the food was unbelievable. Breakfast is just to die for, so much choice and a chef on hand to do waffles, omelettes etc. The pool and spa again are spotless , well kept and gorgeous. My wife used the spa and loved it . We didn't come across any bad staff, I absolutely cannot criticise Druids Glen in any way and would very highly recommend it. It's very family friendly too and once our little one arrives we'll definitely be back.",5,2015,06,28
238,Fabulous,"Fantastic hotel, brilliant staff. Rooms are spacious and luxurious.  Spa is lovely. By far one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in.  Huge breakfast menu although disappointed no soda or potato bread. Food was delicious. Great parking. Full gym",5,2015,06,28
238,Lovely Resort,We recently stayed in the resort using a groupon voucher the deal included €10 off a three course meal and a treatment in the spa. The hotel and bar staff were very friendly and helpful. The receptionist in the spa was less so! We had a wonderful meal and breakfast in the hotel. The room was very clean and spacious we had an excellent nights sleep. The next morning we were booked into the spa but we had to leave earlier than expected so we asked to cancel the booking we were then told we would have to pay full price even though we wouldn't be having the treatments. We were told it was hotel policy but it left a sour taste with us leaving. ,4,2015,06,25
238,Lovely hotel,"Stayed for one night with wife and 2 kids.  Very Child friendly hotel, and all the staff were very good and attentive with the kids.  ( age 2 & 3 months).  
Room was very clean and spacious, travel cot provided was excellent.  Food was good, rather pricey, but no real complaints. Pool was great for the kids as well, with family changing rooms.  

Overall, I would certainly comeback and we had a great one night stay in the Hotel",5,2015,06,24
238,Very Good Hotel,We arrived the day before our scheduled arrival date and although the hotel was fully booked due to a wedding the front desk staff went out of their way to try and find us accommodation in the area by calling various hotels and then by looking on the internet for us which was a level of service I have rarely seen.  When we checked in the following day we found the same friendly & professional attitude.  Our room was very spacious and clean and overlooked a courtyard with well maintained gardens. The only slight problems I had was with the slow service in the bar area and the one sunny afternoon the open air deck outside of the bar was completely closed to guests for a private function.  The breakfast was really good with a lot of choice.,4,2015,06,23
238,Great hotel and amazing staff,Visited Druids Glen for a special occasion and had a great time. Joanna and Shauna helped me organise a special event for my Girlfriend which worked out perfectly. We  also had our room upgraded and were treated like kings for the entire stay. The food in the restaurant was perfect and our waiter Allwyn waiter was a terrific host. Druids Glen offers an amazing breakfast and the food in the bar is terrific also. I would highly recommend a visit and we are looking forward to going back in the years to come.,5,2015,06,23
238,Beautiful & relaxing,This is a beautiful hotel and both the restaurant and bar have delicious food.  We only stayed for one night for our 1st wedding anniversary but we think this will probably become a yearly thing now as everything was top notch and it is just so peaceful and easy to unwind and take it east.,5,2015,06,22
238,Luxurious stay,"we arrived around 2.00 pm and the girl at reception was so nice and welcoming. Our room wasn't ready but she took our luggage and we went for a walk around the resort. Within half an hour we got a phonecall to say our room was ready and it certainly didn't disappoint. 
That night we had a meal in the dining room and the food was fabulous. Maeve looked after us so well and nothing was too much trouble for her. 
The following night we had dinner in the bar and although the service was very slow our waiter apologised sincerely. When the food arrived it was lovely. I suggested to the staff afterwards that if that were to happen again guests would really appreciate if a sample of breads or snacks were offered rather than let guests get too hungry. The previous night in the dining room they had trays of beautiful bread. 
I can only describe breakfast as a most fabulous feast. For anyone who loves their breakfast this is the place to stay. 
A special word of thanks to Mark, Stephen , Peter and Maeve. You are all true professionals and you all left a very big impression on us. 
All in all we had a wonderful stay in this hotel.",5,2015,06,21
238,Fabulous night away with the kids ,"We stayed here on the 19th June. All the staff were really friendly & so helpful. The kids aged 3 & 9 loved the Den, this provided hours of fun with their cousins as had lots of games for them to play & didn't close until 11. There was also a playground outside & the swimming pool so kids had a great time. The bedroom was nice & spacious. We were going to a party in the hotel that night so had a fabulous 4 course dinner served up to 45 of us. Everybody really enjoyed the food & service was excellent. Breakfast was really nice too, lots of options. I would so recommend this hotel & will definitely go back for another night. ",5,2015,06,21
238,Lovely hotel,"We stayed there in April as a couple but had a large dinner party .
The hotel is set in a lovely area ,not that pretty a building but made up for by lovely staff and food .
We played golf ,used spa and thoroughly enjoyed our few days here .",4,2015,06,18
238,Perfect Location,"This resort is well worth visiting,the rooms are superb,food is great and staff are very friendly helpful and efficient . If golf is your interest there are two superb courses and suitable for the average club golfer,particularly the par 3 involving driving over water. The venue is not budget priced but well worth the money.",5,2015,06,18
238,No spa appointments left,Can't say much wrong with the room or the food in the place but when we booked I asked when was the best time to book the spa as we got a voucher with group on for 20 euro each off a treatment along with the room. They told me to book the day I got there. After arriving in the place I was told that day and the next day were totally full and after driving 2.5 hours to stay a night and not being able to get a spa treatment I was disgusted. We had paid for a deal to get a spa and couldn't even get it. Shocking service.,3,2015,06,16
238,Perfect family hotel,"We stayed at Druids Glen with our two children (2 and 4) and were very impressed with what we found. The staff were very welcoming and nothing seemed too much trouble for them. Our room was very nice and there was lots for the kids to do with a pool, playroom and outdoor playground all of a very high standard. We ate lunch in the bar and dinner in the restaurant and both were delicious. Overall a very enjoyable break in a top class hotel.",5,2015,06,16
238,Could do better...,"Myself, my two sisters, my mother & sister-in-law visited The Druids Glen on 08/06/2015. I had arranged a dis-counted group booking day trip for us via an online deal that sounded too good to be true. Unfortunatley, this was not the experience I was expecting, nor the rest of my group. Firstly, I was contacted twice to confirm what treatments our party planned on having, which I felt was unnecessary. The deal was to have lunch, followed by using the pool facilities and then a treatment. We were about to order our lunch when we were advised that there was a different menu option for us, which included soup with salad/ sandwich which was lovley but not wha twe expected. Also, the lunch took a minimum of 45 minutes to come out. It appeared there was enough service staff but the delay in lunch meant that it cut into our time in the pool. Also, we didn't realise was the pool is only 'adult-free' from 12-3pm which was not advised on the website nor when I booked the deal. I love children but this was supposed to be a relaxing experience & instead we found ourselves in a pool with childrnen getting swimming lessons & it was very noisy. It appears to me that the Druids Glen are trying to 'wear too many hats' & either need to market themselves as 'relaxing' or 'family- orientated'- not both! On the plus side- the treatment was amazing, I think it was Pauline who did my 'ginger & salt scrub' which I would definatley recommend. Lastly, we decided to make it a full day out & came back to have dinner. Unfortunatley the food again took an age to come out & we were starving by the time we got it. Not sure what the problem was here but it would make me think twice about coming for food again- despite it tasting good. My sister-in-law ordered a herbal tea & we had to ask twice for this in 30 minutes & dessert took another 40 minutes to be served. Overall, I would try it again just to give it the benefit of the doubt & be fair, but I probably would have been very annoyed if I paid full price!!",3,2015,06,12
238,Wow - Beyond expectations,"From the moment we arrived in Druids Glen to the minute we left our stay was amazing.

We arrived for a girly spa overnight trip and was greated by the excellent Barry on reception, he has a way of making you feel so welcome without overdoing it, i can't say enough nice things about him.

The room was fantastic.

The spa was out of this world, the relaxation room before our treatments was the most relaxing place to wait, I'd be happy to sit there all day. The treatments were excellent.

The bar food was delicious and the service was excellent. 
Breakfast selection is top notch.

This was one of the best hotel's i've stayed in, i can't say a bad word about any aspect of my stay.

I will be returning without a doubt",5,2015,06,12
238,Perfect ,"Perfect get away. Food in bar is great so no need to eat in main dining area in my opinion. Bar was very busy when we were there so there was quite a delay getting drinks and food but staff were apologetic. Breakfast is delicious and lovely walks through the grounds. Staff are so lovely, especially Maria on front desk(think that was her name, she had an accent from the North of Ireland). I found the decor in the lobby a little odd but just my personal taste, it seemed dated compared to the rest of the hotel. ",5,2015,06,11
238,Truly Exceptional,"To our surprise we had been upgraded to a junior suite - it was an exceptional room! the staff at the hotel could not have been more friendly and welcoming. The food was melt in the mouth and the atmosphere at the bar was inviting. This hotel ranks high in my opinion, the only downfall was that there was little in the way of entertainment in the locality but it is the perfect R&R resort.",5,2015,06,09
238,Great stay! ,"Excellent stay. 

Hotel is situated on beautiful grounds. Staff extremely welcoming from the moment you arrive. 

Rooms are beautiful, spacious & clean. 

Dinner was delicious loved the cocktails afterwards!

All in all we had a great stay and will definitely be back.

238,Great time had at wedding,"Just stayed here for a family wedding.  What a fantastic place to stay.  The staff are this hotels crowning glory.  I want to especially pay credit to JD and the staff at breakfast and in the lounge.  Nothing at all was too much trouble.  From check in to departure, we felt that the staff treated everybody as a special guest,  This is the main reason why I would return to Druids Glen.  The hotel itself is lovely, The rooms were comfortable and well equipped.  One little thing, the pillows were a bit flat.  
The food at the wedding meal was in general very nice, however everyone at our table agreed that the vegetables were very undercooked.  Everything else was top notch.
Top marks to Druids Glen, as the small issues are easily overlooked, by the quality, professionalism, manner, cheerfullness and helpfullness of all the staff that we dealt with.",5,2015,06,08
238,A review like the rest- I suppose.,"There are over 1200 reviews for this hotel of which a high percentage of these are in the 'Excellent' to 'Very good' categories so you know you're going to have a good stay when there , Can it be improved - Of course every hotel can improve ways of doing things but I suppose it can come down to how you enjoyed it - I was there for a wedding so I didn't get to sample as much of the hotel as I'd liked , Its very family orientated as in the pool and games room (Altho on the second night the concierge/doorman asked one of the wedding guests to remove his 10 year old from the bar at 9pm, now having kids im all for them being out of bars after 7 but considering there was nobody in the bar except the wedding parties guests staying the second night and it was only on threat of all of us checking out there and then that he backed down - Could have been handled better on his behalf)  
Over all the staff,food ,location, amenities and service was great.",4,2015,06,08
238,Perfect Spa Break,"I recently stayed here and can honestly say it was one of the most relaxing a& wonderful stays I have ever had. I took a friend for a birthday treat & booked us in for two nights, from the moment we arrived to the moment we left everything was perfect. A warm welcome, lovely surroundings, spacious and accommodating rooms with added extras, a real treat. The Thirteenth bar is worth a visit, with a good food & drinks menu. A great breakfast selection (worth getting up for) and I loved the outside veranda area particularly in the morning. Stunning scenery, a lovely place to take in the fresh air & enjoy your surroundings. Hugos Restaurant is not to be missed, outstanding service, amazing food & great wines and then there is of course the spa;  a little bit of heaven on earth. An accomplished selection of treatments, professional staff with the most amazing treatments, two days here & I felt like I had been on holiday for a week I was so relaxed. If you were considering this hotel for a holiday, consider no more, go and book it, you will not be disappointed. This hotel really is full of warmth, charm & luxury.",5,2015,06,06
238,Gordon o hanrahan ,We stayed there recently for my wife's birthday and have to say from the minute we arrived till we left was a fantastic experience staff were so friendly and helpful a special mention to Ali our waiter who went the extra mile for my wife's birthday during our delicious meal in the restaurant and for the box of chocolates left in our room on arrival it's these personal touches that made this fantastic hotel stand out and will have us coming back in the near future,5,2015,06,05
238,A great overnight destination.....,"Should you want to get out of Dublin for the night and don't want to travel to one of my favourite places (anywhere that's in 'The Bluebook' hotel guide) then Druids Glen Resort is a great suggestion. Ok it's the ideal place for golfers - they roam the place in packs, beware at breakfast time it's like a busy shopping street as they try to fill up their humps to get out on the courses ASAP 😝. However it's not just for golfers, it's very family friendly, the leisure centre is well appointed for kids. Dinner last night was top class, we both had fillet steak it comes with enough potatoes and vegetables so I need for side dishes however we ordered polenta chips only because I've a thing about them, in that I used to like them but I'm no longer a big fan, I just want to see how they make them, had them in a Michelin Star restaurant a few years ago and I was never more disappointed but I can tell you Druids Glen restaurant has restored my faith in polenta!!!!! (Hats off to the chef) They were delicious, and on that matter, 2 courses is enough, and the wine list is inclusive with good prices. The desserts looked fab, had we not had a starter we would have had the sharing dessert, the couple beside us had it and it looked delicious and much better value. The staff are top class, everyone from the doorman to room service and all in between, a special mention goes out to Maeve and Kierstan(I think that's how she spells it, she's a trainee originally from Oregon)well anyway a special thanks to them they waited on our table last night and were excellent, I hope management see this comment and highlights this to them this on to them. The Spa is exactly what it says it is, it's small with excellent therapists, I had the Signature treatment, Orla is a top class therapist, thanks Orla. ",4,2015,06,05
238,Dissapointed,following my visit to Druids Glen last year when l gave everything a well deserved five star rating l was both surprised and disapointed to find standards not as good this year. The reception was welcoming and charming but somehow it appeared more scripted than sincere. The wonderful breakfast buffet that we had so been looking forward to was a big let down this year. We had to ask three different members of staff for tea coffee and toast which finally arrived when the breakfast had been finished. I ordered an omelette and on the third attempt at making it l cancelled it in favour of smoked salmon only to find the plates dirty! Disapointed yes will l be back next year yes as l have fallen under the spell of Druids Glen and have great hopes that these problems will have been sortef,4,2015,06,05
238,"Very enjoyable stay, as always.","We stayed in one of the newly decorated suites which was very comfortable. The greeting at check-in is always the friendliest we experience in any hotel. Lovely dinner in the bar. Only slight, very minor complaint is that the bulbs in the sitting area of the suite are a little too eco-friendly and too dim to read by. We hope to return soon.",5,2015,06,04
238,Beautiful grounds and well appointed rooms,"We stayed here our first two nights in Ireland. The rooms were very comfortable and the facilities are clean and well maintained.  There is a health club which was great for jet lag recovery and with a day of heavy rain, a great place to spend some time.  The restaurant at the golf club was outstanding as was the bar in the main hotel.  We were not so impressed with Hugo's where portions were quite small relative to price.  Breakfast buffet was fresh with much variety.  The staff is very pleasant and attentive.  All in all, I highly recommend this hotel.  There are a lot of families with small children so the pool can get noisy but they have pool hours where children are not allowed.",5,2015,06,02
238,Much Better at a Quiet Time,"I wrote a scathing review of Druids Glen after visiting during midterm break, having revisited on a quieter weekend it is only fair to re-review.  In short it is a great location, plenty to explore locally, very easy reach from Dublin and nothing else in the class as close which is why it does well I imagine.

It is a different hotel when not stretched to breaking point obviously, everything flows smoothly.
Dinner was a calm relaxed experience this time and the new decor in the restaurant is very relaxing and contemporary.  The staff are knowledgable, pleasant and very helpful.  The wine list needs a lot of work, for a 5 star hotel and given the type of food they are going for, it needs mid and top level wines.  We had beef which was excellant. The starter of scallops were very nice, albeit leaning towards artistic and tiny.  The shared desert option was not very good, it didn't feel the freshest.

Breakfast was great, again superb staff, all the food was good, fresh pancakes and eggs, and lots of other options both hot and cold.

We had lunch in the 13th bar and it was of very good quality, chowder and wings etc for the kids.  It was pretty full but the staff coped well and we had a nice lunch.

The pool is pretty busy as its a magnet for families so what can you do, it and the gym provide good facilities.

Room quality is excellent, warm, relaxed feel with high quality furnishings, a nice space to spend time in.",4,2015,06,02
238,Relaxing few days,"Stayed here for a couple of days with my 8yo daughters. Great base to explore the area. Staff all very attentive and helpful, though service in the 13th a little slow at times, but they were busy.

Room was spacious and the beds very comfortable. Pool was very busy about 4ish with families, but we had it to ourselves the next morning. Kids had a great golf lesson from the resident pro who gave me some useful pointers too.

Wifi in room was poor so ended up using a lot of phone data. A lot of children about, but didn't impact on our enjoyment.",5,2015,05,28
238,"Lovely Stay, Staff Brilliant!","Myself and my Fiancee stayed here on a midweek break for one night. On arrival we checked in and were given hot hand towels which was a nice little gesture, also as it was my fiancee's birthday they had a box of chocolates sent to our room after we settled in which was very generous! The room was very spacious and bed was comfortable, very clean also. However the only reason I did not give 5 out of 5 was the food. We ate in the bar that evening and was unimpressed with the flavours and quality of food served to us. The following morning we had breakfast and there were no eggs left. there was a guy on duty at the pancake/omelette area and he was under serious pressure to get the orders out, so much that some guests left without receiving their food. We asked about the eggs and were told they would be coming shortly, however after half an hour we gave up and left. It is only a small complaint but the breakfast staff were either understaffed or lazy! Overall a very nice stay and my compliments to the reception staff who are very friendly, especially Barry.",4,2015,05,28
238,Nice stay,"We stayed in the hotel for a romantic weekend. The room is big, clean and comfortable. The staffs are very friendly. There were different variety of food for breakfast, everything was very fresh. We had dinner in the restaurant. Food was nice, but portion was a bit small unless you have 3-course.",5,2015,05,28
238,Delightful (During the week),"We stay at this hotel a few days a year since my mother lives nearby. It is an excellent property, nicely renovated rooms and spacious bathrooms. Over the past few trips we have noticed on our weekend trips that there are usually large groups and lots of families. If you are an individual traveller it can sometimes feel you are rather on the sidelines. It can also be very noisy too. We had a suite this past weekend on the garden floor, our peace was over every morning around 8 am when the screaming kids marched through the corridors. The kids club is on this floor so we presume that the families are located nearby. 
Service is very efficient and the staff are very friendly too, when we mentioned our problems to the lady at reception we were offered a discount which we didn't expect.
Therefore my title to this review, if you are an individual traveller it's completely different during the week !. Our personal opinion is that they are pushing the ""family friendly"" a little too much.
Special praise to Thomas the waiter from India, he does an excellent job at the breakfast service, always clearing the table as it should be. (so many hotels just leave the plates to pile up till you leave)",4,2015,05,27
238,Time to chill,A beautiful hotel in beautiful surroundings.   Room was huge.  Dinner gorgeous in the dining room.  Drinks by an open fire in the foyer. Pity my friend and I didn't have time to try out the spa. Next time perhaps!,5,2015,05,27
238,"Beautiful room, uncomfortable bed","This resort is a tad difficult to find.  There are small signs posted off the N11 to guide you, but they can be easy to miss.  Our room was very spacious and beautifully appointed, but the bed itself was hard.  We actually tucked our duvet under the bottom sheet to finagle a ""pillow top"" to help us rest better the second night.  Strangely, the tap water tastes quite foul - like dirt.  Thankfully, guests are provided with two complimentary bottles of water daily.  For an upscale property, it seemed chintzy for the room attendant not to replace the spare roll of toilet tissue the second day.  The breakfast was plentiful and good.",4,2015,05,26
238,Druid's magical spell,At first I thought the hotel was in an isolated spot but I soon fell under its magical spell. I loved everything about it. The staff were so friendly and courteous at all times. The food was excellent. All the facilities were first class. I would highly recommend it for a lovely relaxing holiday.,5,2015,05,26
238,Great hotel,"We stayed here for one night on a special offer which included €20 each off a round of golf and €20 of dinner in the restaurant.

In a nutshell, great hotel, great location, great staff (for the most part) great food and challenging golf (Druid's Heath).

Only one gripe...........
Management needs to get its act together where 'special offers' are concerned and staff need to be fully tuned in to the terms of special offers, otherwise the customer's experience may be spoiled.
Everybody loves a special offer but the customer doesn't need to be reminded of his/her 'special offer' status.  This happened to us twice in the course of our stay.  Once in the restaurant when the waiter repeatedly (and loudly) asked us what deal we were on.  Also, our €20 credit on the meal was reduced to €10 by the Manager when we didn't have three courses each (one of us didn't feel hungry enough for desert).  What sort of logic is this?!  Had we both taken desert the full €20 discount would have been applied.   We argued our case and the full discount was then applied.  You may ask, whats the problem if the issue was addressed? My point is that the customer shouldn't have the pleasure of a relaxing break spoiled by staff being indiscreet or just dense about fairly basic stuff.  
The second incident occurred on checkout.  We paid our bill and noticed when we got to our car that we had been charged in full for our round of golf (the 'special offer' of €20 reduction per person had not been applied).  We went back to reception and staff quickly sorted the matter out by crediting my VISA card. However, one 'scorpy' staff member who didnt immediately understand what was going on, cut in while the business was being done and practically made us feel like we were trying to pull a fast one. 
Again, the customer shouldn't have to watch this sort of stuff all the time.  Staff should be tuned in to the terms of a customer's stay.........and this review would have ended with the second paragraph!
Not to end on a negative note, this is a really great hotel and we would happily go back there.....provided there's a good 'special offer'!

238,Highly recommended,"I was recently a guest at a communion party and my first impression of the hotel was fantastic! It looked beautiful and I was very warmly greeted by a man named Oli. When we arrived we went to the bar before our meal in the restaurant where the service was brilliant, the staff were so friendly and efficient myself and my husband were very impressed. We were brought to our table by a man named Edward who was really friendly and then served by Rebecca and she was really obliging nothing was an effort she even carried our drinks to the restaurant where we had an amazing meal served yet again by really nice staff. Will definately be back again, food was so good and great service all round even while the place was v busy.",4,2015,05,25
238,Perfect Easter Break for a family. ,"Stayed here for two nights over Easter 2015. Travelled with wife and three kids. We had adjoining rooms which was great and the kids loved having their bedroom complete with mini dressing gowns. 
Two kids attended the kids camp in the evening and the youngest came with us for dinner. Dinner was excellent and served in the restaurant. People travelling without kids seemed to eat in a kid free dining room which would be needed as the hotel did seem to very heavily populated with little people. 
Breakfast each morning was areal treat and I would highly recommend Druids Glen - perfect getaway. Love to go back. ",5,2015,05,25
238,Disappointing,"Stayed here for one night for a special occasion. Given the price of the room for the night and from reading the great reviews we had high expectations. The staff were very friendly and helpful and check in was very fast. The room itself was spacious and spotlessly clean. There was no mini bar in the room which was disappointing.We went down to use the spa and you have to pay €3 for swimming hats, so it's worth bringing your own. The spa itself the first evening we visited was very busy with children everywhere, it was a lot quieter the next morning as its adults only between 12 and three. My big disappointment was with the bar food, it was very busy and it took awhile to get a table, I ordered a pasta dish for my main which was terrible and I left most of it behind me, my partner ordered a steak medium done and it came out burnt, he ate it anyway, no one came down to us during the meal to ask how it was,when it came to clearing the table, I was asked was my meal ok, I said no I didn't like it, but I wasn't offered any alternative or was I asked what was wrong with it. The bar was full of children running and racing and it was not the relaxing break I thought it would be. Possibly more of a family destination that for couples.Very disappointing and over priced.",3,2015,05,23
238,Very Comfortable stay,"Despite this hotel being clearly geared up golfers, it is infact a very good place to stay for anyone not involved in Golf. The rooms were sizeable and beds comfortable, with health suite on the 2nd floor.
We had dinner in the bar, both starter and main were very good. Especially liked the spicy chicken wings. There was also plenty on offer for breakfast, with chef's station to create made to order dishes.",4,2015,05,20
238,Nice hotel but not 5 star,Stayed here for a wedding. I was really looking forward to my stay at Druids glen as when I was growing up it was one of the real exclusive hotels and golf courses. I have to stay I was disappointed. The hotel was basic and nothing like I had imagined. Nice venue for a wedding though.,3,2015,05,19
238,romantic weekend,"Great staff and food. Got weather report each morning delivered. Fabulous breakfast. 
However very surprised and disappointed with the thin walls between the bedrooms - a place of this quality and with these prices - we had loud television noise and children screaming day and night. Did raise it with the hotel. We stayed three nights and were relieved when our neighbours checked out after two nights. Feel they should have been asked to pipe down and not leave their kids run around the hallways at night and early in the morning.
Can't fault the food or staff just a pity about the thin walls - not something I expected.
Regarding the lovely surroundings - its a golf course so walking trails are restricted. It is a beautiful place and a car is recommended to go check out the coast.",4,2015,05,19
238,Niamh Fitzsimons ,"Outstanding. From the minute we checked in, we were made feel very welcome and comfortable. All staff are extremely friendly and knowledgeable (as well as efficient). We had dinner, breakfast and lunch as well as some amazing spa treatments here. 
The trip was for my other half's birthday and when that came into conversation, they went that extra mile. Chocolates & a card were delivered to the room as well as writing it on his dessert plate! 😀
Didn't want to leave and we're already looking forward to returning. Thank you Druids Glen! 

",5,2015,05,19
238,"Super friendly and efficient staff, but not very clean.","The staff is extremely friendly and helpful with everything. Restaurant, bar, swimming pool and gym are excellent too.

The problem was with the cleaning services of our room. Pillows had a bad smell of mould, the amount of dirty things under the beds was unreal also. In addition, there was mould at the bottom of of the bathroom stall and the temperature of the water coming from the shower was unstable, going from cold to warm constantly.

Another strange thing is that on the family room there was not a single kids TV channel available. By the way, the indoor playground needs to be better kept, available toys are very old and missing pieces... even my 5 and 3 years old children did not feel like playing with the toys on that condition.

Overall our stay was very relaxing and we had a great time, but this is definitely not a 5 stars hotel... maximum 4 stars. If hotel management brings the cleanliness of the rooms to a higher level it would be able to compete with 5 star hotels.",3,2015,05,18
238,1 night stay ,"Very friendly receptionist as check in. Room was tastefully decorated with big comfy bed. The rooms all have sky sports which was a big bonus for us. The bathrooms clean but could do with an upgrade. The temperature of the shower was changeable but the pressure was good. The pool, jacuzzi, steam room and sauna were good if a little dated. Would advise checking children's times for pool area before visiting. Breakfast was varied, fresh and tasty. Service at breakfast was very attentive. ",4,2015,05,18
238,"Outstanding family holiday - excellent staff, venue, facilities and food","This hotel is not to be missed. We will be back very soon.  We brought our 2 year old son for a night away and at no stage lost for something to do.  The hotel is amazing, food is amazing and the best staff I have come across in any hotel worldwide.  From welcome to departure (even a bottle of water each for your journey home).  Nothing was to much. In many high star hotels its often hard to keep a 2 year old busy however early morning wake up is no issue as we could play in the play park outside or if to cold we played with all the toys in the games room.  The food was outstanding.  Dont look past this place, simply outstanding.  Congrats to the staff for creating such an outstanding venue.",5,2015,05,18
238,Best service in a long time!,"Where do I begin? Amazing! From arrival to departure! Staff are an absolute asset of the hotel. I am a hotel manager myself and I truly could learn a thing or two from all of them! Cannot remember when last time concierge ( I think name was Tighe) would say - ""oh no, you already gave me a tip"". Food was fabulous! Service excellent in both Room Service and Restaurant. I also lost a diamond earring in the room and Jo was an absolute pleasure to deal with. I truly thought there was no hope in finding as it's quite small. I got it back and even got a follow up phone call to check if it got delivered ok! Asked for late check out and that was no problem... Seriously amazing hotel! Would recommend it to anyone without any hesitation and cannot wait to come back... ",5,2015,05,15
238,Relaxing Stay,"Stayed here for two nights. Very enjoyable stay, staff are brilliant very friendly and efficient. Room was fabulous, just like the picture above with a fab view over the golf course. Food in the bar was lovely. Very relaxing overall. Would definitely return.",5,2015,05,15
238,Highly Recommend!!!!,Just returned from a fabulous stay with family and friends for a vacation. Staff were wonderful. Scenery and countryside absolutely beautiful. Food was amazing every morning. Highly recommend and would definitely come again.,5,2015,05,12
238,Great service from arrival to leaving,Stayed at the hotel in February with family. Reception staff very welcoming and couldn't do enough for you and a very personal service.  Food at breakfast and dinner of a very high standard.  All the staff I came across at the hotel all very pleasant.  Games room and outside play area for children. There is beautiful grounds around the hotel and bikes are available to use.,4,2015,05,12
238,Amazing Massage and Lunch!,"I went for a mini spa day with a friend and was pleasantly surprised by Druids Glen!  Typically, we head to a hotel/spa in Gorey, but this is much closer, so we decided to give them a try. Don't think we will be heading to Gorey again!  

Upon entering, we were greeted by professional and friendly staff.  We were directed to the changing area and since we were a bit early, we were able to sit in the relaxation room for a bit before our massages.  It is such a nice atmosphere with comfortable lounge seating.

I was then called in for my massage by Bushra.  I was left to prepare for the massage and she returned in a very timely manner.  Often, at other facilities, I have been left waiting upwards of 10 minutes, but not here.  Bushra was very accommodating, making sure I didn't need anything before she started and making sure I was comfortable.  She confirmed any allergies to be sure the use of coconut oil was appropriate.  She then began what was one of the best massages I have ever had!

I tend to have issues with my neck and shoulders and she paid close attention to that area.  I have had occasion where a masseuse will focus ONLY on where I have trouble, but Bushra made sure that all areas were tended to. 

I came out of the massage room blissful.  Bushra was outside the door to greet me and to make sure everything was fine.  I thanked her and told her what a wonderful job she had done and she thanked ME!  No thanks needed! 

My friend and I then sat in the relaxation area for a bit because we were so calm and relaxed after our massages.

We then opted to head to the sauna/hot tub for a bit.  The area was clean and well looked after.  Only a handful of others were in there, so it almost felt like we had it to ourselves.

Once we showered and changed, we headed to the restaurant for lunch, as there was a special going where lunch was included with our massage. The staff were prompt in attending to us, even though it was quite busy.

The menu for the special package was small, but had some really nice options.  I had the soup and sandwich, which were delicious.  I can't recall the exact soup, but it was a carrot based one (maybe carrot and parsnip?) and it was very nice.  Flavorful, smooth and filling!  I has a chicken sandwich with salad and mayonnaise, which I could only eat half of, but it was tasty!

All in all, it was a very nice day at Druids Glen and I will definitely return next time I am in town!!  Thanks to everyone in the spa and restaurant for making a short trip feel like a weekend away!",5,2015,05,11
238,Day Spa Experience - A Bit Hit & Miss.  Definitely not five star.,"We had treated ourselves to a Day Spa Experience here - but with a Groupon coupon - and I am always a little nervous if that clouds how you are treated at a business.  But when we arrived at the spa, the staff were amazingly helpful, pleasant and professional.  We lead very stressful and busy lives, so this was a real treat for us to take a day out and we were really looking forward to it.  The deal included one treatment each and lunch.  So changed into our togs and slipped into the lovely robes and slippers we would be wearing for the day and headed to the relaxation room - which was lovely - until it was time for our treatment.  They were really excellent and overall, our experience in the Spa was very enjoyable.  However, it was disappointing to pull back the blankets on the loungers to see brown stains on them.  And so it was time to go for lunch, but we were told we had to get dressed again to head to the Pavilion restaurant - which kind of defeats the purpose of a relaxing day spa experience!  But we were hungry and so did was we were told and headed to the restaurant with our voucher.  The tables weren't really suitable for dining as you had low armchairs - the two we were sitting at were really tatty and not in a shabby chic way - and had to perch at the end to eat your food.  We had to order from the spa menu, which was pretty sparse.  We both had the soup and the sandwich option.  Soup was carrot and parsnip - I asked for egg mayo on brown and hubby had ham and cheese toasted.  And we were just given two glasses of water.  The waiter wasn't great and when the food arrived, I was tempted to ask where the rest of it was.  The soup was fine and thankfully was served with small bits of brown bread because the sandwiches consisted of two fingers each of what we had ordered.  There were also a few crisps on the side, but when I put my hand in to take mine out, I found brown stains on my fingers!  Thankfully, it was just chocolate, but it was still a dirty bowl.  The waiter could not have cared less.  But we were determined to make the most of the rest of our day so headed back to the spa to get changed again to go swimming.  The pool is separate to the spa and when we arrived, we were told we would need swimming hats - at €3 each.  We have visited other spas around the country and have never been asked to wear hats before, or at the time of booking, they let you know that you will need a hat.  This just felt like we were being 'tapped' for €3 each.  Overall, not a five star experience at all because incredible service is what's at the heart of a five-star experience and this was completely lacking here.",4,2015,05,10
238,Recommend ,"Beautiful hotel with very good staff. Either very well trained or love their jobs either way it's a bonus when staff seem happy to serve you. Stayed for 2 nights with hubby for my 40th Birthday on 6th and 7th May, as a treat we paid extra for the nicer room with vaulted ceiling on higher floor, and were disappointed when we arrived at our room to look out on a car park and on ground floor... no vaulted ceiling, rang Stefan on reception and explained and straight away he came with proper room keys and escorted us to correct room. 
We dined both nights in hotel, 1st night in Hugo's restaurant and served by Loic (I think) he was so lovely and fantastically charming and witty at his job, recommending I try a different wine than I had ordered with my meal ( lol maybe they were short on one I ordered) it was perfect. 2nd night dined in the bar and perfect again. We went for walk on walking/jogging trail around golf club... wouldn't rate to highly bit muddy and you actually don't get to see much of golf course. In fact so boring we chanced a short cut back to hotel accross the fairways!!! (spoiled here in west ireland with scenic Greenway ) Breakfast fab btw. My only recommendation to hotel is wash your skirting boards they are dusty. Sunlight shows up dust! Yes would say again. ",4,2015,05,09
238,Excellent staff but it was noisy and didn't feel like a 5* hotel.,"I have to say the staff were all fantastic and couldn't be nicer. I enjoyed my stay but if I was to return I would only come mid-week and I advise other people the same. We went to the bar for food in the evening and the people there were so noisy that my boyfriend and I couldn't even hear each other talking. Our room wasn't near the bar yet we could hear the music/entertainment in our room- not exactly what I was expecting for my relaxing birthday stay. We were also woken up at 4.45am by noisy neighbours in the room beside us, seemly having a room party! Luckily when we phoned reception to report it security sorted it immediately (the staff are great).

The other small things that made it feel less than 5* were when I went for my spa treatment they had me down for the wrong thing. The therapist got a tad flustered. It didn't bother me because I got it sorted but I didn't expect this from a 5* hotel. When we ordered food in the bar my meal didn't arrive until my boyfriend was halfway through his. Frankly this is not acceptable anywhere, except maybe McDonalds!",3,2015,05,09
238,"Amazing hotel  ""A must visit""","Druids Glen Resort has to be my favourite hotel I have ever visited. From the location to the food every small detail has been thought of. You will truly be swept away by this hotel. The staff are amazing, friendly and great at their jobs. The cocktails are to die for and the scenery is breathtaking. I went for a spa weekend and small celebration with a friend in Ireland and couldn't have gone to a more magical location. The spa and treatments are fantastic. Best massage I have ever had. Even the smallest details are there with loccitane in the bathrooms.
Can't wait to return.. May even take the hubby for the golf... ",5,2015,05,07
238,Customer Service Shines Through,"The revamped restaurant has really friendly staff. Little touches like asking was it a special occasion, then bringing desert to celebrate our wedding anniversary make a difference.  The food, particularly the starter was delicious. The space still has the feel of a hotel function room and the kitchen seemed to muddle most of the other tables orders, probably due to the sheer volume of diners they are catering for at the same time. We had a great night and will return.",4,2015,05,06
238,Amazing,"Beautiful resort with very helpful, friendly staff. Beautiful, peaceful grounds.  Excellent food and amenities. The rooms are good sized and lovely. Daily afternoon tea. Variety of spa services as well as golf course. Just an hour south of Dublin Airport in Wicklow National Park. Very highly recommended. ",5,2015,05,04
238,golfing break,spent four days on golfing trip with 23 friends both golf courses in tip top condition everything five star also hotel no complaints whatsoever.would recommend this golfing venue to all even if you cant play very well you can enjoy the magnificent scenery.,5,2015,05,03
238,Relaxing break away from the city! ,"We had a one night stay at Druids Glen for a bit of r'n'r and definitely made the right hotel choice! Staff were very friendly and helpful, nice walk around the grounds (although the map from reception was a little confusing!), fantastic room with lovely bath facilities and plenty of choice at breakfast! ",4,2015,05,01
238,Great stay,"Beautiful views , spent three nights here , Hugo's restaurant was lovely but not to my personal taste so we spent our final two nights in the bar where we felt very comfortable and welcome , our waitress Sophie could not do enough for us she was efficient ,warm and funny ,I would highly recommend this hotel and their staff!!",5,2015,04,30
238,Packed and noisy!!,"We stayed here last Sunday night and it was extremely busy. Kids everywhere!! Total nightmare .Struggled to get a seat in the bar. Bar and lobby areas were freezing!!!! Definitely no cosy factor. Big let down when we were expecting to just settle in for a few glasses of wine on a relaxed Sunday night. We thought it would have been very quiet.

Walk around the golf course was disappointing - most of it is along a narrow roadway. 

It was a birthday for one of us and despite mentioning this on booking, and requesting a quiet room, neither request was acknowledged. 

Food was very good and staff were lovely.

Wouldn't choose to go back.",2,2015,04,30
238,Great Service,"My wife and I recently stayed in Druids Glen for a midweek break. The most impressive aspect of the hotel was the high level of service. It was top notch from arrival to checkout. 
The food at breakfast and dinner was of a very high standard. Waiter Ali, in Hugo's restaurant was most helpful and added some nice surprises to our evening meal for my wife's birthday. Highly recommend",5,2015,04,30
238,Fantastic hotel ,"I stayed in Druids Glen last weekend with my wife and 2 small kids for two nights and was really impressed with everything the hotel had to offer from their service to the facilities. We loved every minute and would highly recommend staying. Every single staff member we dealt with was excellent and the food amazing. 
 ",5,2015,04,29
238,Master's weekend masterfully executed....,"We stayed here during the recent Augusta Master's and were expecting a packed bar, lots of golf talk and lots of activity. And that's what we could have had.... if that's what we wanted. However we were there to relax and this is the place to do it! 

No denying that this is a busy hotel, especially with the very child friendly atmosphere here but at no time do you feel anything other than relaxed here. Calm decor, friendly staff, beautiful rooms and just a general sense of rest and relaxation is everywhere here.

We ate in the bar on night one, having been checked into a gorgeous suite, complete with its own little executive golf game. A lovely nod to what this location is famous for. As expected the golf was on in the bar,happy days! But sound was down so didn't intrude. Food..... hole in one. 

Day two, started with breakfast and the papers. then we enjoyed the sauna, steam room and pool area. This was very busy with children but it wasn't an issue for us. Nice, spotless and decent Jacuzzi. Choice of two steam rooms, plunge pool. Very enjoyable all in all. 

Ate in the restaurant Saturday night and the food is some of the most memorable I have had the pleasure of eating. Nothing could be faulted. We had a meal as part of our package but next time,for next time there shall be, I'm going for the a la carte.... Service was great, wine was tasty and every bite was a considered and perfect part of the .real. no senseless, tasteless splashes across the plate. All contributed to the meal. 

Breakfast both mornings was lovely. Such a good choice, healthy choices considered and catered to and once again, excellent service. Thank you to all involved in making our stay so enjoyable.",5,2015,04,29
238,Friendly. relaxed and inviting,"The staff at this hotel were lovely. Helpful and friendly without being stuffy or too formal. My room was amazing. Great size with a separate shower and bath. The bed was huge and comfy. In room safe, tea and coffee and water provided which was great. I used the pool which was clean, quiet and a good size. I ate in the bar and the staff were friendly, helpful and welcoming. It was also lovely to sit by the lobby fire and relax. Good choice for breakfast too
Hope to visit again",5,2015,04,29
238,Golfing Trip,"I recently stayed at this Hotel for a golfing break and the Hotel certainty lived up to it's reputation. From arriving at the Hotel the welcome by the reception personnel was by any standard 5*. Check in was a very pleasant experience. From the hot towels given to us by the receptionist and the  uncomplicated registration process. All through the stay the staff were polite efficient and nothing was a bother. Food is of exceptional quality and very well presented. I could not recommended this Hotel highly enough. I never got to use the Spa and Leisure facilities but they are extensive. So if you ever visit this part of Ireland I would highly recommend Druids Glen to base your stay.
 ",5,2015,04,28
238,Very welcoming,"My husband and I stayed here with our 5 month old baby and were really delighted with the warm welcome we received! Nothing was too much for the staff who are informative and professional at all times.  We chose Druids Glen after reading reviews from families with small babies and we are glad we did as they have everything you could need.  There is a play room for older kids, a kitchenette with bottle steriliser, nappies even baby food! The rooms are spacious and well kept. The fact that the hotel caters for kids so well, I was afraid that it may seem like a crèche but I needn't have worried.  I would have no hesitation in returning to Druids Glen for a relaxing break away in the future.",5,2015,04,28
238,Girlie Night,"It was my first time in Druids Glen, entrance and grounds on approach are beautiful.
We were early as having treatments in spa but we could leave our bags at reception until our room was ready, receptionist gave us directions to pool and spa areas, did find it eventually after a maize of corridors... 
Used the pool area for about an hour before our trip to spa, 
I had booked the Payout So Soft So Magic Wrap, Sorcha was my therapist, she explained everything before she started and what products she would use, she asked what pressure of massage I liked.
Then the treatment started, first with a hot towel on my feet, full body brush, full exfoliate, full mask and while that was doing it bit Sorcha gave me a head and neck massage, this was followed by a warm shower to wash mask off, back on the bed for a fantastic full body massage, amazing...
I've had similar treatments over the years but this was the Best Ever, 
It lasts about 90 mins and its worth every penny. I will be back and would definitely ask for Sorcha.
We chilled in our room with a bottle of vino,  went to the bar for food drinks about 6.30, it was very busy, got a table and ordered, food OK for price.
There were a lot of kids, though they were well behaved noise wise, they were in the way of staff at the steps where staff are back and forth to kitchen, there was no disasters but its a disaster waiting to happen... 
Room and bed very comfy, great breakfast.
Staff very friendly only draw back and why I'm not giving 5 stars is the layout of hotel, otherwise faultless.",4,2015,04,27
238,Wonderful stay,"We stayed in Druids Glen for our first weekend away with our five month old daughter. We wanted somewhere special for our first trip away and Druids Glen did not disappoint. 
The room was very spacious even with the travel cot and many bags of baby stuff we had brought.  The staff were very helpful with a special mention to Teadgh, ( I don't think that is the correct spelling) who was so helpful with our luggage on arrival and departure. The bar has stunning views and the food was lovely too. I had a truly relaxing treatment in the spa and we went on lovely family walks around the grounds.
We had a fabulous time and we cannot wait for our return visit.",5,2015,04,27
238,Great with a small Baby,My wife and I travelled with our 5 month old baby as our first family trip away and we could not have been happier.  From the time we pulled up and the concierge Tadgh greeted us to the time he waved us off we had a fantastic trip.  Anybody with a small child/baby looking for a suitable getaway look no further than Druids Glen,5,2015,04,27
238,Lovely stay,"Just back from a one night stay with 5 other family members. Fab time had by all. Marie on reception couldn't do enough for us. Overall staff were great, very efficient & friendly. Food in the bar was gorgeous. Meal in the restaurant was beautiful. I had Sirloin steak which was ok. My sister had the fillet beef & it home as fab! I would recommend the fillet over the sirloin. All the mash, veg etc was yummy & the staff serving were excellent. Hotel lobby, rooms, toilets, everything was spotless. Grounds are beautiful. Loads of lovely little extras I.e. free newspaper, chocolate & card for my sister for her birthday, hot flannel on arrival etc. Just lovely. Can't wait for my next visit. ",5,2015,04,26
238,One of the best,Spent last Friday and Saturday in Druids and also played Druids Glen. From check in to check out it was top class. Great choice at breakfast that even had a chef attended station. Great buzz in the bar and food at a function on Saturday night was very good. The golf course is one of the very best in Ireland and was in great condition. Overall it was a brilliant stay and cannot compliment all the staff highly enough. They are really very good.,5,2015,04,23
238,Excellent in every way,"We have just returned from a two day break at Druids Glen which was outstanding in every way.  On arrival we were greeted with hot towels and were dealt with in the most pleasant and professional way.  Nothing was any bother and all information was to hand.  We asked about an upgrade and were shown the different rooms and were able to make our choice.
Rooms are spacious and have everything that could possible be needed including fridge, wifi, robes, slippers etc.  Ours looked out onto the glen and part of the golf course with a view that was wonderful. There are lots of places to sit and relax and a lovely decking area that also looks out over the golf course and woods.  We had dinner which was part of our package and it is hard to describe how good the food and attentive service was.  My only regret is that I had not brought my phone to dinner and didn't get pictures on the fabulous presentation of the food.  The quality of food and service was repeated each morning at breakfast, among all the usual items there was a chef on hand to make fresh omelettes, all manner of eggs, pancakes etc.
We don't play golf but this place made me wish that I did!  There is a well marked walking/jogging trail that circles the course about 4k in distance.
Taking everything into consideration this is probably the best stay we have had anywhere in Ireland",5,2015,04,23
238,Best Family Friendly Hotel we have ever stayed in.,"We stayed in the hotel for one night over Easter and I can't rate it any higher for a family friendly break. Everything from the kids steps up to the reception desk, the dvds, the present for the kids on arrival, the kids dressing gowns, playground, bikes, games room, kids club and the highlight for my kids was the room service - the lovely round table, the waiter that brought it up made them feel very special :)",5,2015,04,22
238,Amazing is an understatement! ,"Nicest hotel in Ireland! 7 of us stayed here last Sunday night and we all had an amazing time. We will all be back! The food, service and staff are all 5 star.  We all had treatments in the spa and really enjoyed them. It's all the small touches that set it apart from other hotels like giving you a bottle of water on departure for you journey and Magazines in the rooms etc. I already planning a return trip with hubby. 
",5,2015,04,21
238,Definately a 5 star experience,"We stayed for one night to celebrate my son's Confirmation and everything was excellent.From the moment we arrived until we left the staff excel in every way,special mention to Loic and Louis.There was a small gift for my son in the room which was a lovely touch.The reception and downstairs lobby is bright,airy and has a lovely atmosphere which is carried through to the bar and restaurant.The bedrooms are spacious and the refurbishment is tasteful with beautiful silk curtains and restful colours.My only minor quibble would be the size of the beds in the family room,they are standard doubles which makes sleeping in one with a child of any size difficult,as any parent will agree!IThe bed in my Mum's room was enormous and as I spent the night squashed against my ten yr old I did wonder why the family rooms weren't given equally large beds,the rooms are certainly large enough.But that is a minor issue,everything else was flawless!
We began staying in Druids Glen approx. five years ago and have always loved it.Back then it was a 5 star but in reality I would not have compared it with the leading hotels in the country,it is a different story now however,Druids is up there with the best of them,all the touches are there,and the staff are obviously happy in their work which shines through...",5,2015,04,20
238,Pampering to Perfection,"Myself and my friend stayed in the Druids Glen Resort for a one night spa break. 
From the moment of arriving at the hotel we could not be made feel more welcome and pampered.  From Taidgh who tended to our bags to the very informative and helpful lady behind reception who's name escapes me right now (maybe Joan), our every need was met.  We took a lovely walk to the Club House which given the beautiful day was a great way to work up an appetite for dinner.  Another reward for walking to the club house are the amazing views from this beautiful building.
We had dinner booked for 8 o clock which in retrospect may be too late of a dinner booking as we missed out on the specials of the evening which I know we would have both have been very interested in, also as the restaurant was so busy service was on the slightly slow side,nothing of great concern when your spending the rest of the evening relaxing in the bar.  Breakfast in the morning was just the best I have had in any hotel to date.  The variety and presentation of the food was just fantastic with the service as throughout the stay being just excellent.  
Finally the spa treatments..both were amazing... I had the full body massage, my friend a facial.  The massage was possibly the best I ever had.  
Overall ,all I can say is that  I will most definitely treat myself to another visit to Druids Glen before the year is out.. I'm looking forward to it already ....",5,2015,04,19
238,Anniversary break,Excellent would be an under statement. From the moment you check in you are welcomed with a friendly receptionist. This continues with the bar and restaurant staff. Nothing was a bother. Great staff. Great food. Will certainly be back. I have stayed in many hotels around the world and this is one of the best.,5,2015,04,15
238,Total excellence,"Where do I start?  We stayed at Druids Glen for three nights to celebrate my wife's birthday in March.  From the moment we arrived to the second we left, nothing was too much trouble for the staff at Druids Glen.  

Upon arrival we were greeted by Barry, who checked us in, arranged for our bags to be taken to our rooms and provided us with a comprehensive overview of the resort.  Barry also gave us directions to local attractions and even printed maps for us.

Our room was spacious and very comfortable, with a large bathroom, an in room fridge and the wi fi was complementary.  The resort leisure facilities are excellent and the pool area was always clean.  I indulged in a massage and my therapist, Orla, knew how to find the stress knots in my shoulders!

We ate in the 13th bar on two occasions and both times the food and service were faultless.  

On the evening of my wife's birthday we treated ourselves to a meal in the brasserie and we weren't disappointed.  Our server was French (sorry I can't remember his name) and he was very attentive throughout the entire meal.  I had mentioned to the front desk that it was a birthday celebration and the staff arranged for candles and had written 'Happy Birthday' in chocolate on her dessert plate.  

The breakfast service is choreographed by Duncan who seamlessly  whizzes around checking everything is to your liking and makes you feel special and very welcome.  

The grounds are well maintained and offer some nice relaxing walking trails around the perimeter of the golf courses, helping you get away from it all!

Checkout was as seamless as checkin.  I would definitely recommend Druids Glen for a getaway and look forward to going back again, soon.
",5,2015,04,14
238,A weekend break,Lovely place for a break - even with all the children! Staff were excellent - nothing too much trouble. Food lovely. A bit disappointed in superior bedroom. Was told there was a balcony - place to put one's foot out only. The promised view of the mountains was a view on to some apartments. Overall though I would return.,4,2015,04,12
238,Quick break away,"Excellent resort, excellent staff, excellent food and an excellent stay. We booked in for one night but wanted to stay much longer. We only got to use the pool and the restaurant but our treatment and the product supplied was fantastic. The room spacious and we really didn't want to leave the next day. Book it soon",5,2015,04,11
238,Disappointed,"Having booked hotel on recommendation we were looking forward to a well deserved relaxing break to mark our anniversary. First impression of hotel very good until we reached reception....children everywhere!  Staff were very friendly and our room was lovely. We got turn down service on first night but not on next two nights.  The next day the throw and day pillows were left on chair and night clothes on dressing table- not good from 5 star hotel.  The pool time for adults was restricted to early morning or evening with a 12-3 slot in afternoon-not very good if out sightseeing.  Food and service excellent in Hugo's restaurant. Breakfast buffet was very noisy and had to manoeuvre round many young children helping themselves to the buffet and carrying glasses. Maybe if we had gone at different time and not pre Easter it might have been less manic but whilst this is a lovely hotel in beautiful grounds with exceptionally nice staff, I would not recommend it for a quiet relaxing break.",3,2015,04,10
238,Simply superb. Luxury quality with an impeccable focus on families.,"What a superb location. The grounds and setting of this hotel are the first thing that strike you when you arrive and they are simply 'WOW!' Breathtaking. As a young family, I've often commented on how hard it is to find locations with luxury for adults combined with a family focus for kids. Druids Glen has both. The staff are simply superb, very attentive and the pinnacle of professionalism. Then there's the child friendly atmosphere. Families are made so welcome with a kids club, kids playground, specific 'kid friendly' pool times and a kitchenette with sterilizer, nappies, wipes etc. the food in the restaurants and at breakfast is fantastic, cannot be faulted. The rooms are spacious, climate controlled and really clean. Really easily found location just off the M50 from all directions, once you come off at the relevant junction, signs direct you all the way in. We have found our new retreat in Ireland and I don't think we'll venture anywhere else for some time when we need a break away. A brilliant place and I would highly recommend it!",5,2015,04,09
238,Luxury comes as standard. Great tasting food.,On arrival our luggage was whisked away to our room before checking in. Reception experience was faultless and very informative. Given a nice list of things to do in the area. Executive suite was massive and very comfortable. Some lovely touches including chocolates and open fire. Tried restaurant which was very tasty. Only observation was main course not piping hot but lukewarm. Didn't warrant a complaint though. Nice walks in local area. Highly recommended and will return.,5,2015,04,07
238,Wonderful family celebration,"We were a large group who stayed for the weekend and had a celebration party on the Saturday night. Everyone from 3 to 73 had a wonderful time. Every single member of staff that we encountered gave impeccable service and this, in addition to the comfort, cleanliness and stunning setting, was what really made the trip. Thank you so much Druids Glen. We would love to come back some day.",5,2015,04,06
238,Easter weekend,"Hotel is realy nice. Staff very very nice polite and helpfull. Nice food free wi-fi in room. But... Never expected to see so many kids in one place. There were more kids then adults. Screaming and shouting in corridors 9.30PM. Wrong weekend for couple :)

",4,2015,04,06
238,Excellent hotel with beautiful surroundings!,"This was the last of our 5 stops during our honeymoon. We had 2 nights there and it was spectacular. The hotel is very impressive looking when arriving and even more impressive inside. The lounge area is huge to accommodate anyone that wants to relax outside their room. The bar and restaurant on site had great drinks and food at good prices. The service was outstanding as well. My only constructive feedback was with the WiFi. It was very much needed to research and plan where to go and the service was tricky at times. It's pretty secluded, which is perfect for a getaway, but if you want to go explore you have to travel out a little. Overall a great stay would come back again!",4,2015,04,04
238,Another fantastic stay,"We stayed at this wonderful hotel for a second time and once again it was fantastic. From arriving when we were greeted very warmly by Stefan who was more than helpful and informative about their easter activities. Our room was once again perfect and the kids really enjoyed the kids club which allowed us to have a delicious meal in the bar with attentive staff and lovely atmosphere. I really couldn't fault this hotel, the staff all take care to ensure they do the utmost for you and always take time to say hello and offer help or assistance. I would thoroughly recommend this hotel for families as they really have the whole package. We will definitely be back ",5,2015,04,04
238,Relaxing break away..,"I have been meaning to write my review for so long, I visited back in November with my partner, we both work in the hotel industry to it was a well needed break away! It was honestly one of the best hotels i have been to, the staff are so friendly and the atmosphere is great. 
The Spa is beautiful!!! Michelle the spa manager could not have been any nicer or made our stay more perfect! joanne/joanna (i hope i have her name right) did my treatment i had the druids glen signiture & so did my partner, and she was by far one of the best therapists ive ever come across & I am a therapist myself. She is amazing at massage!! needless to say i slept very well that night..
So thank you ladies & every member of staff i came across as you really made our weekend special. I will hopefully be back soon! :)",5,2015,04,02
238,Great Family Break,"I booked this hotel as a base for myself and 2 children as we were visiting family in the area. Im really impressed and will be back again. 
When we arrived the consierge emptied the car of luggage and parked the car. Very quickly it was delivered to our room.
Rooms are Spacious, with all the usual items but thought it was cool that the kids were left their own small dressing gowns , and a DVD player in the room with a huge selection of dvds in reception. 
The bar has a nice atmosphere and serves gorgeous food. Breakfast again was good. 
On the ground floor there is a playroom for kids catering for a variety of ages , toddler up to teenagers with xbox, air hockey etc. 
The spa was nice and i had the option to sit in the jacuzzi and watch the kids swim or on a lounger around the pool.
The hotel is set in magnificent grounds with free bikes available to explore - however we were waiting for a less windy day. 
All in all a great stay but i have to say each member of staff has been fantastic and they go out of their way to ensure you are comfortable and nothing is a problem.",5,2015,04,01
238,Magnificent Cuisine,"Overnight stay with friends - very friendly staff with excellent service. As we spent the days sightseeing locally we didn't use the spa or pool but by far the highlight of the trip was our evening meal in Druids brasserie which was absolutely the best meal the 6 of us agreed we had eaten in a long long time.I had a monkfish starter with pork to follow, the presentation was superb and the different flavours in each dish was simply amazing. I cannot fault the meal in any way, it was mouth wateringly delicious with such a combination of complimentary ingredients. After dinner we whiled away the evening in the bar entertained by a very talented fiddler (one of the guests) Breakfast was also a very nice affair with continental and hot help yourself and a chef on hand for omelettes / other egg choices. Highly recommend",5,2015,03,30
238,Impressed,"Beautiful drive from the main road right up to the front door.  Welcome was very friendly, explained everything about the hotel, Porter took luggage to room and again very friendly.  Dinner was exceptional, Breakfast disappointing for a five star hotel in both choice and quality, service again friendly.  Room was excellent, comfortable, turndown service in the evening. Shower was fantastic.  Overall a very good stay.",4,2015,03,29
238,Not recommended for a Day Spa Break,"For my birthday I treated myself to a spa package at Druids Glen, which included lunch. Driving into the grounds the views are spectacular. These is no signage for The Spa when driving up to the hotel so I made my way into the reception of the hotel where I was informed The Spa was located on the 3rd floor.  After taking the lift and walking along a very long corridor I eventually came across The Spa.  The was nobody at the reception when I arrived and I had to wait about 8 minutes for someone to turn up. Check in was quick. I had some time before my first treatment and enquired about using the facilities beforehand. In other Spa's I have visited if it was my first visit I have been shown around the facilities.  Here I was just told the pool was out the door and down the stairs and the changing rooms across the way. 
I headed 'across the way' to the changing room, which was a very poor excuse for a changing room. It was more like a toilet that had been refitted with a few lockers. There was no seating area. No shower area. Just a sink, a few lockers and a toilet. There was really only room for one person to be in the room at a time. 
I had a facial, a massage and a body scrub. They were absolutely lovely. My therapist was very professional. I just found it unusual that they were done one after another, with no break in between. What I had thought would be a full morning spent at the spa, popping into the sauna, or pool in between treatments, which is what I'm used to from other spas. Here they were jammed back to back with no break in between and my morning at the spa was over in a few hours!
When I finished my treatments and enquired at reception about where I could have a shower I was informed I had to go back downstairs to the pool area and use the showers there. So off I go down to the pool area only to arrive down when the local Aqua aerobics class had finished so I had to wait and queue up for a shower, not a very relaxing experience. Then after showering I had to go back upstairs to the spa locker room to change!
I was given my voucher for lunch by the Spa Receptionist which is for the Pavillion Lounge. The view from the lounge is spectacular. Unfortuantly the food is not. The spa lunch voucher only entitles you to order off a limited menu, which is quite limited: soup, sandwiches, Caesar salad, fish cakes, of afternoon tea for an additional fee.  I ordered the fish cakes, I received two tiny cakes which would be more aptly described as potato cakes as you had to look VERY hard to find the piece of fish in the cake!
It seems to me The Spa was an afterthought for Druids Glen.  It's definitely not their speciality. When hotels like Carton House, and even Johnstown House Hotel do The Spa much better, with simple things like a separate entrance, dedicated changing rooms and showers, tea and coffee making facilities, it's amazing how much these little touches make your visit much more relaxing and enjoyable. Sorry Druids Glen I won't be back and I won't be recommending you.",2,2015,03,27
238,Wedding Review,"Hi, 

We got married in Druids Glen on the 1st of August 2014. The staff in the hotel could not have been more helpful from the day we first visited when making our choice of venue to the day of the wedding and the following morning. The chef at the tasting took all our comments on board to ensure the meal the day of the wedding was perfect for us and we had compliments all evening long and for weeks after from guests about the food, the staff and the overall venue. 

We could not recommend this hotel enough as a wedding venue, they helped with every detail and ensure the day was stress free from start to finish. All the small touches really made the day so special for us and the staff were so attentive to our need every step of the way. 

The rooms in the hotel and the bridal suite are also magnificent and the breakfast the following morning was the same high standard food as the wedding. We also had a BBQ the next day in the club house and the staff in the hotel (especially the concierge) were extremely helpful in helping us organise transport to the club house and to ensure all our guests were able to find their way there and back. 

We cannot thank Nessa enough for her hard work and attention to detail. She was so quick to respond to our every email, phone call and request before the day. She made sure the day ran smoothly and even had little surprises for us on the day to ensure it really was the most special day of our lives. 

Thank you so much to the staff in this hotel and you can be sure we will be back to visit again soon.

238,Gorgeous hotel - but more for golfers than spa lovers ,"Just back from Druids Glen after a two night stay with my parents, boyfriend, and siblings & their partners for my Dad's 60th.  My parents love this hotel and have been before so my dad wanted us all to go to celebrate his birthday. All in all, we had a fabulous stay. The most impressive thing for me about the hotel was the staff, and the food in Hugo's.  Everyone we dealt with, from start to finish, was excellent. Particularly the man on the door (I think his name was Tadhg) who was just lovely and made us laugh with all his wee stories and jokes.  The food in Hugo's was stunning - attention to detail and service were second to none.  All of us were extremely impressed with our meals.  Rooms were lovely, peaceful and the beds were fab, and the bar and reception are were also nice to sit in and we were always able to get a table and relax by the fire.  

The main downside for me, as someone who loves a good spa break, was that the health club part of the hotel felt a little more public pool than 5 star health spa.  I have probably been spoilt by some of the gorgeous hotels I've stayed in closer to home (Galgorm in particular with the outdoor hot tub at the river) and whilst the pool is a decent size, I think it's more a spa that you would go to for a quick swim and a sauna than one I'd want to relax in all day.  I get that the hotel wants to appeal to families but the background noise of screaming kids doesn't appeal to me on a spa break (child free from 12-3 and early Am/post 7pm) and none of the child free swim times suited our group. There are also a limited number of loungers and it just didn't have the feeling that some of the other spas I have stayed in have, where you could spend all day in it.  Can't comment on treatments as it was too busy for us to get booked in, which is always a good sign!! Also, I find having to wear a swimming cap slightly ridiculous.  I'm sure it's sold on hygiene reasons but they are so tiny, everyone's hair is hanging out the bottom anyway and it's another bit that just took away from the feeling of it being a spa, and added to the public pool feeling.  My parents and brother love golf and I think they were very impressed by this aspect of Druids Glen.  If we were to book a family trip again, I'd definitely return as this place suited everyone's needs however for my boyfriend and I, we'd generally chose a more spa focused hotel which has longer child free hours (or is just child free all together).  For a golf break or if you have kids and aren't looking for the spa to be the main focus of the trip, I think this is a fantastic hotel.  Also very well located for exploring Co Wicklow and the grounds are beautiful to walk around.  ",4,2015,03,24
238,Definetly will return,"We stayed at this hotel during the October mid term break for a 3 night stay with 3 of our children.  When we booked we requested interconnecting rooms.  On arrival we were greeted a very friendly doorman who  helped get us checked in and settled in our rooms.  They were ideally located on the second floor not too far from reception.
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, the rooms were large, comfortable and quite.
We ate in the restaurant on two of the nights and the bar on the last night.  The restaurant food was superb,  presentation was excellent, flavours and  food combination really showcased a chef who understood good food.  The bar food in much simpler, but equally excellent and we enjoyed sitting in the comfy sofas in the Pavilion.  
We used the leisure center everyday which was perfect and very clean.  The kids loved the chipping green and driving range, and we did some of the walks around the resort.
The overall winner for me in this hotel were the staff, everyone of them were friendly, courteous, and helpful.  They could not do enough for us and made you feel so welcome and respected.  I would highly recommend this hotel for a short break, and can't wait to return with all the family.",5,2015,03,24
238,SUPERB PLACE TO STAY,Stayed Friday to Sunday for my husbands birthday. Service from staff was faultless from the minute we entered until we left. Will definitely be making a return visit very soon. The staff and hotel accommodation excellent. Thank you for a very enjoyable stay,5,2015,03,22
238,Under the spell for our entire stay!,"We have just spent the weekend in the impeccable Druids Glen Resort and it was an experience we won't forget anytime soon!Hot towels upon arrival to freshen up we're a delight and the day porter/doorman had an extremely warm welcome as he took our bags.The entire staff were top class,Caroline at breakfast had a warm smile and a greeting each morning.Special mention must go to our waiter Ali (a Druids Glen staff member for the last four years) who spoiled us for our evening meal in the restaurant,even singing me a happy 18th birthday with a birthday dessert plate!The entire meal was delicious and my fillet of Beef was cooked to perfection.The breakfast buffet the following morning was mouth watering,the highlight being an omelette and pancake station.Unfortunately for us,the hotels Spa was fully booked for the weekend of our stay (a clear sign of how popular it is)but we weren't disappointed for long as the leisure centre facilities were excellent,(Just hop in the plunge pool,don't think about it!!)Our room was beautiful and spacious with many little touches that made our stay extra special,bottled water on arrival,chocolates at turn down time,a leaflet each morning with a weather report for the day and things to do in the area and the comfiest bed I have ever slept in!.The bar staff were friendly and the cocktails were delicious.(Try the Druids spell)!With great live music on both nights of our stay there really is nothing to complain about!To be completely honest,I want to come back next weekend!A fantastic hotel with great staff,décor and food,well done to every staff member :)",5,2015,03,22
238,Superb,"Visited in February 2015.
Great experience..
Staff superb - nothing was too much for them.
Daughters aged 7 and 3 really enjoyed it, but the bar food was what really made it memorable for them. The kids menu was great and the staff made children feel really important..
Meals in the restaurant were also excellent, and the desserts were 'to die for'",5,2015,03,20
238,Top class - would highly recommend - will return - super response by staff to 'minor problem',"Spent three great days in Druidsglen - beautiful suite - great food and great atmosphere in the bar. On returning from a drive into Dublin - couldn't enter room - twice went to reception to have card 'reprogrammed' but to no avail. At the third time of asking we met Recep Pamukcu (Director of Food & Beverage) who diagnosed problem and directed us to foyer for complimentary coffee while lock was repaired.....foyer was busy at the time as a wedding party had just arrived....no coffee.....no big problem!
Five minutes after getting back into room a complimentary bottle of chilled white wine was delivered to the room with an apology for inconvenience caused!!
This gesture is typical of the service we enjoyed for all our stay!! Well done and thanks to Recep and all his team! We will be back!",5,2015,03,19
238,Loved the whole experience!!,"Had a spa day today, absolutely loved it!! Best back massage ever and facial!! Even got feedback from my beautician!! The smell of the products was unreal!! Then we popped down to the restaurant for some lunch!! Lovely girl waiting on us,  couldn't of been more helpful!! Absolutely beautiful experience!!",5,2015,03,19
238,Nothing special,It was a break but nothing special not what I would deem 5 star to be perhaps 5 star prices but service while always pleasant was at times very slow. Breakfast was good but again a time delay waiting for tea and coffee. Good gluten free choice which I think is important.,3,2015,03,17
238,Fabulous!!,"Gorgeous room, staff were so friendly - could not do enough and the food in the restaurant was to die for!! I was also treated to a lovely spa package with a facial the beautician really knew her stuff and my skin has completely cleared up after I had attended mulptile salons amount the problem!

Highly recommended!!!",5,2015,03,17
238,The best hotel to stay in with children,"
From the moment we arrived we were made feel very welcome in the hotel. We were given a gift of an activity book for our daughter and an information sheet about their facilities and services for children. Our room was very spacious with a king bed (as requested) and had a fridge which was useful for baby food, although there is also a room with steriliser, microwave etc on the 2nd floor. They also have a kids club in the evenings for children over 3. The bar does not take bookings for dinner and as the day we arrived was Mother's Day it was extremely busy, yet the staff dealt with this very well and found us a table very quickly. The food was really well presented and tasty (probably a lot better the first night) and service was great and it seemed like nothing was too much trouble. Desserts though were quite disappointing and overpriced at €8.50 each! Breakfast is served until 11 in the restaurant. There was an excellent choice of fresh fruit, pastries, breads, meats, sausages, bacon etc but also an Omlette/ Pancake chef whose station was really popular. Again the staff were very helpful and friendly, immediately offering the high chair for the baby and taking the table part away to be washed for her. The pool area is very clean and there's also family changing rooms and set times when children may use the pool. Pretty much everyone we saw had children and II would highly recommend this hotel to any family who wants to stay in a comfortable modern hotel. ",5,2015,03,17
238,Not a five star for me,"Booked Druids for two nights as a birthday treat for my mum. We would usually stay in Powerscourt but thought the change might be nice however there was no comparison and I'm wishing we had stuck with what we knew.
So the good points first - the staff were friendly, the room was large and clean, there was ample parking and the hallways and corridors were bright and spacious. Unfortunately for me it went rapidly down hill. Before going I emailed to asked if I should book dinner as it was Mothers Day I was told there was no need as the restaurant was large but it might be worth booking the spa. 
On arrival I checked in and was asked if I wanted to book a table for dinner for either night as the restaurant was 'very busy' so despite being told there was no need I then made a reservation. 
On entering the room it was nice and the furniture etc was in good order however there was a crying child in the room next door who cried almost solidly for the duration of my stay. This was compounded by the children screaming and crying in the room across the corridor and then to really make my stay the many parents used the corridors of the hotel to walk their crying children in prams throughout the day and night to try and pacify them. The children overall blighted my stay the noise at breakfast and dinner was shocking with even the staff suggesting 'a table somewhere a little quieter'
On the second evening I went down for a meal at the time of my reservation after waiting to be seated but there was no record of my reservation, after much delay I was offered a table which felt like a favour! The menu was limited and unfortunately there was nothing my mum liked so the waiter suggested we could try the bar.
When I looked online I thought there was a bigger range of places to eat however the Pavilion and 13th bar are essentially the same place as they lead into each other. 
The food was definitely bar food with a basic menu and we were seated on a wobbly table which was actually too small to hold the plates when they eventually arrived. Despite ordering a burger and fish it took over an hour to come and other people were served before us who arrived after. There was a lot of staff on but it felt like organised chaos with waiters lifting tables and chairs over peoples heads and repeatedly taking the wrong food to the wrong tables. All of this despite the fact that there should have been no problems coping with the number of dinners given the amount of staff.
On both days breakfast was loud with children crying, shouting, banging cutlery off the tables etc. Food was fine, not a huge variety but enough to suffice with a chef making omelettes, a basic cooked breakfast and a small selection of fruit, cereals and breads. For a five star the variety and quality was somewhat lacking.
As a number of other people have alluded to this hotel is at best a four star. It is a nice setting with friendly staff but the extra touches you expect from a five star was definitely not there. Moreover the hotel is catering for children with the hotel organising activities etc so this is not a hotel I would recommend for anyone wanting a quiet, relaxing, spa break. Whilst children will cry the sheer number of them made my stay feel like a few nights in a holiday camp with breakfast and meals feeling like a school canteen.
Hotel has lots of potential but definitely not for me.",2,2015,03,16
238,Had a great time but expected more!,"I really enjoyed my stay at Druids Glen, the reception area was beautiful the staff were very friendly. I recently stayed at a four star hotel and found the room there more impressive than druids glen, at a five star hotel I would have expected a luxurious bathroom and bath, while there was nothing wrong with the room it wasn't 'five star' The view from our hotel room wasn't too great either we were overlooking the other side of the hotel at other guests windows I would have expected a decent view at a 5 star resort. We visited the pool which was jam-packed and didn't feel relaxed at all here! The breakfast the following morning was gorgeous they had everything you could possibly want but the restaurant itself had limited choice on the menu and overpriced! I would definitely return to this hotel but I would give it 4 stars rather then 5. We had a great stay here!",4,2015,03,16
238,You need to see it to believe it.,"Great,easy drive from Bangor Co Down, through Dublin, Bray, Greystones, Kilcoole and into Druids Glen Resort. Magnificent views all the way, especially through the Wicklow Hills and Sugar Loaf. Arrived after 4pm and taken to our spacious room overlooking the golf course and country walks.Left two days later with some fantastic memories.",4,2015,03,16
238,All in all a four start hotel at five star prices.,"Those who travel widely will know the difference between 4 and 5 start hotels. Despite what the awards claim Druids is 4 star. Dining area feels like a typical 'airport' hotel. Crowded and little space between tables. Breakfast was poor. Sausages had a very high bread content, black and white puddings were undercooked as were the pancakes. Croissants and pain au chocolate were excellent though. Gym is very small and feels crammed with too much equipment. Changing rooms although very clean are small and poorly designed for changing. Accommodation rates are reasonable for a four start hotel but you'll find the cost of food and beverages are at five start prices.",3,2015,03,15
238,"Nice Rooms, Great Staff it's a shame the food didn't match","The staff at this hotel are great. Very friendly and helpful at all times. The rooms are a great size and the bed comfortable etc. There is a nice enough jogging/walking trail outside. We eat in the thirteenth and to be honest we didn't much of the steak and were a bit disappointed. Overall I would rate this hotel as a 4 star plus hotel. There was a lot of families staying there and the pool understandably was full of children so we didn't get to use it. The thirteenth bar was full because of a rugby match so we ended up watching it in the golfers bar. Breakfast was tasty and there was a wide selection. Despite how nice I found the room and staff I'm unsure if I would recommend people to go there even though it was a lovely experience, if the food was up to scratch I probably would though. I can't say that this is good for a romantic get away but perhaps a family trip as the place was full of them.",4,2015,03,15
238,As good as ever!!!,"This was myself and my husband's fourth stay at Druids Glen and on this occasion we were with two other couples.  Yet again we had a fabulous stay.  Everything was wonderful, right from the warm and friendly welcome on arrival, right through to the minute we left. The staff are amazing and you feel genuinely welcome.  Duncan, the Guest Relations Manager, is an excellent ambassador for the hotel and was brilliant when I was booking for everyone, and he organised a tour of Wicklow for us with the Hotel Chauffeur Lenny - which was very entertaining!  The rooms are beautiful and spacious, with lovely views over the golf course or mountains, and the food is great.  What more can you ask for!",5,2015,03,14
238,Top Class Hotel,I have just returned from a wonderful stay at Druids Glen. The only unfortunate thing is that we couldn't stay longer. From the very friendly staff throughout the entire hotel to the truly magnificent breakfast we overall had an amazing experience. We cannot wait to return. See you in the Summer. 😊,5,2015,03,14
238,Lisa mooney,So impressed with our stay. Staff are so friendly edel and adrainne on the front desk were so helpful. The room was very spacious we were spolied throughout our stay. Games room was great for children.  Dinner in the 13th was absolutely delicious.  Would highly recommend the hotel. Will b back. ,5,2015,03,13
238,Beautiful Wicklow,"Druids Glen Hotel is listed as 5 star. It is a lovely building in a nice quiet location, room was nice and bar meals were good. However, since this hotel is no longer part of the Marriott Group, it seems to have lost some of its sense of style. The cooked breakfast was poor and the service at breakfast was terrible. We had to ask for service and move tables to get noticed. The pool area is ok, but there were 4 poor looking loungers at the pool side which carried no style whatsoever.  Overall I think I would rate this Hotel as 4star plus. I do like the Hotel and would go back. However, they need to polish up on service in restaurant. The sun room area was busy when we arrived on a Sunday as a rugby match was on TV. Due to this, the girls on duty were not coping with all tables being used. We had to seek attention to have a food and drinks order taken. This was not 5 star service. I must add during our stay the barmen were more than attentive and helpful. Since our last stay a few years ago, things have slipped a bit.",4,2015,03,11
238,Great for kids,"Stayed two nights with family 6 adults 5 kids aged 1-5. Can't fault the place. Nice pool area. Ate in the bar both nights, staff were really helpful and good selection of food. Really good playroom with plenty to do for kids of all ages, outdoor playground also. Despite the amount of kids there was a really relaxed atmosphere throughout the hotel thanks to the great staff. Would recommend and hopefully will return soon!",4,2015,03,08
238,Great Hotel,"We called in for dinner last week on way home ,the staff are very friendly as usual ,the hotel is always spotless ,we find the hotel and grounds very relaxing, It is set in a beautiful area just outside the village of Kilcoole.",5,2015,03,07
238,Love this hote.,From the front door all the way throughout this lovely hotel the staff are so very helpful and friendly. Wonderful food served with a smile. Lovely comfortable rooms with great golf course views. 2 Great golf courses. All in all a wonderful experience.,5,2015,03,03
238,Top Class,"I stayed at this hotel on a package with a groups of friends. We were super impressed with the hotel. The service, food and room were fabulous. The only downside was our spa experience. Some of the staff there lacked the warmth of the staff in the hotel itself. I would definitely go back but would give the spa a miss.",5,2015,03,03
238,total treat for all the family,"Just home from two night stay with my husband and 2 kids age 8 and 5, we had a ball. Checked in on Thursday with a very friendly Jo, fast and friendly told us all we needed to know. Our room was on first floor, great for access to kids den. Rooms were big, clean and airy great views of golf course. Kids den well maintained and well equipped something for all ages. Food was second to none fresh and plentyfull at dinner. Breakfast was super every taste catered for paleo, vegan gluten free etc and supply plentiful,  my only down side would be the chef with the many pans doing eggs fried, scrambled, pancakes etc to slow, better done in batches. Kids club which is new was super we had delicious meal in restaurant while kids were entertained and fed between 5 and 9 pm. Leisure centre is well maintaned and the kids loved the pool, changing rooms warm and clean. Overall a fantastic experience,  we were sorry to leave and will definitely be back . Well done to all involved in the running of this hotel no corner is cut and every angle is covered. Staff were very friendly and kids were very welcome x",5,2015,02,28
238,Wished we stayed another night!,"Druids Glen is a great getaway location, just a short drive from Dublin. With beautiful scenery all around, it's setting is truly special. I felt the exterior of the building lacked a certain charm but that's a personal thing.

Check in was really efficient & friendly with a porter on hand.  Our room was beautiful, cosy but luxurious and the bathroom was huge with deluxe toiletries.

We ate in the restaurant which again had a lovely feel. The food had positives & negatives: the starters were disappointing, both of our choices lacking flavour.  My husband had steak which he said was perfect and I had the pork and while it was delicious, the portion didn't satisfy my hunger.  Dessert was superb.  Breakfast was flawless & I felt the recipe cards for their Guinness bread was a lovely touch.

My husband availed of the driving range and he said the manager was excellent!

The pool, sauna etc we're nice but I've used better.

Checkout again was really friendly with a special mention deserved for the ""Donegal"" receptionist & greeter.",4,2015,02,28
238,Grew on me,"Came here for half term with the kids. First impressions were a bit disappointing- the buildings are a bit modern and charmless and it was annoying to be told at 345 that our room still wasn't ready and we should go and have a drink.

Lots of positives came through by the end though - great interconnecting rooms - spacious, comfy beds, DVD players for the kids. Also good breakfast, great bar food, lovely kids club, nice babysitters and fantastic massages in the spa. Kids playroom and playground were nice too.

Not many negatives - pool was a bit busy/changing rooms poor and decor overall is a bit basic/old fashioned.

Overall though good visit and would return.",4,2015,02,26
238,Real get away place,"We went there for a wedding anniversary and we did not regret it at all. It's what you'd call a real get away place. Away from town, in a secluded location, warm and comfy, where you can switch off your mobile, forget all your troubles and just enjoy it. And they have it all (or most of it) to help you. The hotel is pleasantly designed. The rooms are big, clean and comfortable. There is a bunch of facilities that you can use like pool and sauna and all that, with extra touches here and there to make it that little bit more special. You are well looked after by the staff. Starting from the hearty welcome at the reception and until the final good bye, you feel the friendliness and welcome everywhere you go. It's also good that despite all the stars it's not too posh, so you don't feel like you don't belong there unless you have royal blood or something. The only disappointment was that you are not allowed to walk on the hotel grounds as it's for golfers only. The only options is to follow the path around the fence, so to speak. But that's no match to the lovely photos they have on their website.",4,2015,02,26
238,Excellent,"I stayed here last Monday night. Check in was very quick and Stefan explained everything to us in great detail. Our meal was amazing. We both had the soup, steak & chocolate dessert! The service was second to none. The leisure centre is very relaxing, especially the aromatherapy steam room.The rooms were luxurious. The DVD player & fridge are a great touch which most hotels lack these days. I hope to return.",5,2015,02,25
238,Very nice hotel with great staff,Recently stayed at Druids Glen with my wife. Lovely hotel with great staff. The staff were extremely friendly and relaxed and this made our stay very enjoyable. The food was excellent and the room very spacious and perfectly clean. Lots of kids though so don't expect a quiet pool!! Will be bringing ours with us next time.,5,2015,02,25
238,excellent weekend!,We stayed here last weekend and were so impressed with the hotel overall. The staff couldn't have done more for us and were so welcoming and friendly throughout our stay!! Steffan on the front desk was a gentleman and the dinner served in the restaurant was top class!! Would definetly love to return soon!!,5,2015,02,25
238,"Amazing, amazing, amazing!","This hotel is just fantastic - we booked a three night stay over half term with our two kids, aged 8 and 5, and we were all treated like royalty. I have stayed in too many 5* hotels that see children as a major inconvenience but not Druids Glen - here they are treated just like VIPs, from the special steps at reception so they can be involved in check-in, to the popcorn given out with DVDs so you can enjoy your own in-room movie nights, to the kid friendly times in the swimming pool.

Room are beautifully furnished with a very comfortable, homely feel and everything you need. The breakfast is buffet style with an amazing array of food (the only thing missing for me was hash browns, but there was plenty of everything else), and we ate in both the restaurant and the bar, plus had room service - everything I ate was wonderfully cooked and delicious - the Seafood Chowder is to die for!  Kian, one of the waiters in the restaurant was particularly friendly and helpful.

My one piece of advice to other guests is to bring your own swimming hat if you plan to use the pool - you have to have one and if you don't you can buy them for €3 each but if you've got tons at home (like we have) then easier to pack them.

We cannot wait to return!",5,2015,02,22
238,A fantastic stay,"We stayed with our two children age 7 and 8 and I couldn't rate our stay high enough. From Shelley in reservations who was so helpful to the reception staff when we arrived in fact all the staff can't do enough. Check in was seamless with the children getting welcome packs and a lovely feature of mini steps up the the reception desk so they could see. The kids high tea club is fab allowing us to eat in the bar and enjoy a little peace!!! We stayed in a family room on the second floor. Perfect as it was close to the pool. The room was spacious and clean and breakfast was delicious with plenty of choice. I really couldn't fault this place, it's very family friendly and we will definitely be back. ",5,2015,02,21
238,"Lovely weekend, pity we were ripped off in the end.","We booked a weekend including golf in Druids Glen for my dad's 60th. The golf course was fantastic, probably my favourite in Ireland.

We then went back to the hotel to be greeted by fantastic staff, they even left a card and chocolates in the room for dad when they heard it was his 60th, a lovely touch.

We had a nice dinner in the restaurant, the pork for main course was fantastic and our waiter Luic was first class, his recommendations for both food and wine were spot on. Breakfast the next morning was also really really good.

Now for the bad part. The previous day when we played golf, we asked in the pro shop how much a fourball would be. We were told that as it was a quiet day, €120.  We had already bought a Groupon which included the room, a €10 dining credit and €20 golf credit. As we were checking out there was an extra charge of €200 for golf. We argued that it was only €120 to play, but she said that ""our rate"" was €50 each. She then amended the bill to deduct the €20 golf credit, which brought it down to €120. Therefore the golf credit was worthless, just added to the final bill.

Unfortunately after a wonderful weekend, this put a bitter taste in my mouth. Between golf, accommodation and dinner for 4, including 2 bottles of wine, we had spent over €700, not even including drinks from the bar. And to be told that we had ""misunderstood"" the golf credit was insulting. Unfortunately in this case we were mislead and that was a shame.

Would I go back?? Certainly.... But just for the golf.",2,2015,02,19
238,What a boring place,"Golf-players may like the location in the middle of a golf course, but this is one of the most boring places I have stayed for a long time. Apart from some stone walls in the reception area there is absolutely no style or charme. Could be in Spain, somewhere in Spain, in China.

Service at reception is fine, and breakfast is ok. Dinner was as boring as the hotel, and service (in a quite big group) was slow - understaffed and/or unprofessional. The steak was not as ordered, neither first nor second time. And was absolutely tasteless.

Room was big and with ok basic quality, but again without any charm (or view). And how can a five star hotel not have a minibar?",2,2015,02,18
238,"A Fantastic Weekend Away, Can't Praise Enough",Took my partner away for a Valentine weekend. From arriving on Friday evening to leaving on Sunday afternoon we were both treated to superb service from every member of staff at the Druids Glen. Everything about the hotel & spa is 1st class. The food (both breakfast & dinner) was excellent. The time spend in the spa was very relaxing & the massage enjoyed on the Sunday afternoon was a perfect end to the weekend. Would highly recommend anybody looking a relaxing break to choice this wonderful hotel.,5,2015,02,16
238,Perfect family friendly resort,This was perfect for our first trip away as a family. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful during our stay. We were able to take our baby daughter with us to dinner in her pram and enjoy a meal both in the restaurant and the bar without bothering anyone. Breakfast was great during our stay and the staff were really friendly. Unfortunately we weren't able to use the spa or swimming pool as our daughter wasn't well but we would definitely consider staying here again when we are next in Wicklow. ,5,2015,02,15
238,Lovely hotel but bar food a disgrace,"We popped in for some lunch on Valentines day. Having previously stayed at the hotel and eaten in the main restaurant we thought the bar would be up to standard but were we oh so disappointed. The pork belly did not even taste like pork, i genuinely felt ill all day afterwards. The service was extremely slow and we walked out feeling completely ripped off, we certainly will not be back",3,2015,02,15
238,A real breakaway  from it all... Bliss,Myself and my husband stayed here last weekend. We were so impressed  with the staff a d service here.  Excellent facilities.... Beautiful  rooms.  We will defo stay again. Thank you to everyone  who made our stay so memorable. Slightly  pricey but worth the money. ,5,2015,02,15
238,"Beautiful rooms, lovely spa, brilliant staff!","Stayed here with three of my friends, We loved the spa and the rooms were beautiful! The atmosphere of the hotel was reallt relaxing and warm. We had bar food the night we stayed and all 4 of us were happy with it. Without doubt though, the best thing about this hotel was the very friendly staff from check-in, spa to bar staff everyone was so friendly! I must make a special mention to Teague (congierge, I think) who not only was the first welcoming face we met when we entered the hotel, but who was much more than helpful when I had some car trouble after check out the following day. Great stay, great staff! ",4,2015,02,14
238,Fantastic family break,"We stayed here recently based on the recommendation of friends, it certainly didn't disappoint. The hotel facilities are particularly ideal for those with kids, lots for them to do including the swimming pool, the playground outside and the indoor play area known as Druids Den. There was a separate room that had a microwave, bottle sterilisers, bottle warmers etc but we didn't use this. The hotel staff could not be faulted, they were fantastic throughout our stay. Add to this free wifi throughout. We will definitely return again.",5,2015,02,11
238,Seeking a quiet family weekend away,"I checked in to Druids Glen resort early evening on a Friday recently.  Check in was smooth and quick. In tow was my seven year old daughter and partner. The busy bar meant no seating was available to feed these three hungry travellers, just finished a long working week. We sat in the foyer by a lovely open fire which eased the wait but not the hunger pangs. I couldn't fault the staff over the weekend. Extremely friendly. The food was really nice too except for the toasted sandwich I got from room service ..that was disappointing. And expensive.
I left my Ipad charger there and when I got home I simply rang Jo on reception who located it straightaway and posted it on to me. She was on top of it! 
I will definitely be back once the weather improves to spend more time outside the hotel but yes, I'll be back. The pool was a bit full on the Saturday and Sunday mornings with lessons and a swimmers lane taking up half the pool...this left parents and children very little space.

238,Christmas season,"We were there for Christmas and it was a great experience. The room wasn't as large as in other 5 star hotels we've been to, but it was very comfortable and quiet. The hotel was all beautifully decorated for Christmas and the meals were lovely, you could really feel the Christmas atmosphere, although they could use more music, especially during the meals. The spa was gorgeous, and there was also a pool area with Jacuzzi which we enjoyed very much. We would definitely recommend Druids Glen as a good option for Christmas without being absurdly expensive. Golf players would also enjoy it.",5,2015,02,09
238,Missing property from room!!,"Please watch your belongings as I mistakenly left my new suede boots behind. I had literally checked out when realized and rang hotel to check our room and guess what? Gone!! I'm so disappointed as they where an expensive Xmas gift from my Husband. I would have expected more from a five star establishment. There is no other explanation only that they had be stolen by someone with access to our room.
No compensation offered. Would not recommend this Hotel.
....and to the person wearing my boots I have lots of verrucas LOL",2,2015,02,09
238,Wonderful Stay,"We have stayed many times in this hotel. Our most recent stay last week was by far the best. We were greeted so professionally and accommodating by both the receptionist and the doorman and this was a great start to our evening.
We stayed in a suite on the second floor overlooking the golf course. The room has been very tastefully refurbished. It is such a lovely idea to have a fireplace in the suites. We actually enjoy just sitting in front of the fire with a glass of wine before dinner.
The evening meal is not and never has been terrific, however the staff make every effort to make the meal very enjoyable. I am sure a little more attention to flavour and portion sizes would really make the meal so much more memorable.
The layout for breakfast has changed and looks very impressive. The selection of food is very good. Again the staff at breakfast were extremely polite and friendly.
After breakfast we ventured out on the sitting deck in front of the restaurant. It was actually very nicely improved as many of the tress had been felled which allows a much better view of the golf course. 
And a special mention to Duncan who for all our visits has been most accommodating...we did miss him when he was on his sabbatical.

We will certainly be back soon.",5,2015,02,09
238,Best hotel experience I've had in a long while,"My wife and I went for a weekend at start of February and had a fabulous time. At check-in we had hot towels while Stefan explained everything. our room was lovely, spacious, with 2 comfortable armchairs and 40inch flat-screen T.V. Staff throughout were excellent - very friendly and helpful - couldn't do enough to ensure we were happy. Food in bar and restaurant was excellent (Darren was great in the bar). Had great dessert in bar on Friday night, and asked in the restaurant on Sat night for the same even though it was not on menu - no problem! Spa facilities were great - my wife had a treatment which she said was great. Our sink was not draining and we reported it on Saturday morning - within 5 mins maintenance arrived and fixed it. My wife asked for cocktail not on the menu - again no problem. Breakfasts were very well catered with a chef cooking fresh omelettes and pancakes. We asked for soft boiled eggs on Sun and they arrived within 10 minutes - perfect! I honestly could not find any fault with our experience this weekend and I am planning to return.",5,2015,02,09
238,Lovely relaxing stay with family,"We had a family stay here at the end of January with our two kids 10 & 8. On arrival we were greeted by a very friendly concierge who welcomed us to the hotel took our bags and then offered to park the car! Great start. Once inside, check- in was flawless, we were offered hot towels to freshen up and the kids got colouring packs and water. Our room was on the second floor and was overlooking the 13th tee box on the golf course, the view was lovely! The room was very spacious with two queen sized beds, flat screen TV & DVD player, good size bathroom with separate shower.
We ate in the bar both at lunch and in the evening, the food was very nice and the staff very efficient and friendly. The breakfast was brilliant and one of the best I have ever had in hotels that I've stayed in before. They had a chef cooking omelette and pancakes to order and a great selection of hot buffet, fresh fruits, breads and cereals etc.
The swimming pool was very nice and quite warm, but if you had very young children there is no shallow end for them to play about in. Our two kids could touch the bottom so it wasnt an issue for us but it might be for others. It also has a big jacuzzi and steam & sauna rooms. The changing room is quite small and although it wasnt busy when we where there it could be in summer or at other holiday times. We walked round the golf course on the Sat and the views were super and the course looked lovely. I'm a golfer so I would hope to return sometime for a golfing stay! The kids tried out the bikes, and loved them. You are not able to cycle round the golf course paths but there is an area you can walk & cycle were there are residential houses being built. Outdoor play area is well equipped with swings, slides and climbing frames for smaller ones. The indoor games room had an xbox, chalkboards and a number of games to keep the kids amused. A great thing for kids is the DVD service, my pair asked at receptioin if they could have a DVD to be greeted by a trolley full of them to pick from and popcorn and water! Result 😀  
All the staff we had contact with were very friendly and nothing was a problem to them. Service with a smile and a bit of chat!
We had a lovely stay and I would recommend this hotel without a doubt. If you book, you will not regret it and if you dont enjoy your stay it's your own fault! Definately a 5 star stay.",5,2015,02,08
238,Three nights at Druids Glen Resort,"Reception staff very welcoming, Barry checked us in telling me to bring the car to the front door so that he could take our bags out and then he would park the car. He explained where everything was situated within the hotel and then took us to our room. A beautiful suite overlooking the golf course. We eat in the Brassiere one night and the 13th  Bar on two nights. The food was excellent in both places although a little slow in coming. The staff in all areas were very friendly, helpful and nothing was too much trouble. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will certainly be back.",5,2015,02,08
238,Great Christmas lunch ,"Went for a family Christmas lunch this year.  The hotel was very festive and lunch was buffet style,  with a huge selection of starters, main courses and desserts.  You were free to sample as much food as you like and it was delicious,  especially the sticky toffee creme brulee. 
There were a lot of family and friends groups of various sizes,  and it was great to all get dressed up and not having just one person having to do all the cooking or washing up.  Only regret was not booking a room to stay Christmas night   but we might do that next year and be able to chill for the rest of the day. ",5,2015,02,06
238,Excellent family hotel,"First visit to Druids Glen, but not the last.  Family break with our 18 month old son, and as mentioned in other reviews, the staff are excellent.  We were checked in by Barry on the front desk, who couldn't have been more welcoming, and made a special effort with the child, including a small present.  Only a token gesture, but its the extras that make the difference.

The facilities, especially for the kids are excellent.  An indoor play room kept my toddler entertained, and there is a foosball table, air hockey and xbox for the older kids.  A small outdoor playground also, with slides, swings, climbing frame etc.  We ended up not using the pool area so can't comment on that.

Plenty to do in the surrounding area, and the place is well signposted from the main road.

We only ate in the bar area. The food was good, but lacked a wow factor.  My only complaint was we ordered the ""bowl of chicken soup"" from the children's menu, and it came in nothing larger than a ramekin.  Trying to explain the concept of an amuse bouche to an 18 month old was quite a challenge.

Will definitely return.  The staff are excellent throughout the hotel and do make the extra effort.  Will take the clubs next time also, the course looked great!",5,2015,02,06
238,Perfect,"Six of us stayed here last weekend. Everything was perfect, except for one/two minor niggles which hotel has been advised of. Food very good and hot.  Housekeeping was good. Two staff members require recognition, the Concierge who greeted us upon arrival 30/01 pm, this gentleman set the tone for our visit and the French waiter who served us on Saturday night, whose knowledge of wine was most impressive, as witnessed by the perfect result. Lovely grounds to walk, location excellent for doing 'Wicklow'. Cannot reccommend enough and we shall be back.
Travellers Tip: I always book direct with hotel, as you will be well looked after, as regards room position, and here we had 3 perfect rooms.",5,2015,02,06
238,Amazing Staff,"This was our second visit to Druids Glen with our 10 month old baby. The staff are so efficient, professional and extremely friendly. Nothing was too much trouble. The facilities are fantastic. Rooms are lovely, spacious beautiful decor and very clean. Pool area is very nice and just the right temperature for the baby. We had room service one night and dined in the restaurant the following night. The food was delicious and very well presented. We will definitely return for a third visit the hotel is lovely but the main draw back is the staff. They can't do enough for you, they make the whole experience and are a credit to the hotel management. Particularly the reception staff. ",5,2015,02,05
238,Booked in for a 4th day on our 1st ,Druids glen try's very hard nothing is too much trouble from the golf pro to the bar staff etc the food is good how ever is not the highlight but the place has a lovely feel around it I had a golf lesson from the pro and he had to take me to a great course as the glen was closed it was closed for 3 days he phoned 3 or 4 times and I was delighted when I got back we went to the spa the staff were great work with us on times etc as I keeper changing  times the bar staff we chatted as you would expect from Irish bar men lol we went to Dublin got the train came back had no lift phone the hotel and we got a cab Druids glen try's very hard what it dose not know it will learn it want to please you give it ago you will have a great time I know I work in the trade and I will be back again and again ❤️,5,2015,02,04
238,Greatly improved,"We used to stay here a lot when visiting friends in Ireland but then it became very busy and a bit jaded and tatty. We returned this weekend and it has had a refurb to the restaurant and rooms and they are greatly improved. The staff have always been fab and continue to be so - really easy going but efficient and lovely with kids. The breakfast has also always been good and now is even better with a relaxed atmosphere, late serving (11.00) and lots of choice inlcuding a chef to make you an omelette or pancake of your choice. The pool is great although the policy of having to wear ridiculously small cloth swimming caps seems crazy and is almost enough to put you off bothering! The only slight blip is dinner (in the bar this time) which just doesn't quite hit the nail on the head - dry and a bit uninteresting really. The other problem is the size of the beds in the room we were in were small for two tall adults to share one bed whilst our son had the same size bed to himself! I'm not sure they do a kingsize room with a single in (we ended up asking for put me up which didn't go down well with said son) just to get a good night's sleep. Overall a lovely place to stay in a great part of ireland.",5,2015,02,03
238,The Thirteenth Bar,"Delicious lunch had in the thirteenth bar. Staff all super friendly. Lovely relaxed ambiance in the hotel and bar. Food was really good and plenty to choose from on the menu. Fantastic views overlooking the golf course, nice to relax while enjoying a latte !!",5,2015,02,03
238,Weekend away,"Myself & my husband had a weekend break here in January. The room was beautiful, very large & very well equipped. We ate in the bar on the first night, food was lovely & dinner in the restaurant on the second night, 3 course meal was fab & the waters were lovely. Breakfast buffet was huge but there was no baked beans, my husband asked one of the staff if he could get some & voilà they appeared a few minutes later! I must give a special mention to Leonard, the cab driver the hotel use, he drove me around wicklow looking for an open chemist on a Sunday!  A great hotel, would definitely go back.",5,2015,02,03
238,First class!,My wife and I had a weekend break here in January. The suite we stayed in was the largest and one of the best equipped I've ever seen. All of the food was superb and the staff were top notch - very friendly and professional. A great hotel!,5,2015,02,02
238,Very kid friendly,"we stayed here for 2 nights over new year with a 4yr old and a 2yr old. I'm normally hard to please but must admit we had a pleasant stay.

We booked fairly late and got a decent rate. Check in was probably one of the warmest and most genuine I've ever had anywhere.

Room was mostly fantastic. 3 double beds and a cot yet there was still plenty of space. Bathroom was slightly worse for wear but not that you'd notice too much.

Plenty for kids to do, they certainly catered for them. Not sure I'd have been so happy if I was there for a romantic weekend!

Swimming pool was ridiculously busy with kids and seemed to have quite a lot of chlorine too, not that they cared. Slightly peeved that we got told off by the lifeguard for our 4ur old going into the Jacuzzi with us, yet everyone else was doing it.
No shower gel or shampoo in the changing rooms so you need to bring your own from the room. People also walking around the swimming pool with their shoes on which I'd say is unhygienic, although not the hotels fault.

Good breakfast with separate ""egg station"". Perhaps making scrambled eggs available at the buffet may reduce the waiting time in the queue. Strangely, no Soda or potato bread in an Irish hotel, yet plenty of other items. Apart from the egg queue, service was quick and the place clean despite a huge number of people and children.

Had dinner in the bar on first night but organisation seemed rather chaotic. Two different queues to get a table, people walking all over the place. The manager didn't really seem in control and just drifted around.

Staff were all fantastic, we'll be back.",4,2015,02,02
238,"Fabulous hotel, fantastic staff!","We have just enjoyed a wonderful few days in Druids Glen,  my second in as many months! Both stays were thoroughly enjoyable. The Druids Glen hotel is a beautiful hotel, lovely rooms with very comfortable bed's, a beautiful lobby with sitting areas not confined to the bar which is a plus in our opinion but the bar itself & in particular the room off the bar are lovely in any case. We ate both nights in the hotel, once in the dining room & the second night in the bar and the food is beautifully presented & cooked,  we all thoroughly enjoyed our meals including breakfast  which offered a very good choice including but not limited to the traditional full Irish!! It is not buffet style (a nice treat! ).  The real gem in this hotel though are the staff, every single person we met were so friendly & couldn't do enough for us, it really makes a hotel stand out to be able to offer such wonderful staff,  a special mention to Barry & our waitress at breakfast.  In conclusion we would highly recommend this hotel!!!",5,2015,02,01
238,Top notch,"As you drive into the facility then walk into the reception it is clear you are walking into a first class establishment in a beautiful setting. I was here for a two day business meeting. Breakfast and bar food was good. The staff were very obliging, no complaints on that front. Rooms were large and spotless. Would thoroughly recommend for business purposes or even that romantic break that's a little bit special. Will have to pack the golf clubs next time!",5,2015,02,01
238,Outstanding staff,"My fiancee and I , have just started the daunting task of planning our wedding venue .. we had drove to wexford earlier in the day to visit another venue and check it out , unannounced we asked to look at reception room etc and while we were shown around it was more a formality then anything , in and out ...we decided to stop at druids Glen to check it out also , we were really impressed with the grounds and appearance of the resort as we drove in .. we entered reception and we greeted by a woman called Adrianne ( forgive me if I spelt name wrong ) for me , she is the reason we will be now booking our wedding there , she was outstanding , showed us all aspects of their wedding days from the bridal suite to the grounds .. again this was a random Sunday , she was busy , she wasn't even the wedding co ordinator yet she made us feel like the most important guests and clients ... She also compliment us with fabulous bottle of champagne to take with us ... What an credit to your resort... We also had some lunch in the resort , the food was fab and the staff yet again were exceptional..a fantastic atmosphere , with the best staff we have seen in any resort worldwide and I dont say that easily as we have treated ourselves to many resorts in our pre saving for wedding days ;) well done everyone exceptional.

238,One Night Escape,"Just back from staying in this fabulous hotel for a girlie-getaway. From the minute we arrived we were made feel very welcome. Every member of staff we met were friendly, cheerful and helpful. All facilities are spotlessly clean. The food in both the bar and restaurant was delicious. Our spa treatments were so enjoyable and relaxing. 
We will definitely be making a return visit soon.",5,2015,01,31
238,Lovely location poor food and service,"What a lovely location. Unfortunately, the handbasin had remnants of previous guests beard, the food in the restaurant wasn't good and a very limited selection for gluten and dairy intolerant guests. I wouldn't be in a hurry back.",2,2015,01,30
238,A Wonderful Experience,"We stayed at Druids Glen Resort Hotel for 2 nights 28/29 January 2015 and we both agree that we had a wonderful time there.The location and condition of the hotel is superb but it was the staff in the hotel that made our stay so memorable. We had a minor problem of a patio door creaking during a violent wind storm on our first night there,and on our way to breakfast the following morning I talked to a lovely lady at the check in desk about our problem and without hesitation she had us moved to another room as well leaving a complimentary bottle of wine which was very much appreciated.This attention to detail regarding guests enjoyment was shared by all the staff and we would have have no hesitation in recommending this hotel.We will be back.Lilly & Jim",5,2015,01,30
238,Love it here ! ,"We were in Druids Glen for the third time last week, which speaks for itself. Gorgeous hotel, lovely big rooms and fab food, with great facilities (pool, spa, inside playroom and outside play area and so on). We had our very lively toddler with us and all the staff were very understanding and are used of dealing with families! We love it here and will return as soon as we can. ",5,2015,01,29
238,So relaxing .. Will definitely be back,"Had an absolutely fab time with my mam in the Druid's Glen. The hotel was so warm & welcoming. The staff were super friendly and helpful, I really couldn't fault them. The spa was wonderful, so relaxing and the massage was probably one of the nicest I've ever gotten. Food was delicious in the bar and restaurant, however the bar food was quite expensive. The only negative part of our stay was the length of time we waited for our food to be served in the bar and the restaurant. We were waiting fifty minutes for just two sandwiches in the bar which made us late for our sap treatment, luckily the spa were very understanding. We arrived to the restaurant at 07:20pm for dinner, we didn't receive our main course until 09:15pm which we were really disappointed with. Other than the wait for food we had an absolutely fantastic stay and would definitely return !",5,2015,01,28
238,Bar food too expensive now,"We are locals
Even got married here
So going here for years

But the food is too expensive now in the bar 
Menu recently changed
Not as nice as old one 
Not great value

from entering the Hotel we were treated so warmly and well, Lunch in the bar was just fantastic
I had the open prawn sandwich and it was delicious the presentation was fantastic, my daughter in law had the Club sandwich and chips and we were both so pleased , Staff were wonderful , chatty , smiling just what you would expect , service was fast. Well worth a trip. I shall be going back there many times when visiting Wicklow.",4,2015,01,27
238,Excellent weejend,"We stayed for 2 nights for our wedding anniversary & we had our son, aged nearly 10 months with us. From check in to check out, it was a lovely weekend. The room was lovely, the food in both the bar & the restaurant was gorgeous, the pool was great, the playroom was a great addition to have, along with being able to get children's DVDs from reception. Also my husband really enjoyed playing the Druids Glen golf course. We would hope to visit again in the future.",5,2015,01,26
238,Can't recommend enough!!,"I have just returned from a stay with my husband and from the minute we entered the place until we left we simply could not have been looked after better. I was unfortunate to have a little incident on my first night and my husband had to ring reception for help Adrienne and Reggie were present immediately and were so incredibly kind and very quick thinking in getting medical assistance whilst two other ladies Aggie and Annie helped in the room looking after my three month old son. We were really so incredibly touched and we will never forget the kind and caring attitude we were shown. We are checking our dates already to pencil in a date we can return, really an incredible hotel and staff!!",5,2015,01,26
238,A stay at Druids Glen Resort,"My husband and I have just returned from a 3day stay in this resort. This was a Christmas gift from our children so we had no imput with the booking.
 Within easy driving time from Belfast what a gem of a place! Such a genuinely warm welcome upon our arrival...all the staff we encountered were delightful and couldn't do enough for us. Our room which overlooked the golf course was very spacious, beautifully decorated and very comfortable. We enjoyed two lovely meals in the 13th bar and an exception meal in the brasserie on our last night. The swimming pool was great and we made good use of it! All in all a super trip...very relaxing and nice to feel so pampered and cared for! Well worth another visit!",5,2015,01,24
238,Lives up to being under the spell,"Just back from a fantastic 2 night stay. A big thankyou to a lovely lady Adrienne Hughes. What a relaxing experience. The food lived up to the Michelin rating,the staff are friendly and very professional. The room was spotless and luxurious. What more can I say. Loved every minute of it.",5,2015,01,23
238,fabulous,said here on 2 occasions and never remembered to write a review. what a fabulous hotel out in the country with lovely views. breakfast is the best I've ever had and that included the Hilton in Miami! loved the freshly made pancakes. bedroom huge with comfy chairs. pool and spa beautiful too. expensive but a real treat. The only down side is the road getting to and from it- narrow and twisty but that's not the hotels fault! ,5,2015,01,22
238,Weekend away,"I took my partner here for a weekend away in August , its not to far from were we live but on recommendations from friends we had to experience the resort for ourselves. We stayed for 2 nights and to be honest we didn't leave the resort once. For her - the spa is fantastic and has many treatments on offer - we both got a massage... you must!! I went for a game of golf - have played Druids Glen before so said i would try Druids Heath , its not a bad course but if you have the choice stick to the Glen. We had dinner in the brasserie both nights and the food... well it speaks for itself. Fantastic !!! I cant thank the staff enough for a brilliant weekend, they were friendly and welcoming on every level. I cant recommend this place enough.... a must for any traveler looking for a stay in WIcklow. Thanks Guys , see you in the summer.",5,2015,01,20
238,Will be high on my list of places to return to,"My husband and I have just returned from a night spent in the Druids Glen Resort. Before I went I saw all these reviews extolling the virtues of a stay there, and I was a little cautious about how good it might be. Needless to say I was far from disappointed. I thought it was a brilliant place from the fabulous staff, who couldn't do enough for us to the gorgeous rooms and fabulous food. I have no negative comments whatsoever and can't wait to return.",5,2015,01,18
238,Fantastic resort,"We spent a really enjoyable few nights here last weekend.  We booked our stay directly with hotel on a deal that included B&B and one evening meal.  We found all of the facilities including the Spa and the Druids Heath Golf course to be of the highest standard.  Our room was spacious,  very
Comfortable and equipped to a high standard and included a bottle of Prosecco on ice on arrival. 

Our meal was in ""Druids Brasserie"" and can only be described as fantastic as was the service in the restaurant.  On another night we dined in ""the thirteenth"" and it too was top class and very relaxing.

We really enjoyed our stay and Couldn't fault this place in any way.",5,2015,01,15
238,Such a stunning hotel,Stayed here for one night in the summer with my boyfriend at short notice and had such an amazing time. I am a frequent traveller and this hotel really do treat their guests like royalty. Food was tops and the rooms were really big and cosey. The pool area was nice but full of kids the weekend we went. The hotel has a huge amount of grounds and they have bikes you can borrow to cycle around which we did and the views we fab. Only a short drive from Dublin too which was handy. I would definitely be back. ,5,2015,01,13
238,First Class,"Just back from 2 nights in this hotel with family,including 2 children and a young baby. Could not find fault with any aspect of our stay. Wonderful!  Bedrooms were spacious, modern and very comfortable, food was tasty and the children loved the pool and play areas.However I think it was my all over impression of the hotel staff, from porters to management, that has inspired me to write this review.
Even though the hotel was quite busy with young families, the personal attention and friendliness of each of the staff made one feel so welcome, and it led to the whole area having a lovely relaxed ambience.
I have stayed in numerous hotels but the Druids Glen to be one of the best.
 Congratulations!",5,2015,01,12
238,A Great night with Fantastic Staff,"Myself and my Wife stayed here for one night, On Saturday the 10th of January 2015.
I was having a great time, using there swimming pool and saunas, and i went down for Dinner, Just after my Starters, i felt very unwell (THIS WAS NOT DUE TO THE DINNER IN ANY WAY!) 
I made my way to the toilets when i felt very weak, and asked a lady for help, she got the management team and them proceeded to make me as comfortable as possible, Michelle the on call Duty Manger, Called an Ambulance for me straight away, as i was not looking well and there was a fear i might be having a heart attack, Thank god this wasn't the case. While waiting for the ambulance, Amy another staff member went and got my wife, she was very nice and really looked after me during this distressing time. There was another Staff member that also help me when i was lying down he place my feet up high because i was feeling like i was going to pass out, He works in the Gym, and Has a beard. Sorry i never got his name. The main reason for tell you all this, Is the staff in Druids Glenn are amazing and really a lot of other hotels should learn from them. after the all clear from the ambulance team, I stayed the night in a very very comfortable bed and i had a really nice breakfast the next morning. Next time we stay here i will bring my four year old girl for a Family time as there is lots for children to do here. Again a big thank you for all your help on the night and really look forward to staying here again. Stuart Murray",5,2015,01,12
238,Excellent stay in December 2014,"We stayed ( Two couples & four kids) for one night over Christmas. From the moment we arrived the service was excellent! The staff were friendly and helpful, the rooms very modern and spacious and any extras we asked for as a family with young children were provided very quickly! We ate in the bar twice, used the babysitting service and the leisure facilities, and I couldn't fault anything. When we left we thought we had forgotten something and rang the hotel. Barry not only looked for the item and called me back, but also followed up to make sure all had been resolved! A lovely family friendly hotel which is well worth a visit! We will be back.......",5,2015,01,11
238,stay in Druids Glen Resort,"Myself, my husband and two children stayed in Druids Glen Resort in November 2014 for a two night weekend break from Cork. We were really looking forward to the break. On arrival the staff were very welcoming and friendly offering us warm freshening up cloths and bottles of water. The children were given activity packs and popcorn for the movie in the playroom. My 5 year old was really looking forward to the swimming pool the following morning as she was is in the process of learning how to swim and wanted to practice her skills during the weekend. Myself and my daughter proceeded to find the leisure centre. We could not find it initially as work was been carried out within that area and I thought it was closed. When we found it a young chap gave us towels without talking and when we proceeded into the pool area. To my horror firstly parents and visitors who were not in swimming attire were walking around the pool area with their shoes and boots...thank god we had flip- flops on! Secondly the pool is very dangerous with no lifeguard and no shallow end to the pool so my daughter and I very disappointed that she could not practice her swimming. The hotel is lovely with friendly staff but the leisure centre would stop me from staying in the Druids Glen again.",3,2015,01,10
238,Lovely New Yeat Break in a beautiful hotel.,"Myself, Husband,Son and Daughter in law,Daughter and Partner and 3 Grand Children ages 13, 2 and 7 months stayed in this hotel on the night of 30th and 31st December 2014. The rooms were very spacious with a lovely bathroom well stocked with shampoos etc. The Reception area was spacious and booking in was speedy(. Our bags arrived in our room before us ). The food in the bar was very tasty and arrived in good time on our first day but a little slower on New Years Day. The 6 course meal on New Years Eve was beautifully presented and was very tasty. the waiters were attentive at all times. There was a ballad band in the bar which could have been better given the occasion. Breakfast on both mornings was delicious with a large selection to choose from. The Golf Course I'm told was a joy to play on and the Husband and Grand daughter had great fun on the driving range. The assistant there was as very pleasant lad I was told. A great Family break was had by all.",5,2015,01,08
238,Under the Spell,"Absolutely love everything about this hotel, the lobby, the bar and the restaurants. 5 star and staff that are simply superb from start the finish - people who have prestige in the career choice they have made and it shows. Food excellent, breakfast superb. Highly recommended!",5,2015,01,07
238,Superb again,"Lovely immaculate hotel in a great location. Food, staff , restaurants and bar brilliant! What more can you ask. We stayed here again because we have family locally but this time it was to attend a funeral . Under difficult circumstances the hotel was still just as good and it was a sanctuary after a dificult day. Will be staying again, no doubt.",5,2015,01,07
238,Great family hotel,"We stayed here in October with the kids, we are unsure as to what a kid friendly hotel would entail as we very rarely take the kids to fancy hotels!  Needless to say the stay was fantastic.  The hotel staff could not have been better, always smiling an interacting with the kids.  Food was very good, the breakfast had plenty to choose from.
The only thing I'd change is to have a larger playroom, it was a bit cramped when there were a number of kids in it and the sound didn't work on the screen.
Swimming pool was excellent, kids loved it.  Good choice of DVD's if you didn't bring any. Lovely walks around the property meant the kids could take their scooters.
On leaving the hotel, the kids were given a bottle of water, sweets and a t-shirt!",5,2015,01,06
238,fantastic,Very nice 2 days spent hear staff where wonderful all from start to finish we had dinner in bar first night it was good but the second night we dined in mane restaurant it was wonderful for hotel food it was fantastic the leisure centre is very good and modern with every thing pool it self could be warmer  in the room we had 2 beds Quinn size for 2 adults they are small but the room was comfortably we really enjoyed our stay and we will definitely return,5,2015,01,05
238,Enjoyable experience,"We recently stayed at the Druids Glen Hotel. From the moment we arrived every single staff member could not have been more courteous. The attention to detail is second to none. We ate at the Brasserie, & I'm glad we did as the food was superb. The spa was excellent. All in all we would definitely recommend this hotel. Perfect for a couple to unwind. Would definitely come back. ",5,2015,01,04
238,Excellent Hotel with excellent staff,As a family we stayed for the New Year. Really impressed by all the staff throughout. Very friendly and so helpful. Druids Glen is an excellent location for us as we take in shopping in Dundrum. We dined in the Thirteenth on return within the hotel in the lounge area of the bar which is so comfortable. The food and service was excellent. Rooms are so comfortable with Sky Sports and Nickelodeon for the kids. There was a DVD player also with a selection of DVDs at reception for the kids. Used the health spa which was very relaxing. Already looking forward to staying there next Xmas/New Year.,5,2015,01,04

238,5 Star Luxury with the Kids.,"I could not recommend this hotel enough! From the moment you arrive you experience 5 star luxury but the hotel is so child friendly you can bring the kids without any reservation as you may have with other 5 star hotels. We stayed with an 8 month old and a 4 year old. There was so much to do to keep our 4 year old occupied during our stay. He loved it! We had stayed with friends a few years ago and loved it then but it was actually even better this time around. I think they have improved some of the children's play areas and I think the rooms have been renovated since our last stay. We stayed between Christmas and New Years and the atmosphere and décor in the hotel was amazing! It was great to sit in front of the open fire in the lobby. We have already made plans to stay again this time next year. My son is already looking forward to going back to the ""Christmas Hotel"". Hopefully we will have the opportunity to stay here many times again in the future.",5,2015,01,02
238,A little gem in the Wicklow mountains.,"Lovely hotel, excellent facilities. Rooms were huge, pool and spa area great for all the family. Special touches from the staff on arrival and departure. Great outdoor play area for kids if the weather is good.",5,2014,12,31
238,Welcoming and comfortable,"Set in beautiful co Wicklow we spent 3 nights here over Christmas as overspill from the family house.
Friendly welcome , comfortable rooms and a superb breakfast buffet.
We did not eat any other meals here. Golf course looks stunning and the pool area is pleasant .Would happily return.",5,2014,12,31
238,super staff,"Just returned from our latest stay at this hotel, what make this place, is the quality of the staff, all are courteous, friendly and professional irrespective of their particular tasks. The management deserve full credit for creating what seems to the guests like a big happy family atmosphere amongst the staff. We have been here several times over the last few years and recognised several familiar faces at reception , bar etc. We would not hesitate in reccommeding a stay at this place and will be returning in the future.",5,2014,12,31
238,Exceptional  service and a great venue,"My wife and I have just returned from Druids Glen. We had a wonderful stay there. The staff were wonderful, their attention to detail went over and beyond. We travelled on our own this time, but having seen the facilities on offer for children, we will definitely be returning with our own children in the not too distant future.",5,2014,12,31
238,Wonderful staff would recommend to friends and family.,Could not fault hotel or staff very friendly and welcoming this was our second visit very clean and nice walking area in the grounds.The kids enjoyed the pool area and the playground.There will definitly be a return visit on the card,5,2014,12,30
238,Faultless stay,"Just back from a 2 night family stay in Druid's Glen Resort. Our stay could quite simply not have been any better. Fantastic greeting on arrival with two lovely gifts for the kids at reception. There were lots of things included for the kids like a free golf clinic, DVD, games room, swimming pool, sauna, plunge pool, steam room, gym. The staff were brilliant too - couldn't do enough.. Room was spacious clean and a big bathroom. We went for the B+B option only and the breakfast was amazing. There was a young red headed guy servicing us teas and coffee, he made an Americano it was literally the nicest coffee I've ever had. He mentioned he has won an award for same a couple of years ago. He knew all there is to know about the art of coffee..Anyway pancakes for the kids, cooked to order eggs, really nice fresh fruit etc etc. Lots to do outside the hotel - lovely walks in Powerscourt etc. You can also borrow bikes foc. Very good SPA which my wive enjoyed and ranked up there with any of them The reason we didn't order dinner is we had heard the bar food was very good and yes you've guessed it... it was excellent and good value with no sneaky add ons.

Without doubt will be back - next year!",5,2014,12,29
238,Wedding,"My son had his Wedding Reception last weekend at the hotel. Organised by the wonderful Nessa (better than Fronk from the Wedding Planner film!!). Everything worked like clockwork and a great day was had by all. Superb friendly service.
We had a private dinner the night before in the Yellow Room at the Clubhouse, looked after by Christy & Caroline. Absolutely perfect from the moment we arrived.
Highly recommended all round.",5,2014,12,28
238,Pre Christmas break,"Our 7th pre christmas at druids and by far the best to date.The new decor  has completely changed the feel of the entire hotel.on entering we were immediately made to feel at home ,something which is hugely important when you have three kids between the ages of eleven and eighteen in tow.there is a new  air of warmth,relaxation,security and friendliness coupled with under stated pampering which we have rarely experienced during a hotel stay.The family vote at breakfeast on the morning of our departure was unanimously in favour of a longer stay, maybe even over christmas ,next year.A huge thanks to all for helping to start our family christmas with such a wonderful experience",5,2014,12,26
238,Wonderful retreat less than one hours drive from Dublin,"I spent the Christmas Holidays at one do my favorite nature retreats close to Dublin, the Druids Glen Golf Resprt, set among Wicklow's rolling hills and only ten minutes by taxi from the Greystones Dart Station ( hotel will arrange puck up if requested). As always the leisure facilities from swimming pool to Spa was great. However for a four star hotel that is trying to regain its five star status, especially for the Druids Brasserie, the service on Christmas Eve for dinner was woeful and after two hours we left without even having desert. The previous night we had eaten in the thirteenth bar and the turkey and ham Chefs Special was out of this. Other than this, our stay was great, with free mulled wine and roaring fires to keep that Christmas Spirit going.

Recommendation would be 4 out of five

238,Excellent Hotel,"Top class hotel with excellent facilities. Bedroom and bathroom were well laid out. Staff really friendly. Food in the restaurant was mixed. A little bothered when told we could have dinner at 6:30 or 9:30 as they were fully booked, eventually got it moved to 7pm but restaurant had almost half the tables empty when we left at about 9. 
A nice stay was had by all.",5,2014,12,14
238,Family celebration ,"Sixteen family members went to stay in Druids Glen Resort. Two adults had booked to play golf but were denied due to members taking their time slot as the members couldn't play earlìer due to frost. Not really fair.
Rooms are superb and top quality. The dinner that night was mixed, the starter was tiny portions but plenty of bread. Main course was superb with steak and fillet beef but fish portions were small 
Where we were seated was poor area with a draught wafting through plus near a kitchen area despite having booked over 4 weeks ago  . Service staff were excellent during dinner.
Sitting in the bar after dinner the draught found us again. Asked staff to close doors we were told it wasn't coming through there. Not good enough.

238,What a relaxing experience!!," Five lady captains from, respectively, Faithlegg Waterford Castle, Dunmore East,   The Castle and Tramore Golf Clubs,    stayed in Druids resort and played golf in Druids Glen! What a relaxing, enjoyable and memorable experience! We arranged our outing with Mr Duncan McAlpin,who coordinated our stay in such a professional manner! He is to be commended for his dedication to customer services! We were greeted at reception with hot towels and believe me after 18 holes of golf that was a welcoming experience! Some of the ladies went to the Spa and relaxed, whilst the others just relaxed in their spacious and beautifully furnished rooms ! Then we went to dinner ; sumptuous food and excellent service! The following morning ,after a lavish breakfast we set off on our journey home; totally relaxed and invigorated! We all want to repeat this experience early next year! Well done Duncan , what a manager!!

238,Can't wait to return,"We recently enjoyed a one night break in Druid's Glen.

We were really impressed with every aspect of our stay.  From the moment you check in (love the hot towels) to the moment you leave, the staff in Druid's Glen make you feel like a VIP.

We enjoyed a meal in Druid's Brasserie.  The food was excellent but the service was even better.  Loic was looking after us..... this man is a credit to Druid's Glen, one of the best waiters I've ever encountered in many years eating out in Ireland.

We will certainly be returning to Druid's Glen for a longer stay in 2015.",5,2014,12,09
238,Great for kids and staff are brilliant.,"We stayed with our 2 children for two nights in a family room. Every single staff member we encountered was genuine, helpful and friendly. We had a lovely meal in the Brasserie and food in the Thirteenth was good too. Lots of amenities for the little ones. They loved the DVD selection, the pool was great fun and they even got to enjoy the outdoor playground. Top marks went to the playroom which was very popular. I had a treatment at the spa and it was superb. All in all would highly recommend this lovely hotel, and it's excellent staff.",4,2014,12,09
238,Stupendous,"I stayed here with a friend two weeks ago, and what a beautiful place this is. It is easy to see that the management monitor the operations throughout the hotel very carefully, and that staff have great training. From our hot hand towel greeting to being presented the bill in an envelope with the member of staff actually leaving the other side of the reception desk to hand it personally to us, to the spotless clean rooms with super comfortable beds it was first class all the way. We ate in the lobby bar and what a feast, we had a delicious meal there which was probably the tastiest meal I have had for a long time. The staff, especially the bar manager, were super accommodating. We also visisted the spa and had 3 treatments each, which was part of a deal, wonderful! Great spa staff too. I cannot say enough about this hotel and the way in which it is run. First class comfort and service from start to finish! I am planning a family get together here for next year - the only place to be.
Thank you to one and all!",5,2014,12,09
238,Fabulous stay and fantastic staff,"We stayed at the Druids Glen Resort for one night for a family gathering.  Straight away at check-in we were bowled over by the warm, helpful and professional greeting (the hot towels are a lovely touch).  The hotel itself is lovely, the food is great but what really stood out for us was how really lovely and helpful all the staff were.  It was also nice to stay in a 5* hotel that actually felt like a 5* hotel for once.  We would definitely like to return and would definitely recommend this hotel !",5,2014,12,08
238,Fabulous weekend,"We have just returned from a fabulous weekend at druids glen. Every staff member from the minute we arrived until we departed, were friendly, attentive and very pleasant. The hotel has a really lovely atmosphere. We will definitely return.",5,2014,12,02
238,Wonderful relaxing stay,"My husband and I visited Druids having won a prize at a raffle last Christmas. This was our first visit to this wonderful resort and after a fabulous weekend, it won't be our last! Everything from start to finish was impeccable. The hotel itself was decorated beautifully for Christmas and the atmosphere was homely and cosy. We had a huge comfortable room on the top floor with lovely views of the golf course. Breakfast both mornings was excellent and we also enjoyed an amazing dinner in the druids brasserie on one evening. The food was beautiful and the service was fantastic. The staff in Druids are really the icing on the cake. All of them are so attentive and professional. They really take pride in their work and take great care of all guests. We had a wonderful relaxing visit and would not hesitate to recommend. ",5,2014,11,30
238,A fab school reunion in a fab hotel,"Last weekend, my 4 school friends, over from London, and I checked into the Druids glen for a weekend of catching up and relaxation. As we all hit 40 in the last year we decided to make it a special weekend catch up and it was. The hotel was fabulous and so friendly, clean, and relaxing. Our spa treatments were wonderful. The food was amazing and plentiful. So much so, we might make this an annual event at the Druids Glen!",5,2014,11,28
238,Fabulous,"We stayed here for 2 nights, we were only supposed to stay 1 but it was so relaxing we didn't want to go.... The staff are always really friendly and helpful, rooms are lovely and spacious. The restaurant is excellent. We stayed in a suite this time and it was so comfortable it was like home from home. Since new mgt took over, the hotel is really family friendly, with both indoor and outdoor play areas. I can not recommend here enough for families it's the perfect place for little ones without compromising on the luxury for grown ups.",5,2014,11,26
238,Quality!,"I've just returned home after a fabulous weekend  here with a group of friends. The service was excellent, friendly and attentive staff, wonderful spa and great food! The entertainment in the bar was great too.  Would definitely recommend for families, small groups and couples. ",5,2014,11,24
238,Great family stay!,This was our second time staying with our 2 children. Our room was lovely the last time but the rooms have been upgraded since our last stay and are absolutely gorgeous - very spacious and comfy family room - decor beautiful! The staff at this hotel stood out the last time - so pleasant and helpful and our experience was no different this time - from reception staff to waiters in the bar/ restaurant all were helpful and good craic!! Facilities are excellent at this hotel - we used the pool and the kids playroom is exceptional - suited for young kids right up to teenagers. Hotel is also a great base for discovering this lovely county in Ireland.We were sorry to leave and will definitely be back soon!,5,2014,11,23
238,What a beautiful place!,"Had planned to visit Druids years ago and trip was canceled due to bad weather.  Finally made it this November and I am pleased I did.  The hotel is absolutely fantastic and beautiful in the Irish countryside outside of Dublin.  The night there we visited the bar and had a wonderful time conversing with the bartender Stephen.  He made us feel welcomed and gave us some great tips for sightseeing in waterford, our ultimate destination.

The rooms are large by European standards, they are clean and beautifully decorated.  The bed was about the most comfortable I've ever slept in at a hotel.  Breakfast the next morning was outstanding as well.  The entire hotel is beautiful, kid and family friendly, and is in a terrific location if you like peace and quiet - note that it is remote.  Would definitely recommend this hotel and will someday return.",5,2014,11,23
238,Superb!,"Had a lovely stay at Druids Glen. We had a package which included breakfast, dinner and a spa treatment. The spa and treatment was out of this world. Staff could not do enough for you and the food was exceptional. Can't wait to go again.",5,2014,11,23
238,Sadly we were disappointed,"We were getting away for a spa relaxation weekend and were hopeful Druids glen would deliver. Sadly not. The spa and pool area was very disappointing. Timber and building materials strewn behind doors. Water everywhere and no spa menu in room. The staff were very friendly and rooms were nice. But the property itself and spa facilities need a complete upgrade. Very dated and not relaxing at all, opening times for children should be limited also. Arrived to also be told the restaurant was fully booked. Weekend wasn't as we had hoped. Will not return or recommend to friends. ",3,2014,11,23
238,Amazing!!,"We have just left the Druids Glen Resort and had the most amazing two days. The room was outstanding and the staff were so genuine and helpful particularly Conor on reception, Cian at breakfast and Olly. I cannot recommend it enough and really look forward to returning very soon. Thank you very much for making our honeymoon so special. ",5,2014,11,19
238,A great gofing weekend.,"We are a group of ladies who love to get away and play golf. The trip was organised by Celtic Tours and everything was perfect. We had a fantastic room, very spacious, well equipped with everything you could need, and a beautiful view of the countryside.
The breakfast was a very good buffet with a varied selection of food. The dinner was extremely good with a well balanced menu.
All the staff were very helpful and friendly, and some of the waiters amusing and entertaining.
The golf course was in great condition and set in beautiful and natural surroundings.
The weekend was very good value and I am looking forward to going there again.",5,2014,11,17
238,Worth another visit.,"My husband and had just one night here bed and breakfast as we were passing by.Arrived on a really wet night and it was no bother for a member of staff to park our car.We received such a warm welcome.The room was excellent,most beautiful bed linen and comfortable bed,very spacious and relaxing.The breakfast was one of the best we have had in any hotel.We had no time to try out the spa or leisure centre.
Each and every member of staff were courteous and were very proud of Druid's Glen.
We look forward to the next time we visit Wicklow.",5,2014,11,17
238,Just ok,"Re Druids Glen- its a lovely hotel you could go with or without children there was lots of people with children so the  facilities must be good.if your going without the children the SPA is lovely and I had a lovely massage there this morning.The food just ok nothing special although I just ate in bar when I arrived and we had Carvery later which was grand nothing special though.The breakfast just ok the hot option was warm but not hot and then u have your choice of fruit yoghurt  etc.if u do decide to go bring your own water or drink bottled the tap water is rotten,I could taste it in the tea and the water I was given in spa was the same.The rooms are grand but I was roasted last night and couldn't open window(which don't open)so it was ver y clammy (there is air conditioning in but I don't like it air conditioning on when trying to sleep)needless to say I didn't sleep very well ..so all in all it was fine but I'd say over rated",3,2014,11,15
238,Midterm retreat,"
We took mid term break in Druids Glen and had such a lovely time.  DruidsGlen is homely and comfortable.  It is not pretentious and kids were very much at home.  We ate in the brasserie on our first night, food was really good. On our 2nd night we ate in the restaurant, the kids loved the buffet and we had a fantastic meal also. Pool was busy but not uncomfortable. Beds were comfortable although only queen size so let's just say cosy! Playroom is well equipped with xbox, air hockey, games machine and soft play area and toys for smaller children. Overall  an enjoyable experience and would recommend for a family break.",4,2014,11,13
238,The welcome and attention to your stay is second to none. ,"What a fanastic place to hold the Product Launch. The decor and quality are superb and only eclipsed by the staff.
I normally do not name staff but Duncan went above and beyond and really made my stay. Cian in the restaurant is a star as well as the best coffee in Ireland!

The standard is truly of the highest in ALL areas and to cater for such a large group efficiently is commendable. 

Relaxing and superb grounds and if you like to chase a ball it is a must go place.

A big well done to all and I would love to come back with my wife when we decide to tour the Emerald Isle.",5,2014,11,11
238,Excellent stay,"My husband and I stayed in Druids Glen for one night on a b&b plus dinner package.  We stayed in a standard room which I think have all been recently renovated.  The room was very spacious, with a high ceiling and new tv and dvd player in the room.  Water and bathrobe and slippers were provided.  The bathroom was also big with separate bath and shower.  Our dinner in the restaurant was excellent, we both had the Chef special for starter which on the night was venison carpacio.  My husband had beef for main and I had hake.  We both had chocolate dessert.  You pay a supplement for some choices if you are on a dinner inclusive package.  I think what really stood out for us about the hotel was the service.  From the moment you enter where you are greeted at reception with a hot towel to the service in the bar and restaurant, the service is really excellent, from friendly and genuine staff.  It was our first night staying away without our baby son and we were definitely happy with our choice.  Like some of the other reviewers, the hotel does seem to be really child friendly so it could be a nice place to return to with our little boy.  There's a Druids Den downstairs for kids and I saw in the information booklet the hotel have a kitchenette room on the second floor with a bottle steriliser and microwave which would be really handy with a small baby.  The night away was to celebrate my husband's birthday and the hotel left a box of chocolates with a printed card in our room wishing him a happy birthday which was a lovely touch.  It was definitely a great experience and we would return.",5,2014,11,11
238,FAB,"Myself and my husband stayed here for one night to celebrate our anniversary along with our 10 month old son. On arrival we were greeted by Marie on reception. A hot towel to refresh too. A lovely personable greeting and very helpful with the baby. Lots of facilities for families. A playroom, kitchenette on the 2nd floor, the pool and dvd collections to keep little ones occupied. They seem to really value having families stay. We got an upgrade to a fabulous suite when we arrived which was hands down, the nicest room we have ever stayed in. When we went down for dinner, Allwyen took great care of us and made instant friends with the baby. Even made him a special FANCY baby bowl!! LOL. He gave us a complimentary glass of prosecco. The dinner was out of this world. The next day I was treated to a facial in the spa. It was heaven. Got lots of beauty tips too from Sorcha. All in all..... I cannot wait for our next visit!",5,2014,11,09
238,Perfect retreat from the outside world,"I've heard about Druid's Glen many times and only ever heard good things so was delighted when a friend booked a dinner + B&B for three of us as a treat for one night.  It is stunning,  from the location, to the friendliness of staff, to the beautiful decor, comfortable beds, exquisite food (restaurant), great leisure facilities...I could find no fault with Druid's Glen other than my trip was too short!
I can't wait to go back again - this time for at least 2 nights!",5,2014,11,09
238,"Finally, somewhere that cares!","From the friendly welcome to the departing farewell, we were most impressed by every member of staff we happily encountered. Without being over the top, this hotel obviously prides itself in its outstanding customer service. Despite being busy (popular for a reason) every guest was treated equally and given professional yet personal service. Room refurbishment is tasteful, and every detail has been dealt with. I don't automatically write reviews after all hotel visits but feel compelled to do on this occasion as a direct result of the fantastic experience Druids provided.Will most definitely be returning at the first opportunity and without hesitation, recommend anyone to visit.",5,2014,11,08
238,Fabulous family hotel,"We stayed in this hotel with our three young children (aged 6,4 and 7 months) for 3 nights over the Halloween period. And I have to say for it was fabulous from start to do finish. Very well catered for the children. Especially a nice touch having a baby kitchenette on the 2nd floor with steriliser, microwave and fridge. Just sorry we weren't staying longer so I could have fitted in a spa treatment.

238,Very nice resort - beautiful setting,"Came to the Druids Glen for an evening.  Did not golf - although I believe they have 2 courses.   The accommodations are consistent with a first class resort.  Room included water, coffee, tea.  With cloth robes, slippers.  Nice bathroom with soaking tub and separate shower. 

The setting is amazing - in the country of Ireland, about an hr from Dublin.  Very green and nicely kept grounds.  

Service was excellent.  Food on site was excellent - had ocean caught Atlantic salmon.  Standard UK breakfast included.",5,2014,11,06
238,service with a  smile,"Stayed  here overnight  on Ist  November. Very impressive.  Concierge  met  us  first  and  his  welcome and  service  set  the  tone  of  our  stay. He , in  common with  every  staff  member  we  met , provided  service  of  the  highest order  and  always  with  a  smile.
Food  in  the  restaurant much better  than  we  expected ,  consistent  with  good  restaurant  standard. Accomodation  first  class.

Will definitely be back 😃",5,2014,11,02
238,Relaxing family getaway ,"We stayed for the weekend over the mid term break with our 5 year old daughter. The staff are an absolute credit to the hotel, they really made us feel welcome from the moment we arrived, our little girl to her delight was presented with a gift pack with puzzles etc. We ate in the bar which was very busy but well managed. The bar food was good, I had the special of the day(chicken wrapped in Parm ham) which was a little dry and would have benefited from a jus, my husband had the cod which was very tasty.  Breakfast was buffet style with plenty to choose from including fresh pancakes which were a big hit with the kids. There's a playroom on the first floor which came in handy on a very wet day and there's also a selection of dvds at reception for kids to choose from. 
Overall a really enjoyable stay and we will most definitely return! ",5,2014,11,02
238,Excellent stay as always,"Spent last two nights in Druids Glen with our two children aged 10 and 5 and had an absolute ball. We just love the hotel for a number of reasons. The staff are unbelievably friendly and can't do enough to make your stay special. As returning guests it's lovely to have a personal welcome card and chocolates waiting in the room on arrival.The food in both the restaurant and bar is excellent. First night we had a beautiful meal in the restaurant, steak was excellent and second evening in the bar. We would highly recommend the chowder and cod on the bar menu. Seating in the 13th bar is so comfortable and the atmosphere is always very relaxing. Service in all areas is top class. The rooms are excellent, spacious and comfortable. The pool and facilities  are first class. Children are made so welcome and have loads to do both in the hotel with the games room and the play park outside. Wifi in the hotel is complimentary and coverage is excellent in all areas. We have been going to the hotel every year for the last 10 years and have never been disappointed. When we were checking out today the children were both given Halloween t-shirts, a lovely surprise just the icing on the cake of another lovely stay. We would highly recommend Druids Glen and guarantee you won't be disappointed.",5,2014,10,31
238,Excellent Family Hotel,"We stayed in this hotel for 2 nights over mid-term, the hotel seemed very full , with alot of families with young children, but the staff made every effort to make each family welcome. Service was excellent at all times, all staff were extremely friendly and efficient. The rooms were beautiful and I could not fault breakfast or the bar food. We have found our favourite family hotel in Ireland.",5,2014,10,31
238,Charges like a 5 star but doesn’t deliver like one.,"True character is only shown at the most difficult moment and Druids Glen was found lacking in a difficult week, midterm.

It was out of choice to go mid term week but this is all I have to rate the hotel on.  It was very full of families and clearly stretched but a 5 star hotel should have a desire for quality exuding from every staff member and that does not exist in Druids Glen.

Rooms
We had adjoining rooms to cater for kids and the rooms are large and very comfortable and they have managed to create a sense of warmth.  There was a sizeable stain on the side of our bed, see pic, how could this go unnoticed?
Rooms had slippers, robes, loads to towels.  Showers are excellent but beds are not, springy and ache inducing. Our window had a fly problem which meant we could not open the windows, due to the proximity of trees I assume. It was known about as told by staff but not fixed yet.

Kids
The hotel has a playground outside, pool inside and a kids playroom with electronic games, air hockey, fuzz ball etc.
Pool is mental given the week that is in it, go early or else it’s a nightmare.   I think its over chlorinated also as everyone was itchy after coming out of the water.
Playroom is good, close to the general seating area so nice for parents to relax if the kids are the right age.
Playground is good.
Hotel also had organized kids activities which with the exception of a face painter  painter seems to be showing a movie in the playroom which was unsupervised.

Gym is good with lots of machines so no waiting.
Driving range is a short walk but €10 for 100 balls while staying in the hotel – really!

Food
Breakfast in included and the selection is very good, everything from cheese and smoke salmon to pancakes, sausages, eggs, pastries etc and quality is good but the queues can be slow. Service for tea and coffee can also be strained at peak times.
Dinner in the restaurant was manic, staff stretched to breaking with long delays and things coming out of order. Quality was good.

Staff
Staff were hit and miss. Some were engaging and pleasant, some didn’t speak much and avoided eye contact.
Door men were exceptional, as were room cleaning staff, evening dinner staff were very pleasant but stretched too far.  
Reception was good depending on who was there and the bar was poor. We sat in the open area in reception beside the fire as many others did and there was always dirty glasses and cups left uncleared.  It took us to ask 3 times to have the removed one evening.
The first three bills we paid kids received Miwadi drinks FOC, a big plus and a pet hate of mine when places charge for it.  Turns out it is hit and miss and depends who is serving as to whether they charge or not.  The only thing worse than charging is not knowing if you will be charged or not.

Add to this that our room door was left open twice by staff and I wasn't overly impressed with some service. After the second time some came to check it, why not the first?  No idea.

Summary  
You have to judge a 5 star hotel on it performance and at this level and price it should be the same no matter whether there the hotel is full or half empty.  Druids Glen facilities are good but the staff didn’t meet the challenge during mid term week.

Certainly would not return during mid term.",3,2014,10,31
238,Relaxing stay,"Stayed here with my husband and 2 teenage boys for mid term. Hotel is very luxurious. Swimming pool a bit strict ..no ball games were allowed during allocated ""family time"" which didn't go down well with boys but there was table tennis and a pool table to keep them entertained. Rooms were spacious. We ate both nights in restuarant. Food was very good and good value with dinner included. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was my favourite as it was open to 11am...just what you want when chilling for couple of days! Plenty of activities near by for family..Powerscourt house & Gardens, sea life aquarium in Bray and a good ol' beach in Greystones <10mins away.",5,2014,10,30
238,Great for a Toddler,"Stayed for 3 nights. The playroom has great toys for a toddler, helpful when the weather is poor. There is also a playground outside. 

Staff were fabulous. Tea served in the lobby from early was pleasant when my son woke up to explore at 6.30.",5,2014,10,26
238,"Very relaxing stay, great for young families","We had a thoroughly enjoyable short stay. I didn't realise the level of facilities for families, baby prep room, play rooms etc. Breakfast was a delight, swimming pool was great. It is clear that the rooms have undergone a renovation and as they were in excellent condition. there were nice touches in relation to children's DVDs and baby food etc. The staff in particular were excellent from the concierge, reception and breakfast, couldn't do enough for us.",5,2014,10,23
238,"Great place, great food, great people","We are just back from a night here and can't stop raving about this place, not cheap but even then great value. We went DBB and the meal was lovely the best steak I've had in many a year. The pool was fun and big. We called at 10am and their wasn't a room ready but when we arrived about 10.45 they had the room ready. Didn't get to explore the outside of the hotel due to my son wanting to go back to the pool again and the weather but it looked lovely. IF YOUR BUDGET CAN STRETCH GO.We are planing to go back already.",5,2014,10,23
238,Amazing,"We had an amazing overnight stay in this hotel and were treated like royalty from the moment we arrived until we departed ,the staff ,food ,porter, restaraunt were fantastic .we would highly recommend this hotel and look forward to returning,the Kenny family ,malahide co,dublin",5,2014,10,22
238,Just the best!,"This was our third stay at Druids Glen and will certainly not be our last.  You are just made so welcome - from the moment you arrive to the moment you leave. The  note and a box of chocs in our room to welcome us back as returning guests was a lovely extra touch. Rooms are spacious and beautifully furnished, with everything you could possibly need for a comfortable stay.  All the staff we encountered were lovely and so willing to help you if needed.  The breakfasts are delicious, and in a change from the previous years the cooked items were served to you, rather than there being a buffet which was very nice.  The range of food is fantastic, from fresh fruit, porridge, different breads and pastries, through to the ""Full Irish""  The weather when we were there was lovely, and the walk around the golf course and up to the old club house is beautiful.  The leisure centre is great, and generally not too busy.  You really do not need to leave the resort if you are just on a short break and want to relax, but the nearby town of Greystones is only a few kms away, with its lovely shops and restaurants, and the drive over the Military Road to Sally Gap and Glencree is stunning.  The perfect location for a fabulous holiday! Can't wait to return.",5,2014,10,20
238,Gorgeous vast resort,"We stayed one night here on a 11 day tour through Ireland.

Pros:
1) stunning lobby area: the lobby stood out to me with tall stone fireplaces and great seating areas. Very cozy. There were also great views of the surrounding gold course, green grasses and small mountains in the distance.
2) Food: we ate at the bar area and the chicken wings were delicious. The main was a steak that was perfectly cooked. The service was also very attentive and excellent.
3) The room was quite nice, cozy large bed and everything worked well as it should.

Cons:
1) my only issue relates to the swim caps. This was the first hotel (of many) with a pool we stayed at and swim caps for the pool were required which coming from the US where none are required in pools I was not expecting it. I am fine with this, but the health club charged 3 euro each for them so we passed and just used the jacuzzi, sauna, and steam room. When paying well over 100 euros for a 5 star hotel, feeling like you are nickeled and dimed for a swim cap is a tad annoying. Just give hotel guests a swim cap to use if they happen not to have one. This is a minor negative but worth noting.

Overall, I would stay again if I was in the area and also recommend it without reservation. For a 5 star resort the price was very reasonable and services were on par with what I would expect from a 5 star resort.",5,2014,10,19
238,It's the little things...,"Stayed in the hotel overnight as was at an event during the day. Went to the Spa the following morning for a facial. I found the service very attentive - hot towel on arrival, tea/coffee and croissants available in reception, bottle of water on check out for your trip home etc. Spa was also very pleasant with a nice relaxation room experience before and after the facial. Breakfast was fine - could be a little more organised. Room was nice - shower could do with updating. All in all a very pleasant stay and I do intend to go back when I get a chance. ",5,2014,10,19
238,Ireland finest!,"Hands down the best hotel we've every stayed at in Ireland,  we love doing weekend hotel breaks with the kids going to many different hotels around the country but just a 40 minute drive from our house we've found our perfect place, from the moment you arrive your made to feel like you are the most important people at the hotel, from the concierge to the reception to the lounge staff to the cleaners every single member of staff has obviously been very well trained and genuinely look like they enjoy their work, hot towels on arrival chocolates delivered to our room and many other little details that make this place amazing, the facilities are the best that we've experienced at any hotel from the pool to the kids playroom and playground and the whole resort (the heath golf course is one of the best I've played) it's top quality, the rooms are big and spacious with lovely bathrooms and sky sports in your room! breakfast was fantastic with so much choice and the restaurant delicious, we will be back soon and try the spa as we didn't get a chance this time but our overall experience was just amazing, they obviously put great taught into what customers want but it's the hands on genuine care that the staff provide that make this 5 star resort what it is, can't wait to come back!",5,2014,10,19
238,Exceptional,"From the moment we arrived the staff were so welcoming and friendly. We were on honeymoon and we got an amazing suite, the food was Excellent and it was great resort to relax. We will definately be back. Would highly recommend it. Best hotel i have ever stayed in by far. Thanks guys",5,2014,10,15
238,Beautiful hotel,"This is a true 5 star hotel. Greeted us with hot towels; just left the luggage and the car outside and they unpacked it and delivered luggage and parked car- and no hand outstretched for a tip, in fact he declined one! The rooms are large, beautifully appointed, comfortable beds. Great food and drink and service. We'd come back anytime!!! ",5,2014,10,14
238,Excellent,"We got married in the Druids Glen in Nov 13 and all I can say is excellent. The staff and service make this hotel one of the best hotels I have every stayed at and really enjoy going back. Friends and family still talk about the food and service.
Not only a fabulous luxury hotel, the decor is relaxing and cosy and I love the location. 
Ca't wait to go back and visit for our anniversary and continue to return for years to come. 
Highly recommended. ",5,2014,10,12
238,Superb hotel,I have just returned from a 3 night stay in druids glen and felt I had to write a review! It was our first family holiday with our baby who is 4 months old and I couldn't have asked for a nicer stay! The staff deserve most of the credit as each and every one of whom we came into contact with was so lovely! A special mention to the lovely women at breakfast! The breakfasts were one of the best we have experienced! A great selection and I was so impressed they even had an area designated for coeliacs which was a real treat for me! We ate in the bar on two nights and that was probably the only thing I found disappointing I had the chicken tikka and I just thought it was a bit tasteless but my husband had the fish and chips which he couldn't fault! We also had the chicken wings which I thought would be better but the veg soup was delicious! I feel bad saying anything negative about this hotel because otherwise it was faultless! We had dinner in the restaurant too and it was delicious! This hotel is also a great base for visiting all that Wicklow has to offer! There is loads I have not mentioned about this hotel but go discover I promise you will not be disappointed! We hope to visit again next year ,5,2014,10,08
238,Exceptional,"We arrived at the Druid's Glen on Saturday afternoon. We were offered steamed hand cloths soaked in lavender (just what I needed after a car journey) and assistance with our bags up to our room. However, we declined as we didn't have that much with us. The suite was exceptional and we were greeted with Prosecco and scrumptious Butler's chocolates with a lovely card welcoming us to the hotel. 

The range of choices for breakfast are far beyond that of other hotels. I could have pancakes with a choice of toppings! 

The swimming pool and sauna wasn't all that busy so we could enjoy our time there without children splashing around.

The walk around the grounds was lovely and brought you to the old house which is now the golf house.

I'm aware they recently hired a new chef and the food has vastly improved since last year. Thinking about it now makes me hungry!

The customer service has also greatly improved since last year. The staff get to know your name in the short time frame and greet you with such ease it really is refreshing. The customer service is very natural and you can tell that the staff enjoy their job.

I had an appointment at the spa and I didn't want to leave. The ladies were there to put you at ease and you felt like a new person leaving.

The hotel really focus' on the little details. We were offered bottles of water for our car journey on departure. Druid's Glen chocolates and a book mark was left on our side table on our last night. Nightly we received an update for the weather and suggestions on what we could do in the area the next day.

I am going back in November and I am counting down the minutes. I cannot say what an exceptional hotel this is - we were spoilt rotten!",5,2014,10,07
238,Great weekend venue,"Enjoyed a  great weekend in this hotel, a girls away break.  The Spa treatments were great,  good value, good experience and lovely staff.  The staff in general were so helpful and obviously good training has been provided.  The food was the unexpected bonus for me, a fine dining experience with beautiful food, beautifully presented.  There was entertainment in the bar on Sat night, not too loud and the guy was excellent, great repetorie and well delivered.  Pool/sauna/steamroom provided the perfect refresshing start to Sunday morning, all clean, well maintained, thsi followed by a great breakfast (lots of tasty options on offer).  Located in the very pretty, scenic North Wicklow, yet only a quick hop from Dublin, back at Heuston station in 30 mins on Sunday.  It seems to offer something for everyone, of course Golf which was not on our list this visit maybe next time, lots of families here also.  A great location highly recommend it.",5,2014,10,06
238,Bar food at the hotel was poor,"My husband and I have been to the Druids glen a few times before and decided to pop in for lunch at the bar. We have always had very good service and the food was top notch, however my experience on Saturday afternoon was very disappointing to say the least. First of all the usual fish and chips which featured on the menu was no longer available so I chose some prawns on the lunch menu. My husband ordered a soup and a healthy salad, called ""a super salad"". I was disappointed with the waiting staff on the day, as there were dirty dishes standing on our table which they failed to clear even after they came to take our orders. I eventually asked the waiter to clear them but he only removed some of the items. My prawns were smothered in mayonnaise on two pieces of cold bread straight from the fridge and a few leaves between them. 12 euros for that. When I cut the bread it just crumbled into bits which happens to cold, stale bread from the fridge. My husband did not enjoy both his salad and soup and had a runny tummy hours later when we got home. The waiting staff were not very attentive but I presume they must have been short staff or just over tired. This was the worst service I have had at the Druids glen and I am reluctant to ever return. Our bill came to 33 euros and I felt we could have had a better meal had we gone to the n11 petrol stop for much less. Needless to say I did not care to stay for tea and dessert.",2,2014,10,05
238,Chilled getaway,"My husband surprised me with a two night stay in Druids glen, just back and I have to say it was lovely. Our room was amazing as it was an executive suite, it was quiet enough during the day and there was a great lad singing in the bar on the Saturday night, great atmosphere, staff are lovely, hubby wanted to get in a game of golf so I joined him, gorgeous golf course. Had a lovely massage in the spa and staff there were very as well. overall a really nice place to get away from it all.",5,2014,10,01
238,Nice day out,"We golfed at Druids Glen  club a few weeks ago and it was a wonderful experience, staff were lovely and course was magnificent
we went to the club house and had a really lovely meal with some friends
a great day out had by all",5,2014,09,30
238,Fantastic stay with an 11 month old,"Hands down the best hotel/resort we have stayed in. Amazing staff, they all really made an effort with our 11 month old. Each person from check in to check out were helpful, happy and welcoming. 
Check in,
Extremely efficient, we were given our room keys, the lovely lady at reception told us about the resort and the facilities. Really helpful! We then had our bags brought up to the room by the Donegal bellman. Lovely man who chatted away and gave us more info and interacted with our son! 
Room.
The room was fine, nothing overly special to be honest but had everything we needed and was a nice size. There were two double beds in the room that we pushed together so we had some room when our sprawling son came into the bed in the mornings! Overall the rooms had nothing wrong. Just maybe hadnt the awe factor the rest of the hotel has! The one negative we had actually on the entire stay was there were large stains on the cushions on the bed! Not a huge deal really, we just threw the cushion on the chair, but given the standards the hotel had set itself throughout the rest of the hotel, this was a small let down. Again nothing major at all though and it is probably just us being picky!
Breakfast,
On the first morning we had breakfast it was a continental buffet followed by an order brekfast off a menu. Was nice, couldnt complain, coffee was nice and stong and my son had porridge which he loved!
Food,
Lovely food, again the waiter was child friendly and chatted with our son. Baby bowl brought out and had already been mashed up.... its the little things like that that make a stay and the hotel had so many of those little things. Deserts were fabulous! Will be back for these alone!
Bar,
I had a few pint over the time we spent there. The Guinness was lovely, heineken too, didnt order any wine but there seemed a nice selection.
Golf,
I played 9 holes on the Druids Glen course, I cant do it justice with a review. Its by far the best course I ahve ever played. I just regret I did not give myself more time to play the full 18. I can guarantee the next time I am back I wont make this mistake. I will have at least 2 days golf planned.
Spa,
My wife had a few treatments and I had a hot stone massage, again nothing to complain about here, Was as we expected and top notch. 
Facilities,
Here is where the hotel goes above and beyond, there is a room for baby supplies, we had everything with us but it was so reassuring to know if we needed anything it would be there. Bottle sterilisers, milk, baby food everything! Great touch. Also 2 play areas for childern, one indoor with activities for all ages from 6 months (padded play area) to teenagers (an xbox and Fifa), air hockey table etc etc. Outdoor play area with swings and slides.... rubber ground so the children wont hurt themselves if they fall... great!!
Pool,
Pool was nice, normal standard pool, nothing special but had all we wanted alongside a baby changing family room! Again Druids Glen has shown how child friendly they are! As we were with the baby we didnt get to check out the Sauna and stean rooms but they looked nice.
Management,
I believe the gentlemans name who we seen around most was Duncan, (he may be a manager) extremely helpful, constantly asking to ensure we were looked after... Ensuring we had everything we wanted/needed.Fantastic ambassador for the hotel.

In general the htoel is not cheap, but then again you get what you pay for. We were happy paying the prices as the service we received was worth it. Good job Druids Glen, you should be very proud of all of the staff as they were what makes this fantastic resort what it is! Top notch people!",5,2014,09,29
238,Great stay,"Stayed in Druids Glen for friend's wedding for one night and really enjoyed it.The hotel is very close to Dublin which is really handy,the surrounding area is quiet.The hotel itself was lovely,with a nice open reception area and very clean.As a wedding venue,it was a great choice by the couple,the staff were fantastic and very polite/quick and the food was incredible.The room we stayed in was very spacious and massive bathroom and had a great sleep in a huge bed.We had breakfast delivered too the room at the correct time and it was very nice,shower was warm and powerful,overall a fantastic experience and hopefully get back to get a round of golf in.",5,2014,09,28
238,Very disappointing...,"Myself and my sister decided to treat ourselves to a 1 night B&B dinner package last month. The hotel itself and the leisure centre were nice but unfortunately we were very disappointed with the hotel restaurant. When we went down for dinner we were put sitting in an overflow area as the restaurant was full, and it was very cold and lacked atmosphere. There was an external door that kept opening and closing behind us and when we asked politely, if we could move a few tables over, to get out of the draught, we were told that we could not. We asked again politely if we could speak to the restaurant manager in relation to this, we were also told we could not. Eventually we were moved into the main restaurant area, which was much better, but our starters did not arrive for an hour and it was nearly 2 hours before we had our main courses. The food itself was just ok, definitely not a 5 star standard. In fact the hotel itself is definitely not up to the standard of a 5 star and is perhaps living on it's reputation and has let standards slide. I stayed in the nearby 4 star Glenview a few weeks previous to this with a friend, and the food and customer service were far superior....pity!",3,2014,09,24
238,Lovely retreat,"My fiance and I recently spent two nights in Druids Glen after wining a competition with the Irish Times.  Maybe my opinion was coloured somewhat by the fact that the trip was completely free but I thought Druids Glen was a really fantastic place to spend a weekend.  Whilst it is a resort hotel rather than a romantic get away, the grounds are lovely (helped by the wonderful weather we had) the staff are very friendly and the food in the Brasserie was delicious.  Our room was extremely spacious and comfortable, made all the nicer by the champagne and strawberries that greated us on arrival!  I would definitely like to return to Druids Glen, even if it would mean having to pay for it ourselves!!",4,2014,09,24
238,Excellent hotel,"This was my 3rd stay at this hotel and it never disappoints. The customer service is truly memorable and always is that way. They clearly take pride in it and it's impeccable. 
The rooms are top notch. Have stayed in a double twin, a double and a suite on the three occasions and all lovely. Breakfast is excellent. Lots of choice and plenty of it.
Didn't eat in the restaurant this time but I have previously and its up there with the best of restaurants I've eaten in. High quality food. 
I've eaten in the bar a number of times and it's great food. They have a big room with comfy couches, it's like a sun room which opens on to a terrace overlooking the course. Sun beams into it and it's really nice. 
Played the Druids Glen course on my most recent visit. It's as good as any I have played, really well kept and top drawer holes all the way through. 
Can't recommend this place highly enough. ",5,2014,09,24
238,So relaxing,"Myself and my boyfriend went for a one night stay with dinner included in the package, we also booked in for treatments in the spa. When we arrived we were checked in and our bags taken as our room wasn't ready, when we got to our room is was large and spacious with the most comfortable bed. After our treatments in the spa (the staff were really lovely) we had a really relaxing time in the jacuzzi, sauna, steam room. Dinner was delicious, lots of choice and the portions were just right. There is a cocktail on the menu called Tom Collins - if you like gin this is amazing, even if you don't like gin you should still try it. So good! We had breakfast served to our room next morning although it did not arrive on time and we had to ring to check where it was after a while. It is not a cheap place to eat/drink. You need to bring a good amount of money but it is a very relaxing place with beautiful surroundings. A really good recharge break. Also I would like to mention the lady who served us at dinner, she was lovely and had a great personality which just made us feel even more at ease. Would definitely return again but the only thing that would make me hesitant is the price. The only negatives were the walls in the hotel rooms are very thin we could hear every word the next room were saying and there were a lot of spiders and cobwebs in the hotel, especially on the curtain railings and in the bar there were huge spiders up near the ceiling and on the windows.",4,2014,09,21
238,"Amazing start to finish, ","This resort is just perfect, myself and my husband discovered it on a break away just the to of us and then decoded to return with our kids for a short break. Each time we visited as just a couple and as a family, this resort ticks every Box, there was always something for the kids to do and stay entertained yet also so peaceful and relaxing at the same time. I actually cannot wait for my next stay here, hopefully in a couple of Weeks ",5,2014,09,21
238,3 Night family break - thoroughly enjoyed it,"Went to Druids Glen Resort in July for a 3 night break with our 2 children (aged 5 and 3).  We wanted somewhere that was Family friendly with a bit of luxury also.  It was perfect.  On arrival we were given hot towels at reception to freshen up and the girls were given little activity packs with colours etc.  Our room had 2 double beds, very comfortable.  Plenty of TV channels and a DVD Player in our room.  Kids could pick out DVDs from Reception in the evening. Breakfast was a buffet with a great selection of food.  We had dinner included in our package so we dined on both evenings in the Restaurant but there were plenty of other dining options if someone wanted a change on any night. Across from our bedroom was a Baby Kitchen which I had a look into.  It was spotless with a sink, fridge, sterilizer, kettle, fresh towels, microwave.  Perfect for people travelling with babies. Pool was lovely and warm, changing rooms had everything you'd need.  Didn't get to the Spa unfortunately.  Indoor Play room for kids with toys for smaller kids and gaming machines for older kids.  Outdoor playground with soft surface and secure fence around it... a really nice, well kept playground.  Overall I'd definitely come back for another visit.  Were given bottles of water on departure which was a lovely touch.",5,2014,09,20
238,Superb Hotel and Very Friendly Staff,Just back having spent 2 nights there. From the moment we arrived to the time we left we were made most welcome and more importantly wanted. Conor at reception asked us were we in the Hotel before and we said no that we were there celebrating our Wedding Anniversary and within an hour a card and Box of Butlers Chocolates were sent to the room courtesy of the management. The food in the Brasserie and also in the Bar was superb as was the Breakfast in the morning. Health Spa and swimming pool great and Hotel in General was spotless. Special mention must go to Teague at the door who was most welcoming and always spoke to us whenever we passd by him. Also Kevin and Darren in the Bar/Restaurant who were great craic and of course Sonny who was always in good form. Looking forward to returning in the near future and have got to say it is great value for money.,5,2014,09,18
238,Fantastic!,"My husband and I have just spent 3 days here and I can't rate it highly enough. Spacious rooms, hot showers and inclusive breakfast, gym, spa, golf, cycling, the list goes on.  The staff were extremely helpful and friendly.  All the public areas are clean and well maintained.  I am very fussy but I would stay here again without a doubt.  Only negatives were that we found the mattress topper rather big and poofy for our liking and the bedding - which is quite possibly high-quality cotton - rather noisy/rustly.",5,2014,09,17
238,Top 4 star hotel,Stayed at the hotel for  two days in the middle of August  with  a wedding group . Everything was just perfect and we stayed in a suite which was very well laid out with a TV in the sitting as well as the bedroom also a DVD player. The bathroom was large with very good lighting and  nice toiletries supplied. The bed was confortable and any special requests were attended to promptly. There was a good quality coffee maker in the room as well  All the staff were very professional and friendly especially the  manager (a Turkish gentleman). Breakfast was excellent as was dinner they also had a barbecue on Saturday which is on the decking at the back of the hotel. We did not avail of the spa or golf facilities. We will certainly return to stay here again,5,2014,09,17
238,Wonderful Hotel,"Just home after spending a wonderful night in Druids Glen. This was our first visit and definately will not be our last. Hotel staff are wonderful, friendly and helpful. Room was bright and spacious and the swimming pool and spa welcoming. The biggest surprise was the food at dinner, it was absolutely fabulous. Cant wait to return",5,2014,09,17
238,spellbound,"Stayed for 2 nights with my husband as an anniversary treat. Service exceptional. All staff said hello and were very friendly. The deluxe room and bathroom were spacious. Delightful view of trees and gardens. Health suite was really nice and kept spotless. Dinner in the brasserie on first night was excellent. Very romantic atmosphere and attentive staff. Ate in the  bar second night which was fine too.
Really couldn't fault the place. The staff were exceptional. I can only imagine when its busy things would slow down. They were dealing with a large wedding on Saturday night and kept apologising for delay at dinner but we hadn't even noticed! 
Can't wait to return.",5,2014,09,16
238,Amazing stay ,The Druids Glen Resort is a wonderful hotel. The staff are so friendly and helpful. The rooms are so spacious with amazing views of the mountains and the gold course. The food is outstanding and the waiting on staff couldn't do enough for you. I would so recommend the Resort. Would I come to stay again defiantly. ,5,2014,09,14
238,"5* Service, 4* property","We recently stayed here with our 3 year old daughter. The staff are excellent in every area. We had dinner in the bar and also in the restaurant. The food is good, not a very extensive menu though. The wine list needs improving particularly in the bar, choice is extremely limited. Breakfast was ok. The rooms are very average, I had a particular problem with the shower as it ran from blistering hot to freezing and was actually unusable. I ended up having a bath. Also, the air conditioning unit was extremely noisy all night. The facilities for kids are great and the level of service is excellent. Rooms could be better and menu could do with some more choice.",4,2014,09,12
238,2 Day Break,"We stayed in Druids Glen for 2 nights as a little break away from the day to day hustle and bustle of work. We had stayed here before and we were really looking forward to our break here again. Overall our stay was very enjoyable. The only complaints I had were minor but worth pointing out, the first morning we went down for breakfast we were met by a pretty grumpy chef, and we were disappointed to learn that there were no sausages in the hot buffet. we ate both nights in the bar restaurant on both occasions, we found ourselves waiting quite some time for staff to give us menus, take our orders, clear our plates and finally pay our bill. The second night seemed to be worse as for a long period of time we were waiting for someone to take our order. I would stay here again but I just thought it was worth mentioning the areas were we felt need improving.",4,2014,09,11
238,Wonderful Staff,My fiancé and I stayed here in August. Everyone was so welcoming. The rooms were lovely. The bar and restaurant were very relaxed. It looked like it had lots of facilities for kids. I would definitely stay here again and would highly recommend it to anyone.  ,5,2014,09,11
238,Excellent 5 star rooms and service. And child friendly.,"Great big modern rooms and bathrooms. Nice bar, restaurant and decking area. Breakfast was great. Nice walks in grounds. Well setup for children with kitchenette, playroom and playground. But don't worry, its not overrun with kids either!!

All the staff were very nice and helpful. Special mention for Gita, our little girl is missing her already.

Leisure centre was very good with large pool, jacuzzi, stream rooms, saunas and cold plunge pool. Not quite as fancy as some other 5 stars, but no complaints and the family changing room was great. Gym looked good as well.",5,2014,09,08
238,Very nice stay,"We were here for a conference, and had a very enjoyable stay.  Lovely modern property with spacious rooms.  The staff were excellent, and very helpful with any questions or concerns.  The resort had good suggestions about local attractions.",4,2014,09,08
238,Wonderful place,Great time but a little isolated if you aren't playing golf.   Ask for Teague to assist you with day trips.   Lenny drove us to Glendalough and Powers court Gardens.    He was so sweet and had many wonderful stories!  It's a beautiful place.    The breakfast is great too.   ,5,2014,09,07
238,Excellent stay,"Thanks to Druids Glen for an excellent stay. I had a standard ground floor room with a limited view but it was large with a beautiful bed. 
The staff are wonderful & the food great in the bar. The service is great with staff who go the extra mile. 
I was there for business but it has won awards for being family friendly. Clearly a hotel for golfers and spa lovers! 
The hotel will arrange trips etc for you which when it is so well placed is great!
Definitely stay here. ",5,2014,09,06
238,Lovely golf resort,"Our group enjoyed a really great golf holiday and a fantastic service in Druids Glen Resort. Personal were so helpfull and willing to make us comfortable. They introduced new ideas and resolved all possible questions. More helpful staff than these do not exist!

Rooms were spacious and every detail in rooms were very well thouhgt. Very good and elegant food. Golf courses were so beautiful and in excellent shape (but demanding!).",5,2014,09,04
238,Great Anniversary Weekend,"My wife and I enjoyed a fantastic 2 night break for our 1st wedding anniversary at the start of august.  From the moment we arrived we could tell we were in a 5 star hotel.  The attention to detail from the staff in welcoming and acknowledging the guests was second to none.  We were handed a leaflet upon checking in, which advised what there was to do in the area, this was very beneficial to us.  
Our room was beautiful and very spacious, the bed was very spacious and very comfy.  Bathroom again very luxurious.  Everything was immaculate.  
The leisure facilities were great aswell, we enjoyed the pool, Jacuzzi, sauna, steam room and plunge pool (its not for the faint hearted, lol).  
I must mention Duncan McAlpine the guest relations manager who couldn't do enough for us, a selection of deserts and an anniversary card was personally delivered by Duncan to the room, great service.  
We also enjoyed the meal in the restaurant, where again the food was delicious and you knew you were eating in a 5 star hotel.  The breakfast again was fantastic and couldn't fault the selection available.
All in all this is the best hotel we have stayed in throughout the UK and Ireland, would definitely recommend this to anyone, and thanks again Duncan for everything that you and your staff did throughout or stay which made it so enjoyable and memorable.  We look forward to returning again in the future.",5,2014,09,02
238,"Fantastic food, accommodation and spa treatments","What a night. First of all headed to Spa where I had neck, shoulder & back massage, pedicure and facial all for €105. Great value for all my treatments. Excellent. Josephine was my therapist best ever. Recommend Josephine. Went out to the restaurant in hotel and staff were always checking were we ok. Lovely staff. Food was best I have tasted in long time. There were 4 of us 2 couples.... I had monkfish to start with the presentation was wow. Then we were presented with a coconut sorbet compliments of the chef delicious. The others all had beef and I had lamb very tender. Unable to have desserts as so full. My friends had the crime brûlée. Looked v nice. We were last to leave restaurant, hotel was v busy with 2Golden Jubilee Anniversaries celebrations, wedding with 180 guests and normal hotel guests. Great ambiance. The rooms were enormous with 2 double beds and en suite with shower and bath and all the lovely toiletries. Breakfast only delicious served til 11am. Even had pancake maker with chef doing them for you. Top compliments to all the staff from Butler to maitre d to waiters, chef and therapists. Thank you. Great night and treat. Caitriona",5,2014,09,01
238,More helpful staff than these do not exist!,"We have just had a really outstanding long weekend experience at this hotel.  From the check in to the check out, every staff member that we had an interaction with was on the top end of the ""really great service"" scale.  This level of service has to come from somebody setting a really good tone at the top becuase there was real belief in this service level and it was uncompromising.  

I could not have enjoyed this weekend more to be honest. 

Food was good,  breakfast was really lovely,  the papers were numberous,  the room decor was lovely quality  the building functions really well,  everything here is good.

One example of the extra mile that staff went was to find us a gift bag and a ""good luck"" card for a wedding that we were going to,  it was just given to us with such kindness.

Well done Druid's Glen.  We will be back.",5,2014,09,01
238,Lots of little touches .....,"From pulling up at the door the service was excellent, The car door was opened we were escorted to check in, our luggage put on a trolley and shown to our room, and shown the facilities in the room,  The car was parked and the key left on reception for us.
The room was excellent.  The only downside was the door had to be slammed shut which did mean we were woken by other doors shutting at night.  Breakfast excellent. Check out smooth, water provided for our onward journey lots of lovely touches.",5,2014,08,31
238,Return Visit ,Had a lovely lunch last weekend . Once again the service was excellent . The food was as always very good . The setting looking over the golf course was very relaxing . Thank you to the whole team who once again made our experience of lunch enjoyable .,5,2014,08,30
238,superb,"Staff could not be more helpful and polite....lovely hotel and facilities. very child friendly. buffet breakfast is very good. I really could not find fault with this hotel, we will most definitely be back!",5,2014,08,30
238,Lovely stay and nice attention to detail,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for 2 nights in July and we had a lovely time and would definitely recommend the hotel to others. The hotel offers extra touches that we hadn't experienced in  other 5 star hotels, such as giving you a warm face cloth on arrival and bottled water on your journey home. Each morning, we also received a little note through the door with the weather forecast and things to do in the area for that day, which I thought was a lovely touch. 
The bed was really big and comfortable with a nice big flatscreen TV on the wall. Our room was clean and tastefully furnished, staff were all very friendly and always greeted us in the corridor. The food was really nice and they had an open barbecue on one of the nights we were there which was a nice idea. You can also avail of the bikes outside the hotel which are free of charge and good fun if you want to take a quick spin around the hotel. There was also wifi included in the rate which both myself and my partner could use at the same time which was great.
All in all we had a lovely time, the hotel is particularly family friendly so I would definitely recommend it for families with young children.  
The only comment I would make is that although it is 5 star, the rooms and bathroom don't really have the wow factor that you would perhaps want from a 5 star hotel, so I think the rooms are more 4 star.",4,2014,08,29
238,Luxury child friendly resort,"1st luxury hotel we have stayed at that truly welcomes children. Great location with lots around including Dublin Zoo, beaches, Clara Lara Funpark, Powerscourt. Check in fantastic with person coming out from behind desk to welcome children and us, giving the children colouring packs and us hot towels. Concierge so helpful throughout - brought our bags to our room, showed us main features of our room, always said hello to us and children and gave us great information for our trip to Clara Lara. We had a suite which was huge and meant separate room for kids. Indoor playroom great to have after dinner. Pool good size and staff helpful. Restaurant food is top class as is service, at dinner and breakfast. Staff couldn't do enough for us and kids. Great variety of food for kids. Bar busy but once got a seat had a great meal. Didn't try park or grounds outside but looked good. Can't wait to go back!",5,2014,08,28
238,Wonderful hospitality,"The welcome and attention to detail by all the staff, from room staff to general manager was quite exceptional. Nothing was too much trouble, greetings were always forthcoming, cheerful and friendly, and more to the point, appropriate. The rooms were beautiful, spacious and immaculately clean and tidy. Restaurant and bar facilities first rate, and again the staff were more than helpful. If you are hungry, then book an early time, as the service always gives plenty of time between courses to allow digestion and conversation, not a bad thing. Good selection of food and wine.
We would certainly return to this hotel in the future.",5,2014,08,28
238,The extra touches sets it apart for others!,"I have recently returned from a 2 night stay at the beautiful Druids Glen Resort  It is the extra touches that really do set is apart from other lovely hotels, like the hot flannels on arrival, the bottles of water on check out for your onward journey, DVD players in every room and a well stocked DVD library at reception.  The hotel is stunning, the service superb and the food quite exceptional. I was there the middle of August and there were lots of small children there.  This wasn't a problem for me but as another review has suggested if you would like to go at a quieter time choose off peak.",5,2014,08,28
238,Loved everything about our stay!,Rooms are great.  Sheets wonderful. Very casual and comfortable with a five star rating.  Best facial I ever had.  Golfed the club and the nearby European course. The food in bar and restaurant were both great.  Plenty to do at the resort for the day while the boys golfed. Biked to the closely beach which I really enjoyed.,5,2014,08,27
238,Superb hotel. Well worth a visit!,"Stayed in Druids Glen for the second time in July with my family. An outstanding hotel in every way,in a great location to explore beautiful Co Wicklow!
Will definitely be back! Roll on the holidays!if you get an opportunity don't miss the barbeque.",5,2014,08,27
238,Pick your time carefully,"Lovely hotel and only 40 mins from south Dublin. As well as spa treatments there is a golf course (and here is the difference to other like hotels),you can go for a walk of 4 km around the course inside the boundary walls or, if preferred, you can borrow one of the hotel's bikes, free of charge. The rooms are all spacious and well laid out. My only problem, and hence the title of this review, very very noises with lots of young children using the common areas and bar as play ground. Staff aware of this and tried to seat couples in one area of restaurant. Food ok but a little overpriced in restaurant. Maybe, if bar not so busy food there would be of better value. So visit off peak.",4,2014,08,26
238,Excellent reception staff,Stayed here for 2 nights midweek. Had phoned around a few hotels at the last minute & this was the only one who got back to me ?? Excellent checking in experience with a lady called Jo. Room was nice but probably not as large/luxurious as I expected for a 5*. I didn't find the tea making facilities until I was leaving.The bathroom was badly laid out with toilet right against the shower cubicle. The beds were lovely & comfortable & they provided a roll away bed for my teenage daughter as the 2 doubles were pretty small (no additional charge)  The room was an adjoining one & we could hear the small kids next door very clearly the next morning :(  We had a problem with the air conditioning on the first night but this was rectified as soon as I raised it. Bar service wasn't that efficient even though there appeared to be ample staff. We had bar food the second night as we were a bit late getting back to hotel & it was tasty. The guy that served us was really friendly  & compensated for the the rest of the bar staff. Was disappointed  there was no entertainment in the hotel despite being told when booking that there would be after the BBQ.The hotel lacked atmosphere in the evenings. Breakfast was lovely with very attentive staff. The walk in the grounds was a bit confusing as I ended up on the main road perhaps better signs would help ( I spoke to three others who did the same thing) The location of hotel was very central to lots of different tourist attractions. The hotel seems to attract a lot of families with small children.,4,2014,08,25
238,Sheer luxury,"From the moment we walked in to reception, we were bowled over by the luxury of this hotel. Ended up being upgraded to a suite which was amazing. When we returned to the room at night, our curtains were drawn and a bedside note and chocolate were left for us and softer lighting switched on. Breakfast was off the scale, every possible taste catered for with the freshest of foods. Definitely will return. So handy to use as a  central point to explore Wicklow and wexford.",5,2014,08,25
238,Most certainly not worthy of a 5 star rating,"I had heard rave reviews about this resort and upon seeing and being told it was a 5 star hotel and that the Irish open had been held at its Glen course I was excited to go.
Upon arrival everything looked amazing from the drive through the gates right up to the front of the hotel, the views are breath taking, my wife and I were checked where upon the receptionist was very polite and offered us a hot face wash towel fantastic I thought yep most certainly worthy of 5 stars so far, 3 or 4 places to eat happy days I'm thinking.
So my wife goes to the room whilst I go and unpack the car with the help of Duncan (guest relations manager) who was very nice and explained about the glen course and a few other interesting things again I'm thinking this is great. We arrive to my room and Duncan explains about the room, he opens the mini bar fridge, it's not stocked 😔 he then shows us where the kettle, tea and coffee are kept (hidden away) again my impression is starting to dwindle but hey not to worry.

So we decide to go to the pool, we put on our nice fresh robe and slippers and head off to be told on arrival ""Sorry sir we are full to capacity, we can phone you in about 10 mins and you can come back"" so we head back to our room to head back 15 mins later eventually get in to the pool at about 6pm-ish to find it full of screaming children. Not impressed that they don't have separate times for families and those without children to enjoy the pool and relax.

So after about 30mins of bearing up with screaming children jumping and bombing in the pool we head back to our room to get ready for dinner which is a BBQ which was all you can eat for €25 not bad we thought would have been better had there been a better choice but it was ok as for desert there was only 2 choices - Not impressed as far as food selection goes.

The room was what you would expect from a 3/4 star hotel not a 5 star hotel the balcony door would not lock, we was told that we had a ""Golf Course View"" we could just see part of a green and a flag, the bed was comfy enough mind you and we both had a good nights sleep only to be woken by screaming children running up and down the corridor leads to a very unhappy me.

Breakfast was average considering g again this was meant to be a 5 star resort, there was a larger selection of cereals and fruits than cooked stuff, there was none of your Irish Soda or Potato bread very sad to see that wasn't on offer. Evening meal again was a let down by the lack of choice for a 5 star resort, the lack of choice for desert and even main course, you didn't feel like you was in a 5star resort by the service you was getting or should I say not getting.

My wife and I went out for the day and came back at around 6pm to get ready for dinner to see that our room had been serviced but no fresh bed sheets, my wife knew this because she had make up on her pillow and sheets plus a toe diamond still in the bed also no condiments had been replaced, we didn't say anything as we wanted to see if this would be rectified the following morning, to which it was not.

All in all I was very very let down by the resort and it was and isn't most certainly worthy of its 5 star rating a 3 star maybe 4 at best, but then you pay for what you get and our stay was not that expensive considering it was again meant to be 5 star.

The only good thing I can say about this location is the view is breath taking and the Druids Glen Golf course is superb and well worth playing for all golfers, other than that my wife and felt very let down.",3,2014,08,23
238,Our new favourite hotel..,5 star at its best. Staff so nice to the children. Food excellent and not too expensive. BBQ on terrace superb... Excellent facilities for children... they have thought of everything. We were very impressed and we'll be back.,5,2014,08,23
238,Great hotel but disappointing restaurant,"You may be really happy with this hotel but I value a great dining experience and unfortunately I got only an average one here despite paying a rather expensive price for a meal for two.  The hotel has an excellent staff who are friendly and anxious to please and our stay was very enjoyable and relaxing - the only time I felt that 5 star treatment was missing was in the restaurant.
The 3 course meal was 70 euro for two (ah but we ended up paying 24 euro more for side orders and wine) and children could dine from a buffet of wedges, pasta, sausages, mixed veg and some good quality chicken nuggets followed by 2 small (note again small - no biscuit crumbs or chocolate crumbs to decorate) scoops of ice cream all for 5 euro.

We waited a little too long to order and a little too long for the food.  We were offered a selection of bread  and i had some very salty slightly dry tomato bread. Not good. For a starter I had duck which arrived looking very lonely on a large slate, the portion of duck was about the size of the bottom of a small glass and about an inch high. Better order some side dishes with the mains because we were both starving.  I had the lamb (5 euro supplement), again ok but small and with some salad.  The side orders arrived (4 euro for a side order) of chips and creamed potato.  The chips were excellent, good potatoes cooked in good oil to a nice golden color. 
Dessert was lemon tart with a scoop of strawberry sorbet.  The lemon tart was delicious
and a reasonable size but ice cream would have been nicer with it and maybe a little clotted cream.  you pay 1.50 extra for a scoop of ice cream.  
Two glasses of house red wine cost 15 euro.  All in the meal cost us 94 euro for 2.  It was much too expensive for the size of the portions and the quality of the food. Some of the supplements seemed mean especially the 1.50 for the scoop of ice cream. The actual dining room was lacking in atmosphere and we were not given the little chocolate treats some places give you when you pay.  A small thing, I know, but I just didn't feel a valued customer(plus I love those little chocolates!!). It's as if they were complacent about diners' experience.

Now the actual hotel itself is very good and the beds were sooo comfortable and the rooms have a little fridge and a safe and good showers in ensuite.  The hotel facilities I could not fault and the golf course is amazing.  It's about a mile outside the village. Also breakfast is very good - although busy and we did enjoy this.",3,2014,08,22
238,Very Good But!!,"Just spent a couple of days here with my Wife and 5 year old Grandson.
Reception was great as was the Porter who went the full mile to accommodate us especially with parking.
Accommodation was excellent massive rooms with all the facilities you could ask for.
We decided to opt for the advertised BBQ on the first evening,what a mistake,a pretty poor selection of meats along with some over cooked baked potatoes and a pretty lack lustre salad followed by what can only be described as a couple of cakes masquerading as a sweet.My biggest complaint was the lack of seating the adjoining bar was packed which left the BBQ area which was also packed,not a very good experience.
Breakfast was very good plenty of choice from the hot buffet and breads and juices.
The swimming pool was rather small and very crowded.
Dinner on the second night was taken in the Brasserie,buffet selection for the kids and a minute for the Adults that's when things started to go downhill.
Eventually a drink order was taken followed by another wait for our food order.
Service in my opinion was very slow although the food when it was served was of a good standard we thought that we were being treated as second class guests because we had children with us.
It was apparent that other ""Grown Up Guests"" were treated in a different manner.
All in all a pretty good stay but there are areas which need to be addressed mainly the lack of table seating and the attitude of the waiting staff in the dining room.
No doubt if we returned as adults we would probably have a different experience. ",4,2014,08,21
238,For golfers everywhere,"If you are looking for a superb golf break, look no further. Superb hotel, 2 wonderful golf courses, Druids Glen has to be played to be believed. Great deals if you are prepared to look, Your Golf Travel.com is very hard to beat. We enjoyed it so much last year we came back this year. Food and service is second to none. Would recommend Druids Glen to anybody, don't miss out",5,2014,08,21
238,A gastronomical delight,"From the moment we sat down at our table in the beautiful Druids glen brasserie restaurant waited on by the friendly and super efficient Maeve,a gastronomical experience like no other awaited us- malek homidouche, the executive head chef ensured that our dining experience was quite simply stunning and for this I humbly thank you- I am already excited about returning- thanks to all Yvonne Redmond",5,2014,08,21
238,A stay that tantalised the taste buds..,"Absolutely outstanding experience.. Thanks to Malek Hamidouche, executive chef, this was the best meal I've had in a very long time.. I thought nevin maguires macnean house could never be beaten but druids brasserie proved me wrong.. We were treated like royalty by our waitress maeve and were overwhelmed by all the added extras to our meal.. A mouth watering meal from start to finish.. Thanks to all.. Cannot wait to return and will definitely do so asap..Laura Keegan",5,2014,08,21
238,"Nice rooms, not for couples","We visited Druids Glen for our anniversary in August. We left our kids at home and initial impressions were good. Reception is a nice space and the rooms are great however we did not anticipate the amount of families with young kids roaming the hotel. There are good walks around the golf course and if you are a golfer then this could be for you but if you don't want golf or to see children during your stay I wouldn't advise it. The staff are excellent, nothing was too difficult and they had no problem asking families to switch off any devices their children may have been using to watch videos during dinner. Overall I don't think I would be coming back without children and if myself or my wife take up golf in the future we may consider it.",3,2014,08,21
238,Well run hotel ,"We stayed here recently for a night and it was excellent. It was the staff to us that made it 5 star. It was a very busy day there, Sunday lunch in the pub seems to be popular and a lot  of children about the place. This may not suit everyone. We had dinner in restaurant and it was very nice as was breakfast and staff were extremely attentive esp during dinner. Several staff members, some being managers asked how our dinner was and they seem to be listening carefully to people who might have had a complaint. I haven't seen such interest in guests  before in a hotel. 
There was a small mix up with our room and as a result we were asked if we would like a bottle of prosecco or wine.  We said there was no need but shortly afterwards a bottle was sent to our room with chocolate covered strawberries. This was a very nice gesture and we were very impressed from word go. We really felt that our stay with them was important from word go. You basically felt special and this hospitality is not to be found everywhere. This is a hotel that is well run and the guest is king/queen. Well worth a visit. ",5,2014,08,20
238,Fabulous stay,"From the moment you step into the foyer you have 5 star hospitality. The best check in service and hospitality that I have ever received in a hotel in Ireland. Baggage was taken and stowed while we waited on our room to be available. So we sat on the terrace and enjoyed a drink and some lunch. 
Then when we were shown to our room we were not disappointed super comfy bed and really spacious room. We also had a spa treatment which was excellent. 
We stayed for one night with dinner and breakfast which was a great deal. We went for a couples night away . At the dinner our server was excellent. Full of jovial conversation and asked were we staying for a special occasion it so happened that we were staying for my husbands birthday. We ordered our meal which was superb. Great menu choices and chef specialities. And most important for me a great Spanish red wine. When we ordered the dessert out came a birthday candle in the hubby's cheese cake and a sing song. This for me says a lot of how attentive the staff are to the guest and it was a really special touch that would make me go back.
Overall a truly pleasant stay and I will be booking a family stay very soon. Many thanks to the great staff at druids glen for their great hospitality.",5,2014,08,19
238,Fabulously family friendly!,"A touch of class even with the kids in toe! It's a beautiful hotel, easy to get to and the staff are superb...  couldn't do enough to help! I would highly recommend this hotel and we will most definitely be back.",5,2014,08,19
238,Amazing staff,I was at a wedding in Druids glen at the weekend we stayed for 2 nights and 3 days. From the moment we pulled up in the car the staff were amazing very helpful the hotel it's self was beautiful we really enjoyed our stay the over all experience definitely was how great the staff were they were so accommodating and friendly jus made the week end perfect !!!  ,5,2014,08,18
238,Well done DG,"Stayed here as a gay couple for my brothers wedding late July. What a perfect venue. Staff excelled themselves. Food great and the rooms....WOW. Lots of children in our party and they were so welcomed.
We are considering DG as our wedding venue as a result. 
Well done Druids Glen !!",5,2014,08,18
238,Fabulous place.,"We stayed here for our wedding anniversary, and I have to say it was fab. From the time you check in till you leave. There was someone to take our luggage to the room, as we went to the bar, water in the room, tea coffee, chocolates. Ect! As we left we were given 2 bottles of water for our journey.",5,2014,08,17
238,Fabulous venue and service with a smile,Wonderful location for a family break. Beautiful facilities all superbly maintained.  Highlights included amazing dinners and faultless service from the smiling Allwyn and Peter.  Thank you both!  You made it special.  We will be back. ,5,2014,08,16
238,Fab great Hotel.,"Stayed here recently with my teenage daughter and husband. The reception staff gave us a lovely welcome and that was the beginning of a wonderful stay in this fantastic resort. The room was spacious and eventhough it had 2 double beds, it wasn't at all tight for space. I loved to sit at the little balcony with a glass of wine in the evening, it was so peaceful. We ate in both the restaurant and pub, restaurant was nice, we both had steak which was cooked to our liking but It was just average. My husband is a plain eater and found it difficult to find something he'd eat from the menu. The dessert was the BEST I've ever had anywhere though (lemon tart). Bar food was nicer than restaurant we thought and although great food, quite pricey at an average of €15-€16 for the cheapest main course. Alcohol also very expensive as would be expected, €5.50 for a pint of beer and €7 for a glass of cab. sauv (not the best wine I've had either!!!) As mentioned by others, breakfast was amazing, divine pastries, hot food etc but can be busy so don't leave till last minute if you can. We used the leisure centre a lot but can be busy with young children at allowed times, all facilities were clean and in working order. Free wifi in the room and best wifi service I've had in a hotel. All in all, I'd go back any time but eat in the local town unless the bar food was cheaper in the hotel, staff were a credit to the hotel, well done to all and it's nice to see that Irish hospitality is still alive and kicking.",5,2014,08,16
238,Experience of a lifetime,Stayed here for a family reunion and have to say it was fantastic from start to finish. We all had a great time from the kids to adults something for everyone. The staff were wonderful thank you all for a great time. I will return. ,5,2014,08,16
238,Couldn't fault a thing,"We only stayed one night and so sad we didn't book for longer. We had a beautiful suite with champagne and chocolate covered strawberries when we arrived. Leisure centre and golf were great. The dinner in the brasserie was 5 star plus. But the hotels best thing is the staff. Everyone friendly and professional. A great team. Special thanks to Reciep, peter, Ali, and Mark in the bar. Hope to go back next week with the children. ",5,2014,08,12
238,Fantastic family friendly hotel,"I stayed in this hotel with my husband and two young children, we had a fantastic time, staff were very helpful. The children's entertainment room was a great place for children to relax and the outdoor play park was brilliant. dinner in the bar was gorgeous. Would highly recommend and will definitely return again.
Thanks for a great break ",5,2014,08,12
238,5 star luxury & family focused!,"Recommended by a friend, we were intrigued to see was it really as good as they said. And YES it is every bit as good as all the reviews. 5 star through and through and cannot commend the staff enough. 
For our first family holiday- this was ideal. Every member of staff speaks to the kids as they are walking around the hotel, playground at the hotel, children welcomed everywhere. 
The rooms were fab, very clean, very modern, spacious and comfortable.

 Even though the hotel is family focused they in no way compromise on the 5 star luxury - which shines through at all times. 
We are in the bar one evening and breakfast was brilliant, such a great selection and fresh. 

Would live to return again.",5,2014,08,10
238,Fabulous,"Stayed over the the bank holiday, loved every everything. It's well run staff are excellent, from the reception, waiting staff,cleaners everyone who works there was so good,knew how to make you enjoy your stay.lt was so welcoming. Food was excellent, room excellent and clean all way through the hotel.Golf courses especially the Glen my husband had an amazing experience. Kids loved it,will definitely be back.Keep up the good work and thanks for making our stay great.",5,2014,08,09
238,Excellent Hotel,"Fantastic hotel, from the moment we arrived the staff we very welcoming and extremely accommodating. This hotel is spacious and tastefully decorated, creating a lovely relaxed atmosphere. You won’t be disappointed with either the bar or the restaurant, both of which have beautiful and interesting views. I highly recommend this hotel – great service, great food, great facilities. Looking forward to our next visit.",5,2014,08,08
238,Superb hotel,We stayed in this hotel for two nights in August with our 14 month old son and we loved every minute of our trip. We took a suite which was perfect for us as it meant we could relax in one room whilst our child slept in the other. Both rooms were enormous and spotlessly clean. The staff in this hotel seem to go out of their way to help their guests and everyone we met made us feel genuinely welcome. The hotel has great facilities and is a great base for exploring the surrounding area. The food is excellent and the breakfast has to be experienced at least once in a lifetime. We had a great time and we'll definitely be back.,5,2014,08,07
238,Sinead & Nathan's Wedding,"We arrived at reception and was greeted with a smile.. We were then given warm flannels to refresh ourselves..
Our room was clean and fresh..
The swimming pool is gorgeous.. The sauna / steam rooms and the freezing cold plunge pool are great ways to relax and enjoy..
Dining is an experience.. To being seated to being served, all who get in contact with you clearly love their job and it really shows..
My wife and I both wanted to point out one very special observation we had whilst staying at the hotel - children were made very welcome!!
The Nights entertainment was good The bar selection was vast.. We could've stayed all night all day..
We woke after a fabulous sleep we use the sports facilities which set you up for the day..
Breakfast was another and amazing experience.. Full Irish cooked breakfast was amazing.. The continental buffet was extensive.. And of course not to forget served with a smile from all staff..
My wife and I both wanted to make a special mention to the restaurant manager,""you have a great team please thank them for us and the way you went and looked after the three children and getting them a DVD player to use whilst the mother and family friends all had dinner was a real heart felt gesture""
To sum it all up ""The hotel and its facilities are fabulous but what really makes it is the staff 10 out of 10,  100% """,5,2014,08,06
238,Gorgeous,"Stayed here for a family wedding. A stunning hotel with great grounds for golf. Rooms were lovely and clean and spacious also. Some family members had a suite and this was also beautiful. Super fine touches such as hot refreshing towels for your hands on check-in, magazines in the room for some light reading. Great food for breakfast and a great function room and pre-reception area where we had a chocolate fountain, a cupcake stand and a Druids Glen very own ice cream stand before the main reception.",5,2014,08,05
238,Wedding,"Stayed at this hotel from 1/8 to 3/8 asked for wheelchair accessible room when booking well the bathroom totally inadequate made my stay very uncomfortable & I felt very anxious about falling over.
When you ask for a wheelchair accessible room you expect more than a wide door not impressed at all
People say things about Travelodge but their bathroom for wheelchair access was 1st class",3,2014,08,05
238,Family Break Away,"Recent family celebration was a great success due to the wonderful stay at this hotel.  I had been to this hotel years ago on a business trip and was not convinced that it would be suitable for our wide range of ages (18 of us aged 6 - 70 years old).  So I was pleasantly surprised to find it now completely family friendly - swimming pool, den and playgrounds for the younger ones - bike hire for the active teenagers - golf for the lads - fantastic spa for the tired mums!  The bar food was amazing, catering for all needs while the restaurant food and service excellent.  The staff were so accommodating particularly with the kids.  Perfect location for a day trip to the fabulous Mount Usher Gardens and Wicklow Gaol.  Highly recommended!",5,2014,08,05
238,fall under the spell is accurate!,"I had a fantastic stay at the Druids Glen. The location, the service, the spa and most of all the staff were all excellent. 
The staff couldn't do enough to help, at any time, with anything. They were also friendly and happy to chat. 
We ate outside most evenings, overlooking the gold course. Food was excellent, and good portion sizes. I had a treatment in the spa, a luxury pedicure and eye mask, and I felt truly relaxed by the end of it. The facilities were very good too, I used both the gym and the pool regularly. 
Would 100% return!",5,2014,08,05
238,Treated like royalty ,"Stayed here for bank holiday Sunday night that I had booked it as part of proposing to my girlfriend! 
When we arrived we found we had been upgraded to a suite which included a card and chocolates on arrival which was a wonderful surprise which made the night even more special! 

Staff were wonderful in all areas we visited, reception, bar, restaurant, spa and leisure centre 

Never got the chance to play golf but the course looked amazing  ",5,2014,08,04
238,Great break away!,"My husband and I are just back from a stay in Druids Glen, and I can highly recommend it.  Check in was seamless and all the reception staff are really very pleasant.  We both thoroughly enjoyed the stay - the golf on the Glen Course I am told is definitely worth the trip.  For me I can definitely recommend the spa - so relaxing and everyone there are so nice.  Nothing is too much trouble and the food is also a hit.  We didn't have any children with us but from looking around it seems to me that Druid's Glen is very family orientated with many many families around - all smiling faces.

I would happily recommend Druid's Glen for a relaxing few days away and I hope to be able to return for another visit very soon.",5,2014,08,04
238,"Family friendly, quality hotel ","Spent 2 nights here on a family break last week and we had a wonderful stay.   This is a lovely resort in scenic wicklow and despite it's fairly grand ambience and setting it is first class in terms of being family friendly with staff providing a very warm welcome to families.

The staff overall are excellent, the rooms very clean and of a high standard.  The kids room 'Druids Den' is quite small but very well done and it is easy to see why the hotel is popular with all ages/groups etc including young families.

",5,2014,08,03
238,Fabulous hotel,"My husband and I and 3 children stayed in this hotel in July 2014 and we couldn't have been more impressed with the hotel facilities,  the wonderful staff who are so helpful and the fantastic location. 
The hotel is super for families.  I can't wait to come back again with the children.
I really love this hotel!",5,2014,08,02
238,highly recommend,"Stayed in this beautiful hotel this week, I would highly recommend a couple of nights, staff, hotel and food and drink all brilliant! We arrived late in the day, so make it worth your while try and get there early to make the best of the surrounding area.",5,2014,07,31
238,The most fantastic experience,"This resort is for anyone - not only the golfer.  From the time we arrived until our sad departure our experience was the best we had ever experienced.  Rooms well fitted with all amenities, restaurant and bars offered delicious menus, grounds were beautifully landscaped.  The spa was also one of the best my sister and I have had.  Most of all the staff could not do enough for you (without making you uncomfortable).  Set in a lovely county (Wicklow) and within easy driving distant of Wicklow and some really lovely villages.  Their website is also easy to navigate and contains excellent driving instructions so no lost time finding them.  I would give this 20 stars if I could.",5,2014,07,26
238,Amazing hotel,"We have been to this hotel on a few occasions now,both for weddings and leisure and will definitely return again. The hotel itself as well as the grounds are gorgeous,the food is exceptional and the biggest compliment I can give is to the staff.Nothing is too much trouble and always completed with a warm smile. Huge selection for breakfast, fab leisure facilities. Prompt check in& bottle of water given on check out. Nessa (wedding coordinator)is a true asset to this hotel, her professionalism and attention to detail & love for her job really shines through in everything she does. A five star resort in every sense.",5,2014,07,24
238,Wonderful family break,"We arrived to a warm welcome and warm towels and were shown to a large room which wasn't cramped despite there being 2 adults, 2 children and our seven month old baby.  The room had all you would expect in a five star resort but it didn't feel overly grand- allowing us to relax.  The boys explored and found the outdoor play park, indoor games room with a new xbox one and a pool room to fill their time.  We were on the second floor which had a baby room with changing facilities and equipment to prepare and heat baby food.  In the pool area there was a room which mums and dads could use to change our baby which was great as usually it is in the ladies changing room.  The pool was a decent size with a lane set aside for serious swimmers.  We had an evening meal in the Thirteenth on our first night which was good.  Service throughout was excellent and we were never left sitting without someone asking if they could help.  Breakfast was the best I have ever had- fresh omelettes, pancakes and loads of variety including a table set aside for coeliacs.  The evening meal on our second night was a barbeque with steaks, burgers, sausages, marinated chicken, prawn skewers, baked potatoes and salad  followed by a few small desserts (the only minor complaint).  My hubby booked a nine hole lesson with the club pro, Patrick, and absolutely loved it.  On our last morning we returned to the pool after taking our 9 and 12 year old to putt a few balls on the practise green.  We checked out and were given a bottle of chilled water for our journey home.  An amazing few days away.  Watch out for late deals as everything- room, food and golf lesson- all cost us around £400!  We will definitely be back, if only to use the return guest voucher with money off our next stay.",5,2014,07,23
238,Great Stay,"We recently stayed here with our 3 year old daughter and had a fantastic time. The hotel is ideal for families and caters for all ages. The food, facilities, rooms and restaurants were great and the staff were so friendly, very accommodating and welcoming. I would recommend this hotel and will definitely return.",5,2014,07,22
238,Excellent all round,"Stayed here for a wedding; couldn't fault any part, from check in to departure, the whole experience was wonderful.  Looking forward to returning.  The staff were extremely friendly, the views are beautiful, breakfast was fantastic.  Very relaxing.",5,2014,07,21
238,Wonderful stay at Druids Glen Resort,"Just returned from our first visit to Druids Glen Resort. From check in to departure we had a wonderful experience with the service from all staff, to the standard of bedroom and food. Everything was first class. The location is very central to a number of tourist sites and if you dont feel like travelling there is plenty of onsite facilities. We used the pool, driving range and hired (free) bicycles.
The only drawback was the number of young noisy children but we would definitely return in the Autumn when school recommences.",5,2014,07,20
238,Great stay again at Druid's Glen.,"We had another lovely stay here recently, the staff are so friendly and welcoming on arrival. We'd booked one of the executive suites and were disappointed to be given an internal one that lacked the size and full-length windows of the previous external suites we'd stayed in. (I hadn't realised they could vary so much in the same category). A quick ring down to reception to enquire if they had one more like the previous suites we'd stayed in saw us moved to one straight away which was a very nice touch. 

Food and service in the bar was excellent and we were delighted to see that pancakes are still made to order at breakfast. It's probably the most consistent hotel we visit.",5,2014,07,19
238,Wedding,"I did mean to submit this sooner but time flies!! 

My husband and I had our wedding reception at Druids Glen last August and really there are not enough words to express how easy the Druids Glen team made it for us, particularly Nessa Kearney the Wedding Coordinator. From the moment we booked in August 2012 to present day, any query has been answered promptly and efficiently by Nessa. In the run up to the wedding we knew that we did not need to worry about the venue and this really allowed us to concentrate on everything else. On the day itself the team were just fantastic, so helpful to us and our guests, attentive, and always ready to deal with any question or request. Our guests still compliment us on our choice of venue and there were so many little things mentioned that I can't mention them all. 

Quality of food is very important to my husband and I and we were certainly impressed at our tasting, at any other meal eaten there, and particularly on our wedding day. No tables were left waiting for food to arrive and everything was served to perfection.

We were very lucky to have nice weather and were able to make full use of the golf course for our photos. They really turned out great and for anyone considering stopping elsewhere for there photos on their way to the hotel, I'd recommend you check out the grounds first. They really are hard to beat! 

One of my favourite features of Druids Glen as a wedding venue is that the function room is away from the main hustle and bustle of the hotel and has it's own reception area. This is a major plus as it gives your wedding some privacy and a real opportunity for you and your guests to mingle and get to know each other. The ice cream cart was a massive bonus and with the canapés and other bits and pieces, the guests got a chance to relax (I hope).

I couldn't recommend Druids Glen enough for your wedding day or for a stay. We are so glad we had ours there.

I want to briefly mention the spa and say that the staff there are fantastic!

I'm really looking to going back in August and enjoying it all!",5,2014,07,17
238,5th time....still never disappoints,"It is now an annual tradition for myself and my golfing buddy to make our annual pilgrimage from Belfast to Druids Glen. This is the fifth year in a row we have been. It never disappoints. 

For us, the biggest attraction is always the Glen Course. It is challenging and stunning. The 12th and 13th would not be out of place on Augusta National for their sheer beauty. The Heath is a good course, but we have stopped playing there, instead playing usually 2 rounds on the Glen. The Heaths biggest problem is the Glen. One is a good course, the other is world class. 

Never been disappointed in the hotel. Usually eat in the bar with a few drinks on the terrace after but were fortunate to be there on the night of a BBQ this year. Rooms are comfortable, clean and we stayed in a refurbished one this year. 

Truthfully, I wouldn't have come to this place 5 years in a row if I didn't love it. I hope the resort keeps investing to keep it the star player that it already is. For any avid golfer.....if you haven't played the Glen....you need to. 

Oh....and yes I will be back for a sixth time next year.",5,2014,07,16
238,"Stunning, family friendly resort!","This is one of the most beautiful, relaxing hotel resorts we have been to. We took our two children ( 6&3 years), who both had a great time, they were so well catered for...outdoor playground very good, indoor 'Druids den' was a really good playroom with toys, games, and a movie and popcorn for the kids every night at 7pm. Reception also brought out shelves full of dvds every night for kids to choose from. The kids menu was excellent with plenty of choice, and very tasty too. The bar menu for adults was limited but what was on it was lovely ( we ate here 5 nights, so tried most things). BBQ on Friday nights is excellent, definitely a must if you are staying on a Friday night! The health club was fantastic, lovely pool. Spa treatments were half price on Monday and Tuesday (so I got a massage both days)! The music that was played casually throughout the hotel added to the relaxing, calm atmosphere, and as the hotels slogan says 'fall under the spell', we certainly did that and can't wait to go back. The staff were all so friendly and attentive which added to such a pleasant stay. Plenty to do in the surrounding area, our favorite trip being to Clara Lara fun park (great day out for the kids!) could not fault this hotel! Loved it!",5,2014,07,13
238,Excellent Family Break at Druids Glen,"We stayed here for 3 nights in July 2014 as a family of 4. We booked a family room on a B&B basis. Room on the 3rd floor was excellent and spacious for us and our two 8 year olds. Spotlessly clean and plenty of bathroom space. Very quiet at night and no noise etc from other rooms. The Resort has won awards for being family friendly - and I was pleasantly surprised that this was the case 'in the flesh' - staff we encountered were all very friendly and professional without being overbearing - and were very kind to our 8 year old twins. The Hotel as a result has an air of being very relaxed and not stuffy at all. The Breakfasts were outstanding - if you can get a B&B rate - highly recommended - I have stayed in many Hotels but I would say that the Quality here was up with the very best - and consistent every morning. Our twins wanted me to book us in for longer as a result ! The Leisure facilities are very good - as well as the Spa which my wife availed of. The Restaurants are OK - a little pricey but thats what you get with a 5* resort. The 13th Bar was a nice way to see Germany beat Brazil 7-1 in the Semi Finals of the 2014 world cup ! Only minor drawback - ... maybe ... the Hotel probably opened in the 1990s and there is still (understandably) a whiff of the 90s in decoration etc - but thats a minor point. For a family looking for value for money at a high quality resort, Druids Glen is highly recommended.",5,2014,07,10
238,Lovely hotel could be better,"Druids Glen is in a beautiful part of the country, and the hotel itself is a lovely building.  They have some great offers available for couples and families which explains why it was nicely busy.  We recently took advantage of a one night stay with a meal included.  

The bedroom was very nice, large with a lovely view from the window and a well equipped bathroom.  The weather was very warm at the time and the room was very hot at night - unfortunately the air conditioning sounded like a car engine so we had to open the window and hope that would create a draught.  The bar area is very attractive and comfortable with a lovely outside area which was very popular as it was a lovely evening. 

We had been lookining forward to the meal, but unfortunately it was rather disappointing - it was only ok, and certainly not worth the A la Carte prices, so we were glad it was included in our package.  Service was terrible - plenty of staff in the Brasserie but they needed direction as some things had to be asked for several times, it seemed to us that they were short staffed in the kitchen, or someone needed to be supervising the whole operation.  

Some of the public areas look a bit shabby - chairs in the Brasserie looked as if they needed recovering, the Ladies toilet behind reception also needed some maintenance, the previously mentioned air conditioning unit in our room - such a shame as overall it is a very nicely designed building.  

We did enjoy ourselves, and the staff are fantastic, without exception they were extremely friendly and helpful.  I would definitely stay there again, but feel it is not a 5 star hotel at the moment, it is missing that extra luxury feel that would make it a 5 star for me.",4,2014,07,07
238,"Gorgeous hotel, great setting, expensive food","We spend a weekend at the Druids Glen with our two year on the strength of its reputation as an excellent hotel for families and weren't disappointed. The hotel is in beautiful surroundings, is beautifully built and laid out, it has a nice mix of expensive and comfortable feeling about it. Apart from the excellent children's facilities (baby station with nappies, wipes, bottle cleaners and sterilisers, playground, indoor play area with soft toys, a free arcade game, air hockey table, fussball table and free films, DVD player in each room with a free DVD library at reception), it has all that you'd expect from a hotel of its class. 

The only slight disappointment for me was the food. Breakfast was the usual buffer, standard was good. Lunch had a more limited and very expensive menu which served, almost without change, for the evening bar menu. There was a BBQ the first night we arrived but the food was pre-cooked and tasted oven-cooked and, at €25 per person, was very disappointing. Dinner in the restaurant was very good, not the best I've ever had but definitely nice. 

The staff are definitely worth a mention. Everyone we dealt with was super helpful, they couldn't do enough for us.
",5,2014,07,07
238,The perfect hosts!,"We live locally to Druids Glen and dine in their restaurant maybe once every couple of months. This is always a real pleasure - a relaxing evening with beautiful food served by wonderful hosts, in particular Maeve & Loic. With fantastic table manner, friendliness & efficiency, you are certain of an enjoyable evening.",5,2014,07,07
238,Family hotel of 2014 - well deserved!,"We have just arrived home from a fantastic break with our 3 kids and my 3 year old daughter has asked to sleep in her hotel bed.  From the moment we arrived to the minute we left the staff looked after us and our kids with impeccable detail.  Hot towels on arrival, crayons and colouring cards for the kids, DVD's and popcorn for the kids to view movies in their room.  Indoor play area (which shows movies each evening) as well as outdoor playground.  We especially liked the dedicated room to wash bottles, heat food etc., they even provided spare food and nappies!  Any issues we had (our meal was delayed on the first evening but dealt with well by our server, toast for breakfast was forgotten about but upon enquiry was swiftly delivered and in greater quantity than we could have eaten!) were resolved promptly.  Our rooms were well appointed and equipped, fantastic choice for breakfast including a fresh pancake/omelette station.  Each morning an information notice was posted through our door providing suggestions for things to do depending on the days weather which was also detailed for us.  Upon leaving, bottles of water were given for our onward journey - great attention to detail.  All round an excellent experience - we would love to return and explore more of the Wicklow region as the hotel is nestled wonderfully in beautiful countryside.",5,2014,07,05
238,Leaves you with a Warm Feeling,"I cant help but praise this place,  ive stayed here twice now and im not a golfer,   its surroundings and feel leaves you wandering if the staff may be a little inflexible and stuffy,   but not in the slightest,  they cant do enough for you from the offerings off warm towels on arrival and cold drinks on departure you are made to feel you are in a special place.

However even things like trying to cancel at last minute due to personal issues are dealt with no questions or inflexibility.

I could go on and on about all the good things a this hotel from the room,  to the sleep etc etc,  but i dont want it to get too full that i cant get in their next time.

My dealings today were with Rebecca, Amy and i cant thank them enough!

I will keep coming back and coming back!",5,2014,07,04
238,Druids Glen Resort,"Just returned from a fantastic restful weekend at the Druids Glen Resort. Cannot praise the staff enough for the excellent service and hospitality offered during our stay. The food was top class with all dietary requirements catered for.  Will be returning!! very soon I hope.

238,our civil ceremony 14.06.14 John and David,"My partner David and I had our civil ceremony in Druids Glen, Oscar Wilde Suite, on 14th June. The whole day honestly could not have gone any better. The Event Organiser, Nessa Kearney, was instrumental in ensuring that everything went exactly to plan. She is the ultimate professional as well as a fantastic person, easing our nerves in the build-up to the big day with her calm and common sense approach. As for the day herself, Nessa and her staff organised everything to perfection, ensuring that we, and our guests, had the most incredible day that we will never forget. We cannot thank her, and the Druids Glen staff, enough. Where does one start: the ceremony room was so beautiful, the reception room elegant and just how we envisioned it, the catering staff so efficient and attentive, the bar staff warm and consumnate professionals. All of our friends remarked how much they enjoyed their stay. Every need was attended to, making the whole experience one to remember. Not to mention our room which was absolutely gorgeous. It is so wonderful when one imagines and plans a day for so long, only for it to turn out exactly how it was planned. We also had a barbecue the next day in the most lovely of settings. Again, the bar staff and catering staff made this a real triumph. If anyone is thinking about booking Druids Glen for their wedding or civil partnership ceremony, then don't think about it. Do it. We cannot recommend Druids Glen more highly as a wedding venue; the staff are second to none and the incomparable Nessa is an invaluable asset to anyone planning such an event. We thank her and all the staff for providing us with the platform for a truly unforgettable day and an experience that we will treasure for the rest of our days.",5,2014,07,03
238,Relaxing,"Overall excellent, although on checking in, we had to move rooms as the phone and safe were not functioning. The rooms had recently been redecorated but no-one had checked to see that everything was functioning as we also had to call staff in to sort out the safe in the second room we were in. We were presented with a bottle of wine as compensation, which was a nice gesture.
We played the main golf course(there are 2) as we had been advised to pass on the Heath Course. No problems, well kept and challenging.  Food was good as was service, not outstanding, but pleasant. Breakfast was good and varied.  Reception staff very helpful at all times.",5,2014,07,02
238,Excellent hotel,The hotel is beautiful. Bedrooms looked redecorated and very comfy. The meal was gorgeous and very friendly staff. Nice sitting out on decking prior to dinner. Swimming pool and spa fab. Defo recommend.,5,2014,07,01
238,Needs refurbishment,"Had one night stay 14 June ( birthday, an round of golf)
Golf course ( main one) was enjoyable , but signs of lack of money being spent.  Not the expected manicured course. General untidiness . No tap water ,towell at course toilet, wood stain peeling .
The 14th is one of the most challenging par4s ever played. ( after hitting a great but intimidating drive, confronted with a 214 yd bottleneck 2nd to the green)
The hotel( ?5*) was comfortable but not luxurious ( applies to rooms public areas ). Room corridors are like any gloomy airport hotel .
The dinner was ok, not memorable.
The staff were excellent, cheerful, helpful an informative.
The people who run this place need to have a rethink an spend some money and not depend on the Druids glen name one the wonderful staff",3,2014,07,01
238,An amazing hotel,"We attended a wedding reception at this hotel and stayed the night. The wedding reception was beautiful, with magnificent food in lovely surroundings. The bedroom was very big with two double beds, which had footstools at the bottom. The wardrobe had slippers as well as dressing gowns, which you could buy if you so wished. The bathroom was luxurious with a seperate bath and shower which is unusual for a hotel. It was a huge bathroom. The hotel is in lovely surroundings and has a world class golf course which looks onto the sea. The breakfast had everything you could possibly want. The service in the hotel was excellent. When you check in they give you a little plate with small towels to clean your hands (probably for the golfers mainly) and on checking out, we were given bottles of water for our journey. This hotel really is a touch of luxury. I looked up the rates afterwards and they seem to do deals for families and special breaks etc. There were a few families with children at breakfast. Our overnight stay wasn't too expensive. This hotel really is a touch of luxury. If you want to treat yourself, this is the place. It also has a swimming pool etc. but we didn't have time to use any facilities. There is also a spa.
I would definitely go back. It's a lovely, luxurious quiet hotel. Can't fault anything. Oh I was told by a work colleague before I went that the beds in Druids Glen were the most comfortable anywhere and I can definitely vouch for that. The room also has tea/coffee facilities, hair dryer, ironing board etc.",5,2014,07,01
238,Druids Glen Resort,"Stayed here June for a couple of nights. Myself and 5 friends for a golfing trip.
Perfect place to stay. Rooms were large and comfortable, restaurant food was excellent and the staff were friendly and always will to help.
Golf at Druids Glen was excellent, and Druids Heath was very good. 
Will certainly be back",5,2014,06,30
238,Short but great stay,"We stayed at Druids Glen for just one night, but wish we could have stayed longer. The hotel is set back on some winding roads but all of the turns were very clearly marked. The grounds of the hotel are very expansive and beautiful, very well maintained. The hotel itself is lovely. It is very well adorned and clean. 

The front desk staff were top notch. Everyone we encountered was very friendly and welcoming. We were relocated to this property because the hotel we were supposed to stay at was oversold but we still received great service. We arrived pretty late but were still greeted and welcomed to the property. We had three rooms. Two were adjoining as we requested and the other was close by on the same floor. The rooms themselves were quite large as was the bathroom. We had a nice view of a green courtyard. The room was quiet and the beds were comfortable. 

The breakfast spread was very impressive with both hot items and a continental breakfast. The service in the restaurant was also fantastic. The wait staff were very attentive. We were not fortunate enough to try the bar, but the atmosphere was great.

Overall, I would recommend this property to anyone looking to stay in the area. We would love to stay again!",5,2014,06,24
238,birthday celebration,"just back from a one night stay at druids glen hotel with my 3 sisters . it was my eldest sisters birthday and we wanted somewhere special to celebrate and druids glen did not let us down .From the moment we arrived we felt relaxed all due to the wonderful staff . The rooms we got were extremely spacious and had new carpets that you could sink your feet in to . The pool and spa areas were so relaxing as well . On the evening of the birthday we had a great meal and the staff were so nice . They wrote happy birthday in chocolate for her on her dessert and sang happy birthday to her as well . The views from the rooms were beautiful and even though its a large hotel the place was not noisy or stressful like some others I've been to . well , all i can say is thank you to druids staff and we will be back .",5,2014,06,24
238,In our experience closer to a 3 star standard.,"Very beautiful setting and easy to find.

Underwhelming welcome and frustratingly slow check-in service.

Again underwhelming room with basic hotel touches - Our Double Room featured 1 hotel bathroom sized  shampoo, soap and shower gel in a brand packaged to look like a well known quality brand but smelling much closer to a Lidl counterpart.

Shower, sink & bath in our room all featured blocked drains meaning that when you stood in shower, washed face or tried to drain the bath this resulted in a stagnated pool of dirty water for  30 minutes minimum.

Air Con in swimming pool area was suddenly very cool when the 7pm closure for kids time approached meaning we and an Asian couple had to huddle our small toddlers out with a towel around them.

Room service was wildly over-priced -average 'main course meal' was priced at €24.95 PLUS €5 tray carrying fee - so €30 per person to eat a plate of pasta with mushrooms from the bedside locker and 'desk' alongside the Tv.

Breakfast was the real let down - staff actively avoided making eye contact to take our tea/coffee/toast orders even though it was a very quiet breakfast room on this Monday morning.

We were told newspapers which are offered to all guests were 'gone' when we ate circa 9.30am. A so called breakfast pancake area was unmanned  even though all the ingredients sat aside a hot pan for same. We ordered toast and 15 minutes later the waitress dropped a toast tray full of blackened toast on our table and sped away. Orange & Cranberry juice holders were empty.

On returning from breakfast at 10.15am our room key had been disabled even though the check time is 12noon.

Nice man helped us carry our overnight bags from lobby to outside the front entrance area but this couldn't erase the litany of shoddy stuff that went before. We got a 'deal' at €129 from a last minute booking site and even at that 'bargain' price were massively unimpressed. Will not return again,",2,2014,06,23
238,Beautiful hotel with lovely staff,"We stayed in Druid's Glen as we were attending a wedding locally. From the moment we checked in to when we checked out, the service was superb. We were greeted by Amy on front desk who was both friendly and informative and allowed us to check-in early. We also met her as we were checking out and she is a real example of how front of house staff should greet guests. The rooms are absolutely beautiful, both in design, space and comfort and we were lucky enough to receive a little box of butlers chocolates, which is a really nice touch. The breakfast is really impressive with little extras considered for all options, such as strawberries & cream for pancakes and clotted cream for scones. The homemade granola is really tasty too. I already want to go back for more. The leisure facilities are really worth a visit as the pool has a nice warm temperature. Overall we can't wait to go back, as it's not far from Dublin and is so relaxing with lovely, friendly staff.",5,2014,06,21
238,Wonderful Hotel,"Just returned from The Druids Glen resort,  it was a wonderful experience from the moment we entered the hotel. The staff were the best of any hotel l have ever stayed, nothing too much trouble. Large comfortable rooms, with huge comfy beds. Anyone who enjoys a big breakfast, this is the place to be. Dinner was exceptionally good. Great bar, swimming pool, gym and spa. Although we don't play golf l am assured this is a golfers dream. Without doubt something for everyone here. I will most definately be returning",5,2014,06,18
238,Best 5 Star for Children & Best Breakfast EVER!,"I booked this last minute as a weekend getaway for my husband for 'fathers day'.  The staff were very welcoming and made a huge effort to speak to our three children and make them feel equally welcome.

A lovely touch is when you arrive they present you with hot face clothes to refresh your hands and face after your journey, it's a lovely touch.  

We stayed on the 1st floor.  The corridors were nicely decorated and clean.  The rooms were spacious with two double size beds (which in a five star hotel was a little disappointing a King size or super king would have been perfect, but we still had a good nights sleep).  
There was also a writing desk and side board in our room.  The bathroom had a separate shower and bath.  There was double doors which opened onto a 2ft wide half type of balcony, which really served for the purpose of being able to open the doors and have a lovely breeze come in without having to worry that the children would fall out the large door/windows. 

When checking in we had asked about swimming and we noted that the staff had informed us that there was robes in the room for all the guests, but there was only two adult ones.  We rang down and they arrived promptly with children's robes, which my children were delighted with.

This hotel is really about the staff - the staff is what makes the hotel in my experience and also what amenities are available.  Ken the barman couldn't do enough for us giving plenty of information about the amenities of the hotel as well as things to do in the surrounding areas.  Our children had gone to the playground, so we were sitting on the balcony just having a glass of wine settling in and he presented us with colouring packs for the children when they returned.  Again, very very child friendly.  

After one of our meals, our toddler had started to get tired and upset, so we had to leave our table abruptly - I had said to one of the staff members, we would be back to settle the bill in a few mins when we had the little one settled and again, 'no problem'.  Sunni was so accommodating to our children who opted to choose from a different menu as was Danielle.  The staff are all so friendly and can't do enough for you and nothing is a problem.

The resort has bikes available on site for the children and adults.  Our children loved cycling around the estate and Oli was only too pleased to help them get saddled up and sort them with helmets, etc.  Never loosing patience even though they would drop the bikes back only to re-hire them half an hour later when they changed there mind and wanted to go for another cycle.  There is a selection of dvd's and board games for the children as well as an outdoor playground and indoor den which is very conveniently located a few yards away from the main lobby.  

Another massive plus for this hotel is that they have a kitchenette on the 1st floor, which has a bottle washer, microwave and even a few jar's of baby food if you were caught short!  I can't stress how much of a difference having this facility can make to a families overall comfort.  

The pièce de résistance has to be breakfast!!  Diet went out the window on this one.  The continental breakfast had great choice but the quality of food was excellent.  My favourites was the home-made granola and the porridge (which had a very naughty jug of cream, brown sugar or honey beside it - so lovely).  The pastry selection was good and the hotel's own Guinness bread was just lovely, especially with a little smoked salmon and lemon.  

There was the usual buffet style selection of sausages and rashers.  The sausages were particularly good.  I love hash browns and there was none, but it didn't matter as they had table service eggs benedict or eggs Florentine (which I had on the second morning - divine).

The children absolutely loved the pancake station, and availed of it both mornings choosing strawberries and chocolate sauce for their filling.  Alongside the pancake station the chef is also busy making omelettes which my husband had on both mornings and said it was just so tasty.  It is probably the best breakfast I have ever had in a hotel.  After I finished breakfast on the first morning, the very lovely Eli asked if we wanted fresh tea or coffee - I said 'yes I would love a fresh coffee', thinking Americano as that's what they serve at breakfast and her reply was 'well, would you like a latte, espresso, cappuccino, mocha?...... I was in heaven!!  

We are delighted to have found this hotel as it is less than an hour from where we live.  They cater so well for children and anyone with children will tell you if they are happy it makes a massive difference to how the adults can enjoy the facilities too, whether it be reading the papers with a coffee or going for a walk around the estate.  It is now going to be our 'go to' hotel for when we just want a weekend away or a couple of days switch off with the children!  

Highly Recommend!",5,2014,06,17
238,Wedding anniversary,"We spent a night at the Druids Glen Resort for our 25th wedding anniversary. The room was fantastic (we were upgraded to a President's Suite) and the service was outstanding. We dined in the bar for lunch and in the restaurant for dinner, both of which we enjoyed enormously. The swimming pool is large and the steam and sauna rooms are excellent. The spa is fantastic and the deep tissue massage hit all the right spots! Great breakfast too.
Only reason that the review is not five stars is that we felt the whole package is very expensive. If money is not an object, then Druids Glen is a terrific place.",4,2014,06,13
238,"Fantastic resort, golf courses, service","We booked this hotel at the last minute from a referral, and found a great deal on a golf package that included the room, golf for two each day along with a full bountiful breakfast buffet. I can't say enough about our stay! The room was large, well furnished and very comfortable. The service from the front desk staff to the folks in the pro shop were very friendly and helpful. All of our meals were great and their bar and lounge areas were very comfortable. There are two 18-hole golf courses and both were great! The only downside if there is one is the remote location - if you don't have a car there is no place to walk to or any available public transportation.",5,2014,06,11
238,Nice modern hotel and golf resort with a mix of guests,"We had a spacious room with a queen-size bed, good tv, a long sideboard, a desk, table and easy chairs.  The public areas in this hotel are lofty but worked very well and are comfortable.  Layout is such that some rooms are quite a distance from the public areas, not a bad thing at all.  Breakfasts were excellent with a huge choice of fresh food including a small table with gluten-free food.  

We did have a few niggles though: the shower cubicle was small and the water kept running hot and cool; wi-fi was problematic; in the evening there was not nearly enough light to sit and read by the standard lamp; the bathroom too was very badly lit indeed and the shaving mirror light didn't work.  There was a glass shelf immediately above the kettle, dangerous and awkward, but we managed to move it up.  Room servicing was a bit haphazard and it was a little annoying having to shake out the pillows every night as they were heavily squashed in at one end so they could be put on the bed end-on, why?  Then there was the noise from other guests closing their room doors at all hours, we were unlucky enough to be woken up four times one night by huge 'bangs' - why can't people close doors quietly, it's not rocket science?  The doors in this hotel though are particularly heavy.

Having said all that, the staff were excellent, especially the breakfast staff, reception staff too were extremely helpful and so was the concierge.  A special mention and thanks has to go to the chef who prepared oat milk for our breakfast for the duration of our stay!  We didn't use the pool or the large gym but I used the spa and had an excellent treatment, one of the best I've had.  A pleasant stay.",4,2014,06,06
238,Late lunch,Absolutely perfect . Starting with the setting . The food . The service . Well done to all who work at the establishment . Will be returning in the near future that's for sure. Continue with the great service. ,5,2014,06,05
238,Modern Low Rise Hotel with Golf Course,"Stayed here in May for 5 nights on a classic car tour. Had an excellent suite with two rooms well laid out and even had a gas fire and fireplace. Two excellent large flat TV's very comfortable large king size bed. Very quiet situation and slept very well

The staff were very friendly. The food in the bar area the 1st night was not the best and it was very noisy. The other nights we ate in the restaurant and that was very good. The breakfasts buffet style were very good..

The Hotel is very modern with American style layout and the public areas are a bit characterless and barn like but non the less comfortable. The corridors are very long and you could have some distance to walk to your room.

We did not use the spa but it had a lovely pool and large gym faciliti .

The Hotel is a bit difficult to find surrounded by narrow winding roads which is a put off for dining elsewhere in the evenings.

It is an excellent hotel could be 5 star for the rooms but nearer 4 but very good",4,2014,06,04
238,Nice stay,"Lovely stay, bed linen fresh every day, new towels every day, cleaned everyday. Food was ok. Could of been a bit cooler. It was unbearably warm. Swimming pool was nice.mini fridge was perfect size. Not very comfy beds though",4,2014,05,30
238,Under-rated Gem,"We stayed at Druid's Glen for two nights but wish we'd had the time to stay longer.  From the very beginning at the reception desk, we were made to feel welcome and at home. The resort is world-class, and the pictures on the Druid's Glen website simply don't do it justice... it is much nicer than the pictures depict.

Beautiful Hotel, nice rooms, great golf course, friendly staff!!!",5,2014,05,29
238,Confirmation Dinner 5*****,"We had our son Jospeh's confirmation dinner  here this week and the food and service was 5*****. We had a private room with a buffet for 20 people the room looked amazing and the food was fantastic. A special thanks to Reggie and Paddy who made our day so special they were fantastic. 
Joe & Sally Kendrick",5,2014,05,29
238,Wonderful hotel,"This hotel and resort is absolutely wonderful. Staff are amazing and so helpful and friendly and nothing is ever too much bother. Lovely room, awesome area and fantastic grounds. Absolutely recommend this hotel!!!!!",5,2014,05,28
238,Beautiful hotel,"Stayed there for two nights with our kids. Can't recommend this hotel high enough. The room was beautiful and bright with luxury toilettries and even the bathrobes for our 2 small children. The breakfast was amazing,plenty choise for any taste. The staff is very pleasant and friendly. The swimming pool area very clean and water is perfect temperature. Hotel itself very nice and bright and smells gorgeous! Kids really enjoyed the playroom that got plenty toys.   Overall a great place for a short break.",5,2014,05,27
238,Excellent dining experience,"I was here as a guest for a buffet communion meal in the Oscar Wilde room. The food was plentiful, extremely tasty, and lots of choices on offer. The staff were friendly courtous and helpful. The setting was excellent. Overall a very enjoyable occassion.",5,2014,05,27
238,Great place ... Super golf,"Was lucky enough to stay and play golf at this resort . I found all the members of staff excellent, very friendly and go the extra mile to make your stay memorable . Especial Amy on the front desk ,who managed to help us sort out a booking issue ( our fault ) .
 The rooms are what you would expect for a 5 star resort. Very clean and we'll maintained .
Didn't visit the spar so will not comment

Where this place  excelled is the golf courses. One small negative when you visit 5star course it is the norm to be given a course guide and other small bits and pieces .
 The Heath was a excellent course with some lovely views and in supper condition ...
The Glen course ..... Was fantastic with some breathtaking holes.  A small heads up .... bring plenty of golf balls ,you will need them.   
",5,2014,05,26
238,Lovely weekend break,"We had a really nice weekend break here. The food was good, nice walks in the area, close to Greystones for a bit of variety if you want a choice of restaurants. The rooms were a little tired though which was disappointing given the price.",4,2014,05,22
238,Fantastic hotel!!,"Myself and my girlfriend stayed the weekend here a few weeks ago and have to say, will definitely be coming back again! We were treated like absolute royalty! Would highly recommend! Would like to say a big thanks to our barman, Darren for his very friendly and professional service! Overall a great weekend",5,2014,05,19
238,Noise,The golf course is superb and the rooms are excellent but night staff are very strict with noise for a group of men drinking in the lobby !!!!! People like to sleep  we understand but people are here to have a good night,4,2014,05,18
238,40th birthday,We spent the most amazing afternoon in druids spa.. the staff were all so helpful ruth greeted us with a smile.. our treatments were out of this world. Roisin has simply magic hands. Manager on duty michelle made the celebrations so memorable with her special touches.its a heaven that feels a millions miles away from home but is only 10 minutes away!!. Couldn't say enough good things to do justice to our day!! ,5,2014,05,18
238,Fabulous family friendly 5* stay,"We booked a three night stay At Easter with our two young children! I have not enjoyed a family weekend as much in a long long time! I really don't know where to start. From check in to check out this hotel was exceptional on every level. It well and truly deserves every one of its 5 stars! Luxurious , clean, well run, family friendly the list goes on!! We were welcomed with a presentation of warm damp flannels accessorised with a fresh daffodil to refresh ourselves after our journey to the hotel even the children age 4 & 6 got one.Then while my husband checked us in ..being the Easter festivities the children were presented with individual Druids Glenn Easter T.Shirts to keep and little Druids Glenn colouring books they were so excited! Concierge parked my husbands car and our luggage was brought to our room on the concierge trolly. The hotel is immaculate from top to bottom no stone left unturned. Members of staff frequently gently polishing up frequented areas of  the hotel so it looks its best at all times! Doing this with the utmost discretion and not making you feel you can't relax! Far from it.. This hotel is all about relaxation even with the kids.. The bathrobes and slippers provided in the rooms mean you can go straight to the pool area or spa from your room just dressed in the gown very simple and fuss free! The pool is amazing with great views! Children's play room is fantastic our kids didn't want to leave it! Again cleaned and maintained regularly! Nothing in bad repair ! Outside playground great fun clean and new! We dined in both the main restaurant and the bar and both were amazing food and service top notch . My husband and I can both safely say Druids Glenn offer the best breakfasts we've had in Ireland so far, and we are quite well experienced in 5* breakfasts!! The made to order pancakes are delish!! I could go on and on about this hotel but to round it up I would highly recommend this hotel to any family who seek the luxury of 5* treatment within a relaxed welcoming and friendly atmosphere whether as a family or a couples weekend away this hotel caters for all and you will leave a very happy and satisfied customer! Rooms are beautiful and beds are so comfortable! Don't delay book now :). May I just add I'm not very easily pleased and I'm never quite pushed to leave reviews so this alone says something about this hotel!",5,2014,05,18
238,Super Retreat!,"If you are into golf, then a mini-break here is a no-brainer. I however don't golf! Have visited a couple of times now - once on a work trip (christmas party with overnight stay) and another time on a family break. It's a fabulous and luxurious retreat - a little worn around the edges, but the top notch service and facilities make up for that. Also convenient location to see a little bit of Wicklow including the avoca shop. ",5,2014,05,18
238,Exceeded expectations,"Had been hoping to experience Druids Glen for ages and I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we arrived the staff were fantastic, so welcoming and made us feel really relaxed. The golf course was superb and when we got back to the hotel there was a refreshing hot towel waiting for us. We decided to have a bar snack before heading out but the standard was much better than many restaurants. The room was spacious and well equipped. I hope it's not too long before I get to experience Druids again.",5,2014,05,18
238,last 3 days of vacation,this hotel is stuck back from everything but if you golf is really a great place neither one of do our room was great newly renovated as they are doing to all their rooms very pretty place people are go friendly the irish breakfast is a great value we also had our last night dinner the special was lamb which I love I hade the shank and was to die for the front desk is very helpful on places to go that are not to far,5,2014,05,16
238,Very Pleasant,"We stayed here for 2 nights.  The rooms are really comfortable and the beds & bed linen are first class.  There is a mixture of Irish and non national staff and they are all trained to the same high standard.  All were extremely helpful and courteous. Lots to do and see in this part of Wicklow and we crammed a lot in during our stay.
The high point was breakfast, I can't remember having a better breakfast anywhere else.  The low point was the bar, the Guinness is almost un drinkable and at Dublin prices.",4,2014,05,16
238,Enjoyable stay!,"Was lucky enough to win a nights stay in Druid's glen, so decided to book a second room and travelled up with friends.

The staff and the service at Druids glen were fantastic, but stating the obvious the real attraction of Druids Glen is the golf course. The course itself is beautiful, even for those who don't play golf, the walkway around the course is lovely and as you'd expect everything is beautifully maintained.

Really enjoyed our stay and would find it difficult to find fault with anything about our stay. Hopefully will stay again in the future.",4,2014,05,14
238,Awesome Place!!,"My family and I stayed here for two nights mid week in early April.  From the moment we drove up - the staff was incredible!  Teague was simply suburb and from the moment he greeted us we knew we were in a special place.  He made our stay really memorable. The rest of the staff were also so very lovely from check-in with Lubo to Ella and the breakfast staff  (who were the most courteous and accommodating I think I have ever met!) to the ladies at the spa - we had a most comfortable and lovely stay.  The hotel itself was very clean, the beds comfy and the grounds were spectacular.  We hope to visit Ireland again and will definitely plan to stay here again when in Co. Wicklow.",5,2014,05,13
238,The best of the best,We have just returned from the most wonderful weekend ... The Druids Glen is probably the best hotel I have ever stayed in.. Nothing was too much trouble.. The staff excellent... The attention to detail throughout first class.. Everything superb..will go back as soon as possible...,5,2014,05,09
238,Weekend at Druids Glen,"A splendid hotel with the most well trained and courteous staff I have ever encountered. First rate all round. The hotel is especially ""children friendly"" but manages to be so without any inconvenience or irritation to those without children. Room was great. Food was great. Facilities were excellent .",5,2014,05,09
238,cant wait to return,"Spent two nights here and had a wonderful time. The staff are very friendly, efficient and welcoming and the management are fantastic at helping out to make sure you have a nice stay.
The food is very good. The room which was newly refurbished and super clean
 The resort has lovely walks and the grounds are stunning. 
 would highly recommend a visit to this hotel and cant wait to return",5,2014,05,07
238,Wonderful staff,"We stayed here for two nights while visiting some of the local heritage. We felt extremely welcomed by the staff who were great. The food was very tasty and we were entertained by our waiter who was good fun and very attentive.Our room was spacious and comfortable and we didn't want to leave. The hotel is in a beautiful setting and the hotel provide a taxi service which we availed of to take us to a village nearby to sample some traditional music. Overall, we had a very memorable and pleasant stay at Druid's Glen.",5,2014,05,06
238,The staff make this place,"All my prejudices about golf and leisure hotels were confounded by a visit to the Druid's Glen Resort for a wedding. Yes, there were probably a large number of families with young children (it was a bank holiday weekend), but the hotel absorbed them without difficulty. The hotel's public areas and our bedroom were in superb decorative order having recently undergone refurbishment. The bed was extremely comfortable and it's particularly gratifying to see proper LED reading lights on stalks which should be regulation standard in all accommodation. The food at the wedding was excellent. Breakfast was a little disappointing. Although the cereals, bread and fresh fruit were OK the cooked food was not up to scratch: Bacon covered in grease and white exudate, undercooked sausage, overlooked fried eggs, watery scrambled eggs. I didn't try the made-to-order pancakes but they looked good. The biggest disappointment was the coffee - obviously made in vast quantities in an urn and decanted into jugs as an undrinkable treacle. I realise it is more costly to freshly brew individual cafetieres, or have Nespresso machines on the buffet but it has to be done.

These are small quibbles and the overall experience is excellent. The main reason for this is the superb staff who without exception go out of their way to provide a superior level of service that you would not find in many a more expensive establishment. They are universally cheerful, helpful and friendly without being too intrusive - a difficult trick that many others do not manage.",4,2014,05,04
238,Girlie weekend,Went with 3 friends for a catch up weekend. Overall we had a great stay. The rooms were spacious and very clean. The staff in general were friendly. We just had a couple of small quibbles. There was not a single treatment slot available over the time we were there- a little disappointing . We had dinner included on the first night of our stay. The food was grand - nothing to rave about but fine. The service however was very very slow. The second night we ate in the bar and had a much better experience. The food was very good and service much quicker.,4,2014,05,04
238,Amazing Place,"Spent one night here over Easter and had a wonderful time. The staff are very friendly, efficient and welcoming. The food in general was very good and the room which was newly refurbished was  very comfortable.  The resort was lovely walks and the grounds are stunning. I would highly recommend a visit to this hotel and cant wait till we return.",5,2014,04,30
238,"Boring & Ordinary Food, Lovely & Extraordinary Everthing else !!!","Went down for Easter weekend and have to say, this place is great. Now in fairness regarding the title of this review, we are  ""Foodie's"",, so when we go away we love it when we get great food . Doesn't have to be fine dining or Michelin, just nice food done really well. The breakfast buffet was nice tho the pancake machine was veeeeeery slow so it held everyone up in the queue. The lunch & bar menu were very-very limited and was not cooked fresh rather is seemed to come from a steamtable.  The dinner food was just ok but again it was Easter weekend so it was very busy ( A little aside on traveling bank hols in Ireland,, every place we've ever gone makes the excuse that ""its a bank holiday and we are very busy so the service is poor""  Hello, note to the Managers of these places,,,put more staff on the days when you know for an absolute fact its going to be busy!!!   )  
Other than the blah food, it would be hard to find a single fault with Druids Glen.  From the moment you pull in the driveway you are met with incredible service. Every single member of the staff here was incredible, friendly, excellent at their jobs, helpful etc  It was like the service you would expect at one of those places you see on the telly where Celebrities go.   Rooms were nice, bathrooms really nice. Entire place spotlessly clean. Beautiful views from lounge area, nice reas to visit only short drive from hotel too...  There you go, maybe the food was a bit of a letoen but we'll be back anyway, this place is fantastic.",5,2014,04,29
238,Nice and Relaxing,"Overall a wonderful stay.  
Check in was speedy and efficient.  The hot towel at check in is a nice touch.   We were offered a porter to help with luggage (again a lovely touch)  but declined as we only had a small bag.   We stayed in a lovely suite.  Room large and comfortable.  Only tiny little niggle with the room is possibly a toothbrush is needed around the soap holder in shower (I am being really picky with this!).  the shower itself was wonderful. Very powerful and hot.  Bed confortable and lovely cotton sheets. 
We had dinner at the resturaunt and service was excellent.  Food overall was good. 
Next morning we went down for breakfast and again i could not fault the breakfast buffet.  It had everything you could possibly need in a breakfast. 
to end our trip we went to the hotel pool.  Neiher I nor my partner had brought our swim caps and had to purchase them.  3 a cap is a little bit of a rip off this was a little off putting at the ned of a lovely trip . 
Overall I would return.",4,2014,04,29
238,Great Weekend,"We stayed in Druids Glen for a wedding over the Easter weekend. The wedding was fabulous and so was the food. The  room we stayed in was huge and spotless, considering it was Easter and the place was really busy, the bedroom  was quiet and peaceful. Breakfast the next morning was amazing anything you wanted it was hot and plentiful.  This is our second stay in Druids Glen but we will be back. Brilliant.",5,2014,04,28
238,Excellent,What a wonderful stay. Beautiful hotel and exceptional staff who made the stay all the more enjoyable. We were there for a golf break and if you get a chance play the Glen - it is magnificent! You will not regret staying here.,5,2014,04,27
238,a lovely place to stay,"was at a wedding in the druids and it was wonderful
foods was great, service 2nd to none spent the night at hotel fantastic room huge so comfortable ,breakfast was so tasty and a great selection of hot and cold foods i would recommend this hotel to everybody and the nicest part of the stay in this hotel are the staff their attention to detail ,and so friendly and helpful",5,2014,04,26
238,"Beautiful escape, great for families!","Lovely hotel just half an hour from the city.  Huge golf course, great pool, spa, gym facilities.  Kids very welcome and well catered for.  Excellent food in the restaurant.  Lovely escape for friends, family, couples, golfers...",5,2014,04,26
238,Service second to none!!,"Having just returned from a 3 night stay we have only good things to say about this hotel and the excellent service we received. On arrival we were greeted by Teague who took our bags, and then proceeded to give us a detailed overview of the hotel facilities. We were checked in by the excellent reception staff who went out of their way to ensure the children were given colouring books and that we were made aware of all the Easter activities going on at the hotel and surrounding areas. On all three nights we dined in the restaurant where we were overwhelmed by the friendliness and professionalism  of Jo and her team. Nothing was too much bother for this team of friendly and attentive waiting staff. The food was magnificent - and cooked to perfection. 
And as for the other hotel facilities ....... Absolutely fantastic !!! We spent a considerable amount of time in the pool area which was brilliant and thoroughly enjoyed by the whole family. The kids also enjoyed the games room as well as the nightly movie. 
Thank you for a wonderful stay and we look forward to our next visit !!",5,2014,04,25
238,Lovely Weekend Away,My girlfriend and I had a lovely relaxing weekend here recently.  Staff were exceptionally pleasant and helpful.  We ate in the bar one evening and had a meal included in the restaurant on the other night - both were of a very high standard.  Room was lovely and spacious and there are lots of lovely of nice areas to sit and have a drink.,5,2014,04,24
238,Amazing,"From being greeted at the door by a friendly concierge to the reception staff we knew it would be a pleasant stay.

Rooms are spacious and spotless. Pool was a good size and the kids loved it.

Food was nice in the bar and amazing in the restaurant. 

Grounds were beautiful for a walk and loads of activities for the kids.

Will definitely be back again.",5,2014,04,23
238,Good,"The Druids Glen is nice. A funny mix of golfers and families. Wherever we went there were kids running around everywhere. 

Staff were mostly friendly and helpful. We couldn't get a table in the bar in the evening so the lovely waiter served us in the foyer area. 

Breakfast was good with a large selection, very fresh pastries and omelette cooked to order. 

Staying as a couple we'd probably go somewhere else next time. ",4,2014,04,22
238,Busy Hotel,"I booked this hotel for my husband and i for our anniversary. We only stayed one night - Easter Sunday. We were greeted on arrival and upgraded to a superior room - the receptionist was friendly and efficient. Our room was very nice, quite large and very clean.
We had booked for dinner at 8pm, I relaxed in our room with some complimentary magazines which was a nice touch and my husband made for the pool. 
We headed down to the bar before 8 to have a drink and headed in for dinner at 8. We were seated in a nice area overlooking trees etc. The waiting staff seemed to be very busy, and a little flustered we waited to make our order - we waited some time to order and I did notice two other couples entered the dining area after us and their order was taken before us. We then got to order - we got our starters at 8.45 - we thought this was a bit of a long wait as we only got our wine just before that.
Our starters were both very good and served nice and hot. We waited quite a while for our main course too (i didnt time it) but when they arrived they were good also. A couple seated at the table next to us ordered a jug of water 3 times and it never arrived the lady did say to me that they had dined there the evening before and she remarked that the service was better on that evening.
We had a drink in the bar after dinner - which was nice.
We slept well in our comfortable bed and headed down for breakfast. I had ordered a newspaper with reception when we arrived - but when we entered the dining room and enquired about the newspaper we were told they were all gone. Breakfast was a buffet style - the cereals and juices in one area and the hot food was kept in bain marie type serving units. There was quite a queue formed and I joined in - there was a hold up because a lot of people were ordering omelettes with the chef, also the pancake machine had broken down and a chef was trying to fix it. I helped myself to cooked breakfast - but there were no fried eggs available. I waited to catch one of the chef's eye to let them know that serving unit was empty - but was unsuccessful. Eventually the chef that had been trying to fix pancake machine glanced my way I told him about the egg situation  - he turned around and took up a tray of (uncooked) eggs and headed thru a door - i presume to the kitchen (he did not speak to me) the other chef who was busy making omelettes then put 4 eggs in one of his frying pans and fried them - he gave me one of the eggs. Both chefs seemed very stressed. When i got back to the table I realised I had been standing in that queue for 20 mins! The other food on my plate was luke warm. My husband went up to queue for his breakfast and was not as long waiting.
I know this was a very busy weekend in the hotel - but maybe there should be more staff on hand - the rest of the waiting staff also seemed flustered and stretched.
We had a nice time overall in this hotel - it would probably have been a nicer experience on a quieter weekend.",4,2014,04,22
238,Awesome!,"From the hot towels at reception on arrival to the bottles of water for the journey home, this hotel rocks! The service is exceptional - in terms of making all guests feel welcome and providing as many comforts as possible. I've never experienced such friendliness in all the staff in a hotel before and my 3 energetic boys had plenty to keep them amused. Our stay was a total pleasure. The room was spacious, clean and had an amazing view. The food is great - breakfast is an experience not to be missed. The play room and playground kept children of all ages amused, no mean feat. The baby room provides all facilities and supplies needed. I can't think of anything they've missed. I definitely never felt my children were a bother to anyone. Very refreshing! Can't wait to go back. Will try the spa next time.",5,2014,04,21
238,fantastic hotel!,"From the moment we pulled into the car park to when we left, Druids Glen didn't fail to impress. 
The service was undoubtedly the best we have had anywhere in the world. We travel worldwide on business and stay in many hotels but nobody has come close to Druids Glen when it came to customer satisfaction. Joanna on reception was brilliant, very helpful with a genuine way about her. The rooms were spotless and the hotel facilities are second to none. 
We really enjoyed our stay here and will definitely be staying again in future . This hotel is worthy of more than it's 5 stars . Very very highly recommended",5,2014,04,12
238,Excellent Golf,"We have visited this resort a few weeks ago as a part of a golf trip to Ireland. We played the Heath Course and I can say it is one of the best courses I have played in Europe, very well equipped and maintained. There was a young man in the store was very helpful and professional, really, one of the best golf attendants. Also in the ""Fairways"" a young English man behind the bar who speaks Castilian perfectly and explained all the menu so I could understand everything! Very friendly and patient. Unfortunately I do not remember the names of the guys but they are a very good credit to the resort. Food very good too!",5,2014,04,09
238,Excellent hotel,"just back from a two night stay and I must say it is a fantastic hotel with the friendliest staff you'll see anywhere, Hospitality at its finest. we had our two young children with us and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Special thanks to Marie and all the team. We will definitely be back again some time",5,2014,04,06
238,Relaxation with a Capital R!,"Stayed at Druids (for 2nd time) in March for a 2 night stay. Had a beautiful room on the 3rd floor,complete with fridge & tea, coffee, & biscuits etc provided! Bathroom had both bath & shower! Breakfast,as usual was very good, good selection to suit all tastes.Dinner in restaurant- I didnt think the veggie food was as good as the previous time there? Two great golf courses (though we don't play) with relaxing walks, so very peaceful!!!!! The lovely Powerscourt house & gardens are also close at hand for a visit! Had a lovely time!",4,2014,04,06
238,druids glen,"the best hotel I have ever stayed in. the friendliness goes above and beyond. rooms fab. staff fab, so attentive. keep it up. love this place. from the moment you arrive here you are made to feel welcome. food is fantastic",5,2014,04,04
238,Beautiful location - great golf,"Druids Glen is a beautiful hotel resort situated near the Irish Sea coast in the countryside. The grounds are fantastic, with wonderful views of the surrounding woods and golf course. The staff was warm, friendly and efficient - they did everything possible to make our stay enjoyable.  Strongly recommend Druids Glen as a place to stay in the southeastern part of Ireland especially for golfers.",5,2014,04,03
238,Great food,"Stayed at this hotel for a two night family get together in late March. The staff were very helpful and efficient. The rooms are very spacious but as mine was at the front of the building there wasn’t much of  a view. Everything in the hotel was of a high standard and quality. The food was very good , dinner and breakfast were very well presented and as good as any Hotel I’ve stayed in.
The swimming pool is a good size for a hotel, but can get busy with children at times. There are walks around the grounds but for a longer walk you’ll need to go on the public road.
All in all a quality hotel with pleasant helpful staff with the food being the major positive point.",4,2014,04,03
238,And the winner is......,"I visited this hotel with 23 other men for a golfers weekend and the service and staff were excellent ! We arrived early as our tee times were booked for around midday, although not of all the rooms were ready (didn't expect them to be so early) a good number of rooms were ready which meant we could leave our luggage and proceed to the driving range to warm up.  Staff took the bags of the rooms which were not ready, labeled them up and later dropped them to the rooms.

We played both courses over the two days and had great craic ! After playing Druids Heath on the Saturday we had a three course dinner in the fairways grill located near the pro shop, food was fantastic ! The steak was cooked to perfection, plenty of chips and a peppered sauce, just what a golfer needs !!!  What really impressed me was the Head Chef who came to our table during the meal to ask was everything alright, he even said goodbye at the end of his shift - nice touch.

To play Druids Glen course you have to jump in your car as it's a few minutes away although on the same grounds as the hotel.  Luckily as we were sorting out equipment etc at the front of the hotel, a porter called Teague kindly offered to run us up to the course in the complimentary mini bus ! This service is offered to all golfers as standard. Teague is a credit to the hotel, very polite, knowledgable and obviously passionate about his job.

Twin room good size, large beds, robes, slippers, bottled water, good size TV, bath and shower. Breakfast had everything you could want and more, Monika looked after us with great service and smiles throughout.

Definitely will return for the golf again, will also return for a relaxing stay with my partner.",5,2014,04,02
238,Marvellous Stay,"From the moment you arrive, you are special. Teague greets guests - a warm Irish welcome and you are ushered to the reception for check in where you are offered a hot towel to freshen up.

Our room on the second floor was spacious as was the bathroom.  White Company toiletries and fluffy towels were lovely. 

We had a bar meal - not cheap but excellent quality and the breakfast was great too.

We used the pool which was very clean.  You need a swim cap here but if you don't have one then they have them for euros 3 each so no problem.  My only criticism is that they don't have a wringer for swimwear so I left with wet clothing to try and dry, not easy when you are touring around!

I would certainly return and stay longer as there's plenty to see and do including two excellent golf courses.  Special thanks to Teague (hope that I have recalled the correct spelling) for going the extra mile and making our stay extra special.",5,2014,04,01
238,Not quite 5*,"We stayed here over mid term break with our two children. As we had heard such good reports we had high expectations. On our arrival we were told that our room would be ready shortly and reception told us they would ring when the room was ready. One hour later having watched a lot of others receive their rooms we approached reception again and finally got in. Our room was quite a walk from reception and we did have done problems with it during our stay. When staying with children I think it would be worth asking for an upgrade as our room was small and left little room for keeping children amused let alone watching tv when they'd gone to sleep. Our fridge did not work though thus was sorted and a glass shelf collapsed during our stay, we wre also promised a DVD player which never arrived; minor problems I know, but not five star!
The hotel prides itself on being family friendly and certainly there are some great facilities for children. Colouring packs were provided on numerous occasions which was great. The outdoor park is very good, but is a good distance from any facilities for parents. The playroom is just okay. There were a number of easels for children but nothing to write on them.  There were a few other toys lying scattered around and playhouse, but again the facilities were not 5*. We ate in the restaurant on the first night and the food for adults and children was very good. The children's buffet was very handy as it meant you were not waiting on their food. Service in the restaurant was excellent. 
We had a pleasant enough experience and thankfully had got a good deal, but unless we received a  really good offer we certainly wouldn't be returning. 

",3,2014,03,30
238,A Warm Welcome Awaits!,"Look after the little things and the big things will look after themselves, and trust me when I tell you that Druids Glen has this down to a (golf) tee.  Yes it has two very good championship golf courses, but golf is only part of what this resort has to offer.

My wife and I have just returned from a weekend break at Druids Glen and what impressed me most was the staff.  Not a sullen face amongst them, they convinced me that they were always glad to see us (something that can't always be said about all hotel staff you encounter).  From the warm welcome in the form of a warm facecloth at check-in after your long trip, to the complimentary bottle of spring water to refresh you on the trip home at check-out, this was customer service par excellence.

If you like the kind of bar where you never actually have to visit the bar to get served, then this is for you.  The restaurant is fine with a menu to suit all tastes at reasonable prices.  I thought the wine list was a little restricted but on the other hand, good quality wine was available at €29 a bottle, which was good value and shouldn't cause the wallet indigestion in an establishment of this standard.  

Hot and cold breakfast with a wide variety of choice and a chef on hand to make an omelette or pancakes while you wait.  Be sure to pick up your complimentary newspaper on the way there.  

And if you find yourself wondering how to fill your day you can check out the 10 things to do when it rains/with a car/without a car/when the sun shines - all very helpful suggestions on a card in your room, which by the way is spacious and comfortable with a widescreen TV replete with Sky Sports.  Outside the window we overlooked the 13th hole residing as it does in a leafy glen with a stream flowing through it.  Beautiful, and particularly so in the fall I would imagine.

I haven't even mentioned the Spa or the Leisure Centre or the pool..... check it out for yourself!",4,2014,03,30
238,Fantastic place for a family get together,"My mum was reaching celebrating a significant milestone birthday and we were looking for a hotel to accommodate 5 families with a number of children - we reviewed 5 different hotels within a two hour drive of Dublin and choose the Druids Glen.  T

The decision was made on a combination of price and services and when we took an impromptu visit to the hotel we were delighted with level of service and friendliness we experienced. The food on the day was delicious.

Overall the rooms are large, the hotel is very child friendly with lots to do at the pool, on the bikes, free videos to hire and games room.

We had booked a large table in the dining room for the dinner on the Saturday night- The food was outstanding and service second to none.

All in all my mother had a wonderful time.and we had a great experience.

Thanks to all the staff",5,2014,03,28
238,Nice spot.  Recommended,"Stayed overnight here recently.  Overall a very pleasant stay.  The reception, lobby, bar and restaurant areas are all very nice, quiet and relaxing.  A good sized room, (Deluxe Double) nicely furnished, fresh and clean.  This also applies to the en-suite, though would qualify that just by saying have had bigger/better in other hotels of similar quality.  Same applies to the Pool/leisure area.

Staff couldn't be more friendly and helpful.  

Can recommend the Brasserie for an evening meal.  Food service and atmosphere were all good.  Restaurant is also available.

Breakfast was great.  Hot or cold buffet style but all the hot food is kept fresh and warm with the option of freshly cooked pancake or omelette  to order.  Nice touches like covered food warmers and cereal in bowls and not the perspex dispensers you get in some hotels.",5,2014,03,25
238,Overnight Treat,"Stayed in Druid's Glen Resort on Friday night, 21st of March.  We had a Confirmation dinner there in the afternoon and had decided in advance for the group to stay overnight.  There is a real 5 star feel about this hotel.  The reception staff were professional, friendly and helpful and we were given a warm facecloth wrapped up to clean our hands with when we went to check in. The concierge was very polite and friendly and took our bags to our hotel room.   The room itself was large, modern and spotless with huge TV, kettle, safe, iron and with gorgeous views of the mountains.  At the Confirmation dinner, the staff were extremely good and nothing was a problem.  We had brought our own cake which they made no issue of at all, and immediately offered to slice it for us.  The buffet breakfast in the morning was excellent with homemade breads, mini-pastries, fruit, cereal, juice and the usual hot Irish breakfast.  You could also order eggs any way you wanted, Benedict, omelette etc, at no extra charge.  The swimming pool is very big for a hotel pool, with sauna, steamroom and Jacuzzi.  There is also a fitness centre and Spa.   On checking out, the Concierge brought our car to the front door and we were given a bottle of water each as well for the journey.  We left feeling we were ""special"" guests.  The focus of this hotel is that they want their guests to enjoy their stay and absolutely nothing was any trouble to them.  Whatever they could do for you, they would, without any fuss or bother.  It was an absolute treat.  Cannot recommend highly enough for a short stay.  Huge thank you to all the staff as you were all absolutely faultless.",5,2014,03,25
238,"Fantastic service, Fantastic hotel.","My Husband and I stayed in Druids Glen on a couples retreat for 2 nights recently and thoroughly enjoyed our stay, on check in we were upgraded to a superior room which was spacious and comfortable. The service from the moment we arrived to when we left was fantasic, I can not commend the staff highly enough they were so friendly and helpful and really went the extra mile to accomodate us in any of our requests. We had a really relaxing stay here and would highly recommend it. We are looking forward to going back, and to trying some more of their wonderful cocktails!! 
Sonya and Patrick, Tipperary.",5,2014,03,24
238,Great Weekend - Outstanding Customer Service,"Stayed with a group friends recently, We thoroughly enjoyed our visit. Fantastic location, great facilities, lots to do on the resort.
The customer service standards are second to none, and I would especially like to mention the front office & guest relations teams who went the extra mile to make our stay special.
We enjoyed a wonderful meal in the Sika Restaurant, the food, menu choice & service were outstanding,
Will definitely be back.",4,2014,03,24
238,Lovely manager!,"I decided to stay here for Valentine's Night with my boyfriend as I had heard from my family and friends that it was 5 star and a fabulous hotel to visit. I usually would not stay in five star hotels or anything like it but we did not expect what we got. When we arrived we went to our room and I was unsure if we had got a twin room or double room as usually or so I thought (is a double room not a room with a double bed?) we had two beds and I just thought for 5 star it should be what it says on the website. Anyway, we informed reception of our query and they were not impressed. Yet, after deciding to make do we received a call from the manager (a man with a foreign name cant remember). He informed us that he would like to offer us a suite to stay in after hearing about our query. We put in a fabulous suite with a fire place and the manager himself wheeled down our bags and carried my bunch of red roses under his arm. I was so disappointed when we first arrived but after we had been accommodated so generously by the manager we were so overwhelmed. There are few busy hotels out there that will make it their utmost priority to ensure that individual guests have a pleasant stay (considering that there are weddings and hundreds of other guests staying too) but Druid's Glen is definitely one exception. The manager (again I cant remember his name) is a credit to the hotel and I think it would definitely lose it's 5 star without him. Thanks again :)",5,2014,03,23
238,Outstanding,"Recently spent 2 wonderful nights in Druids Glen. The room was beautiful, spacious and comfortable. Breakfast was excellent as was dinner in the bar and restaurant. The grounds are lovely for walking and we were very lucky to have some nice sunny weather in which to enjoy them. Staff are a credit to the hotel and everyone we dealt with were so friendly and polite. Will be looking forward to returning.",5,2014,03,18
238,"Great, great Hotel","Family of 4 (2 adults and 2 children) stayed in February 2014 for a 2-night stay. Our room was upgraded on arrival. 
Double bed, single bed and fold-up bed. 
Free WI-FI, flat screen TV, fridge, plenty of storage space for clothes, shoes, suitcases - all excellent. Bath and separate shower.

Pool was great for kids, spacious clean changing area's.
We ate in the restaurant on the first night, very attentive staff (Iosef was brilliant), and we ate in the bar on the second night.

Kids playroom was very good, outdoor playground was also good.
My wife had a pedicure in the Spa, one of the best ever.

We had a great stay, could not say enough about the hotel facilities and the staff.

Would highly recommend, we will be back.",5,2014,03,17
238,"Definately ""under the spell"" of the druids Glen","Had a weekend break here recently and have to say it lived up to expectations. Reception staff friendly and welcoming as were every one we encountered. Room was spacious, very comfortable bed , nice decor and french door leading to a garden area. Bathroom good too although it was missing a vanity/ shaving mirror. Enjoyed the meals in the main dining room and the bar, breakfast was plentiful too with a good choice of cold and hot dishes. Have to say a big thankyou to Darren in the bar who went out of his way to get us information on local attractions and to Sunni for his good service and pleasant manner. Teague the doorman was helpful and provided a valet service. Hotel has beautiful grounds with nice walks . Great golf course for all the golfers out there.",4,2014,03,15
238,Just a lovely overnight break,"What a lovely Christmas present from our children, an overnight stay with a bottle of prosecco.  We thoroughly enjoyed our visit, the room was lovely, pool area spotless and service was first class.  We elected to eat in The Thirteeth, a very enjoyable meal followed by a few drinks and we ended our visit with a round of golf on Druids Heath.

Breakfast covered everyone's tastes and I would love their recipe for homemade granola. Delicious

This really is a lovely resort, staff are friendly and helpful. There is a 4k loop walk which is worth doing, it follows the perimeter of Druids Glen golf course.  

It was a lovely present to receive as often we don't visit hotels on our doorstep.  I'd love to return",5,2014,03,15
238,Great Location,Spent one night here recently. Rooms are very comfortable and spacious with all the necessary facilities which was great. Service throughout was excellent. We had a group meal in a function room which was very good also. Breakfast layout was a bit confusing - I was half way through the hot breakfast before somebody aleted me to the cold section which was cleverly hidden away from view. Apart from the breakfast confusion everything else was excellent.,4,2014,03,14
238,Enjoyable place to stay,"Stayed here two nights on business and its a lovely place. Staff are very friendly and courteous and the hotel and grounds are well kept. Food in the bar was good and the portions were just right. 
If you don't play golf there isn't much around the area the hotel is situated in. However if you have a hire car there are some nice places to visit - Glendalough is beautiful.",4,2014,03,14
238,We had our wedding reception here!,"We had a small wedding party of < 30 and it felt like we had 300 with the attention we were given, absolutely fantastic service and made us feel really special. Just happened to be a bonus that we could also go play golf on the championship Druids Glen as well :)",5,2014,03,13
238,Experience in the The Atrium Resturant,"Would like to say a Big Thank you to Maeve who served us a fantastic meal, she has such a pleasant and outgoing personality and made us feel very special on the night!  Thanks again Maeve, we'll be back!",5,2014,03,11
238,Fab Weekend,"just back from a fab weekend at druids glen .Our room was lovely ,the staff were excellent in spa also Adrienne at front desk.A Highlight for us was our meal and service in the restaurant.Maeve our waitress could not do enough for us . could we please have a maeve in every restaurant !!!!! We cant wait to come back",5,2014,03,11
238,Big Let Down,"The only thing 5 star about this hotel is the staff they were very nice! The location is amazing and the reception area is also very nice but the room was sub standard for what you would expect from a hotel with a 5 star rating.The decor was dated, stains on the chair and bed sheets, pollyfiller still on the wall unsanded from previous repair in the toilet. Lots of scuffs on furniture and wallpaper made it look a bit grubby.

The hotel is absolutely roasting and the air con was noisey and pretty much useless it woke me up several times. Walls are paper thin could hear the TV next door clearly as if it was in my room. The bed was crap got a terrible sleep and couldnt wait to leave if im honest. Im sure there are nice rooms in the hotel but unfortunately I didnt get one. Ive stayed in 3 and 4 star hotels before and they were top notch compared to this place. Its beyond me how this hotel has a 5 star rating its bang average in my opinion. The room I got was comparable to that of a 2 star.   

Dinner was nice but nothing special. Wouldnt go back again. Im glad I was only there for one night. Save your self a few quid and book into a local B&B.",2,2014,03,09
238,Five star rating  - five star staff,"Great hotel - we were a party of 3 ladies who stayed for one night for the Druids Spell package - dinner, bed and breakfast and a spa package and use of the leisure facilities.  From the moment we entered the hotel we were all made to feel 'special'.  The staff are very friendly in reception and couldnt have been nicer or more informative.  The room was huge and beside the spa which was great.  Our treatments were very relaxing and put us in the mood for a dinner.  It was our first time to visit the hotel and we were very pleasantly surprised with the high quality of the restaurant and indeed their staff.  Everyone was so pleasant with smiling faces and you could see the high training that they had been given.  In particular, we have to mention Lois, our french/semi Irish waiter - he is a treasure!  He spoilt us rotten and is a true gem to have on anyones payroll!  The food was delicious and our stay included a choice of dinner from the A La Carte Menu which again was a lovely surprise.  Breakfast the next morning was a lovely hot and cold buffet with lots of choice.  We shall be back!",5,2014,03,09
238,Excellent Hotel with 1st Class Staff !!,"We have just returned from the most relaxing break I can ever remember.  From the minute we arrived the level of customer service was second to none.  We received a warm towel on arrival to refresh and was upgraded to the new 3rd Floor.  The room was very spacious and beds extremely comfortable. Apart from the excellent service you receive from every single member of staff from the Front Desk to the bar staff and housekeepers,   I think that its really the finer details that make this hotel so amazing !! Things like sky sports in the bedroom tv's, FREE wifi throughout the hotel, plugs placed on the floors so you can charge your devices while using them in the comfort of the bar.  We used the spa and swimming pool and could recommend both the eastern head massage and the Back , Neck and shoulder Massage as fantastic.. The relaxation room before your treatment offers you complimentary refreshments and a place to chill.. Excellent.  We ate in the bar and the restaurant and both were beautiful meals with excellent service.  A very special thank you to Adrienne at the front desk who could not do enough for my wife and I during our trip even providing money from the front desk for our pizza delivery as we couldnt get cashback..lol  .... What hotel EVER helps its customers to such an extent.  All in all the weekend was amazing and can not wait to re-book !! Worth every penny and then some !",5,2014,03,09
238,relaxing stay,I enjoyed one night stay in Druids Glen recently with my daughter.  It was soooo relaxing to spend this time together in a lovely venue.  The staff were friendly and professional and we had a great experience in the spa.  The only complaint was that the jacuzzi and steam room were out of order.  This was  disappointing and to add insult to injury they charged €3 for our bathing cap!  This should have been overlooked as some of the spa facilities were out of order.  All in all a lovely experience.,4,2014,03,07
238,Perfect place for relaxation,"We had a wonderful weekend stay in Druid's Glen and from the moment we arrived we felt welcome and relaxed. As we were checking in we were handed hot towels to refresh us after the journey, this was a lovely touch and marked the start of an utterly relaxing stay. 

The staff were all so friendly and helpful, the room was very luxurious and comfortable and the general atmosphere of the hotel was wonderful. Great buffet breakfast in the morning too.

I would recommend this to anybody who wants to get away for a couple of days to unwind. I felt like a different person when leaving the hotel. And we never even made it to the spa! Next time I hope!",5,2014,03,07
238,Great stay with A* staff,"A hotel is as only good as its staff, and frankly this is where this hotel excelled during our short (but very sweet) stay.

Stayed here from early Saturday morning until mid-Sunday afternoon, so as one would expect the hotel was at its peak in terms of numbers (we were told 300 people were booked in for breakfast on the Sunday).

Despite the hotel being at capacity, the dedication, attentiveness and pride at which the staff (be it front of house, during the day at the cafe or at the bar in the night) conducted themselves cannot be understated. We celebrated a birthday and the staff could not have done enough - providing a bespoke desert as a birthday treat. 

In terms of specifics, the room was great (we were upgraded on check-in), the food at dinner was great and the buffet breakfast selection was also of a good standard. We also availed of the spa and pool during our stay which was also highly enjoyable. I am unsure if I would have paid full price for the spa had it not been part of our package, but the pool (sauna, steam room and jacuzzi) was fantastic. The gym looked great also.",5,2014,03,03
238,"Great Hotel, Friendly Staff","Enjoyed another fab one night stay in Druids recently. It is an oasis of calm.... you really feel like you are away from it all. We dined in the restaurant enjoyed a delicious meal and staff were friendly and professional, they organised a birthday plate for my friend which was really nice. Breakfast is a real treat, lots of goodies, love the little scones with clotted cream and jam :) Reception staff were great  friendly and accommodating even when we were a bit late checking out. Overall a very enjoyable stay. Highly recommended.",5,2014,03,03
238,Wonderful weekend!,"My partner and I have just returned from a brilliant weekend at Druid's glen, a gorgeous hotel with top class staff. Our room was lovely, very spacious and comfy. Had all the usual amenities. My partner was delighted with the sports channels! I agree with some reviewers that the decor could do with a bit of a spruce up but overall this is a beautiful hotel. One small gripe was the hair dyer! Why is it in a cupboard?  

The staff are really helpful, professional and friendly. They work so hard and are a credit to the resort. The food at the restaurant and bar was excellent and I enjoyed the cocktails! The bar staff were very attentive. The breakfast selection was fabulous, everything you could possibly want! I recommend the lemon scones! Delicious! 

A big highlight for us was the spa and leisure facilities, which were great. We enjoyed a walk too but sadly the route doesn't loop round. This is a small issue but with such lovely surroundings, it's a shame more routes aren't available for the non golfers! The grounds are nice to stroll around and the golf course looked very nice.

Overall, we had a great stay, relaxing and enjoyable! Wish I could afford to go every month!!",4,2014,03,03
238,Great relaxing get away,We stayed for the second time in February. It is such a great place to relax and recharge. The staff are so helpful and pleasant. They are very attentive. The food was delicious. The corridors were quiet which is great for a good night sleep.I have booked a break for my parents because we enjoyed it so much. We will be back!,5,2014,03,03
238,Seen better days - poor service,"Spent a couple of days here as a break away with my wife and son but was disappointed and not what I'd call 5 star service. The first issue was on check in when they tried to charge 9 Euro per night extra to what I'd booked on their own website. Luckily I had the confirmation email on my phone with the agreed rate. 

The resort is advertised as free WiFi but had lots of trouble with it during my stay. The login is your room number and 2nd name but after trying all possible combinations with the guy at the desk, I was told it was probably my phone that was the issue...when my wifes phone also wouldnt work, they gave me another room number and name to use, but it stopped working once I got back to my room so I just gave up. 

Its advertised as child friendly and we chose it based on this as they had facilities to sterilise baby bottles. However the kitchenette they mean is a very dated forgotton looking room with a very small cheap microwave in it which our bottles wouldn't even fit into.

I also found the decor a bit tired and dated overall. We paid extra for a suite and the space was great but it all looked a bit dated including plaster falling off the bathroom ceiling. We also had issues with smell coming from the toilet so they sent up a maintenence guy with some bleach and offered no apology. I also told the maintenence guy that the aircon wasnt working as we set it to 17degrees but the room was 23 degrees to which he told me that they turn the chillers off in winter....great...

After all this, we weren't even asked on check out if we were happy with our stay....overall poor, especially for the prices they charge

On apositive note, we ate in the bar both nights and the food was pretty good. My wife also had a treatment in the spa which she said was excellent",2,2014,02,27
238,Lovely hotel..,"Stayed here before Christmas and from the moment we arrived it was lovely!! All the staff were so friendly, helpful and attentive, we actually got engaged here and they upgraded us to a suite! The food was delicious and there was a great singer in the bar on the Saturday night.
A special weekend was made even better by the efforts of the staff and this hotel, I would definitely return and highly recommended it.",5,2014,02,26
238,Perfect for rest and relaxation,"I booked this hotel for a midterm getaway and I'm really glad I did. It's an oasis in the beautiful County Wicklow and a great base for exploring the county - as long as you have a car.
I travelled down from County Armagh and with the great motorway network I was door to door in less than 1 and 3/4 hours.

The hotel resort was well signposted and easy to find. I was very impressed with the setting and the beautifully maintained grounds. We were greeted with warm towels to freshen up and upgraded to a lovely superior room with a great view. I was with my 15 year old son who, like myself, is 6'2 so was delighted with the two queen sized beds in the room.

The room itself was very spacious with every everything you could need and more, great TV, DVD player, tea making facilities, iron, free water and most importantly, free WiFi! Bathroom was also very spacious with a separate shower and bath. There is a selection of DVDs in reception you can borrow - both modern and classic.

There was a well equipped gym on our floor, 3rd, and a great pool, sauna, steam room and jacuzzi on the floor below. We went every evening, once before dinner, 6.30 - 7pm and it was fairly busy with kids. The other two nights we went around 8pm and we practically had the place to ourselves - don't forget your pool hats!

It is a golf resort - we don't play - but there is a great walk/jog around the circumference of the grounds which was lovely. The walk does take you out onto the main road which is a shame so would need to be careful as there is no path in parts. There is free use of resort bikes which was useful.

The bar and restaurant areas are spacious with lots of different areas to sit and relax. There is a lovely seating area in reception with two real fires. I found this a great place to sit and read.
Breakfast was amazing with a great selection of hot and cold dishes and there was a chef making omelettes on request. We ate in the restaurant on one evening and the food was excellent and great value. I found all the staff very friendly and relaxed. What I liked best was that breakfast was served until 11am - during the week! 

The hotel staff are great - nothing was a problem. Amy on reception was particularly helpful in recommending places to go. Edel was great also in resolving a problem in the room and Marie the front line manager personally resolved the matter to my satisfaction in a very professional manner.

With regards to cleanliness, my room was immaculate, as was the pool area and corridors. Nit picking, there were cobwebs above the curtain poles on the corridor on my floor. There was a heavy deposit of dust on the wooden sills and booths in the Brasserie which was a bit off putting as it was apparent they hadn't been dusted for quite a while. Perhaps housekeeping need to be a bit more thorough in the public areas.

I will definitely be back to this hotel - I've not seen my teenage son as happy in a hotel, and that's saying something! I have recommended this hotel to all my family and friends and look forward to returning soon.",5,2014,02,23
238,Good but not spectacular...,"The Good
The Staff were excellent - very attentive, friendly and helpful. The best was a French Waiter in the restaurant, unfortunately I didn't catch his name, but he added real flair to the place. 
The location was very good , there's a 4Km walk around the golf course that surrounds the hotel, lots of birds and wild life , very enjoyable.
The rooms were quite satisfactory, not spectacular but generally in good order, well the stopper in the washbasin was faulty. 
The Breakfast was very good, they had a good selection, again not spectacular but good enough.
We had a complaint about the noise from the room next door - TV going at 4am, Lady in the room was on the phone etc. She was a business person and must have been on a different time zone!!! Hardly the hotels fault and they handled our complaint Very Well.
My wife had a massage in the Spa and she thought the girl did a Very Good job!

The Not quite so good
The stopper in the washbasin - 5* hotels shouldn't have faults like this.
The hotel is low rise and sprawls a bit so the walk to the room was long enough!
While we were in the restaurant for an evening meal we saw 3 meals returned to the kitchen, that's not great, but was it because they wanted the experience to be as good as possible? Our food was OK, again not great but OK. 

The real complaint, the reason I didn't give it a higher score was that the place lacked soul! No real personality, it was functional but then again so are most hotels. I would have given it a score of 3.75  The staff in all honesty went out of their way to make sure everything was not just OK but ""Good"". That makes up for quite a lot. If you are a golfer - you'll enjoy the course, it looked great.",4,2014,02,22
238,Wonderful weekend experience,"We had a two night weekend stay here and it was brilliant.  From first arriving at the door we were met by a gentleman who was helpful, pleasant and genuinely warm in his demeanour.  Reception was quick, efficient and very pleasant.

The bedroom was very good, spacious, modern, well decorated with excellent amenities and a great bathroom with bath and separate walk in shower. Rooms have a safe, flat screen TV and complimentary wifi.

The bar and restaurant are very good too with excel lam service standards.  The food in the restaurant is great too.  We dined there both nights. Also really enjoyed breakfast, all quality food in Irish breakfast.

The Spa I'm sorry to say we never used but I can guess its special, we'll check it out next time, same as the golf course.  February weather was too bad!  Highly recommend this hotel, one of the best and good value for money.",5,2014,02,19
238,Perfect Valentine's stay,"It was our second time here and was just as enjoyable as the last. It was a Valentines day treat for both of us and as usual the desk staff were pleasant and very efficent. The freshen up towel at arrival was a nice touch. Room was spacious and clean. Dinner was perfect and table staff were very friendly. Breakfast to the room next morning was tasty, timely and well presented. All in all a lovely stay and we'll definitely be returning. ",5,2014,02,16
238,5 star in every way,"I booked Druids Glen as a midweek break for my parents this week. To say they were treated like royalty is an understatement. From the amazing check in staff to the personalised card & chocolates in their room to the excellent food in both the bar & restaurant, they really did have an incredible stay & are planning their return trip already!! ",5,2014,02,16
238,Brilliant,"Stayed two nights here during Feb 2014.  The staff were very friendly and nothing was too much bother for them.  The staff provided assistance to us regarding places to visit, routes and road maps to get there, places to eat on our trips etc.  The staff were absolutely first class.  The hotel facilities were superb.  The room was spacious, impeccably presented and spotlessly maintained.  This was one of the best places we have ever stayed. We couldn't recommend it highly enough. We look forward to returning again in the near future.",5,2014,02,16
238,Fantastic hotel,"We stayed here last Saturday night for a one night break and can honestly say it was amazing!! We came home refreshed and feeling like we had been away longer than one night. We arrived early and our room wasn't ready but that wasn't an issue as it was only 1pm and we intended on having lunch first anyhow. The receptionist was very friendly and during lunch she arrived in with our room key. The Irish rugby game was on and there was a great atmosphere in the bar. Lunch couldn't be faulted well presented and tasty! After lunch we checked into our room, it was huge, big comfy bed and you could see a lot of effort went into the interior design, pure luxury!! That night we had dinner in the restaurant on the a la carte menu, food and service again fantastic and there was a lovely warm atmosphere! I would recommend pre booking a table though as the hotel was fully booked and we struggled a little to get a booking but again the staff were great and called us in our room when they got a cancellation! After dinner we went back it the bar and enjoyed the music for the night! A real find of a hotel and we can't wait to get back!!",5,2014,02,16
238,Post wedding mini-moon,"We visited here as a ""mini-moon"" following our wedding - I had booked golf for 11.20 for Druids Glen and so we arrived early.  On checking in, as we expected, our room wasnt ready (check in is 3pm and we got there about 1030am!)  The reception staff were incredibly helpful and invited us to avail of breakfast while we waited.  During this time, my wife had enquired where she might replace the contents of her make up bag (she had left it behind at the wedding venue 4 hours away) - again the staff were incredibly helpful.  The staff didnt know at this stage that we had just got married.  I set off for golf and Heather set off for a wander around the hotel and to wait for her spa appointment.  Within 10 minutes, the receptionist had found Heather and had allocated us a suite which was immediately available,  I had disappeared to play the finest golf course I had played in many a year (even more impressive bearing in mind the time of year and the poor weather that had been prevailing recently)

On my return from golf, Heather had had her spa treatment (thoroughly enjoyed - though by this stage we expected nothing less!) and we headed off to Dundrum to replace Heather's make up (as recommended by the hotel staff)  When we returned, the staff had realised we were on our ""mini moon"" and had placed a beautiful card and chocolates in our room, never mind the rose petals on the bed!

That evening we had dinner in the Druids Brasserie - this was quite simply the most fantastic meal we had ever had - from the attentiveness of the staff to the succulence of my steak and the tenderness of Heather's duck starter, the meal and the ambience were out of this world.

Highly recommend this venue for both weekends away, and golf - we will return (if only for me to get another meal like the last one and to enjoy both Druids Glen and Druids Heath golf courses in the summer)!",5,2014,02,15
238,Great value and super friendly staff,"Stayed on a Sunday night with our 11 month old son. The staff were all extremely friendly and catered well for children. There's a room with steriliser, microwave etc. And comfortable mattress supplied with the travel cot instead of the hard standard one that comes with them.

In the evening we used a baby sitter for a chance to go for dinner. We pre-booked through the hotel. Great selection on the menu and the food was lovely. My venison melted in my mouth.

Definitely going to stay again with our son. Between the swim in the pool and the comfortable mattress he slept like a log.",5,2014,02,14
238,Amazing,"Thank you all so very much for a wonderful 5 star experience.both my husband& I were blown away by the friendliness, curtesy&kindness shown to us. Hats off to an amazing team from concierge, waitress, manager& receptionists. I couldnt recommend ye highly enough. We look forward to visiting again when the hubby is in better shape.thank you all so very much. ",5,2014,02,09
238,Beautiful hotel,"I have stayed in this hotel twice now (once in August 2013 and once in February 2014). The hotel itself is beautiful - gorgeous grounds and really nice interior. The rooms are a good size and very clean. The staff are very friendly and helpful and the pool, restaurant and bar are all lovely. It seems to be very child friendly as both times we visited it there were a lot of families staying there. Couldn't really fault this hotel - dying to go back again!",5,2014,02,09
238,Beautiful hotel in beautiful location,"We were treated so well here.  The staff completely transcended our expectations.  We only had one night there, but we experienced many instances of kindness and generosity in that short stay.  The room was well-appointed and very comfortable.  The food was exquisite.  I wouldn't be able to praise the kitchen highly enough for their skill and superior ingredients.
The bartenders were friendly and knowledgeable, with great service and helpful suggestions. The front desk staff could not have been more gracious and kind, as well as very helpful.
A lovely place.",5,2014,02,08
238,Perfect,"Stayed for 2nights from 30th.Jan .... Amazing stay when we went to check in it had been a cold day and were welcomed with hot hand towels ,, when we went to our room there was chocolates there and a card wishing me a happy birthday which they knew about as I tweeted it, it's the fact they read it and put a little treat into our room, even when leaving we were given bottles of water for our journey,,, it was those little touches that made this stay extra special,,,, the hotel was clean and smelled lovely, the bedroom was spacious clean and comfortable,,, the leisure centre was very enjoyable. I'm sure I could find many ways to sing the praises of this hotel but my advice is Go there ... Beautiful and we'll be going back ",5,2014,02,06
238,Fantastic Weekend Break,"Myself and my family are just back from a lovely weekend in Druids Glen. 

I cannot review this hotel highly enought. The staff were so freindly esp to my 4 year old nephew.

The food was fab!! and the beds were sooooooooo comfortable. Cannot wait to go back",5,2014,02,03
238,Update,"I previously posted a Very Disappointed review last week, in the interim the Management at the Druids Glen Resort have contacted me to offer their sincerest apologies regarding my experience and I must say having listened to them I feel it is genuine and they take complaints Very Seriously, as it undermines their status as a 5 star . They have requested I return as a guest of the manager, I explained there was no way I would return but being in business myself I agreed everyone needs a second chance on occasions where things go wrong and to keep an open mind. So I will return soon to experience Druids Glen, I'm not expecting anything other than what I regard as a normal in a hotel of this caliber. I will post a review upon my return .

238,Relaxing time,"Just back from a fantastic weekend at Druids Glen Resort,Staff all so friendly and helpful.Remember to book in advance for treatments at spa ,I didn't and all treatments booked up.used pool area with sauna and jacuzzi,it would be nice to have the jacuzzi away from noise from pool and bigger ,Can't wait to go back",5,2014,01,28
238,Fantastic :-)))))),"I spent 4 days with my husband and two kids (8 & 6) enjoying everything this hotel had to offer.  The food in the bar is expensive but beautiful.  The restaurant is divine (love the fact that kids choose from a hot buffet).  Play room was enough to entertain kids when needed and of course the free wifi meant they could watch movies of their own.  The spa and leisure facilities are excellent.  The room interiors are slightly dated but all the good points of the hotel outweigh this.
We will definitely be back at this hotel as its far enough from the hustle and bustle of Dublin, but close enough to drive in for a bit of shopping (we paid a visit to Dundrum).",5,2014,01,28
238,Simply the best!,"My husband and I have stayed a few times in this hotel and got married there last year. Always have nothing but the best of experiences when staying. The hotel and rooms are always warm and very clean. The staff are very friendly and professional and the food is good there too. I would recommend this hotel to anyone thinking of getting away for a couples retreat, a small girly spa break or golf trip. ",5,2014,01,28
238,Very disappointed,"Just back from what claims to be a 5 star hotel
1) served by waiter at lunch, his uniform was filthy
2) my room was cold, 19 degrees when reported nothing was done to fix it.
3) Hot Breakfast today was a disaster at 10.30am, no food left, only one attendant cooking, 20 min queue , so we just had toast & coffee, btw toast was burned, and they still served it,
4) spoke to a manager who took note of the above on a scrap of paper but didn't offer any solution

Overall it's a yellow pack 5 star hotel
Won't ever go near it again no matter what excuse the offer

",3,2014,01,26
238,Great weekend,"I don't have a bad thing to say about the hotel. Fantastic deal, great price for bed, breakfast and evening meal in a superb restaurant. Fantastic room, great staff, made us feel really welcome. Had the same waiter, Loic, who served us 10 years ago, and made the experience just as enjoyable as the last time. Will definitely go back, however it will be unselfishly with the children, we only really scratched the surface with what they had to offer. Best breakfast choice I have ever experienced, it was a shame we only had one day.",5,2014,01,24
238,Great Girly Retreat Location!,"Had a fantastic pampering break with a friend in Druids Glen on Sunday Night. The  bedrooms are spacious and beautifully decorated, we had a breathtaking view of the mountains.
The hotel is definitely a notch above the rest, stylish and welcoming. I though before it might it might be just for golfers but it was great for a relaxing girly getaway and we noticed plenty of families too. The spa and general facilities were terrific. I love my food and the breakfast buffet was amazing, really well presented and great variety. 
From the moment we came to the door and went through it again to leave the one thing that stood out was how lovely and professional all the staff were, from the hotel doorman to the reception staff and the restaurant to the spa, they were fantastic. Already looking forward to returning.",5,2014,01,21
238,5* Luxury is alive and well in Druids Glen Resort,"Just enjoyed a fabulous spa break with friends at Druids Glen.  Good food, pleasant attentive staff, comfortable and spacious surroundings and very good spa treatments completed a most enjoyable 2 night stay.  Will definitely be back",5,2014,01,20
238,A fantastic friends wedding,"my daughter and myself attended a friends  wedding at Druids Glen.  We were welcomed at reception and staff were very nice and helpful. Our room was very comfortable and clean. The hotel itself was very nice indeed.  The room where the wedding service was held was comfortable to be in.
The room where the reception was held was a delight to be in. The food and service by the staff was very good and staff were very helpful. Every detail was attended too.

A good nights sleep and up for a very good breakfast which again every detail was attended too, staff were pleasant.

We enjoyed our first stay in Druids Glen and will be back again and have told family and friends about it.  Thank you all for an enjoyable stay.

Jean O",5,2014,01,19
238,Disappointed spa day,"Myself my mam and my sister spent an afternoon here, we were extremely disappointed  the pool was full of kids jumping in and out of pool which we weren't aware of as usually spa doesn't allow kids! The food was disgusting, the cobwebs on the windows were there for months by the amount and size of them  we left earlier then planned,",2,2014,01,14
238,40th  Birthday Family Gettaway Fabulous,"Outstanding Staff, Lovely spacious Rooms, Fab Golf Course (Glen) Great leisure centre. Kids loved it.  Can't praise them enough, 2nd time to stay and reaffirmed my choice for staying here.  Waiter that served us for Birthday dinner was excellent, very attentive, great personality, interacted with the kids and adults with ease, added to the whole experience.  Bar Staff were genuinely attentive,  Hotel staff makes what is already a lovely hotel even better, well down all at Druids Glen from a very happy Guest who will be returning.",5,2014,01,13
238,Disappointing,"Whilst this hotel is in a lovely location, I was very surprised by it's 5 star status. The room we stayed in (235) was very tired. There is a green carpet used in the rooms which is very corporate, almost what you would expect to see in a corporate board room. The furniture and bathroom in the room were also very tired, (scuffed and worn) for a 5 star. The minibar was unstocked, granted you can order the fridge to be stocked with what you need but you are charged for whatever you order at the time of ordering, not very helpful if you decide you want a drink in the middle of the night, you need to have premeditated exactly what you need. The spa was just average, again for a 5 star I would expect more. Having said all that the breakfast was lovely, the bar staff and gym staff are very friendly and there are some nice touches like giving you a bottle of water on checkout for your journey home. I really feel however that the bedrooms need to be revamped to warrant a 5 star status as other 5 stars I have stayed in are streams ahead with regard to bedrooms and spa.",3,2014,01,13
238,Perfect,"The staff were very attentive and catered to our every need, the rooms were delightful and cozy. The facilities in the spa and gym were in perfect condition. This hotel is family friendly but also a nice get away for couples. I highly recommend this Hotel.",5,2014,01,11
238,New Year's Eve,Great New Year's Eve deal at hotel very relaxed & enjoyable.  The entertainment in the bar after dinner was great & champagne on arrival for dinner was just fab.  The staff were very friendly knowledgable & efficient.  Nothing was rushed all very relaxed,4,2014,01,08
238,Positive and generally enjoyable stay,"My family and I 	(two adults - a 5 year old and 6 month old) stayed in Druids Glen for 2 nights on the 30 and 31st of December. Overall our experience was a positive one. For ease of reading i have broken my review into headings
Rooms - excellent, very spacious, bright, warm. TV was excellent and cleaning was spot on. 
Leisure Centre - Pool is good, big enough. It was very busy but that was to be expected at the time of year.
Food - One our first night we ate from the bar menu which was very good. The kids menu was good as was the adult menu. Good choice and quality. New Years Eve we ate (without kids) in the main restaurant. Food here was excellent also.
Service - This was excellent. Very attentive staff and very helpful.
Environment/Vibe - There is a relaxed vibe in the place however it is perhaps a little to kid friendly. While this may be odd coming from a parent of two young kids nonetheless there is a very high tolerance for running around etc till late in the night. Both nights it was common to have gangs of kids ( ranging from 5  - 12) running around and generally Horse Playing till midnight. I do understand New Years Eve is a little different as in kids stay up but the night before it was the same.

Overall however it was very positive and we will go back",4,2014,01,08
238,Lovely hotel,My husband and I spent one night here just before Christmas 2013.  Extremely nice staff at the front desk and in the bar. The bar was comfortable with a lovely fire burning.  Food was delicious in the bar and there are gluten free choices available.  The room was very nicely appointed and very comfortable.  Breakfast was not as good as the bar food and the staff were a little slow but all in all it was a very enjoyable stay.  We would definitely go back.  The grounds are spectacular.  Very pretty views of the Wicklow mountains.,5,2014,01,06
238,Day Spa Visit,"Christmas Day Spa special.  Treatment was for mid morning so used the pool, sauna and jacuzzi area, which was nice.  Got a very warm welcome from the Spa staff. The changing room area was very small though.  Treatment which was a coconut wrap and a mini facial was excellent.  Relaxation room was nice with herbal teas, juice and fresh fruit salad on offer after treatment.  Although one person using their mobile phones in this area which was a bit annoying.  When finished in spa there was a light lunch included in the offer, which was very nice.  Good value for money.",4,2014,01,06
238,Family Festive Fun but disappointing dinner,"We stayed for 2 nights 27th-29th Dec in interconnecting rooms (2 adults & 3 children). Rooms were spacious with a lovely view & suited us very well. The hotel reception was warm & festive with gorgeous decorations and staff very helpful & friendly. Having stayed twice before (without kids) I looked forward seeing what was on offer for the children this time. We were given details of the pool times, new outdoor playground & games room. The kids headed straight for the games room but were very disappointed with it. It had a football table, an air hockey table & one game machine (pac man). There was also a soft play area & little house for toddlers & at 4pm & 7pm they showed a film. My kids are 5, 9 & 9 so they didn't get much use out of the room plus it was freezing in there. It would be great to have more game machines, car racing etc and use one of the bigger rooms upstairs which lay empty during our stay, especially with so many children around. We ate in the bar on the first night which was fine.. On the 2nd night we ate in the restaurant. My parents joined us for a night B&B & I booked the 7 of us a table at 7pm which is the latest sitting with kids. Our dinner was included in the rate & the children ate from a buffet for €5 pp. The quality of the buffet was dreadful. With the exception of fish fingers there was nothing left which was edible. They are not fussy eaters but the pasta was like glue it had been sitting there so long & the mash potato hard & lumpy. They ended up with 3 fish fingers & beans for their dinner. They got a dessert too which thankfully put a smile on their faces. The adults all enjoyed the starters but the main course was very poor. 3 of us choose the chicken dish which was tiny and came without any form of potato. I had to ask twice for the seasonal veg which eventually arrived - carrot/parsnip mix & peppers covered with rocket leaves!. The appearance was enough to put us off! My poor Father was too polite to admit he was still starving after the meal & I was so embarrassed all I could do was make excuses that maybe the food was poor because there was a wedding on & that on our previous visits the food was always gorgeous (to add insult to injury I had treated them to their overnight stay as their Xmas present). Anyway, my husband said something to the waitress when we were out of earshot but nothing came of it. At night we were conscious not to have our children running around but its a shame others weren't so considerate. Kids running the corridors shouting until 11.30pm. My heart went out to anyone there for a relaxing break! Reception had a great selection of DVDs & we borrowed a few which worked out really well. The breakfast each morning was superb - almost made up for the awful dinner. When we were checking out the next day the reception was packed after a wedding & I didn't say anything as I had been queuing for almost 20mins & we just wanted to get on the road home. I really like this hotel but felt a bit cheated this time.",4,2014,01,03
238,Lovely birthday get away,"My boyfriend and I recently went to Druid's Glen for a night for my birthday. We had a lovely time. The hotel is fabulous and we had a suite, so we were in the lap of luxury. We had dinner in the restaurant, which was really lovely. There was lots of family groups in before Christmas. The next day we had a treatment in the spa and the therapists were excellent. What stood out for us most was the level of service from when we arrived until we checked out. Nothing was too much trouble. We had afternoon treatments in the Spa and the spa staff arranged a late check out for us and when we were leaving they even gave us little bottles of water to take on our way. That is service!",5,2014,01,03
238,"Beautiful Hotel, Stunning Location","Stayed at the hotel for a wedding, the grounds and common area's (reception, bars, etc.) were top of the range. The hotel has a spa, golf course & swimming pool so has loads of facilities to keep you occupied. The rooms were large, comfortable and clean however they were probably more of a standard I would expect from a 4 star hotel not 5 star hotel. With regards to value the hotel was expensive both to book and for food and drink although I guess this is to be expected in resort of this caliber. 

Pros; 
Top Facilities 
Good Common area's (Reception, Bar etc.) 
Stunning Location 

Cons; 
Expensive 

Overall I was really impressed with the hotel and would definitely recommend to anyone staying in the area.",4,2014,01,02
238,Another lovely stay here.,Visited for the second time recently and enjoyed it as much as the first. The suites are perfect for a couple or small family and the staff go out of their way to be friendly and welcoming. We'll return again soon.,4,2013,12,31
238,Children's Playground,"Perhaps it was the time of year (29-31 Dec) but from the moment of our arrival the hotel was overrun with unsupervised children. They were running through the lobby area, the bar etc. Neither the hotel nor the parents seemed to have any concern about what the children were doing. I don't dislike children hordes of children running completely unchecked spoils the experience for other visitors. For example children were running screaming up and down our corridor from 8am in the morning knocking on doors and running away. We had gone for a relaxing break and this certainly interfered with that. I'm sure this is great for families but I had checked out trip advisor etc in advance and gotten no hint that this would be the case. I just wanted to forewarn others thinking of a couple's break. 
The dining room was unimpressive - very much standard hotel dining room with standard food to match. 
Having said that the bar staff were lovely and attentive - remembered what we were drinking and served us promptly. The bar food was also good. The room service was prompt and tasty. The spa was excellent - went for the druid's spell treatments and a manicure and was very relaxing throughout. The room itself was also lovely and impressive - newly refurbished. 
Average hotel - certainly not five star service.",3,2013,12,31
238,Wedding Venue to Remember,"This spectacular hotel is best known as a base to enjoy the resort's fantastic golf courses. They are indeed marvelous, but I can attest that it makes a fabulous setting for a traditional Irish wedding. The bedrooms are spacious and bright, the the function suits are beautiful and the staff were simply fantastic. Nothing, including providing a bow tie for me, was too much effort. It was wonderful. The friendly Irish staff and our generous, welcoming hosts made this a truly memorable experience for us all. I took 3 rooms and they were all excellent.

Forty minutes from Dublin airport this is a venue with some style an class and certainly worthy a any big occasion.",5,2013,12,30
238,Best Hotel Ever,"We stayed here the week before Xmas - hotel was beautifully decorated - staff everwhere are so pleasant and efficient - we had a family room which was fab - our little grandaughter had the time of her life in the pool, play room and play ground. Food in the bar was lovely and served by most attentive staff who ensured the little one was occupied with crayons etc.  We will be back.",5,2013,12,30
238,"Margaret ""EXCELLENCE""","We stayed twice in December for two different occasions
The staff were superb so friendly (Edel --front desk--efficient, friendly
On arrival our rooms were ready even at 11:30am Health facilities, Spa and Restaurant each Superb
A fabulous hotel and I would without hesitation highly recommend it.",5,2013,12,21
238,Wonderful hotel in beautiful location,"We spent a Saturday night at this lovely hotel - upgraded on our arrival to a suite.  Very impressed with the warm welcome and polite efficiency at check-in.  The hotel was beautifully decorated for Christmas.  We had pre-dinner drinks in the gorgeous bar - almost scandinavian in appearance, relaxing and classy at the same time.  Ate in the restaurant (there were six of us) and the service was excellent - the waiters judged their attention perfectly and it made for a very memorable dining experience.  The men retired to a beautiful outdoor decking area for cigars and were kept warm with patio style heaters.  Breakfast the following morning was very good - excellent choice and omelettes/eggs/pancakes to order.  If I had to find any little niggles, they would be the supply of tea/coffee making facilities and the quality of the live music in the bar - but these did not detract from a very lovely time at a classy hotel.  Don't leave without a walk around the extensive grounds - they are stunning.  I do not have any interest in golf but if I did, I am sure I would book a round at this resort.",5,2013,12,12
238,Fabulous ,"We stayed in an executive suite and it was excellent. The service was brilliant from the moment we checked in. All the staff were friendly and helpful at all times. I did a spa treatment which was really lovely. Overall, it was a fabulous stay and we would highly recommend.",5,2013,12,08
238,Disappointed Stay.,"We went as a family for my husbands birthday. Our check in was fast and efficient. The staff were very pleasant and helpful. The play area was excellent for the grand children. We were told we had been upgraded, I would like to know what the original room was like. Our room was clean but basic, what I would expect from a 3  star hotel, but not 5 star by any means. Our breakfast was cold, had been sitting for some time. The toaster was broken (one) to accommodate all the guests. We had a dinner included in our package,  it was small and basic, lacked imagination, no sauces and vegetables sparse.  My daughter and I were very sick on the second night, we later realised we both had eaten the  same choice. We spoke to different managers to find out what had happened, we feel we had food poisoning. Our telephone numbers and home address were taken and told they would be in touch as to what had happened. However that was the beginning of October, it is now the beginning of December and we have not been given any explanation. I don't think it was very good customer relations. I Would  not recommend this hotel and definitely not 5star.",3,2013,12,05
238,Peaceful break,"Beautiful modern and peaceful hotel at the foot of the Wicklow mountains. We enjoyed our stay here very much. The staff were very attentive. The food was great in the restaurant. We had a drink in the bar prior to our meal and the bar food looked great also!
The leisure centre was well equipped with a great view of the countryside. Our time there though was marred by three children who were there unsupervised. They spent an hour jumping into the pool, throwing items at each other and shouting - not very peaceful!
The grounds of the hotel are just spectacular. It is well worth walking around the perimeter of the golf course just to see the grounds. It really is breathtaking.
Overall we had a delightful stay and are looking forward to returning",4,2013,12,05
238,Lovely Resort,"Beautiful Resort, the room was perfect.  Staff was very friendly and accommodating.  The restaurant was a little high priced and small portions.  They could improve on that.  We arrived very early in the morning and they accommodated us with a room asap.  That alone was worth a 5 start review.  The lobby was so beautiful.  I really can say enough about the grounds and room.",5,2013,12,02
238,Great Start to our Ireland Vacation,"Located on a beautiful property in County Wicklow, Druids Glen was a great start to our first vacation night in Ireland.  We arrived in the early evening after a long flight and spending a few hours in Dublin.  The front deck attendant was extremely nice and pleasant.  Check in was a breeze and we were happy to learn that our room was upgraded to a suite.  The room was clean, well-appointed and spacious.  Although we had one universal adapter, the front desk loaned us another without hesitation.  
The restaurant and bar located on property were very nice and the food was good.  There was an outdoor terrace but it was a bit cold during our trip and we stayed inside.  We rented a car for our trip to Ireland and would recommend it if you are staying here.  It’s about a 30 min drive south of Dublin and if you are venturing off the property, taking taxis would be a bit costly. Self-parking is available and free.  Will definitely return to this property on future visits to Ireland.",5,2013,12,01
238,really great hotel,"i brought a friend here for her birthday, and were simply blown away, from the minute we arrived we were simply blown away.. the rooms were amazing with robes slippers everything. the staff in this hotel could not have been nicer. Breakfast in the mornings was a dream. we loved the chef cooking omelettes and crepes to order and the food in the restaurant was divine, the spa was so relaxing. will definitely be back.",5,2013,12,01
238,Great hotel,"Stayed recently for a friends party, what can i say - outstanding service, great food, great welcome - just great all round. the rooms were well appointed and excellent value for money. Look forward to coming back time after time. thanks to all the team",5,2013,11,23
238,best ever hotel,"MY husband and I along with our two children stayed during the halloween break. We had a fabulous time.The hotel catered so well for children of all ages. They provided activities in the games room along with two movie viewings throughout the day.The games room had tabletop football,air hockey and space invaders type gamer.  They provided board games from reception along with dvds which were delivered to the room and the dvd player installed. Every morning we had the weather and info of places of interest printed and slipped under the door. The breakfast choice was fantastic with the children enjoying freshly made crepes. Nothing was too much trouble for any of the staff. The swimming pool was spotlessly clean and there was a good variety of times when the children could use this.We enjoyed the steam room and sauna.A lot of attention was given to fine detail especially the furnishings and pictures which provided a very relaxing atmosphere. People just sat around the hotel entrance which had fireplaces and sofas. This created a very calm atmosphere and although the hotel had children of every age and lots of babies, I never heard a child cry the whole time we were there. All in all we had a wonderful time and will definitely be back!!",5,2013,11,20
238,Perfect Night Away,"Stayed here last week for a night and could not have had a better experience. We came as part of a Deal Rush voucher and we were still treated the same as any other full paying customer. Part of the deal was a bottle of presecco on arrival which was already in our room cooling in a wine cooler full of ice. The staff was unbelievably friendly, helpful and treated each guest with nothing but respect. In the bar the barmen came down and took your order instead of people queuing at the bar when drinks arrived they were accompanied by a small bowl for each of us with mixed nuts which was a very nice touch. The restaurant staff were so friendly and helpful and the food was out of this world delicious. The rooms where a little on the hot side and I did have a restless night but the bed and cleanliness was top class. In the morning for breakfast we were shown to our seats and the waitress explained how the breakfast worked and again the breakfast staff were so attentive. The non cooked fresh food were located at top of restaurant in which you helped yourself to fresh fruit, juices, cereals, pastries, cheese and a wide variety of both traditions and continental breakfast. If you wanted hot food you ordered off the waitress I loved this as I knew everything was cooked fresh and wasn't lying out all morning and was delicious. 
When we stayed the weather was wet so we never got chance have a walk about but the grounds look beautiful especially the view from the restaurant and we would have love a walk about.
I would recommend this place to everyone and we will most definitely make a trip back just for the way we were treated alone I can't say enough about the staff that work here they are just top class.",5,2013,11,20
238,5* Luxury and relaxation.,"Just returned from a lovely chilled out few days in Druids Glen.We arrived late enough Saturday night and ate from the bar menu.Food was fab,lovely chicken burger,and the wee guy who served us was a credit to the place,i didn't catch his name but he had dark hair and a goatee,very pleasant chap to deal with.Breakfast the first morning was a buffet style breakfast and the best i've had in Ireland yet,great selection and quality.We ate in the restaurant the second night and the food was exquisite.Great portions,i struggled to leave room for dessert,but glad i did!Second morning,breakfast was cooked to order and was great again.Our room was lovely and spacious and had everything we needed.From start to finish,it was one of my favorite hotel breaks in Ireland to date.
Just a note to parents who bring children with them,please respect that some couples go for rest and relaxation and maybe respect that fact.We were in a room between 2 families who thought it was ok for their children to run up and down the corridors,screaming,shouting and banging doors till nearly 11.30 pm.If i brought my children with me,i'd certainly respect the fact that other people were staying there and wanted some peace and quiet.This is not a hotel issue,just one for parents to note!!!",5,2013,11,18
238,Only ok,"Stayed with my sister for one night as a Girly treat. Definitely not 5 star.

Could be a 4 star but nothing more.

Dinner was good but breakfast was just average buffet..

Rooms dated.

Expensive for what it is!

Mentioned when booking that this was a very special occasion but not recognised at all.. 

",3,2013,11,12
238,Will Definitely be Back,"I brought my husband to Druids Glen hotel last weekend 1st and 2nd November for a surprise,  we were celebrating our silver wedding anniversary.   From the moment we went in the door we knew we were in for a very pleasant weekend.  The staff were extremely helpful and courteous, and couldn't have been nicer.  Our room was pretty standard but very clean and comfortable and we slept very well the first night.  Breakfast was delicious with as much choice as you could hope to get right down to freshly made pancakes by the chef at the food counter. I happened to mention to the receptionist after breakfast that we were celebrating our anniversary so she said we'll do something special at dinner.  During the day a card and chocolates were delivered to our room congratulating us and when we went down to dinner we were given a complimentary glass of prosecco each.  Our dinner was delicious with plenty to eat and when it came to dessert both desserts came out on one big plate with Happy Anniversary written in chocolate around the edge of the plate.  Lovely touch. We were seated for dinner in a quieter part of the restaurant where they seemed to be putting all the couples away from family groups and big groups.  We had a lovely evening and slept very well that night.   We really enjoyed our weekend and it felt very special with those extra little touches from the staff.  The hotel was very busy and there seemed to be a lot of families with young children there and plenty for them to do.  We have stayed in many hotels in Ireland over the years and this is definitely the best.   I cannot complement the staff highly enough and we will definitely go back.",5,2013,11,09
238,NOT 5-star. Poor value.,"Stayed here Friday and Saturday night recently. Had dinner on both nights. Left the restaurant hungry after overpriced paltry dinners. On the second night the waiter forgot part of our order. Our Executive Suite had a gas fireplace that would not ignite each time we attempted to light the fire.   An ""engineer"" had to be called each time we wanted the fire lit! It appears that another guest had this same problem back in August 2012.  Hotel was clean and rooms comfortable but noisy at night.  This guest and his wife expect much more when paying big bucks in a supposed 5-star resort. We left the apparently fully-booked hotel disappointed and wondering if there is a rather large cohort of the Irish populace who do not care or need to worry about value for money.",2,2013,11,08
238,Nice weekend break,"My husband and I had a very enjoyable two night say here on Sunday 2nd November. The staff were absolutely excellent-consistently friendly and helpful from reception to bar staff to restaurant staff. When we arrived on Sunday we went to the bar for some lunch. Surprisingly the hotel had stopped serving alcohol due to an issue with a wedding the day previously (I see a previous review has noted this also).  While this didn't bother us too much there were two ""gentlemen"" close to reception having a heated debate with some hotel staff. The guys looked the worse for wear and I'm guessing they were members of the previous days wedding party. You dont expect to come across issues such as the above when heading for a quiet weekend break in a country hotel! Maybe the wedding planner needs to look at what sort of wedding bookings Druids Glen take on! Found the food in the bar good but quite expensive for what you got. Drinks were expensive too- €5.10 for a pint of Guinness is definitely on the upper end of the scale.
5 stars for service, staff and cleanliness. 4 stars for food. 0 stars for wedding guests behaviour!",4,2013,11,08
238,Family Friendly,"We had a very enjoyable 2 night stay here recently with 2 small children.  The hotel catered so well for children. There was so much for them to do with the pool, indoor and outdoor playgrounds, dvds, walks etc you really didn't need to leave the hotel at all.  The staff impressed me the most they were so welcoming and so helpful and genuinely helpful to us in anything that we asked.  The food was lovely, more than enough choice at breakfast time and it was a great location to explore such the beautiful countryside of wicklow on your doorstep.  Could not recommend highly enough.",4,2013,11,07
238,Nice hotel...shame about the wedding.,"Can't fault the setting, the facilities or the staff generally.  Unfortunately, our stay from Fri 1st to Sunday 2nd November coincided with a wedding at the hotel, the guests of which seemed intent on making everyone else's stay a misery.  You don't expect to hear the Garda in the corridors of a hotel of this stature in the early hours of the morning but that's what we got!  The staff were fairly apologetic and embarrassed the next morning but maybe they should look at the room allocation for families and other guests when there's a wedding on...although I wouldn't say this was your typical wedding crowd.  Sort that room allocation out and I would consider a return visit.",2,2013,11,06
238,We will return,"My wife & I were guests at a wedding reception in Druid's Glen last month. It was our first time there and hopefully it will not be our last. EVERYTHING about the place was perfect, from the friendly greeting at reception to the helpfulness of ALL of the staff. The food was excellent and the setting was truly idyllic. We had a wonderful time and plan to return in the not too distant future.",5,2013,11,05
238,Beautiful,"The place is stunning, room was spotless, lots of towels, reception area was clean and the q's moved along quickly. We had only one issue which was that our window didnt open,i understand that high windows in a hotel cant open but it didnt open one bit, when youv had a drink you just want a bit of fresh air, we cakled reception and they said someone would call up, waited 1/2 hour and nobody came ,then just went on with our business , what if there was a fire in the corridor? A fireman would have had trouble to break the double/triple glazing window,trust me. the bar food was lovely too. Its a lovely place to stay.",4,2013,11,05
238,ANOTHER AMAZING VISIT,"We had another fabulous stay.  Such a warm reception from all the staff.  Nothing was too much trouble.  We were there over the bank holiday weekend with lots of families to enjoy the Halloween/half term events.  I was amazed to find that they had around 120 children in each night.  No one was flustered.  It was so well organised and the whole place ran like clockwork.  Smooth, calm, efficient and friendly service the same as always.  All of the staff were professional and friendly.  Notable staff were a petite young lady on reception whose name sadly escapes me,  Adrienne on reception, Thomas who took care of us at breakfast and the young girl who made pancakes, delicious omelettes and eggs fresh to order for everyone with such calm efficiency. The food was outstanding and the selection was extensive.  We are Gluten Free and they had bread, rolls, sausages and cooked some bacon separate for us.  Nothing was too much trouble.  There are loads of lovely walks around the site, golf, spa, swimming pool, children's play area and live music in the lounge bar when we arrived on the first night.  We had a super three night stay and we are so looking forward to our return visit.  This is our hotel of choice.",5,2013,11,01
238,Great Place Nice Setting Great Golf (Cold Food),"We have gone to Druids Gen as a family 4 or 5 times now. It is very close to Dublin and nice for a quick weekend away without the long travelling with kids. It has all the facilities you come to expect of a hotel in this range. In Druids Glen the Pool and facilities are a little small relative to hotel scale, but they are very clean and in good condition. 

The rooms are very large and clean - but the hotel must be nearly 20 years old. The have done fairly well keeping it in good condition - but inevitably the carpets and rooms are showing their age. A bit of dirt and mould in places. 

I think if you were nit picking you could have a field day - but we were there to enjoy the break and see the good. 

The beds are very soft and comfortable - maybe too soft for some but us 4 enjoyed it ( 3 and 7 year old) 

The treatments and Golf are fantastic - Druids Heath is an open hard long windy tough day (worth it for a lad who likes a tough day) - Druids Glen is one of the best parkland course you will play in Ireland. Great holes - you can see part of it from Bar. 

The only gripe is the food - very good standard of product - but just the finer details letting it down. 
The Breakfast is fantastic for anybody who likes a more continental style , but anybody looking for a full Irish - will get it , but pre cooked and held in Bain-Maire. I guess being realistic and at that price - you can't expect a fleshly cooked breakfast in the scale of a hotel. (Or should you ?)
There is a girl cooking eggs and pancakes fresh , but during mid term she had way too much work for one person.  

The evening meal is a great effort - you will get a great dish. But a gripe of the mother-in-law, she is right - cold food is a big problem in hotels of this scale. It is so basic to start with a hot plate - if the hot plate is cold from the start you are gone. 
Great Irish meat - great effort , but cooking to this level for that many is always going to require max staff and on top of their game. It is a big ask to try do good fine dining in big hotels. 
Other examples were a cold hot desert.

Expense - Drinks very good standard - but a little expensive. 

So overall - very very good - golfer dream - great effort on food - too busy mid term - could be 5 star when on top of it's game.",4,2013,11,01
238,Stay in Druid's Glen,"Had an amazing stay in Druids Glen from the minute we walked into the hotel till we left. The staff were so nice and friendly, room was gorgeous, so spacious with lovely view of the grounds. The meal was perfect, could not fault this hotel on anything. Will definitely be returning !!!!",5,2013,10,31
238,fabulous,"My husband and I had our wedding in Druids Glen. It surpassed our expectations - the staff were all so helpful and friendly. It such a gorgeous well maintained hotel, always so clean. The decor is also so modern and clean but very welcoming too. The food is amazing, compliments to the chef. There was an abundance of food for breakfast, there catered for all dietary requirements, nothing was too much hassle. The bedrooms are amazing especially the bridal suite which we stayed in for a second night well worth it. One thing that I thought was lovely was that the wedding was away from the bedrooms so it wouldnt disturb any guests. I would recommend this hotel to all types of trips, they have a lovely pool, golf and the spa area is so relaxing too. All of our guests who stayed also agreed lovely relaxing place and loved their stay.",5,2013,10,31
238,"Even if time stood still, there's still not enough time to enjoy all this place has to offer.","We were guests at a wedding at the beginning of October but it could have been a summer's day it was so beautiful. From the moment we arrived we experienced the friendly staff, from the doorman who brought in our luggage , the friendly and efficient receptionist, the bar and waiting staff in the function room (sorry I don't remember all the names). Our room was quite large with 2 good sized beds overlooking a grass courtyard. The food was amazing and the function room was really nice. Breakfast was served till 11am which was brilliant as even after a late night we were able to get up on time. The views from the breakfast room were gorgeous, and I love the veranda outside. Unfortunately we were only there for one night and did not have time to avail of the spa which I really regret. It really is a magnificent hotel which seems to cater for all. I noticed a kids playroom near our room, there were lots of couples checking in before playing a round of golf, and girls checking out after a spa weekend. There seems to be a lot of peace and tranquility around the place and I would definitely love to return and get lost in the magic",5,2013,10,28
238,28 oct 2013,Just back from a 2 night golf break could not find any faults from start to finish .Played  druids heath and druids glen both of which had there own challenges the quality and condition was well above our expectations for this time of year. We were very impressed with the friendly staff both in the pro shop and on the course itself. Even some members that we met were very helpful and gave us some good tips .The hotel was very friendly and helpful as we checked in reception helped us to pay the motorway tolls .the rooms and food could not be faulted we will be back,5,2013,10,28
238,Such a friendly hotel,"Stayed for 2 nights last week.  Such friendly staff: it seems a cliche to say that nothing was too much trouble, but it was really true in this case.  The facilities are super for golfers and non golfers and the hotel is in a great location for visiting Wicklow, a beautiful county with so much to see and Dublin is easily reached too.  Restaurant was excellent with a great choice of well-thought through meals (even for gluten allergy sufferers!).  Only one tiny little downside - the pool was used for children's swimming lessons in the afternoons so if you intend having a nice relaxing afternoon swim and use of the sauna/steam room/jacuzzi, it's best to check this out first, as relaxing it is not!  However all in all a lovely break.",5,2013,10,26
238,great hotel,Here for a overnight break with the girls.Hotel is lovley and clean. Rooms are big. Food in restaurant is fab and great service. Bar is quiet no music on sat night.Breakfast is good great choice and again good service. Seems to be kid friendly with playground and play room.,4,2013,10,20
238,wow service !!!,"just back from a brill night in druids glen  
We were checked in by the lovely receptionist Amy 
we had dinner in Atrium rest food was Great but the service by Maeve was WOW !! 
we will be back just for the exellent service  thanks again for a brill night",5,2013,10,20
238,Another lovely wedding,We stayed here for a wedding what a lovely place and from the moment we arrived everything was great.  Lovely helpful staff.  Took our luggage at once to our room. Reception staff were helpful efficient and friendly.  Room was perfect. Ice was delivered on demand. Robes etc lovely. Wedding reception was perfect.  Food drinks and service was without flaw.  Great nights sleep. Breakfast was the one not so good note.  Despite the dinning room not being full we were given no choice as to where to sit . The tables for two were far too close together and in order to access the back seat you had to slid in sideways. I am a slim person. I fail to see how someone overweight. Would access these seats.  It was impossible to have a private conversation as the people  beside you could hear every word spoken. Breakfast buffet was also disapointing .,5,2013,10,19
238,Just Wonderful!,"We stayed at Druids Glen a year ago and had a fabulous time. Again we were not disappointed and it was a shame we were only there for three nights this time!  From the moment we arrived and were met by the top-hatted concierge and checked in with the lovely friendly receptionist to the moment we checked out everything was just brilliant. We stayed in one of the newly refurbished superior rooms on the golf course side of the hotel (they are huge). Last year our only tiny criticism was the the rooms although excellent were a little bit bland and ""corporate""  Not any more! The rooms have been refurbished to a very high standard and the furnishings and colours are beautiful, with one of the most comfortable beds we have ever slept in, and two easy chairs to relax in as well.  The bathroom was a good size, with separate bath and shower, and spotlessly clean.  Breakfast was again excellent - with a great choice of hot and cold items, and also cooked to order omelettes. On the first morning the restaurant was really busy as there had been a wedding the previous day, but the service was still really good.  We ate in the bar one evening and this was pretty good, although there was rather a long wait.  The leisure centre is also excellent and it is great to just be able to walk from your room to the pool/jacuzzi/steam room/sauna in your Druids Glen robe and slippers!  All the staff we met were fantastic - from giving advice and directions of where to visit in the surrounding area, to keeping me supplied with herbal teabags for the room.  It is very rare to stay in a hotel where there are no slight niggles - but Druids Glen has got it just right! Can't wait to return.",5,2013,10,16
238,"Great place to stay, eat and play golf","Four of us who go on golfing breaks regularly together stayed in the hotel last week. We had dined in the restaurant on one night and ate in the bar on another. The food was top class and the burger in the bar was class.Breakfast each morning as lovely especially the omlettes which are cooked in front of you to order and similarly for pancakes. We enjoyed every aspect of the hotel the food, room and leisure centre and the courtesy and attention of the staff was just at the right pitch, very helpful but not too intrusive. We had a very enjoyable night in the bar on the Saturday when a guy from Dun Laoire John Ward I think was his name entertained us for three hours with his guitar playing and great range of songs.We played both golf courses while there. Tip, If you are playing the two Druids courses play the Heath (which is a fine course in its own right) first as it is very hard to appreciate any other course after playing Druids Glen in fine weather. It is a spectacular course which is manicured and every hole is a treat. 
There was a great atmosphere in the hotel and in the Golf Club which proves that if you do something properly that people will come and stay and play.I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone but if you want to combine hotel and golf you cant get better that Druids Glen. Thanks to all the staff we met.",5,2013,10,12
238,Just heaven.,"We had a fab break here from start to finish. Our room was spotless and just a lovely temp. Size wise it was lovely and big and with all the usual five star attractions ie: robes and slippers, nice towel swan on the bed! My partner loved the nice big mugs for his tea as well no little cups for him, it's the little details that make us happy. I would highly recommend this Hotel for a break away. We were totally refreshed and looking forward to our next visit. ",5,2013,10,09
238,family short break,"Lovely hotel/resort that really caters for the needs of a family with young children. Lovely location but really need own transport. We were offered a DVD player at check-in and shown the hotel's extensive range of DVDs, which our toddler loved. There is a lovely playground outside and a playroom in the hotel, which is important given the unpredictable Irish weather. The playroom could benefit from a few new toys, or at least replace some of the missing bits. Nonetheless, it did what we needed it for, ie.occupy the little ones while it rained. The rooms are comfortable, staff friendly and helpful. Food was good but did not entirely reach the expectations for a '5 Star'. Breakfasts were lovely but was surprised at having to queue for toaster, when most 4 Stars I've stayed at bring toast with the teas. Bar food was nice and not terribly expensive, even though we were charged an outrageous E7.50 for a ham & cheese sandwich for a two year old.",4,2013,10,07
238,"Comfortable rooms, lovely food & friendly service","Just back from a fantastic stay for our friend's wedding. The hotel was beautiful & did our friends proud. The drinks reception was lovely & there was an ice cream cart & very tasty canapes. The main reception was faultless. The room was stunning & food & service was top notch.
As for the accomodation - I wish I was still there! The bed was so comfortable. I would love to know where the mattresses & toppers come from!
Breakfast was lovely & offered pancakes & omlettes made to order ...yum. 
As we were there for a wedding we didn't have time to check out all the hotel has to offer but am hoping for a return visit soon.",5,2013,10,06
238,Wedding Reception,My wife's friend invited us to their daughter's wedding reception in Druids Glen Resort last week and we decided to book in for the night and enjoy the celebrations properly. On arrival at the Hotel there was a very friendly concierge at the entrance and 3 very pleasant ladies lined up at reception waiting to check you in. This was the initial very friendly encounter so we were of to a good start. Lovely wide corridors led to a very spacious bedroom room which was well equipped with everything you could want. Service was excellent in all areas. While there was nothing wrong with the food the breakfast buffet did not measure up to the overall standard of the hotel. However I would be happy to return again and sample the range of facilities available. Overall a very pleasant stay,4,2013,09,30
238,Fantastic,"this is my second time staying here - beautiful hotel, on beautiful grounds. excellent staff and service, rooms were huge and spotless. 5 star quality. Also had dinner in the hotel and that was excellent. I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2013,09,30
238,Perfect night away..,"Just back from a fab night at the Druids Glen Resort in Wicklow. It's not very often we get away just the two of us so it has to be right. Druids Glen was the perfect night away. We arrived early and had coffee in the conservatory bar, sharp and attentive service and a lovely atmosphere. The bedroom was perfect, they've had a refurbishment recently and it's spot on. Our bedroom was spacious, bright and perfectly clean and we loved the new colour scheme. We went for a swim / Jacuzzi etc, they've a fab pool there with large bright windows and it was the perfect way to relax before our Spa treatments. Spa was exceptional, the pre-relaxation room is perfectly set, we both had a massage and it was definitely one of the very best. Great service in the bar,Thomas, Philip and Sonny really stood out, and then an excellent dinner in the Atrium which is part of the main restaurant. Service from Tomas was seamless, the food was divine. A great night’s sleep followed by a super breakfast and a walk in Glendalough. We can't compliment this hotel enough it really was the perfect night away. Special thanks to Amy and Adrienne on the desk, Bijoy in the restaurant and our two Spa therapists who really were outstanding.",5,2013,09,29
238,Fantastic hotel,Second time I have stayed in this hotel and again it did not disappoint. All the staff were very helpful and pleasant. Special mention to Teague who helped carry our bags to room. Our room was very clean and spacious and the breakfast and food in restaurant was delicious. Very family friendly as I had my two children with me..definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who has children.,5,2013,09,25
238,Impressive. Never disappoints.,"Been before on a 1 night golf break with the boys and took my wife recently for a 1 night break as part of a week away. From the check in, the Spa treatments and the food then check out, the experience was outstanding. I even sneaked a round of golf on the impressive Heath course while she was in the Spa. Already planning a trip with other couples so they can enjoy the treasure that awaits you at this great complex. Thank you Druids Glen. ",5,2013,09,24
238,"Return visit,even better than last time.","We stayed for 1 night last time where we here and vowed to return for longer with our son.
Having a 2 yr old, staying elsewhere, can be a little daunting!! But Druids Glen really do try to make it a home away from home, but without the duties of home!! It has everything you need and the staff very much accommodate you. I recommended it to a friend with a 1 yr old and  she really agreed after her stay.
From the welcoming staff that greeting him by name and with a gift, to the travel cot with all sheets etc u need. They have a room on the second floor that has things so u don't need to bring, so handy when u already have enough stuff to cart!!! They have a sink, washing up things, microwave, bottle warmer,spare nappies wipes etc, steriliser amongst other things. They also have a brill playroom-Druids den where we spent many a happy hour(ESP when other kids there to play with).they had a variety of toys, books, games, and from what what I could see it would accommodate from a baby to a teenager with the air jockey table! Then outside they have a great, safe playground that our son really enjoyed. The staff in bar and restaurant were very helpful and not at all miffed we land with a toddler(which, yes can happen at places!!!)they went out of their way to see we had what we needed, when we needed it. We  reallycouldn't have asked for more during our stay there. We will definitely go back-again!!! Thanks to all there, ",5,2013,09,20
238,Lovely place to visit!,"We had our second stay here during August, and it was as good as always.  The room was beautiful, clean and spacious.  The staff very courteous and helpful. We didn't have an opportunity to eat dinner, but breakfast was excellent.",5,2013,09,19
238,Golfing paradise,"Just returned from wonderful weekend of golf at the Druids, could not fault the service, the hotel ,the leisure facilities,the bar and the food, all excellent.Most impressive was Druids Glen Golf course ,one of the most beautiful courses I have ever played,stunning golf holes blended into the scenery, pure magic.With the sun shining it really did feel like playing Augusta.
I went as part of a society and we all agreed about the course and how we would all like to come back.On the second day due the vagaries of the Irish weather, we played the Heath in a howling wind and found it a challenge but no less enjoyable, a mighty links/heath land course and although not as strikingly beautiful as the Glen, a great golf course.I think personally the contrast is what appeals most.A great time was had by all.",5,2013,09,18
238,Superb Hotel and Golf Resort,Just back after an overnight stay and two rounds of golf at Druids Glen. The hotel was excellent lovely spacious rooms and very comfortable beds. The food in the restaurant was very good and breakfast was top class. The two golf courses are fantastic. Druids Heath is a links style course in very good condition and is a very stiff test. it also has lovely views of the Irish Sea. The jewel in the Crown is The Druids Glen course a fantastic course with magnificent greens and the best par Three holes I have ever seen. The staff throughout the resort were top class and very helpful and efficient. Loved it and shall return.,5,2013,09,16
238,Thoroughly impressed,"We stayed for 2 nights and we were thoroughly impressed with everything about this hotel. From walking in to the reception, this hotel had a great atmosphere. The grounds were immaculately kept, and lovely to walk around. All of the staff we encountered were welcoming and helpful. We ate in the bar one evening, and the food was very good quality too. The bedroom was spacious with a good size bathroom, spotlessly clean, and very well appointed. We will definitely be back again, and would highly recommend it.",5,2013,09,15
238,5 star at its best!,"My daughter and I stayed here the last weekend in August.  We wanted to treat ourselves to a nice relaxing break with a bit of luxury.  We were not disappointed, the staff are so friendly and welcoming. Our stay was so peaceful yet both days the hotel was catering for weddings and golfing societies but still managed to keep a relaxing environment.  We relaxed in the leisure centre which is very well maintained and enjoyed a lovely walk around the resort's walking trail. We thoroughly enjoyed the BBQ on the Friday night - excellent value, all you can eat for €25pp!! We dined in the restaurant on the next evening and the food and service was top class. I had stayed here some time ago so had recommended it to my daughter, it was exactly what we were looking for and I cannot wait to return.",5,2013,09,13
238,A great location for family and tourists,"Stayed with young family for second year in a row.  Hotel has playroom (although needs a bit of TLC at this point), a small playground at side and a good pool (although no children's pool so small children need supervised closely).  Food absolutely excellent although always busy and bar seemed a bit chaotic for eating for those not in brasserie.  Service is first class, everyone friendly and helpful and room was large and comfortable and had a fridge.  A special offer which gave kids free dressing gowns and rubber ducks was a really nice touch.  Great base for a lot of attractions such as Glendalough, Powerscourt and Brittas Bay beach, all of which are very close.  Look for special offers on website.  Note although golf course attached nowhere to really go for a walk around hotel and car essential.",4,2013,09,09
238,A Great Place to Stay,"If you're looking for quiet Druids Glen Resort is a great choice. The views are wonderfully, the staff extremely friendly, the food is wonderful and the golf is great. While the location isn't just off the highway, it isn't impossible. You will have to navigate a few winding roads though! I would definitely return here.",4,2013,09,04
238,Enjoyed every minute and will return,"We spent three amazing nights at Druids Glen.  From the moment we arrived at the hotel every member of staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful.  In fact it was impossible to single out one one member of staff as they were all equally helpful.  Our rooms were very comfortable and exceptionally clean.  In fact there was an extremely high standard of cleanliness throughout the entire hotel.  

There was a great choice for breakfast and plentiful.  The quality and presentation of the food both in the restaurant and in the bar was equally good.

Its also a perfect location, in the Garden of Ireland.  We will definitely return",5,2013,09,03
238,Great Hotel,"We spent three days in Druid's Glen and from the moment we arrived we were made very welcome.The staff were very friendly and very helpful and it was a very relaxing holiday.
I would hope to return again in the near future.",4,2013,09,03
238,Very Relaxing.... High Standard,"Druids Glen is a great spot to visit. From the very warm welcome to the comfortable rooms, I would recommend a stay here.

While we there as a couple, there seems plenty on offer for families etc. The food in the bar and restaurant is great. The grounds are very nice and the staff are great too.

All-in-all an extremely easy and enjoyable stay.",5,2013,09,01
238,I`ll be back!,"We spent three fantastic days and nights in this hotel. What stood out for us on arrival was the overwhelming friendliness of the staff and the cleanliness and luxury of the hotel. Our bedroom was extremely clean and comfortable. And the same high standard of cleanliness and luxury was evident in every area of the hotel.

We loved the food and again, the waiting staff exhibited the same natural friendliness that could be seen in everyone from cleaners to the porter and receptionists. They all seem delighted to be part of the Druid`s Glen team.

The breakfasts were delicious.Having a free newspaper to hand was a nice touch. We also liked the later breakfast finish (at 11 am) and that we didn`t feel rushed.

The location of the hotel was perfect for Wicklow explorations, plus the grounds of the hotel were prefect rambling territory. We didn`t avail of the golf on this occasion. But that`s only because we want another excuse to return. 

I would highly recommend this hotel for every type of traveller-from families with small children, to older couples, and friends.
Looking forward to another stay. Just hope it can be soon!",5,2013,08,29
238,Loved it!,"Have to say from the moment we stepped into this hotel the staff fell over themselves with friendliness! Felt so welcome upon arrival room was ready before check-in time! Food gorgeous and overall had a great 2 days stay. Kids loved hotel games room, swimming pool and driving range. Love to go back soon!!! ",5,2013,08,28
238,Family trip,"Just returned from another trip to the glen, third year in a row.  Again what a wonderful trip we had, the new refurbished rooms were great and make a big difference.  I could see the wear and tear in previous year, big improvement.  Fantastic leisure facilities and swimming pool.  My only complaint was that we were on the travel zoo deal with 30 euro credit each for the Spa, previously my wife combined this deal and use both credits but this time we were not allowed to do this and as such lost 30 euro for my spa.",5,2013,08,28
238,Overnight stay with dinner,Spent a short (1-night) stay in this hotel for  a special occasion. The situation is beautiful and we had a lovely spacious room leading out to garden.  Evening dinner was very good and service excellent. Super breakfast to finish our stay.   Would highly recommend.,4,2013,08,28
238,Amazing experience,This was the most amazing hotel I ever stayed in. In every way it was first class. Staff are amazing as are rooms and food.  Facilities are tip class especially for kids and price excellent. Will def be back!!!!,5,2013,08,27
238,lovely place,"After staying in the druid’s glen I must say reception staff was very professional and more than help full
Staff in restaurant was lovely and also very well mannered
Floor staff at bar really nice as well
Bar person very ignorant I found and not at all engaging.
Music in bar was one man show but he was very good singer and enjoyed him
The location was breath taking and next time I would love to play on their beautiful golf course.
The evening meal was nice but I would not say the best I have eaten I am glad it was part of the deal because if it was not the, prices they were charging was way over what the food was worth.
Breakfast I must say was beautiful and I enjoyed it.
my wife really enjoyed the spa
The room we stayed in was very clean as was the hotel but I think it is boarding on been a little dated 
Shower was not a power shower which you would expect in a 5* resort 
Over all I must say I loved the hotel but if it had a few minor little twiks and it would take to another level",4,2013,08,27
238,Excellent and great with Children,"I stayed at Druids Glen in early July with my wife and 2 x boys aged 10 &12.
Stayed on the second floor in room 215, which was fabulous.
The room was very spacious, and clean, staff installed a dvd player for the boys and let them use the dvd library.
They then found the great games room, with air hockey, table football and arcade machine all free to use, wow the boys were well impressed.
The pool is great. Staff very helpful and food excellent especially in the restaurant, although bar food is also good, but dishes even though the same were not as good as the restaurant.
Over all excell resort hotel.",5,2013,08,27
238,Golf,"Loved this hotel, it is in a beautiful area and has two golf clubs.  We played in the one that is just up the road, everyone so nice.  We had something to eat afterwards in the clubhouse,it was excellent.  The hotel is very comfortable, bedrooms are very spacious and big bathrooms.  The main restaurant is also very good, great food and excellent service.  I would love to go back and highly recommend for a golf break or just a relaxing break.",5,2013,08,26
238,Lovely hotel but families should opt out of the evening meal package,"Recently home after a four night stay with our three children. The hotel location is excellent for touring the beautiful Wicklow area. We had interconnecting rooms on the third floor which were perfect for the five of us. Found the reception, concierge & housekeeping staff to be superb - all queries were dealt with efficiently, & all with beaming smiles! Breakfast was excellent despite the large numbers at peak times. Our only negative was with the evening meal in the restaurant. We had two evening meals included in our package but opted not to have the second as we were so disappointed with the children's meals on the first evening. Choice was either spaghetti bolognese or chicken gougons, & both options had definitely been left sitting for far too long! Our eldest chose steak from the al la carte menu, & although this was perfectly cooked, the presentation, accompaniments, etc were just a bit too fussy for a young teenager. This type of children's buffet may be acceptable for very young children, but those eight & over will be disappointed. We would definitely return to Druid's Glen, but would eat our evening meal elsewhere.",4,2013,08,26
238,Relaxing experience but on site prices excessive.,"Stated at this resort over the August bank holiday weekend. Room rate was good, but food and drink at the resort were a tad expensive. This was my third visit to the resort. I felt that the standard of service had dropped since my last visit approximately 5 years ago. The five star feel was lacking. Bar food menu is basic and pricy. 

As I live approximately an hour from the resort I would consider visiting again for a last minute get away. ",4,2013,08,25
238,Better Than Abroad By Far!,"Just back from Druids Glen. Recently fractured my ankle so had to holiday at home. 
Our family of two adults & two teenagers 13 & 15., stayed in an executive suite, (very affordable) for three nights. 
Great space, great idea. Kids had their own television, roll out beds, & toilet plus storage. Dividing doors allowed privacy. 
Dined two nights at hotel on package-three course meal. Delicious food, absolutely faultless.

Pool was spotless . There were Bicycles for use, kids said wheels bit flat but had great cycle around hotel grounds. DVD players and lots of movies to watch in the evenings, all free to use in our rooms. Putting range was a great hit with the boys. €10 for 50 or 100 golf balls, cannot remember which. We also spent a super day at Clara Lara which is short drive from here.
But what makes this hotel is the staff. Each and everyone of them could not have been kinder or more helpful, with lots of knowledge of the Wicklow areas. 

I have to say we were blown away by this hotel. 
",5,2013,08,23
238,Great Place,I would say in our Ireland trip..stay at Druids Glen was one of the best...great place....nice rooms...great Golf course ...kids loved it...nice time for kids in the pool...I had a great time in Golf Course...and absolute value for money....2 days stay + golf game for about Euro 300 was absolute worth it...incl great Break Fast...,5,2013,08,22
238,Fantastic experience,"We went to Druids Glen in August for our wedding anniversary.
Upon arrival you are greeted by a very friendly and helpful door man, reception staff are also very warm and welcoming.
We were put in a room facing out the front of the hotel, with beautiful views of the countryside and wonderfully comfy beds!  standard rooms are large and comfortable in size, with a nice large bathroom.
We ate in the restaurant on out first night, and had a delicious meal and good wine selection with verty attentive staff - a local lady serving us advised the best places to visit.
On the second night we enjoyed the weekend barbeque (a little expensive, but good all the same)
Breakfast was equally good with a large selection of breads, fruit, cheeses and cooked breakfasts - you could even have your own omlette cooked to your liking!
The spa area is a good size with all the amenities you would expect (pool, sauna, steam room and plunge pool - quite possible the coldest one in Ireland!!)

Most importantly this place survives on its golf courses, fantastic experience to play the Druigs Glen!
I will definately be back.",4,2013,08,21
238,Honeymoon bliss!,"Stayed here for 3 nights as part of our honeymoon. We were given a magnificent suite. 
The Spa treatments were superb! 
The food was amazing! 
Lots of extra little touches from staff made our stay very special and totally unforgettable! 
Couldn't recommend this hotel highly enough!",5,2013,08,21
238,Excellent 2 night stay for my wedding anniversary,"Myself and my husband stayed for a 2 night stay for our ten year wedding anniversary and I can say it was our best hotel experience we have had in Ireland. We had a lovely anniversary dinner in the restaurant staff were so pleasant and food delicious. Our room was so spacious and bed so comfortable. Hotel is a great location and we visited glendalough only 30 mins away. We visited the spa and had a great facial and my husband enjoyed a lovely massage my therapist roselynn gave me a lovely relaxing facial and helped me with purchasing cleanser sets. We also visited the gym and pool. We enjoyed the BBQ on the Friday night on the terrace and the singer was a nice touch and added great atmosphere. The delight of the visit was the delicious breakfast that was by far the nicest we have had in any hotel ever visited with the omelette and pancakes made to order yummy😀 
Looking forward to a return visit in the near future.",5,2013,08,20
238,lovely hotel,"We enjoyed a lovely stay at this well run hotel, no complaints and will no doubt be back. Didnt get to play a round of golf but perhaps next time. We especially enjoyed the al fresco breakfast on the one sunny morning we had, a real treat.",5,2013,08,20
238,Great,"Was here for a wedding a while back. Very nice place, big rooms, very clean, great food and comfortable. Room was very big with a massive bed that you just sink into! Very courteous staff. Great breakfast, especially the sausages! I'd come back.",5,2013,08,18
238,Stayed as a large family group- no complaints,"Great service, attention to detail, and patience with a large group of varying ages. Surroundings are beautiful and the food was excellent. Great facilities for kids which meant my siblings, who are parents could relax. There was a wedding on in the hotel on the same night and we didn't realise til long after dinner, which was great as it kept the feel of a relaxing hotel.",4,2013,08,15
238,"Had a fab time, great staff","Have stayed in Druid's Glen twice in the past 3 months, once for work and once for a wedding. Both occasions were excellent. Friendly welcoming staff, I even spotted the General Manager offering to take luggage for the wedding couple. The first time I was attending a conference as an exhibitor and we are frequently forgotten about but not so in Druid's Glen, the conference team were always checking in with us to make sure we had everything we needed and I just loved their ice-cream cart - great touch when flagging in the afternoon. The rooms are spacious and have air-con. Second time round I stayed in a recently refurbished room, all lovely soothing colurs and we ate breakfast oon the terrace as it was so sunny. The meals on both occasions were really good and we rolled onto the dancefloor to work off the feed - thank you to all the team at Druid's Glen, we'll be back for a 3rd stay soon!",5,2013,08,12
238,Really Good 4* But Not Quite 5,"I'll start by saying this is a really-really nice hotel and I enjoyed my stay but it falls short on several fronts in what I expect and indeed have experienced in other 5*s, just didn't have that exclusive feeling and attention to detail to give it the ""wow"" factor.

Had booked a 2 night eat and stay package which included dinner on one evening as a birthday treat for my wife.  Arrived on a Saturday afternoon and headed straight for the leisure and spa facilities to recover from a race that we had competed in earlier that day in Phoenix Park.  We were met with a wall of noise and din that sounded as if we were in our local council pool.  Now don't get me wrong they were just kids doing what kids do but ended up having to cut our visit short and headed for the sanctuary of our room.

Room was a good size but again it didn't have the attention to detail to justify the ""deluxe' tag. We had opted to have dinner on the first night and food wise it couldn't be faulted, top notch in fact. Opted for chefs special starter, which on the night was chilli prawns, absolutely suburb. Next up was the steak, cooked to perfection followed by vanilla cheese cake, again really good.

But service wise just wasn't up to scratch which set the tone for breakfast the next morning.  Huge selection caters for every possible breakfast option, so no complaints there. Can't vouch for any of the cooked breakfast as mine consists of porridge, yogurt & fruit and maybe a poached egg on toast, which I opted for on the first morning.

My wife had ordered a boiled egg earlier and had to go looking for it THREE TIMES, first two times the staff apologised saying they had forgot to put the order in.  So when I decided to order a poached egg my wife jokingly said you'll end up having to chase that up again to which I confidently replied ""not a chance""!  Needless to say 15 minutes later I was still waiting and I could have excused it if it was busy at breakfast but to be honest it wasn't.  

So rather than lose face with the good wife I called a waiter to chase up my poached egg! Again he came back to apologise saying they forgot to put the order in, not even close to 3* service never mind 5!!

One other very annoying thing is the stench of smoke that drifts into the dinning room from what is otherwise lovely adjacent covered outside decked area.",4,2013,08,11
238,Little extra's that make the difference....,"Just arrived home today after a 2 night stay here in Druids Glen Resort.  We were there to celebrate my husband's 40th Birthday and we will certainly never forget it!
From the very first communication with Emma in Reservations when I first made enquiries we were made to feel very special and immediately due to the special occasion Emma offered my husband and I a complimentary upgrade to one of their suites!!
We went on the Friday night on our own first and both families joined us yesterday (Saturday) for the celebrations. 
We were not disappointed.  Upon arrival we were greated by Adrianne in Reception - wow was she professional and welcoming.  Such a little thing like walking around from behind the reception desk to give us our keycards and welcoming us to the hotel and give us some information.  She was such a gentle and lovely disposition that we relaxed straight away.
Our suite upgrade was fab....we loved it - thanks Emma!
The back end of the 13th Bar was really lovely and relaxing and we had a bite to eat there on the Friday night - the staff couldn't have been nicer....really accomodating!
Breakfast on Saturday morning was scrumptous.....they had an omelette station also and everything you could ask for!
Family arrived and we went to Powerscourt for a walk around the gardens until the rooms were ready to be checked into.  Both families were on the 3rd floor and absolutely loved the rooms!!
So was delighted that everyone was happy.
We had dinner included in our rate last night in the restaurant and it was so nice!  Again the staff couldn't have been nicer and informative and helpful.
Music in the bar last night with a guy singing while playing guitar - he was very good!
Cleaning staff extremely friendly!

All in all, I absolutely loved loved my first stay in Druids Glen Resort and already my husband and I can't wait to return for our next long weekend away!

Thanks to all in Druids Glen for making our weekend something extra special and we look forward to returning soon!!",5,2013,08,11
238,"Fabulous hotel, great for couple nights away","The hotel staff were helpful and friendly.
The room was spacious and very clean.
The bed huge and extremely comfortable.
The food very tasty!  Both evening dinner and breakfast.  Service at our table was a little delayed.  Not sure why, as other tables were coming and going while we were still there.  Didn't mind on this occasion as we were in no rush anywhere.
It's a very family oriented hotel so if you are coming as a couple be prepared for the noise at breakfast and in the reception areas.",4,2013,08,11
238,A Pleasant Stay,"We have just spent three nights at Druids Glen resort with our ten month old baby. First and foremost we found the staff throughout the hotel extremely friendly and helpful especially Alwyn( unsure of spelling) who looked after us in the restaurant yesterday evening.
The swimming pool was a lovely warm temperature for our baby. 
The hotel is very family orientated with lots of young children , some might not appreciate this but it definitely relaxed us , in that we weren't nervous of our little girl disrupting others.
Our package included two meals in the restaurant which were delicious. On the first night our waiter was Yoseph who was very attentive. When our baby became restless after our main course, he very kindly picked up on this and offered to deliver our dessert to our room which we did.
The only fault we had was that the bar menu was quite limited if you didn't fancy chips and meat.A curry option or tomato based pasta dish would be a nice addition.
we would definitely recommend this hotel to families.",4,2013,08,11
238,Wonderful family break.,"Just returned from a wonderful three night stay in this amazing hotel. Our rooms were on the refurbished third floor and were probably the biggest, most beautifully decorated rooms I have ever experienced. Our four children enjoyed the pool, the playroom, the free bikes, the playground, DVD hire and most definitely the free wifi in the rooms. I would also recommend the fun park Clara Lara, nestled in the woods at Laragh. The staff were attentive and friendly at all times.
My only criticism relates to the leisure centre which needs a face lift and a baby pool. I had no problem with the restricted times for kids as the pool was crammed with kids for most of the day. Our two rooms were also prepared and ready for us when we arrived early.  We ate in the restaurant on the first night as it was included in our booking and the meal was good. We ate in the bar on our last evening and this was better. However we also ate in a restaurant in Greystones called Boccellis and this was gorgeous. The breakfast in the hotel is definitely a highlight as the quality of the food was amazing and the breakfast staff were excellent.  Overall a thoroughly enjoyable and relaxing stay and I would recommend the hotel to both families and couples.",5,2013,08,10
238,Great hotel with great staff,"We stayed for 2 nites in aug 2 adults and 2 children 3 and 10 have stayed before 2 years ago and really enjoyed the hotel. This time same again lovely hotel staff this time were even more helpful and friendly if that's possible and couldn't do enough for us the room was lovely enough space for 4 and didn't feel cramped at all we had 1 meal in the dinning room which was nice not so happy with the kids meals left bit to long to be honest some of the burgers dryed out and hard and the pasta for my 3 year old rubbery and sticky think when cooked and left in a heater this is gonna happen but didn't expect my kids food to be so bad when the our food arrives so nicely presented
This time we were informed that u had to wear a hat in the pool so that was €3 each then a swim nappy €2.50 I think as they r material hats they could rent them cheaper and wash them after an expensive day out to come no to the hotel thought a swim would be nice then to find we had another €14 to pay in the hotel 
They have the games room it is a good room to have for kids as both mine enjoyed playing in it and had good variety of toys for both ages 3+10 
Used the spa this time for 2 treatments which they had the a package on special offer good deal spa was amazin very relaxing and calm the staff encourage u to stay and relax they supply drinks and fruit and the treatments were amazing.
Overall we enjoyed the stay but the kids meals really need to be better 
But the staff hands down done everything to make the stay good for us and the kids",5,2013,08,10
238,Nice hotel but lacks 5* luxury,My family of 5 stayed here for four nights in interconnecting rooms.The staff were lovely and very helpful especially to young children . I agree with one of the other reviews with regards to cleanliness of rooms. They really don't have the luxury feel of a 5 star hotel and all the glass needs attention as mirrors and table tops were all smeared as were the doors in the corridors . beds were not turned down at night time which has always been my experience in 5 stars hotels. the buffet breakfast was of a very high standard but the carpet around the buffet area needs attention as its very dirty indeed.The concierge was  extremely pleasant and certainly would make customers feel most welcome. the food in the bar is very expensive 14 euro for a basic triple decker sandwich. restaurant food was good but definitely on the expensive side .,4,2013,08,09
238,Definitely not a 5 star.,"I have recently returned from a two night stay which was very pleasant.  We had interconnecting rooms which were spacious and well laid out. Breakfast was very good, we had lunch in the bar twice and dinner in the restaurant once. The food was very good if overpriced and the staff were very attentive.  However, I wouldn't rate this hotel as 5 star. We arrived with four small children, room wasn't ready until 405pm and the connecting room not until 430pm. It does state 4pm check in on the website but I think they should prioritise having rooms ready for families with small children.  The rooms are fine, spacious and the beds are comfy, but they getting a little tired. On our second day we went out sightseeing all day and didn't return to the hotel until 430pm, I was looking forward to heading to the room for a rest and was very disappointed to find neither room had been made up!!!  I realise the hotel was very busy but I would suggest more housekeeping staff are required.  The pool has no shallow end for children, a child would need to be at least 7 or 8 to be able to stand comfortably.  Apart from this the children are very well looked after with the park, bicycles, games room and there is a kitchenette if you have a small baby.",3,2013,08,09
238,3 Excellent Nights @ Druids Glen,"I recently enjoyed a 3 night stay at Druids Glen with my wife and kids (6 months and 2). The staff were the most warm, helpful and professional I have ever encountered. Our double room was spacious and more than capable of accomodating the 4 of us. As we were on a budget, we didn't eat in the resturant in the evenings. The breakfast however, was out of this world and provided an excellent start to a day of exploring the best of Co Wicklow.",5,2013,08,08
238,Lovely... But!!,"We have just returned from a two night stay in the hotel. I cannot praise the staff enough. They were all so attentive and lovely. The afternoon tea was better than a top 5* hotel in Belfast. Our starter and main course were excellent that evening.  However, now to the but.... Our room was large and spacious, but was very shabby!!! The paintwork was chipped, and the throw on our bed had seen better days. It was  most definitely not a 5* room. We were so looking forward to a little luxury and chose this hotel over others. I am particularly peeved having just read that other guests got lily o'brien chocolates, when all we got was a lonely swan fashioned towel sitting on our less than well dressed bed. I would only return if I was assured the room would reflect other aspects of our stay.  It may seem silly but now that our children are up and away it's the finer aspects of hotels that attract us.",3,2013,08,07
238,Stellar quality,"We have just returned from an amazing three night stay in the fantastic Druids Glen resort. This hotel oozes class; the ambiance; the professionalism of staff and the service quality surpasses everything else I have experienced in this country recently. We last stayed there in November 2011 and there has been further improvements on what was already recognisable excellence in that time. This epitomises the raison d'etre of the hotel - to continually enhance the consumer experience. I can't recommend a visit here highly enough.

With two young kids (3 yrs and 1 yr) we always look for a home from home experience and this is exactly what you get and more at Druids Glen resort. We had a DVD dropped up to our room so our little girl could look at her favourite bedtime cartoons, we could prepare their bottles in the family kitchenette and take them for a play in the downstairs. Not to mention the excellent menu in both the bar and restaurant.

Travelling and entertaining kids can be difficult but Druids Glen makes it easy. We are eagerly looking forward to our next visit! Thank you to all the staff who made it so easy for us and also so memorable.",5,2013,08,07
238,"Excellent hotel, beautiful estate","Stayed for three days over the long weekend with my girlfriend.  I have to say the hotel is managed expertly and all our needs were met. 

The room we had was all that you'd expect from a five star hotel and the gym facilities are also top notch.

The breakfast buffet was delicious with a wide selection to choose from.  All of the staff we came across were helpful and courteous.  We hope to stay again very soon.",5,2013,08,07
238,Fantastic hotel with very attentive staff,"We stayed for 1 night last month, and how I wish it was for longer!
From the welcoming staff, to the plush bedroom with the most comfortable bed to the most Amazing choice of breakfast buffet I have ever seen. We couldn't have asked for more during our stay there. We will definitely go back!",5,2013,08,05
238,"Excellent staff, top class hotel",We stayed here for 1 night away with our 3 year old and 10 week old and can't praise the hotel and staff enough. Every single staff member we came in contact with went out of their to ensure a pleasant stay and were very good with interacting with the children and giving a helping hand. The only regret we have is only staying 1 night. We'll definitely be back. Top class hotel +++++,5,2013,08,02
238,Pleasant Stay,"My husband and I recently stayed in your hotel, overall we had a very enjoyable stay.  Our room on the 3rd floor was pleasantly decorated, with some nice touches - Lily O'Brien chocs, comp water etc.  We found the hotel clean and well kept, my husband played the Druids Glen course, which was a fantastic course and highly recommended!  

The only negatives we found were the choice of food in the bar, I thought it was a disappointing and pricey menu for bar food, and the food was just ok. we didn't eat in the restaurant as it was above our budget.  On our second day we went into Greystones (5 - 10 min drive) for food, which has a fantastic selection of cafes and restaurants, really good food and competitively priced.

The other point I would make is this hotel attracts a lot of families and children, this is not in any way a negative point but perhaps if you were looking a quiet, romantic break this might not be the hotel I would select.

Overall, the staff in the hotel were absolutely lovely, they couldn't do enough for you, we really enjoyed our stay, however, I'm not sure I would rate it a 5* hotel.",4,2013,08,01
238,Good but....,"Stayed 4 nights in a suite with 2 young children (2 yr old & 9 month old). 1st suite was shabby and dirty - ill fitting carpets, no carpet strip between joining carpets- just left rough cut, plastic hanger clips on floor, dead flies/cobwebs in window, filthy baby blanket provided in travelcot and v. dirty skirtings. I prob wouldnt have minded as much but I have a crawling baby. Don't usually ever complain but really disappointed so contacted reception got room changed no problem. Much nicer room - better finish but still a bit shabby (i know they are doing a refurb) and still not the cleanest. Childrens legs and feet were black from crawling on carpets. Carpet really dusty underneath bed. (it had moved slightly from its normal position). Honestly wasn't trying to find dirt! Cleanliness of sheets, towels etc fine. 
On the plus side all staff v friendly, helpful and efficient. Breakfast good quality and selection. Ate in bar 3 nights and it was fine.  Excellent playground facility. Good playroom but again looks like its never been cleaned. Had a lovely spa treatment - Druids Signature. Husband used gym - good. Pool good but too deep for toddlers and young children.  Prob need to be at least 6 yrs old to stand comfortably. Nice location. Lots to see and do. Overall a pleasant stay but would not return due to poor standard of cleaning of rooms which is a pretty basic thing to get right. I have never had this problem in a hotel before.",3,2013,07,31
238,"Fantastic staff, service and location","We stayed for five nights in the resort and from start to finish the service was brilliant. The kids get a special check in with an activity pack.  There is a kitchenette with sterilisers, nappys and baby food. The indoor and outdoor play areas are second to none and kept very clean. A special mention needs to be given to the concierge. He is so friendly and a true gentleman.  The staff were all so friendly and nothing was a bother to them. They just went out of their way for everyone. The room was clean and spacious and the pool and spa were beautiful.  We will definitely be returning.",5,2013,07,29
238,"Very good hotel, full of families with young children","Very good 4 night break away to Wicklow, hotel was full every night, lots of families with young children. Plenty of child friendly activities in the hotel, including play park, children's soft play activity room, kids golf, and a swimming pool. Good feature of the hotel was a kitchen available for parents to wash and sterilise bottles and prepare/ heat baby food. 
Food in the hotel: breakfast -  full selection of Irish and continental breakfast  with crepes and waffle station for the kids, homemade granola is excellent, there is always a rush for strawberries in the fresh fruit station.
Lunch - bar very good and relaxed atmosphere, kids mingled with others whilst waiting for food.
Dinner- bar is excellent, good food and service. 
The restaurant is good although was I was slightly restricted to choice as I am expecting and wasn't allowed a good part I the menu!! Service in the restaurant was excellent.
Kids menu
Very good child menu.
Check-in
Disappointing as we had to hang about waiting with 3 young children in the foyee whilst the hotel tried to sort out a problem,  had our dates noted incorrectly in the system and a suite we had booked was not available. Thankfully we had brought an emailed print out of our 
Itinery showing the correct dates and Suite booked. Don't know what happened between our time of booking and arriving but we ended up in a superior room, very cramped for a family of 5.  The next day we packed everything up again for the porter to transport it to one of the now available suites. There was no comparison- plenty of space - 2 interconnecting rooms (bedroom 
and lounge area). 
Housekeeping
Generally good although we had to request bedding to be changed. Plenty of fresh towels, room was serviced once in the morning then turn down service in the evening with chocolates left on everyone's pillow. Their toiletries were ok, toilet roll is rock hard though!! 
All in all a good value break if you are travelling with a young family. Dont understand how this hotel is rated 5star, more like an average/good 4 star. Facilities and service and amenities no where near 5 star.

",4,2013,07,29
238,Top notch - highly recommended,"This is a super hotel from beginning to end of our stay. The hotel changed management recently but kept the same staff and, more importantly, kept the same high quality experience.

We live nearby and have used the hotel for short breaks for special occasions (and when the house was having a big job done on it) and have never been disappointed. Our most recent stay confirmed that all is still in excellent order.

Staff are very friendly and capable, leisure centre is excellent, dining is very good quality, ambiance is always good as there is always a good crew in and around the hotel for various events, but I've never found it to be too crowded.",5,2013,07,29
238,"Excellent staff, great service! Perfect stay.","Stayed at Druids Glen Resort for our 6 year anniversary. From the warm greeting by the doorman to the excellent receptionist, the staff were top notch. We were even upgraded to a larger room which was a nice touch. Dinner was perfect and even though it was a Saturday it was busy but the staff were excellent. Attentive and efficient at the same time. Room was large and very modern. All mod cons. Chocolates and a welcome card delivered to the room was also a pleasant surprise. Bed was the most comfortable i have ever slept in. There was a wedding on but there was no noise and the wedding never interfered with our romantic break. Breakfast was as good as you would want and there was plenty to choose from. Overall a great stay in a lovely hotel with great staff. We'll def be back. Highly recommended. ",5,2013,07,28
238,We'll definitely be back,"My husband and I stayed there for our 15 year Wedding Anniversary at the end of June and from the minute we arrived the service was excellent. The staff could not have been any nicer and although we have stayed in 5 star Hotels before, Druid's Glen was definitely our favourite. When booking the Hotel I mentioned that it was our Anniversary and when we had our meal, the waiter brought out a dessert with 'Happy Anniversary' written in chocolate across the plate. I used the Spa facilities which were excellent and my husband went for a swim, and he commented on how nice and warm the temperature of the pool was. We will definitely be back with the kids in the near future. The food was delicious and it was nice to be able to order an omlette for breakfast.",5,2013,07,27
238,If golfs your game this is the place,Very enjoyable stay here absolutely fabulous golf courses will result in a return visit. Buffet breakfast in the morning was also the best of the week. The Thirteenth Bar slightly let down the experience with average food at high prices. Great stay overall many thanks,4,2013,07,26
238,Friendly attentive service,"Staff and service was perfectly friendly and accommodating.  Used the babysitting service which was organised at a moments notice, and it was great.  Took a suite which was very spacious, quintessentially Irish, though not very modern.  Will be back again.",4,2013,07,26
238,Back again,"Attended a wedding here recently. Overall we were highly impressed however on checkin we found a used towel in our room. That I'm pleased to say was the only negative of a fab weekend!
Will deff return soon.",5,2013,07,23
238,Favorite hotel in Ireland,"This is the perfect hotel for a romantic break. The rooms are very spacious and the beds are so comfortable. The bar food is top class and the pints of Guinness are amazing. Also I have never had a better breakfast at a hotel, fills you up for the day! I have stayed here many times and I cannot wait for my next stay!",5,2013,07,22
238,Great relaxing 4 days,"This is the second time we have stayed in the resort in recent years. Great base for exploring Wicklow and beyond. Very friendly and attentive staff which creates a homely and welcoming atmosphere. We stayed from Monday 15th July to Friday 19th and enjoyed every minute of it. We were two adults my teenage son and 11 year old daughter. Will certainly return for another stay.
Hearty Family Tipperary",5,2013,07,20
238,Fantastic,"This was our 4th time to the resort for our wedding anniversary. We travelled with our daughter. There was a box of chocolates and a card in our room and we were givin a free drink at the end of our meal. The pool is beautiful, lovely and warm for children and plenty of floats etc available. There is a lovely playroom and playground outside and the family room, complete with steriliser, microwave, nappies etc is a real bonus!
Rooms are lovely and big, with every comfort in mind, extra pillows etc and fluffy bathrobes which are great for going to the pool
The food is lovely and breakfast is amazing! The staff our very welcoming and were lovely to our daughter! We love Druids glen and hopefully will get back again after our son arrives!",5,2013,07,18
238,excellent hotel,"We arrived in basking sunshine at this beautiful resort. Tucked away in the heart of County Wicklow. The welcome throughout the hotel is one big hearty welcome. Staff were always helpful, attentive and able to share information on local attractions. Local things to do are well known powerscourt, glendalough etc however given the amazing weather we are having we wanted beaches. The reception staff held maps for each location and advised on lifeguarded beaches, difficult to get to beaches and sandy beaches. (hard to believe we are talking about Ireland). 
The rooms were excellent newly decorated lovely carpet throughout the property fantastic stairs. Bedrooms were spacious, we had a superior double which was ample for four. Stunning bathroom with separate shower. no view to speak of but just lovely to see the sunshine each morning. Many of the rooms at the back of the hotel have a view of the extensive golf course maybe it was just overgrown. Free bicycles were offered to all guests to cycle on the cycle track in the grounds we didn't venture any further.
Breakfast had everything you could possibly imagine and would fill you for the day. Breakfast manager Kasia was particularly welcoming and friendly asking about your plans and how yesterday went.
We didn't play golf but there were offers for children to try it out on certain days.

swimming Pool ~very limited access for children  (up to 16 year olds) 9~12 noon  3~7pm given the extraordinary number of children in the complex this needs to be changed particularly in the summer. Aqua aerobics run during this time taking up a third of the pool a swimming lane for the swimmers takes another big chunk so lots of families were turned away. The manager needs to look at the use of this pool. at 12.05 1 person was in the pool 10 minutes earlier it was standing room only with youths jumping in and small children in the plunge pool and steam room. The general manager had obviously had a complaint about cleanliness he pointed out areas to be cleaned. the guys don't seem to know how to back scrub ~dusting just wont do it! the pool had a lot of sand in it and also needed more cleaning around drains, sides etc. pool far too warm.
DVD players in most rooms with a selection of dvds for children at reception each day. 
Special welcome from Tague at the door to take your bags and ask about your day much appreciated. 
a sheet came in each day of local activities spa availability and a write up on a local attraction.a good idea.",5,2013,07,18
238,Another great stay for the price (not full price),"Third stay in 3 years, cant beat it for the price, when on offer (90-110euro a night inc breakfast for 2 adults and a child) and we stayed for 3 nights. For full price there are nicer hotels in that price band.
They are renovating the rooms, but you pay extra for a renovated room, which personally I feel not right. The standard rooms are now tired and need doing asap, but again the price for a renovated room is on par with hotels of much higher standard.
We had 2 double beds, warning, their website sells the room on 2 queen double beds, but they are not, they are standard doubles. I know this as I am over 6ft.
The beds have mattress toppers, but one of ours didn't have this, but I didn't bother to complain.
There is also a gap under the room door on every room, enough to put your fingers under. Yes they have put a brush strip at the bottom, but that wouldn't stop any noise of people going past. woken up a few times in the night with people passing. 

What is great about this hotel is,
-the staff are friendly
-the food and breakfast is great
-the location is lovely
-great children facilities

Again, its a fantastic hotel at offer price, and that's why I give it 4 star rating, but I would never pay full price as its not worth it compared to others that offer a real luxury 5 star experience for a similar price.",4,2013,07,16
238,All the staff work very hard to make this a good resort.,"Hello, I just spent 3 nights here with my family including a 12 year old and a 9 year old. The food is good, the service is good. I actually didn't play golf on either of its fantastic 18 hole courses. They looked pristine.
Free resort bikes to borrow, with helmets for the kids and adults. I had a comfortable time. 
The place is screaming out for a ZIP WIRE to ride down through the trees to the valley below. Maybe that's just the kid in me? 
I spent alot of cash here but I got what I paid for. Well done. I'll definitely consider staying again.

I've never ever seen so many children in a hotel with their families. The dining room staff were very friendly once you said ""Hello"". Very nice and chatty.",4,2013,07,14
238,Ideal base when visiting Wicxlow,"Enjoyed our stay at Druids Glen found the staff to be exceptional and a great asset to the hotel. Our room was large and spotlessly clean with everything you would need, loved the separate shower unit in the well-equipped bathroom. One evening we stayed in the hotel for dinner and were able to get a DVD player (some films also available from reception) and watch a movie.  Breakfast was ok, nothing special usual buffet stuff, we were a bit disappointed with the bar and restaurant menus nothing exiting however, did have a burger one evening and to be fair it was very tasty. 

If you are looking for somewhere else to eat try the Hungry Monk or the 3Q’s in Graystones (10 min drive away) for fab food.  

Not sure I would return to Druids Glen, mostly because of the location and the fact that there were a lot of small children.  No fault of the hotels, and I would certainly recommend it to others.",4,2013,07,12
238,First class golf experience !,"I have been to this resort some 8 years ago and it is still a very fine venue.  Rooms are spacious and very comfortable.  Full marks on that.  Bar was excellent as well.
The only downside was the diner at the restaurant.  Service staff was very attentive
and professional but the food was just average.  A bit more creativity and a better choice of ingredients would probably enhance it but i would expect a better class restaurant in this resort.  Only minor point compared to last time.  Breakfast was very good.  And then there is the golf ....  The Heath wonderful links course and probably more difficult than Druids.  The champs course is just awesome.  I had a glorious day with a slight sea breeze and the course was in excellent condition.  Just outstanding.  Food and beverage at the Club house as well as the very attentive and professional staff was of the highest standard.  Only room for improvement is probably the driving range at Heath.  Whereas the whole resort and golf courses are in immaculate condition, it appears there was no budget left to create a decent driving range. It looks a bit worn, a couple of distance meters and that's it.  Would give it an overhaul to make the whole resort a perfect place to stay for an loooong golf outing.",4,2013,07,09
238,Great place to unwind,"I came here for a night away to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city and work.  I'm not sure what it is,  but feel instantly relaxed and chilled out while staying here. Love this place, great place to relax and unwind.",4,2013,07,04
238,Druids Glen,"Our second visit to this hotel.  We were not disappointed as the staff remained as friendly as before and the golfing facilities were excellent.  The food in the evening was good but not as good as the pre joys year - the chef had changed. Breakfast remained outstanding with a huge range on offer.  
Our only gripe was the gym where the equipment was in need of a lot of maintenance eg several machines not working the seat of one of the bikes badly ripped and machines not properly calibrated.",5,2013,07,04
238,Best short break with the kids!,"Just back from 3 nights at the Druids glen resort where we brought our 3 children age 3, 4 & 8. From start to finish they thought of everything- fab games room, playground & pool. Get interconnecting rooms on pool level it makes it so much easier! Great bar food menu all homemade so thankfully not a processed nugget in sight! My 8 yr old loved the free bikes around the resort. All in all we will definitely go back!",5,2013,07,03
238,Druids Glen Resort a family resort not for a romantic break!,"We stayed one night in Juney husband played golf and said the course was amazing excellent layout and greens and rough very well kept. 
Food in the 13th very very pleasant I had the chicken burger and my husband had the steak burger both well presented and extremely tasteful well with the money service in here was excellent staff very pleasant and helpful, the only downside it had several unruled children running around with NO parental control this is not the sort of atmosphere one would expect in such a peace resort.
We biiked a suite and it was tired snd in need of refurbishment although clean and well presented. Again I  was amazed that this is not a romantic haven with the prices they charge the amount of very loud squealing children was appalling how can you be expected to have a romantic break? The soundproofing of the rooms is not the standard in other 4-5* hotels (Harvey's Point) our usual escapism is so much superior in every aspect. An excellent family hotel but please do not book this resort for a romantic break!",3,2013,06,30
238,Heavenly,The arrival at our hotel set the president for the midweek break. The warm smile and kind greeting we recieced at reception was next to none. The eagerness of the staff to help us was amazing. The place was spotless comfortable and serene. The food was tantalising and our meal in the restaurant was incredible. The location is perfect for visiting lots of the beauties of Wicklow with none being more the 20 25 min drive away. The spa was an experience in itself a haven for the tired working mum to totally forget everything for a little while anyway!!! I'd highly recommend this place to everybody you won't be disappointed!! The trip was further highlighted by our engagement the staff gave us a couple of little treats that we were truly thrilled by. So thank you all for making my birthday and engagement an absolute pleasure and memorable to boot. Aisling,5,2013,06,30
238,"Great place to stay, hold team events and have fun","I have stayed in Druids Glens many times and each time has been better than the last!

I recently booked a team building event based in Druids Glen which involved an overnight stay, team dinner and team activities during the day - as the team was a mix of people across Europe and city slickers from different parts of Ireland, I needed help to come up with ideas & Druids Glen team came up with great ideas, liaised with the activity company and ensured everything went smoothly. We had a great day doing farm Olympics and sheep herding, and the feedback from the team was that it was the best team building event they had ever experienced from start to finish which I put down to the attention to detail of the Druids Glen team, service at the restaurant and the repartee the team had with the bar staff. 

I would highly recommend Druids Glen for team events and for couple and friends get togethers - the deck is amazing in a hot summers day!",5,2013,06,26
238,Lives up to reputation,What a super place to stay. My family just enjoyed super mid-week break. I can't say enough about the staff- nothing was too much trouble.  It had all the amenities of a lovely five star hotel but none of the stuffiness!!! The food was exquisite and the concierge provided us with a superb itineary of places to visit in the locality. I will defiantly be going back and recommending it to everyone- well done to the management and team there!!!!,5,2013,06,25
238,Great Lunch,"Had a lovely lunch with a few friends in Druids Glen last Sunday... It was a beautiful day and we had drinks on the out door terrace which was great so nice to eat outside in Ireland.  I had my little boy with me and the staff gave me a DVD with a childrens video which was a lovely touch.
The staff were so nice and the food was excellent they have great chunky chips.. We went for a stroll after lunch and discovered the great playground they have, will definetely be back a true find...",5,2013,06,24
238,Love it!,"I have been to Druids Glen a few times with my husband and 2 young children, and we love it.  The staff are friendly, the food is great, there is lots to keep the children entertained.  Its a little bit if luxury, in a down to earth, family friendly atmosphere.  We've already booked our next stay!",5,2013,06,24
238,Super break,"We have just returned from a weekend in Druids Glen Resort.  Have to say we had a great family break (children 10 and 11):  staff super efficient, beautiful countryside and walks, golf courses are a picture, lovely leisure facility and great food. Liked the little extras for the children:  games room, free DVD and movie library, bike rental, freshly made pancakes for breakfast and good children's menu. My daughter had a broken bone in her foot during our stay and we have to commend the staff for being so helpful and accommodating. 

I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to my friends and family and we will definitely be returning.",5,2013,06,23
238,"Very Good, but bedrooms let it down","A group of us stayed here for a function. The location is superb and an ideal setting for weddings, balls, functions etc. The meal was superb and quite possibly one of the best I've had at a large scale dinner. The service, the food and the amazing ballroom all combined to create a great evening. We had lunch the following day in the bar which was flawless as well. What lets this resort down though is the bedrooms. We were checked in by a somewhat cold receptionist, not a problem we all have off days. The room was a trek from the main part of the hotel, not an issue though. We had booked a twin room as we were friends and the most noticeable issue was that one bed was higher than the other. Needless to say I fought for the one with the mattress topper. The rooms are dark and a little bit of a let down in comparison to the impressive public areas if the hotel. The robes had a tendency to she'd as well. However the linen was good, toiletries were very high end and the room featured water, biscuits etc. One of my favourite parts of staying in a high end hotel is turndown service and this was poor. The towels were not replaced nor the used toiletries. All little niggles but had they not occurred this hotel would be scoring a five star review. Overall a good stay, but bedrooms need to be looked at. ",4,2013,06,23
238,Well Done Druids Glen.,"This was my second stay at Druids Glen.
I could not fault anything at this Hotel.
Any staff member I came across was very friendly and helpful. 
Food was excellent, yes it might be a bit expensive but I don't mind paying once I'm getting what I paid for. 
I highly recommend a trip here, even if its just for dinner or lunch.
I live in Swords (beside Airport) and it took me 40mins to get there.
Keep up the excellent work Druids Glen.",5,2013,06,19
238,Excellent Break!,"Attended a family wedding here end of May. Everything was perfect. The venue, the food, the rooms, the staff. Nothing was any problem. And breakfast on both mornings was the best I've ever had. Huge selection and you could ask for anything that wasn't on view and they seemed to have it! The fresh fruit was the best! Beautiful location, only 20 mins from Dublin yet you feel you're miles from anywhere.",5,2013,06,17
238,Good and bad....,"Generally we enjoyed our stay. Food was excellent, from the bar to the restaurant to breakfast. Staff also very good especially on check in. 

Setting is good though not a lot for non golfers to do. A semi nice walk around the golf course though having the second 2km basically walking along the verge of the main road is not safe. At all.

Our big problem was the room. Not because its a bit tired which it is and thats fine but its because its an adjoining room with the worst soundproofing I have encountered. Sure if you have a family that might be ok but if you have two couples next door to each other it is fairly farcical. 

Wouldn't be one to complain but at three o'clock in the morning, I had to call reception to ask them to get our neighbours to turn down their tv. All apologies but it shouldn't happen. 

You pay a premium to stay but that annoying. Didn't get much hop on check out other than to confirm some people complain about it. Weird in itself so would be reluctant to recommend despite the good points.",2,2013,06,16
238,I hope the Brasserie is better than the bar,"We ate in the bar in Druids Resort  a couple of weeks ago and were completely disappointed. This is apparently a 5* resort but the food was far from it. The choice on the menu was very poor, had very little in way of healthy options. We ordered a chicken burger and battered cod and chips. The batter was thick and greasy, the chips appeared as though they had been sitting in grease for a long time. To try to make up for the disappointment we ordered a lemon tart to share for dessert, priced at €7.95 we were expecting a decent sized portion, however, it was far from this. With our mains costing €31, it was a complete rip-off for terrible food.",1,2013,06,11
238,Lovely Stay,"One night stay and we were going to make the most of it!  We arrived to a lovely professional welcome and even though we were very early our room was ready for us. I was impressed with the large airy room and lovely bathroom with separate shower and bath (and Im not easily impressed). Loved the lobby area and sat there drinking our coffees (with complimentary cookies, the husband was in heaven) and watched the world go by.  Used the swimming pool a few times and found the staff there very helpful, advising us which times were less crowded.  Had bar food on the evening of our stay and the staff were friendly and helpful and the food was tasty.  Very impressed with the breakfast the next morning, loved the home made granola and the omelettes made to order.   Great selection of food but as another reviewer mentioned... standing over the toaster was a bit of a pain.  Surprising for a 5 star hotel.  There were a lot of families with small children which I wasn't expecting. More family orientated than couples getaway I feel.  There were 4 communion parties and a wedding on that day but you wouldn't know they were in the place.  Loved it, and will go back.",4,2013,06,11
238,Best place we stayed and golfed!,"I would like to thank the staff at the pro shop and hotel for being exceptional! The golf course was amazing to play. The rental clubs were top notch. There was a complication and we had to stay in the resort, which we were not planning on doing. We are so glad we did. The hotel is excellent. The best place I stayed in Ireland. The bar was a great place to unwind from the day and the food was 5 stars. I wish I could remember everyone's names that were so helpful. Aimon in the pro shop and Duncan at the hotel are only two of the great people we met. 

I would say this is a must see on any trip to Ireland!",5,2013,06,10
238,Lovely hotel in beautiful location,"We stayed here last weekend for 2 nights dinner & spa package.  Arrived 2.30pm on the friday & was warmly greeted at reception.  Our room was ready even though checkin was not until 4pm.  Room was very spacious with slight view of golf course, large flat screen tv, fridge etc as you would expect of a 5* hotel...  Large bathroom however there was a gap under the shower door which my husband discovered this when he neary flooded the bathroom!! (Room 323).  Got a knock on the door & it was a card from the hotel with a little box of chocolates for our anniversary which was a lovely touch.  Dinner that evening in Brasserie was lovely & again service was 1st class.  The bar itself was a bit disappointing for a 5* hotel, not much atmosphere for the weekend & old fashioned.  Could do with a re-vamp & a bit of mordernisation.  We both went for spa treatments on the saturday which I highly recommend.  Michelle in the Spa was very pleasant as were the other staff.  On checking out I went to settle bill & on checking it was over charged 25 euro!!  Bar man brought me a vodka in error but didn't adjust it off the bill.  Another receipt for our room was not my signature & a few had no signatures so before settling bills I would check them in detail.  Reception did however adjust the bill with no hassle at all.  To sum up my experience.  Lovely hotel, lovely food, extremely pleasant staff, beautiful grounds.  5* rating is probably due to the golf course as hotel itself was more like a 4*.  Would go back again & would recommend to others.",4,2013,06,07
238,Family friendly - fantastic staff,"Rarely does a hotel deliver on promises but Druid's Glen is working very hard to get there.
Our bank holiday room was ready at lunchtime and nicely located near the new kids playroom.
We were worried about sound leakage from corridor and rooms but had no such problems.
  
The ground floor bedroom was just large enough for 2 doubles and a roll-away for 2 kids and 2 parents, but larger than most of this type.
Nice touches include coffee maker, robes, slippers, water and empty mini-bar. 
Nice touches outside include playground and free bike hire.

The pool and area was great for families and a little overwhelmed by numbers on Sunday afternoon. But the friendly and efficient staff simply called our room, for us to come down after the crowds thinned out.

Breakfast had great variety of food and well run. 
Early dinner in the Brasserie great for kids, but a little pricey for what the adults got. This was in fact the only let down of the 3 days we spent here.

We'll be back!",4,2013,06,07
238,Hotel Accommodation & Staff,"I was completely amazed with the décor of this Hotel.  Modern, comfortable, practical and roomy.  Our bedroom was a good size and immaculately kept.   The real highlight for my partner and myself was the Staff.  Never have I experienced such a pleasant and professional group of people.   There was nothing they would do for you and was backed up with a smile.   I felt the Staff made one feel special and they were delighted that you choose their Hotel.   Food was excellent, be it breakfast, restaurant menu or bar menu.  We were attending a wedding reception and the service, food and attention to detail by Druid Glen staff was unbelievable.   Anybody looking for a Hotel for a wedding - this is your place.    Alex Davidson & Geraldine Maloney.",5,2013,06,06
238,one of the best places in Ireland to stay,"From the moment we arrived the service was excellent, the staff are very professional, polite and a pleasant change to my weeks experiance in ireland, its a rare commodity to find.
Rooms a good size, large flat screen TV ! the beds and pillows were absolutely amazing, home from home,  care has been taken into ensuring that the bed has the highest quality of linen along with  feather duvets/pillows.
The pool facilities were also excellent. The downside, approx 30 kms from Dublin! Which may be a little too far if you don’t have a car? The food in the restaurant isn’t great, just good. For me breakfast was also a letdown, the cold and fruit section was excellent but the hot section full Irish was not that great the sausages were dry and tasteless, bacon looked inimic and tasted of nothing.... 
The perfect location is for people who want to get out of town and  relax with maybe some  golf.
however for me the real wow factor is the hotel staff, especially reception, amazing after travelling and visiting 6 hotels in Ireland, finally a hotel that has trained, tentative and smiling people...",5,2013,06,04
238,Really good service from great staff,"Just back from 2 night stay. Group played golf and stayed over. Overall we were looked after very well by excellent staff. Could not fault the place just lovely.
Plan to go back again feels like a very family friendly hotel.",5,2013,06,02
238,Family Gathering for birthday party.,"We were fortunate enough to have the excuse of a birthday party to make a week-end of it in Druids Glen 17th 19th May. Great location - only 40 mins from where we live.  Our party ranged from 6 yrs old to 80 - and we all had a great time.  Our rooms were located just 2 x mins from the main reception and very convenient.  The rooms are spacious, bright and comfortable.  Facilities are excellent.

Star of the show was Jo.  I spoke to Jo before arriving at the hotel - and she couldn't have been more helpful.  Nothing was too much trouble.  When we arrived for the birthday dinner - she took care of our 6 x year old - brought him a DVD player and toy story 3 - which went down a treat - ensured he was served first and remembered his name - he thought she was super! 

Our fabulous french water - IOIC - whose name I have spelt incorrectly - was tremendous. He attended to every detail - helped us with our wine, spoiled my mother rotten, and brought extra sides for the kiddies.  He even arranged tomatoe sauce for the low brow 15 year old.    

We were in the swimming pool - 4 x times in the 3 days - and it is one of the best hotel pools we have been in. Great size - lovely water - and nice facilities too - very well maintained.

We had a small birthday party on the saturday night and",5,2013,05,20
238,Fabulous Family Retreat,"This is a fabulous child friendly hotel so you get the benefits of a 5 star hotel and the little people are happy too!! 
Amazing staff, good food, bikes, kiddies play room and organised activities. great pool and spa.
If you want a family break with style and comfort this is the place to stay!!!",5,2013,05,20
238,Fantastic family friendly hotel,"Stayed at beginning of May - first time travelling with 2 young children so a bit apprehensive.  Hotel could not have been any more helpful - facilities for children are excellent (pool, park, indoor playroom) and we were made to feel very welcome.  Very lucky to receive room upgrade to a suite which meant we could sit in separate living room while children were asleep in the evening and relax.  Breakfast was splendid and the pancake station was definitely a highlight with my 3 year old.  Found the brasserie a little too stuffy for the children so ate in the bar on subsequent nights and really enjoyed the atmosphere.  Will definitely return with the family already booked to go back this weekend for girly weekend.",5,2013,05,20
238,"Great place, brilliant staff, lovely rooms but slightly lose it on the detail","A really nice place with friendly and efficient staff, but slightly lose a star on the detail. For somewhere that bills itself as a 5 star, it's not got that 5 star quality but it is a good 4 star. The best parts of the resort are the staff and the food, for sure - they are almost all really really nice and friendly and have a lovely attitude. 

However, there were one or two points where the shine was taken off and it really didn't need to be - e.g., you need to have a hat for the swimming pool, which they don't tell you about beforehand but when you get to the pool, you have to pay €3 to buy one. In a 5 star hotel, you shouldn't have to put your hand in your pocket between booking and leaving, so really they should just loan them or tell you about it beforehand. When we brought down the lovely bottle of prosecco that they gave as a gift for a birthday to the restaurant, we were told we would have to pay €15 corkage or bring it back to the bedroom. Now really, is it worth €15 to tell us we can't have this lovely gesture between us but that we have to drink it between 5 people in a bedroom upstairs out of glasses from the bathroom? A 5 star hotel doesn't tell you that... a 5 star hotel makes you feel like you are welcome and your enjoyment is paramount. Also, to be told off for taking photos of each other in the swimming pool even though there were no signs prohibiting it and then told it's illegal even though I can find no sign of a law about this - not 5 star quality and not welcoming and lovely.

On the plus side, the rooms were lovely and have lots of space, especially the large bathrooms with separate bath and shower, fluffy bath robes and slippers and lots of towels. The beds were small (standard double, not queen) but lovely fluffy pillows and thick duvet. Do make sure you lock the door from the inside as one of our group had a member of staff walk in after only one knock while she was getting out of the shower. The view from rooms at the front is beautiful - rolling hills and gorgeous plants in the gardens - and the view from other rooms is of the lovely and well-kept central garden. In the morning, there was a printed weather report and suggestions for things to do that day put under the door, which is a really nice touch.

The health centre itself is nice - 1 sauna, 2 steam rooms, a plunge pool, jacuzzi and 18m swimming pool. The view from the spa is lovely as it's on a raised level so you see out over the trees. Not many loungers around the pool and not much space to lounge so get there early and grab one of the 4 or 5 loungers while you can.

One of our group went for a spa treatment and really loved it. It sounded like that was very well done and she felt really pampered.

For the price and the advertised 5 star quality, I wouldn't recommend it but for a nice 4 star experience with mostly lovely staff, it's great. I probably won't go back, although I wouldn't mind if someone else wanted to really go there as it's not that bad, but there are definitely better places to go for that price.",4,2013,05,20
238,Ideal for familes,"From check in to check out the team in Druids Glen put you first. The food is exquisite. The staff in  the restaurant or bar are attentive yet not intrusive. The pool is a favourite with the kids and it had a life guard on duty most times. I'd recommend going to Powerscourt, Ennishkerry and for lunch in Greystones. We keep coming back.",5,2013,05,20
238,"Amazing place , loved both courses , if only the sun was to shine everyday !!","Great resort , was down as part of a group of 40 men on a 2 day golf outing and could not have been more impressed !! the hotel facilites were first class including the gym , swimming pool and the service was excellent. have not one negative thing to say about the resort , just wish my golf was a bit better :-)",5,2013,05,12
238,great place,"great hotel , spacious rooms, good food, friendly staff, great golf courses and practice areas, great spa. stayed here numerous times the last being last weekend , we were given upgrade to suite on 3rd floor overlooking golf course and wicklow mountains. restaurant and bar food very good although wee bit pricey. only small gripe was that i wasnt offered the residents discount on a purchase in the pro shop at the heath course, i did however get discount in the glen pro shop. we will be back to stay when the room refurbishments are complete.",5,2013,05,10
238,The weather topped it all.,"My wife and i got a well deserved break from the kids thanks to the grandparents. We arrived about Mid-day ane our room was ready.. Went to the room which was very spacious and cosy.. We put away our stuff and went back down to the bar for lunch..
It was a beautiful sunny day of 18c.. We had our food which was very nice and well priced..After our lunch we walked around the Golf course and hotel grounds. It was lovely.. Being a sunny day we went back to the bar to cool down on the deck..we were very well looked after by the bar staff. The scenery was beautiful.. 
Later in the evening we dined in the restaurant where we were served a beautiful meal by very friendly staff..
Breakfast next morning was a buffet breakfast and eveything we wanted was there including fresh made omellettes and crepes..
we had a wonderful day in the Druids Glen. I'm just sorry i did not have my golf clubs and the kids.. Looking forward to going back in June 13.",5,2013,05,10
238,Druids Glen - Weaves its Magic,"Now here is a resort to take your breath away!  Grounds and parking - very impressive.  Reception area (and staff) very warm and friendly. I was there for a wedding and found the function rooms, service & food - top drawer.  Nothing was too much trouble for the very attentive staff which would prompt one to jump at the chance to visit there again!",5,2013,05,09
238,druids glen spa,"The Druids Glen Spa, is amazing. All that a Spa should be
, with wonderful staff, so friendly,relaxing,  truly calming. Great monthly offers, check them out.  I myself suffer from ezama, which i find embarsing, and at some time quite upsetting, the staff here were great made me feel brill, thank you so much, it means so much to people, with skin complaints. 
Not to feel different...Will be back, asap.
I have stayed in the hotel before, and found it great, staff are brill...Beds are great, room was 5*...We were very well looked after...Do try the Spa......thank you Josephine",5,2013,05,07
238,Family get together,"Annual family get together, with all the children and grand children. Good food, superb environment, staff very attentive. Rooms spacious and comfortable. Golf courses fair but challenging and the spa was well used. Certainly recommended and great value for a family holiday weekend",5,2013,05,07
238,Relaxing,"What can I say, there was a group of us staying and nothing was a problem! 
Restaurant staff were brilliant and hats off the the chefs
We had a twin room, which was large and spacious. 
Didn't use the spa or leisure facilities

238,Lovely weekend,Just want to say a big thank you to all the staff for a great weekend they were all very friendly and professional.The hotel has started refurbishment of the rooms but it did not take from our weekend the rooms are very comfortable and spacious. We ate in the bar the first night and the restaurant on the second night the food was excellent had 2 treatments in the spa had booked 1 and then found when we arrived a special of 50% off on facials one of the best I have ever had.really enjoyed our weekend and will be back.,4,2013,05,06
238,Pleasant stay,"Nice hotel in beautiful surroundings. Food was substandard and rather overpriced. The interior of the decor is dated, and the hotel needs definitely needs a makeover. For this reason, it should not be a five star hotel.",4,2013,05,05
238,Superb staff & surroundings,"Top notch food in Druids Brasserie, great setting for golf & walking, very friendly staff in the restaurant, at reception and in the spa and of course Glenroe is down the road - what else could you ask for?",5,2013,05,03
238,Family stay,"Stayed here in October 2012 with Kids. Rooms very spacious. Hotel staff excelled ( especially with the kids) and were very accommodating. Restaurant food was mostly locally sourced and very well prepared and presented. Again, the restaurant staff were very good with the kids which helps a great deal. The only disappointment was the pool which was off-limits at certain times as its shared with the spa!! In a country where the weather is a major player in what you can do (comfortably!) it's important that the pool is always accessible to guests.
Would certainly recommend and one day we'll be back.",5,2013,05,03
238,Overnight stay,"Stayed over night. Lovely hotel great location and easy acess to the main motorways ,less than an hour from dublin and close to some of the best places to see in ireland. Had food in the bar which was second to none but a bit costly .room was excently great view over looking the golf course of druids glen .breakfast was great and staff were nice. dont know if it deserves a five star but if you were a golfer you would think it did ........well done",4,2013,05,01
238,Has it all...,"Definitely worth a visit. I have to travel to this area quite a lot, sometimes with kids and it has pretty much everything you could hope for... Good location, great scenery, swimming pool, good breakfasts, decent bar, large comfortable bedrooms, brilliant with the kids, decent room service and very friendly staff....all at a price that is reasonable.
That isn't to say that it's all perfect. The beds are a bit hard for my taste - but that seems to be a hotel trend, the parking is not quite close enough to the entrance for carrying bags or when it rains - so a valet service to fetch and park your car would be a good touch. Plus I would personally appreciate some English or European newspapers. But all this would be very much grumbling with perhaps a hint for the hotel. Because, in the end, it has to get the full five stars as I couldn't imagine staying anywhere else when I'm in the area!",5,2013,04,30
238,Great hotel,"Top class customer service from reception, bar staff, restaurant staff and pro-shop. Food is excellent. Room spacious and comfortable. Worth dining in as the food is good. Golf is superb but perhaps a bit too challenging on the Heath course in windy weather - bring plenty of balls!! Was my second visit and I will come again.",5,2013,04,27
238,Family Overnight Stay,"We availed of a special offer to stay here in March.  The booking process was easy, and the staff lovely to speak to on the phone.  We checked in, the decor at reception is lovely, and booked dinner in the restaurant.  The rooms were surprisingly basic for a 5 star hotel.  But there were beds, and a nice view, so we were happy.  
The dinner was lovely, the waiting staff very accommodating as my daughter wanted something not on the menu, and he said it would be no problem- only garlic butter on her steak- but you never know!
We did order a DVD player for the kids, but it never arrived.  
The pool was great fun, lots of families, and they were giving lessons at the same time, so not really a romantic spa, but as we were there with the family it was alright.
The breakfast however was the crowning glory.  The kids will be taking about the pancake/ omelette station for decades to come.  We had to go for a major walk afterwards!!",4,2013,04,25
238,"Excellent food, lovely place and great for Weddings","My last trip to Druids Glen was on Easter Sunday. We had a very bad experience in the Summerhill House Hotel so decided to go to the reliable Druids Glen for lunch. We all had a lovely meal while enjoying the great atmosphere in the place. This is a great place for a bite to eat, night or weekend away and is also a great location for weddings. We attended a wedding last October and had a great day. The food was excellent and the staff so friendly. I would highly recommend Druids Glen to anyone visiting the area.",5,2013,04,23
238,Love the Druids glen and keep going back,"Just back from a wonderful 2 night stay with 3 others at the Druids Glen. My third visit and looking forward to returning again. Wonderful staff, all very friendly and welcoming. First time using the spa and would highly recommend it. A special thank you to Roisin. Breakfast was fantastic. Really liked the daily weather report with tips on what to see and do in the area which appeared under the door each morning. We ate in the bar on both evenings and the food and service was first class. Thanks to all for a wonderful mini break. We will return.",5,2013,04,20
238,"Great time, we went back a week later!","Stayed at Druids Glen two nights in a suite with our 5 month old daughter. The suite was lovely! The staff are so friendly and accomodating! In particular Adrienne at reception and Brian in the bar!
Breakfast was really good and the hotel is really family friendy. We loved it so much we went back for a night the following week!!!!
Cant wait to return!!",5,2013,04,19
238,Truly outstanding - great value for money....,"I had not been to the Druid's Glen Resort for a number of years and was interested to see how things may have changed since Marriott ended their relationship with this property.... I need not have worried... Myself and a friend stayed for one night in an Executive Corner Suite with Balcony in late March 2013. We were on a dinner-inclusive package, booked via a discounted rate on-line, which was an absolute steal given the wonderful experience we had. I can honestly say that it was incredible value for money. 
Druid's Glen really is the ultimate Resort hotel, in the American sense of the word. You really have no need to leave the complex during your entire stay, as literally everything you could possibly want is provided. There are a number of dining options, great bars and lobby spaces, fantastic golfing, a spa, pool, walking trails and even a boutique in the lobby. 
The rooms are really fantastic and as an extra treat I would suggest that you upgrade to a suite, you will not be disappointed. The bedding, furniture and bathrooms are absolutely luxurious. If you are a smoker, having a private balcony is essential, as the hotel is an entirely non-smoking property. 
The food and wines at Druid's Brasserie were exquisite, and although our dinner reservation was very late at night, there was still a great atmosphere in the beautiful restaurant. An added bonus is that dinner-inclusive guests may order from the extended a-la-carte menu, rather than being restricted to a smaller set menu, which is the often the case. This really represents fantastic service. 
The numerous staff we encountered were friendly, knowledgeable, professional and very well presented. The room service was flawless, with the enormous and delicious breakfast selection served privately in our suite being possibly the best hotel breakfast I have ever sampled. 
Finally, although I would say that the spa and pool are quite average for a hotel of this class, what I think really makes Druids Glen a very special place is that although it is a luxury hotel with seemingly no expense spared, the luxury here is unassuming, accessible, down to earth and family-friendly, rather than stuffy, arrogant and pretentious like so many of Ireland's other high-end hotels. 
We had a fabulous stay at Druids Glen and I genuinely cannot recommend this place highly enough. I recently read that the hotel has experienced a 38% rise in occupancy year-on-year and I can easily see why.... they do a really excellent job here and I cannot wait to get back.",5,2013,04,14
238,Europes Augusta!,"This was our third time at Druids Glen, which probably says it all?
The staff were very welcoming, the rooms comfortable and the breakfasts excellent. The golf course is 10 star!!! fantastic views and set up so even a high handicap player can come away with a few pars, but try too hard and you're in trouble!!!! We will be back.",5,2013,04,14
238,Perfect escape,"Stayed during mid term on the 2 adults and 2 kids package and I have to say it was just so relaxing.   Haven't stayed there since it changed from Marriott, but the service and value for money was just excellent.    Spent time in the Spa which was just wondering.   Highly recommend this hotel for a nice relaxing night away.  Compliments to the Mangement and all the staff in the hotel, I could not find one fault with my stay.  Really enjoyed it and I'll definately will be coming back.",5,2013,04,13
238,Nice family break,"Stayed for 2 nights during Halloween break. Two interconnecting rooms - one for the 4 kids and one for mum and dad.

Great pool - kids loved it. Driving range was a hit with the boys - borrowed clubs and paid €5 for a bucket of balls - kept them and dad busy for a few hours. Meanwhile the girls took a spin to avoca and enjoyed an hour or two there.

Small playgroind which was good for the younger kids. Kids room with games and movies - kids made pals and met up there while we relaxes nearby in the large co day foyer with a nice bevvie.

Highly recommend.",5,2013,04,12
238,5* experience,Stayed 2 nights. Great staff. Good food. Better value mid week. Half hour from Dublin lovely gardens. Golfers paradise. Pool etc ok. Great place to get away from it all and unwind. Close to Greystones and beaches not too far away.,4,2013,04,11
238,Great hotel for golfers,"An excellent hotel with very pleasant and helpful staff. This must be a golfers paradise.A warm welcome at reception was great. Our room of high standard and very clean as was the bathroom.Dinner in the dining room was very good and the staff were great, I was unhappy with the dress code allowed in the dining room ,I thinks jeans should be kept to the bar area. The leisure centre was very good, perhaps too much time is given to children in the pool area.",4,2013,04,11
238,Family focussed and wonderful staff,"We had a lovely Easter break there with our two small boys ( 6 and 3). Outdoor playground and playroom for the kids was great as was the treasure hunt and treasure hunt with eggs for the kids on Easter morning. We particularly enjoyed the chocolate fountain with marshmallows and fruit .. yummm

The staff went above and beyond the call of duty to return a much loved cuddly toy ""Buttons"" to our boys.. we're very grateful",5,2013,04,11
238,Relaxing Easter Break,"This is a fabulous hotel and definitely going onto my top ten list, maybe even the top five.  The room was lovely, spacious and comfortable, the lobby elegant and welcoming.  The breakfast was excellent- one of best I have had anywhere - and the bar food of a very reasonable standard.  The only downside was that my restaurant meal was a bit disappointing.  The staff were really friendly in a geninue way.  We came to relax and with nine holes of golf, enjoyment of the pool and steam rooms, and a great walk around the grounds, plus the food and wine, we certainly did relax .  The hotel was in easy reach of both Glendalough and Powerscourt - both worth visiting.  One of the best points for me was the complimentary coffee and pastries served up to 11am.  As I am an early riser and my husband likes to lie in, this work great for us both.  All in all a great hotel and a great weekend break.",5,2013,04,10
238,Amazing Staff,"I hope the management at Druid's Glen appreciate just how brillant their staff are. Each and everyone of them was highly professional, friendly, warm and dare I say it .... looked happy to be working! 

Our stay was short, just one night, but we really chilled out and enjoyed the fab spa, followed by a lovely walk around the grounds. The fact that the resort is not within walking distance of Newtown, means that you really have no choice but to relax and enjoy your stay!

The room was bright and spacious, and bed super comfortable. If I had one complaint, it was that the shower was not the hottest.

Can't wait to return.",5,2013,04,10
238,Great family Easter stay,"Stayed again over Easter weekend (about 4th year running) with young kids.  Adjoining rooms, loads of space and service still great even with how busy it was.  Had room service and breakfast in bed.  On time and as good as in the restaurant. The egg hunt, balloons, face painting, play room, easter bunny all turned up as expected.   Staff also make a real effort to remember returning guests.  Food good for all meals however differing menus for different times of day a bit odd for this level of hotel, kids eat anything at any time, but when asked they were happy to accommodate us.  New play room setup this year not as good as previous but can understand why it was changed. Outside play ground a great addition. Great weekend. ",4,2013,04,09
238,Great wedding venue,"We attended a wedding there in April. The hotel setting is wonderful, set in the rolling hills of Wicklow with lovely views from all over the hotel. The first impression at check-in was great, staff competent and friendly. This was a hallmark throughout our short stay. Every staff member we encountered  really impressed us with their attitude and helpfulness. it doesn't happen by accident! Our room on the 3rd floor was delightful. Lovely big king sized bed with lots of soft pillows!
The wedding meal was sumptuous, served piping hot and at a perfect pace. Breakfast the following morning was equally delicious. The hotel was quite full with lots of families with kids. The staff seemed to cope effortlessly. We would definitely recommend this hotel for a weekend break or as a wedding venue.",5,2013,04,09
238,"Family friendly hotel, very enjoyable break.","Spent the Easter weekend at Druids Glen Hotel and must say it was very enjoyable. We travelled with our children (8 & 5) and shared a large room with two double beds. Check-in was quick and friendly. The children were handed colouring packs. The room was reasonably spacious and comfortable. The hotel was packed with families and they appear to be catering to this market. The food in the bar was nice and we had two dinners with our package. The dinners were nice but nothing to write home about. There was a buffet arrangement for the kids that was novel and worked well. I really enjoyed the breakfast and there was plenty of choice. The pool area is nice and the hotel are very strict in relation to how many are in the pool at any given time, a good policy but plan ahead for this. The staff, without exception, were courteous and friendly and are a huge asset to the resort. Some of the decor was slightly dated or worn. All in all a very enjoyable break but one for the family as opposed to a quiet romantic weekend away. My only criticism was the drinks were quiet expensive but considering we only had one or two in the evening it was fine.",4,2013,04,08
238,Quiet midweek break,"My husband and I stayed here for one night. This was our 3rd visit. THe hotel is consistently good. It is now possible to walk around the golf course which was needed as there is very little else to do outside when you stay in this hotel as it is well away from any other shops or restaurants. Breakfast was superb. Our room was huge, including the bathroom, which had a separate shower and bath. I had poached eggs although they were not listed on the menu. Pool and changing areas are lovely and very clean with view of the mountains. The only negative was one of the treatments I had. I was a little late to be fair, for a massage that I had booked. It was truly, truly awful. I endured it by biting my lip. Thank goodness I was late! I'd like to balance that by saying the other treatment I had with a different therapist, a face treatment, was wonderful. Great hotel, we will go back.",4,2013,04,08
238,lovely break,"Stayed here with 2 kids and other friends. Really well set out for families with a very convenient swimming pool which you can go from your room in dressing gown - bliss ! Really friendly staff in all areas - always felt that nothing was any trouble. Food was really lovely - though found the restaurant just a tad overpriced (kids meals okay) though was very tasty. Has a kids activity room which for my 5 and 6 year old was perfect and a seating area for adults or kids to just sit and relax ! ONLY 2  minor complaints - i would have liked the gas fire to have been really glowing (only one side worked) - small complaint but then i'm used to a big fire most nights at home! At breakfast the guy making eggs, omelettes and pancakes always had a queue which held up those just looking for a simple fried egg with their breakfast ! should just have had a constant dish full of eggs so that you weren't waiting for such a long time holding the rest of your cooked breakfast !! all in all a really lovely time was had by all and we will be back in june or july. Usually after a few nights i am ready to go home but really wanted to stay another few days here !",5,2013,04,05
238,A little bit of paradise,"This is simply a wonderful resort. We were checked in efficiently by the lovely Duncan and within minutes were in a beautiful suite with fabulous views over the Wicklow hills. The bed was really comfortable and the linens etc of good quality.Food is good but dinner was marred on the first night by a family at the next table who spent their time on their mobile phones and whose son even had his laptop on the table. This is a 5 star hotel so a little bit of decorum wouldn't have gone amiss! 
Spa treatments are excellent and in general all the staff were wonderful. Would we return? Most definately.",5,2013,04,03
238,Easter at Druids Glen,"Another brilliant stay at Druids Glen. Spa is so relaxing. We had lovely treatments and used the pool twice a day. We rented bikes, walked on the nearby beach and chilled in the evening with a nice glass of wine and easter eggs. Staff really helpful. Nice food in the bar and good kids menu. Plenty for kids to do. Excellent.",5,2013,04,03
238,Good Easter Weekend Break,"I was treated to a night in Druids Glen by my girlfriend over the Easter weekend. All in all I had a good if not a little mixed of a stay.

The Good: The Hotel staff were very friendly. In particular our waiter and the restaurant manager really helped us enjoy our dinner. The food was very good, both breakfast and dinner were excellent value and very very tasty. THe area surrounding the hotel has stunning scenery. My girlfriend really enjoyed the spa experience and would highly recommend a facial.

The not so bad but not so good: The Hotel is family friendly and it was Easter weekend so it may have been to be expected but the were a lot of young kids running around the hotel. As a result the day at the pool and sauna etc was a bit too hectic for my liking and not as relaxing as I would have liked and lunch time in the bar was very loud. The pool area and sauna were not a impressive as I was expecting from a 5 star hotel. The rooms were nice and very spacious but could use a bit of modernisation (we have been told by the friendly restaurant manager that this is about to begin). The shower was very disappointing with poor water pressure.

Overall was a good weekend but maybe not the 5* relaxing weekend I was expecting. I would suggest a better weekend for golfers and families than a romantic weekend away.",3,2013,04,02
238,Weekend golf break with mad Italians,"3 stars seems a bit harsh, probably good but certainly not very good.. Facilities looked great, but not all lived up to expectations. Shower looked great but was average, plunge pool not working in spa.....little things but annoying. Meal on last night however really let you down...3.5 hours for a simple 3 course dinner of a restricted menu really let you down. Could see the waiter was really struggling from the start, but no management intervention to get him any help until way to late in the meal.
Know you guys have to control your costs in the current climate, but this felt as if you were really degrading customer service.
With all the above said, real notable exception was the staff on reception, exceptionally polite friendly and couldn't do enough to help",3,2013,04,01
238,Great Break away.,"Stayed here for one night in March, had a fantastic time, lovely resort, room was a suite which was really really nice and very spacious, good food, very relaxing...staff are really excellent. Will deffo be back soon.",5,2013,03,30
238,Excellent Stay - will return,"Stayed in Druids Glen resort with my girlfriend in March 2013. It was a fantastic experience from the moment we arrived. The staff at reception were wonderfully helpful as well as all the staff we met during our stay. We stayed in an executive suite and it was really nice. We ate in the restaurant, really good food and wine. The health was very relaxing and we took a lovely walk around the grounds, maybe we should have taken the free bicycles. In all we had a really relaxing time and will return again. Thanks Druids Glen.",5,2013,03,29
238,Great value - fab location,Fantastic breakfast! Had a lovely girls weekend in this hotel. Food was top quality and our stay was outstanding value! Only issue was that we couldn't use the pool as it was too busy and full of kids. Think next time we go back it will be mid week!,4,2013,03,24
238,A shining example of a top quality hotel,"Been here a number of times and it is almost like a home away from home. The food in the main restaurant is excellent, superb selection of wines on offer also. Service is very good and efficient, staff willing to offer suggestions to compliment food tastes which is always a plus. The bar is perfect, especially the conservatory out the back which is a great place to chill, relax and enjoy each other's company. The food in the bar is quite pricey however. Breakfast in the morning, while buffet, is very enjoyable and staff are helpful in arranging for special requests if required.

Rooms are very spacious and comfortable. The spa is excellent, had a couple of massage treatments when visiting this time and they were top drawer. Played a round of golf on my last visit too while my wife spent time in the spa, the main Druids Glen golf course is one of the best in the country. Stunning and a great challenge. But you don't need a tripadvisor review to tell you that.

Staff were very friendly from the front-desk, to bell hop, bar and restaurant staff to general manager Richard. All in all, they make you feel very welcome and as I said previously at a home away from home",5,2013,03,23
238,"Once again, a lovely stay in this beautiful hotel.","Myself and my husband recently had the good fortune to return to Druids Glen for an overnight stay. From the moment we entered the hotel until we left I have to say that once again both the staff and management went out of their way to make our stay so enjoyable.

I checked in early in the day and treated myself to a full body massage in the wonderful Spa. I was looked after by a lovely girl called Kate. As usual the treatment was great and I was so relaxed after it. Anybody thinking of staying in Druids Glen should really check out the Spa and book a treatment. I think over the years I have had every treatment on offer and every one of them has been wonderful. Naturally, the lovely Spa staff play a huge part in this.

We were very fortunate to stay in the Presidential suite this time. What an experience! It is absolutely gorgeous and the bathroom is incredible with lovely underfloor heating. There is a beautiful fireplace in the middle of the suite and it is positioned in such a way so as to lend heat to both the bedroom and sitting room simultaneously.
There is a sumptuous suite of furniture that one simply sinks into and the views from the windows are breathtaking. I also liked the decor which is tranquil and relaxing. The Presidential suite is akin to an apartment and management have not overlooked anything in making this suite luxurious. We ordered breakfast to our suite and it arrived precisely at the required time and was piping hot. My husband returned from a round of golf just as breakfast arrived and it was so lovely to relax with the Sunday papers and listen to the birds singing outside the window. Bliss!

We had dinner in the restaurant and both the service and the food were outstanding. The complete dining experience was heaven from begining to end. I have to say that all of the staff in Druids Glen are welcoming, courteous, friendly and a credit to their employer. We have stayed in hotels all over Europe and none of the staff in these hotels come anywhere near to the good manners and sheer likeability of Druids Glen staff.

One feature I especially liked when coming up to the entrance of the hotel are the beautiful lights in the trees. They are stunning and are like a beacon welcoming all. They really add to the beauty of the whole place. We only stayed one night...unfortunalely...but, we felt so rested and relaxed when leaving it was like we had been on holiday!
We will be back again and again! Thankyou so much Druids Glen and looking forward to our next break away with you. Bernie and John Boylan.",5,2013,03,22
238,Great break.,"This was a most enjoyable break, the weather was good and the scenery and service were
par excellance. The food was supberb especially the breakfast. This is a fabulous base with
great facilities and a wonderful hinterland to explore.",4,2013,03,17
238,Really lovely,"Fantastic location, but journey once you come off the M11 is a bit windy but not hotels fault! 

Reception was faultless but had a problem with key cards a few times. Meal was fantastic as was the service!

Look forward to returning to explore more of the grounds and Spa! ",4,2013,03,15
238,"5 star service,","5 star service,the staff were exceptional,could not do enough for us,so friendly an always smiling,anytime came across member of staff they always acknowledged you with a smile an a hello,great to have this service now adays,the bar food was lovelly but again what stood out was the staff,our waiter was great his name is sunny an again just went that extra mile,must not forget our check in,so friendly nothing a hassle very welcoming,our only downside was the room,average nothing exciting,decor bit dated,breakfast was lovelly staff very friendly but we were seated on top of each other tables very close together,but guess this is due to been a busy hotel,but saying that,myself an my husband will be back to sample the 5star service!!",5,2013,03,15
238,Amazing break away in this stunning hotel,"Myself and my mother stayed here in early March for a 1 night Spa Package and we can not recommend this hotel enough!
We had amazing Spa treatments, the staff were friendly and made us feel really relaxed.
The bedroom was perfect, we stayed down the very end of the hotel and it was perfect for our relaxing retreat, we didn't hear a sound except for the birds chirping in the morning :)
The views were stunning and we enjoyed a fabulous walk around the grounds after breakfast.
We decided to eat in the bar that night because after our afternoon in the Spa we just wanted to eat good food in a comfortable environment and the bar staff even brought our desserts and coffees up to our room as we were stuffed and they could tell we were starting to fall asleep!!
This really was the perfect nights treat for myself and my mother as we never spoil ourselves :)
Every staff member we dealt with was professional, polite and made us feel very welcome, we will definitely be back.",5,2013,03,14
238,5 Star Family Friendly Resort.,"We stayed at Druids Glen with our 15 month old for 3x nights on a super B&B internet deal as a Birthday treat by my wife. The Hotel was well sign posted from the main routes and on arrival the receptionist was very friendly, explaining all we needed to know, getting help with bags and giving us a kids colouring pack for the little one. The reception area is large, airy and has a lovely circular staircase faced with nice stonework which seems to work well with the modern hotel design. A nice feature fireplace takes centre stage of the reception.  Complimentary Tea /Coffee and pastries are available beside the desk along with daily papers/tourist information. 
The room was huge with plenty of wardrobe space and a large comfortable bed. We had both a shower and seperate bath in the large bathroom. A nice 42 inch TV on the wall and two bottles of complimentary water each morning.
The spa was booked out but did seem nice and the staff friendly. The swimming pool was great, in fact like a warm bath. Our wee boy loved it, no cold water here. The pool has a few hours each morning and evening dedicated to allowing children. There are the usual hot tub, sauna steam room and a well equiped gym. 
Break fast was very good with an excellent range of fresh breads, scones, bagels etc along with the usual hot buffet including omlettes and pancakes cooked to order.  On quite days the hot food is all cooked as you order.
We had a meal in the bar which was tasty, if perhaps a little expensive. Again we found the staff very patient with children and friendly at all times. 
Other facilities included an indoor kids room (this was a bit tired and dirty looking) an outdoor play area which looked fine and not to forget the two on site Golf courses. I played the Druids Glen course. From the moment I arrived at the clubhouse and was greeted by the very pleasant Eamon I knew that it was all good. The course is stunning and in great condition and the scenery around the Glen( back of the Hotel) is truly stunning.
The only minus points we would give this resort is that it could be kept cleaner, especially carpet around doorways and glass surfaces being grubby. The carpet in our room was not even that well fitted with spaces around the wall. Biscuits would have been nice in the room as well. However these are the only faults if being fussy and we would certainly return and highly recommend this resort to others.",5,2013,03,12
238,Fabulous family friendly hotel,"Had a fantastic stay with our daughter, along with other family members and their children.
Hotel offers a playground, playroom and babyroom for those with children...and happy children make happy parents!!  And as the Manager pointed out, this also makes the stay more enjoyable for those guests without children as children are then occupied and stimulated and not running around a hotel aimlessly..!!
The Manager has this spot on.  Customer service is excellent from the top down, and other places could really learn from Druid's Glen.  There was a mistake made with the booking of our babysitter, which left us in a tricky situation.  However, the staff quickly and efficiently rectified this, offered us a complimentary drink and adjusted our restaurant reservations....Sorted!  
The food in the main restaurant was absolutely superb. 
We have no complaints about Druid's Glen and we are looking forward to returning when Baby number 2 arrives as I know we will be warmly welcomed (rare indeed in 5 star Ireland!!).",5,2013,03,10
238,4 star versus 5,"Nice rooms, bar. Bathrooms big but poor shower (really a step in the bath job with poor power) Towels old, need new ones. Catering staff all non Irish and not friendliest. The whole place a bit impersonal and small things mean only 4star",4,2013,03,10
238,"Nice hotel, good 4*","Stayed here for 2 nights B&B in Jan 13. Nice hotel but wouldn't consider it a 5 star, maybe a good 4 star. The attention to detail was lost and we found the staff to be nice & pleasant, but didnt appear at all relaxed. 
We ate in the bar on arrival, it was only ok, very overpriced for what you get and the bar has little or no atmosephere.
It was a nice hotel, I was just expecting something wonderful from a 5* resort.
Swimming pool was lovely though and staff there were very nice. Breakfast was fantastic, every kind of food option was available.",3,2013,03,06
238,Excellent!!!!!!,Loved my time here!!! Was here a few years back but only getting around to writing a review now! My sister held her wedding reception here and everything was perfect! I would definitely recommend it and would come back again for a visit!,5,2013,03,06
238,Great for families,A great hotel for families. We had an interconnecting room for us and kids which worked out well. Kids loved the pool even though there isn't an actual kids area. They also enjoyed the play room and play ground. Children eat free in the restaurant when you fine which is a nice touch. Staff were very friendly send helpful. ,5,2013,03,05
238,Good hotel at reasonable rates,"The hotel is situated about 40 minutes from Dublin airport and is quite easy to find. The hotel is marketed as a 5 star resort, however I would say that it is more 4 star – although prices are very reasonable so it does balance out. 

The bedrooms and foyers are a bit dated, but perfectly fine. It is a very family friendly hotel with a kids play area and kitchenette on one of the floors which is equipped with bottle warmers etc (we had a  couple with a child travelling with us). 

There are two golf courses – both very good and I would recommend both courses. The hotel has a spa, but do book way ahead, I couldn’t get an appointment even though I had tried to book 4 days before arriving. The hotel also has a gym, pool, sauna etc

We couldn’t find anywhere to have dinner near the hotel, and ended up having dinner at the hotel on both evenings. Casual dinner at the bar was perfectly fine and dinner in the Brassier was ok too. 

I think that for the rates charged, the hotel meets ones needs and I would recommend this hotel.",4,2013,02,25
238,2nd stay and it was even better!,We stayed here last April and loved it. But we stayed here last weekend with my parents and family for my parents 40th wedding anniversary and it was even better! The staff are amazing. All very natural and not put on. Joseph our waiter from Saturday night in the restaurant was top class. Great food as well. Dinner on both night was excellent. Rooms are lovely and spacious. The women on our party has a great facial and massage and really enjoyed it. Overall highly recommended.,5,2013,02,25
238,Wow !!! Wonderful experience from start to end.,"Check in was quick and easy even though a bridal party arrived at the same time . But that didn't phase the reservation staff and we were promptly checked in and giving all the information on the hotel and the facilities . We had a lovely bright room on the second floor . Bed was very comfy with lots of pillows. Plenty of space in the room. We had dinner in the Brassier restaurant . There were a number of large groups celebrating Birthday etc. with young children in the front part of the restaurant . We were seated in an intimate area away from all the group by the windows which was lovely and relaxing. The food was gorgeous and the service was excellent. The staff in all areas of the hotel were very friendly and made us feel so welcome . The singer is the bar had a lovely voice and great selection of songs were sung . Breakfast the next morning was impressive with something for every one . The selection of different foods was lovely with a chef making fresh pancakes. There were family rooms on the corridor where bottle warning or snack could be made for younger children. Very family friendly hotel . I loved every minute of my stay .
I would really recommend  this hotel for families and for couples.",5,2013,02,24
238,All I can say is WOW!,"First day of seven days, and I am truly impressed.  Not for those who skimp on the euros, but well worth the price.  We arrived at about 6 a.m. and the Ritz, checked us in promptly.   Our suite has two bathrooms and touch pads that power everything in the rooms, from lights, heat, and curtains.  It truly feels as though you're in your own private mansion.  The surrounding grounds are magnificent!   I see that they have specials for dinner for two and a classic room for 310.00 euros.  Sweet night!  Currently recovering from jet lag, can't wait to start wandering...",5,2013,02,21
238,Fabulous Family Hotel,"Second stay at this hotel and it was perfect.  Staff were very accommodating.  We arrived early and could check in no problem.  The children received little art packs and the hotel had two Hamleys (toy store in Dundrum/London!) staff providing entertainment for the children in the playroom - nail painting, arts and crafts, another excellent addition.  The pool and jacuzzi are spotless and we used twice on our one night stay.  Our package included a bottle of prosecco and chocolate dipped strawberries which were delivered to our room after our pool trip, much to the delight of our little girls.  Had dinner in Bar, very delicious.  Breakfast fantastic aswell although it was very busy and had queues to the food.  (Only negative was the toast making area is a bit away from the hot food.)  All in all, a majestic hotel with magnificent staff.",5,2013,02,20
238,Very good value,"We stayed 30 Dec 2012 on a one night dinner and breakfast special booked on their own site it was great value. Nice hotel, we had a standard room no issues...presume there are flashier rooms but we were on the basic package. It was our anniversary but no upgrade alas. I did ask for a very nice table to be reserved for us for dinner, I asked twice to be sure! but we were placed in the middle of the dining room, jammed in with other tables elbow to elbow, you can hear conversation from other tables so whisper your sweet nothing's in a very low whisper if dumped in a mediocre table. This was only gripe...not given a nice table despite two requests. All in all it was very nice though. One thing to watch for is being too near kids...it's a leisure hotel on school hols it's full of kids so book dinner late to avoid kids at dinner. Recommended.",4,2013,02,20
238,Lovely Stay,"I recently stayed here with my husband and 2 young children.  We had a lovely stay, thanks mostly to the wonderful staff, they really are a credit to the hotel. Our room was very spacious and had everything we needed.

we ate mostly in the bar, as it suited us better.  The food was very tasty and the service was excellent. 

The pool was a good size and clean.  I should mention that it was very busy when we were there and they had to set up a waiting list for people to go in.  Once I realized this, I decided to phone the pool staff and check beforehand (to avoid disappointing the children, who would be all revved up for a swim).  This worked out very well for us, as I could put our names down and we would receive a call within 15 mins to say it was ok to come down. Everyone happy!

On one night we availed of a DVD player and 2 DVDs, the children were thrilled and I must say the staff at reception couldn't have been more helpful - nothing was too much trouble.

My impression of this hotel is that if you have a problem or an issue, the staff will do their utmost to rectify it if they are made aware!

All in all, a very pleasant stay in a lovely hotel with excellent staff...",4,2013,02,19
238,Nice family friendly hotel,"My boyfriend and I recently stayed at the Druids Glen for two night stay.  We got a great deal that included two nights and dinner.  I had heard alot about this hotel and was looking forward to a nice peaceful stay using the spa facilities etc.  The hotel was very nice and all of the staff were absolutely lovely - so friendly and helpful.  There were alot of families in this hotel and unlike the review before me, we went outside of the school holidays.  It is good to know this upfront before booking.  I had thought I was going to a spa type of resort but turned out differently.  Anyway, still had a good time.  The food in the restaurant was really nice and well done.  We had asked for a specific table for the next night and the staff remembered our request and kept our table for us.  Breakfast buffet was lovely and free newspapers for guests.  Spa was really nice too but definitely book in advance.  I had booked a week before and already slots were limited.  The rooms were really clean and spacious, we had a lovely view too.  A few kids running up and down the corridors but didnt disturb us too much.  If you had a family this place would be great, there was a good playground outside and plenty of space for them to run around.  

We had lunch in the bar the next day while watching the rugby and again you couldnt fault it, food was lovely, staff were really attentive etc.

For me it was the staff that made my stay.  They were so obliging.",4,2013,02,17
238,Family friendly stay just outside Dublin,"I stayed at Druids Glenn Resort with my partner overnight for valentines. 

We couldn't fault the room, we stayed in an executive suite and it was lovely! Huge room with a lovely welcome card from the hotel manager and a box of lily o brien's chocolates compliments of the hotel. Later in the evening when we came back from dinner there were two valentines chocolates left on the bed, very nice little touches.

Every staff member we encountered was very helpful, from check in to drinks in the bar, the spa, leisure centre, restaurant and breakfast, everyone was very friendly, chatty and helpful. 

We spent some time in the leisure centre, the facilities are great.

Then we spent an amazing afternoon in the spa. The atmosphere is such that you can't help but relax while you're there. Treatments were lovely, and the relaxation room is like being in another world! 

The location of the hotel itself helps that feeling, it is quite close to Dublin (took us about 30 mins to get here) which is nice when you are only away for one night, but the location makes you feel like you are miles away from the 'real' world. It's very easy to find though and very well signposted from the n11. 

There were however a couple of issues with the hotel, this is a family friendly hotel, and we stayed during the school's mid term break, so there were a lot of children around, running in the corridors outside the rooms playing and being rather noisy, not the hotel's fault, but it did wake us quite early in the morning. Also, we were a couple staying with no children, but if you are a family looking to stay, there are lots of friends around for your children to play with.

The restaurant was very busy at dinner being valentines night, so we had quite a  Wait between starters and mains. Starters were delicious (have the Caesar salad!) we both had steak for mains, mine was underdone, and the chips were dry like they had been left under a hot lamp for a while. That said, the staff did come back to say they hadn't forgotten about our mains, and that the kitchen was just very busy. When we did mention our issues with dinner they were very apologetic and looked after our desert for us, which was a nice touch. 

Breakfast the following morning was nice. The usual selection with pancakes and omelettes made to order.

Overall, we had a lovely stay at the Druids Glenn, and we would return, just maybe not during school holidays. ",4,2013,02,15
238,Good hotel with excellent service,"My girlfriend and I used a pigsback deal to head to Druids Glen for a Saturday night. The deal included a bottle of Prosecco and chocolate dipped strawberries on arrival. The hotel presents well from the outside and the lobby is stylish, as you would expect from an ex Marriott hotel. The staff at the front desk were very nice and asked us how our day had been (we were checking in at 5pm). 

Our room was on the third floor and very big, but it was a family type room with a door to the adjoining room.....not something we like given the potential noise levels. I rang reception straight away and asked for a room change. ""No problem, just give us a few minutes and we will drop a new set of keys up to you"" said the lady on reception. Nicely done. New room was down the hall and around the corner and it was the exact same type of room, just withouth the connecting door. The room was very large and one which you would be happy to stay in for a few days.

I treated my gf to a massage. As I had only arranged a few days before, they could only offer 25 mins (€50). It's a bit pricey but worth it for a romantic weekend. The relaxation area is quite nice. We didn't try the pool at all but will do next time.

We had dinner around 8.30 so we avoided any kids in the restaurant. We were offered another deal. €35 for three courses. We were going to have two courses and it would have cost slightly more so we went for the deal. Very happy with the scallops and ceasar salad starters. My gf had seabass for main which she said was very nice. I had the duck which was overcooked and the sauces etc were very rich. I've had better. Desserts were very good. My gf had the chocolate fondant (freshly made) and white chocolate ice cream from another dessert and I had the banoffie with banana ice cream. Both very nice. Our bottle of wine was nice and was reasonable at €27 although those who are into their wine might be disappointed with the lack of dates for their wine choice. Overall, dinner was good but just let down by the overcooked duck.

We retired to the bar for a couple of night caps. Musician in the bar was very good and you could see the audience was enjoying it. Bar service was excellent.

Breakfast was a bit chaotic but we were down at 10.30am so not surprising. I would strongly suggest getting down earlier as there is a very good selection if it is all there. We watched the rugby in the bar and had dinner before leaving for the evening. Cod and chicken burger were both very good with chunky chips. Couldn't complain and not bad value.",4,2013,02,11
238,Weekend break,"Stayed here and couldn't fault anything. It was fantastic . Staff were excellent in every aspect and very friendly.  Very clean, bed very comfortable and pillows to die for. Food was excellent. I can't say enough about it, will definitely be back. Thank you",5,2013,02,10
238,Just great,"We have just spent 3 days and 2 nights and we are totally relaxed, rejuvenated and ready to go again. The Staff are absolutely amazing and though this is a large Hotel the friendliness of the staff gives it a family feel.
Though we were booked in on a ""deal"" we felt like we had booked the most expensive suite. From arrival when we were met by Adrienne through to breakfast with Kasia we knew that we were in good hands.
The leisure centre is a must and breakfast a delight, a full cold buffet followed by a hot breakfast served to your table (will keep you going till dinner). Then the papers in the very large lounge where you could relax in front of one of the hotels magnificent fires.
The friendliness is very special, when we arrived for breakfast I asked if they had any papers, ""of course we have or would you rather talk"" was the reply, now having been married 30 odd years this had us laughing all the way to the table (we read the papers later). 
Bottom line, if you are looking for a break or indeed a longer stay, you have to go, we most certainly will (again) as it is ideally positioned for Wicklow the South East and Dublin.
By the way the bar is very relaxing and the pints and service excellent.",5,2013,02,09
238,A lovely spot,"We stayed here overnight while attending a wedding. The room was lovely and very spacious and very clean. The atmosphere was welcoming and the staff were very pleasant. There were a lot of children in the hotel and that makes me think it would be a perfect spot to return to for a family break. Breakfast the next morning was great. The wedding was amazing and food was delicious, a great wedding spot. Looking forward to a return visit.",5,2013,02,07
238,Fantastic staff,"I stayed here for a weekend last year and it was amazing. The staff really were first class, so friendly and welcoming and beyond helpful. The rooms were great and we found the whole place really cosy and just a pleasure to be there. We also used the spa and loved it. I would 100% go back to Druids Glen.",5,2013,02,06
238,Absolute Heaven!,"Just back from an amazing weekend at Druids Glen. From the minute we checked in we were made feel very welcome and we were even upgraded to a suite as we were celebrating a special occasion. The service was outstanding across the board - at reception, in the bar, in the restaurant, in the leisure centre. I stay in a lot of hotels with my job and I think the service we received this weekend was the best we ever experienced in Ireland. The food was also exceptional  - from the breakfast to the bar food and the meal we had on Saturday night in the brasserie was fantastic! My only complaint is the run I had to go for yesterday to compensate for the Chocolate Fondant! So worth it! The leisure facilities were also very good and the whole weekend was so relaxing and chilled out - exactly what we needed! We were on a Deal Rush offer and unlike some places that look down their noses at you for this, the staff at Druids Glen did the complete opposite! They were extremely welcoming, and even offered us a great deal in the restaurant on the Saturday night. The place was packed so whatever you're doing, keep doing it and thanks a million for a fantastic weekend! We'll most definitely be back! We've started a 'tradition'!!",5,2013,02,04
238,Perfect mid week break!,"Just back from a 2 night stay. I have nothing bad to say about the resort. The rooms , food , staff , pool and spa were amazing and I have never left somewhere feeling so relaxed! Will defo be back, the sooner the better",5,2013,02,01
238,Beautiful Hotel,"Our family of four stayed here and found it to be very tastefully decorated w/ spacious, clean rooms. It was close enough to Dublin to make it a nice suburban choice if you don't want to be right in the city. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The restaurant food was very good. The recreation was nice w/ a swimming pool, plunge pool and sauna. There is also a golf course but we did not use it during this visit. The beautiful Wicklow Mountains were to one side and the sea was to the other. Out of the hotels in and around Dublin that we stayed at, this one had the most amenities and was the most modern in a tasteful way. Would absolutely choose this resort again.",4,2013,01,31
238,A very nice stay,"I stayed in this Hotel for a cousins wedding in May 2012. I thought the Hotel rooms were a little dated but still very clean and spacious. Staff were really nice and welcoming, food was fantastic. Swimming pool was very big and the wet area was perfect. over all excellent stay.",4,2013,01,31
238,Great weekend at Druids Glen,"We booked Druids Glen for our wedding reception later this year and wanted to try out the guest experience in advance so decided to spend a weekend there. It was fantastic! Upon arrival on Friday night we were shown to our room - although we had only reserved a standard room, we were lucky enough to be upgraded to a magnificant suite. Te suite was at the corner of the hotel and absolutely huge. It was equiped with a fireplace, which we took full advantage of as the weather was really cold and wet outside. Given the weather, I didn't get a chance to try the golf course. I've played Druids Heath before and found it excellent but I really want to try the Druids Glen course, our view from the room make it look fantastic. The food was excellent all weekend for breakfast, lunch and dinner. We ate in the bar for lunch and the restaurant for dinner. Both were outstanding. I had a slight preference for the bar as I would generally prefer something a bit more casual and the setting was great. The staff were all extremely welcoming and filled us with confidence that our wedding will be executed really well. My fiance also tried the gym and the spa and thought both were excellent. We can't wait to go back!",5,2013,01,31
238,Great Family Break,"We recently stayed for 2 nights in the Druids Resort and have to say it is extremely accomdating to families (Swimming pool, outdoor and indoor play areas), The service was excellent, the staff were friendly, the weather was terrible but thats ireland! They have great chicken wings!",5,2013,01,31
238,a little piece of heaven!,"Stayed here for my birthday after wanting to stay here for ages..well worth the wait! We were greeted by the lovely Adrienne at reception, she was very pleasant and efficient while telling us everything we needed to know for our stay.. we stayed in a suite, very nice, spacious and a nice homely feel to it.. I used the gym once we checked in, very nice guy on the leisure centre reception, colin if I remember correctly. Loved the treadmills with the built in tv screens really pass the time when you are burning calories :-) . We went for bar food that evening and we were served by paddy and kieran who both made us feel very at home. The food was gorgeous, well worth it, would definately recommend here for food. We  had breakfast served to the room the next morning it was nice being able to sit in the living room area and eat it, again food lovely! I went to the spa for a treatment all lovely , my therapist was really chatty and friendly, she was blonde think her name was roisin. Overall it was fabulous, I can't say enough about the staff, they are the friendliest I have met in a long time and this is so important.. will definately be back!!",5,2013,01,30
238,Staff are exceptional,"Just back from stay in Druids glen
Super time particularly because of exceptional staff who could not have been more helpful
Restaurant was superb and service was excellent 
Facilities and location superb ",5,2013,01,28
238,5* Service,"Just back from a night away in the Druids Glen Resort. This is a fantastic hotel - clean & spacious room added together with fantastic food - a winning combination! We had arrived later than planned so opted to eat in the bar, the food was as good as, if not better than some restaurants I've eaten in.  As mentioned in previous reviews, the staff are superb - from our initial reservation with Shelly, check in with Louise, every single staff member we encountered proved to be friendly, courteous, and ""go out of the way"" helpful!  Also a mention for the breakfast on offer, fantastic selection to suit every taste -  beautiful fresh produce and despite being very busy, the cooked section along with the juices, breads, fruit & cereal was regularly being topped up  .... finally hat's off to whoever makes that delicious homebaked brown bread!!! Will most definitley return :)",5,2013,01,27
238,Spa let's it down,"Brilliant beds wanted to take them home with me along with the duvet and pillows best ever......breakfast disappointing , very bad room service...quality 2* ....spa most disappointing compared to other facilities in the hotel 2* ",3,2013,01,25
238,Great Stay !!,"Myself, my boyfriend, and my parents went to the Druids Glen for a night in October 2012. This was a very enjoyable stay, the food was top class, staff were very attentive, they could not do enough for you. The bar was very relaxing, and again the staff were great. The rooms very excellent, very spacious, all the extras in them too. The Druids Glen is heaven, well worth a visit, I will be surely going back !!",5,2013,01,24
238,Druids Glen - Fall Under the Spell...I certainly did...thanks,"Druids Glen strap line is ""Fall Under the Spell"" and as I said in my title, I certainly did.  I stayed there for business for two nights on 9th and 10th January and could not have had a more magical experience.  I chose the Druids Glen because I wanted to lock myself away for two days of focused, creative work and I thought that I could really mix up work with exercise (both with the facilities and the grounds) to help my creativity and productivity.  It certainly was the best choice for those reasons and the room was really spacious and comfortable, but I got so much more than that too.  
One thing I noticed was the apparent happiness levels of the staff and everyone I met seemed to go out of their way to help me or seemed tuned into creating a richer experience for me, which I really appreciated and valued.  Here are some examples of the spell that the staff helped to create :-)  .
The girl who checked me in on reception (and I arrived early) seemed to read my mind and gave me a lovely, quiet room which was exactly what I needed as I was there on my own to do creative work. 
The bare foot therapist who I met on the stairs on my way to the gym who went bare foot for two reasons, she said 1. so that she could remain grounded during her treatments and 2. so that as she moved around the treatment room that clients would not be disturbed by unnecessary noise.  How caring is that and how cool is it that she can work in bare feet, which allows her to be more comfortable and take care of her clients in this way?
The foreign employee at breakfast who has a two year old daughter and who had the lovliest, most gentle way about him as he welcomed, served and helped me each day.  One morning I was leisurely having breakfast as I was working and writing at my table and he asked me if I would like fresh tea?  Such a nice touch, thankyou.
Amy - at the front desk who helped me one night at midnight when I rang her from my room in my pj's wondering if I had left my book in the bar.  She went to look for it and when she couldn't find it there, she walked from the bar down to my room in case I had dropped it on my own journey.  What great customer service that was.
The staff at the Leisure Centre who were full of fun and who were so friendly and great at what they do.  I attended a Kettle Bells class while there and it was led by a great guy with lots of energy and warmth.
Michelle in the Spa who I called into after working out in the gym when my thoughts and insights were coming fast and furious and I needed to write them down - I asked her for a pen and paper and she asked me if I wanted a clipboard to lean on also.  All the little touches were attended to.
The foreign guy who looked after me in the bar when I ate there one evening and made me a real latte when the machine one didn't just taste as good :-)
I also met a member of staff in the pool who I was thrilled to see was able to use the facilities of the hotel when he wanted.  He was using them before he started work pretty much each day, he told me and he was really happy at work too as a result.  I thought that it was cool that the hotel allow their staff to exercise and use the facilities, without restriction (as I know some hotels don;t allow this) which obviously has an impact on their overall happiness levels and ability to give great customer service.  
As if that wasn't enough, I attended a wonderful Yoga class with Sinead who took the time at the beginning of the class to get to know everyone's name and went around then during the class helping each person move into their postures in a more easy way and using their name to draw them in deeper to the experience of the class. Bliss :-)
The only small hitch was one night I ordered dinner to the room and for some reason it wasn't great.  It was overcooked and lukewarm and I didn't enjoy it much.  Other than that though the food was beautiful and the homemade granola at breakfast was a treat.
Overall though, this hotel was truly amazing.  For me all the ingredients were there - beautiful rooms, interesting and inspirational Irish pictures and stories to read up around the hotel, great food, fantastic facilities with access to classes as well as the gym and swimming pool and then above and beyond this was the exceptional service from every single member of staff with whom I interacted.  

Thankyou, thankyou, thankyou Druids Glen and all who helped me there.  I got some really excellent thinking time and work done while there and am looking forward so much to returning again on my own and to also bringing my family to enjoy it just as much.",5,2013,01,23
238,Excellent 5 Star - Druids Glen,"This is hotel is a 5 star in all areas, its elegant, warm, charming and extremenly professional and friendly staff, a home away from home. We stayed for 3 night new years eve and enjoyed a fab meal and my child was treated extremely well by all staff, if you have not visited Druids geln its a must - no need to travel outside the hotel as it caters for all your needs - cant wait to go back for a few days or rest and relaxation. Great Spa and Pool.",5,2013,01,21
238,Great service,"we were there for a girls night away and absolutely could not fault it. The rooms were clean and spacious and had everything we needed. The dinner was fantastic - really delicious and our waiter was so good - very attentive but not overly so. We just had drinks in the bar following the dinner and really enjoyed the musician there that night. I personally didnt use the spa facilities but my friends did and were very impressed. I used the pool and jacuzzi and we almost had the pool to ourselves although it did look very busy earlier in the morning. The jacuzzi is a bit on the small side but other than that there was no complaints.Great variety available for breakfast the next morning too. The one thing that really stands out in this hotel is the staff. From the moment we walked into the hotel  - every staff member was so polite, friendly and nothing was too much bother for them - in particular our waiter in the restaurant. Would definitely recommend it and cant wait to go back!",5,2013,01,20
238,January Night away,"Stayed for one night in January, had spa treatment, lunch, dinner, drinks and breakfast. Couldn't fault anything. Service in all areas was top class. Bar food and restaurant were of the highest standards, reasonably priced and perfect sized portions. Atmosphere in the bar was great with an excellent musician playing until 1am. Rooms very spacious and very comfortable. All Sky Sports Channels was also a noticeable extra. The following morning we did the walk around the golf course, some fantastic views and scenery along the way. All in all I have nothing but the highest of praise for the hotel in general. Will definitely be going back",5,2013,01,20
238,"excellent service, friendly staff","Just got home from our stay at Druids Glen after spending  the weekend celebrating my Mother in laws birthday. We arrived at reception and got a very warm welcome from the staff at reception which set the tone for the whole of our stay. We had drinks and dinner in the Bar on Friday night the service was excellent Philip our server was friendly and attentive the food was excellent.
 On saturday we tried the pool again the staff where friendly and helpful, saturday evening we had dinner in the restaurant which again friendly,i think our server was Meave who had a great sense of humour and irish charm and really looked after us. I had chowder then seabass and choc fondant all where excellent as was all the food that our party had. I also had a cocktail at the bar again the service was friendly and the whisky sour was properly made and very tasty. The room was spotless and very roomy the bed  very comfortable.
 Breakfast was relaxed again friendly service with a great selection of food available all served with a smile even though it was quite busy.
 We had an excellent stay and will be back soon hopefully the weather will be a lot better.",5,2013,01,20
238,Great service but bit dated,"Stayed for 2 nights with family and checked in and decided to go for a swim and got our stuff ready and went down to pool to be told it was too busy and go back to room and they,d call us when it was available ,the hotel is clean and comfortable but a bit dated and it's more for golfers and not really for kids ,the games room is unsupervised and no structure which other hotels have and my kids wanted hot chocolate and in other hotels i,d be in there,d be satchets of hot chocolate with the tea and coffee in room and when I asked the chambermaids they told me to call room service for hot chocolate  , one thing I would say about this hotel is the staff are great and would do anything for you , the food and drinks in the bar are very expensive , food in restaurant is very nice and staff couldn't, do enough for you  , I wouldn't, go back mainly to the cost of the weekend but I see its been advertised on the voucher websites so who knows ",4,2013,01,19
238,Unbelievably sublime dinner!,"We booked the Druids hotel for a girls weekend, there were 6 of us and every one of us enjoyed our stay. We started off with an early check-in, getting a very friendly welcome from the reception staff who were more than happy to assist my mum who is disabled - providing a room close to the lifts and the spa. The bedrooms were gorgeous and nicely kitted out with free bottles of water, tea & coffee (including flavoured teas) and the bathroom products were from The White Company which I love. Once settled we went for a bite of lunch in the bar - the menu was a bit short on choice if you don't like seafood but reasonably priced for the hotel. Then it was on for a spa treatment - unbelievably amazing! Followed by a visit to the pool area - the only thing I can fault there is in the sauna & steam rooms there were patches of missing tiles so watch your feet. Once we were all pampered & relaxed we got ready for dinner. The waiter we had was brilliant, he was funny and attentive but not overbearing. Now the dinner - Oh my goodness, just sublime! Hands down, the best meal I have ever had and I would say it's going to be hard to beat. The breakfast was beautiful as well, lots of choice and an omelette bar. The grounds of the hotel are stunning and it's lovely peaceful walk. 

All in all, I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2013,01,19
238,Nice place to stay,"Warm welcome, spacious and very nice room, nice lobby and good atmosphere in the hotel. Very good quality of food and service. Only the breakfast aera would need an extensive cleaning (especially the dust in the shelf behind the buffet - looks like it had never been dusted before) If matching with our schedule, we will come back soon!

238,Weekend celebration,"Our family went to Druids Glen resort to celebrate our 30th anniversary.  The proximity to the city meant we could support one of the boys football matches then hit the road and arrive early afternoon.
The welcome from reception staff was a real warm 'reception' which set the tone for the rest of the weekend. Our room was exceptional and spacious and while we had a surprise of an upgrade, the other family members rooms were also extremely comfortable.
The restaurant staff and menu were top class and made us feel completely at home.  They also became accomplices in another family surprise which added to the buzz for our evening meal.
The comfort, friendliness and value were exceptional and would encourage return visits with no hesitation.  Thank you to all at Druids Glen Resort for making our special weekend really special.",5,2013,01,17
238,Very Relaxing Hotel,"Went as a couple a few weeks before christmas and thoroughly enjoyed it.
The room was spacious and lots of storage space. Ther bathroom had everything in it.
Had a beautiful walk around the grounds and the golf club took approx one hour, then went to the pool in the afternoon and had it to ourselves which suited me as I am not a good swimmer the water was beatuiful and warm, then went to all the showers steam room jacuzzi etc it was really relaxing and easy access back to our room. I could recommend it to a family or couples of any age also would suit a group of friends you dont  have to be a golfer. We eat in the bar and the dining room both was very very good and the breakfast is an experience. Good athmosphere in the bar at night. The staff verry helpful and friendly without been in your face. The foyer area is very comerfortable with beautiful seating area and fires lighting all day. They have a beauriful area outside for eating/sitting which would be beautiful in the summer time, great views. I will go back again. Good deals to be had there.",5,2013,01,17
238,Best service and food standards I've experienced in a long time!,"From the moment we arrived all 8 of our party were looked after extremely well. The attention to detail was superb special mention to staff Romy. The restaurant food was the best I've had in a hotel in a very long time so thank you Chef! And our waiter lois (not correct spelling sorry). His manner, humour and delivery of service was flawless!
Cannot wait to return!",5,2013,01,13
238,A three generation family lunch,"Exceptional, and all down to excellent management and wonderful attentive staff. It's so rare to find. Food was excellent, we has 19 at our table, babies to elderly and all went a dream. Timing impeccable, food warm, glass always full, we could relax and chat as staff just worked around us.
A beautiful hotel with beautiful surroundings, spa and two golf courses. Next time I'm in Ireland it's top of my list to visit again.",5,2013,01,11
238,great!!!!!!!,"we arrived at noon, well before the advertised check in time, but were pleased to find that a room was ready, spacious, clean and well appointed, we then went to the pool (top tip....... the pool is restricted to adults only between noon and 3 pm). We can't praise the restaurant highly enough, it was fantastic, we had the venison, .......... best ever!       Breakfast had a wide selection of hot and cold choices, but, no potato bread or wheaten bread, also some of the hot food seemed to have a taint of an unusual cooking oil, but it was, none the less, very good.",5,2013,01,10
238,"Amazing place, amazing staff, amazing wedding!","This is a late review we got Married at Druids Glenn in early October 2012 and I feel we owe it to the hotel and staff to state what an amazing place it is. We found the hotel on the internet and visited it and fell in love. We made numerous visits in the build up to our wedding and have always had an amazing time. Over 100 of our guests traveled to the hotel from England for the weekend and loved it the hospitality from the staff in all areas was amazing. We played golf on both courses which were excellent value for money and beautiful. Everyone fell under the spell and vowed to return! The food on our wedding day was sensational how the chefs produced such high quality food on mass was unbelievable. I have to make a special mention to Nessa the wedding planner who is a star and we cannot thank enough, I struggle to put into words how great a hotel and wedding venue Druids is, its amazing we can't wait to come back! many thanks James and Jemma Bennett",5,2013,01,10
238,great active family weekend,"we had a 2 night stay in the above hotel and really enjoyed our stay, it was full of activityswimming, walking and jogging around the golf course and hotel provided bikes for us to use free of charge. We eat in the bar and food was nice but a little expensive for bar food. Breakfast was excellent and plent of varity, kids loved the choc pancakes! There was a great play room that the kids enjoyed. The leisure centre was clean and staff were very friendly. Overall we really enjoyed our stay here, but id say more a 4 star than a 5 as the bedrooms could do with a makeover. Staff very friendly .",4,2013,01,06
238,all is there as it should be,"Nice, clean, specious rooms. Comfortable beds. Great service. Very good breakfast. Nice view out of the restaurant place. Pleasant places around for walks. You need a car to Druids Glen though as it is about 40 km outside of Dublin.",5,2013,01,06
238,Another great stay at Druids Glen,"This is our 3rd time staying here in the last year and each time is as good as the last. The main things that don't seem to change with each visit, and are the things that keep us coming back are the amazing food and friendly helpful staff. It was a lovely relaxing end to a busy christmas.",4,2013,01,06
238,December in Druid's Glen,"Druid's Glen is a modern luxury hotel in County Wicklow, about twenty miles from Dublin city. Very comfortable rooms, very good restaurant, lovely fire in the lounge, good swimming pool. The golf course looks great, although I don't play golf. Plenty of beautiful walking and hiking trails nearby in Co Wicklow. We walked around the Birdwatch Ireland sanctuary a few miles from Druid's Glen on the coast at Newcastle - a magical place. Would highly recommend this hotel for a relaxing break, perhaps as part of a tour of the east coast of Ireland.",4,2013,01,06
238,Great Family Hotel,"Stayed at Druids Glen Resort on the 30th Dec for one night with my husband and 2 children age 3 and 5. It was our second stay at the hotel. Staff are excellent, very welcoming and friendly in all areas of the hotel. Food was beautiful both at dinner and breakfast and plenty of choice for children. There was a buffet of roast dinners for them but we were also told they could order burgers or anything else they wanted. We had 2 interconnecting rooms which are a great size. The pool was good. And a nice temp. It was v busy but it was the christmas holidays so to be expected. Since our last visit the hotel has made a new childrens playroom which unfortunately wasn't as good as I thought it could be. There was a car playmat and no cars, an easel but no paper or colours so we didn't stay long. There is a great outdoor playground though. In general I feel this is a great family hotel. Maybe not what I would consider 5 stars but definitely a good 4 star. I don't feel it is suitable for couples as it is very geared towards families. This suits us so we will definitely be returning!",4,2013,01,05
238,It had the feeling of a family hotel because everyone working there were so naturally warm and welcoming.,"Stayed for 4 nights and I had a Wonderful time during my Christmas break away. 
Food was excellent and so was the location.
Thanks to all the staff for your hard work and making it appear so effortless.
See you again soon

238,Good stay. Suites are large and staff friendly.,"We stayed for two nights in October and were pleasantly surprised by the size and comfort of the one bedroom suites, plenty of room for a couple and a child. It may not have had the 'wow' factor of some other 5* bedrooms but it was fine. I was also impressed with the friendliness of staff, especially the young woman at check-in who made a fuss of my young daughter and mentioned some of the children's activities available to her. 

It was tricky to get a table for dinner in the bar but breakafst was excellent the next morning. Pancakes and omlettes were cooked to order at the counter and guests were encouraged to use this service. Service at dinner in the main restaurant attempted to be overly formal and the menu didn't appeal hugely. That would be a bit off-putting for a second visit but the free children's buffet went down very well.

The pool wasn't particularly impressive but that and other niggles could easily be overlooked as the hotel was so comfortable to spend time in and the staff seemed delighted to have guests there. It makes such a difference when people have been trained in how to be pleasant and welcoming.",4,2013,01,01
238,Geared towards families with small children. Not couples!!!,"mixed views about this place. booked it for a romantic break over christmas for me and my BF. 

In general the hotel is grand. rooms are very clean and staff are lovely but the room decor is so so dated. the green carpets and green curtains are horrible with the yellow walls!  our room was OK. like i said it was very clean but not what I was expecting. Some paint flaking in the bathroom and a massive scrape on the bathroom door. 

This hotel totally caters for families. Couples beware!!! The bar was full of kids any time of the day and night. So noisy and not at all relaxing. I thought my head was going to explode with the noise of the kids running around. We literally could not have a conversation over the noise. 

Went to the pool to relax. Shouldnt have bothered. Again it was like something from Butlins. kids have full reign of the pool from 3-7 which I totally understand if you have kids its great but for us wanting to use the hottub it was a nightmare..

Breakfast was the same scenario, busy busy busy. queues a mile long for the hot buffet.  The food was lovely though. The restaurant food that night was gorgeous aswell. cannot fault it at all and the staff were brilliant too. 

Went to the bar for drinks after. the staff in the bar are friendly and polite, however again kids still in the bar at 23.30 that night. I thought they werent allowed be there after 9pm?

Honestly I would recommend this place for families but if like me you want a relaxing few nights away as a couple you wont get it here. Maybe its due to the time of year or something.. 

We didnt even bother leaving the hotel room the 2nd evening for fear of the noise in the bar. got room service instead! which again was lovely. 

One last thing.. I got the impression some of the girls working in the SPA are very inexperienced. Nice girls but I left with nail polish all over my hands, and I am not exaggerating here! Another one of the girls did fix them up for me but seriously how can you have staff that cant even apply a coat of nail polish working in a 5 star resort spa... i dont get it.. 

overall I cant fault the staff at this hotel, so so professional but personally I dont think Id go back... 

",3,2012,12,30
238,Lovely hotel in beautiful surroundings,"We stayed in October for a weekend and had a very enjoyable time.  The hotel is beautiful as are the grounds.  It is well located to Dublin and to nearby scenic spots and walks which the hotel will advise you on.  The room was spacious, comfortable and very clean. Not as luxurious as other 5* hotels however. The facilities are excellent.  The spa is fabulous and the treatments excellent.  The staff throughout the hotel are friendly and efficient.  The food in the restaurant and the bar was excellent.  We would definitely stay again and would recommend this hotel to others.",5,2012,12,26
238,Wonderful experience,We spent a weekend here with friends in November. Three of us played golf ( fantastic course)  while the other 3 enjoyed the spa . While the bar area  was packed the service was very good. Dinner in the restaurant was excellent in every way and the service from our French waiter( regretfully I have forgotten his  name) could not have been better. Food excellent.  Front of house staff were all most helpful. Will most definitely be back.,5,2012,12,17
238,A Family Gathering,"We decided to invite our three daughters, their husbands, and four grandchildren for a Christmas weekend at this hotel, as they would not be at home with us on Christmas Day.

It turned out to be a great success.  Everyone loved their third floor rooms (we had four adjoining), the swimming pool, cycling on the hotel's bicycles, the food, and all the other facilities of the hotel.

However, above all, we were all absolutely delighted with the staff, who without exception did everything possible to make this family get-together a memorable occasion.",5,2012,12,16
238,Great weekend:),"We stayed here for two nights, the first weekend in December for my birthday. Check in was fast and pleasant. The room was good and thankfully not too hot. All the food we had was excellent apart for the coffee at breakfast which was a little cold but when we asked for fresh coffee it was not a problem. All the staff we met were lovely, friendly and helpful. The only problem we had was when we played golf on the Sunday, it rained the whole time but this was not the hotels fault:) An hour into our journey home I realised I had left some cloths in the room, I called the hotel and they sent them on that day to me no problem. We really enjoyed our stay and will be back.",5,2012,12,11
238,Beautiful Place,"Stayed overnight here in October 2012.  The receptionists were lovely on arrival, the place was nice and warm (it was freezing outside) and we were checked in very quickly.  Our room was gorgeous and big and lovely and warm (I'm a bit of a cold freak so I like things to be warm!).  Nice big TV, bed was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in and the room was big enough for there to be a nice little seating area with table at one end.  The bathroom was grand and big and it had a separate shower from the bath tub which provided an endless supply of piping hot water.
We had dinner in the restaurant and my husband ordered the steak and said it was the best steak he ever had!  I have the pan fried sea-bass which was also delicious.  Food was a little pricey but well worth it for the quality and service.  The waitress was lovely and friendly and there was a nice atmosphere in the dining room.
We slept in a little bit and were a bit late down to breakfast so didn’t get to sample as many things as I would have liked!  The chef did make us pancakes which were delicious and there appeared to be a wide selection of things to choose from.  
All in all I would highly recommend this to anyone.  We had a great, relaxing time.",5,2012,12,07
238,Great Stay,"Stayed here last weekend, check in very courteous and quick, full explanation of hotel's facilities given.Lovely large bedroom with slippers and robe and high quality toileteries. Nice and warm as it was bitterly cold outside.Large screen television with a good choice of channels.
Had dinner in the main dining room and was served by a very nice French waiter who went out of his way to explain the menu and wine list.
Dinner was excellent, nothing rushed, finished off the evening in the bar where a very talented musician entertained us. Breakfast the next morning was buffet style with a great choice of cereals, breads and hot food which was being topped up all the time.
Both at breakfast and dinner the manager on duty checked all tables and chatted with guests.
We would rate this hotel of five star quality and it ticked all the boxes.",5,2012,12,06
238,"Great location, modern hotel (former Marriott).","We stayed here for 2 nights, as we had to get the heck out of Dundrum House (see review).  The hotel is VERY modern and has a GREAT restaurant, bar, and rooms.  The hotel is set back a bit from the ocean, but it is still clearly visible from the on-property golf course.

A very pleasant stay in a GREAT hotel.",4,2012,12,05
238,Fab for families,"Stayed here in June 2012 for one night only.

The drive up is impressive with immaculately maintained grounds. Parking was easy and from as soon as we checked in I knew we were in for a good stay.
Staff were extremely professional and courteous. Made a fuss of the baby etc. and asked us if there was anything they could do to just shout.

Room was cosy and well laid out. Fab T.V , bathroom, robes slippers bottled water etc that you would expect in a 5 star. Nice room service menu too.

All the common areas were maintained to a high standard.

We ate in the bar and had a few drinks. Food was excellent. Staff courteous and manager also passed by the table to see if everything was up to scratch. Lovely atmosphere in the bar area for the afternoon, lots of families and tourists.

Breakfast the next morning was again FAB, definitely 5 star standard. pancakes, fresh fruit, breads cooked breakfast and special dietary requirements catered for. It was the best breakfast I've had in a while whilst away.

Went to the leisure centre swimming with my daughter. Have to say would be disappointed if I was booking this for a ""spa"" break. Have stayed in much better spa destinations( Westport plaza, and Maryborough in Cork far outdid the leisure/spa areas here). Pool was a lovely temperature however and staff very friendly. Dressing rooms were tired could do with some upgrade/ Pool had lots of kids around. Again would possibly have been a bit peeved by this if I was going for R&R.

Overall a fantastic stay and will definitely return . Staff really made the experience one to remember.",5,2012,12,05
238,Excellent,"I stayed here quite some time ago but time has not diminished my experience. The property was very picturesque and very easy to find despite its rural location. The bedrooms were beautifully furnished and well decorated and the facilities were satisfactory. We made use of the health club facilities and were very happy to find them at a high standard of cleanliness and repair and also not too busy which on a weekend away was very relaxing.

The best part though was the dining experience. On the first day we ate in the restaurant where the waiting staff were extremely helpful and knowledgeable providing excellent recommendations on both food and wine. The food itself was exquisite and we were very impressed with the overall presentation of the dishes. On the second night, we had requested a table in the brasserie but due to the high volume of guests we had to wait for some time. Ultimately, the same waiter from the night before offered us a table in the restaurant but with the brasserie menu as he knew we could have been waiting for quite some time otherwise - this initiative really impressed us and the food again was delicious.

The only point to consider was the price overall as for some it may be out of budget but for 5 star service and options it was to be expected and this did not tarnish our experience too much.

We were very impressed with the staff and the hotel as a whole and if I am ever back in Wicklow, this hotel will be my first choice for accommodation.",5,2012,12,05
238,"Wonderful food, wonderful break","This weekend, I stayed with my fiancé in Druids glen. We had a great time and had to write a review. We both had massages in the spa and found the staff to be very professional and gave great massages. The relaxation room was lovely and we enjoyed chilling out there. We ate lunch, dinner and breakfast there and the quality if food was excellent. All in all, very happy with our stay. ",5,2012,12,02
238,birthday to remember,"just finished our stay at the druids glen hotel it was a surprise birthday present and it was just amazing from the swimming pool sauna and spa to the luxury bedroom  chocolate straberries either side if the bed bottle of wine it just blew me away .staff were excellent  warm surroundings .i would highly recommend this hotel directions to the hotel were a little difficult .
food was excellent i will definatly go back and stay there again",5,2012,11,30
238,Average for a hotel of its rating,"I liked this hotel, don't get me wrong. It just lacked the luxury it should have for its rating. Lobby is lovely, big with fires lighting - conservatory of the bar area has a great feel (although both the bar and conservatory were quite cold) - food was delicious, i had a chicken burger and dessert tasted great but was no more than a spoonful of banoffi so severly over-priced at approx €7.50
Wait-staff were very nice and helpful, especially one american guy. Breakfast was amazing and definately the highlight of the stay! plenty of everything in a nice big bright room and a chef on hand for Omelettes and pancakes! Can't fault it!! 

Room was clean, standard but air conditioner was noisy and shower leaked when turned on. Beds were also very small for ""doubles"" 

Book early to avoid spa disappointment, i rang the week we were due to check in and couldn't get an appointment. 

Grounds are nice, but the ""walk"" isn't a full circle so it's annoying to have to double back and see the same path twice, views aren't great.

Druids Glen is much more suited for golfers than romancers! 

Very standard for a supposed 4/5*",3,2012,11,27
238,Highs and Lows,Stayed on a one night package with dinner bed and breakfast. When we arrived at reception we were ignored by the girl behind the desk while she took a very complicated booking over the phone. She never even looked up to acknowledge our presence. We had the same problem on checking out. This time she was searching on the Internet for activities for a guest. When she eventually delt with  us she gave me an overcharged bill. I showed my original booking documentation and she changed the price down to what I had booked it at. I wonder how many guests were caught out this way. Our room was large and bright. A little short though on toilitries and tea bags and the tissue box only had 3 tissues left in it. There was free wifi in the room but it was very slow. The heater in the room was very noisy. The bed was large and comfortable. There was a large bathroom with separate powerful shower. Our dinner had good and bad points. The veg soup had a strange spicy taste that was unpleasant. Lovely home made bread accompanied. The main of sea bass had 2 very nicely cooked fish fillets but some very undercooked hard vegetables. The dessert of pavlova for 2 was excellent. Breakfast was all self service. A bit short on fresh fruit though. No berries or whole fruit on offer. Only 2 fruit juice apple and orange. There was plenty of cooked food though. Coffee unfortunately was awful and only served warm not hot and I had to ask for some tea instead. The hotel has very nice views of the Wicklow countryside. Hard enough to find down narrow country roads. Did not sample their spa but it seemed a bit pricey.,3,2012,11,26
238,Spa Break,"Myself and a friend decided that we wanted to get away for a few days somewhere in Ireland. Another friend suggested Druids Glen, a spa hotel in Wicklow, so we checked it out, got a good deal and went for 2 nights mid week. The directions on the hotels webside are not very good, so after the scenic journey we arrived. I was booked in for a full body massage, it was nice but not amazing as I had expected. It cost €90 so I didn't think I got value for money, I have had better nassaged for less than that aroung the €50/60 mark. The bedroom was lovely and spacious with 2 double beds, the bathroom had a shower and seperate bath, so that was lovely. We dined both evenings in the bar as you didn't have to book and we got the same food as you would in the restaurant & it's cheaper! The food was top class, we also had lunch one afternoon it was delicious. Top marks to the chefs, the food was by far the highlight for me. There was a lovely cosy atmosphere in the bar/conservatory area and the staff were very friendly. One lady at reception was a bit annoying, almost fake but that didn't detract from our stay. There is also plenty of romm in the lobby area with chairs and sofa's to sit and have a coffee or read the papers. My friend used the pool and said it was lovely, although I didn't use it myself, there is also a gym there.",4,2012,11,22
238,Nice...not amazing,"I stayed here for a night recently and while the hotel is certainly lovely, I didn't notice anything that really distinguished it from a 4* hotel. The room was nice, but not spectacular. We were on the 1st floor (which seemed to be barely above ground level) and didn't have a great view; in fact, the room seemed rather dark. The double beds were extremely small and the bathroom had a small standard bath...the room was overall comfortable and clean but I had expected it to be a bit more luxurious given it's reputation and 5* rating. 
Dinner (bar menu) that night was ok; again not great - I had fish and chips and found the chips to be stale and lukewarm. My partner and I decided to share a dessert, thinking we would have plenty...the banoffee (at almost €8) comes in a tiny pot which would barely qualify as a full portion, again given the price you're paying.
We had hoped to book an appointment in the spa but it was fully booked up; the lady at the front desk took my number and assured me she would ring first thing in the morning to let me know (either way) whether there were any cancellations, however we didn't hear a word from anyone about the spa at all, which again I felt wasn't great service.
Breakfast the next morning was gorgeous and I have nothing but good things to say about it!
Overall we had an enjoyable night away - the location is lovely and so is the hotel in general, but I would have to say that I wouldn't be rushing back there as I feel you can get a similar standard in a cheaper 4* hotel.",4,2012,11,21
238,Top Notch,"The wife and I have just returned from Druids Glen Resort.  We purchased a groupon voucher for one night b&b, bottle of prosecco, chocolate covered strawberries and late check out all for €109.  

This was a fantastic night away.  We were coincidentally celebrating our 1st year wedding anniversary which was acknowledged by the management of the resort with a box of chocolates and a lovely card.  The resort is easy to find, approx 2 miles from newtownmountkennedy which is well signposted off the motorway.

We turned up a little early but we were allowed to check in straight away.  The interior of the resort is beautiful stone work throughout.  We stayed on the third floor in a lovely spacious room which included a mini fridge and safe.  The views were of the local mountain range which was breathtaking.  On the other side of the resort is the view of the Irish sea.  Our bed had a memory foam mattress and duck feather pillows, real comfortable.

We ate at The Druids Brasserie.  I had potatoe and leek soup and the wife had the seafood chowder.  Both were delicious.  we both had the fillet of beef for main course.  again both were succulent and my taste buds are in overdrive now thinking back on it!! had no room for dessert, so full after the mains.  we also drank another bottle of prosecco all of which amounted to €100.  found this to be great value for great food and great drink topped off with wonderful views of the glen and the golf course.

we watched a little tv before going to sleep, plenty of tv channels including sky sports 1,2 & 3.  we slept very well.  breakfast is buffet style.  all food was piping hot and fresh.  a full irish breakfast was to be had along with cereals, yogurts, fruits, cold meats & cheeses, fish, capers, juices, the choice was plentiful and wonderful.  checked out with every intention of returning one day, top notch.

only one small complaint...it was our wedding anniversary and we were included in having a late check out and the room service commenced at about 9am in the adjoining rooms which were very noisy and awoke us, again doesn't take away from the hotel - just the only thing that i found wrong with the place - stay here, you wont be sorry.",5,2012,11,21
238,Relaxing stay at Druids Glen hotel- surprised its 5*though,"We had a one night stay at the Druids Glen hotel and enjoyed it thoroughly. It is a nice play to go for a relaxing break, but I dont think that it has the little touches to make it a 5 star. The staff are all very friendly and helpful and the reception area is lovely. We had lovely tea and scones in the sun room, off the bar, and it was very relaxing. The rooms are very spacious and the beds are lovely and comfpy-this is me being very picky but one think I hate in hotel bedrooms is green carpets- I know they are easier to keep clean but its so 1990's decor. The bathroom was nice and spacious with bath and separate shower- unfortunately our shower was only luke warm, so wasnt great experience. Mentioned at check out and they said they would get an engineer to look at it.
The swimming pool is nice, but have been to nicer swimming pools in 4 star places. Dinner was lovely- I had the scallops which were divine. My husband and I both had the striploin steak and it wasn't great-tough and sinewy- but the dessert was amazing -we went for the pavlova, which you had to share-and it was gorgeous. 
I would recommend Druids Glen for a relaxing stay, but I would have expected more from a hotel that is claiming to be 5 star- its hard to put your finger on it, but its missing the small touches -which were present in some of the other 4 start hotels we have stayed in recently.",4,2012,11,20
238,Very Family Friendly Hotel,"I stayed here for 2 days with my children - Boy aged 4 and Girl aged 7. From the moment we arrived the children were in heaven. At check in they were given activity packs with colouring in, puzzle books etc..The hotel lobby was very spacious with lots of places to sit and relax.

The Room:
The room we were in was spotlessly clean. The beds (2 queen) were extremely comfy with lots of pillows etc. The childrened loved the towel arranged into the shape of a swan. Nice little touches were biscuits with the tea suppies, bottles of water which were replaced every day and slippers and robes for the adults. There was airconditioing / heating in the room if required. There was not a sound from any of the surrounding rooms either night so everyone got a great sleep.

Breakfast:
Breakfast was served in the resturaunt. There was a great variety of breads, cereals, fruit, yogurts etc. There was a chef there to cook you omlettes or pancakes and lots of toppings (strawberrys, cream, chocolate sauce, maple syrup, sugar, lemon juice), This was a big hit with the kids. 

Dinner:
Dinner in the resturaunt was delicious.Kids eat free here but were given a 3 course menu to choose from. Usual favourites such as bangers and mash, fish, chicken etc. Great option was the baby bowl of mash, veg and gravy. Then icecream, jelly and icecream or brownies and icecream for desert, Waiters very attentive and brought the kids glasses of squash without been asked. 

Swimming Pool:
Swimming pool was nice. Water just right and changing areas clean. We got towels from the receptions on our way in so no need to bring your own. Swimming hats are a must so remember to pack your own.

Play Room & Playground:
The playroom was a massive hit. Again it was spotless. There was fuseball, airhockey, arcade games, play house, soft play area and a few other bits and pieces. 
The playground was great. All new equipment  - everything you need in a playground. Open from morning till dusk.

Staff
I could not fault the staff in this hotel. Every one of them that i encountered was very friendly and accomodating - especially the waiters both in the morning for breakfast and for dinner. One lovely touch was in the afternoon there is hot chocolate in the lobby for anyone who wants it with a table set out with fresh cream and marshmallows - again a big hit with the kids.

Overall this was the most family friendly hotel i have ever stayed in. The efforts by the staff to make it that way are there for everyone to see. So much so when it was time for us to check out my children were in tears asking for 'just one more day'.

I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to any families looking for a nice breakaways. You will not be disapointed.",4,2012,11,20
238,This is how it should be done !,"Nice to see a hotel ticking all the boxes.
Excellent staff that treat you as a guest.
Great welcome for children... They ate free in the restaurant before 7pm 
Best laid out buffet breakfast I have seen in a long time, with beautiful porridge.
Excellent quality food in the restaurant.
Playroom for children. Complimentary Hot Chocolate with cream and marshmallows in the foyer. Bottled water, tea/coffee, bathrobes & slippers in bedrooms. So many Hotels cutting out these extras now.
We got a really good deal for a two night midweek stay, but we would be happy to pay more for this excellent hotel !
They work really hard on every aspect of hospitality and we reaped the benefits.
We were here for our parents 50th wedding anniversary with immediate family and everyone of us were so impressed. Well Done Druids Glen ! :)",5,2012,11,20
238,What can I say......,"Stayed here the first week of November with my partner for 2 nights. I had pretty high expectations of the place but it well surpassed it!

Staff were extremely pleasant without appearing fake and the decor of the place was fabulous. 

Ate in the bar the first night and had breakfast both mornings. Food was top-class! A lot of little touches too such a providing clotted cream with the scones made it even better.

Only thing I wasn't mad about was the women's changing rooms in the leisure centre, found them very cramped. Couple of people had children so there was no-where for me to get ready after so had to squeeze passed a few people, grab my stuff from the locker and go back up to my room to change.

On the morning before we left, we went on a shopping trip to Dundrum - only about a 20-25 min drive away which is something nice to do if the weather isn't great!!

Will definitely be returning!",5,2012,11,20
238,Same hotel different room?,"I stayed in this hotel with work, and, being a premier inn / travel lodge customer I thought I was in for a treat with this supposed 5* hotel! Whilst the facilities from restaurant to reception to conferencing to the splendid locations and golf course were all magnificent ( not forgetting the customer service), I found my room to be dark, drabby, outdated and something I would expect to find in the 90s with a shower that didn't drain and a shower door which leaked water on the floor. I really could not get over the difference between reception and my room. Whilst it was more than adequate (and luckily for me, free) I can't complain. However if I was a paying customer expecting luxury because of the 5* status and price tag I would have been more than a little let down by the shabby room. Once again: amazing food, reception, location, golf course, service and conference facilities! So if you have booked / are intending to book don't let my review put you off, just ask for one of the nice rooms :) 
",4,2012,11,19
238,Wonderful Stay,"We had a lovely 2 night stay at Druids Glen. Excellent check in and wonderful service during our stay. Dinner in the Restaurant last night was very good.
Having golf on our door step was an added bonus.
",5,2012,11,19
238,Fell under the Spell,Just returned after spending the weekend at Druids Glenn this is a lovely hotel the rooms are massive very clean and the beds were huge. The grounds were stunning. The staff were very friendly couldnt do enough for u the food was great. The one and only fault was the signs in the dark it was very difficult to find the hotel we got lost twice. Its like a little bit of heaven tucked away in the glens of Wicklow will return again in the not too distant future.,5,2012,11,18
238,Very relaxing place to stay,"Stayed for one night to attend a function. Bedrooms nice and large, very peaceful and relaxing atmosphere throughout the hotel. Friendly staff, great food. Would stay again and be happy to recommend to friends. .. More signage please on the local roads, easy to miss the brown signs in the dark :-)",5,2012,11,14
238,Outstanding Hotel in Every Way........,"We booked an overnight stay Druids Glen during the mid term break. As we have three children, we had to book interconnecting rooms. We would have been happy with the two double and a camp bed, but were told that the max allowed in each room was four, for health and safety. 

It did work out more expensive, but Oh was it worth it. The rooms were AMAZING. The massive kingsize bed in our room and two doubles in the kids room. Everything you need from iron, hair dryer, tea / coffee etc (the kids loved the yummy biscuits), safe and two great big full length mirrors in the lit up wardrobe, so you can check out the back of your outfit too !!

With fluffy robes and slippers in the wardrobe, it felt luxurious. We had a booked a deal with Prosecco and chocolate dipped strawberries, and they were devine. I loved the prosecco so much I took a photo of the bottle to get some in for Christmas. The kids loved the independance of their own room (we liked this too !!).

When we first entered the hotel, I was surprised to see such a small reception desk given the size of the reception area.......althought check in was smooth and plesant. The kids were given activity packs of colouring / puzzle books crayons etc. and they also noticed a large side board with yummy self service complimentary hot chocolate, complete with marshmallos and fresh cream. We decided to just get the bags to the room and come back for the hot chocolate.

We got so distracted with the amazing rooms, we didnt get back out for a little while later and we missed the hot chocolate !! We have promised the kids we would return to Druids Glen, just for the hot chocolate.

We had a little look around the hotel, the beautiful open fires in reception with people sitting on the sofas enjoying a drink, or reading, or kids playing together......it was perfect. It felt like someones home and we were all guests, we instantly relaxed into the whole atmosphere. The bar had another cozy feel to it, we were instantly drawn in to have a drink. With the nicest pint of Guinness I might add.

With the evening drawing in, we decided to leave the swimming pool untill the morning. We had early dinner reservations as the kids get to eat for free in restaurant before 7pm. The restaurant was lovely, the tables nicely spaced out so that you are not near the next table.

The food was just amazing, we had three courses and lovely french wine. The kids got to eat from the kids buffet, and even when two of them didnt like anything on the menu, they got to choose from another kids menu. My daughter said they were the nicest chicken nuggets she has ever had !!

The waitress was so friendly, the whole dining experience was just perfect. We were so full, but managed to find space for a lovely Irish Coffee to finish it all off. We had planned to go to the bar for a drink after dinner, but all we wanted to do was go back to the lovely room, adjust the air con to lovely and warm, kick off our shoes and relax with a glass of prosecco.........heaven.

Unfortunately I didnt sleep much during the night, not because of the comfy bed, or fluffy pillows, it was because of the fan in the bathroom. You know those ones that come on when you turn on the light?, but this was on permenantly. I made sure the air con was off, and closed the bathroom door, but I could still hear it, it was driving me mad.

Eventually my husband got up and went down to reception at 6.45am to ask how to turn it off. She was very helpful and rang the engineer, to find out that it was centrally controlled, and there was nothing they could do. She said it was an absolute first, and they have never had a complaint about it before. Unfortunately that didnt help my case. The receptionist did apologise to me on check out, and mentioned again that they had never had this complaint before. Dunno if it was meant to insinuate that I was lying, but hight pitched noises like that I find very hard to switch off from. 

Anyhow I did say that it would not defer me from coming back to the Druids Glen, I would just remember to pack some ear plugs. That was my only downfall with the Hotel, the fact that I was tired the next day from lack of sleep, was still way outweighed by the wonderful time we had. There was a great little playground outside, and a games room for the kids too.

We enjoyed a swim after breakfast, with the kids, while taking turns to use the steam room / sauna, and a plunge in the ice cold dip pool afterwards to get the circulation going. You need to wear swimming hats, and as there is no kiddies pool the depth is 1.2meters, the small kids will need arm bands. We purchased them in the Hotel, never thought of bringing them.

Breakfast was yummy, fresh and plentyfull.....I could go on and on about everything.

Checking out was a very sad experience.........we really didnt want to leave. The hotel was full to its capacity but at no time did it feel crowded. There is enough space to relax without it feeling busy. Well done to all of the staff...........you have sold the Druids Glen to us, and we have been raving about it to anyone who will listen !!

Cant wait for our next visit....",5,2012,11,09
238,VERY relaxing stay,"This was a wonderful hotel.  We were quite pleased with our stay here.  The staff was incredibly helpful and kind.  The people of Ireland are amazing.  You could ride bikes, go for a walk through amazingly beautiful property.  The restaurant was tasty.  This is a must stay.",5,2012,11,08
238,Great place to have a nice meal!,"I took my parents to dinner here, it was very nice.  Very good wine list and food, got a great table near the fireplace in main dining room and excellent service.  The waiter was from France and was very attentive and helpful with wine selection which is always a plus!",4,2012,11,08
238,stay at this hotel you will be very happy with it,"Had a lovely stay in Druids glen ,and would reccomend it to anyone.The hotel is spotless ,and the staff so friendly and helpfull",5,2012,11,08
238,Marvellous weekend break,"Rooms sooo comfortable!! Restaurant v high quality. Staff couldn't be more helpful. If you are a golfer, no matter what standard, Druids Glen is a superb golf course; Druids Heath is quite challenging but enjoyable.",5,2012,11,05
238,Kids' Heaven,"We booked a two-day golf holiday for the end of October without realizing the implications of traveling during school half-term.  I think we were the only people in the hotel without children! The hotel was formerly a Marriott and looks just like one in virtually every way.  It has a large and active kids' club. We played the Druid's Glen course, which was beautiful and challenging, but it was too cold to play the Heath course, which gets strong wintry breezes all the time.  I have now learned not to book golf at this time of year, and I certainly won't travel during school half-term again.  We couldn't escape the screaming in the restaurant or the running down the corridors at 9:30 and 10:00 at night. The pool and hot tub were unusuable because they were overrun with children, too.  Even the bar was full of them.
The staff members were friendly and helpful, but we couldn't check in early because the hotel was too full.  We had to unload our car in the parking lot to get to our golf clubs to be able to make our 1:00 tee time.  We rented a golf cart for 35 euro for the one round we played, but most people were walking and pulling clubs on a trolley.
Since it was our first trip to Ireland, we wanted to go to a local pub for dinner to experience the local environment.  The hotel recommended one about 30 minutes away, but it turned out to be a complete tourist trap!  There were no Irish people in it except the servers.  Not my idea of local.",4,2012,11,05
238,Wonderful break,We are just back from a 4 night stay in Druids Glen. We were looking forward to our trip away since we booked it in August we were not disappointed. It was beautiful. Staff were so friendly. It had everything in one place for a  relaxing break. Seamus enjoyed his game of golf on the Glen while I drove the buggie and then the next day I enjoyed a treatment in the beautiful spa. The Breakfasts were amazing . Out of all the hotels we have stayed in it is the first hotel were your room is cleaned when you come back from having your breakfast we couldn't fault this hotel.,5,2012,11,04
238,Three comfortable nights,"We were in Ireland for a wedding and decided to stay at the venue and use it as a base to explore the Wicklow area. We were pleasantly surprised by the quality of our stay in what is quite a large hotel geared towards golf and functions.  Our welcome was excellent and even though our room was not ready when we did formally check our bags were in our room.  The staff are friendly but very efficient; the rooms are excellent with a comfortable bed, good bathroom facilities with The White House toiletries and the breakfasts very good with a lot of choice. The Reception area was comfy with good settees and large fires The swimming pool was a bonus (though not quite deep enough) and the jacuzzi a joy after sitting in a car exploring the area all day.  Probably our only criticism was the evening bar snack which really was not that good.  We decided to avoid the restaurant which seemed to be rather expensive.
The Wedding Reception as excellent with good food and efficiently served. All in all
 we thought the hotel was well worth a review.",4,2012,11,04
238,Four Star +,"Just back from a three night break in the hotel.
We had a really great time.
The staff were very good and the hotel had a few nice touchs which elevate it above a four star.
We stayed in an executive suite. We had two roll out beds in the living room.
Rooms are in need of an update. A bit shabby.
Beds are very comfortable and air con can be adjusted.
Bottled water is provided and repleneshed when needed. Two big flat screen TV's in both rooms.
Robes, slippers, tea coffee the usual stuff all there. Free WIFI.

Our worst experiences were at breakfast, we have three small kids so queues are not a welcome sight. We were down for breakfast early too, always about eight.
There were two main reasons for the lines.
1. One guy was frying pancakes, omlettes and fried eggs for the entire breakfast room. He could only fry 4 eggs at a time. It was a ridiculous wait. I tried three times to get fried eggs then just gave up. This is a breakfast staple! These should be prepared in the kitchen and let the guy at the end of the counter prepare specials only, omlettes, pancakes etc. This is what I have experienced in many other hotels.
2. The toasters are rubbish. I could only get warm bread from these stupid machines. I made the mistake of putting one back through the second day, it created some nice smoke. I wasted eight slices of bread trying to get just two slices of toast. There was always a queue here too.
On the third morning they brought out a second toaster, I had alread give up and asked a girl to get me some from the kitchen.
I had a 10 minute wait for cereal bowls the second morning.
All in all breakfast was made a lot more difficult than it should have been.

We ate in the thirteenth twice, food was nice enough. Paid €9:50 for kids breast of chicken with scoop of mash. This was a complete rip off.
Bar service was very good.

There was hot chocolate in the lobby in the evening, very nice. Coffee and croissants on the morning.
There is a good play room for the kids. The playground is very good also.
The pool is fine but is quite small and access is limited to 40.
We did not get in one morning. Kids were not happy.
Gym is well equipped.

This is not intended as a negative review.
We had a lovely break and would return. I hope they address the breakfast issues and review the price/value of the food in the hotel.",4,2012,10,31
238,Not Convinced,"I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in October, 2012, with my husband to attend a wedding.

We were early for check in and this was not a problem for the hotel. We were immediately given our room with no issue. The room was very spacious with a large queen bed. The bathroom was equipped with a large bath and shower. It was clean and welcoming. There is air con in the room which you may adjust accordingly. The room over looked a small courtyard and was in a quiet area of the hotel.

The reception area is very inviting with the large fire and cosy couches in the area. Its perfect for a relaxing retreat.

Food
The bar area is quite small for a hotel of this size and gets untidy very qucikly id tables are not cleared. It was easy enough to get service. We ate in the bar on Friday and we both had the chicken burger with full trimmings. I would give it 3 out of 10. There was no seasoning whatsoever on the dish. The french fries which accompanied the meal were rock hard and unpleasant and the meal was cold. I would not recommend this dish.

We had the wedding meal on the 2nd day and this was delicious, the food was piping hot and very tasty. It consisted of goats cheese tartlet, leek soup, champagne sorbet & cod fillet.

We ate a club sandwich the following day in the bar again and it was violent. We could not eat it and it was served once again with the horrid french fries which resembled a chewing on steel.

We travelled outside the hotel to eat in the evening.

The buffet breakfast was included in our stay and the food was plentiful and fresh and we found no problems with it. A more varied selection of cheeses and meats would be welcome.
 
The areas surrounding the hotel are beautiful for a stroll in the fresh air. 

Spa
I had a french manicure at the spa which I had to re-do myself the very next morning. I would not recommend this service. The girl who looked after me was quiet young and appeared to be inexperienced and it probably did not help that the lights were dimmed whilst she was trying to paint my nails!

The service in the hotel was generally very good, however, it lacks the 5 star finesse.

I would try another hotel in the area before staying here again. You can get better for the price.",3,2012,10,31
238,Disappointing,"Knowing the wonderful location and beautiful golf course, I thought a short weekend break at Druids Glen would be relaxing and rejuvenating alas it was quite the opposite.
We were disappointed to have no option and were given a room  with two double beds, doubt they were any more than 4ft and one was very uncomfortable.  The temperature control in the room didn't seem to work properly even when we turned it down to 16 degrees the room was still hot and it was only with the window wide open that we managed to get some sleep; which is fine except when the winds are howling outside. Water pressure was poor in the shower and the temperature controller on the shower was broken so took a little while to get it right without scalding myself.
Tried to use the Business Centre to deal with a work issue that arose to find neither computer
working and  it was obviously used as a children's playroom with tipex all over the printer and the floor looked as it had not been cleaned for days. We tried to have a quiet drink in the bar but that was an ordeal with the staff moving us several times to accommodate a wedding party ( I'm sure they had a function room.) Disappointing walk around the golf course as you actually don't get to see much of it and then to make it a round back to the resort  you end up out on the road.
I had been  recommending this hotel to many golfing friends who regularly come to Ireland for a game but not anymore particularly when we have so many other fine hotels to show off  with great golf courses closeby.
On the plus side the staff were very courteous and friendly and seemed to be doing their best on a busy weekend, seemed to be more for families with kids activities  than for couples or business travellers.",2,2012,10,31
238,Lovely hotel,"This is a beautiful hotel in a great setting.    A key attraction is golf - the fabulous Druid's Glen course and Druid's Heath course are on the door step.     For non-golfers, the hotel facilities (leisure centre) are first class and the fantastic Wicklow countryside is very accessible for sightseeing, walking or cycling.     There is a shuttle bus to the nearest DART station which means that central Dublin is easily accessible.
The bedrooms are spacious, quiet and comfortable.      The staff are very friendly and helpful.    The food is very good.
Highly recommended!",4,2012,10,29
238,Great spot for a quick weekend break,"We stayed in Druids Glenn twice over the past year. Once as a couple for the weekend and more recently as a small group (14 people).

The Hotel is well-kept, nice grounds, golf course, leisure centre etc.
Location 30mins from Dublin is perfect for a quick get away from the city and being in the heart of Wicklow there is so much to see and do.
Service is fantastic at both front desk and at the bar/restaurant.
Rooms are spacious, clean with nice big comfy beds and bathrooms plus plasma TVs. However, rooms that adjoin others can be noisy as there does not appear to be much insulation between such rooms!
Food in the bar is terrific but in the restaurant our evening meal for the group was just ok with the meat over cooked/dry.
Breakfast time is a bit of a mad house....long queues to be seated, even longer lines to get some hot food. The breakfast itself was great so come down early if you want some peace and quiet and avoid the hassle.

Overall a really nice hotel, good value and one we would stay in again.",4,2012,10,29
238,Great,"The most comfortable beds, snug as a bug in a rug, breakfast in bed, which was disappointing not very warm and later than asked for.  Spa also disappointing not 5 star unfortunately if it was not for te food in the resturant and cosy beds could have been a disaster.",4,2012,10,28
238,Irish eyes are smiling!,"One hour's drive from Dublin city and you can find yourself in the heart of the soft rolling hills of Wicklow with the sea sparkling in the distance. If you like golf, this is your oasis. If not then you still have options....spa? walk? hide and read? We stayed 2 nights for a family wedding and from the moment we crossed the threshold, it felt like home, albeit a rather large one! Every member of staff was attentive, helpful and friendly. The food was excellent (we had DB&B) and service superb. A second wedding party was accommodated with the same courtesy and care. We had a great time!",5,2012,10,27
238,Fabulous!,"We spent six nights at Druids Glen and what a treat.  The location is superb, and only a short drive from Dublin Port - although trying to find the hotel in the dark was a bit difficult - however, a young chap in the petrol station where we asked directions said if we followed him he would take us there - which he duly did and a big Thank You to him! This could only happen in Ireland - everyone is so happy to help.  When we arrived at the hotel we were given a very warm welcome. Our room was huge, albeit decorated in a rather ""corporate"" fashion, but it had everything we needed and a great bathroom with bath and separate shower cubicle - plus White Company toiletries. The bed was massive and so comfortable.  It was lovely to wake up the next morning to a great view of one of the golf courses and the mountains beyond. Where our bedroom was it was so peaceful and quiet. The buffet breakfast was excellent and served up to 11.00 a.m. every day so need to rush.  There was a good choice of hot or cold breakfast, plus a chef on hand to cook omelettes and pancakes to order. Only slight criticism that some mornings the scrambled eggs and bacon seemed to have been hanging around for a while (Suppose we should have got up earlier!). The restaurant looks out over a large decked area looking onto the golf course which would be wonderful to sit out on in warmer weather. We ate in the restaurant on our last night, which was a bit of a treat - again the food and service were excellent. The swimming pool, sauna, steam rooms and jacuzzi were great and during our stay were never too busy.  It was lovely to relax in there late afternoon/early evening after a day exploring the surrounding area.  The only thing I would say is that cleaning in these areas could be better - there were some ""bits"" around the showers which were there for the duration of our stay.  All the staff were so helpful and offered ideas of places to visit nearby, giving us maps and directions. And there are some beautiful places to see - Powerscourt Gardens and House, Powerscourt Waterfall, Glendalough, Avoca Handweaver, Greystones viallage (for nice little shops, and restaurants).  If you don't want to venture out every day there are lovely walks around the hotel - including one around the edge of the Druids Glen Golf Course.  Definitely hope to return to Druids Glen again one day.",5,2012,10,25
238,Splendid Isolation,"This is a wonderful hotel in quite a remote location.  Realistically it is in hour from Dublin, which is not a problem if you want to get away from everything.  It is set in a very picturesque valley and on a golf course,  with a second golf course just down the road.  Facilities are excellent, food is great, betrooms are cavernous, and the windows open to give you fresh air.",5,2012,10,24
238,One of the best hotels I have ever stayed in.,"We enjoyed a 2 day break for my husbands 50th birthday.  From the minute we checked in until the time we checked out, the staff could not have done enough for us.  All the staff were very welcoming, from the girls who cleaned the rooms, the girls on the desks, the bar staff and the staff in the restaurant.  My husband was made to feel that is was his weekend and on arrival to the room, we found a card and box of chocolates for his birthday.  Other nice touches were a chocolate at each side of the bed and  a swan made out of towels. We had a suite which was fantastic, with a tv in the living room and bedroom.   We ate in the bar the first night and the food was great.The breakfast was buffet style and excellent.  We ate in the restaurant the second night and the food was out of this world.  My husbands dessert arrived with a candle on it and the words happy birthday in chocolate.  I highly recommend this hotel and we will be hopefully be back for my birthday next year.  thank you for such a good weekend.",5,2012,10,14
238,"Excellent staff, good food, dull bedroom decor.","Just home from a 2 night stay with my lovely husband in Druid's Glen Hotel.

STAFF:
 I cannot praise the staff enough. From booking, to reception, to dining room, to bar and to housekeeping every single staff member we met both irish and non-irish were extremely friendly, cheerful and helpful. 

BEDROOM SUITE:
As it was a special occassion for us, the reservation staff very kindly upgraded us which was much appreciated.
 The suite was bright and very spacious with a gas fire in the fireplace as well as room based thermostatically controlled central heating. If you don't like air conditioning running all night the very comfy bed can get too hot however. Optional bed covers would satisfy fussy sleepers. The bathroom was very well appointed but as an upgrade in a 5 star hotel I expected a jacuzzi bath and a shower head that can be hand held (Harvey's Point Hotel style). Neither were present.
 MY WHINGE: The only serious gripe I have with this hotel is the dull, almost depressing decor in the suite! While the seating, mirrors, pictures and lamps are very nice, the colour of the walls (cream), doors(brown), plain curtains(dullest green) combine to give a very bleak, inelegant and uncosy, unfinished  feel to what has the basis to be an outstanding room. I am so tempted to pick out a couple of luxurious warm toned, elegantly patterned curtain samples for management as this alone would transform the rooms at a reasonable cost and attract customers back! Another couple we spoke to were also dissappointed with the room decor. Without trying to be cheeky all hotel managers/ owners should visit th deluxe suites in Harvey's Point Hotel in Donegal to see what type of decor and spec attracts us customers back.

POSITIVE POINTS:
 To the many positive points about this hotel: the fantastic friendly staff deserve a second mention! Customer care is definitely working here. Cannot find such a universally lovely lot of staff anywhere, -and no I don't know any of them!

 Most of the public areas, such as the large lobby and the bar are impressive, luxurious, elegant and welcoming - (which shows what should be done with the bedroom decor).

FOOD AND DRINK: 
BREAKFAST: The breakfast dining area was spacious and bright but definitely needs to be warmer. Bring warm clothes to the dining room if you tend to feel draughts or chilly. The breakfast buffets, both hot and cold, were really, really good in most respects, but like the bedrooms would need very little tweaking to be outstandingly perfect! 
Managers please note; 
Please warm up the room.
Don't have the cold buffet in outer Mongolia as an after- thought; it is just as important as the hot food. 
The porridge is scrumptious but a small cinnamon powder dish nearby, alongside the honey, would up the ante. 
Heat up the prunes.
Keep the large plates hot. Because the hot plates are heaped too high in the warmer the top ones are always cold.
Why are the lovely, tasty sausages only luke warm?
Serve potato cakes in the hot buffet.
The best part of the breakfast by far is the presence of a friendly chef to cook fresh omelettes and pancakes in front of you. With chocolate sauce and fresh strawberry pancakes for breakfast who am I to complain about anything?
Was the orange juice freshly squeezed? I hope so but not sure.

EVENING DINNER:   
The length of the evening dinner menu is average but not lengthy. All the courses we had were very well presented, tasty and obviously prepared by a competent chef and team. I would be delighted to dine here again and again. A very nice pinot grigio wine is available both in the bar and restaurant at 6.50 Euros per glass. The quality of the Guinness (4.95E per pint) was good I'm reliably informed! Again however bring warm clothes or order a large bowl of spicy soup to keep you warm in the dining room.

LUNCH: 
 As we were walking in Glendalough national park, we ate a fabulous lunch in the friendliest, cutest Wicklow Heather Pub/Restaurant in the village of Laragh about 25 mins from Druids Glen Hotel and 10 mins from Glendalough. Very reasonably priced food and drink. See separate reviews for the excellent Wicklow Heather on Trip Advisor. Therefore I cannot comment at all about lunch in Druid's Glen Resort.

LOCATION: 
Druids Glen is so easy to access from the midlands on the motorway. Nearer the hotel the resort itself would definitely benefit from better signposting as a lot of us haven't capitulated to sat. nav. just yet. Even on departure the signpost for the narrow country road towards dublin is almost impossible to see until one has passed it by. 
 The small town of Greystones is about 15 mins from Druids Glen Resort. While we only passed through it slowly in the middle of annoying Friday evening rush hour traffic, it looks really attractive if you like unique womenswear boutiques and relaxing coffee shops. The beautiful blue sea is beside you if only access to the beach car parking was better signposted! We gave up on finding parking and returned slightly disgruntled to Druid's Glen. I would love to visit Greystones properly at a quieter time of the week.
There are some awful looking appartment blocks between Greystones, Kilcoole (Glenroe) and Druid's Glen but generally this whole bigger location is the most beautiful in the world.
The breathtaking walks and scenery of Glendalough are a very manageable half hour's drive away and Druid's Glen is a lovely treat after a challanging walk. So despite the disappointing bedroom decor, I look forward to returning to Druid's Glen someday -and the upgrade was genuinely a very nice touch. 
SUMMARY:
Thanks to the lovely staff again. If I owned a hotel (which i don't) I would be trying to recruit the whole lot of them ~ but not the accommodation interior designer!",4,2012,10,14
238,Keep going back,This place is a favourite of mine. My sister was married here last year and it was a great day. Service and food was excellent. I usually eat in the 13th bar and sink into the sofas afterwards. I was at a buffet there in May for a communion and once again the beef was melt in the mouth and you could not fault the food or service.,5,2012,10,11
238,"From the ease of getting there,the service and checking out,couldn't have asked for a more relaxing break","My wife had won a voucher for Druid's Glen months ago and when her birthday was coming up a few weeks ago,we decided to use it. Getting there from Kerry was surprisingly easy and once we got to the entrance,it was clear to see that it was a 5* Hotel. The receptionist that checked us in was very friendly and only took a matter of minutes. Our room had a lovely view of the nearby fields and a balcony door,which was a little hard to close again after opening. The restaurant staff were probably the most professional and friendliest we have ever come across in the country,couldn't do enough for us and even one of the bar staff closed the outside door for my wife when he noticed she was feeling cold. The spa treatment was brilliant and Claire gave me a very relaxing facial,Joanne gave my wife the best facial she says she s ever had,even getting a complimentary nail file and polish because it was her birthday. We stayed an extra night with the dinner and B+B package,which was reasonably priced,however the cocktails in the bar seemed a little bit pricey but then again,it is a 5* Hotel. Overall we loved our stay and we will definitely come back to stay",5,2012,10,11
238,Amazing wedding,"Family and friends visited approx 100 in total For my sons wedding what an amazing time we had, Nessa and the staff were fantastic, every detail was just perfect thank you for an amazing time. From the moment we arrived all the staff made you feel welcome and nothing was to much trouble. Highly recommend this location, also managed to play golf on both courses and used the pool and spa.
",5,2012,10,09
238,Loved it!,"My friend and I stayed for 5 nights the last week of September. Everything was beautiful. Quick check in, the staff were all very helpful and friendly. It was very clean. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The walk to our room was a bit long. The room was amazing. We had a view of the mountains. We had 2 queen size beds, and the beds were so comfortable. Loved the pillows. We had a small refrigerator. The food was excellent. They have everything for breakfast. There is a nice restaurant, and also a bar area. They have a nice patio outside. You can have room service anytime you want. They have a spa and pool, which we didn't use, but looked nice. I would recommend staying here to anyone. I might possible go back someday, I loved it that much.",5,2012,09,30
238,"The Keegans  "" Thank you""","As guests of the L`Estrange\Cahill wedding we would like to thank the management and staff for making our stay perfect.The staff are very friendly attentive and helpful.The rooms are very spacious and exceptionaly clean.Well done to the people who employ these people as they are well chosen and give real meaning to our "" Cead Mile Failte"".Hopefully some time we will return

238,Excellent friendly staff,"My wife and I stayed here for three nights (18/19/20 Sept 2012) and had two rounds of golf. The hotel is very good, the food and service excellent. Every single member of staff, without exception were friendly, polite and most helpful. We shall not hesitate to return.

238,Great hotel,"Stayed here recently on a golf trip to play in a classic in Druids Glen. We arrived at 11am and our rooms were ready. I shared a twin room with a friend and the room was super overlooking the 13th tee, 48"" plazma tv in the room. Thank God the mini bar was empty.
The porter took us to the golf course by courtsy car so the only driving to be done was on the golf course.
We got back to the hotel around 2am and there was a wedding windind up, the residents bar was nice, but €5.20 for a pint of Carlsberg was over the top.
Breakfast was excellent with a hugh choice from smoked salmon to a chef to cook an omlett for you.
Excellent hotel but a little hard to find as the roads around it ar enot great.",5,2012,09,24
238,Hotel not living up to five star rating,"We stayed in the druids glen resort hotel 21 September 2012 for 2 nights.While I agree with other reviews the staff are great and it is only for them that this hotel can call itself 5 star. 

The place itself falls down on attention to detail you expect when you stay at a 5 star hotel. 

The two rooms we were assigned, ours had a very noisy air condition which in fairness to staff they change us to another room. However my mum and dad was not so lucky. They are in their 70s and kept feeling the cold for the two nights but said nothing to hotel fearing hassle. it was only on the last day that I discovered the window latch in room 319 was broken and the window could not close.

As a five star hotel you would expect that the house staff would have pointed out these defects to management and they would be fixed before guest arrived. Or failing this is they were aware of 319 window not place elderly guest in such a room.

So Druids Glen in my opinion you failed to live up to a five star rating which spoiled our excitement treating mum and dad to such luxury.",2,2012,09,22
238,Great Hotel,"The hotel is very relaxed and the staff are excellent. Food was very tasty. Stayed in a superior room and this was a pleasure.

The pool is nice and if you play golf this resort is ideal.

Would be great if the walks could be developed a bit more to give better access to the fabulous grounds.",4,2012,09,21
238,Awesome golf resrot,"Everything was great at this report, from staff to food. Hotel rooms are well kept and staff was very friendly yet professional. There are two gold courses and both of them, and it's a great place for golfers. For those who are not, you can still enjoy great food (chicken I ate here was DE best chicken ever!) and relax in the very Irish rural landscape. 

 I'd recommend this place to just about anybody.",5,2012,09,20
238,Excellent!,"Cannot fault this hotel; it is one staffed by some of the most professional employees we have come across.  Nothing was a problem to them; they were always smiling and happy and very approachable.  Room was comfortable, clean and a good size.  We dined on both nights of our stay in the restaurant and the food was excellent on all fronts - choice; presentation and fantastic value.  

Our only regret was not bringing our golf clubs to play the courses as the weather was excellent but there is so much to do in County Wicklow!  We will be back soon.  Thank you to all at Druids Glen!",5,2012,09,16
238,Really enjoyable,"I stayed one night here and was very impressed.
The hotel itself is nicely decorated and has a lovely decking area looking over the golf course.
the beds were very comfortable.
I was especially impressed by the breakfast served till 11am and everything you could want and all fresh!
The spa was lovely , I had a facial which was really relaxing and the girls gave us a couple of portions of fresh fruit afterwards as we spent so long in the relaxation room!
I would definitely return.",4,2012,09,15
238,Wonderful wedding at Druids Glen,"I got married in Druids Glen in August and would highly recommend the hotel both to future brides and guests alike.   I couldn't have hoped for a more perfect day.  Their wedding coordinator Nessa is amazing - patient, helpful, efficient - she made the whole build up completely stress free.  As soon as we met her, we knew we were in safe hands.  The day itself was fabulous - beautiful food, decor, atmosphere - just perfect.

For guests, the hotel combines the perfect mix of 5 star service with a relaxed atmosphere.     Many of our guests booked in for several nights (some extending their stay after the first night!).  All commented on the amazing customer service - sadly a rarity in other large hotels.  The numerous seating areas throughout the foyer and bars meant that people could relax and chat without feeling on top of one another.   We really milked the wedding celebrations and had a BBQ the day after the wedding which was superb.  My father has coeliac disease and the chef ensured there were numerous options for him - even down to a specially made fruit salad at my dad's request!  As an example of the customer service, after the first morning the waiting staff remembered his dietary requirements and immediately brought him gluten free bread etc without him having to ask.  It's those little touches that make all the difference.

Now that the wedding is over - i'm just looking for an excuse to return to Druids Glen.  I can definitely see my family booking in for celebrations in the years to come.",5,2012,09,15
238,Lucky with weather,"Part of a group of 8 playing 2 rounds of golf and one overnight stay.Weather great and both golf courses outstanding.
Hotel and accommodation very good. Breakfast first rate. I would highly recommend as a golfing venue.",4,2012,09,14
238,Great stay and play deal,"We paid £109 for B&B plus 2 rounds of golf, Glen and then the Heath. 2 good courses. The Spa area was great, especially the plunge pool. Breakfast was superb, one of the best I've had. The staff couldn't be more helpful and attentive. Well done Druids. ",4,2012,09,14
238,Don't bother...,"Make sure to to check and double-check your reservation upon arrival. 
Bedrooms need renovation, difficult taking a shower as water temperature 
changes constantly.
Poor breakfast, the hot food was cold and the continental breakfast choice is limited.
Check your bill before handing over payment, reception tried to cash in higher
room rate.",2,2012,09,13
238,the augusta of ireland!!,"stayed one night and enjoyed a game of golf on the glen...what a place. now we got a fantastic day weather wise which heightened our experience but the hotel was great. really helpful and pleasant staff, fantastic spacious rooms with sky sports as a bonus!! breakfast was great, buffet with everything u could want. golf course was amazing too. ive played nearly all the top courses in ireland and its right up there. not for the very high handicapper tho...overall a great experience and i will be goin back.",5,2012,09,12
238,Wonderful  retreat outside Dublin,"My family stayed here for 4 nights and we were very pleased with our accomodations. The breakfast was exceptional and if you couldn't something to eat you weren't trying. Wonderful walking/runnimg path around the property just don't walk or run on the main street as they instruct on their walking map,its very dangeous due to the high speed traffic.Be sure to bring your bathing cap if you want to swim in the pool, its required. I would stay away from the spa services, it was not worth the price or the susposed awards they have received for this service.  I have had many, many spa treatments/massages and this was just OK nothing special. Just keep in mind Druids Glen is 40- 60 minutes outside Dublin by car, you can also take a taxi to Greystone to catch the train which is a better option,drving in Dublin can be very challenging.",4,2012,09,10
238,Overall nice - with some drawbacks,"We stayed in Druids Glen resort for 2 nights after the Aug bank holiday weekend in Ireland. Overall this was a nice experience, but I would say that it doesn't quite live up to some of the other 5-star hotels in Ireland. 

The drive up to the hotel is really nice and the surrounding area outside is lovely. Ample parking, but strangely nobody awaiting at the door to take bags, so we didn't set down and carried our bags from the car park. Pleasant reception staff and helpful with information about the surrounding area. 

Our room was quite large although it was a standard room. Two large beds in there. The bathroom was clean but unfortunately I could still be there now trying to get shampoo out of my hair as there was no power at all in the water coming from the shower. 

We had dinner in the bar/lounge, which was quite busy with lots of families and therefore kids running about the place. No worries there and we had the Olympics coverage to keep us occupied! The food was lovely, but I wouldn't rate the service as 5-star. They were pleasant etc but not your standard 5-star service. 
Breakfast in the mornings was a dissappointing affair. First morning we were shown in by a manager who neglected to tell us where to find things, and as there was a section with the buffet that was on a lower tier, we actually didn't know what to do! The food itself was quite dissappointing. There was very very little fresh fruit, and not too many options in the way of cereal. There looked to be a really nice omellette option but having queued for 10 mins I gave up and made do with a few fried eggs. Both mornings made that a dissappointment. It was extremely busy to be fair but they seemed ill equipped to deal with the numbers. In fact at one point i was almost bowled over by a staff member who I had to step aside from. 

But the most dissappointing aspect was the sleep quality. No matter whether it was on the floor above, along the corridor outside, or the staff in the morning, we got very little sleep. We were on a relaxing break away and were pretty shattered by the time we were leaving. The rooms just do not seem sound-proofed in any way at all. It was that there were particularly noisy people at all, just the sound protection was quite poor. 

For any of you who have stayed in Sheen Falls, or Parknasilla in the past then they are streets ahead of Druids Glen.",3,2012,09,10
238,The Druid is magical!,"The setting of the Druid's Glen Resort alone would entice you to pay a return visit. The hotel staff were most attentive and welcoming. Food was prepared to an excellent standard. Bedroom was clean and spacious. The grounds are well maintained and provide opportunity for leisurely walks if you're not there for golf! For those inclined to explore by bike, they were available, rent-free, at the front door. The spa facilities looked very inviting.",4,2012,09,09
238,Great jet lag recovery zone,My wife and I just got back from a 3 week trip to Ireland for golf and basic tourism.  Druids Glen was our first stop from the Dublin airport - the perfect place to kick back a day and then play two great courses before moving on.  The hotel restaurant overlooks the signature 13th hole of the Glen course.,5,2012,09,08
238,Fabulous Location,"I visited Druids Glen recently on a girls' weekend away. The setting is stunning. Greystones is only a short taxi ride away and on the way you can see the amazing views.
The hotel itself is very nice and very well maintained. The staff were available at any moment and could not do enough for us, particularly the lady at the reception desk who checked us in. She was very welcoming and helpful and informed us that we could still make full use of the spa  facilities even after checking out and that the staff could keep our bags behind the desk.

I would certainly come back. It is a charming place and very relaxing. Our room was comfortable though, it was however, a bit too small for four people. 
I would recommend it to friends.",5,2012,09,07
238,"Quiet location, super service, great rooms.","The Druid's Glen is a really lovely hotel. We have stayed here on several occasions.  The facilities especially for children are great, a large swimming pool, games room, child friendly staff and good food make for a great stay! Breakfast is plentiful and waffles made fresh.  Suites offer plenty of room and are large, beds are a good size, toiletries are high end and the whole place is very very clean & quiet. The staff are friendly and efficient.  Gym is good - not massive but has all the right equipment and has never been busy when we have stayed. When we first visited we were not overly impressed with the evening main restaurant menu & service was slow so we have avoided it ever since but have taken afternoon tea in the lounge bar and that was super. Well worth a visit.",5,2012,09,06
238,Well worth a visit,"I visited here in August for a girly weekend with three friends. We all stayed in the one room with two queen size beds and two ""rollaway"" beds. These beds were extremely comfortable. The only slight criticism I would have in relation to them is that they did not leave much room in the actual room itself for four people. The hotel itself is wonderful and in a fabulous location. We found it very good value, especially as breakfast was included, which was delicious. The spa and leisure facilities are amazing. Overall, we enjoyed our visit very much and I would not hesitate to recommend the hotel, particularly to families as the hotel seemed very family oriented. The only criticism I would have (and it is minor, given that it was rectified immediately) is that not much attention was initially paid to the fact that there was four of us staying in the one room eg when we initially arrived in the room, there were only enough towels and bath robes for 2 persons. However, as I noted above, this was rectified once it was brought to the attention of reception. Also, we ordered drinks to the room during the day and were not informed when we initially placed the order that there was a 45 minute wait at that particular time of the day for room service - if we had known that, we would have gone down and gotten them ourselves!!",4,2012,09,05
238,lovely hotel,"We stayed for four nights during August and generally were very pleased with the hotel, and would recommend.Two adults & three children so we took two 'deluxe' doubles. No interconnecting rooms were available , but we got two adjacent to each which were grand. 
Rooms were a good size, although bathroom looked a bit 'worn'. The floor tiles appeared dirty, and initially thought the room hadn't been cleaned. The  housekeeper quickly appeared to explained that the floor was stained rather than dirty, proving it by rubbing with a cloth on her hands and knees!
The facilities are great- pool, and 'den' were very popular with the kids. Mum & daughter checked into the spa which was very relaxing, but a treatments were a bit pricey. 
Boys took to the golf course- we're just beginners but were made very welcome by the golf shop staff who picked a quite time on the course and even lent us some clubs.

Only negatives were the bar and restaurant are very pricey. No entertainment was provided in the bar in the evenings which meant there wasn't much of an atmosphere (the background muzak was dire!).

Lovely part of Ireland to vist-loots to see and Druids is a very comfortable base to stay",4,2012,09,03
238,Excellant start to our holiday,"I stayed for 2 nights in August with my husband and two children aged 10 & 8. We stayed in a very spacious family room. The room was very well furnished & spotlessly clean. We all slept very well with no noise to disturb us. The hotel is child friendly with a fab pool, games room & free bikes to hire!!. The food was terrific. We ate in the dining room on both nights, service was a bit slow on the second night which resulted in my youngest falling asleep at the table!! Breakfasts were great with lots of choice of the beautiful freshest foods. The grounds are great to walk around, enjoy a leisurely drink in or just to look out onto. We really enjoyed our stay here. The staff are very nice, particularly the bar staff who were very friendly. I would recommend to all travellers, beautiful hotel in a lovely location & Very reasonably priced",5,2012,09,03
238,"Nice resort, good quiet location","Beautiful, quiet hotel on a golfing resort.  Hotel restaurants were quite nice, with fresh local fare.  We were in Dublin for the (unfortunate) Navy-Notre Dame football game and stayed out here with a tour group as we had stayed in town for the last game.  We had hoped to get some horseback riding in while we were there, but the timing didn't work out as the local facility was closed on Sunday.  Overall a pleasant stay I would recommend to anyone looking for a quiet place away from the city.",4,2012,09,03
238,Excellent Stay,"In July our son and daughter in law had their Wedding reception in Druids Glen, we spent three nights there, with family and friends.  Our stay was perfect, from the reception staff, the beautiful venue, excellent food, Druids Glen has a very relaxed friendly atmosphere, and nothing is too much trouble for the staff. To be a guest at a Wedding at Druids Glen,is a truly wonderful experience.",5,2012,08,30
238,Our Amazing wedding experience,"I can't say enough about our Wedding we had here in March. Nessa is a gem to work with she is extremely organized and helpful. We live abroad and from the first trip back to do the menu tastings to the days coming up to our wedding we got the best help and service from all members of staff at the Druids Glen.
We had a lot of people traveling in from overseas including ourselves and we've had nothing back but excellent reports on how everything just flowed on the wedding day and the days after for guests who extended their stay and enjoyed the facilities. All the food was served on time and perfectly cooked as requested. Our wine glasses were never left empty by the prompt service of the wait staff. And the plus was that they allowed us to carry over some of the extra evening foods on with us to the residence bar for our late night drinkers! 
we've been to a couple of weddings since our own and we really did get spoilt when we look back at the service and standards we were given.",5,2012,08,29
238,Surprisingly affordable,"Our party of two families ( 4 adults and 4 kids under 10) stayed for two nights in early July and I have only positive things to say, the hotel catered very well for everyone. We received excellent service from the moment we arrived with the colouring in packs for the kids being a nice touch. The (free) programme of sports for the kids was also well received with the kids really enjoying the golf. The kids entertainment room was also well used - sorry for hogging the retro Space Invaders machine - Took me back to being a teenager! 
Kids and adults ate separately and we paid for the babysitting service where Emma was so popular, she was demanded for a second night with the kids refusing their ice cream on the second evening, so they could go and play with her - thanks very much Emma.
For the adults, we had fantastic food in the restaurant the first night and then in the bar the second night where it was good / as expected with the bar prices lower than I had expected for a Five Star hotel with a good selection of wines at E25 per bottle. No trip here would have been complete with some golf where the Glen course provided ample challenge for my limited skills but at least I can talk about the chip on the 18th that rested on the lip of the hole.
Overall, if you're looking for a short break with your family, golfers or not, this is an excellent choice, well located with lots to do in the area and a level of service that means you can relax and enjoy your time there. I will return in the future.",4,2012,08,28
238,If you don't like children not the place for you.,"This is a golf resort favoured by families.Our suite was very comfortable and roomy with gas fire in the sitting room making it very cosy.The staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful.Service was faultless, we asked for a DVD player and reported a broken shower head, both were addressed with in 15 minutes.The Restaurant was OK, sort of good Gastro Pub style but not fine dining.We stayed 4 nights and were running out of things we wanted to eat though I was told about a vegetarian menu on the last night but you would not have known it existed unless you asked for vegetarian food. I am a meat eater but often prefer the VG option.We were only asked if we would like a pre dinner drink on the last night which was a bit odd. The wine list was limited in all senses of the word but then clientele where drinking beer from the bottle at the table so perhaps they do not cater for the discerning wine drinker! You have really got to love children (I don't) to stay here, there were everywhere but worst of all using the corridor outside of our suite as a play ground up to 11.30pm until I went out several times to shut them up. When asked where their parents were the reply was 'In the bar'. These were kids under 10 years and in my opinion should have been tucked up in bed by 9.30pm. At least families ate in a separate dining room at night.The breakfast was excellent with plenty of choices.The Druids Glen golf course was one of the most pretty courses we have played and is quite challenging with lots of water. 
We enjoyed our stay but probably wouldn't stay again. If we did we would  go in term time and probably eat out on some nights.For all that this stay was very good value.We didn't use the Spa or the pool, there is a compulsory cap rule for 'hygiene' reasons. We are both doctors and would like to see the evidence for this. It would make more sense to insist on adult swim nappies if they really are concerned about hygiene! All a nonsense of course since pool chemical neutralise all bacteria. To add insult the room information said caps could be 'purchased' at the Spa.Come on Druids Glen, this rule is utter nonsense and if it isn't I would like to see the evidence that wearing a cap prevents pollution of the water, clearly it is not a hair problem since the pool has a filter and even the bald have to wear a cap!",4,2012,08,28
238,Good family hotel but not very 5 star,"I finally got to visit the hotel thanks to a ""groupon"" offer ( as it's really quite out of the way, for a spur-of-the-moment trek). It was a superb offer of 2 nights b&b for 199 euros but the extras fairly added up in the bar with drinks & meal beverages. The offer also included 50 euro pp credit on the Spa or golf & I was assured I could use this in the restaurant so I didn't book any treatments etc. As anticipated when we got there we couldn't use it for food & the spa was booked. It was very family orientated ( indeed my offer was for 2 adults & 2 children ) with indoor & outdoor play areas. Above the reception ( which has a large atrium ) people were playing table tennis & the ball came over quite regularly !   Staff were very friendly but there was nothing about the experience that would have me return - but the golfers seemed very happy !",4,2012,08,28
238,Wonderful hotel,"I highly recommend this hotel. Everything from the greeting we received at reception when we checked in, to the service, to the atmosphere was truly 5 star. We found a great offer online which made our two night stay great value as well. Eventhough we went there and left our 9 month old son with my mother, we will go back there next year with him as it is exceptionally child friendly.. But they strike the delicate balance of being a 5 star and being a child friendly hotel beautifully. If you fancy a drink their signature cocktail ( I think it was called the Glen) was just yum.",5,2012,08,27
238,5 star prices for a 3 star hotel.,"Firstly i would like to say (nearly all) the staff  are fantastic. Unfortunately the rest of the place does not match them. Spent a weekend there with family members, It's only 5 star until you scratch the surface, It's grubby and dirty in the corners and hard to get at places (check the floor sockets and corners in the conservatory in the main bar, there were insects (dead) that I've only ever seen before on the National Geographic channel). Brekfast is a haphazard buffet affair where you can wait 20 mins for a fresh omelette. Has someone lost he recepie for tea and coffee as it is like coloured water. The toaster does not work correctly (having to make your own toast in a 5 star hotel is a first for me) one pass is not enough & 2 is too much. 
Intermittent hot & cold water in the bedfroom shower. I was making an enquiry at reception when the receptionist answered a phone in the middle of our conversation, waved a finger at me and lft me waiting until she had dealt with the phone call. They couldn't fit a party of 20 at the same table for a celebraion meal (don't they do weddings??). 
I could go on but to summarise before I get angry, there are too many 5 star hotels which deliver what they offer to waste your time & money going to Druids Glen.",3,2012,08,27
238,Druids Glen,We spent a night in the Hotel in August.  It was a very enjoyable night with dinner in the restaurant.  Overall I would recommend the Hotel.  The staff are very friendly and helpful.  The room was excellent.  Overall the hotle is excellent but probably needs some updating to the decor and repairing some minor damages.,4,2012,08,26
238,Not so family friendly..,"No kiddies pool..
""Free"" kiddies buffet absolutely disgraceful. We had to order main courses for ours at €26 each..
No kids entertainment despite what they promise you but we made our own fun.
Wouldn't return.",3,2012,08,24
238,Fantastic Wedding venue,"We held the reception/wedding breakfast for our daughter and her husband at this venue on Saturday 18th Sept. Most of the wedding party and family also stayed overnight in the hotel. 
I could not speak highly enough of the wedding organise Nessa. Everything on the day went like clock work.
The hotel premises, facilites, food (quality and quantity) and the service were top class. The whole event exceeded our already high expectations.
The hotel has two excellent golf courses in the resort Druid's Glen and Heath.
I cannot redommend this hotel highly enough.",5,2012,08,23
238,Great Hotel,Had 3 night stay at this hotel in an executive suite which was excellent and really good value for money.  The Golf was excellent and we were lucky to have sun shine during our stay.  I would recommend the spa as the treatment I had was really relaxing and enjoyable.  We had dinner included in our break and it was good.  Great choice for breakfast also. Lovely cosy bar area and Lounge and all round excellent hotel with very friendly and helpful staff.  Good value for money.,5,2012,08,22
238,Fantastic Hotel for a Wedding,"We stayed at this hotel as we were attending a friend's wedding.  It was absolutely wonderful.  Check in was very efficient and the receptionist was friendly and attentive.  Our room was fantastic... Two double beds, lots of space and a large bathroom. 

The Wedding itself was fantastic.  The food, service and general ambience were out of this world.  All of the waiting staff were professional yet still friendly and helpful.  I cannot praise them enough!

The only slight drawback for me was the breakfast buffet the next morning.  We arrived for breakfast at 10.15 and some items were missing from the hot buffet.  I appreciate it was busy but when you stay in a 5 star hotel, these little things really shouldn't happen.  That said, the items I did eat were hot and very tasty.

I really enjoyed my stay and would happily book this hotel again... I would also highly recommend it as a wedding venue!",4,2012,08,22
238,Excellent Stay,"We stayed here for our 9th wedding anniversary and brought our 5yr old daughter.  We found the staff very friendly couldnt do enough for you. Our daughter was well looked after, from the acitivity pack on arrival, chocolate on her pillow at night she felft very special. They really cater for families but i also noticed at dinner time there is also an area where couples can enjoy their meal away from families.  We had a lovely room overlooking the golf course very peaceful.
We got married here 9 years ago and this was our first trip back. It has changed but for the better, more facilities for families,(playroom, playground, bikes for guests) and the staff are not in a hurry to just serve your food/drinks they will actually have a chat with you. There was a wedding on while we stayed and im jealous of anyone getting married here now. It looked fab very romantic. I didnt get to use the spa so cant comment on that, but i will go back for another stay and try it. Location is also good for touring around southeast and very near to Dublin.",5,2012,08,21
238,Lovely Stay,"Just back from a very enjoyable stay at Druids Glen Resort.
The stay was exactly what my wife and little 2 yo daughter were hoping it would be.

Our room was excellent, the buffet breakfast was first class and I thought the staff were fantastic, very helpful and courteous.

This was an ideal choice for a short family break. The swimming pool was great for enjoying with the family, and the kids playroom and outdoor playground were also very good.

I hope to return again.",5,2012,08,18
238,Lovely Stay,"We are a family of 5 (2 Adults plus 3 kids - 13; 9; 3) who just had a short break (1 night) at Druids Glen. Overall the hotel was lovely and we all had a nice time. Good points was friendliness and helpfullness of staff, DVD players in rooms and great atmosphere in bar area. Some minor negative points relate to pool area being dated, very limited choice of food in Kids buffet and service a bit slow in restaurant. I think an upgrade to the pool area is required including the inclusion of a pool area for small kids. Reception staff were very welcoming and friendly. It might be a good idea to have some computers in the lobby area for teenagers. I needed to use the computer in the business area for 5 mins and felt like I was intruding. Overall, I would recommend and stay again is the price was right. To me its not 5* however. Sorry!",4,2012,08,17
238,Best start,"Having booked this hotel last minute to add an extra 2 nights to the start of our holiday we could not have picked a better hotel to stay at. The location to Dublin is great if you don't like the city life. Well sign posted and ready to find. We checked in quiet late and were greater by a very friendly and attentive Amy, made us very welcome. Room was brilliant. Large and comfy. Breakfast was ok typical hotel breakfast. We Decided to have dinner in the bar which was lovely. I asked got a lemonade and the waiter asked me red or white. Thinking he had miss heard I repeated myself. Realizing I had never heard or tried red lemonade the waiter (anthony) brought me a glass of red to try for free. Brilliant service and guest attention. Would defiantly recommend this hotel and will be returning. The manager should be very proud of their hotel and staff. ",5,2012,08,17
238,Such comfy beds and the best pedicure I've had!,There were 8 of us booked in at this hotel as we got a special deal - husbands for golf and wives the spa. Check in was quick and even though we were early for check in were given rooms straight away. The pedicure at the spa was the best I've had.  Apparently golf was good especially at the championship course. We ordered tea and scones when we first arrived. Food was good once it arrived - a bit slow. Room was very nice.  Beds were extremely comfy. Meal at night was good for most of us although 1 of our steaks was sent back and even on its return was not cooked as requested but they did give us all complimentary tea and coffee because of this. Breakfast was very good with great selection. Swimming pool was nice and warm.  Really enjoyed our stay and would return.,4,2012,08,13
238,Child safety,"Wonderful hotel and superb staff. One small thing, while the outdoor children's playground is excellent and the externally-latched gate is designed to prevent young children opening it from the inside, the private road that runs alongside it (which leads to the Golf Club ?)  could certainly do with a few speed bumps as in the hour and a half we were there with our 3 year old we noticed a number of cars speeding by, ignoring the speed limit signs, and our fear was a young child could run out the gate if someone didn't close it properly, or maybe the child could run out with others when the gate was opened (young children are like lightning when they decide to move). Speed bumps would cost little to install but could advert a tragedy in that spot.",5,2012,08,10
238,A little bit of heaven if it isn't raining!,"I stayed at Druids Glen hotel with 29 others on a golf tour.  Although we arrived early the staff made strenuous efforts to get us into our rooms before we played golf.  My room(single supplement) was ernomous with a huge comfortable bed and a large en-suite with a bath and seperate shower. Throughout our 3 night stay we were all so impressed by the courtesy and helpfulness of all the staff.  The Irish have a wonderful 'no problem' attitude and when coupled with a genuine desire to make you welcome it makes a stay in this hotel a real pleasure.  The food was plentiful and well cooked, the breakfast particularly good and the choice available would not be bettered in a 5 star Central London Hotel.  In short, I have nothing bad to say about this hotel.  We played Druids Heath in drivng rain and high wind which made for a long and tiring day and Druids Glen twice, once in warm sunshine and next day in heavy rain.  That's how golf in Ireland is, the courses were beautifully kept and the Glen deserves the name 'The Augusta of Europe'.  Play these courses if you can, just pray for good weather.",5,2012,08,09
238,Must stay here again!!,"Stayed for only one night but sorry we didn't opt for another.  We were made to feel so welcome by Lubo at reception and nothing was too much for any of the staff attending to us. A particular word of thanks to Duncan for his welcome and special thought for us. The food was fab and we would recommend for anyone to stay here.  Lovely quiet, relaxing hotel, friendly welcoming staff and fab food. What else do you need for a very enjoyable stay here.",5,2012,08,08
238,"Golf great, hotel ok","Just a quick review as I stayed here last year but forgot. I have just returned from carton house though and as I compared it to here thought I should say a few words. 

Hotel is fine. Quite large, clean, food was good, drinks were pricey.

Of the two courses Druids glen is fantastic. Picturesque and challenging. Just a dream to play which you cannot tire of. 

The Heath is links like but to be honest, the greens are just unfair. A golf course should not punish good shots but this one does. 

The hotel a little too far away from civilisation for me. Nice to get away from it all but if your after a golf break with a bit of action other than the hotel there really isn't much around. We were lucky when we were there as Bray festival was on at the town 35 mins away. It broke up the evening but too far away. 

My advice, looking for a golf break with a local town to venture out at night go to carton house. Want to play an amazing golf course and not too bothered about a night in the local bars, stay here. 
",4,2012,08,07
238,Nice hotel but...,"Visited this hotel as part of a large family group in July 2012. The staff were pleasant as they checked us in, but some mistakes had been made regarding the booking. The spa and massage treatments had not been arranged as promised. That was a disappointing start to the trip. The rooms are nice with large bathrooms. Our room was looking into the courtyard - not much of a view, but pleasant enough. Dinner was nice, but nothing special, although they did provide a complimentary bottle of Cava. The beds were comfortable and we had a peaceful nights sleep, as the rooms are located away from the potentially noisy bar area.
Breakfast was a fairly typical buffet affair - with the homemade granola being a standout item.
The location is good for a base to explore the Wicklow mountain area - which is beautiful, but it was disappointing that there weren't nice walks to take around the hotel - the grounds are very plain and although there are activities for children , such as the little playground, the pool and the games room, nothing beats a nice garden for the kids to run around in.
The bar at the hotel is a good one, and pretty busy at times, with tasty bar food.
Lastly, the Druids Glen golf course is superb. Very, very tricky, especially in the wind, but very scenic - which helps to soften the blow of a disappointing score.
Strongly recommended for groups of golfers. Although maybe not so much for family groups with young children.",3,2012,08,06
238,Satisfying Stay,"We stayed in the Druids Glen Resort in July on our return journey from our latest drive around Ireland (1100 miles this time).  We wanted to stay somewhere relaxing in advance of our ferry crossing the following day from Dún Laoghaire. We opted for a deluxe double and this proved to be an excellent choice. The well-equipped, spacious rooms and the comfort of the huge bed ensured that our brief stay was luxurious. We made little use of the many facilities on offer – the renowned golf course, swimming pool, spa or gym, but it was nice to be able to avail ourselves of these should we have wished to do so. We found the staff exceptionally helpful and friendly both on our arrival at check in and throughout our stay. We ate our evening meal in the bar from the reduced a la carte menu and the food was both delicious and reasonably priced.  The service we received from our waitress was exceptional.  We were very impressed by the buffet breakfast - it was excellent. There was a vast array of cereals, fruit, breads, croissants, and a great selection for the ‘Full Irish’ buffet.  It offered a very good choice for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians. We would certainly recommend staying at this hotel and we hope to do so again ourselves.   It was a most satisfying and relaxing end to our travels around the Emerald Isle.",5,2012,08,03
238,Excellent base point for visiting the Wicklow Mountains,"We have stayed five days at the hotel and found it an excellent base point for visiting the Wicklow Mountains. The hotel itself is fantastic and has all the required trumps to make you stay worthwhile: a large (huge!) bedroom, a large, well-equiped bathroom, large parking area, nice swimming pool, friendly staff and hotel manager, etc.

We went twice or three times to the hotel's restaurant and had excellent dinners. We were also very happy with the choice of bar-food available at the bar. The hotel's surroundings are obviously gorgeous with the two golf courts. We are no golf players, but it is clear that the hotel hosts one of the most famous golf courts in Ireland.

I have two minor remarks: the airco was not properly working and the room was pretty hot after returning from sight-seeing in the Wicklow Mountains (note that the outside temperature was around 25° C - end of May 2012). It cooled down during the night, but it was a pitty that we couldn't better control the temperature in the room. Additionally, the shower had some pretty annoying water temperature swings during showering. 

A hotel pretending top notch quality requires perfection in its execution of services. Therefore, although we just loved the hotel, a (severe) 4 star rating.",4,2012,08,03
238,A wonderful birthday surprise,"My husband booked this hotel as a birthday surprise. The hotel was wonderful,  staff were so helpful and pleasant when they heard it was my birthday I was sent a card and chocolates to room.
Evening meal was delicious and there was plenty of choice, cocktails at the bar were excellent.  In the morning the choice for breakfast was fantastic I think they covered everything you could think of from smoked salmon,cheeses, pancakes with strawberries and cream plus all the cooked options and cereals pastries scones the lot.  The setting was peaceful and bicycles are provided if you want to cycle around the grounds",5,2012,08,01
238,Chilled environment - great food!,"Stayed here for a one night break with my partner. The hotel itself is lovely, modern and clean. Since we were only there for one night we headed straight for the pool - which was the only problem we had with the hotel. Not from the point of view of the facilities but more from the number of kids that were there. While all were just having fun (and it was school holidays) I prefer a spa that is adult only.  The plunge pool though is amazing!  The room was big & spacious and the bathroom was also big & clean. Dinner that night was fantastic  - the beetroot tart just has to be tried!  All in all I would definitely recommend the hotel & we will be back!",5,2012,07,31
238,A real Gem in the garden of Ireland,"It’s rare I feel everything in a hotel is working right but I have to say Druids Glen have definitely got it all worked out. We stayed here as part of a wedding party and we have stayed here before as a couples get away and found that the quality both times to be excellent. The grounds are amazing and even before going out of the grounds, we had taken a throve of photos of the hotels landscaping and golf course. The rooms were spacious and comfortable and had big super king comfortable beds which you can just never get as comfortable at home. The room was immaculately clean and so was the rest of the hotel. The staff was prompt at check-in and check-out and we found no problems with anything. The staff we also very accommodating to both us as a couple and the reviews by the bride and groom we ones most hotels would covet. Their every need was covered and the staff was bending over backwards even though as you would expect at a wedding some speeches ran a little (an hour) over so dinner was a little delayed. I should also add, even though they were cooking food for just under 200, nothing was dry, the beef was falling of the fork it was so soft and anything that you wanted the staff were jumping up and down to take care of. 
As a food person we of course had to sample the food in the bar too and found the quality to be just as good and more reasonably priced on out second night. And they have a great Patio/BBQ area beside the bar where we sat for an while without any complaint from the staff in the rain. I have to say that I wanted to try the golf course but I didn’t get a chance, but I think it may cause another visit in the future.",5,2012,07,31
238,A Wonderful Experience,"I have just returned after an amazing 2 day stay in Druids Glen.  I have never been so relaxed in my life!!!
The food was amazing.....exactly what you expect from a 5star resort.  The spa was a particular  favourite if mine :) I had 2 brilliant treatments which left my chilled and wanting never to leave.
The staff could not be more helpful.  From the moment we checked in everyone was so helpful and went out of their way to make us feel at home. A special word of thanks to Sunny in the bar as he went above and beyond!
A great base to explore Wicklow from, my only complaint is that I couldn't stay longer!",5,2012,07,27
238,Druids Return,"This hotel proved to be very family orientated with first class facilities and excellent staff,good value leisure breaks to suit everyone.
Although we didn't take advantage of the highly rated golf course the location and grounds were out of this world.I would also like to pay the highest compliment to the hotel receptionist who checked us in and the one who checked us out.",5,2012,07,27
238,"great staff, great amenties, very relaxing hotel","highly recommended hotel, staff lovely very friendly, fab food and great kids playroom and playground. lovely country location very peaceful. lovely spa pool and golf courses. would love to stay longer real home from home.good children activites",4,2012,07,26
238,Great stay!!,"Fab 2 nights stay, very reasonable and wonderful surroundings, walks, spa, swimming pool, rooms. food - every thing!!!  Will definately be back.  Great location as well as there are loads to see and do in the area :)",5,2012,07,26
238,Relaxed surroundings,"This is a very nice and pleasant hotel. Grounds are vey pretty rooms ar eto high spec. The bar food is a bit expensive for everyday regular dishes,  but they have nice cocktails ! Good service form reception.",4,2012,07,26
238,Exceptional support provided by exceptional team,Quality facilities and service delivered by an exceptional team during a recent conference held at Druid's Glen. All expectations of our business requirements were exceeded and this was supported by the feedback from delegates attending the event. Every member of our event team echoed the praise for the hospitality afforded to us on the day. Certain to be back!,5,2012,07,26
238,d214ever,"Irish hospitality at its best, from the moment you enter the hotel.  The team in the hotel go the extra mile to attend to your every request. The food is totally exquisite all be it a tad calorific  :-( but hey that what a spa hotel is all about.",5,2012,07,23
238,Breakfast buffet worth the stay,"We stay at the Druids Glen resort once or twice a year. It was originally a Marriott and furnished with great Marriott beds and linens. The rooms are exceptionally large for hotels in Europe and in general for Ireland. There is free wifi for guests throughout. The spa is fabulous and the pool is exceptionally large and a great workout. Clean and well mantained. Air condition and climate control in the rooms is excellent. I love the fireplace in the lobby and it is a lovely place to sit and read late at night while partner or kids sleep. A+ for the breakfast buffet which goes until 10.30-11 am and is exceptional. There is no breakfast food neglected, hot chafers full of irish breakfast items and a chef who make pancakes and waffles and omelettes. 
It is 30 minutes from Dublin proper but we go for the golf and scenery around the gorgeous Wicklow area. Great for family with kids, golfers, and just relaxing. No city noise, lovely.",4,2012,07,22
238,Fabulous Stay,"What can I say about this place, well its located in a beautiful country setting but yet very close to the motorway so its easily accessible. I went there with my wife & 2 daughters aged 9 & 12. The staff are friendly and helpful without fault, something which the hotel obviously prides itself on. Peter Montemayor in the restaurant deserves special mention! The kids hit the pool every day which was clean if a little bit small. We actually had to queue one of the days as it had reached capacity. The changing area is clean but also very small and quite cramped. We used the bikes and the kids got golf lessons from the 2 lads in the golf shop which they loved!! They also provided our room with a dvd player so the kids had a movie each night going to bed which was lovely. The room was fine as was the bathroom but the decor is dated and the beds were not doubles as stated which made sleeping a small bit uncomfortable. I have stayed at the Solis Lough Eske in Donegal (also 5 star) and the standard of room, bathroom and leisure centre was far superior there. There was certainly more of a wow factor in the Solis. But the Druidsglen did have its own wow factor..... the food!! It was divine, heavenly, words fail me. We had breakfast, dinner nd also the special lunch. All brilliant, a vast variety of well prepared foods leaving us stuffed every night going to bed. So to cap, brilliant food, brilliant staff, brilliant location but maybe not in the same league as the ""Solis Lough Eske"". But I will def recommend it to friends and I may return again!!",4,2012,07,22
238,"Perfect, as it should be","This is everything a hotel should be. Excellent service, accommodation, good food and a relaxing athmosphere.",5,2012,07,22
238,Relaxation & Fantastic Food at it's best!,"We have just spent a 5-night break in the Druid's Glen Resort (2 Adults, 2 Children) and we were very impressed overall with our stay which was good value for 'rip-off Ireland' - a pleasant change! I availed of 2 Spa treatments which were excellent; my husband enjoyed an hour at the driving range and both our daughters received a personal one-to-one golf lesson. We also availed of the free bikes for a nice cycle around the grounds. The girls were delighted with their DVD player which was set up in our room and chose from a modern range of DVDs. There was a choice of either an outdoor or indoor play area also. The highlight of our stay was the friendliness of all staff members. both at reception and in the restaurant/bar areas AND the fabulous food! Staff could not do enough for us and operated in a very professional manner at all times. The food in the restaurant was out of this world and the children's meal choices were excellent eg Shepard's Pie, Pasta dishes, Chicken etc - a lovely change from the usual chips/sausage/nuggets-only option in most hotels. We would definitely go back again. The only downside was the weak shower in our accommodation and the beds were smaller than doubles which led to poor quality sleep when sharing. Breakfasts were of excellent standard also - the pancakes made to order is a nice touch for kiddies. Thank you.",5,2012,07,22
238,Slow Refunds,"We stayed at the resort for one night.The facilities and food were fine however I was not at all happy with the way my account was handled.
I said I was going to pay by cash however reception insisted that I have my credit card swiped for the room rate + 50 Euro a total of 200 euro.
I paid by cash next day on leaving.
I now find almost 10 days later my credit card has a block of 200euro which I cannot get released.
The Hotel say it's the Banks problem the Bank say it's the Hotels problem.
I had to cut my break short as my credit card would not work with the Hotel blocking out a substantial amount of Money which I had earmarked for our next stop.
This is totally unsatisfactory and certainly spoiled our first visit to this Resort.
in this day of modern technology surely there has to be a swifter way to sort out matters like this.",3,2012,07,22
238,"A Fine Stay - Very Functional, Not Super Luxurious","We stayed at Druids Glen for business and enjoyed exceptional service and great facilities. The meals were great and the staff in the pub is fun and attentive. The Druids Heath golf course is outstanding.  It would be hard to complain about anything other than the slightly plain rooms and decor which are perfectly functional but not luxurious. For a US comparison, it is the standard of a nice Residence Inn, clean and comfortable. ",4,2012,07,20
238,Hotel in Wonderful Wicklow,"I spent a wonderful weekend at Druids Glen, and would highly recommend staying here. We were upgraded to a suite and it was one of the best rooms I've stayed in. What makes this place is the staff. They are so warm and friendly and will go out of their way to help you. The restaurant is wonderful, and has a great array of dished on offer. The breakfast buffet is amazing, with almost every breakfast item you can imagine. The bar is a great place to spend an evening, and at weekends there is entertainment on offer, in the form of a live singer who got people dancing and signing along.
The spa is wonderful, I had a fantastic massage which left me relaxed for the rest of the week. My friend had a facial and enjoyed it just as much, and we spent a while relaxing at the spa before heading back to our rooms. Although we are not golf fans, the hotel have free bicycles you can borrow, and we had a wonderful afternoon seeing the grounds. This is a wonderful base to explore the beautiful county of Wicklow.",5,2012,07,19
238,Only for Golfers,"The main picture of the hotel is not the hotel.  It is a modern building which could anywhere in the world.  Room we stayed in had no view and was dull and characterless.  Meal in evening not much choose and puddings looked manufactured rather than made by cook - not tempting.  Lovely Golf course, but not for walkers so forget beautiful grounds. If you like suburbia hotel this is for you as good as most airport hotels bar for the Golfers.",3,2012,07,18
238,Definitely not 5 star!," Food and service was of a very high standard , we enjoyed the barbecue on the Fri eve and our dinner on the Sat eve was just amazing. Waiting staff were genuinely pleasant and helpful as were the girls st the front desk. However, we were very disappointed with the accommodation. Our room was basic, there were two beds in our room, not standard doubles quite small.  Shower pressure was poor and I thought the toiletries disappointing, I would expect possibly moulton and brown or some similar brand in a 5 star hotel. ",3,2012,07,13
238,Very child friendly 5 star hotel,"My husband, myself and our two daughters (aged 4 and nearly 2) spent a night in Druids Glen.  On arrival, the girls were given a pack containing colouring in books and crayons - a lovely start to our stay!  Our room was very near the main reception area which was excellent with children - as trips back and forward to the room were needed to get dummies, coats etc.  The room itself was very spacious and bright, with excellent bathroom facilities and comfortable beds.  Dressing gowns and slippers were also provided.
The hotel is so child friendly - they had sports/games on at 2pm.  Donna, a fitness instructor from the leisure area organised a little football game and made daisy chains with the younger girls.  There is also an indoor play room which the children all seemed to love and an outdoor park - very safe.
We also used to pool and jacuzzi twice during our stay. This area is brilliant and spotlessly clean.
Our package included a pre dinner cocktail and dinner in the restaurant.  This was amazing.  The children had a buffet to choose from and could eat before we had our meals.  Our meal was delicious - really wonderful food.  Only gripe, it was abit slow coming out - we spent two hours having three courses but our girls coloured in and stuck it out at the table!!(this was where the nearby room was handy!)  Breakfast was again amazing - everything you could imagine to choose from and served in the beautiful, bright setting.
Our package also included tickets to Glenroe Farm which is a short drive away and which the children loved as there was a big park there too.
Overall, this is a really fine 5 star hotel, very, very child friendly and we will return again.",5,2012,07,13
238,Rural haven,"My wife, myself and two friends have just returned from a three night break in the Druids Glen Resort. On arrival at the hotel, we were most impressed by the beautiful Wicklow countryside and the attractive rural setting of the Resort. The Reception staff were welcoming and our two bedrooms, which overlooked the golf course, were large and well equipped with excellent bathroom facilities and luxurious beds. We made our way to the Thirteenth Bar for a snack lunch and ordered some toasted sandwiches. Unfortunately, these were not the best part of the eating experience - tepid, sparce fillings in toasted bread which had become rubbery. We hoped that this was not a foretaste of things to come! The evening meal (part of our deal) in the Brasserie was, in fact, exceptionally good. The waiter service was highly efficient and the food beautifully cooked and presented.This was also the case on the second night. The dining room was very attractive with church candles lit to add to the already inviting ambiance. The menu on both evenings was the same and this looked as though it might remain so for some time. Had we been staying for a week, it might not have suited us, as the selection, although imaginative, was limited. Breakfast was a treat with just about everything available which one might require. There was a mouth-watering assortment of cereals and breads (homemade granola, and tasty Guinness bread not to be missed!) and a substantial choice of hot dishes, omelettes and pancakes cooked on request. Fresh fruit provided an enticing addition to the buffet. Our third evening meal was taken in the Bar and, although adequate, was perhaps a little disappointing since the Brasserie standards were so high. The Bar food tended to be expensive. On one of the mornings, we used the walking/jogging track to exercise before breakfast. This was a pleasant and scenic route through the beautiful grounds and golf course. It was, however, poorly signposted and resulted in our being temporarily lost and having to ask directions to the hotel! We did not avail ourselves of the pool or spa areas, but they appeared to be well organised. The lobby of the hotel was furnished with comfortable settees grouped around fireplaces, all adding to a most relaxed stay. Our daughter had telephoned Druids Glen and had arranged afternoon tea for us which we decided to have on our final day. This proved to be delicious and could be recommended. Overall, we had a delightful three day stay and would most certainly return to this excellent hotel.",5,2012,07,11
238,Kick back and Relax,Only stayed here two nights but found the atmosphere so comfortable and relaxing. If you want to be near the hustle and bustle of a city this is not the place for you. The resort offers  beautiful landscaped grounds and a golf course. The interior of the resort has so many nice areas to kick back and catch up on a good read or enjoy a special glass of wine. The food was very good and service as well! The rooms were very comfortable with plenty of space - would highly reccomend the Druids Glen Resort!,4,2012,07,09
238,Are they bovered?!,"Lovely hotel.. Nice Room ( little bit tired but not too bad). Fabulous bed ( Marriott style- soooo comfortable).  Very good food. The bar staff are nice but the waiters and male receptionist were not friendly, not helpful and obviously not happy..  A pity..",4,2012,07,09
238,Quiet Location,"This hotel is in a quiet location of Co Wicklow. The hotel is nocely laid out and the staff are friendly and helpful. We attended a wedding here and the food was really very good. 
The only disappointing thing was the breakfast wasnt very warm at all, it is laid out buffet style and everything is only barely warm. You have to make the toast youself, which is not really toast but just hot floppy bread. The coffee was very good.
The bed was extremely comfortable.",4,2012,07,08
238,Very enjoyable stay,"I had heard great things about it and was not disappointed. Overall from the staff, to our room to dinner dinner in the Brasserie it was amazing. The next morning – the breakfast offered lots of choice  with plentiful supply of cereals, fresh fruit, cold meats , breads, hot food etc to cater to everyone’s needs. Afterwards we went to the pool which is quiet small, one lane was denoted to swimming lessons for kids and one lane for regular swimming but it was quiet narrow so didn’t spend too much time swimming in the pool. Overall came away from my night there thoroughly relaxed felt like I’d been away for a week rather than one night.",5,2012,07,04
238,"Great family experience , excellent service and there is usually discounted deals which makes it great value for money.",We have stayed here several times and each time it had been a very enjoyable experience. It seems to be very popular spot for families. The rooms are in keeping with 5 star status as are the leisure facilities. Food is excellent if not a little expensive. Whilst in a secluded location it is easy to locate and just off the main road south from Dublin. Good location base to explore the surrounding area and visit Avoca. Overall well worth a visit. ,5,2012,07,02
238,unforgettable family weekend!!,"Just back from a family weekend at druids glen. It was our first family weekend away with our 16mth old son and I have to send a huge thank you to the staff of druids glen for being so helpfull and kind during our stay. On our arrival we were handed a colouring set to keep my son amused in his room. That night we had dinner in the stunning brasserie lounge and to make our meal more comfortable a very friendly waitress called JO (whom calum adopted as his nanny for the night and kept calling her throughout the meal) brought over a dvd player set it up on our table and played mickey mouse for him. We were very moved by this as we sat and enjoyed our fab food  calum was happy laughing and dancing to mickey mouse. We all relaxed in the pool then it was off to kiddi play room and calum could let loose and run around to his hearts content. We are planning our next weekend break away already and look forward to our next stay at druids glen we'll be back or def and totally recommend it!!!                                       Keith, michelle & calum Reddy",5,2012,07,01
238,Good Golf Resort,"Just back from a ""two day stay and play"" at Druids Glen. The staff are very amicable and extremely helpful.

 As usual played so much golf I had no time to investigate The Spa or the Pool area! The room was fine but I was a little dissapointed as I expected a little more elegance and attention to detail re cleanliness (ie behind the bathroom door near the shower had not been mopped and I could see evidence of ground in dirt)  I also hate slow draining wash hand basins ( caused by the type of plug that had been installed)

The breakfast buffet was plentiful and a lot of it was excellent. The young chef who was in attendance was very attentive and very efficient.

We had dinner in the brasserie on one eveing and i must say that I could not find fault with one thing! It was absolutely excellent! The passionfruit and orange tart was divine!",4,2012,06,29
238,A wonderful stay from start to finish,"On arrival, we were greeted & welcomed by Adrienne, who has got to be the nicest receptionist to greet us in any hotel we've ever stayed at. 
Once she found out we weren't long back of our honeymoon, we were sent complimentary drinks to enjoy in the comfort of our suite.
The decor was of muted tones with plenty of natural light. The suite was spacious, comfortable with all the facilities required.

The gym was well appointed, with all you need for that holiday workout, though I didn't get time to visit the pool.

We had dinner in the restaurant, after being looked after so well by the lovely Meg, and eating from the menu inspired by Catherine Fulvio, we didn't want to leave! The duck salad is wonderful to begin with, light but so many taste combinations! The teriyaki salmon almost beat it for main course. 

Breakfast was served in our room & again, service & food was faultless! Please take note of reviews on here to try the porridge, not won't be disappointed!

From the outset, staff were polite, helpful & nothing was inconvenient for them.
The quiet setting is wonderful & perfect for anyone who just wants to switch off & relax.

We will be back without a doubt!

238,Take a Bow Druids Glen Resort!!,"My husband, daughter and friend stayed here for 3 nights from 11th June. Amy in Reception booked us into a lovely room with a view of the Golf Course which suited me down to the ground.Thank you Amy! From the moment we arrived we were treated like valued guests and this hotel is lovely.Room was brilliant and spacious with a fab view. Druids Glen heath Golf course was challenging but very well kept with beautiful views. Kids took out the ""free"" bicycles for a lovely trip around the resort and had a ball. 
dvd player and dvd's were free for our room for the duration of our trip. Staff were so pleasant and helpful  - from the Bar Staff to the Dining room staff - all were to be congratulated on their brilliant service. Breakfast was heaven with a unbelievable choice for everyone. Location perfect for the family break, We wlll be back!!",5,2012,06,26
238,Top Class Hotel,"stayed here last weekend for anniversary for 2 nights,1st the location is stunning 2 world class golf courses,Druids Heath,Druids Glen.rival some of the best in the world.if you like breakfast this place is for you,best spread i ever seen in any hotel,dinner could be a bit better,rooms 1st class,overall hotel very clean,kids playroom could be a bit bigger.will return again and play Druids Glen (fully booked when i was there)",5,2012,06,25
238,Over Rated,"Just back from a visit to the hotel which I had booked as a special treat, a 2 night golf package.
Beautiful setting in the Wicklow countryside. Receptionist was pleasant & helpfull & explained aspects pertaining to the hotel. The 'roaring fires' throughout the hotel were not in evidence, merely a measly flame from a gas fires in the reception area & sunken lounge, the one in the Alpine lounge wasn't lit.
Our bedroom was a considerable walk from reception. The room spacious, very comfortable bed, overall impressiion, a tad dated. Described in the brochure as 'luxurious with every modern luxury'. No toilet brush! Description overstated overstated. An annoying aspect, the safe is located in the wardrobe immediately behind the bedroom door & when trying to get into the safe the wardrobe door only opened 1/2 way becauase of the door closure.
Our impression was the hotel was not in it's 1st flush of youth. It needs updated & cleaned. The windows & shelves on the 3rd floor of the Spa were filthy as were the glass shelves of the Thirteenth bar
Ate both nights in the hotel and the food was nothing wonderful, certainly not presented in the style indicated either on the website or brochure or for what you would expect in a 5* hotel. On the 1st night, after being shown to our table, our waitress asked if we would like still or sparkling water. We stated our preferences & were subsequently provided with a bottle of each. It was not until our bill was presented thatwe realised that this was not free. At the outset we not offered any other options. Poor practice. The food was tasty but I have had better for less cost in bistro type restuarants in Belfast. On the 2nd night the soup of the day was no better than a tinned soup & the side dish to accompany the main course chosen, shredded cabbage & onions. I ask you. What would this embelish?
As for the breakfast buffet, this was nothing spectacular.The Irish breakfast option was, to say the least, extremely disappointing. The food was just on the side of warm, had to wait for the chef to appear to 'cook' some fried eggs for me. He offered me 2 fried eggs. I refused these immediately as the whites were only partially cooked & still clear, I don't eat raw eggs. By the time I had waited for these my other items were becoming cold so gave up & had toast. Overall the service in the restaurant was average. I would hate to see them busy.
5 Star standard. I don't think so. I have stayed in better 3 & 4 star hotels. As for the golf, the staff in the golf shop for Druids Heath were not particularly pleasant. The bunkers, of which are plenty are rock solid & again need attention. I was not surprised that they have achieved a 4* Trip Advisor rating which was 'proudly' displayed in the reception area.
Will we go back. No. Too many other 4 star hotels of it's kind which are superior.",3,2012,06,22
238,Golf course is 5star. Not the hotel,"5 star golf course (we don't play  golf)but hotel is definitely not 5 star standards. Staff are really friendly,the rooms are very basic and are more 4star. Could do with being updated very bare and unwelcoming.",3,2012,06,22
238,Great customer service,"We stayed here for two nights for a wedding. The staff really are excellent and went out of their way to be helpful. Although the decor of the room was slightly dated, the room facilities were excellent. There is a nice atmosphere and the decking area is a lovely place to sit with a coffee. My one gripe with the hotel would be the food, the breakfast was nice but the food in the bar was terrible. I got seafood chowder and it was so salty it was nearly indedible, and was minus any seafood. There was a large group of us and all of us were disappointed with our food. The sauna, jacuzzi etc were lovely and well maintained. Overall a good stay, we may just have been unlucky with the food on that day.",4,2012,06,20
238,Just Wonderful,"The Druids Glen Resort is reliably good as we have stayed here on three previous occasions and every time has been great.  This is the place to be when visiting Wicklow 'The Garden of Ireland'.  The setting is amazing and the views are stunning.  It is peaceful, calm and relaxing.  Swimming pool, spa, and treatments just add to this.  The staff are very helpful and friendly.   From the moment you arrive you are made to feel welcome.  Of note is the Receptionist lady called Adrienne who is outstanding at her job.  She is welcoming, warm, helpful, seems genuinely interested in her guests, a real asset to the resort.  Nothing is too much trouble.  All hotels and resorts need an Adrienne.  The room sizes are all large or better and some have balconies.  They have a number of various sized bikes for guests including children to use.  They have recently put in a children's play area which is a great addition.  The gardens are beautiful and the golf courses are immaculate.  There is something for everyone here.  We are all on specific diets including Gluten Free and the staff sorted it out easily.  The range of breakfast foods is just fantastic.  It is just left for me to say that, we will be back soon.",5,2012,06,20
238,Nice stay,"We booked one night stay as part of a package which included dinner and breakfast. We booked it for a special occassion. The Hotel grounds are lovely and well kept. The hotel provides bikes so you can cycle around the grounds and take in the scenery. Upon arrival we were greeted by a lovely lady at reception who informed us where everything was in the hotel and directed us to our rooms. She was very welcoming and friendly. We decided to have lunch in the bar area, the lunch menu does not have a huge selection but the food was very nice especially the lemon scones they were delicious! 

The rooms are very spacious and the beds are very comfortable. To pass some time before dinner we used the pool area which is nice they have a jacuzzi, steam room and sauna (sauna was not working during our stay). Dinner was very nice and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. After dinner we sat in the bar for a few drinks and enjoyed the entertainment. The guy playing the guitar was brilliant we really enjoyed listening to him and it gave a lift to the atmosphere as without the music it would have been very quiet. As soon as he start playing the bar began to fill up he was so good. Overall we had a lovely stay although i think the hotel is more of a four star than five star but again we had no complaints and enjoyed our stay.",4,2012,06,18
238,Fantastic Hotel,"This was our first visit to Ireland. From arriving to leaving 4 days later we could not have had better service. The room was spacious modern and eveything you would expect from a 5* hotel. We had a package deal which included two evening meals which were excellent value good food well cooked. The staff are a credit to the hotel .
Breakfasts were excellent you had a large choice from buffet style to full Irish breakfast and as a special treat the chef would make you fresh pancakes. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is visiting the area. We would not hesitate to stay here again.",5,2012,06,15
238,The staff make the difference,"Druids Glen resort is a fantastic hotel with all the modern amenities you might expect from such a  resort. The facilities are excellent, pool, spa . gym, etc.... The food is simply first rate, whether you choose a relaxing bar snack or more formal dining in the restaurant - we did both and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The rooms are large, comfortable and very clean. Complimentary mineral water always replaced. The hotel is in a wonderful setting, in the middle of delightful countryside - ideal to get away from it all. We dont play golf, but the courses just looked superb, and there is a great walking / jogging tack around the whole resort for some exercise. It is also well appointed to take advantage of the sites of the east coast of Ireland.

But it is the staff that make the difference - whether reception, management, serving & bar staff or even cleaning staff. All go out of their way to make you feel welcome and nothing is too much trouble. You want a sweet that's not on the menu - we'll take care of that - you want a course from the restaurant menu in the bar - no problem. My wife left a pair of shoes in the lounge and as she realised this, the barman was already on the way up to our room with them.  Friendly, helpful and pleasant to chat with. Make a real difference to the experience.",5,2012,06,15
238,Fantastic Service,"There for 3 nights on golfing trip (the courses are excellent by the way - especially the Glen itself which was magnificent despite the wet weather). 

Rooms good with comfy beds, decent TV etc. If I'm being picky, did find it strange that the shower was so small and wonder if it was just me who had water pressure issues?

However, public areas are really good and staff all round brilliant from reception through to drivers, golf shop, bar and restaurant. Breakfast excellent quality + choice and also ate dinner one night which was good value for quality of cooking. Bar has better atmosphere than you normally get at resorts and was busy throughout. 

Sure if you want the buzz of the Dublin nightlife then probably stay closer (it's about 30-40 mins to the centre) but it's a great place enhanced by really good quality service. We'll be back.",5,2012,06,13
238,Lovely resort,"OK, only spent one night here but was very impressed. Reception staff very friendly and helpful - organised breakfast bags for us for early morning as we were up and out before the restaurant opened. The room was lovely - spacious, modern, great flatscreen TV, free wifi, luxury bathroom. Would love to have been able to have stayed for longer and had time to sample the leisure facilities.",5,2012,06,11
238,Even in bad weather,"just spent 4 days and 3 nights with 11 mates at the resort. Could not have chosen a better place for 4 days of golf, on contrasting courses each day. Very comfortable, superb beds...vital...very cheery and pleasant staff.  Offered club drying room after rain along with cool guinnes in a good bar. Huge breakfast available, and half of us used the spa to restore tired legs.  Would definately return.  Dirt Diggers vs City Slickers.",4,2012,06,11
238,very welcoming staff,"very welcoming and friendly staff, reception and service is outstanding. Spacious rooms, very quiet place.  Taxi to nearby town, golf daytrips or a visit to Dublin for a very good price. Restaurant and Brasserie is good.",5,2012,06,10
238,One of the best stays I've had,"This hotel has it all. Great location in Wicklow, a golf course to die for and comfort second to none. The food in the restaurant was the best I've tasted.....even the breakfast was a feast. Rooms are comfortable and spacious but nothing special. Hera08 said it should be a 4 star maybe I don't know but it is head a shoulders over any 4 star I've stayed in.",5,2012,06,03
238,Lovely place but should be described as a 4 star.,"A bit tricky to find but AA route planner gave us perfect directions, just make sure to follow the resort sign not the golf club sign.  First impressions, it was nice, car park opposite the entrance, but the big welcome smile from the concierge made it so relaxing and really set the tone of our stay.  We were early and we were offered a room facing the front (the car park) or we could wait an hour for one facing the golf course.  Pick the golf course side, it's much nicer.  We waited out on the veranda which was lovely and relaxing and had a light lunch.  Our room was 203 with a little balcony, tiny in fact, but it was a lovely room.  Spacious with a nice bathroom (with a bath and shower).  The staff are definitely the plus to this hotel. They are very helpful and friendly.  We went on the little walk or trail as they call it, from the resort to the golf club, nothing to look at really, the nicest part was the driveway to the golf club.  The old house was nice to look around and there was a roof top area where you got a 360 view from.  We were tired from our walk (2km) and it was hot so the concierge very kindly picked us up.  When we got to our room, our prosecco and  chocolate dipped strawberries were waiting for us as we had gone with the pigsback mega deal.  It was such a welcome treat. My husband tried out the pool and sauna and loved the plunge pool part. I didn't venture into the spa as it was overpriced. We went out visiting friends and came back to late for dinner and ordered sandwiches to our room. They were basic and very expensive for what you got.  This is really where the extra star gets lost, the quality of food is very poor.  The breakfast consisted of tinned fruit not fresh, apart from the grapes.  The OJ was concentrated and not good quality.  The ingredients are poor quality and the cheapest of the cheap.  The tea, the bread, the watery eggs, it's a let down. But in saying that, we didn't try dinner, which was very expensive too.  Apart from the food, we did really enjoy our stay.  So if you're not after silver service, turn down service or high quality cuisine, then this really is a lovely place to stay and I would recommend it, They have great deals and it is in a lovely part of the country.",4,2012,05,31
238,Another Lovely Stay,"Another lovely stay in Druids Glen. 

Check in was efficient and the upgrade to a suite was a nice addition to a relaxing overnight away from the norm. Lots of towels, huge bed and proper blackout curtains. There was even a putting set in the room which my boyfriend enjoyed! Nice toiletries and candles in the room. Perppermint tea in the room - always a bonus for a herbal tea drinker.

Dinner - a good range of very flavoursome dishes. All the wait staff were very pleasant - thankfully a large group came in as we were finished our main course so the small wait between course was a welcome time to relax and digest!

The hotel also had a BBQ on Friday - all the food going out looked lovely and it think it was only €24

The leisure centre is very clean and again well staffed - plenty of towels.The pool area is nice and bright with all the usual amenities- didnt use the gym so cant comment. We had an early morning swim on Saturday and the guy on reception mentioned to us there was swimming classes on; I thought this would mean a lot of noise but there were 5 lil tots having a lesson with there instructor in the water with them - not a peep out of any of them and you'd bearly notice they were there!

Breakfast again was a nice meal - the restaurant was very busy but the food was replenished often. Great choice of food. We took our papers and orange juice on to the deck to enjoy the sun. There was a great atmosphere among other guests - a combination of the good weather and full bellies I assume!

Used the Spa on two previous visits - Both treatments were very good, the relaxation room is exactly what is says on the tin. Usually good value for the excellent service you receive, esp with special offers

Would recommend this hotel - a nice treat!",5,2012,05,30
238,Top Class,We spent two nights in this lovely hotel. The staff were super and could not do enough for you. The room was a good size and the bed was very comfortable. The first night we had bar food. There was not a big selection but what we got was nice and well priced. The second night we had dinner in the dining room it was part of our package and this was very good quality. I had the duck and my friend had fish overall a lovely experience with some nice wine. The leisure center was not very modern but was still ok. They have lots of good offers so overall I would return.,4,2012,05,29
238,Friendliest and Best Staff ever encountered!!,"Stayed in hotel for the weekend.  Satff were the most helpful and friendly I have experienced anywhere.  We had a fantastic meal in the restaurant, rooms were comfortable and spacious.  Would definitely recommend.",5,2012,05,28
238,Nice but not 5 star,"Stayed here recently for a wedding, all the staff we dealt with were friendly and helpful so no complaints there. Check-in was quick and efficient, however when we got to our room we were disappointed. As per other reviews the rooms are very dated and not 5 star, have stayed in plenty of nicer 4 star. They were clean and tidy but just very dated, also as our room was on the ground floor there was no view except of other parts of the hotel. As we had been told by other guests attending the wedding at check-in the hotel was fully booked we didn't look to get moved as we would normally do if a room was not upto our expected standards.
All aspects of the service for the wedding were great too. Only other slight complaint was at breakfast the next morning,  after been shown to a table we were left alone no staff came over to see if we had everything and after a few minutes we had to go find our own coffee. Again I would expect more for a 5 star",4,2012,05,27
238,Brilliant weekend getaway,"Located close to Dublin and with two great golf courses and a lovely spa this is a great destination for a weekend getaway. The rooms are modern and spacious, and the staff are fantastic.",5,2012,05,26
238,Midweek Getaway,"Stayed here on a midweek getaway in March and I absolutely loved the Hotel. The staff are super friendly and always willing to help with a friendly smile on every occasion. The Spa was great with a choice between Pool, Steam Room, Sauna and Jacuzzi. Just dont forget your swimming caps for the pool ;) Breakfast was all you can eat buffet with a selection from Full Irish to fresh pancakes made to order with all the cereals, fruit and bread you could ask for. Its within half an hour of Glendalough and the Sally Gap with Superb scenery all around and Glenroe farm close by too, just check the opening dates of the local attractions you want to visit as we travelled in March and quite a few attractions were still closed to tourists. Would definately stay again and I cannot recommend the area highly enough. Thoroughly enjoyed my stay",5,2012,05,24
238,Golf weekend,"I stayed with a golf group of 28 adults for 2nights, 3 rounds of golf and an evening meal.  Value for money excellent - absolutely stunning golf courses (especially The Glen) - staff in the golf clubhouse and in the hotel were very friendly and helpful.  Food was of very high standard (especially he lamb!) and bar/restaurant prices were better than expected.

I would recommend this venue for any group of golfers looking for challenging golf with extremely comfortable accommodation and top quality food.

When can I go again?

238,Beautiful Resort,"Just returned from a wonderful trip to Ireland and London.  As part of our trip - we spent 2 nights at Druids Glen Resort and found it to be just beautiful.  We had a 2 room suite - which included a fire place and small living room.  The bathroom was very large by European standards and included a walk in closet.  We had a set of double doors in the bedroom that opened to a wonderful view of the golf course.  Only wish their was a small patio to sit on.  

My husband played golf on Druids Heath and very much enjoyed it; however, the Druids Glen course looked amazing.  We snuck onto the course one night to check out some of the holes and it was just magnificent.  Will definitely play next time we visit.   

The breakfast each morning was very good and consistent.  And any food we had through out the day was quite tasty - not over the top wow, but tasty.   We spent 2 afternoons in the bar area over looking the view and very much enjoyed it.  There was a very large deck area with tables and heat lamps; however, both afternoons the staff spent hours trying to set up the umbrella lights and heaters.  Seems it should be done much earlier so guests can enjoy the patio area in the afternoon and see the magnificent views.  

Overall, very enjoyable stay and would definitely return.  My only significant recommendation would be to provide a courtesy shuttle for guests to get into town as finding a taxi was sometimes problematic.  They could provide an hourly shuttle to / from town for guests to go to other restaurants or the train station.",4,2012,05,22
238,Simply Wonderful,"Just back from a fabulous week at this wonderful hotel.

Every last member of staff I encountered was never less than courteous and polite and couldn't have been more helpful.  A credit to themselves and the hotel. The manager himself was often visible at breakfast and had time to chat to many guests. The breakfasts were consistently good and about the best I have encountered.

I was in a group of 14 seasoned golfers and travellers some of whom are particular about the slightest things. I'm happy to say that to a man no-one had an issue of any kind with this hotel complex and that is saying a lot!

The rooms were sizable and a very good quality and the facilities such as the swimming pool magnificent.It does help that the hotel is set in a wonderful location and has great golf courses (the Heath is mental and the Glen just about the best course I have encountered).

I'll be back anfd this time to relax more and a bit less golf.

Highly recommended",5,2012,05,19
238,Relaxing 2 night stay,"We very much enjoyed our stay here, the bedroom was huge and very comfortable with beautiful views. Staff were very friendly and welcoming. Our package included dinner which was also excellent but if you were paying the prices on the menu I would say it wasn't really worth it. I had a spa treatment which was very nice although when I went into book it I was only shown the specials as if they weren't too bothered about offering the full menu. Although they were very helpful  and did fit me in early in the morning as the only other appointments were in the afternoon. As we had to spend one of our days visiting relatives and friends we didnt get to use the pool or the complimentary bikes, however we did use the gym which was very good. 

As we were there over Easter there were a lot of families and children in the hotel, this didnt bother us at all as they seemed to have lots of activities to keep them busy and in general all the children were well behaved and polite and seemed to be enjoying themselves.

We did find the bar very small and the part overlooking the golf course was very cold and there were limited seats in the lobby area so it didnt double as an overflow. Also at breakfast we found it difficult to get coffee and refills and you have to make your own toast which is one of my pet hates but seems to be getting more common. But these are only minor problems and wouldnt stop us going back

Other than that the only regret I had was not spending an extra night so I could make more of the beautiful surroundings.",4,2012,05,19
238,Def not 5 star at a push a good 4 star,"We are just after leaving druids Glen and we are not happy. This was a treat for us as we work in hotels I wanted to be looked after for a change. First I have to say the reception staff were lovely I can't fault them. The room was basic at best, nothing 5 star about it. There was suppose to be a bottle of bubbly and strawberries in our room on arrival but surprise surprise not there. Had to ask for these I feel there was no attention to detail. Also asked the night team for extra tea and milk and when I returned to the room they were just thrown on the table. We had dinner in the the bar and the food was average def not worth the money 5 star prices for burgers and sausages. The bar staff the 1st night were brill i was being annoyed by another drunken guest and anthony had a quite word and it was sorted very professional. Our room was never made up         the next day either couldn't believe it. So after dinner we had to dress the bed ourselves I do this at home not When im paying to be away. We eat in the ""restaurant"" the second night and the menu is tiny 5 starters 5 mains to chose from. But I have to say the food we got was very good thank god. The best thing about this hotel was the staff they were lovely but they are not enough for us to return. Very average very disappointed",3,2012,05,18
238,Fantastic Break.,"Just back from a couple of days break at Druid's Glen Resort. First of all to any of the Managers of Druid's Glen Resort, I have to complement your staff. They were outstanding, genuinely friendly & helpful, a great start to the break. We upgraded to a suite on arrival, and the room was lovely, views from it were beautiful. 
We had Dinner in The Brasserie both nights and can honestly say that the food was 2nd to none, loved it. Breakfasts had a good selection, although as I am a bit of a health freak I didn't partake in the cooked variety (make sure and try the home made granola :)  )
Pool, spa, plunge pool and jacuzzi were top notch, the only fault I could raise is that a lot of the locks in the lockers in changing rooms did not work. 
My wife and I then availed of Spa treatments and I can thoroughly recommend the deep tissue massage to anyone. My wife also would recommend the Druid's Spell Spa package.
All in all a fantastic, relaxing break and would definitely return for a future visit.",5,2012,05,15
238,Family break,"We spent a great weekend break at Druids Glen. Very friendly staff- non stuffy atmosphere. Golf and spa package suited everyone and the spa was really good. Leisure centre is well eqiuipped and easy to relax with a book at the poolside.The food in the restaurant was lovely, bar food was nothing special.The rooms were spacious, very comfortable and lovely views over the golf course. The hotel has bikes which are free to hire for hotel residents. The surrounding area is beautiful- lots of villages with lovely coffee shops. For the shoppers 30 min and you can be parked in Dundrum centre which ahs all the shops you could want. Overall a great break and would thoroughly recommend this hotel.",5,2012,05,12
238,A less than satisfactory stay at Druid's Glen,"I booked a break away in Druids Glen for my fiance and I last December, as he is a keen golfer and thought a break away would be lovely after the Christmas festivities. I'm sorry to say that both of us were completely and utterly disappointed - in every sense of the word. We booked an ""executive suite"" which was so dated and perishing. We had a gas fire which didn't work. The only way to describe the suite was as if a wall in the bedroom was knocked and a couch thrown in there and they called it a ""suite"". The hotel was completely overrun with kids who were running wild, no control anywhere. The swimming pool was certainly not 5 star and again overrun with kids. The bar was filthy, we had to clean up people's leftovers just to get a seat, and the barman overcharged us twice. The food in the restaurant was average and the steak I was served was like eating an old leather boot, again definitely not 5 star material. Overall a very unpleasant experience and we definitely won't be returning, even if it was offered to us for free.",1,2012,05,07
238,fabulous experience,"From the minute we stepped into the place the staff could not do enough to make us feel welcome and our every request no matter how trivial was handled with respect, patience and attention to detail. Our room was gorgeous and spacious. The food was lovely, the grounds picturesque and the spa facilities very nice. However it was the staff who made our stay, I have never been in a hotel where my husband and I were treated so well. I don't know who trains the staff or where they get their staff but hats off to them,  from Orla on reception to the patient and courteous bar staff.

Breakfast in bed is a real treat. If you are burned out and need space and relaxation this is the place.",5,2012,05,05
238,Definately not 5 star hotel.,"Myself and my husband stayed here in February, while we enjoyed our stay it was a bit dissappointing. The Receptionist was very nice and helpful but Reception itself need an update. It is a very big reception area and lacks comfort. 
Our room had a little Balcony overlooking Trees, The balcony was all green and needed a good scrub, The room itself was spacious but the old style green carpet is a bit dated.Bathroom was fine was very modern.
The Bar lacks athmosphere there seems to be no one going into it even though the Barman is very nice.
Breakfast was only ok not 5 star, Bacon was hard as if it was cooked a long time. There was plenty of everything. Freshly squeezed juice.
Overall i enjoyed the stay but cannot say its 5 star standard like the Ritz powerscourt.",3,2012,04,30
238,Pleasant but not quite the standard you'd expect for 5*,"A truly Irish welcome, couldn't fault the staff. Facilities and rooms were good, but no better than a 4* hotel. Relaxing stay. The resort accommodation made the hotel feel like it was in the middle of a housing estate, instead of a secluded golf course. Irish breakfast was of a high standard.",4,2012,04,30
238,Anne Portlaoise,I want to share my wonderful experience in druids glen.The staff were so helpful & friendly. The rooms were spotless & a great variety of food for breakfast. full marks for this hotel. Anne Portlaoise,5,2012,04,27
238,Fall under the spell - we so did!,"For a 55 minute dart ride from Connolly Station in the centre of Dublin, Druids Glen is simply another world. Beautifully positioned in a magnificent golf course it is only a short ride from the wonderful harbour of Greystones with its vast amount of quirky cafes, restaurants, one off unusual type shops etc. Everywhere was buzzing - there was no evidence of recession here!
A very friendly efficient team of staff members in Druids Glen treat you like you were visiting royalty and the level of comfort and service is simply excellent. The lesuire centre leaves nothing to be desired, with a vast range of classes and pampering treatments to leave you in a euphoric state. We ate only in the bar and it was excellent.",5,2012,04,27
238,Two night break with grandchild,"Wonderful friendly staff and great facilities. Easter value weekend to families made for a very busy time for staff, however they showed endless patience. Children's activities were well organised and catered for all age groups. Evening meal in the restaurant was perfect and a buffet laid on for children meant no waiting for a hungry little swimmer!",4,2012,04,25
238,"Wonderful staff, fantastic hotel","I went with my sisters just for one night.  This hotel is really nice. Both lunch and dinner were really good.  We arrived to early for our rooms to be ready but this was not a problem.  The
staff looked after our luggage and had our rooms ready within an hour.  We had lunch and dinner which were lovely.  The spa treatments were really good (not the best spa I have been to).  The best asset of this hotel is the staff and i hope management really appreciate them.  They cannot do enough for you. They are so friendly and efficient and really made our stay a really great one.
I would highly recommend this hotel and will be back.",5,2012,04,24
238,Lovely relaxing break,"Super friendly & helpful staff, comfortable room, fantastic spread of food at breakfast (try the porridge!) Free WiFi, and free business centre facilities. Top marks to Druid's Glen.",4,2012,04,24
238,great weekend,we went with friends. The hotel was really nice.The staff were so friendly and efficient.We had spa treatments very relaxing and well worth avisit.the men played golf on both courses and said it was fantastic.the food was great. I would highly recomend going to this hotel.,5,2012,04,22
238,We fell under the Spell,"Driving up the driveway to this hotel i just knew we were in for something special.From the moment you enter the foyer the staff very soon let you know YOU are their guest and with the warmest of welcomes you are checked in and bags whisked away.Our room was spacious airy bright and spotless and the bed was so comfy.We had lunch in the bar and the standard of food was outstanding,also we have never seen such good service in a bar,prompt, efficient and above all very friendly. Staff are so attentative and all this in the most beautiful location overlooking the golf course. Pre dinner Cocktails only added to the excitement of dinner if lunch was anything to go by.We were not disappointed,dinner in the  restaurant was five star without a doubt,the staff were very professional explaining everything that was on the menu and how it was cooked,the wine list was pretty impressive too.We were very impressed the way food is sourced locally where possible,in our view a very well run restaurant,a great dining experience.Breakfast is a grand affair catering for all palates,everything is homemade bread, scones, jams. preserves etc..eat as much as you like then walk it off in the beautiful suroundings.We spent two wonderful days there....Would we go back???In a Heartbeat...Will we go back??? Reservation already made. Like we said we fell under the spell of this truly magical place.",5,2012,04,22
238,Top Resort!,"I spent a couple of nights at this superb resort while visiting a client located nearby which chose this hotel for my stay. The bedroom, the restaurants, the spa (with gym, pool, sauna) were of a superb quality.... above all I was impressed by the excellent staff which went out of their way to make the guest feel extra- special. I had dinner both nights at the informal restaurant located close to the Bar- the quality, taste, presentation, of the food was outstanding- I recommend the carrot soup with coriander which was excellent and the yummy homemade dark Guinness bread. The buffet breakfast served in the main restaurant featured a variety of hot and cold items.
I have not visited Ireland for awhile; one forgets how welcoming the irish people are; their big smiles and happy attitude make such a difference. Kudos to them having in mind that the country is going through some tough financial times!...",5,2012,04,19
238,Lovely stay at Druid's Glen,"My husband, 7 year old daughter, and I stayed in Druid's Glen for two nights (April 9 & 10) to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary. We had a lovely time and thoroughly enjoyed our experience. Our daughter received a ""kids pack"" on arrival which she was delighted with. We were delighted with the chocs, champagne, and choc covered strawberries in room upon our arrival. 

The room and bathroom were nice and very clean. We loved the soft robes and slippers. The mattresses were very comfortable. There was no water pressure in the shower. If you have hair, be prepared to rinse it under the bath tap for a good rinse. I found the pressure in the showers in women's locker room (in leisure area) the very same. It was still a very nice room and comfortable.

We dined both evenings in the restaurant. The service and the food was exceptional. Our servers on each night were very friendly and prompt. Both servers had fabulous personalities and were very child friendly. We also enjoyed our breakfast (both mornings) in the restaurant. Servers were very prompt coming to our table to offer us tea or coffee. There was a HUGE selection of food and it was quite good (I've gained 3lbs 8-O).

We went back to our room at about 10pm both evenings. We were a bit surprised to find children of all ages running rampant in the lobby, up and down the stairs, and up and down the corridors (mostly on the second floor). They were VERY noisy. It was like something out of Pinocchio's Pleasure Island. They were completely unsupervised as their mothers sat lapping up glasses of wine in front of the fireplace closest to the stairs. Sleep was futile as the children were not trotted back to their rooms until the bottles of wine were completely polished off by Ma at about midnight. I don't blame the hotel for this. I blame the parents. It's poor parenting and bad manners.

We had a lovely time down at the pool. It was very silly and we got a good laugh out of my bald husband having to purchase a swim cap for €3. Dude's bald! Bald dudes don't need swim caps. The water was the perfect temperature. The hot tub was magical and the sauna was divine! All areas were very clean!!

In general, the staff were very good. We really appreciated the quick, friendly service by all. We would definitely stay again.",4,2012,04,19
238,4* at the most!,"I have stayed in 5* accommodation before and this hotel by anyone's standards was not a 5*!
Lovely hotel but that is it, it was just lovely! The grounds in the hotel was fabulous! 
The reason for my stay was for a relaxing Spa break, 2 girls on a Sunday night!

The Room:
I was very eager to see my 5* room but was left disappointed - it was very dated, clean and nothing could be faulted really except it was by no means a 5* room. View was great!  Our room was to come with a bottle of Precessco & strawberries which were not delivered until we reminded them, when it was brought up the strawberries where missing which we had to then report.  The view from the hotel was fabulous! 

The Spa:
This was the main reason for my visit and we both booked in for the ""Signature"" treatment.  I was taken in for my full body massage and facial.  The girl who was doing this for me never asked what kind of pressure I would like to be applied and it felt like she just oiled up my skin as you would apply moisturiser to the skin for the full hour.  After the facial i still had remains of  make up on my face and it was dry, products used seemed to be for ""all skin types"" rather than for specific skin types.  when I went back to relaxation room which is lovely i met my friend who had just had the same treatment (she is also a beautician) told me she was disappointed with her treatment and for the same reasons. when i am getting a facial i like to feel like it was of some benefit to my skin.

The Food:
As the rest of the hotel had been some what of a disappointed in standards we chose to eat in the bar rather than be disappointed with the restaurant also and food was mediocre at best, bland fish and very burnt chips!

Nice hotel but they will loose that 5th star if they dont do something",3,2012,04,17
238,Great stay!,"I stayed in Druids Glen in January for my husband's birthday and it was a great experience.
We stayed 2 nights and ate in the bar on the first night. The food was excellent and the table service was great.
We went to the spa on the Saturday and had a great massage and my husband went for a swim afterwards. The facilities are excellent.
We ate in the restaurant on the Saturday night and the food was even better. It  is a bit pricey though but even though it was busy we weren't waiting for long.
I thought the breakfast was lovely on both mornings even though it was packed the staff dealt with it well.
Overall we really enjoyed it and will definitely be going back in the near future!",5,2012,04,16
238,Fantastic weekend stay,Just checked out. We had a fantastic weekend here. Service was 5*. All the staff were exceptionally friendly especially Adrienne in reception who was brilliant. Amenities are top class. Food was exceptional both in the bar and restaurant. All in all we will definitely be coming back here in the future.,5,2012,04,16
238,Worth the visit,"Stayed two nights as we had bought a voucher deal on line, I have to say that the staff are brilliant and always go out of their way to help in any way they can. We had dinner in the Druids brasserie on the Friday night and the food was gourgeous, breakfast was Brillant, anything and everything you could want, pancakes, omelettes, poached eggs all freshly made. The beds were really comfy and the view out our window was lovely. The gym and pool were great. Definitely would return..",4,2012,04,15
238,Great family break,"This is our fifth or sixth time to stay at this hotel. While it is a bit expensive the facilities they have for our three young daughters are great. They were delighted with their gifts upon checkin and all the easter activities were a big hit as was the new playground. We were also delighted to be upgraded upon check in to the Presidential suite with interconnectimg room. Very impressed though didnt get to really enjoy it as had one child sick for two of the days. We are not golfers but we find this hotel very relaxing and it is within easy reach of our home. One downside is that when you have to book two rooms it does make a weekend break very expensive, even wtih kids eating free. We got room service one evening but decided to eat dessert downstairs - this was more expensive than the main meal and that was only for ice cream!. That aside we will be back. staff are very friendly and helpful and good for families.",5,2012,04,14
238,Very enjoyable family break,"Stayed here for 2 nights with wife and two young children aged 1 and 5. Children had great time from moment we arrived. The hotel felt very comfortable and very family orientated. There was plenty for the kids to do and they were never bored. Although there was plenty of families staying in the hotel, it never felt overrun by children as it is quite spacious. Room are a little bit outdated but this was not a problem as they were very clean and well maintained. Would definitely return with or without the children and would have no problem recommending this hotel to any traveller young or old.",5,2012,04,11
238,Too many kids. Guests forced to wear swimming hats! Pool cloudy!,"Stayed here a couple of years ago and returned with my wife for Easter. This hotel has become successful at filling beds by attracting families with young kids. I appreciate all hotels must try to be profitable but this hotel should give a warning to older guests. What I did not appreciate and am still in shock is the new policy of forcing guests to wear swimming hats. I am nearly bald and have a no 3 cut for the side of my head. I was told that for hygiene reasons I must wear a hat! I objected and stated that no other 5 star hotels in Ireland and elsewhere in the world in which I had stayed had ever requested let alone insisted that I must wear a swimming hat. To make matters worse the pool was cloudy! So much for the hygiene reasons for wearing hats. I can only assume that the pool has not been fitted with the appropriate hair traps or that they are trying to save money on usage of pool chemicals. This hotel makes a great deal of effort stating that it is a 5 star hotel, all I can do is hope that whoever is in charge gets a bit of common sense and decides to treat it's guests as 5 star guests would wish to be treated.",1,2012,04,10
238,Beautiful hotel with avoid if you're looking for relaxation,"Druids Glen is a lovely hotel, on fabulous grounds, great staff and good if overpriced food. well overpriced in the bar, if you can get a seat.  

 The rooms are nice and big and there is free wifi, 

BUT if you're childless, or looking for a quiet relaxing break, AVOID AVOID AVOID.  

This hotel caters for families with young children, and does not cater in the slightest for anyone else.   I went there for the weekend with my family and my elderly mother and the place was totally overrun by small children.  For them and their parents it's paradise, but for everyone else it is a nightmare.  There is no place to relax, no adult areas, even the bar and the dining room were totally overrun with kids.  The noise was at breaking level so well what I'm saying is if you want a relaxing break in the Wicklow mountains, don't go todruids glen. If you have a family with small kids put this place on your radar.  

The other downside of all of this is that there's no where close, so if you are stuck here and can't find any space in order to get peace and relaxation you have to get in your car.

I also used the,spa, which was nice, but really not the best, pretty average.",4,2012,04,09
238,Fantastic hotel for all age groups!,"Stayed here on a 3 night B&B deal which was excellent value for 2 adults and 2 10 yr old kids. Room was spacious with view of Druids Glen Golf Course, bottled water, 2 double beds; plenty of extra towels/ teabags/ cereal bowls for kids on request. Kids enjoyed excellent golf tuition from the pros as part of the Golf Fun activity- superb golf courses enjoyed by Dad- will book spa ahead for next time we stay as it was fully booked during our stay but enjoyed the health club facilities very much. The hotel is spotless and the staff are top notch - a smile on everyone's face and a nod or hello from any you meet throughout the hotel- overall a very impressive stay to showcase Ireland's hospitality.",5,2012,04,08
238,No value..better places to stay,"Reminds me of a night I spent in calcutta!except it didn't cost €200!! Rooms way too hot with broken A/C..food in restruant was awful as was the service..GF actually went back to room and got sick several times. Night is over immediately,clearly not going to have breakfast now!!! Would actually leave now only for 2 glasses of wine at ""dinner"" so can't drive and STUCK here until morning..!! Grope",2,2012,04,06
238,3star not 5star,"We stayed in hotel last night..Rooms v dated' staff definitley not providing 5star service including manager. Electricity went at 5pm and did not come back untill 8pm..we did not get an apology or not even offered a drink in bar..we were given a bowl of crisps to compensate no heat, no lighting, no leisure facilities... Would never stay here again v poor service..",2,2012,04,04
238,well worth a visit,"stayed for 2 nights  we booked 15 rooms in total for family party. the staff are the most friendly staff i have ever come across . pool is fab,breakfast is magic  you name it they have it.only 1 little moan get bigger fillet steaks chef...lol.",5,2012,03,29
238,A great family night away,We recently stayed at the Druids Glen - only 30 minutes from home and kids eat and stay free - a double bonus break. The rooms are large and we were overlooking the golf course. The kids enjoyed the pool and a run around their new playground while my wife had a relaxing massage. Dinner was nice and breakfast was a buffet - slightly chaotic with a long queue for omlettes - however it was Sunday morning and the hotel was very busy. An enjoyable break and we will be back again.,4,2012,03,27
238,The perfect wedding,"I'll start by admitting this review is based upon my wedding weekend stay so it may be a bit biased! For anyone planning a wedding here I couldn't recommend it enough. Everything was perfect. Staff were amazing, food was amazing, the bedroom suites and function rooms were amazing! Will definitely be back for our wedding anniversary next year.",5,2012,03,27
238,"Good stay - but definitely not a 5* property, rather a 4*","I stayed here recently for 1 night for a work event. Check-in was very smooth - the room was ready on arrival early in the morning. I went up to the room and it was very spacious, big King bed, flat screen TV, nice bathroom. However, I then noticed that I'd been allocated a connecting room as there was a connecting door in the room. I never stay in connecting room as I just don't feel safe. I went down to reception and told them that I'd like to change to a non-connecting room and they were very nice and understanding about it. They said the only room they had available was one with two double beds instead of one king bed and I was fine with that. The two beds didn't bother me so long as that stupid connecting door wasn't there!!

The food was nice - breakfast, lunch, dinner and mid-morning/afternoon snacks.

The reason I said it's not a 5* is because the property just isn't up to 5* standard. The room did look a little shabby and the bathroom while nice, was not up to the usual standard of other 5* that I've stayed in. I've stayed in 4* properties which had nicer rooms/bathrooms than Druids Glen.",4,2012,03,24
238,Excellent wedding venue,"From the day we first visited the hotel up to our wedding day, the staff were excellent and very accomodating, from the reception staff to the wedding co-ordinator Nessa.  Once our wedding was booked everything was taken care of.  The reception room looked fantastic on the day, our meal was excellent, and we have some great photos taken at the back of the hotel  I received so many compliments after the wedding of what a good wedding reception it was. The bridal suite is beautiful.  Absolutely no hesitation in recommending this hotel for  a wedding venue",5,2012,03,23
238,Nice stay.,"We recently stayed at this hotel for 2 nights over the bank holiday weekend. From the moment we checked in Stephanie on the front desk could not be more helpful and friendly. The lobby is a nice area with open seating and a fireplace, nice to sit and relax.  The room is a good size, comfortable bed with a great size bathroom.  We ate in the bar the first night we were there as the hotel is out a little from the local village of Newtownmountkennedy so it was just handier to stay at the hotel.  

The bar food menu for a 5* hotel I felt let it down somewhat because of the very little choice that was available on it. We both had the burgers and these were satisfying.  On the second night we decided to eat in the restaurant again the choice was somewhat limited in comparison to other hotels we have stayed at. I had soup to start with and if I am honest it was only tepid as was my main course of steak - so this was a little disappointing.  However the restaurant and bar staff are extremly pleasant and I could not fault them in anyway.

The breakfast selection was good with everything you could want, hot food, fruit, scones, pastries, juices, youghurts etc.  We used the pool during our stay and it was lovey and quiet so had plenty of time to swim comfortably and we also availed of the spa while there, which was really enjoyable and relaxing. The hotel is really nice but I don't think I would class it as a 5* resort in comparison to other 5* resorts we have stayed in throughout the country.

While we were at the hotel we took advantage of the location to go Powerscourt Gardens, Glendalough, Brittas Bay & the coast road which are all only a short drive from the hotel.

We really enjoyed our break at the hotel and it was really relaxing and staff certainly make you feel welcome. Only downside for us was the food but again it was a bank holiday weekend so I wouldn't hold it against them but certainly would like more options on the menu. I would recommend the hotel for a short break if you are looking for something relaxing but if you like to be in the centre of things this might not be the ideal spot for you as you have to drive. I would return but I would leave it a little while before I do.",4,2012,03,23
238,St Patricks weekend,"Excellent hotel, nice staff, great food in the restaurant. Great music session and sing along in the bar.
We went for evening walk near the golf course, went too far to return by the same route so went into clubhouse for assistance, got helpful directions for short cut back to the hotel from a very pleasant gent from the pro shop.
I used the leisure centre, for a morning swim, sauna and steam room which was very pleasant also.
Excellent breakfast, spoiled for choice.
very relaxing.",5,2012,03,22
238,Very nice,"I stayed here at the beginning of January 12. Very nice stay, receptionist was very friendly and very helpful. I opted for the dinner, bed and breakfast deal. The room was very nice and spacious. Had a little problem with the internet but reception quickly resolved it. The meal was very nice, although all the nice options had 2 or 3 euro supplement charges. The manager was very nice and chatted with us very politely which i always love during a meal. We went for a a little walk afterwards as there is a walking/jogging track which during the day would be very nice ( we went at night). All in all it was a very nice stay.",4,2012,03,20
238,Excellent Hotel,"My wife and I spent a very nice weekend here (3rd and 4th March). The staff here in this hotel go out of there way to make you welcome , the receptionists ,the dining room staff , the bar staff, the cleaning staff,the leisure centre staff, the golf club staff all deserve a mention.The food both in the bar and the restaurant was excellent .The breakfast was excellent too. In our case the rooms were very clean and spacious.The hotel was spotless throughout.Even though there was a wedding here and the hotel very busy there was no noise during the night, We will be back.

238,midweek break,"Have stayed at this hotel several times before and have always enjoyed the experience. on this visit t he hotelwas still lovely although could do with a wee bit of sprucing up, but nothing significant. It is spotlessly clean and the staff are all extremely friendly. The receptionist was very professional and helpful. They had some nice touches, it was my husbands birthday and they sent him a lovely card and a little box of chocolates, which was unexpected. I always find this hotel relaxing and had always enjoyed the Spa and Health facilities. I had a wonderful massage in the Spa, the staff were lovely and made you feel special. On the down side, I had went for a swim and found that the changing rooms were awash with screaming children, as was the swimming pool. Not the sort of thing you expect  from 5star hotel. I appreciate that the hotel obviously wants to support its local community, however as a guest of the hotel, I stayed in the pool 10 minutes. The other facilities ie changing rooms, steam rooms were quite grubby. Parents of the children walked about in their outdoor shoes even though there were shoe covers available. Based on this whilst I loved the hotel and its relaxing atmosphere I would not be using the health facilities again if I were to return. Sorry this is a bit negative but it was disappointing for myself who sees the pool facilites as an integral part of my holiday.",4,2012,03,19
238,Wonderful hotel,"We stayed there only for one night but really enjoyed it and will definitely be back. The staff were extremely friendly and very attentive, the room was very comfortable.  Although the hotel seemed to be fully booked due to a wedding there was still a very relaxed atmosphere about the place. The food was absolutely delicious and we would have loved to stay longer.  Also the grounds of the hotel are beautiful especially if you get a bit of sunshine.  We didnt avail of the spa so not sure what that is like.",5,2012,03,12
238,Very Good but not  5*,"Stayed recently on a discounted package deal. We where greated professionally and promptly at check in. The use of the Hotel lock up was not a problem and the staff where always pleasant and very prompt indeed. However the room was not 5* standard imo. Stains where present on the bed base along with the carpet. Bathroom sink took forever to empty. Room was quite cold at night. 

There was a wedding on one of the nights we stayed, and it would appear that most of the wedding guests where on our floor, we where kept awake until about 6:30am due to late night revellers. This imo is a major error on the Hotels part. Placing non wedding guests on the same floor as thoses attending the wedding, this was always going to result in a restless night! 

The Spa facilities where run of the mill. Not Bad but not great. Certainly not 5* standard thats for sure. Although opinions differ. 

We dined in the Restaurant and the food was fantastic. Certainly 5* standard and then some. Waiters where prompt and curtious. My wife had Monkfish and i had Pork Chops. Absolutley awsome food. Well seasoned and cooked to perfection. I would recommend this Restaurant to anyone.

Overall the stay was better than good but not brilliant and to be honest did not live up to our expectations. Small things as listed above would change my overall review though, wheather these changes will happen will depend on future user reviews?.......",4,2012,03,08
238,Was disappointed!,"Stayed there recently for three nights. When we went to our room we wer very disappointed def not 5star standard. The room was dark, the carpet was dirty and the bed sheet. I went to reception to ask for another room. The receptionist Janet was very helpful and gave us another room, it was better then the first but still not WOW and the shower was dirty but I didn't want to complain again. Had two dinners included first night was amazing, the next night was not had to send my main course back twice....breakfast is lovely plenty of choice. Got over charged departing. Overall the hotel is nice but really disappointed about the room and especially dinner because I know it can be amazing.",4,2012,03,05
238,Okay 4 * but definitely no 5 *,"Stayed in the Croke Park hotel the night before which is a 4* and would have to say that as a hotel it is better than the 5* Druids Glen in probably every regard. Thats not to say that there was lots wrong with Druids Glen, it just didn't come close to living up to the hopes we had for a break in a 5* resort, especially after staying in the Croke Park Hotel the night before. The rooms were big but all the little luxurious details that we hoped to find while there were not present, I would class it as a very good 3* or an average 4*. The price you pay is really going to dictate your opinion of Druids Glen. We were on a gift voucher for a weekend break (2nBB1D) so in no way could we feel cheated as we hadn't paid anything for it but going there our hopes were high that we would be wowed and we were left totally underwhelmed. If we had paid 5* prices then we would have felt cheated however if you get a cheap deal and your expectations aren't of a 5* experience then you could most certainly enjoy yourself. Breakfast was a bit chaotic but fine, but again it was no better than you would expect in any normal hotel. Not much choice for dinner and the quality was nothing special, again if we had been paying the €35 per person that they were charging, then I don't think we would have felt we got value for money. Also was very disappointed to see that we got charged for water, the first question we were asked when we sat down was whether we wanted still or sparklng water, not if we wanted water. I thought this was a really pathetic way of getting a few euros out of people and as a matter of principle really annoyed us, as you would only expect that sort of nonsense in a really mickey mouse establishment. I wouldn't say avoid Druids Glen but definitely do not have high expectations if you are thinking of booking",3,2012,02,27
238,Weekend break was pure relaxation,"Got an online deal for 2 nights bed and breakfast for about €200 and snapped it up. The hotel is very close to Dublin, only 25 minutes drive and we had a great weekend down there. Arrived down on Friday night and were quickly and easily checked into a wonderful room. The deal included chocolate strawberries and Prosecco which were presented immaculately. The first night we ate in the Bar - burgers and homemade chips and the meal was delicious. The only issue I would have was the price of the food in the bar - for lunch on Saturday a club sandwich was about 14euro which is very dear. The second night we ate in the restaurant and the food was brilliant, dear again but well worth it. For both mornings we ate breakfast in the hotel and this was the clear highlight. A great selection and all tastes were catered for - eg pancakes or omlettes cooked on request. Throughout the weekend we used the pool and sauna etc which were very nice. There was also some nice walks around the hotel.

Overall it was a great break and we hope to go back",4,2012,02,26
238,Beautiful and Relaxing,"Just spend two nights in The Druids Glen and really enjoyed our stay there. I don't know what it is like during the busier times but It was so relaxing and peaceful in beautiful surroundings.  The staff were very helpful and friendly. The food was good, not a huge choice on the menu but we couldn't have any complaints about what we had in both the restaurant and bar. I found the rooms a nice size, the bath robes and slippers were a nice touch and the beds were so comfortable. Just a couple of small negatives we thought asking 3 Euro for the swimming hat a bit mean for such a hotel, also the price of a pint at 5.20 was a bit steep in the current climate. That said we had a really enjoyable peaceful break here.",4,2012,02,24
238,Mini Hotel Break,"Just back from what I can only describe as the best break I've ever had, The Druids Glen is just comple Heaven, and we were treated like lords and ladies, and made feel so welcome, the food was devine, service unbeatable, and we had a problem with our room when we arrived when I say problem we were between two noisey families who were doing a lot of interaction between each other, so we asked to be moved and were accommodated straight away to a different room.  I also received a complimentary Bottle of Wine just because it was my Birthday, walk around hotel is just serene.  Thank you Druids Glen is all I can say we will be back",5,2012,02,21
238,Very mixed bag,"I stayed here with my partner for a friends wedding in late December. The exterior and setting of the hotel is fantastic. The room was average but with a good view. The spa and poor were way below average. We had dinner the night before the wedding in the main restaurant. There was a really unruly table of diners with a three year old who they allowed play with an iPhone on loudspeaker. It completely ruined our meal. We gve up half way through the main course and asked the waiter could we finish our wine at the bar. No comment from the waiter apart from asking fir a signature for a bill of 150.

The food and the wedding was good but the service was appalling.",2,2012,02,20
238,Superb.....again!,"Visited Druids Glen resort again and yet again it was superb. Warmly welcomed back and given an upgrade to a (huge) suite with interconnecting double/double with roll away for the kids. Excellent meal in the brasserie on first night (included in package) and in the bar on second night. Even served the mouthwatering pork I had from the brasserie menu for my wife when we ate in the bar! Rooms are clean and super comfortable, bed in suite amongst the best we have slept in. Swimming pool a big hit with the kids as was the sauna and steam room with me. We had a great time with the fantastic friendly and welcoming attitude of the staff really playing a big part. I would highly recommend Druids Glen not only for a family get away but also a romantic short break or even a shopping trip to Dublin which is only 45 mins away. Thanks to all the staff for making our return visit just perfect.",5,2012,02,19
238,A Wonderful Place To Say,"My husband and I stayed in the hotel for a one night stay this week. We both feel that we need to commend the hotel on a wonderful stay. From the time we rang to book our night right through to the time we left was a pleasure. The staff on reception were so friendly and nothing was any trouble. We arrived earlier than the normal book in time but there was no problem and we were allocated our room. Our room was lovely and spotlessly clean. We had booked an evening meal and the service was fantastic. The waitress who served us was so polite and helpful. She was very friendly without been over powering. The meal was fantastic. The breakfast was also fantastic. Although the restaurant was busy the food was plentiful, well presented and hot.
 
Over all we had a lovely relaxing stay and would definitely return.
 
Many thanks to all the staff",5,2012,02,18
238,Not a 5 star hotel,"No turn down service, no breakfast room cards, food in bar only average - had a vanilla creme brûlée but no taste of vanilla, had worst chicken wings ever with no dipping bowl or wipes. Decor in bar and restaurant not very opulent as you would expect from 5 star. We left and dined in Gordon ramseys restaurant in powerscourt nearby. This was real 5 star luxurious surroundings",3,2012,02,17
238,Ticks all the boxes,"We had a 2 night stay at this lovely hotel, just 20 minutes or so south of Dublin city.  We were on a Pigsback deal, which gave us 2 nights B&B with a bottle of wine included, €30 off a Spa treatment and €30 off the restaurant.  

We had a lovely big room, with a flat screen TV, a good size fridge, a decent safe that held handbag/camera etc, two VERY comfortable double beds with crisp cotton sheets, an iron & ironing board, complimentary bottled water and tea & coffee making facilities with shortbread included!  

Bathroom was a good size, clean, and well stocked with shampoo/conditioner/shower gel/soap and shower cap.  There was a separate shower from the bath, which I was really pleased about!  

The air conditioning worked well, unlike some other hotels that are too hot or too cold.  We were able to open the window a little too and again this was welcome as I hate to stay at a hotel where I can't get fresh air into the room.  

The swimming pool was a good size and not too chilly.  There was a lane set aside for people who wanted to be able to swim lengths and it wasn't too bust at any point so this was good. The jacuzzi was pleasant, and the steam rooms (there were two).  I didn't use the sauna but my other half did and he thought that it was fine. There was a plunge pool too, and I stayed well away from that!  

Didn't use the gym but again my other half did.  It's not terribly big, but then it wasn't too busy either so he had easy access to the treadmills and the bikes. 

I had a hot stone massage in the Spa and this was quite nice.  I have had better hot stone massages in other Spa's but I would be nit picking to say that it was substandard.  

The food was one of the best things about the hotel.  Truly excellent!  Breakfast was very varied and everything tasted really good.  (Pudding a little dry for my liking, but there was plenty to choose from, so I just left this aside).  There was also a chef preparing omelettes and pancakes and poached eggs were available to order if required.  There was lovely smoked salmon each morning too, and a good selection of breads etc.  

We had two evening meals and I have to say that they were above the standard I was expecting.  To be honest, the scallops for starter were very disappointing.  At €15 for three small scallops I thought that I was being short changed, but the rest of the food that we ordered made up for it.  I had venison on the first night and it was exquisite!  My husband had stuffed pork and it was so good that he ordered it again on the second night!  

Wines were pricey at €25 and up, but we had the one that was recommended via a card left on the table (a French Vionnier) and it was really delicious.

The staff were very friendly and very helpful throughout the hotel and we felt that we were made feel very welcome there.  

I would certainly look forward  to returning again and I would have no hesitation in recommending the hotel to others.",5,2012,02,15
238,Afternoon tea and a few drinks!,"While staying in Newtownmountkennedy recently we popped up to the Druids Glen for a walk and a few drinks. 
The service was excellent,the afternoon tea was excellent (and the kitchen accommodated an early request as it didn’t start till 3!). This is what 5 start service is to me, its accommodating the customer!
Hotel itself is lovely and set in lovely grounds and very relaxed atmosphere in the bar/lounge. 
One small complaint we sat to the back of the bar/lounge area beside the window overlooking the golf course and the river to the back of the hotel and there was a very strong draft in this area and I was slightly chilly during my stay. 
We will definitely be back for a stay next time!",5,2012,02,15
238,5* EXCELLENCE,"Stayed for a sat night at the end of Jan as it was our wedding anniversary. Were delighted to be upgraded to an executive suite as we were celebrating a special occasion. There was a lovely card and a small box of chocs in the room which was a lovely touch.  The check in staff were most friendly and efficient. 
The room was huge, a seperate sitting room and bedroom and a large bathroom. The heating in the room could of been a bit better, was quite cool in the room but a little electric heater had been plugged in so we turned that up and soon heated up.
We had dinner in the restaurant and I can't fault it, the food was fantastic and the service was second to none. We even got a ""Happy Anniversary"" wrote on our dessert plate, nice touch! Breakfast was equally as good. A large selection of food,  hot and cold buffets, made to order pancakes and omlettes, definately something to suit everyone you could not leave the Druids Glen hungry.
A delightful stay so I have rebooked a night in June for my husbands 50th birthday so really looking forward to a return visit, this time with the kids so will try out the leisure centre.",5,2012,02,14
238,Fine.. nothing to write home about,Returned here for one night stay in Jan 2012 with husband and young baby. It was a year since last stay. Overall not particularly impressed and when we left we felt we had not got great value for money (E185 total for 1BBD). Check in efficient. Room large nothing to get excited about. Two double beds (note not king size). Travel cot provided free of charge. Room was sweltering at night. IT was down corridor from leisure centre and the corridor was humid. Other people reported that it was hot in their room too. Bar food was still poor much like our last visit. Sat down to order lunch and it was ten mins before we were acknowledged and another ten before menu came. Told by staff that there was new staff getting trained up hence delay. Food when arrived was very average. Ate in druid’s brassiere that night. Food was fine .. Standard seemed to have dropped though from a year ago. Service was good. Leisure centre was good. Overall impression is average hotel not far from Dublin but not worth the price. Nothing to write home about.,3,2012,02,14
238,5* service & staff,"We stayed on a weekend break last week and were very impressed by the hotel.All aspects of the hotel (room ,food ,staff ,spa ) were excellent and we look forward to revisiting soon.",5,2012,02,10
238,Great Hotel in Beautiful Surroundings,We stayed for a weekend. Beautiful place. Staff cant do enough to help. Very warm and welcoming. Food delicious. Lovely relaxed atmosphere. Will be returning.,4,2012,02,10
238,Fantastic Mini-break : Food and service top class,"My wife and I stayed in the Druids Glen Hotel for a short break.

At check in the staff were extremely friendly and helpful without being overbearing. There is plently of parking available. The hotel is a very modern design. The lobby is very spacious and there is plently of seating available.

The rooms are very nice. Very spacious by European standards, I suspect the hotel was built to American standards as it was formally in the Marriott group.

We had dinner at the hotel and the food was top class and the service was fantastic.

The leisure centre is top class and was very relaxing before dinner. We did not play golf but I have played Druids Glen in the past and it is a top class challenging course.

Only one slight niggle, the quality of the cooked breakfast, sausages, rashers etc was not up to the rest of the experience. If the breakfast was as good as the rest of the experience I would have given the stay 5 stars

We recommend it and will definitely be back.",4,2012,02,10
238,Gone downhill!,"Stayed last July and felt that this is an excellent location but had too many kids running riot. I believe that the deal was kid stay and eat for free. Not what you expect from a five star hotel! I do business in the area and stayed again last week. I went to the pool only to be given a tight fitting swimming hat and when I stayed that the last time a stayed I had not had to wear one, I was told that it is a new policy and itnwas compulsory. There was a sign at the reception stating that swimming hats must be worn and and picture on the door from the changing room to the pool. To make matters worse the pool was half roped off because swimming lessons were taking place. I have never stayed in any five star hotel that insists its guest wear swimming hats. This hotel needs to decide wether it wants to attract five star guests because it is definitely not a five star service. Whoever regulates the star rating in Ireland needs to inform this hotel what a 5 star experience is and that if Druids resort do not want to deliver it they should have one or two star removed. I note that there was an AA five star plaque on the front gate but when I tried to search AA five star hotel in Ireland this hotel was not listed. I am not surprised!",2,2012,02,04
238,Perfect Short-Stay,"Visited Druids Glen for the first time just for a short stay and was very pleased with the whole experience. It was very quiet, only a few guests on a Tuesday night, but that suited us fine. (I believe the weekends get booked out well ahead of time.) We received a warm welcome and that set the tone for the exceptional friendliness of all the staff. Ken and Anthony
in the bar went out of their way for us. We ate in the bar because the dining room was so quiet that we decided there would be more atmosphere in the smaller venue. The food was fine, and the orange scones we had with afternoon tea were out of this world.
Our room was lovely, with a nice view over the golf course and beyond. The walks around the hotel are great. As it is only a short drive, just the ticket for a break from the manic pace of Dublin city!",4,2012,02,01
238,Great night,"Hi 

I was away for a night with some girls friends - great stay - staff very friendly with out being overbearing.  Food was also great.  Couldn't recommend it highly enough in terms of value for money service & location !",5,2012,01,31
238,Lovely relaxing stay,"We had a lovely relaxing weekend break at this hotel.

Liked: 
Staff: The friendliest and most accommodating staff I've ever come across in an Irish hotel
Bedroom: Lovely spacious bedroom with balcony, comfy bed, elemis toiletries in ensuite, robes and slippers to wear to leisure center, liked having climate control in room 
Leisure Centre: small but appealing leisure center - nice that it stays open so late (Fri: until 10pm, Sat: until 8pm)
Spa: Spa treatment was excellent (I got the druids glen signature treatment).
Food: great breakfast (fresh squeezed orange juice, smoked salmon, fresh baked treats: orange scones, pain au chocolat etc, delicious hot food options incl omlettes made to order), nice dinner
Free use of hotel bicycles: we didn't use these but it's a nice touch!
Free hot chocolate with marshmallows in lobby :)

Minor Dislikes:
Paying 3.10 for a watery coffee from the bar. Bad coffee is a pet hate of mine, especially when it's overpriced.
Tea served at breakfast wasn't great. Would prefer if teabags were provided to make own tea (that way you can make it to your own taste strength-wise).
Chilensis cabernet sauvignon - drinkable but 25.00 a bottle is too much for such an average wine. With dinner we opted to pay 4.00 extra and go for the Don David Malbec (29.00) which was absolutely gorgeous.",4,2012,01,31
238,Very good but not a true 5 star property,"Stayed here for a weekend break at the beginning of January. Very nice hotel but I would not class as a true 5 star. The pool area and rooms are a serious let down. The changing rooms for the pool were tatty, shower doors broken and lockers jammed. The bedrooms are very basic though spacious. I had a terrible nights sleep on the Friday night due to the mattress being hollow at the sides but this was corrected immediately by reception on Saturday morning and we were moved to a suite. The suite was lovely, spacious but no major special touches, however was very happy with the swift and attentive service of the reception staff considering I was not seeking an immediate upgrade - this was five star service. 

Breakfast was gorgeous, yes its busy but breakfast in most busy hotels tends to be. We ate dinner in the dining room on Saturday night and the food was excellent. The restaurant was very relaxed and staff were great. 

I did avail of a massage and the therapist was fantastic and professional. Im very sorry I didnt take her name to share. The relaxation room was nice but would have expected way more for five star. 

Overall a very nice and relaxing property. I will stay here again but my expectations will be met in future.",4,2012,01,30
238,Wonderful,"Just back from a fantastic night away with some old school  friends.  The atmosphere is fantastic.  The  food, service & staff were incredible and it was very good value for money.  Loved it!",5,2012,01,29
238,Wedding,"I attended a wedding here and was so disappointed with the hotel. I had stayed here twice before and loved it! 

Despite being the 1st wedding guest to arrive at the hotel, check in was long and slow and I was made to feel inferior because I didnt have a credit card. I offered my Laser but this was not acceptable. The girl suggested I pay in cash but I needed my cash for the bar etc... All in all it took about 15 mind and I felt like a criminal! 

The room was nice, the beds are VERY comfortable. The initial drinks reception was held in an area with NO SEATING and we were there from3pm til 5.30pm. There was finger food served eventually at 4.30pm and the waiters walked around and missed our party nearly every time. 

When we entered the function room it was freezing. Everyone at my table was cold and when I looked around most of the other guests had put their coats on. There was no staff to tell so I asked the bar man to turn off air con, who got a manager , who came over to me during the meal and made it quite obvious I had a problem (embarrassing in front of bride & groom at a wedding). He eventually turned on the heat for a while after some other people complained.

There was no choice of food  on the menu (I am aware this is the bride & grooms choice) However, from a table of 10, 6 did not eat the starter and 4 did not eat the main course. We asked for an alternative and could only have the vegetarian option (one girl asked for a piece of chicken but was refused) I feel in a 5star hotel when the bride & groom have paid a huge amt of money, this is petty! I got married last year in a cheaper 4 star hotel but they advised us on all these issues and provided us with an experienced wedding co-ordinator who would have made sure this did not happen and I happen to know they cooked chicken for 2 of our guests on request. This seemed to be missing and details such as cutting the cake & first dance were left to chance! It just didnt flow well...and there were not enugh staff.

Hot finger food was brought out at some point after 10.30pm but no one told guest and no plates/napkins were provided, so when i went to the bar at 10.30pm to buy an overpriced drink I saw the food(lots of it) in bowls n the corner but it hadnt been touched and was stone cold- no one knew it was there!!

Room was really nice again and pool is lovely but breakfast was less than average.",2,2012,01,25
238,Lovely welcoming hotel!,"We got our 2 night break on a pigsback offer.  My 6 yr old son was given an activity pack on arrival which we thought was a lovely touch.  The room was very nice but I wouldnt have thought was 5* standard and we had to ask for a serious collection of cobwebs to be cleaned.  Apart from that we thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  The breakfast and bar food were gorgeous and the staff were very friendly and helpful.  Very relaxing stay.  The leisure centre facilities were great and the local is fantastic for Glendalough, Johnnie Foxes and the local beaches.  We have already booked to return in February.",5,2012,01,23
238,Fab weekend in an amazing hotel,Just spent the weekend in Druids Glen ...... What an fabulous location Hotel was lovely and the staff were so nice and helpfull. Food was amazing and I have to say in all the hotels I have stayed in they had the nicest breakfast I have ever eaten. They have lovely locally sourced food which is cooked and presented in a 5 star fashion.,5,2012,01,22
238,not 5 star standard,"stayed here weekend of January 20th, and was disappointed with the hotel.  The meal in the dining room was very good but over-priced.  The breakast was akin to a canteen  with no tablecloths and noise and racket abounding.  It was overun with buggys and prams and closely resembled a creche.  Children ran along the bedroom corridors until midnight and we were there f or a rest. Poached eggs came with water on the plate and  waiter just po.ured the water on to another. plate.  Room was wrong 2 beds booked, king size allocated f or 2   
females.   The gym was good. Nothing about it was 5 star   .If you want 5star luxury try Harvey's Point Donegal.  .",3,2012,01,22
238,Top Class!,"I have just returned from a two night break with my boyfriend at Druids Glen, and I have to say that they thoroughly live up to their fine reputation. From checking in; to the bar; to the leisure centre and spa, all the staff were outstanding! We were allocated a lovely room on the second floor with a balcony overlooking the thirteenth hole. The room was spacious, huge (extremely comfortable) bed and fine big bathroom. 
I booked a spa treatment on the first morning while my boyfriend went on to the driving range. My treatment was a 70 minute mother to be massage and I was absolutely floating after it......all my aches and pains had melted away!
We then took a spin out to Gendalough, thank God for the weather! Should you wish to make this well recommended trip, make sure you stop off at the Wicklow Heather for some food...stunning!
We ate in the bar of the hotel on both nights as we were staying midweek, and like every hotel in the country in January, the restaurant was quiet. The food is second to none, best chicken caesar salad I have ever tasted!
All in all, I had a very relaxing stay and I can’t wait to return to Druids Glen resort! The staff make this place the five star hotel that it is, keep up the great work and I look forward to seeing you all very soon.",5,2012,01,21
238,Not what I expected from a 5 star hotel,"I stayed in the Druids Glen with 3 friends in November 2011.  It was a much looked forward to break away for one night as one of my girls had had a baby the previous August.  On arrival as we were paying cash we were asked to pay up front! the mini bar was empty, we were refused room service food in the bar because the chef was too busy with the dining room to divert from the bar menu even though sandwiches and platter food was on the room service menu.  If we had gone to our rooms we would probably have gotten the food that we wanted.  We had booked one night with a treatment.  My wrap was okay but I didn't feel any different afterwards.  My friends were not as impressed with their treatments.  We had lunch in the bar and the food was nice but a bit overpriced for what's on offer.  And no one asked if we had enjoyed our stay on departure.  All in all a nice hotel and location but a bit ""lacking"" from the 5 star quality we were expecting.  Next time we'll be going back to Carlton House for 4 star treatment.  I did email setting out the above but got a load of excuses by way of response.  I'm afraid we won't be back.  Thoroughly disappointed as I had arranged it as it was somewhere I'd wanted to go for years.  Shame really.",2,2012,01,14
238,5 star luxury,"Really enjoyed our stay in Druids Glen Hotel.  From check in through to bar, restaurant and leisure centre, the staff were very friendly and helpful.  Room was large and comfortable.  What can I say about the food in the restaurant?  From starter to coffee it was excellent.  The service was efficient and friendly. Will definitely be back.",5,2012,01,11
238,What a treat!,"Myself & my boyfriend stayed in Druids Glen in November and loved it.  The room was beautiful and the staff were amazing.  Janet on the front desk, Sunny in the Bar  and all the girls in the spa could not have helped more.  Everyone we encountered was nicer then the next!  If you are ever in Wicklow, go and visit, you will not be dissapointed!",5,2012,01,11
238,Great hotel but has gone downhill in recent years,"Having stayed in this hotel a couple of years ago I was sincertly impressed by the style and quality on offer to the guests.

Beautifully styled and exceptionally comfortable, this hotel is ideal for couple on a romantic break or simply for a weekend away with friends.

Food was fantastic and out suite was out of this world.

Having visited in Christmas 2010, I was very disappointed to see that like many other hotels the recession is hitting hard and the service and quality that was once present has dropped.

On our last visit the bathroom had mould on some parts of the wall. There were stains on the carpet and the windows didn't close properly. This is greatly at odds with the standard of the rooms in 2008.

Disappointing as this was a beautiful hotel that should be returned to its former glory!",4,2012,01,09
238,Beautiful hotel with excellent food and service,"I attended a Christmas party in it's Druids Brasserie restaurant two years ago and I loved this place so I brought my husband to this hotel for dinner on our first anniversary in 2011. We thought there shouldn't be many people because it's the Christmas time, but actually the place was full! It's a pity that we didn't book a table. 

We were quite disappointed when we were told that there wasn't an empty table until 10pm but we still had dinner in there, not in the restaurant, but at the bar. However I have to say that was one of the best dinner ever! 

The food wasn't going down because of ""bar food"" and there were plenty of selections. I had seafood chowder, steak and dessert. My feeling is the same kitchen cook for the guests at both restaurant and the bar. The standard of the food is first class. The steak comes out exactly what I expected and everything we had was divine. 

Both my husband and I had a lovely night. The staff are very helpful and it didn't go wrong by following their recommendations. We'll definitely go back again.",5,2012,01,08
238,Druid's Glen Resort - Best sleep ever,We stayed at the Druid's Glen Resort for six nights over Christmas 2011.  We were having Christmas with family so we did not take part in the hotel's holiday activities - but we could see that the families who were there enjoyed themselves tremendously.  We asked for a quiet room and were given a beautiful room in the back of the resort.   We did not experience the smell of chlorine from the swimming pool as did some other reviewers.  The king size bed had a mattress equal to the bed we love at home.  The linens were beautiful and the windows were fitted with the best black-out curtains I have ever seen.  Several days we slept until 10:00 am - something we never do - especially in a hotel.  Next to our sleep - the best thing about the resort is the staff.  Especially the front desk staff who couldn't do more to make our stay memorable.  One of the front desk staff even drove us to the Greystones train  station so we could get into Dublin for a lunch date.  That's the type of service that insures we will return to the Druid's Glen.,5,2012,01,06
238,Very disapointing stay at Druids Glen,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel in Aug '11.  The hotel does not in any way meet the 5 star rating which it has.  I was most alarmed at the lack of cleanliness in the hotel - especially the showers in the leisure centre.  They were absolutely filthy - with tiles covered in mould.
The service at the hotel was very poor.  When we arrived back from a concert at about 10:30pm we asked for a menu in order to order some food - however it was suggested to us that our best option would be to drive into a nearby town for chips as the hotel had stopped serving food at this time.  It was only after a push that the hotel agreed to do room service - but they insisted that we go up to our room (3rd floor) in order to get the menu for that. 
I would not go back to this hotel and was hugely disapointed with it overall.",1,2012,01,05
238,Fabulous family friendly hotel,"My husband, myself and our two boys of 13 and 10 stayed just one night at the Druids Glen recently but our experience was so enjoyable I felt compelled to post a review.  In my opinion when something is being done well it is important to let them and others know!  The first thing I would have to comment on is the service which was impeccable from start to finish.  Not just efficient but genuinely friendly and pleasant and there is no doubt that this does make a huge difference to your overall experience when staying in a hotel.  The facilities at the hotel were described very thoroughly to us upon arrival which only whetted our appetites and helped to make an excellent first impression.  We booked two adjoining rooms as our children are a bit older and they were both huge, very comfortable and well equipped. The welcome pack (our boys were a bit old but still appreciated the gesture), the games room, the regular movie showings plus of course the pool were most welcome and the general atmosphere everywhere was of a place where families could truly relax but at the same time I think those without families would feel fine and not out of place or intruded upon.  Of course the hotel is renowned for the golf and certainly the golf course looked magnificent.  Unfortunately the walk we took in the grounds simply circled the course and the was largely alongside the main road so that was a disappointment but nobodys fault as naturally the course could not simply be wandered over however lovely it might have looked.  A couple of other minor disappointments were the games room being rather dusty and neglected looking and the movie room having rather uncomfortable looking fold up chairs.  However I hate to even mention those points as everthing overall was so good.  I haven't even mentioned the food yet and it really was fantastic. Our deal included dinner and the boys had the children's buffet with a couple of additions from the main menu.  My husband and myself enjoyed all our courses immensely and it was great to see free range chicken on the menu which is always an issue for me as I like chicken dishes but couldn't bear to eat them if they weren't free range.  I had a delicious chicken caesar salad to start and my husband had scallops.  My main was halibut and my husband's sea bass.  Both absolutely excellent and far beyond regular hotel food.  We finished with creme brulee (superb) and an orange tart (fabulous).  Waiting staff were friendly and helpful and the atmosphere in the restaurant relaxed and lovely.  Breakfast the next morning was excellent too with a huge choice and lovely touches like home made jam and lots of lovely fresh fruit as well as all the usual elements of cereals, pastries, and everthing you might require for a full Irish.  Despite all this we actually stayed for lunch too (we did have a 4k walk and a swim in between!) this time in the bar and this too was absolutely excellent with each one of us more than pleased with our choices and the service once again friendly welcoming and efficient.  On our way home we discussed the hotel - our youngest son declaring he would like to live there! and we came to the conclusion that no matter what is going on with the economy if you are commited to doing things properly then you will get the custom.  We got an excellent deal for the one night including dinner and bed and breakfast but it is the service and an overall experience that would make us go back again and I am quite sure we will do so again soon.  Well done to everyone at Druids Glen.  Keep up the good work and may 2012 bring you all the custom you derserve.",4,2012,01,01
238,Wished for a quiet retreat but instead got a scene from the film Daddy Daycare!,"Post Christmas quiet retreat in a scenic spot - that's what we hoped for. Instead we felt like we had landed in a daycare centre! I love children but Druids Glen resort seemed to take their family friendly policy very seriously indeed, to the exclusion of considering the needs of all their guests ! There wasn't a single area in the lobby, bar, restaurant that was child (noise) free...lovely friendly staff who also seemed to struggle at times in the melee....following the first night in the bar full of children until well after 10pm... we asked if we could occupy a table in the restaurant 30 mins ahead of our reservation just for some peace and quiet we said... The Madame d declined our small request with a breathtaking professional smile - despite the obvious number of vacant tables...we were happy to wait until our reservation time to order our meal...tried to take an afternoon nap same story unruly kids running up and down the corridor....we were at one stage held captive in the lift by a couple of kids who told us that it was 'fun' pressing the wrong buttons....we left after our two day break disappointed, exhausted and wishing that we had researched more before booking...on checking out we stated our disappointment and were informed that there were a record number of children in the hotel on the two nights in question... I have no problem with children/ families but get a grip Druids Glen - try to organise yourselves a bit better - with all the space available it would be very simple to allocate some quiet areas to your more sedate guests....perhaps those two giant jars of jelly sweets complete with additives could be removed from the reception desk to avoid getting the kids more hyper! A few simple boundaries for children (and their parents) wouldn't go astray either... a curfew where children should retreat to being seen and not heard would seem reasonable from 9pm or so?",2,2011,12,30
238,Great Chrsitmas Stay,"Just back from spending Christmas day at the Druids Glen Resort. Second year we have enjoyed Christmas there and once again it could not be faulted in any way. 
The service from the time of making the first enquiry is first rate. No detail is left to chance. The organisation on the day itself is superb and all the management and staff are courteous, professional and friendly. The food is delicioius and the surroundings tastefully appointed and decorated. 10 out of 10 and we will be back next year.  Many thanks.",5,2011,12,29
238,Great Week Away,"We actually stayed in the holiday cottages on the Druid's Glen estate, but had full use of the hotel facilities, which were excellent. The pool area particularly was fantastic, with children made more than welcome; staff even went out of their way to provide floats and toys for our children to play in the pool with. The bar/restaurant area was very comfortable and again, child friendly. The meals served there were average priced for Ireland (which is generally expensive) but good portions and of good quality - the banoffee pie was to die for. If we returned to Druids Glenn I would not hesitate staying in the hotel, although the cottages do offer more flexibility to families in my opinion; you have the best of both worlds.  A great half term break.",5,2011,12,22
238,Birthday Treat!,"My girlfriend and I spend the night in the Marriott on Firday the 16th and I can speak for both of us when I say we had the most amazing night. I booked the one nights B&B pkg with an evening meal. It was my girlfriend's birthday, which I mentioned when booking and upon arrival we were upgraded to a Suite! I was delighted as the suite was more than spacious and they had even left a card saying Happy Birthday with some Lily O'Brien's Chocs, Brilliant Touch!

We were delighted with the service, from check-in, to dinner (Which was delicious), to the bar staff everyone was so friendly and even though there was a wedding going on at the same time the hotel and its staff were well able to cope with the crowd while keeping any other guests satisfied at the same time!

There is so much more I could write but il let you experience it for yourself! 

All I can say is I wish I could return right now and I am sure I will in the near future!",5,2011,12,19
238,Best Staff ever!,"We stayed here last week for two nights in a suite (fabulous). I have no complaints whatsoever, everything was perfect.  The staff were so welcoming, helpful, courteous and friendly from reception, bar staff, cleaning staff, leisure centre staff and spa staff - we immediatly felt at home. (if only my home was like this..! )),.Special thanks to Linda (customer relations), Colin (in the spin class), Gillian in the Spa, the lovely girl in the Pool reception desk, and the fantastic (american?) waiter in the bar.(sorry, I didn't get the names of the receptionists who were really lovely!.
Hopefully we will be back - and soon!,",5,2011,12,19
238,"Amazing staff, brilliant place.","From check in to check out my experience of Druids Glen is wholly positive. Great friendly welcome on check in, amazing food, even from the bar! Rooms are big and clean, lots of nice places to hide and read a book or catch up with friends. Loved every minute of this stay and both myself and my wife will be back soon.",5,2011,12,13
238,Irish charm at an affordable price,"We decided to take a weekend away in November to celebrate our parents' 40th Ruby wedding anniversary and decided to head to the ""Garden County"" for the occassion. Having been to a wedding in The Druids Glen in August and having thoroughly enjoyed the experience we decided to treat our parents who live in Limerick to a weekend in Wicklow.Now  the fact that my Dad,both brothers and my nephew are all avid golfers also swayed the decision somewhat but in fairness there are country walks and the charming seaside town of Greystones nearby for the girls to enjoy as well. 
Well, all in all we all had a wonderful weekend in the Druids Glen resort which was a relief because sometimes it's hard to get a hotel with consistently good standards. Now we were blessed with the weather the Autumn sun shone all weekend and the change of season is particularly breathtaking in this part of the country. We had a round of golf on the Saturday morning and my Dad was chuffed to par the index one thirteenth hole and shocked us all by winning our three ball with shots to spare. The course has to be amongst the top three parklands courses in the country and if you enjoy knocking a ball around 18 holes it's a must to play. The clubhouse is located in a large period building of historical note which could do with a little modernisation to make the most of what is a unique property that probably hasn't reached it's full potential yet. After our round of golf we enjoyed hearty pints and soup in the clubhouse (wouldn't it be great if all golf clubs gave the option of something hot after a long round).
So after freshening up and re-acquainting ourselves with our better halves we headed to the Druids Glen for dinner later that evening. The menu was good and hearty, a little too hearty for one of our female party who said the menu was a little 'mannish' but I didn't complain as I dug into succulent chunks of local Wiclow venison and washed it down with copious amounts of a bracing French red wine recommended by the excellent French headwaiter and sommeIier. 
After dinner the hardened ones amongst us i.e. myself my Dad and younger brother whiled away the early hours of the morning in the hotel bar nicely tucked into the adjoining foliage of the golf course behind.
Breakfast the next morning wasn't for the faint hearted or weak of stomach i.e. the three who decided late night drinks was a good idea. Breakfast in the Druids Glen is definitely worth getting up for no matter how late or gruesome the night before. One thing that particularly caught my eye was the homemade apple chutney and homemade apple and plum jams made by the hotel from fruit harvested from the Druids Glen golf course....Class!!!
The Druids Glen is bucking the current economic trend for a number of reasons mainly it is offering good value and quality and it was interesting to see that most of the guests were Irish families who could afford to spend a few days of luxury away without breaking the bank. 
Well done all and sundry!",5,2011,11,30
238,Great stay ... Looking forward to going back,"Got a great value weekend deal and it was fantastic. Experienced all that Druids Glen had to offer (brasserie, bar, spa and golf) over the weekend and everything was top notch. ",5,2011,11,27
238,"Dated decor but delicious food, good staff and relaxing spa","We were really looking forward to our luxury weekend in Druids Glen.  However, it is truely a 4 star not a 5 star, agree with reviews read before we went.  Checkin was slow as we got mixed up with other guests.  The decor is dated and the room additions which I would have expected were not there e.g bathrobes or biscuits for tea.  There is quite a long walk to find your room once leaving the lift!  The hotel is most definitely a family hotel with lots of activities on offer.  There are a number of hens/stags and large group meetings.  Of course if you are into golf, you are definitely in the right place.  Post our swim/sauna, we had lovely afternoon coffee in The Thirteenth, very relaxing with a view of the forest.  Later on, we had dinner in the main restaurant which was delicious.  For starters, we had Gaelic Seafood Chowder with extra bread.  Our waiter was most attentive of our needs during our dining experience.  I had the special starter - duck, tasty but too many beans.  Main courses were 10 oz Grilled Irish Strip Loin Steak and I had the Monkfish  - both cooked perfectly and truly delicious.  All of this was accompanied by a fabulous Don David Malbec from Argentenia.  Dessert was Poached Pear and Creme Brulee, very satisfying.  We would recommend dining in Druids Brasserie - a very enjoyable experience.  I availed of a Deep Tissue Massage which was one of the best I ever had, such a quiet relaxation room with very accommodating staff.  Breakfast was very well presented with plenty of variety to choose from for all pallets - lots of delectible breads, fruit, juices, hot breakfast with complimentary Sunday Independent.  We would highly recommend a weekend in Druids Glen from a relaxation, spa and beautiful setting point of view.  With lots of deals on, why don't you skip down to Druids Glen in the new year.",4,2011,11,16
238,Very Good,"Spent Halloween weekend here with the family and we all had a great time. It was recommended to us as a child friendly resort and I must say it lived up to it. The hotel was spotless and the rooms were spacious and comfortable. The staff were all friendly and the food was excellent. The spa was nice though a bit dated and the location was ideal for a trip to Dublin. I can't comment on the golf course as we didnt use it, but it has a good name. I would definitely recommend it as a family hotel.",4,2011,11,15
238,Nice stay but but but but.......,"Just back from a two night stay and was my first at a 5 star and my expectations were high..
At first I was a little flat as it didn't quite live up to the picture I had in my head.. We were a family of 2 adults and two young children ages 5 and 2 we were also meeting up with family who also had young children. When we arrived we were greeted and welcomed in a nice friendly manner and were processed fast and efficiently. The children were given a little colouring pack which was nice

Our room was in the smoking section of the hotel!!! We weren't asked if we are smokers in fact we are not I hate smoking and the room had that smoked in smell and feel. yuk.. I didn't complain as I am Irish and two young children at toe keep you from worrying about such matters. I expected a bit more from a 5 star room... It was nice and clean but not palatial a little smaller than I expected but okay we were only sleeping there after all. Bathroom was nice but not really 5 star stuff a big crack in one of the tiles - toilet was a bit close to shower and bath was small no room for two...
Outside on the corridor there was a chlorine smell from the pool and it was quite stiffling in fact the air flow was poor in this section of the building I'd say it is a design flaw and I am sure that the management are only too aware of this.. The foyer was okay but nothing to get excited about more functional than fantasic. The restaurant was nice and the food was good quality although on night 2 the pork was overcooked / dry and hard after a long wait. Childrens play room was poor - a big room with a few games thrown in.. This was mid-term week lots of families and the weather was poor so too was the effort by management to entertain and cater for children. Pool was not great - staff a bit apathetic... changing room poor - some of lockers need a bit of attention - pool was just okay a bit small but nice views out of a large arched window. 
On the positives - staff very friendly and hardworking.. Easy to get to just off main roads.. Nice walk along fringe of golf course but children are not allowed.. Excellent play area outside for children. Nice restaurant and food was good quality maybe a little expensive but quality comes at a price..the guests were very friendly and the hotel had a nice safe feel to it. I know this area of Wicklow and a short drive away will bring you to some of the best scenery in Ireland Glendalough being a very special place. 
I have stayed in 4 star hotels before and apart from the food I could see very little differnce between the Druids Glen and my 4 star experiences.. I'm not a golfer but did note how fantastic the golf course looked... Overall I did enjoy my stay and I did get a fantasic deal so for the two nights and I probably would go back if offer the same good deal but would insist on a non smoking room.......",4,2011,11,04
238,perfect stay,"We only live 15 mins away from the hotel , we pass it most days on a school run. My husband won a voucher , so we decided to stay during mid-term {lots of children} when booking our room we asked if it was possible to be in a quiet part of the hotel . On  arrival we were met by a very friendly member of staff at the check-in desk who welcomed us and then informed us that we were upgraded to a suite at no extra charge.
This was a very nice surprise and when we went to our room we could not believe it,the suite had its own sitting room with a gas fire and through sliding doors was the biggest bed we have ever seen.
We went to the""13th bar"" for a relaxing drink and again the staff could not have been more helpful,from sitting us at a table overlooking the 13th hole at Druids Glen to the fact that we never had to leave our table to get a drink.
We had a table reserved in the"" Druids Brasserie""and from starter to dessert it was, for both of us, one of the best meals that we have ever had.Local produce cooked perfectly. 
The Hotel was very busy and deservedly so but even the fact that it was mid-term and that lots of families were on holidays we still felt like we were the only couple in the hotel,so instead of going elsewhere for a short break in the future we will be going to go back to the"" Druids Glen Resort""and we cant wait.",5,2011,11,04
238,Surprised at how much i enjoyed it!,"overall a wonderful stay at druids glen.  I expected a large impersonal hotel but found an intimate, friendly and enjoyable place that I will definetly return to.

We booked some time ago for a bank holiday weekend and expected very little but received a well organised package that catered for our 7 and 10 year old perfectly!  hamleys on site with pumkin carving to boot - they were delighted with themselves.
Rooms spacious, very clean and although it's a large hotel (that was fully booked), it felt more intimate and all the personal attention you usually receive with a smaller hotel group.  OK I agree it doesn't have the 5 star feeling but it doesn't come with that price tag either so if you take that into account you will be happily surprised!
lots to do locally - esp wicklow gaol!.  Eat in the bar - food fab and service excellent. Main restaurant very good albeit the service was a little slow on the night (which management were quick to spot and compensate us for) - just be sure if you do not have kids to ask to be seated inside in the quieter zone!
we will be back, a lovely stay.",4,2011,11,03
238,Wonderful Place,"We were here the week of October 14th - and it was wonderful. 
The hotel was very clean and very helpful. They never missed a wakeup call. It was a little strange there were no alarm clocks in the room, but if you can get over that, it was top notch! 

The restaurants were delightful. I am not a fan of the traditional Irish breakfast, so I stuck to the more Continental items. The chocolate crossaints were to die for and the raspberry jelly/jam was so good, everyone was raving about it! 

The cajun chicken sandwich in the bar had the BEST mayo and the fries were unbelievable. If you eat here, it would be a crime not to order the fries, or ""chips"". They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, hot and fresh ... and wonderful when salted. A ++++

We loved our stay here. The staff went out of their way and were like family by the time we left. It was an increditble time!",4,2011,11,03
238,Poor standard of rooms,"5 star? Wasn't so sure after staying here.
Room somewhat shabby and certainly not cheap (booked a suite).
A lot of insects in room also. Reported to staff before check out and also on follow up satisfaction survey, offered free upgrade to suite on next stay  but don't think I'll be back.

On the plus side, very friendly staff and beautiful food in restaurant ",3,2011,11,02
238,"Nice hotel, wonderful staff","I recently enjoyed a 2 night stay in this hotel, we requested a non smoking room but on arrival to our room there was a very strong smell of smoke. We rang reception and within 5 minutes they had sent a staff member up to move us to a neighbouring room which I am glad to say was odour free. I was impressed with how quickly the problem was resolved. The hotel has lovely grounds with a pathway marked out so guests can go for a nice stroll, we really enjoyed this.
Food in the hotel was good, the bar area has a conservatory where we had dinner on the first night. The food was nice and the bar was cosy and comfortable. Our waitress was so friendly too which was nice.
Breakfast in the hotel was only okay, I felt the hot buffet wasn't of a very high standard but that was just my opinion. Nice selection of pastries & breads etc, free newspapers for guests too at breakfast which was a nice touch.
Dinner in the restaurant was nice too but not amazing, kind of what you would expect when you are on a weekend all in package.
I will definitely return to this hotel, the surroundings are lovely if you want a relaxing break and it was good value for money. The staff were all lovely too and that definitely makes a difference.",4,2011,10,31
238,Paradise in Wicklow,"Stayed in the hotel for the first time last week to celebrate the wedding anniversary and wife's impending 40th birthday.

We were delighted with our choice of hotel, warm friendly staff, great food dinner was excellent and breakfast exceptional.  We enjoyed the pool and spa and were impressed with the facilities and cleanliness.  Ideal for a romantic get a way and for families.  During our stay we were able to explore local villages, Bray and Greystones and further afield to Powerscourt.",5,2011,10,30
238,5 STAR HOTEL????,"We spent a spa weekend with my friends. I have travelled worldwide and stayed in all type of accomodations and this hotel was a pure disappointment. The decor of the hotel was cheap and above all the hotel was old and not very well maintained. The fountain outside had litter floating in the water, windows dirty, lamps in the reception with cobwebs, the glass cabinet with glass display was dusty and the spa was grubby. The breakfast was just ok and the only thing freshly cooked was an omelette and pancakes. The evening meal was poor due to quality of food used. The chicken was processed! The only positive point was the staff , they were excellent and very accommodating.The spa treatments were average - the body scrub was only done over certain parts of the body with very little product used and more time spent massaging the face!! The fruit that was given after treatement was warm and soggy. So no wowo factor!! I have stayed in better boutique bed and breakfasts and 4 star hotels. So not recommended!",2,2011,10,24
238,Strictly for golfers......,"I recently had the privelege of being taken away for the weekend by a pretty girl. The venue Druids Glen at Newtownmountkennedy outside Dublin.

The location is a benefit or hindrance, depending on your point of view.

On the plus side the countryside is quite lovely. 

The hotel itself is finished to a high standard. Rooms are spacious and nicely appointed, and the facilities include a fridge  (Which can be stocked on request), iron and ironing board, flat screen TV and WI-FI.
The en-suite bathrooms are sumptuous and the accomodation immaculately kept. The staff are polite and helpful at reception.There is a spa with a swimming pool.

Buffet breakfast is to a very high standard and beautifully presented.

The venue describes itself as a resort, so one would expect  shops and entertainment at the least, and this is where the down-side begins.

The restaurants in the hotel are lovely to look at , the food is mediocre and very expensive.

 There's something terribly wrong when a restauarant in Ireland (a country world famous for its beef), needs 45 minutes to serve a greasy burger smelling mostly of offal. The accompanying bun was burnt and too hard to cut with a knife. When I was asked if I was enjoying my meal I pointed to the bun and various other bits on my side plate and said ""lovely"". The waiter did'nt pick up on the remark, but then I suspect his grasp of the language was poor. He definitely was not Irish !
The elderly couple at the next table complained at some length about their food and got free deserts.
I went to the bar which had a One-man band setting up.  I and all the other customrs left when he began singing.

We left the resort and went to Dublin for a day out the following day. It's about 35Kms and as lovely as ever (Takes about an hour by car in the traffic).

We dined that evening in a nearby village at a restaurant called Vinho Pasta.(about 9 kms despite what the roadsigns say) .
Greystones is at the wealthy end of the Dublin commuter belt and has numerous beautiful       ( and quite sensibly priced) restauarants.
The quality of the food and service was outstanding with several seafood specialities to complement a varied menu.

Druids Glen was originally a Marriott golf resort , and if you want to play golf I'm sure it's marvellous.

Otherwise, I'd stay in Dublin or the immediate surroundings. The hospitality is great and everything is so accessible.",3,2011,10,22
238,Great hotel and outstanding golf course,"This is the fifth time I have stayed at this hotel and the second time in a year that I have brought a group of golfers here.  Twelve of us travelled here in September.  We booked a deal which included 3 nights bed and breakfast and 3 rounds of golf (2 at the glen and 1 at the heath).  The courses were superb (particularly the Glen) and a great challenge to low and high handicap golfers alike.

As always the hotel staff from reception to housekeeping to bar were very friendly and nothing was too much trouble for them.  One minor negative - this was the first time i noticed a slight drop in the usual high standards of decor at the hotel (some of the wooden panels in the lifts had started to come away at the edges) I know this sounds picky but it would be a shame if it was the first sign of a slip in standards.

Rooms were spacious with great views and always immaculate.  We had a great trip here last year (evidenced by the fact that we returned so soon) and this year didnt disappoint.  Trust me; if 12 middle aged men can find nothing to complain about between them then the resort has done a great job!

I would recommend this resort to golfers planning a trip who expect the highest standards.",5,2011,10,16
238,better to look at than to experience............,"beautiful location set in beautiful Irish countryside,a warm welcome from friendly staff greats you at the reception,the corridors to the rooms and foyer are clean and modern with comforting fires to sit by and watch the world go by.Our rooms were comfortable and bright,but no better than a 3 star hotel only one bedside table for the twin rooms and one light and no chance of peace when a kick boxing class is being held outside your room!!The bathroom was adequate with nice range of complimentary toiletries but the towels and robes had diffinitely seen better days not exactly white or fluffy..The corridors all smelt of chlorine which was very off putting, the spa was very relaxing but the treatments were very overpriced and fall short of the time advertised I paid for a 70 min treatment but only recieved at most 50 mins although the therapist was friendly and helpful.The breakfast room was shabby with cheap prints on the wall and one particular waitress needed introduced to the concept of a clean uniform and hands when working in a food environment,when i asked for a fresh egg from the chef who was cooking eggs was told to take one from the bain marie the very reason I had asked for a fresh one was  I had already decided I  didnt want to eat a ""ice hockey puck""at least that was what I assumed was in the bainmarie when I previously looked.No fresh coffee which I expected from a 5 star facility instead you had stewed brown liquid in a less than polished flask.
When we asked where were the local attractions were none of the staff could guide us as most were not local and had little to no knowledge of their whereabouts which I thought was a necessity of a good receptionist or concerge.",3,2011,10,16
238,Pure Luxury,"We stayed here with small children for a weekend and found Druids Glen fantastic. At check in the children were given a lovely colouring in activity pack. I thought this was a really nice touch. 

We got a suite with two extra childrens beds. The room was fabulous with a large king size bed & full size single beds for the children. There was two bathrooms in the suite & a beautiful fireplace with armchairs & a couch for relaxing in the evenings with the children after dinner. Druids Glen have free wi fi in the rooms.

We had dinner in Druids Brasserie, the children had a buffet style dinner. This included burgers, sausages, mash, chips & veg. They also got a drink & ice cream after all for free! Hats off to Druids Glen for this brilliant idea. Both my hubby & I had the steak. It was a really nice cut of steak cooked to perfection. 

The breakfast is also fab with a large selection of fresh hand cut fruit & pasteries. You can also have a full Irish but they even have a chef at the end of the buffet to cook you fresh crepes. Again a really nice touch that sets Druids Glen apart from other hotels. 

The children really loved the pool as the air temp in the changing rooms was perfect and the pool itself was nice and warm. I found it really helpful that there was a large room with a chaise longue for getting the children dried & changed after their swim.

Overall there Druids Glen Resort has a certain air of pure luxury & I recommend you book :)",5,2011,10,14
238,Relaxing break,"Stayed 2 nights midweek as a birthday treat, and what a TREAT.  Very efficient, helpful, friendly staff at reception.  Gave plenty of advice on local area and restaurants, even provided detailed typed instructions/map on how to drive to local attractions.  Be warned GPS is not very reliable.  Beautiful breathtaking scenery, and we were lucky to have one sunny day when we drove to Powerscourt. The hotel itself was very comfortable, spacious clean bedroom, really comfy bed, fridge, flatscreen tv.  Good selection at breakfast, freshly cooked eggs which was a nice touch.  Had one evening meal as part of package.  Food was delicious and again the staff were courteous, helpful and very friendly.  Used swimming pool, had spa treatment and my husband played the heath course.  All very enjoyable.  Will definitely return.",5,2011,10,12
238,Fantastic,"My husband and I brought 10 German to play golf in Wicklow for 5 nights from 26th September and we chose Druids because of their 2 courses and relatively easy access to the other courses being played (Powerscourt, Arklow Links and The European). We booked months in advance and thought both hotel and green fee rates were very reasonable. 
From the moment we arrived we only experienced warm, friendly and efficient service, not one complaint from 12 people during the whole stay. We were very grateful for the quick check-in on arrival, as we'd risked booking tee times on the Heath at 2.40pm. Our flight into Dublin landed at 11.45am, we then collected luggage and hire cars, drove to the hotel, checked in and made it to the 1st tee with time to spare. Only one room wasn't quite ready, but no problem, the couple changed into their golfing gear in our room. We'd reserved 6 rooms in total, and all requests were met (smoking/non smoking/king size/twin/ view etc). The reservation team were a pleasure to deal with, nothing too much trouble.
The bedrooms were spacious and clean, plenty of storage space, comfortable beds, and nice bathroom with separate shower and bath. The mini bars are empty, but if supplies are needed, a quick call to reception will provide anything within minutes (or you can bring your own). Bottled water, tea and coffee are replaced free of charge daily. The hotel also provides a room on the ground floor to store golf clubs, which saves lugging them up to the bedroom each day..
Breakfast each morning was excellent, plenty of choice for both continental and full Irish (porridge was yummy). The 2 toasters were a bit temperamental, maybe better for waiter to bring toast to the table when bringing tea/coffee.
We ate in the bar on the first evening and everything was delicious, particularly the fish and chips. The bar was very busy most evenings,but the staff were always friendly and polite and the service was quick.Prices quite high, but no more than most other hotels.If you want a quieter corner,there's a nice area with a log fire and comfy sofas near reception.We didn't eat in the hotel restaurant in the evenings as we'd booked other restaurants  near to the courses we were playing. We can highly recommend the Powerscourt Arms in Enniskerry and The Hungry Monk in Greystones (would probably need to book in advance for the latter).
Both Druids Glen and Druids Heath courses were in immaculate condition, but be warned the greens are very. very fast. My husband is a Golf Pro and has played on many courses during his life, but deemed these to be the quickest he's ever experienced!!
Our visit to Ireland was a first for everyone in the party, but it definitely won't be the last. It probably helped that we had blue skies and sunshine for the first 4 days (an unexpected bonus), but if you're looking for somewhere with a good hotel, testing golf, good food, stunning scenery and the most amazing warm, friendly and generous people, then you can't go wrong visiting Wicklow and using the Druids Resort as a base. We usually organise a different destination for a trip each year, but everyone without exception wants to return to the beautiful Emerald Isle.",5,2011,10,07
238,good & bad...,"it's a big hotel full of golf-players. and it seems, because customers come anyway to play golf, the management wants to safe some money at the wrong place.
reception is understaffed. rooms are ok (we had a suite) but the often mentioned noise problems from neighbour-rooms are known (we had no problem wit this issue).
dinner is at a acceptable level (good but not great). breakfast is bad. good buffet with plenty of food but the feeling in this room is cold, somewhat crammed and it feels not good for a good start in the day in a hotel at such price-level.",3,2011,10,03
238,Excellent combination of old charm and new facilities,"We stayed for two weekend nights at the beginning of September - on a 2 nights B&B plus one dinner package. Good value but not a bargain break. 
This is a relatively new build but it has an old ambience to it. The large foyer with its central chimney stack and open fires on either side give the impression of the ""great hall"" of a Norman Castle. The grounds are basic enough but you can take a nice 60/80 minute rond trip walk around the permeter of the adjoining Druids Glen golf course. The locationis ideal for touring the South Dublin/Wicklow area.
The bar food was good but pricey. The restaurant had a very good menu and wine list. Both our meals on the Sunday night were excellent. There was lovely county and Irish music entertainment in the bar/lounge on the Saturday night. 
We played golf on the Druids Heath course (part of the package) - long and testing but very enjoyable. You can play the Druids Glen course for a supplement. We didn't use the Spa/Pool but on observation it looked to be in good repair and have all the usual facilities available.
Staff were very attentive, pleasant and overall service was very good.",4,2011,10,01
238,Superb  location,Went to my cousin's wedding here last week and had a great time. Rooms were very large with lovely big beds and feather pillows.Wedding room was great as was the buffet breakfast. They have an amazing patio area where on a sunny morning one can have  breakfast or lunch.  Staff were very efficient and friendly. The surrounding woodlands are great if you fancy a long walk. Bring your flat shoes!,5,2011,09,30
238,Unreal views from the Heath,We played golf on the Tuesday and were booked to stay elsewhere but the staff made us feel so welcome that we came back to stay later in the week. The Heath has fab views and it was a lot of fun to play. The Glen was awesome and the hotel has a lovely pool and spa. The golf we played in Ireland was v good value and of a v high quality overall. We had such a great trip.,5,2011,09,24
238,Great Hotel and Golf,"Travelled with a group of Golfers for a two night stay with two rounds of golf and found the whole experience superb. From our arrival until leaving the staff were very friendly in both the hotel and golf courses. Rooms were large and clean and food excellent. Serve a good pint of Guinness too. Played the Heath Course first and it was in wonderful condition but I found the greens very tricky. Didn't think it could get any better until I stepped out the next day unto the Druids course. What a 'gem' and the most fantastic back nine you would ever hope to play. This trip is a 'must' again next year, hopefully in the spring. Oh! did manage a short trip to the spa which was very relaxing but I give the gym a miss.",5,2011,09,22
238,Dissapointing,"Stayed in the holet on the 13th Septhember. On arriaval at the hotel first impressions were fantastic. Recption was beautiful, staff very welcoming and had no problem checking in. All was good. We got the lift up to the 2nd floor to our room, it seemed to be a totally different hotel. The walls were dirty, the room doors were scuffed, just not what I had expected from a 5 star hotel. 

The room itself was fine, very clean and tidy the bathroom was clean and very spacious.

Headed down to the pool for a swim which was good, the pool was quite large for a hotel, steam room, plunge pool, sauna all very nice, as was the jacuzzi until the bubbles stopped and you were able to see the dirt and grit lying in the bottom of it. 

Went to the bar for a few pints,and then got dinner. The food was beautiful i must say but the staff was poor. I ask for more ketchup for my chips and it never appeared. i had to go up to the bar and ask again, by the time I got it my chips had gone cold. We spent a good bit of the evening in the bar drinking and had a few other problems with the staff just being plain lazy, we asked for a sweet menu and the guy never even appeared back to see if we would like anything off it. 

All in all the hotel is alright maybe for a group of lads wanting to play golf but certianlly not what I was after.

Also looking out the smoking area someone could do with fishing the butts and boxes out of the water feature.",2,2011,09,21
238,Great Location and Resort,"My father and I went to Ireland to celebrate his 70th birthday.  We stayed at Druids for our first night and played golf at the Heath course the next day.  We had a great experience.  The resort is very nice, the staff friendly and helpful, the restaurant's food very good, and the golf course superb - and the pub poured a fine pint of Guiness!  I travel frequently and my experience at Druids was as fine as anywhere I have visited.  I will definitely return.  Thank you Druids!",5,2011,09,21
238,Idyllic location,"Stayed here for an overnight with my husband 2 children & my parents for a birthday celebration. The hotel was everything I expected it to be. An idyllic location, a little piece of heaven. We had a family meal for 13 on the evening of 4th, the food was delicious & the kids buffet was perfect for our two little ones, the only gripe I'd have & it's just a little one...as we were the only ones eating in this Monday evening there was no real atmosphere in the restaurant not even background music so I'm sure they could do something to improve this but overall there wasn't one complaint about the food or service.  ",5,2011,09,17
238,Superb resort,"Couldn't fault anything about this hotel. The staff were delightful, every single one. My room was large and airy, with a view overlooking the par 3 12th hole of the Glen. I'm not a fan of hotel food generally but again this was superb.

The Glen course itself was stunning, the most amazing course I've ever played. The Heath course was scenic and tricky. If you are playing both take 1 ball for every point in your handicap.

Just amazing.",5,2011,09,16
238,Dun Ri,"Overall a good experience and value for money. We stayed for two nights bed and breakfast. Room was very comfortable and bed linen luxurious. Room cleaning was non existent ..pull up the bedclothes and away you go!! The staff were very friendly and helpful apart from the young guy making the omlettes in the morning! Breakfast was very good and great variety of foods to choose from. The bar menu in the evening was very limitated. Only one light snack to choose from ..Caesar salad. It was very tasty and served with amazing brown bread. 

The spa was a total let down. Still looking for the aromatherapy scents and relaxing atmospohere....a glorified public leisure centre.  The gym was small and limited but staff were very friendly and approachable.

Lastly we went on a recommended signposted  walk around the ground. Signage was great till 2.4km and then nothing. Apparently many people get stuck and this point. We were very grateful for a lift back in a buggy back to the hotel!!

Overall it was a very pleasant hotel but I would have been seriously disappointed if it hadn't been a bargain!!",3,2011,09,14
238,wedding stayover,"stayed at druids glen at the end of july, found it to be a lovely place . The food was very good, I really like a good breakfast to set me up for the day, and i wasnt disappointed.it was lovely.The wedding meal was super also. I found the staff to be very friendly and helpful, so thanks to all for a great weekend. the only downside for me was i found drinks to be a little pricey!!",4,2011,09,13
238,Nice stay - 5* service but not a 5* feeling,"We stayed in Druids Glen for 2 nights in August on a package of 2 nights B&B, dinner and BBQ.  The service from all the staff was extremely friendly and impeciable. Well done!  Th dinner was much better than expected and was really tasty but the restuarant room is large and soulless. Its definetly not a place for a romantic couple weekend away. The BBQ and the outdoor and conservatory area were lovely. The pool area is as a bit too reminisent of the local gym and the bar/pub area is too much like a old time Dublin pub that is in need of a revamp. It would not encourage you too stay and have another drink. The room was spacious but it did not contain the Spa treatment list or a map of the walk.  The walk was not sign posted properly outside so we ended up walking around the hotel building and wondering was this it!. By the time we organised ourselves to see the Spa treatment list, it was booked out. They also charge extra at the weekends for the treatments which would have put me off a treatment even if there was availablity. Overall we enjoyed our stay but we did not walk away with that ""just been to a 5 star"" warm feeling. If they had a good special offer on we would go back but its not the 'treat yourself' place we were expecting.",3,2011,09,12
238,Top wedding venue.,"Stayed in Druids Glen for two nights in August 2011 for a wedding. Really impressed with the set-up and service during the wedding. All staff were very friendly and didnt mind a bit of banter with all the guests who had drank too much :-). The food was gorgeous and probably the best wedding food i had in a long time.
Leisure centre was clean and was the perefct cure for the morning after. 
The rooms were spacious and well finished but not exactly five star standard.

Great weekend overall but again this was for a wedding so maybe the experience for a normal stay would be different.",5,2011,09,12
238,Excellent All Round,"We visited for a weekend and found it to be excellent!
From the reception staff, to the restaurant.  In particular I found the bar staff to be suberb. Attentive, kind, and knew what we required before we had to ask for it. 
Menu had changed since last time I ate there in May, and it was improved. Delicious!
Well done!",5,2011,09,12
238,Relaxing Break,We stayed with 2 young kids for 2 nights in a standard room. Breakfast was excellent each morning with great freshly made omelettes. Dinner was enjoyable but the bar food in the 13th was poor (dont try the burger). Also visited the spa where deep tissue massage was best I've had in years but the facial was disappointing. Staff were very attentive throughout the hotel and we will visit again.,4,2011,09,07
238,"Warm, Welcoming, Relaxing,","Just returned from a lovely 2 night stay ay druids glen resort.
On arrival we noted the hotel seemed tired and in need of a bit of redecoration but having been wramly welcomed and been afforded the best possible service by both the consierge & reception staff, we realised the slightly dated wall paper was just superficial.
Our room was massive with a large flat screen tv, robes, slippers, & all the usual conveniences.  The bathroom was equally as big with large bath and seperate shower.
The food in the restaurant was outstanding and the service equally as outstanding.
The leisure centre although a bit dated has pool, jacuzzi etc...
The spa is lovely and treatments are reasonably priced.
Bikes are available for guests free of charge if you are feeling energetic and of course wicklow is a walker's paradise.
Druids Glen is secluded and a number of miles from the nearest village so if you are looking for a very lively spot, this is not the place.
if like us, however, you are looking for a nice quiet relaxing break away from it all in nice comfortable surroundings with yummy food then this hotel is ideal.  
We can't wait to go back - o and you can enjoy this resort even if you are a non-golfer !",5,2011,09,05
238,"Excellent Service, Rooms a Bit of a Let Down!","Arrived to a very friendly and genuine welcome from the reception staff. First impressions very good. Found the room very disappointing, lacking the touches one becomes accustomed to in 5* establishments. There were cob webs on the ceiling, there were no biscuits with the tea/coffee making facilities, no real 'luxury' in the room at all, mediocre decor and furnishings. 
Having said all this, the hotel itself was really nice, the BBQ which was part of our package was extremely well done...with the 'extra touches' I expected; prawns on skewers, salads which were a bit more imaginative than normal, etc! And I really must mention the lady who was in charge of the BBQ that night, Fri Sept 2nd. I did not catch her name but she went above and beyond the call of duty for me (in relation to a birthday cake) I cannot praise her enough! 
The breakfast had the 'little extras' I expected also. (eggs cooked in front of you, pancakes with condiments, etc.) However I did find it slightly unusual that guests were expected to make their own toast with one of those industrial toasters that would test the patience of a saint!!
The drinks at the bar were very expensive (€2.80 for a mineral, €5.50 for a guinness) but I expect that in a 5* hotel unfortunately.  
Perhaps had I been more interested in golf or the spa I would not have felt this hotel was definately more a 4* establishment. I expect a certain degree of luxury and felt this was lacking in Druids Glen. I WOULD CERTAINLY GO BACK, it was GREAT VALUE, but the rooms were not what I was expecting!",4,2011,09,05
238,"Soul-less place, none of 5 star trappings","Very disappointing, really only 3 star.  Has zero character and no atmosphere.We have stayed in 4 star hotels like Bellinter and Carton House,so much better than this one.Clean rooms but tired and none of the special things you expect of a 5 star hotel. Not even wine glass in room! No turn down service that I could see. Bathrooms need a make over.

Food acceptable but again not of 5 star standard. However, you will find the prices are 5 star!Childrens evening buffet only consisted of 2 choices-fish and chips or spaghetti, felt kids were shortchanged as most hotels offer kids menu with about 5 choices. Of course reason for this is we were on a dinner inclusive package and kids were not looked after on this. Brought some nice clothes to change for dinner, but did not need them, restaurant is very unglamorous, not place to get dressed up.

Swimming pool very reminiscent of 80's council pool with the orange paint and exposed bricks. All the deck chairs and sun loungers are either chipped or faded and need replacing. Only redeeming feature is that it is warm!

Parents dont get excited about games room, just consists of a meeting room in business centre with couple of games and plasic toys thrown in. No effort has been made to decorate the walls or make it in any way appealing to young children. Of course this is so they can move the games to another meeting room if that suits!",2,2011,08,30
238,Great place for relaxing family break,"Stayed here on a dinner,bed and breakfast rate. The hotel is lovely from the moment you arrive you are made to feel welcome. Children welcomed with a colouring-in pack. They are well catered for with a games room set aside with a mix of table tennis, air hockey and board games available to them to use. The room next door is set up with tv which shows a film in evening and the kids are provided with drinks and popcorn. 
The bar is good with a large comfy sunroom  and adjoining decked outdoor area with patio heaters. If going again I would choose to eat in the bar as we ate in the dining room and the children had to eat from a buffet which although good; spag bol, fish, chips etc meant they had finished long before we had finished our meal. Our 4 course meal took a bit too long at just over 2 hours as the service was a bit slow.
The rooms were good, we had adjoining doubles on the third floor. Good air con and a comfortable nights sleep. 
Pool a bit too crowded, there are family friendly times at which the kids can use the pool which means they all pile in during these times. I didn't use it outside of these times but would advise you if you are travelling without children to avoid it at these times.",5,2011,08,30
238,Wedding of the year thanks to Druids Glen and its staff!!!,"We got married here August 6th and to us it was the best wedding ever.Firstly the wedding coordinator Nessa is amazing at her job and put us at ease the whole way through the big day,next the staff are uber friendly and go out of their way to make your wedding day so special,finally the food was delicious(espcially the banoffi).Dont look any further than Druids Glen if youre looking for a 5 star hotel in Wicklow...you will be treated like royalty for the day!!!",4,2011,08,27
238,Cant wait to get the chance to come back,"Excellent place and the golf courses are brilliant to, great place for a golfing weekend or just to use the spa and relax, food was also top class but can say bar prices may be a bit steep but definately will be back to play the golf, they should be very proud of the service and place they have.",5,2011,08,25
238,"Lovely surroundings, excellent location","My first contact with the hotel was via email, trying to book a few nights away last minute during a peak period. The staff were excellent and quick to resond to every email and soon helped me find a free date.
We stayed here for 2 nights on the excellently priced Sun-Thurs deal of 100euro b+b which just cant be beaten.

The location of the hotel is excellent, less than 2 mins from the motorway and a very short commute to Dublin. The hotel is located within a golf resort and provide the perfect surroundings for a nice getaway.
The staff on arrival were very helpful and friendly. We arrived a few hours early for checkin and were told the room wouldnt be ready for over an hour, but in the same breath she continued to say 'oh a room has just come up as finished being cleaned'. So within a few minutes we were off to the room to relax. As we were travelling with our 5 year old he also recieved a kids pack, excellent idea which most hotels dont do.
We were on the 3rd floor over looking the woods. As we were on the top floor the celings in the room were very high and this made the already large room feel massive and spacious.
The room and bathroom were very clean and provided the comfort and luxury we wanted. I was told during our stay that the hotel will be undergoing a soft funishing refit, but we found very little that needed replacing.
Importantly the beds were clean and comfortable. We opted for a twin room as we had a child so were had 2 double beds.
Breakfast was excellent. Providing a relaxing environment and plenty of hot and cold food to choose from.
We didnt eat in the resturant but the food looked lovely and the bar provided a simple menu for people that wanted informal meals.

*Warning* One evening we decided to set out on the walking route around the hotel. We didnt realise that reception provided a map if asked so we followed the signs around the resort. Easy to follow but we didnt know the route was over 3km long. The walk was lovely and the surroundings again were perfect. However half way around with the sun setting we felt a little lost. So if you fancy the walk, I would recommend it, but ask for the map before.

Also we ordered room service for sandwiches. When they arrived I was shocked at the quality of them. I have had far far better from road side service stations. We ordered cheese sandwichs and what arrived was orange, plastic pre sliced cheese. I instantly complained and asked for grated fresh cheese and within minutes up came lovely perfect sandwiches.

The resort offers lots of family activities and has a kids room with daytime and evening films. There is free wireless to the rooms, but if you ask they also have a computer room that is free to use with a printer.

We did have a bit of noise late at night with guests returning to their rooms after the bar closed. Although there were no weddings etc during our stay, I would recommend checking this before staying if you are wanting a relaxing break, but we do try to also avoid any hotels with weddings on.

Overal our stay was excellent and I would go back. Even though the hotel was competely full we never felt it. Definately a high 4* hotel, not sure about a 5* quite yet. But at the price we paid, you would stuggle to find anything near the quality provided here.",4,2011,08,24
238,"5* location, 4* everything else!","My husband & I stayed in the Druids Glen Resort for one night in July to celebrate our wedding anniversary. We had a citydeal voucher which included a % off a treatment in the Spa or a game of golf. Neither of us are golfers so we used it for a 30min massage. 
The deal was for a Sun- Thur so we used it on a Sunday night. 

We arrived early allowing time to check-in and get to the spa for our treatments. Check-in was fast and friendly and the reception staff were well presented. Our room was at the back of the hotel and a lovely view. The room was big and spacious with table and two armchairs by the window. The bathroom was clean and had eleminis accessories. It also had a spray for your pillow to help you to sleep, nice touch. Oh and chocolates! yum yum!

The pool is on the ground level with a gym overlooking it. The Spa is on the second level. Access between the two is easy via the stairs. I had rang ahead to make the appointment and this was the only available slot where we could be treated at the same time. Clearly a busy place! When we arrived for our appointment, We were shown to one small room for both my husband and I to change in before our treatments, which had one locker. We were due to have our treatments at the same time as per the booking but I was left waiting for 20mins by which time my husband was almost finished. I also would have thought that they would have had a bigger changing area and possibly a seperate area for males and females. Very odd for a 5* hotel.

My massage was good but very short.  I got 20mins. My husband however said his was very good, he got the 30mins and he was very happy with it. I would say that therapists were under pressure as it was busy but its not good to cut the treatment times as clients are not impressed when they pay for 30mins and get 20mins!

After our treatments we went to the pool. It was very busy with families in particular. I guess it was a Sunday afternoon. There was a lane for swimmers which we used. We then used the jacuzzi, steam room & sauna which was not functioning properly. In fact it was cold even after we threw loads of water on it. The decor of the pool area is quiet dated but it is clean. There were no accessories in the changing areas and the soap/shower gels were all empty. There were plenty of lockers and a reasonably sized changing area. Staff were friendly and helpful in the spa and pool area.

The bar menu had a good choice and not too expensive. We lounged and read the papers and had a drink and then later had a dinner in the restaurant. The menu was lovely and had a few dishes by Catherine Fulvio. The winelist was extensive also. The food was lovely, could not fault it. Staff were helpfull and friendly.

Breakfast was lovely and was in the restaurant area. There was an extensive hot and cold selection from cold meats, fruit and yogurt to omelletes and choice of full Irish. Service was good although we had to ask for coffee and for cuttlery!

The best thing about Druids Glen for us was the location and food. Just about 30mins from Dublin and a beautiful setting surrounded by the golf course. 

The worst thing for us was it was not a 5* service. More like a good 4*. They could certainly learn something from some other 5* hotels in Ireland and should do so. When you pay for 5* you like to get it. Many hotels are awarded 5* because they have a spa and pool area. It should be on service primarily in my opinion! Put simply Druids Glen falls short. We will not be returning because there are better hotels out there and for better value! Judged as a 4*, I would say it was very good - Excellent!",3,2011,08,22
238,money well spent,We stayed her for 3 nights on a dinner package.  I was expecting more from the reputation it once had. Hotel rooms are nice and big. Hotel staff nice. Service at dinner was slow.   But I did enjoy my stay and it was worth what we payed.,4,2011,08,20
238,"Nice hotel but not a family resort , unless you all play golf!","Current family deal secured us a good deal including one night dining at the hotel. Rooms very nice, spacious. Pool facilities really excellent. Breakfast buffet average, dining in the evening nothing special,3 star at best, and overpriced as surroundings are more dining hall than restaurant  but free buffet for children a nice  touch. Staff pleasant. ",4,2011,08,19
238,Family friendly,Stayed for 2 nights BB and one dinner with husband and two children aged 5 & 9.  Very warm helpful check-in. Kids were given activity packs but only suitable for under 7's. Good sized room with all the previous owners (Marriott) bedding etc. Kids well catered for with golf lessons and sports activities.  Games room reasonably well equipped.  It was a shame that some kids trashed the room and  they or their parent didn't tidy up after themselves.  Breakfast was fantastic with so much choice.  Coffee also deserves a mention as at some hotels it tastes very bland and it was very good.  Dinner was also good in the brasserie but too rich to eat in there every night.  Limited choice if you don't like the brasserie menu for the evening. No evening bar menu. Pool area good but busy.,4,2011,08,15
238,Very welcoming staff and a great atmosphere about the place.,"My wife and I recently stayed here for 3 nights and was very impressed with everything about the place. The staff were so friendly and nothing was too much trouble. There was a great atmosphere about the place, it was very family friendly and certainly not stuffy or pretentious. The food in the restaurant was fab and good value for money. We will definatley be going back again.",5,2011,08,14
238,Nice.................................but...........................,"Spent 2 night break

Hotel - very nice - not sure if this is still a Mariott resort. There are areas inside and out that are now a bit tired but on the whole it is a very high standard. Comfortable large rooms.

Lots and lots of children under 10 at this time of year- Spa swimming pool is a bit of a leisure centre or school playground before 6.00PM

Breakfast - excelent standard................but the hotel clearly struggles to cope when the above-mentioned kids/families descend and you do have to wait. and the normally good service is absent due to the large numbers.

Dinner- we eat in the hotel restaurant both evenings- really high standard of food and service and not prohibitively expensive. 

Spa treatments- my wife tried to book, but alas nothing available which was very disappointing for a supposed 5* outlet (not to mention the loss of revenue the establishment seem content to throw away).

Overall a very nice place to stay. I wouldn't say it was 5* , maybe 41/2 *- but would try again (when the school hols are over)!!",4,2011,08,12
238,really nice hotel very relaxing,"enjoyed two day break here rooms smell really fresh
the evening meal in the bar was quite small for me could do with more potatoes and veg with the lamb otherwise a lovely retreat",4,2011,08,12
238,A wonderful hotel. We will be back soon,"We arrived here for a two night stay.   2 adults 2 children. Check in was efficient. I had requested a park view. A rollout bed and spa treatments, Dinner reservation, all of which were ready for us. We were all offered iced lemonade and the children got goodie bags of colouring books etc.  We were given the menu of kids activities for the week ahead.   Upon entering the room there was a towel in the shape of a swan on the bed which was a great novelty. The room was a great size for two double and a single bed. Tea making facilities are also available in the room. Pool open to kids all day except 12-3pm which is brilliant. Even though hotel was full while we were there, it never seemed crowded. There us a great games room for toddlers and older kids. Also pool table which requires a euro coin.  Free Internet and two computers available for use by guests. Breakfast very good. Including pancakes made to order. But worth going there for the smoked salmon alone. Restaurant meal for two was approx E90 and kids ate free. Excellent buffet. All v fresh. Creamy mash chicken, home made burgers, mixed veg. Also could order plain pasta or spag bol for the kids. Excellent standard, which I was surprised at having read previous reviews. They must have really up'd the standard. Coffee and pasteries available in foyer til 11. Hotel has bikes to borrow free.  Different sizes and helmets. We paid 198.00 for 2 nights b&b for the four of us. Included was a 50 euro spa treatment each  so effectively b&b wad 98 euro total. Incredible value. Tips. : arrange all your requirements including spa Treatments in advance. Only negative. Reception staff a little abrupt to guests at times. One person enquired about foyer breakfast coffee at 10.45 and was told it was over. Despite being told it was there til 11, no effort was made to direct the person to the breakfast room etc. And not very nicely communicated either.  I attended the spa a few times. The receptionist seemed to be having her lunch at the desk. I had to request a robe twice before it arrived, without slippers. Also the receptionist wore high heels which made lots of noise as she passed through the timber floor of the relaxation room. However these points are easily rectified with training.  U must stay here at least 5 days. So much to do and see. We will be back to this great hotel.",5,2011,08,10
238,Hotel Con,Returned last week from 2 day offer break booked through travelzoo which was to include 50 euro credit each day for our room for using the spa or golf. When we arrived at reception and tried to book the spa treatments we were told they were full up and should have booked them in advance and we should have been told this when we booked WHICH WE WERE NOT. I asked could we use the credit in the reataurant instead and the receptionist said no this was not allowed and offered us no alternative ways of using the credit.My wife was really disapointed as she was looking forward to the treatments. My sister in law who booked the same trip this week booked her treatments in advance as we advised her as she also had not been informed. she rang us and said she got her treatment on the first night and when she went on the second day they told her they were double booked and had forgot to inform her and offered no alternative. Although the hotel was beautiful and bar staff in particular were fantastic i would have reservations in recommending it as customers should not be conned into offers that the hotel will not live up to as money and treats are hard to come by in this economic climate and you should always get what you pay for.,3,2011,08,09
238,Absolutely fantastic!!!,"Stayed for 3 nights and had a great time.  Staff were fantastic.  Great breakfasts, good gym and great facilities.  loved the chocs at night.  They also left a birthday card in our room for my wife!!!  excellent.",5,2011,08,04
238,We loved it and we'll be back!!,"Myself and my husband just returned from Druids Glen after a 3 night stay for our wedding anniversary. All I can say is from start to finish it was amazing..Staff are so friendly and helpful, you dont have 2 get up of your seat for a drink because before u glass is empty the bar staff are around asking if u want another 1..Breakfast was 1st class as was dinner..The scenary around the hotel is beautiful for a walk and they  have bicycles for guest use to which we took for the day! Bedrooms are spacious with the most comfortable beds ever..All in all druids glen really does deserve 5* status and we will definately be returning!!",5,2011,08,03
238,"Loved, loved, loved it!","My husband and 5 year old son and I went for 3 nights to Druids Glen in May. As it was my husband's birthday present I booked a suite. When we checked in the girl came around the desk to us and went through where everything was and gave us a kids welcome pack. We were absolutely delighted with the room , it was spacious and very, very nicely decorated and even with the rollaway bed, it didn't feel in any way cramped. There was a separate sitting room with double doors so we could put our son to bed at night and read in the sitting room without disturbing him. There was also a tv in the sitting room too. The package I'd booked had dinners included every night and the restaurant staff were above helpful. Every night they brought out my son's food first so it would be cooled down by the time ours arrived. There were cinema nights every night for the kids and a play room during the day with football tables and toys. The swimming pool is lovely too, and really warm. We had a gorgeous time and would hope we can visit again very soon.",5,2011,07,30
238,"Luxurious , felt pampered","This is our second time coming to druids glen as a family and it is second to none. The beds and rooms are so spacious and comfortable. The staff are efficient and friendly, the food is delicious and there is a huge variety for breakfast to suit all tastes. I would advise if you want a spa treatment to book it asap as it gets booked up very quickly.",5,2011,07,29
238,"Fab Hotel, Top Class","I stayed here recently for a friend of mine's wedding. I really could not fault the setting, the service, the atmosphere & the food. It was most enjoyable. I had an extremely spacious room with a very comfortable bed. The only negitive about the Druids glen was they place a 'delivery charge' of e5 for a bottle of water to your room. A little bit much in my view, that service should be provided free of charge. All in all a wonderful stay and I would heartily recommend to friends and family.",4,2011,07,27
238,FANTASTIC!!!!,"Simply superb from start to finish of our 3 day stay. Hotel, staff,food, location all excellent, couldn't find any fault. We will definitely be back and hopefully very soon.   
Pat N from Athlone",5,2011,07,21
238,"Excellent hotel, expanse but you get what you paid for!",Excellent food and surrounding. I can not think of a single fault.,5,2011,07,19
238,First class relaxation for couples. Excellent conference venue.,"We stayed in Druids Glen on numerous occassions - as a couple and also on business while attending a conference nd company Christmas party. druids Glen is a tuly mystical place and you surely fall under the spell. The staff are fantastic and accommodating and even though we had gone through some trouble during our fist stay when it came to the spa reception, the manager was quick to rectify the inconvenience by offering us a free pass for the next visit. The facilities are superb even though we were missing a bit of an essence in the aroma room but other than that no complaints. The food is spectacular and the service is second to none. The sleeping quality is a chapter on its own - the place is so tranquil and relaxed, you are ready to fall asleep on the couches in the main lounge - which BTW are extremely comfortable. The exterior is very appealing and the golft pitches are superb. It is a great place to host a conference but if you are thinking about having your company Christmas party over there, just make sure ALL of your staff fits into the main room - ours had to be scattered to the surrounding hallways and if you can imagine thi was mid-January and with the smokers always opening the doors, it was freezing cold and very hard to enjoy your meal. Other than that - fantastic place to unwind. Well worth the 5  star rating.",5,2011,07,19
238,Lovely place to go and get away from it all....,"Went back for wedding anniversary and as always the service and staff were second to none. Nothing is ever a problem and staff are always willing to help. Food in the restaurant was really good, monkfish the best I've had in a long time. One tiny issue was that we were in a smoking room and I found the smell difficult the first night, however the room was ionised on the second day of our stay. Overall a lovely weekend.",5,2011,07,18
238,Wow!  Luxury at it's highest!  I can see why it's a 5 star!!,"Only stayed here for one night - myself & the hubby  - so cannot comment on use of a lot of the facilities.  However, the hotel itself is stunning.  The stafff treat you like royalty.  The hotel is on a golf course and has clearly earned it's 5 stars from the cleanliness, the decor, the staff, the food and the accomdation being well above average standards for even the fussiest of guests!  Upon entering the reception, I just thought, ""wow""!  When I went to the room we were wowed even further!!  Luxury is too small a word.  I would highly recomment this hotel to guests looking for a luxurious, relaxing and romantice stay away from home.  I'm not so sure it would suit a family bringing their kids to stay here as it's quite posh and fairly quiet and lots of couples etc. although I could be wrong as we didn't have the kids with us on this occasion so cannot talk from experience on that front.  Either way, this hotel is amazing!!!  I fely like royalty and would definitely go back there - FAB!!!!!  5 STARS ***** most definitely!!!",5,2011,07,18
238,Great relaxing break.,"Just returned after a relaxing 3 night stay at Druids Glen.  This is our second visit and we enjoyed this trip even more than the previous one.  The rooms are very spacious and clean and the 42"" plasma screen TVs and a welcome addition.  We also had DVD players in the adjoining rooms which were great as it kept the children occupied while we were getting ready for dinner.  Decor is starting to look a little tired but it certainly hasn't put us off as we have booked again for August.

Our children enjoyed the ping pong and pool table and although they didn't go to the 'cinema' we did look in and the free popcorn and juice seemed to be going down well.

Food is expensive but delicious and my only gripe would be that service on our first evening was really slow - think our waiter forgot about us at one stage, however there were two large parties as well as other diners so perhaps then were busier than normal.  As for the children's buffet, it was ok.  Sunday night was Spaghetti bolognese and chicken goujons which was fine but Monday night was sausages and burgers (as per the previous poster) which my daughter loaths.  Unfortunately she wasn't too happy when we spotted the table next to us having pasta and sauce but I suppose I should have asked (will know for the next time).

All in all we had a great time - there are lots of things for children to do and the golf is wonderful.  Staff are all very friendly and helpful - nothing is too much trouble.",4,2011,07,18
238,definitely not 5 star read this if you have children,"We stayed after taking one of the family deals (2 nights, 2 adjoining rooms, b&b with one evening meal for us all) on the 11th and 12th July, myself my wife and our two boys, 5 & 8. The staff I have to say were excellent and very friendly and accommodating. Was surprised though in a supposedly 5 star hotel there was no concierge. Anyway, the setting was superb the location also, the hotel now a little ""tired"" and certainly doesnt warrant a 5 star rating, who gives this rating I dont know.
Our main gripe was the childrens food. When we arrived for our meal on the Monday night we were told by the manager on duty that the children would be eating from a buffet. On inspection the choice was cheap burgers, even cheaper sausages, chips and peas and sweetcorn. As we had seen a kids menu earlier this came as a bit of a surprise. Anyway, we ordered, the kids got some food and then a very helpful waiter came over to ask us were we happy with the kids meals to which we replied, NO.He then said he could organise some pasta with fresh tomato sauce which was gratefully received. This waiter and a subsquent waitress said they were embarrassed by what they had to serve to the children and a few of the families looked enviously on as our kids tucked into something which they had not been offered.
At that point the restaurant manager came over to us to ask our opinion, (adult food was good but I would not like to have been paying rack rate for it because it would not have warranted the price) at which point I took issue with the choice and quality of the kids food to which she replied ""well sure all kids eat these days is burgers and sausages, thats why we serve it"". I explained that not all kids eat this and our choice as parents would be"" yes"" to give them these dishes once in a while but would prefer a healthier choice if available"". I asked about the menu and was told that if I had wanted the menu for the kids all I had to do was ask!!! I was astounded, I come to a supposedly 5 star resort and am told that if I want the kids menu I should ask for it, amazing!!! Interesting also to note that a famly that were seated as we were ending our meal were given the full kids menu..
I may sound long winded but lets be honest a five star resort should be that, good accommodation, good food, good service. The only thing I would compliment Druids Glen on is the good service, their staff so them proud.
Would I go back? NO, would I recommend? If you like golf and arent too concerned about everything else then its a great place but I have to say even with the ""deal"" it certainly doesnt live up to expectation.
You may think that this is long winded but lets be honest, its only with the comments from guests constructive or complimentary that hotels either get the recognitiion they deserve or the criticism that they need to change.",3,2011,07,15
238,"Lovely Hotel, Family Friendly, Great Staff","We stayed here from 9 - 13 July for a family break and had a fantastic time.  Hotel room was very spacious with two queen size beds and sitting area, large bathroom with bath and separate shower unit and large flat screen tv.  Also had a fridge which was great for snacks for the kids and chilling drinks etc.

Staff were very friendly and helpful and the surroundings were beautiful with a bit of space for the kids to run about without making a nuisance of themselves. 

Games room could do with a bit of attention, the games are a bit dated looking although kids did enjoy one of the DVD nights and it was also possible to borrow DVD's from reception to play in the room.  Pool was great fun for the kids with a good selection of floats and aids and while kids are restricted to 8-12 am & 3-7pm, we found this ample time for us.

Enjoyed a few drinks at the bar but have to say it was very pricey €5.50 for a pint of Guinness.  Really enjoyed breakfast time, great selection of cold and hot food although very busy between 10-11 am but that is to be expected.  Didn't eat in the hotel otherwise as food was very expensive and although kids eat free in the Brasserie we found it more enjoyable and economical to eat locally in either Newtownmountkennedy or Kilcoole.

Altogether a great time would have little to complain about and would recommend this to any family with young or older kids.",4,2011,07,13
238,Resort?  What about the Golf ??,"Wow!  What an outstanding course.  But that's an understatement.  There is no way to describe how absolutely beautiful every tee box, green, and turn are.  AND challenging.  This is the nicest, cleanest,.....everything.....course I have ever seen - including from pictures and television.  It is kind of sad to know that I will never play a course this nice ever again. 

If you are in Dublin, you MUST travel down to visit & play this course.  But few will know about it....",5,2011,07,12
238,Some dismissive and unhelpful staff,"Definitely not the service one would expect from a five star hotel. Dismissed from the dining room (after walking us around entire room) - advised they didn't have enough room to accommodate us (family of five adults). Told to wait in front reception for 10 mins. Larger parties subsequently taken in while we still waited. Informed receptionist of situation...was loudly told ""the hotel was very busy so just take a seat and you will be called when a table is ready"". After another 10 mins and several more guests being accommodated we approached dining staff again and eventually was allowed in. By this time much of the food selection had diminished and we had to hurry through our meal in order to meet booked golf and spa appointments. Disappointing dining experiences throughout our stay - could not verify this hotel as being five star in comparison to others nearby.",3,2011,07,10
238,Fantastic Trip,"Just returned from a short trip away to Druids Glen, and must say this was a brilliant trip that was enjoyed by all the family.  Druids Glen has something for all, golfing for the dads and spa for the mum.  We managed to make almost full use of the facilities on offer at the resort and will be visiting again.  Booked through TravelZoo and this made the trip very good value for money.  The staff are numerous and very pleasant and helful.  We even made use of the babysitting servie for a few hours.  Food for the kids was free in the main restaurant and the food was good quality but could be expensive, but we were in a 5 star hotel so to be expected.  My only issue was the swimming pool which may not be the best for small children as it is 1.2 meters deep and there is no shallow end.  One of the best short trips awa for a long time",4,2011,07,05
238,Heavenly,"We were a group of 5 girls attending Druids Glen for a pamper weekend & pampered we were.  We all were pampered from the moment we stepped foot in this beautiful hotel. Everybody was so warm, welcoming and friendly.  Spa treatments were excellent and great value.  The food was fabulous from the breakfast, afternoon tea to the superb dinner.  The attention to detail was fantastic.  We definately will be back.  Thank you so much to all that made it a very special weekend!",5,2011,06,30
238,Big Family Affair Couldn't be accommodated in a hotel of its cailbre,"I went out for Dinner in this Hotel on a warm sunny evening when visiting Dublin. I was here for a milestone wedding anniversary party.It was my intention to book into a room after the dinner and stay the night, however, the food, service and staff attitude was so poorly received that I decided against staying in the end. 
We initially order 10 or so drinks from the lounge girl who took in excess of 20 minutes to arrive with the drinks. She was unpleasant and unhelpful
We had a table booked for 16 people and when they showed us into the table there was not enough seats at the table for everyone. We then proceeded to order as a large group which was fine, until the food arrived out and the waiters had no idea who was having what and what was going where. Once we tucked into our mains approximately 15 minutes later our sides arrived out. This was enough for me and I decided against spending the night at this resort. 
There was little to no fuss made by the staff to ensure that this milestone anniversary was a success, thus in this capacity and as a large group I will not be returning.",3,2011,06,29
238,Not suitable for people with mobility difficulty,"I booked this hotel for a weekend with a relative. My relative is confined to wheelchair. When booking this hotel, I specifically asked if it was suitable for people with restricted mobility and was told that it was and that a room in the hotel was specially adapted for the disabled person. However, on arrival, check was excellent and staff were both helpful and friendly. The room however was not as described when I booked. The only disabled supports were two bars in the bathroom. What we expected in the specially adapted room was at the very least a walk-in shower. The standard also requires a raised toilet, wide door entry to name a few. It was not possible for my relative to have a shower as the shower was in the bath.

Secondly, the evening meal was good, however the same menu for the third night was not acceptable in a 5 star hotel. We left and had dinner in a local recommended restaurant.

Finally, the overall hotel was nice, but having stayed in may other 5 star hotels, I felt this fell slightly behind. When checking out, I was asked if I enjoyed my stay, I mentioned the many shortfalls in the room, and to my surprise, the receptionist admitted that the hotel was reviewing their rooms with a view to upgrading one to suit the needs of the disabled.

Pity we were not told this valuable information when booking!!",3,2011,06,28
238,great place,"this is a great hotel food is great and its a nice and peace full there,the staff are more than helpful in recommending places to go and taxi to get you there,great palce for all you golfing people and there was lots of people there for golf,which was great in the night time for the craic in the night time in the bar lots of singing,all and all we loved this hotel",4,2011,06,25
238,Excellent,"Just want to stay a big thanks to the hotel staffs for a fab stay in your hotel onthe 28th of may. We were a party of 10 girls away for 1 night. We all have very young kids and 3 of the girls were pregnant, we were looking forwad to a nice treatment good food and a full nights sleep.
The check in was so fast 5 double rooms, the rooms were really big two double beds in each great bathrooms , we were all on the same corridor.. 6 of us had treatment which were fab lovely relaxation room, again the staff were so nice.
That evening we had champagne in our room the hotel provided the glasses at no extra  charge. The evening meal was excellent , the menu was great the services was second to none, everything was eaten . After dinner we went to the bar for a drink there was a trad band playing one of the girls plays guitar so she joined in we ended up having a great session.
The next morning at breakfast the staff had a large table for us so we could all sit together.Its the litle things like these that make it a great hotel.
Everyone really enjoy the stay and we would definitely be back again
Thank you . Great hotel and wonderful staff",5,2011,06,23
238,"great hospitality, great location, friendly staff, with a few niggles","This review could so easily have been a 5 star rating , but  sadly it was not .

We stayed here over February half term with the children, we have stayed before and had a great time, so had no hesitation in re booking.

 We were upgraded to a suite which was fantastic. Seperate lounge area for the kids to sleep in, 2 televisions which could have done with an upgrade to flat screens , but overall really impressed with the room. 

We arrived a little early reception were fantastic, made a fuss of the kids gave them a welcome pack told us about the facilities laid on for the children upstairs and mentioned housekeeping would be along this afternoon to put kids beds in.
so we checked in saw our great room loads of towels, biscuits bowl of fruit, white company shower products, enough to sink the battleship so all good.

We went to the games room to check it out, it was a real shame, it was a little bit of an after thought, table tennis table broken, no balls, just a bit of a let down, so off to the pool, there are limited hours for the kids so be aware, nice changing rooms and nice size pool, all one depth so no paddling area for younger kids but woggles were available if you could find them in the cupboard. nice sauna, steam and plunge pool, a few beds around the poolside. the Water temperature was a real issue absolutly freezing and as the pool has no lifeguard if you wanted to find the one member of staff you had to go back through to reception so we just mentioned it whilst leaving.

kids had there tea in the bar area, loads of food enough for an adult, staff were great really friendly even with a rugby match on in the background, we ordered chicken wings at the same time which came out and where cold obviously cooked in advance and reheated, well not reheated in our case, they were replaced and an apology was received. food and drinks is expensive in the hotel you dont get change from about 12 euro for a glass of wine and a pint, kids food also a little pricey.

Breakfast Sunday morning served until 11am amazing, free newspaper delivered to the door nice hot shower, pressure a little disappointing but fine, went down for brekkie at 9.15 not too busy and filled our boots on the delicious buffet all you cold possibly eat and more cant say anymore absolutely great for buffet style fresh inviting and tasty.

My niggles.Sunday night kids dvd cinema experience upstairs advertised in the kids pack was again a let down, if you are going to offer something make sure its ready, we went upstairs nothing prepared, no dvd player attached to the tele, none of the advertised popcorn or drinks, so off to reception i go to ask if it is possible for someone to come up, the response was "" oh really what time is it, really sorry will be up in a few minutes, 10 minutes later we had a movie, i do appreciate i am picking up on DETAIL but that is what we are paying for at your 4 star level. 

On MONDAY  obviously much quieter we went down for breakfast, had to wait 5 minutes to be seated, no buffet style brekkie just order from a menu, should be fine we thought, well we were wrong, the cold buffet had very limited items had to ask a member of staff for smoked salmon, bottled water, yoghurts and the toaster was not even switched on at 9.30am. SO after waiting 10 minutes for our coffee our order was finally taken by a manager , who in his ultimate wisdom decided not to write our order down, he said he would remember it all no problem, BIG MISTAKE. After waiting another 20 minutes for the breakfast no only was the order  completely wrong it was cold, some items missing, dealay in food coming out , we had ordered the  pancakes and french toast, both of which we asked to be served with bacon, the pancakes came  without the maple syrup or strawberries as advertised on the menu,  the bacon was dry and cold, we made a fuss to the manager who got the items replaced but to be honest did not seem very iinterested or sincere, he was the only member of staff we came accross i our time here that was not showing a level of hospitality, the manager was not irish, he appeared to be from maybe an Indian island , it was a real let down to us after the superb breakfast experienced the previous day we left feeling very uncared for.

So finally before leaving a final swim in the pool, water again freeing if not colder than the previous day and after just 20 minutes in the water we are told that the pool would be used for an aqua aerobics class and so we were offered a small area at the top of the pool to use whilst the local ladies all came in for the class, Disappointing that we were not informed when we signed in at reception, the hours for the children are quite limited anyway and then to find out we could not use much pf the cold pool was a real disappointment for the kids.
Overall it is a really comfortable friendly well staffed and run property that charges a premium for its facilities which if you can back up with the attention to detail would be heaven on earth, I understand you are trying very hard and always appreciate constructive feedback which i hope i have left. I am sorry i have not left my feedback sooner but time has just slipped away. I do hope next time we come to visit my brother in Greystones we will be able to book in and  be able to enjoy our stay  more than we did this time",3,2011,06,10
238,Marriott Shame on you!,"I fully expected more from this hotel. It was slightly difficult to locate. Parking was free. Wifi free in rooms. Breakfast was ample and standard, nothing special. Dinner was good in both presentation and excellant in service.
Rooms were tired and looked dirty. Hallways smelled and were dirty in appearance. Bathroom was dirty. Bed clean and comfortable. Limited supplies in room. Hotel was noisy and busy. Reception staff friendly, but rushed. Dining staff friendly professional and made you feel like a guest rather than a customer.
I would not recommend this hotel. For some reason Marriott is missing something here with this big gem.",3,2011,06,09
238,"Fell in love, can't wait to go back!","After a weekend away with my partner in Druids Glen - I felt the need to write this review....
From start to finish, an amazing experience. The hotel is quitely understated and charming. 
The hotel grounds are amazing... We were checked in to our room by such a lovely, lovely lady. Explained where everything was, booked us in for dinner and even gave us tips on what to do while we were there...
Room was spacious and comfy - the beds I could sleep in forever and forever!
We went for lunch in the bar - lovely area at the back looking over the golf club... Food was fab- could have done me for dinner - not just lunch!! But a bit of indulgence never did anyone any harm!
We went for a dip in the pool - it was dreary outside, but the pool area makes you feel like you are on a proper holiday with the huge glass window giving in plenty of heat.
Dinner was 5 star - no other way to describe it - our waiter was attentive without being annoying and gave us some great advice on the wine - which went down an absolute treat.
There were a few kids around, but none of which caused us any hassle, as we were seated in the quieter area of the restaurant.
Didn't have time to visit the Spa - but looked through the menu and will definitely be sampling on the next visit!
Staff were the most friendly and curtious that I have came across in a long, long while. In particular - Aggy the housekeeper who always greated us with a smile, the helpful waiter whose name escapes me at this time and Amy on the desk who was so welcoming and helped us during our stay.
Overall, Druids Glen should be so proud of their hotel and staff! Can't wait to come back with the children in the summer. One of the best hotels i've stayed in - ever.",5,2011,06,01
238,not 5 star i'm afraid!,"having just returned from a nice night away, i'm a little dissapointed overall as i obviously had higher expectations from a 5 star getaway!
i booked a one night dinner,b&b package for my husbands birthday.i opted to take an upgrade for an extra 60 euros because it was for a special occasion!so we were staying in a suite - this was the main fualt i'd have. it was tired,and in need of ronovation. poor  paintwork ,peeling and cracking of bathroom ceiling.
 however dinner was very good,steak overcooked but overall very good quality,very good service from staff throughout. lovely breakfast this morning.",3,2011,05,30
238,"Too many kids, too busy","Visited over Easter weekend with my husband. We have no kids. This hotel was just too busy for the kind of weekend getaway we were looking for. Too many families: kids running all over the place, especially in the public areas and at breakfast. Rooms were disappointing to be honest, nothing very special - no more than 3 star really in my opinion. Very noisy hotel - long open corridors with rooms opening directly on. Did not use the spa - didn't have time. We used the hotel as a base to see the sights in Wicklow so spent a lot of time in the car, which was just as well, because the hotel didn't strike me as a place I would want to sit around and relax in for hours. 

Dinner was lovely - which was a very nice surprise. Service was excellent. I booked to eat late, to avoid the families - and it was a good decision. 

Overall, I thought this hotel lacked wow factor or character so if you are expecting luxury or anything plush, this is probably not for you.",3,2011,05,30
238,Excellent hotel and great staff,Stayed for 2 nights and could not fault anyone or thing. The grounds are well maintained and the lobby is very open and welcoming. Food was lovely and we had a very relaxing time. Will visit again with the kids in October. Thank u to all in druids Glen.,5,2011,05,29
238,A Fantastic Weekend,"Just returned from a fantastic weekend! We really couldn't fault anything at all! The staff were attentive and friendly, the food was wonderful and our suite stunning!! We were also really impressed at how well children were welcomed in the hotel and have decided to return with our children in October!!! We would HIGHLY recommend the hotel to friend's!!!",5,2011,05,29
238,Disappointing rooms,"Stayed here with my wife on a break away from kids. Very nice hotel with lovely food (although expensive), all amenities, pool etc. and can see why it would be great for the golfer with two courses. However the room was below standard. We got a family room which meant there was a door to the next room with other guests staying there. We could hear (it was a couple who liked to talk load and watch tv) and smell (they must have got a chinese takeaway and brought back to their room) everything from their room. When I said it to the guy at the desk when checking out he was not surprised and acknowledged that the person who designed the hotel put far too many family rooms in it. All in all, very nice hotel but not worth the money they charge and if you're staying there make sure you don't get a room with a door to the next room!",2,2011,05,29
238,Really enjoyed the Hotel.,"My partner and I stayed over the weekend of Easter. We are both in our early fifties. On arrival, I was a bit dubious of all the young families with young children also staying. 
However, my fears were unfounded. The staff at the Hotel were amazing, they had organises so much activity for the younger guests and their parents, my partner and I even found ourselves looking on at the fun and games.

We also enjoyed a delicious dinner in the main restaurant. The main bar on the Sunday evening was very busy but again my complete respect to the staff, they served with a professionalism I have not seen in some time. Chatty, smiling, just a real treat under such pressure.

Our room was  lovely, although a longish walk from reception. Maybe I am getting old. 
We did have breakfast to the room and received a phone call before hand to give us time to prepare.

Overall, I really enjoyed the Hotel. Again the staff made it for us.
Will return, even on a family packed weekend.",5,2011,05,19
238,"Nice hotel, definitely not 5 star quality","When we pulled up to the hotel I was a little bit shocked at the exterior as I had a real idea that were going to a lovely 5 star hotel and was disappointed when I laid eyes on it, it really looks like it could do with a good lick of paint and maybe a fountain in the middle of the big green roundabout area of the hotel could add a little ambience or luxury feel to the place..

The lobby was nice, well maintained and the staff I must say were lovely.  We put our bags into our room and again this did just not live up to my expectations.  I have stayed in fabulous 4 and 5 star hotels in Ireland and abroad and this did not even live up to 4 stars.  Extremely old furnishings, carpet was green, bathroom was just dull and old fashioned, nothing about it said luxury to me.

We went to the bar to get something to eat as we only wanted something small, the food I must say cannot be faulted.  However again the furnishings in the room with all the windows around it was just plain weird, mismatched chairs, old looking furniture and the salt and pepper grinders were sticky which made me just think dirty...

It pains me a little to write this review as all the staff from reception to the bar to the people serving the food were lovely and couldn't do enough for you.  Its really just the hotel itself, when I pay for 5 star, I expect 5 star and that to me is light, modern furnishings giving a luxurious feel rather than the the old, dated feel I got off most of this hotel I'm afraid...",3,2011,05,12
238,"A ""below par"" experience..not a 5 star hotel","We checked in for what we thought would be a relaxing two night, 5 star break. We booked via a Supervalu Break scheme which we now realise was bad value for money.

The clue to the fixtures and fittings you can expect in the hotel is evident from the moment you arrive at the entrance gates to the Resort. The signage is missing a letter and the gate posts look like they could do with a good paint..not a good first impression! The exterior of the hotel gives the same poor impression.

We were checked in quickly by a pleasant receptionist and headed to our room. The hotel foyer is immaculately maintained and comfortable but unfortunately this does not extend to the rest of the hotel. Virtually EVERY surface is either scuffed, scratched, stained or chipped varying from a minor to major degree. Normally this kind of thing is forgivable in a 4 or 3 star hotel but not really expected in a 5 star hotel! Although most of this wear and tear is minor, when EVERY surface you look at is damaged to a certain extent it really detracts from the feeling that you are “meant” to be in a 5 star establishment. 

For example, wallpaper and doors in corridors are chipped and scuffed fairly extensively.. wallpaper seemed to be covered in black scuff marks which would not be difficult to remove by housekeeping staff. A symptom of the large numbers of golfers who haul their clubs through the corridors perhaps?!! The only thing that 100% maintained to a 5 star standard were the carpets, that appeared to have been recently shampooed throughout the hotel. 

This dated and faded feel extended to our room... again furniture was chipped, wallpaper torn and scuffed/ stained. There were stains on the armchair in the room. An electrical wire was hanging loose from the air conditioning unit. The shower head was dirty with what looked like lime scale. Apart from this wear and tear our room was very clean though. 

We had an uncomfortable night’s sleep..the room was very warm and the air conditioning unit could not be lowered below 17 degrees Celsius (which in reality felt more like 20 degrees)..windows in the rooms only open about 5cm, which is obviously a safety feature. I dread to think how hot the rooms get in the height of summer! 

Another point is that rooms are not remotely soundproofed.. as was evident when we were woken up twice during the night by rowdy guests returning to their rooms.

We had breakfast the next day and were quite shocked by the standard we encountered. Firstly we were not asked for our room number and were completely ignored when we entered the dining room. We sat at a table for two with no direction from the waiting staff. 

Bowls of fresh fruit were left uncovered and in front of a sunny window. Cold food, such as yoghurts and smoked salmon, were obviously put on ice first thing in the morning at 6am but this had completely melted by 10am, when we had our breakfast. The hot buffet for cooked breakfast was cool to lukewarm at best and very greasy. Sausages looked undercooked and were not properly browned. Correct food holding temperatures were obviously not cared about. Serving spoons were dirty and obviously hadn’t been replaced for the duration of the breakfast service. We were asked at least 4 times by different staff members if we wanted tea and when we gave in, it arrived in a strange hospital-style stainless steel jug rather than a teapot!! There were no table cloths on the tables. Pastries were nice and appeared to have been baked on site but this is what I would expect anyway.

 I am of the opinion that if a 5 star hotel is to serve a buffet style breakfast, rather than waiter table service, it should be 100% perfect and this was most definitely not.

We were so shocked that we voiced our opinion to the Front of House Manager; Julie Traynor, after breakfast. She adopted a glazed over look and seemed for the most part unshocked by our complaints. She offered to upgrade us to a suite, which we happily accepted. Again standards in the suite were quite poor though; no fresh fruit or flowers, cushions and furnishings stained, interior door badly chipped, and the mini bar was dirty. Again this room was unbearably warm and we had another poor night’s sleep.

I decided to also voice my concerns about breakfast to the restaurant manager, Peter Montejoy. He was a lovely man and was most understanding and concerned. He was very professional and offered us a complimentary dinner in the restaurant that evening. Given the standard of the breakfast, we were slightly dubious to accept this offer. However, the dinner was excellent and Peter and his waiting staff are a credit to the hotel. It is just such a pity that the breakfast is so mismatched to the dinner service which is most definitely of a 5 star standard.

Overall, we did not really enjoy our stay, had we not voiced our concerns during our stay and had them rectified to a satisfactory degree, we would have been extremely disappointed with Druids Glen.

The hotel appears to be primarily used by young families, golfers and wedding parties..none of which are probably too bothered or have the time to care too much about the 5 star experience you are meant to get at this hotel.

If you are looking for an immaculate, all round 5 star experience you won’t find it at this hotel. It is a tired looking 4 star hotel, primarily a golfers retreat, with a 5 star dinner service and a 2 star breakfast.",2,2011,05,11
238,The warmest and most welcoming hotel we've stayed at in Europe.,"Upon entering the hotel after a difficult trip the reception staff couldn't have been more helpful and welcoming. The hotel was beautiful and exceptionally clean and all the staff, from the reception to the chambermaids were charming. Facilities in the hotel were wonderful and we were particularly impressed with the way the hotel catered for children. On arrival we were handed a children's activity pack, which although my children were too young to appreciate were a godsend for my sister whose children sat straight down once we got to the room and gave them 15 minutes of much needed peace! There was a huge playroom with a good variety of toys for all age groups, a large cinema room with popcorn and drinks and activities in the pool at certain times.  Though the hotel made a huge effort to welcome children we did notice they very discretely separated those families with children from those didn't. We were particularly impressed by this and it was these little things which are sure to make us want to return at some point.Great food, great staff and beautiful hotel. If I had to give one slight critism it would be that the bed wasn't as comfortable as I would expect in a hotel of their standard - Improve this though and I'd put it to the top of our Irish hotel list!",5,2011,05,04
238,Fantastic break for all the family,"Staff very friendly and helpful.  Rooms good size for families and very clean.  Games room brilliant for letting the little ones run around and the second room for bigger kids who computer games.  Food excellent good choice, Spa brilliant and outstanding golf course in fact best ever course we have played on.  Lots to do in the area and overall a great relaxing break for all of the family.",5,2011,04,28
238,Superb Family Easter break excellent itineary for the children excellent spa and golf facilities for the adults !,"Just returned back from a leisurely family easter weekend break. We has a fantastic time everything was perfect to say the least. Great family activities, great childrens itineary we especially loved the easter bunny appearance ! The other hotel facitities were excellent.The golf course was a dream. The food and staff were excellent nothing was too much trouble would highly reccommend Druids Glen resort this is about our 4 return visit.",5,2011,04,27
238,Last minute break,"Had a very last minute break - booked Saturday night, arrived Sunday -  at Druids’ Glen last August with family.  The hotel is in a really lovely woodland setting with the back of the hotel in a gorgeous elevated position looking down over the golf course – we found some lovely paths and country lanes for our early morning walks with the dog!  

The hotel itself is modern and beautifully furnished and the reception staff were extremely pleasant and welcoming as was the Sunday afternoon barbecue in the gardens on the day we arrived.  We shared our room with our two children, 11 and 14, and they had their own beds as well which was great.  The room itself was large and nicely decorated as was the bathroom and looked over a central courtyard.  We specifically asked for a room near the lift as a family member was recovering from an illness and this was not a problem.  The breakfast was a substantial buffet and was fairly typical of this type of meal in a hotel.  There was a lovely decked area at the back which was perfect for sitting out having a drink and relaxing.  The driving range and putting green were a massive hit with my husband and in particular, my son, who spent substantial amounts of time hitting golf balls.  There was also a snooker table and games room where the kids met lots of new friends in the evenings after dinner.  The pool and jacuzzi were also very welcome.

The hotel was ideally situated for a bit of touring and we went as far south as Arklow and managed to get an afternoon in the Dundrum shopping centre.  Not to be missed ladies!  Also not to be missed is Powerscourt and the utterly fantastic little shops at the entrance.  The hotel is listed as 5* and whilst I couldn’t agree with that rating I would have to say it is a very good 4*.  All in all a very good great value stay.  Hope to be back soon.",4,2011,04,26
238,5 star staff!!!,"Absolutley superb hotel. Back from weekend stay there with my fiancé and it was fabulous. Basically holed up for the two days and put the feet up! Got great package deal -spa treatment for herself and golf for me. Druids glen is on another level, course in pristine condition! Service in hotel top notch, great buffet breakfast and an even better dinner. Restaurant staff so professional yet in a friendly way if that makes sence? Manager made it his business to have a chat with us and with other tables while waiting on main course. Gave me a few handy pointers for golf on the Sunday too, although i didn't make great use to be honest, course was pretty testing! There was couple of bbqs on over weekend but they were private - looked very tasty though and they do open up to guests mid summer so will be back to sample! Only downer was the drive home! Thanks to all for a great weekend! Regards Peter p",5,2011,04,19
238,Luxury....Well worth the visit!,"After being looked after so well during our overnight stay in Druids Glen I felt I had to share a review. From start to finish the stay was a wonderful experience. We were greeted very warmly by reception and given a lovely twin room on the third floor. The receptionist even came out from behind the desk to show us to the lifts – very friendly service without being patronising. Myself and my mum had two great treatments and relaxed in the leisure centre for the afternoon. The beds were comfortable and the room spotless.

There was a wedding in the hotel during our stay and you wouldn’t have known it, except we saw the bride in reception, there wasn’t any noise along the corridors at night. We were still treated like top priority even though the staff had a wedding party to look after.

In all my stays in hotels in Ireland I can’t commend enough the quality and variety on the dinner and breakfast menus. The duty manager even went around the restaurant ensuring everyone was satisfied with their meal –nice touch.

After breakfast we took our papers to the lovely deck and enjoyed a glass of orange juice in the nice weather we had over the weekend. 

Looking forward to returning very soon…",5,2011,04,18
238,Never Again,"I stayed here for 2 nights for what was supposed to be a romantic weekend with my husband...my 1st weekend away for 9 months without our  young children.
When we got to our room we  found we had a room with two beds .
When i go to a 5* hotel i expect to have at least what i have at home and possibly more - there is NO WAY two people can sleep in one of these beds. We are normal sized people and so we spent our weekend away in seperate beds. This hotel seems to accomodate double and twin beds in the same room type. Most beds these days are 5 foot at least - so for anyone wanting to go on a romantic break away - dont.
Hotel take note- most couples want a big bed
Its my 1st and last visit here....was so excited  going there but left feeling disappointed....it was nothing to write home about",3,2011,04,11
238,expensive but what service,"was attending a wedding everything was just great from the start.amember of the party was not the best when we informed the hotel they just took care of everything, we stayed late in bar that night 3am or later but bar staff where excellent friendly at such a late hour
ciaran  could be wrong was first class",5,2011,04,05
238,"Exceptional Welcome, adored the ambiance & decor, delightful stay - short but sweet...will definitely be back!",I spent a quick stopover stay at Druids Glen with my daughter in March 2011.  From the beautiful drive into the hotel to the exceptional welcome we received...everything about our stay was faultless.  I adored the decor - it was just not your typical hotel.  There's something homely yet 5 star professional about Druids Glen.  The accommodation was faultless (albeit a little too much noise from our neighbouring room who had their TV up too loudly).  The beds were exceptionally comfortable.  The breakfast was super and our check out efficient and speedy.  I have a big personal event coming up in the next 12 months and am currently reviewing locations througout Ireland and Druids Glen is very close to the top of my list!!,5,2011,04,01
238,Fantastic Golf Trip,"We arrived on Sunday evening to enjoy our complimentary burgers and pints.  The food was really good, and the atmosphere in the bar was great for a Sunday night.  Our room was spacious, clean, modern with a great bathroom - just what you would expect from a quality 5 star hotel.  We had the bonus of a view through the trees of the infamous 12th hole.
Breakfast both days was of the best quality and took the form of a buffet, although the freshly made omelette I had was lovely as well.  The staff were attentive without being annoying.
The spa facilities are not the most modern in this style of hotel in the Dublin area, however they are more than adequate, and again were clean and the staff friendly.
We did happen to play the Druids Glen Golf Course on the best day of the year so far, and it was amazing.  The quality of the layout and the pace of the greens was astonishing for March.
Lastly, I needed some help from the reception staff to make an importnant phonecall during my stay and they were very helpful and went out of their way to be of assistance - Thank you!!
We had a brilliant time, and will recommend the resort to anyone whether for golf or not.",5,2011,03,30
238,Never again,"While checking in I was spoken to as if I was a child, they lost our dinner reservation, only have certain amount of double bed - so ended up in a twin room, rooms are dark and furniture old. Breakfast was a disaster - you had to queue to get in and then people were told to take a seat and wait and they called out randomly, not in order, when a table was ready.  For the toaster to work you need to fiddle around with the extension cord and queues for everything.  We arrived for breakfast at 9:50 (serve until 11) so not as if we were late.  Only good thing was the pool.  Don't know how this is a 5 star",2,2011,03,30
238,Peace and harmony,"I stayed here for two nights with people who have an intellectual disability. We were a group of five. The hotel was beautiful and staff were amazing. They made all of us feel most welcome at all times throughout our stay. Everybody enjoyed a treatment in the spa and staff here were most helpful. Some of us were a little more nervous than others and the staff could not have done anymore to help. The service was fantastic and as for the food, I can safely say we all put on weight those days and nights due to delicious food! I would definitely go back for another blissful break!",5,2011,03,28
238,Nice Hotel,"I brought my partner here for a 2 night break to get some time together, as he works away and wanted a nice break for us to get some alone time.  

The hotel was fabulous - the most comfortable beds - could have stayed there for a week!  The staff were friendly and welcoming, not over the top as in some 5 star hotels.

The food was amazing - the service a bit slow, but that would be my only fault with the food.  I asked in reception for 2 champagne flutes, and had to ring down an hour later when we hadn't received them, which was a bit annoying but not a major issue.

I was a bit apprehensive in relation to the reviews of the children and a family hotel, but I have to say there were a few families there but not rowdy or troublesome, this might have been because of the days or time of year.  I will be returning for another stay in the future.",4,2011,03,28
238,Enjoyed every minute,Stayed here for 2 days with two young children.  We enjoyed every minute of our stay.  The children still speak fondly of it and are looking to go back again for another mini holiday.,5,2011,03,24
238,Excellent Hotel,"Having read previous reviews i was a little concerned about the kids, or rather the amount of kids that seem to be stay in the hotel as it is our time to be away from our own youngsters! we have gone to various hotels in and around the dublin for the past 6 years for our anniversary.  At times we have been disappointed with our experiences in so called 5 star hotels as we tend to splash out and we do expect that bit extra, but Druids Glen has that something different and i thought it right to post here. It is not what some would expect from a 5 star but of all the previous we have stayed in it is up their with the very best. We found hotel much more  homely than we have in previous breaks away Staff were all very friendly and helpful. Although on check in i was a bit worried as they said the restaurant was just about fully booked and we wouldnt be able to sit until 9.30pm. But it turned out to be fine as the rugby match was on until after 7pm in the bar -  we could have stayed there for the evening after sinking into the couches. Did notice alot of kids in there but there were none that were any worse than my own two! We went down for dinner and the restaurant was absolutley packed. Sat in the smaller area where it was all lit up and got  a lovely bottle of wine to start  - delicious and just what the doctor ordered. At about 35 euro it was more expensive than we would usually get so i told the waiter if it was bad he would have to take the blame! But dinner was included so you kind of feel like your eating for free although my other half tells me thats not how it works :0 Meal and service was absolutley top class. Went to the bar which was again very busy and had a couple of cocktails to top the night off. Had music in the main part of the bar  but we sat in the conservatory part again! Had great sleep which may have had something to do with the wine and cocktails! When we went down for breakfast next morning it was a bit chaotic and ran out of sausages and bacon for about 10 minutes which himself wasnt too happy about but  when we finally got them they were lovely - i suppose you cant have it all go smoothly! Definitley will be back again and looking forward to next year already!!!

238,"Just Lovely and very good value, feeling wound up? Chill out here","Just home from Druids Glen, what a majestic setting amazing peacful walks. Staff very helpful and a nice room, thank you Linda. 5 star entrance lobby.
Just one thing to improve a lovely place, I would power hose in around the entrance area, kerbs etc and add a little colour at the front door, first impressions are very important. Love the Druids Glen, will be looking out for those Friday night deals, maybe have the same deal on a Sunday night, if you do please book us in! 

Thank you, great place, highly reccomended. Jim and Eleanor",5,2011,03,13
238,do not order room service,"My wife and I stayed on Saturday the 5th of March.  We decided to treat ourselves to room service late at night.  There were only, I believe three hot items (understandable late at night), and two of them we were told was not available with no explanation.  So we ordered Chilli nachos and a chicken sandwich.  The ""Chilli nachos"" had no chilli and just a sprinkeling of cheese (very bad).  The chicken salad sandwich was served on stale bread.  For the price you pay for room service late at night, I thought this was unexceptable for a hotel of this standard.  I wish they would have just said that no room service was available instead of having probally the night porter make our food.  

At 0330 in the morning there was a fight outside of our room 202.  Probally from the wedding that was taking place in the hotel.  Not the hotels fault.  I had put our room service tray in the hall by this time and noticed that one of the guys fighting started eating the food on the tray that we did not eat.  He enjoyed it anyway, ha.

The hotel itself was ok and service was above average.  I believe the Mariott group have pulled out (even though still saw Mariott logos on a few items in the room).  Like a lot of hotels, it was a bit dated but understandable in this economy.  I did expect a flat screen tv but they still have the old chunky one.   It was a lower tier 4 star hotel at best but has the potential to be a lot better.

One good note:  bar staff, day reception, and breakfast staff were very good.",3,2011,03,10
238,5 star Service with a smile,"Just returned from a one night stay at the Druids Resort and it certainly lived up to our expectations.  From start to finish the staff were top class and the facilities were superb.  Dinner in the Bistro was excellent and the waiter was very professional, and looked after us superbly.  Great Spa and Leisure facilities also.  For value for money this time of year I doubt if you will get anywhere to match Druids Resort. Cannot wait for a return visit and perhaps bring the kids next time.  The courtesy Bikes is a nice touch!",5,2011,03,07
238,Superb from start to finish!,"We staed in druids Glen as a family of 6, 2 adults and 4 children aged from 10 to 15 February 2011. From start to finish our stay was superb. The rooms were very spacious, 2 double beds in each, with a large bathroom. The 10 and 12 year old kids ate free at breakfast (which was of a very high standard and plentiful both in quantity and variety) and on the one night we ate in the restaurant. The pool and spa area were great for the kids and the video room handy if it turns wet. It was the friendliness of the staff and the little things like free wifi (I am writing this from the Four Seasons in Shanghai, where 24 internet access is £12 on top of the standard rack rate of £250 plus!!) and free bike hire to allow you to explore the lovely countryside. The only slight criticism was the slow service in the restaurant, but the food was very good. Although I would recommend Scent Garden in nearby Greystones for a lovely Thai/Asian meal. The hotel, like many in Ireland at the minute has some great offers on rooms, we paid Euro 360 for the 2 rooms for the 2 nights including breakfast for everyone both mornings. Great value from a great hotel. The hotel is about 20 minutes from Avoca for a (bank breaking) superb lunch and about 1 hour from the Kildare Outlet Village for some retail therapy. You can be in Dublin city cebtre in around 30 minutes or drive to Dundrum, visit the shopping centre and get the Luas (tram) into Dublin.",5,2011,03,05
238,comfortable but need to love sharing it with unruly kids.,"We arrived for a few nights over the half term. We hadn't realised this and found the hotel completely overrun with young kids who were not supervised by their parents. In fact on the night we arrived we decided to have a relaxing drink late in the evening in the lounge by a lovely gas fire however our peace was shattered by hoards of kids running around our chairs,using the hotel as a playground....at midnight....while their parents merrily drank at the bar.
The value we had was amazing and the breakfast was wonderful so long as you were seated well away from the wild children. The room and bathroom was comfortable and spacious however we did not appreciate being woken at 8am every morning to pounding music coming from the gym.
It is a nice hotel but would not rate it 5*. However, could not fault the helpful and friendly attitude of the staff.",4,2011,02,27
238,Nice stay but not five star standard,"Myself and my boyfriend went down to the hotel for two night's stay and while we enjoyed ourselves, it is definitely not up to five star standard.
We arrived late on the Friday night and went to the bar for dinner. The food was lovely however the bar definitely felt more like a Clubhouse rather than a hotel bar. We felt a little out of place amongst golfers and young families. 
Our timing was unfortunate as we went over mid-term break however there were alot of small children running around the place....we even encountered a good few running down the halls in their swim-suits and arm-bands!!! 
The room itself was nice however I would agree with the previous review that said the rooms were dated. The shower was very poor, the temperature changed of it's own accord and the pressure was very low. There was plastering on the walls also near the mirror which is not what I would expect of five stars.

I would recommend this hotel for golfers and families, but would not recommend it for a romantic weekend. The whole atmosphere felt far too busy combined with feeling like you're in a creche. 

To end on a positive note though, the staff were extremely helpful and courteous!",3,2011,02,27
238,Recommended :),"Had a super stay over mid term break. From checkin to rooms to bar and restaurant found everything top class. No charge for extra bed in the room which I thought was great. Great atmosphere around the hotel and it was very very busy with families. Not too sure if it would suit a couple looking for a night away 
though, alot of kids, mine included!",5,2011,02,25
238,Great weekend,"Just back from co Wicklow after fantastic weekend in Druids glen hotel. I have to say from start to finish they didn't put a foot wrong. Checked inbon Friday and had lunch in the bar lounge, could have done with sharing a burger cause it was so big but I got there in the end! Service was great and there was a real buzz about the place so we were excited about what lay ahead. Ended up not having dinner as were still full from late lunch but grabbed a sandwich before bed which was fine. Saturday morning we went to powerscout waterfalls and it was bequtiful, had a great day for it (surprisingly!) and had lovely lunch up in small village nearby - enniscerry??? Had quick snooze back at hotel and went for dinner at about 8pm, restaurant was very busy but looked fantastic the way it was lit up and you wouldn't think you were in the same room hours previous having breakfast! Well the food was delicious and the service first class. Waiters were running around a bit but still managed to be around when needed. Ordered Irish coffees after dessert and the restaurant manager offered to make them in the bar if we wanted to get a seat in there as music was about too. With that we gotvthe bill and I was given a rose which just topped off the meal, not often you get the little touches these days. Settled in the bar forth music and there was a great atmosphere, the band were a traditional Irish band which wasn't my cup of tea but they were good none the less. Woke up and headed down for breakfast on Sunday morning and it was very busy. Had to wait a couple of minutes for a seat but was fine with this. Get down early as manager said the whole hotel seemed to have come at once for breakfast. They have a great buffet selection and breakfast was lovely. Again waiters were running round a bit but service was fine. If I had to mark the hotel down a bit it would be that room was a bit warm at night and couldn't get the tempature right, bit of wear and tear around too but wouldn't let it take away from our experience. I'll be back for a break with my two boys before the summer and look forward to it. Hope you find this helpful!",5,2011,02,20
238,great hotel,"We stayed here for three nights over the valentines weekend and had a great time. Wicklow is a great place for a 3-4 night break. We got a great deal directly with the hotel website - stay three nights and pay for 2. We took a suite and had 2  rollaway beds for our 2 small children. It was just lovely with 2 bathrooms and a gas fire. The breakfast was lovely , the staff couldnt do enough for us and the leisure centre for entertaining the children was also great. There was also a large and well equipped games room and a cinema type room where on request the reception would put on a movie. The large gym also looked well equipped . I didnt get to use it 
We did find eating in the hotel expensive, although children under 12 eat free. However only 10 mins drive away you will find lots of lovely resturants in Greystones. There is a DART in Greystones if you wanted to go into Dublin. 
We had great weather so took a drive to the lovely beach at Brittas Bay - is only about 15mins away. We also went up to Powerscourt which has a good but expensive AVOCA cafe. If you want to walk in the gardens admission is 6 euro each which I thought a bit expensive. 
All in all a great weekend break in a four star hotel",4,2011,02,16
238,"Not a 5 star hotel, but a good 4 star.","My boyfriend and I went to the Druids Glenn for Valentines weekend, we got the deal for €220 for one night, 1 dinner, bottle of prosecco,rose petal turn-down and breakfast. 
We were very kindly upgraded by Linda as we were returning guests - I thought this was a nice touch.

We are seasoned travellers and I am particular about hotels, I think if they are rated as 5 star they should be 5 star worthy. However the Druids Glen is not 5 star worthy.

On arrival there was a que to check in, a nice woman checked us in, our room was a double room with ensuite and a small sitting room with a bathroom, the decor is very dated,there was no artwork, the lighting is poor and failed to create a romantic atmosphere, the paint in the bathroom was chipping and the toilet roll holder was on its last screw of four on the wall, there was two candle holders on the bath, with no candle but wax dripped down the side and we were missing a drinking glass. 

We had brought our own champagne and after drinking the prosecco which the hotel had given us, I called down and asked for a new cooler and 2 fresh glasses, when we returned from dinner, the new cooler and glasses were there but so was the old one and and the dirty glasses- this was not 5 star treatment, its the small things that make a 5 star a 5 star and the Druids Glen did not cut it in my opinion.

On a positive note, the meal was fantastic, the restaurant was very romanticly lit and the food was absolutely beautiful and without fault, the wine selection was good and while the lady who served us was very kind, it was slow, for our plates to be cleared and for our new courses to arrive, I understand they were busy though.I was given a rose leaving dinner which was sweet.

I would go back, but only for the restaurant and I wouldn't stay here as its too expensive for what is provided. I dont mind spending money if it's really worth it, but unfortuantely the Druids Glen in my opinion is not worth it.",3,2011,02,15
238,Great food in restaurant. Room to improve elsewhere,"Stayed one night here with family. Not a 5 star hotel for sure but its good overall. Handy location from Dublin. Check in was quick. Room was non smoking but smelt of smoke esp. in bathroom as soon as we checked in. The double room had 2 double (not king) size beds which were small. Room a good size. Elemis toiletries in the bathroom. Lunch in the bar was forgettable. A poor Caesar salad and a poor BLT wrap. The fitness centre was great and overlooks pool. The pool and sauna area resemble more a leisure centre than a ""spa"". We had in druids bistro and it was the highlight of our stay. The food and wine were top notch. Best dinner we've all eaten in a long time. The French waiter was charming and knowledgeable. There was live music in the bar on Sat night. Breakfast is served until 11am. We arrived at 1035 and it was absolute chaos. The maitre d could not seat us for a table of four and told us to find our own. We found a table but staff set it for 3 persons only. At the cold buffet there were no bowls or glasses for juice. We had to ask for tea and coffee after sitting there for about 20 mins. Hotel management definitely needs to look at how breakfast operates as it was a melee. Overall not a bad spot for a night away. Dinner was definitely the highlight of our stay.",3,2011,02,08
238,"Nice hotel, but a few slight issues that I wouldn't expect in a five star hotel","My partner and I stayed here recently on a dinner & accommodation package and enjoyed our time at the hotel. The hotel is nicely located and easily accessible off the N11. At reception, we were greeted by a very friendly lady who was very helpful and explained the availability of the various facilities, dinner & breakfast times etc. and directed us to our room. The room was spacious but not what I would call 5 star - an old T.V. and some of the furnishings seemed a bit dated. This theme seemed to extend to the bar and reception area too, where it also seems that some of the decor has seen better days. I noticed things like wires running to fire alarms and security system cabling hanging loosely which with a bit of care and attention could easily be tidied up and tucked away from view. There were also one or two pieces of skirting board hanging on by a thread in the bar area and these things take away from the over all look of what is a very finely decorated hotel. Little things like this could be addressed easily but when left untouched give an impression that standards are slipping. Things like this in no way affected the enjoyment of my stay but were just things I noticed.

Dinner was very nice, the portions were generous and the waiting staff very attentive. If I had a criticism, it would be that the strip loin steak I had for my mains (although nicely cooked medium) was a rather poor quality cut of meat and I would definitely have been disappointed had it not been a part of the package deal and I had been paying full price for it. On reflection, I should have gone for the fillet! My starter and desert were top class though, and my partner’s meal was good from start to finish.

Unfortunately, we didn't get time to sample any of the spa treatments so I cannot comment on any of these but the facilities did look to be of a very high standard. In general, this is a fine hotel in a beautiful location. All the staff I met were friendly and helpful and overall I think I got good value for money. I would be happy to stay there again.",4,2011,02,08
238,Great place,"It is a golf resort, I was there for one week. It was winter, so low season. Te place is very beautiful. The rooms have good space and are comfortable.  They have a Gym, better, a club where you can have even classes like spinning and body combat.  The swimming pool is great.
No negative comments",5,2011,02,07
238,Fantastic hotel!,"I stayed with my partner here as a treat for his birhtday weekend. On arrival to the hotel we were warmly welcomed. We dined in the restaurant both nights and the food was amazing and proper five star quality!! The breakfast was beautiful and I found a great selection. We both sampled the freshly made pancakes and were left wanting more. Overall the service was good and the waiters were very professional. After our meal we relaxed in the bar and a waiter was with us within minutes to take our order. Our room was spacious, quiet and comfortable. The pool was also lovely and very private. I didn't get the chance to try out the spa as it was fully booked up. I will definitely be returning here again and I really couldn't fault this hotel. Its extremely relaxing and cosy. The hotel is in a good location and easily accessible. I would highly recommend a visit here.",5,2011,01,31
238,Excellent! I forgot how lovely this hotel is!,"Stayed for one night - organised a late checkout on the Sunday which took the pressure off!  We arrived at 5pm Sat and left at 6.30pm Sunday but felt like we were there for 3 days!  Food was really really good! Kids loved the pool it was spotless....I loved the gym and it was busy with plenty of room - and again spotless!  Our room was huge with a lovely warm fire - cracking views and very comfortable.  Really nice walks - bikes available for free - and a really good choice of wine in the bar for purchase by the glass!
The only downside was the water in the room - it did taste like it came out of a tap - maybe it was sitting out too long??? Overall a great choice, lovely location but top top marks go to the staff - all extremely efficent and happy!  Thanks you for a lovely stay.",5,2011,01,31
238,Not 5 star,"Stayed here recently with 4 friends for the spa package which was great value.  The spa, relaxation room and facials were all lovely but the bedrooms and bathrooms need updating esp around the showers etc.  The pool area is more like what you would find in a leisure centre and there was a lot of people not staying in the hotel using it when we were there.  Didn't get that 5 star feel you get in other hotels around the country.  

Overall had a good experience but our waiter in the restaurant on the Sat night left a lot to be desired.  Twice he raised his eyes up to heaven while serving us!  Once when we asked for tap water instead of still or sparlking!  After asking him if he had a problem with us he was as nice as pie but it put a dampner on our night.  The staff at reception on checking out were rude to us also.  I questioned the bill twice as it was quite complicated the way it was done and didn't seem to make sence.  Both times I was fobbed off and on spending time trying to work through it I realised we had been sneakily charged for one extra treatment worth 70e so make sure to check your bill!!",3,2011,01,31
238,An amazing stay,"I visited Druids Glen with my boyfriend on Friday gone to celebrate his birthday. We got a business class dinner package and it was worth every penney.  The Hotel itself is situated on lovely grounds, you do need public transport to get there.  We were nicely welcomed by the Reception team on arrival to the hotel.  This was not my first time visiting Druid's Glen and I was delighted to return.  The Suite was very welcoming with a roaring open fire, it was very spaciously laid out and clean.   We had dinner in the restaurant and Loic, the Head Waiter looked after us tremendously...he was professional yet with a nice sense of humour. The food was delicious and well cooked to perfection, compliments to the chef...  The lounge area to relax with a drink is very peaceful, and again very comfortable. All in all, I couldn't compliment the hotel enough... Next time I will revisit, I will make sure to bring my swimwear to visit the spa.  Many thanks for such a nice experience.  Aoife",5,2011,01,31
238,Can't believe this is a 5 star...more 3 star standard.,"My family and I stayed here last week and really find it hard to beleive that it is five star hotel. The hotel building and rooms are of a good stardard but the food in the bar was of a very low quality; anything we ordered appeared to be frozen food that was just bought in and not made in the hotel eg burger, kids pizza, fish, chips (chips were even burned). And very overpriced. The breakfast buffet was very limited and some of the cold meats and salmon looked like they had been sitting out for days. The bread was hard and the rolls were not even baked properly. Nothing appreared to be made on site, all mass produced breads. Also no menu for the hot food. We were just asked would we like some hot breakfast and had to guess what they had! Does this sound like 5 star standard?

The bedroom was spacious and clean but nothing special. Not even a biscuit with the tea & coffee. The 'spring water' that was provided in the room tasted like it was filled from the bathroom tap. 

Overall we definitely did not have a five star experience and were very disappointed. I've  stayed in better 3 star hotels.

By the way I brought these issues up when I was checking out and was just told 'sorry'.",2,2011,01,17
238,Great Staff,Staff were very friendly and knew what was going on in the hotel.  Food excellent,5,2011,01,16
238,Probably the best hotel I have visited.,"I am usually disappointed when staying at quality hotels as often they are all show but no substance.  The management at Druids Glen seem to run a tight ship and the staff are all exceedingly courteous without being overbearing, and never aloof.  We found all the facilities to be top notch and in good working order.  I particularly appreciated the cold plunge pool to go with the sauna!  Kids were also very impressed with the excellent and large pool.  Breakfast had a good spread of the usual things, appearing 'just served' rather than the apparent leftovers found in many places.
The rooms were spacious and clean with excellent beds and crisp linen.  We ate at the bar and the food was of good quality, if not notably excellent.  Again service was friendly and we were not left waiting.
It's a shame I am not a golfer as if I were I am sure I would have more good things to say.  We hope to return at some point.",5,2011,01,02
238,3 NIGHT  STAY WITH 2 DAYS GOLFING (JUST BRILLIANT),"hi there
        we arrived on friday evening and what empressed me was the staff, right from the start. we were down to play golf and with the weather being as bad as it was that weekend we didnt enjoy the golf,which is a pity because the two golf courses are beautiful.
the rooms are very spacious and comfortable with two large beds,but because my wife wasnt with me i didnt spend much time there.which ment the bar seen more of me.
the food was excellent as well,and i have just realised we stayed in or around the hotel complex the whole weekend.
lovly place,very relaxing,great staff.

only down side,the irish weather
but i will be back",5,2010,11,29
238,"Fabulous Hotel, excellent service,super food, a real treat!","Just back from an overnight stay with my husband and absolutely loved this hotel. It certainly deserves its 5*rating. I had asked for a quiet room as we were escaping our young children for 1 night and I knew from previous reviews that it is a popular hotel for families too. The staff throughout the hotel were really attentive and very customer focused. The food was delicious and we both really enjoyed our evening meal which was well presented and cooked to perfection. I enjoyed one of the nicest massages ever in the Spa & considering it was a Saturday the Spa didn't feel rushed or crowded. The leisure centre was lovely although there were alot of children with inflatables in the pool but I enjoyed the steam rooms & jacuzzi. There was a wedding on in the Hotel but this had no impact on our stay and our room was very quiet - in fact probably the best nights sleep I've ever had staying in a hotel at a weekend. Breakfast was another success with a self service buffet and options which catered for all tastes. The hotel has plenty of comfortable seating areas just off the main lobby with open fires and newspapers etc. Overall I would highly recommend a stay at this hotel whether as a couple, a family or a few friends looking for somewhere with a nice atmosphere. We came home relaxed & rejuvinated after a short stay and would love to return!",5,2010,11,07
238,Excellent service & very child friendly,"Stayed for 2 nights and was just brilliant, very child friendly and catered really well for kids. There was a buffet for kids dinner which worked out great for us and first I've seen done in Ireland. Food was excellent in main restaurant and just little slow in bar but scones were lovely and hot when arrived. Pool was a little busy and may need more attention as felt since last visit this area got a bit rundown and very wet in changing areas.",5,2010,10,29
238,Brilliant relaxing break with family,"We stayed at the Druids Glen Hotel for 4 nights from 23rd Oct. Everything about the place was perfect, the room, the surroundings, the staff , the golf courses (though my own golf was not so perfect!!) and the food (kids loved breakfast!). It was just the break we had been looking for and would recommend Druids Glen to family, friends and anyone who is looking for such a break.
Thank you all at Druids Glen for making our stay so great. My 8 year old was very sad leaving and after a while after departing she stated from the back of the car that she had, fallen under the spell"". We will be back for a return stay.",5,2010,10,28
238,Perfect golf getaway,"Stayed at Druids Glenn and must say this is a perfect hotel for a golf getaway.

The rooms were large and clean, the service good and the golf was perfect.
Play both courses and they where in excellent condition.",5,2010,10,28
238,"Nice hotel, great food, could be better though.","Stayed here with some friends for a one night db&b, which was a great deal. The hotel is lovely, the rooms really big and beds fabulous. We had a lovely view of the woods, but our friends had a view of the car park. Orientation of the hotel seems odd as it could have sea views but doesn't. Missed a trick there. Also, it has lovely grounds but you can't walk on it as it's all golf course, and there is no access to the sea, even though you can see it as it's very close. Also missing out. We had a beautiful dinner, all really happy, but be warned that the dining room is very busy and if you don't want to be next to kids etc you need to ask for a table in the conservatory. Bar is lovely, serves best fish and chips ever.  Oh, pool is not a lovely relaxing spa, which is a shame, it's a kind of very normal leisure centre type pool.",4,2010,10,19
238,brill hotel,"excellent service, staff brill, great place to go to relax and chill out, food excellent",5,2010,10,17
238,Perfect Location for golfing trip,"Stayed at Druids Glen Golf Resort with a group of 12 on a golfing trip.  We booked 3 nights bed and breakfast and two rounds of golf at Druids Glen golf course (venue of Irish opens and Seve trophy).  The golf course, known as Europe's Agusta, is one of Irelands top courses and a delight to play.  It can be enjoyed equally by all standards of golfers.  As our group included high handicap golfers, we were advised by the starter that the forward tees may be the most appropriate to ensure evryones enjoment.  This was good advice.
The hotel itself was excellent.  It is rare when organising a trip that you dont have some complaints about the hotel - our only complaint was the price of drinks at the bar (to be fair this is an issue in all bars and hotels throughout the south of Ireland and Druids Glen is no exception).  
The hotel is five star and it genuinely lives up to it.  The staff are very helpful and welcoming, the rooms are superb, the food excellent and the grounds are a delight.
This was my third stay at this hotel so I was releived and deighted that the rest of the group were delighted with their stay and are all keen to return as soon as possible.
I would have no hesitation recommending this hotel to anyone organising a golf trip in ireland.",5,2010,10,14
238,"What a GREAT place, wonderful.","Stayed and played here and both the Hotel and Druids Glen Golf Course are first class.
The staff are very helpful and polite. The course is truly memorable.
Thank You Very Much",5,2010,10,05
238,really good place to stay and eat,"stayed over for a speacial event, we got a suite and had really good service, the food was top class.   We also use the pool and leisure factilties, they were super and the staff excellent.  Will be back again.",5,2010,09,05
238,excellent hotel,"we stayed here in july, had a nice relaxing weekend! great location, the grounds are very well maintained, the hotel had everything we needed. i would definitely recommend this hotel and will be returning. the staff were very friendly and helpful",5,2010,09,01
238,great leisure weekend,"We have just come back for a long weekend here and we had a fantastic stay, the rooms were at a very well maintained standard, the spa and leisure facilities were above my expectations and there there was plenty going on for the children.
Both the restaurant and bar offered good food with friendly service with something on either menu to suit all. We had a great time and even better still all at a very reasonalbe rate we will be back soon ! Thank you !",5,2010,09,01
238,Great spot for a wedding,"Visited the Druids Glen Hotel and Golf resort for a relations wedding.  If you want some of the best food in Ireland then this has it.  I've eaten great food in many many five star hotels around the world from Singapore to LA, New York to Sydney, Palma to London and all over Europe.  I thought I had tasted it all, but I had the best meal I have ever had in the restaurant at Druids Glen.  In addition to quality and of the highest standard, the service was excellent.  Not over bearing and not scarce just perfect.  The Hotel is situated in acres of forest and surrounded by a magnificent Championship Golf Course which has hosted the Irish Opena number of times.  The Spa is excellent and while the pool is quite average in size it was never too busy.  Thee are bicycles available for residents free of charge and plenty of places to take a stroll.  

So if you want luxury, pampering, great food topped with fantastic service and a great location, look no further.

238,It has seen better days,"I stayed at Druid's Glen with my family last weekend as we were attending the Kilruddery House Music Festival.  We had called the hotel the week before arriving and were told to get off at Bray Dart Station where a courtesy car would meet us.  On the day we were travelling we called again to double check only to be told this was completely wrong and we needed to head to Greystones Dart Station and that they could arrange a car to meet us for €2 each.  Thankfully we had had the presence of mind to make that second call because the hotel is 30 minutes away from Bray Dart Station.  We had been given the completely wrong information and the receptionist was extremely rude over the phone.  We arrived at Greystones and stood around for 15 minutes but no car turned up for us so we took a taxi.  We politely informed reception when we arrived that no car had picked us up and the same rude receptionist said 'well he was waiting for you and you never bothered to show up' and she then proceeded to try and drag one member of our group outside to show us the driver of the car and stood her ground maintaining we were in the wrong.  I was very taken aback by her tone and language.  We decided not to make a fuss but I have never been spoken to like that by anyone at a reception desk in my life.  We later had lunch which was very good but it did take 45 minutes to get to us and cost €70 which was a very unpleasant shock considering we had only ordered 3 main courses, 2 desserts and no drink.  The hotel was to arrange for a shuttle service for guests who had selected a special package to take them from the hotel to Kilruddery House.  There were 21 people going and the hotel booked a 14 seater mini bus.  The hotel was completely disorganised, no-one had bothered to issue the driver with a list of passengers so basically anyone could have boarded that bus whether they had paid for it or not.  Reception eventually organised a taxi for us but only after we challenged them on what was going on and why there were not enough spaces.  I will say that the gentleman who did eventually organised a taxi for us was very polite and efficient but overall it was a very unpleasant experience. I would not go again and I would not recommend it to anyone unless they are happy to deal with chaos and disorganisation.  I do also think that perhaps this hotel was once quite lovely but it did seem to me to have seen better days and the bathroom was not particularly clean.",2,2010,08,30
238,Just back from 3 nights at Druids Glen...,Just back from 3 nights at Druids Glen Resort with wife and 2 young kids. Family room was big and spacious 2 double beds and a roll out bed. Large bathroom with separate shower. Kids loved the pool although quite busy certain times of the but thats expected. Food/Drink and service was excellent. Great to see some thought around kids meals in both restaurant and bar. Overall we had great time just sorry i didn't bring the golf clubs!,4,2010,08,25
238,Great place for all family,"booked one night on line as looked fantastic as catered for kids, although seemed as if very much a golfing resort. beautiful hotel. staff very pleasant and very very helpful when approached with any query.although only one night available online, when arrived was able to book extra night immediately.decor lovely breakfast great with a egg chief for extra range freshly made dishes.my boys aged 8 and 10 had no complaints and they can be very fussy. would definitley recommend this hotel and would definitely go back, hopefully in near future",5,2010,08,25
238,"Fabulous service, views and golf","My wife and I recently spend ten days at the resort and thoroughly enjoyed the service, room, views and golf. Beds are great.  Still close enough to Dublin for day trips. Their two golf courses are fantastic and the views from the Druids Glen course are beautiful with flowers and immaculate landscaping. My wife and I would return in a heartbeat.",5,2010,08,24
238,Not for couples...noisy family child friendly resort,"My husband and I recently stayed the weekend at Druids Glen after receiving a gift voucher.  We we disappointed overall with the large number and high volume of children about the place.  The place is marketed as a 5 star resort/retreat but since Marriott branding ended, it seems to be following the Kellys of Wexford model of aiming for Irish families holidaying at home (I now know to avoid hotels with Children's Games rooms!).  It is not exclusive nor relaxing for a couple on their own to constantly hear children running, yelling and crying outside their hotel room and in the breakfast room (where one young boy was playing with a soccer ball).  The rooms are ordinary - we booked a suite and aside form a second adjoining room with a sofa and second TV - there was nothing grand or impressive about the suite, which had no view whatsoever  (the mini bar made us feel like we were in a dry zone - only had gin and coke).  On the plus side - the food at dinner was excellent - very high standards are obviously set by the head chef - who deserves all credit and our waitress was lovely, as were earlier bar staff.  Breakfast was hectic and although it ran to 11 am seemed to start ending at around 10 am in that nothing was replenished or available.  Having stayed recently at The Ritz Carlton at Powerscourt, I can say that Druids Glen is not in the same league and as a couple with no kids, we won't be going back.",3,2010,08,23
238,This is NOT a 5star property,"Very dissappointed after a weekend stay here. My main complaints are the family room had two ""double"" beds but the beds are WAY too small for two adults - we had to ask for a rollaway . The kids were not impressed with the games room - nothing worked and it really looked like it's seen better days. We only  ate at the hotel one night and , although the food was good, it was way too pricey for what we got. Overall I felt this hotel was ""nice"" and "" ok"" but certainly not luxurious or anything special, which is what I would expect from a property claiming to be 5-star.",3,2010,08,16
238,Excellent value for money,"Was a little worried with some past reviews,  however we couldn't fault the hotel.  We had a large room with 2 double beds  and a guest bed.  The rooms were comfortable and clean.  The kids loved the pool, although a seperate kids pool would have been nice.  On arrival the kids got an activity pack which kept them occupied for a while.  A playground on the grounds of the hotel would be handy.  However lots to do in the surrounding area for the kids.  Two nights cost us €160 and although I would probably rate the hotel as a four star rather than a five star,  I thought this was excellent value for money.  Kids also dine free with an adult.",4,2010,08,13
238,Nowhere near the service you would expect from a 5 star hotel,"I must be entirely honest and say that me and my husband were not at all impressed with Druid's Glen resort. Upon arrival on Saturday evening we were staying in a non-smoking room, neither of us smoke and I am currently pregnant and even the smell of cigarette smoke makes me feel ill. When we checked into room 112 which was supposed to be a non smoking room there was a distinct smell of cigarette smoke. I rang reception and asked to be moved and the girl on reception said to give her a couple of minutes and she would ring back. We never heard back from her after this phone call. We had our dinner in the brasserie that evening and the waiting staff seemed to be new, the service was very poor and twice the wrong main course was brought to our table. The food was excellent though - compliments to the chef but the waiting staff were apalling. When we went to sleep that night I discovered that our room was part of an adjoining suite because at two in the morning I was awoken by the couple next door and their friends who returned from a night out. I am not sure if it was the fact that they were speaking so loud or there was no soundproofing in the room but I could hear every word they were saying and was kept awake until 3.30 am. Breakfast the following morning was from 7 to 11. We entered the breakfast room at 10.30 am. The cold buffet counter was almost empty and was not restocked at all and the hot buffet food was cold. The plates were in a bain marie to warm them and it wasn't even turned on. We found it hard to find a table to sit down at as most tables were not cleaned off from previous guests. We were given our tea the minute we sat down - the tea was not made fresh but presented in a thermos flask (table in corner of room full of thermos flasks of tea and coffee) and we were finished our breakfast and were ready to leave before the toast arrived. The breakfast was so bad we didn't even bother going down for it on the second morning. There was no brochure in the room to review the spa treatments so I visited the spa to get a brochure. The girl on the desk in the spa handed me a brochure when I asked for it but did not even look up at me from her computer.  I must say all and all we were very disappointed with the service in this hotel. Their was a very obvious lack of a manager at both the dinner and breakfast service. I got so frustrated at one point that I felt like getting up and issuing instructions to the staff myself. This is a hotel that prides itself on its 5 star status but I can assure you that the service is no where near 5 star. Having stayed in Ashford castle, Adare Manor and Dromoland Castle, Druids Glen is only a 3 star hotel compared to the three just mentioned. We will not return to the resort again.",2,2010,08,09
238,Wish we could have stayed longer,"I recently stayed here for the Irish bank holiday weekend and we had a great time. The staff really are an asset to the hotel. Everyone was so friendly and no request was too much trouble. We brought our 3 month old son and felt completely comfortable in the hotel with him. The hotel is relly child friendly. We even brought our microwave steriliser for the baby's bottles and the restaurant staff had no problems in popping it in the microwave whenever we needed it.
Pool was lovely and ideal for our son. It was his first time in a swimming pool and we are so glad we brought him here. We ate lunch and dinner in the bar and also had a dinner in the restaurant and every meal we had was lovely. Food and drinks are a little expensive but it is to be expected in a five star hotel. The quality was very good though. Thoroughly enjoyed breakfast also. 
My mum also came with us and had booked a seperate room. We had got very good rates for our rooms so actually didnt check if there was a single occupancy rate for my mum's room. However after checking in the receptionist came and found us to let us know that my mums room rate was being reduced as it was single occupancy. Again I thought that this was a lovely touch and a reflection of how good the staff are. 
This was my second visit to the hotel. The first was in oct last year with my mum and niece when i was pregnant and i decided then i would be back when my baby was born.
Im already looking forward to my next visit!!",5,2010,08,05
238,A place to chill or be energetic.,"Reading through previous reviews and having stayed at this resort about five years ago I almost cancelled a two night break for my husband and our two oldest grandchildren. Those who wrote previous reviews must not have stayed at the same hotel! We could not praise the hotel enough. Staff efficient and helpful - never stop smiling. Meals were beautiful - rooms lovely and spotless - the resort itself is set in the middle of the countryside with spa, swimming pool, golf course and club house which provides lovely food. Staff there and in shop were excellent. The hotel have about six bicycles and helmets all provided free for residents to explore surroundings. I encourage anyone wanting scenery close to Greystones, Wicklow, Avoca etc and everything you would expect in a 5* hotel to GO. Don't miss trout fishing at Annamoe!! Great fun.  Brittis Bay about 30 minutes away - gorgeous sandy beach. Music entertainment and barbecue option on Friday nights in hotel. We opted for restaurant  - staff excellent. Breakfast buffet style with all you could wish for at hot food area. Children loved freshly cooked crepes.",5,2010,08,02
238,Recently stayed here for a night away...,"Recently stayed here for a night away with my husband, we booked a double room b&b with a spa treatment for €210 total. It was fabulous & the staff were lovely. The spa is a real treat & the swimming pool was great for a morning swim. We have stayed before a few years ago & the place hasn't lost any of it's charms. It is also ideal for families.",4,2010,07,18
238,"Fantastic Trip , Wonderful Hotel - shame we were subjected to fraud by the hotel !!!!","Organised a trip of 16 men  ( some from Ireland and some travelling over from England)to Druids Glen - booked via Golfbreaks.com - who were fantastic, very helpful and gave us a great deal.
Beautiful hotel and fantastic course , could not fault the facilities in any way.
Only downside was the hotel took 2 unauthourised payments from my credit card - one was for the mini bar contecnt and the other random amount was a mistake !!! Luckily the credit card Co put our account on hold, although my 8 month wife was not too pleased at home when trying to purchase a new pram !!! After the brief apology from reception I come hom eto discover 5 more attempts - i sussessful to take money from my credit card - ranging from £500 - £1300. I am writing to Druids Glen and think this is a police matter - so beware !!!!!!!!!! Such a shame as other then that a fantastic time was had by all !!!!",1,2010,07,15
238,terrible,"As a birthday present for my wife i thought i would whisk her of and our 7 week od baby to a five star hotel for the night. We stayed there on a Saturday night but we found the whole experience very disapointing. On our arrival to our room we noticed that the roon was very basic and the hotel had failed to supply us with a travel cot. We phoned reception and they brought the cot to our room but we has to send it back as it was very dirty, i would not put my dog in it dont mind the baby. As the roon had two beds in it that were the smallest double beds i have ever seen i had to sleep in one and my wife had to sleep in the other with our child. As for the breakfast the next morning it was very cold and dissapointing. They say this hotel is five star but i have been in better 3 star hotels.",3,2010,07,07
238,Never again!,"Was so disappointed with the hotel!!!! Paid €200 for one night and wish I had stayed in a BB as It would be much more relaxing.
Air conditioner did not work, carpet in room was dirty, furniture really old, nothing good to say about the room at all....well staff were nice and pleasant but I will not recommend this place to anyone!",1,2010,07,06
238,Lovely weekend stay - recommended,"Great hotel, we got a 2 night B&B plus dinner deal which was good value. Staff corteous, although housekeeping staff put pressure on us to vacate the room in the morning, we felt. Breakfast generous and delicious. Dinner superb. House wine far too expensive!! I guess that is where they make money... In our room there were bath towels and robe for 1 person only, but a phone call to reception sorted that imediately. Spa and lesuire centre impressive too. Highly recommended.",4,2010,06,27
238,Really a four-star - but still worth a visit,"Considering that this is a five-star hotel, we were slightly disappointed with our stay in Druids Glen. The rooms were four-star at best and the decor of both the rooms and the hotel generally - apart from the lobby - look dated. 

Druids Glen has fantastic staff though, who were accommodating, informative and friendly. We were allowed change room not once but twice with no problem whatsoever. The receptionist also recommended nearby cinemas to go to, looked up movies for us to see and gave us directions to the cinema! 

We were on a with-dinner package so had dinner in the Brasserie. The food was mediocre, particularly given the cost of it. It was a hot evening too and we noticed a couple of flies buzzing around the restaurant. On the flip-side, the restaurant was surrounded by windows which gave great views out into the hotel grounds. 

My better half used the swimming pool and jacuzzi on both nights and found it excellent, spacious and modern.

On the second night we found ourselves next door to some giddy children, who were still making noise at 4:30 a.m. We complained and the night-porter sorted the situation straight away by speaking to the parents. There was no further noise and the hotel were good enough to knock the drinks we had charged to our room off our bill as a gesture of goodwill.

All in all we'd recommend Druids Glen for a getaway weekend - it's a half-hour from Dublin city centre and is located in beautiful surroundings. It's expensive, though, and is really a four-star hotel; but if you can get a good deal on it, go for it!",4,2010,06,22
238,A precious gem,"We live within 30 minutes drive of the hotel, however having stayed there for both business and pleaseure previously, we decided to take a night out and bring some of my extended family. All in all, it is a lovely hotel, excellent staff, many of whom were familiar since my prior stays, very friendly and consistent. We just wanted to relax around the hotel and enjoy some nice food and wine and we did ! We brought our 6 month child and they were very accomodating. My mother and sister used the SPA and were very impressed. The room was clean, very comfortable, modern and bright. The following morning, after an excellent buffet breakfast, we used the leisure facilities and went for a gentle swim. The accomodation value was competitive, however a drink at the bar was a bit expensive and certainly more expensive than a normal bar. We will be back again and again.",5,2010,06,19
238,Lost in translation,"We booked a golf break for two nights. On arrival,  no receptionist was available and a porter whose English was poor asked us to wait. When the receptionist arrived, she understood that we wanted to use the computer, despite having the booking voucher in her hand. She then asked our name ( which was on the voucher) and then gave us a check-in form with a different name. We got to our room eventually, which was fine.
The Gruids Glen golf course was in excellent condition, and the golf staff were very helpful. We did not eat dinner in the restaurant because we thought it was expensive and was empty. On our second morning, we needed some more milk, and phoned room service. We asked for milk, and were offered a mop. We emphasised that it was milk we required for our morning tea. Five minuted later a mop arrived!!!
We understand that the hotel has recently changed hands from being a Marriot. The new owners must ensure that all their staff can understand English and have the ability to listen",3,2010,06,07
238,Disappointing,"Stayed here in Feb for a romantic post Valentine weekend away. Stayed in this hotel twice before and always thoroughly enjoyed it. Diappointed this time. Room was sub standard for a 5 star. Two of the tiniest double beds I have ever seen (barely bigger than a single), despite requesting a room king bed. When I rang reception to see if it was possible to move to a king room (which is what we stayed in previously) this was not entertained at all!  I then tried to book a table in the restaurant for 8pm only to be told there were no tables available and the only time we could get a table was 6.30pm Eventually we got a table for 7pm only to find the restaurant 2/3rds empty! When we left at 9pm there were still at least 15 tables empty. On a positive note the food in the restaurant was top notch, as was the service - all waiting staff were extremely friendly and professional.",3,2010,06,06
238,Service at its best,"Just returned from a great weekend at this hotel and felt compelled to write a review.  The service by staff from the minute we arrived was top class.  The polish barman excelled, the receptionest was at her best and the other young girl doing floor service in the bar was ever helpful.  The restaurant manager couldn't do enough and the french waiter had great attention to detail.  I had two spa treatments which were fab and with 30% off for residents they were the best value i ever received, as was the package for 2 nights B&B with meal.  What ever training these staff are receiving it is money well spent!
The meal was fab as was breakfast.  The one man band playing on sat night was excellent.
highly recommend this hotel.",5,2010,05,23
238,Up in Icelandic Ash,"Hi there,

Three other golfers and myself were heading to Spain for 5 days golfing when the ash from Iceland had its say.  All flights were cancelled that morning and we had to look at alternative arrangements.  Golfing conference at my house at 4:00am, searched the net looking at all the posssible options when we came across Druids Glen, 2 days golfiing and 1 night stay.  Headed off and arrived there after lunch.  

Hotel
Very nice in deed, people on the desk were friendly and helpful, rooms great, Spa, pool and gym perfect, dinner excellent no complaints what so ever. 

Checked in and went straight to Druids Glen course where we were amazed, the course was in tip top condition, asked if we could play off the white markers and were granted our wish without any fuss. Greens perfect speed for low to mid teen handicappers everyone in the party thought the place was amazing, it was golfing heaven.  If your are a golfer then this is one think to add to the list of, ""99 things to do before you die"".  From the 1st right to the 18th hole they all offered something different, wish i could have played it again and again.  The par3 12th, Irelands answer to Agusta and the 13th, ""the snakes"" difficult but what a challange. Can't say enought about this place just brilliant.  Hope to return and play it in a real competition someday soon.  By the way, the match we played that day ended all square, I shouldn't have 3 putted the last!

238,Yet Another Memorable Stay at this Wicklow Getaway,"We stayed for 3 nights with our 19 month old son for Easter. We had stayed here before on more than one occasion. This visit was just as good as the others. The staff couldnt have been more helpful and pleasant and the hotel still retains a fresh and spacious feeling. Room was nice and big and clean. Food was very tasty and thankfully the weather held up. Spa facilities and treatments were actually good value which is vital in this climate. Only suggestion I would have is that they should keep an eye on air conditioning in lobby and conservatory at the bar as it got a bit overpowering heat wise now and then. Other than that, no problem at all, keep up the good work.",5,2010,04,12
238,Winter break,"I've been meaning to write a review for a while now, we stayed here for a few days in December last as a 5 year anniversary. It was an enjoyable experience. We had a suite with own firplace and all the trimings. 
It was an enjoyable break, we had left our kiddies behind and found that there was loads of family's and kiddies there. It was busy and the resturant was busy, some of the staff looked a little stretched at the time and some orders got mixed up at the time. We were in relaxation mode so we didnt cause any fuss about it.
Overall a nice stay and we'd bring the whole famly the next time as perhaps its more aimed at that market.",4,2010,03,26
238,"Great Golf, Great Food, Great stay!","I have just returned from my first stay at the Marriott Druids Glen and after hearing so much about the resort I am delighted to say I was not disappointed. Being a golfer I was in my element with two magnificent courses on site - in my opinion Druids Glen is the finest parkland in Ireland. The Hotel met all my expectations with spacious rooms friendly staff and great facilities. The food in the Hotel was very good but fairly standard Hotel fare, I did find a little gem in the fairways bistro which is adjacent to the golf shop at Druids Heath and  is normally the used to cater for the golfers. The food here was fantastic and great value, my wife and I had a fantastic 3 course Sunday Lunch for €25 which included wine or a pint - the manager there also told me that they open as a bistro during the summer months with a full A la Carte Menu in the evenings - highly recommended!!!! After playing terrible on both courses I think i will certainly have to come back",4,2010,03,25
238,Excellent Food and Accomodation,We just  had a lovely relaxing stay at this hotel.  We would recommend it as a great location from which to explore Wicklow area.  The staff are very friendly and attentive.  The dinner was excellent and not too formal.,5,2010,03,21
238,Just like at homeU,The hotel is really good. We have been going to this hotel for the last seven years. I've never been unsatisfied. The rooms are quite big and the service is excellent. I totally recommend this hotel.,5,2010,03,19
238,very nice hotel in seculded location,"This is a very nice place if you want to get out of the city a bit and really get into the countryside of Ireland but yet not be too far away from Dublin. This place is in a nice area in wicklow area. The hotel is very nice looking, the rooms were clean and roomy. Hotel staff was nice and gave us some directions to local places. They also had a very nice pool and spa area with changing room. The grounds are very nice, and I'm not a golfer but there was a golf course as well. Overall this was a very pleasant stay that we enjoyed a lot.
I see a lot of people saying this is NOT a 5 star place, and that's probably true. I mean this hotel is very very nice but not like ultra luxurious or anything. It's probably what I would consider a very nice 4 star hotel. We stayed on points so its hard to sum up the value, it seems like the normal price for this hotel is quite high, so would we ever stay again? I guess it would depend on the ""deal"" but if the price is right or you stay on points this is a wonderful place to explore some of Ireland's countryside.

Keep in mind it is out there on it's own, no other food shopping around. To some this is a good thing, to others it means you are at the mercy of the hotel, they are the only option for dining, etc. So plan accordingly. Though a town is not a far drive away and Dublin is only about a half hour away as well.",5,2010,02,05
238,Perfect getaway,"We have just got back from a two day break between Christmas and New Year and feel we must say how much we enjoyed our second stay here.  We agree with some previous reviews that it probably is more four star than five (no concierge, slightly dated and corporate feel to some areas), however, that is more than made up for with fantastic welcome, exceptionally attentive staff, very good food, superb gym, great spa facilities and lovely atmosphere. This is not an opulent hotel, but instead offers a relaxed and sophistcated feel without undue stuffiness in a beautiful location and with fantastic facilities and charm.
The hotel was very busy with a wedding on our first night and a party on the second, and there were lots of young families with children running around, but all were well behaved and added to the Christmassy feel.  A lovely hotel and the perfect getaway",5,2010,01,01
238,Definetly not a 5 star!!!,"Just back from a Halloween break at the Marriott Hotel at Druids Glen.  We had read previous reviews on Trip Advisor last week on this hotel and would have concelled if we had been able to get a replacement hotel at short notice.  On check-in, the receptionist was friendly and welcoming.  Our rooms were ready, even though we checked in at 1.30pm.  There was no sign however of any concierage and no help was offered with our luggage, which you would expect with a 5 star hotel. 

We had 2 interconnecting rooms which were very spacious and clean but a little dated and not 5 star luxury!

The changing rooms down at the pool were the most dissappointing part of our stay.  They were very cramped and full of young families.  The showers were very dirty and the shower soap dispensers were all empty and had fallen off the wall in 2 of the showers.  We used the pool 3 times during our stay at various times of the day, and at not time did we see any staff cleaning the changing area.  The showers were in the same state all 3 times.

This is a good 3-4 star hotel to stay in if you have young children.  We have 2 teenagers and a 9 year old.  Our 9 year old loved it especially the games room.  The hotel is full of very young families with alot of toddlers and young children running around everywhere.

We have stayed in the neighbouring hotels Brookelodge and The Ritz Carlton in Wicklow and both are in a different league than here.  It does not deserve its 5 star rating!

The positive points are the friendly staff, the location and the food in the restaurant which was good value!",3,2009,10,30
238,Fabulous,"It was our 10th Wedding Anniversary and the food in the restaurant was fabulous.
Peter, really looked after us and even gave us complimentary glass of wine each with our dessert. The service, the food absolutely exquisite.  I will be defenitely going back even though i only live about 20 min drive from there.",5,2009,10,18
238,"Good, not Great.","I totally agree with previous reviewers that this is not the 5 star hotel that it is billed as.  My wife and I stayed here last week on the 2nd night of a 8 day trip throughout Ireland.  We booked the room via points as a Marriott member, and we eagerly anticipated the stay.  The hotel is about 20 miles south of Dublin in the Wicklow Mts., and is a good jumping off point for sightseers who want to start their sightseeing early in the morning without having to deal with Dublin traffic.  We arrived at the hotel in the afternoon and found the check-in and free parking to be great.  We agreed that our room was decent (nice big tub for the wife).  For a Friday night, the hotel seemed to be pretty deserted.  In the morning we had breakfast in the dining room.  My wife opted for the cold buffet, while I had the hot.  Small complaint but the chef cooking the omlettes was hiding out in the kitchen and nowhere to be seen until I asked for him, and later the same thing happened to another couple eating breakfast.  The overall service in the dining room left much to be desired.  Overall I'll the hotel 4 stars as it is obviously above the ""Courtyard"" standards, but they should know it's nowhere near 5-star standards - especially compared with Ashford Castle where we stayed later in the week.  Everyone should take notes from Ashford on what 5-star means!",4,2009,10,17
238,5 Star - no way!,"Booked a 2 nights stay in this hotel prior to visiting family. Sorry we did rooms are dated, no sign of any concierge during stay, breakfast poor (cold), internet charges high, shower tray cracked, not the cleanest hotel - the terrace area off the restaurant was dirty and not cleaned during our stay. Damp patches on one wall in our room, bedroom carpet not quiet reaching the same wall. Guess they had a leak at some stage.  Loud humming sound from an air con unit outside room meant we could not leave window open at night. Overall lacking attention to detail which is expected of a 5 star hotel. Also stayed at the 4 star Ashrourne Marriott which is a far superior hotel in every way.  

Most staff here very professional and friendly. Cecilia in the restaurant was a star! On check out when asked did we enjoy our stay , we informed the receptionist about the room - she did not seam to care and was very matter of fact and not friendly. ( She was not Irish)",2,2009,09,28
238,Enjoyed the golf.. not quite 5* though.,"Very nice hotel nice, light, bright and airey. The food however wasnt great, breakfast a bit on the cold side, the toast not quite toasted, the coffee not hot enought. The omlettes very good and can recommend these. The staff were very pleasnt but not an Irish person among them so the cead mile failte was a little bit lacking. The first room they gave us was a smoking one and did not think there was such a thing anymore. Dissapointed with that as I have children and requested non smoking. The decor of the room was lovely but not quite 5*.",3,2009,09,25
238,'Nice' but not 5 Star,"Nice hotel but not of 5 star standard, have known 4*'s to be of a much better standard, let alone 5* Got a deal on this hotel but if we'd paid the full rate would have been raging and wouldn't have been at all impressed in comparison to other 4 and 5*'s we've stayed in.  What was good - clean reception area, nice resturant, friendly staff (resturant staff were excellent) and helpful with young children, children's buffet was especially thoughtful and great for feeding children quickly - excellent!.  The rooms were fairly standard - ours was falling apart abit in places, safe didn't work, safety lock on door was about to come off, very dusty aroung tea/coffee area - don't think it had been used for a while or dusted for even longer - bathroom was clean however, thought it very strange as classed as a 5* there was the bare supply of shampoo, conditioner & body lotion - that was it , no shower cap, no sewing kit - the things that one would expect - especially if you paid the full price - perhaps they take them out if you get it cheaper!  Beds were very comfortable and cot supplied was okay.   We had breakfast in our room which was fine and was on the dot of time!   The walls/doors were paper thin, late at night there was a very inconsiderate man and children who decided to stop outside our door for a very loud chat  whilst the children ran up and down- which woke our two children, obviously not the hotel's fault, but could do with sound proofing.  Overall nice hotel, at a push and i'm being reasonable 4* ish , great staff, child friendly - didn't observe or hear children on the ground floor tearing around as someone had previoulsy reported (just outside our room).  I actually choose the hotel because of its child friendly policy - great if you're not used to 4* or 5*'s comforts.  Again so glad we didn't pay full price or else this review would have been completely different.",3,2009,09,02
238,Lovely Hotel and one of the best golf courses ever played,"Booked a two night stay at this hotel which was lovely. Requested an early check in but was unable to get into the room until 4.00pm. Room was a good size and clean. Stopped in the hotel on the first night for a meal, service was a bit hit and miss but food was good. Staff were very pleasant and helpful and one member even went to a local shop to get me a birthday cake for a member of our party. Druids Glen golf course was ranked as one of the best courses we have played. 

Within Druids Glen club house was a really fantastic restaurant that no one tells you about. The food was excellent and the service first class. We were the only four in the restaurant which was a real shame as this is a restaurant not to be missed. 

Overall the break was lovely and we would certainly return to Druids Glen.",4,2009,09,02
238,Relaxation and comfort at an excellent price for a 5 star hotel,"On the second night of our anniversary weekend we booked the dinner and stay deal for 210 euro.I had mentioned it was a significant anniversary when booking but did not expect the upgrade to a very spacious suite.It even had a putting machine in the comfortable library style sitting room. complete with a second bathroom. The pool and steam room were VG and as we are not golfers we enjoyed some walks in the peaceful grounds.Dinner was good quality- seabass cooked perfectly- service attentive and bed ( like all marriott hotels in my experience) especially comfortable.Breakfast good- omelettes done perfectly- bit too quick with toast , but overall a much better experience than other hotels we have stayed in in the area.",5,2009,08,29
238,Fabulous hotel with wonderful staff!,"Having spent lots of time on the internet trying to find a hotel in Wicklow with good reviews we finally settled on the Marriot due to the fact we have already stayed at other Marriotts in England which were exceptional.

We were not disappointed.  The family room , with 2 double beds was large and extemely comfortable.  Cleanliness was excellent.  The lady that cleaned our room, Patricia, kept making swans out of the towels which the children loved.  The breakfast was to die for although we have put on lots more weight!  The public areas were pristine and tea and coffee was always available in the lobby.

Our children, 10 and 8 yrs spent much time in  the free games room in the hotel which was wonderful as they kept themselves amused and made lots of friends.  The cinema and kiddies film (with popcorn)  was also an excellent idea for the children on the Friday and Saturday night.

Although other people on this site have commented negatively on children staying at the hotel , being a parent it was wonderful being able to relax knowing the children were entertaining themselves in the games room (a great idea)  Although there were a lot of families staying when we were there all the children were very well behaved and you really wouldn't have known they were there.

The surroundings were beautiful and staff friendly and attentive.  The cocktails in the bar in the evening were lovely and the bar staff couldn't have done enough for you.

We learned that this hotel will probably only be open at weekends in the winter due to the recession and that 3 other hotels in the area had closed in the last 18 months do the to economic crisis.

I sincerely hope this hotel survives the storm as it and it's staff are a credit to the Marriott chain.",5,2009,08,27
238,A lovely relaxing break,"Stayed the Druids Glen Marriott for a girlie break and had a lovely relaxing weekend.  The staff were very friendly and attentive.  The rooms were great  the beds are the most comfortable I have ever slept in with crisp linen and lots of pillows.   We enjoyed a few treatments which were very good and very reasonably priced and the therapist I had was excellent.  Dinner in the restuarant was great the lamb was very good. The only complaint I would have is that the breakfast buffet is so good that my waistline felt the effects leaving.  
Lots to do in the area and went to the village of greystones and had a browse which was nice and even managed a walk on the beach",5,2009,08,26
238,First class Service from a first class golf resort,"We (12 golfers) stayed at the Resort at the weekend on a one night/two rounds deal for £150. The hotel was fantastic and friendly. We ate at the Druids Heath clubhouse which was very affordable for a 5 star resort and the professionals at the shop were great. The Heath course is extremely tricky but we thoroughly enjoyed it. 
Breakfast in the morning was great...anything you wanted you could have had (fruit; cereals; juices; cooked breakfasts etc).
Over to Druids glen and the service was first class as you would expect. Staff were friendly and welcoming and more than helpful. No stuffiness at all.
All in all an amazing and fun filled trip and we will return.",5,2009,08,24
238,Relaxing Break,"We stayed in Druid Glen last month. The purpose of our trip as to relax and play some golf. The hotel is just a short drive from Dublin but we though we were in another land. The area is so peaceful and the country side so relaxing. From the moment we arrived - greeted by the Hotel Manager whom really made us feel so welcome - until we had to leave , we felt so looked after. The staff were very wonderful even let us sit late for breakfast each morning !",5,2009,08,22
238,WOW!!!!!!!!!!!,"I stayed at the hotel for one week and found the hotel fantastic. I've read some negative reviews so i was a bit woried before i came, but they were soon put at ease. ok the decor in the rooms is not to the standard of some of the more exclusive hotels, but the rooms are very large and the beds are really comfy. What i think set's it apart are the staff. I travel to lots of hotels and never have I been looked after like i was there, they are extremly responsive to the guests needs. The food is very good, the manager fleets around the dinning romm and checks on the hot food every few mins. The resturant food in the evening is very very good, I have been to many 3 rossett rest's and this was as good if not better.",5,2009,08,21
238,Great Stay - Peaceful and Relaxing in the lap of luxury,"Loved this hotel with great walks and beautiful setting it made for a perfect romantic getaway for me and my husband.
Firstly I should say that I am eight months pregnant and was brought to this hotel by my husband for a relaxing break. The hotel itself is fabulous and the staff couldn't be more helpful. We walked the golf course in the evening before dinner and ate in the restaurant each evening. We weren't on a dinner package which looking back maybe we should have been and while the restaurant wasn't cheap the food was excellent and we loved it. I would recommend a trip to Glendalough which was great and definitely a stroll and ice cream in Greystones. Joanne in the spa  gives the best facial and indian head massage I highly recommend it.",5,2009,08,19
238,Overrun by noisy children,"We booked this hotel for a 3-day relaxing break at the end of a hectic wedding trip to Ireland.  The image given (and backed up by the photos) is of peace and quiet with a golfing atmosphere. Wrong - don't be fooled.  We saw very little going on golf -wise but found a hotel overrun by noisy toddlers and very young children.  There seemed to be a lot of 'nouveau' Dublin couples strolling around arrogantly whilst their children ran wild in the lobby late into the night. 
On the first night there, after a long journey, we were very pleased with out lovely quiet spacious room.  Soon we could hear children jumping around and shouting in the next room and the TV blaring with children’s programmes.  We asked the front desk to do something about it.  They were very apologetic but discovered the children were alone in there and then had to set about locating the parents who were in another room.  Breakfast every morning was a scene of 80% family tables of 3-4 children with the pushchairs and baggage that that entails.  We found the breakfast food very good but not the atmosphere.  We were glad we were planning to go out each day.
In the evenings we liked to have a quick coffee-shop type meal which was served in the bar from the bar menu.  Once again the families choose this option rather than the only other option – the main restaurant.  Food finished in the bar at 8pm so it was tight to get a table with so many tables occupied for a long time with feeding young children and those in high chairs.  Not what you expect from a ‘5 Star’? ‘golfing hotel’!  After finishing eating the children then raced to the lobby and proceeded to run around until at least 10pm.  There was a very nice seating area in the lobby by a gas fire – ideal for a coffee and a late night chat.  When we would have liked to use it all 4 sofas were taken by families with young children.  One family had a large pushchair blocking the entrance and the sofa next to it had a bagful of toys out on the floor with a toddler playing.  Two children were lying up on the back of the other two sofas.  We went up to our room and stepped over several toddlers learning to climb the stairs en route, while their proud mothers beamed on!!
You can see over the rails from the floors down into the lobby and the first thing you hear each morning and last thing at night are feet haring up and down the lobby with the accompanying chirruping of the children which sounded like a play group. We stayed away from the pool as having looked in, and yes, the pool had lots of young children.
We found the staff at the hotel very polite and helpful.  The hotel looks like it would be a relaxed quiet place in different circumstances. One gets the impression that during this downturn standards have slipped.  With the amount of children there one feels that the hotel must be promoting some sort of ‘as many children you can bring go free’ deal.  They seriously need to do something about this or they will have a 5 Star ‘Butlins’ on their hands.",3,2009,08,13
238,Below Par,"I spent one here during a business trip and found the hotel had been given in my opinion better ratings that it should have.  It has the appearance of a five star without that little bit extra that you expect, leaving me a little deflated.  Staffs in general were very good but on one occasion a member of the bar staff was quite abrupt and was obviously having a bad day but had forgotten to leave it a home.
I will give the hotel the benefit of doubt and return next time I am in the vicinity but in the meantime I will not be planning to go out of my way to visit this hotel.
Overall it is a very good hotel but is it a 5 *?, I'm not decided yet.",4,2009,08,11
238,Why bother?,"Stayed for two nights on a golf package. Having booked tee times three weeks in advance on arrival in clubhouse, no record. With the crowded course was only able to play 8 holes out of a possible 36. No refunds or accomodations. Food mediocre. When asked by Marriot to fill out online review did so expressing my disapointment with service. Have received no aknowledgement so....WHY BOTHER?",2,2009,08,08
238,Not 5 star!,"I stayed at the hotel recently as part of a 2 night package. From reading the website i was really looking forward to staying, but i was very disappointed.  

The hotel claims to be 5* Awarded by the AA, but clearly has the standards of a 3 star! The hotel is very dated and on arrival there was cleaners still cleaning the rooms at 3pm.  Our bed sheets has holes in them and the bathroom was not very clean and the coffee/tea making facilities were very poor.

We dined in the restaurant that night which was very good using local ingredients, but the price of alcohol is more expensive than some bars in centre of dublin!  5.50EUR For a pint of Guiness!!!
  
The breakfast we had on both days was appauling.  The staff were more concered with setting up tables and were so disorganised.  

The cooked breakfast was served on cold plates and tasted like something you would get in a greasy cafe. The tea tasted like the water was taken out of the swimming pool, also the toast was stacked on a plate and was half cooked and soggy.  I had to ask twice to have coffee becuase the tea tasted so bad!

The hotel is in a nice setting but it leaves a lot to be desired.",1,2009,08,05
238,Comfort and relaxation in rural Wicklow,"My wife and I stayed at the Marriott Druids Glen for a 2 night break in early August. The hotel is marketed as a golf resort and while there were certainly plenty of golfers there the hotel has a lot to offer by way of its location and other facilities - especially its spa treatments and its 18m pool and excellent fitness centre. There were a alot of familioes staying for the Bank Holiday weekend. It's ideally situated for exploring the Wicklow area which has lots to do and see - eg Glendalough, Powerscourt Gardens and waterfall.
We got a very competitive online rate through the Marriott Hotels website for an Executive Room for 2 nights B&B with one evening meal. The food in the restaurant  was very good, though I thought the table d'hote dinner menu was somewhat limited for a 5 star hotel. Breakfasts were very good with a wide choice of hot and cold food.
The best thing about the hotel was our room - large and well furnished with a pleasant aspect overlooking one of the 2 golf courses. The bathroom too was very large with separate bath and shower. 
The reception area is very spacious and comfortable with lots of sofas dotted around - and an open filre which even on a damp August evening was welcoming. We much preferred to take our drinks from the bar and sit in this area than in the bar itself which we thought was rather darkly furnished and unwelcoming - though the staff were pleasant and friendly.
As a base for exploring Wicklow for a few days this hotel is ideal.",4,2009,08,04
238,"Good clean ,comfortable hotel.","Having stayed at this hotel on a previous occassion I decided to go again. We only booked for one night on this occassion. 
Check in was efficient and very friendly. the room was clean and comfortable. Our room was on the ground floor.
There was a wedding party staying in the hotel on the same night and I was advised that they were being accommodated in a different part of the hotel. Unfortunately some of the party must have been in rooms next to us as we were awoken in the middle of the night by party goers, laughing and making lost of noise.... I let this go and tried to sleep.
Next morning when checking out, I advised the receptionist that I was annoyed an the noise of the wedding party. She apologised profusely and advised that she would not charge us for breakfast (which was not included in our package.)
This was a very fair offer. marriott certainly know how to provide good customer service...
I still paid for my breakfast.. my choice... as I had the meal.

I will go back again.",4,2009,08,04
238,Some like it hot!!,"Stayed in this hotel for four nights, for three nights out AC didn't work, bedroom temp at night was 23degrees, with four of us in the room, it was unbearable.  Didn't actually complain till after the second night but staff were unable to provide a fan, though they re assured us that the AC would be fixed.  Third night temperature in the room reached 24 degrees!! The next morning, while having a shower the shower head fell off in top of me! Lucklily no injury cause.  Asked again at reception for the AC to be fixed, and told them of the shower head disaster.  We were then upgraded for our last night to a suite, and one nights cost was deducted from the bill.  A lovely hotel, a bit of a journey to Dublin city, and restaurant very expensive. Overall would not be returning, not great value for the euro.",3,2009,08,04
238,Surprised at how things were handled.,"We stayed at Druids Glen last week for three nights. Though it is a lovely place, a few incidents marred it for us. We had two dinners with our package, on both nights the menu was exactly the same. Kids buffet was bland and unappetising. On first night my daughters got a game of ludo from receptionist. Next night they went again to get it at reception, diff receptionist told them she was putting a €25 charge on the room until they returned it. It was a €2 shop boardgame!!!! My daughter did'nt even understand what she meant but I had heard her. We got packed lunches every day as part of our package, crisps included were out of date each day.

Not quite what you would expect from a 5 star hotel!!!",3,2009,08,03
238,Lovely Family Dinner at the Marriott,"Had an early bird dinner for my sisters' birthday with family and 2 small children and couldn't say enough good things about it - atmosphere perfect and really suitable for children, the staff were really lovely and looked after after us so well and the food was excellent and great value. Would definitely be back.",5,2009,08,01
238,Romantic place,"I stayed there with my friend for holidays. Very great spa center with swimming pool and sauna - great relax! Room service could be a little bit better as we were waiting for clening our room quite long in the first day. It's strange that mini bar is filled only upon the request.
But the breakfast was amazing - very good! Also the bar is very good, barmans can make a good cocktails.... :)
Very good place for romance and those who are tired from city life.",4,2009,07,26
238,Excellent - Will definitely be back!,"We have just returned from a fabulous 5 day break at Druids Glen.  The hotel is lovely and in beautiful surroundings.  My husband played golf at Druids Heath which he said was beautifully maintained.  The food is really excellent, probably the nicest food we have eaten for some time.  The rooms are lovely, similar to other Marriott Hotels with the comfortable bedding and handy fridge/mini bar.

Overall we had absolutely no complaints and can't wait to return.",5,2009,07,26
238,"Lovely Hotel, Great Location","My husband and two year old daughter, along with friends and their 12 year old twin girls, have just returned from a three night stay at this hotel. We had asked for early check-in and were allocated our rooms as soon as we arrived. Excellent start ! 
Our rooms were spacious with the usual Marriott comfortable beds. The staff were all very good and even though this was a very busy weekend we could not have been treated any better.
Regarding the location, we found everywhere we wanted to visit was within 20-30mins away.(Great when you have an active toddler with you). We also loved the breakfast , and ate in the druids brasserie, and the bar. Steak in the brasserie was lovely,overall i would recommend this hotel to anyone.
We also loved the leisure facilities, especially the cold plunge pool !
We will definately go back.",5,2009,07,17
238,Cozy and the best breakfast I ever had in a hotel,"The hotel is located basically in the middle of nowhere which makes you need to rent a car to get there, but for those who enjoy nature it´s wonderful!, The views are amazing!
If you need to use the internet don´t even bother bringing your laptop ´cos the connection is charged at a very high price!, which in my opinion should be for free since I´ve stayed in 4 star hotels before that had wi-fi for free!, Don´t forget this is a 5 star hotel and they charge a lot for it!
The jacuzzi and the heated pool are the highlights, the GYM is also great but the breakfast is really the best I ever had, there´s even a chef available to prepare the omelete the way you want it!, Great stay!",4,2009,07,16
238,"Not quite 5 star, but pretty special nonetheless","A friend and I took a short break in Wicklow last weekend.  We stayed in the Marriott in Druids Glen.  Lovely rooms, friendly helpful staff and great food.  It is billed as 5 star but I think it falls a little short of this rating - the decor isn't quite up to 5 star level.  Saying that, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  Our package included dinner in the hotel restaurant - food was excellent.  Another lovely touch was the homemade lemondade at hotel reception.  I was also very pleased to see that the bathroom had a separate bath and walk in shower - always a plus.  But the highlight for us was the entertainment in the hotel bar on the Saturday night.  A young man with guitar - Kris Finnerty - entertained us for hours with a wonderful mix of music.  The icing on the cake to a lovely weekend!",5,2009,07,10
238,Lovely hotel with amazing grounds,"I stayed at the Marriot for a family wedding.  I thought everything was really good.  On arrival after the ceremony, the staff were really friendly and helpful and fast as I had to be at the reception in a limited amount of time.  They catered well for my family which was really good to have us all in the same part of the hotel.  I found it humourous however that my television welcomed me as a Miss and my mum/stepdad/sis's and their partners were welcomed as Mr and Mrs's.  However they were greeted as Mr Ann and Mrs Patrick for example! Hilarious!  The option for breakfast was brilliant and I decided to breakfast in my room the first night of my stay.  The breakfast was delicious and on time.   The cleaning staff were very decent as they left a couple of extra bottles of water for me and folded my jammies! I had never stayed in a 5 star before and to be honest although there were some signs to show that it was a 5 star, I didn't feel it was making a huge effort to hold this standard.  They had those luggage collectors (as seen in Pretty Woman hehe!) but other than that there was nothing hugely different to most other hotels I've stayed in.  I did really enjoy myself in saying that and they had a kettle with loads of tea and coffee and lots of hangers and phones in the room.  I also had 2 beds in my room which was great so to make the most of my experience I slept in one the first night and the other onethe second night.  There was about 10 pillows on the beds as well which I really liked - not sure why cos most of them ended up on the floor. Check out was quick and efficient and pleasant.",4,2009,06,17
238,Wonderful location and Hotel,"We stayed a week as the base of our travels around southern Ireland and had the best time.  We stayed during off season (early June) and the hotel was empty.  As a frequent Marriott guest, we were complementary upgraded to a suite.  The pub/bar was fun, the restaurant gourmet and the hotel facilities outstanding.  2 golf courses, an outstanding exercise facility and pool/spa.  Staff were great and very accomodating.  Only a 30 minute drive to downtown Dublin, 45 min to airport.  Lots of scenery and attractions nearby.  Worth the visit!",5,2009,06,16
238,Heavenly,"After touring Ireland for 12 days, it was heaven to stay in a luxury hotel.  The bed was to die for.  The room was large.  The bathroom was up to par.  The staff was incredible.  We ate at the local restaurant and the food was delicious.  Truly a 5 star hotel with out the expense.",5,2009,06,07
238,Worked really well for me,"I stayed twice for one night on each occasion when I was in the Dublin area and wanted to travel south for an early tee time to play The European Club.  They had a senior rate with a morning breakfast that was excellent.  I will try to return to this hotel again for a multi-night stay and play the golf courses there was well as returning to the European Club.  The little towns of Newmount Kennedy, Greystones, and Wicklow were nice spots close by with decent pub food. 

Internet is available in the business center for five euros for 30 minutes.",5,2009,06,03
238,"Warm, Friendly and Excellent Value for Money","This was my second stay here, and I have to say it is still a lovely relaxing place to stay, with everything you need whether away on business or have a break away.

Rightly or wrongly I always judge a hotel by the way I am greeted by the staff as much as the facilities and food, and I have to say they score 100% every time here. Every member of staff I have met in the hotel have been so warm and friendly and nothing is too much trouble. 

The fact that all this is on top of a great hotel, with good food and reasonable prices in a great setting means that I'll book it again.",5,2009,05,28
238,So poor I wouldn't go back!,"We used to always treat my parents to a break away here and they always came back happy. Although, the last time they stayed there they said that it was ""so poor I wouldn't go back!"" They had problems with the room and the shower that weren't handled correctly. When checking out, they were asked was everything ok and when they said that it wasn't the staff member replied with ""oh well"". 
Such a pity for such a nice hotel.",2,2009,05,23
238,Standards Slipping,"I went for a celebration meal with my family last weekend.  I've stayed in the hotel before and have always raved about it to friends but I have to say I felt quite dissapointed on this occassion.  The food was nice enough but it certainly wasn't five star hotel quality and very  overpriced at that.  I agree with the reviewer below that you can see there has been cut-backs, completely understandable in this climate, but they really do need to improve on the quality and choice of food in the restaurant if they are to maintain their five star standard.  I wasn't impressed to be handed a single A4 page as a menu either.  The waiters were lovely and very attentive but the management really need to look at the quality of the food and on the minor details that make up for the whole experience. I wouldn't return or recommend based on my experience, I really hope they sharpen up as it really is a fantastic establishment in the most beautiful surroundings.",3,2009,05,22
238,really good place,"stayed on a thursday night, super location and faciltiies.  The hotel is a really cool place and the swimming pool and gym are really super.  The food was very good and service really nice.  They went ot a lot of bother and got us a room with 3 beds in it.",4,2009,05,02
238,Peaty!,"Stayed for 2 nights whilst my company held an event nearby.

Very nicely designed hotel, most of the staff very friendly and helpful. 

Limited and expensive restaurant menu. Breakfast service was very slow.

Very nice room but one drawback is the local water. Thankfully the hotel provide a couple of bottles of complementary water as out of the tap comes a very peaty, off colour liquid!

Has a very nice pool and a reasonable gym.",4,2009,04,14
238,needs to shape up to 5* standards,"Booked a package mid week. I had to make my mind up about which spa treatments I needed in advance, the times allocated were inconvenient as I wanted to explore the area.I understand that in view of the economic climate the hotel can not have spa staff sitting around doing nothing..and needed to know in advance. but it takes away from the feeling of a luxury break. My room was not clean with what looked like vomit on the base of the lampshade.The housekeeping cleaned it up straight away.The breakfasts and service in the hotel were outstanding,everybody was friendly and helpful and the location was divine.For a 5* hotel I would expect bottled water and glasses in the room the mini bar was empty(we could have had it filled on request!) The bathroom consists of shampoo,body lotion, shower cap but no conditioner and the little things that  give it the a 5* feel.Personally we both felt ""cut backs"" were the order of the day. You have to request the robes and slippers, and too many notices around  the bedroom and bathroom about conserving water and energy by re-using towels and not having your bed sheets changed every day. We went for a break away from it all , not to be following too many rules.!!! Over all the stay was nice and I would return. The spa staff were pleasant and polite and so good at their job.The hotel just needs to be reminded that its a 5 not 4 star. They could also get rid of the 20 Euro charge to avail of internet facilities.",3,2009,03,31
238,Nothing out of the ordinary,"My family and I have just spent a weekend at the Marriott Druids Glen.
Although its a very clean well designed hotel I find it hard to believe that its a 5 star.
When we had breakfast on the first morning many tables were covered in dirty dishes and remained like that for the 45 mins that we were there. Although we arrived 1 hour before breakfast ended. There was little or no buffet food  ( fruit, bread etc)and no clean dishes.
There were no dressing gowns/ slippers in wardrobe or delivery of newspaper as promised.",3,2009,03,23
238,Treated like  a QUEEN,"Just a quick note to say I spent the most wonderful evening in the Marriott Hotel in Druids Glen. We booked a twin room which had fabulous views, the service was second to none and the highlight of my stay. I felt like a queen, we had massages during the day in the tranquil spa with a swim afterwards. 

The food was excellent, my steak was cooked perfectly and the desert was delicious. Breakfast was outstanding, such a wide variety I did not know what to choose, in the end settled for  mouthwatering waffels with fruit.

I would highly recommend staying there to anybody looking for some pampering.  After checking out we went for a walk through the extensive grounds. I came back to Dublin feeling refreshed and revived, I would highly recommend a night there to anyone.",5,2009,02,10
238,Great Stay!,"We stayed at the Druids Glen for a three night stay at Valentines Weekend and it remains our favourite hotel in Ireland!!  From the moment we arrived to the moment we left everything was smooth as clockwork!  And the staff couldn't have done more for you!!

Our room was beautiful, it had two double beds and was extremely spacious and was also very well equipped! There were bathrobes in the room which were great for when popping down to the Spa or pool!  My husband had arranged some Spa treatments for me to enjoy on our first afternoon here - absolute heaven and the back massage was out of this world!!  

The food was fantastic - we had room service on a few occasions and the food was always delivered quickly and piping hot!  

We hired a car from the airport and when we enquired at the concierge on some good places to visit they were only too helpful to advise on nearby places of interest (one of my favourites being the Ballykissangel pub!)  

This was a truly amazing weekend break in a fabulous hotel! We cannot wait to return!!",5,2009,01,26
238,Loved it,We got a break as a wedding present here and it was fantastic.  The grounds are beautiful.  The rooms are lovely and comfortable and the food is great!,5,2009,01,22
238,Good Response,"Just a quick note. The hotel and location on the golf course in Co. Wicklow (25miles south of Dublin) is ideal and we enjoyed our stay although we only live 40 miles away.
However, a number of little things went wrong but were corrected immediately by the helpful staff. 
We wrote a letter to the manager detailing our concerns and we got a very speedy and detailed reply.
We were quite impressed and would recommend the hotel on its good attitude as much as anything else.",4,2009,01,17
238,Great stay,"Stayed here for two night over Christmas 2008 with wife and young children.

Excellent stay from drinks upon arrival and during check-in, a great room, very friendly and helpful staff providing travel cots for our kids and colouring in books and cryaons to the kids during breakfast. I must say the friendliness and professionalism of the staff in all parts of this hotel was way above average.

Strongly recommend.",5,2009,01,01
238,Great Stay loved the hotel,"Stayed here early December with my wife and the hotel was great. The service was excellent from the receptionist who greeted us to Tomas in the restaurant.  Room was clean and comfortable, had a swim in the pool and the bar staff that evening were so pleasant it was joy to experience the hospitality. The following morning we went for a stroll on the golf course it was just breathtaking.",5,2008,12,10
238,"water, water !","was ok if overpriced. the reservation system was down when we arrived so our room wasn't ready. there was no water in the room and when I asked for some to be sent to the water i was told it would be charged at bar prices plus five euro to have it delivered (50 paces) by room service. this was very sharp practice for a hotel in that price bracket, particularly when guests cannot readily walk to a nearby shop to buy water. receptionist said management had taken a decision to remove water a few weeks previously. food was ok in fairness.",3,2008,11,09
238,not a 5 star hotel by any stretch of the imagination,"Reading the other positive reviews of this place makes me think we were in entirely different hotels. My boyfriend booked this for the long weekend for a relaxing holiday for three nights. The only thing five star about it is the price. The hotel is big airy and soul-less. The build quality of the rooms is atrocious. The walls of the room shake when the doors of the adjoining rooms close. We were woken up (yes, actually woken up as opposed to ""could hear"") on the first night by a couple in the next room who were evidently on a romantic weekend away. The next night and early morning we were woken by the family in the next room. Not their fault-the walls are paper thin.
We had the continental breakfast ""in-room"" which costs €18.50 per guest plus €5 for the service to the room. It was appalling. The toast was soggy and barely warm., the hot chocolate was made with water, the tea was grim,  the fruit salad contained what looked and tasted like tinned peaches and the milk was warm. the pastries were third rate. We went into Greystones (a nearby village) the following two mornings to a place called Backstage at Belles and had a fantastic breakfast for just €10 each.
The restaurant in some ways is like an airport terminal. Always a little chilly with lots of through traffic. It is an open plan design and suffers from it. In other ways the restaurant resembles a fast food restaurant with kids running around the tables and the tables remaining uncleared for the entire duration of our meal. The only good thing about it was the sommelier and the waiter on our first night, both of whom were professional and friendly.
The food was fine but not worth the high prices. We were left waiting for an hour and fifteen minutes for our meal on the last night.   
If you have kids and want to go to a hotel which is child friendly and where your children can run around freely, and if you don't expect five star luxury for the money you pay, then this hotel may suit. If you want a relaxing five star experience then steer well clear.
It is not often that I am happy to have a holiday end but I really couldn't wait to leave this hotel.",1,2008,10,28
238,Excellent hotel,"Excellent hotel, great food, great service. No fault whatever to find, children and adult friendly.",5,2008,10,20
238,great service is still available!!,"Booked in with my wife and another couple for a getaway without the kids. Stayed for saturday night on the , and got a good rate incl. dinner and breakfast considering it is a 5star hotel. Checked in without hassle and got our bags brought to our room, not a given in the hotels i have stayed in recently. Rooms were oversized for two ppl with plenty of space, but they could do with a bit of maintenance as our carpet was torn against the wall . found out hotel is 5 yrs old so maybe its just wera and tear. went down to the bar for a bite to eat and to meet our friends who had already been shown to a table. settled in with a couple of pints and glasses of wine for the ladies beside an open fire in the conservatory part of the bar. great views of the course we were playing the next day, and even got a couple of hints from the waiter how to play the hole, didnt stop me finding water the next day though!!!! wife and her friend ordered the club sandwich, not realising the full ingredients, she cant stand egg mayo, but the manager had no hesitation in getting a fresh one which came on two seperate plates, full with chips as they were sharing, nice touch. I probably could have done with sharing my burger too which was very filling leaving little room for dinner which was booked for 3 hrs later!!! arrived back to the room for a shower, but could not find bathrobes in the room. called reception and they delivered two within 10 mins. dont see why they are not in every room?? arrived down to the hotel restaurant, which had quite a few kids in it, but was brought to another part of the restaurant which was quiet at first, but then filled up very quickly with other diners. familys seemed to be seperated which we were all happy with, as we had left our kids at home for a reason!! meal was delicious, i shared a large steak with my other half which was carved at our table. service was second to none, special mention to maeve our server who still had time for a chat. Retired to the bar again afterwards, and it was very lively with a good atmosphere. Guiness was great which is a change for hotel bars, and again we were looked after by the staff circulating the room. Just as we were heading to bed, the wedding party filtered in from their reception, i presume the atmosphere didnt die down for quite a while! beds are so comfortable, we nearly missed  breakfats next morning. extremely busy with wedding party from night before, and were asked to sit in the bar for a few mins. worth the wait, full buffett and fruits was just the ticket. overall, we had a great stay and will definitley be back. not too sure if there is much to do in the area, but would check it out if you are staying for more than a couple of days!!!",5,2008,10,13
238,absolute heaven,"this hotel is well worth a visit. Its absolutely fabulous... everything from the rooms to the bar to the dining room is 5 star. The breakfast is superb, you wont leave hungry. Omelletes and pancakes are freshly made by the chef whilst you wait. The rooms are great, beds are so so comfy and pillows that you just sink into. I can honestly say i have never slept in such a comfy bed in a hotel before.
Only one small flaw is that we arrived in late evening, and there was no bar food available, only a la carte in the dining room. We just wanted something like a wrap and wedges or curry and rice. I know there was room service avaialble, but personally feel that room service is way over priced and cannt ever justify ordering it.",5,2008,10,08
238,well worth a visit,"We stayed here on a weekend break and it was fab..  it was everything a relaxing break should be and teh hotel annd staff are amazing.  we got a weekend deal which was brilliant value for money and included an evening meal.
  You will not be disapointed with this hotel.",5,2008,09,24
238,"Great service, always a friendly welcome!","Have stayed here several times in the past year and always appreciate the warm welcome and excellent service we get here and in particular the great breakfasts!   We also bring our assistance dog with us - who works with our son - and the hotel are always so welcoming each time we return.

We book a ground floor room opening out onto the courtyard - which makes it very handy when the dog needs to spend.  The rooms are spacious and always very clean.  The ensuite is a good size although some showers are showing their age!  We have found room service very good - the children particularly enjoy the large homemade burgers and fries.

Breakfast here is one of the best we have eaten in hotels around Ireland - the omelettes and pancakes cooked to order by the chef in front of the children - always appeal.  Likewise there is always a great choice of breads, cold meats and cheeses/chutney.

We have found the food in Flynn's good but not always perfect and Delgany village and Greystones are 10/15 minutes away by  car for a different dining alternative.  Fisher's in Newtownmountkennedy is great for lunch and a good shopping stop-off.  Likewise Avoca Handweavers is well worth visiting not just for its excellent food but also the numerous shopping opportunities if affords.  

The National Garden Exhibition Centre is only five minutes away from the hotel in Kilquade and also well worth a visit.  Also, if you are visiting the hotel in autumn - a visit to Mount Usher Gardens in Ashford is a must - the autumn colours are magnificent and now that Avoca is running the restaurant there - great food too!

We always really enjoy our visits to Druid's Glen - there are great deals available throughout the year and the service and welcome will keep us coming back.",4,2008,09,02
238,Superb Hotel,"Stayed here for 2 nights, rooms are a very good size, beds very comfortable and room spotlessly clean. The view from our room comprised of the courtyard and other rooms, so not great. Staff were excellent, especially in the bar where they managed to be professional without being stuffy. Both the pool and gym were good. Breakfast is buffet style with various options cooked to order, such as omelettes, waffles etc. Breakfast was very good, dinner was good but nothing amazing, again the staff were very attentive without being overbearing. 
Other than golf there is little to do in the immediate area without access to a car.  Which explains why the hotel is such good value, certainly not cheap if it was closer to Dublin the rates would be far higher.
Only two minor complaints, the shower cubicle leaked onto the bathroom floor, but as there were so many towels it didn’t really matter. And reception mixed up our key cards on the second day although this was remedied immediately.
Overall an excellent hotel and we will be back.",5,2008,08,21
238,Gorgous hotel,"I cannot speak highly enough of the Marriott Druids Glen. Its a high class hotel with the most accomodating and friendly staff. It has the comfort of a 5 star hotel, but without the pompous attitude employed by some (eg Raddison hotel Stillorgan)
The spa is divine and the treatments fabulous. We had our wedding there and all of our guests commented on the efficiency and friendliness of the staff and on the quality of food, spa and service, Plenty of seating areas to relax in. Perfect for a weekend get away, Surprised at one of the recent reviews. Guest must have been in a fowl mood not to have enjoyed all that the hotel offers!!",5,2008,08,19
238,Not great,"This hotel is supposedly  a five star but I don't think it met the standards for that during my stay.

Firstly the positives, the staff were all very courteous and friendly. We had a meal in their restaurant and it was delicious, the menu choice was unpretentious and comprehensive but with a surprising choice of vegetarian options. The food was delightfully presented with some very interesting and unusual favour combinations.  

Problems - I requested King Bed and got a room with two doubles. One of the double beds had blood on the sheets, both top sheet and base sheet so either the person changing the bed had a cut and bled whilst making the bed or else the sheets weren't changed at all. 

The bathroom floor was dirty, some sort of dried in stains on it that looked as if they just hadn't been mopped up. The painted wall beside the toilet was covered in dubious stains. Speckles of dried in blood and smeared with faeces. 

Two problems which spoilt an otherwise pleasant one night stay. The hotel otherwise is typical of large franchise chains - anodyne, anonymous and devoid of any character. I really could have been anywhere in the world. The decor was an unhappy mix of a modern building with an artificial injection of ""olde worlde"" charm. The carpets in the rooms and the corridors look like relics from the 1980's even though the hotel isn't that old. Much the same could be said of the room furniture which looked a bit worn and tatty. The TVs in the rooms should be upgraded to modern flat screen LCD. At five star rating such things aren't really just being picky - they're expected. 

But really they need a supervisor to check their rooms before
they are certified as ready for the next guest. Dirty sheets and stained walls isn't befitting a zero star let alone five star establishments. 

There are 4 star hotels not far from here who offer a better standard. There is potential here as its quite a nice location. Our room had some lovely rural views of the Wicklow countryside and hills.",2,2008,08,18
238,Disappointing,"Myself and my husband and three other couples stayed here for a night last weekend. We had a voucher for golf, dinner and the overnight accommodation and it was planned as a nice relaxing treat for all of us.

I expected the hotel to be quite upmarket but it is not. It is a fine hotel but nothing special. It could do with a facelift and does not have much of an atmosphere. 

Pluses-friendly staff, good food at dinner and breakfast, big rooms, nice pool area and of course golf, nice location

Minuses - poor finishing in decor, sparse decor in rooms, uncomfortable beds, staff could be more efficient, no atmosphere in bar or restaurant, spa treatments nothing special. 

If you play golf this might be a good choice for you but if not I don't see much reason to stay here and there are plenty of other hotels in the area that would be much better if you are looking for a nice night or weekend away.",3,2008,08,10
238,Excellent!!,"Excellent, excellent, excellent. And not that expensive. We stayed mid-week and it was only 160 euro for the room. Enjoyed every moment there, would highly recommend it to a friend. Thank you for making our stay so enjoyable.",5,2008,08,09
238,"Clinical, lacking any character & basic.","Stayed here twice for weddings.

The hotel is very clinical, which may be perfect for the average business traveller, but we certainly couldn't recommend it for couples and definitely not for families.

The staff are all very nice and professional, however the bar staff could do with some courses on bar work for Irish weddings. For quite a large enough wedding, the bars were certainly understaffed. One bar person for 250+ guests.

While it's located on a stunning golf course, the hotel itself is built in a hole. (probably due to planning restrictions so as not to make  a negative impact on the local countryside).

In relation to food, the hotel offers the option of having your breakfast delivered to your room for no extra charge. However, if you like a good sized breakfast - go downstairs for it. The portions of beans for example with the full irish, was no more than about three thimbles full..

All in all, wouldn't recommend it to anyone other than American Golfer/Businessmen.",2,2008,08,09
238,Lovely place.,"We stayed here last week for a wedding and were very impressed. Lovely staff, plenty of parking, nice big room & bathroom. Breakfast was fantastic. Would stay again for sure.",4,2008,07,30
238,might as well be in the States!,"My husband's conference was held here, so we did not choose the hotel.  Our first trip to Ireland from the U.S., we were hoping it would have more of a European flavor.  It IS a Marriott, and I would say it's quality matched that of the chain. 
Our one evening conference banquet was very good. Staff was friendly.  Dissapointed there really was no view of the golf course- you would never know it was there.  No ocean view- though you are a few miles away.  Nice interior, just very american.   Europeans might enjoy that?!  We did not use the spa facilities.
It is a close day trip to Glendalough, and Powerscourt Gardens- we recommend those to spice up this visit!!",3,2008,07,27
238,Were we unlucky..?,"Booked a 2 night stay for late May/early June for myself and my wife. We booked a suite priced at over €300 per night a couple of months in advance and were really looking forward to our stay. We made the booking on the hotel website and they guaranteed a non-smoking room. We arrived at check in and were given our room keys for our suite on the first floor (strangely the 1st floor is below the ground floor...its actually split level but I thought I'd mention it). We entered our room to the stench of stale cigarettes. Immediately went back to reception where I was told that there were no non-smoking rooms remaining and that there was nothing they could do. After insisting that something was done a manager magically found us a non-smoking suite. No apology was made. Despite a rocky start we expected to have an enjoyable stay. Unfortunately we found the hotel & room was just not up to the standards I would expect of a Marriott. There was an electrical socket with wires exposed hanging off the wall at floor level in the room. At breakfast we were delivered luke warm tea the first day and cold tea the second. We had to ask 3 times for toast on the first morning and waited over 20 minutes for it. When it arrived it was also cold. Cutlery and crockery was dirty and some staff appeared troubled when asked for anything. We went to the pool but before taking a dip my pregnant wife felt the temperature was very hot. She asked the attandant about this and he said that there was a faulty valve and that the temperature was higher than normal. It happens that the temperature was higher than that recommended for someone who is pregnant. Finally, I wrote to the manager after our stay to express our dissatisfaction. Over a month later and still no reply. We will advise anyone thinking of staying here to spend their hard earned cash somewhere else. This hotel left us very disappointed and we will ceratinly not be staying there again.",1,2008,07,08
238,nice break at druids glen,"Enjoyed a break at the marriott. All the staff were very friendly and polite. The hotel was clean, the room was nice, quite big. The leisure centre was lovely, very nice pool. The spa was also very nice, had a very relaxing massage while we were there. Only two complaints. Firstly, the dinner in the restaurant was terrible, not good enough at all for the prices they charge. Although, breakfast the next morning was excellent. Secondly, you could hear everything from the adjoining room, like every word!! not really what you would expect in a five star hotel.",4,2008,06,23
238,Loved the class,"I stayed here a couple of years ago with some family and I absolutely loved this hotel. The staff was so welcoming and the hotel grounds and rooms were beautiful. The hotel shuttle to and from the train station wasn't that reliable. However when the concierge knew the hotel shuttle wouldn't come and pick us up, he drove his personal car to the train station and picked us up. The beds in the hotel rooms are amazing! I have never slept so soundly in my life. Also, definitely take advantage of the breakfast buffet. It was be best breakfast at a hotel I've ever had. Definitely try an omlet. One of the cooks will make it right in front of you, and it is large enough for two. :)",5,2008,06,08
238,Liked Druid's Glen,"I stayed here for one night and the hotel is lovely. The grounds and facilities were so nice and I really enjoyed our stay here. The breakfast and lunch were very good quality. However, the dinner in druid's restaurant I found was a little substandard and I think Flynn's restaurant would have been a better choice for better quality food.",4,2008,06,03
238,Flawless!,"Hotel has a class of its own..... food /staff/ pool cant fault it - found the staff just fantastic - from reception to room service
Keep up the good work",5,2008,05,13
238,Amazing Marriot,"My wife and I booked this hotel for a night away  on Saturday night and we were not dissapointed.  The drive is a mere 50 mins from dublin airport and what a pleasant drive it was passing through the wonderful picturesque garden of Ireland.

Check in was fast and effecient and the receptionist was very very nice and gave us plenty of hotel info and a big welcome from the marriot.  The bedroom was beautiful with stunning views of the wicklow mountains.  The bedroom was way above average size and has a very comfortable bed with crisp and clean white cotton linen sheets, the decor was what you would expect from a five star hotel.  There was broadband access but quite pricey at a whoping €6 per hour however it was alot cheaper if booking it for 1 day/or a week.  Room included Tea and Coffee making facilities, Mini bar, Iron and Ironing board, hair dryer and a huge bathromm with luxury toiletries.

We dined in Druids brasserie and I had the Braised Lamb for my main and it was delecious my wife had the chicken but was accompanied by a white sauce and she is not a lover of white sauce so she was not as satisfied as i was with the meal.  I have to mention the creme brulee!! it was delecious.  Breakfast was taken in our bedroom and there was no additional charge to have it in our room.  The breakfast was delecious, we had two full irish with tea and juice and freshly made croissants.

There are excellent gym facillities and a lovely 18 meter pool with sauna, steam room and a great whirlpool available for free use as a guest, the spa gets some good reviews but unfortunaltley nor my wife or I got a chance to sample it.

This place seems to be a golfers paradise with two courses overlooking the mountains and Irish sea with plenty of other golfing things to do.

All in all i give this place a five star for hotel and accomodation and a 4 star for food.",5,2008,04,13
238,Great for a wedding,"My wife and I stayed at the hotel in February 2008 for a friend's wedding. Given that we were there for a wedding we probably did not see all that there was to do in the hotel but the parts we did see were fantastic. The rooms are large and the beds very comfortable. The bathrooms are huge with seperate showers and bath. The highlight for us was the breakfast the next day. The range of freshly cooked food was great along with the friendly service. Staff were cooking pancakes and omlettes to order and when we finished our breakfast, staff came around with cappuccinos. The grounds are lovely although it is a little disappointing that there are no decent walks around the grounds due to the golf course. Overall it is a lovely hotel and we would definitely consider returning for a weekend break.",4,2008,03,03
238,Pure Bliss,"Have visited the Marriott in Druids Glen twice already. The first time (Feb 2004) was for one night and it was too short!

It was a Saturday night and following a cocktail in the 13th we went for dinner in Flynn's - wonderful service. We had chosen a bottle of wine from the wine list but the sommilier recommended another similar one that wasn't onthe list - the wine was great...we were glad we'd gone with his suggestion.

The next year (Feb 2005) we went back and the place was mobbed.
Difficult to get a seat in the 13th for lunch, no availability in either restaurant (Druids or Flynns) and no towels at the pool.

We eventually got a table on the Saturday night in Druids for a late dinner (9.30pm) and the service was atrocious - there was only one waiter (or so it seemed) and bless him he did try his best to serve everyone...but I did feel like I was at Fawlty Towers!!

The next evening (Sunday) we ate in Flynn's - I love this restaurant.  The service is fantastic and my cocktail was made at my table...I felt so pampered!

On the Monday before leaving I had a beauty treatment. It was lovely but to be honest I've had better. The spa area is not as good as the one in Johnstown House (Marriott hotel as well).

Overall I like Druids Glen - the rooms are great, swimming pool is relaxing (when it's child free hour) and Flynn's steak restaurant is delectable. 

Heading back there this weekend so hopefully it will live up to my previous good experiences only!!

My advice - stay away from Druids restaurant if you can, eat in Flynns or a late lunch in the 13th and enjoy the pool when it's adults only.

For activities nearby there is a place that does quad biking, clay pigeon shooting and archery only 10 mins away (Hilltop). For me though - I'm happy to lounge around and enjoy the tranquillity of being away from it all.",4,2008,02,08
238,An excellent and relaxing break at the Druids Glen Marriott,"I stayed at the Druid's Glen Marriott Hotel with some of my family for a couple of nights on December 27th to 29th 2007.  This was my second short break at this hotel and again it was just excellent.  This hotel is to perfect place to go if you want to relax, unwind and get away from it all.  The hotel is spacious, spotlessly clean, very comfortable and the staff are very welcoming.  The standard rooms are very spacious, fresh and clean.  The leisure facilities are excellent and the breakfast is the best breakfast I have had in a hotel.  I will be returning to the Druid's Glen Marriott for more short breaks!",5,2008,01,10
238,Great Hoyel for Weddings,"Stayed here over Christmas for a wedding.  The hotel is very nice.  Very ""Irish"".  Check in was fast.  We had requested a smoking room with two doubles and that was exactly what we got.  It was on the ground floor and had a door out to a courtyard.  The beds and pillows are so comfortable - like sleeping on cloud!!  The AC was very effective.  There was no ashtray in the room so we called reception to get one and it was up in about 30 minutes.  There is a room with an ice machine on each floor but while we were there all three of them were out of order.

The bathroom was very spacious with a seperate bath and shower.  Toileteries were nice enough.  It was very clean apart from the sealant around the shower which was dirty and peeling.  One of my friends got a massage and was very happy with it.

We got room service three times incl breakfast.  The meal during the day was lovely but the sandwiches we got that night were the worst I have ever had in my entire life.  Stale bread, half an inch of margarine and hard, gone off cheese.  The breakfast the next morning was slightly better but still not good.  It was cold, the scrambled egg was hard, we got four slices of toast for three people, the orange juice was room temperature, the breakfast pastries were not fresh.  They seemed to be ones that come in frozen and are just allowed to defrost.  Very very disappointing.

The hotel is near nothing so bear that in mind.  The bar in the hotel is nice enough.  Cocktails were great! (apart from the mojito)

Check out was fast even though all the guests from the wedding were checking out at the same time.

I wouldn't really have a reason to come back here unless I was attending another wedding as but overall the experience was satisactory but they really need to work on the catering standards.",3,2008,01,05
238,Breakfast was the Highlight!!,"Stayed at the hotel for a long weekend 17-20th November 07.

All in all, would recommend, though the reviews on here seem pretty mixed.

Firstly, it must be said, the hotel is absolutely NOWHERE near ANYTHING. Now i had read this on other reviews, but didn't take it to heart as we were taking the car and i thought we'd be okay. However, after some difficulty finding the hotel,we were quite surprised at just how far away from EVERYTHING it is.  It's way more than an hours drive into Dublin, so no shops or resturants handy for all you golf widows.  Upon arrival we found we had forgotten a few essentials so we asked the conceirge where the nearest town/service station was to stock up- it was about 15 mins away in the car down windey lanes and up mountains and we got COMPLETELY LOST- even with the sat nav!

On the first night, we ate in the Flynns restaurant, where the food was good, but as you expect in most big hotels, very overpriced for what we got. Even the smallest, most common bottle of wine was 34reuro, which we really thought was a bit much.  We didn't want to eat there the second night, although the food was good, the choice wasn't great and we felt a little ripped off at the prices, but of course, with the hotel being so far away from everything else we had no choice!

I would recommend having a big lunch in 'the thirteenth'- the hotel bar which serves food til 5pm. There wasn't much of a choice (2-3 dishes) but the plates were fuller and it had a nice atmosphere and comfy couches.

The spa facilities were fantastic, better than i expected. Very clean and modern changing area, lots of lovely private showers, lockers, hairdryers, towelling robes,  2 steam rooms, large sauna, plunge pool and huge swimming pool. Very large gym too. I was very pleased with these facilities, and they weren't too busy when i was there either.

One thing i would definately highlight is the breakfast. It is served in the same room as flynns restaurant, which is a nice big area- i hate it when the breakfast room is stuffed in the basement- it really was the highlight of the day. Everything on hand here that you could possibly ever want for your breakfast; all kinds of eggs, pastries and cereals, more fresh fruit (including piles of strawberries and watermelon) than i have ever seen at breakfast time and the best bit is, it is served til 11am on weekdays and wait for it...12pm on weekends!!!  Worth getting up for.

Room was fine, pretty standard.  Our tv was quite outdated and there was no wifi internet connection ANYWHERE in the hotel, which we thought was a bit weird since the hotel looked pretty new. Nice big bathroom with shower and bath (although we couldn't get the shower to work). Very very quiet at nights- the block of rooms are far away from the main reception and conference facilities. Weddings were on whilst we were there, but we didn't hear a thing.
Surroundings looked beautiful, unfort the weekend we were there the weather was absolutely torrential rain and we didn't get round the grounds at all but i am sure there's plenty of romantic woodland walks there on a summers evening.

The
Staff were very tidy and polite. None of them Irish of course, but sure, who remembers when there were actually local people working in local hotels?

I would recommend the hotel and i might be persuaded to go again (if someone else would drive!!!).
I booked on superbreak.com and got a superb deal, (£45 p night) but if you are looking at deals and this hotel comes up against another one, i might just disregard this one because of the lack of facilities on site and nearby (ie just one restarant and bar to choose from and no shop or vending machines to stock up on essentials)

Definately would recommend for a VERY quiet weekend. 

Hope this is useful.",4,2007,11,20
238,Very nice place,"This hotel / golf complex is really stunning.

We were lucky with the weather and surrounding trees were covered in an autumn glow. Not an avid Golfer myself I resisted to partake in the Golfing instead opted to relax in the sumptous surroundings within.
Friendly staff, warm atmosphere, nice food. Nice rooms - with large bathrooms were more than adequate.
The Restraunt had really great views of the area.
 Dinner as we were absolutly famished - followed with excellent steak. 
Breakfast was served the following morning until 11am, with a full choice of staples.

Would consider here again !",4,2007,11,10
238,Very friendly and comfortable,"From the moment we arrived we felt a warm welcome which permeated the entire hotel staff.  Every member of staff saluted us each time we met and asked if we were enjoying ourselves and whether they could do anything for us.  The menu was comprehensive but on occasions did not suit one member of our party.  The immediate reaction always was: ok, just tell us what you want and we will do it.  We are already looking forward to our next visit there which will be as soon as possible.",5,2007,10,20
238,Gud Times..,"Only stayed the 1 night and didnt have food in the main restaurant.  
The Rooms are SUPERB.  Beds are super and Covered by about 12 pillows!  Very comfortable room also and big spacious bathroom (show and bath).  Didnt touch the Mini-bar but it seemed very well stocked but expensive. 

Went down with a Activities Ireland Day away with work and had an ok Buffet meal that night.  They didnt put out enough food for us and left half our party waiting for 10-15mins for main course when others where finished deserts..

With the Course its a very nice hotel.",4,2007,09,24
238,Little Gem,"I stayed here on a Golf weekend and i must say it was afantastic hotel on lovely grounds,

the view are breath taking the only one flaw i have is the restaruant, its lousy and only 1 star rating for service.

Improve ur service and u will have a little gem.
",4,2007,09,20
238,Relaxing break,"Stayed one night at the Marriott Druid's Glen. 
Check-in was prompt and friendly and our room was spotless. Once we realised we had a large choice of TV channels (including Sky Sports) we had difficulty getting out of the room!
Bed very large and comfortable.

I liked the spacious bathroom. Although the bath was quite small the seperate shower was great.

We had a cocktail or two outside and got chatting to a lovely staff member. I don't know if it was because the hotel was pretty quiet but she seemed to have plenty of time to talk to us and was very friendly. (Perhaps seeing a young-ish couple they might have seen £££ with a future wedding as the Druid's Glen wedding package was very visible with a sample reception table dressed just outside the lobby)

We had dinner in Flynn's Steakhouse. The food was outstanding but the service was slow and we had a 20 minute wait in between starter and main course. It wasn't cheap either and we both got tired of waiting so skipped dessert and coffee and headed to the Thirteenth Bar for after-dinner drinks.

Breakfast was good, I filled up on fruit and pancakes cooked there and then while himself enjoyed the hot food.

I treated myself to an Elemis facial in the spa. I've had plenty of treatments in various hotels and salons and it was up there with the best of them, but again, quite pricey in comparison to Dublin.

All in all a relaxing break, and only a hop, skip and jump from Dublin.
",4,2007,09,16
238,Five star i don't think so!,"Having been recommended this hotel by a number of people I found the hotel itself and its surroundings beautiful but the level of service and quality of food in Druids restaurant very disappointing.  There seemed to be only one waiter on in the restaurant and there was an unacceptable waiting period in between courses.  The food itself was mediocre at best, and when i tried to get somebody's attention to highliht this fact there was nobody to be seen!  All in all not worth the prices being charged here.  This establishment would benefit from more waiting staff to justify its five star claims and an improvement in the quality of food served.

",2,2007,09,12
238,"first time great, gets worst from there","The first time I visited this hotel a year or so ago I loved it! The food was spectacular and the restaurant beautiful. The rooms were beautifully decorated and well maintained and the staff were all really pleasant, so you can imagine how shocked I was when I arrived at the hotel one year later to find a badly run hotel with unpleasant staff! 
I was checked in without a problem, I went up to my room (no one offered to help with my luggage :( which wasn't good) My rom was acceptable but very different, it looked worn and as though it needed refurbishing (it was modern but in a bad condition) I decided to eat in the restaurant, the food was awful, but yet a year ago it had been world class, the waitresses were rude. At the end of my meal I was given my bill and I asked for a discout the waitress smiled and then just stood there. I couldn't be bothered to argue so I payed full price!
I just couldn't believe it, a nice hotel gone bad! 
I checked out early and went to the conrad Dublin, shame because I loved Druids Glen the first time and now tge good memories are replaced with bad ones.
",2,2007,08,30
238,Glad I'm not the only one!,"I'm intrigued to see how the ratings for this hotel have decreased over the past number of months. My partner and I stayed here and were bitterly disappointed. We arrived at 5pm and our room was not ready and yet we had to vacate the premises by Noon the following day. I don't understand how cleaning a room can take 5 hours! Our check-in was quite slow as a result and our room, despite being spacious with comfortable beds, smelled of cigarette smoke.
I had requested a table on-line for 7.30pm but upon arrival requested we move dinner to 8/8.15pm but could not be accommodated as Druid's was full. We didn't receive our starters until 8.20pm anyway and throughout our meal at least half a dozen tables remained empty. I found this astonishing. The food itself was not great with one of our side orders arriving after our main meal and the other didn't arrive at all. We were told by our giggly waitress that there was problems in the kitchen. Not a very sincere apology I think. We were also charged for the late side of greasy vegetables.
I agree wholeheartedly with previous reviewers about the food and service and I question this establishments 5 star status. I have written a formal complaint for the first time in my life to this organisation via their website and, over a week later, have yet to get a response? 
Friends of mine have been to weddings and other functions here at Christmas and in September last year and all found it to be great. This has probably added to my disappointment. Perhaps it has only dropped its standards over the past few months?
",2,2007,08,21
238,avoid  druids,"Beautiful hotel , great staff and service everywhere, except for the poor service druids restaurant - AVOID if possible, however as it is not possible to have a light meal in this hotel after 5 pm in the evening this restaurant is  only option unless you want a full formal meal in the the fabulous flynns , we were refused a table despite the restaurant being half empty and had to wait 90 mins to be seated, and then waited over an hour for an undercooked steak which I had to send back twice !  which took almost half an hour by the time I managed to catch the attention of  one of the few staff on duty - this is a typically overpriced hotel restaurant with unpredictable food standards and very poor service by poorly trained staff that seem to have difficulty in dealing with any number of guests - avoid at all costs,we talked to other guests in hotel who had similar experiences and felt  it really ruined their dining experience, compared to other dining option flynns - blissful food and service ! however unless you like to book all your meals in advance or eat in your room ,if you fancy something less than formal then choose somewhere more flexible to guests !!
",2,2007,08,16
238,Nice accomodation - poor restaurant service,"We stayed here for 2 nights. The hotel is in a lovely setting and great for golfers. The rooms are lovely and spacious and the bathroom very luxurious with sep shower and bath.  Everything is provided in your room - bath robes, ironing board and iron, tea, coffee etc. The hotel pool is good. Children are restricted from using the pool at certain times but this didn't cause us a problem as the times were reasonable.  All the staff are very friendly. We made a reservation for dinner at the Druid's restaurant on one night and were very disappointed with the service - we had to wait a long time in a line to be checked in and when the soup came it had to be sent back as it was cold - the wait between starters and main course was unacceptably long. Breakfast is buffet style and unfortunately we didn't think the service was very good either.  We had to ask for toast and when the toast came it was just warm white sliced bread - we then had to ask for butter as there was none on our table! The choice of breakfast food was good and the quality of the food was also good. It was a shame that the service was a bit slap dash. 5 star accomodation but very poor restaurant service.  I would recommend eating at the Mountkennedy Inn on Newtownmountkennedy Main Street - we ate there on our 2nd evening and enjoyed great food and service.
",2,2007,08,13
238,Food has gone downhill since last year?,"Have stayed here before and have really enjoyed the break away.  The rooms are lovely - really comfy beds particularly! One thing I am shocked about is the food.  We've eaten on a few occasions in the restaurant last year and each time fabulous food (service never as good).  However the food was awful on this visit.  Would also like to see some entertainment in the bar
",3,2007,08,01
238,Really Bad Food,"We stayed for three nights during July and ate in the Druids Restaurant each evening. The service was slow, the wrong food delivered and above all the meals were very poor. One night we ordered grilled salmon and when it arrived it was salted salmon. Even the chef said it was unedible and it was taken off the menu, but surely someone in the kitchen should have realised before it reached a guest.
 Be sure to get down for breakfast early because they do not refill all the juices, fruit or hot food after a while. Some mornings we received our coffee, some not.
During our stay we noticed other guests having problems with food. The hotel itself has admitted having 'issues in the kitchen'. Lets hope they sort it out soon. I would not stay here again, there were too many things wrong.

238,Great break,"Great hotel with wonderful staff and service, would recommend and will use again!

238,Druids Glen,"We stayed at the druids glen after the easter bank holiday.  I had with me my husband and 8 year old daughter.  Overall this hotel is exaclty what you would expect from a marriott, clean and spacious with very helpful staff.  The staff are great with kids and as u can imagine there were plenty, it being the easter school holidays.  Food was excellent, breakfast and dinner.  My only negative is the spa.... its not really a spa its a few treatment rooms. Having said that I had an aroma stone massage, which was excellent and sadly a very poor reflexology.  I am a reflexologist and i pointed it out to the manager of the spa that is wasn't up to standard and they were fine about not paying for the treatment. Which is fair.  I would stay here again but i wouldn't bother with the spa.
",4,2007,04,13
238,Third visit and really enjoyed it,"Just back from 2 night stay on Easter Sunday and Monday. Hotel is as good as on previous visits. Rooms are spacious - we had 12 year old with us so opted for 2 double beds rather than king. Plenty of room for all 3 of us. Loads of towels and ""Aromatherapy"" toiletries, slippers and robes.Plenty of wardrobe space, space for luggage and general floor space  (which isn't always the case in rooms with two doubles)
Turndown service brought nice chocolates and a little card bookmark with an Irish literary quote - different one for each day.
Breakfast great choices and good lean bacon (unlike the streaky stuff you get most places) nice sausages, eggs to order/omelettes/pancakes/waffles/extensive cold choices. Hotel has taken on my previous gripe about queues for toast last visit - now it is brought with tea and coffee service.
Had lovely light lunch on decked area - some cutting back of the trees now gives a nicer view of golf course. Also opted for room service one night and it is really well served and presented - proper table settings, linen clothes and napkins, flowers etc Good value too.
12 year old loved free chocolate cookies she was served in the bar while we had a bottle of wine. Also had a nice demo of chocolate making in lobby for Easter Sunday, with lots of samples, and little eggs on check in.
Pool area lovely - relaxed on loungers with the Sunday papers and supervised the wee one swimming. Also sampled hot tub. Showers and changing rooms well appointed and clean. Elemis soaps and lotion, plentiful towels, wet bags, etc so a trip to pool/gym was hassle free. Enjoyed gym - equipment good - loved treadmills - and never busy.
Tea and coffee in room unusual for Marriott but very welcome. Also nice option of tea/coffee and pastries in lobby each morning.
Great rate of 140E per room per night so really couldn't fault the hotel - this offered superb value for the 3 of us.
Staff very friendly and helpful - Thacia and Colin in the bar, the tall blonde lady who organised seating for breakfast, room service staff, and all reception staff all first class.

238,Not impressed....,"My partner and I stayed here in January 2007. We were looking for a quiet break away from the city. The room was nice and big, however some of the tiling in the bathroom was quite grotty and dated. We ate in the bar on the Friday afternoon. Our deal was for 2 B&B's and 1 evening dinner. We booked our dinner for the Saturday evening. However, we were limited in what we could do for dinner on Friday evening as the bar only serve food until 5pm...thus forcing you into the restuarant for dinner. Neither of us wanted a 'restaurant dinner' and because of the remoteness of the hotel limited our options we ate at 4.30pm in the bar. There was a wedding in the hotel that night and most of the guests seemed to be accommodated along our corridoor. The wedding crowd were very rowdy. At 2am after numerous complaints from other guests (I could hear the reception staff knocking on the room next to us) I couldn't take anymore and contacted reception. They duly sent security and the noise stopped. However at 4 am someone a few doors down decided to blast music through the corridoor. The next morning I asked to be moved and was told that the guests, in particular those staying in the next room to us, would not be staying the Saturday night. Staff gave a half-hearted apology regarding the noise. I found the breakfast and dinner good, but nothing exceptional. Again, the following night the remnants of the wedding decided to party in their rooms (Why this obsession with drinking in their rooms?!). And although it was not in the room beside us, it woke both of us, and again I contacted reception. The dealt with the problem...but there were a few more noisy incidents throughout the night which security attended to also. I was also disappointed with the lack of walking trails around the hotel...we were limited to a very short trail around the immediate vicinity of the hotel. I think the staff could have done alot more to control those making noise. So after 2 restless nights we returned to the city most disappointed with our weekend break away.

238,Great hotel,"This is a wonderful hotel. My husband and I stayed here for St. patricks weekend with our 16 month son and had a lovely relaxing break.

This hotel has that certain air of quality about it, the facilities are great, the staff were very friendly and helpful and the rooms were beautiful. It has everything you need for a relaxing break away. The food was excellent with a large selection on the buffet breakfast menu. There was plenty to suit our toddler and us!

The only blip of our stay was the late check in time of 4pm. We arrived at lunch expecting the normal 2pm check in time, the reception staff were lovely and we went for a drive until the called us as they put our room on priority for housekeeping. However the did not call us until 3:50pm which was a bit of a joke for being on priority. Check out time is 12 noon as we would expect. For a 5 star hotel I felt this a bit off putting.

Another minor point is regarding the spa, the leisure area and pool is great but the spa is really just a few treatment rooms, the therapists were brilliant though. I think for a spa break, there are a lot better spas around Ireland to chose from.

Overall I really liked this hotel and will return, I think it is an excellent 4 star but i'm not sure if it reaches as far as a 5 star for me.

238,Hole lot in one,"Myself and my wife decided to get a quick retreat from Dublin and go to the Druids for the weekend, it boasts two great golf courses, especially the under rated Druids Heath. 

The hotel itself aldo very busy for a five star has something about it, that makes you feel like a home from home. My only major complaint would be the dining options, Flynns is almost impossible to get a table, so you most likely will have to dine in the more casual eaterie. Apart from that I have to say everything else was excellent with particular praise to Lorcan Nevis, Raj (restaurant) Niamh (bar), young manager in bar, apologises no name and Fiona (front desk).

Will definetely be back!!!
",4,2007,03,05
238,Get away from it all in the Garden of Ireland,"This was our second trip to Druids Glen. The first time was a few years ago the day after a family wedding and we didn't really enjoy it as we were so tired. This time was really different and would gladly go back again soon. The hotel is part of a golf resort but if you're not a fan don't let that put you off as no part of the main hotel has a 19th hole feel to it. There is a loverly bar where we enjoyed some drinks while watching rugby. Room was very nice and breakfast next day was fabulous, excellent eggs or waffles of your choice as well as a very extensive buffet. Relaxing with the papers for an hour there was a real treat. Dinner the night before was the only minor letdown, we missed getting a table in Flynns steakhouse. The other restaurant doubles as the breakfast area and is nice but menu was uninspirig though food we chose was nice.",5,2007,02,28
238,Pretty good but not sure I'd rate it as a five star,"I stayed here with my mum for a spa weekend, basically a spa treatment each per day is included in the rate.  We stayed on a Saturday and Sunday night, it was very very quiet on the Sunday night, the hotel had very low occupancy given that it was January.

Positives for me were
a) very nice staff.  The guy who checked me in took the trouble of walking me upstairs to show me two different rooms so I could decide which one I wanted.  The staff also came across as genuine rather than following a formula ""have a nice day"" style which I've experienced before;
b) hotel rooms and general areas were nicely decorated and well maintained;
c) breakfasts were excellent;
d) we ate in flynn's steakhouse as well as druids restaurant.  I found both to be pretty tasty and enjoyed the food.  No issues with service at all;
e) very convenient location, close to Dublin.

Negatives
a) We had reserved for flynns steakhouse on the saturday night but seem to get forgotten about and ended up getting to sit down for dinner 45 minutes later.  We were well looked after once I had a bit of a moan, but the delay was a pain as it meant we ended up eating our meal quite late (8.30 booking, sat down at 9.15).  The hotel wasn't fully occupied by any means so would wonder what it might be like if it was very busy there;
b) Spa/pool area.  This was fine but it wasn't anything out of the ordinary.  The spa was really just a set of treatment rooms with a relaxation area.  It suffered by comparison to newer spa hotels I've been to;
c) Is it really a five star hotel? I couldn't say it was so outstanding that I went away thinking it was way ahead of any other 4 star I've stayed at in Ireland.  You are paying five star prices for drinks/food/room service etc which really adds up.  Not sure if its got the five star rating because of the golf courses but that element was of no interest to us...

All told we really enjoyed our weekend, but would go somewhere else next time for a spa weekend

238,Excellent Hotel,"Excellent Hotel! My wife and I have stayed at this hotel for the past four years and the hotel has been excellent each year. I will agree that the hotel is a distance from Dublin and one must have a car to enjoy how much the area has to offer. The Dart (light rail) leaves from Greystones (10 minute drive) and I would suggest that visitors from the United States take it into the city. The parking is free and only a short walk from the station and the fare is only a few Euros. The leisure center (pool, sauna steam rooms) is excellent and has certain hours for families and adult only hours. The only issues that we have had with the property is the restaurants. Over the past several years the service in the restaurants has not improved. I also agree with other reviews that the food is fair, at best. I would suggest that you dine at the Druids Steakhouse (More expensive and business casual) where the service, decor, and entrees are much better. One more word of caution, make sure to make dinner reservations, especially for Druids Steakhouse which has won local awards. Last year, there was a real problem getting reservations at any time. As a frequent Marriott guest and travelor,  restaurant reservations may not be needed at any other Marriott properties, but it is needed here! If you are from the States like I am, do this before your arrival. Golf courses are excellent, and somewhat empty during the slow season. The staff overall, is very good. We are returning Febuary 2007. I would definetaly recommend this Marriott.
",4,2007,02,09
238,VERY Child Friendly,"We stayed here over New Year with friends. In total we were a party of 6 adults and 7 children.

The hotel was extremely busy. 
We had a few problems on checking in - with rooms not being ready and also a reservation for New Years Eve dinner for one of our party had been mixed up. We eventually got this sorted and as everyone was in a party mood we didn't let it stop us from having a good time!

Rooms were spacious and comfortable, there are no surprises in this hotel you get what you expect from a Marriott hotel.I would agree with previous posts and rate this hotel as a 4 rather than 5 star.

The staff really were wonderful with all our children , this hotel is in no way stuffy in its attitude to families, for this reason we shall definately return.

The childrens menu was very good and reasonably priced . Food for adults was ok but not wonderful.

The leisure facilities ,a pool, jacuzzi, steam rooms and gym were excellent and the children really enjoyed the pool.

I was surprised at this time of year and considering the storms we experienced at new year that the fires were not lit around the hotel, this would have added to the atmosphere.

There is so much to do in the surrounding area we need to make another visit but transport is required to get anywhere!

I would not recommend this hotel to people looking for a quiet break without the sound of children in the background!.
",3,2007,01,30
238,not the best for the price..,"Did like the hotel a lot, however didn't find the staff that friendlyand felt that there are nicer hotels with the same if not better facilities for the price.. Stayed there in September, and enjoyed it but have been in a lot better hotels for less money.. It just didn't do it for me, and doesn't stand out in my mind...
",4,2006,10,30
238,Fantastic experience,"A truly outstanding hotel. The facilities and staff were of the highest quality. If you have the opportunity you must go.
We went on a golf break Druids Heath was good, Druids Glen was magnificent. 
We were looked after by the staff in a way that 5* hotels should look after their guests. 
I would highly recommend this hotel to everyone.
",5,2006,10,27
238,Great Spa Getaway,"This is a perfect Spa & Golf getaway. It is located near a wonderful small village. We went to breakfast in the nearby town and it was great........ as far as you can say a ""Full-Irish"" breakfast is great (2 sausage, 2 bacon, fried pudding, fried egg, french fries, baked beans)...... The Staff at the hotel was truly unbelevable! I don't remember having such wonderful service/ conversation when we stayed at the Ritz-Carlton (before sending us into town they called the owner of the breakfast cafe to be sure they were serving on Sunday).
",5,2006,10,15
238,Absolutely Fabulous Hotel,"We stayed in The Marriott for my husbands 30th Birthday and we had a great time.  The hotel itself is outstanding and if you are a golfer then you should really visit here - unfortunately we don't golf but would highly recommend this hotel for a romantic break or special occasion.

The bar is very old world with lovely slouchy armchairs and sofas to relax in.  Big glass window at rear and it was nice to look out at all the trees and flowers while sipping a cocktail.

I informed the hotel of my husbands 30th without him knowing and they really outdid themselves with their service, we got a complimentary glass of champagne and my husband was serenaded with a happy birthday song from all the staff in the restaurant. Great fun.

The rooms are spacious and comfortable - the beds are huge and the so are the bathrooms.  I would ask for either a room on the ground floor or 1st floor, if i was booking it again. The ones on the lower level are a fair distance to the Leisure Centre (which was my favourite place).

Believe the hype it's in a league of it's own!",5,2006,10,08
238,"Very comfortable hotel, some minor drawbacks for those with very young children","My wife, our baby daughter and I stayed a weekend at this hotel and very much enjoyed it. The hotel is very comfortable with big, well equipped rooms that were able to accommodate all the paraphenalia that accompany a new born infant. The staff from check-in to housekeeping to the restaurant were friendly and efficient.

The facilities and grounds are well maintained - there is a good pool and my wife had an excellent massage for a reasonable price.  The hotel is very golf oriented but I didn't play. There was a wedding on in the hotel on the Saturday night but unlike many Irish hotels it did not feel like it took over the place and that you were somehow gatecrashing it.

We got quite a good rate of €220 per night per room including an excellent buffet breakfast. The only gripe we had was with the dinner we had in the less formal of the two restaurants.  The food was good if not brilliant and was expensive for what it was. We had a much better meal in nearby Greystones town the following night for a lot less. The hotel restaurant was physically cold early on and we were seated beside a side door that repeatedly banged shut waking our child. 

A final quibble: the car park is quite far from the hotel foyer and the route is not pathed very well or thoughfully. There is valet parking but if you are transferring a child, a buggy, all their gear and your luggage it becomes quite a hassle. There were long queues for checkout on the Sunday morning this can be avoided as they have the facility to automatically check-out if you are happy with the bill they put under your room door on the last night.

All that aside I would recommend the Druids Glen for a weekend break. It is very easy to get to from Dublin, in lovely countryside with lots to do and see. Comfortable and relaxing.
These are relatively minor points but it is what makes the difference between a 5 and a 4 star review.
",4,2006,10,04
238,"Fantastic, BUT...................","Fabulous hotel with lovely rooms, restaurant etc... BUT be sure and bring your confirmation of booking as proof of price quoted.  On checking in the receptionist informed us that the price was incorrect and would be €150 extra.  Eventually  after some arguing and the reception guy insulting me and insisting nothing could be done  I contacted the manager who sorted the whole sorry mess out and blamed the website & central reservations which incidentally still gives the same price we were quoted.  
All in all a wonderful stay was had even if a sour taste was left on the first day.  
On a positive note how my complaint was dealt with was impressive and highlighted the high level of customer service.

238,a memorable stay!,"The ever-plesing Marriott!  What a lovely hotel in such beautiful surroundings!  Our suite was spacious and thoughtfully decorated.  Decadent bath products as well.  We received a fruit bowl and welcome card, nice little touches that will be fondly remembered.  The staff was superb and ever-accommodating.  We will certainly be back to this hotel again!
",5,2006,07,25
238,Great hotel,"We recently spent a week at the Marriott Druids Glen hotel and had a wonderful time. A rental car would be suggested as it's several Kilometers from the Dublin airport. The nearest Dart station is in Greystones. Marriott offers a shuttle service at scheduled times from the Greystones station so it would be feasable to take an airlink bus to the dart station. Then take the Dart train to Greystones and they either catch a taxi from Greystones or wait on the scheduled shuttle service. However, timing all of this would be problematic in my opinion. 

This is a wonderful golf resort and not a bad resort outside of the nasty Dublin traffic from which to base day trips around Ireland. In the time we were there we visited Dubling via the Dart train, Bray, Greystones, Wicklow, Glendalough, the Cliffs of Moher and Waterford. All as day trips but, we did spend a fair amount of time in the car. Not a bad thing if you're wanting to see the country side and don't have an issue with getting anyplace at a specific time. We'd make stops along the way at whatever looked interesting at the time.

The hotel has two restaurants which have rather limited menu's. Prices range from 19 Euro's to 33 Euro's for most main courses. Main courses are served as a complete meal and not ala carte. The food quality was very good compared to the few other places we ate in Ireland. Overall, food does not seem to be a high priorty in Ireland and can be quite expensive for what you get. There is also a very nice pub in which to grab a pint before or after dinner. 

Overall we had a great stay at this hotel and would not hesitate to go back again.
",5,2006,06,03
238,Fantastic,"Loved this hotel, Lobby, restaurant were fabulous, bedrooms huge and service very helpful. All in all great. Although I did attend a wedding and the function room had quite low ceilings and was very dark
",5,2006,04,27
238,Very Nice hotel,"This is a lovely property, the rooms are very well appointed and have everything you would need and expect from a 5* hotel.  Check-in was quick and the staff all very friendly.  We did have dinner while we were there in the Druids Restaurant and found it quite pricey.  The food was good but not necessarily worth the prices charged.  We were particularly annoyed when the waiter decided to argue with my friend regarding how her duck should be cooked, advising her that anything else other than well done was pure poison, and that was how she got it.  A car is definetly needed as this property is out of the way and not close to public transport.  Breakfast is also very high in price even for a 5* hotel.  We went to Avoca on our way home and had a brunch style meal there instead, much better value.  Overall all we had a lovely stay
",4,2006,03,20
238,excellent accommodation,"Decided to book 2 nights stay at this hotel after reading the very positive reports.  Hotel lived up to our expectations.  Staff were extremely friendly.  it was my husband's 50th B/D and they really made our his day.  They gave us free bottle of wine and a birthday card.  The food was very nice expecially the apple tart but the menu was quite limited especially that I cannot have diary and red meat but the chef did cater to my needs.  The room was spacious and tastefully furnished, bed and pillows very comfortable, overall the room was clean and pleasant.  The hotel is ideally situated especially if you want to get away from it all but only a 40 mins train ride from the neighbouring town-Greystone to Dublin.  The train fare cost 12 euros for return journey for me and my husband.  Staff was also very helpful and were very knowledgeable about the local area.  Gym, swimming pool, sauna etc was all very nice at the hotel. The bar was fine too and the drinks was reasonable priced. The guiness was lovely. I would definately stay at this hotel again.  Well done Marriott.
",5,2006,03,15
238,"Great Hotel Overall, Poor in some Aspects","I stayed for one night in Druids Glen in November 2005 with my boyfriend.

We chose this hotel as it is a short 20 minute drive from Dublin and yet it's location has a 'country' feel.

The room was fantastic, large double bed and good sized bathroom which was kitted out with every toiletry you could possibly need.

We didnt have a chance to try any of the spa treatments. Definitely book any treatments well ahead of time as they seem to be very busy and it is nearly impossible to get a slot at the last minute.

We really enjoyed using the pool and sauna area. Towels and toiletries are provided in the changing rooms. The pool was a good size (one small gripe was that it was quite shallow). The sauna and steam rooms are what you would expect in a 5 star hotel and we loved the invigorating plunge pool!

We were however very disappointed with one aspect of the hotel - the restaurant. We had made dinner reservations several weeks in advance (at the same time we had booked our room). Our room was called an hour and a half before our dinner reservation and we were told that they would not be able to serve us until 1 hour after our original booking. Not wanting to make a fuss we accepted this although we then didnt get any food until after 10 pm. 
My boyfriend enjoyed his dinner immensely. I ordered pasta in pesto sauce but received pasta in a thick mushroom sauce (which I have to say was awful). It was extremly difficult to explain the problem to the staff due to their extremely poor English. I didn't eat the meal and yet was still charged for it!

It was a real pity because apart from this the hotel was really wonderful.
",4,2006,02,02
238,Superb - almost top marks,"I was recommended by a colleague to try the Marriott.  Here's a tip - become a Marriott Rewards member on line and save even more on your stay.  The web site is not the easiest to navigate but stick with it and you will get a good deal (€86 per room per night incl. breakfast)

Room was superb - big comfy bed, excellent bathroom - TV could be updated to a flat screen.  Bed was Queen sized but cover was King size (why do people always mix these up?) so partner can leave one chilly.

Leisure facilities were very good and I parred index 1 on the Heath (6's on every other hole, though)

Breakfast selection was good and you could order anything you didn't see - I had pancakes one day and eggs benedict the next.

Restaurant menu was a bit limited but food was very good.  Bars were quiet but very comfortable.  Prices were average for Ireland so good news there.  General environment was very comfy.

Negatives:
Although staff were very attentive sometimes they were over attentive (each time I finished breakfast my plate was whisked away as soon as the knife & fork were set down - efficient but rushed) english speaking was also a problem for many of the staff although we had a delightful local server for dinner the last night who made up for everything.

I am usually very critical in my reviews but am happy to recommend the Marriott to anyone.
",5,2005,12,15
238,Just stayed there recently (not a five star hotel),"We just stayed there last weekend (12th Dec) for my wife's birthday.

We got a quite reasonable deal for a Sunday and Monday night stay. 175Euro each night for a suite and included breakfast.

I had also read the rather good reviews here on Trip Advisor which swayed our decision to stay here.

The arrival at the hotel which is located in beautiful Wicklow countryside was pretty ok. They have a lot of private residental homes on the hotel grounds and it very much is a golfing location.
The check-in went pretty smoothly as reserved. Staff were friendly but their english needs to be better. Walking to our room the cleaning staff seemed to be everywhere in the corridor.

We got to our suite and it appeared to be ok, the seperate lounge area was pretty basic and the couch/seating was not so impressive. There was a gas fire in the room also. There is a small restroom of this room.

The bedroom was spacious, and it was plenty bright. The bed itself (King size) was only so so, it could move freely on it's wheels by gently brushing up against it. There were no spare pillows or blankets on the room.

The bathroom was pretty impressive, it contained two sinks/toilet/seperate shower and a bath. I cannot fault this room. A Heated floor would have been nice though.

We got breakfast delivered as room service both mornings at no extra charge, it was slightly late on the 1st morning. The breakfast itself while generous in size was not of the best quality. It was pretty cold and the actual quality of the food itself was average. I would honestly get the same breakfast at a local Bed and Breakfast. I expected better.

We ate at the Flynn's steakhouse on our final night there, we had a wonderful waitress that offered the perfect level of service. The food was excellent and the prices were not as high as I thought they would be (in keeping with current ireland prices).

The Bar area itself has a pleasent sit down area which offers a view of the golf course. I found the barstaff to to offer rather slow service.Prices were normal. Tables were not cleaned even though the place was very quite.
 
One item that did annoy us was that our room was not properly cleaned. The cleaner did not clean off the table that we ate breakfast on and one of the other tables in the room. Also the dirty used glasses and a pitcher of water was not removed either. A bowl of fruit was also not removed or refreshed.
Also our robes were not replaced, and we were one short.

Overall this is a rather nice hotel, which is perfect for a golfing weekend. However it is more of a four star facility, and the level of service needs to be improved. The poor cleaning of our room was unacceptable.
",3,2005,12,14
238,fabulous,"This hotel is absolutely fantastic.  It is so beautiful.  The restaurant has a great breakfast buffet.  Also the steakhouse is fantastic.  It was the best meal I had in Ireland.  I had Portuguese steak and the caesar salad.  There is a lounge/bar that is really romantic with skylights and a fireplace.  The bathrooms in the room are huge and marble.  Service was friendly.  Nearby are the Powescourt gardens, Avoca weavers, and Glendalough.  We stayed for 2 perfect nights.  Oh, and the nearby town of Greystones is very cute  to walk around in.

It was well stocked with every toiletry and convenience you could think and more. Lovely dressing gowns and slippers.  Iron & ironing board, both of which were of a high standard.  I

238,Calm and Peaceful Counrtyside,"Our family stayed at this hotel over Sept 2 & 3rd. You must rent an automobile to stay at this hotel. It is about an hour drive south of the airport. Make sure you get very good directions before you attempt the drive. Also, have 1.80 euros in coin for the toll road.

The hotel has a quiet country setting next to a stunning golf course.  It is
about a 5 minute drive to the closest small village (Wicklow). The hotel
is the hub for wedding, social, and business meetings in the area.
Therefore, make sure your room location is not near the lobby steps.

We ate at the hotel's food service offerings.  The food and service were
good but, very expensive.

Ask the staff for driving directions to the Copper Kettle for breakfast.
You need reservations for The Hungry Monk for dinner.  Food quality and prices were great. After dinner at ""The MonK"",    we drove about 1 mile
to a traditional pub named W.H. Dunn & Son were the Guiness and song were very inviting.....

The Dublin Area Rapid Transit (DART) station is located about a 10 minute drive from the hotel in Greystone. It is a great way to get into Dublin.
It operates Monday to Friday.

238,"Great Hotel, Staff and spa","Stayed at the hotel for four days after 4 in London. This hotel is a bit off the beaten path and you will need a car. The staff was excellent and much better than the hotels in London. Staff was knowledgable and friendly. They gym and spa are top notch with steam, sauna, hot whirlpool and cold whirlpool. (Brrrrr but great!!) Hotel has quite a few weddings so you may have a late crowd in the hall but not unruly. Best nearby restaraunt is the Hungry Monk in Greystone. We had dinner at Belles which is also in Greystone but this was just OK. We played golf and I informed the staff that my wife was a beginner and they did not put anyone off after us. The course is really beautiful. Breakfast buffet is extensive but expensive. Better off to drive to the Copper Kettle a few Km away for a great inexpensive breakfast. Overall a beautiful hotel with great staff and I would gladly return.

238,Isolated but pretty,"Lovely hotel, beautiful golf course (played Druids Glen) but very isolated. You must have a car and be willing to drive without good maps or signs (at least not what we are used to in the US). Nothing within walking range-several miles to a very small town with a couple of very small eating establishments with limited hours of operation and nothing particular to see. There is a shuttle bus (or taxi available) several times a day into Greystone - a small, quaint town that does have a train station and some interesting shops and restaurants as well as a lovely rocky coast.

238,Very Impressed,"I recently stayerd in the Marriott Hotel in Druids Glen in Wicklow, nested amid two world class golf courses and with the sea visible in the distance the Hotel could not be in a more picturesque setting. The hotel is 5 star and you know it the minute you arrive. The marble floored interiors, sumptious decor and well presented and smiling staff soon put you at ease. The rooms are spacious, spotlessly clean and of a high standard complete with mini bar and bath robes for that lounging about time. The bathroom is large with a walk in shower, bath and a nice selection of complimentary toiletries provided. The main bar is spacious with a view over the famous 12th green ( I think, as im not a golfer). There is a nice selection of food available, I had a club sandwich with fries was around 11 euro. Drinks were 4.30 for a pint and not overpriced at all. The dining room is bright and the breakfast is a large buffet selection, I had bagles with Italian salamis and cheese, there were too many choices to list. Food was good for lunch, I had a fennel soup, salmon and gorgeous banoffi pie for dessert. Dinner was set for our trip, I had beef that was delicious all washed down with a nice full bodied chilean house wine. THe Hotel has a Spa facility which I did not avail of but from the list of treatments available it seems good. I used the Gym and the Swimming pool (shallow 1.2 metre) also the jacuzzi in a very relaxed environment. Very clean and well kept facilities.

My one complaint is that as you walk around the splendid surroundings there are signs advising you not to enter the golf course. There are pathways visible through lush vegetation that look so enticing but I suppose its primarily a golf resort. Those golfers I saw all had a fixed smile as if they had reached some sort of golfing nirvana.

The staff make the place and Marroitt should be proud of their attention to detail and very professional and friendly staff.

Best hotel I have been in for years.

238,Excellent Service,"My wife and I spent 4 nights here using it as a base to explore the area (and I to play golf!). This was our 4th trip to Ireland, my 6th, in the last 8 years and while we normally do not stay in ""large"" hotels on our trips, preferring more intimate inns, we used some of my many Marriott points to stay at the Druids. We secured a large suite that was very comfortable (great king bed!!) with a working gas fireplace and very spacious living room area.
Our experience was that the staff were fantastic. My wife and I commented on many occasions that they were amongst the most service-minded and friendly staff that we have ever encountered on any of our many,many global trips.
The bar staff in the Thirteenth were excellent, especially Steve the head barman who introduced us to the lovel Redbreast 12 year old Irish whiskey!!
Our dining experiences with breakfast and 2 dinners there were great - ample and tasty breakfasts and dinner service and quality of food was very good.
Druids Glen golf course, referred to as the ""Augusta of Europe"" is very impressive and a must play in the area, as is the European Club down in Britas Bay 40 minutes away.
Our experience at this hotel was excellent and we would highly recommend.

238,Average,"We stayed in the Druids Glen this Easter for two nights. We had been looking forward to the stay very much. In summary, we found the whole experience a bit disappointing. On check-in, the receptionist was not forth coming with information on the hotel’s facilities. We had to prompt her to continue with divulging some helpful information. In the end, we relied on the Guest Directory in the bedroom for a summary of the hotel’s facilities. The food was very average in Flynn’s restaurant, though the prices were not. Our bedroom was beside the elevators and stairs. We requested an alternative bedroom but were informed that there were no non-smoking rooms available. So for both mornings of our stay we were woken up at 6.30am to trolleys bringing room service and children playing on the stairs.

On the plus side, the spa and golf facilities were very good. The overall service was good too, except for our check-in experience.

238,Wonderful Retreat,"This was the best find of our whole trip to Ireland.  Being only a half hours drive to Dublin, but out in the coutryside, and by the sea was wonderful.  This hotel was quite a find.  The grounds are beautiful, being surrounded by the golf courses.  The room was great, nice bedding, big tub and spacious.  I thought the restaurants had a taste of anything you may be craving.  Or the closest towns were a few minutes drive.  Be sure to take advantage of the spa, but book ahead.  This hotel is a popular place and I was unable to get the spa treatment I wanted due to it being so booked up.  Perfect for either a family, couple or a golf group.  I plan on returning!
",4,2005,03,31
238,Excellent-will be back,"From the time we arrived -Lunch time Friday(25th March)the staff could not have been nicer.From the reception lady to the conceirge to the bar man all really happy and friendly.
The rooms were large,spacious with lovely big bed and great bathroom.
We had lunch in the THIRTEENTH bar with was great-toasted sandwiches,wedges,teas and coffees-all excellent.
We used the leisure centre,pool,jazuzzi,steam room,sauna-really well maintained and we were given a timetable to inform us of the busy time for kids with I thought was a great idea.
Dinner was delicious-2restaurants to choose from-Druids is more relaxed,pizza,burgers,etc suitable if you have children.We dined in Flynn's steakhouse-but we all had fish-all really good.Wine list excellent,staff friendly and helpful.
Golf on Druids Heath the next day was wonderful ,scenery breathtaking,again staff so nice.
Spa treatmnents were amazing-Full body massage really hit the spot-Sam my therapist was so nice and interesting to chat to.The place is relaxing and the correct temperture-couch beds lovely and big.Also had a pedicure and was given the polish to take home with me.Well impressed.
We all raved about this hotel and we will most definetely be returning.Well done to all involved.
",5,2005,03,28
238,Not the most impressive 5 star,"Booked into the Marriot with my family to celebrate my mothers birthday. In all there was about 14 of us staying in the hotel. The hotel rooms were lovely, nice decor etc. But nothing exceptional for a 5 star. The facilties and common ares where however impressive as were the views from the bar terrace. The main dissappoinment was the restaurant. The service here was diabolical. We went for the more expensive Flynn's restaurant. We waited at least an hour before getting our meal. Even at this we weren't all server at the same time. We also ordered a bottle of red and white wine. But were told the cellar was locked and that the waitress would have to find a manger to open it. Did they not expept any of the diners to order wine. The wine arrived about 1/2 hour later. Not too bad I guess except when we ordered another bottle we were told the same story.
",3,2005,02,24
238,Magic,"The Druids Glen Hotel is magical.  The rooms are exceptionally appointed and comfortable.  The public areas of the hotel are beautiful.  The staff are very accomodating and helpful, especially Denis O'Conner the concierge.  This part of Ireland is incredibly beautiful, with the mountains and the sea all within view.  I never tire of visiting.  The leisure center at the hotel is wonderfully situated and you can imagine swimming or running into the sunset.  I can not wait for my next visit to the Druids Glen
",5,2004,10,16
238,"Good overall, but needs to work on Restaurants","We have just spent a long weekend at the Druids Glen. We are Marriott devotees as we are Marriott Vacation Club owners and love to collect our points! As such we have stayed in around 10-12 different hotels around the world in the last 18 months and as such can be objective. The hotel is indeed very well appointed and finished to a very high standard. The public areas were clean and always well presented as was the room. We stayed in a suite for 3 nights. It was large, comfortable and had gorgeous views over the Irish countryside. It was nice to receive chocolates on arrival and a handwritten note welcoming us to the hotel. The weekend was very, very busy with lots of families. It appears the hotel was full with a capacity in exces of 350 people, but only dining capacity for 150! We really suffered with this, our first experience in the ""posher"" Flynns restaurant, was pretty dire. We waited for an hour and three quarters between being seated and receiving our main course. My partner's was incorrect, and mine was left under the lights whilst they re-cooked his! The desert was not good - bought in cheesecake, claggy and not very nice at all. However, the maitre d couldn't do enough to help, after we made our feelings known. Breakfast was a nightmare! On two of the three mornings, they had run out of so many things. Granted the hotel was full, but I don't expect to have to wait for toast, cheese, orange juice, pastries, butter, ketchup aswell as coffee! We chose the option of having breakfast in our room on day three which was a significantly improved experience - no hoards, and everything we asked for! On day 2 we ordered an afternoon tea - at 40 euros (£25! sterling) we expected more than stale sandwiches, wedges of dry ginger cake and no clotted cream! Agaiun we complained and the bar manager accepted that it was substandard. Again we went back to the room and ordered sandwiches room service which were excellent. One other point was that they located the hairdryer in the wardrobe which meant that I had to sit on the floor inside the wardrobe to dry my hair - very strange! All in all we will give this hotel another go, at a quieter time of the year - maybe Autumn. Saying that Marriott have now acquired the Shelbourne in the centre of Dublin which is a beautiful hotel. My final comment would be that  the staff were incredibly friendly, and outstanding in trying to resolve our issues. They are a credit to Marriott.

238,luxury,"Absolutely superb, from the friendliness of staff to the beautifullly decorated rooms which are so spacious even by 5 star standards.      the food was a delight and the breakfast was one of the best I have had -the buffet selection was endless and again the staff deserve credit -nothing is too much trouble.The spa is excellent and Druids Heath golf course is just great , a real  test and long enough even off the recreational tees.
",5,2004,08,29
238,marvellous,"fabulous, suite and interconnecting room fantastic and we stay in a lot of hotels. All the staff faultless,
We will be back as regular R.O.I. visitors the best hotel we have stayed at for years, 4 night stay went too fast.

238,A real treat!,I recently stayed in the Druid's Glen hotel with my husband and 2 year old son. It lives up to its 5 star rating. From the moment we walked into the hotel we were greeted very warmly by the staff...the room was large and comfortable with all mod cons expected. Luxurious decor and impeccable public areas. I was especially impressed with the staff who were extremely friendly and efficient especially in the restaurants and spa/leisure centre. The leisure centre is beautifully laid out. I would fully recommend a stay at Druid's Glen...well worth a visit.,5,2003,12,09
238,really relaxing,"I have stayed here twice recently and it is the ideal place for a really relaxing holiday, the hotel is set in beautiful countryside, the leisure centre has the most amazing view. Rooms are quite large with a lovely bathroom, food in both the Restaurant and in the bar is lovely and it is the ideal place to park you car on a friday lunchtime and collect it on Sunday when you are leaving and chill cant recommend highly enough",5,2003,08,12
238,*** star hotel in a beautiful location,"Stayed here for 2 nights. The hotel has seen better times (okay indoors, but outside it's already leafing at one point or another).
The room was very spacious, clean and fully equipped.
What we didn't like was the staff. There seem to be very frequent changes. When we checked in we booked a table for Hugos the next night - when we came, the restaurant was closed - and we had to eat in the bar (with the European Championship game running...). The service both in the bar and breakfast room was far from 5 star level. At breakfast, orders were forgotten, incorrectly delivered (e.g. coffee instead of tea). I suspect that a lot of new, only briefly trained personnel work here who are not familiar with the menus, procedures, etc.
The breakfast buffet was okay, but not on the level of the other hotels we had on this trip (all 4 and 5*). In my opinion the 5 stars are undeserved, for me a 3+ hotel.",3,2024,06,28
238,Not 5 stars…,"The spa area is more or less a public indoor pool that does not meet 5-star standards; wearing a swimming cap was the highlight of the visit. 
We had to make a reservation for the Hugo restaurant at a late hour, but it was hardly full. The food was very good. 
In the bar/restaurant you can mostly only eat at low tables/upholstered furniture. I don't understand that, since the majority of guests stay in the hotel to eat. 
The food is very good there too. 
The staff are all very friendly.",3,2023,08,17

238,Ja nicht in den Schulferien buchen,"Hotel, Zimmer und Umgebung sehr schön. Frühstück im Zimmer schlecht und chaotisch. Aber war leider nötig, da das Hotel mit Kinderwagen und Kleinkindern überfüllt war. Der Lärmpegel war sehr hoch. Daher haben wir das Rest. gemieden und mussten auswärts Essen gehen. Schade. Das Hotel kommt sehr gut daher, das Zimmer schön und gross. Etwas ringhörig. Wir haben selber 7 Kinder aufgezogen. Aber soviele Kleinkinder in so einem Golfhotel passt nicht zusammen. Sorry.

Hier wimmelt es von Babys und Kleinkinder.

238,Schönes Golfhotel im neuen Glanz,"Nach einer Sanierung bzw. Erweiterung des Restaurant- und Barbereichs erstrahlt das Hotel wieder im neuen Glanz.
Seit vielen Jahren verbringen wir stets einige Tage in Irland. Tolle Golfplätze und vor allem die herzliche Art der Menschen lassen uns immer wieder nach Irland zurückkehren. Zuletzt vor zwei Jahren fanden wir, dass das Hotel seine besten Zeiten hinter sich hatte, da der Frühstücks- und Barbereich doch sehr in die Jahre gekommen war. Dennoch entschieden wir uns, im April nochmals für einige Tage ins Druids Glen Resort zu fahren. Wir wurden sehr positiv überrascht. Der Barbereich wurde um einen Glasanbau erweitert und sowohl Bar- als auch Frühstücksbereich erhielten neue Möbel und sehen gemütlich und heimelig aus.
Das Frühstück sowie die Speisen in de Bar und im Restaurant waren ausgezeichnet und auch das Preis-/Leistungsverhältnis war für irische Verhältnisse sehr gut.

Der Golfplatz Druids Glen war im April bereits in hervorragendem Zustand und, was im Gegenzug zu manchen deutschen Golfplätzen äußerst positiv ist, auch bei einer Startzeit um 8.00 wird man nicht durch Platzarbeiter dauernd belästigt.

Fazit: das Hotel und der Golfplatz sind hervorragend und machen uns Lust auf eine Wiederholung.",5,2018,05,02
238,Traumhafter Ort,"Ich war am Wochenende in diesem Hotel zu Gast. In dieser ländlichen Gegend war es ruhig und angenehm zu übernachten.

Unbedingt beim nächsten Besuch vorbeigehen und genießen...

238,Mi aspettavo di più,"Hotel molto frequentato da golfisti, famigli, turisti in transito. Stanze ampie, bel design anche se un po' impersonale e poco caratteristico, colazione di qualità benchè non troppo abbondante. Bellissimi il bar con affaccio sul bosco e sul campo da golf, la piscina con vetrata, il contesto ambientale in cui è inserito il complesso. Alcuni dettagli sono manchevoli: ad esempio la pulizia delle camere, buona in linea generale, ma non è possibile che vi siano ragnatele negli angoli e sul soffitto. Gentilissimo e preparato il personale alla reception. In definitiva, da migliorare la spa, la pulizia delle stanze e la varietà del cibo a colazione. Vista la caratura del luogo, mi sarei aspettato qualcosa in più.",3,2017,09,16
238,Die Erwartungen nicht erfüllt,"Herrausragend freundliches Personal, besonders an der Rezeption! Ich hatte ein gesundheitliches Problem, sofort war die Rezeptionistin ( leider weiß ich den Namen nicht ) bereit, mir einen Arzttermin zu machen und hat sogar für den nächsten Tag den Hotel - Shuttle organisiert. 
Vom Menü beim Abendessen im Restaurant, das angeblich so hervorragend ist, waren wir sehr enttäuscht. Das Frühstücksbuffet war sehr gut, wenn auch hektisch, da es sehr viele Leute mit kleinen Kindern gab. Aber auch hier und in der Bar, sehr freundliches Personal.
Unser Zimmer war zum Innenhof, was leider den Nachteil hatte, dass man ständig ein lautes Geräusch des riesigen Klima- bzw. Entlüftungsgerätes gehört hat und man kein Fenster öffnen konnte. Die Massage im Spa war OK, aber nichts besonderes.
Der Golfplatz Druids Glenn ist eine Reise wert, den zweiten Platz muss man nicht spielen.",4,2017,08,27

Los salones muy acogedores con chimenea que dan aire hogareño. A quien le guste el golf es una pasada y también tiene un spa chulisimo - eso sí, hay que reservar el spa con antelación porque si no no hay huecos para nada. Muy muy recomendable para unos días tranquilos de paseos, deporte y spa.",4,2016,12,01
238,El mejor hotel de la zona. Nunca decepciona,"Me hospedo regularmente en este hotel desde hace mas de diez años, y puedo decir que no encontraran en la zona un hotel que reúna tantas comodidades.

Buen desayuno y muy amplio. Si bien el restaurante es bastante aceptable, la carta del bar no me convenció mucho. La mayoría de los platos no encajan en un bar. Tal vez algo tan sencillo como un sandwich mixto. Eso si, los camareros son muy eficientes y muy agradables",5,2016,11,03

Eine große und sehr schöne Bar mit einer tollen Aussicht auf den Golfplatz.
Zum Hotel gehören zwei Golfplätze, die man unbedingt spielen sollte. Druids Heath, eine Mischung aus Park- und Linkskurs, sehr interessant.

238,Super Hotel nicht nur zum Golfspielen!,"Wir waren mit einer Gruppen von Golfspielern zum ersten mal in diesem Hotel resp. Resort. Der Empfang war sehr freundlich und professional. Alle Hotelangestellten waren sehr freundlich und jedesmal wurde ""How are you?"" gefragt. Das Frühstücksbuffet war mehr als ausreichend und von guter Qualität und sehr schmackhaft. Die Hotelzimmer waren tadellos und sauber, da gibt es nichts auszusetzen.
Einziger kleiner Verbesserungspunkt wäre an der Reception wenn das Personal neben English noch eine weitere Fremdsprache beherrschen würde, was bei einem 5-Stern Hotel üblich ist.
Trotz allem kann ich dieses Hotel ohne Vorbehalte weiterempfehlen.",5,2015,10,18
238,Golf-Hotel das alle meine Ansprüche erfüllt hat,"Das Druids Glen Resort Golf Hotel ist ein schönes Hotel mit allem was man braucht. Wir waren nur für eine Nacht in dem Hotel aber alles war sehr gut. Vom check-in, bis zur Bar am Abend wie auch das Frühstück und der check-out.
Viel Spaß im Hotel und auf der Runde Golf...",5,2015,07,15
238,Golf,"Wir waren nun zum zweiten Mal hier. Das Hotel erlebt Licht und Schatten. Das Frühstückbuffet welches letztes Jahr mangelhaft war hat sich stark verbessert und es wird teilweise versucht, die Kleinkinder welche in grosser Zahl vorhanden sind von den restlichen Gästen zu separieren. Das ist sehr gut und schont das Gehör massiv. Leider muss angemerkt werden, dass z.B. der Sauberkeitszustand im 13 Restaurant massiv zu wünschen übrig lässt (massenhaft tote Fliegen, auch die nachfolgende Generation ist bereits verstorben und liegt rum...)
und das Mobiliar ist schmutzig und massiv beschädigt!
Der gebuchte Balkon stellt sich als 45cm tief heraus und ist nicht zu gebrauchen.
Den grössten Mangel erlebt man aber auf dem Golfclub. Druids Glen und Heat gehören zum Hotel. Heat entspricht nicht einmal  dem Standard eines Dorfclubs und ist dem Hotelstandard nicht angepasst. Unterhalt nicht vorhanden somit zum vergessen! Und was wir im Druids Glen erlebt haben passt auf keine Kuhhaut. Der Greenfeespieler als Hotelgast steht hinten an. Wir erlebten ein ""Members"" Turnier (Dienstags oder Mittwochbecher der Senioren oder so) das soweit ausartete, dass diese Herren gemütlich eine Verpflegungspause nach sechs Löchern einlegten und danach wieder vor uns reingelassen wurden. 2 er Runde mit Buggy gegen 5!!! Stunden Dauer! Für Hotelgäste eine Verarschung! Wir kommen nicht mehr, es gibt Hotels die mehr Rücksicht nehmen.",3,2015,06,24

238,5 stelle tutte accese,"Dovendo ritornare a Dublino alla fine del nostro tour itinerante, ci siamo concessi un piccolo regalo soggiornando in questo elegante resort a circa un'ora di distanza dall'aeroporto. Il complesso si trova vicino al sito monastico di Glendalough , alla Powerscourt house and gardens, e alle montagne di Wicklow. In stanza abbiamo trovato un intelligente depliant con 10 cose da visitare con la macchina e senza la macchina, e il posto e' talmente incantevole che verrebbe voglia -in caso di bel tempo- di fermarsi a lungo. Probabilmente gli amanti del golf, che qui trovano ben due campi a disposizione, conosceranno bene le potenzialita' del complesso. La struttura e' molto grande ed ha un'elegantissima zona relax vicino alla reception (ben due camini accesi nonostante la bella giornata), un bel bar-brasserie in cui mangiare qualcosa di sfizioso in un pavillion meraviglioso, un ristorante elegante e una grandissima sala colazione dove al mattino si puo' trovare ogni cosa possibile, con tanto di cuoco a preparare omelettes su richiesta. Lo staff e' composto da persone giovani ma molto efficienti e desiderose di rendersi utili, particolarmente in sala breakfast. La piscina,la jacuzzi, le tre saune e relativa zona fitness sono di ottimo livello e ad uso gratuito da parte dei clienti. C'e' un bel percorso per chi ama lo jogging che porta a contatto con i campi da golf. L'unica cosa che non ho amato molto e' il materesso, che a mio avviso tendeva ad affossarsi sotto il peso, e l'insonorizzazione delle stanze potrebbe essere migliorata: se qualcuno parlava in corridoio si sentiva ogni cosa. Sono comunque peccati veniali, è un posto davvero molto bello e mi spiace non essermi  fermato piu' a lungo",5,2014,09,09
238,Cinque stelle non per caso!,"Ho soggiornato in questo hotel per due notti in occasione del matrimonio di amici che si e' celebrato proprio qui.
La stanza era enorme e dotata ovviamente di tutti i comforts, dalle bottigliette d'acqua gratis ogni giorno, alle ciabattine ecc ecc. Il bagno era dotato sia di vasca che di doccia.
Non dovete assolutamente perdervi la colazione, davvero indimenticabile. C'era davvero di tutto, dal dolce al salato e posso dire che in questo hotel ho assaggiato la migliore Irish breakfast della mia vita.",5,2014,08,31
238,Ottimo hotel per convention aziendali,"Ho soggiornato per 3 notti (e 3 giorni) al Druids Glen insieme ad alcuni miei colleghi europei per la convention trimestrale della nostra azienda. Non consiglierei mai di alloggiare qui come punto di partenza per visitare Dublino, in quanto l'Hotel si trova ad un'oretta di distanza. Se però volete passare dei momenti romantici con il Vostro partner o organizzare una convention aziendale (magari con partita di golf annessa), può fare sicuramente al caso Vostro. Abbiamo avuto le camere Superior che sono notevoli sia per dimensioni sia per cura: la colazione è nella norma (i cibi caldi si richiedono ai camerieri che li portano poi al tavolo) e al bar/ristorante si mangia bene,",4,2013,11,15
238,Angenehmes Hotel,"Wir haben im Druids Glen Resort gewohnt da wir zum Golfen in Irland waren.
Das Hotel ist wirklich sehr gemütlich, mit den folgenden Abstrichen: das Schwimmbad hat mehr den Charakter eines öffentlichen Hallenbades. Die Zimmer sind ein wenig spärlich eingerichtet, es kommt keine Atmosphäre auf, man mag sich bei einem regnerischem Tag nicht wirlich dort aufhalten auch wenn die Zimmer groß sind. Dafür ist die Hotellobby groß und urgemüglich (u.a. versetzte Ebenen) mit Kamin und Kuschelsofas und Kuschelsitzen. Die Bar ist Klasse, das Restaurant wirklich gut und es wird auch darauf geachtet das die Gäste ensprchend ihrer Reiseart platziert werden (Paare nicht unbedingt mitten zwischen Familien). 

Das Hotel wird offensichtlich gerne für Hochzeiten bebucht denn es gibt einen separaten Saal für die Feierlichkeiten. Außerdem wohnen dort gerne Familien.

Das Personal ist sehr nett und freundlich und hilfsbereit. Die Zimmer sind sauber und die Betten sehr gemütlich. Das TV-Angebot auf den Zimmern ist nicht ausreichend.

Für Golfer gibt es zwei ausgesprochen schöne Golfplätze zum Hotel gehörend. Golfer: unbedingt spielen!!!",4,2012,12,16

Das Personal war einfach ein Traum, immer ein nettes Wort und tolle Anregungen die Umgebung zu bereisen. Das Frühstück war super, besonders die Aussicht in die Natur. Unser Zimmer war sehr großzügig und vor Allem sauber. Der Aufenthalt war super und wir werden auf jeden Fall wiederkommen.",5,2012,04,16
238,Schönes Hotel mit spektakulärem Golfplatz,"Ein sehr schönes Hotel, ca. 1 h entfrent vom Flughafen in Dublin. Sehr schöne Zimmer, sehr freundlicher Service. Personal ist sehr freundlich und bemüht. Das Rsstaurant ist gut aber nichts besonderes. Besonders wenn es sehr voll ist, geht die Qualität der Speisen und des Service deutlich runter.

Der Spa Bereich ist für irsche Verhältbisse gut, aber nnicht vergleichbar mit der Atmosphäre der SPA Bereiche in einem deutschen Hotel, er hat eher den Charakter eines städtischen Schwimmbades von vor 10 Jahren.

Ein ""must"" ist der Golplatz Drids Glenn. Anspruchvoll, sehr fair und von der Einbettung in die Natur outstanding!",4,2011,10,22
238,Nettes Hotel,"Das Druids Glen ist ein sehr schön gelegenes Hotel. Etwas außerhalb von Dublin. Es liegt unheimlich Ruhig in Mitten von einer schönen Landschaft.
Das Hotel selber ist ebenfalls schön gemacht und das Personal ist nett. Die Zimmer sind schön, geräumig, und sauber. Das Personal ist sehr Nett.
Allerdings ist es nichts für Leute die Etwas erleben wollen da im Umkreis nicht wirklich was los ist.",4,2010,09,02
238,Definitiv keine 5-Sterne,"Wir sind gerade von unserer Irlandreise zurückgekehrt. Sieben von insgesamt 10 Tagen haben wir im Marriott Druids Glen Ressort verbracht. Die Zimmer sind o.k. und großzügig. Allerdings sollte man darauf achten, dass man kein Zimmer mit Zwischentür zu einem anderen Zimmer bekommt, sonst hört man jeden Ton. Im Restaurantbereich und in der Bar mussten wir einen verwohnten und ungepflegten Zustand wahrnehmen. Beim Frühstück hatte ich morgens im Fruchtsalat ein Haar in der Schüssel - sehr appetitlich!! Die Warmhaltebehälter z.B. für Rührei waren sehr verschmiert. Auch das 2 x wöchentlich stattfindenden Barbeque auf der Terrasse war sehr unorganisiert. Erst nach einer Beschwerde beim Service gab man sich endlich Mühe und das Gegrillte wurde an den Tisch gebracht. Und mit stolzen 25.-€ pro Person ist es definitiv zu teuer und steht in keinem Verhältnis. Generell sind die Preise für Essen und Getränke im Hotel überzogen. Außerdem haben wir festgestellt, dass das Personal keine gepflegte Bekleidung trägt. Glänzende Jackets und Anzughosen sowie verwaschene und verkleckerte Bekleidung des Barpersonals machen nicht den besten Eindruck für ein 5-Sterne-Haus. Das sehen sogar wir als nicht Hotelfachmann. Höchstens 4 Sterne, eher 3,5. Aber definitiv keine 5 Sterne.",3,2010,08,05
238,"schönes Hotel, sehr gerne wieder","Das Hotel ist ruhig gelegen, weg von der Hauptstraße. Es sieht von außen sehr einfach aus, hat aber eine wunderschöne Lobby. Die Zimmer sind ziemlich groß (ca 30-35m2) und gemütlich eingerichtet. Das einzig negative sind die Preise im Restaurant, sie sind definitiv zu hoch. Ansonsten gibt es eingentlich nur positive Sachen zu sagen, das Personal ist sehr hilfsbereit, das Fitnesscenter und der Poolbereich sind schön gestaltet.",5,2010,06,03
