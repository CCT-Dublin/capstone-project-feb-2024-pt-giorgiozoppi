48,Home away from home in Barcelona,This was an absolutely wonderful experience.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  The accommodations were spacious with everything in order.

Beautifully decorated, large spacious bedrooms with comfortable beds, a fully stocked kitchen with all the amenities for cooking dinners, having coffee in the morning, and wine upon the breathtaking views from the rooftop patio.

48,At home in Barcelona ❤️,What a great apartment and lovely staff! Everyone had a nice room of their own and a private bathroom and comfortable living areas to gather in. Cooked several meals there which was fun. The rooftop area was the frosting on the cake. Just can’t say enough of how much we enjoyed our stay at casa grande! Thank you!,5,2024,10,05

48,Wonderful experience!,"We had a wonderful stay at Casagrand! The bedrooms were comfortable. The kitchen well equipped, and the living room was perfect to hang out it as a group of friends. 

The suite was exactly as depicted and the location great. Highly recommend!",5,2024,04,30
48,Great apartment,"Hugh apartment, beautifully furnished, clean, great location, friendly helpful staff. Great option for large family.",5,2024,04,20
48,Wonderful stay at the beautiful Casagrand Luxury Suites!,"We rented a 4 bedroom 3 bath apartment at Casagrand Luxury Suites for a 9 day visit to Barcelona. It was clean, spacious, attractive and well decorated and comfortable for our family of 4 adults. We had terrific top floor views from our front rooms. The kitchen was well equipped for those who want to cook, but it was stocked with only only oil, vinegar, salt and pepper. We did use some appliances which worked well. Nespresso pods were provided as well as a quart of cream and freshly filled daily bottles of water. Cleaning staff cleaned and straightened the apartment and provided fresh linens as needed daily.
The building is renovated and has beautiful old world charm. It was easy to find and we thought the location was superb, with an ATM next door, abundant shops, grocery stores, bakeries and restaurants within walking distance. We walked places easily but also used the metro from the conveniently located Diagonal metro stop.
The staff who spoke more English than I spoke Spanish were helpful, efficient and polite. The rental process was very easy to do online and precheck-in communication was excellent. The building is staffed every day and the front door is kept locked  with access controlled by the staff which gave us a great sense of security (guests are given a code to access the building after hours at a key pad next to the door). Members of my family used the work out facility which was very convenient. The top floor has lovely views  but it was too chilly and windy for us to use.
There are so many nice things that I could say about the property, but this review is already long. I would absolutely choose to stay at Casagrand Luxury Suites on another trip to Barcelona and don't hesitate to recommend it.",5,2024,03,11
48,Family break in Barcelona,"We loved it here. Our beautiful 4 bedroom apartment was absolutely huge, and very well appointed. The reception staff were very helpful and were able to solve any problems and help us organise airport transfers etc. We even tried out the rooftop pool and sauna even though it was February....

The apartments are located in an upmarket shopping district but if you're prepared to walk, you can get to most of the popular tourist sites on foot - we walked (with three small kids) to Sagrada Familia, Torre Glories and La Ramblas.

A great place to base yourself for a few days in Barcelona. We'll be back.",5,2024,02,19
48,5 STAR stay!! ,"Casagrand was an amazing place to stay! 5 stars! The location is amazing, staff helpful and friendly. Apt was impeccable and just like the photos. We are a family of 5 so was wonderful for everyone to have their own comfortable bedroom and bathroom. And a fantastic common area. My kids also loved the candy jars in the lobby :-) wish they had this hotel/apt set up in every city!! Highly recommend!!! ",5,2023,12,25
48,Wonderful Four Night Stay in Barcelona,"Casagrand luxury suites is a great place to stay in Barcelona. We rented the five bedroom apartment for four nights and it was very clean and comfortable. We spent a few hours on the roof and it was lovely, great views! The staff is very professional and helpful. Orlando in particular was a star! He helped us adjust the apartment heat to air conditioning upon arrival and checked on us every day. Thank you, Orlando! Check in and out was smooth. I would definitely stay here again. ",5,2023,12,01
48,Flexibility and kindness in bombastic large family gatherings!,"Our family rendezvoused at Casagrand from countries around the world for a wonderful trip! It was complex as our luggage was lost and flight home canceled yet the fantastic Chris and team there helped to accommodate us flexibly! They managed to be polite and worked with us even when in the emotionally charged led up to the visit! The beds were comfortable, the space accommodated our large family with space for everyone. The chef they recommended provided a fantastic holiday meal for our family. Know that they can take your luggage and hold it if you need to arrive early or leave late. Yet, they are busy and it may not be easy to check-in to the room early or leave it late - just like anywhere else - but they really work hard to help! Absolutely looking forward to returning there!",5,2023,11,30
48,Beautiful apartment and great location,"Absolutely stunning apartment with so much room for the 6 of us.  The location was wonderful...not in the big touristy area, but close to restaurants, shops and everything we enjoyed being close to.  Would 100% stay here again.",5,2023,11,27
48,Quite incredible ,"Was here the beginning of November for a few days. OMG!!!  all I can say is unbelievable.  The first thing is the reception desk arrival - fantastic the girl on the desk was so helpful and the little jars of sweets were a lovely touch.  She also arrainged a restaurant for us that evening and also arrainged transport back to the airport when we were leaving
We had come from a wedding in Llafrank and the penthouse we were in there was amazing and I didnt think it could be topped!! until  I came here the Apartment was beautiful, the furnishings were spectacular, the apartment was spotless, the beds were beyond comfy it is extremely well equipped.  We were in the 5 bedroom on the 5th floor
We were 3 couples and the location was perfect for exploring, getting to restaurants and seeing the sights.  The front desk staff, the maintenance staff and the cleaning staff were professional and friendly.  We are already arraigning our return visit",5,2023,11,13
48,Perfect for a large group or family,"Lovely apartments, look like the pictures.  Perfect for our family of 2 adults and 7 young people. Lots and lots of space, kitchen is well equipped too.  Rooftop pool is not heated in October and is very narrow but the terrace was nice to have and the gym is a good touch too.  We liked the location but it is a long walk to the beach (50 mins) and Las Ramblas (30 mins).  However it is good for shopping and we found some good tapas restaurants nearby.  Helpful staff, we loved it.",5,2023,11,02
48,Just Perfecto.,"We thoroughly enjoyed are stay and all the extra special touches that made it feel so welcoming and luxurious. Sparkling clean, stunning roof top views and very helpful and friendly Front Desk staff nothing was too much trouble, such smiley friendly people. Perfectly situated to explore the city. Thank you to the Team at CasaGrand for making our holiday memorable and so relaxing. We hope to be back. ",5,2023,11,01
48,Great property ,"Beautiful property.  We loved the location it’s steps away from everything. The property was very clean and the staff very friendly. 
It’s definitely luxurious. Looks just like the photos in the advertisement. Very unique ",5,2023,10,25
48,"Great location and staff, not so clean","The communication from the Casagrand team was excellent.  German was friendly and Orlando resolved the one issue with the bad light in the kitchen quickly. We appreciated the one way transfer from the airport too.

The location is excellent and convenient to anywhere you want.  We walked to many sites including la sagrada familia.

Our review is for the 5 bedroom 4 bath. The balconies were plentiful.  The kitchen is well stocked and we appreciate the filtered water.

Onto the unit itself: furnishings are good quality and thoughtful.

 The main downside is cleanliness.  All the rugs were thick but needed a deep clean.  I asked for a vacuum and was given a very flimsy one that had poor reach, bad handles and terrible vacuuming power. We stayed in the largest suite and could see the mold on the bottom of the glass shower panels.  

My other friends stayed in the smaller rooms and complained of a musty damp odor which permeated all over.  I called reception and inquired whether it could be smoke and was questioned whether we smoked.  Seriously? We opened windows but this did not help too much. 

The pool looked nice on pictures but definitely not functional. It looked dirty and had leaves floating on top. Was cold and super shallow.

We are ok with paying for quality and chose this place because of daily housekeeping.  Unfortunately we will skip this place next time we visit Barcelona.

",3,2023,10,14
48,Brilliant and would return,"The apartments are amazing. We loved the location and the staff were outstanding. A family
Of 6 with 2 small children travelling and all was nigh on perfect.

If I have one complaint it’s the depth of the wonderful roof top pool.
You cannot swim in it! It’s a paddling pool. Can’t believe I took my goggles😂.

It did not spoil the trip but is worth noting",5,2023,09,17
48,Beauty in the heart of Barcelona,Comfortable beds and beautiful rooms. And the people who work here are very nice! Great location as well. The front desk helped order us taxis and gave some recommendations. Definitely recommend to everyone.,5,2023,09,08
48,Wonderful apartment in the city,"Gorgeous apartment. Great location. Excellent service. Very well equipped kitchen, very clean Absolutely fabulous in every respect. The pool area is small but perfectly suited for sunbathing. Excellent location. ",5,2023,09,02
48,Gorgeous flats in excellent location,"Excellent location, beautiful and extremely well-equipped flat with a gorgeous rooftop terrace. Reception staff were friendly and helpful. The pool is simply for paddling, don't book if you actually want to swim because you can't but it was a lovely place to cool off. I would go back.",5,2023,08,25
48,This place feels like luxury - you get what you pay for here,"This place was amazing! Incredible space, beautiful decor, tons of amenities including a washer/dryer. They even thought of providing a tablet already logged into Netflix and other streaming apps so you didn't need to log in with your personal information - just cast to the large screen. Daily water delivery. Service was impeccable and concierge services where great (helpful w/restaurant recs & reservations and taxis). Note that the pool was small, long lap pool which limits capacity. The in-suite did get a little hot due to the sun exposure.

This place feels like luxury - you get what you pay for here.",5,2023,07,16
48,Amazing hotel,Amazing stay could not fault the hotel and its staff. Location was within walking distance to most things. Rooms clean and tidy. Staff very attentive nothing a problem. Would definitely stay again when on Barcelona,5,2023,06,28
48,Great location. Excellent customer service.  ,"My family and I traveled to Barcelona for vacation.  This was our first trip there and we had no idea where to stay.  Since were were traveling with family (6-7) people, we needed a large venue.  We chose Casagrand Luxury Suites and we were not disappointed!  This place is in a great location, and the apartments are very spacious and clean.  In addition, the hotel staff is very friendly and assisted us on a daily basis with taxi services, restaurant recommendations, etc.  If you are traveling to Barcelona with a big group, I would highly recommend this place!  ",5,2023,06,11
48,Beautiful flat in perfect Barcelona location. .,"The most beautiful flat in central Barcelona. Spacious and gorgeous. Roof top plunge pool a wonderful place to relax before dinner. Ordered the breakfast to apartment and they was wonderful too,  Would highly recommend staying here in luxury on your next visit to Barcelona. 
5 stars",5,2023,05,27
48,Luxury at its best!!!,"Highly recommend Casagrand Luxury Suites. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The apartment was amazing! The location was also a home run. While we felt like we were close to everything, it was not too noisy or crowded. A perfect blend! The only 'heads up' I would give those that stay here is if you intend to cook, you may want to make sure you have everything you need before you buy ingredients. While the kitchen was well stocked with 'essentials', there were a few items that it did not have which made cooking a bit tricky. Nothing at all that we were upset about, just a heads up. We were extremely happy here and highly recommend it to anyone! ",5,2023,05,11
48,"Wonderful Experience, Beautiful apartment!","We booked one of the 5 bedroom apartments for 2 nights pre-cruise and 1 night post cruise for our group of 8.  We loved everything about our experience.  Casagrand is in an excellent location making it easy to walk to many of the more popular tourist attractions and nearby abundant shopping and dining options.  The apartment itself was fabulous.  It was spacious ,clean and beautifully decorated.  Joseph at the front desk was wonderful.  Check in was easy.  We will definitely stay there again and will recommend to friends and family.",5,2023,05,04
48,Highly Recommended!,"Everything was great about this stay. Rooms were clean, comfortable, spacious, and luxurious. The suite had a modern fully equipped kitchen, dinning and living room.
Excellent location - in the center of Barcelona’s Eixample District pretty close to lots of restaurants, tourist attractions, and shops.
We felt safe and well taken cared of the entire three days with highly professional and receptive staff. We would love to return to this place when we visit Barcelona again in the future.",5,2023,04,15
48,See above,"What a wonderful surprise. I had my family of 11 and the apartments were the perfect solution. With 5 bedrooms and plenty of bathrooms it was the perfect solution to a large crowd. A huge kitchen and a living room with a very large round dining table next to windows looking at the city There is a full laundry room in the unit. There is an option to have your meals delivered, prepared in your room by their chefs or doing your own cooking in the fully equipped kitchen. I stayed in what they call the Top Floor with it’s own private balcony terrace with lounge chairs and beautiful plants. This unit had a large living room and a dining table and a large fully equipped kitchen. 
The location couldn’t possibly be any better. Right in the center of everything. A perfect place to enjoy Barcelona. ",5,2023,04,02
48,Beautiful apartment/incredible family vacation,"My family of 6 just spent 3 wonderful nights at Casagrand Luxury Suites. The apartment was beautiful and clean with an incredible kitchen. The bedrooms were large and most had en-suite bathrooms. The beds were super comfortable and the living/dining area was also beautiful. The rooftop was fabulous with plenty of seating and a pool. The members of our family that used the gym loved it. I am very hard to please and Casagrand exceeded my expectations.  The building, staff and location were excellent! I hope they open more places. I cannot wait to come back.",5,2023,03,23
48,10 out of 10 - Fantastic,"Some reviews need many words to get point across, the up's and down's. With Casa Grand, it's very easy, we had the 5 bedroom suite, it was massive and FANTASTIC. Great location, beautifully furnished, high end luxury items, e.g. Molton Brown toiletries, SMEG toaster, large screen TV, luxury bedding/pillows...this was a real home from home and reception staff were extremely professional and helpful. Definite 5 star with 10/10 experience.",5,2023,01,30
48,Best accommodation in Barcelona. Thank you,"What an amazing place. Location is perfect, all communication prior and during our stay was smooth and easy and the stuff is super nice.

We LOVE that place",5,2023,01,08

48,Wonderful Experience,"The staff was very friendly and helpful for our group of 6. The apartment was clean, well designed and more than what it looked to be in the photos. When back in Barcelona, we will be sure to stay here - I highly recommend it.",5,2022,12,12
48,Thanksgiving Family Holiday in Barcelona,"Our stay at Casagrand was wonderful!
German gave us (all 8 of us!) a warm, friendly, and efficient welcome at check-in. Then Orlando took care of our luggage and escorted us up for the grand tour. And they continued to ensure our needs were met the entire week, especially Orlando - even just the fresh water daily was a godsend. And our housekeeper was the sweetest, kindest woman that did a fantastic job keeping us clean and tidy.
The actual apartment is so huge it takes several videos (which I can’t upload here) and pics to capture it, and they really don’t do it justice. We did not want for a thing during our stay. And the location is central to so much of the city it was perfect!
I HIGHLY recommend and we will definitely be back!!!",5,2022,12,06
48,Just amazing,Such an amazing place and location. Really worth the price. Was there with work team. Cristino on front desk really helped us non-Spanish speaking folks immerse ourselves in the neighbourhood. Will come back with family.,5,2022,11,25
48,Great hotel,"We have stayed in this hotel
And we enjoyed so much ! The team was so kind.
The rooms are so nice, comfortable and clean.

We will definitely back to this hotel in our next trip to the city .
Thank you for the best accommodation

We will for sure go back!
Very luxurious but not expensive!",5,2022,11,12
48,NEVER AGAIN,"I booked a weekend with my family (+3kids). Location is great but the first day we had a BIG COCKROAGE in the bedroom. We wend to the reception and he told us.. Oh this is first time, i will someone to clean the room. End of the story. Noboby came to clean the appartement. Everything was the same when we came back from our diner. They didn't asked us anything about it. So NEVER EVER AGAIN. If you want to stay with cockroage then you can book this appartement. (we made a film and photo)",2,2022,10,04
48,Grand Accommodations in Barcelona's Casagrand Luxury Suites!,"Our party of 5 (6 for one night) stayed at Casagrande's Summum 5 bedroom suite for 4 nights. It was as grand, beautifully comfortable and clean as advertised. We loved it. The front desk staff was friendly, helpful and informative. The check-in process was easy and fast. The beds were very comfortable. There were several balconies throughout the apartment. It was lovely to open the balcony doors and listen to the hustle and bustle on Ave. Diagonal. The apartment was very well insulated from outside noise when doors and windows are closed. Milton Brown toiletries were provided. Starter Nespresso coffee packs were provided for free. Additional packs were available in the refreshments cabinet located in the kitchen. Breakfast pastries available to order for a fee.",5,2022,09,30
48,Summum 5 Bed Luxury Apartment,"As stated, this is really a very luxurious and spacious apartment and everything provided for you just to turn with a toothbrush. All rooms very clean and spacious and a fully equipped kitchen. All staff were very friendly and made us very welcome from arrival. The roof top terrace with splash pool a very nice added bonus. Only thing not available was the roof top sauna. Would highly recommend.",5,2022,09,23
48,Great place,"Great room though the private deck had another deck right next to it with people on it and a large surveillance camera on our deck seemingly pointing right at us. 
Apartment is terrific and use of public deck right on same floor was an addition. Good location",5,2022,09,14
48,Luxurious spacious safe this a tranquil place in busy Barcelona,"This spacious apartment has all you can wish for. The staff let you be, but is there in case of need. The avinguda diagonal offers you access to all sights. Close to batlo and sagrada but 25 minutes walking to the beach. 

In brief; luxurious and relaxed",5,2022,09,07
48,Excellent !!,"We came to stay for a 40th birthday celebration.. we were absolutely blown away with this apartment.  We had 5 bedrooms, one with a small balcony with table & chairs. Beautiful views from the rooftop pool... see pic attached.  Staff were really welcoming and friendly and tended to our every need.  Excellent location to all shops, bars & restaurants. We loved every minute and would certainly recommend!  Can't wait to return. Thank you Casagrand ❤",5,2022,09,06
48,Perfect for large groups,"We were 7 friends staying for a long weekend in the beginning of September. The apartment is very spacious and nice and staff cleans daily. Location is central although I'd prefer staying just a bit closer towards the ocean. Taxi down there is typically €10-15. Smooth check-in and check-out. Requires a €100 deposit for the room. Aircon in the apartment which is necessary when travelling in the Summer. Has a nice pool and common area on the roof. All in all, a highly recommended place to stay if you can afford.",5,2022,09,06
48,the best in everything,"It is the best place I ever stayed at in Barcelona. Location is perfect. Service is awesome and the staff is so friendly. What I liked about it also is the housekeeping services and how clean is the place.

I’ll definitely be staying coming back here again.",5,2022,08,20
48,Fabulous place to stay,"This is a fantastic 5 bedroom apartment—our two families of two couples and five kids loved it. Great service, beautifully decorated and friendly service. You can’t beat this luxurious accommodation in the heart of Barcelona.  Best for families.",5,2022,08,19
48,Absolutely stunning apartment,"We were a group of 9 females on my daughter’s hen weekend.
This 5 bedroom apartment was just perfect. The rooms were huge and beautifully decorated. It had all the amenities we needed and more.

Staff were so helpful and apartment was cleaned daily.
The location was perfect.
All in all the best accommodation we have ever stayed in.",5,2022,07,28

Staff were very friendly and helpful. All their recommendations for restaurants were spot on - thank you!",5,2022,07,26
48,Simply the best accommodation in Barcelona!,"My experience at Casagrand Luxury Suites was simply incredible. The countless amount of services and the kindness of the staff make this accommodation the best place to stay in Barcelona. 
In addition, Casagrand Luxury Suites is located in the most well-connected area of Barcelona. From there, you can quickly get anywhere, from Gracia to the city center. Highly recommended!",5,2022,07,06
48,40th celebration trip,"Spectacular huge apartment for a group of 5 friends. The space was amazing, very modern decor, and great furnishings throughout. The kitchen was perfect and a lovely lounge / dining area. The rooftop space was also lovely with a plunge pool, and while busier during the day, we had no problem late afternoon and for breakfast / early eve getting a sun bed or seat. The location is about 20 minute walk or 5 minutes metro from La Ramblas which is easy to do, but the area around the apartment has some nice shops and lovely restaurants. Sagrada Familia was only 15 minute walk away too and it was about 30 minutes from the airport. Hemingways is a must for cocktails! Highly recommend for a family or group of friends staying in Barcelona.",5,2022,06,28
48,Perfect hotel! Perfect location!,"Our time at Casagrande was outstanding! The apartment is beautiful, clean and the facilities and location were above expectation. I have to thank the staff at Casagrande the most, they bent over backwards to accommodate all our needs. Christino, Marta and German, thank you so much!",5,2022,06,28
48,"Exceptional, as always","This is the 5th time I have stayed at Casagrand and, as always, the service and quality was exceptional. For groups, families or individuals, this is your home away from home. Not a detail has been spared from the molten brown products in the bathrooms to the quality of the sheets and pillows. 

If you’re working from Casagrand, internet is excellent and you can head on up to the roof deck to get some sun. I keep coming back (either alone or in groups) as the service , quality and location cannot be matched. 

Huge thank you to the team for making this visit extra special.",5,2022,06,28
48,Excellent Large Appartment,"Very large appartment. We really loved it. Very complete kitchen, everything you need is there. They also have a minibar and roomservice.

48,Family vacation,"My family and I stayed here for two weeks and all I can say is “Wow”. The staff was amazing (friendly, professional and very helpful), the location is in one of the nicest neighbourhoods in Barcelona (close to shopping, restaurants, etc.) and the apartment (we stayed in their 4 bedroom unit) was just amazing (modern, comfortable, spacious, convenient amenities and quite luxurious). I will definitely be calling this establishment our “home” when we visit Barcelona again.",5,2022,05,14
48,Amazing spacious apartment in a great location!,"This was a clean, high quality and beautifully decorated apartment in a great location. There are shops, cafes and restaurants nearby so you don’t necessarily have to travel far for a meal. The staff were very helpful and friendly. The apartment was ready earlier than expected which was perfect which meant we could check in early. This apartment was faultless, from the cleanliness, to the beautiful furniture. The bed and pillows were super comfy and it honestly felt like home! When you look at the layout online, it’s clear it’s a big apartment, but it’s only when you are there you realise how spacious it actually is with extra large rooms and high ceilings! Honestly, I would recommend this to anyone who wants to have a luxury stay! Can’t fault it, it was just perfect!",5,2022,05,10
48,Fabulous stay in Barcelona,"We came in group and stay in 5- bedroom apartment. All of my friends were shocked how beautiful and comfortable the apartment was. Super clean and very closed to shopping, food and supermarket. Highly reccomend for everyone.",5,2022,05,08
48,5 star apartments ,"I stayed here for my hen do with 15 friends (spread across two apartments). All of my friends were shocked how nice the apartments were; they didnt expect them to be so nice. They was a suite in each apartment (the master bedroom), two small doubles and one large king plus the kitchen and living area. Given how nice they were I would have expected to pay double what we paid. Everyone has asked me for the details so they can pass it onto their friends (and it was recommended to me in the first instance). The staff were accommodating and helpful and ever so nice. I have been so impressed. They made my hen do so successful and I'm really grateful to them. ",5,2022,05,04
48,Absolutely perfect!,"Wow. We visited with our 7&10 yr olds and this apartment was perfect! Our apartment was utterly stunning. From the old fashioned lift to the sheer size and space that we had everything about Casagrande was amazing! 
We had a five bed place and everything was better than we hoped. Private door up to the roof, super clean and stylish and everything we needed. Tea, coffee, milk, water and bubbles all when we arrived, Molten Brown toiletries and lots of big towels. 
The guys and girls on the desk were super helpful, telling us good places to go and booking us restaurants. 
Location wise this is perfect, right on a main avenue so walking to restaurants is easy and it’s only 15 mins to the main square and Ramblas. 
We had the continental breakfast (all that’s available right now) delivered everyday which was ideal to kickstart the kids. 
I would definitely return to Casagrande and would highly recommend - a brilliant place to stay.",5,2022,04,21
48,"Beautiful Apartment, Absolutely Recommend!","Our family loved this beautiful, comfortable apartment in Barcelona. Great location, just a long block from the metro and so many stores, restaurants and sights within easy walking distance. The staff is friendly and super helpful. The apartment is spacious and has everything you need and more. We loved the rooftop deck with a little lap pool and hopped up there for sunsets, a glass of cava, and just to soak up some sun and relax for a bit. The workout room is great - all the machines plus a multi-weight configuration. I really can’t say enough about this lovely accommodation, I feel like we got a lot for our $.
It was more than perfect for our family, would also be great for a girls trip or couples getaway.",5,2022,02,27
48,Fantastic apartment and location!,"We are a family of 5 and stayed at the apartment for 4 nights. It was absolutely perfect with lots of room as well as a beautifully decorated  apartment. Be sure to sit on the roof top and catch the sunset .We will stay there again, no question!",5,2022,01,02

48,Amazing base for a Barcelona break,"I’ve just got back from a 3 night stay here with 6 of my friends and we had an amazing time. We’d already booked a 4 bedroom/3 bathroom apartment, but were lucky enough to be upgraded to an even bigger apartment with 5 bedrooms and 4 bathrooms. The apartment was huge and really light and open. The amenities in the apartment were great and so were the facilities - we used the rooftop pool on one day (it was still warm enough to lie in the sun at the end of October which was great). The apartment is also in a great location with lots of shops/restaurants nearby, and is walking distance to some great sightseeing spots. We’d definitely recommend. Thank you for a great stay!",5,2021,10,30
48,"Fantastic Apartment, Great Location","An excellent apartment, very well finished, cleaned and well kept. The staff were very helpful and friendly. The apartment is very well situated for getting around the city. The roof terrace was an added bonus, nice place to sit and relax.",5,2021,10,04
48,Brilliant base for a Barcelona Break!,"Ideally located on Avinguda Diagonal with restaurants and bars nearby that compliment the quality of Casagrand Luxury Suites. The terrace of the Top Floor was ideal for morning sunrises, fresh croissant breakfasts & G & T evenings. Interior detail creates a relaxing environment.",5,2021,09,25
48,"Excellent location, clean, bright and spacious apartments, lovely staff","I couldn't give enough praise to the staff and accommodations at Casagrand.  Our apartment was clean and very spacious, with modern amenities.  It truly had everything we needed. The staff was friendly and always very helpful.  We will definitely stay there again.",5,2021,07,29
48,Business,"Excellent; the property is oustsnding and the Minerva is a great person.
The location is perfect. It is clean, super nice and near good Restaurants.

Alvaro and the diver Pedro were right on target.

Thans a lot",5,2021,05,12
48,Chic Barcelona Luxurious Suite,"Very penthouse, contemporary vibes. We arrived early and left our luggage and freshened up in the gym bathrooms before exploring Barcelona. Very close to the underground subway system, which makes it super easy to navigate around the city. Very close walking distance to high end shops such as Prada, Louis and local designers. Welcome amenity is a bottle of crisp Cava and cake. Breakfast cafes, chic restaurants within walking distance.",5,2021,01,20
48,PERFECT!,"From check in, through to helping us with queries across our stay, the service was excellent .The terrace is stunning, location is exactly what we needed (minutes from city and beach) and the rooms are immaculate!",5,2020,09,08
48,"Casagrand, 478 Diagonal avenue, Barcelona, Spain","One of the best places to stay in Barcelona. Excellent rooms and services. Very very  Excellent staff and so friendly.
The location is very strategic and near from every thing.
This place will be my first and only choice to stay when I come go Barcelona. ",5,2020,06,09
48,We Didn’t want to leave!,"Casa Grand was so so wonderful for our family of 6 plus 2 friends, we stayed there for over a week. The apartment was so spacious and so clean and comfortable and so elegant. The location was perfect, close to everything, On a busy street but you Dont hear any noise from the streets or young people coming in late at night because of the beautiful the brick walls and triple paned windows. The housekeepers come in daily, theres a small gym and sauna available and the delightful staff is there at the front desk 24/7 to answer questions and help in any way! Montse, Teresa, Marta, Guillermo, Alex were so wonderful they made our time there even better ! We didn't want to leave!",5,2020,03,12
48,Very high quality in an excellent location,"We stayed (six adults and baby) for two nights in a four bed apartment.  The apartment was extremely spacious, beautifully furnished, spotlessly clean, very comfortable beds and lots of nice smaller touches e.g. toiletries, robes etc. Staff on the desk were very friendly & helpful and also replied to enquiries promptly before we arrived. Would recommend and would definitely stay again on a future visit.",5,2020,03,09
48,Excellent stay ,"We were two families with kids and booked the apartment for a 4 night stay. The apartment is amazing large enough which makes the stay very comfortable. The communication with the team was very efficient and quick even prior to the arrival. The breakfast option is excellent value for money as they deliver and set up everything in your apartment on the requested time. The top floor has a small swimming pool, sauna facilities and a lounge area which was great to relax even at this time of the year.",5,2020,03,02
48,Way better than expected,"As the title of the review mentions, our stay was way better than expected.  We were in town for business and others decided they wanted to stay in a hotel where prices were at least twice the per person price at our apartment.  When we hosted a pre-dinner gathering, every one of those people had wished they stayed in the apartment.  In fact one of them wanted the details to the company so he could book one of the apartments for a family vacation.

The bedrooms were away from the common areas which helped when anyone needed their own space.  Having the kitchen, dining room, and living room to socialize as well as work was invaluable.  There was daily cleaning which made it somewhat of a hybrid hotel and AirBnB.  I would be remiss if I didn't mention that the staff were exceptionally helpful and pleasant.  There was someone in the lobby at the door 24x7.

I would not hesitate to stay here again and will actually pass on the word to others at my organization that when needing to organize meetings in Barcelona, this is *the* place to stay.",5,2020,02,17
48,Top Notch,"These are spacious, well appointed, tasteful apartments with great 24 hour service. They are fairly new and everything works perfectly, plus there are many nice little touches, like free filtered water in glass bottles, an ironing board, nice soaps and lotions, and so on.  I almost hate to write about it because this place is going to get very popular. Mostly 4 and 5 bedroom places, very spacious.  And the people are very service oriented, responsive and friendly.  Absolutely a great apartment option in Barcelona, the best I have found (and have I spent 2+ weeks a year in the city for the last 10 years).  Oh, the location is terrific (top of Paseo de Gracia), can walk into Garcia, Eixample or Sarria in minutes.",5,2020,01,20

48,The best hotel in Barcelona.,"I visited for the second time.
Kind staff, location is Good, huge rooms. If I visit Barcelona again I will stay at this hotel.

In particular, Sasha and Alex were so kind that I was happy throughout the trip.

Thank you Sasha and Glad to see you again♡",5,2019,12,11
48,Simply the best,"Really simple: best service, great design and setup, fantastic location. From the moment you check to the time you exit, you feel fully taken care of. If only other big cities had something like this place...
Want to go back already, and it’s only Been two days. ",5,2019,12,03
48,Family vacation,"We are a family of 7, visiting our son who is studying in Barcelona.
Casagrand was fabulous! So much space for all of us, so much better than a hotel.
The apartment itself was lovely. Everything is fresh, clean and new. The staff is amazing, everyone so helpful and kind. It was like staying in your own home but better.
We highly recommend the Casagrand especially for larger families with children.
Also, this property is an excellent value, much less expensive than you would pay at a comparable hotel.",5,2019,12,01
48,Amazing apart-hotel!,"We traveled as a rather large group of 18 for our trip to Barcelona and was looking for something high end but not a hotel. When I come across Casagrand I knew this was the perfect accommodation for us and it did not disappoint. 
We had 1 x 5 bed apartment, 1 x 4 bed apartment 1 x penthouse apartment. Each apartment was so beautifully appointed, so spaciously laid out and so comfortable from the beds/linen/sofas/robes/slippers and molten brown amenities, a good supple of tea/coffee and other mini bar extras. 
The staff were also exceptionally helpful, Guillermo, Sasha and another young lady with dark hair (so sorry I did not get your name!) from assisting us with taxis, deliveroo's and kindly telling us to keep it down when we'd had a few too many wines one night! 
The location is amazing, a very nice area and nothing is too far away. The outside pool/sauna area is stunning (pool a bit small/slim but we wasn't there to swim!) I cannot recommend this place highly enough. Check-in was smooth as was check-out. 
Thank you so much - we will be back!",5,2019,11,20
48,Always Perfect,We loved staying at the Casagrand. Sasha was a pure joy and excellent host. We can't wait to come back next year. Highly recommend this for anyone coming for business or pleasure. Incredibly accommodating and close to lovely restaurants.,5,2019,11,12
48,Amazing time at Casagrand,"For a bunch of high-expectation frequent travelers, I can truly say that Casagrand not only met but certainly exceeded our expectations. The units were spacious, well appointed, excellently thought out and had the most comfortable high-end look and feel. The staff were also beyond accommodating and very knowledgeable. The location itself puts you within minutes from all the main attractions in the middle of the city and the immediate neighborhood’s, bars, restaurants and shopping are all amazing. Do not hesitate to book this place if you have a large group the savings and experience will not disappoint. ",5,2019,11,10
48,Cannot be faulted !,"Just stayed in one of the Casgrand appartments in Barcelona with our family for  3 nights. Our apartment was stunning and was absolutely huge, (sleeping 8) -  filled with books, beautiful contemporary furniture, lighting and art. Also every possible thing you might need was there, inc toiletries, bath robes, slippers, nespresso machine, all kitchen equpt etc etc. The staff at reception could not do enough for us and were extremely helpful whenever we needed a taxi or information on how to use the metro etc. 15 minute walk to centre of town - perfect place to stay.",5,2019,11,02
48,Fantastic apartment,"Casagrand absolutely made our stay. What an amazing apartment - so spacious, so much better than staying in a hotel. Great kitchen, well equipped, Nespresso machine and dishwasher. Bottled water provided daily and cleaning service - couldn’t fault anything. Reception staff happy to help with any queries/recommendations. Good gym and lovely roof terrace. The service providing daily pastries you can order the day before for breakfast was also a big bonus and unexpectedly didn’t even carry a huge surcharge for the convenience. Very impressed indeed, wouldn’t stay anywhere else if we return to Barcelona. Location was also great - nearest metro, Diagonal - very well connected. ",5,2019,10,31
48,"Amazing, clean property in a great location!","I cannot recommend highly enough Casagrand for families and friends travelling in groups! My girlfriends and I stayed in this truly beautiful and luxurious property for a fraction of the cost of what a luxury hotel would have been. The location was excellent, only a block and half away from the closest subway station, a block away from Las Ramblas with all its shops and cafes, and just two short blocks away from major attractions such as La Casa Mila and Casa Batllo. 

We stayed in a five-bedroom, three-bathroom unit that was extremely comfortable and well-appointed. There was a lovely balcony that wrapped all the way around the entire building. Bedroom 2 had its own private patio area too. Upon check-in to our apartment, we were greeted with a bottle of cava and a nice milk cake. The apartment was also furnished with a bottle of milk, bottles of filtered drinking water (which were replaced as often as we required, which was very often), coffee pods for the Nespresso coffee machine, and a full set of glassware, dinnerware, kitchen utensils and cookware, among other things. The bathrooms were furnished with quality towels and Molton Brown bath products. The beds were also very comfortable! Because the weather was cold, we did not avail of the rooftop patio and pool, though I'm sure it's lovely in the warmer months. 

The staff were also extremely helpful and friendly. Other than a few instances of miscommunication due to the language differences, the staff all handled our needs graciously and promptly. Agradecimiento especiales a Cristiano, Teresa, Sasha, and all others. We had a fantastic stay!",5,2019,10,28
48,Real luxury in the Eixample!,"This is truly a five star property that combines the experience of staying in your own fully equipped, clean contemporary apartment with the benefit of having helpful support staff right on site. My entire family stayed in a Summum unit located on the third floor of the building. Casagrand is situated on Avinguda Diagonal which is in the heart of the Eixample. This allows ready access to this bustling neighborhood replete with shops and restaurants and a less than 5 minute walk to the Diagonal Metro stop. Once inside the unit, all is quiet, comfortable, and spacious. The rooftop pool is a splash pool, not a lap pool, but it did a good job of cooling me off after enjoying the sauna. Casagrand really is accurately portrayed on the website-what you see is what you will get!",5,2019,10,13
48,Happy stay,"We stayed here with family group of 9 for 5 nights. The summum apartment (5 rooms + 4 bathrooms) was beautiful.  The staff (mostly all) were courteous and helpful. Absolutely clean and well equipped utilities were hits. The misses were that only 3 rooms have in suite bathroom, outdated lift and at arrival they provide you  a days supply of milk,tea bag, detergent etc. after that anything you call for us chargeable. The pool is small. sauna is open only from 6-9 in the evening.
Location: it’s centrally located with walking distance to high end shopping street Passeig de Gràcia, eateries etc. museum, Gaudi’s le Pedrera and Casa  Batllo are 10 min. walking. The famous La Rambla is bit far (approx. 20 min. Walking).",4,2019,10,09
48,amazing stay,"We stayed in the 4 bed apartment, with 8 of us! from start to finish we had amazing service from all of the staff with a special shout out to Willam who helped us in the right direction to some an amazing restaurants and clubs. The apartments and pool area were keep clean and tidy at all times. Although pool area was small it was a great extra to the apartment. Over all we had an amazing experience and would highly recommend the stay here.",5,2019,10,03
48,One of the few places where it looks better in real life than the pictures.,"One of the few places where the rooms look better in real life than on the pictures. Extremely impressed with the quality here, and staff were caring! Only slight negative was the 11am checkout. We all had a night out before, so this was brutal. I do however understand that they need to clean the large rooms before the next guests arrive.",5,2019,09,30
48,"Awesome stay, great for families ",My extended family (ages ranging 2 to 85) had a blast staying at Casagrand.  We stayed in the large 5 bedroom / 4 bathroom apartment which was amazing for large groups — everyone had their own privacy yet the huge living room was great for hanging out.  Rooftop terrace and basement gym are both small but great (and not too crowded).  Location is in a nice part of the city with a major metro stop 1-2 blocks away and bus stops right around the corner.  Only minor negative is that the rooftop terrace closes earlier than ideal. ,5,2019,09,28
48,Loved it  ,A few of us stayed in a 4 bedroom apartment for a couple of nights. We loved everything about it. From the service of the front desk staff to our apartment everything was top notch.  We all agreed that it was the nicest place we stayed at on our whole trip. Thanks again.  ,5,2019,09,15
48,Amazing Stay at Casagrand Luxury Suites!,Our family (6 adults and 1 one-year-old) had a wonderful time here in August 2019! The staff was absolutely amazing with fantastic recommendations and very accommodating. They were always available to assist with bookings and other matters. Everything was very clean and modern. We will certainly be back and had a great time!,5,2019,08,20
48,Just Beautiful!!!,"My husband and I stayed at the Casagrand Luxury Suites with 3 other couples in the 5 bedroom suite .. there aren't enough words to describe how impressed we were with the accommodations and  the  hospitality of your staff. They ensured every need was met and offered to keep our luggage while we completed another part of our ""holiday"" in Spain for 3 days at no cost after we checked out. This was above and beyond anything offered by any establishment we have visited and we travel very frequently.  We look forward to visiting again.",5,2019,08,20
48,Perfect in every way,"We stayed at the Casagrand suites with our family of four and another family of 5 and there was room to spare.  Every single person we encountered at the front desk and concierge was more helpful than we ever expected.  They helped us navigate Barcelona, they met every need we had with waters and towels and even helped us order a pizza for the kids.  It's perfectly located and within walking distance to restaurants, bars, shopping, the metro and anything you could need.  Without a doubt I would book this location again.  I hope to find other Casagrand properties in other cities when we travel in the future.",5,2019,08,07
48,Wonderful accommodations and help and location,After a two week trip around Europe with three kids this was the best ending to our trip ever.    Luxurious flat in the best location with the most helpful staff you could ask for.   I would go back in a heartbeat!,5,2019,08,05
48,Amazing!,"I can’t say enough about this place. We stayed at the end of July and booked a 4 bedroom apartment for our family, sharing with our friend and her daughter. From the moment we arrived, everything was fabulous!

We were upgraded to a 5 bedroom apartment with a small balcony and all I can say is the photos don’t do the place justice. It was ENORMOUS and everything was top spec and carefully maintained. The beds were super comfy and the towels fluffy, while all the little extra touches made the place feel special - from the complimentary water, which was replenished daily to the Molton Brown toiletries, daily maid service, chilled bottle of cava on arrival or the complimentary soft drinks on the beautiful roof terrace. These all added something extra to the stunning apartment. 

The concierge service was great too - Sasha and Guillermo were super helpful and were able to recommend and book great restaurants for us - nothing was too much trouble. 
I would definitely stay here again. It’s not a cheap place, but this standard does not come cheap. 

Highly recommend without any hesitation!",5,2019,08,05
48,Lived up to all our expectations ,"Stayed here for a week with family in a four bedroom apartment. Cannot speak highly enough of the space and amenities. Full kitchen, laundry room, with a sound system in every room. Staff at the front desk (Sasha and Guillermo) were extremely helpful on where to go and what to see. Location was perfect for us, just a short walk to Las Rambla and to the metro. 
We will definitely be back",5,2019,08,04
48,F,The apartment is very bad Air conditioned Very hot The workers at the reception are uncooperative Requests for repairs They have the worst apartments in Barcelona The apartment is not as luxurious as the expensive financial value,1,2019,07,29
48,Vacation,"Very nice apartment. Expensive though. Excellent location. Very close to Las Rambla Street, where you will find lots of tourists and restaurants. Very friendly staff. The only problem that you have to check at 11 AM. ",4,2019,07,22
48,Great for large families,"What a wonderful apartment!  Great location close to metro and walking distance to many sights.  The rooms are clean, spacious, quiet, and certainly deserving of the term ""luxury.""  Excellent facilities and friendly staff.  Definitely would stay here again.",5,2019,07,16
48,Broken/Old Air Conditioning System???,Place is beautiful and located in a convenient part of Barcelona to see all the sights and take in the beautiful city.  We stayed there three nights and the Air Conditioning was not functioning properly any of the nights there.  We notified the front desk at least three times each day and it was not until the day of check out that someone figured out how to fix it.  Tremendously disappointing stay at an otherwise beautiful location.  Use caution when booking here...,3,2019,07,14
48,"Fantastic! Loved everything about the hotel, staff and location!","The apartment is beautiful and huge. We were surprised how large the apartment is and how well it is decorated and stocked. The staff were fantastic and could not have been more accommodating and friendly. The showers, towels, and linens are top notch and the beds are really comfortable. The location is perfect. I cannot say enough great things about this hotel.",5,2019,07,12
48,Superb accommodation ,"Casagrand was beautiful,spacious and lovely. We were surprised at how big the apartment was!!
The rooms are grand and tastefully appointed, the pool and surrounds were gorgeous and the staff so helpful and professional.

We were 5 adults ( mature age) travelling together and loved everything about the property and can thoroughly recommend this luxury apartment it was a definite highlight of our accommodation choices😍",5,2019,07,09
48,Space and Luxury,"What a fantastic location for 9 best friends to spend a long weekend.  The apartment was clean & luxurious and the staff very friendly when needed.  Great for groups looking for a central location and plenty of communal space to be in (great kitchen, dining and lounge areas).  Nice touch to have some water, milk and juice on arrival.  Only negative if picking is the size of the rooftop terrace pool - very small but the beach / harbour wasn’t too far a walk (40 mins)",5,2019,07,08
48,Chic & Luxurious Apartment in Eixample District,"This apartment exceeded all our expectations.
I can 100% recommend this luxury apartment to any families or large groups wanting a luxury stay in Barcelona.

The staff were very friendly and accommodating, they made the experience one we will never forget. Many thanks to the team at Casagrand Luxury Suites!",5,2019,07,08
48,Amazing luxury apartment style hotel,"Stacy and I would like to personally thank the Casagrand team for making our stay and experience so wonderful.  

From the very beginning when we made the reservation last year to dealing with our multiple changes and deliveries to accommodating all of our guests, you guys have been so kind and helpful.  

It wasn’t easy for us to plan a stay with so many people from so far away but the service and professionalism that you guys gave us helped to make our experience so much easier.

We really couldn’t have done this without Casagrand and we will forever be grateful that you helped make our wedding weekend that much better for all of our guests.

I want to personally thank Sasha, Chris, Alex, Aran and Guillermo for going above and beyond their job duties and providing us with exceptional service before and during our stay.  

I’m sure there are other people who also helped that I didn’t get to meet.

Casagrand will always serve a special place in our heart when we remember our wedding weekend and we will definitely be back in the future.  We will recommend Casagrand to everyone who is visiting Barcelona!

If there’s anything that would help (trip advisor reviews, etc), let me know, we are more than happy to do that.

With Love,

Sean and Stacy",5,2019,06,29

The apartment was spotless , they went above and beyond providing us with a starter package of water, milk juice, coffee and assortment of tea. This is such a unique detail. The last thing you want is after a long day of traveling to wake up the next day like crazy looking for a warm cup of coffee. Daily service was great. Location was perfect shops, restaurant, pharmacy within walking distance. They respond immediately to any questions you may have. Reception was friendly and helpful. I will definitely recommend Casa Grand but only if you want to be spoiled and pampered on your vacation!
Will definitely return and recommend.",5,2019,05,31
48,Casagrand Luxury Suite,"Casagrand luxury suite was our favorite apartment during our Barcelona visit.  We had an apartment with 5 bedrooms and 4 bathrooms.  The place was clean, spacious & comfortable.  There was a balcony wrapping around the apartment which was a huge plus. It's just like a home. We even cooked dinner in the kitchen. The apartment is in a central location and very close to the metro station. The receptionists were very nice and helpful.  We had a good stay.",5,2019,05,28

They go above and beyond to make your stay memorable! We were picked up in a Mercedes Van and taken to the apartment where we were greeted  with a big smile and friendly welcome by Marta.
When I walked into the apartment I was stunned by the size and beauty of the place! It was my birthday week so I was given the master suite! It was truly amazing! It had a sitting area, balcony with a table and chairs, the most beautiful bathroom with soaking tub, huge closets , plugs for american appliances, and the most comfortable bed!!! 
The other 4 bedrooms and bathrooms were beautiful appointed too!
The morning after we arrived we ordered breakfast and it was delicious and beautiful presented! They give you coffee and water everyday and we had maid service.
On my birthday we had a private chef come  to prepare paella, that they recommended, it was the highlight of my week! Josh was truly amazing!
I have to say, this was my favorite trip ever and my favorite place to stay in the whole world! The apartment was spectacular but it was the people who made it memorable!

One morning we used the communal terrace with pool and a similarly high standard was present here also.

The reception and staff at the apartments were really friendly, and made us feel right at home immediately.",5,2019,04,30
48,10 out of 10,"Family of five on vacation, perfect place, great part of town with plenty of local restis, awesome staff so helpful. Apartment basically brand new, beautifully done, ample room for our three teenagers to have their own alone time",5,2019,04,21

We were on second floor, the suite is very spacious, with 4 bedrooms, works perfect for our group size with 4 adults and 2 kids. There is pastry and sparkling wine await for your arrival.

Think the entire building is recently renovated. There are handy man to carry your bags.

The gym is in the basement, good for a morning workout before the city excursion.

Rental is not cheap, but reasonable as it comes with 4 nice rooms.

Staff at front desk always come with a smile and helpful! We’ll be back!",5,2019,04,20

Highly recommend this place to stay a few days.",5,2019,02,25
48,Totally blown away,"What a great place!  Totally blown away by the size, luxury and quality of the apartment, and the service from the staff.  We were visiting Barcelona for half term with kids and a granny, and the apartment was perfect both as a base and for hanging out.  Kids loved it (not least the chance to watch Netflix in their downtime), as well as the adults.  Casa Mila / La Pedrera is only a short walk, and we even walked to the Sagrada Familia (c. 25 mins).  With the Metro close by, it's easy to get down to La Rambla / across the city.  The staff at the front desk were very helpful and gave us great advice on local restaurants (some nice Tapas and a good Italian close by).  The rooms were spacious and high quality, with nice touches like Molton Brown products, and even the free tea, coffee and cake on arrival was appreciated!  Can't recommend enough.  Perfect for a stay in Barcelona.",5,2019,02,24
48,Maybe the best service ever,"More than a perfect room (OK, maybe it could have been a little cooler temperature), was  the service of the staff.  Every single desk person and bellman went above and beyond anything we have ever experienced before and all of it with the biggest, warmest smile one could imagine.  No request (and we had a few) was questioned.  On the contrary the staff wanted to know what else they could do to make our stay even easier and better. Casagrand is the absolute perfect place to stay when in Barcelona!",5,2019,02,05
48,Great stay! ,"Stayed on the top floor. Huge apartment - best quality. Great private terrace and the pool right next door. 
Nice quiet surroundings and still within walking distance to the Rambla. 
Will definetely be back! ",5,2019,02,02
48,Outstanding Stay... skip everything else and just come here,"Just spent a week in Barcelona staying at the Casagrand Luxury Suites with my family celebrating a milestone birthday.

First: Our group. 3 couples and a single woman. Birthday boy turned 40, and included parents who are in their 70's. Others were somewhere in the middle, but all experienced travelers who have generally high standards for lodging.

Second: Our room: Principal Floor, Room 1 (only room on the floor). 5 beds, 4 baths.

Location: I sorta did zero research into Barcelona before booking or arriving on site, so I didn't know what I was walking in to. After a week, I can tell you that this place is right smack in the middle of everything - open google maps and type in what you want to go to - seems like everything is a kilometer in any given direction, so it couldn't be more centralized if it wanted to. There is a lovely walking district across the street for breakfast (Bo Pan was great!), Starbucks if needed. Fantastic restaurants such as Catalona Cerveza as recommended by Sasha at the front desk - fantastic tapas. There is a pharmacy next door, and several small grocery stores on the next block if you decide you need some supplies, or want to make dinner in the unit as we chose to do one night. One block over is the high rent district if you feel the need to buy a Prada bag or Channel scarf or whatever people buy in those places.

The Unit: It seems that all the units are close in spec, but not identical like a hotel would be - ours didn't match the pictures in terms of exact layout, but style and general layout was close enough. Bright white walls, minimalistic and stylish appointments such as artwork and decor that are calming and make you feel like you're staying someplace special. Floors throughout are wide planked wood (guessing an engineered floor, but not a cheap laminate). The building was built like a tank - very solid construction and therefore sound doesn't travel through walls, etc. Appliances are all modern and top notch, as are cabinets, plumbing fixtures, etc. The unit is laid out as a long hall, with the bedrooms in a row. I never heard anything from any of the rooms, despite my parents blaring CNBC in the next room. Someone did say they heard someone snoring one night, but I find that hard to believe. The windows are well sealed - we heard street noise for the first two nights, and then I realized that my husband neglected to properly latch the window - once that was done, it was virtually silent except for the occasional siren.

Bathrooms came with daily refresh of Molton Brown products, luxurious towels, and a basic cleaning. The beds are very comfortable with fantastic sheets and pillows.

The Staff: This is what makes this place so awesome. There is a 24/7 front desk that is manned by one staff member across 3 shifts. You could call down at any time and request things like refreshed bottled water (as we frequently did), taxis (though they could always be hailed right from the street, but with a larger group it was easier at times to have them just come on request), or recommendations for dinner or things to do. We especially enjoyed working with Sasha and Minerva who were always willing to answer our questions or help us out. Sasha insisted that we always call her on the phone rather then coming to the lobby, but we enjoyed her company so much we would often just go down stairs and surround the desk and throw questions at her. The cleaning crew were often like ninjas - we didn't see them, but we'd come back and the place would be all picked-up and reset. Each night, another gentlemen would come back to get us more water. Since there are only a handful of units in the building, the service is very personal - after a day, the staff knows who everyone is, and you build a true rapport with them. They learn your preferences and what you like, and they're able to provide better service as a result.

In my professional life, I visit a lot of 5-star properties, mostly in the US, and I can say that this place stacks up. It's all the benefits of a hotel, but with the freedom and space of an airbnb - couldn't have chosen a better place to go with my family and friends. If I return to Barcelona, no doubt this is where I'll stay.",5,2019,01,18
48,Best place in Barcelona for groups!,"This could be the best place for groups in Barcelona.
Location: Central with easy access to anywhere in Barcelona yet not in the crowded touristy area.
Flat: very spacious +200sqm with 5 rooms (summum suite), very clean, high quality furnishing and amenities.
Staff: Always available, accommodating and nice,
Facilities: small gym with a rooftop terrace and plunge pool!
Highly recommended for a group of at least 4 people.",5,2019,01,14
48,Absolute Class,"Perfect place to stay, seamless check-in. Staff were superb throughout, providing any advice and sorting problems immediately. Accommodation has everything you need, well located and amazing street views. It is on one of the main streets in Barcelona, walking distance to Gaudi cathedral, 10 mins to Camp Nou and around 10 mins to get to the beach area. Loads of great places to eat and drink surrounding. Definitely worth a try. ",5,2019,01,12
48,Wonderful Holiday Stay,"We, a group of 5 adults and 3 teens, stayed here over the Christmas holidays.  We found the staff to be extremely helpful with respect to providing extra water and towels upon request or calling two taxis at any given time.  They were very accommodating (late check out) and welcoming (some cake upon arrival).

We found the beds and pillows very comfortable.  You have to ask for extra towels for your hair or washcloths, but they are gladly provided.  We utilized the kitchen one night; we had what we needed.  We ran through our coffee stash, but there is a lovely little grocery around the corner (a great bakery is around the corner, too, and a pharmacy is next door should you need it).  We enjoyed our views (we had the 5th floor apartment), but we recommend ear plugs because we could hear the little one next door from time to time (however, I am fairly convinced I would have heard her if I were in a tank - LOL).  Our only ""complaint,"" such that it is, is the apartment ran a tad warm for our liking.  Opening the windows a bit solved that issue readily, however.  Otherwise, we appreciated the spaciousness of the apartment very much.

We utilized the washer and dryer (and appreciated that instructions were available in English).  Note that you buy laundry pods from the front desk for 1E a piece.

We have used AirBnb and VRBO all over Europe, the US, and the Caribbean. 
 We definitely recommend these apartments.",5,2019,01,07
48,Perfect Rooms with Terrific Service,"We stayed at Casagrand for two nights in the Summum Suite, which can house 9 people at maximum capacity, sort of an overkill for our group of 4. The first thing you nitice about the suite itself is how spacious it is. Then you notice the individual features, like separate thermostats for each room, the kitchen which probably has every tool you need and then some, and so on. The rooms are remarkably clean and well kept, and they stayed that way for the remainder of our trip. The rooftop pool and the sauna provide nice accents for the stay.
While the hardware of the property is excellent, the people of Casagrand are also superb. They will help you with standard concierge tasks like finding amazing restaurants and calling taxis. They will also go beyond their duty and help you track that phone you left on the taxi to the airport.
The superb location doesn't even require an explanation. Look at the map!
All in all, a great place to stay, and with these prices, I do not see a reason not to choose Casagrand for your next group trip to Barcelona.",5,2018,12,24
48,Great location and amazing flat,"The flat is very modern and nicely decorated. It has plenty of space for all the guests. The service is incredibly good. The flat is cleaned every day and they help you with everything at the reception.
It has a very nice roof terrace with a pool.
The next time I go to Barcelona I will stay again with them.",5,2018,12,19
48,Great place to stay for a group!,I can't say enough about Casagrand.  From the booking all the way through to check-out they were nothing but excellent.  I had a group of 6 that were staying 2 nights before boarding a ship to cross the Atlantic.  From the beginning we were picked up from the airport and taken directly to the hotel.  The apartment was well appointed and so modern.  There were 4 rooms for each of us to share or have to our own.  3 bathrooms (2 en-suite and one shared) provided all the privacy we needed.  The beds were very comfy and just what we needed after 24h of traveling to BCN.  The kitchen was well appointed and wish I had more time to use it.  the living and dining areas were great and a nice lounge area for us.  Nice balconies for looking down on the roads.  I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice modern and comfy place to stay in BCN.  It is perfect for groups and comes at a great price.  I would defiantly stay here next time we are in BCN.,5,2018,12,16
48,Visitting Barcelona ,"Nice place, it’s huge, clean, awesome staff . They come clean every day while u are gone, location in excellent, rooftop is small but it’s super cute . It’s yo cold for us to hang out, but I can see people would do that during summer time ",5,2018,12,04
48,Amazing accomodations in Barcelona,"Casagrand is a wonderful option for travelers. Honestly, would never stay in a hotel again.

48,Fabulous!!,"Had an amazing 2 night stay at Casagrand,the apartments are beautiful with every amenity you could wish for...even hair straighteners! The whole apartment had a luxurious feel and the beds were so amazing and comfortable it was like sleeping on a cloud! Sasha and her team on the consierge desk were always on hand & couldn’t do enough for you, the service they gave was impeccable.We had milk etc in the fridge on arrival which was handy and a bottle of Cava & lovely lemon cake as a welcome touch as we were celebrating big birthdays. Definitely recommend & if I could give 6 stars I would & really hope to return one day. Thank you for everything!!",5,2018,11,22
48,Our holiday at Casagrand,"Best place to stay in Barcellona!!!! Highly recomended 
Well placed, great service, huge apartments, very clean, well decorated, lovely people at concierge
We really loved our holiday at Casagrand and we will be back soon",5,2018,11,06
48,Excellent stay in a 5 star appartement and super professional staff !,"The appartement we stayed at (4 bedrooms, 3 badrooms) was the best we ever had. We come to Barcelona once or twice a year since the last 15 years. It was a first at Casagrand and this will be from now on our stay for the future visits to Barcelona. No hotel will beat the service, the level of comfort ( I stayed a Hotel Arts before ) of these suites and the staff. Make no misstake and book this venue. Top!",5,2018,11,04
48,Absolutely Fabulous !,"Just come back from spending 4 nights celebrating our daughters 21st birthday in these fantastic apartments. 
From the lovely reception staff to the old style lift and then the wow upon wow when you discover your apartment this place is truly a five star experience. 
All the bedrooms are spacious and the beds are incredibly comfortable. The kitchen has everything you could possibly need and the view from the balcony is great. 
There are many many great shops and restaurants within easy walking distance and also very close to the main tourist bus routes. 
Overall if you are unsure, trust me, book these apartments and you will not be disappointed.",5,2018,11,03
48,Overall Great Experience,"Location is great. The space in our 5 bedroom apartment was very nicely furnished. Plenty of room for our party of 6 and then some. Staff was for the most part accomodating. The rooftop terrace was a wonderful place to hang out. Overall, a very good visit. I would definitely stay here again and no problem recommending for a family or larger groups.",5,2018,10,29
48,Excellent choice,"Beautiful 5* structure, with huge luxury apartments. A swimming pool on the terrace for those who want to enjoy a sunset aperitif, like we dit. Among the best locations in Barcelona, ​​in one of the favorite areas, ""la Gracia"". Excellent choice for travelers interested in monuments, walks in the city and architecture. Excellent staff. 
I will be staying here again when travelling to Barcelona.",5,2018,10,16
48,"Exquisite Apartments, Amazing Service","The apartments are huge, very well appointed and super comfortable - I've stayed in 5 star accommodation in various countries and the level of comfort and luxury at Casagrand is as good as anywhere I've experienced, a truly unique experience. We only stayed a few days whilst in town on business but I'm now planing to come back for a family holiday. Every possible effort was made by the reception staff to make us feel welcome and their positivity and friendly, can do attitudes, were much appreciated - thanks for everything guys hope to see you again soon.",5,2018,10,14
48,Casagrand apt in Barcelona,"Our apt was fantastic and  did not lack anything. It was truly a luxury apt. The location was perfect and within walking distance of many restaurants and shops.
The staff was very professional, knowledgeable and so helpful and friendly.  I would recommend this place without any hesitation and when we return to Barcelona, we will be staying here again.
After this experience, my wife and I will not be staying at a hotel again.
One word.... excellence",5,2018,10,11
48,The most amazing apartment but the staff really bring it down!,"Once entering our apartment all of our jaws hit the floor, every room was another wow factor it was just incredible so I would happily stay there again, but I just want to warn/leave feedback to other visitors about the staff. 

We were left a bottle of prosecco with 7 glasses and cake on the table in the living room with a little note saying I hope you all enjoy your stay and thank you for choosing Casa Grande so as this was for a hen party, we thought this was a nice little treat they'd left us as it was a special occasion- we ended up getting charged around 50 euros for this prosecco so I think that is disgusting, as we hadn't asked for it and it was left on the table in an ice bucket with a little note, surely everyone would then assume it was complimentary, we had bought our own drinks from duty free so we didn't need this so that was uncalled for. On the first morning we were washing up said champagne glasses and an espresso mug so the cleaners didn't need to and one fell into the other in the sink and they both typically got chipped so we went downstairs to apologise straight away and said we would replace them (as we'd seen them for 2 Euros in a cute little homewares shop nearby) and the receptionist changed her character straight away and got very nasty and said she will just charge us for them- far more than necessary. As there were 7 of us and we wanted to do a few different things- I don't drink so I knew I wouldn't be out as late as some of them I asked at reception if we could get another key card as 2 between 7 was really not ideal and again the woman's attitude was very cold and aggressive and said old hotels don't give everyone keys so we just have to keep coming back downstairs to leave our keys at reception as we shouldn't even be taking them out of the hotel?!
I've never heard that before (plus I'd just come back from New York with my family and all 6 of us got given a key card). So that evening I asked the night reception guy to look after my key and he ignored me so I said I've been told to leave this here and he sighed at me and said fine, without looking up at me or anything, so rude.

Then the next morning we were initially a bit late for check out as our suitcases wouldn't close (we flew out with Ryanair but back in with Easyjet and forgot our handbags had to go in the suitcases so that was a squeeze) but at 11:05 we got a phone call from the same woman on reception as said we were ok until 12 and then after that we would be charged 70 Euros an hour, so we thought ok that takes a bit of the stress off we'll have to pay 10 Euros each so we then actually spent half an hour cleaning the kitchen etc and we left the cleaners a full bottle of Gin and Champagne (which we told the desk about and she rudely informed us none of her staff drink, ok it was just a nice token so I apologise that seemed to offend her so much) so when we went down at 12:20 we thought we'd be getting charged for half an hour as she said I will need to charge you 40 Euros and we said ok that's great least it wasn't 70.
But once we were all ready to leave she goes actually I have to charge you 112 Euros as you had 11 till 12:20, we were fuming we would have got out before 12 if she didn't tell us we had until 12 before we were charged.
Plus we should have left pots out etc if we knew we were then going to be charged for it. 
Also in the afternoon when we were getting ready for our taxi to the airport the guy on the desk said the cleaners found a broken corkscrew that had been hidden and he was going to charge us for that too. All 7 of us at different times dealt with this as we came back separately and we all stated we had never seen this corkscrew and had no reason to use it. It was like they were trying to pin extra things on us as we were a hen party but we weren't a typical wild party we just wanted to chill and get a last bit of sun before winter hits in England. 

I'm just disgusted with how we were all treated and how we had to pay over 200 Euros extra because of things they misled us about! I'd just be careful if you are their as a party rather than a family. I've told everyone about the service and extra charges we received and everyone's been flabbergasted I've never known anything like it. It's such a shame when the apartments are so stunning, I'd just go with my partner next time and stay away from the staff as I assume we'd get different treatment it just being the 2 of us, and don't assume anything is complimentary. 

Also just a few little problems with the apartment- the radiator in the living room had so much mold underneath it, and half an hour into our stay the heating came on full and we were all baking and it wouldn't turn off and one of the showers didn't work, (thankfully it was in the room with the bath so they just used that all weekend) so we had 2 guys walking in and out our rooms etc for about 20/25 minutes, they also first blamed us and said we'd tampered with the heating but we were still running around exploring the place, no one had touched anything- so again with the rude staff, no knocking before entering our rooms etc. Just a bit of a let down really.",3,2018,10,09
48,Fantastic weekend,"Absolutely amazing apartments and could not have asked for more. It is better than the pictures. 8 of us had the pleasure of a long weekend and the staff were amazing. We arranged for supplies for the apartment ahead of arrival and Sasha and the reception team sorted this out without any fuss. 
Great location on junction of Diagonal and Ramblas . Loads of bars and restaurants nearby .
Would I return - 100% yes 
Thanks for a great weekend ! ",5,2018,10,02
48,Amazing !!!,"It was an amazing experience. Loved the apartment. Great interiors, amazing space. iTS A HOME AUTOMATED HOUSE WITH SPEAKERS IN BUILT. Location was also really good and staff was friendly. Pool is smaller than in the pictures but that shouldn't stop you from staying here. Would definitely stay here again. Beats any hotel in Barcelona if you going with a big group even the W for that matter.",5,2018,09,21
48,Better than the pictures!,This apartment is fantastic.  Fabulous location within walking distance of all the major sites.  The bedrooms are very large and three have ensuite bathrooms.  The kitchen is well stocked.  Our family of 7 stayed for two nights and we could not have been happier.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  I highly recommend this apartment.,5,2018,09,11
48,"Beautiful, well located apartment with great services as well","This is the best apartment I have ever stayed at while traveling.  I was with a group of work friends, but this would be the perfect place for a family trip as well.  The apartment is absolutely beautifully designed and has everything you would need (full kitchen, plenty of nice towels, washer dryer, etc).  Plus, unlike most apartments, you have on-site service if you need anything.  When I go back to Barcelona I will try to stay here again.",5,2018,09,10
48,Stunning Apartment with very helpful and accommodating staff,"Fantastic! Great location, great value. I highly recommend staying here and I would stay again!

We stayed in  a very spacious 4 bedroom apartment with each room having its own private bathroom. A kitchen, A living room and x 2 dining areas. So beautiful and comfortable :)

48,Excellent place to stay for large family ‘ so clean and very nice view in the middle of most luxurious area of Barcelona,"The apartment was in the heart of Barcelona, near from High class shopping streets and Restorant, the further is comfortable , modern, clean, new and beautiful decoration. Really the apartment is more beautiful than the pictures in the website, I really appreciate all the amazing people who working very hard to made us happy in our 22 days staying in Barcelona ",5,2018,09,01
48,Incredible apartments and service,These apartments are a haven in the middle of the city. Central located with simple metro or cabs to most key attractions or in cooler weather - walkable. The service mirrored the standard of accommodation - excellent. We will be back many times.,5,2018,08,31
48,GREAT PLACE TO STAY,"LOCATION, APARTMENT AND STAFF WHERE GREAT! 

It is super central and right on ramblas.

ensure to get eating recommendations from the staff, they are on point. 

only issue we had was that the pressure and heat in the shower was not good. 
And the air conditioning coolest temperature did not cool the apartment at all.",4,2018,08,30
48,Fab luxuary appartment,"Great stay, very clean, large and well maintained apartments. Staff were brilliant helping organise activities. Good location about half hour walk from La Rambles and lots of shops and restaurants near by, would definitely recommend.",5,2018,08,29
48,The perfect accommodation in Barcelona ,"We were so fortunate to spend 6 nights at the Casagrand in Barcelona.
We booked a 5 bedroom suite and had room to spare. Located in a very central area with some of the city’s best restaurants within an easy walk. The apartment is very quiet and the beds are comfortable which made sleeping easy. The roof top pool is a beautiful oasis. The photos capture the true elegance of the apartment. You will not be disappointed! The staff are professional and very friendly and available 24hrs. We will be back! Heather and Bob",5,2018,08,28
48,Casagrand Luxury Suites is Incredible!,"Casagrand is a BEAUTIFUL apartment and is a perfect place to stay with a large group!  We had a 4 bedroom/4bath suite (Summum suite) for our group of 5 adults and 2 children. In our 5th floor apt., there was actually a 5th bedroom which had been converted from a former den/study.  Three of the bedrooms have ensuite bathrooms, two with showers and tubs, and the 4th bedroom has a bath with shower off the hall. The master bedroom is particularly large with a king bed, a dressing area, a balcony with table/chairs, and a separate sitting area. The kitchen has everything needed for cooking and offers new appliances. There were two large couches in the living room and a large dining table. There is a laundry room with a full size washer and dryer as well as an ironing board. The rooftop deck with long, narrow wading pool is good for children. I would recommend more umbrellas for shade when watching children in the pool.

The location is in the quieter Eixample area of Barcelona, with fewer people than the Las Ramblas area. Many upscale shops are located here as well as excellent restaurants and nearby grocery stores.  It was easy to walk to major tourist sites and also convenient to the subway which is remarkably clean. 
 
The front desk is staffed 24/7 and they are very responsive to any problems or questions. Upon arrival, the staff supplies a bottle of Cava and a sweet cake as well as juice, milk and coffee. Delivery of filtered water occurs as often as needed. A problem with air conditioning was promptly addressed and repaired. There is a very competent daily housekeeping service and the toiletries are replaced daily. Computer keys are left at the desk when departing and obtained on return which is a good system for not losing them. 

Thank you to Xavi, Sasha, and Marta for their friendly help on a daily basis and suggestions for good restaurants in the area. If you are traveling to Barcelona with a group that requires multiple bedrooms/baths and enjoys a huge space and gathering in a common living area, this is the PERFECT place for you!!",5,2018,08,24
48,Perfect luxury experience in Barcelona,"The best experience that we have all had in Barcelona.  Casagrand (Summum Suite) exceeded our expectations and delivered what we desired for a perfect holiday - great service (yet discreet) from front of house to housekeeping in a fab location.

Highlights included: centrally located but not right in the touristy section; walkable distance to great restaurants/cafes/shops; nice big rooms and lots of space; very clean and great wifi connection; rooftop dipping pool; a training room (small fitness room); most importantly, a team of fantastic front of house and housekeeping staff members.

Keep up the great service and we will see you next time!",5,2018,08,22
48,Gorgeous apartments,"Absolutely LOVED staying at Casagrand. Everything about it was fabulous. It was spacious and beautifully decorated with all mod cons. 
The beds and bedding were super comfortable- I didn’t want to get out of bed in the morning!
The only thing I would say is the plunge pool is only suitable for a quick splash. You can’t swim in it as it is narrow and shallow. 
Fantastic location. 
Helpful welcoming staff.
I would definitely return.",5,2018,08,21
48,Perfect and roomy in a great neighborhood,"Arrival and transfer all went very smoothly.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  The rooftop deck was very nice and comfortable with a pool, chairs and tables and complimentary beverages. 

Location:  perfect.  I have no interest in staying on the Rambla - just like if I went to new york city I would not want to stay in the middle of Time Square.  Let me put it this way, if you go to NYC and you want to stay in time square, do not stay here, stay on La Rambla.  If you go to NYC and you stay in the village or soho or tribeca, then this is the place for you.  You are close to everything but you do not have to walk out of your hotel to face 1,000 people selling tourist trinkets.  Also, the restaurants in this neighborhood are way better than in the tourist trap areas. 

Apartment:  Stellar.  We had a four bedroom with 3 bathrooms, kitchen, living room and balconies overlooking the avenue.  The finishes are top notch, the apartment is new, the beds are excellent and the linens are high end.  The apartment was also huge.  The only drawback I would say is that the subway line runs not far away and so at night you could ever an ever so faint hum of the subway.  However, as the night progresses, very few trains run and its very low anyway so it was not troubling to me.  Also, the apartment had a laundry room with american style washer AND dryer.  It was great compared to what I have gotten at other European apartments and homes.  

Service:  super-friendly and very helpful.   Keep in mind that this is an apartment-hotel.  So, you do get real service - front desk is always staffed.  They were happy to book restaurants and do other things for us as well.  It does not quite have the busy feel of a major hotel, but I think there are only 10 or 12 apartments in the entire building so they really spend time trying to help you when you ask for something.   

Overall, I cannot say enough about Casagrand.  It was a five-star experience.  Do not hesitate to book if you need the room.",5,2018,08,19
48,Excellent Location; Über Luxurious place,"Casagrand Luxury Suites lives up to its reputation. It was the highlight of our 10 day tour of Spain. We stayed in a 4 bedroom 3 Bathroom + Living Room + Kitchen + Utility (with washer dryer) apartment. 
Apartment was like an upscale, modern place you would find in say Manhattan but really spacious and clean. The master bedroom was huge. There was a Junior suite with attached bathroom and 2 other rooms with a common bathroom in the hallway. The kitchen was well equipped and had everything including stove, microwave, kettle and a dishwasher. The washer dryer facility was a life saver.  They had an ironing board+iron as well.
Service: Super! Sasha at the front desk was amazing and very efficient. All the other staff were also very helpful. 

Location: The location is one of the highlights of this place. It is CLOSE to everything but away from the din. It is walking distance from both Las Ramblas and the Shopping street (forget the name). Plaza de Catalunya is a bit far but you could hop on to the metro from the Diagonal station that is 5 min from Casagrand. We took the metro to La Boqueria (the market). That area is dotted with eateries but the staff recommended a deli/restaurant type of place called Bopan. There’s a Cafe au Te and a McDonald’s right next door in case you need a quick bite.

Amenities: We didn’t spend much time at the hotel so we didn’t use the gym. The pool area is nice but it gets hot in the mornings. The pool is rather small. It is mainly a nice place to sit and enjoy a brew/drink. 
They provided free drinking water, tea/coffee. Bathrooms were really clean and well stocked with high quality toiletries / hair dryer etc
Overall: Superb and would highly recommend...",5,2018,08,19
48,Best place to stay with kids,"What a lovely, modern, huge apartment! Fab location and great splash pool for kids (the only thing that got us through the hot touring days). We also loved the tablet with all the movies and tv shows for adults and kids alike! Lots of supermarkets nearby too. Can’t recommend this place enough... wonderful wonderful wonderful!",5,2018,08,09
48,City break,"Exceptional, after a week around a pool relaxing our family of 7 wanted to experience a city break. The 4 nights spent at th Casagrand are the highlight of a memorable holiday.

We stayed in a 4 bed premier, truly fantastic facilities, concierge and welcome. The apartment itself was spacious and of a very high standard. The soft drinks waiting in the fridge after days out were really appreciated as was the advice and guidance from the staff. The beds were something to look forward to after long waking days, as was the roof top pool.

Thank you so much to all of the team, we will be back.",5,2018,08,07
48,Special place from which to enjoy Barcelona,"Casa Grand was the perfect place for us to stay for a week while vacationing in Barcelona. We rented a four bedroom, three bathroom apartment which was perfect for the seven people in our party. Loved that there are two master suites. The apartment is beautifully updated throughout and very comfortable. It's a great location in the city with easy access to public transportation and lots of popular Barcelona sites. The terrace is especially lovely and a dip in the wading pool was a nice way to cool off in the evening. Service is exceptional and the staff is very friendly. Highly recommend Casa Grand.",5,2018,08,06
48,If I could give this excellent choice a 4.5 I would but I rounded up!,"Booked here after recommendation from my travel agent in the states.  While it is an expensive option for a large family, it surpassed the value of putting several rooms together in a 5 star hotel.  The apartment that we rented for the week was exceptional. Modern, clean, stylish - very much like a New York Soho apartment with a European flair.  The location on the Avenue Diagonal was perfect - access to excellent restaurants within walking distance, very close to a metro station, and of course great shopping and cafe options on pedestrian walk ways like La Ramba.  The breakfast, for an extra charge and delivered to the room, was excellent.  The check in and check out process was super easy at this apartment hotel with staff happy to help in every way.  The only reasons I would take a half star from their review for a 4.5 were 1) a pool area that is not at all comfortable and without adequate shading on super hot summer days (the pics on the website make this pool area look far bigger than it was) and 2) the gym was undersized and not well equipped.  Other than those two minor dings, this is an excellent way to live apartment style in one of the world's greatest cities.",5,2018,08,03
48,Late night arrival to a Friendly Face!,"CasaGrand Suites is an beautiful place, Great Location, and super friendly staff. 
We arrived at 3:30am in the morning and Cristiano greeted us with a friendly smile and helping hand.  We were a family of 8 and it was perfect! We rented to 4 bedroom 3 bath suite with all king beds on the 4th floor! My nephew loved them roof top pool. 

Love the kitchen, living room, and balcony off the living room over looking the city. 
Washer and Dryer available was perfect since we stayed here during our 2 week trip! We did several loads of laundry.  

Great location with lots of shopping and eating places close by! We would stay here again when we return to Barcelona!",5,2018,07,30
48,Beautiful Apartment! Great location! Amazing Service!,"We rented the 4 bedroom 4 ba apartment for our family of 6 and it was perfect! The location was great- tons of shopping/ restaurants close by...The apartment was gorgeous- completely remodeled, spacious and comfortable. The staff was incredibly thoughtful and warm... The perfect getaway in Barcelona...we will definitely be back!",5,2018,07,24
48,Weekend Men’s Trip,"Absolutely superb clean and modern luxury apartments. We were 9 in the group. Booked by my son. 

Facilities are excellent. Location central to all attractions. 

The receptionist Sasha is fantastic. She really went above the call of duty to look after us. 

Will book again for sure.

48,Beautiful and spacious!,"We were so impressed with our apartment.  We are a family of seven and there was more than enough room for us all and beds for everyone, which would have been enough given how small hotels are, but it was also beautifully appointed.  Loved it!",5,2018,07,19
48,Our lifeline to exploring Barcelona!,"This is luxurious and spacious accommodation with all amenities close to public transport.  We really appreciated the laundry facilities as we had three children in our group.  But even our adult clothes were drenched with perspiration from our daily outings and it was so welcome to be able to wash and dry them.  The staff were a fount of information on what to do and how to get to the destinations and we explored far and wide. And on our last day they held our luggage until we had to leave for the airport.  We were a group of seven and each had enough elbow room not to bother each other.  We enjoyed the paddling pool on the roof and even made use of the gym!  We were also spoilt with the lemon pound cake and champagne and complimentary bottles of water.  The kitchen is a dream with an oven, dishwasher, big fridge and touch hob.  Three TV's accommodated all interests and three bathrooms allowed for no queues.",5,2018,07,16
48,High End Apartment,"I was meeting my cousins for the first time in 5 years, and they loved the place! Everything is high quality and brand new.  The service and location are both excellent. The rooftop terrace is also beautiful, but I think they should add lights to it during night time.",5,2018,07,13
48,Our best visit to Bacalona!!!!,"Our family of eight stayed in a fantastic four bedroom apartment.  We had 5 adults and 3 children and we were all very comfortable in this spacious apartment.  The staff went out of their way to make our stay the best by giving detailed information on surrounding attractions and helping us use the local Metro system.  The champagne and lemon pound cake on the first day was a complete surprise.  The beds were soft and comfortable and the apartment was very quiet!  Local shopping and restaurants are in close proximity, best location and easy access to the Metro. We plan to return in the future and will stay with Casagrand again.  Our highest recommendation possible, thank you!!!",5,2018,07,11
48,Omg - amazing!,"I was part of a small hen party and we stayed in a beautiful 4-bed apartment at Casagrand Luxury Suites. 

All I can say is AMAZING. 

Huge apartment with fantastic facilities including fully equipped kitchen, comfortable lounge and dining area, the softest bed linen and Molton Brown toiletries. We even had small balconies around the entire apartment (ours was on a corner). 

There was even a separate doorway to a staircase and lift that took us up to the sauna and rooftop pool area. Free soft drinks were available on the roof, as well as towels and such comfortable sun loungers - just perfect. 

The apartments are in a good location and aren’t too far from the shops and restaurants. 

Staff were very friendly and helpful too. 

Highly recommended! I will definitely stay here again when I return to Barcelona.",5,2018,07,10
48,Will be back !,"The name of the Hotel says it all, but it was more than we expected ! The staff, the Apartment, the surroundings were excellent ! We were so delighted, and all 7 of the family group really enjoyed the stay. The 4 bedroom suite was very well equipped, clean, etc.. My husband and I live in Spain, and we will definitely stay at Casagrand the next time we visit Barcelona. And we will absolutely recommend this wonderful Place",5,2018,07,08
48,Completely blown away!,"Stayed here as a group of 8 ladies gor 2 nights and had an absolutely fabulous stay. From the arrival welcome right through to our departure,everything was perfect and nothing was too much trouble for the staff. We were shown to our apartment and given clear instructions on how everything worked.
We stayed in room 2 on the second floor, which had 4 immaculate bedrooms with the best pillows I've ever encountered in any hotel. Luxury bathrobes and slippers were also provided in each room, along with a selection of good quality towels.The 3 bathrooms were spacious and again immaculately clean with a good selection of toiletries and a hairdryer. 
The living area was large and modern and the kitchen housed everything we could have needed for our stay. Bottled water was also provided daily which was another unexpected bonus, as was the fresh cake provided. 
The roof terrace was another plus point. It was great to be able to relax up there, soaking up the sun and appreciating the beautiful views whilst helping ourselves to the complimentary soft drinks fridge. Another unexpected but very welcome extra touch. 
The apartment is in a good location. 15-20 minutes walk to Ramblas but also has a selection of restaurants, shops and supermarkets within a few minutes walk. 
I would definitely recommend this apartment and we all can't wait to return.",5,2018,07,03
48,Awesome place,"The luxury apartment is truly luxury.  The staff was awesome and the apartment has many amenities, was clean and much larger than anticipated.  If we go back to Barcelona in the future we will definitely stay here.",5,2018,06,23
48,4 wonderful days at Casagrand,"We rented the 4 br suite, it has 2 master suites with bathroom ( shower and tub) 2 other br share a bath.  Beautifully decorated, nice balcony off the living room. kitchen is accommodating. Clothes washer and dryer came in handy.  We arrived on an early morning flight , we were able to drop off our luggage without any problems. The front desk clerk was friendly and made us feel welcomed. When we came back after 4 pm , or luggage was already in our apartment. We received maps of Barcelona along with metro info and restaurant suggestions from the receptionist.  All 7 of us loved the apartment and enjoyed our stay there.  Plenty of cafes and restaurants within minutes of walking distance from the apartment. highly recommend this place. The rooftop lounging area is great.  Thanks to everyone at Casagrand for making our stay in Barcelona memorable.",5,2018,06,20
48,Best apartments anywhere in the world,"Casagrand must be the best apartments I've ever stayed in anywhere in the world. Excellent location in a dynamic, upscale part of town but still within short walking distance to the main sights. The apartment (2-2) itself was huge. We were 7 in all and there was plenty of rooms and bathrooms for all of us. The beds were comfortable, the kitchen and bathrooms well appointed, and the ambience was truly elegant. Casagrand made for a great start to our 2 week Spain vacation. We received a lot of help and good conversation from the staff -- they really go the extra mile to give hands on service, something that travelers like me and my family always look for abroad. For the price, the total experience was definitely worth it. I would never hesitate to stay at Casagrand if we ever get to visit Barcelona again!",5,2018,06,20
48,Fantastic apartment in the heart of Barcelona,"We stayed as a group of 8 in one apartment and had an amazing time. The space is beautiful - and so large! The staff were wonderfully helpful, considerate and helped organise something for our guest of honour as a surprise. The apartment is clean and wonderfully equipped, we didn't want to leave! Would recommend highly.",5,2018,06,13
48,Wow wow wow wow wow ,"Stayed as a group of 15 in two apartments. We were blown away. Luxury and very high quality.  4 bedrooms 3 bathrooms all to very high spec. 
Also loved the kitchen area and large living area. 
The roof top pool area is lovely and we spent a lot of.time here. Complimentary soft drinks in a mini fridge which was a nice touch. 

As a group of 15 we felt we were treated with respect and the service we experienced was top class. The staff always go the extra mile and this was refreshing.  They really care about their reputation and ensuring the highest standards. I know they have a smaller apartment but if you are a group then this is the perfect place. 
Thanks again
",5,2018,06,10
48,Wonderful apartment in the heart of Barcelona City!,The entire apartment was very well cared for. The location is excellent and the service outstanding. They even arranged for a Chef to cook a paella for our family and friends.  We had a great time and we're planning to go back next year !,5,2018,05,31
48,Gorgeous apartment! Fantastic mini break in Barcelona,"We absolutely loved our stay here, Very central location, very clean and very spacious apartment. Lovely decoration and very comfortable  beds/furniture!  It had all the amenities that we would need. The pool area was very nice but we did not use it as we visited in October. The reception team were very polite and helpful too. Would absolutely stay again! (tiny downside, you cannot escape the noise from the main road, so if you are a light sleeper...be aware!)",5,2018,05,17
48,Nice and big appartment,Very nice stay in this beautifull appartment. The appartment was at a good location everything was close. The sauna and the pool where beautifull. We definetly will come back again thanks everything..,5,2018,05,07
48,Perfect stay !,"Perfect appartment for a 6 adults familly with 2 young kids.
The staff are awesome et really kind.
The appartment is really clean and well equiped (dryer,oven,microwave,washers...). Cleaning everyday when you want, so really simple.
Not so far from the town center (place Catalunya/ la rambla 15min walk or 4€ with a cab).
We had a great stay and thank you to casagrand.",5,2018,04,19
48,5 Stars All Around!,"Casagrand Luxury Suites met and exceeded all of my expectations! I’d give it a 5 stars (more if I could) for accommodations, location, and staff.

Accommodations - What you see on the hotel pictures is exactly what I got. I booked a 4 bedroom 3 bathroom suite for 6 days. My family (2 adults, 1 child), my sister’s family (3 adults), and mom stayed together. The suite was so spacious for all of us and it never felt too tight. The quality of the furniture, fixtures, cabinets, plates, appliances, cutlery, etc were top notch! I have stayed at other suites for other travels and I have never seen such high-end quality stuff for a hotel.

Additionally, when I had booked my stay through the hotel, they provided a free one-way transfer from the airport for my family. This made it easy and made the welcome into Barcelona that much more stress free! Note that the hotel does not provide free transfer back to the airport. However, taking a taxi to the airport was only about 40 Euros.

Location - I loved the location of our hotel. Everything was close by and within walking distance. It was less than a 30 minute walk to Sagrada de Familia, less than 30 minutes walk to Plaça Catalunya where most tour buses depart from, and we even managed to walk back to Casagrand from Park Guell. Note that we had my 6-year old and mom in her 60’s walking with us, so it may even be faster for those who aren’t traveling with kids or elderly folks. Food options are abundant in the area and Passeig de Garcia for shopping is about two blocks away.

Staff - Casagrand Staff were all very welcoming, professional, and helpful. From arranging our airport transfer before arriving to Barcelona, providing really good food recommendations, and just overall top notch service - they truly made our stay so much more pleasant!

Lastly, when I was researching accommodations, I was debating between booking hotels or Airbnb. I hesitated with the Airbnb because of nightmare experiences I’ve heard from friends. When I saw Casagrand Luxury Suites, it was a hybrid of the two and am so glad that I stayed with them. Don’t hesitate, book your stay now!",5,2018,04,04
48,Beautiful - spacious and exceeded all expectations and some!!,"Family of 6 - amazing place, beautiful, spacious and A1 quality.
service by Casagrand is so amazing from point of contact in NZ before trip to when staying there - just amazing. Highlight of our world trip. Just sensational place to stay.",5,2018,04,04
48,"Flawless, from beginning to end.","This 4 bedroom, 4 bath apartment was in THE perfect location, and gave the 7 of us plenty of room to be very comfortable. You will be impressed with the modern, clean decor, and the size of the unit. Pictures truly do not do the space justice. Also, you will find the staff to be very helpful, friendly and accommodating. 

We had a chef come and cook for us, and he commented that the kitchen was well-stocked to prepare a complicated meal. 

If I ever found myself in Barcelona again, I would look forward to a stay at Casagrand.",5,2018,03,23
48,"Great, great, great","Five stars all the way around from the accommodations to the staff to the location. Do not think twice about booking an apartment at Case Grand. Really fabulous. Plenty of room, great beds, first class facility.",5,2018,03,20
48,Amazing Stay----Best Ever!!!,"The Casagrande is not just an AirBnB, it is a truly one of a kind place that combines the value and spaciousness you would expect from an AirBnB with the finest luxuries you expect from the finest hotel! From the minute you walk into the beautiful lobby in one of the most special parts of Barcelona, you realize what a special place this is.....the staff is amazing and makes you feel like family! When you enter the apartment your first impression will most likely be “is this truly all ours?”....... you look to the right and there is a long hallway with four beautifully appointed bedrooms with private baths. To the left is a spacious kitchen, living room, dining area and even an office. There are amenities that you would expect in a fine hotel, but are a surprise and delight at an Air BnB....... Molton Brown toiletries, Nespresso coffee, fluffy bathrobes, large towels......nothing is spared and it is easy to get spoiled! Also, at check-in you are given an iPad that has room service, concierge services and even Netflix! Four couples could easily stay here and have complete privacy and never get in each other’s way.....also perfect for a family! The only caution is staying here will ruin you for staying in other AirBnBs because the Casagrand is a magical blend of the finest hotel and a luxurious home with a staff waiting to attend to your every need! Stay at the Casagrande......for the chance to experience this beautiful property firsthand!",5,2018,03,09
48,Fantastic Stay!,Gorgeous Apartment! Exceeded everyones expectations!  This is place is deserving of all the 5 Star reviews.  No need to look any further.  We had a wonderful time in Barcelona. This is the perfect place to begin and end everyday of your trip.   Enjoy!,5,2018,03,04
48,Amazing little secret in Barcelona,"These brand new apartments are amazing. The staff is great. Scrap Airbnb on BCN, this is the place to go! Huge (2200+ sqft), 4 bedroom, kitchen, dining room, and cleaning servicr daily! Hard to find such a great deal. The penthouse is a 1 bedroom 2 bathroom beauty as well, smaller but with a huge terrace overlooking Av. Diagonal. Centrally located, steps from the metro, tram and train, 2 blocks from Paseo de Gracia and minutes from Plaza Catalunya. Amazing.",5,2018,03,01
48,Great Apartment!,"This apartment lived up to all our expectations and more! It's a spacious apartment that is furnished beautifully. It's clean and well looked after and features large bedrooms, bathrooms, full sized kitchen, living and dining rooms. They offer free wifi and an iPad equipped with netflix that can be linked to the TV in the apartment. There is also staff at the front desk 24 hours a day to assist if needed. 

The apartment is in a central location, close to the metro, Casa Mila, Casa Batllo, and great shopping. Additionally the front desk staff were always helpful and eager to offer recommendations for restaurants, sights, etc.  

We all remarked that the apartment was one of our highlights of the whole trip!! We all would definitely stay there again and look forward to another visit in the future.",5,2018,01,30
48,The best,"One of the most luxurious apartments I have ever lived in Europe, my expectations exceeded an excellent location and cleanliness, as well as the good treatment of employees and their keenness to meet all our needs",5,2018,01,21
48,Absolutely loved this apartment,"I honestly cannot say enough nice things about this place.  We had six adults and two small children (1 and 3) and all loved these apartments.  They were spacious, exceptionally clean, beautifully maintained and furnished, and wonderfully welcoming.  The laundry facilities were also excellent and came in handy.  Great location - close to lots of things. Our return flight was cancelled and we had to find somewhere to stay for two days at the end of the trip and we actually chose to return to these apartments for a second time too!  The customer service was exceptional as well.",5,2018,01,18
48,Just great!,"All good, very satisfied with apartment, location, services, etc. We stayed for one week and everything worked out really well with Casagrand. The staff was really nice, the apartment itself very well conceived and decorated, and the location is just great for walking to the main places in BCN.",5,2018,01,16
48,Amazing experience,"The time I spent in Casagrand was by far the best experience I've had away from my place. Despite its magnificent surroundings, with a surprising yet welcoming decoration, I felt like home. No doubt, I will come back, that's for sure.",5,2017,12,22
48,Nice suites,"4-br suite was huge and well-maintained, came with study room, fully-equipped kitchen, dinning & living room. There was also a laundry room.  Three of the bedroom has en-suite bathroom, there was one standalone bathroom next to the bedroom without en-suite bathroom.

Location was centralized and surrounded by shops (mostly home furnishing). Walking to La Pedrera and Casa Batllo was between 7-10 mins.",5,2017,12,17
48,Weekend sightseeing,"Really excellent accommodation and service. Very clean, modern but still comfortable suites- incredibly close to the centre of town, about 5 minutes walk from the ‘Diagonal’ metro station and 10 minutes from the Gaudi house. Helpful staff, small but nice gym (24hrs)plunge pool does the job, roof terrace very elegant, sauna great ( only open between 18:00-21:00). Beds were very large and comfortable.

Plenty of bottled water provided every day. 
A really comfortable stay and perfect for families who want the elegance of a good hotel but the privacy and space of a flat.
Excellent- can thoroughly recommend.",5,2017,11,27
48,Excellent Stay in Barcelona,"We just returned from a trip to Barcelona with our four kids, 17 and older.  Our apartment with 4 bedrooms, 4 baths, beautiful dining and living area, and fabulous kitchen exceeded our expectations. With a reception desk that is staffed 24/7, a beautiful roof top terrace with pool and sauna, laundry room in the apartment,this place offered all that we needed to make this our home away from home.  After full days of taking in the sights of Barcelona, we looked forward to relaxing in the beauty and comfort of this place. The location is perfect, too!",5,2017,11,27
48,The most amazing/comfortable suites you can imagine!,"After working in Barcelona with a few colleagues we decided to book a suite at Casagrand for the long weekend and we couldn't be more happier upon arrival.

The whole apartment is completely renovated and looks amazing to say the least. There was not a single thing to complaint about, they have put thought in every single detail.

Every room had it's own bathroom and 2 of them also had a bath tube. The bathrooms were great! The beds even better, most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. My room had a long balcony with an amazing view of the city and the mountains. The location was great as it was on a main street and everything was close by. The roof terrace with swimming pool and sauna was very nice as well. 

The people working in the building were very nice and considerate. If I would go back to Barcelona, I would definitely go back to this place.",5,2017,11,20
48,An amazing place to stay,I have stayed 3 nights in this amazing apartment. At the top floor. It is well equipped with everything you need to have a great stay. All kitchen appliances and utensils have a great style. Breakfast was very rich and was fun to have it on the terrace. Will definitely book all my next stays in the city here. ,5,2017,11,16
48,Wow - Exceeded Expectations! - TOP NOTCH,"From the moment we walked in we knew this we chose the right apartment to stay in. Very friendly staff. The Penthouse 1 bedroom apartment  was perfect for my wife and I, our 2 year old son, and a friend of ours traveling with us. The private roof top terrace is amazing, you have access right outside the apartment. The pool is on the same floor, just through the main entrance in the hallway. The beds, linens, pillows, etc were so comfortable. A/C throughout the apartment. Amazing views from the top. The apartment has a full kitchen - anything you need. Small market 5 mins walk away - Metro only 5-7 mins away so you have full access to the city. There is everything you need at your fingertips. Daily housekeeping did an amazing job. Concierge is downstairs and they will answer any question. Thank you Casagrand you made our Barcelona trip very special. See you soon!",5,2017,10,22
48,Perfect in every way,"Just checked out from the four bedroom flat. It was huge, extremely luxurious, amenities were awesome, 24 hour reception, location was great and excellent service. Literally nothing could have been better.",5,2017,10,11
48,This is a 10-star experience!,"We were a family of 4 couples traveling in Portugal and Spain for a couple of weeks and by far our stay at Casagrand was the highlight of the trip. The building's location is perfectly situated for exploring one of the city's most beautiful neighborhoods on foot. The design and size of the apartment far exceeded our expectations. This is a massive apartment designed and furnished with impeccable style. And the service we experienced from everyone onsite was warm, friendly and always accommodating. These apartments are a tremendous value, and I am already scheming how I can get another group together to visit Barcelona, in part just to call this chic and charming place my temporary home again.",5,2017,09,25
48,An excellent stay in an excellent city! ,"Everything about Casagrand luxury suites was amazing.  We stayed in their 4 bedroom suite and couldn’t have asked for a better place! The beds were very comfortable, and the bathrooms were great and the living area and kitchen were well furnished and met all of our needs.  We also had 3 kids on this visit and the space in the apartment was great for them! The staff in the building are extremely helpful as well.  I look forward to staying here again on my next visit! ",5,2017,09,23
48,Fantastic accommodation in great location,"The hotel was beautifully appointed. Everything was new and well done. Staff were friendly, helpful, and professional. The location is great - quiet but close to main sites in a neighbourhood with upscale shopping.",5,2017,09,15
48,Outstanding,"I've just spent the most memorable weekend in Barcelona, thanks to CasaGrand. 

Their apartments are more like penthouses, and designed and decorated to an exceptionally high standard. 

They have thought of everything from brand new hairdryers and straightners in the bathrooms to welcoming Cava and Lemon cake. 

We were also highly impressed by the dedicated service of all of the Casagrand staff, but most notably Orlando and Guilliame.

Thank you again for a perfect weekend. I wouldn't dream of staying anywhere else in Barcelona now.... and I continue to dream of CasaGrand!",5,2017,09,12
48,Exceptional Accommodation in the Heart of Barcelona ,"We stayed here recently for a friends Hen Party. Can't recommend this place enough!! The experience was fantastic from beginning to end. We stayed in the 4 bedroom, 4 bathroom luxury apartment. The apartment was really spacious, decorated to an incredibly high standard, with big comfy beds, smart TVs in every room and bathrooms stocked with lovely Molton Brown toiletries. The owners have really thought about every detail. We even had our own iPad and office (handy if you're staying for business) The kitchen was fully equipped with everything you could ever need, including dishwasher, Nespresso machine and all the usual kitchen related items. The rooftop pool was absolutely gorgeous.  Everything was kept really clean and they even delivered fresh flowers to us one of the days. Really helpful staff who could not have done enough for us- They were great, especially Guillaume and Orlando who helped us several times with whatever we needed. Depending on the number of guests, the place really offers great value for money. We will definitely be coming back again & recommending to everyone we know ❤️",5,2017,09,11
48,Highly recommended to those with discerning tastes. ,"I could not have been happier with my decision to stay at Casagrand. The location is, in my opinion, the best in Barcelona - chic neighborhood with beautiful architecture, great shops and restaurants all while being convenient to the tourist destination without actually being in those areas. The property itself is stunning. A beautiful historic building recently renovated with contemporary, luxurious finishes. It's the perfect balance of old world with new. The apartment itself was gorgeous. The perfect space for a couple with high end finishes, furnishings, and linens. I'm super picky about those things and my expectations were exceeded. The bed was luxurious and oh so comfortable.  We stayed on the top floor apartment which had its own private roof terrace. This unit is a one bedroom and is the perfect size for a couple. How delightful to relax out on the terrace with coffee taking in the views of the city. And the service was outstanding. Everyone was so welcoming,  pleasant, and helpful. I highly recommend staying at the Casagrand Luxury Suites and will definitely be staying there again during my next visit to Barcelona. ",5,2017,09,08
48,5 star - this place is truly awesome,"We stayed here for a family holiday with the ages ranging from 75 to 21 years old. This place was truly awesome. The apartment was even better than the photos which doesn't happen very often. The layout was perfect, everyone had their own space and privacy. The lounge area was perfectly fitted with lost of seating and dining space. Our Juliette balcony overlooked the avenue and was so adorable. The kitchen was fully equipped with plenty of cutlery, crockery, glass wear and pots & pans. There was even a Nespresso machine! Beds were like sleeping on a cloud, best nights sleep I've had in ages. The cleaners came in every day and made the place look spotless just as it was when we first arrived. The rooftop terrace is a lovely escape from the hustle and bustle of the busy streets. Something to note the pool is more for wading rather than swimming as it only comes up to mid thigh but perfect to cool down in. The reception staff were wonderful, very helpful with restaurant recommendations and places to go. They all spoke excellent English and were very friendly and approachable. 

Diagonal is a great location. It is great for restaurants and the clothes shopping in this area is fantastic. You are far enough away from Las Ramblas to have a bit of peace, but close enough that you are in the heart of it within 3 metro stops or a 10/15min walk. I really loved my stay here and would definitely book this accommodation again without a second thought. Bravo!

",5,2017,09,06
48,Great modern apartment!!,"These apartments have a great location and easy walking access to many attractions.  The staff gave us top personal, first-class treatment and handled any issues we had with ease.
We were six people and had a four bedroom unit which was wonderful and spacious!
Would definitely stay there again!!",5,2017,09,04
48,Barcelona highlights - Aug17,"The apartments at Casagrand are beautifully appointed, very spacious and in a fabulously central location.  We were unlucky in that the Barcelona attack happened on day 2 of our holiday, however the staff were extremely helpful and very reassuring during a difficult time.  

The apartments appear to be expensive, but if you can make use of the maximum occupancy (8 people) they present tremendous value for money vs a hotel.

I would definitely go back",5,2017,08,30
48,Perfect,"Nothing more than Perfect ! We enjoyed Our trip in Barcelona.  Everything was  really perfect...
It was well located.The personal very efficient. The apartment was very big and very clean. They have anticipate all our needs because nothing was missing...
We hope we could go again to casagrand...",5,2017,08,30
48,Absolutely terrific place to stay for what we needed,"We were 2 families 4 adults and 4 children. This was the best option for us. It turned out to be one of the less expensive as well. Accommodations were great. Apartment was excellent. A few minor things which I suspect you can request and they would be fixed depending on your needs. We ran out of regular coffee on the second day and it was not replace. When we asked for more they did bring 4 more capsules, but they were decaf. We asked for more from the cleaning crew and even though they supposedly went to get some we never got any more. Water was provided every day. Very clean and very comfortable. Location is great as well. Price wise according to my wife it was the best thing we could find in Barcelona for 8 people.",5,2017,08,25
48,What un unpleasant surprise..,"First of all, the apartment is great. It's very luxurious and vast and the avenue it is on is truly beautiful. And because there are no compliments without buts... here's the but. Firstly we had a lot of trouble with the reception, they have a hard time understanding what you say and doing things the way you want them to be done.
Secondly, don't ask for last minute meals cause it's not possible. The room service isn't really room service since you have to warn them one day before.
Thirdly, in three nights we had no hot water at all and we had to beg and beg again for the water to be repaired. Plumbers and electricians going in and out day in day out even when everyone's in the house. Fourthly, if you're wifi addicted, don't rely on it: the electricity lags a lot like, we had four electricity break-downs!
Fifthly, hope you like it when it's chilly because it seems they like to put the air conditioner on high level all the time. So it's like freezing in the house.
Sixthly, they lack communication between one another, when one say yes the other say no..
Good part of the apartment and service: they are indeed always here and they try to help you as much as they can (if they manage to understand you). The appartement is beautiful and the beads are like heaven on earth! Apart from that, the apartment is great, they don't have much for kids -toys speaking- but they have TVs in Spanish so if you're not Spanish good luck with that -we're in Spain though so I guess it's normal. All in all, we've had a pleasant trip outside around the city going to the beach and gothic quarters or Las Ramblas. The Sagrada Familia is just priceless. On the outside the apartment seems just breathtaking indeed. But decoration doesn't make it all, though I have to say it's pretty impressive.",2,2017,08,11
48,Amazing place to stay!,"Casagrand is one of those extremely few cases in which the place where you stay becomes surprisingly more attractive and pleasurable than the place you are visiting, even if this is a city as beautiful as Barcelona. The reception and everyone working there makes you feel at home straight away, they are super helpful, and ever so kind. Then when you are up in your flat Gaudi can wait, you simply want to stay home and step once again into the fluffy white carpet, lay in bed for just a little bit more enjoying the touch of those sheets, hack around in the sofa looking at the flower arrangements on those exquisite vases, go up to the terrace for some sauna in this amazing dome before some drinks looking a the skyline. If you like cooking like me you will enjoy this kitchen with everything you may need (watch out with the knifes they are extra sharp). On the cons, the roof swimming pool is too small to properly swim.",5,2017,08,10
48,Fantastic Apartment,The apartment and its facilities are first class as is the service provided. All the staff were as helpful as one could wish for.  The roof-top terrace and pool were the icing on the cake.  5 minutes walk for the stops of the city tour buses too.  Several little bakeries nearby and a pharmacy next door.,5,2017,08,10
48,5 Star Stay in Barcelona,"We travel a lot and use many services such as Airbnb for our stays. This summer we toured Spain and stayed at five rental properties and one hotel (see my review for Dear Hotel Madrid Hotel. Given all of this travel over time and many rentals at places that were below or only met expectations, I can't remember a stay where everything was so accurately and well represented in the listing. This place met or exceeded our every expectation. This rarely happens. This place was fantastic for so many reasons: 

1. The people: the front desk, the housekeeping, and everyone that works in the building were all so helpful, friendly, professional and went out of their way at every turn to make us feel welcome. Superlative service. 

2. Building and location: The building was gorgeous, clean, well maintained, and distinctive architecturally. These are really spacious apartments in a hotel-like service setting. They had a fully staffed front desk, daily housekeeping, fully appointed apartments with modern kitchens, gym, pool on the roof deck (while small and shallow) that was set up in such a way that it was a vacation in itself to spend time on the deck with the deck chairs, umbrellas, outdoor shower and absolutely gorgeous views. The location, was perfect for us as it allowed us to walk to most major tourist destinations within 15-30 minutes but was outside the old town hustle and bustle (and touristy) nonsense. The neighborhood is very upscale with high-quality shops and restaurants everywhere. 

3. Apartment: The apartment itself was decorated, furnished, and kept in A+++ condition. No junk. Everything thoughtfully placed. New modern appliances. Every bedroom was spacious and a winner. Truly a home away from home (or even better) with every amenity one could ask for. If our own home was only as nice... Given all of this, I would highly recommend this place and it remains one of the few places that we would always come back to. A+",5,2017,07,15
48,More than you can ask for.,"We stayed for 6 night at the largest appartment, a family of 2+5 (2 of them are twin babies). The appertment is very spacious, well equipped with everything you need and is designed and decorated very tastefully in the highest modern stantards. The room is made every day and towels are replaces. The location is perfect for shopping and eating and also so as a base poit for traveling the city. Above all that we were extremely satisfyied with the recption desk: they are warm and wellcoming and will help you to get any service you need in the most efficiant way. We would like to mention our special appreciation and thanks to Mr. Albert Perez and Ms. Laura. 
Our first choice for families or for a long stay in Barcelona. 
Enjoy!

48,Disappointed ,"We were supposed to be the first customer, but they sent us the last minute cancellation and moved us to somewhere not closed by.  You should not have promoted if you're not ready to open!! My kids and friends were so looking forward to our first visit to Barcelona and our first staying with this brand new apartment! 
No compensation for cancellation at all!   Disappointed! ",1,2017,06,24

48,Einfach nur perfekt!,"Wir (2 Kids 1 und 3 Jahre alt, Eltern plus Grosi) haben zwei Wochen im Casarand verbracht. 
Das Summum Apartment ist so riesig, dass jedes Familienmitglied genügen Platz hat (und jeder sein eigenes Zimmer mit Bad!), sodass gemütliche Ferien ohne dass man sich (auch bei langen Ferien) in die Quere kommt vorprogrammiert sind. Das Babybett war aus Holz (nicht diese quitschenden Reisebetten), weshalb auch der kleinste gut geschlafen hat! 
Die Lage ist top, für den Preis kriegt man wirklich viel. Eine Familie mit dem nötigen Kleingeld (Restaurants und Shops sind hier eher hochpreisig) und gewissen Ansprüchen fühlt sich hier sehr wohl. 
Jeder Wunsch wurde von Personal sofort freundlich und unkompliziert erfüllt! Wir sind bereits das zweite Mal lange im Casagrand und werden ganz sicher wiederkommen! 
Es gibt einige Restaurants/Bars (Gatsby, Boca Grande) in Gehdistanz die einfach nur grossartig sind, sowohl kulinarisch wie vom Ambiente. 
Wenn man lieber zuHause bleiben will kann man im Bioladen um die Ecke wunderbar einkaufen und im grossen Tisch im Wohnzimmer essen, während die Kids den laaaaaangen Gang hin und her rennen können. 
Alles in allem Toptoptop!! wirklich, fast ein bisschen too good to be true :-)",5,2020,01,13

Das Gebäude verfügt über eine Sonnenterrasse mit Schwimmbad und Sauna, wo man über den Dächern von Barcelona entspannen kann. Zudem ist eine Sauna und ein modern ausgestatteter Fitnessraum vorhanden. Sehr empfehlenswert, wenn man eine spezielle Unterkunft sucht. Trotz zentraler Lage sind die Zimmer aufgrund guter Fenster und Isolierung absolut ruhig, wo man sich sehr gut erholen kann.",5,2017,08,05
