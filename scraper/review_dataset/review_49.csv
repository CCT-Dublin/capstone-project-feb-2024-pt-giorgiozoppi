49,Overall a good hotel and location - Minor issues need to be addressed,"Excellent hotel with good location. Walking distance to Sagrada Familia and many other places in the area. Rooms are decent size. Couple of minor issues-Antique switches for the lighting not very friendly and either switches off all the lights or turns all of them On which can be too bright with the Edison bulbs.  Secondly the corded phone seems to be a low quality one. When I made a few local calls, the other party complained they could hardly hear me. The volume at my end was also very low. 

Breakfast has good options but if they want to cater to international guests such as from the US, it would be helpful to have some rotating items such as pancakes, waffles, potatoes. This is much needed especially for vegetarians who cannot eat the meats and some of the cheeses and eggs.",4,2024,10,18
49,Wonderful Hotel,"Wonderful location in middle of everything. Beautiful / Clean newer hotel. Manager, reception and bartenders were all lovely and provided excellent service. Comfortable bed. Couldn‚Äôt ask for more. Very happy with our stay. Highly reccomended!!",5,2024,10,15
49,Fab Hotel,"Fab hotel, the rooms are spacious, modern clean and designed to a high standard. The whole hotel is very clean and luxurious with a modern twist and the staff are really friendly. Breakfast was really nice with a great selection on offer and all cooked well.",5,2024,10,12
49,Short and sweet stay at Seventy Barcelona,"We stayed at this beautiful hotel for 3 nights while in Barcelona, and we were absolutely impressed!  The chic, stylish, decor and thoughtfully designed spaces made it a joy to be there.  We especially loved the stunning rooftop pool and the inviting breakfast area, both of which added so much to our experience.  The motorized blackout shutters in the rooms were a major plus for a family dealing with jet lag!  Although our stay was short, it left a lasting impression on us.  We'll definitely back coming back here on our next trip.",5,2024,10,10
49,excellent,"good hotel, good food, strategic location, nice design, staff also very helpful, room size is good, the bed is very comfort. we had a good time there, highly recommended staying at seventy barcelona üëç",4,2024,10,09
49,Oasis in the Heart of Barcelona,"Incredibly helpful and friendly hotel staff.  Beautifully appointed rooms, comfortable beds.  Great bar and restaurant on site.  Wonderful amenities, and the spa was very relaxing.  We enjoyed the rooftop pool area and our veranda on our 1st floor room.  Easy walk to Sagrada Familia, Passeig de Gracia, Casa Battlo, etc.  Would definitely return on our next visit to Barcelona.",5,2024,10,07
49,Best sangria we ever had!,"We have been staying at Seventy Barcelona and did the cocktail masterclass with Carlos and he was fantastic! Very friendly, entertaining, we learnt a lot about sangria and also got to drink them!! Beat sangria we ever had. Thanks Carlos, would definitely sangria again!",5,2024,10,02
49,Hidden gem!,"Great stay for Barcelona. Exceptionally pleasant and helpful staff, great central location, excellent breakfast, and comfortable, spacious rooming. The best feature, unique to this hotel amidst a busy itinerary, was the bottom-less and constantly replenished tap of fresh orange juice. I'd come back just for the orange juice. Regardless of what hotel managements think, true OJ connoisseurs can always tell if it's artificial and these guys keep it au naturel. Highly recommended!",5,2024,10,01
49,Fantastic stay at Seventy Barcelona!,"Just arrived back in the UK following six wonderful days at the Seventy Barcelona. It was chic, spotless, inviting and extremely comfortable. The facilities, including the spa rooftop terrace/bar and pool were exceptional, as were the main bar and restaurant.
 Staff were friendly, professional and courteous, and you immediately felt that you had arrived somewhere special.
Aurelian, the bar manager and his staff - ensured that your cocktails were chilled and made to look amazing, in addition to tasting delicious.
All in all, a splendid place to stay and one that we will be revisiting and recommending to others.",5,2024,09,30
49,Design artistry.  High function.  Great rooftop.,"Seventy Barcelona is fabulous location close to the major Gaudi sites, nestled between Eixample and Garcia.  It  is a wonderful dynamic for a vacation or a business stay.  Design makes for a stunning first impression with numerous wow factors.  The use of space is brilliant. Large inviting tables dot the inner landscape as well as sleek but comfy sofas and chairs that define various areas of the wide open space. Lighting design, dramatic floor to ceiling bookcases, and a sweeping modern staircase elevate the feel.  Bar area has large plush booths as well as defined seating areas. It's not a foodie haven, but has a decent selection of dishes that are generally well prepared. The outside terrace amid olive trees is fabulous space. The rooftop has nice lap pool, good variety of lounge and seating and table spaces, and bar service.     Our ""skyroom"" had ample space and nice layout, but could have used a couple of discrete drawers for storage.  Experienced odor in the hallway of our sixth floor room every time we left it, probably an HVAC issue that needs to be sorted out.  We LOVED this hotel and will return on next trip to Barcelona.",5,2024,09,29
49,Wonderful stay,"Excellent hotel. Perfect location walking to La Sagrada Familia (15 minutes), La Pedrera (5 minutes), Casa Batllo (7 minutes), Piccaso Museum (30 minutes). Another choice is taking Taxi, the price is reasonable. It took us under 10 Euro to go to most of attractions. In case if you get up early in the morning due to jet lag, 365 Bakery next to the hotel opens at 6 AM. We had stayed here for five nights. Our room was quiet, and the bed was comfortable. The hotel is modern and clean. The design is artistic. At the first night, we had problem to lock the safe. In the morning of the next day, they replaced the safe in our room. The service was excellent. The people at the front desk were very friendly and helpful, particular Isbella and Gala. Whenever they see you passing by, they smile at you. Very good feeling. Really appreciate everybody working in the hotel, they made our vacation feeling at home away from the home.",5,2024,09,28
49,Lovely hotel in central Barcelona,"The hotel is lovely and centrally located in Barcelona. The room was spacious, comfortable, and well-decorated. The only downsides were the windows that don‚Äôt open and the small blue security lights that stay on all night. The breakfast was very rich and served in a beautiful setting.",4,2024,09,28
49,Great hotel bar,"Stayed here for 3 nights; fantastic hotel. One of the highlights was the cocktail bar, The Cors, where we served each njght by Aurelian. His cocktail making was superb, and his knowledge of the wines available was excellent. Each night he greeted us with a smile and a chat. A great place to sit and watch the world go by.",5,2024,09,25
49,Cocktails with Aurelian,"I went to a cocktail call with Aurelian and it was super fun! The products offered was great and Aurelian was super nice and fun during the class, I super recommend it! We made two cocktails, sprits style, the Hugo, and a second was a porn star martini, both super tasty!",5,2024,09,24
49,Excellent Stay,"Location: The hotel is in a great location with nearby shops, cafes, and restaurants. Short walk to the closest metro or bus stop. Doesn't get very noisy at night.

Facilities: I didn't use the spa, gym, or rooftop pool but I did take a look and they all seemed nice. It did rain one day and there were large umbrellas available for use in the lobby. The restaurant & bar were very chic and I loved the daily breakfast. I LOVED the gluten free options too! I read a previous review about the breakfast buffet being boring and unchanged every day but I thought it was delicious - you don't have to eat the same thing every day and they need to be able to produce a large spread for a large volume of people so very understandable. I went back for dinner and there was live music that night!

Room: The room was very spacious with nice features. I read previous reviews about the lighting but I didn't find the controls complicated at all - you just have to test which switch controls which light and remember it. The shutters open out to a little nook which I wasn't sure what the purpose was for, but they did a good job at blocking out the sun if you want to take a siesta. It had the usual hotel safe (definitely secure), robe, slippers, and coffee machine. The mini fridge is only for drinks for purchase - you cannot store food in there. The daily blue water bottle was a nice touch!

Bathroom: The open concept for the sink area was fine but I would imagine larger groups would want a door for extra privacy and to reduce noise. The amenities were nice and eco friendly, though the conditioner didn't really condition my hair. It actually made it rough to comb through. The only real downside was the water pressure for the shower and sink.

Staff: Everyone was very friendly and professional. They were ready to help and answer any questions. My flight arrived very early and I was able to check-in after a few hours so I could rest!",5,2024,09,23
49,70 Barecelona,The Hotel Seventy Barcelona lives up to high expectations. Great service from reception to the doorman to housekeeping. Special shout out to the brilliant Aurehian for the cocktail experience making red and white sangria. Was really awesome.,5,2024,09,23
49,Large hotel & nice size room,"Good location for Garcia area but likely too far, for the normal tourist.  Not an issue for us all, to be 35-40mins flat walk to la ramblas.
Good size rooms, even for the standard room & frequent promotions to <150  a night, making it comparatively reasonable.",4,2024,09,21
49,Take me back!,"Our experience started with a wonderful check in with Julieta, who kindly helped us find our location on the map and helped us sort bus tour tickets and gave us some recommendations for areas to visit/ lunch etc. Our ‚ÄòSeventy Room‚Äô was beautiful. Nice and cool, the style manages to feel both fresh and comfortable at the same time. Ainoah made us welcome with a coffee in the beautiful patio area. (which also serves a fab dinner we would highly recommend - probably our best in Barcelona!). Housekeeping was great and replaced our drinking water and towels daily. The pool area is a lovely space for relaxing after a busy morning sightseeing, and serves drinks and snacks. Surprisingly quiet most of the time but I guess people are out exploring a lot! I also had a wonderful massage from Sergei who made me feel very at ease. The spa pool offers yet another zen space in a busy city, and hotel guests get 30mins free every day. My favourite thing about this hotel was its atmosphere. The lobby area is busy and buzzy, the bar offers a great space with a fireplace to make guests feel at home, amazing live music on Saturday night. Lots of workspace areas to plug in if you need. Highly recommend la pepita and Abanic restaurants for incredible tapas experiences nearby.",5,2024,09,17
49,Pretty but not Functional,"We wanted to love this property, especially after having read so many great reviews. We visited end of August/beginning of September, so it was very hot and sunny (which we expected). What we didn‚Äôt expect was the subpar air conditioning (we‚Äôre talking almost no relief when walking in from outside). We understand that there are restrictions imposed by the EU, but the air was so bad that we actually popped into other hotels during our visit to see if their air conditioning was better and, to our dismay, it was EVERYWHERE else. Our room was stifling as well and when we walked into the hallway, it was like walking into a stuffy oven (and we heard other guests complaining as well; there‚Äôs no way you couldn‚Äôt notice it). We ended up setting up a little portable fan we had brought to make sleeping more comfortable, but the common areas, including the bar, offered very little relief from the heat. We have travelled to Europe many times at this time of year and have never experienced anything close to this.

As for the room itself, we were in a sky view room and it was very spacious, the bed was very comfortable, and the blinds really darkened the room.  The makeup mirror; however, was affixed to the large mirror over the sink, so there‚Äôs no way you‚Äôd be able to use it unless you‚Äôre very tall and can lean all the way over the sink to get close enough to see yourself. Additionally, the sink water pressure was nonexistent.  I had brought a converter for my hair tools, but both handles got so hot, I had to refrain from using them. To use the supplied blow dryer, you have to hold down a button the entire time you‚Äôre attempting to dry/style your hair. Very annoying. Also, the light switches in the room are a puzzle. Sometimes you can‚Äôt turn on the light in the shower room by itself, sometimes you have to play with the switches in the vanity area or the room to figure out how to turn on specific lights, and sometimes they all just turn everything on. Extremely confusing. Also, it is a huge step to get in and out of the combo shower/tub. Just a note for anybody with mobility issues (or those who are height-impaired).

As for the staff, the daytime doormen are friendly and helpful. They‚Äôll greet you and hail a cab if need be. The night doorman, on the other hand, was not at all friendly (never greeted us and it seemed like an imposition the one time we requested a cab). We can hail our own cabs, but had seen other guests make requests, so thought it wouldn‚Äôt be a problem.  The front desk staff were not particularly hospitable either. They weren‚Äôt proactive about offering information about the property/area at check in (other than providing a few free drink vouchers). No offer of maps or points of interest information (and it was not busy when we arrived at 10:00 am).

Unfortunately, housekeeping was also hit or miss. We were there for 3 days and, despite our having been out of the room most of day 2, they never cleaned the room (or replenished the 1 small bottle of complimentary water).  When they did clean the room the next day, they decided that a partial roll of toilet paper would be enough to last us, so we ended up getting some from the pool area restroom.

As for the bar staff, some of them were kind, some of them looked annoyed that they were there, but none of them were attentive. There were times that we were the only ones at the bar with empty glasses in front of us, and they‚Äôd go out of their way not to make eye contact with us. We‚Äôre not heavy drinkers by any stretch, but we had a very hard time getting service after our first drink. As I said, the temperature was uncomfortable, so maybe that impacted their moods.  We went to another hotel to check out their rooftop bar and they couldn‚Äôt have been more friendly or accommodating (and they knew we weren‚Äôt guests). A really stark contrast to the Seventy bar staff.

The bar staff at the rooftop pool was a little better but not much. The pool itself was a welcome respite (and necessary to cool off after a long day of sightseeing), especially since the AC was lacking.

Given the reviews we had read, we expected this place to live up to other higher-end boutique hotels we‚Äôve enjoyed. The property is very pretty, well located in a safe part of the city, and great for picture taking, if you‚Äôre into making a splash on instagram; however if you‚Äôre interested in great boutique hotel service and creature comforts, I‚Äôd look elsewhere.",3,2024,09,17
49,One of Barcelona‚Äôs finest!,"I can‚Äôt give enough stars for how happy we are with Seventy Barcelona! The hotel is beautiful, the room (ours was a lounge terrace room) was gorgeous and the hotel bar is amazing! 
Be sure to take the Cocktail Masterclass with Carlos, he made sure we enjoyed our drinks and was fun to talk to! 
The food at the restaurant was also quite good!",5,2024,09,15
49,Expected more from a hotel of this standard.,"We stayed at this hotel for five nights in September. The reception is beautiful, and the public areas are lovely. But our room was not in the best condition, though very spacious. When we arrived, very late due to a delayed flight, we noticed that the minibar was leaking and the door didn‚Äôt close properly. There was no plug in the bathtub, so it couldn‚Äôt be used to bathe in. The shower head leaked for the connection to the hose, and sprayed water everywhere. The plug and the shower head was fixed, and the minibar door as well, but for a hotel of this standard (and price) we expected things to be in order.

The overall cleanliness of the room was not the best either. There was what looked like mould in the bathroom, and a lot of dust overall. 

There was also a lot of noise coming from the hallway - so the room it is absolutely not soundproof towards the hallway. There was (I assume) a maintenance room across from ours - which housekeeping used around the clock with their trolleys, and this would wake us up. 

The staff is very nice and friendly, the breakfast is great, and the restaurant was nice. Location is good. But we expected more from a hotel of this standard.",3,2024,09,15
49,Perfect stay at great location,Excellent stay in this wonderful and new Boutique Hotel in the middle of the Eixample area but in a more quiet street. Very good attentive staff . Rooms are very good size and beautifully designed but comfortable king bed and quality linens. Electric black out curtains is a plus! Definitely recommend stay !,5,2024,09,15
49,Don‚Äôt hesitate just choose Seventy for your Barcelona break!,"Blown away by this hotel! It was simply amazing from start to finish. This was a mother daughter city break of 4 nights and we couldn‚Äôt have chosen a better hotel. The welcome was warm. First impressions were wonderful. The hotel is beautifully decorated in a contemporary style. Everything about it is beautiful. We had a room on 3rd floor which was beautiful. Modern decor and beds so comfy and bed linen you would want to take home. Really comfortable. Location couldn‚Äôt be better to experience Barcelona with many great restaurants and bars nearby as well as metro, shopping and fabulous sightseeing almost all within walking distance. Staff were so friendly  especially Ahmed on the door who welcomed us with his lovely smile as we entered and exited. Isabella and the girls on reception couldn‚Äôt have been more helpful. We only had breakfast one morning. It was sufficient and ok but there as so many coffee shops just outside you are spoilt for choice. My favourite was 321 on the corner. 
We would highly recommend this hotel. Delighted we chose it! 

If I was to pick holes I would say the lighting in room and bathroom could be brighter but it wasn‚Äôt a complaint simply an observation!",5,2024,09,11
49,Better shower quickly!,"Beautiful modern hotel with friendly helpful staff.  Easily accessed through the Metro nearby.  
The only thing that didn't impress me with this  nice hotel was that the shower ran out of water after a few minutes, only allowing one of us to get a shower before the ride to the airport.",5,2024,09,10
49,Comfortable stay,"Lovely modern hotel. The entrance reminded me of New York hotels. 
The decor in the lobby/reception area is really lovely. 
The restaurant and courtyard area are also nicely decorated.
The upper deck pool area and bar are again very nicely decorated.
Our rooms were on the sixth floor and were fairly spacious although the photos of the rooms made them look bigger than they were. 
I wasn‚Äôt keen on the bathroom layout as it felt really small, there was a bath and no shower cubicle. So you had to climb into the bath which had a shower over the top. The bathroom also felt a little dated.
The breakfast choice was good for cold foods but didn‚Äôt have much choice for hot breakfast items.
It‚Äôs fine if you like cereals, toast and pastries. Also a choice of fruit and yogurts.
We had originally booked a different 5 star hotel but they couldn‚Äôt guarantee a single bed room for my children. Thankfully Seventy hotel could.",4,2024,09,04
49,Rudderless Ship,"A very instagrammable hotel, however my stay goes to show that beauty is only skin deep!

I was shocked that my stay was so different to what over traveler‚Äôs had experienced. But I can only go off my stay. To give you some background, we stayed in Barcelona many times in high and identical star rated hotels.

I will start with the welcome, which apart from the doorman was good. We found the doormen at this hotel to be miserable and lack any hospitability. Other than gentlemen with a bald head. Most of the staff I found to be welcoming and pleasant. However all it takes a few bad apples to spoil the experience and sadly this was the case. How hard would it be for staff on reception to look from a screen and say ‚Äúhi‚Äù. Never once in a 7 night stay did this happen.

The room we chose was the terrace option. The room its self was on the smaller side, but as advertised. On the whole it was good if a little worn. The bath had no plug (could be down to drought restrictions) and the sink plug just didn‚Äôt work. Back to bath, round the edge was covered in mould (see pictures).  The room (102) was also very loud, the flushing of toilets in other rooms could clearly be heard. Along with the moving of tables and chairs in the restaurant below. Moving on to the AC, this really struggled to keep the room at a comfortable temperature.

During our stay we also made use of the Spa and roof top pool area. The Spa was basic but nice, again a little worn with steam room missing a lot of mosaic tiles from the floor. The roof top area was nice, but would benefit from being staffed full time and a refresh.

All this hotel needs is some strong management, direction and attention to detail. This, along with some refurbishment could make it one of the best! At the moment it‚Äôs sadly lacking.",2,2024,09,04
49,Amazing 5***,"Wow, this hotel is exceptional. Stunning beautiful throughout. Gorgeous rooms. Friendly and helpful staff. Fabulous breakfast and evening meals. We did arrive during a drought so were unable to use the pool and spa, but this can‚Äôt be helped. We will definitely return here. The most amazing 4 day break for my husbands 40th birthday.",5,2024,09,02
49,Highly recommend - great stay overall!,"Beautiful hotel - kind service, excellent breakfast, lovely room and rooftop pool.  We were only here a single night after our cruise but I would choose this place again in a heartbeat.  Staff were so kind for our early arrival.  Room was much larger than I expected and very comfortable.  My husband described the bed like ‚Äúwhipped cream.‚Äù  Quick visit to pool was refreshing.  We were able to walk to Park Guell and Sagrada (although Park was a bit of a workout uphill!) Thanks to flight delays, we were able to enjoy the breakfast, too - which was so much nicer than we could have expected.  We hope to see you again, Seventy.  Thank you!!",5,2024,09,01
49,Possibly the best hotel in Barcelona!,"We booked this for 5 nights and could have stayed quite happily for longer! Just my wife and I stayed here for our first time visiting Barcelona.

The hotel and its location were perfect!

Getting around from here is easy with both buses and the metro from Av Diagonal situated just behind the hotel. Prices are cheap at 2.55‚Ç¨ or you buy a travel card with journeys loaded onto it.

The hotel itself looks just as good as its pictures, it‚Äôs modern, clean and every member of staff we spoke with were welcoming and professional.

The lobby area is a lovely place to relax including the well stocked bar area which is an impactive sight on entering the hotel.

Staff at reception helped us settle into the hotel and local area with recommendations for our first night exploring.

The pool at the top of the hotel is a great place to relax and cool off, plenty of sun beds and seating areas for everyone at all times of the day. Drinks at the hotel bar are reasonable (9‚Ç¨ for two beers) and fresh towels provided. Up top you have a unspoilt view of Sagrada Familia whilst you unwind with some quiet music played in the background.

The restaurant (we had bed and breakfast) offers a brilliant range of foods for all dietary needs. I was a fan of the omelette‚Äôs which the chef cooks to order, there is loads a seating inside and out with the latter being a great way to start your day in a modern, Spanish style courtyard surrounded by the birds singing from the olive trees they have planted outside, a very good start to the day!

We had a room with a terrace which was wonderful to enjoy when back even if it wasn‚Äôt for long. The rooms are modern, clean and you want for nothing. There thankfully is very good air con, a Nespresso coffee machine, chargeable mini bar if you wish and complimentary bottles of water everyday. The room comes equipped with a Bluetooth system to link your phone to and play music through the speakers throughout the room. The bathroom is clean and comes with a hairdryer and straighteners if that‚Äôs your thing. Our bed was huge and comfortable and everyday the rooms are made up by housekeeping. One last touch worth a mention was that on arrival for my wife‚Äôs birthday the hotel left sweet treats and a bottle of cava on ice to celebrate. Really nice touch. 

This hotel will not disappoint you when you book and we cannot recommend the staff and facilities here enough.

Thanks for a brilliant stay.",5,2024,09,01
49,Wonderful,"Lovely hotel, very comfortable rooms, lovely food and beautiful area. Would definitely stay again.
This was our first trip without our children and we had a really lovely stay. Nice restaurants in the area. Lovely walk to Sagrada Familia. Manageable walk down to the beach / port and back through the town. Hotel restaurant lovely for lunch and for dinner and the pool, although small, was a great bonus. Thanks!!",5,2024,08,29
49,"Great rooms and location, but gym only fits 4 people and it‚Äôs by appointment only","We had a great experience in Seventy. Beautiful, modern and spacious hotel in great location. Good breakfast. However, for the price, we expected a usable gym, as stated in the website. However, it‚Äôs almost as small as one elevator‚Ä¶ only two threadmills. 

It‚Äôs so small that you can only access it on appointment with the spa, because it can‚Äôt physically fit more than 3 or 4 people inside the room. 

So if you want to hit the gym in the morning it will probably be already booked. 

Lastly, the spa water is not hot. 

For the price paid, this was not expected.",4,2024,08,29
49,Excellent Hotel in Central Barcelona,"I settled on Seventy Barcelona for a three night stay with family and was very glad I did. The hotel is extremely comfortable and well-managed.
The rooms are very clean and have terrific beds - we were on the courtyard side of the property so it was very peaceful as well. The hotel was able to accommodate our request to have our sons in an adjoining room - a great option if you are traveling with children and can spring for two rooms.
The hotel has a great roof terrace with lots of space to relax and a very refreshing plunge pool. There is also a lively and well-stocked bar on the ground floor.
The breakfast buffet was extensive and well thought out - a big hit with our two boys and their appetites!
Service was polished and friendly at all times.
And the location is outstanding if you want to be in central Barcelona.",5,2024,08,24
49,Home Away From Home Away From Home,"We arrived at Seventy after a grueling day of travel. We were treated with smiling faces and delicious complimentary cava. I could leavee it there, walk away and feel good leaving a perfect score but then, I would be short selling the amazing friends we made in the staff (looking at you Alberto!), the great cocktails, the homey and luxurious atmosphere, the great pool area ( I want to DJ up there so badly hint, hint!), the comfort of the rooms and the love for the neighborhood. Thank you Seventy. I will be back. I have no doubt it will feel like home when arriving.",5,2024,08,23
49,"Top-notch location, staff, ambience, and resto!","My mother and I loved our stay at Seventy Barcelona! The staff was top-notch and we really enjoyed the restaurant at the hotel, which was such a pleasant surprise. The food, drinks, and ambience were great (especially the peaceful outdoor patio) and we truly appreciated ***Eduardo,*** who made every meal wonderful. He and other waitstaff even sang happy birthday to me on our last day at the hotel. I hope to return to Barcelona and will be back at Seventy, 100%.",5,2024,08,21
49,Amazing stay,"This hotel is amazing and the staff are incredible. 

I asked for them to plan a romantic engagement proposal for my partner and the outcome was everything we wanted.

Thank you especially to Fanny who organised the proposal.",5,2024,08,19

49,Seventy Barcelona,"This hotel is outstanding. The staff are very welcoming and helpful. 
This was an anniversary holiday for us and to our surprise, we had a bottle of cava and sweet treats, delivered to our room! A lovely touch.
We booked the 'Patio room' which was absolutely lovely - very clean and spacious.
We didn't book breakfast because we wanted to explore other cafes in Barcelona. However, we treated ourselves to the hotel breakfast on our last morning  and what a treat that was! Endless choices, all well presented and delicious.
Location wise, the hotel is on the outskirts of the main tourist area (Las Ramblas), but we liked that. 
We walked everywhere - even down to the harbour which was about 40 mins, but there are plenty of buses available and the metro if needed.

We will definitely stay at 'Seventy' again and thoroughly recommend it.",5,2024,08,07
49,Carlos the Mixologist,"This hotel truly was amazing. There was spaces to even work and study upstairs along with an amazing bar with amazing staff there. Speaking of staff, I really enjoyed the experience Carlos was able to provide as the instructor in our cocktail making class. He was polite, clear, and a great person to work with and the sangria cocktails were also amazing. I highly recommend this hotel for anybody visiting Barcelona and will definitely be staying there again when I come back to this amazing country. Thank you again for making it a memorable experience for myself and partner.",5,2024,08,04
49,Business and Pleasure,"Great location, in the heart of great shopping and restaurants, yet tucked away so that you are not inundated by the city noise. Clean room, good vibe, friendly check in.

49,Beautiful hotel in Barcelona,"Absolutely lovely hotel. I watched a lot of youtube videos to narrow down where I wanted to stay while in Barcelona and it did not disappoint. Greeted with cava at the reception and a little surprise in the room for the beginning of my birthday month! Loved the little details in the room (Bluetooth speakers in the ceiling), free bottled water, very cute rooftop lounge area and pool. Would definitely recommend and I will be back next time I'm in Barcelona. ",5,2024,07,12
49,Everything is fine.,"Everything is good. The room is big and clean. King size bed is prefect. A huge TV is attracting.

However, the water pressure of shower and especially tap is too low, understanding that it is a environment friendly hotel.

Highly recommended for visitors to Barcelona.",5,2024,07,11
49,Overall Unpleasant Experience,"The nicest thing to say about the Seventy Barcelona Hotel is that it‚Äôs an ‚Äúinstagram worthy‚Äù hotel. It‚Äôs made for beauty and appearance but not form or function. 

My husband and I have stayed at many boutique hotels in Europe, and this has been the worst one, especially based on the four star rating and all the reviews we read prior to booking.

Let‚Äôs start with the pros. Stunning lobby, bar, patio, and rooftop pool. Unique style and ambience in all the common areas. The location is great and convenient. The hotel breakfast is delicious. The Bluetooth connection in the rooms is a nice, modern touch (we played our music while relaxing or getting ready). The blackout shades were appreciated, and it was fairly quiet. The rooms had an ironing board and iron, a coffee machine, and free water, and the safe and fridge were a nice convenience. 

Let‚Äôs move to the cons. The hotel rooms, while beautiful when you first walk in, are not designed to be functional, and the service needs improvement. 

-Bathroom. The bathroom area is open to the entire room. If you don‚Äôt wake up at the same time as your roommate, it doesn‚Äôt make for a great experience. There are no shelves in the shower to put any of your things (I had to balance anything I needed on top of the shampoo containers). The sink design is so strange; the faucet is small and low with little power and set back with a shelf right above it, so have fun bumping your head at least once. There are no tissues to be found. You have to hold the button down on the hair dryer (if you have a lot of hair, you will hate it).

-Light switches and night lights. There are so many light switches and random automatic/motion lights that make no sense. For instance, there is a separate room for the toilet and the shower. You cannot turn on the light for just that room. You first need to turn on the entire bathroom (waking your roommate) and then turn on just the shower/toilet room. The closet has a motion sensor and turns on every time you pass it (yes, even when it‚Äôs closed). It stays on for maybe five seconds. If you want to pick out an outfit and not wake your roommate, you have to open and close the closet multiple times. While the blackout shades are nice, it‚Äôs negated by the several night lights that you cannot turn off. We had to cover the two blue ones near the bed, the blue one under the sink, and the glow in the dark hotel map on the door to darken the room. I‚Äôve never written so much about lights, so I‚Äôll stop there.

-Beds. Our beds were very comfortable, but it was two twin beds positioned together. On top of that, they were on wheels, so they were constantly moving around. I‚Äôm used to the two twin bed setup in Europe, but typically they are made up together so it appears as a queen/king for couples. If you like snuggling your partner or lying across your bed to relax, this is not the hotel for you. There were times in the night I was sure my husband was going to roll into the middle and slowly (or quickly) fall onto the floor. While somewhat funny, it doesn‚Äôt make for a good hotel experience. 

-Service. For a four star hotel, the service was wanting. You have to ask for them to bring you a robe instead of just having them in the room (you only get slippers unless you make the request). The cleaning service is very slow, or at least it was for us. We‚Äôd be out most of the day and get back around 4pm and our room still wouldn‚Äôt be cleaned. Our sink and shower drains were completely clogged when we arrived - standing water in the sink (that‚Äôs how bad it was). We informed the front desk before heading out for the day, and when we got back, nothing was fixed. We had to ask again before going to dinner, and it was finally fixed that evening. I will say that it was starting to re-clog just a day later. Another example of the service quality was when we got back from a concert very late and asked the front desk for a bottle of water (the free one that comes with the room). Since our room hadn‚Äôt been cleaned that day, we knew we didn't have one upstairs. They first attempted to give us seltzers and charge us, and we clarified we just wanted the standard free bottle. The front desk said no problem and that it would be sent up to our room. Needless to say, after waiting for about thirty minutes, nothing arrived. We gave up and went to bed. We didn't encounter any mean staff members - it just seemed to be a general lack of care and attention, which is unusual for a four star hotel. The front desk didn't even ask how our stay was when we checked out (a first for us but probably for the best) - reflecting the general apathy that the hotel staff had for us. 

I realize this is a long and more negative review, and I hope someone finds it helpful. Please know that I much prefer to write positive ones. Happy travels!",2,2024,07,10
49,Amazing experience !!!!,"We came to Barcelona with our family for our son‚Äôs wedding. We spent a couple of weeks and everything was great !!!
Starting from breakfast, cleanest of the rooms, the beauty of the common areas, the pool area and the bar. But the best is the staff
Angel at the restaurant area is amazing !!!! He was always on top of every single detail that you can imagine. Breakfast, lunch, bar always on top of everything giving the best service and attention possible. Really super great service !!!!
Special mention to Usmane helping us with our luggage and receiving us at our arrival every single day 
Marti and Fanny always great. Super helpful at the operations and reservations. Welcoming you and make you feel at home. 
This is one of the best places to stay √°renos the world 
we can not come back to Barcelona to any other place than Seventy Hotel 
Thank you very much to all !!!",5,2024,07,08
49,Doorman Nonwelcoming,"An ABSOLUTELY STUNNING hotel!! We were planning to make reservations for a future visit in Barcelona; however the doorman assumed we were here only to take pictures and proceeded with an emphatic ‚ÄúNO ENGLISH ‚Äú when we attempted to communicate with him. There was no effort to guide us to guest services for assistance. This was very surprising given the languages listed and, ironically, with the name ‚ÄúSeventy.‚Äù We would have loved to been guests given the beautiful aesthetics and location. One bad apple CAN spoil the bunch.",1,2024,07,07
49,Beautiful Hotel,"Just returned from Barcelona on a 3 day mini break to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary. From the moment we arrived we had 5‚Ä¢ treatment. The hotel was spotlessly clean, and the staff always went over and beyond to help us. The breakfast was superb and very fresh. The reception staff sorted our open top bus tour tickets and were very helpful. On the night of our Anniversary we had a bottle of Champagne and a strawberry patisserie delivered to our room before we went out for dinner. Would highly recommended this lovely hotel for a break in Barcelona.",5,2024,07,07
49,Simply excellent!!!,"A huge THANK YOU to the whole team at the Seventy Barcelona for another fantastic stay.  Almost a year after our first visit to your beautiful hotel, we have just returned home from another fabulous experience.  Your team are exemplary and a credit to the hotel.  Stand out performances from lovely Alberto, our superb bartender, who always looked after us.  Also, special mentions to Albert, Elena and Valeria on the front desk.  Finally, to the doormen and luggage team who always greeted us with a friendly hello/smile and were always helpful.  We really cannot wait to come back.  Superb service - goes over and above all the time.  Thank you!!!",5,2024,07,05
49,Great hotel!,"Absolutely gorgeous hotel in a great location close to everything but away from hustle and bustle. Side note - one of the best tapas restaurants and churros shop are directly across the street. Rooms are beautiful furnished, the patio and bar area downstairs are lovely and the rooftop pool area was great to relax. The only feedback I have is regarding the daily making up of our room. On a few occasions, we would return to our room mid to late afternoon for a nap to find it wasn‚Äôt yet made up. The first time this happened, we asked reception when it would be ready and the response was ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know‚Äô which we thought was very strange.  Other than that, everything was great and we would definitely stay again should we visit Barcelona again.",5,2024,07,02
49,Wonderful stay!,"What a wonderful little gem of a hotel! It's very clean, comfortable and amazingly quiet despite being in a busy city. We never sleep in, but several days found us waking up after 9am, it was that quiet! The beds were comfy and the linens crisp. We felt we had plenty of room for our 3 day stay. We had a courtyard view, which is the only negative I can think of, it isn't pretty and several of the neighboring buildings could are in need of repair, but it is in the heart of the city, so they cannot be faulted for that. 

The hotel staff is amazing! I would like to point out that Valeria and Aurelian went above and beyond! As did the rest of the bar staff - best Old Fashioned we've ever had...now I am spoiled. Everyone at the front desk was helpful as well. 

Breakfast buffet was solid. Personally, I am not a fan of buffets, but everything seemed to be fresh and plentiful. The do have coffee service, but you do have to ask. It would be nice if they offer, the self serve machine is not friendly and easy to use. 

Loved the rooftop oasis..it was nice to retreat to at the end of the day and soak up some sun or shade depending on the heat of the day. Pool looked inviting, just didn't have time to use it. The lobby and bar area are also beautiful, with a fun vibe.

I enjoy boutique hotels and this was a delight!",5,2024,07,01
49,Nice place,"Good hotel, good location, very clean and modern, staff were friendly and polite  although some of them on reception didn‚Äôt speak very good English which was frustrating. Pool area was nice although could have done with more shades as there was only 2 and was so hot but pool was lovely. 
Thought the lunch menu was quite expensive not much choice same thing every day which u got fed up with after a while evening menu was a lot better. 
Only draw back we had is our telly didn‚Äôt work properly so was difficult to watch euros in evening as kept saying no signal night after night which was really annoying.",4,2024,06,25
49,Great hotel and location,"Beautiful hotel and an ideal location - Right at Passeig de Gracia and Diagnal.  Food, shopping and public transportation all nearby.  Rooftop pool, bar, etc.,  service was excellent.

Rooms and hotel are beautiful and our stay was quiet despite being street facing.",5,2024,06,24
49,Perfect hotel,"We were a group of 11 and all absolutely loved staying at this hotel. The rooms were clean, the staff very friendly, and the location was perfect. I would highly recommend this hotel while staying in Barcelona!",5,2024,06,23

49,Unique Atmosphere at Seventy Barcelona,Excellent stay in Barcelona first time and perfect choice to stay at Seventy Barcelona. Energetic and friendly employees there to help your stay flawless and comfortable. Rooms are clean and quiet how they described. Location is perfect for most attractions. We will definitely comeback to Seventy Barcelona for our next trip. Thank you all again who served us with quality of their hospitality.,5,2024,06,20
49,Virgin Cruise Layover,Seventy Barcelona was very welcoming after our Virgin Cruise. Held our bags until check-in time so we could get on with seeing the city. Close proximity to Sagrada Familia and Park Gruell. Great Cava!,5,2024,06,17
49,Amazing hotel!,"Amazing hotel, which is beautifully modern and has a fantastic location for exploring Barcelona.
We were very pleased to learn on arrival that we had been upgraded and had been given cava and cake to enjoy in the room. It started off our 40th birthday celebrations amazingly! (special thanks to Crisitan!) 
We especially enjoyed using the roof top beach bar and pool.
Definitely highly recommend this hotel and hope to return in the future.",5,2024,06,17
49,Seventy!,"HIGHLY recommend Seventy to anyone that is traveling to Barcelona looking for a beautiful place to stay, in a perfect location.  The rooms are immaculate and include every amenity. The reception desk is friendly and accommodating. If you visit the bar, which makes any drink you desire, be sure to ask for Alberto! His smile and love for his home city are contagious. Alberto made my son and I feel right at home, helping my son with his Spanish and giving us tips on places to visit. The 7th level pool and bar made our stay all the more heavenly!",5,2024,06,11
49,Amazing stay at this hotel.,We had such a lovely stay at the hotel.  The rooms are spacious clean very quiet at night.   We had a great sleep. Breakfast was fantastic.  It was my birthday and a bottle of Cava and cheese cake was sent to the room.  Would definitely stay here again. amazing xx,5,2024,06,11
49,Sensational Seventy,"The hotel was booked as part of an EasyJet package. We arrived to be greeted at reception by friendly staff. Our room wasn‚Äôt ready but we set out to look around the area and soon had an e mail informing us when the room would be available. Located near diagonal and a 15/20 minute walk down to plaza Catalunya and the beginning of the Ramblas will take you past Gaudi‚Äôs famous buildings. The hotel is 5 minutes from the metro with good connections to the airport, Camp Nou and the Segrada Familia. The hotel room was luxurious and of top quality- very modern, comfortable and spacious with an excellent shower and plenty of cupboard space. Breakfast provided and excellent choice of continental or cooked, freshly presented. I have inadvertently set the standard against which my wife will judge any future holidays!! If you are staying in Barcelona Seventy will not disappoint",5,2024,06,10
49,Such a chic little hotel in the heart of Barcelona!,Such a beautiful boutique hotel in a great area for exploring Barcelona. The lobby and lobby bar are just stunning. The rooms are quite spacious with lovely furnishings. We especially appreciated the (small) hydrotherapy room after a long day of walking. I would definitely stay there again!,5,2024,06,09
49,Perfect Barcelona Stay,"Amazing location, attentive and friendly staff, delicious breakfast, well-appointed room. 5/5 recommend! We were able to walk from the hotel to many of our planned activities and the surrounding neighborhood offered plenty of fantastic restaurant choices. The one small issue we had with our room was resolved immediately. The courtyard was a fantastic place for an afternoon cocktail. A/C worked very well (important for us to sleep well!). If we find ourselves in Barcelona again, Seventy will be our choice.",5,2024,06,07
49,Beautiful hotel!,"This hotel is beautiful, and the staff at the desk are so helpful! They always greeted us with a smile and helped us with our many questions about how things worked! They were always eager to help us with anything we needed!
Our rooms were beautiful, clean, comfortable and spacious.
The outside patio restaurant had nice afternoon choices for a light early dinner with wine. Coming from the US, we are used to eating dinner earlier so we appreciated the option.
The rooftop bar was so nice. We brought our own bottle of wine up there, but we could also order drinks from a phone.
Everything was wonderful and I can't say enough about how helpful the staff was!",5,2024,06,05
49,Second Great Stay at Seventy,"One of the best hotels I‚Äôve ever stayed at, ever. Cordial, friendly staff, top notch service, great beds/rooms, nice breakfast, and the spa is fantastic after a long week of walking/cycling around Barcelona. Thank you, Seventy for another exceptional stay!",5,2024,06,05
49,Barcelona hotel that helped make a fabulous trip even more so,"I could write a very long review of Seventy Barcelona without running out of positive things to say. We recently completed an eight-day stay at Seventy and from the moment we checked in, the staff was friendly and courteous and made us feel we had found the perfect spot from which to base our Barcelona adventure.

I regret not getting the names of more of the staff because everyone was so helpful, but I will particularly remember Valeria, who, beyond handling the typical questions one brings to the front desk, helped me with an atypical one: ‚ÄúI have an awful toothache. Can you help me find a good dentist?‚Äù With one phone call, she found me a wonderful dentist, fluent in English and just a short walk from the hotel, and scheduled the appointment for me. She reduced what could have been a major disruption of our trip to a minor speed bump.

When I had second thoughts about renting a car and navigating Barcelona traffic so we could make our way to Cadaqu√©s and the Dali Museum in Figueres, Valeria found us the perfect driver.

One other wrinkle in our trip that Seventy handled flawlessly: I also managed to leave my wallet in a taxi‚Äîsounds like quite an ill-fated trip, doesn‚Äôt it?‚Äîand another member of the front desk team manged to track it down with the taxi company and get the wallet returned to me in short order.

Other notes: our room was spotless and comfortable. The restaurant, both at breakfast and dinner, was outstanding, and the rooftop with pool were lovely, We regretted not having more time to spend there, but so it goes in a city with so much to see.",5,2024,06,04
49,Fantastic,"What a fantastic place. On the beach, the food was fantastic. Barcelona bomb was great. Service and everything is really lovely. All the service staff are so nice. Great prices and very clean. Will definitely come again and again. Me and my husband have had a lovely afternoon",5,2024,06,02
49,Fantastic second stay,"Fantastic second stay!  Rooms are spacious and stylish, food and bar excellent, vibe is totally cool.  Style is comfy and trendy at same time.  All staff were helpful and attentive.  My only choice in Barcelona!",5,2024,06,01
49,Hotel Gem,"We stayed at Seventy Barcelona for 4 days prior to our cruise‚Ä¶.we liked it so much so that we changed our hotel spot cruise to stay here again! The hotel is clean and chic‚Ä¶and smelled so good! The staff was pleasant and attentive. We especially liked Valerie‚Ä¶. She made sure our stay was perfect. Our room was a terrace room. It was very spacious and smartly decorated. We loved the blackout shades and blinds. We did wish we could stream on the tv. Guests get 30 minute spa daily‚Ä¶which we used‚Ä¶.daily. Do indulge-it‚Äôs worth it. We enjoyed our new friend, Carlos, at the bar, every night before and after dinner. He‚Äôs the best! This place is worth it. We will definitely be back.",5,2024,05,31
49,Worth every dollar/Euro! Best Hotel we've ever stayed in!,"All I can say is WOW! There are literally hundreds of hotels in Barcelona, and Hotel Seventy is not only one of the finest hotels in that city, it's one of the finest my wife and I have stayed at anywhere!
We stayed here for one night before a cruise, and two nights post-cruise, before flying back to the USA. On our first stay, we arrived around 1 pm and to our surprise, our room was ready for check-in! On our stay after the cruise, we left our bags with the front desk, and rode around the city on the hop-on hop-off bus. When we arrived back at the hotel around 4 to check-in, our room was ready and our bags were already in there!
We had a ""Sky Room"" for both stays. These are on the 6th floor, so you're above the street noise (and there isn't too much of that anyway). Beds were wonderful (king size), shower water pressure is good and strong. There is a serious drought in Catalonia, and signs are everywhere urging people to use as little water as possible.
Best thing about our two stays: QUIET. This is a newer hotel (2019 I think) and they must have good soundproofing between rooms, as we didn't hear any noises whatsoever from neighboring rooms. We slept great! We had a room rate that included breakfast, and I would strongly recommend this rate, as their breakfast offerings are vast, tasty, and it's pretty expensive if you buy it separately (‚Ç¨22 per person I think). We had one dinner in the hotel restaurant also. They have a menu with a lot of variety. It's a little expensive compared to the many restaurants within walking distance, but it's convenient.
The hotel location is excellent! Just off Ave.Diagonal. There is a subway station about 2-3 blocks walk that will take you down the short distance to La Rambla or Plaza Catalunya. A bus stop for the red and blue lines of the Barcelona Bus Turistica is also about 2-3 blocks away. Easy to get a taxi to go to the airport as well (~‚Ç¨45).
The only thing I didn't like was the lack of English speaking channels on the room TV (which are huge). BBC News and CNN International is about it. If there was a way to cast from your phone to the TV, that would be helpful for those of us who want to watch a favorite program in our native language.
That being said, this was an excellent hotel to stay, whether it's for one night or for several.
We are returning to Barcelona in the summer of 2025 and we definitely will be staying at Hotel Seventy again!",5,2024,05,30
49,Perfect Hotel in Barcelona,"Hotel Seventy is fabulous. It is very well appointed and conveniently located to visit the Barcelona sights. All its areas are beautifully decorated and impeccably maintained. The rooms are perfect and very comfortable. The restaurant has a well thought menu including a multitude of Spanish dishes. The breakfast buffet is ample. All the food was delicious. To complement the facilities, Hotel Seventy has an amazing staff. We would like to mention Victor ‚Äì professional and with a genuine sense of true hospitality. He always went over and above. Rosalyn serves you with sweetness and Alejo provides very nice conversation points. We truly enjoyed all our meals at the restaurant. At the reception they were all full of smiles. Griselda was a joy to greet every day. Boris and Lucia were also very nice. The housekeeper was very honest. He returned my wallet that I‚Äôve forgotten in the room when I was checking out. I‚Äôm sorry I couldn‚Äôt get his name. 
On Saturday, the hotel had a singer at the Lobby bar who was amazing. We enjoyed very much her singing and selection of songs.
The hotel was so amazing that we are planning to return. Thank you everybody!",5,2024,05,29
49,Best kept secret in Barcelona,Beautiful modern hotel.   Very close to shops and Sagrada Familia.  8 to 12 minute walk in friendly upscale neighborhood.  Spacious and refreshing.   Slept very good and room was wonderful.   Breakfast is a must at hotel.  Enjoyed my stay and can I say .. I did not miss my bed at all while staying here.. 5 stars,5,2024,05,29
49,Amazing hotel!,"This hotel is probably the coolest hotel I‚Äôve ever stayed at. It feels new and hip without being pretentious. All of the spaces from the rooms to the lobby to the restaurant are impeccably styled but yet warm and welcoming. The amenity kits in the rooms are awesome as are all the USB ports and blackout blinds. 

My only tip would be to stay in a room on a higher floor (we were on 2) and not facing the Main Street as there is some road noise and noise from the cafe across the street. Thankfully I brought my little sound machine and was able to drown it out.",5,2024,05,27
49,Stylish hotel in an ideal location,"Excellent and very stylish hotel in the ideal location to enjoy Barcelona 
Spacious, comfortable rooms 
Attentive staff and a very cool vibe
We were greeted with friendly professionalism and an offer of a glass of champagne

49,Amazing First Stay in Barcelona!,"We had an amazing stay at Seventy Barcelona!!! We arrived early on a Wednesday and were able to check in right away! The rooms were clean, quiet, and comfortable! The food and drinks served at the bar and restaurant are beyond compare! What really sets this place apart, from other hotels, are a couple of things: 1. the close proximity to all of the stores, restaurants and museums and 2 (most important): the friendliness, helpfulness, and knowledge of all the hotel staff! The waitstaff, our doorman, and especially Valeria could not have done better by us! If you have an opportunity, we strongly encourage you do the tour offered by Valeria! It is such a personable and enjoyable time! We hope to stay at Seventy Barcelona again in the future and will highly recommend to anyone looking to travel in the future! Thank you!!!!",5,2024,05,23
49,The most fabulous hotel,"The most fabulous hotel.  Cannot fault this hotel , location, staff, service and amazing food and drinks and very reasonable prices. Each and every staff member was extremely friendly and nothing was too much trouble. .  Don‚Äôt hesitate in booking. We had the best visit and will return one day.",5,2024,05,23
49,Amazing First Time Stay in Barcelona,"Beautiful hotel, from the lobby to the rooms, spa, bar/restaurant. The staff were very welcoming and went above and beyond. I couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better experience for my birthday celebration. 
When we arrived left our bags at the desk as we were early for checkin then explored the city. Came back said our bags were already in our room and they had a surprise. Turns out they upgraded us to a massive 2 floor suite. 
First floor guest bathroom, electric fireplace, included mini bar with local wine, beer, snacks, electric blackout blinds, books on local architecture & artists, second floor giant standing tub & walk in shower, really comfy king size bed, 4 closets with automatic lights, Bluetooth speakers in every room easy to connect your phone to. 
Housekeeping helped us with the fireplace and made sure we were restocked every day. 
The bartender made wine shop recommendations on our itinerary route and their menu was reasonably priced ($6 Cava). 
Made an included reservation at the amazing spa which was basically all to ourselves (1 other guest), indoor pool, sauna, steam room. 
Roof top terrace had great views and comfy sun loungers by the pool. 
Lobby had so many cozy areas to sit a work or use your computer, tables and booths with built in outlets next to multistory bookcases. 
Front door staff made us feel safe coming back late at night and helped us get taxis each day.",5,2024,05,21
49,Can‚Äôt Go Wrong,"I had a fantastic first-time trip to Barcelona thanks to the staff at Seventy. They‚Äôre warm and welcoming for anything you need, such as showing me how to properly set the room‚Äôs A/C unit.

The patio view room was a great choice. It had a desk and love seat at the foot of the bed which made the room feel more spacious. I also loved the blackout blinds that helped me get extra sleep. My goddaughter stayed in a street-facing room and had no issues with external noise, and neither did I.

We hung out in the bar/lounge area and really enjoyed the nightly live music before heading out to dinner. It was nice to have this easy option rather than having to find a bar elsewhere.

The hotel is perfectly situated to cover the city, with a pair of metro stops and the Pasage de Gr√†cia within 2-3 blocks.",5,2024,05,21
49,One of the best,"- great location with a nice neighbourhood feel (not too touristy) 
- friendly, helpful staff
- gorgeous lobby and common area
- great water treatment/sauna area, included for 30mins in the stay
- a decent amount of free activities at the hotel bar - we went to the sangria making class hosted by the bar team Aurelian and Carlos (they were funny, generous and informative) 
- the rooms were decently large  and have great blackout blinds. 
- the in-room amenities have room for improvement. for example, the TV channels are spotty and the TV lacks chromecast. the desk surface was quite sticky. the sink drain was plugged - we had to call the reception for service though it was addressed reasonably quickly.",5,2024,05,20
49,Beautiful hotel in great location,"We have just returned from a 3 night stay at Seventy Barcelona.

This hotel is beautiful, decorated to a high standard and spotlessly clean throughout- I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever visited somewhere that is so clean. The hotel smells gorgeous too as you walk in the doors.

Bedroom again spotlessly clean with comfy bed and high spec finish. It had hairdryer, straighteners and iron/ironing board, safe, mini bar all there. We were 6th floor so far away from road noise, which was minimal to us but may be louder on a lower floor.

The staff are the real gem here, everyone we came across was very friendly and welcoming and always willing to help.

The hotel is in a great location and we walked to all major landmarks. The restaurant opposite the hotel La Pepita is a must, the food was amazing (booking definitely needed as small restaurant and queues out the doors).

We made use of the 30 mins free spa access each day which was again a great facility, clean and relaxing.

The roof top terrace was a great space to relax, sunbathe and have some rest- you can even request drinks from the bar are brought up. The mojitos are the best we‚Äôve ever had, so definitely worth a try.

We did eat dinner in the hotel restaurant and whilst it was okay, we personally felt the other restaurants we ate at off site were far better. The breakfast was tasty though, plentiful and huge variety and the cappuccinos were yummy (ask the staff for your choice of hot drink rather than use the self service machine, for a tastier drink).  

The one thing we didn‚Äôt quite understand was the doors to the downstairs bar terrace were unlocked but anytime we tried to sit out there we were told it was out of use. It‚Äôs a shame as the weather was sunny and a nice spot to enjoy a drink and we would have liked to use it.

Overall a great stay though and still happy to give 5/5 üåü",5,2024,05,19
49,Exceptional!,"Exceptional experience. This hotel is gorgeous. The staff are incredibly friendly and helpful. The location is great ‚Äì right next to Gracia. We got upgraded to a suite and our room was absolutely incredible. The breakfast was delicious.

I would definitely want to stay here again next time we are in Barcelona. I also want to note that we were traveling with our two-year-old and the staff were incredibly kind to him. Special shout out to Val for going above and beyond to make him and us feel welcome.",5,2024,05,18
49,Fantastic hotel to stay.,"Excellent from the time we walked in.  The staff are friendly, polite, helpful and knowledgeable.  We stayed at Seventy for 4 nights.  We stayed in a Sky Room which was comfortable and well appointed.  Hotel restaurants have great food.  Good bar. 
Would recommend the Massage and Facial.  Seventy is centrally located with good restaurants and shopping within easy walking.  Recommend Seventy.  Would stay again.  Pamela and David, Australia.",5,2024,05,17
49,The hotel is great but the location is out of this world - book it!,"I think Barcelona is one of those cities where the location of your hotel really shapes your experience of the space. And this location could not be better for tourists who want to authentically get to know the city in as little time as possible. Nestled right in between the Gracia and l'Eixample, it gives you a taste of both neighborhoods while being a 15-30 minute walk away from all key tourist attractions, Las Ramblas and the Quartier Gothique (which is charming but my am I glad I did not stay there). 

First, the Gracia area is completely wonderful. It is scattered with tons of small restaurants, tapas spots, squares, Vermouth bars, families playing with their children, couples enjoying a date.... it feels very local, safe and is wonderfully wanderable. L'Eixample right below this hotel, is more modern with wide boulevards, shopping, bigger restaurants and lots of people and cars. We spent most of our wandering time in Gracia and I don't think we would have spent any time there at all without this hotel, which would have been such a shame and made us love Barcelona just a little less. 

It is a long walk to Sagrada Familia, a short walk to La Pedrera and Casa Battlo, a 25 minute walk to the Placa de Catalunya and a tad longer to the start of Las Ramblas a short walk to the metro (which we never used, just walked everywhere) and a short walk to some of the best bars in Barcelona.

Now, only onto the hotel. The hotel's best feature is its location. Beyond that, it is a clean, friendly, top hotel that tries really hard to give you a good experience. There are a number of sweet little extras: sangria every evening in the lobby, complimentary classes multiple times a week, dedicated doormen, an impressive lobby we never used and a lovely pool area. We stayed in a lounge terrace room, so we had our own patio, which would have been a very nice addition in the hotter months - as it stands we didn't use it too much. Do note all terrace rooms with private patios are on the first floor only.

The hotel also surprised us night one with a complimentary slice of cheesecake and bottle of Cava to mark our celebration. Such a thoughtful and very appreciated thing to do!

My only nit is that it was not a soundproof room. We were located at the end of the hall (room 102) and could hear a creaking from some internal door opening and closing at all hours of the day and night. It didn't bother us too much, and earplugs would have solved the problem, but is something to note. The room also gets wonderfully dark with automatic shades and is soundproof from the courtyard. 

Something else small I loved - door hangers at hotels often only say 'do not disturb.' The other side of the door hanger here asked the maid to make up your room, which was helpful when we left our room later than standard maid-keeping hours.

As well, though the hotel recommends La Pepita across the street, skip it and do something more intensely Barcelona - Can Boneta's menu, Lluitu 2 for seafood tapas, Raspall for cheap and fun tapas. We LOVED a little vermuteria called Puigmarti Bar.

Overall, this hotel is a fantastic win. While I don't know its cost in high season, it was certainly worth a pricier per night stay for us than other hotels in the area. While I debated intensely whether this was the right option before staying, in the end, it completely and totally was. Our trip was so much better because of this hotel - yours will be too.",5,2024,05,16
49,Amazing staff at the Seventy Hotel in Barcelona,"We spent six mights at the Seventy Barcelona and it was fabulous. Our room was comfortable, the staff was excellent, the restaurant and bar were outstanding. The front desk staff was accommodating in every way possible.  Alexandra made dinner reservations for us at El Glop in the neighborhood.  We told her that we would like something traditional and within walking distance.  She arranged it and at the time we wished to dine.  We had fried artichoke as an appetizer, something we had never heard of and a delicious paella.  On the rainy day they arranged a taxi to take us to the Sagrada Familia. On the festival of St. Jordi when we returned to our room we found a nice note and some chocolates. When I had a very bad experience with a pickpocket stealing my phone, license and credit cards the front desk assisted us in every possible way. They calmed me down, got a taxi and told the driver to take us to the main police department office. Lazarro helped me try to use the hotel computer and when that was not working he assisted us by calling the rental apartment for our next stop, got all the information sent to him and then relayed it to my husband.  The hotel manager and/or front desk felt really badly for me and when we finally returned to our room we found a nice note, a bottle of bubbly and a fruit plate.  It was a really sweet touch to try to lift my spirits. I would highly recommend staying at the Seventy. It‚Äôs comfortable, well run and beautiful.",5,2024,05,16
49,Outstanding Hotel,"We come back to this hotel as it‚Äôs not just the best hotel in Barcelona it‚Äôs one of the best hotel‚Äôs in the world. The rooms are fantastic, the amenities first class and the staff are amazing. This is just an exceptional hotel from the moment you walk in until the moment you leave. Cannot wait to return to Seventy.",5,2024,05,16
49,Great spot to experience Barcelona,Actually the pillows are quite fluffy. The location is excellent. It is right across the street from probably the best churros shop in Barcelona and la Pepita restaurant which is one of the best restaurants in the city. It has a great rooftop with pool and the room are beautiful and clean. The bar and staff are amazing and the drinks are exquisite. The food is also great. It is walking distance to all themain attractions.,5,2024,05,14
49,Excellent Service,"What an incredible Hotel! The entire property is magnificent and the service was unparalleled. The room was very comfortable and clean with great amenities.  The restaurant and bar were awesome and their service, the best! The hotel is in a great location,  easy to walk around with many restaurants nearby. Really enjoyed my stay and look forward to returning again in the very near future.",5,2024,05,10

",5,2024,05,09
49,Great modern and welcoming hotel,"This is a beautiful hotel with a wonderful staff.   Rooms are beautiful and very comfortable.   Definitely not a typical ""European hotel"".....plenty of room and modern.  Bar and restaurant were very good and on the weekend the bar had live music.  Cece was fantastic.   Couldn't recommend this one more!!",5,2024,05,09
49,A perfect hotel,"Seventy Hotel Barcelona is pure joy from the first minute until the last.
First impressions always count and at Seventy your first impression is a genuinely friendly welcome from all staff, beautiful public spaces, helpful advice and an obvious interest in helping you make the most of your time at the hotel and Barcelona in general.
The public ares are always buzzing with interesting people in the superbly decorated spaces.
The rooms are beautifully decorated, clean, comfortable and accessible, absolutely one of the best we have stayed in during our many trips to Europe.
Breakfast in the morning and tapas for dinner were of the highest quality and standard.
We were treated to a Masterclass in making sangria on our last evening, thank you Fannie and all the staff for a fun, interesting and happy experience.
Will highly recommend Seventy Hotel for your stay in the magical city of Barcelona.",5,2024,05,08
49,Shick Relaxing Boutique Hotel in centre of Barcelona,"Very stylish and modern/contemporary hotel, with a cosy boutique feel.
Really enjoyed spending breakfast in the olive tree garden every morning, as well as the spa (1hr couple massage after night out partying). The rooms are huge, and furnished elegantly. The service is excellent, and we got a Champaign bottle on arrival and two drinks free for the bar. Bed was super big & comfortable, we slept really well. Quiet despite being very central, as it's pocketed away from the Diagonal.

Location is very central, sandwiched between Gracia (lots of cafe/bars and restaurant) and L'eixample (shops) - was back in town for a school reunion, so didn't do too much of touristy stuff this time, but it would be perfect hub for this too.

Price vs performance, excellent, you feel you got more out of the stay.",5,2024,05,07
49,A Truly Top-Notch Experience in Barcelona,"Stayed at this hotel and WOW! Location is amazing. Right in the heart of the city, with all the cool spots nearby. Easy to get around. Also, super close to Vila de Gr√†cia, where true Spanish lifestyle all about, plazas and unique shops.

The room? So cozy. Huge bed that feels like a cloud. And super clean too. I really appreciated that.

The staff? A+. Super friendly and ready to help. Anything we needed, they were on it.

Highlight of our stay: the sangria workshop with Alberto and Valencia. So much fun! We learned to make sangria and got some cool tips about local culture. Plus, Alberto and Valencia were a riot. They made it so enjoyable.

Overall, fantastic stay. Loved the location, loved the people, loved the experience. If you‚Äôre in town, stay here. You won't regret it!",5,2024,05,04
49,Don't look anywhere else - book here!! ,"I wish I could keep the secret to the best hotel in Barcelona to myself but I cannot -- especially if I wish they stay in business forever.

This hotel is amazing in so many regards. The location is prime - close to so many great restaurants, walking distance to so many of Barcelona's popular attractions and incredibly safe, even after sunset. 

The STAFF - I cannot commend them enough. From the moment you get greeted by the door through check out, they make you feel incredibly special and seen. They are so professional and helpful. Special shout to Lucia -- she was so helpful, answered all my questions, offered a drink upon check in and to hold my bags so I could go and explore. Once I came back from a full day of exploration my bags were waiting for me in the room!!

The room - immaculate and luxurious. It's incredibly clean and the high ceilings make the room feel spacious and I appreciated the multiple mirrors for getting ready.

The amenities - I wish I had more time to explore more. A note for my gym enthusiasts - the gym is very small and is on a reservation basis but the pro is if you're able to reserve, it feels like you have your own private gym for your workout session.

If I'm ever back in Barcelona I'll be hands down staying at this hotel. Yes, they're boutique so you won't be getting your loyalty points but it's SO worth not staying at the major chains and staying here. Highly recommend!!

49,100 to Seventy hotel.,"Excellent service and beautiful hotel.
Attentive and helpful personnel. Breakfast was plentiful , varied and delicious. Very clean. Large cozy room, bathroom with all amenities.
Live music at the lobby bar fridays and saturdays.",5,2024,04,30
49,Great stay at the Seventy Barcelona,"My second stay at the Seventy Barcelona.  Both were enjoyable.  The hotel is well located but isn't right in the middle of the chaos of the main Eixample area.  Close to the Diagonal Metro stop.  The reception desk is friendly and helpful and the lobby bar is a great place to start or end your evening with a cocktail.  There is a courtyard bar and rooftop pool bar, both were not open during my stay.  The breakfast buffet had plenty of options and the food was tasty and fresh.  The rooms are contemporary and comfortable.  My stay this time included an outdoor terrace, which was private and large.  My only complaint about the room is that lighting controls are needlessly complicated.  AC works well and is quiet, there was not a lot of noise on the courtyard facing rooms and the windows are well insulated.  

I do want to call out the excellent service we received from Valeria at reception.  She organizes a small tapas and drinks tour for guests one night a week into a neighborhood close to the hotel but one that many tourists might not visit.  She is very entertaining and the tour was a lot of fun.",5,2024,04,26
49,We will be back !!,"First time in Barcelona and could not have picked a better Hotel.  Central location, safe area, great rooms, excellent food, and definitely the friendliest staff of any Hotel we have ever stopped in.   The staff are encouraged to interact with the guests, and this is the ethos of this  Hotel.  Nothing was ever too much trouble.  Will definitely be back.   Loved the lobby , and thought the bar area was excellent.  Alberto was probably one of the best bar tenders ever.  A credit to the Hotel.   Also a ‚Äú shout out‚Äù to Albert on reception.",5,2024,04,24
49,Great Stay in Barcelona,"Just returned from a 3-night stay at Seventy Barcelona.  Beautiful hotel in a nice area. central to many attractions, restaurants and shopping.  The lobby and bar area do not disappoint!  The staff is very friendly and accommodating and there is always someone to greet you when you return from your day of exploring.  Loved the live music in the bar area in the evenings!  Breakfast was not included in our rate, so we opted to eat elsewhere for less than the 22 Euro charge (so many fantastic restaurants, cafes & bakeries everywhere!)
Our room was modern, clean and nicely appointed - a little on the small side but that is to be expected in Europe.  Would have preferred a walk-in shower to the tub with the high step-in.  The electric room-darkening shades are a great feature!  Loved that there was a hairdryer and straightener provided!  The only negative for us were the confusing toggle light switches in the room.  It was impossible to control individual lights, as they seemed to go on and off in groups. Some labeling or even a ""cheat-sheet"" on what toggle went to what light would be helpful!  Would stay here again the next time we're in Barcelona.",5,2024,04,22
49,Nice and clean.,"Very nice. Good service and staff. Nothing negative to say. I was there for 3 days for a conference, no problems. The pool was empty when we where there, but that was due to draught, and has noting to do with the Hotel. Easy to walk in centrum from this hotel.",5,2024,04,22
49,Perfect Accommodations in Barcelona,"The hotel is the perfect place to stay in Barcelona. It's within walking distance from several main attractions (eg, Casa Batll√≥, La Rambla, Sagrada Familia) and very close to the Diagonal metro station. The room was great, the service too and there are several excellent restaurants within walking distance. Could not recommend it more!",5,2024,04,21
49,A fabulous 3 day break at a perfect hotel!,"We had the most amazing 3 night stay at this fabulous hotel. Loved our room which looked out over the front of the hotel.

The staff could not be more accommodating and we were lucky enough to be there when the swimming pools reopened as the drought ban had been lifted! 

The ambiance was lovely in the bar area & we ate in the restaurant which was really good. The breakfast had a great selection & felt valued for money. 

We were in a perfect  location for accessing many parts of Barcelona which made this a perfect spot just away from the hustle & bustle but close enough to get there!",5,2024,04,20
49,A true revelation....,"Tremendous hotel.  Staff, ambience, rooms, location, all were superb.  Would highly recommend.  Particularly fond of the rooms and decorations.  Very upscale without being stuffy - which describes the overall vibe of Seventy Hotel.",5,2024,04,19

Shout out to Val at the front desk for always being so friendly and offering us cava to set the mood right. Alberto at the bar was probably the nicest most professional bartender that we‚Äôve had the opportunity to get to know.
Ask them for recommendations around Barcelona!",5,2024,04,18
49,Fantastic Stay,"Beautiful hotel. Stunning lobby, great location, comfortable beds, friendly staff, and tasty breakfast. Thoughtful details included curtains that close at the touch of a button and Bluetooth connectivity for the in-room speakers. Don't forget to enjoy a steam & sauna in the spa.",5,2024,04,18
49,Great accomodation. Magnificent hotel. Great location. Everything super!,"The hotel was overall magnificent. We had the suite with the terrace on the first floor. Very spacious. The bed was really comfortable. The breakfast was very satisfying as well as dinner in the hotel's restaurant. There is a very beautiful terrace, where one may enjoy breakfast, lunch or dinner. The staff was helpfull and polite. Everything was super! Definitely going to stay in the same hotel during our next visit to Barcelona.",5,2024,04,18
49,Amazing stay at Seventy Barcelona!,"Seventy Barcelona was exceptional! From the moment you walked in, you got the type of vibe that makes you feel relaxed and taken care of. The young guy that checked us in was very positive and event went up to the room with us to show us the different features of the room and what we had available to us. The black out shades were phenomenal. The size of the bathroom/tub/shower was great. We had daily breakfast at the hotel and it was very yummy and they offer multiple options. On one of the nights, we were told about a free Sangria making class so we signed up for it. Alberto led the class and he was GREAT, funny, courteous, and a very good teacher. The hotel is located in a great central location where we felt safe. They also assisted us in getting a taxi on our last day and it was very convenient since they drive right up to the hotel. Everyone seemed to work very well together and I loved our stay there. Definitely 5 out of 5 for us!",5,2024,04,16
49,Well thought out hotel with a fabulous atmosphere,Just amazing! We went for a terrace room and loved it. From the minute you walk into the hotel to the minute you leave the service is excellent. The room was really good. The bed is very comfy and BIG! Lots of pillows and a blanket to keep you warm at night if needed.  Connect your own music to room music system a great touch plus the hairdryer and strainers. Plus the blinds that are electric. Big tv screen. Shower/bath great. Room beautifully decorated. The food very good. The hotel is in a good location to reach different activities. The Bell Pepper cafe/bar great place for baby squid!!,5,2024,04,15
49,Pleasant Stay,"A cozy, friendly, clean hotel with cute style and convenient location.
The staff are very kind and helpful. 
Not only the bar and show were amazing, but a personalised drink from Alberto was a top notch and very much appreciated.  
Highly recommend.",5,2024,04,14
49,Barcelona brilliance,"This hotel is brilliantly situated for a few days of sightseeing in Barcelona and the staff are amazing - nothing is too much trouble. Big thank you to the housekeeping staff who were all so lovely.

Breakfast is amazing! So much choice. We also really loved the terrace on the roof which gives you a chilled feeling even though you‚Äôre in the middle of the city. Word of warning though for those not aware - because of the drought we couldn‚Äôt use either the pool on the roof or the one in the spa.

The Seventy Spa is a great place to have some treatments - thanks to Maurizio for his rejuvenation treatment (and his advice for tension!)

Our room was the smallest - it was a House room. We would have preferred something a little bigger but the hotel was fully booked. They were also able to quickly make the beds into a twin as although I‚Äôd asked in advance it hadn‚Äôt been done. Also we hated the heated mirror in the bathroom as it made the room so hot (and we couldn‚Äôt work out how to turn it off).

All in all a fantastic hotel in a great location with lovely staff - thank you.",5,2024,04,14
49,Most enjoyable stay in Barcelona,Convenient location! Modern interior decor! Clean and comfy beds! Excellent experience! Friendly services! Best breakfast buffet in Barcelona! The chief is very professional and serious with quality food!,5,2024,04,14
49,Truly Excellent!,"I sometimes question whether the ""Excellent"" ratings are legit on Tripadvisor - sometimes it sounds too good to be true. I will say that the excellent ratings are totally legit. This is quite possibly the nicest European hotel I've ever stayed in. The staff were all wonderful, the rooms were big, the pillows and bed were all very comfortable, and the location was outstanding. I hope to get back to Barcelona someday and I will definitely stay here. It's worth the added expense!",5,2024,04,13

We'll come back 100%. Highly recommended.",5,2024,04,12
49,Roof top pool closed due to drought - apparently other hotel pools remain open. Too far from tourist areas.,"I would not recommend this hotel for a tourist break to Barcelona. The pool was closed and it is too far from main tourist area. On arrival I had to pay ‚Ç¨150 deposit, I‚Äôm used to just leaving my card details. The pool and the surrounding sun-bed area were closed, I believed this was due to the 3 year drought and government orders. However, a woman on our guided tour assured me her roof top pool was open. If I were to return to Barcelona I would definitely choose a hotel closer to La Rambla. There are, of course, restaurants and cafes close to the hotel but many of the recommended ones are over half an hours walk away, (we loved our food and the ambiance of the Cellarer Wine Bar, only 16 min walk away). La Sagrada Familia is 20 min walk away, winding streets of the Gothic Quarter over 30 min walk away and the beach 55min. The Passeig de Gr√†cia metro station is about 15min walk away, from there you will get a train directly to Terminal 2 at the airport (they run every 30mins, ‚Ç¨5 each, about ‚Ç¨32 via Uber). The rooms were nicely styled, clean and quiet. Our 4  teabags, 2 coffee pods and drinking water were replaced daily (local shops don‚Äôt put prices on the water which we found suspicious). The tables in the beautiful hotel lobby were occupied by many people on laptops and I imagine this is a popular hotel for conferences.",3,2024,04,09
49,Amazing,The hotel is beautiful and everyone is very attentive. Valeria was so kind and made sure to let us know about a free Sangria making lesson the night we arrived. It was so much fun and Alberto our Sangria instructor was personable and really engaging! We met a great group of people and had a great time learning about how to make Sangria. Thank you Alberto and Valeria and all the staff at Seventy Barcelona for a great visit!,5,2024,04,08

49,Vibrant Hotel,"Seventy was absolutely stunning.  Very accommodating, friendly staff and great location. The room was beautiful and we had an awesome view from our room. Visited the bar and was greeted by Alberto. Alberto was the first local I officially met in Spain and it was nice to meet someone so welcoming and informative about what's popular for locals and for someone like me: touching down in Barcelona for the first time. Will absolutely recommend Seventy to friends and family!",5,2024,04,01
49,The most beautiful hotel.,"Stayed 5 nights in March and was completely blown away. 

The hotel is perfectly located with easy access to a train station that will take you to all the main sites, as well as walking distance to great museums, shopping and restaurants. The staff were all lovely and helpful.

The room was very comfortable and spacious, as well as beautifully decorated. Everything was clean and well presented. The wifi was fast and we had no issues streaming. The bathroom was also clean, well laid out and the water pressure in the shower was fantastic. 

I wouldn't stay anywhere else if I was returning to Barcelona.",5,2024,04,01
49,Sangria master class,Master class with Alberto  was AMAZING!! He taught us so much and we learned to make amazing sangria. Highly recommend. We made cava sangria and normal sangria. We also had some veggie chips and croquets along the way. A must do when staying at this hotel,5,2024,03,31
49,Stylish Stay in Perfect Location,"We spent 5 nights at the Seventy Barcelona and were 100% pleased with our choice. The rooms were super comfortable and quiet. Front desk personnel were warm, super sweet, and helpful. Location was perfect on the edge of both the Eixample and Vila de Gracia neighborhoods for easy access to interesting restaurants, cafes, bakeries, bars, and shopping and away from the mad crowds on the lower part of Las Ramblas and in and around the Barrio G√≥tico. Other parts of the city were easily reachable by walking or metro. Hotel offers a lively lobby scene, stylish decor (we especially loved the blue hallways on the guest room floors), and quiet, comfortable rooms, all a winning combination.",5,2024,03,31
49,Exceeded expectations!,"Omg! Where to start?! We LOVED this hotel. It completely exceeded our expectations. The lobby, the bar, the restaurant, the room... all beautiful and have a real WOW factor. The staff are so helpful and friendly. The bar and restaurant staff always made us feel very welcome and appreciated. The food and drinks are superb. 
Our room was spotless, spacious, modern and well equipped (dryer, straighteners, toiletries, large desk, sofa, safe, coffee machine, tea making facilities). The bed was super comfortable and enormous. 
The spa is a wonderful extra and the gym is very well equipped and very clean. 
We loved the live music in the bar on weekend nights and thoroughly enjoyed the Sangria making class on the Sunday night!
Highly recommend this hotel and would love to return for another visit.",5,2024,03,31

It is in a great central location, with the city's hop-on-hop-off buses five minutes walk away situated in a great shopping area with numerous well known brands there. The hotel has excellent staff, and was very clean. We had a lovely room with a very comfortable bed. Breakfast was included in the price we paid for the holiday, with a very good choice o food. We also had dinner in the hotel very night of our stay. Again, the choice of available was very good. Service was excellent. I would certainly stay at this hotel again.",5,2024,03,26

It is easy reach to Park G√ºell, Sagrada Fam√≠lia and is opposite the most incredible La Pepita restaurant‚Ä¶",5,2024,03,24
49,"Exceptional hotel, we would go back in a heartbeat!","We had a wonderful four days at Seventy Barcelona. From the moment we checked in to the moment we checked out. We had complementary welcome drinks, a quick tour of the hotel and spa on the way to our room and a local map of the area was given to us. Showing us local attractions in the vicinity.   The room was spacious, situated on the third floor overlooking an internal courtyard room no 324. It was quiet and clean. The bed was so comfortable and electronic black out blinds at the touch of a button. The hotel felt very safe and is in a lovely area with luxury brands, excellent restaurant's, including some Michelin starred. We would recommend Harry‚Äôs in passeig de La conceptio and Larquitect at the opposite end of it. We walked most places like Sagrada familia it took about 15 -20 minutes at a slow pace. We bought tickets online beforehand and paid ¬£22 each to go into the Cathedral. It was amazing. We got the train from the airport it easy to get to using the free airport shuttle to T2 the train fare was ‚Ç¨4.30 each person for a single ticket to passeig de gracia from the airport it is only 3 stops. I would also recommend visiting Park Guell, we got the metro to Vallcaca and walked from there, it is sign posted quite clearly around the area. It was 20 degrees on the 19/03 and I would recommend bringing a couple of bottles of water with you as there is only one shop in the grounds and long queues. Wear comfortable shoes as it‚Äôs an incline hill walk around the park with amazing views over The city and the coast line. We walked 25,000 steps that day to give you an idea. It was Amazing and glad we went. We also visited casa batllo  and La pedrera. We took the metro to the Port area, with a marina full of yachts. There is a shopping centre and restaurants we felt a bit uneasy in this area lots of street sellers so we hopped back on the metro to diagonal. 

The hotel:The roof top pool and bar was closed at the time we visited sadly. However this did not spoil our stay as the courtyard terrace was very pretty and a relaxing place to sit and have a drink. The bar area is stylish and inviting. We would especially like to mention the fabulous staff that went out of there way to make our stay enjoyable. Carlos and Alberto in the main bar and all the other staff in the morning at breakfast. It was my birthday whilst at the hotel and they surprised me with a glass of fizz and cheesecake and sung happy birthday.  sorry I didn‚Äôt  get your names. 
We had an amazing time at the hotel and in Barcelona and we would definitely recommend this hotel to friends and family. In fact we already have. 

My only negative comment was that the towels are quite thin and abrasive. The hotel management may wish to look into replacing these with softer more fluffy ones. 

Everything else was exceptional! We would return to this hotel if we ever do visit Barcelona again. Thank you to all the staff that helped make our stay!",5,2024,03,23
49,Ms New York,"Loved the hotel, beautifully decorated and the staff were very professional and friendly. From the minute you get out of your taxi, there is someone to assist with your luggage. This is the second time I stayed at the hotel, it was almost 2 years and it was so nice to be recognized.
I stayed in the Patio room, very luxurious.
Since it was pouring raining that evening, we decided to eat at the hotel, the food was delicious.
Location of the hotel is so convenient.
Would definitely stay again on my next trip to Barcelona.",5,2024,03,20
49,Best Hotel in Barcelona,"As a couple we travel alot and have several holidays a year. We came to Seventy Hotel Barcelona for our 25th Wedding anniversary and can honestly say we have never had service like it from the moment we arrived all the staff are outstanding.

We will definitely come back.",5,2024,03,17
49,Fabulous hotel with incredible staff.,"Booked via EasyJet as part of a package so really didn't expect this fabulous hotel...what a treat!! This really is a 'smart' city hotel in a great central location, cleverly furnished and incredibly clean throughout. The room was their smallest, but still very comfortable (huge bed), air conditioned, incredibly quiet (despite being above the busy street), and the shower was enormous!! Breakfast was a lovely range of hot and cold items, all included in booking price. The reception area had a lovely atmosphere, with complementary cava, and the adjacent cocktail bar had a great vibe. But, the most fabulous thing about this hotel is it's staff!! Everyone who works he is so attentive, polite and charming, you really do feel like a valued customer from start to finish.
Note: Pool wasn't available due to drought restrictions, which couldn't be helped, but it didn't impact our stay.",5,2024,03,17

49,Yes Yes Yes! Loved Seventy Barcelona!,"Outstanding!! Top notch! Excellent!  Can‚Äôt say enough about this hotel and the staff! The property is modern yet comfortable. Bougie yet unpretentious. They care about the finer details. We had an early excision so they prepared a breakfast to go. 
Boris and Valeria made us feel like family! Valeria lead us on a tour of the neighbourhood and gave us an experience only available to locals. Ensuring we had a memorable and authentic visit was top priority for Valeria! She‚Äôs a gem and it‚Äôs obvious that this hotel cares about its guest. We heartily endorse Seventy Barcelona!",5,2024,03,14
49,Cool trendy hotel with an amazing bar and staff.,"This hotel is by far one of the nicest and coolest hotels I have ever stayed at. The entrance is like no other with books and cool art stacked to the ceiling. 
But the bar is where it is at for me. Please go see my friends Carlos and Aurelian who provide top notch service and experience. Carlos shared his expertise at the Sangria Masterclass and I now feel prepared to provide the best sangria at my next dinner party. I look forward to staying here again",5,2024,03,13
49,The Seventy Barcelona - Beautiful Hotel in a Great Neighborhood,"Our recent stay at the Seventy Barcelona was amazing.  It's a beautiful hotel, our room was also beautiful and comfortable which was a welcome change from our previous hotels this trip! We found the location to be great as well - getting to all of our planned attractions was simple.  Lots of great places to eat and shop around the hotel as well. (I wish the hotel would provide a list of recommendations on check-in)

The highlight of our time in Barcelona was taking Val's neighborhood tour - Val's energy is infectious and inspiring - she surely is a bright shining light that made our tour the experience that it was!  I highly recommend that if you're staying here, you ask about the tour - it was time well spent!",5,2024,03,13
49,This Hotel is THE hotel to stay in Barcelona! It efffs heavy! ,"So this place isn't a hotel... It's an experience! 

Aside from everything being incredible, the staff here is really top-notch. 
I had an issue with the next part of my trip, and ELIAS, the bartender, was on the phone with me helping out. 

I definitely wanted to highlight this type of kindness because I'm sure fellow travelers could appreciate a helpful 

Corny and cheesy, but the SEVENTY HOTEL IS 100! Seriously, this place is IT.  DEFINITELY RECOMMENDING AND WOULD COME BACK IN A HEART BEAT. 

SAFE TRAVELS TO ALL! ",5,2024,03,13
49,Alberto Francoligero - Great mixologist at Seventy,"If you find yourself in Barcelona craving an extraordinary cocktail experience, look no further than Seventy and the masterful talents of Alberto Fancoligero. Prepare to be transported on a journey of taste and discovery that will leave you longing for more. Cheers to Alberto and his team for setting the standard for excellence in mixology!",5,2024,03,11
49,It was all about Valeria,"Great hotel . Good size rooms. Wonderful staff. The best part of our entire experience though was the help and assistance we had every day from Valeria on the front desk. From the moment we arrived she greeted us with great energy and made us feel very special. Every interaction we had with Valeria was just first class. The most memorable was how she found my wife's handbag and purse that she had inadvertently left in the lounge. We didn't even know we had left it there till later that night when Valeria called us to say she had kept it safe and sound ! The hotel is lucky to have such a focused, friendly and caring person in their employment.",5,2024,03,10
49,Beautiful hotel,"Stunning hotel. Very modern, soundproof rooms with blackout blinds. Lovely bar area, great breakfast. Good location. We were gutted that we couldn't use the rooftop pool due to the government's hose pipe ban as the rooftop area was gorgeous. Will definetly go back. 5*",5,2024,03,10
49,Awesome place,"Excellent location near to all world class clothing brands and restaurants, staff were warm and cordial and helpful with great hospitality, well behaved courteous staff, comfortable room and breakfast was awesome with different menu everyday with multiple options. overall excellent experience. thank you Hotel Seventy !!!! keep it up, Good Luck..",4,2024,03,10

49,Such a nice hotel!!,"Before we booked this hotel, I read sooooo many reviews on trip advisor of hotels in Barcelona, and this was one of the few hotels where there were no reviews of people feeling unsafe about their possessions when they left their room- and we had a great experience, too!  Housekeeping was super!!!  The people at the front desk were soo helpful- booked early morning cabs for us- booked tickets for a flamenco show for us!  We ate lunch snd dinner quite a few times in the dining room- so good.  We stayed here 5 days before our cruise snd came back here after our cruise snd stayed two more days.  I highly recommend this hotel!!!",5,2024,03,07
49,"A Wonderful Stay,‚Ä¶Well Done, Seventy!","There aren‚Äôt words sufficient enough to describe the wonderful stay we had at Seventy Barcelona. My husband and I spent two nights in Barcelona and spent a lot of time trying to locate the perfect hotel for our stay. Seventy checked ALL of the boxes. Upon check in, we were greeted, checked in, and taken to our room, where all the amenities were explained. The room was spotless and very quiet. We were fortunate enough to stay in the Duplex Suite. From the incredible bath, comfortable bed, and views, it was remarkable. The walkability to most attractions is great or you can choose to take the Metro which is right outside the door. Not knowing where to dine, the front desk gave us numerous suggestions and we had one of the best meals ever! 
While we loved being out seeing the city, we were eager to come back to Seventy to sit in the lounge and enjoy a drink. As far as hotels and an overall experience, this was one of, if not, the best hotels we have stayed at during our years of travel. We will definitely be back to visit Barcelona again and will not hesitate to stay at Seventy again. Well done‚Ä¶cheers!",5,2024,03,06
49,"Exceeded all expectations, wonderful staff and top quality accommodation and location!!!","Seventy Barcelona exceeded all expectations.  The wonderful staff went above and beyond to make my daughter's birthday extra special.  The hotel is well located, beautifully designed and furnished throughout.  It is spotlessly clean.

49,A splendid experience!,"We had the absolute best time at Seventy Hotel! This was our first time in Barcelona and we stayed there for 4 nights for a birthday trip with friends. The rooms were clean and spacious. They also had unique features such as Bluetooth speakers and a bidet. If you‚Äôre looking for plenty of great spots for taking pictures‚Ä¶this is the place. The decor and the scenery was just breathtaking! The front desk employees were very kind and catered to our every needs. I forget her name from the front desk, but she helped us book classes and find certain places we were looking for. 

The room service was fantastic! It was my friend Chris‚Äôs birthday and we last minute called room service to bring up a cheesecake to surprise him and they brought it up at midnight on the dot. It was perfect! They also surprised him with a birthday letter, free breakfast, and champagne that morning.

We absolutely loved our bartenders, Carlos and Alberto. They were wonderful and the drinks were superb! I definitely recommend booking a Sangria masterclass with them. It was very entertaining and gives you a chance to meet new people.

The location was perfect and most areas were walking distance to shopping, cafes, and restaurants.",5,2024,03,05
49,Wow Wow Wow,"The title of this review says it all.

We have had the most phenomenal stay at Seventy Hotel. From very welcoming, thoughtful and accommodating staff, to a beautiful, well maintained and high end hotel from bedrooms, to bar to restaurant. The photos online are good but it‚Äôs even better in person, which is rarely the case with marketing photos! The hotel is kept immaculate and someone is always cleaning something - and with a smile.

I have to say for me personally, one of the best experiences and hotels I have had the pleasure of staying at.

We visited Seventy Hotel for my partners birthday and the staff have been so thoughtful with a birthday breakfast surprise  on the day and then in the room after the spa.

The spa itself is beautiful and again, just like the hotel, incredible staff and the facilities are lovely. We had one small issue that was dealt with so quickly and professionally, I think that is testament to how good their team are.

Thank you for making this long weekend so enjoyable and memorable. It goes without saying, we will be back!",5,2024,03,04
49,Light-filled modern hotel in Barcelona,"We just loved this hotel. Beautiful light filled rooms, entrance, and bar area with two story bookshelves. Loved the live music! Excellent central location near shops and restaurants and Gaudi house. Walk to La Sagrada Familia. Most of all, delightful staff. Delia and Alessandra were so helpful at front desk. I wish I remembered all the staff‚Äôs names because every one was fabulous. Room was spacious and beautiful. All the amenities (even a flat iron for my hair) and ample space to fully unpack suitcases. We‚Äôll be back for sure!",5,2024,03,03
49,Brilliant stay in the heart of Barcelona - don‚Äôt miss the bar!,Brilliant stay for work or leisure. The bar staff are extremely friendly and it was so nice that they recognised me and my colleagues from a visit last year! Alberto and Aureliay were particularly helpful and so friendly - thanks for looking after us! We will be back!,5,2024,03,02
49,Fantastic stay,"Staying here while in Barcelona, was going to go for one of the larger 5 star hotels but after reading the reviews here decided on this and so glad we did. Absolutely amazing boutique hotel with amazing service and so many small touches I‚Äôve not seen in many 5 star hotels.",5,2024,03,02
49,YES...YES...YES,"Centralized Hotel with all the needed amenities. Excellent rooms, Front Desk Staff and close to most of the top tier restaurants. Very contemporary and Sleek designed.
Spa and Gym area are great...Lap Pool with Jacuzzi jets...Steam and Sauna rooms.
ENJOY!!!",5,2024,02,28
49,Barcelona stay,"Overall the hotel was very nice and modern. They had live music on one evening which was very nice! Staff were all friendly.

I upgraded the room to a patio view room, but to be honest there wasn‚Äôt much of a good view. 

The only things that let the hotel down was we reported a maintenance issue on the first evening and it wasn‚Äôt solved at all during our stay. The swimming pool was also shut during our stay due to government restrictions but not advertised on their website.",4,2024,02,26
49,Outstanding quality of service at a convenient location,"We are truly satisfied in all aspects of the hotel's service: cleanliness of the room, courteous and prompt service at the concierge, fabulous food at the breakfasts, great location of the premises as well as the friendly and professional staff members. The hotel even went an extra mile in arranging a birthday surprise for us. We are frequent travellers, but there is not an area where we can ask for more.  ""Outstanding"" is only the word for the hotel!",5,2024,02,26
49,Great hotel and location you won't regret!,"My husband and I loved this hotel!  We reviewed so many hotels and felt we made the best decision in choosing Seventy.  It's located in a great area, walking distances from many of the sites we wanted to visit.  We even walked to the Gothic Quarter's from here.   It's walking distances to all of the great shops as well.

The staff were all so wonderful.  We took a local tour with one of their staff members, Valeria.  She was amazing!  My husband and I probably would've never taken the route she took us on.  Not because of anything bad, but because it was more of a local spot.   It was definitely neat to see.  We would definitely stay here again!",5,2024,02,25
49,Great place to stay in Barcelona!,"Seventy is located within walking distance to numerous attractions without being in the midst of a touristy area.  Our room was very nice and offered everything we needed for our stay.  There were plenty of great bars and restaurants in the area but also great food and drink in the hotel itself - kudos to Elias and the rest of the bar and kitchen team for keeping our thirst quenched and our stomachs full.   We had breakfast, dinner, drinks and snacks at different points during our stay and were never disappointed.  Front desk and housekeeping were also all very pleasant, professional and helpful - assisting with baggage storage, late check-out and other requests as well as help with printing tickets/boarding passes when the business center computer was rebooting, and, for housekeeping - keeping our room tidy.  Thanks for the great stay!",5,2024,02,25
49,well deserved,"awesome place, high quality and best service,  perfect location to discover the city. I just wanna thank you all guys for perfect experience!!The facilities are excellent, clean, quirky touches and the food and drink good quality and plentiful.

49,Boutique with a relaxed elegance,"Choosing the right hotel in such a vibrant city can be lottery!  Google, TripAdvisor, Personal recommendations! Well, rest assured, if you choose  to stay at Seventy Barcellona, you will not be disappointed! The bedrooms are elegant & functional with all the modern touches you need & expect,  safe, mini bar, hair dryer, great water pressure, fantastic bed linen and most importantly quiet. Whilst we didn't dine in the hotel at night (why would you???) The breakfast buffet had everything you would expect, from its excellent fruit bowls, fantastic pastries, delicious breads & preserves, tipping its hat to the British, with a lovely cooked selection. The amazing views from the roof top garden & pool, to the elegant spa. But most of all, the jule in the crown of this fanatic little oasis of a hotel was the team. From housekeeping to the breakfast waiter, concierge or receptionist, bar tender or chef, everyone was incredibly engaged with making your stay just a little bit more special, relaxed but friendly, with an honesty you only get when they are truly proud of the product they are delivering! I couldn't fault the hotel & had an amazing stay! Well done!

49,Masterclass!!!,We purchased the Masterclass Sangria making class. Aurelian did a good job of explaining how to make two different sangrias. We enjoyed the experience!!! We highly recommend this class and the Seventy Barcelona Hotel. The ambiance and the vibe in the hotel is incredible.,5,2024,02,21
49,Awesome Seventy!,"Seventy had excellent  Service, all around from front desk to room service, it is a beautiful hotel, with great ambiance and very well located in Gr√†cia;  the bar staff at night, Albertonamd crew, especially the morning team Roselyn and Isabel were very friendly, attentive and exceptional!  I had to use the special needs handicapped room, which was practical and good.  Fanny the manager was very professional,  friendly and very attentive as well, and provided is with exceptional service.",5,2024,02,19
49,clear recommendation,"stylish and modern, perfect location to discover the city. Good breakfast, good services, e.g. the gym and the ""Cocktail Masterclass"" with Aurelian. The rooms are quiet, many cushions on the bed, friendly staff ‚Äì we had a good time at the hotel.",5,2024,02,18
49,Ideal for those who do not need to be in the center,"Little bit away from the center and the sea, but if you are looking for a quiet, stylish and nice hotel you should try this one. In the area, there are several options for breakfast lunch or dinner and small shops for groceries. 
We had a Seventy room facing the patios. The room was clean and had everything we needed. Big plus was that it was very quiet. 
We used the pool on the roof which was also very nice. 
We used public transport and we had no problem to get wherever we needed to go. 
I will definitely stay in the same hotel again when I am back in Barcelona.",5,2024,02,17
49,great service at the bar,"We had a working meeting with my colleagues at the bar. Everything was perfect, beautiful place and impecable service by Denis. 
Amazing and relaxing atmosphere, friendly stuff
Really recommend to everyone for a meal or drinks with friends or colleagues",5,2024,02,17
49,Perfect stay,"Highly recommend Seventy Hotel. Beautifully styled reception areas, bars and rooms. It was the most comfortable hotel bed we have ever slept in. Lots of attention to detail in the rooms, everything was thought of. Staff very friendly and attentive and the hotel is in a great location for exploring the city. 10 out of 10!",5,2024,02,17
49,Fantastic hotel in the best location,"Really lovely hotel, run by a superb team of efficient, smiley and professional staff.  Excellent location, within a few minutes walking distance of La Pedrera, the independent cafes, restaurants and shops of charming and bohemian Vila de Gr√†cia, or the big luxury shops of Passeig de Gr√†cia. In fact, almost every site we wished to visit (with the exception of the Mir√≤ Foundation for which we needed the metro & telef√©rico) was within walking distance. Even if it took a bit longer, it was a privilege to take our time to explore and discover for ourselves the beauty of this exciting city.  
The hotel decor throughout the public areas and rooms was very chic, carefully thought, comfortable and functional.  There were a few surprising touches I have not come across before that were very welcome: a good hair straightener, a safe that had an interior socket so that your devices charge in the room while you are out and about, as well as a motion-activated toilette seat that illuminates, especially useful at night!  
The breakfast was tasty, lovely to have fresh orange juice on tap but the coffee could be improved and a bit more variety would have been welcome after five mornings of the same selection.  
I am not sure why people complain about the gym; it may be small but it is very well equipped.  One had to pre-book it, but helpful Ivan at reception managed to keep everyone happy.  The dry sauna is kept at a fantastic temperature.  We also used the steam room but the little spa swimming pool was closed due to a ban imposed by the local authorities (due to draught).  We enjoyed our deep tissue and sports massages (special mention to Mauricio) and the organic products (‚ÄúS√ßens‚Äù) they use a smelled divine.  
Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel and would very happily return at a slightly warmer time of the year, when we can enjoy breakfast at the beautiful patio and the fabulous outdoors pool.  Thank you Seventy Barcelona staff, you have been amazing.",5,2024,02,16
49,An Hotel to recommend,"The hotel is excellently located.

I would like to highlight the permanent kindness of all the staff.",5,2024,02,16
49,Awesome!,"Awesome Hotel in the (kind of) center of Barcelona. 
Very modern, very stylish, nice Interior and decoration. Breakfast room looks super nice, food was in most parts pretty decent, except the coffee. Nespresso Pads are usually okay, but not in for a breakfast in this price range.
My room was pretty noise due to very thin doors",5,2024,02,15
49,Highly recommended,"Sometimes the pictures you see of a hotel online don‚Äôt live up reality when you arrive. Not with this hotel. Very beautiful and stylish common areas, rooms as well.

49,"You will feel special, warm, and fuzzy here.","We are Canadian but living in Hua Hin, Thailand. We own aan aparment/hotel (called The Lantern Suites) in Bangkok Thailand. You can expect how picky we would be on details of our stays. We have travelled to many top destinations for both work and pleasures. Now it came 1st time to visit Barcelona, Spain for the 1st time for 3 weeks mixed between works and pleasures.. I ve done extensive reading/reserach on hotels reviews as I am very particular on where we stay for comfort,safety and styles. Seventy Barcelona came on top so we decided to stay here. As soon as we arrived we stayed at Seventy Barcelona as a first welcome hotel us to Barcelona due to locations and unmatched reviews. As soon as we arrived, we got speedy check in and a good welcome drinks as described on the reviews. And here Fanny, the manager walked out from behind the desk to greet us and explained more about the hotel and where to go. Thereafter everyday of our stays ( 5 days before we headed to Seville) Fanny came around from no where everytime we came out from the room to go somewhere. She would greet us and ask if she could help us with anything. She made us feel at home and relaxed here. Then we went to Seville for a weel and stayed at H10 hotel, then back to Barcelona for a week for work where we stayed at Sofitel Skipper. After We spent a week at one of H10 group, Sofitel for a few days, we one day said let go back and made our last 5 days in Barcelona special and memorable. We canceled the original hotel we booked after a week at Sofitel before we head back to Hua Hin, Thailand. We quickly emailed Fanny to help us reserve the room back at Seventy Barcelona for the last 5 days in Barcelona. Again, she ve never failed us and got us a room. Today we checked from Sofitel and took a Taxi back to Seventy Barcelona, my eyes were in tears as I was walking back to Seventy Barcelona. I must say I FEEL LIKE ""HOME"". I feel warm and safe in my heart. Staff remembered us when we checked in. There was a bottle of Champange and a welcome back notes to us back to Seventy Barcelona. There is only 1 thing we can say about the hotel. Seventy Barcelona makes me want to come back and visit Barcelona again. We feel SPECIAL here!!!!ü©µü©µü©µ

The hotel is in a great location within walking distance of the central shopping area and La Sagrada Familia.",5,2024,01,31
49,Seventy Barcelona,"Very comfortable room and good central location. The spa and gym were the key reason we booked Seventy. The booking system to use the gym is cumbersome and unnecessary for residents.  If the gym is full then its a simple enough task to return at a later stage, rather than book a slot. 

Unfortunately the Spa had a leak and needed to close. However unfortunate things do happen that are out of one's direct control.  The hotel management and staff responded to the inconvenience by ensuring we were treated to hospitality, which was much appreciated.  We would be happy to stay at the Seventy again but the gym access is key.",5,2024,01,30

49,Very good hotel,"This hotel is very beautiful, has a 24 hour reception for late arrivals, and the staff were very helpful.  The spa is wonderful, and there is a small gym area.  The breakfast is one of the best I've seen.  The bed is comfortable, and the Sky Room is very spacious.  There was a little street noise, but mostly quiet (I'm a light sleeper, and had no problems).  I only docked a star because our room was not clean when we arrived.  Unfortunately we were unpacked and it was late before I realized that it had probably been serviced but housekeeping didn't realize the guests had checked out (so things were used like cups, robes, probably sheets).  We had the room cleaned the next day, but were a little turned off by that experience.  I'm sure it was a one-off, and I would still return and recommend, but check out your room before unpacking (lesson learned).",4,2024,01,17

 From the entrance you feel the size of this hotel. The lobby area, the reception and the rooms are huge. The room has everything a traveler needs. I was given a room with  an accessible bathroom which would be very good for people who need it, but since (thankfully) I am not one of these, it was really uncomfortable(probably because the hotel was fully booked).
 The staff was very helpful. I thank all of them for the early check in they offered us.
 The breakfast was very good but it did not match the high quality of the rest of the hotel.
 The location is great, everything is  at walking distance.
 If you can pay a month's rent for a night then this hotel is a great option.",4,2024,01,09
49,Wonderful Stay at Seventy Barcelona,"This is a modern and stylish hotel. It is centrally located in a safe, mostly residential area. Sights such as La Sagrada Familia, Casa Battlo, Casa Mila ‚Äì La Pedrera, and La Rambla are all within walking distance. The Barri Gothic (Gothic Quarter) is only a short 10-minute taxi ride away. 
There are countless restaurants, food outlets, and stores located within walking distance of the hotel. 
The staff are all very friendly and forthcoming. We had an early departure (5:30 a.m.) and they prepared a to-go breakfast for us. Very thoughtful. 
They serve a delicious breakfast buffet every morning, including freshly squeezed juices, different breads, Jam√≥n, cakes and pastries, and coffee. We also enjoyed relaxing in the restaurant in the late afternoon, with a nice cappuccino and a slice of cheesecake. Dinner is served starting at 7:00 p.m.
Our room was clean and so were the common areas of the hotel. 
I highly recommend this hotel and would stay here again in a heartbeat.",5,2024,01,09
49,Hotel seventy Barcelona ,"Our third maybe fourth trip in 12 months here and as always exceptional..
But this time when we  needed  help we most certainly  were given the best support. Christian was beautiful, kind, sympathetic and went above and beyond to make our disappointment more comforting.
Briefly we had our bag stolen in a cafe on the way to the airport with everything in including our passports..
Please don't hesitate booking this hotel if you find it...
No staff could be more friendly and assertive thought all our stays...
Thankyou Christian.

49,Good hotel in a great location,"Overall a positive stay. Friendly staff, very clean and organised hotel. Great location. Breakfast is disappointing. Poor selection with a very complicated process to get a tea or coffee. Needs to be reviewed ! Ended up going to a nearby coffee shop.",4,2024,01,08
49,A nice surprise!,"Beautiful lobby, nice, comfortable and spacious rooms, one of the best breakfasts I've ever had! The staff was very friendly and accommodating (only one person wasn't up to par), but the service overall was top notch. I hope to come back soon.",5,2024,01,07
49,Seventy,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Seventy. I walked around the city for hours everyday, so I greatly appreciated how quiet and peaceful my Sky View room was at the end of the night. The breakfast was healthy and filling. The building is extremely clean and beautifully decorated. I loved the Bluetooth speaker system and the massive windows in the room. Extremely comfortable bed and pillows! A fantastic hotel!",5,2024,01,06
49,Amazing will return ,"My 13 year old daughter and I stayed here for 3 nights in Jan 24. The hotel is immaculate and the rooms are lovely. Bed is super comfy with a pillow menu! All staff are friendly and cannot do enough for you. Location was good, great kebab house across the road and about a 20 minute walk to the centre. We walked a different way every time and there are loads of little eateries to break the walk up! I felt so safe with my daughter and that for me matters over anything! We will be back. ",5,2024,01,06
49,Amazing Hotel,"Amazing hotel! We really enjoyed our stay here over Christmas. The hotel is beautiful, clean, comfortable and the staff are all lovely.

49,Great stay!,"We loved our stay at the hotel. Absolutely stunning lobby and room. Very clean too. Hotel staff was wonderful. We had just arrived in Spain and while our room wasn‚Äôt ready the hotel arranged for us to shower in the spa facilities so we could clean up before heading out. Great stay! One note on location, it is located close to a metro and the hotel is very helpful in calling taxis but location is a bit far to walk from las ramblas, gothic quarter, beach, etc.",5,2024,01,03
49,Hotel # 455 en Barcelona no el 5 de 500‚Ä¶.Big disaster,"I just want to let you know that this hotel is supposedly number 5 out of 500 hotels in Barcelona.... This hotel is a disaster. I was here for a week and they didn't clean the floor or sweep the 2 rooms that the person who cleaned the room told me yes. The room was not cleaned before 3 pm. They were not going to clean it until the next day..... We called the reception and they told us no, it was until 6 pm...... Super bad service in the room. porter......We were at the CASA FUSTER hotel when we needed a taxi, the doorman came out and stopped it with great enthusiasm, they helped us....In this seventy hotel a 100% disaster and so many more things that I am not going to waste time telling them.... The only thing I advise you is not to come here for a lot of money for a 3 star hotel, a big disaster.",1,2024,01,02

I loved every inch of this hotel and I would recommend it in heartbeat.

It‚Äôs within walking distance to all the tourist spots.  It‚Äôs luxury and checked all the boxes.

The rooms are perfect , the pool was fun to sit by and they even have a quiet area just to read or plan your next trip. 

We didn‚Äôt eat in the restaurant because we were always on the move but it was always busy when we walk by it.",5,2023,12,30
49,Better than expected,"Delightful hotel in the perfect location.  Staff are great, especially at the bar and the doormen.  The rooms are so clean and the bed is incredibly comfortable.  Also, took advantage of the pool and sauna.  When returning to Barcelona, I would definitely stay here again.  The lobby is something!",5,2023,12,30
49,Excellent stay and wonderful staff,Wonderful hotel and staff : ) Enjoyed the location and the quality of both common spaces and the rooms; small but excellent spa as well. Staff was brilliant. We had an admin issue with the reservation and the manager went out of his way to retroactively adjust the rate for us - something he clearly did not have to do. Delighted with the experience! ,5,2023,12,29
49,Wonderful Solo Stay in May 2023,"This hotel was simply gorgeous - the lobby area is beautiful and the staff was very welcoming and always took time for talk when I'd come back from sightseeing. As I was there five nights they truly got to know me.

The room was very comfortable and the breakfast buffet was more than filling.
The location was very easy to get to from the airport by train and was easily walkable to many tourist sites.

The hotel had a nice little happy hour which they encouraged me to take advanatge of :-)

The hotel was also more than affordable for the quality.",5,2023,12,25
49,Lovely and beautiful,"What a pleasure it was to choose this hotel and stay here for 3 nights!  It was a beautiful hotel and I have never slept better.  Everything was fabulous, will definitely recommend and stay here again! ",5,2023,12,25
49,"Stylish hotel, a few slight niggles","Visited Seventy in December. Lovely, stylish, clean hotel with great staff. However one of our two rooms had a shower that wasn't sealed properly at the bottom causing a flood every time someone showered and the sliding bathroom door didn't stay shut, so not much privacy. Reception offered to have it fixed, but I can't believe no one had mentioned it before, and I just hope it is fixed before the next people have the room. Also, small niggle, the bench seats in the dining room are a bit uncomfortable and tired in places. Otherwise very pleasant stay, and so central to walk to many attractions. ",3,2023,12,23
49,An oasis in the heart of the city,"We stayed at 70 Barcelona for our 45th Wedding Anniversary. We were given an upgrade on our standard room at check in. We were offered drinks whilst we waited for our room, great hospitality as we were tired and thirsty. On the day of our anniversary we went out, returning after lunch to find a bottle of bubbly and a heart shaped cake for our celebration. This was a wonderful gift and much appreciated, the cake was delicious. In fact so were the breakfasts and dinners, with the best coffee we had whilst in Barcelona. The spa was wonderful and the beds very comfy. We felt revitalised after our stay. The staff were so friendly and helpful as were the people of Barcelona. We will definitely be booking to stay again.",5,2023,12,21
49,December 2023,"Seventy Barcelona is in a class of its own. Not only is it perfectly located within walking distance to many popular sites, the metro, and countless bars/restaurants, but it has a welcoming atmosphere that feels like home. From the moment you enter the lobby, you‚Äôre greeted with tranquility and a smile. The staff are multilingual and willing to assist with whatever you may need. Everyone has been exceptionally kind and professional during my stays.
The amenities at Seventy are unmatched. The rooftop pool/terrace gives you views of the Sagrada Familia to the sea. While the rooftop lounge area gives you views of the sprawling neighborhoods and hills surround Barcelona. Each guest is given 30 minutes to use in the spa area which is very clean. I‚Äôve had a massage and facial and the staff was accommodating to work with my schedule as I called last minute for an appointment.
I‚Äôve stayed twice at Seventy Barcelona and with one time being for my birthday just last week. They sent me a special welcome upon my arrival and an additional gift on my birthday. Both were unexpected and so so appreciated.

I can‚Äôt recommend this hotel enough. You will not be disappointed with your stay should you choose Seventy Barcelona. I will certainly be back the next time I visit Barna!",5,2023,12,19

Despite not being a small hotel, it has a personal, welcoming touch. All staff super friendly and helpful, in particular Alessandra at reception.

49,My favorite hotel that I've ever stayed in,"This hotel is the best! Look no further, it has every thing you need & more. 

Hospitality:
My husband & I stayed here for 4 nights for our honeymoon. The staff was always super friendly & helpful. For our honeymoon, we were gifted a free catamaran trip which was such a kind gesture. We were also offered honeymoon packages, and we opted for a dinner for two at their restaurant, balloons, a cake, & cava for ~70 euros. When we arrived they 1) allowed us to check in early 2) had the balloons, cava & cake in our room with a note congratulating us on our marriage. Their hospitality is top notch. For the dinner we were each able to get an app, entree, dessert, drinks, & a bottle of wine to share. Such a great deal & the dinner was delicious!

Room:
As for the room, it was very modern & styled well. The bed was so comfortable, it made it hard to get up in the morning lol! The vanity area is equipped with a hairdryer & a straightener. I've never had a hotel provide a straightener before. I actually used it and it did a good job! Some other things that our room had that I've never had at other hotels: automatic blinds & bluetooth speakers (which we never thought we needed, but used every day)! 

Lobby:
The hotel itself is immaculately clean & decorated so nicely. Their are so many different hang out areas. There is a cute bar in the middle that made the most delicious passionfruit martinis. The bartenders were so sweet & even gave us restaurant recommendations which we went to & enjoyed! 

Location: 
The area around the hotel was nice with lots of shopping around it. Anytime we wanted to get out of the area, we were able to get a taxi within minutes.

Negatives:
The only negative thing I can think of is that the shampoo, conditioner, & shower gel was a weird scent. I disliked it so much I had to buy my own soap. Also, we sent out our laundry & when we received it back, it had a spicy scent to it. The scents were out of the ordinary for us, but that's just a personal problem! 

I truly loved this hotel & will stay here anytime I am in Barcelona. I wish this hotel group had more hotels across Europe!

49,Perfect,The Seventy Barcelona is literally the best place to stay. from check in to check out every need you may have is met and exceeded.

49,Top of the line in Barcelona. Highly recommended!,"We travel extensively and this has been one of the best hotels we have stayed at in Europe in recent memory. Not only that, but it also provides a very reasonable value for money proposition. The team are very friendly and welcoming and always have a big smile. Their interactions are courteous and genuine. We were there for almost one week so had a chance to really develop an in depth understanding of all the facilities and services. 

We really liked our room which featured a modern design and contemporary decor. It was spacious and welcoming with bright colors, a place you'd look forward to coming home to. 

Things that stood out:
- Super service from the Reception team
- Very fast internet speed like 100MB
- Laundry items returned same day within a few hours, without asking or a surcharge
- Unexpected, a bottle of Cava and a nice sweet amenity on my wife's birthday delivered to our room

49,Long weekend  getaway,"A great, great location with a really excellent, service-focused team. The hotel is beautifully designed - think New England aesthetic meets contemporary European‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a great look and feel - welcoming and warm.

The facilities are also extremely good - from the restaurant, bar, spa, relaxing common areas and roof top terrace (though not a heated outdoor pool when we visited). 

My only minor gripe is the in-room entertainment. TV channels-wise most key languages are well served, but only a couple of English channels (news only). No Chromecast and screen mirroring for non-Apple phones. We weren‚Äôt here to spend loads of time in the room, but home comforts are nice! Also the TV Bluetooth for music kept kicking my phone off!

The above is just a little detail. I would thoroughly recommend a stay here. The location is  great being 15-20 minutes walk from lots of tourist activity.",5,2023,11,11
49,Lovely stay,"Seventy is a chic hotel in the heart of Barcleona.  Walking distance to Sagrada and other Gaudi sites.  We had a terrace room which was beautiful.  We arrived too early for check in but they graciously offered us breakfast.  Once in our room--we were pleasantly surprised with a bottle of Cava for our Anniversary.  The bed was ultra comfy, the deck huge with a massive table and two lounge chairs. The bathroom was sleek but the shower/tub dangerous.  No place to hang the shower attachment, the drain not working and the tub is on a weird slope which made it very slippery--be very careful!  Their restaurant had a wonderful breakfast and we ate lunch there as well our second day as we overslept--but wow what a lunch that was...the best risotto I've had in my life!!!  ",4,2023,11,10
49,The best Bloody Mary in a long time ,"We ve been to 70 before and knew that their cocktails were outstanding. I decided to have a Bloody Mary and it really was a fantastic cocktail, so we had to have several more!!! The decor is very trendy. The staff are excellent too ",5,2023,11,06
49,The Seventy - Our Hotel in Barcelona ,"Having been to Barcelona before, we knew we wanted a hotel experience that featured a larger room, better AC and a more convenient location.  We read reviews and created a spreadsheet to compile stats and impressions.  It took some time, but the result is that we found the best modern (not a renovation) hotel within our budget.  The Seventy is a stylish, comfortable, visually stunning, and relaxing hotel.  Located in the fashionable and architecturally impressive Eixample district, it is a 5-minute walk from the hotel to La Pedrera.    

The room features a stylish black and white d√©cor theme that is also found in public areas.   It has a real bathroom, not a ‚Äújewel box‚Äù shower in the middle of an open concept bathroom with a toilet open to the wash basin.  There is a bench opposite the wash basin (which has a drawer for storage I did not discover until our second day).‚ÄØ The bidet and tub/shower can be closed off by using the sliding pocket door.‚ÄØThe AC is super quiet and efficient. The bed is wonderfully comfortable. The shades that cover the large floor to ceiling windows have wood shutters that can be opened and shades that close automatically. There is a settee at the base of the bed facing the 65"" TV.  There are outlets and light switches everywhere (bring your travel adapter).  Set an alarm ‚Äì we overslept ‚Äì the room is that quiet and comfortable. 

We took advantage of the gym and spa area ‚Äì because it is small, access is by appointment only.  The free circuit (sauna, steam, and pool) available to guests is a blessing to bodies worn from traveling.  We had the space to ourselves, an indulgent delight.   The spa treatments are reasonably priced. 

On the roof is a pool, various seating areas and a fragrant garden of plantings along the perimeter invites your senses to relax.  Small birds perch, eat berries and sing. 

We also heard bird songs in the outdoor dining area, which is covered by olive trees.  It is a relaxing and quiet area located behind the spacious lobby bar and the spotless indoor dining area.  The drinks and the food were excellent.  If a livelier dining experience is preferred, two well-regarded tapas places are across the street and a highly rated pizza restaurant is around the corner (Tip: In the gothic quarter, head for Viana).  A churreria and a small market on the corner both offer the supplies needed for day trips. 

It is the staff that makes the place special.  They are friendly, informative, and attentive.  I asked for flowers, cava, and a ham/cheese plate.  Arranging this surprise for my wife was easy and the tone of the email exchange was reassuring.  So, check the room menu when you make a reservation and surprise someone you love.   

We will return to this hotel whenever we are in Barcelona.   Next time we will take their tapas tour.  Next time‚Ä¶ ",5,2023,11,04
49,Very enjoyable stay,Great Hotel in a central location. Room was spacious and comfortable. Restaurant and Bar area full of life with a great buzz. Staff were friendly and helpful. Looking forward to our next visit to Barcelona. ,5,2023,11,03
49,Modern comfort!,"This hotel is  located in a nice and quiet part of Barcelona close to the shopping street of Passeo de Gracia. Clearly a new hotel with a modern style and plenty of light. It has a nice roof terrace , very well equipped and decorated; including a swimming-pool. You can already access it if you arrive before your room is available. The hall and the reception are ensuring first very good impressions. The rooms are also modern and relaxing, and fully equipped.On the ground floor there is a nice bar and a terrace with beautiful olive trees : top zen seating. Attractive lunch menu , good dishes , excellent service. The breakfast looked better than it tasted, so still room to improve offer. Overall a very good price/quality ratio for Barcelona.",4,2023,11,03
49,Great hotel excellent terrace,"Very nice, clean  and modern hotel. The breakfast had a great selection of pastries, breads, cereals, fruits, etc worth mentioning, the terrace. Full of mature trees and a small fountain. Just grab a coffee and a book and stay there the whole day! ",5,2023,11,02
49,A hidden gem in Barcelona,"We vacationed in Barcelona for three days after disembarking from a Mediterranean cruise. The hotel was modern, clean, in a good location that was near many restaurants and stores that you can easily walk to. The staff was friendly and provided excellent customer service. The rooftop pool and lounge were a nice additional feature. The hotel provides a luxurious, elevated experience.",4,2023,10,30
49,Just off the plane,"We had just landed from an overnight flight and they let us check in early at no extra charge, which was great! The location provided easy access for walking to all of the Barcelona city center highlights as well as a quiet and high value neighborhood restaurant for lunch. We enjoyed a free glass of Prosecco while listening to live music in the lobby, which was adjacent to a cool bar area. The room, while a bit small, was clean and tastefully decorated with high quality bedding that ensured a peaceful nights sleep. The breakfast buffet was also good. All-n-all, a good value.",4,2023,10,29
49,Not sure there is a better place to headquarter in Barcelona!,"Our ten days at Seventy were totally amazing.  The friendliness and helpfulness of the staff were thorough and friendly, and the service at the bar, at breakfast, and at the door, were all exemplary.  My only wish is that the bathtub/ shower were easier to get in and out of, and that the shower head was adjustable.  Just a small detail, though, and sure is not a game breaker, we would go back in a heartbeat!",5,2023,10,27
49,Nicest hotel we have ever been to!!,"My partner and I decided to stay at Seventy Barcelona during our recent trip to Barcelona, Spain. The staff and the hotel itself was such a treat! We arrived many hours before we were able to check-in at 3pm, but the staff was kind enough to let us hangout at the hotel before our room was ready. They had a luggage check as well, and it was very nice to hand them our luggage after carting them around for nearly 24hrs straight. This is a very beautiful hotel, with many beautiful spaces, inside and out. The rooftop terrace and pool was also excellent! 

Once we got checked in, we enjoyed the room immensely! The air conditioning worked very well, and the lighting in the room was very nice. The bed was exceptionally comfortable. The blinds have a mechanism that opens and shuts them automatically. Due to my fear of bedbugs in Europe right now, I immediately checked the bed and did not find anything. The room was spotless, and the shower the largest European showers I have ever seen! I think my only complaint is that the wifi is not good; comparable to 3G speeds or less. I could barely text people or get on social medias. Close to the metro, about a 5-7 minute walk. 

We ate dinner and breakfast at the restaurant, and the food was also top notch. I wish we'd had more time to spend in our hotel room, because it was very nice and very enjoyable. We would definitely stay here again if we're ever in Barcelona!",5,2023,10,26
49,40th Wedding Aniversary.,"We went to Seventy Barcelona to celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary.
They made our 5 day stay in Barcelona a holiday to remember, we were greeted with a  fabulous room with a bottle of champagne to celebrate our anniversary.
The hotel was wonderful and so were the staff, very friendly and helpful. 
The hotel was spotlessly clean, the food was good and the room was amazing. 
We enjoyed some relaxation between exploring Barcelona, in the spa and sunbathing by the rooftop pool.
The hotel is well situated in the centre of Barcelona and was easy to get around to visit all the sites.
All in all, I would recommend this hotel to my family and friends and would stay here again if I ever come back to Barcelona.",5,2023,10,26
49,Excellent hotel,Excellent service and location. We were very pleased with our stay at this hotel in October. The breakfast was great and the dinner had authentic Spanish food choices. The rooms are very comfortable and cozy,5,2023,10,26
49,Excellent hotel ,"Excellent!!!! Nice hotel, incredible design, personnel is very professional and reactive. 
The location is perfect, calm neighbourhood a walk away from shopping area. Breakfast service a bit slow but nothing major. 
The lobby and bar are awesome. 
",5,2023,10,26
49,Should be a 10!,"Seventy Barcelona was one of the best, most pleasurable hotel experiences we have ever had anywhere. It was the perfect way to start our vacation. There was a big sigh of relief when we walked into the hotel after an overnight flight and saw how lovely it was. The lobby is charming and conducive for relaxing or working. Check in was quick and easy and our luggage was in our room by the time we got to it. The rooms are spacious, very comfortable and well appointed. And very nice decor. 

The location could not have been better. We walked almost everywhere-I think we took a taxi one time at the end of the day, but otherwise walked. And coming ""home"" at the end of each day we headed straight to the wonderful bar. They fixed my husband a perfect martini every evening!!  It was very warm and inviting and we loved visiting with the bar tenders. They did an amazing job. 

We had breakfast every morning and it was delicious. Anything you could ever want and the outdoor courtyard was beautiful and relaxing. We never eat dinner at hotels, but we ate here twice-the first night and another night after we had taken a food tour and we didn't want a big meal. We also ate at Le Pepita and Tapas 2245. Both were delicious and fun. The front desk can make a res, although we weren't able to get one at LP, but we went anyway and were worked in.

Although everything was outstanding-food, drink, room, location etc., the main thing that made this hotel so amazing was the staff. Everyone was so nice and helpful and always smiling. They assisted with anything you needed with a smile on their face.

I highly recommend the Seventy. It will be one of the best hotel decisions you could ever make!!",5,2023,10,24
49,Perfect stay in Barcelona,"We absolutely loved Seventy Barcelona. We stayed here for our one-week honeymoon and it was a true oasis in the city. Compared to hotels in American cities, Seventy is an amazing quality for the price. I would say that you get double your money at this hotel than comparable hotels in the states. The hotel is beautiful and inviting, with high ceilings, wall-to-ceiling books, and a gorgeous bar and patio. We arrived a bit before check-in but didn't wait too long for our room and enjoyed a lovely lunch at the restaurant. The Seventy rooms are spacious by city standards, with big, comfy beds. The location can't be beat - walking distance to many bars and restaurants, including La Pepita, one of the city's best. Also right around the corner from two of Gaudi's masterpieces, Casa Mila and Case Battlo, plus only a 20 min walk to Sagrada Familia, and very close to the metro station. We didn't have the breakfast, but went to bar for drinks and tapas almost every night, always lively but not crowded. We also loved the spa's water circuit, which is included in your stay (appointment required, but we never had an issue with the times we requested). We used it everyday to unwind, and the hotel even gave us a full hour by ourselves with a bottle of cava as a gift for our honeymoon. The staff is attentive and helpful. Overall, absolutely wonderful and we will stay here again the next time we are in Barcelona. ",5,2023,10,24
49,Best Barcelona hotel! DON'T look anywhere else! ,"Best. Hotel. Ever.!!!
The service was top notch! From the moment Alessandre checked us in, to the moment we left, it was a pleasure to stay here! We would definitely recommend this hotel, and stay here again when returning to Barcelona! Rooms were extremely clean and roomy, amenities a plenty, a nice rooftop balcony, lots of bottles of water, comfy pillows and bed, and unlimited concierge services...
Alessandre and Valeria were the most professional, down to earth, friendly, and helpful people I've ever experienced at a hotel! They were 1st class! With fabulous recommendations for where to go, how to get there, and where the locals eat. The hotel was beautiful, and they fed you a wonderful breakfast each morning! Thank you again! ",5,2023,10,24
49,Our Amazing Stay,"This is my first time in Barcelona and in Spain. My friend and I chose this hotel because of the location and it had good reviews. 

The hotel and staff didn‚Äôt disappoint. We were greeted very nicely and the checkin process was very smooth.

The hotel is a boutique hotel so smaller but it‚Äôs beautifully decorated in the lobby area and breakfast and dining area.

What we really loved was the bar area. 

Very attentive and friendly bartenders took good care of us and made recommendations to places we could visit.

Alberto was our bartender for the first 2 nights that we were there. He was helpful, kind, and always polite in talking with us.  He was fun to talk to and made sure our glasses were full. üòâ

On Thursday night, they had an amazing singer.

Our rooms are also beautiful and the house keeper provided a shower cap when I needed one.

I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Barcelona. You will not be disappointed.",5,2023,10,23
49,Amazing experience,"It was a wonderful experience and I thank all the staff for their friendly welcome, especially the staff Ibrahim and Ahmed they were very helpful and professional, and one of the nicest details was the very high security in the hotel, I will definitely repeat the experience.",5,2023,10,23
49,Loved the Seventy Barcelona- from the USA,"Beautiful Hotel!
I loved the updated decor, service was great and the bed was super comfy. It was very spacious. The hotel itself is very chic. The walls are covered in fabric in the halls as well as the hotel rooms. The breakfast was very nice with a lot of options. We dined at the restaurant and the food was good. I would absolutely stay there again.  Word of Advice.... if you need to get a taxi the next day, you need to arrange it the night before.",5,2023,10,23
49,Great value for your money,"We were off to a bit of a rough start when we checked in, but ended up loving this hotel.  I would say one weakness is that they don't have a concierge and the people working the front desk are supposed to help you out with recommendations.  We found that most of the people working there were pretty new and didn't have a good grasp of the area.  Also, we had to check our bags since our rooms weren't ready when we arrived.  We came back quite a bit later and I was surprised they had not moved our bags into our room as they said they would.  Other than that, we had a great stay.  The hotel is incredible stylish.  The bed was one of the most comfortable I've ever experienced!  We really enjoyed the rooftop lounge area and were able to bring up our own drinks to pregame before dinner.  The hotel is a bit of a walk from most things, but we didn't mind.  We found the prices to be much better than some of the other hotels we looked at.  We would definitely stay there again!",5,2023,10,21
49,A Home Away from Home,"From the moment you step into the front lobby you just feel like you are home. They have made every effort for you to feel as if you are in a personal home as opposed to a stuffy hotel. Large ceiling windows, beckon you to sit and relax and read a book or sip a cool refreshing drink from the bar which is located near the entrance.  If you are lucky enough to be there on the weekends they have live entertainment in the bar area, where you can mingle with other guests and enjoy the music. 
We had the half board included in our reservation and I can't say enough about the food. The breakfast area is well laid out, with plenty of options to choose from. Fresh fruits, salads, eggs cooked to your specification, bacon, sausage, beans, an assortment of breads, pastries(including cheesecakes), cheese and deli boards along with a variety of yogurts, and cereals. The dinners were truly amazing and the portions are huge. Truly 1 portion is plenty for 2 people. If you are lucky enough try the truffle risotto, your taste buds will thank you. We stayed for 3 nights and I must say every meal was delicious. They have several options available and I defy anyone not to be able to choose something to their liking. 
The dining area is nicely decorated and inviting to seat in. They have made every attempt to make you feel comfortable, as if you were at a friends home enjoying a scrumptious meal. The patio is a perfect haven from the outside bustle of the city. They have made a truly tranquil place to sit and eat, or just to chill out and enjoy the well designed area. 
Now the bedrooms. OMG. your body just melts into the bed and the pillows make you feel like you are floating on clouds. Best sleep I have had in years. 
The staff were truly amazing and they go out of there way to ensure that your every need is met. We travel a lot and this is the first place that ticks off all the boxes. I encourage you to try this hotel, I guarantee you will not be disappointed. 
",5,2023,10,21
49,First Class,We are currently staying at the Seventy and the stay has been amazing. The rooms are well designed with everything included and some great touches. There was live music in the bar area last night which was an added bonus when enjoying a drink. We have also used both the spa and outdoor pool which were both great after exploring the city. We would definitely stay here again. Fabulous hotel.,5,2023,10,20
49,"Excellent Location, rooms and Fabulous Staff.","We chose hotel Seventy based on location and Tripadvisor reviews. We were not disappointed!
The hotel was modern, spacious and well designed. The rooms (we had a Seventy room on the 4th floor) ) were extremely comfortable and quiet with all amenities and enough space to comfortably open two suitcases.
The hotel's common areas were also very pleasant and well appointed. We enjoyed the  bar area, the rooftop pool area, the restaurant and courtyard.
We had breakfast at the restaurant every morning and it was fresh and varied and plentiful. There are also many great restaurants and tapas bars within a short walk from the hotel.
The staff are exceptional. Every single person we interacted with was friendly, helpful and seemed to really enjoy their job.
We had a late flight on the day we checked out but were able to store luggage and then freshen up in the Spa's bathrooms before leaving for the airport. This was greatly appreciated.
We would definitely choose Hotel Seventy if visiting Barcelona again.        ",5,2023,10,18
49,Great hotel!,"This is a lovely hotel with friendly, helpful staff. Our room was quiet and comfortable. It‚Äôs located within walking distance to good bakeries, tapas bars, and restaurants. There is also easy access to a Metro station that allowed us to move around easily during our four days in Barcelona. I would book this hotel again without hesitation.",5,2023,10,17
49,Oasis,"Strategically located for us; near restaurants we enjoy, the Placa del Sol we frequent, and small shops we explore. Also, a short taxi ride away from other neighborhoods.
Excellent staff; engaging, responsive. They went overboard to accommodate us.
Clean and well-appointed rooms with eco-sensitive amenities.
Tranquil central patio for taking a break complete with food and beverage service if desired.
Very comfortable place to ‚Äòcome home to‚Äô.
It is our place to stay in Barcelona.

49,Amazing hotel ,"Best Hotel we have ever stayed in, rooms/beds so cosy and comfortable, staff amazing, especially Adrian who has just recently joined the team, couldn't be more helpful, we will definitely stay at this hotel again, could not recommend it enough  5 star quality, thankyou Hotel Seventy for making our trip to Barcelona just amazing Mr&Mrs Whyte ",5,2023,10,15
49,Not cheap but worth every penny ,"Spotless hotel, great location, well appointed rooms, fabulous lobby bar, rooftop pool, spa and staff who couldn‚Äôt have been nicer. Stayed for my daughters 18th and will definitely be returning. Barcelona much busier in tourist areas than my last visit 20 years ago, online pre-booking of main attractions is a must if you don‚Äôt want to miss out. ",5,2023,10,13
49,Beautiful hotel,"We loved our short stay at Seventy Barcelona.  I wish that we could have spent more time at this beautiful, spotlessly clean hotel.  This hotel is in an excellent location.  It is extremely easy to walk to an array of restaurants, shoppes and many of Barcelona's top attractions.  The hotel staff is exceptional.  The rooftop pool is beautiful.  Breakfast is also excellent.  We would definitely stay at Seventy Barcelona again.",5,2023,10,13
49,Wonderful hotel experience,"Based upon reviews on Tripadvisor, we decided to stay at The Seventy for our first trip to Spain and Barcelona. We couldn't have been happier with our choice. The hotel is centrally located with a ton of restaurants within easy walking distance. We literally walked from the hotel to the cathedral and the harbor easily. The staff were incredible. My luggage didn't make the connection so I was without clothes and necessities for three days. The staff helped us find clothing stores to replenish my meager wardrobe. Likewise, the staff were always willing to help with suggestions and directions. We opted for the rate with the breakfast and we're glad we did. Breakfasts were amazing and omelettes were cooked to your liking with fresh additions. On our next trip to Barcelona, we will definitely stay at The Seventy again. ",5,2023,10,12
49,Our first visit to Barcelona to celebrate our Grandaughters 18th Birthday.,"Only visited the bar but from this experience and general comments from my Daughter who was staying at this Hotel I would certainly stay overnight even though the price is very much top end.
My Daughter stayed for 3 nights and couldn't fault the Hotel service or facilities with excellent food, comfy bed and rooftop swimming pool.
",5,2023,10,09
49,"Stay nowhere else, we love this hotel!","This place has it all. Where do I start? There is  attentive, thoughtful  staff, a rooftop swimming pool (small) and HUGE rooftop lounging area which spans all sides of the hotel AND a gorgeous spacious  leafy patio on which to get a first class breakfast. The bar is also great and has live music early evenings from Thurs -Saturday (with CeCe Giannotti playing on Thursday-amazing).  The hotel is new, beautiful and perfectly located. 
Hint, if you are going to the Familia Sagrada get tickets online as soon as you know your dates or go to the information booth and take what times they have avail. It is not to be missed!",5,2023,10,08
49,"Great hotel, convenient location.","Friendly service, fantastic location, beautifully designed rooms and reception area. I would definitely recommend. Beds were comfortable and the hotel services were solid. When I first arrived, I was amazed by the friendly service. I can‚Äôt wait to visit again.",5,2023,10,05
49,Seventy Bliss in Barcelona  ,"This is my fourth stay at Seventy this past summer, certainly my new go-to hotel in Barcelona. Each stay, from the moment you walk through the doors until the time you get back into a taxi on departure, the Seventy experience and their high standards are meticulous. What impressed me the most was the knowledge, perceptivity, and genuineness of every staff member, from the concierge team, the greeters, the restaurant staff, and the housekeeping team. Rapport is easy to build, and people at Seventy are quick to read cues to cater service to the individual. 

My favorite part about the atmosphere and the ambiance of the interior design is the outdoor terrace. The heavy marble tables contrasting the lazy movements of the olive trees invite you to linger on. The coffee station outside for breakfast encourages the indoor/outdoor Mediterranean lifestyle, emphasized by the beautiful dinnerware. From the bench style seating on the far side, the only reminder that you are in the middle of a metropolitan city are the cars that go by, if you focus on them past the bar and the foyer. They flash by, soundless, against the backdrop of the terrace's serene waterfall and perhaps the soft murmur of voices from other guests. An oasis for me in the city. 

Rooms are exceptionally comfortable and equipped with everything you need. Essential amenities are provided, including a bathrobe. Strategic plugs, bluetooth ceiling speakers, beautiful mirrors, and blackout shutters & blinds add to the ease and comfortability of staying here. There is plenty of storage to keep bags out of sight. Everything is impeccably clean and the housekeeping service is remarkably attentive and ultra-precise. 

I initially heard about this hotel through family friends and I highly recommend it as well. Seventy Hotel boasts a superb location, an inviting atmosphere, and a top-notch staff that collectively make it an outstanding choice for anyone visiting Barcelona.",5,2023,10,03
49,Well worth it,"This is a very comfortable, modern and conveniently located hotel.  The rooms were well appointed and the quietest we have stayed in anywhere in the world.  The staff were courteous and very helpful.  We really liked the roof terrace as well.  A very enjoyable stay and would recommend to anyone.",5,2023,10,02
49,So so good!,"Bliss from start to finish, beautiful rooms, clean and quiet. The roof top pool and spa are excellent. We had dinner in the patio area and it was one of our favourite meals in Barcelona. Will definitely be back thank you hotel seventy. Cannot wait to return!!!",5,2023,10,02
49,Seventy Barcelona,"A great modern hotel to stay at in central Barcelona. We spent four days here and could not fault a thing. Everything from our room, the restaurant/ bar spa area to the wonderful roof terrace was  faultless. The staff (especially those in the reception area and foyer) were fantastic and made our trip something special. The hotel is also situated in a perfect location to explore the city and is also within easy walking distance of many of the main tourist attractions. Would highly recommend. ",5,2023,09,30
49,Initial take is disappointing relative to hotel‚Äôs reputation,"Small room but great lights and plugs, desk. Good for one person on a business trip. Late night room service? Not really.  Cold meats and cheese.  No drinks after 11.  Plan ahead as if you arrive late from travel and aren‚Äôt on a protein program it is extremely limited.  Minibar has only potato chips üò¢ 
I guess it makes you want to buy that breakfast!!",3,2023,09,26
49,Perfect stay at the Seventy,"I did A LOT of research before deciding on a hotel for the Barcelona portion of our honeymoon. We spent four nights at the Seventy and could not have been happier with this choice. Upon walking in, we were greeted by friendly staff who offered a glass of cava and went through the check in process. Our room was on the third floor and it was beyond expectations. We looked into a large courtyard. It was quiet for sleeping. The room had good closet space for clothing and luggage so it was out of sight. The bed was very comfortable with good quality linens. We used the water features at the spa on two days and wished we‚Äôd had more time to use them every day. It was a very relaxing way to end the day before getting ready for dinner. The staff at the hotel helped us book tickets for Sagrada Familia when we missed our original booking due to a long flight delay. They also ordered us a taxi for an early morning ride to the airport on the day we left. Most thoughtful was sending a bottle of cava to our room with a note to enjoy our honeymoon. We didn‚Äôt eat or have drinks at the hotel but the restaurant and bar looked just as nice as the rest of the property.",5,2023,09,20
49,nice hotel in a nice neighbourhood,"The staff was friendly and welcoming.  The room was clean with a huge tv with a few English news channels.  The bed and pillows were thick and comfortable.  The shower was large but water leaks.  My room was on the 5th floor with a view of a nice building across the street.  The rooftop got a nice swimming pool and a nice view.  I could see the Sagrada Familia from the rooftop.  There are quite a few places to eat such as pizza places, bakeries, churros cafe and tapas bars within walking distances.  The metro is a few minute walk away and the walk to the fancy shopping street is also a few minutes walk away.    There are many stores and restaurants on the street.  I had a lovely stay and would return. Cost of taxi to airport was 33 euros and to cruise port was 17 euros.",4,2023,09,19
49,Great Hotel,"Stayed here for one night in Barcelona! This property opened in 2019, and then was automatically closed in 2020. So it‚Äôs quite new. It‚Äôs a nice hotel and equivalent to the JW Marriott properties in the States. Make sure you get the breakfast that comes with the hotel. It‚Äôs lovely and have a lot of food to offer.",4,2023,09,19
49,Beautiful Hotel,"We stayed at the hotel for three nights.

The staff are extremely attentive and friendly.  We were given two adjoining rooms for our family that had a separate, locked entryway, which made for a very nice and secure stay.  Our rooms were on the 2nd floor, facing the road.  I was initially concerned about noise.  While you can hear some muffled street noise during the day, none was perceptible during the night.

The entire hotel is very well-maintained and the rooms are quite impressive.

The breakfast area is spacious and inviting.  The food selection is not extensive, but it offers the basics.

The hotel is located slightly away from the tourist action, so it is much calmer.  It is a three block walk to the subway station and there are restaurants within walking distance.

My one constructive suggestion would be that the desk staff should be provided with a list of restaurants to recommend to guests.  It was notable that the staff were extremely friendly, but had little familiarity with restaurants in the area.",5,2023,09,16
49,Hidden gem in Barcelona,"My husband and I stayed at the Seventy  Barcelona at the first part of our 2 weeks or traveling around Spain ,  We loved the hotel so much that booked it again for the last 2 night before heading back to New York it was like a home away from home , let me start by saying it‚Äôs a trendy hip hotel with great design ! the rooms are super quiet which I loved , comfortable beds great shower great amenities in the room for the ladies they have a flat iron for your hair which I thought was great thinking !! Breakfast was amazing lots of choices and you can sit out in the beautiful backyard with amazing trees  I couldn‚Äôt get enough of that ! The major bonus was the beautiful spa that you can use everyday worth the extra money for that room category ! It‚Äôs was much needed after walking all day and we looked forward to coming back to that after the whole day ! The location was great 5 min walk to Paseo de Gr√†cia ! Beautiful 5th Ave stores and restaurants , but I must  say the staff was the highlight of the hotel ! They are really sweet and welcoming!! Very informative and always ready to help with any requests they helped us with tours and restaurant recommendations and where always great !! we felt so comfortable with them we left some things there with no hesitation while we traveled around Spain knowing our things would be safe when we returned from our travels  ! Definitely a hidden gem I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to book this hotel !! One last note when arrived late after long flight and exhausted .. Boris at the front desk recommended la Pepita right across the street definitely a must ! Great food ,vibe and great prices !! Can‚Äôt wait to go back ! Will definitely stay at seventy hotel next time we come to Barcelona ! Thank you again to the amazing staff !!",5,2023,09,11
49,Perfect Hotel,"What an awesome hotel! We spent the second half of our honeymoon here and loved it. Great location, awesome staff, and the room was beautiful. We stayed in a first floor room with a patio terrace which was perfect for aperitivo. The rooftop pool is really nice with comfy sun beds and good drinks. My husband celebrated his birthday on our last night and Valeria organized tapas and cava on the house which was such a thoughtful touch. We will absolutely stay here again and are already lining up my parents trip to Barcelona! Thank you Seventy! ",5,2023,09,10
49,Midweek break,"My wife and I stayed here from 6th of September for 3 nights the hotel was fantastic. 
The staff here were friendly and attentive to anything you needed. 
We had breakfast every morning which was great value and a wide choice. 
The room was spacious and well designed we found the bed very comfortable and loved the pillows,shower was ok and  would have been nice to have a few draws we ask for more coat hangers which wasn‚Äôt a problem. 
The pool was a nice place to chill out we also went the spa twice. 
We ate in the restaurant one evening which was nice food was good and not expensive had lunch on our last day outside which was lovely. 
One thing I would also say that impressed me was we had a late flight on our last day we were able to use all the facilities with no pressure to leave.
Would definitely stay here again and recommend it. 
Thank you for our stay.",5,2023,09,09
49,Excellent Hotel,"Seventy exceeded all of our expectations. Valencia at the front desk was super helpful and had great recommendations for local bars. The hotel is very walkable to major sites like Casa Batll√≥ and Casa Mila, as well as great bars and restaurants. Comfortable beds, good sized rooms, a beautiful pool area, and a cool vibe in the lobby. We really couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better spot for our stay in Barcelona.",5,2023,09,07
49,"Stylish, beautiful hotel","A beautiful, stylish hotel in Barcelona

we stayed at the Seventy the second time. It is a wonderful furnished hotel ( by famous architect Louis Bustamente) that offers all you need in this exciting city - great rooms, a beautiful lobby, a good restaurant, a pool on the roof, a spa, very friendly staff - it is my favorite at the moment.",5,2023,09,06
49,Perfect couples hotel to explore the city,"On my recent escapade to Barcelona, I had the fortune of staying at the Seventy hotel, and it truly was a delightful experience. Conveniently located in the heart of this spirited city, the hotel‚Äôs prime position grants guests immediate access to lively bars, eclectic shops, and Barcelona's emblematic tourist destinations.

From my very first interaction at check-in, the staff exuded warmth and professionalism. They provided invaluable local insights and their friendly demeanour was a consistent highlight throughout my stay. The bar staff, in particular, ensured my evenings were memorable with their well-priced, expertly mixed cocktails and the occasional live music performances.

One of the hotel's standout features was its rooftop pool. It offers a splendid retreat, especially during good weather, where you can kick back and soak up the sun with the city's skyline as your backdrop. For those keen on keeping up with their fitness routine, they have a compact gym, which, despite its size, boasts well-maintained equipment suitable for a decent workout (be aware it is very small!). Additionally, a rejuvenating dip in their spa pool, which guests can book for a free 30-minute session, added a touch of luxury to my stay. I used the pool each day I was there, and there was never more than 2 other people using it at the time. There is also a sauna and steam room available. 

Room-wise, while not overly spacious, they are adeptly designed, providing all essential comforts. The beds are particularly commendable, ensuring a peaceful slumber after a day out and about.

In summary, Seventy isn't just a hotel; it encapsulates the essence of a Barcelona stay with its amenities and services. If you're planning a trip to this enchanting city, Seventy is a top contender for a holistic experience. I‚Äôm be sure to return",5,2023,09,05
49,Exceptional hotel.,"One of the best I stay in 
Service was exceptional in all aspects 
I have been in many 5 star hotels that are not coming close .
This is the best 4 star I ever stayed in. 
Breakfast was excellent. 
Rooms were clean .spa was the only place it can use a change .no lounge  to relax with drinks and snacks before the treatment avg massage .
Again, to me, the service was exceptional.

49,"Nice hotel, great location.","I chose this after reading many reviews. The hotel is in a great location. The bed was super comfortable. The room had good soundproofing. We got a nice welcome snack & some toiletries. As other reviews have said, the lobby area is lovely, lots of comfy sofas, the rooftop is very cool, the pool (we did not try it), would be refreshing when it is hot. The breakfast was nice with lots of choice. The outdoor garden area is nice, we could not use it as it was raining. The spa is in the basement level, no natural light but ok for the 30 minutes you can use it. The gym is small & is a glass box, I found that a bit odd. The staff are in two camps, either very helpful or not, as if you are inconveniencing them by asking something, the receptionist who checked us in was not at friendly, kind of a prerequisite when working on a hotel front desk . I had a few enquiries & they looked things up on google or simply didn‚Äôt know, for this type of hotel I would expect more. All in all we had a nice stay, but did not feel especially valued as a guest which for this type of hotel & price was disappointing.",4,2023,09,02
49,My first choice every time,"I booked a week in a Seventy room for myself and my BFF to celebrate our 50th birthdays. We met in Barcelona in the only week that a heatwave hit the city but that didn‚Äôt stop us from having an amazing time. The hotel is wonderfully cool inside with navy blue and cream surroundings on the room floors. The carpets are thick and lush and everything is beautifully tidy and clean. There is a mosaic outside patio covered in olive trees with a bar and a swimming pool with lots of comfortable seating, plush pillows and shade on a decked top floor including a bar that serves drinks and posh snacks. The ground floor has a lovely bar with amazing and wonderful staff in particular (but not limited to) Alberto and Matteo made our frequent visits lively and fun. They mixed special cocktails for us on request and got it right every time. The hotel is decked out in luxury and every nook and cranny were stunning and very tastefully decorated. Wifi was amazingly good but have to say there were only two English TV channels ie Sky news and BBC world news.  The linen was starched, the pillows plump and the beds super comfy. The reception staff were all knowledgeable and friendly and helpful - nothing was too much to ask. The hotel is situated in Eixample area of Barcelona which is safe and clean. The closest metro is Diagonal on the L3 light green line and takes about 40-60 mins from the airport on the metro at ‚Ç¨5.50 per single journey which I thought was good value for money. The restaurants in the area are all pretty good albeit expensive mostly. Please see my reviews on restaurants in the area - I reviewed each and every one we visited. I absolutely love this hotel and if I ever get the chance to visit again, Seventy would be my first choice - 5 stars from me. Would absolutely definitely recommend.",5,2023,08,31
49,It will always be our option in Barcelona.,"Beautiful hotel, very tastefully decorated, it is a delight for the eyes. Polite and solicitous staff, the room we stayed in was excellent with a great view of the city. Breakfast is good, with good options. The spa is sensational and well worth a visit. The cleanliness of the room I would say 9/10. The only thing that I was a little disappointed with was the amenities in the room, even though I think the hotel's initiative to try to be more sustainable is very cool, I think the options could be better. It is worth mentioning that the location of the hotel is perfect.",4,2023,08,27
49,Amazing Stay!!,"I had an exceptional stay at Seventy in Barcelona! The level of assistance we received from the staff was truly outstanding. Not only were the rooms superb, but Benjamin's exceptional service went above and beyond my expectations. The attention to detail and genuine care made my experience truly memorable. From the moment I arrived, I felt welcomed and valued as a guest. The hotel's convenient location allowed me to explore the city with ease, and the comfortable rooms provided a relaxing retreat after a day of sightseeing. Our time at Seventy was made extraordinary by the dedicated staff and impeccable accommodations. I will be returning for sure on my next visit to Barcelona.",5,2023,08,27
49,Great Experience,"I had a remarkable experience at the Seventy Hotel in Barcelona. From the moment I arrived, their staff's exceptional level of assistance truly stood out. The rooms were not only comfortable but also exquisitely designed, providing a cozy retreat after a day of exploring the city. However, what truly made my stay exceptional was Benjamin, a staff member who went above and beyond to ensure that every aspect of my visit was perfect. His dedication to guest satisfaction was evident in his attention to detail and his willingness to go the extra mile. The Seventy Hotel is a true gem in Barcelona, and I can't wait to return to this haven of hospitality and comfort.",5,2023,08,27
49,Highly Recommend! Exceeded my expectations!,"This was one of the BEST hotels I‚Äôve EVER stayed in! From the stunning interior, to the incredible service from all staff & not to mention the luxurious day spa, this hotel truly exceeded my expectations.

49,Flawless hotel,"It is almost impossible to fault this hotel - it is just stunning.

49,Amazing stay at Seventy Barcelona,"We had such a lovely stay at this hotel. This hotel is lush! The decor is amazing, staff are friendly and love that it has a spa and rooftop terrace with a pool! You can easily get around by walking, the metro or taking a taxi. 

The breakfast was so good! There is a wide selection. Something for everyone. We also had dinner included in our package. The dinner menu was lovely and the food was delicious! 

I would definitely recommend this hotel for a short break. ",5,2023,08,13
49,Choose Seveny!,"This hotel was amazing! Me and my partner stayed at the seventy room on the third floor and really enjoyed it. 

The staff was very helpful. Loved the spa and the pool. Breakfast was excellent, especially the pancakes and the ginger drink alternatives.

The room is spacious, clean and comfortable. Love the decor and overall feel. 

Breakfast spread is good with a beautiful patio dining experience. 

Not much encounter with the staff but generally friendly. 

Lovely place.",5,2023,08,09
49,Boutique hotel experience that shines bright in Barcelona ,"Our stay at the seventy Barcelona was everything we hoped for. We had great expectations after postponing during covid. We couldn't wait to go back to one of our favorite cities and experience this hotel

The modern layout, interiors, finishes and spa & pool areas are thoughtfully designed. The room layouts (lounge terrace)  compact room on floor 1 & we loved having our own outdoor dining area & ( the suite) we stayed 1 night and if you can, just stay for the bathroom alone its above all else (literally).

But the most important part of our stay was the staff who were attentive, kind & engaged. A special thank you to Marcos, Carlos & Matteo who made sure everything was working well for us during our stay. That to us is service, it showed up in little ways, like remembering we wanted extra strong coffee, to delivering room.service to our room with everything we needed to eat on our terrace, to always having staff present in reception to answer any questions and to a great team at the Spa - special mention to Jenny and her team.

Celebrating our wedding anniversary here was a wonderful experience. We are looking forward to returning

The spa with swimmingpool and sauna are a great way of relaxing.

The bar with skilled barpersonnel is also excellent for a cocktail or coffee. 

The hotel is greatly placed near town with lots of options for public transport or a quick taxi. 

Gracias por todo y hasta la pr√≥xima!

49,Affordable Luxury,"The hotel is luxurious in all the right ways. The money is spent on the rooms (tranquil, spacious, well lighted, thoughtfully laid out, comfortable beds and chairs, shower that you can stretch out in with controls that don't require a PhD). Staff courteous and friendly without being unctuous or underfoot. Located just inside the Gracia neighborhood and not yet over run by shop assistants and barrow boys on holiday. The one pull in the wool, is that the books on display in the reception, are not real. Anthony Powell would be disappointed.",5,2023,08,02
49,Great location in Barcelona,"Lovely hotel. Great breakfast. In a good safe district walking distance from shopping. Staff very helpful in reception. Pool area was used a lot, was good to unwind after days sightseeing. Little improvements could be made, like fluffier towels, air con in lifts and a wider variety for breakfast for the 5 stars. But would recommend and stay again.",4,2023,08,02
49,Lovely Stay,"We loved staying in Seventy Barcelona. The decor was contemporary and the rooms were beautiful. The bed, pillows and shower were terrific. The reception staff - Valeria, Natalia and everyone else - was very helpful. We had lunch twice in their restaurant which was reasonable and tasty and the breakfast buffet was great everyday. We were very comfortable here and definitely recommend this hotel!",5,2023,07,28
49,Wheelchair accessibility at Seventy Hotel,"Hello! 

A group of 10 travellers and I stayed at the Hotel Seventy this past June 2023. It was an amazing experience, the staff of the hotel is incredible, they understood all of the needs we had. 5 of the travellers where wheelchair users, and the the hotel accommodated all of the rooms, according to what they needed. 

We set with them the bed lift in two rooms, as well as all of the shower chairs in every bathroom. The staff accommodated every room according to what we told them ( separate the beds, install bed raisers when needed). 
The facilities are all wheelchair accessible, they have a pool lift ( which if you need it you need to ask for it in advance to install it) as well as a lift to transfer to their spa poool. 

The breakfast space is the same for lunch and dinner, and it is so peaceful and beautiful, with the outside terrace, which makes you believe that you are in a little forest instead of in the center of Barcelona. You can easily stroll around the breakfast space, and you have different table options according to what height you need. 

The location is wonderful, just really close to Passeig de Gracia, what makes it easy to stroll around and do some shopping. 

10 OUT OF 10, thank you Laia, Benja, Osman, all of the staff, every breakfast, lunch, dinner, night out, your help has been amazing, and your attitude even better. I would not think it twice, stay at this hotel!!!! All of the facilities are brand new, and it is so clean.

",5,2023,07,27
49,More like Heaventy! Bravo!,"Only stayed one night, but wish it could have been longer! Great hotel, super modern and very elegantly detailed, from the grand reception to the well-kept halls and rooms. I was very comfortable in my room, good sized bed and a great shower. For me what they do well here is the service and attention to detail. I must also mention the rooftop pool, which looked great, especially on those hot summer days, super nice beach vibe in the middle of Barcelona's rooftops. The location too was central with many of the must-see attractions just a walk away. Cannot wait to return for pleasure next time. ",5,2023,07,27
49,Excellent ,"There are just too many great things about this hotel to be able to list into one review. The staff are lovely and extremely helpful. The pool area is relaxing and a great retreat from the hustle and bustle that is Barcelona. The location of the hotel is second to none, as it is close to many restaurants, caf√©s, bars and shopping. This is truly a great urban vacation spot. 
Our room was very well appointed and extremely comfortable. 
Although we are not big  breakfast people,  we did decide to have the breakfast buffet one morning, and it was exceptional and held in very beautiful courtyard. 
The bartenders were also great, and had very good suggestions for dinner.
All in all, this is a great hotel in a great location with great employees. ",5,2023,07,25
49,An excellent experience ,"We stayed in a terrace room. Great location. Really impressed with the room. A great size and all needs catered for. The terrace was a great space to sit out. Rooms were quiet, clean and maintained to a high standard. Didn't use the gym and spa facilities so can't comment. All staff very helpful and available without being intrusive. General areas kept very clean and well presented. Good room service selection and great interactive hotel information on the TV. Definitely recommended when staying in Barcelona. ",5,2023,07,24
49,The best stay,"One of our favorite hotel experiences ever! We stayed here for our honeymoon and were so comfortable from start to finish. The staff also surprised us with a free one-hour spa appt, complete with complimentary champagne, fruit, and chocolate. Everyone was kind, cheery, and welcoming and made us feel very at home. Great location, beautiful clean facilities, and amazing rooftop pool, too. Would def recommend. Gracias, Seventy!!!",5,2023,07,23
49,Wonderful Hotel,Trendy hotel. Great staff. Bartenders very warm and receptive. Wonderful pool on roof that was welcomed during the hot afternoons. Lighting in rooms was a challenge so ask for a tutorial. Pretty cool place located close to a lot of activity,5,2023,07,22
49,Best experience :),"I can't be happier with my experience. I'm Maia, Group Tour Leader from Wheel the World and I am so grateful about how the people from Seventy helped us with everything. They are always with a smile and willingness to help. Specially Benja, Laia and Oscar where there for us all the time and really gave everything to help us. They helped a lot in terms of accessibility and organization of the rooms. Helping to take the luggage to the rooms and making the travelers feel safe and like home. No more words than thank you and hope come back some day! :) ",5,2023,07,21
49,Best service ever! The worry free travel!,"We stayed there 5-6 nights, three times with 10 travelers each time, 30 in total. We were there for work, accompanying travelers from Wheel the World (a company that offers tourism for people with disabilities). Every day we were in and out multiple times, we had complex requests all the time and the truth is that it was a really amazing experience. Benjamin, Ousman, Laia, Rebeca, Lore and all the people working there took care of us really well. Always everyone with a smile and very good will. Also I could talk about how good was the food for breakfast and dinner and how nice, comfortable and accessible the hotel and its rooms are. 
Thank you very much to all the Seventy team, a big hug.

Maia, Joanna and Cris from Wheel the World",5,2023,07,18
49,Amazing,"The staff is very caring. They are willing to help with whatever you may need and are concerned. The breakfast is good. Variety of food. Very healthy and had gluten free options. L The rooms are clean we enjoyed the hotel. Great customer service. High end. Would highly recommend

49,Best in Barcelona,Seventy it‚Äôs an amazing hotel in a great location. The staff is professional and approachable (especially Valeria). The rooms are stylish and well designed (patio terrace was very peaceful and the sky room had an amazing view over Tibidabo). The common is space is well designed. The spa area could be improved to make it more cosy (and the spa pool could be warmer). Looking forward to stay there again.,5,2023,07,10
49,"Superb, highly recommended","I found this gem here on Tripadvisor and I'm glad I did - it really is superb. Previously I'd stayed at the W of The Arts, but I'd choose this for my next trip.

The design of the lobby, bar, and breakfast area is sharp, modern, and very cool indeed. Reception are quick and inefficient. The rooms are comfortable and modern, good black out blinds. Breakfast was in a gorgeous outdoor area and although not a huge range, it felt special. Rooftop pool again not massive, is a lovely sun trap.

It's a little walk into the centre of town and the beach, but the walk itself is a pleasure. 

Really well done to the hotel management for an exceptionally high consistent experience. ",5,2023,07,07
49,Very Positive Experience with Barcelona & the 70,"Very modern & attractive hotel in a great location.  We walked to four outstanding restaurants within less than 15 minutes from the hotel.  Very nice breakfast buffet.  Bed & pillows were super comfortable. Liked being able to lower the the window shutters at night. Our reservations were incorrectly cancelled by the travel agency we were working with so we had a bad surprise when we tried to check in.  Fortunately, the manager was super accommodating & despite the hotels capacity booking, was able to get rooms for us.  He and the other hotel staff were very professional accommodating.   ",5,2023,07,02
49,Beautiful hotel,We had a great stay at Seventy Hotel Barcelona. The staff is attentive and we had a wonderful stay here. The architecture and ambience is positive here. Breakfast is having a variety of food items. The staff at restaurant is also proactive. All in all a great four star hotel in a great location.,5,2023,07,01
49,Wonderful modern hotel in a wonderful city,"Two potential disasters turned into a terrific stay of 5 nights in Barcelona at this well-located hotel which has the best manager we have ever known.  In a very calm and reassuring manner and despite the initial negative responses from front desk staff, he resolved problems with our initial reservation for 3 nights (which had been cancelled without our knowledge by the booking agent) and then, after our flight home was cancelled, was able to keep us in our original room for 2 more.  

The hotel has very modern decor, comfortable beds, good air-conditioning, a spa that we were never able to use and a rooftop pool and bar that was a place to recover from our sightseeing trips.  The buffet breakfast which had essentially the same items every day included made-to-order omelets or fried eggs.  We were disappointed that the courtyard seating did not open for breakfast seating until 9am, which was too late for us to enjoy with our tour schedule.

All the hotel staff was very friendly and mostly helpful. Laundry service was quick and easy to use.  The hotel‚Äôs recommendations for restaurants and tour guide were excellent.

Definitely would stay here again if we return to Barcelona.",5,2023,07,01
49,Great experience,We‚Äôve just got back from a 4 night stay at Seventy Barcelona and we were really sad to leave! The hotel is gorgeous and the staff are lovely; they couldn‚Äôt do more for you. We felt very welcome and looked after. The food at the hotel is delicious (breakfast and dinner) and the bar and bar staff were fantastic. The roof terrace is great and the spa is lovely for a break from the sun! Would definitely recommend this hotel for anyone visiting Barcelona!,5,2023,07,01
49,A Gem of a Stay,"What can I say but WOW! Seventy Barcelona is an incredible find, I'm almost afraid to write this evaluation, because I don't want to let the cat out of the bag! From check-in to check-out, everything is impeccable. Our room was on the larger side for an in-city hotel and the bed, sheets and towels are amazing. The location is ideal; away from the Ramblas crowds, but close to Gracia, Sagrada Fam√≠lia and tons of great restaurants. The ground floor patio/bar area is great and the food and drinks are top notch. We opted not to get the daily breakfast (‚Ç¨22/day) but it looked excellent. The rooftop is a peaceful oasis and the pool was delicious.
All of this for around ‚Ç¨525 for three nights. I can't imagine a better cost/benefit in Barcelona.
Keep up the good work, Seventy! We'll be back soon!",5,2023,06,29
49,Gr√©√¢t h√¥tel,"Great sized rooms, fantastic breakfast choice in a modern luxury surroundings. Roof top pool & bar so clean & place to relax & enjoy the sun. Enjoyed an evening meal here too. Rooms were comfortable & staff were attentive & welcoming ",5,2023,06,20
49,Seventy is worth it!,"Beautiful, modern and clean room, wonderful restaurant food, friendly staff, fantastic location.  This property in downtown Barcelona was such a welcome for us after a 7-hour flight. The front doorman had a warm smile and greeting and the front desk staff were so helpful and friendly. The lounge where we sat is filled with a library and comfy seating. We chose to try lunch in the lovely outdoor patio at the hotel while we waited for our room. The food and drinks were fantastic! Truly delicious. The bar is great, too (though they tend to close around 11:30 earlier in the week). Our room was clean, modern and spacious with a king bed and lovely bath. We dipped in the swimming pool which is located on the rooftop and is complete with large towels, tables, umbrellas and bar. The doorman at the front got us taxis easily, and we walked to many city sights which are very close. There is also a popular tapas restaurant directly across the street called, Pepitas, which was delicious. I highly recommend Seventy would book it again.",5,2023,06,20
49,An absolute gem in the heart of Barcelona! A 4 star hotel that feels like 5 stars!,"We're a couple who went to Barcelona to see Beyonce perform and stayed at the hotel for 5 nights total. 

- The location of the hotel is fantastic and the design of it is absolutely magnificent. The back courtyard where the breakfast is held is magical and somehow gives your the feeling you're in the countryside as it is full of olive trees, fountains, beautiful tiles decorating the floors and lots and lots of greenery.  

- We got the room with the terrace and were able to enjoy the good weather by catching some sun and even have late night deserts and drinks on the outdoor dining table. 
Only thing that we would improve in the room is the shower. The shower head is pretty far from impressive and doesn't align with the very high standards of the rest of the amenities in the room. (i.e. the smart toilet, electric blinds, and so on.) 

- The staff was extremely kind and gracious, helping us with whatever we needed and always with a smile, especially Boris at the front desk.
We arrived hours before the expected check in and the staff immediately made us feel the most welcome by speeding up our check in time, taking care of our luggage and even providing us with coffees on the house. Even the lady at the breakfast area began to remember our orders at some point and would offer us stuff we wanted before we could even ask for them. 
Lastly, we had the pleasure of meeting Benjamin, a manager at the hotel who was nothing short of amazing and professional. 

- There's also a rooftop pool with a bar service and a spa at -1 with very nice saunas (both wet and dry) and even an ice room for you to cool down after. 

to conclude, we would highly recommend this hotel, without a doubt. It's a 4 star hotel with a price and feeling of 5.",5,2023,06,16
49,Bed and pilllow of dreams,"This hotel exceeded expectations! And I have high expectations. Felt like a 5* hotel. The pillows and bed was the most comfortable I have ever experienced. I slept all the way through and didn‚Äôt move once. I have 5 year old twins so this was possibly the best bit of my trip the Barcelona. I even asked if I could buy a pillow. where can I buy them, please?!",5,2023,06,13
49,Luxurious experience,"We had a magical five-day stay on our honeymoon. The hotel went out of its way to make our visit special and we couldn‚Äôt have asked for more. The facility is top quality and in a great location. Plus, it is definitely worth spending time at the pool and spa. It was an ideal visit.",5,2023,06,13
49,Looking forward to returning!,Very comfortable and clean room in fantastic area. I was forced to move from my hotel in the old city because of a water leak--I liked this hotel much more. Lovely restaurant and surrounding neighborhood. ,5,2023,06,10

49,Smoking area not for smoking!!!,"Excellent service from all staff but the restaurant manager on the laptop was less than attentive to be honest, let down the team to be honest. 

Went out side to smoke (cigar) and was removed from smoking area and made to sit in shade at bottom of patio away from everyone, even though we had sat at a smoking table. Crazy. 

Bar prices silly money, venture out. ",5,2023,06,10
49,Wonderful!,"Stay here! We're so happy that we did. Quality and service were wonderful, location was great. About 30 min from the airport from either taxi or public transportation (we used Uber) and easy to walk around from. It was nice to be able to use their spa pool each day (with reservation) and while we didn't get to use the rooftop (pool) much, we wandered up one evening and it was beautiful. The restaurant & bar they have onsite is very good, and the breakfast buffet was totally worth it. The decor was lovely, and the room especially felt very upscale. Water pressure & temperature in the shower was lovely which we have found while traveling is not always the case depending on the hotel floor. AC is a must, so happy they had! Wish the TV had an option for English subtitles or more than 10 (35-45ish on the channel list) of English speaking channels, but its not like we were there to watch TV all day. We would love to stay again when we return!",5,2023,06,01
49,Trendy and thoughtfully designed in a great location.,Seventy is visually appealing and the rooms are beautifully and thoughtfully designed and with very comfortable bedding. I particularly appreciated the blackout shades that left the room totally dark. A lovely outdoor restaurant with good food makes for a convenient and tasty meal if you don't feel like heading out. Friendly and helpful staff complete the picture for a restful stay in Barcelona.,5,2023,05,29
49,Great modern  hotel with fantastic team at every turn.,"Entire hotel team was fantastic and this modern hotel in a great location has every comfort (large rooms, great food and bar, comfortable beds in larger rooms.). 

Roselyn Alverto Aurelian was especially helpful during several family events in the bar and pool areas.  Very  attentive, friendly, available whenever we needed her, and eager to take care of every need. Made a large positive difference in our stay. ",5,2023,05,29
49,You need to stay here...it's worth it!,"Seventy Barcelona was a perfect home away from home. The facility is modern but comfortable and the staff take pride in their work. We were with another couple there for 5 nights and had a wonderful experience. The rooms are designed nicely and the beds are outstanding! The closest thing we've found to our bed at home so needless to say, we got plenty of sleep! My husband loved having a modern bidet in our bathroom and the water pressure if the best of anywhere we've stayed...even better than what we have at home. Breakfast was probably the nicest/biggest breakfast we've had anywhere-make sure to upgrade to the breakfast option...I promise you won't regret it! We dined in their restaurant twice-both times the food was hot, fresh, and perfectly cooked! If we decide to return to Barcelona, we will be staying at this facility! ",5,2023,05,28
49,Bachelorette trip,"One of the best hotels we stayed in. The experience is just top notch, from the first welcome with the concierge, welcome drinks, they made the entire experience just amazing. The spa pool available for 30 minutes (which includes the sauna), they also have a roof top pool, not to mention they have live singers, trivia / wine tasting for guests. It was just such a wonderful experience, I would 100% go back here. The staff will go above and beyond to make your stay enjoyable. The staff is so genuinely caring and enjoy their jobs, which makes a big difference.  ",5,2023,05,27
49,"pleasantly surprised, highly recommend seventy Barcelona!","hotel staff at reception and restaurant were very friendly. we reached a little earlier than expected. although our rooms were not ready, we were ushered to the restaurant to have some tea and snacks while we were briefed with a map to where we should go for some sightseeing. we went out and came back, one room was ready but the other was not. the surprise came with an upgraded room. we could not get the air con to work but the staff was really quick to come to the rooms to resolve the issue. it was a pleasant stay and rooms are very clean and comfortable.",5,2023,05,27
49,Good spot,Very stylish hotel with very nice staff. Especially Param at the reception is a real asset. Any questions about Barcelona-ask him. Any help concerning the hotel-ask him. Breakfast is self service and very good. Bar nice place. Good location,5,2023,05,26
49,Excellent Hotel Stay !!,"Great Professional service and staff
Felt totally pampered!!  We were here for our sons wedding and we loved the amenities and location. Will definitely stay here again and recommend that everyone stay here",5,2023,05,26
49,The best service in town!,"This hotel is conveniently located, modern, clean with a staff that you don't find these days. The property was perfect for our needs, but the staff elevated our stay to exceptional. Val at the front desk, while single handedly manage the front desk, treated us like family and then added us to a tapas tour she had arranged for a small group of hotel guests. We had the best time!

The first day, we were early and could not get into our room. Borja at the bar made us two perfect cups of coffee, gave us some restaurant ideas and then continued to look out of us during the week making sure we were well taken care of.

Those two stood out, but quite honestly 100% of the staff was friendly, helpful and professional. I won't stay anywhere else when I come back to Barcelona, which I hope is very soon!",5,2023,05,24
49,Wonderful experience!,"Seventy was a wonderful, boutique-style hotel. The service was excellent from the moment you get out of the cab to the moment you leave your stay. The concierge was exceptional in ensuring I had all the information and resources I needed. Valeria was particularly helpful and accommodating and made my stay that much more enjoyable as she shared areas around the city to visit! I will definitely be staying here when I visit Barcelona again.",5,2023,05,21

4 star that feels more like 5 star in so many ways.

Fantastic rooms...great size.
Great breakfast

49,"Gorgeous, huge, luxurious room in perfect location","We stayed three nights in this AMAZING hotel!  From the lobby to our room - it was just beautiful!  Our room was so large and luxurious with lots of added amenities.  The staff were all very nice and helpful as well.  The location was perfect to stroll through the Eixample and Gracia neighborhoods and down Las Ramblas.  It was also a short walk to a Metro station which we used to get to other areas of the city.  There are tons of restaurants and tapas bars nearby.  We never had time to explore the rest of the hotel which was a shame, as there was a rooftop pool and outdoor restaurant which I'm sure were beautiful.  We highly recommend the Seventy Barcelona!",5,2023,05,17
49,Fantastic Hotel,"This hotel is located in a lovely, safe part of Barcelona. It is very close to the posh shopping district in Barcelona.

Check in to the hotel was at 3pm but they did upgrade one of the rooms booked as a goodwill gesture as I had my elderly mum with me. This resulted in her staying in a penthouse suite. Truly breathtaking experience. My own ‚Äúnormal‚Äù room was lovely, clean with good air conditioning. Each room was left a little gift of cleaning materials (hand cream, toothpaste etc) as a sign of goodwill. The hotel also gave my mum free use of the mini bar and snacks in her luxurious room which was another lovely gesture. We  ate at the hotel bar each evening, out of convenience. The food was lovely and there was an equally lovely breakfast.

I highly recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to stay in Barcelona.

49,Amazing and wonderful,"This hotel is amazing, room was spacious clean with a huge bed sofa and tv.
All the staff are so friendly and polite and can‚Äôt do enough for you. The bar was
Stocked well with any drink you preferred, restaurant was excellent with a choice of eating indoors or 
Outdoors. Was raining one night and as we walked through reception got asked by a wonderful lady that checked us
In  ( Valeria ) asked if we were going outside and offered umbrellas . Not had that experience at a hotel before ! 
We stayed in room 628 and Valeria truly  made our stay special.",5,2023,05,16
49,"Though a year ago, positive memories remain strong!","Though my visit was a year ago, I always regretted not writing a review for such a positive experience. The room, lobbies, and staff were outstanding. I was made to feel welcome right from the start, despite jet lag and a travel worn brain fog. Though out my 5 day day I was regularly greeted warmly, and I appreciate the attention to details provided. I would strongly recommend this hotel for others.",5,2023,05,15
49,Best Hotel Ever!,"We have just completed a four night stay at the Seventy and I must say it is the best hotel we‚Äôve ever stayed in whether in the US or Europe.  The staff at the reception, breakfast, bar, restaurant, housekeeping and valet ate simply outstanding, friendly and professional and always ready to assist you.  Really the best we‚Äôve ever had.  They all speak perfect English.  Alessandra at the reception is amazing, super sweet and efficient! The hotel itself is beautiful like something out of Architectural Digest.  The room had a super comfortable king size bed with elegant sheets and pillows. The bathroom is spotless with a great shower and plenty of plush bath sheets.  They even provide toothpaste/toothbrushes, shaving kits and hairdryer.  Make sure you book the room with breakfast which offers homemade omelettes, bacon, flaky croissants and an assortment of Spanish breads, freshly squeezed juices, fruits and made to order lattes and cappuccinos.  Don‚Äôt bother looking for another hotel in Barcelona.  This centrally located gem is all you need to make you stay unforgettable.  
",5,2023,05,14
49,Perfect!,"A fantastic hotel. Set back a street from Diagonal in Eixample and easy to reach. Very modern and well presented. Our room (a Seventy room) was very nice and comfortable. Personally we didn‚Äôt feel a need to upgrade our room based on reviews and we weren‚Äôt disappointed. A very cosy bed with a very modern feel to the facilities, all well presented.  The roof top bar and pool adds to a very European city feel. Far enough away from the tourists, yet close enough to walk to the sites (easy access to the Metro). The staff are very friendly and really show an interest in ensuring your stay is perfect. I‚Äôd certainly recommend and use this hotel in the future.",5,2023,05,13
49,Fabulous Stay at Seventy!,From the minute we walked in the door nothing was too much trouble.  The staff were all super friendly and attentive and a special shout out to Val at Reception who went above and beyond to make us feel at home.  We had a wonderful stay and will definitely be back!,5,2023,05,12
49,Cool hotel with fun vibe,"I booked this hotel based on reviews from Cond√© Nast traveler as well as reviews on this site.   It did not disappoint!   It is modern, classy and has a cool vibe.   We loved all the books on the walls!   The rooms were nice, the bed was comfy, and the downstairs bar was fun.   We never made it to the one upstairs!  The people at the front desk made us feel welcome and were helpful with securing a taxi and recommendations for dining.   Special shout out to Alberto and Carlos, bartenders, who chatted with us every night!",5,2023,05,12
49,Fabulous stay with the staff making everything possible !,"Fantastic hotel in a great location.
I loved my stay here so much that after a few days I was convinced I actually  lived  there! Fabulous busy hotel but the quietest  rooms at night I have ever stayed in- I didn‚Äôt ever hear a door bang or anyone in the corridor. The housekeeping is also brilliant with copious free quality mineral water. I loved the spa and had the best facial I have had for ages and they also they sell  ‚Äòcarry on ‚Äò friendly facial products. The service from the front desk and all the staff was also brilliant -they were always happy to help as well as cheery ! The rooftop and patio were also great together  the food  and drink with the free drink vouchers And   especially the passion fruit martinis -amazing! Thanks again seventy!",5,2023,05,12

49,Albertos sangria class was amazing!,Fabulous sangria class with Alberto. We learned all about the history of the drink and more importantly how to make it ourselves. I can't wait to re-create it at home! Top class service in a stunning hotel. Cannot recommend enough!,5,2023,05,10
49,Seventy Barcelona is a wonderful hotel!,"Had a great time at Seventy Barcelona.  I was made to feel at home by the friendly and outgoing staff as soon as I arrived.  The staff were helpful and tried to meet all of the needs of the guests.  The rooms were spacious and comfortable with lots of nice touches. We had the delicious breakfast every day.  There was a great variety of very fresh food ranging from fresh fruits to cheeses and meats to freshly baked bread and cakes, and eggs to order along with cereal, yogurt and excellent coffee .  The hotel was walking distance from everything and a welcoming place to return to each night.  Special shout out to Valeria, who called the restaurants on a list I had made until she got us a reservation! The reservation was for a wonderful restaurant where we had the best meal of our visit.  I appreciate the Seventy Barcelona and would gladly stay there anytime.",5,2023,05,07
49,Big thumbs up for SEVENTY," Location is probably one of the most important things I look for before booking . 
Is it close to a metro , restaurants , points of interests ? 
Yes on all counts ! 
The perks of the hotel include two bars one of which is on the roof next to a pool . 
Greeted everyday with complimentary cava ( champagne ) in lobby , staff at door to point out directions if need be . 
A fantastic little corner store that we would stop almost daily for a coffee con leche and a delicious little sandwich . Ugh I already miss those !!! 
Best peel for me though was all guests had access to their spa  which had a steam room , sauna exercise equipment and a beautiful indoor pool . 
All guests are allowed 30 min everyday and only allow 6 people in at a time so it‚Äôs never crowded. 
Lastly , the staff was wonderful . I really mean it . Very helpful , they all spoke English . ",5,2023,05,06
49,Wonderful hotel,The hotel is beautiful and classy. Staff are excellent. The room is very comfortable and clean. Restaurant is good. Lovely patio area to enjoy the perfect Barcelona weather and great food. Would definitely stay again. ,5,2023,05,06
49,Wonderful hotel,"This hotel was even better than I expected.  It was in walking distance from so many things,  The staff was pleasant and so helpful.  The hotel itself was wonderful from the large entry to the eating and dining areas to our very spacious room.  The room had a king bed with wonderfully soft sheets and large screen TV (unfortunately it was in Spanish and we were not able to use it).  They had a lovely area on the roof that was spotless and a pool.  Everything was first rate and we would certainly book this hotel again.",5,2023,05,05
49,Fantastic ,"What can I say, probably the most luxe hotel I‚Äôve stayed at since the Grand Hyatt in Mumbai. Those bed sheets, that huge tv, the breakfast, the beautiful courtyard and the friendliest staff. We had a super 2 days and because everything was faultless I have to say the ‚Äúconditioner‚Äù in the shower was terrible, but I forgive you Seventy and for anyone considering this hotel book today!! I had the best nights sleep in years!!",5,2023,05,05
49,"Excellent hotel, highly recommended.","We loved everything about this hotel.  Very clean, new looking, modern, beautifully decorated, well appointed throughout.  Impeccable service starting with the security guy rushing out to the taxi to greet us with a big smile and bring in our luggage to the friendly and helpful people at the reception desk and the breakfast area.  The hotel had a nice bar but we didn't use it.  

We arrived at 9 am and was allowed to leave our luggage in a locked room since our room wasn't ready.  We were also offered to use the facilities at the spa to freshen up; we didn't use it but it looked very nice and well equipped with the shower, toiletries, nice fluffy towels.  

Our room was of decent size and beautifully decorated.  The bathroom had a flat iron in addition to the hairdryer.  Breakfast was good although they served the same things everyday.  We had omelette cooked to order every day by the nice gentleman in the kitchen.

The upstairs had a couple of big conference tables, desks with computers and printers.  It's a nice, quiet area to work in although I never saw anyone using it.",5,2023,05,04
49,My new Barcelona home,"This hotel was such a nice surprise.  It‚Äôs not often that the property lives up to the reviews and photos but this one not only did that, it surpassed them in my opinion.  I stayed at Seventy for five nights and must say that I was sad to leave.  The reception of the hotel is stylish and beautiful and it didn‚Äôt stop there.  The rooms were well appointed and tastefully decorated.  Most importantly, the hotel was very clean which is a make or break for me.  While the physical hotel was a wonderful surprise, the staff is what made it feel like my new home away from home.  They were professional yet very relaxed making me feel as if I was at home as soon as I walked through the doors.  I just can‚Äôt say enough great stuff about this hotel.  Needless to say, I‚Äôll always stay here whenever I visit Barcelona.",5,2023,05,03
49,A 4 star hotel that deserves a 5 star rating!,"Everything I can say about this hotel is positive.

- New, clean, modern and well sized rooms, that offer excellent sleep quality and bedding (probably better than many 5 star hotels I have stayed in.) new and perfect AC system, this is a major plus in any European hotel in summer.

- Friendly and helpful staff.

- Excellent restaurant with a fresh breakfast served in a very beautiful inner garden setting. 

- Location is only a couple of blocks away from Paseo De Gracia which for us was very comfortable. I do realize there are more centrally located hotels, but all in all, the location was good and easily walkable.

- Rooftop is a great place to be and have a drink.

This hotel is deserving of a 5 Star rating, and a loud recommendation for others to come and experience it.",5,2023,05,03
49,Very good service and location!,"Very good service and standards! We used the rooftop poolarea a couple of days and it is worth a visit. Spaceous rooms, with comfortalble temperatur. We highly recomend a stay at Seventy Barcelona! We‚Äôll book again.",5,2023,05,01
49,Best Hotel in Barcelona,"Friendliest and most helpful staff, excellent accommodations, so luxurious and classy. The breakfast bar was exceptional and always fully dressed. The staff even packed us a breakfast picnic to take as we had to check out at 4:00am to catch an early flight. Perfection!",5,2023,04,29
49,Treat yourself to the Seventy Barcelona experience!,"Beautiful hotel!  Every aspect was well-thought out and designed for the ultimate guest experience.  Friendly staff, check-in and check-out was smooth, and room was available slightly ahead of the 1500 check-in time.  
Rooms are well-appointed: generously-sized bath towels, extremely comfortable bedding, modern design, and LOVED the automatic black-out and noise-dampening blinds!!  
Great meeting facilities, with morning and afternoon break set-up just outisde the meeting room on the terrace.  Breakfasts and lunches were excellent.  Really loved the detox juices in the morning, very nice touch :)
Highly recommend to any traveler.",5,2023,04,27
49,A great experience in a wonderful hotel,"This hotel is wonderful. It feels like you're the first person to stay in the room, it's so well maintained, well equipped and stylish. The hotel is well situated, the staff were all friendly, facilities were great, rooftop terrace is lovely.

We stayed in a Seventy Room which was lovely. We didn't try the breakfast as there are so many other high quality breakfast to explore.

The hotel is a short walk to La Familia, Diagonal and metro stations. 

Really hard to fault anything here. I would 100% recommended.",5,2023,04,26
49,This should be a 5-Star Hotel.,"This hotel is amazing. Not only are the rooms spacious and comfortable, with a firm bed and nice linens and pillows, the rest of the facilities are very nice as well. I have not yet tried the spa (maybe tomorrow), but the lobby is beautiful, with bookshelves floor to ceiling, and the patio is full of olive and palm trees and the pleasant sound of flowing water. It's a bit chilly yet to swim, but the rooftop pool and sitting area are also very nice. What is especially appreciated, though, is the staff! Everyone who works for this hotel -- the front reception people, the servers, the custodial staff -- are consistently friendly and eager to help. In addition to all of that, the location of Seventy Barcelona is perfect. If you want to shop for luxury goods, the Passeig de Gracia is a few blocks away, but there are also great little shops and a variety of restaurants in the alleys and side streets of this area. There are several Gaudi buildings within walking distance and la Sagrada Familia isn't too far away. I feel totally safe walking along the streets in this neighborhood alone. We are so happy we found this hotel.",5,2023,04,26
49,Seventy Barcelona,Amazing stay! Was there on Business/Leisure and everything experienced was high quality. Meeting facilities are very well equipped and the best we have found. The staff was super friendly and helpful of any and all requests. Would definitely recommend. I only wish we could find one of these in every city.,5,2023,04,24
49,"Quiet, central hotel.","Lovely stay in the heart of Barcelona.  Central location allows for visiting the nearby Case Mila, the Block of Discord, La Sagrada Famila, or wandering the shops along the Passeig de Gracia.

The first impression is of a hotel on a busy street.  However, the roof-top patio was a peaceful oasis to lounge in the sun.  Behind the hotel, the courtyard with olive trees was a quiet escape from the hustle and bustle of Carrer de Corsega.

My room was very well appointed and very quiet despite being in the city.

Stayed for three days to attend a business conference.  Regretted leaving.  Would have like to stay a few more days to ",5,2023,04,23
49,Great stay!,"Staff was very friendly and helpful, very reasonably priced for the vibe of the stay, hotel design is fun and artsy, nice hotel bar and lounge area, right across the street from a great restaurant- La Pepita(make a res!) and also a churro spot. 
Sidebar- i had prepaid my parking in the garage but couldn‚Äôt find my ticket upon pickup. I feel like in the US I would have been made to waste time searching or been told tough luck, so I was pleasantly surprised when the hotel clerk just said ‚Äúno problem, I‚Äôll just call down to the garage.‚Äù Then at the garage I was told ‚Äúyou‚Äôre all set!‚Äù This saved me so much time and hassle and I was like ‚Äúwhat world am I in?!‚ÄùüòÄ so this was much appreciated.
Would stay here again for sure!",5,2023,04,21
49,You must stay here!,"This was a lovely hotel. I went for business but stayed some extra days with my family to tour. The location was excellent. The room was beautiful, the service impeccable and we were very comfortable and sad to leave. You get the impression they care very much about the guests and the experience which was flawless. Every staff we met was so kind and courteous. Thank you! ",5,2023,04,21
49,Highly recommend!!!!!,"The experience of living here is great! First of all, the room is very tidy and clean. Secondly, the service staff is very enthusiastic! During my birthday, Mr. Param also gave me and my friends two drinks and a cheesecake (by the way, the cheesecake at the hotel Bar is really delicious!!), and many staff told me happy birthday. Everyone is very friendly! I highly recommend this hotel!!",5,2023,04,20
49,Gorgeous stay,"Great hotel with brilliant service, rooms are clean and a good size. The rooftop and terrace are gorgeous. Aurelian and Carlos at the bar were fantastic and gave us brilliant recommendations and even better cocktails, sangria masterclass was a great touch. 10/10",5,2023,04,16
49,Perfect spot for your Barcelona trip,"Had a great week in Barcelona, using Seventy as our base camp.  Rooms and amenities are clean and were fantastic- staff was super friendly and helpful (and bilingual).  The location is in a great part of town and everything is within walking distance.  Great tapas and food all around.  Highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay there again. ",5,2023,04,15
49,BARCELONA - THE BEST WAY!,"Where do I even start? I understand now why this hotel is so highly rated. From the moment we checked in we felt welcomed and taken care of. The staff are very warm and friendly, often going above and beyond to make sure we were okay. The location of this hotel is perfect and is walkable to mostly all the main tourist attractions. We walked to and from different neighborhoods both at day and night with no issues! If you need a taxi they often stop in front of the hotel and the awesome doormen will help you flag one down. As for the room - it was spacious and completely soundproof! The pillow menu and cloud-like bed allowed us to get the best sleep. After a long day of walking, Sergio and the rest of the spa team were fantastic and made sure we made the most of the pool circuit. The massages at the spa were perfect to unwind after a long flight and a tough hike up Montserrat. The breakfast is a MUST-HAVE at this hotel! Heraclesüí™üèæ, Paola, and the kitchen staff were AMAZING!! Another special shout-out to Param for going above and beyond to meet our concerns and ensuring our stay was as special as it could be.

Laia was the event coordinator and was truly exceptional, easy to work with and she and her team made sure we felt at home.  Borja was great, friendly, professional and willing to go above and beyond.  Idracracris was also great and very friendly.  Great Team and Great stay at SeventyBarcelona Hotel!  ",5,2023,04,14
49,Definitely worth a trip,Stunning stay at Seventy Barcelona. Stayed for two nights and was very impressed with the standard of the rooms - all the mod cons and more!

49,Amazing place to stay. Highly recommendüëçüèΩ,"I would highly recommend Seventy. We went as a couple for my boyfriends 30th. This hotel is a 4 star but deserves to be 5 star. Our room was so lovely and clean. The bed was super comfortable. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The hotel itself is beautiful and in a good location. 
We felt safe and well taken care of in our hotel. The weather was too cold for the outdoor pool but the indoor pool is lovely and warm and you are given 30 minutes slot for the pool which was nice for me and my partner to enjoy together. I also recommend the food from Seventy they have a bar also with live music. Overall very happy I chose Seventy and I will definitely book them again.",5,2023,03,30
49,We loved our stay at Seventy Barcelona!,"This is a lovely hotel near the metro (subway) so getting around is very easy. Our room is spacious and the bed is so comfortable!!

The staff is very friendly and helpful. 

Tonight we were treated to a free lesson by Carlos and the bar team about making sangria. There were 8 of us and we all had a great time. The team left us with two pitchers of sangria. So much fun! My husband and I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2023,03,29
49,The Best In Barcelona!!! ,"If could describe my stay at Seventy Barcelona in one word, it would be FLAWLESS!! From check in to check out, everything was simply amazing.  Alessandra greeted me so warmly and genuinely friendly during my check in, and that just set the tone for my entire stay. She is the epitome of what anyone in a customer service position would describe as STAR employee. My room was absolutely gorgeous. It's a true retreat from the hustle and bustle of a busy metropolitan city. The bed is just pure heavenly. It's the kind of bed that you lay down in and don't want to get out of.  The hotel is a a little bit removed from the chaos and crowds that is Plaza Catalunya, but close enough if you want to walk there. I had one of the most amazing meals at the hotel restaurant as well. The atmosphere was so inviting and the staff even more attentive than most other places in the city. They make a proper cocktail, and they pay extra attention to every detail. As much as I didn't want to leave, I had to head back home, I was lucky enough to catch Alessandra again upon my check out. It was quick and seamless. She even made sure that I had a taxi waiting to take me to the airport. I so look forward to my next stay at The Seventy Barcelona the next time I am visiting that wonderful city.",5,2023,03,29
49,"Brilliant hotel within walking distance of some attractions in Barcelona. Very friendly, helpful staff. Exceptional!!!!","Excellent Hotel. Will highly recommend this hotel. Rooms are spacious, Clean and very well equipped, Friendly and very helpful staff. Very good spa and breakfast! 
Centrally allocated and easy to get to all major attractions. Most of the attractions are within walking distance.",5,2023,03,28
49,Stunning hotel in the heart of Barcelona,"My husband and I had the pleasure of staying here for a city break in January.

From check-in to check-out, there was a warm friendly smile around every corner.

The hotel itself, is stunning. The decor, furnishings and ambience was exactly what we were looking for. The room was comfortable, clean and well equipped - even had a hair straightener!

We had breakfast included in our rate and it was always a great start to our day. The selection was good for a boutique hotel and had all that you would need. 

As it was our first visit to Barcelona, we weren‚Äôt too sure if the location would be ideal, but to our relief, the location was spot on! It is walking distance to all the major points of interest and there wasn‚Äôt a shortage of restaurants in the immediate area. Pg. de Gracia was a 2 minute walk, which has all the luxury stores, as well as high street brands. 

We would love to return to Barcelona in the near future, and we wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to stay in Seventy when we do!",5,2023,03,27
49,"Lovely, modern, stylish and chilled hotel","Lovely hotel with a great bar area, rooftop pool and decent gym (two treadmills, bike and a selection of dumbbells up to 14kg, soft weighted balls, mats etc.). 

Room was delightful, felt very spacious with a comfy bed. Would recommend to anyone staying in Barcelona!",5,2023,03,23
49,Perfectly Located Hotel with the Best Staff Ever,"Hotel 70 is the perfect choice in Barcelona. Located near Diagonal metro station gives you access to 3 different lines, but you can also walk many places including the Sagrada Familia.

It‚Äôs in the district of Eixample, with Gaudi architecture, shopping, and excellent dining literally all around the hotel. The staff are incredibly helpful and friendly - they can even helped us secure tickets to El Cl√°sico.

Rooms are comfortable, clean, trendy, and somehow feel upscale yet relaxed at the same time. This place is perfect in every way and even has a beautiful lobby bar and spa.",5,2023,03,22
49,We loved it!,"I love this hotel! I recommend it to anyone. It was hard staying here first because our next hotel could not beat it. The lobby is gorgeous. The rooms are so comfortable and nicely appointed. The breakfast was phenomenal and the terrace outside of the restaurant was beautiful. The last afternoon I got a massage and it was phenomenal. I would 100% book here again. One helpful comment - my husband was sick and the hotel did not have a doctor they could recommend. They suggested the ER since it was night time. Don't do it. We googled 24 hour doctor, english speaking and were able to get someone to the hotel. It was half the price of the ER (we waited two hours there and bailed). Hopefully you won't need it. I wish the hotel would have known about this service - hoping they can recommend in the future. Do not hesitate to book here. And La Pepita is across the street and is delicious.  ",5,2023,03,21
49,"Wonderful hotel, great location, amazing staff (mostly) and one warning.","Pros
Excellent hotel, in the perfect location.  Central to everything and easy to get around the city from this base.
In the most part, staff are so friendly, welcoming and fun.  Big call out to Roselyn and Aurelian at the Cors bar for the amazing cocktails and making my Birthday feel special.
Rooftop beach club looks great, although no swimming in the rooftop pool this time as not quite warm enough yet.
Breakfasts were so good, with fresh egg and omelette bar.  So much choice from really healthy to fry-up.
Spa and massage was divine.  Recommend Rodrigo (masseur) for a deep tissue massage - the ultimate relaxation and readies the muscles for all the city walking.
Hotel interiors visually appealing and everything kept so clean and tidy.
Our second room was perfect, comfortable beds and all the amenities required.

Cons
Here's the warning.  We booked a room with ""views overlooking Calle C√≥rcega, boasting natural light"".   When booking, the website made a big deal of this being only one of two rooms left with such a view.
We checked in quite late (around 8pm) and were given an internal accessible room.  There was little natural light (it comes down from a tall atrium), and the view was of an internal wall within the hotel.  Worst of all the air con didn't work.  The temperature was so hot in the room (room 529 btw).  There was also an old, used toothbrush sitting on top of the shampoo dispenser in the shower.
When I raised the room issue at reception, I was informed there were no suitable rooms left and it would need to wait until the next day.
The next morning the receptionist called and asked if I was the man who wanted to change rooms.  I explained I wanted the room type we had booked.  We found this individual to be pretty rude and he seemed to try to make a big deal of us 'wanting' to change rooms (this was embarrassing when later standing in reception in front of other guests).  We had to effectively check-out and leave our belongings in left luggage and check back in to the second room later in the day.
The second room was perfect and so much nicer (even if a little smaller), with the view and natural light.  

Almost the perfect stay apart from the room situation and awful response from male receptionist. ",5,2023,03,18
49,Wonderful.. but no vegetarian dining options,"We had a wonderful stay at this hotel for our honeymoon in February. The staff were lovely and the facilities were great. We booked with TUI and were really pleased when we arrived, it's one of the best hotels we've stayed at. We paid for half board, and as such had our breakfast and evening meal there. The breakfast was fantastic with a good buffet selection. The evening meal was good.... for meat eaters. As a half board customer, you were able to pick from one starter, one main, and one desert from their selection. A selection that did not include any vegetarian main meals, not one. My husband is vegetarian, and when we asked the staff, they showed us all the vegetarian starters that he could have... but no mains. Each day he was told to pick a starter for a main, which they did not make into the size of a main - it was only ever starter size. When we asked about this at reception they responded that they were vegetarian friendly.... with their starters, so that was unhelpful. If you're vegetarian.. be prepared to compromise, if you're vegan you might find dining very difficult. There are heaps of restaurants near the hotel though. 

The live entertainment on the weekend evenings was fantastic and the pool facilities were excellent. Being limited to 30 minutes a day was a little disappointing, but it was lovely nevertheless. 

All in all a great stay... with a hungry husband! ",4,2023,03,16
49,Fantastic hotel,"A fantastic hotel that  I would give 6 stars to if possible. From the welcoming staff ( Rebbeca and Alessandra) with accompanying complimentary cava to the stylish surroundings and great bar vibe and food. Live music ( major kudos to the blues duo on Thursday), nothing too much trouble in terms of friendliness and customer awareness.

A very comfortable bed, a quiet room, despite looking over the road, the sound proofing evidently very effective. Only very minor criticism would be a difficulty finding the shower sweet spot as the temperature veered alarmingly from hot to cold. However that is a very minor point compared to the overall experience which we could not fault. Lovely spa, very nice and tranquil outdoors adjunct to the main restaurant and did I mention the staff‚Ä¶? We will be back, great stay @ hotel 70.",5,2023,03,14
49,Romantic dream trip,"I have been in Barcelona several times but always stayed with family. At this time I decided to have a romantic trip and this place was perfect! Great location and beautiful interior nicely decorated. The breakfast had a lot to choose from, excellent quality. The room was spacious and very clean. The staff was very friendly and good to talk with. I had a wonderful time and I am looking forward to return. I strongly recommend Seventy Barcelona! 
Special thanks to my new friends Ben and Oscar.

49,Weekend Trip to Barcelona and Stayed in Seventy ,"Excellent Stay . Benjamin and his team were fantastic. Weekend trip in Jan 2023 and the level of service, staff attention, bar and food quality was amazing. We managed to get a lunch before we were leaving and the restaurant was busy for the time of year which is good and food quality was exceptional. Location is great. very close to all the designer shops and approx 20 mins walk to Place de Catalunya. Also some great spots for food and drinks local not to mention their own bar which had live music and band playing . Great stay and would go back for sure. Raj ",5,2023,03,13
49,Best hotel in Barcelona !,"Travelling to Barcelona for almost 20 years and tried this hotel for first time end of last year. Staff quite exceptional - could not possibly be more helpful. New hotel so everything very fresh. Amazing terrace restaurant at rear of hotel - a complete oasis. Location best of all words. Bottom of Gracia district so not in middle of tourist traps but still very central. Only negative was that loud music is constantly played in every public part of hotel so difficult if you are looking for a quiet area to read or work. However, I mentioned this to a member of staff and they immediately directed me to the TV lounge and arranged for the music to be stopped in this area for me. Absolutely amazing guest care! Back in BCN in May - no question - this is definitely where I will be staying. 10/10.",5,2023,03,13
49,Amazing!,This was honestly the best hotel experience I‚Äôve had. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful. The room was immaculate!  Everything is well thought out and purposeful. The bed was very comfortable. Love the Bluetooth ceiling speakers and heated towel rack is a nice touch. Could not recommend this hotel more. Wish we were staying longer!,5,2023,03,12
49,Highly recommend for a weekend in Barcelona,"One of my favorite places I‚Äôve had the opportunity to stay. The staff was really wonderful, the design was impeccable and our room met our needs perfectly. The location was great - loved this neighborhood. Walkable to so many places and cool bars and restaurants nearby. Would definitely stay here again.",5,2023,03,12
49,Great experience!,"Great experience! Very nice place, nice atmosphere with great live music, recommended for an awesome night with friends or couple. Excellent food and affordable prices. Lorena was super nice and attentive. Highly recommended, we‚Äôll repeat!!",5,2023,03,11
49,"First Class Hotel, 5 Star rating","My second stay at Seventy Barcelona was just as amazing as my first.
As a frequent business traveler a good hotel can make or break your trip, nothing worse than finding the hotel you booked was nothing like it was advertised, and after a grueling day traveling in a busy city there's nothing worse than dreading going to a poor hotel.
Taxi from Barcelona airport is approx $30-40 (traffic depending) and takes around 20-30 mins.
Staying at Seventy Barcelona, after a busy day i can't wait to get back to my sanctuary!
The Hotel and staff are first class, very accommodating (although i couldn't get a late checkout this time so i'm stuck in the lobby for a few hours before my flight home, but i'd rather be here than the airport lounge!!) 
Check in is always smooth and the lobby and check in area are always spotlessly clean, well lit and inviting.
Of the two rooms i've had both have been outstanding, spotlessly clean again with incredibly comfortable beds, crisp linens and tasteful decor.
Large shower with great water pressure, shower gel, shampoo and conditioner that smell great and super soft oversized bath towels and robes.
Plenty of storage in the closets along with mini fridge and safe if you need it, however i've never had a problem here, again, the staff is first class.
A big plus for me is the fact the rooms are very, very quiet, not sure if they use some kind of white noise to reduce sound in the rooms but both rooms i have had were silent, great for sleeping!
The bar area is modern and welcoming with plenty of seats at the bar, a nice fireplace and comfortable seating throughout the bar area, background music is smooth and has a cool vibe, a very pleasant place to unwind.
Breakfast should not be missed, incredible fresh baked pastries, breads, cakes, fruit, omelettes made to order and plenty of sides to add like bacon, sausage etc.

Overall i love this place, i'll always try get in here when i travel to Barcelona, i highly recommend a stay at Seventy Barcelona.
",5,2023,03,11
49,Highly recommend,"Really enjoyed our stay at this hotel.  Excellent location and it is beautiful - from the lovely rooftop area with pool to the bar and restaurant with  patio and really nice bedrooms.

Breakfast wasn't included with our room but we decided to have breakfast there.  Forty euro for the two of us each morning. It was actually lovely to have it on the patio and there was a good choice of hot and cold options, great coffee and very helpful staff.  

We were allocated the wrong room on arrival - a double instead of a twin - and this was rectified.  My only negative is that the reception staff were all young and very cool, as if that was their job to look cool, and not actually do the whole customer service thing!  

Our room - a patio room -  had three floor to ceiling windows, which could be opened (windows in interior rooms cannot be opened), and we looked out on the restaurant patio and over to an apartment building.

I would really recommend this hotel and hope to return again soon.    

 ",5,2023,03,07
49,Really good hotel to recommend in Barcelona,"We stayed in seventy for 5 days and I have to say this hotel is  excellent! Will definitely come and visit again!!! The staff are all very friendly and passionate, they offered us welcome drinks while we are waiting for checking in, free drinks at bar, even when we checking out, they arranged taxi for us!
Speaking of the location, you can hardly find a better place than seventy, easy access to bus and tube, most of the tourists sites are within walking distances. And the community is safe and quiet.
All I all I really enjoy my staying here, appreciate the staff for the services provided. hope we see each other again!",5,2023,03,07
49,Truly exceptional place!,"Second time I stayed in Seventy and second time I was totally impressed. I don‚Äôt think one could ever get tired of this hotel! When on a business trip, I always try to avoid those standard business looking hotels and dull/impersonal rooms. 
In Seventy, you get the total opposite: beautifully decorated rooms with a great sense of style. Feels like home. Comfortable, clean, cosy, beautiful materials. Amazingly comfortable bed. 

The lobby still remains my favorite area. With spaces to work, read or just hang out or have a drink at the bar, there is ample space for everyone.

The food is incredible! High quality products. I had fish this time and was absolutely delicious.

I will be back and hope there will be availability, cause with so many great reviews this place must be fought for ;-) 

Thank you, staff!",5,2023,03,06
49,Elegant and Warm,"We don't normally post reviews but we've had such a great experience at this hotel that we felt we had to. From the moment we checked-in, the friendly staff have done everything to make our stay here relaxing, easy and enjoyable. It's quickly felt like a home away from home. We want to give special praise to the bar team, and especially to Aurelian and Roselyn, who were warm, friendly, attentive and generous with recommendations and advice when we asked.  This experience has given us the nurturing space we needed at this moment in time.",5,2023,03,06
49,Faultless,"We stayed at the Seventy Barcelona for 3 nights in February 2023. Everything about our stay was perfect. 

The staff, from the manager, to the hospitality team, to those on reception, did everything they could to be welcoming and improve our stay. All were friendly to us and the other guests, and despite a short stay, we felt a friendly relationship quickly develop. A special shout-out to Alberto for the sangria making lesson.

The hotel itself is striking, with a great design aesthetic. It was a pleasure to spend time there relaxing in between exploring the city. The use of the spa sauna, steam room and pool helped with that too. Our room was one of the internally facing ones, overlooking the courtyard area. We slept like logs in a giant comfy bed, with no noise from the city around you.

I would rarely return to the same hotel in a city, preferring to try somewhere new, but there‚Äôs no reason I wouldn‚Äôt return to Seventy.",5,2023,03,06

From the complementary champagne right as we walked to check-in, to the lovely live music downstairs, Seventy had it all! But on top of the stunning hotel, clean room,  access to sauna and warm pool,  we got to wake up to an AMAZING included breakfast every day. This hotel will definitely be memorable for us thanks to the PHENOMENAL staff. We were welcomed by Ruby who was so nice and gave us complementary champage for our room as we came for a celebration. Valeria made sure we felt comfortable and had great informative conversations with us and made us feel very welcome. 10/10 recommend and will definitely come back!!:) Thank you Seventy Barcelona!!",5,2023,03,01

49,Stellar  ...,"My stay at the Seventy exceeded all of my expectations. Location is prime, service is top notch and personable.

49,An amazing experience,"My stay at seventy Barcelona was nothing short of amazing. I‚Äôll start off by stating that prior to my arrival the receptionists were already so attentive and answered my emails in a timely manner answering all of my questions. They also assisted me with booking a car service that picked me up from the airport and dropped me off at the hotel. As soon as I arrived at the hotel I was welcomed by a very kind doorman and the receptionist at the check in counter was ready to check me in with a smile on her face. Check in was very fast and luckily my room was ready at 8 am which was a great relief as I was tired after traveling from the United States. As I entered into my room I had to stop and admire how huge, clean and beautiful the room was. I was so content and immediately knew that I made the right choice by staying at this hotel. Every single space in this hotel is absolutely beautiful. I don‚Äôt think that pictures do it enough justice. The entire staff at the reception area, restaurant, bar and spa were all so kind and comforting. Being that I was traveling solo I had moments of feeling nervous but as soon as I encountered someone on the seventy team those feelings went away because they all were so kind and warm with me. I spent my birthday there and they had a complimentary glass of champagne and dessert sent up to my room which was so sweet then later on in the day I received a bottle of champagne that my friend back at home sent to me along with a note that the receptionists printed out on her behalf. This moved me to tears because the surprise was so well executed and the timing of the delivery was perfect as it was delivered right after i got back in from a day out exploring the city. The staff paid close attention so that my friends surprise could be successful and It meant so much to both her and I. I‚Äôd also like to give a very special shoutout to Valeria for recommending restaurants, helping me book reservations and always checking in on me to make sure that I was safe and doing okay. I also felt very safe due to the hotel being located in a very nice area that is walking distance from beautiful cafes, restaurants and high end designer shops. I was able to walk almost everywhere without feeling unsafe. I also would like to mention that the spa was absolutely amazing. It was so beautiful and relaxing and I received one of the best massages ever. My body felt so relaxed and i slept so well after being serviced. I am so happy that I chose to stay at this hotel. Every single moment was enjoyed and I look forward to visiting again. Thank you so much team Seventy for making my very first trip to Barcelona one that I will never forget and for making my birthday so special. See you all again soon.",5,2023,02,19
49,Perfect place to stay - Highly recommend,"Cleanliness 5/5
Location 4/5
Service 5/5
Facilities 4/5

Excellent service and couldn‚Äôt ask for more. Reception and wait staff were friendly and courteous. We were extremely grateful that the staff went out of their way to fix a booking error we made with Agoda. 
The rooms were modern and clean. Breakfast was excellent with a diverse selection of quality ingredients. The bread was better than that we had at Michelin restaurants. 
The location was a bit further out from the main city but it wasn‚Äôt inconvenient. Recommend getting a transport pass (hola card) to get around. The gym/spa was aesthetic and comfortable but you have to make reservations as it is a bit small - you could probably skip this. Overall a wonderful stay and would highly recommend.",5,2023,02,18

49,Seventy Hotel Barcelona is the best!,"We stayed at Seventy Barcelona 2/13-2/17. What a beautiful Hotel!! We had a patio room and loved it. 
Great place for morning coffee!!  Immaculately clean and lovely room. Every detail in this room was thoughtfully included. Big fluffy towels and bathrobes to lounge in. Bed was super comfortable and the electronic black out shades helped us catch up on well needed sleep!
Staff was friendly and helpful and the spa was so relaxing. 
Love this place!!",5,2023,02,17
49,Very well recommended!,"Very good experience, it is the third time that I go. The facilities are beautiful, I felt like I don't need to leave the hotel. It is very well located, close to very famous restaurants and nightlife. The restaurant offers a very complete and delicious buffet breakfast. The attention at the reception was very good this last time, especially Delia, a very kind girl. We really enjoyed the spa as well as the gym. The room is beautiful and the pillows very comfortable! We will be back.",5,2023,02,16

49,Recommend,"Lives up to its ratings and reviews. Beautiful, well maintained, and clean. Great location. Wasn‚Äôt disappointed. The only mishap we had was that the safe was malfunctioning and we were locked out of it due to it needing new batteries. We went to the 24-7 front desk right away (before 10pm)  hoping to get someone to help open the safe, but they informed us that no one on staff could help us that night, that we had to wait until the next morning.  We were told we had to wait until 9am the next day for help and that we needed to be there, so we weren‚Äôt able to get our stuff due to an early tour. Honestly, they should always have someone on staff and oncall to open up the safe 24-7; imagine if you have an emergency or have an early flight or train to catch and you can‚Äôt open the safe. Luckily, we weren‚Äôt in a rush and could wait, but it was a bit of an inconvenience. Still, despite this service issue, I recommend. Beautiful and spotless.",5,2023,02,15
49,Best hotel in Barcelona,"Very nice and clean hotel. Beautiful lobby. Very friendly staff. Especially Lorena. She makes the best free style cocktails! Good breakfast and diner, nice Spa and swimmingpool. I come back very soon!",5,2023,02,15

49,FAB Hotel.  Great value for money,"We stayed at the hotel for 4 days. It was a perfect stay. Modern and stylist hotel worthy of 5 stars with a 4 star star official rating. All the staff were friendly and helpful. We took a taxi from the airport to the hotel costing 32 euros. The restaurant served lovely food followed by few cocktails üç∏.  We stayed in the Seventy Room on floor 4, Immaculate, great size room with sofa at the end of the bed. Massive tv and double size shower.  Breakfast was buffet style with plenty on offer.

The hotel is 5 minutes walk to Diagional metro, bus and tourist bus stop. There are plenty of taxis at reasonable prices.  

If this hotel is within your price range. Don't bother looking any where else.  You won't be disappointed.

Thank you Valeria, Alberto, Fernando and all the staff who make this hotel a success. ",5,2023,02,12
49,Wonderful!!!!,"The hotel was amazing, so beautifully designed and spotless. The location was excellent, in a great neighbourhood and close to the metro station and many sights.

We will definitely reccomend  to everyone and will stay here again!",5,2023,02,12
49,The Best hotel find of our trip,"While looking for a hotel in Barca for our honey moon I came across this hotel. The photos showed this beautifully classy hotel, with large rooms and an Amazing lobby area close to a lot of many great tapas areas. And let me say this hotel was all that and more.

From the first walk into the hotel, it was such a beautiful venue with some of the most warm and Inviting people. The lovely lady that checked us in, immediately offered us the chance to go on a tapas tour with some cultural learning and while we could not go it was just such a nice offer that both my wife and myself felt so welcomed.

The rooms are very large, we took a superior room which is one up from the base but this is the first European hotel room I‚Äôve hard with so much space.

Location wise it is a 30min walk to both of the major attractions in Barca which is lovely cause both my wife and myself do love to walk when we can and see the city by foot.

Overall, I cannot recommend this more to people. I absolutely loved this hotel and would stay again when I come back to Barcalona",5,2023,02,12
49,Great experience!,"This place had clean, beautiful rooms, a gorgeous reception and lobby, and friendly staff! During check-in our receptionist gave us a little tour on a map about the area we were in (good places to eat, shop, and tour around) which was very helpful. Each day we were greeted with friendly smiles. The hotel was centrally located so we walked pretty much everywhere. The cherry on top of our stay was an unexpected little tour from the hotel with Valeria (one of the receptionist). It was a 2 hour stroll through Gr√†cia where we learned a little history about the area, stoped at 2 squares, then went to 2 bars for drinks and tapas. It felt like a truly nice local experience. It was ‚Ç¨20 each for my husband and I and it was definitely worth it. We had fun! Thank you!

",5,2023,02,10
49,My favorite hotel,"It is not possible I recommend this hotel highly enough.

My wife and I stayed here for our honeymoon in Barcelona. We did some research prior to coming and decided this hotel was in a nice and safe area. Arriving in Barcelona confirmed this as we made our way through the city to the hotel. It is located surrounded by Guadi architecture, nice shopping, fantastic bars and restaurants, and it was within walking distance of many major attractions.

The staff treated us like royalty.  Param greeted us and explained the spa, breakfast etc.  They arranged a taxi for us, they held our bags for us after checkout so we could go rent a car, they recommended tapas locations etc.

The breakfast was out-of-this-world. It was a buffet that included literally the best scrambled eggs I've ever had in my life. I do not understand how they made them. They had croissants, pastries, Iberian ham, various cheeses and jams, cakes, a potato quiche, Spanish bacon, four different types of freshly squeezed juices, champagne, lattes, and an omelet bar that I didn't even need to use.  They also provided us with free champagne and chocolate dipped strawberries in our room to celebrate our honeymoon.

Our room had a terrace that you can see in the photos.  It was not high up, but it was peaceful and surrounded by nice Spanish architecture.  The bed was as comfy as ours at home and the pillows were better.  The bathrooms in the terraced rooms are higher quality and have a bidet and bathtub.

One of the greatest assets of the hotel was the spa. You are allowed to go to the spa for 30 minutes every day so that this way there are never more than a couple of people there.  They provide you with gowns and slippers and in the spa you have access to a dry sauna, wet sauna, beautiful swimming pool, showers, and an ice sink.  We made use of this every single day.  There is also a small gym here that also requires an appointment be made with the spa desk.   Usually we work out on vacations, but there was so much to do in the area that we didn't this time. 

We left the hotel after several days to travel around Spain, but our flight home was out of Barcelona. It was an absolute no-brainer to book the final night of our honeymoon at this hotel. They helped make the hectic morning of our flight home very smooth.

Brilliant hotel! Given all the amenities and the beautiful breakfast, I thought the price was very reasonable.

We loved Barcelona and I think we will come back here, when that happens this is the hotel we will stay at.

49,Amazing hotel,"If you re looking for a hotel that has it all,  then this is it. Amazing  staff and the roms were big and the bed so comfortable.

Thank you Valeria for helping us with my mothers‚Äô  birthday!",5,2023,02,05
49,A hotel nobody can forget ,"I had 3 weeks in Spain and stayed in Barcelona at the beginning and the end of the trip. I booked directly online with Seventy for the first stay as it offered me the rate better than other platforms. I told the hotel my arrival time would be early in the morning. When I checked in at 7am, I got help from Param at the front desk and was able to have my room at 1 pm, 2 hours earlier than the standard check in time 3 pm. That was helpful after a long haul flight of 18 hours. I stayed at Seventy House room, though the rate is a little higher, it definitely worths it. It is spacious, very bright, very clean and neat. The design is black and white which not many will dislike. Bed is firm and comfortable. The quilt is not thick, doesn't make you sweat at night. Room temp is adjustable. I like the hotel lobby design alot where I don't mind sitting there for long. After an enjoyable stay at the Seventy in the beginning of my trip, I decided to return and stay there again at the end of the trip before flying back home. Again I booked directly with them and got a room with better view than the first one. Next time when I return to Barcelona, will definitely stay at the Seventy Hotel again.",5,2023,01,31
49,Hip hotel in the happening part of town,"Seventy was right in the middle of the most happening part of Barcelona and walkable distance to most historical spots. The rooms were very comfortable and clean with lots of windows for natural light. The hotel is always buzzing with visitors to their bars and restaurants, overall very happening vibe. They have their own curated playlist which we enjoyed in the room, which had built in audio. Friendly staff and service, loved the stay at Seventy, would highly recommend it.",5,2023,01,29
49,Relaxed Hip Boutique Hotel with friendly service,"I stayed at Seventy for 6 nights so I got to know the hotel and team quite well. 
The rooms are spotless, and comfortable and a good size. 
I used the day spa which was excellent and the staff lovely. 
I ate in the restaurant a few times for breakfast and for a couple of other meals and snacks. Very happy with the food and service every time. 
I highly recommend the bar; the staff working there were super friendly and made excellent cocktails. Alberto & Fernando where so welcoming and great to chat with, and entirely appropriate with a woman travelling alone (which isn‚Äôt always the case in some establishments)
The hotel manager Marco even sat down and chatted with me when I first arrived. I also saw him when I was leaving as he‚Äôs often around the front of the hotel which is great and definitely makes a positive impact on service as a whole. 
All the staff were helpful and friendly. I had an amazing time at Seventy and will definitely visit again.",5,2023,01,23

49,The best in Barcelona,"Seventy can‚Äôt be more chic and more central and with its spectacular gastronomy, its pleasant terrace, its stunning spa and pool as well as its very professional staff, it‚Äôs the greatest hotel in Barcelona.

Book your stay at Seventy now, it‚Äôs so easy to get to: 25 minutes from Barcelona airport by taxis and there are many in front of the entrance, and 15 from Barcelona Sants station, via the AVE train. Metro Diagonal is also close as the Hotel is strategically located between Passeig de Gr√†cia and Avinguda Diagonal.",5,2023,01,15
49,Service is everything and there is no shortage of it here!,"My friend and I were visiting Barcelona for the first time. Seventy was the first of many hotels we stayed in over a 2 week period. While the hotel was unique, beautiful and chique, it was the service that made our experience so amazing. I am an executive in the service industry and value high quality customer service over a good breakfast buffet or soft towels (which they certainly had, as well). Seventy gave us that high quality experience‚Ä¶in particular, Borja. He was the bartender our first night. He was super friendly, professional, engaging, and made delicious drinks. We had such a good time that we cancelled our reservations at another restaurant so we could hang at the bar longer. My favorite part of traveling is meeting and talking with the locals. Borja and my experience at Seventy certainly kicked of what was to  be an amazing trip.",5,2023,01,15
49,Amazing!,"This hotel was a dream. The staff especially Valeria were so kind, attentive and helpful - she couldn‚Äôt do enough for us. 
From the minute you walk into the hotel it screams luxury.
 Room size, location, bar, facilities and staff. One of our favourite hotels we have stayed at in Europe! I definitely recommend everyone to stay here if you are visiting Barcelona - location safe for travellers too and a nice cafe just 2 doors down - 10/10",5,2023,01,15
49,Absolutely Recommend!,"We stayed at the hotel for nine days because we truly want to experience Barcelona at a leisurely pace.  

This boutique hotel is a gen in the heart of Barcelona.  It is centrally located and just 15 to 35 minutes walk to the many sights such as the Gothic Quarter, Passeig de Gracia and the Mercado de La Boqueria.  Cab rides to any of the sites is very reasonable from the hotel.

The rooms are chic, luxurious and very comfortable.  We got a room with a private patio and it is great to open the doors and sit and have coffee even in the cool December mornings.

We had breakfast at the hotel every morning.  Breakfast was nice, relaxing, lots of options and really set us up for a busy day of exploring.  

The workout facility is small and you do need to make a reservation to workout but it is very clean and equipped with the basics.

The lobby area including the bar area is just cool and edgy but just very welcoming.  
The architectural and design features of this hotel is impressive.  There is just so much attention to details.

The staff is just amazing!  From the doorman to the wait staff at the restaurant, the spa and especially the front desk are courteous, kind, engaging and very attentive.  

We loved this place so much that we said that a yearly visit to Barcelona in December-January would be nice and that we will only stay at Seventy Barcelona.

Beyond happy with our stay and would absolutely recommend this hotel.

49,Beautiful hotel with amazing service and great location.,"From the moment we arrived at this hotel me and my partner were so impressed firstly by the design and then the customer service! 
We were upgraded to a bigger room for free apon arrival which was lovely and I was shocked to find one of the biggest hotel rooms I have seen with a huge queen bed and lovely bathtub. We had a stunning view from the bedroom.
There rooftop view is amazing and although it was winter it was still warm about 17 degrees so light jacket weather and we bought a bottle of wine and sat upstairs by the pool.
We booked the spa twice which is included for hotel guests and it was so relaxing. After we ordered dinner through room service - the food was so good and they were very accommodating to extra requests such as extra cheese and extra spicy! 
We also went to the bar a few times and I was once again shocked - the service was just outstanding they helped us choose a wine by giving us them to try along with recommendations. Amazing !!

The location was perfect it was a 3 minute walk to one of the most famous streets with all the shops on such as guess Gucci LV and more high steet shops. There are amazing restaurants within a 5 minute walk and it‚Äôs very close to La sagrada familiar and more of Gaudis work!

My and my partner are already thinking to re book here and I can‚Äôt recommend it enough to anyone.",5,2023,01,14
49,"Great location, fantastic stay","We stayed there for three nights. The hotel is in a great location. The room and the hotel were well-designed. Breakfast was decent. We were on a half-board basis, and the dinners were fantastic. All the staff was great and attentive. We liked the indoor pool with a jacuzzi. We definitely would love to come again.",5,2023,01,09
49,Really nice place,"Stayed here for three nights on a sightseeing trip to Barcelona. It's a really nice hotel, just a few steps to the main upscale shopping street. In the other direction is as a more quaint and quirky neighbourhood with lots of independent shops - overall a fantastic location. The decor of the hotel is modern, and all the public areas have clearly been designed with instagram in mind! The room itself was clean and spacious, with all the basic things you would expect, but limited toiletries for sustainability. Bed was comfortable.
Only minuses ‚Äì my room backed on to apartment buildings which made it very overlooked and I had to keep the blinds closed at all times. Also there didn't appear to be a room service breakfast option, so no lazy breakfast in bed before heading out to see the sights. There are a plethora of supermarkets nearby as well as a popular cafe next door as an alternative. If you get the Tourist Bus, there is a a stop (La Pedrera) very near the hotel.",4,2023,01,09
49,Excellent experience for a family.,"We were classic family, and ordered 2 rooms, but didnt expected such a forthcoming - we got connected rooms and lived all time like family, kids had their room, we had ours.
Everyone was friendly.
Liga - lady serving cofee at breakfest should get promotion üòÄ
Barmen knew how to make cocktails.
Hotel clean and tidy.
If we go back to Barcelona - definitely will take the same hotel again
Its near Metro, so you are connected.
Also it is in walking distance from Sagrada Familia and other amenities.
Unfortunately we didnt tried kitchen... as were busy walking and eating around.",5,2023,01,05
49,Exceptional,Absolutely exceptional hotel.  Not fussy fancy but so very carefully curated and comfortable.  Great service.  Great location.  Great comfort.  A total winner of a hotel!!!!!  Beautiful details and aesthetic choices.,5,2023,01,04
49,A beautiful first time in Barcelona,"A very beautiful hotel in Barcelona.  The lobby was just Instagram ready with every angle and nook deserves a photo session.  We stayed in the seventy room over looking the street with the trees giving some shade to the delightful summer sun.  It was a quaint but comfy room with a spacious shower and toilet.  It gave off a crisp and clean feel with modern amenities.  The rooftop pool and bar was a cozy place that invited us to take a dip and drink in the afternoon. I missed to enjoy the beautiful spa but I'm sure it would have been nice to have plunge in the indoor pool. My wife needed to attend a 3am meeting in Singapore and the business office/private library they had in the mezzanine was a delight to have as her temporary office, they even offered coffee in those wee hours.  The breakfast buffet was a delight of variety with tons of bread and pastries, cheeses and hams, our morning experiences was always a delight.  The friendly staff (a lot of them were young trainees) were very helpful and reliable as we ate in their recommended restaurants that were truly sumptuous. One cafe was just around the corner was a total surprise of flavors.  The hotel is located at a nice neighborhood but a bit of a walk to the main retail thoroughfare and quite far from the touristy portions however with the beautiful weather and the many Gaudi buildings along the way it was always a pleasure to have these daily walks.  ",5,2022,12,26
49,A Brilliant Choice in Barcelona,"This hotel was just an all round great experience. The staff were wonderful, the amenities were perfect and the ambience was charming.
Valeria, on the front desk, was our first contact and was an amazing representative for the business - efficient, so helpful and a delightful personality. Thank you to her for that welcome and her ongoing advice and assistance the next day.
The hotel is spotless, the rooms are big and well appointed, the buffet breakfast was great and their service ethic is very impressive.  
We have nothing but high praise for Seventy, Barcelona.
Thank you sincerely.",5,2022,12,18
49,Hotel Seventy,"I wish to compliment all staff in this beautiful hotel
It was faultless and would highly recommend to all this perfect stay in Barcelona.
Valelia on reception was so kind and attentive.
She spent time recommending me the best sights to see and the best places to eat.
She certainly is in the right job. Lovely Lady!
Hoping she will be there when we next book our No1 hotel  [hopefully in a few weeks/ months]
Bar area amazing, spa too and a welcoming smile always at the door as we left and returned each day.

Thankyou Seventy xx

49,"Beautiful Hotel, great amenities","Overall good place to stay when in Barcleona. Location was perfect in a great upscale part of town with easy access to the metro and great tapas restaurants right outside the door of the hotel (try la Pepita across the street). Hotel was well appointed with a nice bar and great decor. Rooms were spacious and relatively clean. There were a few issues mainly with a sewer smell coming from the bathroom that we noticed immediately upon checking in. We notified the staff which were super nice, and they addressed the issue right away by calling maintenance to purge the sewer line in our room, however the smells persisted throughout our stay which was disappointing but luckily we weren't in our room often. It seems this was a common issue as we heard others had similar complaints in their rooms so we neglected to move rooms as it was a hassle and the hotel was full. Hopefully this will get fixed as otherwise its a great property to stay at.",4,2022,12,12
49,"Lovely, modern hotel, centrally located...","Wonderful hotel in a very central location for enjoying the many sights of Barcelona. The rooms are extremely quiet, clean and comfortable. But possibly the most outstanding feature of this property is its staff... always welcoming, friendly, courteous and helpful. I would absolutely recommend this property to any friends.",5,2022,12,12
49,Great and highly recommended!,"Awesome stay at this Hotel. Clean room. Friendly staff. The breakfast, though not much variety but ingredients are fresh and good enough.

The front desk are extremely friendly and helpful. 

You will have a great stay at this hotel",5,2022,12,11
49,Everything Was Perfection!,"There is not a single thing I could find wrong with this hotel. It's a beautiful hotel with large rooms and baths. Plenty of plugs for all your electronics and high end bathroom amenities. If you use a flat iron for your hair leave it at home - they provide this with a blow dryer. There is a complimentary mini-bar in the room stocked daily with water, sodas and mini-bottles of liquor as well as a Nespresso machine for caffeine fiends. The breakfast buffet is well worth the additional 20.50 a day and has a great array of gluten free items too. Service is top notch and we spent many hours at the bar enjoying the company of Alberto who quickly became a highlight of our stay that week. Hotels are notorious for being the most expensive place to drink, but not only was it totally affordable at this hotel we loved hanging out there and talking to the team. 

The location of this hotel cannot be beat - located 2 blocks from Passeig de Gracia you can easily walk to all of the highlights of the city and there is a wealth of great restaurants and tapas bars around each corner. Book with confidence - I will next time I'm in Barcelona.",5,2022,12,09
49,Wonderful hotel! Highly recommend!,"We had a wonderful stay at the hotel. The staff were all very helpful and good. The service was excellent , rooms were clean and very nice. The location was great as the shopping belt and many other attractions were within walking distance. Lots of nice cafes and restaurants around as well.  Perhaps the hotel can look into having more hooks on the wall in the toilet for us to hang our clothes:) Other than that we highly recommend Seventy Barcelona!",5,2022,12,07
49,A truly nice hotel.,"A truly positive experience. The location is üíØ .A stone‚Äôs throw from  passeig de Garcia . The ambience and lay out of the hotel is great.

The staff are truly friendly. 
All in all my new go to place in Barcelona.",5,2022,12,06
49,Best business hotel in Barcelona,"
I have stayed several times at the Seventy.. its close enough (1 block) to passeo de gracia but you can enjoy the real urban vibe of the city and no get all the ramblas tourism‚Ä¶

The rooms are great, the spa is magnificent (You can use the facilities at no cost), and the service is remarkable‚Ä¶

The cocktail bar is a must go (ask for Aurelian or Alberto), great atmosphere and lots of excellent restaurants just around the corner (Book Bar Mut and Molino del pez)

The best hotel for business in Barcelona, and I know several..",5,2022,11,28
49,Fantastic hotel in super location!,"I‚Äôve googled a lot of hotels before I end up to Seventy. If you want a special accomodation in Barcelona, Seventy is the one. 
Seventy is one of the best hotels I‚Äôve ever stayed! It has a vibrant and modern atmosphere that few hotels manage to compete. 
We have stayed at room 106, a Lounge Terrace Room wich was very spacious and beautifully decorated, as all the public areas of the hotel. Breakfast was great with vast variety. 
The personel is very kind and helpful and they‚Äôve suggested us nice, NOT touristic restaurants nearby. 
Seventy‚Äôs location is fantastic. La Pedrera, Casa Batlo and Plaza Catalunya are in a walking distance. 
Thank you at Seventy for making our stay in Barcelona even greater!",5,2022,11,28
49,Best hotel I‚Äôve ever stayed at!,"I can‚Äôt recommend this hotel enough if you are planning a trip to Barcelona. The staff were so generous and went the extra mile to make sure we enjoyed our stay. Our room was amazing and the facilities such as the bar, spa and rooftop pool were absolutely perfect for a couple holiday. I worked with the hotel to plan a surprise for my girlfriend who celebrated her birthday on our second night and it was perfect thanks to Seventy. This hotel was 100% worth the money. ",5,2022,11,23
49,Nice hotel but don‚Äôt expect your room to get cleaned daily,"The hotel and the rooms are great. But don‚Äôt expect housekeeping to clean your room. I have been out of my room from 8am till 4pm or later, and even when I leave the ‚Äúplease clean my room‚Äù sign on my door, it has only been cleaned once out of the three days I have been here so far.

49,Amazing Stay and accommodating at every turn,"Val, Mart√≠ and Pilar and the team are absolute rockstars!

They helped with organising my proposal to my girlfriend ( now fiance) on their beautul roof terrace.

They made sure we were taken care of at every turn and i truly cannot recommend a stay at The Seventy enough.

lovely rooms, great breakfast, fantastic breakfast, and amazing staff!  a stay here is near impossible to fault.",5,2022,11,22
49,Amazing stay!,"Overall, a really amazing stay. Came here with my husband and stayed for 4 nights. It is in a very good location, walking distance to shopping districts and Sagrada Familia about 15 minutes‚Äô walk each. Which are also 2 stops away from the metro (if you do not want to walk too much). Staff are very friendly and helpful with great command of English; they gave us some tips on where to go after we checked in. Upon checking out - they helped us to book a taxi which came almost immediately. 

This is the first hotel I have seen throughout my travels to provide a hair straightener in the room. There is also a complimentary bottle of water replenished each day, when it runs out the staff are nice enough to provide top ups upon request. The room booking also comes with complimentary use of the sauna, gym, and indoor pool (with limitation of 30 minutes) upon slot reservation.

One point of improvement would be if the hotel could add additional corner shelves in the shower area and improve on the shower drainage. The water pressure is very high which is good, but the drainage can‚Äôt keep up so shower area is prone to flooding.

Would love to come back again if we ever come back to Barcelona. Thank you to the staff that greeted us so warmly!

49,Seventy out of Seventy,The Hotel is a lucky find. We came to Barcelona for a bit of warmth and comfort before the winter set in and found it in the smiles of the staff and the comfort of the Hotel. The Hotel is modern with a comfy vibe. We had a Sky room on the 6th floor and it was perfect. Plenty of room for sitting around and a huge 6 foot wide bed. The shower was also big and strong but the light flooding into the room was the star feature. The staff who look after the rooms were brilliant and nothing was too much trouble. Breakfast was plentiful and had something for all tastes. A special mention to Matteo and Roberta in the breakfast/dining area who run a great operation. However the Hotel staff who make the place shine are the two lady chefs who made us poached eggs each morning. It's not often that you come across smiles like theirs that you know are real and genuine. Well done management in Hotel Seventy.,5,2022,11,15
49,"Modern friendly hotel, highly recommended ","Great modern hotel, cosy feel with friendly staff in a great location for sightseeing. Use of spa facilities included, so you can enjoy the sauna and steam room and pool with her sprays. We went in November which was still warm enough to use the rooftop area to relax in during the afternoon but it was too cold for the infinity pool. The breakfast is recommended as there is a great selection of pastries, hams, cheeses, breads, home made cakes, nuts, cereals, lots of fruit, yoghurt, and some cooked  items.  ",5,2022,11,13
49,A comfortable stay far from home!,"We loved our stay at Seventy Barcelona.

49,What can I say? Excellent comes in mind,"We stayed about five days at the Seventy hotel in a room with a terrace. We loved it. Staff was very friendly and supportive. Everything was just excellent. One striking example. I booked some champagne and flowers for our arrival in order to surprise my wife. I expected a bottle, two glasses and a bunch of flowers. However, we did get a bed covered in rose petals, a tremendous looking big bunch of flowers, chocolate that melted on our tongue and did go very well with the champy as well as a wonderful fruit salad. They had done a great job in surprising my wife (and me). And this is just one example. We can thoroughly recommend this hotel, only for that reason. The restaurant was good as well, the bar nice. We liked the location, sort of in the center of everything you want to go to when in Barcelona, being a tourist.",5,2022,11,07
49,Relaxing stay in Barcelona,"The Seventy is a modern, plush hotel to stay in when visiting Barcelona.

49,Fantastic Stay at Seventy,My wife and I visited in October 2022.  From check in to departure Seventy exceeded expectations.  The hotel is trendy and immaculate.

49,Our favourite,"This was our 2nd stay at Seventy and hopefully not the last. It was my husband‚Äôs birthday the day we arrived and he got a lovely message and a bottle of cava as a surprise from the hotel.
All the staff are very friendly and happy to help. 
The public spaces are varied. You can sit at a business- like desk for work or lounge on a sofa or even a cosy booth near the bar
The room was very well designed and has a lovely big comfortable bed 
Breakfast has plenty of selection both healthy or not so - depending on your choice

The hotel is well placed and within walking distance to some of the tourist spots and high end shopping street
Sadly our luggage did not arrive with us (left behind in Luton airport) and we didn‚Äôt get to sightsee as planned as we had to hurriedly buy items for our cruise the next day but our room was ready early and we had time to relax on the lovely roof terrace too
We‚Äôll be back - hopefully with luggage",5,2022,10,20
49,Fantastic hotel with a convenient location ,"We spent 3 nights in a business trip in this lovely hotel. The breakfast had a wide and we'll presented selection of goods, especially the home made cheese cakes and there was serene atmosphere. The room was decorated stylishly. The spa was calm and relaxing and the rooftop pool cool & salty but still very nice. It's located 15 minutes from Sagrada Familia and few minutes from Casa Mil√†. Would definitely stay here again!",5,2022,10,19
49,My new favorite hotel!,"Hotel Seventy is a fantastic place to stay in Barcelona.  The location is ideal - it's really close to the main tourist areas (just a few minutes walk) but just far enough away to get a quiet night's sleep. Public transportation is just a few steps away, and it's an easy journey to/from the airport.  The hotel is beautiful. It has way more character than most high-end properties and the staff were genuine, friendly and welcoming. The rooms aren't huge, which is typical for Europe, but they are beautifully decorated and well-appointed.  The bar was a great place to socialize (not too loud) and the pool/restaurant both looked very inviting. This was our first visit to Barcelona and we chose this hotel purely based on its TripAdvisor rating. It was a perfect choice and we can't wait to return. (PS - a taxi to/from the airport ended up being cheaper than an Uber!)",5,2022,10,12
49,bathroom safety alert,"There are many things to praise about this hotel: ambience, lighting, staff, comfort, location.  On the basis of these positives, I would have liked to have given the full five stars, but unfortunately, they fall down on something crucial.  So.. there are safety fails in the bathrooms, for which potential customers beware!  The main thing is the obvious omission of a grip mat - or non-slip surface - for the bath/shower.   There is nothing to help mitigate the slipping hazard, as there are no handles or rails to grab on to either - especially risky when you are getting out.  Also, since there is a fixed  screen obstructing the access, you can't operate the shower tap and temperature unless you are right inside the shower/bath space.   Staff were informed and the complaint logged.  Please, Seventy: at least provide grip mats, before too many people slip like I did.",4,2022,10,08
49,"Modern, cozy hotel in good location","It's a very good hotel in convenient location, clean rooms, very good breakfast. We had a bad experience with the front desk employee Rebecca and there was no bell boy to help us with the luggage and parking instructions; hence, the rating isn't ""Excellent"". If you travel by car, the parking garage entrance is in the same building 50 meters after you pass hotel's entrance in the very left lane (Carrer Corsega is one-way street), hotel offers a ticket for 1 free hour parking in this garage. And don't waste your time for free/welcome drink in hotels bar. It covers only house wine, sodas, tea or coffee.",4,2022,10,07
49,Great Experience,"Spent three nights at the Seventy in Gracia and had a great experience. The hotel is modern but also warm and inviting. The lobby area is well-designed for socializing as well as making it easy to work or relax with a book. There is a large library of English-language books (though I never saw anyone using them) and a tv room off in one corner (where it wouldn‚Äôt bother anyone else). The staff were all friendly and helpful and spoke great English. They paid attention to customer needs - I overhead one staff calling to check on a resident‚Äôs pet and whether they needed a veterinarian. The rooms were well furnished, comfortable and private. The room had a great shower and the room lighting controls were well thought out (unlike some hotels). The bed was very comfortable and I was not disturbed by any outside noise. I sent in some laundry which was return within just a few hours and at a reasonable price (for a hotel). 

Gracia is a great neighborhood - more of a regular neighborhood not filled with hotels and tourist sights. And perfect for walking. Even so, it‚Äôs just a 20 minute walk to places like the Segrada Familia and there is a high-end shopping street (Cartier, Zara, etc) about a 10 minute walk away if you like that sort of thing. 

I booked with breakfast which was okay but not quite up to that of some similar hotels. The chefs would cook an omelet for you but there was no one to bring coffee or tea. Yes, you can make your own coffee but table service is a nice feature there was no tea available. Dinner outside was quite pleasant though the restaurant was understaffed.  These were small things which did not materially affect a great experience. We‚Äôll return to the Seventy Barcelona.",5,2022,10,06
49,Outstanding,"This hotel is amazing! Everything is clean, very well maintained. Beds are comfortable, amazing shower. Just a little bit noisy in the evening and morning as it‚Äôs located on a busy area.

49,Bueno/Perfecto - Chef's Kiss!,"Loved, loved, loved my stay at Seventy House! So happy to have found (through Instagram s/o @simplycyn) a new place to stay in Barcelona. My long favorite guesthouse closed a few years back and Seventy was definitely a superb choice. From the excellent design, perfect location, welcoming staff and generous, delicious breakfast spread - oh, yes - everything was fantastic! Comfortable beds, nice layout and size (by European standards), excellent showers and welcome amenities, including slippers, full bar, toiletries package (love the Seventy lotion). Beautiful rooftop bar/lounge. Oh, and did I mention the spa? Be sure to take advantage of the spa package - book a massage with Erica if you can. 

Seventy Barcelona you are my new favorite place! Highly recommend and WILL return again!",5,2022,10,03
49,Perfection,I had been researching hotels in Barcelona for nearly two years having to have to cancel twice due to Covid. In 20 years of traveling and 70 countries I have never said this word before to describe a hotel. PERFECT. The various websites rate this a 4 star hotel and by all means I hope no one finds it. The reason as I am told has to do with a few deficiencies such as late night room service. Otherwise this was a hotel that out performed expectations. Photos dont do it justice amazing design incredible staff flawless smooth check in and check out. Great bar and super staff there. Terrific neighborhood with a phenomenal room at a very doable price. All these good reviews are no joke. Ill be back.,5,2022,10,03

49,Nice. Êé®Ëñ¶,"Stay three days for the vacation with my wife. Live this place. Worth the money. Nice staff. Great room. Clean and comfortable. Good location. Swimming pool is a bit small, just for fun is ok. The restaurant next to the hotel is really good. Will recommend.",5,2022,09,27
49,Stunning hotel!!,This place is stunning at every turn! The service of the staff was on point and fantastic. Breakfast and lunch were also really yummy. I can't wait to visit again and I will be telling all my friends.,5,2022,09,26
49,TOP NOTCH SERVICE AND QUALITY,"Excellent hotel in a very convenient area of Barcelona, near main attractions and walking distance from Ciutat Vella. Friendly and helpful staff, comfortable rooms, very well designed, having guests comfort in mind. Savoury breakfast, offering a wide variety of both salty and sweet choices. Cannot find any fault, it exeeded our expectations.",5,2022,09,24
49,A Barcelona Boutique,"An absolutely lovely boutique hotel.  Rooms are spacious, clean and well appointed.  The overall esthetic of the hotel is lovely.  Location is perfect, walking distance to eveything, plus metro near by.  But not in the heart of the tourist zones, so its quiet. The rooftop deck and pool are an added bonus. Breakfast was great, many healthy options. I would recommend to anyone going to Barcelona. ",5,2022,09,24
49,Perfect hotel for a long weekend in Barcelona,"We chose the Seventy based on the great reviews here on Tripadvisor, and I can only concur with them: The hotel is new and stylish, has a great location (close to many sights, but in a rather quiet, residential neighborhood), stylish, well equipped and clean rooms, friendly staff, a nice bar and a small, but stylish rooftop pool. 
Thanks to the great staff at the Seventy hotel for making our stay special (and for the bottle of Cava for our wedding anniversary). 
We will be glad to return to the Seventy next time we are in Barcelona.",5,2022,09,18
49,Stunningly Chic,"My husband and I visted Barcelona for the first time as our ""Mini Moon"" break and the city did not disappoint. After some research I decided on this hotel and I'm very happy I did. Staff were amazing so attentive, friendly and always someone around. Bar staff always welcoming, rooftop pool is small but still lots of seating available. I attended the Spa which was a nice treat to myself and it didn't disappoint. The security of the hotel was very reassuring. A member of staff on the door at all times.No access to lifts or floors without cards. Room was freshened up everyday on request, straightners and hairdryer which are essential on my travel list and location was fantastic. I didn't realise how big the city is so comfortable walking shoes are essential. All in all couldn't fault this hotel. It was everything we wanted and more.",5,2022,09,12
49,Fabulous hotel stay in Barcelona,"Stayed here with a friend and had to say it exceeded our expectations. They hotel itself is great. The moment you walk into the hotel area you realise it is even more impressive in real life than it‚Äôs pictures. We particularly loved the bar downstairs which did a range of cocktails. It has both an inside and outside bar area, both of which were beautiful.  It had a rooftop pool and bar area as well.

We used the spa area twice which was great, and we got half an hour everyday included in our stay.

The room itself was gorgeous. Comfy beds, spacious and was soundproofed. We loved the fact we could link our phones and play music through the speaker system. There were blackout blinds and we overlooked the patio area.

The only little nudges we did have with the room was that at night the room was aglow with all the plug socket lights (we just pulled out the key card which meant the room was completely dark, but on the flip side you couldn‚Äôt charge things overnight)  there was a sliding door to the toilet and shower but the sinks etc was in the main room. However these are just minor things and wouldn‚Äôt stop me going again. 

The staff were so friendly as well.  Breakfast was amazing! So much choice. I am Coeliac so can‚Äôt eat gluten but everyday they provided some delicious warm gluten free bread, there was also a gluten free area at breakfast with a selection of food.

Overall an amazing stay and would be my number one choice for staying in Barcelona going forward.",5,2022,09,12
49,Great Hotel,"We were extremely surprised of the service in this hotel and how clean and nice was our room. The bed was very comfortable too, the AC worked great, the bathroom was nice . When we go back to Barcelona we will stay in this hotel again. Our room had a back patio where we could sit and relax.",5,2022,09,12
49,"Great hotel, comfortable beds and nice rooms","This hotel is very good. Rooms are  nice, modern and overall very nice. Bed is very comfortable. Room is equipped with all necessary items such as hairdryer and even a mini hair straightener which is very practical! Staff is friendly. The overall hotel experience is great. Would definitely recommend it.",5,2022,09,10
49,Great hotel great location,Great boutique hotel. Great location. The nicest section of Barcelona. The staff is great. Most of them speak English. The rooms are good size and the beds are awesome. The decor when you enter the hotel looks beautiful. This is one of my favorite hotels I've ever stayed. You can walk to a 100 bars and restaurants and the drive to almost everything you want to see is 5-10 minutes. Most expensive taxi ride was $11. Taxis are everywhere and the staff will always get a taxi in a minute or two in front of hotel. The food at the roof top bar was delicious. Just an overall great place to stay. I can't say enough about this hotel. You won't regret it.,5,2022,09,10
49,Lovely Stay!,"Very cool vibe and seemingly younger people staying here. Rooftop pool, spa, gym, restaurant/bar and a good location. There are many places within walking distance in terms of food (La Pepita across the street had excellent tapas). Taxi cabs are plentiful. Beds, towels/linens, in room amenities all high quality. First European hotel I‚Äôve stated in that had a Hair straightener iron-nice with all the heat/humidity outdoors. My only wish was that they had an old fashioned concierge on staff - language barrier and lack of direction were a little frustrating. Would definitely stay again.",5,2022,09,05
49,VALUE FOR MONEY AND HIGHLY RECOMMENDED,"I stayed at this hotel for three nights and I highly recommend it. The services are 100%, good hospitality, nice food, excellent location, incredible ambiance and rooms are quite spacious and well kept. 
I will definitely come back next month.",5,2022,09,04
49,Fabulous,"Fabulous hotel and we enjoyed every moment.
Great location, in Exaimple area
Perfect designed rooms. 
The breakfast was fantastic, with a lovely patio area.
The hotel has an excellent wellness area.
We loved the style of the hotel design.
We definitely would come again.",5,2022,09,01
49,Geat hotel!,"Great place to be!

the hotel was very good. we stayed in room 109, the room with the terrace. I advise everyone to get a room with a terrace, it makes all the difference. On the other floors above, the windows do not open.
 
All the rooms have an audio system that you can connect to with your phone and play whatever music you want (they have speakers in the bathroom as well).
 
mini-bar in the room with coffee and tea maker.
 
the breakfast is very good, many options to choose from, the terrace opens at 9:00.
 
There are 2 swimming pools, one on the upper terrace and another inside, but we didn't get to use them.
 
the staff knows English well and are ready to help you. We asked them for some cables for charging and for the TV and they granted them to us.
 
the hotel is in a good area, next to it is a very good and beautiful restaurant, which I recommend. You can take a taxi to get to all the areas of interest, for 5-10 euros, for the situation where you don't want to walk a lot.
 
I recommend the hotel.",5,2022,08,30
49,"Book now, it's amazing!!","Location.
The location is fab. Less than 30 mins from Barcelona airport. A 5 min walk to high end shops like YSL, Chanel, Gucci etc, walk a further 5 mins for all the high street favourites such as Zara and H and M. Another 15 minutes and there are local handmade boutiques.
Approx 15 min walk to Sadigrad Familiar, and Gaudi buildings are within 10 mins walk. You can catch the open top bus tour 5 minutes walk from the hotel.
A walk to the beach and marina is about 45 minutes if you are not distracted by all the shops and culture on route.

Facilities.
This hotel is beautiful. The communal areas are spacious, well decorated and spotlessly clean. 
The rooms have a spacious feel and are modern and well equipped. They are very very quiet. The room has Bluetooth speakers built in so you can play music via your phone, the volume is limited so as not to disturb other guests. Not only is a standard hairdryer avaliable in the room but so are hair straighteners. Complimentary shampoo, body wash etc is not in those annoying single use plastic minis but infact via refillable bottles.
The bed is huge and very very comfortable, electric blinds ensure a dark room but with small nightlights. As usual there is a minibar, iron, safe, and a nespresso machine and kettle etc.
The gym is small but very well equipped. A booking system ensures it does not get overcrowded at all.
The spa is great for a little R and R. The sessions are a little short at 1/2 hrs but ensure there is lots of opportunity for everyone to use them. Again, the booking system means the spa is never crowded.
The rooftop pool area is gorgeous, a real luxury for the middle of a city. It does get very very hot up there though so a little more shade could be nice.

Food.
We stayed half board and absolutely loved the food. Healthy, tasty and well presented. We stayed for 12 nights and are vegetarian so our choices were very limited meaning we ate the same foods over. I appreciate though that most guests would not stay so long so it would not be an issue. I do however feel the hotel would benefit from some more veggie/ vegan offerings both at lunch/ dinner but also at breakfast.

Staff.
To say the staff were amazing does not do them justice, they really made our stay fabulous. There was nothing that was too much trouble and they were so so friendly. Always so happy to see us and tolerant of my husbands continued attempts at Spanish.
Special mention to Richardo, Victor, Barbara, Laura, Alexo, the lovely lady with the peacock tatoo and the bar staff.
Thank you so much Seventy.... we will be back for sure.",5,2022,08,29
49,Love this hotel,"I found this hotel by mistake. I was looking online for a while and stumbled onto it. What a great find.
It‚Äôs in a great area, not far from everything. 
Their are good restaurants around.
The staff at the hotel are friendly and accommodating.
The hotel itself looks exactly like it does in the photos.
Modern hotel, reception is impressive.
We received a welcome drink voucher, that was a nice touch.
Our room was great. It had a mini bar, coffee machine and kettle. Complimentary water. The bed and the pillows were comfortable. 
Really clean.
In the bathroom, they had a few really handy supplies. Toothbrushes and toothpaste. They had a razor and shaving creme.  They also had a lovely shower gel, and body moisuriser.
Their were three windows that were from the ceiling to the floor- gorgeous. They were covered by ceiling to floor wooden slate blinds but they openened like a door if you wanted or you could just use them as blinds. Despite being at the front of the hotel, it was a very quiet hotel. No noise from the road outside. We did hear someone above us who had very heavy feet. Thankfully that didn‚Äôt last long. 
This hotel is now on my list of go to hotels.  

",5,2022,08,29
49,Positive Vibes Only!! I Will Return,"This hotel is spot on in every way. From the moment I checked in to checkout I had a wonderful time and received A+ service. Walking in to the lobby and you're instantly met with modern and chic decor, and friendly faces. When I checked in, my room wasn't ready so I went down to their spa, which was very luxurious and reasonably priced. I got a massage and facial - wish I could do this every time I flew!! 

My room was ready before the estimated time and my bags were already taken up. I was on the 6th floor and didn't have much noise. Rooms were beautifully made and came with a hair straightener - traveling from the US this rocked! There aren't any entertainment apps (i.e., Netflix) on your TV but honestly...I didn't miss it after my first night. The Rooftop pool is gorgeous with tons of room and places to sit in the sun and the shade. SERVICE WAS WONDERFUL. Food and cocktails were delicious.

Most importantly, I was traveling ALONE and for business (working east coast hours 3p-11p), and I felt completely safe and comfortable. I worked from the rooftop and the lobby cafe in the afternoons and one night I was working until 12am in the bar and was treated with such care. The food was also very well priced and SO good. Big shoutout to Fernando at the bar - he is so sweet and kind - always makes sure his guests are okay. 

Lastly, the location was perfect for what I was looking for. It's set back just enough from Pg. de Gracia without being a hike to get anywhere. I was in walking distance to great local spots, bars, and sights. Later in the week I stayed at another hotel just off La Ramblas / city center for work and I longed for Seventy Barcelona! 

Thank you to Seventy!! I will be singing your praises forever and am destined to return soon.",5,2022,08,26
49,A Perfect Little Jewel Box!,"This hotel is close to perfect.   Built in 2019, all the decor is chic and modern.  The location is great for tourists as well. Everything is spotless.  But what makes it so great is its fabulous service--and at reasonable prices.  All requests for our room were taken care of in minutes and there was plentiful staff at the front desk.  The hotel made us multiple dinner reservations, mostly at the places within walking distance.  The small downsides for American travelers were little air-conditioning in the ground floor (there are regulations in Spain about this to preserve energy) and a tiny gym.",5,2022,08,25
49,Fabulous,"What an amazing hotel. We‚Äôve just spent two night here and we couldn‚Äôt fault it. Superb service, beautifully designed, great bar and drinks, dinner was fantastic - the ribs are divine. The roof terrace and pool are lovely place to chill out. Great location within walking distance of most of the city. We really hope to be back one day.",5,2022,08,22
49,"From the moment you arrive, the Vibe is awesome","This is one out of the box. Faultless is a big call but this place not only oozes class, the feel around the Hotel is fantastic.  Exceptionally appointed, the decor is chic, the staff are outstanding. Rooms are smaller but set out brilliantly and the bar and lobby are picture book. Given i will be extending a few more days, that says it all. Plenty of cafes, bars and eateries in immediate area also. Tick tick tick.",5,2022,08,21
49,Great Stay for Barcelona First Timers,"Modern hotel with all the amenities but never felt too big. Great location near Sagrada Famillia and about 20-25 minute walk to Gothic Quarter. Great rooftop including pool provided nice oasis to reload between late lunch and later dinner. Staff very helpful in all regards. We had a lounge terrace room which provided great option for morning coffee (nespresso machine in room) and outside table provided space to plan evening and next day. Our adult daughter had a Seventy room on higher floor which could easily accommodate a couple. Very quiet, cool (it was hot!), and dark in room which enhanced overnight recovery! Very much looking forward to next stay in Barcelona and the Seventy! Great authentic restaurant option right across the street and close to the Avenida Diagonal shopping.",5,2022,08,20
49,Very nice new hotel,"A modern and very nice hotel with a rooftop bar&swimming pool. Excellent spa. A very nice patio garden where it‚Äôs perfect to have the breakfast in the morning (copious). Delicious kitchen and a lively bar. The rooms are modern and comfortable with Bluetooth speakers in the ceiling. The climatisation is silent and work perfectly which was a great advantage in this warm august month.
The personal is very friendly and attentive, fulfilling all the wishes and requests.
The situation is also excellent for visiting some of the main attractions of Barcelona by foot. Casa Mila about 5 min, Casa Battlo 8 min, Sagrada Familia 15 min. And the Passeig the Gr√†cia is just around the corner which is perfect for shopping. We were able to enjoy the beginning of the Fiesta the Gr√†cia and its colourful streets. At that time of the year that area in Barcelona becomes very lively and it‚Äôs a one week party all around the area.
Many good restaurants are also just a few steps from the hotel.
We will definitely stay there again on our next trip to Barcelona.",5,2022,08,20
49,"New, modern, out of the way","Stayed here for four nights while visiting Barcelona.  New hotel with a modern chic look.  Walkable to the Gaudi sites such as Casa Mila, Casa Batlow, Sagrada Familia.  Good bar with great ambiance.  Pool area is nice to relax and chill - although the pool size is small so it‚Äôs not exactly Olympic size.  In terms of location plenty of restaurants and shops around but it‚Äôs dead at night.  Most of the action (especially at night) is south of the city around the Las Ramblas and Barceonnette area.  It‚Äôs also a 5-10 minute walk to the bus/metro from the hotel.  You have your high end stores in the area but if you didn‚Äôt come to Barcelona to shop, you‚Äôre probably better off at another location.  Overall, hotel is clean, new, and friendly.",4,2022,08,17
49,Brilliant stay,"Lovely modern but unique hotel.

Rooms were super tidy and clean, gorgeous decor and HUGE comfy bed. 

Only slight fault for us would be having to book the spa to use the pool and only being allowed 30 minutes a day however everything else was fab!

Didn‚Äôt explore the rooftop as the weather wasn‚Äôt suited when we went so I can‚Äôt comment on that. 

Overall we would definitely stay here again if coming back to Barcelona, it was a good walking distance from most places.",5,2022,08,17
49,Very Cool Hotel,"Our travel agent booked this for us before we hopped on a cruise and we were not disappointed.Stunning reception area and friendly staff at check in.You also received a voucher for a complimentary drink which was a nice touch.The rooms were spotless with lovely crisp white linen and with the exception of robes ( which oddly were not in the rooms but you could pick up from reception ) all the amenities you needed were there.The bar was lovely and the breakfast in the outside courtyard was delicious ( on the healthy side which suited me more than my husband)
So convenient for a couple of small bars and Las Ramblas.
Very sofisticated and had a really cool vibe.Would stay again.",4,2022,08,16
49,Pampered by Seventy,"I chose Seventy because we had passed by during an earlier trip and it looked quite new and well designed. We were assigned a handicap room which was really not ideal, but the staff were able to change my room on request. Try not to get a room on the second floor that only has windows overlooking the interior garden ‚Äî people walking past can look straight into your room. 
The pool was a delight to sit by in the summer heat, offering a big selection of drinks, and lots of lounging arrangements.  After the sun goes lower, go to the other side of the building‚Äôs terraces to catch more light. 
We had a late return flight, so we really wanted to shower after a day walking around. The team kindly let us use the spa / gym‚Äôs facilities to get refreshed, which was hugely appreciated.
I look forward to coming back!",5,2022,08,14
49,A PERFECT 5  - An amazing experience!,"What an amazing vibe, and incredible first day! The service is absolutely remarkable!  Everyone is so happy to help, always with a smile on their face!  my husband and I enjoyed our first lunch at the hotel after a long morning at the Park Guell.  Laura and Roberta were just wonderful and made us feel so welcome! They both went out of their ways to make sure we had everything we needed to enjoy a beautiful, relaxing meal.  We‚Äôll definitely have lunch here again, if not just to see our friends Laura and Roberta again! PS - the food was extraordinary!!!",5,2022,08,14
49,Excellent Hotel in the middle of everything!!!,"My wife and I recently did a Mediterranean cruise and we stayed at Seventy Barcelona before and after the cruise.  This hotel is awesome!!!  The hotel is fairly new and well kept.  The entire staff is great!!!  Front desk very helpful booking dinner reservations, answering questing and even requesting taxis.  The pool on the roof is nice and the spa is very relaxing.  The bar and dining area are great too.  Roberta makes a fantastic cappuccino!!!  Getting to landmarks like Sagrada Familia, La Catedral, La Pedrera, Plaza Catalunya, La Rambla, etc. are within walking distance from the hotel.  We are already planning on going back next year.",5,2022,08,10
49,One of the best hotel,"Seventy Barcelona was one of my best hotel experience so far.
The interior design, professional service, the most spectacular room ( just like in the picture) the food, the bar...the whole ""vibe"" of this hotel is something extremely good.
",5,2022,08,09
49,Perfect hotel for exploring Barcelona,"Had such a lovely stay at Seventy. The hotel is stunning, lovely lobby area, bar, restaurant whichnall look gorgeous and the staff are very friendly and helpful too. Breakfast is great - lots of choice and lovely to sit outside too. 

I stayed in a Basic room as a solo traveller which was ideal for me but may be on the tight side for 2, but is more than adequate for a few days stay. Super quality room and super quiet as well. I stayed in 523 which was away from the lift and had a lovely street view. Only thing to note is if you don‚Äôt like bright light in the room bring some dark tape, there are these small blue night lights next to the bed that are quite powerful so I had to cover them up at night. 

Rooftop pool area lovely also with bar and nice big sun lounges with lots of space. Treated myself to a massage as well which I‚Äôd recommend. 

Location is ideal for exploring the city and would highly recommend the hotel.",5,2022,08,04
49,Absolutely perfect stay!,"The hotel is absolutely beautiful. Our stay was perfect. Location is excellent. For couples with kids the size of the rooms might prove to be a problem but it was perfect for us as a couple. 

I have no negative feedback!",5,2022,08,04
49,Excellent stay,"I booked the Seventy based on reviews I had read on TA and was definitely not disappointed.
We have visited Barcelona on more than 7/8 occasions and would generally stay near the Marina but decided it would be good to try a different area and explore new places . The location was excellent with lots of bars and restaurants nearby but the best part was the hotel itself ,the design ,look and layout  was just amazing . We had a terrace room booked for 3 nights and it was fantastic, large bed , gorgeous bathroom and an amazing terrace to relax on and then the bonus was the rooftop pool and bar which was amazing.
I probably would have only given this a rating of 4 due to some issues, small injury to my hand and the hotel losing power on the morning of our departure , but the way my issues were handled so professionally by the front office manager Victor meant nothing less than a 5 star review would be acceptable.
Looking forward to returning in the very near future",5,2022,08,02
49,Loved this hotel. Reminded me of the Library hotel in New York. Super modern design and high ceilings. Roof top pool.,Loved this hotel. Reminded me of the Library hotel in New York. Super modern design and high ceilings. Roof top pool with comfy sunloungers. The only downside is no vegetarian dishes on the pool menu. Great power shower in the rooms and the bed and bedding are high quality. One of the best breakfasts I've seen. A huge selection of everything and anything you could possibly want even catering to gluten free. Full marks for having proper sound proofing as well. You literally cannot hear a thing from the rooms it's completely silent (a rarity in Barcelona). Would definitely choose this hotel again.,5,2022,07,30
49,A luxurious stay,"A luxurious hotel at the city center. The metro station is almost right next to the hotel which is really practical, though due to the good location it is also easy to walk anywhere. 

A special thanks to the extremely friendly and nice staff ‚Äì we weren‚Äôt the easiest customers due to two separate bookings but everything was taken care of.",5,2022,07,28
49,"Great hotel: Comfortable room, lovely pool, hip decor","I loved the decor of the lobby and public areas, and loved my comfortable room (which had a garden patio; obviously these rooms are on the first floor).
We also loved being able to use the roof top pool at the end of a hot day walking around the city.  
Personally, I prefer staying in the gothic quarter in Barcelona, but this hotel is a great option if you want to be in the center, which is where I needed to stay for this visit (to visit my daughter).  
The restaurant has a large outdoor area (a courtyard of sorts) with trees. We had good meals there.",5,2022,07,27
49,Amazing Hotel Great Location,"This was our first trip to Spain so we were a little worried about the size of the rooms.  We were more than happy with the accommodations at Seventy Barcelona.  From the moment you enter the lobby, you feel welcomed.  The swanky look and vibe are seen throughout the hotel.   The check-in staff was young but very helpful for our group of 6.  When we arrived it was too early for check-in so they tagged our bags and we went to explore the city.   

The hotel was very clean and the staff was friendly.  The rooftop pool, dining, and bar areas were amazing.  Breakfast was great each morning as well.  There were many choices even for the pickiest eater.   The made-to-order egg station was one of my favorites.  In the morning workers were busy making sure you had everything you needed and also prepping the courtyard dining area for lunch.   The hotel has multiple bars and some cool areas to just get off into a corner and relax.  Make sure to check out the Blue Room down the hall from the breakfast area.  The room is a whole vibe.

The rooms have blackout shades that are controlled by a little switch by the bed.   Make sure to find it before you go to bed.  I guess due to the time difference we only closed the shutters to our room later to be wakened early by the bright sun.   The next morning we found the switch to control the mechanical blinds!!!

The pool is small on the roof but it was adequate.  One end is all glass so you can see other areas of the rooftop as you swim toward your friends.   There is also a restaurant on the rooftop and an outdoor bar.   I forgot the manager‚Äôs name but they were going over some things on the menu for the day with the staff when I was taking pictures.  I mentioned the fresh herbs in the large containers and he gave me a quick walkthrough of the herbs and some of the dishes they use them in as well as drinks.   If the poolside is busy and you want to be out and reading a book go to the opposite side when you arrive at the rooftop.  It has an area just opposite the pool that is covered and is good for a large group to sit and chill.  On that side, you can see a view of the city and the streets below.

The Spa and Gym are small but both were very well maintained.    If working out is your thing go early.   There are only two treadmills, one elliptical, and one stationary bike, some medicine balls, and some dumbbells.   I think you can also reserve a time to use the gym and the hydro pool.  

The hotel is within walking distance of many places.   We were able to walk to the ¬†Sagrada Familia in less than 15 mins.  We may have gotten there sooner but with so many great places along the way to grab food and snacks we got distracted. We had a great stay and would recommend this hotel. Oh, the last thing is the elevators are small compared to American elevators so large groups may have to take separate elevators.  

Overall it was an amazing hotel!

Any questions just ask",5,2022,07,26
49,Resort oasis in the middle of the city,"My husband and I love this hotel. The rooms are well appointed, the bed is amazingly comfortable, breakfast delicious  and the amenities of the hotel are perfect.

It feels like a resort in the middle of the city.

Well located and the staff are beautiful and friendly. The rooftop pool is great and the areas to eat or rest around the hotel feel very luxurious.

I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2022,07,25
49,Value for money,"Well the hotel is pretty new, rooms are large & comfortable, location is right in the centre, only let down was  breakfast options, very limited options! Bar at ground floor has excellent set up, we used spa which was excellent, rooftop pool & bar  is also vey nice !",5,2022,07,24
49,Highly recommended,"Hotel itself is beautifully decorated, the finishing touches have been thought through with no expense spared. 

It is very clean throughout and having a pool in the city, especially whilst it has been so hot on this trip has been a saviour. 

The location for me is perfect, most will want to stay as close to Las Ramblas as possible for their own reasons, however, I just wouldnt! This is more central to everything, on good commute routes. 

The staff are very friendly and very helpful, most speak many languages. 

I couldn‚Äôt recommend this hotel enough, 1 of the best I have ever stayed in.",5,2022,07,18
49,Absolutely outstanding!!,"This hotel is off the charts awesome! Aside from the fantastic location, fabulous interiors, great rooms and food, enough cannot be said about the staff! We had an unfortunate incident of a family member fall ill during our stay and Param and Didac went out of their way to make sure she was cared for and well looked after - arranging medical attention, food, laundry etc as well as being incredibly flexible with our bookings. If you need a hotel in Barcelona don‚Äôt think twice - Seventy Is your home away from home!! We will be back for sure!

49,Super Cool Hotel,"Loved it ! We had a patio room which is well worth the extra charge and the kids had a Sky room which they also loved.  Staff are very professional and attentive (without being fussy)  and the roof top terrace with bar and pool (with a view of the Segrada Familia) was a wonderful place to chill (opens 11am to 9.00am, just wish it opened earlier). The pool is lovely, not massive, but roof top pools are normally a bit smaller.  Everything about this hotel is top notch, and even though (I think) it was full, it still felt quiet and calm, with loads of space for everyone.  And just over the road at La Pepita, there is a great Tapas restaurant.",5,2022,07,13
49,Excellent Hotel for4* Rating,"Stayed 5 nights in June/July. Had room with Terrace on 1st floor. Spacious, clean and very comfortable large bed. Bath and shower. Private screened terrace with table and large deck chairs to relax. Excellent breakfast choices. Bar and restaurant pricey for 4* but it's central Barcelona, so structure expectations. The hotel is located within a 20 min walk of many key central attractions, but beach needs a taxi or 40 min walk. That said hotel has a great pool and sun deck on 7th floor with bar and food services. So when you do have the couple of hours to kill, it's very convenient to top up the tan or even work/relax under the cabana covers. Service was very good and all areas of the hotel were kept clean. Wifi across the site is complimentary and there are several small bars and restaurants within 5 mon walk serving local and international food options. All rooms have sound proofing but inside rooms are very quiet and still have views. Very high 4* standard, pleasantly surprised.",5,2022,07,10
49,The hotel is beautiful.  The staff is young and detached.,"Beautiful hotel.  Amazing design and very comfortable rooms.  
Staff is young, aloof, inexperienced and detached. 
Front desk staff is not particularly warm or inviting.   Bartenders will get you a drink when they feel like it.  
No concierge.  Front desk has no connections to restaurants or events.  They just pull up google. 
Overall, such an nice motel.  Can someone train the staff to be more hospitable and helpful?",4,2022,07,08
49,One of my top 5 favorite hotels in 79 countries!!!,"The suite on Floor 1 at Seventy Barcelona is going to go down as one of our top five favorite hotel rooms in 50 years of travel through 79 countries! Yes, it is that good! Finally, a hotel with multiple USB charging ports, supportive mattresses for weary backs, and piles of soft pillows. Everything was considered during the construction of this hotel, from the well-insulated windows that block out the city noise to the sophisticated light switches for all moods.

There is even an automated blind system lowered by remote control to black out the room at night! And the television is massive! The mirrored portions of walls really give the illusion of a large room being even bigger! But the private back porch lined with plants absolutely put this suite over the top! This room truly feels like home! The personnel at the front desk are among the most professional and welcoming I‚Äôve ever met. The employees in the spa are incredibly personable, and the massages are very relaxing!",5,2022,07,06
49,"Excellent hotel, its rooms, amenities, staff","We stayed at Seventy Barcelona hotel between June 26 and July 5, 2022. Barcelona, it seems, has hotels on every corner so it was challenging to decide which hotel to book. Thankfully, for all the reviews, I landed on Seventy Barcelona, and have no regrets.
Overall: I can‚Äôt find any faults in the hotel. I‚Äôm not too picky but I expect quality and comfort when staying in the hotels and this hotel definitely delivers that. It is a 4 star hotel and it definitely deserves it, if not more. I highly recommend this hotel for medium budget travelers. 
Location: Excellent. The location of the hotel is excellent and within walking distance to everything. It takes less than 20 min to walk to Casa Mila, 15 minutes to walk to Sagrada Familia, shopping strip on Passeig de Gracia, many restaurants and cafes. Popular restaurant ‚Äì La Pepita ‚Äì is right across the street. 
Amenities: This hotel is only 3 years old and everything there is new. Hotel lobby is amazing with nice d√©cor, lots of sitting areas, computer desks with power plugs. Hotel has a rooftop patio with a swimming pool which was not something I cared about when booking the hotel but it was a nice bonus and we ended up enjoying the pool and relaxing on comfortable chairs after all day walking, shopping and sightseeing. Rooftop has a nice view and you can see Sagrada Familia from it. I was surprised that not many guests took advantage of the rooftop terrace and the pool which was fine with me as we enjoyed a lot of privacy while spending time there. The spa was a nice bonus too and we ended up booking couple‚Äôs massage. The spa has a gym, dry sauna and a pool. The hotel has a restaurant which looks nice but we ended up eating in the city and didn‚Äôt bother paying for breakfast which was a good decision as many days we slept in.
You can buy tickets for Sagrada Familia, Hop on Hop off Bus and other attractions from the hotel reception which is convenient.
Staff: Great. The hotel staff is very welcoming, respectful, speaks English and ready to accommodate their guest needs. Check-in was quick and the staff took the time to explain everything the hotel has to offer. We had an issue with water in the shower not draining and they fixed it right away. One of the staff ‚Äì Didac ‚Äì was especially helpful. He was very enthusiastic to explain about the hotel, its amenities, location. He was always greeting us by name which made us feel special. I couldn‚Äôt figure out how to adjust the AC in the room and Didac personally went up to the room and adjusted the temperature. 
Room: Excellent. We booked the Patio room and it was definitely worth the upgrade. The room overlooked the courtyard and not the street and was very quiet. The room was spacious with a long hallway, two closets, coffee maker, mini fridge and a safe. Water bottle in the room is complimentary and you can order more if you run out. The room has AC which is adjustable. The king bed and bedding were very comfortable. Some people complained about bathroom‚Äôs open concept, but it didn‚Äôt bother us as the shower and toilet are enclosed and only the sink area is open concept. The shower takes a bit getting used to. Just leave the lever on in the middle position for a few minutes and let the water to warm up. The shower is spacious. The TV in the room is huge but doesn‚Äôt have too many English speaking or entertainment channels but has CNN and BBC to catch up on the news. Wi-Fi is complimentary and works everywhere in the hotel.",5,2022,07,06
49,Beautiful Hotel with Excellent Service,"My 18 year old daughter and I stayed at the Seventy Barcelona last week and we were very impressed!  We arrived early in the day because we flew in on a red eye flight.  The front desk staff was friendly and was able to get us into our hotel room early, which was very much appreciated!  The whole property is beautiful and incredibly clean.

We enjoyed the pool area and received very attentive service from the waiters there.  The inside bar is beautiful and the staff is very friendly and attentive.  Alberto was especially great, he took great care of us and gave us recommendations for the rest of our stay in Spain.  Thank you Alberto!

We will definitely stay at Seventy Barcelona on our next trip!",5,2022,07,06
49,Beautiful Hotel. Amazing Staff. Perfect Stay.,"Seventy Barcelona is a fabulous hotel. Beautiful, bright, spotless. The staff is absolutely outstanding‚Äî‚Äîthe best. Everyone was unfailingly kind, professional, helpful, friendly, competent, and courteous‚Äî‚Äîthe front desk, waitstaff, bartenders, bellmen, housekeeping, and the people at the spa. All greeted me warmly every time they saw me, remembered what I drank and what I had for dinner the night before, encouraged me with my terrible Spanish, and made sure I had everything I needed right away. I saw them treating everyone else the same way.

At first, I didn‚Äôt know about the location, but I came to love it. There are great restaurants of all kinds, from coffee shops to Michelin stars and everything in between; great shopping; and major sights all very close by. All the major sights seemed to be a 20 or 30 minute walk. I walked to Sagrada Familia, Parc Guell, and Palau de la Musica. 

The restaurant has very good food. It was comforting to know that I could come back to the hotel tired and hungry and count on a delicious, fairly priced lunch or dinner. One night I just needed a little something before bed, and I had delicious gazpacho sitting at the bar with my glass of wine. It was late and not very busy, and the kitchen asked if I wanted anything more before they closed. (You see what I mean about the service?) I especially liked the anchovies, the beans with octopus, and the spinach salad. 

I loved the seating options. The booths are quite private. Tables are less private, but well-spaced and have charging stations. There is a large table where one might strike up a conversation with a fellow traveler. The bar is large, beautiful, and welcoming. Best of all is the lovely, shady courtyard.

The spa is beautiful with fair prices. Raquel gave a great massage.

I just could not ask anything more of a hotel. It was a perfect stay. I hated to leave, and I hope I can stay there again.",5,2022,07,05
49,Great experience,"Upon arrival everything about the hotel was just like the pictures I had seen and expected. The hotel is new and modern and the staff very helpful and friendly. The location is walking distance from everything. The hotel bar was great and it‚Äôs staff Alberto and Aurelian were excellent, professional, helpful and entertaining and made us feel right at home.",5,2022,07,04
49,Argumentative and no can do attitude,"I made a simple request. I lost my first night here due to my airline cancelling my flight. I had to reroute via a different airport to get here and was tired. I am what could be referred to as elderly.
Their checkout time unusually for Barcelona hotels is 11am and asked for a 1 pm check out. They made Such a song and dance regarding this request coupled with with a box ticking obsession with their policy I was sorry I asked in the first place. 
The fact that a duty manager is not empowered to make such a simple decision (until the day of checkout)  says a lot about the product. For me what it says is ‚Äúit‚Äôs about us ‚Äú and the pomposity and arrogance of the duty manager bore that out. He didn‚Äôt listen nor did he care as to my reason for the request in the first place and he had no sense of discernment other than his boxes. He would do well to remember that he deals with people and courtesy and helpfulness is a requirement.

The hotel is more than comfortable. Excellent bedding, bathroom amenities and chic design features. The breakfast was excellent and as with the hotel itself represented great value for money.  Such a pity that such a modern and elegant hotel is let down by sub standard duty managers and argumentative  front of house staff I met on the 25th June ensuring I would never return. Be a little more tolerant of senior guests, a modicum of tolerance and respect goes a long way.

I was allocated room 625A a sky room. Avoid if you can as it overlooks neighbours balconies, living rooms and line washing. Excellent in most respects pity about a most arrogant duty manager",3,2022,06,29
49,Just fabulous,"I can‚Äôt really say much about the Seventy that hasn‚Äôt already been said! Staff are fabulous, patio room was fabulous, roof top pool was fabulous as was breakfast and the lovely outside terrace. It‚Äôs in a good location, 15 minutes from La Sagrada and minutes from designer shop heaven. You are a little further from the beach and port and La Rambla, but easily done in a taxi. We went to the zoo and both ways was less than ten euros. The bar was a lovely place to sit on an evening, with a great choice of drinks and not overly expensive for a city centre hotel. We didn‚Äôt get to the spa sadly but the roof top pool was a joy after days on your feet on the hop on hop off bus. I can‚Äôt really say enough good things and would happily recommend as your first choice hotel in Barcelona. Thank you to everyone for a great stay üòä",5,2022,06,23
49,"Gorgeous hotel, great service !","What a gorgeous hotel! We had a sky room and it was very comfortable. The spa is wonderful is wonderful, just make sure to pre-book a time. The rooftop is great, I especially loved that there is a side away from the pool that was quieter. But I cannot thank the staff enough for saving the trip for me. I realized after we left Barcelona that I forgot my eyeglasses and AirPod Pros in our room. I emailed the hotel and to be honest, I didn‚Äôt really expect them to have either, much less my AirPods. They had both and held them for me for a week until we came back through Barcelona on our way home! It was such a relief. Thank you!",5,2022,06,22
49,Beautiful hotel with some issues with things working,"The hotel itself is beautiful if you enjoy a modern, trendy feel. We had a first floor room with a terrace that was lovely to sit on when the sun wasn‚Äôt directly on it. What would‚Äôve made it better is if they had lounge chairs for the terrace; that would encourage you to really relax and enjoy that amenity.
The room itself was lovely, great bed and bathroom. Small, but big enough for 2. The problems started when there was no hotel safe. We went downstairs to tell the reception, and they were confused, understandably. They sent someone up promptly to repair it, only for the repairman to realize we meant there was no safe, period. Then someone came up and installed one, huzzah, but it took multiple entries of the password for it to open, for some reason. So the newly installed safe worked, mostly. 
Also, we couldn‚Äôt figure out the remote. Either we couldn‚Äôt figure it out, or it didn‚Äôt work properly, because anytime we tried navigating the hotel menu it wouldn‚Äôt do anything. We could watch tv, but that was about it. I kept wanting to check out the spa on the tv but could never figure out how to navigate to it and get it to load. We also didn‚Äôt go downstairs and ask reception about it though.
I‚Äôm sure reception would‚Äôve helped as they were very responsive, and our ordered taxi came promptly on time.
Location is perfect and was a 10-15 minute walk to Sagrada Familia, Casa Mills and Casa Battlo. The Eixample neighborhood is charming and imminently walkable, and while it doesn‚Äôt have the narrow, twisty streets of the Barrio Gotic neighborhood that people think of when they think of a European city, it also has a lot less souvenir shops around too.",4,2022,06,16
49,"The best place to stay in a quiet, local neighborhood!","Our stay at the Seventy was fantastic! Beautiful hotel tucked away in the quiet Gracia neighborhood, about 10 min drive/30 min walk to the Gothic Quarter. In terms of amenities, we loved the relaxing rooftop pool for sun & a dip after exploring the city and trendy lobby bar for a pre-dinner drink (the free welcome drinks at the lobby bar were a nice touch!). The rooms are clean and look brand new with a comfy bed, blackout curtains, Bluetooth speakers in the ceiling, A/C and a nice size bathroom/shower area. Friendly and helpful staff. Highly recommend!",5,2022,06,16
49,Loved it!!,"This was the best hotel I have ever stayed in. Staff are very friendly and there is so much to do. We had the spa included and it really made our experience more relaxing. It is in the centre of everything so not much walking to get to places. 

Very clean and well organised. Beds were super comfy! 

Thankyou for having us. Defo would recommend!!",5,2022,06,12
49,Great experience,"We were back in Barcelona and wanted to try a different hotel this time, and glad we did.   Beds were comfortable, rooms were very quiet, rooftop area was very nice, the location was very convenient to local coffee shops, small supermarcets, restaurants and shopping and central to the big Barcelona attractions.  The blackout automated roller shades are the bomb...especially as you realize you will probably be out to 1am every night and sleeping until 10am each morning.  Just a well designed property.  Two other things of note I want to mention is I found the restaurant staff extremely friendly, accommodating, and just really top flight so congrats to Montse (manager) and her team for being so good at what you do.   The other treat is the housekeeping person for our floor, Reuben, was so joyful and friendly...we were sad on the days when we didn't see him.   Would absolutely recommend for a family stay or couples",5,2022,06,12
49,Lovely calm stay,"We had a most delightful stay at Seventy Barcelona. Thank you so much. Your staff were also gracious and excellent, I recall Roberta in particular. Breakfast was delicious, room was beautiful, and our view on the banana tree courtyard felt like being in a mini country home. We will definitely return! Warmest regards and thank you!",5,2022,06,11
49,Stylishly Chic and Comfortable,"Of the several hotels in Barcelona we've stayed at, this is by far our favorite. The lobby and public spaces are comforably elegant and lovely. The rooms are immculate, comfortable, bright, and modern with all the amenities you could need. The location is ideal for any vistor to the city, just steps from the trendy Passeig de Gracia and surrounded by boutiques, restaurants, bars, cafes, and everyday Barcelona life. It's both touristy and local all at the same time. Highly recommended.",5,2022,06,07
49,"Enjoyable stay. Clean, neat and good service","Very good hotel with fantastic interior design. Stayed there for 5 nights and it was perfect. Room was big and very very quiet, we were greeted with a bottle of sparkling wine which was nice. Staff was very helpful. Breakfast was good and the breakfast area is super. I did find the selection on the buffet to be a bit strange, but thats just me. 

Overall a fantastic hotel that I would highly recommend.",5,2022,06,06
49,Best hotel,I've been here for 3 days with my son and have to say that  this hotel has  the nicest  staff  ever. Location  is perfect  the  rooms incredible and the restaurant the staff recommended where absalutely amazing,5,2022,06,03
49,The described service does not exist and the staff is friendly but has no clue,"We are in this hotel today and checked in and booked the Duplex Suite there. The room itself is nice and spacious and clean, unfortunately the rest is not as expected. The staff is friendly but unfortunately one doesn't know what the other is doing and the service described for this suite doesn't exist either. If you ask the reception, no one knows the answer.

1. The welcome cocktail described does not exist and was neither offered nor mentioned in any other way.
2. luggage service does not exist either the luggage was stored but please do the rest on yourself. It was not even asked if you could bring it to the room.
3. afternoon in room cocktail as described online is not known at the reception.
4. when you ask for the minibar price list, they tell you it's on the TV. We told them that the TV was not working. A technician came immediately who knew the problem and said it was known and was due to the Software not working and the price list could not be called up. There is no more help, so you are as smart as before.",2,2022,06,02
49,One of the best Old Fashions I have had!,This is a beautiful hotel in a great area of the city where you can easily walk to most of the major attractions and great restaurants.  They have a wonderful bar and our Bartender Aurelian made us some of the best Old Fashions I have ever tasted.  Great spot for a nightcap!,5,2022,06,01
49,Mixed feelings,"We have been to Barcelona numerous times. As the hotel seems pretty new, we booked ourselves here for a week stay. 

Pros:
- easy access to shops as it‚Äôs located at the top of the main shopping street. 
- relatively new hotel with nice decor.
- good size and well lit room.
- in room nespresso machine , free daily bottled water.

Cons:
- room facing the street has constant traffic in the day.
- hotel seems full this period hence breakfast time can be quite chaotic with really loud guests. 
- sub par service during breakfast. we were waved off abruptly and given a annoyed look by the lady who we thought was manning the entrance. and on day 6th of breakfast, we were shown a bill for an extra pax as they insisted that the reception had only registered 1 pax for our stay. and instead of sorting this out , we were told to approach the reception all whilst we were still having our breakfast.

Overall, the lacklustre service is a let down.",4,2022,06,01
49,"THE ONE WITH THE 3B GOOD, BEAUTIFUL AND CHEAP","A few days ago I left this hotel, which has a five-star service, it is very very clean, they take care of you in an incredible way, the facilities are very nice, the quality-price part is very well balanced, without a doubt I will come back to this beautiful place I would stay here, it is a place where you can relax and enjoy your vacation days without any problem, it has an incredible view, it is like paradise
Spain has many places to visit and this hotel is the best option to rest and relax for a while after traveling all over the place",5,2022,05,30
49,Great stay at Seventy!,"I stayed at Seventy last month with my wife & two children for a week and had a fantastic stay. Beautiful decor throughout. Rooms were spacious, very clean, with really comfortable beds. Breakfast had plenty of tasty choices. Rooftop pool was fun addition! Had a great massage at their spa. Staff were all lovely, special mention goes to Iraklis & Anna: Iraklis was a waiter we met during breakfast service, he was so attentive & friendly, always taking the time to chat with me & my family, he even arranged for a surprise treat to be delivered to our room (chocolates & cake!); Anna was on reception one morning when it was raining, she helped us plan a day out around the weather, her idea of a visit to the Science Museum was a huge success with all of us! Location of hotel is brilliant, walking distance to many attractions. I would highly recommend staying here & would stay here again if was to return to Barcelona.",5,2022,05,30
49,No negatives - a perfect city break!,"This is gorgeous hotel. We stayed in a Seventy House room for 4 nights. Everything is super modern from the rooms to the bar area and the beautiful rooftop pool and terrace. All of this meant we didn't really have a chance to miss a balcony.
In our room we were greeted with a complimentary gift bag containing hand cream and toothbrushes with toothpaste. This was super helpful as we had forgotten this! There is also complimentary water in the room every day.
The hotel is in a great location. We were able to walk to the main streets, La Ramblas, the seafront, Park Guell and the Sagrada Familia. We only used the metro to travel to the airport and to get back to the hotel after a full days walking! We chose not to get breakfast included with our room and this was not an issue as plenty of shops, bakeries and coffee shops are within a few blocks.
The staff were all very friendly and always willing to help with any queries. On our final day, after check out, we were not flying out until late. The staff organised pool access for us and we were booked in to use the showers in the spa before heading off!

For anyone with very sensitive skin - I would recommend bringing your own shower products/hand wash as I did have a breakout of eczema but this is by no way the hotel's fault and could have been caused by many other factors.

We would not hesitate to stay here again and had a lovely time in Barcelona!",5,2022,05,30
49,Wonderful stay in the heart of Barcelona,"Seventy Barcelona is a wonderful welcoming hotel in the heart of Barcelona. The staff from the doorman, the front desk, rooftop and cleaning staff were all so friendly during our stay.
Beautiful, quiet, spacious room with comfortable beds, controllable thermostat where we were able to keep our room cold for our stay, really needed after walking all over town. 
Plus the neighborhood has great restaurants, craft brewery and is only 2 blocks from the subway.
We loved our stay and would return again to Seventy Barcelona",5,2022,05,30
49,Great find in the city. Would say more like 5 star,Cannot rate this hotel highly enough. Seamless check in. We had booked room with balcony which was lovely however it would be great if they provided sun loungers rather than deck chairs. Roof top pool and bar is fantastic.  Not that many sun loungers so not sure what it would be like in peak season but we did not have an issue. Staff at breakfast and in bar very efficient and helpful. Will definitely be back,5,2022,05,28
49,Wow.,"From the minute I walked in the front doors I could tell this hotel was going to be incredible. Absolutely cannot recommend it enough! The design is stunning, the rooms are gorgeous and the service is fantastic. Really don‚Äôt have enough good things to say about it. Stay here.",5,2022,05,23
49,Great hotel and staff!,The vibe here is awesome and the staff went out of their way to be sure everything was perfect.  Our waitress Lorena at the restaurant was a particular standout! Looking forward to coming back again someday.,5,2022,05,22
49,lovely staff,Lovely staff at this hotel! extremely helpful and kind :) (Lorena helped us with everything we needed to know) will definitely be returning to stay here. Even though we had some trouble with the airconditioning at first they helped us right away! the rooms are also beautiful! make sure to check out the pool when you‚Äôre here,5,2022,05,22
49,The best hotel to welcome me back post-Covid!,"I haven't been abroad since 2019, so I was very much looking forward to a short city break with my friend in Barcelona earlier in May.
I'd read the reviews for Seventy and was excited to arrive. I have to say I was not disappointed once - I'd go so far as to say this is one of the best hotels I've stayed in, and even better that it was of a reasonable price! 
The design is chic, staff were always very friendly, and the extra touches were fantastic. We'd booked a spa stay which came with a welcome bottle of Cava (delivered shortly after we'd checked in). It was also my friend's birthday on the second day of our stay, which I'd mentioned when booking - and to our delight, there was another bottle of Cava when we came back to the hotel after a day of exploring. 
Not only that, but we enjoyed a glass of cava each at breakfast (spurred on by some Americans that started the cava-at-breakfast trend) and when I mentioned it was my friend's birthday, the waitress came back 5 minutes later with a slice of cheesecake with a candle in it. The fact it was a ""5"" candle just made it all the better as it gave us a laugh. 

Our spa package came with a 30-min treatment each as well as access to the spa itself, which was a lovely space. 

Overall I'd 100% recommend to anyone wanting a chic, friendly and good-value hotel stay in Barcelona. If I were to return to the city I'd absolutely make sure it was Seventy I was staying at!",5,2022,05,21
49,LOVED THIS HOTEL,"Seventy Barcelona is a wonderful hotel.  Beautifully appointed, the hotel is just off the Passeig de Gracia and minutes from Casa Mila and Casa Battlo.  Some of the best restaurants are also short walk away.  (La Pepita is across the street)  We had a Sky Room.  Nice and quiet.  The only negative is that operating the room lights is a bit of a challenge and they don't tell you to put a key card into the slot by the door to turn everything on.  Regardless, would definitely stay here again!",5,2022,05,20
49,Faultless stay,"My wife and I stayed at Seventy on a short honeymoon to Barcelona and like all the other reviews, we couldn‚Äôt fault it.  The hotel (which opened in 2019) is really well located - a few minutes from Diagonal Metro station - and walking distance from big attractions like La Pedrera and the Sagrada Familia.  Our room (a first floor lounge terrace with its own huge patio) was of the highest quality, with a massive comfortable bed, separate shower and sink areas meaning we could each freshen up without holding up the other, lovely furnishings and stylish d√©cor.  The daily cleaning service was also great, with water given to us every day.

We loved the seventh floor roof terrace with its own pool (although there are a limited number of loungers so be prepared to wait if you want a poolside seat), and had a lovely massage in the basement spa which also had its own luxurious pool with various water jets plus a sauna, steam and ice room.

At the time we booked directly through the Seventy website, breakfast came included with the room ‚Äì and it was a fantastic hotel breakfast, with a wide variety of high-quality products (special mention for the local-style doughnuts!) and plenty of seating inside and outside in the pretty courtyard.  All the communal areas are immaculately maintained and clearly designed to be Instagrammable ‚Äì the lobby alone is a work of art.

Finally, the staff were great, answered any questions we had, gave us a complimentary drink on arrival and left a bottle of Cava in our room to mark our recent wedding.  They didn‚Äôt have to do this, but the fact they did shows the care the management have for guests.

Seventy is already rated the second best hotel in Barcelona on TripAdvisor ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll be long before it‚Äôs number one.",5,2022,05,18
49,Excellent hotel,"Wonderful situation in city and close to metro station
Public areas well designed and maintained
Rooms are great and a decent size
Bed comfortable with decent pillows. Quite quiet considering in town 
Breakfast was very good with a nice choice
Would highly recommend",5,2022,05,17
49,Fantastic hotel,"Recently stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and were so impressed with this wonderful stylish hotel.  All the public rooms have been decorated beautifully and our room, although it was the most basic one they do, was also really nicely decorated with quality linens and beds.  There is also a roof top swimming pool and a  fantastic roof terrace, with large comfortable sun loungers - which is the perfect place to relax in the sun after a days sightseeing. It also has a spa but we didn't have time to try that.

The staff were really good and so friendly and helpful.  The hotel is well placed being only a short walk from the metro and from lots of the wonderful modernist Gaudi architecture, the Sagrada and the upmarket shopping district of passeig de gr√†cia.  

I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone and would definitely use it again if we returned to the wonderful city of Barcelona.",5,2022,05,15
49,Modern Sophisticated Design and Exceptional Service in the Heart of Barcelona!,"A five-star experience in a superb location in Barcelona. We thoroughly enjoyed four nights in this exceptional hotel.  Our room, one of the two duplex suites was a highlight among the hotels we stayed in during our trip through Spain.  A truly wonderful oasis to which we returned every evening.  What really sets the Seventy Barcelona apart, however, is the phenomenal service extended by every staff member, from reception, to the restaurant and bar, and the wonderful rooftop pool and bar area.  Absolutely every employee we encountered was cheerful, friendly and professional, and genuinely enthusiastic in their desire to be of service. Special kudos to Benjamin (and all of the men and women at the reception desk), Aurelio, and Fabio (pardon any misspellings).",5,2022,05,14
49,Comfy and in a great location,"The room was situated in a great location. Easy walking distance from most of the sights of Barcelona. The room was comfy, very quiet, and with block-out blinds. The staff were friendly and helpful. It's also across the road from a yummy churro store!
I love that most of the hotel is non-smoking.

Cons: the outdoor eating area did allow smoking; the restaurant didn't have many vegetarian/vegan options.

I was staying here accompanying my son who was in Barcelona on a soccer experience camp (he was staying at a nearby hotel - Casa Gracia). Hotel Seventy was in the perfect spot for that!",5,2022,05,10
49,A 5-Star Experience,"I had a great stay with my friends at the hotel; the staff was excellent and super helpful via email communication before arrival. The hotel was 20 mins ride from the airport with less traffic and a great location, close to the significant landmarks in Barcelona within a walkable distance.
The ambiance was a beauty on arrival, my favorite place was the breakfast area, and the colors and decor were a breath of life. The room was spotlessly clean, the internet connection was good, and the housekeeping was among the best I have witnessed in years of travel. If I could give the housekeeping a 101 score, I would. 
The beddings and pillows were as soft, and I had a good night's sleep.
The staff at reception were super friendly, kind, welcoming, and happy to help you with restaurant reservations and covid testing locations. Barcelona was amazing, and the Seventy Barcelona team made it even more awesome! 
It was a cute, almost 5-star experience, including the breakfast spread, fresh juicy food, fruits, and drinks. The spa, steam room, and pool were an excellent addition, and my friends and I are already planning a return trip.",5,2022,05,10
49,Super,"We liked it. The photo is true. Cool location. Very clean. Everything you need. Very convenient location, clean rooms with everything you need. The room had a large and comfortable bed + bath! Thank you, I was very pleased, I'll be back!",5,2022,05,10
49,very nice hotel,"this is a very good hotel but location not great because it s ca 15 minutes walk to the centre, but this is not a problem 
breakfast is in the courtyardm very quite 
there is a daily restaurant and evening bar what is also very good",5,2022,05,08
49,Amazing!,"We decided to spend our nights at Seventy during our stay I Barcelnoa and we are so happy we did.  The service was exceptional and so was the hotel/rooms.  The breakfast was over the top delicious with a great selection to chose from.  We were very pleased with the walking tour offered by the hotel as well.  I cannot say enough great things about this hotel and the staff.  It is perfection.

49,Lovely hotel in the heart of Barcelona,"Seventy Barcelona is a beautiful hotel situated conveniently within walking distance to major attractions like la Sagrada Familia, and plenty of shopping and dining options. Yet, it is on a fairly quiet street so you don't have to worry about noise. 

The decor of the hotel is lovely (as you can see from the photos, though it looks even better when you see it for yourself). The rooms are spacious, thoughtfully and artfully designed, and packed with any amenity you might need and want. The beds are very comfortable and you will certainly get a good night's sleep. 

The staff are generally responsive and helpful. We didn't have the time to try the restaurant, spa, or swimming pool, which is a pity. 

However, our otherwise wonderful stay ended on a not so bright note when we found out after a long day exploring Barcelona that there was no water supply that night (from 10pm till 5am). The disruption was apparently due to sudden water utilities works in the neighbourhood. We were unable to shower after a long day out, and the toilets could not be flushed. It was, to say the least, uncomfortable.

While we understood that the disruption was sudden and beyond the hotel's control, we think the hotel could have done better in communicating the impending disruption. We were told the management had left a notice at the lift lobbies in the afternoon once they were informed about the disruption, but it was either so inconspicuous that we did not notice it or it had been removed by the time we returned to the hotel. 

The hotel management could consider more effective communication methods, such as messaging or emailing guests (who might be out the whole day as we had been), so that they could promptly change their plans if necessary. I have also experienced other hotels leaving letters in each and every room to notify guests on impending disruptions, including more minor ones like fire alarm drills. 

Despite this unfortunate incident, we appreciated the efforts of the hotel staff to alleviate our discomfort, especially Christian (not sure if I spelt his name right) who was managing the reception at night. Christian very kindly even tried to book us in another hotel with running water (that didn't pan out, but the effort was much appreciated). 

All in all, Seventy Barcelona offers great value and has all the ingredients of a lovely stay (apart from our negative experience on the last night which was probably a very rare occurrence). We would consider staying at Seventy Barcelona again.",5,2022,05,04
49,BEAUTIFULL HOTEL !,"I have stayed at SEVENTY for a weekend in Barcelona and it was perfect ! 
The room are amazing and amenities are crazy ! I loved everything ! 
The whole hotel is very clean and the design is great. 
The food taste very good !
The location allows you to be very central in Barcelona. 
I recommand this place !!!",5,2022,04,26
49,All rounder of a hotel ,"We travel a lot... and this Hotel ticks all the boxes for us. Crisp, clean, lovely staff, very professional, modern  boutique. We loved it.  Only fault, if I had to say was the location of the bar fir food and drinks was directly across from the main entrance and it was really cold when we were there so, this cold each time the automatic doors opened was a little frustrating.  Otherwise absolutely loved it, too cold and wet  for roof pool at ours visit, but indoor pool was great..... loved our room.  ",5,2022,04,25
49,Hotel in April,"Excellent hotel with good taste and contemporary look. It is well located near the major activities.
We got an excellent rate at this hotel with advance booking. The breakfast has good and fresh food. We enjoyed the setting much. Most importantly, the hotel staff are extremely friendly with good eye contacts. They remember our names quickly.",5,2022,04,25
49,Perfect Choice!,"Seldom are my expectations exceeded having traveled for decades; however, this hotel provided us with a four-day stay that went beyond what was hoped for in every way!  The property itself is wonderfully-designed with a hip nautical decor that is ultra-modern, functional, yet warmly welcoming and located in a fine spot for tourists or business.  The staff is extremely friendly, efficient, helpful, and happy to serve--a rare find.  The rooms are large, well laid out, with cutting-edge technolory & lighting, plus very comfy beds, push-button black out curtains,  and new TVs with lots of channels. Our also had a huge private patio that would have been great for happy hour, had the bar downstairs not been so fantastic with great drinks and a cool vibe.  There' was also a rooftop pool and bar that would have been inviting with warmer weather and lots of wired working or sitting areas in the lobby.  All of which is to say, we found Seventy to be the perfect choice for Barcelona.",5,2022,04,15
49,I‚Äôd definitely stay in the hotel again - stylish modern interiors and nothing to fault - well worth it,"What a great hotel! Lovely service, good sized rooms and excellent facilities. It‚Äôs got a rooftop pool -  ideal for taking in the sunsets. The food is really nice also - not too expensive and fabulous quality. The breakfast buffet is amazing with just about everything you would like. 
Anna and the team at reception really went out of their way to help us - especially with restaurant recommendations locally and even booking some tours for us. 
The spa is great but please note that for a family you have to be over 16 to use it. Nice indoor pool, gym, sauna and steam room. And an ice bath for the braver ones. 
The location is good - not too far from the famous Gaudi church and just a short stroll from the Metro station.
I‚Äôd highly recommend the tapas place opposite - Pipeta - you may need to queue but it‚Äôs worth it. 
I‚Äôd definitely stay in the hotel again - stylish modern interiors and nothing to fault - well worth it",5,2022,04,15
49,"Great place to stay in Barcelona,","We found this hotel was exactly as advertised. It's an affordable hotel with excellent staff and very clean rooms. During our stay they were very helpful in directing me to a barber and couple great restaurants. Unfortunately it was raining, but the pool area looked delightful. The hotel is in an excellent location I would definitely stay here again",5,2022,04,13
49,Nice hotel for exploring Barcelona,"The hotel is beautiful. Rooms are quiet, beds are comfortable and the decor is amazing. We stayed with a group of friends and had some issues with shower but the hotel manager Mr.Victor Fontecha addressed that professionally. Still I would like to mention that the hotel should inform their guests if they place them in specially equipped rooms for handicapped people during reservation process or at least at check-in. These rooms have different shower system than other rooms. If you are lucky in life and do not need specially equipped room just ask for the regular one and enjoy a decent shower. 
At the end I must say that Seventy Barcelona is a good choice for a luxurious stay with a walkable distance to all major attractions in Barcelona. ",4,2022,04,12
49,Amazing Stay!!,"Just returned from Spain and what an amazing stay at Seventy Barcelona!! From the moment you walk in you can feel the warmth and vibrancy of this small boutique hotel!  What I enjoy  most about the hotel: 1) Staff: Wow, love these guys as we were greeted each time we arrived or left the hotel, 2) Security: you need a key to access the elevator, 3) Sound proofing: you don't hear anything so you sleep comfortably, 4) Cleanliness/Lighting: the hotel is very clean and very well lit so you feel the warmth, 5) Location: You are not far from Sagrada Familia, Subway and all the major shopping!

Overall what a great hotel for anyone looking to stay in Barcelona!",5,2022,04,10
49,ideal modern hotel in barcelona,"enjoyed a great stay at seventy this month - first impressions when walking into the hotel are incredible - magnificent reception, lobby and open restaurant bar area - was something to behold

Great location can walk to beautiful squares in gracia and even to the beach if up for it",5,2022,04,09
49,It's now a 3 way tie!,"Prior to our recent Barcelona trip, our favorite hotels have been The Residence, Johannesburg, and The Artemide in Rome.  Seventy Barcelona now joins them.  Our room was beautiful, bright, inviting, well designed and appointed.  The staff was just plain amazing.  They were helpful and friendly.  The breakfasts were bacchanalian--anything imaginable was available.  The location was perfect for us and convenient to the subway and near the prime shopping street.  We walked almost everywhere.  We stayed 10 nights, our longest stay anywhere, that I can recall, and I cannot think of a single negative!",5,2022,04,07
49,Exceptional Hotel,"First time to this city and I'm glad to have picked Seventy Barcelona as my home away from home for three nights. Conveniently located near Passeig de Gracia and walkable to main attractions, it has an underground carpark connected directly to the hotel lobby. Upon entering, we were wowed by the stylish contemporary decor and high ceilings. Staff were welcoming and helpful. I had made separate bookings but reception was kind enough to arrange for us the same room without the hassle of checking out and in again during our stay. Even upgraded us to the 5th floor overlooking the street! Room was equally beautiful, comfortable, good sized and filled with natural light. The rooftop pool with lounge is also a great place to chill. All in all would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking to give themselves a treat!",5,2022,04,06
49,Fantastic modern hotel well located in Barcelona,"Fantastic modern hotel in Barcelona 

We had a patio room for the four nights of our stay which overlooked the rear of the hotel.

Very quiet throughout the stay.

The rooms are ample size and very well decorated and everything available that you‚Äôll need from a hotel stay including plenty of storage.

Super king bed, 70 inch tv although only BBC world news available in English.

Bluetooth music system with speakers built into the ceiling 

The bathroom with Shower and bath is perfect and a toilet that will jet wash your anus should you desire it üòú.

The bar and restaurant provide a good variety of food and drink which is also reasonably priced for a hotel in the city.

We didn‚Äôt opt for breakfast here as this didn‚Äôt seem such good value at 16 euro per person especially when you‚Äôre surrounded by coffee and focaccia shops where you both can eat for a lot less.

The staff are all very friendly and helpful and I would have no hesitation in returning here for another stay.",5,2022,04,02
49,"Great service, location and value for this high quality hotel.","We had a fantastic stay at this beautiful hotel.  The pictures we saw on the website did not do it justice. 

First of all, Didac was incredibly helpful. Very patient and went out of his way to help us make arrangements to see La Sagrada Familia and Parc Guell.  

The room we had included a patio terrace which was nice but we honestly didn‚Äôt use it. The bed was very comfortable, the tv and wifi were both great.  The bathroom was nice.  

We enjoyed our stay so much we canceled our hotel near the airport for our last evening in Barcelona and extended out stay an extra night. 

The location was very convenient for us. Close to shopping, main sites and the Diagonal metro stop.  

Great value for excellent service and a great room at a very nice hotel.  

I hope we will be back and will definitely stay here again.",5,2022,04,01
49,Long Weekend City Break,"Cannot recommend this Hotel highly enough. Beautifully contemporary, light, airy and sharp!
The room (Patio room) was superb. 
Spa is gorgeous, gym is perfect for keeping up on your fitness whilst indulging on a trip.
Girlfriend had a massage which was great by all accounts.
Bar is great with pretty much anything you can think of available. (great cocktails)
The food is superb too!
The staff are friendly, attentive, and personable, particularly around the bar and restaurant.
Particular mentions for the two night bar guys whilst we were there, and Hercules in the bar and restaurant daytimes. (great recommendations in the restaurant and for Wine!
It's in a really handy place if you don't mind walking. Nice 15 -30 mins stroll down to the Port and the La Rambla area through the Gothic Quarter. Just round the corner from Casa Mila, 15 mins from La Sagrada Familia, 30 min to Park Guell.
All in all, a great hotel, an a great City!
Will be back for sure!

49,Excellent in every way,We stayed for 3 nights at seventy.  Staff were brilliant right from the first interaction at reception.  Room was smart and spotless.  Food delicious - great breakfast is worth paying for.  Lovely peaceful terrace.  Gym and spa need to be booked in advance,5,2022,03,27
49,Love this hotel!,"Without a doubt the quietest hotel i've ever stayed in, i've stayed in hotels that were in the county and were not as quiet as this place, i've even stayed in hotels on floors over 50 floors above the street that weren't as quiet as this place.
Service was exemplary in every area, check in was a breeze and the front of house folks were incredible. My room was on the 4th floor and was very beautiful with 2 single beds, a desk and chair, huge LED TV, awesome lighting, electric shades, marble shower stall and fluffy soft white towels.
Bed was comfortable although i did feel like i was rolling off, maybe everyone sleeps on the same side as me, linens were clean and pillows were perfect.
Can't remember a hotel where i never heard another guest in the room next to me, above me or below me, if i hadn't have seen the lady in the room next to me checking out i would have thought i had the entire floor to myself, the sound proofing is outstanding so you get a really decent nights sleep.
Breakfast was amazing too, fresh pastries, great coffee, omelets and eggs made to order, fresh fruit, cheese, cold meats, the list is endless, well worth the additional money.
Bar area was bright and modern and again, great staff in both bar and dining area.
I would absolutely stay here again.",5,2022,03,15
49,Do not miss this jewel in the heart of Barcelona!,"I rarely take the time to write reviews. Things are different for Seventy Barcelona. I have been travelling to Barcelona since many years, but I now finally know the place i would want to come back to over and over again. 

Right next to Passeig de Gracia, in a pretty regular street, you will find in Seventy an oasis of beauty, comfort, friendliness and a home-like feeling. 
Upon entering, you will find yourself in a beautifully decorated, bright, cosy lobby filled with plants, wooden furniture, relaxing seats and little corners to work, have a drink or just relax. The design is absolutely well thought and superb. Incredibly friendly staff to instantly make you feel at home.  

Same goes for the rooms: beautifully decorated, every detail has been thought of. Different light switches, plug ins for your electronics, clean, cosy. 

The breakfast and restaurant menu are a treat. Deliciously healthy food prepared by cooks. Very complete buffets. 
Don't miss the bar to spend the evening (no need to go out even!)

Additionally, you can relax in the wonderful spa with sauna and pool during the day or evening.

I would like to thank the entire staff for their excellent service and smiles. 
This hotel is not just a hotel, it is an experience!
Please don't miss out on it on your next trip to Barcelona.",5,2022,03,12
49,Amazing in every way!,"Seventy Barcelona is hands down the best hotel we‚Äôve ever stayed in! We spent six nights there, and by that time I‚Äôm usually ready to leave. Well, I could have stayed for a month! It truly is like a home away from home. The entire staff is so friendly and helpful, the lobby, common areas and bar are gorgeous and the rooms are spacious and have everything you need. We had a first floor room with a terrace which was lovely. The hotel is immaculate, I‚Äôve really never seen another hotel so clean. It's in the perfect location and you can walk everywhere. I booked this hotel based on reviews and it exceeded my highest expectations!",5,2022,03,07
49,10/10,An amazing hotel with fabulous facilities. The staff were very welcoming and helpful when needed. The rooms were spotlessly clean and the bar serves some lovely sangria. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone coming to stay in Barcelona.,5,2022,02,26
49,Great experience!,"It was my first time travelling in a long time and I'm so glad I chose the hotel seventy. Beautiful rooms, great breakfast and bar, and incredibly kind and accommodating staff. I'm definitely coming back!",5,2022,02,26
49,A little overrated,"Stayed one night in a 'Sky Room'. Disappointed not to get a street view as the courtyard view is not the best, but the hotel was completely full so no chance to change. The room, while beautiful, was extremely warm and somebody needed to come to show me how to turn off the heat. Shouldn't really be that complicated and apparently I wasn't the first to ask. They said they could also open the windows for me, but somebody would also need to come to the room to do that (!!??!!) If the windows do in fact open, why do they have to be locked? 
The room itself was beautiful, a very comfy bed, high quality finishes and felt more 5 star than 4 star. Breakfast was also excellent. The location is very good, on the corner of Garcia and L'eixample districts and a few minutes from the metro. Staff were friendly and welcoming. Very reasonable price for a very good hotel, just not quite sure why it is so highly ranked on Tripadvisor. ",4,2022,02,23
49,Best hotel in Barcelona. Will be staying here again!,"We stayed here for five nights in February 2022, and loved our stay.

The hotel itself is stunning; as soon as you walk in you can feel the quality throughout.

The staff are friendly, attentive and very helpful.

As hotel guests, we had access to the spa (indoor pool, sauna and steam room), which was lovely.

We also booked a massage, which was very good.

It's in a good location, within a walkable distance to many sights, restaurants and coffee shops.

We will stay here the next time we visit Barcelona!",5,2022,02,21
49,Seventy Stars,"Seventy stars if we could!  Excellent decor, wonderful ambiance, very comfortable rooms and the service by the staff (especially Anna at breakfast) was exceptional.  It is very well located too.  This was the first visit to Barcelona for some of us and we will definitely be back.",5,2022,02,21
49,Style over substance?,"This hotel is deeply in love with itself, and to be fair it does have some beautiful parts, like the outdoor seating area, shaded by mature olive trees with the noise of a burbling fountain. There's a pool on the roof, but it's tiny and wasn't available when we went to look. The rooms are not well designed. Firstly, there's a 70"" TV, which has an app called ""internet"" but can't access anything. Reception thought that maybe if your phone is a Samsung you might be able to cast to it, maybe. So unless you want to watch Spanish TV, news channels or see the mini bar price list in 70"" format, don't get too excited about the TV. There's a bath, although the design of the shower screen doesn't allow it to be cleaned (I gave up asking the hotel staff to clean it, and did it myself) (which required getting into the bath, so not surprising it was considered a big ask by the housekeeping team). The light switches are pretty complicated. I think we had it worked out by about day 4 (we both have degrees in electronic engineering, but still never quite knew whether a switch would flood the room with light, make a light flick on and immediately off, or what). There's a god blind and louvre shutters so you can keep the sunrise at bay if you want a lie-in, which is very nice. There are tea and coffee making facilities, but whether the supplies will be replenished, or with what, or at what time in the day, is anyone's guess. Might be 9am, might be 5pm - we experienced both, and the full range in terms of variety and quantity of milk pots and tea bags. In the end we bought our own from a supermarket. There's a little fridge with a strange little collection of mini bar drinks (not complementary, though they're mainly soft drinks) , though the main bar is great, so we didn't pay it much heed.

The bed is MASSIVE, the bedding etc nice, the desk staff all have great English, though some have been to Charm School for longer than others.

The location is pretty good, just a few steps away from the top of the main road with the big Gaudi attraction Casa Batllo, and all the designer shops. 

For the money, I think I would try somewhere else next time. There wasn't a lot about it to make me desperate to come back, and I would prefer not to have to help out with the daily cleaning at this price, really.",3,2022,02,19
49,An amazing stay - 5****,What an amazing hotel! We stayed here for three nights and couldn‚Äôt fault anything at all. The service was amazing and everyone so friendly. The staff gave us really good recommendations and the hotel itself is beautiful. Can‚Äôt wait to come back!,5,2022,02,07
49,Barcelona wedding,"We stayed at the Seventy for 5 nights in September while attending a family wedding 
There was a large party of guests attending the wedding -who had never met before 
I have to say it was one of the most memorable stays at a hotel we have ever had

Staff were absolutely fantastic 
I would certainly recommend this hotel to any one

49,Seventy Barcelona,This hotel was amazing! Great service from the moment I checked in. Mind you I had booked my stay for the following day and arrived the day prior not realizing  what I had done and they accommodated me immediately. The staff moved my reservation up a date and I was very pleased with their willingness to accommodate my mistake. Our bartender was great and the breakfast was delicious as well. Great location to walk to do shopping and site seeing. If ever in Barcelona I recommend staying here! You will not be disappointed!,5,2022,01,27

49,"NICE HOTEL, BUT...","Comfortable hotel with great public spaces and lovely staff¬†! Pleasant SPA accessible for 30 mn with prior booking. Nice massages sometimes quirky (my masseuse climbed on my massage bed to rub my shoulders...)
Our Patio room on the 5th floor was sunny, quiet and very spacious. However I do not recommend it to sensitive sleepers : even after all lights are turned off and shades are down, the room is not dark¬†: in the adjacent bathroom (which is separated only by opened slats that let all light in), the sinks are lit from below 24/24¬†; the Japanese toilet bowl itself has an inner light! It is quite annoying if you need a reasonable amount of darkness to sleep. 
Reception did provide a drastic solution: just¬† take the magnetic card/key out, and this will turn off all electricity! 
Unfortunately this also turns off heating or a/c...
May-be eyemasks should be provided for Patio rooms¬†?
Before I left, I asked to be shown other rooms and found out that House (#322) and Seventy type rooms (#412) have a better outlay and a totally separate bathroom.¬†
Another annoying feature is that all windows are locked and handles removed which is really unusual for Barcelona: it would be great to be able to aerate rooms especially in these pandemic times.
Public spaces are stylish and varied. Restaurant is very, very spacious, and has a gorgeous open kitchen. However the menu is limited and cafeteria like. 
The best part of this hotel is the attentive and courteous staff.",4,2022,01,07
49,Beautiful Hotel with Amazing Employees,"My husband and I truly enjoyed our stay at Seventy Barcelona. The hotel is stunning and everyone, the two Anas at check in, the doorman, the restaurant staff were all very welcoming and always made us feel at home. There are not enough words to describe  the beauty of this hotel, the lobby should be featured on the cover of Architectural Digest magazine. The room was very spacious and the bed and pillows were extremely comfortable. The hotel is located in a neighborhood that is close to restaurants, stores, and tourist attractions. We were able to walk to the majority of the popular tourist attractions from the hotel. I was very sad when I left Spain but I know for sure that I will be back and will be staying at the Seventy Barcelona. I have already recommended the hotel to relatives that intend to visit later this year. Thank you Seventy Barcelona for making our stay in Spain truly enjoyable.",5,2022,01,05

49,Great first impression of Spain,"Landed in Spain and checked into an amazing and spacious room at Seventy Barcelona and I couldn‚Äôt have been happier. Beautiful interior design throughout the hotel and inside the room. Breakfast is simple but serves the purpose especially on days where I had to leave for an early tour/train ride. Hotel staff have been very attentive and helpful. Be sure to also check out the spa, which I really enjoyed after hiking all day at Montserrat. All in all, Seventy Barcelona was a great start to my Spain trip!",5,2021,12,13

49,Mixed Thoughts,"There were pros and cons to our stay at Seventy 

Overall, the hotel is quite stylish and well decorated. There were a lot of public spaces where you could sit, and the hotel has already been decorated for Christmas which looked quite nice. 

COVID prevention procedures were being followed throughout the hotel. Staff were all wearing masks, we had to show our vaccination certificate at check in, and hand sanitiser was available around the hotel. On check in staff were friendly, but no one spoke to us much for the other days of our stay.  We had mentioned prior to check in that our visit was for a special occasion and nothing was mentioned by staff throughout our trip- normally a hotel of this level would offer at least a congratulations or similar.  We did have an issue with our hotel room door (it wouldn't lock) and the repair service arrived promptly and repaired the problem quickly, which was much appreciated. 

The room itself was nice decorated and quite spacious. The bed and TV were huge and the bed was very comfortable, the bathroom had dual sinks and a lot of counter space which was nice. Black out curtains were fitted (and operated by a switch next to the bed) but there are a number of charging plugs in the room which illuminate throughout the night and we couldn't find anyway to turn them off which could disturb those who need a dark room to sleep. There are USB charging ports in the room but it is important to note they are USB-A, not USB-C (not a problem, but useful to know). The room also offers wired in Bluetooth speakers however the instructions referred to a remote we couldn't locate in the room so we weren't able to make use of this facility. 

In the bathroom the combined bath/shower felt a bit small and the hand held shower hose gets under foot while you shower which can be hazardous. The overhead shower can be adjusted but ours seemed to be leaking quite a bit while on and didn't distribute evenly on most settings. The plug for the bath is also easy to step on while showering which means water pools and, once the plug is opened, it drained slowly. Bath robes aren‚Äôt offered as standard in most of the rooms though oddly slippers are. 

There was no room service. Despite it being mentioned at check in and promoted on the in room info when we called to place an order we were told we could only order food in the bar or restaurant. 

Beyond the room service other in room information was out of date. The information provided via the TV gave incorrect breakfast times and promoted a cocktail menu that, when we went to the bar, wasn't available. The bar itself actually offered a much more limited menu which was disappointing 

The buffet breakfast did have quite a few options but wasn't anything different from similar level hotels so while it was enjoyed, it wasn't memorable for a hotel marketed at this level.

Spa is included in the room charge (times have to be pre-booked currently due to COVID) and there is a roof top space you can use. 

The hotel is located centrally in a nice neighbourhood and was near the metro meaning it was easy to get around either by foot or public transport. 

Overall, we were left a little underwhelmed. Much has been said on this site and others about how amazing this hotel is, but it felt like it underdelivered in our expectations. I can see the potential but there are improvements to be made to be considered an amazing hotel.",3,2021,11,30
49,"Perfect location, contemporary yet cozy !","Loved the hotel and the aesthetics of decoration 
It reminded me of the boutique hotels in the US in the early 2000s.  The lounge and lobby area has a contemporary look and feel and yet cozy.  The spa and gym is nice. It is not big but functions well and the staff helped booking with Covid regulations.  We had a room on the 4th floor with plenty of natural light and automated black out curtains shades and shutters.  Fluffy towels which I always love.  Can not wait to come back in summer to check out roof top pool which they told us would be expanded !",5,2021,11,30
49,Beautiful hotel and great location,"Walking distance to everything you need - La Rambla, nice restaurants, Parc Guell, etc. 

The hotel was beautiful and the bar and lounge area were something else. I'm not usually one for sitting around hotels but this one I made an exception and spent some time in the lounge/cocktail area. Very well done and presented. 

The spa wasn't massive but the terrace pool was sizeable and I can imagine it being a very cool place to be in the summer. 

The hotel is also very handy if you are going to Barcelona to shop as its placed right at the top of the main shopping street. 

Staff were all friendly, professional and accommodating.  I would go back to this hotel again, excellent value for money.",5,2021,11,29
49,STELLAR!!!  PERFECT!!!,"Everything was perfect, from the ease of storing our baggage for a few hours on our first day to the amazing anniversary dinner on our last. After countless hours exploring one of the most beautiful cities in the world it was nice to come back to a clean comfortable room. A special shout out to Alberto at the bar. BEST OLD FASHIONED.  Could not have asked for a better mixologist and his suggestions for local restaurants were spot on.  Have suggested to several friends to book SEVENTY BARCELONA. Location, professional staff and ambience all combined to make our visit more than we had hoped for.",5,2021,11,26
49,Special weekend,"We had a very special weekend in 70 Barcelona. We were celebrating a wedding anniversary and we‚Äôre surprised with champagne and beautiful chocolates on arrival in our room. The staff were professional, helpful and very pleasant. It‚Äôs a gorgeous modern hotel, full of interesting areas, a lovely relaxed atmosphere makes this a wonderful hotel to stay in.",5,2021,11,25
49,Perfect place to explore Barcelona,"The Seventy House was absolutely incredible. Gorgeous / comfortable rooms, beautiful design, good food and drinks. Alberto at the bar had great suggestions, and everyone at the reception was very helpful. Could not recommend more strongly.",5,2021,11,23
49,Modern hotel,"Our stay at Seventy Barcelona was great. The staff was very friendly and helpful, they go that little but further for their guests. The bar has a chilled ambient and the food is yummy. There was even live music on one of the evenings. One of the best hotels we've stayed in together.",5,2021,11,23
49,Lovely Hotel with Hampton vibes,"The Hotel is very lovely and stylish. The rooms are beautiful and the staff very nice and helpful. We felt a bit like in the Hamptons :D The Spa is also very nice and the we booked a massage which was great. The restaurant and bar are also good, the location just looks so nice and tge food was good and not expensive. Would always come back, can only recommand!",5,2021,11,21
49,"The Seventy in Barcelona: name that does not guide much, magnificent service and therefore destined a benchmark hotel","The Seventy Hotel in Barcelona in a few words: Name that does not guide much, the magnificent service and destined to be a benchmark in the hotel industry. I felt like I was in home, not to a hotel, the Seventy is the best option I could have chosen",5,2021,11,19
49,So pleased we chose this hotel!,"I have stayed in so many hotels over the years and there is always a little something (or big something) you'd want to change or improve. Seventy is the first hotel where I can genuinely say it was FAULTLESS. Hotel and spa is beautifully designed with great consideration, lovely, modern spacious rooms, everything is well maintained and new, staff were so helpful and accommodating. We didn't have to worry about a thing. Concierge gave us some excellent dinner recommendations and booked tables for us too, taking the pressure off us to know the best places to go.

I have never stayed at the same place twice but next time I am in Barcelona, I will be staying at Seventy.",5,2021,11,17
49,"Fabulous hotel, will be returning!","Really enjoyable stay at the Seventy in Barcelona. Check-in was quick and easy, we arrived just after 11am and the room was ready for us. The lobby is modern and stylish and reception staff were friendly and helpful.
 
The room was a good size, bed was amazingly comfortable. The shutters and blackout blinds were a nice feature. One downside is that the windows don't open but there is air-conditioning if it's too hot. The safe was large enough to fit a laptop in with ease. The wardrobe had proper hangers, ironing board and iron. A hair straightener and hair dryer are available in the room too. There are speakers in the room and bathroom that connect to your phone via Bluetooth, another nice feature. The bathroom had a lovely pack with creams, toothbrushes, toothpaste, tissues. 

The room, bathroom and hotel in general was super clean, hand sanitiser available throughout the hotel.

I liked the modern decor throughout the room and hotel. The corridors appeared to be soundproofed too and we did not hear suitcases rolling/people in nearby rooms. 

Our room was on the second floor, facing out to the street. On Friday night we could hear the bar across the road but nothing that would majorly impact sleeping. 

We used the spa daily; due to covid-19 it had to be booked in advance but there were lots of slots available, no issues with this. There was a pool, sauna and steam room. Gym also available but we didn't use it, again needed to be booked in advance. 

Overall, this hotel exceeded all expectations and we will absolutely be returning.",5,2021,11,13
49,"Good Addition, great location","Really marked this on the excellent fit out and location. Nipped in and out of Barcelona over the week, experienced 3 rooms.  Would say this is a place which is trying really hard - a tad not so well on the front desk but charming none the less, just not as slick as the furnishings. But well meaning. Great beds, lovely sheets, nice breakfast",4,2021,11,13
49,Great stay. Friendly staff and beautiful hotel,"Stayed at Seventy for 4 nights in August 2021. Couldn't have had a better stay. The staff were friendly and incredibly helpful, especially during covid-19 when we needed to find a local test centre. The pool, although small, is perfect to chill out after a day of walking around a hot Barcelona. The location is great, close to Diagonal metro station and within walking distance of Sagrada Familia.",5,2021,11,11
49,"Great staff, great location","This is a true gem. The staff were incredibly helpful, and took great care to make sure we had a great stay. Reception staff, restaurant staff, breakfast cooks. All sincerely devoted to making us feel welcome.

The Sky room on the top floor was perfect. Comfy king size bed, a proper safe that would fit laptops, Real clothes hangers in the closet (not those annoying ones some hotels use in fear of the guests stealing them), coffee maker, fridge filled with (non-alcoholic) beverages.

The breakfast is your typical western/mediterranian buffet with bacon, omelett, hams and cheeses, all sorts of bread etc etc.

The building is quite new, with very modern interior decoration that is weird in a nice way, and feels very welcoming.

The location is perfect, in a cozy neighbourhood with lots of small restaurants and cafes, but still near the touristy areas with a few minutes walk.",5,2021,11,09
49,"Amazing experience, amazing people, amazing place","Our stay at seventy was absolutely perfect, from the hip spaces to the cleanliness to the professional, accommodating and personable staff! The hotel amenities were also amazing, from the beautiful back terrace, to the rooftop pool to the serene spa & gym, where the staff is absolutely outstanding.
We chose seventy as our group hotel for our wedding and their care to each room made each guest rave about the experience. We definitely made the right choice and will certainly be back! Thank you Seventy staff for being part of making our wedding experience perfect.",5,2021,11,08
49,Comfortable stay with excellent house staff,"Just back from seven wonderful days in Hotel Seventy. The experience was all the more enjoyable because of the excellent expertise of Aurelian, the patient barman. All staff have to be commended on their helpfulness and friendliness.",5,2021,11,05
49,"Modern Hotel, Friendly Staff, Lovely Neighborhood","This was truly one of the nicer hotels I stayed in in Europe. It has a modern but welcoming vibe, and decor that makes it feel like a retreat within the city. My room was far more spacious than a traditional European hotel room. Breakfast was lovely on the outdoor patio. The staff was very helpful to me as a solo traveler, providing tips and directions. The hotel felt clean and safe with masks required in common spaces and hand sanitizer readily available. Loved the Gracia/Eixample location that felt a bit less touristy than other parts of Barcelona, but with convenient access to a couple of metro lines. I look forward to returning!",5,2021,11,03

Well located at 1km from the famous Sagrada Familia",5,2021,11,01
49,"Great hotel, perfect base for exploring Barcelona","Immaculately clean, very tastefully decorated this hotel gets it right. Rooms are well thought out with near silent but highly effective air conditioning. Automatic black out blinds and soundproofing helps for a great nights sleep. Lovely rooftop area for sunbathing or swimming (bit chilly in the pool end of October!). Lovely spa and gym too. Really enjoyed our stay",5,2021,10,29
49,Top Hotel,"Newly built hotel in Gracia, witin five minutes walking distance to Casa Mil√†.
Very imaginative modern decoration ‚Äì congratulations to the designer.
Our Lounge terrace room was large, with quality furniture, including a very comfortable super king bed and a very modern bathroom. The secluded terrace was overlooking a huge, quiet courtyard.
The breakfast was excellent, with a good range of quality products. The only things missing were some tomatoes and peppers.
The service was prompt, friendly and professional.
I have a special commendation for the young smiling lady at the reception, who noticed that my birthday had been the week before, and took my attempt of a joke seriously, and organised a well-received gift - a bottle of Cava in a cooler and a kind birthday note. I am very sorry I did not ask her name, but the entire team was ‚Äúamazing‚Äù, to quote her.
We will definitely stay at this hotel next time we visit Barcelona.",5,2021,10,29

49,Excellent,"Just back from a long weekend with my wife. We found the hotel had everything we required and everything was done to a high standard. The decor, food (breakfast - didn‚Äôt have lunch or dinner), location and room were all 5 star. The gym, Spa and rooftop pool were all added bonuses. Special mention for all the staff whom we found friendly, professional, experienced and knowledgeable. We will return.",5,2021,10,20
49,Should be a 5 star property,"Catalonia has a rating system for hotels that puts Seventy at 4 stars. There are minimums for the size of the rooms and bathrooms, which I assume Seventy meets to be a 5 star establishment. Supposedly, the difference is in the ‚Äúlittle things.‚Äù  

I think they got those right too. The doors swing open silently and automatically to invite guests into the open and airy library that is the reception area.  The staff at the reception desk were inviting and helpful. We checked in without a problem and went to our room. 

The room was modernist in black and white. Nice touches included blackout curtains, sheets to cover the headboard of the bed and a sound system in the ceiling. The bed was among the most comfortable we‚Äôve had in a hotel room.  The shower and bidet are great. The sink was a little crowded, but our room made up for any lost space with a wonderful deck which could‚Äôve been used to entertain.",5,2021,10,13
49,Wonderful modern hotel,"Modern, stylish hotel. Well appointed rooms with very comfy bed. We loved the art and decor throughout. The staff were friendly and ever so helpful.

49,Fab hotel and a relaxed place to stay.,"Wow we loved this hotel. We came here as a couple for my 50th birthday. Everything is still new as only opened just before lockdown. We had a sky room with the most comfortable bed ever. The room was so well designed from the decor to where the plug sockets were. The staff were so friendly and helpful. You can use the pool anytime and the spa faculties for half an hour a day and the gym 1 hour a day. The breakfast is buffet style, varied and really fresh. They have a fab bar with lovely bar staff and a fab terrace. We would love to go back. Thank you to the lovely barman who treated us to champagne and was so lovely to talk to. Thank you so much.",5,2021,09,26
49,New Hotel with Talented Staff!,"The new Seventy was open for less than a year before Covid caused a temporary closure. The guest rooms and common areas are visually stunning and up to date with USB ports and giant televisions.  The upstairs pool deck is awesome as is the downstairs outdoor dining area.  The front desk, housekeeping, bar and dining staff are multi-lingual and exceptionally good.  The bar manager, for example, made me one of the best Bloody Marys I've ever had.  The breakfast chef did the same with my ham and cheese omelet.  As another example, the front desk staff thoughtfully had our bags delivered to our rooms while we waited for the rooms to be ready without any prompting.  Finally my friend Jim had a great time celebrating his birthday at the Seventy!",5,2021,09,23
49,Great weekend for couple,"This is a fairly new hotel so everything is very fresh and new looking the design is very modern and beautiful to look at - this hotel is fabulous !!! We had a standard room but there was nothing standard about the room it was very high quality room and had all the contents you could possibly need , hairdryer ironing board hair straighter creams shampoos conditioner towels robes pool towels I could go on !!! You could hook up your music to their Bluetooth speakers a nice touch ! The bed was huge and very comfortable !  The rooftop pool is small but perfect, the lounge area up there is beautifully done it was just missing a bar service but maybe we didn‚Äôt have one because it was September ?  otherwise you could relax up there all day!!  The spa area is free and so worth going down there to relax it‚Äôs so beautiful and the staff are so nice - you can pay to have treatments done if you like.  The breakfast was included on our stay and so glad we opted for that it was 10/10 the best range of breakfast items there was nothing that was on the list it was absolutely fabulous .  I only have one bad remark and that was the restaurant in the evening the food was not great and the options are very limited and portions are very very smal.  The bar area has to be seen surrounded by beautiful seating area and lighting  we will definitely go back! I forgot to mention they  delivered up a bottle of champagne complimentary for our wedding anniversary lovely friendly staff on reception and in the breakfast area ans lovely chef !!",5,2021,09,20
49,Best in Barcelona. Or even better.,"Seventy:

Just freaking awesome.

We stayed here five nights in early September 2021. Right now, Seventy is the best hotel in Barcelona (officially) and the best I've been to (including Hyatt, Marriott, Pullman, Sofitel, mandarin oriental, etc.)

The hotel itself

It is just amazing. Incredibly stylish interiors, high ceilings, a bunch of small details make the experience unforgettable. Pleasant aromas in all rooms (even in the parking lot lifts !!!). Lovely spa with hammam, sauna, pools and rain showers. A very cozy rooftop heated pool, even after sunset, it is a pleasure to swim in it!
You want to photograph every angle, relaxation and work areas in the lobby, spiral staircases, bar, facade, patio, corridors, toilets, rooms, and pools in this hotel!
Gosh, how the aromas of soap and other liquids are selected!
Hardwood floors are rarely found in modern hotels, but they add a touch of coziness, which I like.
Oh yes, there are also six floors of underground parking in the Seventy, for quite reasonable money :)

Rooms

Although inferior to the interior of the lobby, the room's interior still puts on the blades most of the hotel chains around the globe and all hotels in Barcelona. We lived in the ""seventy room"" (411). This is an average room. I recommend it with all my might. Wooden floor (my fetish), marble (or marbled?) tiles in the bathroom, Grohe and Hansgrohe plumbing (!), walk-in shower, huge (!) towels for all occasions (use if wet :)), a towel rail on which you can hang the clothes of a company of soldiers, pleasant lighting, premium cosmetics, a ""valera"" hairdryer and a hair curler. And a fantastic bench opposite the sink and mirror, which turned out to be very comfortable. An adorable welcome box from the hotel, with hand cream, tissues, toothbrushes and other pleasures. Oh, and soft thick toilet paper if that's important to you too

(And this is all about the toilet !!!!!)

Moving on:
Bed. 180x200 cm of restful sleep. A soft mattress, a nice blanket (but I like it heavier), a pillow menu for any sleeping style, and just snow-white linen!

A sixty-five (oh, come on, it would be hilarious to have seventy inches in seventy) inch TV right in front of the bed! You can do screen mirroring, but only from an android; if you have an iPhone or a Mac - it's a mess, you only have the option to share through HDMI. The HDMI-HDMI wire itself can be taken at the reception, but grab the type-c adapter from home.

Three Bluetooth speakers in the ceiling of your room! Two above the bed and one above the toilet. Damn, I'll miss this. (You can also use the TV as a Bluetooth speaker)

Fast air conditioning from Daikin. Quite, yet powerful :)

USB charging for each bedside table (by the way, why are bedside tables without drawers?), There are also switches and ordinary sockets. But usb's seems to be 1amp.

Beautiful vertical floor-to-ceiling windows are protruding outside the room, behind wooden shutter doors. If the wooden curtains are not enough for you, there is a toggle switch to lower the blackout blinds next to the bed.

Breakfast
Breakfast is ok. Yes, there are fresh juices. Yes, there are jamon, cheeses, cold cuts and pastries. But on the fifth day, we get tired of it. Everything is the same every day. And yet, there is no fish. You will not leave hungry, but you should not count on the Michelin level either.
And breakfast takes place either in a charming courtyard inside the hotel or inside, as you like. There are no queues or empty plates on the buffet.

Restaurant in the hotel
It is rather good. The prices are the same as in other restaurants, but fast, friendly and you don't have to go anywhere.

But the main jewel of this hotel is the staff members.

Holy crap! Spain, and indeed the whole of southern Europe, has never been famous for its service. But here! I don't know how you motivate your employees, but they are ready to come to the rescue at any time, in any circumstances. They will go beyond the rules and will do their best to make you happy. We felt like the most welcome guests at the Seventy house. We haven't heard refusals all five days, neither day nor night.

In the spa area, we were given bathrobes, towels and slippers, so that we should not go to the room to get our own. While we were sitting in the hammam, we were offered cold water, and the staff brought it directly to us!

They found us cocoa at breakfast, which the coffee machines did not have, and helped me find the desired taste of jam in the common grief.

We were allowed to sit at a table outside the restaurant area at lunch, simply because we liked it there better! And we were completely covered with the table that we had chosen. No questions!

And, of course, the guys at the reception played a unique role. Yes, now everyone is wearing masks, but they know how to smile with their eyes so that you immediately feel at home. I do not look like a Russian oligarch (fortunately or unfortunately), but despite this, I did not notice a single sidelong glance while we crocs'ing around the hotel. And here are some examples of reception hospitality:
1. We went to the beach and asked if there were beach towels. One of the staff immediately brought us two huge towels and a bag. They didn't fit into the bag, so he excused himself and brought two bags to put the towels. When we returned, he immediately took our bags of wet in again, and we went to the room with free hands
2. We were very interested in the rental (sharing) of various vehicles (bicycles, scooters, cars) and the opening hours of local attractions. The front desk googled everything for us! They found us comfortable trains, tickets, told us about different ways to get somewhere!
3. We were asked several times a day if we liked everything and if we needed anything
4. I also really liked the soap. And I wondered if I could buy one to take it home? Instead of telling me where I can buy something like that, they just gifted it to me!
5. We went to the outlet in a rented car, and did not want to park for money at the hotel, and the guys at the reception gave us a free hour of parking so that we could safely transfer all our purchases directly to the room.
I cannot single out any of the staff members because they were all sooo friendly and helpful. Everything was just exceptional.

And forgive me my impudence, but I will dilute the praise not even with minuses, but with the details that I would like to remark:
1. The water pressure is not the strongest. Difficulties while regulating temperature.
2. In the sink of my room (411), cold and hot water are reversed (and it is not confusion with colors, it is written on the separate taps, and cold means hot)
3. Cleaners turned off the heated towel rail every day. (The tumbler turns it on at the bottom end of the right pipe, it lights up when it is turned on)
5. Towels can be much fluffier
6. I want a more varied breakfast
7. Phone calls even within Spain from a room are expensive. Extremely.
8. One bottle of water per day for two in the room is not enough
9. This is the first time in 5-7 years when the hotel collected a deposit upon arrival :) (150 eur, but still...)",5,2021,09,18
49,"Amazing stay, 100% recommend ","We stayed here for 6 nights and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The location is fantastic - in a lovely neighborhood itself,  just off Passeig de Gracia and super close to all public transport links. The staff are fantastic - so friendly, professional and always happy to help. The hotel itself is absolutely beautiful from the lobby, to the bar to the rooms, rooftop pool and stunning spa. Food and drink prices are also really reasonable. We had a late flight but were able to use all the facilities after checkout until we had to leave. Can't fault anything, would definitely recommend staying here when visiting Barcelona - thanks for having us! ",5,2021,09,18
49,"We are coming back, soon!!!","Incredible experience at an incredible place!

We had a family occasion last week in Barcelona and we were advised to stay at the 70.

That was one of the best ever experiences we had at the hotel!

It is very difficult to exactly define why we loved the 70, but we can try between the great rooms, service, decoration, patio‚Ä¶.but the winner is the incredibly attentive personnel from the GM to the reception employees!!!!",5,2021,09,13
49,Big thank you to all of the staff at reception,"This hotel opened in 2019 but every thing is still very new as there must not have been many guests in 2020 or they were closed because of the pandemic. The rooms are on the small side even though we were in a room with a terrace - the terrace, however, was large, enough for a long table with chairs and two recliners. I believe this hotel is geared towards a younger crowd as there is a lot of mingling space in the lobby, eg. lounge areas and also high table with electrical outlets where you can possibly work. 

There is a beautiful outdoor casual dining areas on the G/F with a fountain and olive trees, perfect for a meal or drinks.

The BEST part of the hotel is the staff at reception. I must have emailed the hotel a million times requesting help with this and that, since there were so many changing travel requirements, and every request was met very efficiently and without a hint of annoyance. They were most thoughtful and kind. I have received better service here than at hotels whose rates are multiples of what Seventy charges.

I will most definitely stay here again on my next visit to Barcelona.",5,2021,09,09
49,There's No Need To Look At Another Hotel,"Unassuming when you arrive and view the building from the outside, actually rather ordinary, but once you're inside the hotel, view the uniquely beautiful lobby and then check-in with some of the best, friendliest and most helpful staff, you know you've made the right decision choosing Seventy Barcelona.

The amenities are great, the rooms are extremely comfortable and perfectly appointed, and honestly I haven't had this great a night sleep at a hotel, probably due to the auto blackout blinds and the soundproofing. The bed was pretty damn great as well. The only drag I will give is the view from the room, but it's a city and not all hotels get view rights.

I pored over Barcelona hotels, had stayed at a Seventy in Rome and really enjoyed it, but Seventy Barcelona delivered.",5,2021,08,31
49,Superb hotel with first class spa treatments in a fantastic location,"My daughter and I are just back from a long weekend in Barcelona. Seventy is in a perfect location, just off the stylish Passeig de Gracia and all the main must-see places are within walking distance. Reception area was lovely, full of comfy sofas, chairs and tables, very inviting. Loads of quiet areas to work or relax in. Check-in was seamless, friendly, helpful reception. Our 3rd floor patio room was beautiful, full of light, airy and perfect temperature. Beds and pillows were very comfortable, love the quiet efficient air-conditioning and Bluetooth connectivity with the speakers. We slept like babies! We appreciated having the hair straighteners! We had our first and last night dinners in the patio area dotted with olive trees. They were delicious - fresh fish, vegetables, truffle risotto, quinoa salad. Same goes with the breakfast, great choice of hot and cold food. Eggs cooked any way you like, just request it. We love the chirping birds and running water, so relaxing. The pool area with its salt water on the 7th floor was a great spot for siesta time. The highlight for me were the spa treatments with Elenor. I had the sports massage and kobido facial using organic and vegan products called S√ßens. The massage felt great after a long run around the city. And the facial - well, it was the best facial I've ever had and I've had loads before. So worth it! Apparently, this is the top award-winning facial in Barcelona. The products smell and felt just divine so I took a couple home with me! The gym facilities were great, my daughter used it for an hour's workout. In terms of cleanliness and hygiene within the hotel, we were very satisfied, we felt very safe. We'll definitely be back and would thoroughly recommend this hotel. Thanks Team Seventy for a relaxing, memorable stay for us.",5,2021,08,30
49,"Beautiful property, amazing staff & perfect location all for a great value!","My husband and I recently stayed at Seventy Barcelona at the end of a 2-week trip around Europe. After a lot of research, we landed on this hotel because the reviews & photos were great and the value was better than many of the other hotels we researched. The hotel exceeded our expectations - the lobby is beautiful with high ceilings and modern decor and the rooms were spacious and very comfortable. The staff at check-in was very friendly and helpful, especially with helping us print certain documents we needed in order to travel home. There's a rooftop pool which was a nice escape from the warm weather. We loved the location next to Eixample and it was only a 20-min walk to the Sagrada Familia which we visited during our stay. We would definitely stay here again!",5,2021,08,22
49,Very comfortable room and great value ,The room was amazing. Big bed and plenty of places to sit. The automated blackout blinds and extremely quiet air conditioner meant that we got an amazing nights sleep after a tough long tough day in transit. My only complaint would be that the bar service was a bit slow but there was only one guy on the bar trying to make everyones cocktails to the highest standard. There were other staff on the floor setting up for breakfast. Perhaps they should have helped. Great place though ,5,2021,08,22
49,OUTSTANDING,we¬¥ve been there twice and we extended our stay both times. Outstanding hotel in which directly from the first step into it a feel-well atmosphere is starting. After a long day being out for multiple actions it truely feels like coming home. Exceptional staff -  especially JOEL had our back and made us still feel confortable even during some bad situations (which had totally nothing to do with the hotel). Thx very much again. And we will be definitely be back!!!,5,2021,08,17
49,Amazing stay in Barcelona,"We have had the pleasure to stay 3 nights in this beautiful hotel. First of all the aesthetic and the facilities are amazing. Anything you could need or want is available. Besides that we have been very impressed with the hotel staff which is what really makes the difference. The breakfast is also really good. The breakfast staff Elias and Fabiana were super welcoming and kind.
The location is also great, the fact that they have their own parking garage for a very decent price in the middle of the city was an extra plus. Would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2021,07,24
49,Family trip to Spain,Excellent service. Staff were very helpful in booking Covid tests. Hotel very clean and new. Rooms very comfortable. Breakfast was in a very peaceful terrace with olive trees and a fountain. Would definitely return to this hotel if visiting Barcelona,5,2021,07,22
49,Excellent staying wonderful hotel,"We stayed there for 5 nights during July 2021 and it was way beyond our expectations.

I recommend this hotel to all visitors in Barcelona!",5,2021,07,13
49,Into the blue,"Excelent location. Welcoming staff. Very comfortable rooms topped off with great interior design.
The rooftop pool area is a great place to unwind at the end of the day. 
Management goes out of their way to make you feel welcome. Definitely a more individualized experience.

49,Seventy reasons to come here,"I would have at least seventy reasons to write about this magical place. Seventy is not an option, it is more than that. It is an extraordinary opportunity to feel special, pampered, relaxed, wonderful. The atmosphere, the food, the staff, all are at the absolute superlative. Who says you have to spend a fortune on all this? You have to try to understand that once you get here, you feel hard to leave. Seventy exudes good taste and elegance. Congratulations to the Seventy team and especially to Aurelian who prepared us the most delicious cocktails ever, for professionalism and kindness. We will be back soon, very soonÔÅä",5,2021,06,10
49,Memorable stay ,"What a beautiful and luxurious hotel! From the arrival to the departure everything was perfect. I loved the rooftop pool, the bar is amazing too. The cherry on the cake was the staff (Joel, Paola and Aurelian), they were doing an amazing job at recognising guests and make sure they feel comfortable. ‚ò∫Ô∏è",5,2021,06,09
49,Wonderful stay at this new hotel in Barcelona,"I went to Barcelona twice in a very short time and stayed at this great hotel. 
The interior surprises you with a fresh design, and a relaxing lounge area on the rooftop. There is also an in AND outdoor pool as well a modern and luxurious suited gym. 

The rooms are kept modern, and very clean. The hotel is always neat there is no moment we worried about our saftey. The staff is friendly and fluent in english. 

I will definitely stay there again.",5,2021,05,27
49,It Starts with The Doorman...................,"This is a top Rated Hotel.
Starting with a Personable Doorman to the Front Desk employees, most everything exceeds your expectations.  The Rooms are larger than most European Hotels and much better equipped.  Starting with your Key Card to access the Elevator to motorized Shades &  etc etc.
The breakfast cost a bit more but it's well worth it; custom Omelets/Eggs brought to your Table, almost anything you might want.    Beautiful Hotel in a safe Area.

We used Uber    (NOT Cabify)   easy to get around. About 30 Euros from Airport.  We used ""Christian"" a Bike Taxi Service; very entertaining.",5,2021,05,24
49,Great for a local staycation,"Booked a little local getaway for my boyfriend¬¥s birthday. 
Hotel itself is amazing, central location - a new property that has not yet been operational for a year.
Nice indoor courtyard with olive trees, fantastic touch that helps remove the city feel.
Staff superb, they helped me organize some details for the special occasion - friendly, efficient team who went above and beyond to help me with the arrangements. Fanny and Param at the Front Desk were really great!
In terms of culinary offerings, good quality, breakfast items were carefully laid with measures in place. Selection perhaps a little smaller than usual, but to be expected with the current situation ongoing.
Dinner amazing, three course menu prebooked, good quality and variety of choices, Roman and Roberta were outstanding and very eager to assist.
Lastly, SPA was ok, treatments were fine, friendly reception team, vegan products.
Wet area ok, with an indoor pool that has a 30 min access included with your booking - do reserve as soon as you check in as the capacity is currently limited.
Nice outdoor pool on 7th floor, though menu wise they could either be more flexible or accomodating on finger food requests on the poolside.

All in all, great stay! Thank you team for all your help!",5,2021,05,18
49,In general overall comfort and attitude; nice place to spend time in,"Booked a ""Seventy"" type room. Spacious, great design and feel. You have all you need. Ended up not using the TV although is there and a nice one, but went with  the bluetooth music system (easy to set up via wall panel and good sound from ceiling speakers, including one in bathroom). Service in restaurant (Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner) friendly and quick. Team at recepetion very helpful and available. To remember the period we are in, not easy to offer a good service with current limitations but Seventy and team do it. Will return enxt time around.",5,2021,05,14
49,A personal favorite - Home Away From Home,"There are few hotels that just get everything right. Amazing, proactive and friendly staff,  rooms well designed and comfortable, a beautifully decorated, inviting lobby that is more like a living room and co-working space and a well priced, cozy restaurant. This is a gem of a hotel in a great location. 
Bravo. Will be back for the n-th time soon!",5,2021,05,01
49,A fantastic place,"We (2 adults and 2 child) had a wonderful stay in the Seventy Barcelona. Everything was just perfect: Style, Service, Food, Rooms, Place, Quite. For me, as a frequent Barcelona traveler, the best place to go.",5,2021,04,29
49,Hospitality & Safety,"Hospitality and safety do go hand in hand in this wonderful hotel. Excellent service, personal attention and ‚Äúcoming home‚Äù feeling is what I would say after staying here. Special thanks to the restaurant manager and Jo√´l from reception! I would recommand this hotel to everybody who is looking for a relaxed stay in Barcelona. ",5,2021,04,09
49,New favourite hotel in Barcelona,"The staff (especially Victor and Fanny) go above and beyond to make your stay a dream. Everything was just perfect.
The hotel is very new and the decoration is really nice. It was spotlessly clean at all times and the service was quick and food fantastic. 
We will be back!",5,2021,03,09
49,A Gem in Barcelona,"Fantactic Hotel in BCN. A mix of Mediterranean /East Coast decoration and atmosphere.  
Perfectly placed , just 2 ' by foot of Paseo de Gracia /Diagonal 
The hotel is completely new and the service is warm and professional.",5,2021,03,01
49,Fantastic hotel,"We stayed in Seventy hotel with my wife and we really enjoyed the time spent in this hotel! Our room and all places we visited were crystal clean (including the spa area). It seems either brand new or really well preserved. The reseption and restaurant area are very stylish and well decorated. The terrace is just amazing! We ordered a Relax massage in hotel Spa, we had a dinner and breakfast. All great and 100% recommend!",5,2021,02,22
49,Business Room Rental,"We used the hotel for a business meeting and I was very impressed with the professionaliism and friendliness of the hotel staff. Everything had been prepared to our exact specifications and all of the areas we used were impeccably clean and all of the necessary safety measures for Covid 19 were strictly adhered to. The hotel itself has been designed using high quality finishes throughout, it is bright, spacious and modern. Highly recommended.",5,2020,11,21
49,Spectacular ,"We tried to change our flight reservations; just to stay a few days more, but we had no luck.
From the staff to the location, everything about this hotel was beautiful. We took the train from the airport then transferred to the metro. The hotel is a few blocks from the metro and about four blocks off the main avenue Passeig de Gr√†cia. ",5,2020,08,20
49,A lockdown minibreak in Barcelona,"The hotel was immaculate with stunningly designed rooms. The patio room was spacious and clean with a king size bed and sofa in the room.  Housekeeping did a really good job the whole time we were there particularly given this was during Covid. 

The location is good - only a few minutes walk from the main shopping streets.  The staff were extremely helpful in booking restaurants for us.  Would definitely recommend and would stay again. ",5,2020,08,18
49,Rated Highly for a Reason,We stayed here for one night in Aug 20 on our way to France. Chose it for the good reviews and were not disappointed at all. Stylish with excellent attentive staff (Claudia on reception in particular who suggested and booked a fantastic restaurant for us). In spite of the COVID restrictions we had a brilliant stay. Everything was spotlessly clean and the staff had strict protocols to keep us safe. The pool is brilliant and the bar would be a fantastic place in the evening full of people. Car parking underneath the hotel too. Excellent! ,5,2020,08,15
49,So professional,"great experience considering the current global pandemic 
The staff are so professional and helpful
The hotel itself maintains full hygiene standards 
It felt so safe to be around
Rooms are small but the great value that the Spa and the roof Pool give, overcomes every possible negativity",5,2020,08,10
49,EXCEPTIONAL SEVENTY!!! ,"On arrival staff was very friendly, polite and helpful. During the stay all staff was again perfect at delivering high standards of service. Especially Danellia a member of staff and the chef in the kitchen. Highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting this area of Barcelona",5,2020,07,25
49,Fantastic Hotel,"We originally booked to stay at a sister hotel, Hotel 1898, but the hotel was closed due to the pandemic. The staff rebooked is at Seventy Barcelona. The Hotel is new, bright and well designed. The staff were very friendly, helpful and professional. We particularly liked the location which is nestled in a quite neighbourhood just off Avienda Diagonal. Many of Gaudi‚Äôs homes are but a short walking distance  away. There are several excellent restaurants nearby. Highly recommend the Seventy Barcelona.",5,2020,07,21
49,Beautiful modern decor and world class staff - our favorite place to stay in Barcelona!,"We stayed during a critical time in Barcelona due to Covid-19 restrictions, and yet had one of the best holidays in Barcelona ever.

We enjoyed the stylish patio, the beautiful pool area, our comfortable modern room and the delicious morning buffet.  Everything was clean and the staff were extremely friendly, helpful and professional in a very personal manner. We will definitely come back!",5,2020,07,21
49,You have to choose this hotel when visiting Barcelona,"The Seventy hotel is beautifully designed and very modern. I loved the attention to detail in the rooms - so many details in the design that you will rarely find (just speaking of the small leather box inside the safe deposit box to put small items or the light switches). The flatscreen TV was probably the largest I have seen in a hotel room in a long time. Perfect if you're on a business trip to watch a movie but I did not use it. Breakfast was very good with large choice and staff was very friendly at all times.
There was one housekeeping incident but I believe this must have been accidental. I reported it to the Front Desk team that immediately looked into it, however, I would have appreciated a follow-up.
Apart from that, you definitely have to stay here if you go to Barcelona and you will not regret it!",5,2020,07,16
49,Post covid visit,"Just returned to UK after a five day stay at Seventy and what a wonderful trip it was. Not only was the room clean and beautiful, the bed was ultra comfortable and the soundproof walls and electric blinds facilitated an excellent nights sleep; so much so that my daughter and I slept a full 12 hours the first night!!!
The staff maintain a strict procedure of hand sanitising and distancing whilst remaining friendly and helpful. The places of interest were open (apart from the Segrada Familia which was still worth a look at its breathtaking architecture from the outside). It was also an ideal time to visit as there was practically no queuing to see the world famous attractions- Palau de la Musica Catalana (stunning) Barcelona Cathedral (do not show too much flesh to ensure entry to this ) Casa Vicens and Casa Batllo (absolute must sees). The latter the most expensive but worth it.
We ate at Don Kilo, Mimosa and La Pepita (directly across the road from hotel) which were very good, especially La Pepita, best to book this one.

49,customer service at its best...,"This has to be one of the best hotel experience my wife and I have had and it is mostly thanks to the excellent, friendly and very professional staff they have, needless to say the hotel is beautiful with excellent facilities and in a great location. A special mention has to go to Daniela the lady working in the Dining area for her warm nd friendly approach to guests. We will definitely be coming back.",5,2020,07,10
49,Great Customer Service,"We had booked a trip for this summer and due to COVID were forced to cancel.  The folks at Seventy were amazing, gracious, and kind.  We have plans to visit once leisure travel is safe again and will definitely be staying at the Seventy.  I wouldn't stay anywhere else.  Thank you Seventy and I hope we get to visit soon!",5,2020,06,06
49,Chic and wonderful Stay,"My mom and I stayed at Seventy in October of 2019, when it was just beginning to open to the public. While I had seen many pictures of the wonderful lobby and sleek design, we were not expecting the wonderful service that came along with it. From the concierge, to the bartenders, masseuses, and kitchen staff, each person we came across was not only attentive, but went to an extent in their kindness. My dad had ordered for a surprise massage for us, and  Mr. Jose provided a  card with a message on it, and ran to get fresh roses to accompany  the surprise. It was a kind gesture that we won't forget! Highly recommend for those looking for a boutique feel with mediterranean design with easy access to transit for your weekend trip.",5,2020,04,17
49,Amazing Hotel,"This is one of the best hotels I have had the privilege of staying in. From the moment I walked in after a long flight I was greeting with warmth and outstanding customer service. I was able to check in early which was much needed with an upgrade! The hotel has such an amazing cool vibe and the staff could not be more accommodating. Everything about my stay there was fabulous. The Spa is spectacular, the bar is gorgeous and the rooms are beyond luxurious, clean, and comfortable. I hope I will be lucky enough to make it back there one day soon.",5,2020,04,10
49,"Ben, Amazing customer service","Ben helped us with our reservation and showed professionalism, kindness, and amazing customer service. It helps me recommend this hotel for future guests and for ourselves, we will be staying here whenever we visit Barcelona.",5,2020,04,06
49,Extraordinary hotel!,"We felt the positive vibes the moment we walked into the hotel, the lobby is very vibrant and live, the staff were super friendly at check-in, special thanks to fanny who showed us around the hotel and walked us all the way to our room to guide us with the great features that they offer in the rooms + she recommended a bunch of great local restaurants. The vanity kit was very unique and environment friendly and they also provide a hair straighter in the room.
They also surprised us with a lovely honeymoon treat. 
The hotels is not only located close to the famous sites but it‚Äôs also next to amazing restaurants and cafes.
We really enjoyed our stay and decided to extend for a few more nights.
Hasta luego Seventy Barcelona!",5,2020,04,04
49,Awesome stay,"I stayed in dozens of hotels last year and Seventy Barcelona was the best deal of them all. 

It is a really cool, stylish and luxurious hotel that doesn‚Äôt have a hint of pretension. The staff is incredibly friendly and accommodating and any minor mishaps are quickly corrected.

The rooms are elegant and sparkling clean, the bed amazingly comfortable. I also loved the spa and the bar with the friendliest bartenders.

I stayed for two nights and spent most of my time working (the wi-fi is super fast!) but I would be happy to return on a more leisurely visit.

49,Clean and modern hotel in a central location,"We booked 5 nights in a SkyRoom at Seventy Barcelona. As soon as we pulled up in a taxi, we were greeted by a staff member and they walked our luggages to the check-in counter. The service and staff here are kind and courteous. The hotel vibe is really cool and hip. There are always people working and enjoying a cup of coffee at the lobby. 
We tried out the sauna, gym, and breakfast buffet. 
The gym (0700-2300 hrs) - is on the small side, you can comfortably have 2 to 3 people workout at the same time. The gym had one upright stationary bike, one elliptical and two treadmills, 4 sets of dumbbell weights, one kettle bell and several medicine balls (no pull-up bar or weight machines).  
The Sauna (0900 - 2100 hrs) - nice setup, one dry sauna, one steam sauna, with ice chips dispenser next stall over to help you cool off, also an indoor pool in the same area.
The Breakfast Buffet - I don't remember the hours, but the spread was great. They have variety of fruits, bread, cereal, salad, cold-cuts, cheese, and eggs.
Location of the hotel is ~25 mins from BCN airport and ~30Euros by taxi. Can easily walk to La Sagrada Familia, La Rambla, El Mercat Boqueria, and Park Guell. Many delicious restaurants, cafes, and bakeries within 5 minute walk.",5,2020,03,16
49,Good service inCOVID-19 crisis,I was able to obtain a refund for a cancellation during the COVID-19 crisis. I think this shows good service and consideration during a time of great uncertainty for travel. Will definitely book with them when situation improves.,5,2020,03,15
49,A Generous Response in the Face of a Crisis,"My husband and I were scheduled to stay at the Seventy for two nights this weekend. With rapidly changing events surrounding the spread of the coronavirus in Spain, we elected to try to orchestrate our return to the United States from our location in France instead of traveling to Barcelona as planned. We called the hotel the morning of our reservation to explain, and they couldn‚Äôt have been more kind and understanding. They generously offered to cancel our reservation at the last minute and not charge us for our three night stay. At a time when hotels and restaurants will all be greatly impacted by this health crisis, we genuinely appreciated this response from the Seventy Barcelona. Many thanks, and we WILL try again in the future to stay at your lovely hotel.",5,2020,03,15
49,excellent,"Clean, comfortable, nice design and very pleasant team, convenient location glad stayed there. Not close to the  water front or crowded tourist area, but good walking distance for most of the restaurants and shopping street. relaxing environment..  Has a good bar, and friendly bar tenders.. easy to spend the time in the hotel too",5,2020,03,15
49,Worth it,"We had a wonderful stay here. The rooms were so comfortable; the light blocking blinds, soft king sized bed, and amazing bathroom and shower. We couldn't believe the spa was free for guests and definitely took advantage of it. We felt that it was great quality for the price!",5,2020,03,11
49,Fantastic!!,"Cute, modern, gentle, confortable, with all you can thonk of, one of the best hotels i‚Äôve been, but the best is the kindness of the people that work in, always with a smile and willing to make you a great stay. Definitivelly is a place to repeat.",5,2020,03,09
49,Wow - just wow.,"I usually judge hotels based on three criteria: room cleanliness and decor, hotel service overall, and convenience.

Room cleanliness and decor: This hotel is amazing. As you enter into the hotel lobby and up to the room, the place just speaks of quality. While the room wasn't huge, it was roomy enough and all the fittings and decor was great. The only thing that knocked it down a smidgeon was the cushioned seat in front of the sink, which had marks on it. 

Hotel service and amenities: I cannot speak highly enough of the hotel staff's service. Any question was not too hard or taking too much of their time. They were more than happy to assist and will always do it with a friendly smile. Prior to the stay, communications were prompt and polite.

Convenience: You can't beat the convenience of this place. It's about 5 minutes walk to a metro station which was direct from the Renfe train station (which was where I came from). Also, it's in close proximity to metro stations which goes to many of the big attraction. Casa Mila and Batllo were only a walking distance away.

Tip of the day: Play around with the lighting and power toggles - they confused me at first.

Overall, I would visit this hotel over and over again.",5,2020,03,08
49,Awesome place....very excellent service and great value,"Front desk was amazing...the French woman who greeted me at the front desk for checkin whose name I can‚Äôt recall always remembered my first name...incredible service....will stay again.  Only downside...no small   face towels and magnifying mirror was attached to wall and was not optimum due to my height. other than that, I think this is on par with a JW Marriott on a botique scale. And budget price.",5,2020,03,05
49,Amazing! ,"I just recently spent 4 days at the Seventy Barcelona. This hotel is brand new, the location is wonderful, just a few blocks from Paseo de Gr√†cia and at short distance from the main attractions. The room was big and comfortable. But what makes this Hotel even more special is the people who work there who did everything they could to make my mom and I feel like at home. Thank you Fanny, Paola, Joel, Fabiana and the rest of the team for your great hospitality. We will be back! ",5,2020,03,05
49,Best weekend break,"Seventy Hotel in Barcelona was a wonderful hotel. The style, decor, amenities were great. The staff could not have been more friendly and helpful. They made our weekend from the minute we arrived till we left! Thank you everyone! Gracias xx",5,2020,03,01
49,What an amazing hotel!,"My partner and I spent my 30th birthday here. The hotel was absolutely stunning, we had an amazing time. The entire staff were very friendly and accommodating. The room was spacious, comfortable & clean. We spent a day in the beautiful and relaxing spa. I couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better place to celebrate this milestone. We definitely will be returning! Thank you so much to Victor the hotel manager and all of the staff for making our trip so special.",5,2020,02,24
49,Unbelieveable stay at the Seventy Barcelona!,"Perfect experience, the best value for money!
New hotel, high quality of equipment - everything is in style and thought of all the way from the Bluetooth speakers in the ceiling to the design of the room, the lobby, and the bar.",5,2020,02,23
49,Amazing hotel,"This was by far the best hotel we have stayed in when visiting Barcelona
From arrival everything was perfect and to a very high standard 
Check was smooth efficient and with very helpful and polite staff and with the added bonus of a free upgrade plus a coupe of other surprises in our room
The room itself was spacious modern and finished to a very high standard- bed was so comfy and the shower was to die for 
The location of the hotel is ideal for seeing all the attractions of Barcelona and with a bus stop right outside and the nearest metro stop only a 5 mins walk you have access all over the city 
A big thank you again for making our 3 night stay most enjoyable and memorable. We will return soon without any hesitation!",5,2020,02,18
49,Amazing hotel,"The best in Barcelona and the best I had visited in Spain , won‚Äôt be the last time , enjoyed staying there , great location , super clean , modern design with lot of room facilities ( sound system , big LED , electric curtains , ironing , coffee machine , water kettle ) all what you can imagine is attached to the room .
Staff are so kind and polite , i loooooooved this hotel .",5,2020,02,17
49,Amazing new hotel in the heart of BCN,"We stayed two days during our last visit in Barcelona, the place from the moment you enter the huge doors is top chic design and atmosphere.  Designed as an modern but welcoming open space with a few coworking areas and restaurants.  Rooms are cosy but very nice designed. Breakfast can be improved but it's probably because the hotel is new. And last but not least...Location Location Location...and service, both GREAT",5,2020,02,16
49,Perfect venue for a visit to BCN,"We stayed at Seventy for a long in February and can only underline how impressed we were both with the staff and the property itself.
All the staff were extremely friendly, helpful and professional and spoke excellent English.
Our room was very stylish and modern, fitted with bluetooth speakers and huge a TV. The hotel seemed fairly busy but we were never disturbed.
The bar is great place to enjoy a quick drink or two and breakfast offered a good variety of choices.
Seventy is in a nice part of town about 5 minutes from Diagonal metro station which is on L3 and L5, so easy to get anywhere. Its also only a 5-10 minute walk from the Segrada Familia and maybe 15-20 mins from the top of La Rambla
We will certainly be back or maybe try one of the other NN Hotels in Barcelona!",5,2020,02,12
49,Long stay in Seventy,"This is a good hotel to stay for a short trip/visit. 
The staff are super friendly and you will be looked after.
Very good spar, in door basement swimming with sauna and steam room.
The room I had on 6th floor was spacious. 
The bar area during the evening is eventful and welcoming. 
The breakfast buffet is nothing special/could be better and I would suggest eating out.
Evening dinning is good but the location is so good for restaurants you really should eat out. 
The books shelves are not really which to me is a really shame/suggest a lack of substance. Would like this hotel more if it had really books.
The room has lots of blue lights under light switches which if you are a sensitive sleeper you might not like. 
This is a work hotel re a lot of people are working / on work trips there so expect to see people with a laptops.",4,2020,02,11
49,Fabulous Hotel in a Great Location,"We live about an hour from Barcelona and enjoy spending a night or two in the city sans children to celebrate special occasions. I was looking for something fun and different for my husband's birthday and came across this hotel. I booked a room via their website as it offered the best rates. We were only able to get away for one night, but we loved this hotel and will return. The entire staff was so friendly and service-oriented and we appreciated their efforts so much! We attended the beer tasting and had a great time and the bar is such a fun area to relax and listen to live music. Our room was so comfortable and plush. I cannot find any fault with this hotel! Breakfast had tons of options and the staff  went out of their way to explain everything to us (where to get the eggs, etc). I wish we could have stayed a bit longer to try the spa, but we will definitely do that next time. Hotel is close to amazing shopping and metro/public transport that will take you anywhere in the city in minutes. ",5,2020,02,10
49,Lovely spot for dinner,"The service is here is outstanding. The staff are very friendly and explain the menu and give recommendations. We tried some typical Catalonian dishes and all were delicious. We tried fried artichoke, croquettes, risotto and fish of the day- corvina. The ambiance is very comfortable and the decor appealing. Would definitely recommend this restaurant. ",5,2020,02,07
49,Favourite hotel of the trip,"Of the 3 hotels I stayed in on my trip, this had to be my favorite one. I was warmly greeted upon arrival and was attended to by one of the nicest receptionists I've met. I got an early check in and a bump to a bigger room, which was greatly appreciated. The hotel is new and very well designed. The bed was super comfortable and they offered control of the temperature - I opted for slight air conditioning,even in winter else the room gets too stuffy. There was plenty of space for our stuff and I liked the location. It's close to loads of public transport options and food, so getting around even late at night was easy. I didn't take the breakfast option, but I tried a few drinks at the bar and I loved it. The bartender has real flair and is super friendly. Try one of their signature drinks.

Things that can be improved - water temperature consistency. Varies from very warm to cool occasionally. The shower itself could have another light inside,as its slightly dim.

I wish the staff had name tags so that I could thank them individually,they were very helpful. ",5,2020,02,04
49,Fantastic Hotel and Fantastic Service!,"The entire team is great! The rooms are comfy and well equipped. The atmosphere is very positive and chill through the hotel. Jennifer and Oscar in the bar and morning reception team were excellent! Definitely recommend staying! The location is convenient to the metro line and you can walk to several popular destinations. The team will help with recommendations as well. Thanks for the awesome time, Seventy Barcelona team!",5,2020,02,04
49,Magical Trip,"We had a wonderful stay at the Seventy Barcelona. The trendy designed hotel interior was very impressive and the customer service was the best I've ever seen. The staff had a passion for making the customers stay as pleasant as possible. It was a great expereience from the moment we checked in. If I had to suggest an area which could be improved on it would be the food quality. The food wasn't bad but I feel its an area the hotel could improve on to create a really special dining experience. However, this is the only an extremely minor flaw. Thank you so much for a truly magical stay at Barcelona.",5,2020,01,31
49,Amazing Hotel,It was a great experience from the check in procedure all the way to the check out! Staff were very friendly and helpful especially Fanny who helped us and sent a surprise Champagne bottle and cake to the room for our special occasion! Parking availabilty is superb in a city like Barcelona! will surely book in this hotel when we come back to Barcelona,5,2020,01,31
49,Comfortable Rooms and Examplary Service,"Spent a few days while traveling in Spain. This hotel has a co-working space in the lobby area and is full of activity. Very hip decor everywhere. The front desk staff was super friendly. The breakfast served is very good and the wait staff there were friendliest people you will meet. 
The rooms were very clean and super quiet. The street noise however will come into the room and in the mornings it is bit much. Since we did not spend too much time in the room it wasn't a big factor.
The location is super convenient to everything. Almost all major things are within half hour walk or a short Metro hop away.",5,2020,01,30
49,"Classy, well-designed, with top notch service","We came to see Barcelona and have a great place place to stay in between the highlights of city, and instead found that the Seventy was a highlight in of itself!  The hotel is so amazing, that it became a luxury home with attentive and friendly staff looking to make your stay more pleasurable.  

The rooms are new and modern, with super comfortable beds, and very designed.  Hallways lined with acoustic walls dampen any noise from rest of floor as well.  Hotel facilities are superb for city center, with ultra modern pool, spa and gym.

Location is excellent, with  attractions, taxis, other transport easily accessible.

All in all, a great hotel highly recommended.",5,2020,01,28
49,Excellent Hotel,"My partner and I stayed three nights and were very impressed with Hotel Seventy. Every aspect of our stay was excellent and it is well deserved the high traveller rating. The rooms are modern, luxurious and well designed. I particularly liked the Bluetooth connections to the rooms audio system. The location is also very good with easy access to the metro and train line to the airport. 
If you book to stay here you certainly won‚Äôt regret it! ",5,2020,01,28
49,This is a gem ,"I picked this hotel because it is only a few months old. Not knowing what to expect.  We arrived early in the morning and luckily the room was ready. While waiting to be checked in, we went to take a look at the breakfast room. The nice lady offered us coffee if we wanted one. 
We checked in by Jose and he was wonderful. The hotel is vibrant. There was live music playing at night in the lobby ! If you like a small boutique hotel with new design, this is the place to stay in Barcelona. 
Staff is very friendly, eager to help, honest and down to earth. Special thanks to the beautiful Ophelia, she was very patient, extremely helpful and sweet who also introduced us to a few good restaurants. The staff is the gem of this hotel. There are so many names I would like to thank for. Joel, Fanny, Marti and many more...the doormen too!! 
The location is on the other end of La Ramble. The area is safe. 
We stayed in the Seventy room and it gave us the extra room for our 2 suitcases and there was a nice sofa too. The room was quiet even it was facing the main street. The bathroom was small but functional. I would suggest a hook in the bathroom to hang our clothes. There was a paper bag with simple toiletries.
I will definitely return. Thank you all again to make our pleasant stay!!",5,2020,01,28
49,Trendy ,"This hotel offers great amenities, a quiet working space in the lobby, spa, gym and amazing restaurant. Looks like a library from outside with large window openings. The staff is very warm and welcoming. Cuisine from the restaurant is divine. ",5,2020,01,28
49,"Glam, glam, glam!",I had read about this hotel in a local mag and decided to try it yesterday.  The place is highly impressive from a decor point of view.  Roomy and beautifully decorated throughout.  We stop to have some tapas and were served by Jennifer who looked after us extremely well.  There was live music which was excellent and we enjoyed our time there enormously.  Well done NN Hotels.  A result,5,2020,01,27
49,First class hotel with service to match ,"We stayed for 2 nights having booked it previously for our son and hearing great things.  We were not disappointed. This hotel is probably the best we have stayed in - all round everything is just perfect but the staff really do make the difference.  From the front desk to the spa, bar and housekeepers everyone was first class.  We will be returning and have recommended to friends - keep up the good work! ",5,2020,01,25
49,This is THE place to stay in Barcelona!! ,"We adored our stay. 
Firstly, great interior styling beautifully layered, excellent accoustic treatments..
Energy- you feel welcome as you arrive, you feel included with their fun evening activities like cocktail making, wine or beer tasting. We made friends from all over the world because of the activities at the communal table.
We also had a walk around the nearby Gracie neighbourhood with Paola and it seriously felt like a night out with a good friend! Roberta - you too girl! 
Well done Team Seventy, new hotel and you've nailed it.
Oh.. And did I mention the super lovely comfortable and unfaultable rooms?! Do it. It's a holiday of its own. ",5,2020,01,24
49,Hard decision not to give 5 stars,"The hotel has an elegant design and the rooms are superb. Beds very comfortable. Location wise it is good too. The one and only reason i did not give this 5/5 is because, having travelled to many top resorts, there was a certain quality lacking that i cannot quite explain - for instance we wanted a cocktail in the bar just as it was closing, but they said we can offer a beer or soft drink, whereas at other resorts we stayed the service has been so good that they would just do it for you. Maybe we are spoilt!? To be honest I am laughing at my own fussiness whilst writing this. All in all very good value for money. ALMOST luxury, but flirting with it on many levels.",4,2020,01,21
49,"Already good, but service requires improvement","This is my second review of the property. I have actually experienced number of service-related issues once I've recently stayed in the hotel for the weekend. 
However the hotel management paid such a noticeable attention to this situation that I've decided to give the property a second review.
The hotel is actually very modern with extremely nicely looking lobby. There is nice bar that is already frequently visited by locals for various occasions. 
Rooms are very nice, modern and tastefully decorated, but still are quite small especially when it concerns bathrooms. Bathroom is also lacking some privacy since part of it made of some kind of transprent shutters - if someone switches light in the bathroom you cannot sleep anymore.  
We stayed in their best room that has an open terrace that we barely used due to rainy weather. Please note hotel is saying right opposite apartment building and these terrace rooms might lack some kind of privacy though definitely adding to the overall limited room size. 
The other nuisance (management says they are  working on it) is impossibility to switch off quite bright and annoying blue night light. Also it would be great if their very large and modern 65 inch Samsung TV could allow connection to your Netflix account.. 
We also used their small, but well appointed spa which is especially nice after the day full of walking around Barcelona.
Overall I recommend this hotel (it is about 20 min walking from the city center) as good combination of price and quality, especially if hotel management continue to improve the guest service.",4,2020,01,21
49,VIP experience,"If you're in Barcelona, you need to visit Seventy wihtjut a doubt. The customer service as soon as you walk makes you feel like a VIP. The consistency is service across anyone you meet is simply incredible. The ambience and quality of the food are yet another part of the 5 star experience.

I'd rate it higher than 5 stars if I could.

Truly an award winning experience!!",5,2020,01,20
49,new hip and excellent,"Cool, hip and elegant - public areas and room.  The staff are equally young, hip, very personable, competent and enabled (not just doing a job)
Hotel has a great vibe...jazz and wine tastings in the evenings, bar is a happening place
Excellent location, walking distance to many sites, shopping and restaurants
Breakfast buffet, a lavish affiar, including omlets and eggs prepared individually, bubbly/cava and a host of local cheeses and meats
Highly recommended",5,2020,01,19
49,City hotels don't get better than this ,"We checked in for 3 nights for my birthday arriving on Thursday 16th January and from start to finish this hotel and staff have exceeded every expectation. To start the room rate was fantastic and very easily booked on the hotel's own website which also was offering a fantastic 25% off. The check in experience was first class and handled quickly and efficiently by a staff member who was just going off duty but rushed across to check us in as we were arriving, I wanted to add breakfast to the rate which was no problem and he discounted that as well which was very appreciated. The room on the fourth floor was beautiful and everything first class with great beds and pillows along with a bottle of free water which we always like. The room was a really nice size and very well planned with all the amenities you require . We went and sat at the cool bar area and chatted with the fantastic, friendly staff 
 cava which was also very good, after a wonderful couple of hours and 6 drinks and the food we got the bill and it was less than 60 euros which was brilliant value. The next morning after a great night's sleep we went to the hotel spa which though small was perfectly formed and a great place to chill for a couple of hours, the only recommendation I would make would be to fit in another couple of beds as only 6 in there and you could get 2 more in no problem, but this is a small niggle. Breakfast was first class and all done sustainably with no waste etc which was great to see and all the produce was super fresh, the orange juice and smoothy were amazing and wish I could take them home with me. On the Saturday night we joined in the cocktail masterclass that the hotel put on free of charge for guests with one of the bar tenders teaching us how to make a cosmopolitan and then showing us how it's really done, this was a real fun 40 mins and a great way to meet other guests. After this the live music started which was an amazing blues trio who played for nearly 90 mins and were of the highest calibre and I couldn't stop tapping my feet. The check out was just as easy and friendly with bag storage being offered without asking and the use of the spa etc being available as well with no extra cost until we were leaving not just until checkout.
The hotel is first class but it is made by its amazing staff and I would give it 11/10 if I could. I've never stayed in a better city hotel anywhere in Europe and at the price I paid I've never stayed anywhere better for this price. Keep it up seventy, you are now the standard other hotels have to reach.
Definitely the only place I will stay when we return to this beautiful city ‚ù§Ô∏è

49,Great staff ,"We had a great stay in Hotel Barcelona. Especially big thank to Breakfast and restaurant team. Fabiana, Irakles, Daniela, Andreina and Liga- thank you very much for super service and great mood we had every morning. ü•≥ üëèüëç breakfasts are really great here, food, and variety. Great job!",5,2020,01,16
49,"If I could live in this hotel, I would!","Holy moly! Where do we begin? We spent four nights at this beautiful hotel. It has an excellent location, close to Casa Mila and the Metro (Diagonal stop). Every staff member we came across was friendly, polite, and welcoming. The lobby interior is stunning as well as the decor in the restaurant. The indoor pool and spa are gorgeous. I treated myself to a 30-min massage and it was excellent. Normally, I don't hit the spa, but this one is high class. They use vegan and organic products. The pool uses bromine instead of chlorine, which is better for the skin. The facilities are spotless.

On to the room. Let's just say it's the nicest and most comfortable room I have ever stayed in. The bed was really comfy and we heard no noise at all. The blackout blinds can be raised and lowered with the flip of a switch from the bed. We slept soundly every night. The shower was lovely and bathroom was spacious. The decor was stylish and the room was very clean. Overall extremely impressive.

The only negative experience was at the bar when I went to use the free drink coupon given to us during check-in. I asked about the white wines and was poured a full glass without being offered a taste. I felt pressured to accept it although it wasn't to my liking. On the other hand, my husband was given tastes before choosing his drink. This was a minor upset, but our only experience in the bar.

Overall, we loved this hotel, and we will be back!",5,2020,01,13
49,The one you should go when in Barcelona,"This is a brand-new, chic, modern hotel in Barcelona. They have nice modern room, and comfortable bedding, also a cool place to work on their lobby.

We love the hotel because its comfort, its cool people, and great indoor swimming pool. The are also centrally located, making our days in Barcelona easy to navigate. 

Hercules and Fabiana from the breakfast team made our day so special with their sincere service and small dishes accompaniying our breakfast (sparkling wine, chocolate & strawberry), and their smiles üôÇ
Thank You for always giving your heart into the work. We appreciate it so much!! It makes our day",5,2020,01,12
49,New hotel with great rooms and great staff,"Good central location, close to the metro and buses and many nice restaurants. Safe neighborhood. Nice entrance and bar. Rooms are well appointed and having the toilet separated by a door from the sink is a bonus. Very friendly staff - always eager to help. Thank you Roberta for taking good care of us almost every breakfast.",5,2020,01,10
49,Incredibly amazing place to stay in BCN,"We came with not a lot of expectations from this hotel since it's brand new with very little reviews in the media BUT we found one of the best hotels we have visit ever!
WOW. the design and the warm ""housy"" feeling you get is right from the first moment you get into this hotel. stuff was so kind from the bar to the restaurant and the reception. 
we didn't want to leave this hotel - Breakfast was so good and just sitting there in the restaurant for a hour in the morning is 100% pleasure. than you go to spa and the pool is one of the great ones you'll ever meet. spa treatments are super professionals and fun. afternoon classes are great in the bar (wine tasting and beer tasting) also live music and DJ. i mean, what the hell!! Even the food was so tasty we just wanted to eat there. in front there's a good churros place and empanadaz place, casino and the rest of the area is amazing - lot of what to do without the rush of the very center of the city. we barely get to see Barcelona because of this hotel - lol :) but we have a good reason to return! 

In order to make this review complete - the problem with the fact its a brand new hotel makes not the best smell in the rooms and the halls. paint, wood. carpets smells fills the room and the air ventilation is very poor and there's no window.. the receptions guys gave us an extra key to keep electricity on in the room to keep A/C on in the room while we were not there. not the best solution for the inviormant. woh design  a new hotel in 2020 without any ability to open a window for fresh air? 
ask for extra key to avoid this issue too.

one day the skipped completely to clean our room and it was very dissapointing we called them to clean it at the evening. the other days they cleaned the room only around 16:00-17:00 and thats a weird time to do it. it wasnt that pleasant for us.",5,2020,01,08
49,Lives up to the reviews with ease,"Staying in January we got a really good rate here, I‚Äôd have been worried it was too reasonable if not for the consistent 5 star reviews already posted for such a new hotel. 

I‚Äôve been lucky enough to stay in a couple of places early on that you can tell will go on to be amazing hotels and this is definitely now on that list. You‚Äôll know when you step into the enormous lobby that this is a rather special and well thought out hotel. The downside is I know in a year or so‚Äôs time it‚Äôll be so popular I probably won‚Äôt be able to afford the same room again! 

Service was first class, all staff friendly, brilliantly presented and spoke great English, my Spanish is enough to get by but it‚Äôs always helpful if you have more complex questions. 

Room was amazing, we were on the 6th floor, huge bed, lovely linen, remote black out blinds, 65 inch Samsung TV (there‚Äôs a negative about this that I‚Äôll come to later) master control for lighting by the beds and a huge walk in rainfall shower, what else, plenty of storage, a sofa and an interesting view ‚Äì being at the back of the hotel we looked into a residential courtyard but I don‚Äôt see that as a negative, it was incredibly quiet. 

Spa was lovely and well-staffed, the bar downstairs is excellent, live music both nights on the weekend and amazing staff as per the rest of the hotel. Drink prices are also (currently) very very reasonable, from a coffee through to a cocktail you won't feel out of pocket. 

Location is spot on, the Eixample district is (in my opinion having been to Barcelona every year since the late 90‚Äôs) a much nicer area than where you‚Äôd stick your standard tourist pin as the place to be i.e near the beach, La Ramblas etc.

There‚Äôs a lovely feel about the area, it‚Äôs not too busy but you can get onto the Diagional in a few steps or to Passieg de Gracia in a minute for all of the posh shops and a walk down into the main part of bcn. There‚Äôs local caf√©‚Äôs and supermarkets at proper un-inflated prices, places to park a car and in the times of uncertainty we are in being out of the mix of thousands of tourists is a reassuring safety cushion for the nervous traveler. 

If you want a beach hotel with a big outdoor pool and sun-loungers then obviously this isn‚Äôt the hotel for you, but failing that requirement I can‚Äôt think of a reason you wouldn‚Äôt be happy to stay here. 

My one negative.. they‚Äôve managed to buy enormous Samsung smart TV‚Äôs that don‚Äôt have any smart apps like Netflix or Prime TV to log into, so you‚Äôre stuck with was is essentially a library of crappy channels. Some will say ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt go to Barcelona to watch Netflix‚Äù but after a day full of walking the city and eating the great food, that‚Äôs exactly what some people like to do, so take an iPad and get on the free wifi!",5,2020,01,07
49,Classy modern well appointed hotel in a perfect location with lovely staff,"We stayed (three people in two rooms) for four nights over New Year 2019.  The hotel is brand new, with high quality bedrooms, generous public spaces, and modestly priced food and drink. In summer it has a rooftop pool and bar. It is located just off the end of the elegant Passieg de Gracia (the Bond Street of Barcelona) and a minute from the Diagonal metro station, which is on the best line for getting around the city. It has all the advantages of being close to the sites and Las Ramblas, without the bustle.  Above all it has a young, enthusiastic, staff who will do everything to make you stay comfortable, and especially the wonderful Anna who creatively sorted out a difficult problem for us.Thank you again.  All the rooms are excellent, but particularly lovey are the ""terrace"" rooms which each have a large private patio.  It would certainly be our hotel of choice when we return to Barcelona.",5,2020,01,05
49,"Great Hotel, best service","We stayed at the Seventy Barcelona for four night.
Die Interieur is very modern, stylish and still cosy.

We never had such a service before. 
If you doesn't mind, you think it is 5* Hotel. All in all the hotel and the service is 5* worth. 

The breakfast is very fresh and served with local food and normal European food.
I can highly recommend the fresh fruit juices. 

We can strongly recommend this hotel and will stay there again, when we visit Barcelona the next time.",5,2020,01,05
49,Perfect,The hotel is new and this surely help within the cleanliness. The staff is really good and kindness and the stuff at the bar is not really expensive for hotel this rate. The Spa is small but it's good and clean ,5,2020,01,04

It was perfect stay to me

49,Fantastic email communication with USA,"I emailed the Hotel Seventy and asked them if it was possible for them to leave a surprise of flowers, sweets, etc in my husbands room when he checked in on a solo trip on Christmas Day.  Paola de Laa from the Experience Team at the hotel emailed me back quickly and via a few more email, we agreed upon chocolates, a bottle of wine, a charcuterie board and a boquet of roses.  The chocolate, wine and board were complementary!  She emailed me a simple ticket to pay for the flowers and they even left a note which I drafted to say we were thinking of my husband on Christmas.  I was extremely impressed with the ease of our emails and her communication with me being that I can only speak English (she wrote in great English).  My husband had a wonderful stay and was pleasantly surprised with the Christmas Day welcoming.",5,2019,12,31
49,Best Hotel in Barcelona ,"I believe this is the best hotel in Barcelona. 

From the moment we checked in the staff were friendly and accommodating. Joel especially at reception helped find us two rooms that were connected by a hall way. These were 425A and 425B. I would highly recommend these rooms for families. 

The rooms are very new and modern and are perfectly designed. In particular the bedding is really soft and we also liked the electric blinds and blue tooth integrated speakers.

Breakfast at the hotel is a very healthy affair and all the staff are friendly. In particular Iraklis and Roberta were very kind and helpful throughout our stay. 

The location of the hotel is a few minutes from the Passeig de Gracia and quite centrally located so you are able to get to all the tourist sites without trouble.

We also had dinner at the hotel and found the beef carpaccio amazing. Probably the best I have ever had. The service again  was very friendly and relaxed. There are many restaurants near the hotel withing walking distance. 

The lounge area of the hotel is also very trendy and great for relaxing and we enjoyed having a coffee here. 

My favourite part of the hotel is the indoor  spa area which I had access too. This was a very relaxing start or end to the day. 

I belive the manager Victor is doing a very good job with the hotel and believes in hospitality and service. 

This hotel is great value and I would highly recccomend it to anyone looking for a larger boutique hotel in barcelona. 

We had the best time here. Thank you

49,"Hotel ok,  But restaurant worst ever",The rooms are clean and definitely ok! The restaurant staff is kind grumpy and the quality is poor. We ordered a profiterole and we should say that the cook who made this would not succeed at macdonalds. It should be chocolate sauce bus its something which is sauce but definitely not chocolate. Worst profiterole ever. So get a better cook and a more friendly staff!!,3,2019,12,24

Breakfasts were flawless, bar and chillout spaces as good as it gets, and on top of that we were getting perfect relaxation and sleep quality. The rooms were super well sound-proofed, and the matresses were one of the best I've ever slept on. Highly recommended!",5,2019,12,23
49,Wonderful experience.,"Staff are friendly, flexible and an assett to the hotel. The receptiion area and whitehall has a good vibe with live music, friendly bar staff and a mix of locals and hotel guests - which is something you would not see in touristy places. Stayed in patio room and the room was spacy with all the useful essentials. The best bed and pillows I  have ever  came across in a hotel.",5,2019,12,22
49,Brand new hotel with a lot of potential,"I believe the review by Parag P on December 20th sums it up pretty nicely but instead of his 4 stars I decided to go with 5 stars instead. Simply because for such a modern, state of the art hotel we felt we received absolute great money for value (150‚Ç¨/night including breakfast for a 'Seventy room'). 

I very much expect prices to increase once they have build up a name and their client base has grown.

Noteworthy pros:

- Attentive and friendly staff
- Wonderful breakfast
- Absolute stunning room with modern facilities
- Spa; albeit rather small it had a very nice pool and sauna area. But I feel it can't properly hold more than 8-10 people.

Points of attention:

- Lounge area is often occupied with people not staying in the hotel. During our 4 day stay we daily saw several people just sitting there with their laptops, drinking one cup of coffee and next probably staying for hours on end. This is something I tend to dislike more and more in most coffee places for example as well. At first I found this to add to the atmosphere but now I feel they're just hogging all the space for ""paying"" customers.

- Perhaps not a direct point of attention but something Parag P pointed out as well. Because the hotel is so new, and possible because December probably isn't Barcelona's most busy month, there are very people present for breakfast and diner. This can also be seen as a blessing especially for breakfast but for diner it definitely affects the atmosphere a bit.",5,2019,12,22
49,A few days in Barcelona,"Hotel is new, clean and appealing.

Be aware that people (that are not staying at the hotel) hot desk in the communal lobby / entrance hall / bar / restaurant areas and most of the day so you‚Äôll struggle to sit in those areas at times.

The pool is open at 9am (a bit late for early risers like me), the gym is minimal so I didn‚Äôt use it. 

The room is good, quiet and spacious with good facilities. Our room had a bathtub with shower inside which was difficult to clamber in and out of safely. Would have preferred walk in shower for ease and safety.
The remote control for the toilet doesn‚Äôt work (it switches on but none of the functions actually worked)

The restaurant needs improvement. Staff walk around not doing much. They are not very attentive to international guests and seem to be focussed more on the domestic/ local guests. Service is inconsistent. Preferred treatment for locals and not so welcoming for international guests like us. We wouldn‚Äôt use the restaurant again or recommend it based on our experience.

They have regular events like wine tasting, beer tasting, music events etc... we found it difficult to find out about these. The hotel doesn‚Äôt tell you in advance or have the information in the rooms. We missed out on such events because of this. We then realised they are displayed on a small screen in the elevators (not the best and only place to put the info)

None of the staff that checked us in asked us if it was our first time to Barcelona or what the purpose of our stay was etc... no map or recommendations were offered to us. We were basically left to figure it all out ourselves. They are more interested in taking a holding deposit and asking you to pay even though we prepaid for our stay.

This is a well located, new, clean hotel with a lot of potential. Who ever runs it needs to train staff better and be more personal with service and attention to overseas visitors should be equal as that for domestic local visitors.

We didn‚Äôt feel very welcomed here.",4,2019,12,21
49,Outstanding,"I can't fault this hotel, the staff were superb the room was spacious, clean, and very comfortable.
It was my birthday whilst I was there and they brought a tray with some cake and a bottle of champagne to say happy birthday to me.
Very thoughtful, and a lovely touch from them.
I will gladly return.",5,2019,12,18
49,Lovely hotel,"Awesome new hotel. Rooms exactly like in the brochure. Complimentary upgrade upon arrival. Spa and indoor water circuit(/pool) were amazing.
Minor glitch with heating in the room, luckily it got solved right away. Unfortunately water temperature in the shower was inconsistent (one day perfect, next day tapid). 

Food from the restaurant was ok but not great, so just go to one of the amazing tapas bars right across and around the corner from the hotel! Love this location. 

Special thanks to Fanny & colleagues at the front desk, they were very nice. 
Also Roberta @the kitchen was very kind. Thanks for a great stay!",4,2019,12,17

49,Best hotel I have stayed in,"We stayed for a few nights after arriving in Barcelona and then again when returning after a trip to Portugal.  I can't say enough about how warm, helpful and interesting every single person on the staff is - front desk, lobby staff, kitchen/bar, housekeeping. Too many to name.  I have stayed in many dozens of hotels all over the world, from hostels to 5 star plus, and this may be my favorite.

The design is very contemporary but not showy.  The rooms are very quiet and comfortable.  We used the pool/sauna/steam room and it was clean and relaxing.  Live music and free demos of local beers, etc. keep the lobby lively.  The location is central and very walkable.  We lingered a long time at the breakfast buffet, enjoying a wide array of options.

The day we left (at 6 am) was my wife's birthday.  The staff went out of their way the evening before to make sure she felt very welcomed and loved, that she was able to celebrate before a long day of travel.  I don't usually rave like this, but thank you, Seventy Hotel staff!",5,2019,12,10

49,A fantastic hotel in a great location,"I stayed at the hotel during a last minute trip to Barcelona.
I booked a superior double room. The room is spacious and well laid out. The furnishing is modern and includes bluetooth room audio and usb ports galore. The bed was comfortable. The bathroom has a bathtub with shower, and a toilet with retractable electronic bidet.
The service at the hotel is very good, with courteous staff members. Check-in was smooth and quick, and all requests were responded to almost immediately.
The location of the hotel is great. Within walking distance to many famous historical sites. It is a good place to stay for both first time visitors / tourists as well as frequent visitors.

There are two points to note:

1) The WiFi, while quick, would drop on occasion. This seems to have been a problem with the node / access point and shouldn't be difficult to solve.

2) The flexible hose of the hand shower wand in the bath tub (the tub is also the floor of the shower) is coiled on to the bathtub floor. This may be annoying when taking a bath as there really isn't anywhere to put it but wrap it around it's holder on the wall (which is pretty low). It may also be dangerous while showering as a foot could get caught in it. The issue also isn't enough of one for me to drop the maximum rating I am giving to the hotel.

All in all it was an amazing stay. Seventy Barcelona is now my first-choice hotel in Barcelona, especially at the prices that still seem to be on offer. I look forward to staying here again.",5,2019,12,02
49,Excellent,Stayed twice last week for 4 nights total.  Great room and service.  Great lobby atmosphere.  Great location.  Gym is only weakpoint.  Only 1 elliptocal and 1 bike.  Plus very hot.  Not even a fan.  And no water available.  ,5,2019,11,26
49,Best hotel I've ever stayed in,"Wow. What a hotel. We decided to stay here for our wedding anniversary and spend a bit more than we usually would and wow was it worth it. The hotel is only 2 months old, and absolutely stunning. I am a property photographer and have attached some photos I took, it was an absolute joy!

The room was spotless, extremely beautiful and modern. The TV is HUGE, there are bluetooth speakers around the room and electric blackout blinds. The bed is huge and like a cloud. The spa and pool was lovely and the reception area and bar stunning.

The breakfast was incredible and so worth the extra money. So delicious and so much choice. We had Fabiana both days and she was fantastic, friendly and so helpful.

As beautiful as the hotel is, the staff made it even better. Every member of staff was friendly, helpful and did above and beyond to make us happy. We were left a bottle of prosecco in our room for our anniversary as well which was a really lovely touch. Couldnt have enjoyed it any more than we did!",5,2019,11,25
49,Stylish hotel,"Seventy is a new and stylish hotel in a good location.  The rooms have lots of techie devices which take a while to figure out how to use; staff is friendly, common space very comfortable.  Very quiet rooms.",4,2019,11,23
49,Excellent!,"Wonderful hotel, well located, very helpful and friendly staff.
Restaurant and Spa of very high quality.

49,Dinner at seventy,Great chef Marc delighted is with a selection of plates. Simplicity charged with exquisite tastes and textures. Great team working together for a great experience. For sure an option while staying in the hotel or traveling to Barcelona!,5,2019,11,21
49,My favourite hotel so far - Do not miss it!,"The best word that I can find to describe this hotel is WOW!

The moment I stepped in, I knew I was going to love it. The check in process is relaxed, easy and super welcoming.
The room is just gorgeous. I wish o had more days to enjoy that bad and that linen! So so comfortable, clean, new, fresh and so modern. They have state of the art Sound system via Bluetooth. You can listen to your own music through the speakers in the room!
The fitness room is small but well equipped and the spa is included in the rate! Go and enjoy it if you have the chance! The staff is so friendly and helpful - and they use vegan cosmetics only. So cool!
The breakfast is yummy and pretty healthy- And again the staff is so attentive, they remember your orders. They basically make you feel special.

Definitely my favourite hotel in Barcelona.

49,Excellent hotel,"A brand new excellent hotel located around 20 minutes walk from La Rambla. Fantasticly appointed rooms, good breakfast selection and an excellent well stocked bar. Staff  are really friendly and very helpful, wod not hesitate to return either on a business or personal trip.",5,2019,11,14
49,Excellent service and pleasent atmosphere everywhere,"Even though the hotel itself is fantastic, the staff make it even more wonderful. 
Absolutely everyone I had met or spoken - at the reception, in SPA, at the breakfest or dinner, was kindhearted and very friendly. I really enjoyed every moment of my staying here.
If possible, I'd love to stay in Seventy hotel when visiting Barcelona next time.",5,2019,11,11
49,"Stylish, friendly, boutique hotel","Fabiana waited on us each morning and she was an absolute delight. The breakfast was extensive with fresh juices, fresh bread, meats and cheeses and anything you asked for. The atmosphere and service are excellent. The rooms were gorgeous with nicely tiled bathrooms, rain showers, eco friendly and the best toothbrushes I have ever had in a hotel. The slippers are for left and right feet. I wore them and the robe provided to have a facial at the spa and a dip in the pool. A perfect experience and the most helpful staff. Luxurious. Good location.",5,2019,11,10
49,"Stylish boutique hotel, where you can get great breakies, drinks and laptop friendly","A great place to work (free wifi) & for drinks.

Not stayed here, but come here regularly to work, eat and play; for breakfast, lunch through to eve cocktails and even free wine, beer & cocktail tasting which they invite us to even though we're not staying here.

Coming from London, it's a bit Soho house style, although a bit more open and a lot friendlier (sorry Soho house) and a lot lot cheaper (and cheaper than a lot of the other Barcelona high end hotels)

Everyone is extremely friendly and more than happy to entertain and put up with my extremely broken Spanish with their fluent English. 

And on a late breakie, I didn't like a special sandwich I specifically ordered and the English in me didn't say a word, but Hercules immediately took it off the bill and offered a gorgeous fruit salad, which I absolutely loved.

I would highly recommend this place for work, breakie or just for some tasty drinks in a chilled environment as you always seem to be welcome, its like Barcelona's posh version of a Cheers Bar.",5,2019,11,07
49,"Great atmosphere, Amazing service every time!","Have been here a few times now, whether to work or have a drinks and relax and have always enjoyed the vibe, stopped in for breakfast again and thought worth mentioning the great service received again. Thanks Hercules :)",5,2019,11,07
49,I loved this place!!,"Gorgeous boutique hotel at very reasonable prices. They have considered even the smallest details and for only being open 3 weeks they are doing a wonderful job!!! The beds were extremely comfortable, the bathrooms were lovely.",5,2019,11,06
49,Wonderful Stay here!,"We had a wonderful stay at Seventy Barcelona. We had two rooms - traveling with our family. Worked out very well as the rooms were right next to each other. Amenities were wonderful, so was the staff. They were very friendly and helpful with our questions on directions and recommendations. If we came back to Barcelona, we would definitely stay here again and recommend to our friends.",5,2019,11,05
49,Wonderful stay,"Perfect hotel with amazing design.
Location is great close to restaurants and bars, breakfast are super tasty and fresh, staff are so kind and always happy to assist with smile.
We will diffantly recommend!",5,2019,11,05
49,FEEL THE MOMENT,"I have stayed at SEVENYT for three nights during last weekend. Their philosophy of being a guest house rather than a regular Hotel implies a closer, more personal service at boutique hotel level. This is indeed the experience I had during my stay. I have rarely felt more comfortable and cared for in any comparable setting.

Needless to say that any facility one would expect -be it spa, gym, bar etc. is given; rooms are tastefully furnished, with overall appealing aesthetics throughout the house. I had a great massage at their modern, spacious spa.

Breakfast is very good with fresh, exquisite products at a good variety. However, the attentive service of cheerful, charming Fabiana has to be specifically addressed: Thank you so much for a lovely start, with a genuine smile every morning.
 
SEVENTY is located in a hipsteresque neighborhood with a multitude of cafes, bars and restaurants available within walking range. Sagrada Familia is also within walking distance. 
When I needed advice, the most charming ladies at the front desk Tatiana and Ophelia went to great length to help with reservations and choices for restaurants, patisseries etc. Both are professional, burn for what they do and do it with a smile. 

At the risk of being repetitive: I had a great weekend, not least thanks to the wonderful staff at SEVENTY.

I highly recommend this place without any reservation.

All the very best

49,Lovely Design,Stopped by for lunch today and checked out the hotel. It's a beautiful space in a great location.I really enjoyed the design. Would definitely go back to have a coffee or wine and bring my laptop to work with a friend.,4,2019,11,03
49,"Trendy, Sophisticated Catalan hospitality in Barcelona","The hotel is gorgeous. Everything is well thought out - clearly the work of people who know and who care.  The architecture is elegant and the design details are soothing and exciting at the same time.  My wife and I couldn't stop talking about the design details.  As good as it gets.
Service is every bit on par with the best and you will love the friendly and sophisticated internationally diverse folks who host you.
Not cheap but not to be missed.  Excellent value for money - on a par with the best anywhere.
Special thanks to Roberta and Hercules for making every morning a happy start to our days in Barcelona!",5,2019,11,01
49,Amazing Hotel,"If I could give more than 5 stars I would. This hotel is located just on the outskirts of the tourist area so not too far to walk to be in the centre of the action. 
As soon as you step in you know you have made the right decision. 
We were celebrating my husbands 30th birthday and on arrival the reception issued us with 2 drinks vouchers to use in the bar. Once up in the room we then got a knock at the door and received a lovely chilled bottle of fizz. I booked the house room
But we were upgraded to room 608 a beautiful large room. Electrical blackout blinds, USB sockets, remote control bidet (yes really!) this room had all mod cons. Everything was spotlessly clean and the robes and slippers were a lovely touch. The breakfast was absolutely amazing and they cooked eggs to order for you also. 
We had drinks in the bar a few times and it was such a great place to sit. 

The decor in this hotel is just amazing and the lobby reminds me of New York in some ways. 

I can‚Äôt wait to come back and will be recommending Seventy to everyone!! ",5,2019,10,30
49,Best Hotel I‚Äôve ever stayed in,"Seventy Barcelona is literally the best hotel I‚Äôve ever stayed in! The staff here is absolutely amazing! They are extremely warm, hospitable and friendly and will do whatever it takes to make you feel at home and welcomed. Their breakfast is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. The rooms are very modern and the beds are extremely comfortable as well. They have automatic black out curtains which is helpful and they have awesome amenities such as bidets, pools, and a sauna. The decor is fantastic and they have many nightly free events such as cocktail making classes and wine tastings. I‚Äôm definitely coming back here next time I come to Barcelona. Thanks Seventy Barcelona! ",5,2019,10,30
49,Amazing location and breakfast ,"This hotel is brand new and in a perfect location that isn‚Äôt touristy. 

The staff are all amazing and friendly and helpful. 

The buffet breakfast is incredibly and the room was very comfortable. 

They also have a flat iron in addition to the hair dryer which was extremely lovely. ",5,2019,10,29
49,"Modern, stylish and comfortable","Everything as advertised. Super clean, modern room with a large, very comfortable bed (stayed at a ""Seventy Room""). The TV and other gadgets like bluetooth speakers in the room (and bathroom) were more than adequate, even for such a new hotel.

The staff was very attentive and friendly but in no way obtrusive.

Very much enjoyed the spa, which had a great atmosphere.

We did not use most of the amenities the hotel has to offer, but it felt like a living place, with guests working in the lobby during the day, as well as bar and entertainment in the evening. We felt very much at home.

The design and attention to detail throughout the hotel really stood out, i hope they can keep it that way.",5,2019,10,29
49,Gorgeous Hotel!  Impecable service! Amazing!,"We booked this hotel by accident. Actually, we booked a hotel near the Sagrada Familia but they ended up cancelling our reservation, they were full and did a mistake. So I found this hotel, Seventy, and he would be inaugurated just a few days before our trip.
My wife and I were a bit nervous, sometimes new hotels do not offer perfect services or some areas are under construction...
It was one of the best experiences we had over the last 5 years! The hotel is gorgeous, modern with great decoration taste. Employees are outstanding! Front desk, reception, kitchen, cleaning, everybody was so helpful, sympathic and smiling all the time! 
It is a pity we don't remember all names but we will never forget Daniela. She was at the breakfast and she was so sweet, she knew everything about the hotel and we had a perfect impecable service! Also the blond girl and the young man along with her were also outstanding!
Breakfast is also really tasty! It is worth it! Great food! Fresh, baked at the hotel. Much better than expected!",5,2019,10,27
49,Truly delightful and luxurious,"I have to say that this was the best hotel experience I've ever had.  From check-in, the staff was incredibly professional and friendly. When you walk in, you immediately smell the freshness and cleanliness of this hotel.  Then you see the well designed and decorated lobby that feels incredibly cozy, yet modern.  There is so much attention to detail, and nothing felt cheap or disappointing.  They had nightly free events for the guests including wine tasting and a cocktail course.  It was such a delightful touch to an already amazing place.  We learned how to make a cosmopolitan with a handful of people, and also enjoyed the group's company.  The manager is truly exceptional as well, making sure our stay was the best we had.  I highly suggest taking the breakfast option, as it is full of wonderful items.  We had an Italian chef cook us customized omelettes, as well as had a selection of many different breads, fruits, charcuterie, and cheeses, just to name a few.  The rooms are very tastefully decorated and comfortable.  We couldn't have asked for a better stay in Barcelona for the price.  They've done a good job of combining luxury with a comfortable homey feeling.  Lastly, the location is excellent.  It was located very close to the metro station to get around town, and also walking distance to many amazing restaurants, shops, and bars in the Gracia neighborhood.",5,2019,10,26
49,Was it amazing? Yes!,"My friend and I had an experience beyond our expectation. We wanted to stay close to Passeig de Gr√†cia and enjoy Barcelona to the fullest. At first we thought of Hostels, but the idea of sharing rooms with other people wasn‚Äôt part of the scope of our trip (twin rooms were no longer available). 

We booked through Seventy Barcelona website and shortly after made a call to ensure that everything was alright. This very first contact anticipated us that we made a good choice.

The reception was caring, the background music was warm, the smell was soft and fresh and the staff was kind. Moreover, room service dinner and breakfast were served beautifully and were delicious. We tasted Tortilla for the first time as a recommendation from the Chef.

A day before our departure, we were wondering if there was a pharmacy around and, although we could‚Äôve used Google Maps, we asked for guidance inside the hotel. Claudia and her colleagues were so kind that they almost accompanied us to the pharmacy. My friend and I looked at each other and said: ‚ÄúWow! How safe we are.‚Äù 

Thank you, Seventy Barcelona! We‚Äôll never forget our first experience in Barcelona. We felt loved and safe. We‚Äôll surely return.",5,2019,10,26
49,It‚Äôs a 10 - wonderful stay,"Discovered this hotel by chance (was near to a conference) - best choice ever. The atmosphere is really something, the main hall gives tou so much space for your brain to breathe. Breakfast is so personal and tasty. The spa is very nice too - go have a treatment if you can, they have awesome vegan cosmetic products (love to Yaiza who did amazing magic!)
But what made my stay really special is the team: you can feel collegiality and team-love everywhere. Every single seventy-team-member was supernice, friendly and personal. Can‚Äôt remember everybody‚Äôs name - but huge shout-outs to Ophelia at front desk, the whole kitchen-team and both Robertas - you all made every minute precious and unforgettable. Gracias <3",5,2019,10,25
49,Best hotel in town,"I would say that nowadays this is the very best hotel in Barcelona with a lot of differece from its competitors.

The best is the design, it is really an outstanding proposal for any kind of traveller (business, family, friends)

It has also a cosy restaurant inside with a perfect menu; far away from traditional hotel food you can have a very nice dinner.

I am sure it will become the most demanded hotel in BCN.

Congrats to the hotel",5,2019,10,25
49,Perfect dinner in an amazing place ,"If you‚Äôre looking for a comfortable place in the middle of the city and also you‚Äôre a food lover , that‚Äôs the one !

We tried several dishes , all of them super good . Special mention to ‚Äúarroz negro‚Äù. 

The service was incredible, always helpful and nice . 

The restaurant have a very good light , which , combined with the soft music sound, makes your night even better (if possible).

We‚Äôve spent a good night in family.

After dinner , one of the manager showed up us the whole place paying much attention to the details .

I really recommend Seventy Hotel, thanks for all !",5,2019,10,24
49,Great Dinner in the heart of Barcelona,"I live in Barcelona, so usually I¬¥m never tempeted by the idea of eating in hotels; I always thought it was aimed  for tourists and that you would never get the real deal.

Las Monday I was invited by a friend and to my surprise we had an amazing time, the food was incredible and above all the service was warm and welcoming. 

We shared a few tapas and salads; and I must say the burrata was mindblowing and the boletus croquetas delicious! 

   We also tried a dish of mushrooms with pork and egg that amazed both of us! Despite being a hotel restaurant, we didnt get that feeling at all. The space was very inviting and open, and I will  definitley go back!",5,2019,10,23
49,Really good hotel in a great part of Barcelona,"My stay was very very nice. It's an upscale hotel with a very professional and upbeat staff. The room gets an A+ for being extremely clean, incredibly comfortable, and heavenly to relax in. The extensive breakfast is a great deal, opt for it. I am not being paid to say this, I really enjoyed my stay.",5,2019,10,22
49,Amazing hotel!! ,"This new Barcelona hotel is simply AMAZING! The hotel in itself is so beautiful, the decor and design is just stunning! Rooms are pretty, spacious and confortable, including cool features like integrated bluetooth speakers, electric window blinds and more. Everyone from the staff is lovely, they made us feel right at home the minute we walked in. Breakfast and food overall is delicious. Location is simply ideal, close to the action yet peaceful and quiet when you need it - perfect balance! They have a beautiful spa with an indoor pool and sauna and an outdoor pool will open next spring. We stayed for 5 nights and enjoyed every second of it. Thank you for such an amazing stay!",5,2019,10,22
49,I can't speak highly enough of the staff and hotel,"Joel and Ophelia at the front desk were extremely helpful and friendly!  Very clean hotel, comfortable and spacious rooms, with top notch service!  I'd definitely recommend booking a stay when you visit Barcelona!",5,2019,10,21
49,AMAZING THE GEM OF BARCELONA,"We arrived at Seventy purely by chance after checking in at the hovel we had been booked into by our incompetent travel company!! We were downcast and literally seeking solice...... WELL WELL WELL what an absolute find! Had last minute availability for us and upon setting foot in the door the glorious smell in the reception area to the smiles on all the staff's faces it was a delight!! The lady on reception was amazing as we literally reserved on booking.com and hailed a cab to get there our booking hadnt yet come through but she took all the details needed and didnt delay our check in.  We were given two welcome drink tokens and offered all the information on the amenities and thankfully the access to the spa.  After our trip being more stressful than planned due to the protests and then the hovel we needed to unwind.  The hotel just had the most relaxed vibe with the jazz music playing through the speakers and lift, then to our room the corridors were plush with felt and the gorgeous blue carpets which you would be hard pushed to find a spec of dirt or dust.  We entered our gorgeous room with its crisp white linen, bouncy cloud beds and the cleanliness desired by all.  We had robes, slippers and lovely soft towels.  The added bonus you have big offerings of Shampoo, Conditioner and shower gel all in the spacious and bright shower.  We headed down to the spa after finding some food locally and it was the perfect balance of R & R.  We were even lucky enough to be able to book spa treatments for that evening, I enjoyed a facial and massage and my friend a balancing facial.  The treatments where of some of the highest quality I have had in various spas and they use Rituals products.  I felt completely revitalised after the treatment and we headed up to our room to settle in for the evening.  Only downside I would say which is very minor is the lack of English channels on the TV especially given the situation over the weekend with the rioting, it would have been nice to have been able to watch something light hearted and in english instead of just news.  All in all though Seventy was a Gem of a find and if we return to Barcelona will be the only place I am looking to stay again!",5,2019,10,21
49,my visit starts from 9th till 18th of October,"perfect location, stuff, rooms

I had to walk through the Catalonia protests to get there, so the stylish hotel was a welcomed surprise.",5,2019,10,20
49,Lovely hotel and staff,"Came for a short break with my daughter. Hotel is stunning and staff couldn't have been more helpful (particularly as there were demonstrations going on at the time and they suggested areas to visit to avoid blocked roads and demos). I had booked via expedia and requested a hotel with an outdoor pool so was disappointed when I found out the outside area isn't actually completed yet.  However the staff were so nice on email that I didn't change hotels in the end and I'm glad that I didn't . The spa pool is lovely and the bedrooms are spacious and very cool (the TV is enormous!) . Breakfast was delicious. Thanks to all at Seventy for a lovely stay.

49,A real welcome ,"We really enjoyed our 3 nights at Seventy. When we arrived after a difficult trip, the hotel lobby was busy with other guests. But instead of letting us wait, we were offered a free drink at their cosy bar. The open lobby with bar and restaurant is very beautifull. In the evening they did a free wine tasting, a nice way to meet other people!

The rooms are clean, modern and spacious with really good beds and a great shower. We only missed a second sink in the bathroom. We also tried out the new spa, small but very nice.

The location is very convenient, close to the metro, with lot of shops, bars and restaurants nearby.

Because this hotel just opened previous month, the staff is still training themselves, but they do know the word hospitality and do it with a smile. Much appreciated!",5,2019,10,18

A very, very special mention to all of the staff from the front desk to the spa and especially the F&B crew. Even though they‚Äôve only been working there for two weeks, have been professional, incredibly helpful, very warm and welcoming and actually nothing short of incredible.

49,Just wonderful!!,"The Seventy Hotel is a paradise in the middle of Barcelona - everything stands for relaxation before and after a day of sightseeing: a wonderful breakfast indoors or outdoors with fountain splashing, pleasant peace everywhere, a small but fine rooftop pool and really great and well insulated rooms. In fact, everything is as the pictures promise. And last but not least, the incredibly friendly staff is to be mentioned at every point who will gladly fulfill any wish:-) We will come back!!",5,2024,08,01
49,Buffet inolvidable en The patio,"I would like to express my gratitude and satisfaction for the magnificent experience we experienced when celebrating our wedding at this hotel. We opted for the finger buffet menu and added a few extras, and could not be happier with the choice. 

From the beginning, Laia and Mart√≠ gave us impeccable management, making sure that every detail was perfectly organized.

We would especially like to congratulate Juanjo and his team for their outstanding work. All guests were delighted with the quality of the buffet, which exceeded our expectations in both quantity, variety and taste, as well as perfectly adapted to food allergies and intolerances. In addition, the patio space is very nice, creating a charming and welcoming atmosphere that contributed to make our day unforgettable.

Thank you for making our wedding a memorable event. We would recommend this hotel without hesitation.",5,2024,07,22

49,Spectacular hotel,"A spectacular place with very good design. A beautiful hotel to go with friends or a partner and very quiet and with beautiful decorations.
Spectacular service.
The waiter Denis Pablo very good treatment and very good service.
I would repeat again.",5,2024,05,19
49,My experience at Seventy Barcelona,"My experience at Hotel Seventy Barcelona was much more than pleasant. The bedroom was spacious, well lit and the beds very comfortable. Regarding the hotel staff, they were all really friendly, √Ångel was very attentive.
The location of the hotel is very good, close to the Gothic quarter, the coast and the Sagrada Familia basilica, etc.",5,2024,05,16
49,A nice place with small flaws.,"The setting and architecture of the hotel is very beautiful, a spacious, lively and interesting place in an excellent area of Barcelona, connected to nearby areas of interest within a short distance.

I stayed within the same week on two occasions, therefore two different rooms; The first two nights were in a room that they upgraded me at no additional cost, a very comfortable room with a private terrace, a bathroom with double sinks, a bathtub and a dressing room, quite comfortable.

Later I went to another city, returning three days later, on that occasion the hotel already had an event so it was almost 100% occupied; The room was of a lower standard, very nice, a sink, normal shower, a small desk and the bed; This second time there were some damages in the room, the shower was covered so the water was puddled; the sink did not close the water well and dripped for a period of almost 10 minutes always after using it, only one flush button worked on the toilet; Leaving a lot to be desired compared to the first room.

The service in the hotel restaurant, almost like most service quality in Spain, is basic and somewhat grudging; It could be that in my country the attention is always spectacular.

The hotel has parking which makes your stay very comfortable and easy.

I don't have an opinion about the pool and/or spa since I didn't use it.

Would I go back? Definitely yes; It is a very good place despite a slight average experience in the second stay.",4,2024,05,12
49,More appearance than substance,"Positive: Spacious rooms, comfortable beds, stylish ambience of the hotel, good location

Negative: Rooms cannot be ventilated, staff EXTREMELY unfriendly, breakfast offering at the level of a three star hotel: hardly any selection of sausage and cheese, no warm desserts, hardly any fresh fruit, dry cakes, self-service coffee machine (absolutely for a 4 star superior hotel not acceptable), limescale stains in the shower, room service sometimes only available at 3 p.m
All in all, we unfortunately didn't feel comfortable, mainly because of the very unfriendly staff who didn't greet you and radiated a listlessness. In addition, it was not possible to pay at check out, even though it was promised to me that way. Either it is due to the staff's poor English skills or the lack of guest orientation.
Unfortunately, I cannot recommend the Hotel Seventy and I cannot understand why this hotel was given a 4 star S rating. Find another hotel in Barcelona that offers better value for money and doesn't come with empty promises.
We won't be coming back!",2,2024,03,30
49,Fantastic snack with friends!,"Thank Lorena for her recommendations to snack with friends in the bar area. The croquettes and the Russian salad are 100% recommended. The super attentive restaurant team and the cocktail maker Alberto made us laugh a lot.

I used the pool (very clean and tidy) and had both a couples massage and a facial, truly exceptional.
I also used both the restaurant and the cocktail bar, the restaurant is very nice, the food is very good and the staff is very attentive to the customer and prepared, while at the cocktail bar I wanted to applaud the professionalism of Alberto and Carlos who made us dream with their magnificent cocktails but above all with their smile and the passion they put into it, truly excellent.

The rooms are simply stunning, offering spaciousness, comfort and a special touch that made our stay unforgettable. But what really left us speechless was my birthday weekend. The hotel was transformed into a scene of surprises! From a personalized note to a delicious piece of cake in the room, every detail helped make my birthday even more special.

I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel again and again; In fact, I have already recommended it to all my friends. This is definitely the place I want to return to on my next vacation in Barcelona. I sincerely appreciate the warm welcome, kindness and extra effort that made our stay more than perfect. simply thanks!",5,2023,12,27
49,Pros and cons,"The Spa is accessible upon reservation for only 1 hour per day. We discovered this on site and it was not specified anywhere on the site. Furthermore, they say the indoor pool is 34 degrees, but in reality it is much colder. Having chosen this hotel mainly for the presence of the Spa, this left us a little taken aback. Sauna and Turkish bath ok, even if the shower was missing in the Turkish bath at the end of the plastic tube, it still worked, but in a 4 star you don't expect that. There are no bidets in the rooms and we had to request an additional towel for intimate hygiene and spare toilet paper twice. Also, the blue velvet bar drawer in the room had some dust and we asked for it to be cleaned. Rather small room, business hotel, comfortable bed, although despite having specifically requested it at the time of booking we found two single mattresses pushed together instead of a single double mattress. The shower did not drain water well and we asked for assistance, a technician was only available from the next morning. However, a strategic position for visiting the main attractions of the city in one of the areas considered the most high-end for quality of life. Metro and buses close and convenient. Given the season we did not make use of the outdoor swimming pool on the roof and the sun loungers, which is a shame because the area seems very well looked after. Good buffet breakfast, fresh products, not excessive choice. Very welcoming common spaces for working even from the hotel, pleasant evenings of live music. A fall in style for the books in the enormous scenic library which, unfortunately, are all fake and not available for consultation. Very kind and attentive staff, availability for luggage storage before departure. Around the hotel there are several restaurants and bars.",3,2023,12,26
49,Disappointing,"It was the fourth time I stayed here but it will also be the last because I found a clear deterioration in quality and customer care. The reception was exaggeratedly slow. ..at the exit they got the bill wrong...dirty rooms, without bathrobes (I had to request them)...destroyed shower head that leaked water in spurts. .the icing on the cake is sparkling water for a fee at breakfast where you already pay a supplement of 19 euros... customer care? none!",2,2023,12,26
49,Fatal! Nul Horrible!! Worse than bad....disappointing,"Fatal! Nul Horrible!! a disastrous and painful experience. It was terrible. All wrong. Everything was horrible and awful. Don't dare to go. Not offered a qulify service, the noisy and bad quality not deserve for price",1,2023,12,22
49,Magnificent place in Barcelona to celebrate a company event,Excellent treatment and great professionalism when helping you organize a company event. Rooms with natural light that open onto a patio in Eixample with a garden and outdoor tables. Good location with parking space in the same hotel. The Christmas menu is of great quality. Every year we repeat our company's Christmas meal with more than 50 guests. I have also been to an anniversary celebration. Very good quality/price ratio and in which they take great care of noting the possible allergies that each dish may contain.,5,2023,12,14
49,Company food,"We have had the company meal and everything was great,

The rooms, simply spectacular! Spacious, comfortable and with that special touch that made our stay more than memorable. But what left us speechless was my birthday weekend. The hotel became a scene of surprises! From a personalized note to a small piece of cake with a candle placed in the room, every detail made my birthday even more special.

There is no doubt, I would recommend this hotel a thousand times. In fact, I have already recommended it to all my loved ones.

49,One step away from excellence!,"Beautiful facilities with a very good price/value ratio, a spectacularly designed lobby integrated with the bar.

49,Amazing,"We arrived at the hotel and they gave us the surprise of being able to enjoy a duplex suite, when our reservation was only for a single room, it was fantastic, however we could not use the spa, we saw that it was recommended in different guides. For the next one??",5,2023,11,12

49,Well located restaurant for celebrations,"Restaurant located inside the Seventy hotel. Good value for money. The menu selection is decent with quality dishes. It has an outdoor patio with olive trees that cannot be accessed at night. Fast and friendly service. It is advisable to reserve in advance. They give you one hour of parking in the same building. We ordered some hors d'oeuvres to share, a main dish and dessert. The truffle risotto was delicious. The grilled beef entrec√¥te was on point. Accompanying sides include French fries, steamed vegetables, rosemary roasted potatoes, and cabbage and carrot salad. The most recommended desserts are cheesecake and dark chocolate, hazelnut and Baileys truffles. Recommended for special occasions such as birthdays and celebrations.",3,2023,11,02
49,sadly wrong,"This terrace bar is located inside the Seventy hotel. The truth is that the hotel, hall, bar hall, lounge, is wonderful in terms of decoration. At the end of the route we find the PATIO. Terrace with olive trees, hardly any light, bad service, slow, not very attentive, so much so that we decided to leave without dinner...
The truth is that it tasted bad to us, although for our taste we did not find the menu excessively suggestive or excessively logical, we intended to have dinner, but we decided to leave because we saw that we would not end up well served or seeing what we had for dinner.
My grade, maximum 3 out of 10.

49,Un'esperienza da ripetere,"Il Seventy Barcelona √® un hotel impeccabile sotto ogni punto di vista nonch√© in tutto e per tutto corrispondente alle foto e alle descrizioni presenti sul sito web. 
In generale, la posizione dell‚Äôhotel √® ottimale in quanto, pur essendo vicinissimo ad ogni punto di interesse (siamo praticamente all‚Äôincrocio tra la Diagonal e il Passeig de Gr√†cia) si situa tuttavia in una zona pi√π defilata, al riparo dal traffico e dalla confusione delle vie principali.
Le camere sono dotate di tutti gli accessori utili ad un soggiorno confortevole (prodotti di cortesia, phon e piastra, biancheria di qualit√†, variet√† di cuscini etc.) oltre ad essere nuovissime ed arredate con gusto e funzionalit√†. La tecnologia √® semplice ed intuitiva, la pulizia sempre perfetta.
Noi abbiamo alloggiato in una lounge terrace room con uno spazio esterno che affaccia su una corte interna, ed √® quindi molto tranquillo. Questa tipologia di camera si trova al primo piano.
La colazione √® eccellente, con prodotti freschi e di qualit√† (anche biologici e vegani).  Il pane √® sempre fragrante, le spremute fresche e, per chi le gradisce, le uova vengono preparate sul momento. Abbiamo trovato i dolci ‚Äúhome made‚Äù veramente deliziosi.
Per chi lo desidera √® anche possibile pranzare o cenare in hotel. La carta √® essenziale ma adeguata.
Dato il poco tempo a disposizione, non abbiamo provato la piscina all‚Äôaperto n√© la s.p.a. ma si tratta di servizi che indubbiamente completano l‚Äôofferta dell‚Äôhotel.
Infine, lo staff.  √à composto da persone giovani, affabili e sempre sorridenti. 
Indubbiamente, come altri viaggiatori hanno detto, √® un hotel in cui si ha voglia di tornare e che sar√† ormai il nostro punto di riferimento per i prossimi soggiorni a Barcellona

49,Un felice compleanno a Barcellona,"Abbiamo scelto questo albergo per le ottime recensioni ma quello che abbiamo trovato √® andato ben oltre le aspettative. Un hotel da 4 stelle che ne merita 6! Piu che un hotel √® una esperienza! La struttura ti offre davvero tutto dalla Spa (gratuita) alla piscina coperta, al ristorante e ai salottini con musica dal vivo e bar. La pulizia √® impeccabile e l'arredo √® ricercato nei minimi dettagli. Un albergo nuovo ed elegante dove non √® stato lasciato nulla al caso. Le camere sono ampie ed insonorizzate e, per la gioia di noi donne, viene fornita addirittura la piastra per capelli! Colazione ottima ed abbondante con chef che preparano al momento. Il personale √® altamente professionale e gentile. Un complimento speciale va a Boris che, saputo del mio compleanno, ha organizzato insieme al barman una piccola sorpresa con tanto di candeline. Ed ha fatto s√¨ che potessimo vedere una partita di calcio italiano! Altrettanto professionali Alessandra e Param della reception. Inoltre la posizione √® strategica, a pochi passi dalla metro e in una zona tranquilla ma piena di ristoranti! Non vediamo l'ora di tornare a farci coccolare al Seventy!! ",5,2023,04,04
49,Best people ever,"Hotel moderno y muy bien pensado. Los espacios son amplios y agradables. Excelente comida (recomiendo el risoto de trufas). Desayuno fresco con muchas opciones. Habitaciones amplias, camas confortables, ba√±o estupendo con todo lo que necesitas para una estancia c√≥moda. Pero lo de mejor que hay en Seventy Barcelona es la gente que ah√≠ trabaja y que hace sentirte en casa!
Un saludo especial a Valeria, Param y √Ångel, siempre atentos, sonrientes y simp√°ticos.
Y gracias a Borja por el mejor mojito! 
Hasta pronto.

49,Visita por recomendaci√≥n,"He calificado una experiencia 5/5 por varios motivos, aunque otros no incumben a la restauraci√≥n, que es el servicio que hemos ido a probar.

La decoraci√≥n es espectacularmente cuidada, unas tonalidades muy bien encajadas. La entrada te da una visi√≥n di√°fana del bar, restaurante y al fondo un patio. Tiene un aspecto de crucero unos colores met√°licos cobrizos y azules marinos. 

Nos recibido el maitre y nos ofreci√≥ una mesa muy c√≥moda. Con una visual pr√°cticamente entera desde nuestra ubicaci√≥n de la entrada y bar.

Pedimos cosas para compartir. Las raciones no son muy grandes, pero se pueden considerar como platos principales algunos de ellos. El risotto es espectacular, presentaci√≥n sencilla pero un sabor sorprendentemente bueno. La sopa de cebolla, esperaba encontrarme texturas de cebolla flotan en su interior, pero el horno josper hace su trabajo d√°ndole ese toque ahumado. 

El maitre (el de Menorca) nos recomend√≥ varias referencias a consumir y la verdad que fue un acierto. El servicio ha sido r√°pido y eficaz.

He echado en falta que la carta presente los iconos de los 14 al√©rgenos obligatorios, aunque yo sea al√©rgico a las nueces me han preguntado si era al√©rgico a algo en concreto, para poder avisar a cocina. Muy bien la verdad. 

Pedios una tarta de queso, que me gust√≥ el sabor, pero no entend√≠ muy bien la cremada de az√∫car‚Ä¶ en mi opini√≥n le quita protagonismo al sabor del queso. Aunque si, estaba muy rica.

La m√∫sica, hilo musical‚Ä¶ te hace tener una m√∫sica muy confortable. Me gust√≥ mucho la diversidad de uniforme entre los empleados, la aceptaci√≥n por parte de la empresa de que los empleados tenga su propio aspecto f√≠sico. Cuid√°ndolo te da una cercan√≠a con la sociedad actual muy acertada.

Si tuviera que poner alg√∫n pero, la estancia es algo fr√≠a, las puerta de entrada del lobby, se abren constantemente y al tener el gran ventanal del patio se siente una brisa que no deja temperarse. Quiz√°s poniendo una cortina de aire en la entrada conseguir√°n mantener la temperatura del espacio. 

Es un lugar que seguramente volver√© y recomendar√©, me ha encantado como para desconectar del bullicio de la ciudad y adem√°s el patio es digno de disfrutarlo cuando haga mejor tiempo. 

Much√≠simas gracias a Marc, por su servicio y su amabilidad. Y gracias a Seventy por hacer de este d√≠a un buen d√≠a.",5,2023,01,22

49,Experiencia lamentable,"Un c√∫mulo de malas actuaciones hace q mi puntuaci√≥n sea 1. Primero: y a pesar de realizarse en una convenci√≥n del grupo al que pertenecemos, al hacer el checking, nos dan una habitaci√≥n destinada a minusv√°lidos. Eso quiere decir que en el ba√±o no hay ning√∫n tipo de obst√°culo, por lo que solo hay la pieza del vater, la pieza del lavabo, y una ducha con cortina a ras de suelo (inundaci√≥n la primera noche que me ducho). No hay d√≥nde poner el neceser las cosas de aseo, ya que no hay ning√∫n mueble. 
Segundo: al hablar con los otros compa√±eros del grupo que tambi√©n est√°n hospedados. Nos enteramos de que nuestra habitaci√≥n es la √∫nica que es as√≠ por lo que vamos a pedir un cambio de habitaci√≥n. En recepci√≥n nos dicen que no tienen ninguna habitaci√≥n libre. Hablamos con la persona representante del grupo y MILAGROSAMENTE aparece en una habitaci√≥n vac√≠a. No nos dan tiempo para realizar el cambio de forma ordenada, por lo que nos dejamos unas cuantas cosas en la habitaci√≥n antigua, entre ellas una bolsa t√©rmica de farmacia con medicaci√≥n dentro de la nevera. Tercero: al solicitar que nos d√© m√°s tiempo para realizar el cambio de habitaci√≥n, ya que tenemos actividades durante la ma√±ana, nos dicen que es imposible porque la habitaci√≥n va a ser ocupada esa misma ma√±ana. 
Cuarto: al solicitar si han encontrado la bolsa de la farmacia en la nevera de la habitaci√≥n anterior nos dicen que no hab√≠a nada, solicito a la persona de recepci√≥n ver si puedo revisarlo yo y incre√≠blemente la habitaci√≥n est√° limpia y apunto de que entre alguien. Me dice la chica de recepci√≥n que hab√≠a estado reservada, pero no se hab√≠a presentado el cliente‚Ä¶ YA!
Quinto: al hacer el checkOut nos dicen que debemos pagar tres d√≠as de parking y uno de desayuno, cuando nosotros hab√≠amos llegado a Barcelona en avi√≥n y el desayuno estaba incluido con la habitaci√≥n reservada por el grupo.
Tanto el recepcionista como el director del Hotel (llamada posterior) se disculparon. Solicitando ambos qu√© pod√≠an hacer para resarcir ese c√∫mulo de torpezas. Evidentemente, ya no pod√≠an hacer nada porque me marchaba del Hotel y de Barcelona. 
Adjunto foto de la hoja de reclamaci√≥n con el sello del Hotel para que ve√°is que no me inventado nada si",1,2022,10,09
49,Tolles Hotel und toller Service,"Wir haben zwei N√§chte in diesem Hotel verbracht, eine Nacht vor unserer Mittelmeer Kreuzfahrt und eine Nacht danach. Das Hotel ist in einer sch√∂nen Gegend gelegen, in der N√§he vieler Sehensw√ºrdigkeiten. 
F√ºr die erste √úbernachtung hatten wir einen Sky Room gebucht, welches ein sehr sch√∂nes und ger√§umiges  Zimmer auf der obersten Etage mit Blick auf den ruhigen Innenhof war. 
Bei der zweiten √úbernachtung gab man uns ein kostenloses Upgrade auf eine wundersch√∂ne extravagante riesige Suite √ºber zwei Etagen mit Kamin, Esszimmer und freistehender Badewanne! Unglaublich sch√∂n!
Einziges Manko war, dass wir das Zimmer erst um ca. 15.30 Uhr beziehen konnten, obwohl man uns dies schon zwei Stunden eher zugesagt hatte, aber die sch√∂ne Suite machte dies wieder wett und zus√§tzlich brachte man uns noch eine Flasche Wein zur Entsch√§digung. 
Das Hotel selbst ist in allen Bereichen sehr modern und jung eingerichtet. Wir haben gerne in dem dazugeh√∂rigen Patio drau√üen gegessen, wundersch√∂n zwischen B√§umen und sehr Corona konform, da man drau√üen war. 
Das Essen war sehr lecker und preislich absolut in Ordnung. 
Da wir mit dem Auto in Barcelona waren, hatten wir die M√∂glichkeit in dem dazugeh√∂rigen Parkhaus nebenan f√ºr 20‚Ç¨ / Nacht zu parken, was sehr bequem war.
Das junge Team, das in dem Hotel arbeitet, ist sehr serviceorientiert und sehr engagiert und bem√ºht, alle W√ºnsche zu erf√ºllen. Wir waren begeistert.

49,no fue lo que esperaba,"Tenia muchas expectativas por lo que hab√≠a le√≠do sin embargo no me encanto.Su dise√±o es hermoso y la ubicaci√≥n es buena pero la actitud en el servicio de algunos de sus empleados nos decepciono, tanto en la recepci√≥n como en el desayuno.
Para empezar pedi un cuarto seventy que en la descripci√≥n del cuarto dec√≠a que eran 28 mts. y seg√∫n las fotos era mas amplio de lo que realmente fue.He viajado mucho y justo venia de un viaje en diversas partes de Europa y los cuartos con medias similares eran grandes nada que ver con el tama√±o del seventy, bastante peque√±o.
Al reservar no me fije que no ofrec√≠a pantuflas ni bata de ba√±o pregunte por ellas pero nos dijeron que no nos daban, le faltaban peque√±os detalles en el ba√±o como la gorra de ba√±o, algod√≥n, lima de u√±as.
la regadera muy impracticabilidades pues se le sal√≠a el agua y se empapaba el tapete asi que hab√≠a que ponerlo lejos para evitar salir y tener un tapete mojado.
El dia de salida desde la noche anterior marcamos a recepci√≥n para pedir late check out y nos dijeron que nos dir√≠an al d√≠a siguiente  y nos encontramos con un NO, sin embargo vimos como hicieron late check out dos diferentes hu√©spedes, la verdad nos molesto much√≠simo.
En fin varios detalles que nos dejaron no satisfechas a pesar de ser bonito hotel.",3,2022,06,23
49,FORMIDABLE!,"Ya en el hall de entrada te das cuenta que no est√°s ante cualquier hotel. Cuidad√≠sima decoraci√≥n, ambientes muy pensados para el confort del hu√©sped y un servicio muy atento, amable y eficaz.
Las habitaciones no desentonan, una TV enorme, una c√≥moda cama y un ba√±o bien equipado para hacer la estancia c√≥moda.
Con la habitaci√≥n regalaban media hora de SPA que pudimos disfrutar solos , previa reserva, y que nos hizo pasar un gran momento de relax y desconexi√≥n.
Tambi√©n pudimos ver una estupenda terraza con piscina en el √°tico con buen ambiente.

49,Absolutes Highlight in Barcelona,"Ich bin eine Spanien-Kennerin und habe in diesem Land auch sechs Jahre gewohnt. Das Seventy √ºberragt den durchschnittlichen Hotelstandard um ein Vielfaches. Die Lage ist sensationell, die Metro-Station Diagonal nur gerade zwei Gehminuten von der Unterkunft entfernt. Vom Hotel aus sind die wichtigsten Sehensw√ºrdigkeiten fussl√§ufig zu erreichen. Die Sagrada Familia ist gerade einmal einen Katzensprung von 15 Min. entfernt. Die Zimmer sind modern und stilvoll eingerichtet und haben viele Steckdosen/Anschl√ºsse f√ºr portable Ger√§te. Obwohl sich das Hotel mitten in der Stadt befindet, ist es sehr gut schallisoliert, sodass man in den Zimmern keinerlei Immissionen hat. Auch die Klimaanlage ist sehr leise. Ganz besonders gefallen hat uns der Rooftop-Pool und auch der wunderbare Innenpool. Das Fr√ºhst√ºck war f√ºr spanische Verh√§ltnisse absolut top, insbesondere die vielf√§ltigen Eierspeisen. Am letzten Tag mussten wir fr√ºh zum Flughafen und konnten am Fr√ºhst√ºcksbuffet ein paar Sachen holen, obwohl das Buffet noch gar nicht ge√∂ffnet war. Das nennt man Kundenfreundlichkeit! √úberhaupt ist das Personal nicht nur freundlich, sondern sehr herzlich. Das Einzige, was man aussetzen k√∂nnte, ist, dass man sich beim Fr√ºhst√ºck den Kaffee selber an der Maschine holen muss, ansonsten ist alles perfekt.",5,2022,05,27

Der Rooftop-Pool und die entsprechende Terrasse sind eher klein und waren bei unserem Aufenthalt geschlossen (zu kalt). Im Sommer jedoch sicher ein super Platz zum verweilen.

Das Personal war immer freundlich und hilfsbereit. In der Lobby zieht es bei k√ºhlen Aussentemperaturen (10-13 Grad) deutlich, was einen Aufenthalt dort eher ungem√ºtlich macht.

Sobre la comida, recomendar absolutamente el risoto y el rabo de toro. Nosotras elegimos algunos platos para compartir y todo lo que probamos de la carta nos pareci√≥ exquisito, as√≠ que no puedes equivocarte.

Abbiamo scelto questo hotel basandoci sulle ottime recensioni, indecisi su un‚Äôaltro hotel molto vicino pari costo Seventy hotel ha vinto  per la presenza della Spa., mai scelta fu pi√π azzeccata, dopo una giornata a camminare per la citt√† una mezz‚Äôora tra sauna bagno turco e piscina tiepida ƒó stata davvero ristoratrice. Spa gestita molto bene per la sicurezza covid con entrata su prenotazione massino 3 coppie. Super pulita profumata e la piscina con base  di metallo ne garantisce la massima igiene. Noi abbiamo scelto la camera con terrazza situata al 1 piano. Stanza abbastanza grande letto h30 comodissimo (unica pecca il cuscino troppo alto ho faticato a dormire) tv enorme ma canali rai non funzionavano mai, il water intelligente con led notturno davvero spettacolare lo viglio anch io a casa!!! Box di prodotti tra cui spazzolini e dentifricio, crema mani e varie. Phon e piastra serviZio the e caff√® nespresso. Terrazza che essendo al primo piano non aveva vista sulla,citta ma sulla corte interna. Bisogna tenere sempre le imposte chiuse. Forse all ultimo piano questo problema non c‚Äôe.
Abbiamo usufruito della colazione solo un paio di volte. Direi colazione discreta.invece abbiamo pranzato e cenato una volta e siamo rimasti entusiasti. Pranzo veloce con prosciutto iberico patatine e pane e tomate tutto ottimo e cena sempre con il loro prosciutto poi un petto di pollo grigliato con pur√® buonissimo. I dettagli fanno la differenza, l‚Äôambiente e spettacolare, un caro saluto a Roberta che ci ha consigliati su cibo e altro. Complimenti super professionale. Comunque tutto il personale ƒó efficiente veloce giovane professionale, un grazie speciale ai ragazzi della reception che il pomeriggio del compleanno di mio marito ci hanno portato in stanza un vassoio con una fetta di torta e una bottiglia di buon vino bianco con tanto di auguri.",5,2021,10,30
49,"Hotel sorprendente en dise√±o, comodidad y calidad del personal","Un hotel realmente sorpr√©ndete por su imagen y dise√±o tan pensada en ofrecer al cliente un ambiente c√°lido y confortable, y sorprende tambi√©n por su gran calidad y servicio del personal. Uno cree que lo ha visto todo pero afortunadamente siempre te sorprenden. Un Hall del hotel que invita a sentarse y disfrutar de cada espacio, un restaurante amable y Mediterraneo con una comida excepcional (prob√© en la cena la ensalada de espinaca, aguacate, champi√±√≥n y bacon y las croquetas y todo buen√≠simo), unas habitaciones bonitas con una tele enorme y una cama enorme (vamos lo que queremos los clientes), rincones muy chulos para trabajar con el ordenador y un lavabo hecho con un gran gusto. Adem√°s tiene spa y gym que con el tema COVID tienes que elegir horarios pero que SI puedes utilizar, no como en muchos que sencillamente te deniegan el servicio con la excusa del COVID.
Enhorabuena al que ha dise√±ado este concepto de hotel. Sin duda volver√© y mirar√© donde m√°s tiene sede.",5,2021,10,26

49,Wundersch√∂nes Hotel an ausgezeichneter Lage ,"Wir waren durchwegs begeistert von diesem Hotel an ausgezeichneter Lage. Leider war unser Aufenthalt zu kurz, um das ganze Angebot (Spa, Schwimmbad) nutzen zu k√∂nnen. Das Personal an der Reception war ausserordentlich freundlich, kompetent und hilfsbereit. Das Fr√ºhst√ºck sehr umfangreich mit frisch zubereiteten Speisen. F√ºr EUR 19 pro √úbernachtung kann das Auto in der Tiefgarage parkiert werden. Das Design und die Einrichtung ist ganz nach unserem Geschmack. Excellentes Preis-Leistung Verh√§ltnis. Wir empfehlen das Hotel ohne Vorbehalt weiter! ",5,2021,10,21

49,THE Place to be in Barceloa,"Auf der Suche nach einer angenehmen Unterkunft in guter Lage in Barcelona habe ich MEIN perfektes Hotel gefunden: das Seventy Barcelona. Das Ambiente des Hotels, die Freundlichkeit des Personals, die tolle Ausstattung, all dies hat mich vollends √ºberzeugt, so dass ich es f√ºr unseren n√§chsten Aufenthalt vor Ort (mit der Familie) sofort wieder gebucht habe.
Die Zimmer (ich hatte einen Sky Room auf einer der oberen Etagen) sind stylish und hochwertig ausgestattet, von dem kleinen aber feinen Rooftop Pool hat man einen sch√∂nen Blick √ºber die Stadt bis hin zur Sagrada Familia und das Fr√ºhst√ºck im Innenhof unter Olivenb√§umen war eines der besten, die ich in einem Hotel dieser Kategorie je hatte.",5,2021,10,07
49,Klasse Hotel mit super Lage,"Wir haben hier einen sehr sch√∂nen Aufenthalt genossen. Entgegen anderen Hotels in Barcelona ist hier das Mobiliar sehr gepflegt, was aber auch daran liegen kann, dass das Hotel erst seit einem Jahr ge√∂ffnet ist. Alles ist sehr sauber und das Personal sehr nett. 
Die Lage ist sehr zentral und viel ist zu Fu√ü zu erreichen. Trotzdem war es sehr ruhig in den Zimmern.
Der Pool auf dem Dach ist super und das Spa ist wunderbar ruhig und entspannend.
Wir hoffen der Standard bleibt auch √ºber die n√§chsten Jahre erhalten, denn wir kommen gerne wieder.",5,2021,10,02

49,OASIS URBANO,"Vas a Barcelona y encuentras este hotel en la reserva. Piensas: ""urbano, c√©ntrico, dicen que silencioso... probaremos"", mientras albergas el temor de que sea lo de siempre y acabes sufriendo los inconvenientes que te has encontrado veces anteriores.

La primera experiencia agradable est√° en el check-in, donde adem√°s de la amabilidad del recepcionista nos hace una r√°pida gesti√≥n para atender una demanda que tal vez con la habitaci√≥n solicitada pod√≠a no satisfacerse. Ah√≠ empiezan a ganarte porque considero que eso es lo que se llama servicio, buscar tu satisfacci√≥n hasta d√≥nde lleguen sus posibilidades.

La estancia fue exquisita, genial en todo. El trato con la gente, la INSONORIZACI√ìN, las almohadas (lo siento pero el descanso es el top en mi rango de valoraci√≥n); el ambiente... Incluso la playlist.

En definitiva peque√±os detalles que acaban por hacer un gran hotel, el cual figura en el n¬∫ 1 de los sitios a los cuales acudir cuando vuelva a Barcelona, porque cuando haces el check-out, el inter√©s por el feedback, sus comentarios y ofrecimientos para cuando vuelvas hacen que te vayas a√∫n con una mejor sensaci√≥n.",5,2021,07,06
49,Un hotel maravilloso,"Breves vacaciones con mi hija de 18 a√±os. El Hotel Seventy es realmente hermoso. Nuevo, luminoso, con una decoraci√≥n moderna y elegante, ubicaci√≥n inmejorable, a dos pasos de Avenida Diagnal y Passeig de Gracia.

49,Albergo nuovissimo,"Abbiamo dormito una notte in questo hotel di passaggio a Barcellona. L‚Äôalbergo √® nuovissimo, arredato in stile moderno, con una hall veramente spettacolare con soffitti alti ed una libreria che li raggiunge. Molto molto belle anche le camere anche se non grandissime. Doccia invece molto grande. Il bagno √® fornito di tutto il necessaire, vi sono anche il phon e addirittura la piastra per lisciare i capelli. Il frigo bar √® assai fornito, con bevande analcoliche e alcoliche e snack dolci e salati. Smart TV enorme. Presenti in albergo anche la spa ed sul tetto una piscina con lettini per prendere il sole. La colazione era abbonante ma i prodotti da forno pochi. Personale giovane e assai cordiale. Prezzi in linea per un albergo quattro stelle.",5,2020,07,02

49,Me sent√≠ como en casa,"He visitado varias veces el Hotel Seventy y siempre me ha hecho sentir como si estuviera en casa, el trato es excelente, se respira una atm√≥sfera tranquila y mediterranea. Puedes ir a tomar algo con amigos dentro de sus muchas actividades que realizan a diario, o ir a relajarte a su Spa totalmente vegano y org√°nico,...una delicia. El restaurante lo recomiendo por la calidad de su producto y sus recetas saludables...pero sobre todo destado la amabilidad de todo su personal. Volver√© sin duda",5,2020,03,11
49,Un hotel maravilloso,"Han sido unos d√≠as maravillosos en este hotel. Las habitaciones son perfectas, las instalaciones preciosas y el personal fant√°stico. Muy muy recomendable, volver√© con toda seguridad. Recomiendo las habitaciones con terraza, un lujazo",5,2020,03,09

49,Super nuevo,Muy nuevo todo y con musica en directo. Los cocktails muy buenos tambi√©n pero la carta no se lee por el dise√±o de colores que le han puesto. Hab√≠a una pantalla muy grande de TV donde se pasaban videos,4,2020,02,15
49,Na ja,"Sch√∂nes neues Hotel. Stylisch gut gemacht, ordentliche Materialien verwendet. Alle sehr freundlich und bem√ºht, jedoch kein wirklich guter Service. Hinweise (Beispiel: kein Baden m√∂glich, da Abflussstopfen fehlt), werden freundlichst entgegengenommen, aber eine Abhilfe erfolgt nicht. Zimmer sind optisch sch√∂n, aber nicht zweckm√§√üig eingerichtet, z.B. Gibt es keinen Platz zum unterstellen leerer Koffer. Kleiderschrank f√ºr zwei Personen zu klein. Badewanne ist lediglich zum sitzen geeignet. Essen ist genie√übar, aber nicht wirklich schmackhaft. Fr√ºhst√ºck eher einfach. Alles in allem: kann man machen, wer aber zufriedenstellenden Service liebt, sollte sich vom stylisch jugendlichen Image nicht blenden lassen und sich fern halten.",3,2020,02,15

49,Ya hay parking,"Se nos presenta viaje puntual y por evento en pleno meollo de la gran metr√≥poli. Optamos por la soluci√≥n m√°s c√≥moda y, (pese a tantas otras enojosas decepciones), volvemos a confiar en el criterio de Tripadvisor, pero cruzando los datos, mucho. √önico inconveniente seg√∫n se refleja en todas partes, el parking.
Para nuestra sorpresa tanto lo material como lo humano han superado expectativas,  nos llevamos una gran experiencia. Por eso aprovecho para mostrar mi agradecimiento ahora que a√∫n no tenemos constancia de que la criminalizaci√≥n por el uso del veh√≠culo propio haya tenido consecuencias. Esperamos repetir pronto si el valor lo permite, si no cuando las infraestructuras para los no hist√≥ricos est√©n operativas.
Tips:
1. Usando Parkapp he encontrado a 600m.  24h. por 14‚Ç¨.
2. Para dormir: quitando la tarjeta de la entrada se acaba con el molesto circo de luces al que muchos se refieren con raz√≥n.
3. A la salida el joven de recepci√≥n me dice que s√≠ que hay parking desde la semana pasada y gratis, de momento.",4,2020,02,04

Riduttivo chiamarlo soltanto hotel. Uno spazio accogliente a 360¬∞! 
Nulla lasciato al caso e non soltanto nella scelta degli arredi. Spazi per il co-working studiati nei minimi dettagli per dare il giusto comfort.
Dotato di un bellissimo e fornitissimo bar, una palestra ben attrezzata, una spa molto accogliente (particolare menzione per i 'rituali' offerti). Personale molto gentile e disponibile (un piccolo misunderstanding sulla pulizia della camera, superato e risolto grazie alla loro disponibilit√†).

La opci√≥n de tomar el desayuno es muy conveniente,  considerando la variedad de opciones del buffet. Lo que m√°s destac√≥ es la calidez del personal,  sin duda ello me har√° volver y recomendarlos.

49,!!! Lo mejor que he probado!!! Gracias equipo!!,"Nada m√°s poner un pie dentro y es sentirte en casa!!

Entras y ya te reciben con una sonrisa inmensa.El Staff te contagia de una energ√≠a ( que luego al conocer a Victor y a Daniel entiendes el porqu√© de ello). 

El dise√±o,los muebles,la decoraci√≥n y todo lo que envuelve el entorno del hotel nos hizo sentir una energ√≠a de lo m√°s agradable.
Las instalaciones son exuberantes y fascinantes, pero con una calidez de !!hogar dulce hogar!!!
Nada pasa desapercibido, materiales muy buenos ‚Äú‚Äùcasi tanto como su gente‚Äù‚Äù.

El desayuno estaba de vici√≥, como dice alguien que seguro todos conocemos ‚Äúrico rico‚Äù.
Mi mujer sonre√≠a sin tener que decir mucho m√°s acerca de lo que sent√≠a disfrutando de ese desayuno sin igual. Mientras tanto el enano y pr√≠ncipe de la casa se hac√≠a unas  series corriendo desde el comedor hasta la sala de cine, disfrutando del rebote que da la madera y ante la atenta mirada c√≥mplice de las chicas del Staff!!! 

Podr√≠a estar relatando durante muchas l√≠neas m√°s, lo bien que nos sentimos mi familia y yo en ese hotel!!
Pero nada de eso habr√≠a significado lo que fue  sin ti ni tu equipo ‚Äú Victor‚Äù y es que, ‚Äú detr√°s de un buen hotel se esconde el activo m√°s valioso, y es su capital humano‚Äù‚Äù.

Gracias Victor  por tu energ√≠a,saber hacer, respeto,dedicaci√≥n y sobretodo hacernos sentir en casa y muy bien acompa√±ados de tu extraordinario staff.
Nos veremos  sin duda muy pronto de nuevo chicos/as.

49,Hotel Seventy Barcelona Excelente experiencia.,"Por donde empezar , nuestras vacaciones no pudieron ser mas placenteras. El hotel Seventy y su excelente servicio al cliente fue el centro y propulsor de todas nuestras vacaciones. Solo nos ibamos a quedar hospedados 2 noches y terminamos hospedandonos 6 noches. Inmediatamente entras sientes un ambiente super agradable recibiendote Manu quien te recibe de manera efusiva y alegre y haciendote sentir especial.. nos Recibio Fanny quien nos ayudo con mucho profesionalismo a tramitar nuestro hospedaje y cambios de lugar para acomodarnos y prolongar nuestra estadia. Por ultimo quien agrego esa chispa que complemento el no querer casi salir del hotel preparandonos desde ese delicioso capuchino hasta esos Cocteles que nos trasnportaban hacia todoa Barcelona sin tener que salir a ella.. siempre servicial y con mucho profesionalismo fue Juan Diaz. Estos empleados junto a la guia proporcinada por annita hacen que el Hotel senventy, sus instalaciones y su excelente ubicacion sea unos de los mejores en Barcelona. Nos veremos pronto .",5,2019,12,12
49,EL MEJOR HOTEL,"Excelente hotel! El servicio espectacular especialmente de Fabiana en el desayuno, Tatiana y Fanny! Muy limpio, habitaci√≥n muy bonita y c√≥modo, ubicaci√≥n la mejor!! Nuevo con una decoraci√≥n muuy bonita! Muy acojedor!",5,2019,12,10
49,¬°¬°¬°Qu√© sitio mas bonito!!!,"Iba a titular ""que hotel mas bonito"", pero sent√≠a que se me quedaba corto, este sitio trasciende al concepto de hotel. Aunque estoy escribiendo esta rese√±a, tengo la firme convicci√≥n de que lo ideal es descubrirlo sin haber o√≠do/leido nada sobre √©l, como me ocurri√≥ a mi. 
Aunque ya puestos, os cuento mi impresi√≥n; no es s√≥lo un hotel, aunque la habitaci√≥n fue genial, con un dise√±o moderno pero acogedor gracias a los elementos de madera, que le da un cierto aire colonial...tremendo colch√≥n de 2x2, mucha luz (daba a la parte trasera, que aunque tiene edificios de viviendas, estan bastante alejados), y el patio del hotel que queda debajo es precioso.
S√≥lo poner un pero: el importante componente tecnologico de la habitaci√≥n, gestionable desde la smart-tv, me dio algunos problemas, y ech√© de menos  informaci√≥n mas clara sobre como utilizarla...en fin, sabiendo que hace dos meses que han comenzado su andadura, supongo que lo resolveran.
Las zonas comunes del hotel: el bar, las zonas de lectura (y con multiples puntos de conexi√≥n), los reservados pata comer/beber algo, todo es moderno, luminosos pero acogedor. Al final de la tarde la musica en directo que te recibe al entrar en el vestibulo junto al bar es una invitaci√≥n en toda regla. Yo tuve ademas la deferencia de una primera copa cortes√≠a del hotel, asi que mejor que mejor.
Desayuno muy saludable y completo, aunque la zona de cafe y tostador se queda manifiestamente peque√±a cuando coinciden varias personas...
L√°stima que mis obligaciones no me permitieron disfrutar del spa...
La ubicaci√≥n del hotel no puede ser mejor, para moverte a pi√© por una preciosa zona de Barcelona, junto al Paseo de Gracia y Diagonal...
Algun aspecto mejorable: El hotel no dispone de espacio de carga y descarga de viajeros delante, lo cual lo hace un poco incomodo para llegar en coche.
Por √∫ltimo destacar la atenci√≥n del staff, desde el Director, Victor, que ademas result√≥ ser paisano, al personal de recepci√≥n, en especial Alma y sus compa√±eros, amables y diligentes con un celo profesional por encima de la media. Tuvimos un cierto malentendido inicial que resolvieron de forma muy satisfactoria.",5,2019,12,08
49,Todo excelente- Eccellente!! (recensione in spagnolo e italiano),"Fu√¨ al Seventy hace 3-4 semanas. Todo excelente: 
-el hotel, maravilloso, nuevo, super limpio
-comida (desayuno, almuerzo y cena, yo tengo intolerancias al gluten y lactosa pero aqu√≠ no encontr√© alg√∫n problema, de hecho, hab√≠an tambi√©n productos espec√≠ficos para mi. En general, la calidad de la comida es excelente, estaba todo delicioso. Hay tambi√©n el men√π por el servicio de habitaciones
-servicio, excelente por la limpieza, por los cuartos completos de todo, (secador de pelo,  plancha, maquina de caf√©, t√©, mini bar,  todo lo necesario por el ba√±o, bata, zapatillas, shampoo y acondicionador..) televisor, wi-fi...
-la posici√≥n, cerca de 5 minutos del metro, en una zona muy central y linda y bien conectada con los transportes
- el personal. Muy amable, clima familiar. Saludos a Fabiana, a Roberta y a todos los dem√°s!!
Super aconsejado, voy seguramente a regresar.

Sono stata al Seventy circa 3-4 settimane fa.
Che dire, hotel nuovissimo e pulitissimo. Cucina favolosa, per tutti i pasti, inoltre soffro di intolleranza al glutine e al lattosio e tutte le volte √® veramente difficile trovare qualcosa sul men√π per me, invece grazie alla variet√† del men√π e alla disponibilit√† del personale e della cucina non ho avuto alcun problema!!! Anche a colazione c'erano prodotti speciali senza glutine e lattosio. 
Le camere sono belle e pulite e complete davvero di ogni possibile comodit√†.
L'hotel √® in una posizione centralissima e a 5 minuti da metro e bus, in una bella zona vicino anche alle grandi vie dello shopping..
Il personale √® disponibile e gentile, hanno creato davvero un clima familiare...Grazie a Roberta e a Fabiana per averci fatto sentire a casa!! (e a tutti gli altri di cui non ricordo, purtroppo, i nomi!!)

49,El Corazon de Barcelona,"Geniales Hotel im Herzen von Barcelona!- brandneu und Mitarbeiter, die sich in bester Weise um ihre G√§ste k√ºmmern. Ein junges Team, nie zu aufdringlich, aber immer da. Ein bombastisches Fr√ºhst√ºck, mal nicht √ºberladen mit den √ºblichen Produkten, sondern Qualit√§t, Raffinesse und derart einladend, dass es fast √ºber den ganzen Tag reicht (bester selbst gepresster O-Saft, wundervolle selbst gemachte Kuchen,  Wurst+K√§se typico espana). Hervorragende Bar-keeperin Sandra, hat eigens f√ºr mich am Markt Kumquats besorgt und einen entsprechenden Cocktail gezaubert). Die Zimmer sehr gro√ü mit super Betten und vielen Extras. Rundum ein gelungenes Konzept und Hotel mit Zuhause-Feeling, wir kommen wieder!!!!!!!!!!",5,2019,11,11
