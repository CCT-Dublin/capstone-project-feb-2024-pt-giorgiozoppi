36,Very Happy Hilton Diamond Status Guests,"We arrived early, due to a last-minute British Airlines’ cancellation (with NO explanation) of our previously-scheduled flight from Houston, TX. The newer flight itinerary with American Airlines had us getting in to Barcelona EARLY in the a.m. We were aware of the late (4 p.m.) check in at the Hilton; but we asked the receptionist if there was a place we could stay before our room was ready. As long-time Hilton Diamond status members, we were allowed to “hang out” on the 15th floor in the Executive lounge. That was much appreciated. While waiting, we enjoyed the complimentary coffee and Coca Cola drinks. My husband even took a nap in the rather secluded area that has couches! 

Once the room was ready, we were impressed with the hotel’s efficient elevator system that took us to our room on the 14th floor. The room was spacious, modern, very clean, and had a beautiful view of the sea. The air conditioning was very good. There were welcome chocolates, bottled water, and a hand-written note in the room thanking us for being Hilton Diamond members. Also, there is ambient lighting at night which is not intrusive; but it helps when getting out of bed at night to use the bathroom without having to turn the main light on. The room was very quite/soundproof, and the black-out curtains kept the room dark for sleeping. 

We had the option of going to the Executive lounge for breakfast with a more limited, but still ample breakfast. Our Diamond status also gave us the opportunity to have a complimentary breakfast in the main restaurant at ground level—-and the huge variety and freshness of the food did not disappoint. 

The 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. complimentary snacks and drinks in the Executive lounge (including wine and some liquors) was much appreciated. The views from the lounge (with options to sit on the patio) were amazing. This Hilton (the policies and the staff) treated us with a high level of extras for having Diamond status. Thank you for all of the above! 

If I was being nit-picky, I would have two observations. The large and deep bathtub in the bathroom of our room did not have a drain plug. I wanted to take a hot bath after the exhausting flight from Houston, TX to Miami, Fl, then on to Barcelona—-but there was no plug for me to use to fill the bathtub with water. We brought the matter to the staff’s attention, and maintenance did install a plug in a timely manner. Thank you! The second minor complaint is the small size of the shower. It felt claustrophobic. 

I took photos during our stay to share with others who may be considering booking a room at this hotel. My husband and I would definitely book this hotel again if we ever return to Barcelona.",5,2024,10,18
36,Over the TOP!,"Dear Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona,

I wanted to express my heartfelt appreciation for the exceptional experience my wife and I had during our recent stay at your hotel in Barcelona. I apologize for the delay in sharing this review, but I couldn't let the opportunity pass without expressing our gratitude for the fantastic service we received from start to finish.

When I was researching where to stay and dine in Barcelona, I put in a significant amount of effort to ensure our trip would be memorable. I must admit, the only regret I have is that we didn't stay longer. Your hotel's location was perfect, situated on the outskirts of the bustling city. The convenience of having a subway station just two blocks away made it incredibly easy for us to navigate and reach our desired destinations. Moreover, being within a short distance of the beach and the sea added to the allure of your establishment.

I would like to extend my utmost appreciation to your staff, who truly made our stay exceptional. The executive lounge staff, in particular, was always attentive and helpful, ensuring that everyone in the lounge had everything they needed. I initially requested a room on a higher floor for a better view, but the front desk staff kindly arranged for us to be on the same floor as the lounge. This decision was brilliant, as we were able to enjoy the lounge's offerings while relishing the breathtaking views of the sea and the city. I would like to give a special shout-out to Christopher Ambar, the Guest Relations Manager, for his outstanding service. When we returned to our room, we were pleasantly surprised to find a bottle of sparkling wine and a thoughtful note, setting the perfect tone for our 30-year anniversary trip. It truly touched our hearts.

The room itself was spacious, even by European hotel standards, and impeccably clean and tranquil. I rarely tip the housekeeping staff, but their dedication and attention to detail went above and beyond, deserving of recognition.

Once again, thank you for providing us with a truly memorable experience. We are grateful for the exceptional service, stunning views, and warm gestures that made our stay so special. We will undoubtedly recommend your hotel to our friends and family, and we look forward to returning in the future.

Warm regards,

The Springer's",5,2023,07,13
36,Disappointed,"My review on this hotel is a bit mixed. I arrived later in the day and was checked in with no problem. Upon arrival I noticed the lack of tea/coffee facilities in my room. I called the front desk and was told this is not available in the room but there was coffee downstairs next to reception (except when I went I found it is coffee out of a machine for which you pay!). I showed the front staff the webpage where it showed every room is supposed to have coffee tea facilities. In a half hour they sent up a kettle + tea and coffee. So they essentially misrepresented things initially! Next I went to iron clothes - board was available but no iron. Called not once but three times before staff brought the iron (maybe an hour fifteen or hour and half). Next day went to the breakfast buffet which was excellent but my table was shifted three times (essentially booted out) in one sitting - (I had gone to grab fruit or tea and the table was assigned to someone else). 

A manager called me later to discuss but no real follow up.  These were some of the issues I had with the hotel. 

 On the plus side - excellent location (near mall, near beach, near convention center), very nice pool, room was clean and kept clean by the wonderful housekeeping folks.  Certainly not the best Hilton experience I've had (coming especially after a visit to another Hilton property in another country which was fantastic). 

Overall my experience was mixed.",3,2024,09,04
36,Mixed experience,"Positives - clean rooms, excellent housekeeping staff; fantastic breakfast.

Negatives - poorly responsive front desk staff - room missing key amenities (iron, coffee/tea kettle etc.). Manager supposed to follow up but never did.  Of the twenty hotels I have stayed at this year - easily bottom quartile.",3,2024,09,03
36,"Great staff, facilities and customer service","We just got back from a stay (myself, wife and 2 children aged 5 and 9).
On arrival there was a slight issue with availability of the room we had paid for - but Albert put in lots of effort in making it right and ensuring we were happy. Having stayed at Hilton hotels many times - this is the attention to customer satisfaction we really appreciate and expect from Hilton hotels in general which is why we always return. Additionally Joel was fantastic in helping with our requests.

The hotel itself is great, clean and easy to get around. The room was spacious and clean with a great view. The executive lounge is a great touch, and its somewhere where we spent time as a family playing card games with snacks and spending quality time together which made a lasting memory for the children.

The best part of the stay however, was the level of service from the staff running the buffet breakfast. Edward in particular was fantastic - always greeting everyone with a smile, all while running a busy restaurant space. My 5 year old son has a medical condition requiring a gluten free diet and also
an avoidance of seed oils which is generally quite tricky to accommodate. Edward was awesome and ensured that the chefs prepared my boy a special breakfast cooked in only olive oil so he could also be part of the experience. He was a very happy kid and loved breakfast times which are usually quite difficult.

The location is great for families - not too busy and very easy to grab a taxi from right outside which made it easy to travel around. I had read about issues with the elevators before we visited - but to be honest we didn't have any problems so maybe this is something they have addressed? The elevators are
very high tech and seem to be quite efficient.

We used the Purobeach pool area for a few days - obviously this is run by an external company - but even here we had a great experience, the staff were friendly and made everything very enjoyable. Drinks were priced typically for this type of experience, expensive but fine for a one off holiday etc. The small pool
was great for my 5 year old, but they both were also free to use the large pool which they really enjoyed.

We would recommend this hotel to other families thinking of visiting.",5,2024,09,03
36,Weekend stay,"Lovely and clean hotel . Staff were average. The room was lovely ! 

Reception staff not very helpful and don't tend to pass on messages to housekeeping for extra teas and coffees. After two attempts of asking for more we were given a carrier  bag with extra coffee etc.  We stated we did not want our room servicing , however housekeeping did not get this message and serviced the bedroom they then took away the extra coffees I'd ask for , so I was again in the same cycle of asking for more coffee after the second attempt , along with a WhatsApp message, I just  gave up asking. When checking in you have 2 tiny milks for two guests and 1 coffee etc. 

I cannot fault housekeeping with their clenleness due to the great room servicing we received, however due to taking the extra coffee it let them down. 

The pool staff were fantastic from start to finish, they ran the pool very efficiently. 

They had a coffee machine downstairs (Starbucks) this was empty the whole time we stayed . 

 The prices of some items are ridiculous such as the coke in a bottle at a whopping 6 dollers . 8 dollers for crisps . 

Great hotel but definitely room for improvement in areas.",3,2024,09,02
36,Great city break with kids,"Lovely clean hotel stayed here with my family a week ago. Our room was clean and kept tidy with great views from our room. Close to metro so easy access to all the tourist spots you can get a ticket for more than one day to save money. 
5minutes walk to beach and shopping centre across the road with great options for dinner and activities for the kids. Lovely breakfast and great addition of happy hour between 5pm and 7pm  withfree drinks and snacks. We loved the Purobeach best to get there early if you have kids to use the pool. Friendly and helpful staff.  Big shout out to the hotel manager Antonio who made us feel very welcome and Christophe who my kids have named the left and right shoe guy!  His shoes amused them very much! he was always so helpful and friendly. We had had such a good time staying here can't wait to come back again soon!
Paddan family",5,2024,08,30
36,Restful stay,"Bed is very comfortable 
Loved that the lifts are very quick and easy to use.
Staff are very friendly and always ready to help
Check in is late. 4pm. If one arrives before then, rooms  are not ready before then.
Not happy though that the rest of the family couldn’t join us for breakfast on the 15th floor, which also had its own breakfast area.
Overall great hotel. Wonderful shopping centre opposite the hotel with the Alcampo supermarket.",4,2024,08,26
36,As expected,"I spent 4 nights at the Hilton in Barcelona and to be honest, I got what I and most people probably expect from a Hilton.
In that, it’s a large hotel in a good location, but the beach, a taxi rank outside and plenty of decent eateries within a 15 minute walk. The staff are friendly, the breakfast is good and varies slightly each day, although I didn’t get a chance to try the Purobeach as was too busy seeing the sights!
The room was large for 2 adults, a child and baby, and well cleaned each day. The water/ice machine close to the room was a saviour as it was so hot, but air con worked well. The bath/shower could have been bigger but overall, we were very happy with the room.
We didn’t have any complaints during our stay and I’d recommend it to anyone with children looking for a good quality hotel for a reasonable price near the beach.
Special mention to Maria at breakfast who was a real star every morning, bright kind and friendly, a credit to the team.",5,2024,08,25
36,Family Barca break,"We booked this hotel because of the interconnecting rooms (1 super king and 1 twin) which we needed as a family as well as the pool.
Recently read reviews about issues with the pool as the purobeach is run by a separate company. We wee really worried that we had booked the wrong place especially as it's a little way out of the city too.
However,  we were pleasantly surprised. The hotel is really not too far from the city, easily reached by the metro.
The rooms were brilliant, good size, we had sea and pool view.
Breakfast was amazing, loads of choice..freshly made omelette too.
The hotel was very busy when we were there but we only found the breakfast to be very busy on 1 of our 4 days.
The pool area.... so it is first come first served for hotel guests who are also segregated in a separate area from purobeach guests..some are by the pool and some are in a totally separate area of the pool area. We had to wait one day for a sunbed, but the kids could use the pool and we had a sofa. It really wasn't an issue and the other day we got a sunbed in the afternoon without issue, but it was not clear at the time of booking that this was the case.
Overall though would recommend the hotel. ",4,2024,08,22
36,Purobeach disappointing highly over rated,"We booked this hotel for a family trip of four days. My son was specially interested in Purobeach and tried to book it in advance seemed not to be possible. Seeing it was a bad experience, a small pool over priced and highly over rated, no dj hardly any beds available, drinks are far to expensive food even more expensive with poor quality.

The Hotel is very busy not real lobby only a crowded area at the entrance, a constant smell of not cleaned floors.

Staff fighting over payment of salary, late and bad room cleaning.

My advice to this hotel refurbish the ground floor, hire well trained staff at the front desk and in cleaning, listen to complaints and do something about it.",3,2024,08,14
36,Convention Hotel outside of Tourist Area,"This is kind of a mixed review.  The hotel is fine - although rooms showing their age it was quite comfortable (exposed electric wires, glass shower divider dangling, security lock on door almost falling off but serviceable)..  Fantastic ocean views from our room on the 15th floor and access to an excellent Executive Lounge with terrific terrace.
However - if you are coming to experience Barcelona - especially for the first time, you may want to consider another area.
This hotel is between a convention center and shopping mall - so you will either have people attending business or 'off-season' tour groups or pre/post cruise passengers. Very little 'Barcelona Experience' here.   Biggest surprise is that much of the front desk staff only spoke English.  This is great from tourists... but I've been to Barcelona many, many times and never seen a hotel staff that didn't speak the local language.  But this is great for the staff who get to work in Spain without language and fantastic for a mostly English-speaking clientele - so it's not so much a complaint as a curiosity.
To see anything of Barcelona - you have to walk about 15 minutes to the metro and usually require at least one transfer.  We opted for taxis and it was usually about 15-20 Euros to Plaza Cataluña or nearby. Taxis easy to find outside the hotel.
So - for a short stopover on our way home from Asia - this was fine... I wound't stay again since it is so remote from everything that makes Barcelona one of the most fantastic cities in the world.  But if you are here for convenience, English-friendly and enjoy hotel pools, shopping malls and food courts as a base for day-trips... it should let you feel perfectly at home.",3,2024,08,11
36,Wonderful stay,"Wow, what can I say, the staff were amazing, breakfast was fantastic, with views from the executive lounge, haven't been to the Hotel In Barcelona for over 10 years, even then it was amazing. Thanks for a fantastic 5 night, may return for my 60th next year",5,2024,08,07
36,Good family location,Busted with family for around a week. Enjoyed the location as close to beach for water sports (jet scoot great) and also a mall/restaurant area for the evening. Taxi to the city around €15/20 euro which we didn’t mind but if your group is more than 4 (like ours it can be a little more tricky to get a cab so pre ordering recommended). Hotel good with exec lounge on 15th floor. Pool area good but NOT part of the hotel. There are some provisions for guests but be prepared to pay for a lounger etc if the small guest area is full. The hotel could and should make this clear on the website. Elevators a total pain (long waits all the time and very hot when you’re in them). A few maintenance issues during our stay but management staff (Joel in our case) made up for matters to our satisfaction. Hotel also accommodated a late check out and allowed us to use the facilities (including lounge) until it was time for our flight. Would recommend for a family stay if you don’t mind being out of the main city a bit.,4,2024,08,06
36,"Great hotel, will be back!","The hotel is beautiful, had a couple of issues at check in and the lifts unfortunately are not the best, however the rest of the stay was lovely. By far the best buffet breakfast I have EVER had, and the pool was really nice too. All staff was lovely and ready to help",4,2024,08,01
36,Abzocke! You have the feeling they are ripping you off,"Prices are completely exorbitant: 
even if you are a hotel guess you need to pay 40€ per person for a sunbed at the pool. 
At the pool restaurant you pay €9 for a bottle of water or 13€ for a smoothie.
And it goes on like this: €36 per day to park the car.
This in a hotel where you have paid €250 per day for the room is completely unacceptable!!",2,2024,07,28
36,Lovely stay!,"It was a lovely stay At Hilton. Just me and my 2 kids, we escaped the cold from Iceland to Barcelona and Hilton was a great choice. 
Staff Victor and Julio were very helpful and friendly to us. 
The breakfast was AMAZING!
The pool area was great! 
Thank you so much guy!",4,2024,07,21
36,Nice hotel and comfortable stay but it’s not a hotel with a pool,"I stayed here for 2 nights whilst visiting Barcelona for the first time… the hotel is clean and pleasant and my room was a great size! The hotel staff are friendly and helpful despite the hotel being incredibly busy during my stay. 

There was some issues at the start of my stay regarding the pool area - on booking.com it appears as a hotel with a pool but it is not, the pool is a completely separate business! And despite the hotel responding to Q&A’s suggesting that there is an area for hotel guests - that area was full and I was told I would need to pay for a sunbed. I expressed my upset to the hotel after feeling mislead by this and the staff were empathic and did what they could to resolve my upset. I wanted to mention this in my review so others are more informed and prepared. It also might be worth mentioning that the hotels complimentary sunbeds are located in an area away from the pool (you can’t see the pool at all), so if this isn’t for you, then you may wish to pay for one by the pool instead. 

The hotel is about an hours walk from the centre of Barcelona but just a short taxi ride away (approx €15) and taxi’s are parked on the road by the hotel making it really easy! The room is cleaned daily and the cleaning staff are happy to give you all the tea supplies you want (if you’re like me and struggle without numerous cups throughout the day haha!) The shower worked great and the bed was very comfortable! 

Overall, the hotel is nice, the staff are friendly I was very happy with the room - but I wish the pool situation was different!",3,2024,07,16
36,DISGUSTING,"So bad.   Avoid this hotel.  
I will keep it brief.   Horrible area, arrived to security and 3 cops in the lobby.  Secondary lock on our door had been busted.  Halls SMELL so badly.   OUR keys did not work 6 TIMES.  Had to go to the front desk multiple times.   I CRING to write this, CRING, there was a LIVE WORM in my scrambled eggs at breakfast.
PLACE IS HORRIBLE- brought to the attention of an assistant manager and said he would give us 2 free drinks- REALLY?  
IT is DISGUSTING",1,2024,07,16
36,Zero emotions: thanks Hilton,"I stayed on July 5th during my honeymoon. I chose Hilton for its reputation, excellence, and facilities. Once, Hilton had a different prestige, but today—like many three-star hotels—it only focuses on check-ins and check-outs. No emotion, zero, nothing, rien, nunca. Despite numerous emails with the Reservations Office where I repeatedly mentioned the special occasion, upon check-in and entering the room, I was not offered a welcome drink, a personalized welcome letter, or any in-room amenities (neither at turndown nor upon arrival). It was as if the special occasion I had highlighted was completely ignored. Perhaps an upgrade? But an upgrade doesn't convey a sense of hospitality; it's just a room. I paid solely to sleep, despite wanting to enjoy the pool. Thank you, Hilton, for being the only one to ruin my vacation, making me spend two days searching for another last-minute hotel, packing up just after unpacking, and showing me how little you know about hospitality.",1,2024,07,16
36,It's ok but I will not stay here again.,"I enjoy the view in the sea view room. The beds were hard and very uncomfortable. for two nights in a row someone kept knocking on the door at 2:30 am. I informed the front desk, and they explain the person probably had the wrong room. The pool is not readily available for hotel guest and its first come first serve so I wasn't able swim at the pool. The hotel has a nice location across the street from the mall.",3,2024,07,08
36,Family break in May,"Spent 6 nights B*B as a family (3adults and 2children) as my mother was attending a retreat run by Dr Joe Dispenza nearby. The hotel is beautiful with 5 star facilities just perfect for a luxury city break.  Great location, easy to explore Barcelona from here - we found the trains very simple to navigate. The food throughout the hotel was excellent, the breakfast buffet offered a great variety to suit all and the pool side menu was very good too. Downstairs in the lobby food and cocktails were again delicious. Pool area was modern and  impressive with outside and inside areas and very luxurious sunbeds and cabanas to relax on. Great place for stag/hen parties.",5,2024,06,15
36,Nice out of the way place to stay near the shore in Barcelona,"We stayed here prior to our cruise.  The rooms a typical Hilton, roomy and comfortable.  The only drawback that we experienced was the breakfast.  A I am not a big breakfast eater there was no place to go in the hotel to get just a coffee and pastry for breakfast.  While my wife had breakfast I just had a coffee and pastry and got charged 33 Euros.  The same as her breakfast.  Beware if your not a big breakfast eater.  All in all I would stay there again but just skip breakfast.",5,2024,06,02
36,Overall a nice hotel ,"We stayed at this hotel and the Hilton Barcelona on our trip to Barcelona. The Diagonal mar is a bit nicer than the Hilton barcelona which needs an upgrade. My main problem with diagonal mar was the way they handled our reservation. We had made two separate ones which they couldn't seem to combine. This involved numerous phone calls and discussions with the manager and diamond desk which was a real hassle. We were also promised an upgrade which we never got. Still, a nice hotel but out  of the way from the main tourist attractions ",4,2024,06,02
36,Breakfast terrace I will never forget,This was an amazing hotel the location one block from the beach was perfect for relaxing on the beach or going to the rooftop pool with a bar. That was great. We’re having breakfast on the terrace that overlook the ocean you couldn’t go wrong. This hotel was the place to be in Barcelona.,5,2024,05,28
36,An amazing city break!,"This hotel is great. It’s very busy and 2 of the very high tech lifts were broken for one of the days we were here so we used the stairs / staff lift that day which was fine (a few other guests were moaning about this but the hotel staff fixed it as quickly as possible and helped escort us to other facilities and were helpful!). It is busy so there was sometimes a small queue at reception but they always added extra staff if that happened and cleared it quickly. Breakfast was fantastic - best array of breakfast buffet we’ve ever had at a city hotel! We also had access to the executive lounge as we had a family suite and that was great - extra food and drinks and a chilling area which was a good perk! The pool is great with good facilities and the beach is 5 mins walk away which is very convenient. There is also a massive shopping centre across the road with lots of shops and restaurants and amenities and a lovely kids playground too! So the location is fab! There is a metro station within 5 mins walk so it’s very quick to commute to Las Ramblas etc and we also did a 20 min taxi journey (taxi rink right next to the hotel too) to the science museum here which is a must see if you have children as it has a giant rainforest and all the science and fun they could ever want - it’s also near the Tibidabo funicular etc where there’s a lovely fair and amazing views. We will stay here again if we come back to Barcelona as we can’t fault this hotel - staff are friendly and welcoming, rooms are clean and great facilities, and location is excellent.",5,2024,05,28
36,Question the cleanliness of the room,"Stayed both before and after our cruise. Before our cruise we had a wonderful room with a great separate shower and a nice view. Second room, 715, did not have a separate shower and I found the bath tub/shower was difficult to regulate the temperature in. Most concerning was when I was getting ready for bed and noticed a rolled up condom under the sink unit. For the first time in my life I am not leaving a tip for the maid because immediately I questioned just how clean a room is when a used condom is missed when ""cleaning"" the floor in the bathroom. 
Check in staff were amazing and other than that unpleasant experience I would still recommend the hotel for convenience and courtesy of check in staff.",4,2024,05,25
36,Poor services and lift ain’t working.,"I am staying at the hotel at the moment and not having a great stay at the hotel, while other things are still fine, the most painful part is the elevator, people are struggling to get elevators during the peak hours in particular, extremely disappointed with that. 

Also, my room’s case ain’t working ever since I arrived and nobody is bothered to fix it either.

Extremely disappointed to see this happening with a hotel of Hilton’s caliber, won’t recommend unless they improve drastically.",2,2024,05,23
36,"Definitely a clean, updated, beautiful hotel if you’re visiting beautiful Barcelona","This hotel was exceptional. The location was across many restaurants and easy to grab an Uber to all of our sightseeing. Very close to beautiful beach walks.
The pool area pure beach was exceptional. Service was great very vibrant and lively my college son. Loved it as well. The bathrooms were large and updated. We had a room that faced the ocean. Whenever I can get back to Barcelona, this is where I will stay.
Almost forgot to mention the service maria at the front desk was helpful, kind and accommodating and provided guidance to restaurants, etc.",5,2024,05,17
36,I would stay here again,Nice room with a view of the water . Good service from friendly staff. They let us check in at 1000  which was wonderful after a long flight. Breakfast was amazing . The executive lounge had outstanding food and beverages. Elevators were a little odd to us at first but the system really does work well. Staff was helpful when we needed a cab and we found the public transportation easy to use and close by.,5,2024,05,09
36,Amazing Stay - Simply the Best,"What a great hotel experience.  From the clean, modern and spacious rooms, to the elite customer service, to the absolutely decadent breakfast to the utterly breathtaking pool, it was one of the best Hilton stays I've had.  The customer service was unmatched, as they constantly strove to provide the best of the best service.  The breakfast is a hidden gem, as you have omelets cooked to order, fresh batch of bacon, sausage and eggs.  A whole table dedicated to fresh bread.  Drink stations filtered throughout, coffee stations throughout and of course, for those who prefer the healthier options, a giant fruit, yogurt and deli section.  Really, am amazing experience!",5,2024,04,06
36,Good Barcelona hotel,"I like a hotel with a good Executive Lounge but am often disappointed with the offerings, this was one of the better lounges. A great array of food and drinks during my one night stay. Very friendly staff throughout the hotel and a comfortable room - I can ask for no more so would stay here in my next visit to Barcelona.",4,2024,04,03
36,Great place by the beach ,My wife and I loved staying at this hotel.   We were put on the 13th floor and we had a fantastic view of the ocean.   Our room was clean and had everything we needed.   Bell staff were awesome in helping to park our car and bring our things to the room.   Breakfast the next morning was very nice.   Highly recommended when in Barcelona. ,5,2024,04,02
36,"Excellent service, food, and views","We highly recommend the Hilton Diagonal Mar. The service was excellent! We were very impressed with the quality of food and the incredible hospitality from the staff. The views of the sea from our room and the city from executive lounge were fantastic! Aürt and Mai were fantastic restaurants. 

While this hotel is a little further from the touristy areas, it was an easy metro ride to town. The metro was clean and reliable.",5,2024,03,27
36,Charged for a stay canceled ahead of cancelation deadline,"This is a hotel that I stayed in a while back.  I recently made a new reservation with them on my Hilton Honors app. The reservation was flexible with a 24-hour cancellation policy. I then canceled the reservation 4-days ahead of the check-in date, in my Hilton Honors app. Later on, I discovered that the hotel still charged me for one night penalty. Despite the cancellation proof from my app and the cancellation email from Hilton Honors, the hotel is still refusing to refund. This is a highly unprofessional and disorganized hotel. I am still dealing with them and also disputing the charge through my credit card company. All that hassle and wasted time. I would never stay there again and never recommend the place to anybody.",1,2024,03,17
36,Great for conference hall.  Welcome service!,"Excellent location fr the exhibition hall.  2 minute walk.
Comfortable rooms. 
Lively bar with an excellent bar lady... really makes you feel welcome and cheers up everyone.... well done.  
The lifts are frustrating... 4 lifts and still long waits.
Breakfast.... love it ",4,2024,03,12
36,Conveniently located near conferencing facilities,"The hotel, conveniently located near conferencing facilities, offers spacious rooms and a good shopping location, although the initial experience may be a bit chaotic when large groups are also checking in.
Excellent areas for socializing and enjoying drinks at the bar.",4,2024,02,27
36,Great hotel in a great city,"What an amazing hotel with such friendly staff!
We stayed here over a weekend in February to escape the cold from a different country and had the best experience thanks to the hard work of all team members of this beautiful Hilton.
Albert checked us in and was super available taking his time to answer our questions and allowing us to communicate in ‘Spanglish’.
Eva at the executive lounge, which by the way is very nice with a lovely terrace and tasty tapas, welcomed us warmly and ensured we had a comfortable afternoon break.
Keilin and Eduard gave us many advices about where to go in the evening to fetch a good paella and Maria was super nice at the breakfast room in the morning.
Room was clean and spacious, we got lucky getting an upgrade (don’t forget its subject to availability and often linked to your membership), the gym is open 24/7 and the lifts are super fast!
Besides, there’s plenty of taxis lined up next to the hotel in case you want to speed up your path to the city centre which is anyway reachable by metro just 5 minutes from the hotel.
I cannot find anything that wasn’t great about our stay.
Muchas gracias y hasta la próxima vez!",5,2024,02,18
36,Business hotel without lot of charm,"This Hilton is for business mostly. Nothing very warm or cozy.
The rooms are comfortable but I cannot find a good reason to come back again.
Location is far from city center and besides the mall across the street there is nothing much to do around.
Last thing, time of check-out was 10am which is quite early.",3,2024,02,09
36,Exceptional Experience,"We stayed 7 days and had an exceptional experience from the day we arrived. Whether it was at the front desk, in the executive lounge, or during our breakfast in the morning, everyone was so friendly and warm. The cleaning service in our room was amazing. Even though we had different schedules each day, it always seemed like the room was ready for us when we got back (with chocolates and other special touches!). 

There are 2 individuals though, that made our visit extra special: Célia and Eduard who were working in the executive lounge during the evening happy hours. They went above and beyond to make us feel at home and it was truly a pleasure meeting them both. 

Thank you so much, and we look forward to coming back again soon!",5,2024,01,27
36,Amazing Stay!!! 😄,"Me and my girlfriend arrived in the hotel early and was welcomed with smiles. Joel checked us in, he was very helpful and lovely. The hotel has a michelin star restaurant beside their lobby restaurant/bar MAI. I want to thank Franco the bartender of MAI. He was very nice and engaging. The breakfast buffet was 10/10. There were a lot of choices for food and the breakfast team was awesome, special notes for Michael, he is very funny.",5,2024,01,13
36,Breakfast of Champions,"We needed a one night, stay in Barcelona prior to a cruise, despite being a little bit further out the Hilton diagonal mar was an excellent choice.  We were recognised from visiting the previous year and we upgraded due to our diamond status, more of that later.

The hotel pool was closed due to the season, which wasn’t any bother as it was cold outside this was more than made up for by the warm welcome and demeanour of all the staff, especially in the executive lounge. 

The next morning we had breakfast, which was out of this world. Exceptional!, one of the nicest breakfasts we have had recently. The choice of foods were quite astonishing and they have truly up the game again. My diamond membership status was recognised that many other Hilton motels could do to remember  

A huge thanks with all of those with whom we had interaction, the care they show to their guests really stands out",5,2024,01,06
36,Exceptional,"The hotel is on the suburb of Barcelona, but the tram station is ~6 minutes walk away. As a diamond member I was upgraded to their sea view room, and the room was impeccably designed. 

Breakfast was exceptional, and I really appreciate the diamond member special breakfast dish. It's a small gesture but it matters. 

Executive lounge was, in my opinion, the second best exec lounge at a Hilton property in the continental Europe after Hilton Prague (the Prague one took up almost a whole floor to be fair). 

The view was breathtaking.",5,2024,01,05
36,The Small Details Matter. ,"This was my second visit to this business hotel at the ""other"" end of Barcelona - I chose the hotel for a repeat visit as I was familiar with the surroundings and have loyalty with the Hilton Hotels brand in Spain but my last visit was 4 years ago before the pandemic. The hotel is located a significant walk from a number of the major tourist destinations at the end of the Avenida Diagonal but it's well located for the beach, metro, tram, and a very well appointed shopping centre which makes it a good alternative to central Barcelona if you want something a bit off the beaten track and away from lots of tourists. 

The service from the staff was generally polite, but quite reserved, with the exception of the breakfast hosts who provided truly excellent and friendly customer service.  

I think my leading feedback is that in world where Barcelona offers a load of high-end hotels, the small details really make a difference to a leisure stay like this - so some of my feedback is as follows: 

PROs: 
- As mentioned above the location is a bonus but also a challenge - you're very close to the beach and the shopping centre with a massive Alcampo supermarket which are excellent - you are quite far away from the major tourist spots of BCN however, so expect either a long walk or public transport if you need to get anywhere. 
- All areas of the hotel I saw were spotlessly (and meticulously) clean.
- The hotel has good internet connectivity in all the rooms and public spaces. 
- The higher floors have sea views but these views do include an office block from some rooms.
- The property itself seems to be in very good state of repair everywhere.  

CONS:
- As mentioned in other areas of this review - the lifts at this property are a disaster - they are some sort of priority system, which means it can sometimes take up to two minutes to get into a lift, which then carries customers to a number of floors if there are lots of people waiting at busy times. 
- The breakfast staff were excellent, but the food in general was nothing to write home about. Breakfast gets very busy after 8.30 in the morning which isn't fun. 
- Room service is incredibly expensive. I paid €37,00 for a pizza and some fries - which is insane considering there is also a €6 tray charge which is extortionately expensive, so take care when ordering room service as there are other restaurants nearby. 
- I was asked multiple times (including a phone call) if i wanted to attend their New Year's Eve event. At €395 PER PERSON this was an insane price (and so I had to repeatedly and politely decline.)
- Some weird choices - I asked for different pillows and was told no, they didn't have any, and I also asked on check out if I could post some (stamped) postcards home and was told that the hotel wouldn't accept these in their outgoing mail, so I had to find a post box which was annoying and inconvenient. (Why?)
- The shower pressure at hot temperatures in my shower was woeful - and this became a real annoyance as my trip continued - this is one of the basics a hotel like this should get right. 
- The hotel needs to work on it's in room entertainment (TV, Movie choice etc) - especially for the winter months where people might not be out and about in the city as much. 

And then there's the ""not sure"" - my room had the weirdest configuration I've seen in a hotel for a while - instead of the normal config I assume that someone had made the decision to put the bed in the middle of the room with the desk and wardrobe behind the headboard - I assume this was so you could wake up and look at the sea view, but in reality all i could see when lying down was an office block - so I felt this odd layout really compromised the space for not much return for the attempt. Next time I would definitely question this but you might want to check this out if you book one of the King rooms like I did. 

In all this is a really smart and clean hotel - with an attempt to do *something* good for the guest experience, but in trying to do so it forgets the basic essentials which can sometimes make, or break, one's impression of a stay in a great city like Barcelona. ",4,2024,01,01
36,Another good visit! Love the beach club,"This is our third stay at the diagonal Mar and although it was really busy so service was not the same we still had an enjoyable stay.

I stayed here with my husband and we had an interconnected room for our 2 boys. My brother stayed in another room. 

I’ve reviewed the hotel before and normally don’t do multiple reviews but the beach club is so good it keeps us coming back. It would have been another 5 stars if they had enough staff to manage the front desk and keep the queues and waiting times down.",4,2023,12,28
36,Enjoyable Stay,"I recently had the pleasure of staying at Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona, and my experience was nothing short of exceptional. From the moment I entered the lobby, the warm and welcoming atmosphere set the tone for a memorable stay. The room was impeccably clean, and the staff members were accommodating. My stay was a delightful experience, and I would highly recommend it!",5,2023,12,18
36,"Best of both worlds, the beaches and the city","Stayed at the Hilton in late September.  My first time to Barcelona and was an exciting experience.   I have stayed in many Hiltons but this one was very nice, spacious, friendly and convenient.  We thought of staying in the heart of the city but this location is right near the beaches to walk to and near a subway station to go anywhere.  The beaches are a way of life for the locals and enjoyed seeing them come out after work several days.  Easy train ride to La Familia, Ramblas, etc.",5,2023,12,14
36,Elevators don't work,"The elevators require up to a 30 min wait.  You can only ride the elevator the system assigns to you.  Well, it assigns the same elevator to everyone.  I was in the executive lounge at about 7:50, they close at 8:00.  I was told they were closing and I needed to leave.  Not exactly executive service.  ",2,2023,12,08
36,Stay literally anywhere else,"I should have listened to the reviews. One of the worst Hiltons I've stayed at and the worst hotel in Barcelona I booked with. Service is rude (like it pained them to check me in), the room and amenities subpar, and location is far from all of the cultural points of interest in the city. Much preferred the cotton club hotel or the h10 madison. The kettle in the room had rotting food stuck inside, coffee is instant powder, and the only place to use your amex hotel collections credit is the sad refrigerator downstairs or the ""lobby bar.""",1,2023,11,30
36,Four nights with noise from six elevators plus three service elevators,"I stayed at the Hilton Diagonal Mar from the 13. November to 17. November. I was given a room ""next door"" to six elevators plus three service elevators which were in constant use, starting in the early morning hours and again throughout the evening.

The noise from the elevator was unbearable and I asked for another room (several times), but no other rooms were available and the reception even confirmed that they well aware of the noise inconvenience in my room

That being the case, I’m very surprised that a hotel chain with the reputation of Hiltons would even uses this room, or as a minimum that a room like this would be at a reduced price.

Hilton, this is not acceptable even if you have a large event in your hotel.",1,2023,11,22
36,Four nights with annoying noise from six elevators plus three service elevators ,"Imagine staying in a room where the annoying noise from six elevators plus three service elevators is constant, starting in the early morning hours and again throughout the evening.

This was the case during my four nights at the Hilton Diagonal Mar in Barcelona.

I obviously asked for another room (several times), but no other rooms were available and the reception even confirmed that they well aware of the noise inconvenience in my room.

That being the case, I’m very surprised that a hotel chain with the reputation of Hiltons would even uses this room, or as a minimum that a room like this would be at a reduced price.

I paid approx. 1100 Euro’s for the 4 nights. 

@Hilton, this is not acceptable even if you have a large event in your hotel.",1,2023,11,20
36,Hilton Diagonal Mar,"Beautiful, clean rooms. Stephany and the other staff made sure we had a wonderful stay. A nice mall with a large number of restaurants are located directly across from the hotel. However we only ate at the hotel as the buffet had many tasty items and the service was excellent ",5,2023,11,18
36,Amazing hotel with great amenities!,A really great hotel near the city center! The rooms are spacious and well organized with big windows for a beautiful view of Barceloneta beach. The food was delicious in the restaurant as well as the breakfast! The staff were kind and helpful!,5,2023,11,17
36,Great central place to stay in Barcelona,"I stayed at Hilton Diagonal Mar during November 2023 and I was very satisfied with my experience. I was given a corner Mediterranean room on the 9th floor with amazing views of the city and the sea, which was very comfortable as it had two spaces (living room and bedroom separately) and each person could have their autonomy when needed. We tried the breakfast in room and honestly it was more than delicious and with great variety! The location was perfect, close to all attractions by metro as the closest metro station was only some minutes away on foot. Also a huge mall was located right opposite the hotel where you can find literally anything you need. We also tried the MAi restaurant at the hotel and were excited with the delicious food and creative cocktails, and also with the really welcoming and kind bartender. Will definitely come back again during my next trip to Barcelona!",5,2023,11,17
36,Great Stay in Barcelona,"Perfect hotel for our Barcelona stay, easy by Taxi to get from the Airport. 
Beautiful Sea View, quiet residential and business area, but only a few steps away to the hustle and bustle of the city centre. Lovely walks by the beach morning and evening. Great Shopping Centre next door too. 
The staff were always welcoming and helpful as I was with my daughter on my own, this made a big difference to our stay. The breakfast was fantastic along with the service. Thank You to you all. ",5,2023,11,13
36,Great service from the staff,"I traveled here on business for only one night. On arrival in my room, I realised I could hear the elevator machinery from the room which I knew would make it difficult for me to sleep. 
When I contacted them, staff member Oriol immediately assigned me a new, quiet room. He also helped me move my belongings from one room to the other. 
Also, we had to check out very early (and before breakfast started). Staff member Praxedes gave us a breakfast box with fresh fruit, yogurt and pastries and he even arranged fresh coffee for us. 
Great service from a team who clearly focus on the customer.",5,2023,10,23
36,Unexpected tax charges,"The hotel was a great location, service was outstanding and the breakfast buffet was amazing. We could easily walk to the mall across the street, easily grab a taxi to the cathedrals, and other tourists sites. As a diamond member we were upgraded to an ocean view room on the 22 floor (booked a standard room). Sadly the room was next to the elevators and that noise (lift motors running) all night was very distracting for sleeping. I asked for a different room, and they could not accommodate. After my 3 night stay, upon check out I was informed about a tax that the city charges. No where on the web site was this tax mentioned, nor was it mentioned when I was checking in. It’s a small tax 4.90euro/person/night, but being surprised about an additional charge was not pleasant. There were other guest talking the same issue at the check out desk. So this seems like a known problem. The guest services manager stated a lot of people complain about this and that he would bring up in the next meeting…. But that there was nothing he could do. ",3,2023,10,23
36,Friend's Trip,"everything was perfect. special thank to Paola, who made our C/I ideal. we felt very appreciated as she helped in anything we needed for our stay to be special and perfect. also thanks to breakfast TMs who celebrated my bday. (unfortunately I don't remember their names) 
everything was perfect from cleanness to all the time smiling faces of TMs.",5,2023,10,22
36,Thank you Hilton,The hotel is just perfect.  Excellent experience throughout the whole holiday. The breakfast was incredibly tasty and the staff is welcoming. Our room was spacious and housekeeping well always helping when needed. The pool was fun and we would definitely recommend this hotel to our friends and family as well. Very pleasant stay.,5,2023,10,20
36,This IS a 4 plus star hotel,"From the moment I made the reservations, I received excellent service.
As a Hilton Honors Diamond member, you certainly feel welcome, truly the most I've experienced at any Hilton stay.
Room is fresh, views are beautiful.
The 15th floor contains the executive lounge, an additional free peek of being a member.
Offer light snacks from 530-7pm and open bottle service (happy hour).
Breakfast is served from 730am-1030, light options.
The main breakfast buffet is located on floor 1.
It's expansive, WIDE variety of options. I actually had a small salad, not typical for me, but it looked soo fresh, and IT WAS.
Service has been phenomenal every area of the hotel we have accessed.
After staying in a ""4"" star hotel down the street for four evenings prior, wish I would have stayed here my entire trip instead.
THIS IS A 4STAR plus hotel.
Good work!",5,2023,10,20
36,Good hotel good location ,"Hotel location is great, right opposite del mar shopping centre with lots of food options, cinema great shops etc. staff friendly, we didn’t really need much and was out all the time but I will say there was a lot of noise in the morning and during the night from underneath and next door the walls seem paper thin. Room was big and had a fridge, gym was small but sufficient. Didn’t try breakfast.about 20 mins drive from Las ramblas and all the major attractions. Can walk to the port (10-15mins) where there are some restaurants  and a cool new shisha lounge. ",4,2023,10,17
36,Efficient hotel for conferences ,"Good business hotel. Clean and efficient. It is right next to the conference centre and a 2 minute walk to it. It has a large mall opposite with plenty of food and shopping options. Plenty of taxis around. It takes 25 minutes into the main tourist areas. 

The rooms are large and clean. They are sparse. The bathroom aminities are minimal and in those large bolted bottles common after covid. The lifts take sometime long to arrive. The pool area is really fun and worth a visit. Great vibe there. 

The reception can get busy when large conference groups arrive. Want to mention that Albert Gijon at the reception was super great. Set up all the dinners reservation, properly guided me to the main tourist spots. Really helpful. 

",4,2023,09,30
36,High End Hilton in a great location for Barcelona,"If you want a balance between being in the middle of the crowded streets and being a mile from the beaches this is the place.  Has a classy mall next door, subway station 2 blocks away so you can dine outside at the various restaurants at the mall area and also catch the subway easily to any of the amazing tourist sites and Ramblas, etc.  Highly recommended!",5,2023,09,27
36,Hilton Diagonal was a super great stay!!,"Excellent stay at this beautiful Hilton! We were upgraded to an ocean view room as we are Diamond and had full access to the Executive lounge! The lounge was on the 15th floor with a spectacular view of the city! Highly recommended!
We also used the electric loaner bikes at the hotel to tour the city— they were great!!",5,2023,09,27
36,Mixed Experience,"It's 42 Euro using the Airport taxis to this hotel and 37 Euro on the way back using the taxi rank adjacent to the hotel.  On arrival we were upgraded to the executive 23rd floor with a lovely room which was much appreciated.  Room serviced daily, large tv and discovered channels 042 and 049 had pretty regular English language movies.
First 3 days here were excellent, delightful staff, wonderful breakfast and a 5 minute walk down to a pleasant beach.
Next 3 days were a challenge as the hotel was packed with conference delegates.  Queue for breakfast and once admitted the place was a complete scrum.  Tried the Executive lounge but the breakfast offering there was very poor.  Queue for lift, one of which was permanently out of service.  Space at the pool, which by the way is run by a third party, was at a premium.  Music was loud and was of the acquired taste variety!  Smoking permitted so you endure the pollution that selfish others spread around you.  The pool area was the most unsatisfactory  experience of our stay.
Overall this was a mixed experience.  Would we return, yes but not when the property is hosting a conference.",4,2023,09,20
36,Pool area policies are anti guest,"The location was fine, metro and bus stops close by. 
My beef is the pool area.
Went to relax one afternoon and was ushered to one side of the pool and I asked to go to the other side and was told that it was for paying customers. 
I am a guest at the hotel, isn’t that paying?

They sell spots at their pool to people staying at other hotels who want a nice pool area. What happens is the waiters cater to them. It took us forever to get food, drink at the pool and we were staying there. That really rubbed me wrong.

The elevators are so slow. It seemed only two were working.

The restaurants on the main floor had nasty employees. We asked to see the menu and were treated rudely by a server.

The only saving grace was a good buffet breakfast. We had the choice of going to the executive level or public level. The executive level had a limited offering so we went to the other.",3,2023,09,12
36,Love this hotel and location!!!,"This was fantastic! Checkin, my stay, hotel amenities, breakfast ALL GREAT!! The hotel is a close walk across the street to the beach. There is a huge mall across the street as well with tons of stores. The workers here are phenomenal and we’re super helpful. There is a Michelin star restaurant on premise. The breakfast was amazing!! It was something I looked forward to everyday. The room is beautiful, great views! Do not overlook this hotel. I will stay here 10000 times over! Thank you Hilton! You are always the best!!",5,2023,09,08
36,Too much noise from elevator,"Nice hotel, nice location, good breakfast, nice, big and comfortable room, but extreme noise from the elevators. (Room 2101). In the beginning we thought the hotel were located close to an airport. It sounded like an airplane was taking off every time one of the elevators moved. It was not possible to sleep there without earplugs. The elevator system is a story for itself. Four elevators are too little on such a big hotel, and it does not help when one of them are out of function. It was also extremely ineffective the way it allocates what elevator to stop at each respective floor. We ended up walking the stairs from floor 21 a few times instead of waiting for an elevator.... We were also asked for full price for the room even when the pool was unavailable for guests one of the afternoons, due to private arrangement. Very disappointing. The pool area was the main reason to pick Hilton Diagonal Mar. Neither elevator noise nor the lack of access to the pool area was taken seriously by the receptionist. Bad experience from a hotel that asks for quite high rate for the rooms. ",2,2023,09,08
36,Near the beach and across from Diagonal Mar mall. ,"We stayed here for 1 night during our visit to Barcelona. Such a nice hotel, very modern, with a great pool area and gym.
If you are looking for a good high end hotel close to the beaches of Barcelona, this is a great option. There is a huge mall right across from the hotel where you can find a wide variety of food and bar options.
Breakfast was delicious as usual, a big buffet with local and international dishes. 
My favorite part was the pool deck, although I believe the jacuzzi was not working, the water was very cold.
We got a beautiful room overlooking the sea, my only complain was that the huge tv screen was blocking the view, I would suggest relocating it because you had to stand behind the tv in order to look at the ocean.
the hotel is a good location if you want to be close to the beach and the metro, the Maresme/forum station is only a few mins away.",4,2023,09,07
36,Very good experience at Hilton,"Everything was perfect at Hilton. Staff was ver helpfull, room very clean, food perfect for kids.

I needed to change room to have another view and all of the sudden, 3 persons from staff came to help. 

All in all it was a pleasant stay. I will come back",5,2023,08,27
36,Horrific experience at Hilton Diagonal,The lifts in this hotel is an absolute joke. I’m actually traumatised by my experience in this hotel. Lifts never worked and I was scared most of the time of either getting stuck / getting harmed by it. If this happens for just one day I would have said May be to give it more time but after the 4th day it was even worse. The staff at the reception very rude and condescending. The receptionist told me to wait until 6pm (2hrs after check-in time) for my room to be ready or pay an additional amount for a new room. I was travelling alone and knew no one in Barcelona. Absolutely horrific! Staff at breakfast room kept giving my table to other guests. It didn’t happen once in one day. This was when I knew there was a problem in this place. Shocking to say the least. Take your money somewhere else,1,2023,08,27
36,Lifts from hell! Stay somewhere else.,"The lifts in this hotel are beyond parody and are actually a safety concern. 
The issue is there are only 4 lifts servicing the entire hotel and one or two of the four are usually out of service as the lifts aren’t your normal type and are ran by a computer system that regularly breaks down when too many people ask it to the same thing at the same time. 
We waited 20 mins most days for a lift at busy periods of the day, then the queue backs up and is huge and 20 people try and cram into a lift designed to safely hold 12 people. 
This is a disaster waiting to happen! 
All in all, if you’re staying on a high floor, anything 5th floor and above expect a lot of stress 👍",1,2023,08,22
36,Close to the beach.,"It's an alright average hotel. The location isn't the best. Far from city center and I had to hope on the bus or taxi to get to where all the restaurants are. It's nice that it's close to the mall. I was able to get some essential items at a good price, without having to pay city city prices. Another plus is that this hotel is close the beach.. walkable. That is the best thing about this hotel compared to the other Hiltons in Barcelona. The rooftop pool was nice, but it was quite small and hard to get a seat near the pool. Plus there were always children splashing in the pool. I preferred being at the peach. Travis at the pool was amazing. The executive breakfast was also very delicious. If I need an escape out of the city, maybe I'd come here again. I'm glad I chose this hotel for the beginning of my time in Barcelona. It was a good welcome.",4,2023,08,20
36,Not a great experience,"Several issues with this facility. Booked thru AMEX with the Fine Hotels and Resort benefit. Positives-Great Location close to beach and Diagonal Mar Mall. Breakfast is great if you have that benefit. Negatives-room was average, definitely overpriced. Elevators are an issue. Several times had to walk to other floors to get an elevator.  We had a $100 room credit thru AMEX. Was told pool, lobby grocery and restaurants were eligible. Used express checkout (do not use this). Were not given credit for any of our room charges $96. Would recommend using Hyatt or Crowne Plaza if you truly want a Fine Hotel and Resort",3,2023,08,20
36,Highly recommend,"I'm a Hilton Diamond member, and I have to say that this is the best Hilton property I have stayed at. The facility is beautiful. The pool area, which is more like a spa, is the best I've ever been to. The views of the Mediterranean and the city are gorgeous. The breakfast was more than a run of the mill buffet - they had a chef preparing made to order omelets, and mimosas on ice. The staff bent over backwards to make me feel valued. As an example, we arrived at 9 am for a 4 pm check in, and the hotel prioritized our room for a speedy check in, held our bags to give us an opportunity to explore the city, and called us when the room was ready. It's a 2 minute walk to the beach, a 12 euro cab ride to downtown and, as i said, an amazing staff.   ",5,2023,08,19
36,Hilton does not return check in deposits easily,"I have recently stayed at the Hilton Diagonal Mar, Barcelona booked via booking.com. I am very disappointed as I was advised to leave a deposit by Hilton during the check in and they have still not refunded this deposit during the check out and despite my few requests. Booking.com seems to be acting just as a mediator in terms of sending my messages to the hotel. Hence, I feel there is total lacxk of transparency from both the parties- I will not use booking.com in future as this is miserable service.",1,2023,08,16
36,Superb hotel happy to return after some years,"I have stayed at this hotel many times. From font desk through tonthe fabulous Executive lounge, it's always a great stay. Negatives the elevators are an issue as when the hotel is full, you can wait ages. The rooms really need a refurb. They haven't changed in years. Positives lovely location near the beach and not too difficult to get into the City. The breakfast restaurant is huge, and the selection is utterly amazing.

The pool is a great plus.

Will definitely return",5,2023,08,15
36,Exceptional service,"After injuring my foot (not hotel's fault), I could not believe what exceptional service the management team offered us. They could not have tried to do more and we are very grateful to all of the team for their support. From Antonio, Head of Operations, to Konstantin, Commercial Director and Christopher, Guest Relations, I just wanted to say a special thanks and please keep up the great work. The hotel is amazing and I would recommend the Puro pool to anyone who wants to chill with some great people and wicked vibes!
Thanks again team and looking forward to seeing you again soon.",5,2023,08,11
36,LIFTS INCREDIBLY SLOW,"Nice hotel, typical American chain hotel style, good breakfast buffet, and located close to the beach and not too far from the city centre. 

BUT horrendously slow lifts. Four lifts (only three in service) is not enough for a 22-storey building! Frequently waited several minutes for an available lift. 

Hotel not recommended for the elderly or for young families for this reason. ",3,2023,08,10
36,Clean and comfortable hotel,Great location with mall across the road and beach literally few minute walk away. Metro is also close by and very easy to use.Very nice pool area. Exec lounge has some nice drink options although the coffee is pretty terrible. Rooms were very clean and house keeping very efficient. Lifts are being upgraded and little bit of a pain but nothing that affected stay terribly. ,5,2023,08,10
36,Excellent services!!!,"We had a wonderful time at Hilton Diagonal Mar! Everyone was extremely helpful and friendly, from David in Executive Lounge to the entire team at breakfast!!! We felt like everyone knew us and we were part of the family!!! We will definitely be back!!!",5,2023,08,09
36,Very nice hotel,"Great location right across from large mall with 20 places to eat an imax theater and open spaces if you have kids there is a place for them to play. The physical hotel it self was very nice. I loved the deep soaker tub and the hand held and rain shower. Be careful if you have any physical ailments the tub is deep narrow and slippery!!!! There is a hand rail and I still had an issue getting out. A one hour soak listening to jazz and drinking a glass of wine made it worth the bother but again be wary. The view was nice and the bed was comfortable. There was a 50 inch tv but bring downloads if you do not speak spanish - I only found three channels in english and they were British and American News and one French news channel. The outside area was nice but the staff there were odd acting. ( to me anyway) The rest of the staff were great. Use google transcription to ask the housekeeping for what you want and they will get it for you.
I stayed three days and it was a nice visit. There is a can stand and bus stop right outside the hotel so that adds to the convenience. I was with a group of 12 and everyone enjoyed it.",4,2023,08,07
36,Apathetic Unethical Unresponsive Management,"I checked in for one night and told the front desk I might extend a night, to which they said no problem. The first room was a Diamond member upgrade to a beautiful ocean view. The following morning, I extended via the app and called in-house reservations to say I would like to stay in the same room if possible. It wasn't possible, no problem. Room changes happen. I waited another hour for a new room assignment. I picked up the key at the front desk. Immediately upon arriving in the new space, I knew I could not stay there because it was close to the pool area, which the hotel contracts as a day club, including a DJ playing loud club music. I called the in-house reservations back to explain again I needed a place to work and that I did not need a view of the beach. After another 45 minutes of waiting, I called again and was told no other rooms were available. I accepted this and informed staff that I would need to check out since quiet rooms were unavailable at Diagonal Mar. Since my bags had yet to be transferred to the room, we agreed that I could check out and no Hilton Honors points would be deducted for the night since they could not provide what I needed. I waited in the lobby for the bell staff to bring my bags down from the first room for an hour. The team called a taxi for me, and I departed. When I arrived at my next hotel, I emailed the Hilton Diagonal Mar to remind them that we mutually agreed to the change. As of today, they still need to respond.

The next day I received a checkout notice. I called the hotel to remind them that I did not stay and to what we had agreed, and I requested a call back from the manager on duty: No response from management.

I was charged points for the night and accommodation taxes, even though I did not stay at the hotel and was only in the room waiting for reservations to respond. I was out before check-in by 2 hours. 

I am a Hilton Honors Diamond member and expect, at the very least, a courtesy response and points reinstatement to my account. I have neither of these. I don't know if it's apathy, bad management, or dishonest business practice, but I cannot offer a good review of this hotel overall. The staff and the restaurant and bar were excellent, but the management and reservations representative ruined my hotel experience. I hope Hilton takes note of the lack of ethical business practices on the part of this hotel's management. Be careful if you need a place to work quietly; it's not guaranteed.",2,2023,08,04
36,Good Location shame about the hotel,"This hotel is well located by the sea and there's a mall across the road. There are loads of places to eat. The hotel itself needs a bit of updating especially the bathrooms. There's black mould in the bathrooms. When we brought it to the attention of the head housekeeper and  it was quickly rectified. Old sealant was removed and replaced. Lifts are a problem at this hotel. You may have to wait up to 3mins for the lift to arrive. The executive lounge had a great view but evening refreshments are limited. Breakfast was ok. Having stayed at the Hilton Bomonti in Istanbul in June, unfortunately there's no competition. It beats Barcelona hands down! I've stayed in a lot of Hiltons and this was way below expectation unfortunately.",3,2023,08,01
36,Elevators are slow,"We had a company retreat here.  Elevators are a bit of a nightmare.  You have to choose your floor from outside the elevator and there is no rhyme or reason on how you are assigned one of the 4 elevators that I can tell.  Plus only 3 seemed to actually work. Sometimes you wait more than 10 minutes....they encourage you to use the stairs but I was on the 11th floor and the staircases are a bit on the unpleasant side as far as smell goes.  The staff seems really nice and the bar staff in particular was great.  Food was so so and most places close by are chains like Five Guys and McDonalds.  Hands down the worst coffee in a hotel I've ever had.  Rooms were fine...mine overlooked the mall.  But my air con seemed to stop working the last night I was there.  Also the bathrooms could use a refresh....huge tub/shower combo with a seperate shower.  The stand alone shower was small but now shower curtain on the combo so you are sort of forced to use the small shower.  Not someplace I'd choose on my own for a stay in Barcelona...too far from everything
",3,2023,07,31
36,"Close, but not next to the sea","The website says a 5 minute walk to the beach, and this is true. A casual 5 minute stroll will get you to the beach.
However, the first part of the beach is gated off and is for people with dogs. I'd avoid that section. The next section is a bit rocky once in the sea, but good for snorkelling with fins. If you walk about 5 minutes more down the beach, you get to a more family friendly place with more sand, and it is easier to get in and out of the sea.
If you want a sea view room, make sure you ask for a high room at the side facing the sea. These rooms are great, and waking up and looking out over the sea from the bed was lovely. The rooms to the side of the hotel are also classed as ""Sea View"" but you only get the view from one side of the room looking out at an angle, and from the bed all we got to see was other Hotels and Office blocks. These should be classed as partial sea view rooms, not sea view.
We had some problems at the Hotel and brought them to the attention of Rick from Guest Relations, and Sandra who was the Housekeeping Manager and both of them were excellent. They bent over backwards to sort them out and we felt as though we were valued customers. If you have an issue, definitely tell someone. Not the front of desk staff, but supervisor or manager and I am sure they will fix it for you.
Lastly, the Diagonal de Mar shopping centre is literally across the road and is much bigger than it looks from the outside. The cinema shows plenty of English language films. Lots of food options on the first level. And across the road from the back entrance of the Mall, on the side with the tram tracks, is a small café called the L'Illa de Mar. We asked for a jug of Sangria with spirits and spent a lovely evening sat outside watching the world go by for 11 Euros (for the whole jug). Lovely!",4,2023,07,24
36,Great location- poor service = poor experience,"1) pool area - not made clear that you have to book and if busy have to pay €43/each  to make reservation or miss out ! 
2) Executive Lounge - nice place but poor service. Snacks very poor and food very limited. Took a ginger ale 10 mins after the happy hour and it was taken off me!
3) housekeeping got later and later every day. Wasn’t done till late afternoon.
4) ran out of hand wash , had to make three call and finally oh tit after over 8 hour wait!
5) Registered my complaint to the duty manager (Benjamin) who promised to get back to me on what he could do ….but never got back to me and wasn’t available when I asked at desk next day.",3,2023,07,22
36,Poor pool,Not for families.  Pool not part of hotel and beds for guests limited.  Party hotel at weekends with awful lounge music and gucci bucket hat crowd and champagne showers.   On booking it looks like the pool is always available it is not. Hotel very generic though that’s Barcelona these days generic not very Spanish at all,3,2023,07,18
36,Not worth the money,"Breakfast hot meal buffet (bacon sausage eggs etc) was anything but hot everyday ….the lifts were a nightmare, everyone complained and it became a standing joke and the music booming out of the pool area until 4am Saturday evening / Sunday morning terrible……",2,2023,07,16
36,NOT family hotel and rude staff,"This hotel is recommended by the cruise line we went on. This is NOT a family hotel.   We got to the hotel at 8:30 am and were told our room would not be ready until 4:00 pm.   This is a ridiculous check in time and the front desk people are only able to tell us this.   There is no way for them to put in for a text when our rooms are ready.   They did give us access to the executive lounge and the pool, but really, they know people are coming off this cruise and will be checking in.   They should be able to turn around the rooms faster than 4 hours after check in and to notify you when your room is ready.  It would save them a ton of trouble if they texted when the room is ready rather than have people coming up every hour and asking.   It is 2023, their system should be able to notify.  
POOL:
The pool area is full of people who are drinking and there is loud club music playing.   It is great for young people looking to party.   But not for families.   The pool is deep - 5 feet, so young kids can not easily swim.   In addition they have pool attendants that assign seats and literally track you in and out of the pool area.   We are not accustomed to being tracked like this in the US.    We were put in the lounge area and ordered water and a Diet Coke.   Upon leaving I paid for this at the cashier in the lounge area, where we were sitting and my daughter went to turn in the towels.   One of the pool attendants in charge of tracking our every move at the the towel drop off told her we did not pay for our order, she told her I was paying right now and the girl insisted we did not.   My daughter walked toward me and the girl literally snapped her fingers at us.  Uhhh…. When I turned around she still said we did not pay.   I told her that I just paid the other girl.  She said, it does not show that in the system.   I got a little irritated as it was now 3:30 and we still did not have a room and told her to go and ask the other cashier, I would wait here.   She said “Don’t come at me, I am not accusing you” but that is exactly what she was doing - accusing me of trying to leave with out paying and I was not coming at her, I was completely calm.  She was told I did pay and I turned around a left.   I mean really, they had my name, if they found I did not pay they could have called the room rather than accuse a customer.  

ROOM and CHECK IN:
We booked TWO rooms and upon check in was told that I had 3 rooms.   Hmmm… I said, no we booked 2 king rooms with a pullout sofa or a cot.   I literally called the day before my cruise to confirm.   The front desk person said, well there are 3 here and we can not cancel one now as they are paid for.   Another family next to us had the same issue.   This seems to be a scam but I did not have the energy to argue and will deal with over charges with my CC company.  We took the 3 rooms, but they were not needed for the 15 hours we would be there.   

When we got the rooms, sure enough there was a cot in the in king room.  The rooms need to be renovated.   There was mold or something on the shower door and the furniture was beat up.   The bed - not comfortable at all. 
And the club music at the pool kept us awake all night.   I will say the view was great from our room. 

CHECK OUT:
Upon check in, I was told I had to give them a card for any charges and for the tourist hotel tax - alright no problem.   He charged my card $100 and said when I check out they would refund anything we did not spend.  Upon check out he asked me for another card for our charges.   When I said, I already gave them one and they charged $100 he said, well not on this room.   I said, no I am not giving you another card.   He got snippy with me and said fine, let me look.   Why wouldn’t he look in the first place and why does a front desk person have the audacity to have attitude with a customer?  And when I asked for him to refund the difference, he said “ we will later” and waved me off, no receipt or anything.  Pretty sure we will not see any refund.  

Needless to say I would not recommend this hotel for any families, and I will be contacting my cruise line to recommend they no longer recommend this hotel to their passengers.   There were several other cruise families that felt the same way.   The staff needs to be taught customer service.   They seem to not want American customers as I did notice they reacted and were short with most of the Americans.   

My family spent a week before the cruise in Barcelona and had a fantastic experience with everyone we came in contact with.   We really enjoyed the city and all the people.   This hotel was for sure the exception. ",2,2023,07,16
36,Not a good Hilton stay,Our stay  in June 2023 resulted in possibly being exposed to black mold in our assigned hotel room inside and outside of the shower. We are in communications with Hilton to get a copy of the spore testing. Hilton stated the rooms were inspected and mold was not identified but a sample need to be taken of the growth and tested. We have asked Hilton for the mold test results report. We are waiting for a response from Hilton.,1,2023,07,11
36,Good value for the money,"Nice hotel, easy access to beach. 
Do Not take Taxis use Uber only while in Barcelona as taxis overcharge and are expensive. 
Executive lounge is amazing for food and drinks!! Nice view though it has a row of buildings between the hotel and sea. Overall good location. AC in room is ok not the best and bathrooms are dated. Gets pretty busy on weekends.",4,2023,07,08
36,Questioning their sanitary habits at the restaurant ,"Great hotel with easy access to beach, metro, shopping etc but I question the kitchen practices. My husband ordered a burger from the pool bar well done. It came raw and sent it back. They took his partially eaten burger and put it back on the grill to cook it instead of sending out a new one. Are they doing that with other grilled items and other food. I was repulsed by that. He obviously did not eat the burger and we did not ask to have it removed from our bill.  I let management know but nothing was really said. I wouldn't want others eating from that same grill. From there are out, we did not eat at the hotel. ",2,2023,07,05
36,Family stay,"Amazing hotel great location, clean and friendly staff with great breakfast.

Executive lounge open long hours with variety of drinks and great views.

Breakfast had a good selection of fruits and hot food with two omelet stands.

Great experience and location near the beach and opposite a shopping mall.",5,2023,07,05
36,Outstanding Hotel,"Great stay for our 20th wedding anniversary, staff couldn't be better and went out of their way to make the occasion special. The exec lounge for those that had access was brilliant (although it could open a little later as closes at 8pm). The rooms were incredible, with fabulous see views and the breakfast choice was brilliant. The pool/ Purobeach was an incredible space although it does get overbooked at peak times (they should hold more spaces back for residents) and despite arriving at open time we had a sub optimal location, under cover. The staff did address this brilliantly however and moved us as soon as they could. Only other critique would be the lift and we spent allot of time waiting at peak times. I would thoroughly recommend though",5,2023,06,30
36,Wonderful Experience. ,"As a frequent Hilton traveler, this is by far the best Hilton I have stood at. 
From start to finish,  my stay was absolutely fantastic. 
When you enter, front desk is very welcoming, efficient, and lively. Isabel at the front desk was fantastic and so helpful. She found out it was my birthday from my passport and made my stay extra special. My room was set up with balloons, rose petals, and a happy birthday sign. I felt so well taken care of.

The hotel has wonderful amenities, views, and food! I had breakfast twice there and was fully impressed at the selection of food. There was also cappuccinos always ready to be made by staff in the lobby. The beds were extremely comfortable, rooms were inviting and had beautiful decor. We were on the 22nd floor, and the views were FANTASTIC. I saw the sunrise from my room and was able to take a look at the beach before heading down. 

Truly, it was such a wonderful stay, I have zero complaints. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone and will definitely be returning. ",5,2023,06,29
36,The myth of the panorama suite,"To start with the good, the room was very large and clean. The hotel is in a good location and the staff were very warm and pleasant. The room allowed access to the executive lounge with breakfast and a happy hour with snacks drinks etc. 

Our stay could have been wonderful but it wasn’t. My disappointment stems primarily from the “Panorama” description. The view was the only reason I selected the room. The view was extremely disappointing. The pictures don’t fully convey how distracting the buildings in the view were. We were on the 16th floor and these “panorama” suites are located on floors 16-21. If a view is important to you, don’t accept this room on a floor below 20. Perhaps a room on the north end of the building would be better (we were on the southeast corner) as there are no tall buildings in that direction. I immediately returned to check in and was told no other rooms were available. Of note, we arrived early from a cruise and our room was not ready. Completely understandable. I was told they would telephone us when ready. They never did. We came back after 1pm and were again told not ready. The receptionist gave us a card to access the lounge so we didn’t have to continue roaming Barcelona in the heat. We appreciated that very much. But again, no call. We eventually went back down and were told the room was ready. Upon entering, we found our sofa pulled out and made up. In a room booked for two people. This may sound conspiratorial but I think we got a room that may have been meant for a family that was hanging out in the check in area and therefore difficult to ignore whereas we were out of sight and out of mind. I bet that family probably had to have their sofa made up.

Anyway, the guest relations gentleman explained there was nothing to be done as no actual panorama views were available. He chuckled at my suggestion that perhaps the wording could be changed so that one would not expect an actual panoramic view. He did send a bottle of champagne and some chocolates which I thought was nice. When I went to the lounge for happy hour I saw the same champagne on offer gratis. Not to sound ungrateful but it really wasn’t any skin off their noses to send the champagne. I could have had as much as I wanted anyway. 

On our departure, we had to leave for our flight by 0715. We went down to the lounge for breakfast at 0700 (per the information provided by check in) thinking we could grab a muffin or croissant but they weren’t ready. Fortunately coffee was. When we left at 0715 still not ready.  

I would not stay here again. We paid over 1100 euros and saw the office buildings next door. There are other options in this price range with unobstructed views. Again, that was THE reason for choosing the room. ",2,2023,06,27
36,"Nice hotel, nice reviews, but elevator issues and unexpected charges","Booked 2 rooms for 2 nights (diamond member) - nice hotel, good location and amazing hotel room view (upgraded room) but - elevator noise all night, elevators very slow - 4 of them but took up to 3-4 minutes regularly for it to arrive and sometimes longer to get elevator allocated (tried multiple times), 1 upgraded room was a free upgrade as a diamond member, we had to pay for the other (despite diamond member booking both), was told it would be 70 EUR, was not told that was per night - had understood it was for total stay - so payed more than we expected)",3,2023,06,25
36,Fantastic,"I just wanted to say thank you very much for the entire team that looked after me during my staying in Barcelona. 

I wanted to stay even more. I did try but the hotel was full.

Your hotel is so beautiful, charming and I definitely have to come back to check out your Michelin Star Restaurant. ⭐️

I also want to say thank you in special for all the front desk team and the guys who helps with the luggage’s, house keeping too who always made sure that my room was impeccable.

Linda, Isabel and Jessica from the reception team are just fantastic. Thank you so much. 

Breakfast was beautiful, lots of options and fresh orange juice which is my favourite. I sat at the same table every day by the balcony.

Nadeela and Fatima were very kind, attentive and professional at breakfast.

Thank you.

I’ll definitely to come back and stay for more days.

Keep the good work with love and effort.

Big hugs,

36,Great but...,"I had a great view of the Sea, and nice big room. The ventilation system was good (which matters a lot to me!). The staff was courteous and professional. However, the hotel had the absolutely worst elevator system I have ever encountered. It often broke down and/or took over 10 minutes to come. For this reason, I would reconsider staying there again. Not a fan of getting stranded in elevators, no matter how much I liked everything else ",4,2023,06,11

36,"Great Location, excellent Hotel","The Hilton is very well situated being opposite a shopping centre and many restaurants and very close to the exhibition centre.  The hotel itself is what you would expect from a full service Hilton, the staff were friendly and efficient and the rooms were of the standard expected of a Hilton Hotel.  Breakfast was very good, plenty of choice and very attentive staff.   Wi-Fi nice and fast, the corner room I had came with a separate bath and shower.  The only problem I experienced was the new elevator system that kept breaking down, it was more of a delay than not having any working elevators but it was disappointing this issue persisted all week.",5,2023,05,30
36,Disappointing,"Do not book this hotel!! At any time that we stayed 2 out of 4 elevators (23 floors!!) did not work at all, we sometimes waited for 15-20 minutes to get down!! The lobby was over crowded for check in and check out, it took us 30 minutes to check in because of a young and inexperienced clerk, the rooms need refurbishment and the prices in relation to the above are outrageous.
Do not go until they settle all their problems!",2,2023,05,28
36,"Good hotel but constant Billing Issues, Far from ‘Spain’ Look & Feel","Excellent hotel grounds, as one would expect. 

But as with so many other review, the billing at this hotel is an absolute nightmare.

 They authorise to your card every morning at 1am - no idea why... over and over and over again. Somehow, my EUR374 check-out bill was charged 4 times and the last time for EUR800. INSANE, and I would highly recommend you avoid them because if this. STAY FAR AWAY except if you have money in your accounts to waste. Charges still not released despite phone calls, emails and messages. I almost took a taxi back to the hotel to try sort it out. Actually, I should have if I had the time to waste.

Disregarding their billing incompetence.. this is what I would review:

Not entirely convinced the extra spend on a King Room, Sea Facing, is worth it. Colleagues on lower levels also had a good view.  

Rooms are of great size for European hotels.   

Fantastic conference venue! .

Ask any occupant of the hotel what they biggest pain was, and the answer will be the elevators. 10-15 min wait from the 23 floor.. take a room lower and the wait may be a small bit shorter. Needs attention - urgently.

  For the smokers, nice area, under cover, outside but in front of the main restaurant/bar.  

They wanted EUR45 p/p for lounging at the one side of the pool - insane. The smaller section without that charge was acceptable. With a conference on the go, they closed that at 3pm daily.. massive disappointment.  

Taxis readily available in front of the hotel.. but they'll likely not accept your Freenow app request if it's not to the airport. You must ask the next taxi in the queue to drive you - or just get public transport pass.. TMB works exceptionally well. 

  It's a typical Hilton hotel - pricey at on-site restaurants and bars.  Excellent shopping centre across the road though - buy bottled water here rather.   

Executive Lounge for Honors Members - absolutely fantastic. Breakfast in a quiet area, sundowners on the 15th floor deck. Good job!",3,2023,05,26
36,Lifts!,"Spent 3 nights at the hotel, was on the 20th floor...had to wait on average 20 minutes for the lifts - due to problems with an upgrade we had to use the service lifts too.  Have no idea why the upgrade wasn't tested before being implemented, people were getting stuck in the lifts - situation was completely out of contol!",2,2023,05,22
36,"Beautiful, modern hotel but location is further out.","The Hilton Diagonal Mar is a modern, high-rise hotel in what looks to be a business area of Barcelona. The hotel itself is beautiful and the views from the upper floors amazing.  The bed was very comfortable with high-quality linens.  The bathroom was elegant. The executive lounge is wonderful and offers happy hour each day from 5:00-7:00. The pool area is stunning with highly-controlled access.  However, I'd like to add a few cautions - although the hotel says it is within 10 minutes walking of the beach, we did not feel it was in  a beach community.  Our misinterpretation. Instead, the area seems quite high-tech, industrial.  The hotel gives a ""business"" feel (it was host for a medical convention when we were there) and several professionals could be seen working hard on their computers and their upcoming presentations. The hotel has very modern, contemporay vibes matching more of a hip crowd.  There is a mall across the street with restaurants and shopping but if you want more of the ""walk out the door and enjoy Barcelona"" feel, I'd choose a hotel more in the city center.  We stayed the first part of the week in such a city hotel  (a Hilton boutique hotel) and absolutely loved it, being able to walk to many of the tourist sites. Although we enjoyed the Hilton Diagonal Mar for the latter part of our week in Barcelona, we found it to be further out than we expected and not as ""beachy"" as we thought.  (However, taxi's were easily available). Just keep all of this in mind when choosing your ideal Barcelona hotel.",5,2023,05,21
36,One of the Best Hiltons ever,"Our first nights on our first trip to Barcelona. I picked this hotel because I stay at Hilton branded properties when I can, I’m a Diamond member. This hotel is a little out of the main drag but totally accessible by Metro service. When I arrived the front desk was welcoming and prompt. I couldn’t believe the room I was upgraded to. It was one of the nicest rooms I’ve ever been in. The Panorama Suite on floor 16. Wow! A triple size room with a bedroom, living room, and dining room. A wraparound view of the ocean and city including La Sagrada Familia. We enjoyed the Executive Lounge each night with great snacks, beer and serve yourself cocktails. Had breakfast one morning at the lounge. It was good. The next 2 mornings went to the main breakfast room. It was AMAZING! Great service, great food, great selections. Also, was constantly impressed by how hard working and professional the entire staff is at this hotel. That’s what makes a vacation great . I also loved the ice and water machines by the elevator. Nice touch. The staff made the extra effort at every opportunity to thank me for being a Diamond member. If you travel to Barcelona and don’t stay here you are missing out ",5,2023,05,08

36,Okay but admin is awful and followup doesnt exist.,"Nice room, view and the service was good except.  Location was okay especially as i was attending a conference
Trying to sort out the bill and administration is a nightmare. Both my colleagues and i spoke to reception while i was in the hotel and they said it would be sorted . On checkout i identified the conference room rate again and they said they would rectify the bill and forward the receipt. Despite trying to follow up they continuously don't
So watch your room rate and be prepared to check out as they wont fix it. Maybe it just a new way of getting their margins up at the customers expense",3,2023,05,04
36,Diamond Member Disaster,"I am an Hilton Diamond member and travel extensively. 

We reserved 3 nights using Hilton Honors points and checked in on line using the Hilton app, selected a room and indicated we would arrive after 10pm and ordered a digital key. 

We arrived at the hotel and was told  our reservation had been cancelled because we arrived after midnight. 

I told the front desk I’d checked in on line many times with arrival times after midnight and my reservation has never been cancelled at any other Hilton property. 

So here we are at a hotel without a reservation. The front desk said they could not reserve a room with points and we had to pay for the room. An expense we had not anticipated. 

We were told it was our mistake because we did not arrive before midnight. WHAT!! And we were charged a no show fee!! Are you kidding me. 

We gave them a credit card to pay for the room.  We were given a very nice room with a sea view. 

But it gets worse. 

When we arrived back home, we checked our accounts and found there was a charge from the hotel for another 3 nights on a different card. WHAT!! The charge was made on a credit card that I had on file in my Hilton profile and did not authorize the charge. 

I called the Diamonds desk and opened a file for research to get a refund. 

The very next day I received a message from the hotel again telling me it was my fault and they could not help me. 

I spent the next few days sending emails to the hotel and no one would respond. I finally got fed up and copied a number of Hilton executives on the email and guess what,  I got immediate responses. 

But it doesn’t end here. 

I received the refund as promised on one of the credit cards but not on the other. 

Again many days of back and forth with promises of a refund. Nothing. 

Finally after almost a month of stress, emails and phone calls, I received the refund I was promised. 

A few things about this that I hope Hilton resolves for other guests going forward. 

If the hotel offers on line check in using the app, guests reservations should not be cancelled based on when they arrive at the hotel. The process is in place so travelers feel confident they have a room and the reservation should be secure. 

If the hotel doesn’t honor on line check in don’t have it as an option. 

Again, the hotel resolved the issues and finally refunded all of my money, gave us Hilton points and a free night at the hotel. 

I’m not sure if I’ll continue to stay at Hilton properties in the future because I do not feel valued as a customer.",2,2023,04,25
36,Felt unwelcome due to young age,"Arrived at the hotel after a delayed flight really looking forward to a Hilton service (one of the main reasons we booked this hotel). On arrival we were ignored by concierge who instead choose to help a mother/daughter party who were slightly older than us. We were gestured away from the main check in desk to one slightly further up - despite there being multiple people in line we were the only party told to use an alternative desk. We were checked in by Albert who seemed preoccupied and proceeded to answer several phone calls and other queries at the desk whilst in the middle of our check in. Once in our room we had issues with the safe, we called down and maintenance changed the batteries but advised security would need to reset the pin. We presumed that security would then follow, after 20 mins of waiting we called down to reception (waiting around 5-7 mins on our call being answered which is shocking given calls were answered during our check in). Eventually this issue was resolved. I noted in the special requests that it was my partners birthday weekend away (previous Hilton’s we have stayed at have graciously shown good will but this was ignored at this hotel). We booked a pool view but as you can see from the photos I wouldn’t go so far which was disappointing given the extra money spent. My partner has Hilton Honours Gold status although we booked through Booking.com as it was £150 cheaper… beginning to wonder if we should have paid to receive better service. Rooms were clean and bed very comfy but sadly service ruined our overall feeling.",3,2023,04,25

One major benefit for us is the large pool area - we have found other city hotels only have a plunge pool with limited sunbeds, which are never available -especially if you turn up later in the day and just want a couple of hours in the sun. The pool at the Hilton is branded as Puro Beach and is ideal for sun seekers with plenty of sunbeds always available at no extra charge to hotel guests. We just love the fact there is none of the painful and annoying grabbing and reserving of sunbeds business!- they are the only guys putting towels on sunbeds and it's great! They also do a good choice of food and drinks with waiter service which you can just charge to the room.
The hotel is opposite a large shopping centre which has all the popular spanish clothing brands, but is also super handy for the beach if you want a beach day.
Take just a few stops (with no changes required) on the metro for the centre of Barcelona or there is also a tram station at the back of the shopping centre which can whizz you a few stops up the Diagonal to the Glories area and beyond with lots more shops and a great flea market. Ticket bundles are so cheap and you can use them across metro, tram and bus. 
You can walk into PobleNou really easily from the hotel - the Ramblas there is charming with lots of restaurants to choose from and we find it more authentic than the main touristy city centre Ramblas. There is a great scooter hire place in PobleNou too - very reasonable and you can rent for a few hours to zip along the whole sea front all the way down to the W Hotel and back.
Last but not least are the Hilton staff - housekeeping work incredibly hard to keep things spotlessly clean, Victor and the reception staff are really efficient and friendly. The executive lounge is well worth paying extra for all the benefits you get. The breakfast there is much quieter than the main restaurant - it's like having your own private dining room - Celia did an excellent job looking after us, she is an absolute star! Plus, between 5-7pm every day there is ""happy hour"" which includes complimentary wine, prosecco, beer and spirits as well as snacks - all which can be enjoyed on the 15th floor terrace overlooking the sea and Barcelona skyline.
When it's time to leave you can just grab a taxi from the rank literally outside the hotel and straight back to the airport for under €40. 
Thank you to all the team at Hilton Diagonal Mar - we appreciate all your hard work and can't wait to come back!

36,Comfortable hotel with great service.,"Great service, comfortable hotel. Near bus, metro and subway stations. We bought 72-hour Hola Barcelona card that proved worth the price due to the hotel location being farther away from main tourist areas. Mall across the street is convenient. As Diamond members we were upgraded to a lovely room with a better view but was smaller than our originally booked room. We were two adults and one 15 yr old. Even though the hotel was very busy with business groups the Front Dest was most understanding and quickly moved us to a different room that would accommodate a roll-away with enough space for the three of us. Lounge offered happy hour 5-7 with snacks and drinks, including alcohol and during the day coffee, tea, juice, soda, whole fruit and nuts. AC worked alright but was not the best, thankfully the window opened and weather was nice, we like a cold room! Shower pressure was alright. Wifi worked well. Breakfast was good with some different options each day. Overall a nice stay with convenient public transport to reach all areas of the city and beyond.",4,2023,04,09
36,Good for meetings but don’t expect a dinning experience.,"Starting with check in there were a lot of awkwardness; the computer at the front office didn’t work, then the receptionist forgot to give me my key, upstairs in the room bedside electric sockets didn’t work. In room dining, even charges for tray pickup (the tray sat at the corridor all night). Restaurant dinning is low quality; the fish was cold, I had to remind the patatas which was served after my main course, the cold fish! Stay away from the cheesecake. Finally, breakfast is a chaos with probably the worst ever fried eggs. On a positive note staff at banquets is super attentive. The mistake of charging double for a flip chart was rectified after I informed them.",2,2023,04,06
36,A little surprised...,"This is not our first stay in this hotel,we  have previously stayed with family and my husband has attended conferences here so we were looking forward to our return visit.  Having spent a few nights in the wonderful Alexandra Curio we decided to venture closer to the beach. Although the location is a little further from the main tourist attractions it is still well situated and across from the sea.  There is a taxi rank just beside the hotel and an excellent shopping centre directly across from the hotel which provides lots of dining and shopping options.
We arrived slightly early at the hotel so left our bags to go out sightseeing.  You must check out Poble Nou Cemetery which is about a 30 min walk away.  Our greeting at the front desk was friendly and professional  and as Hilton diamond members we have recieved an upgrade. Our room was 1708 on the 17th floor. It was a decent sized room, with a comfy bed, a decent sized bathroom including a bath and nice views of the sea. 
The room had everything you would expect.  We were a little surprised to find that the Executive Lounge on Floor 15 only served snacks between 5-7pm and that there were few drinks of any kind bar coffee and no alcoholic drinks.   The views from the Lounge are very nice.  Breakfast is served until 10.30 and it was very good with plenty of variety..
On our first evening we were slightly taken aback at being charged €20 for two glasses of white wine but tonight while writing this review I decided to have a cup of tea. I'm not a fan of tiny uht milk or coffee creamer so asked my husband if he would pop to the bar and ask for a little milk for my bedroom tea. Given the relatively small size of the cups I didn't need much milk and in all previous hotels I have stayed in I have been provided with a small amount of milk. 
My husband returned with a small takeaway cup and said it was €5. I thought he was joking. This was more expensive than the small overpriced cappuccino I had purchased on the first evening. 
I honestly couldn't believe that a hotel would charge guests for a small cup of fresh milk to avail of the tea making facilities they provide in the room.  I wouldn't have complained if the cost was €1  or €2 however €5 is ridiculous. 
Thankfully a call to the front desk resolved this issue.  I won't let this incident put me off however I'd suggest management reconsider this ridiculous charge. ",3,2023,04,05
36,Disappointed..excepted for the service,"2 nights at the Hilton to discover Barcelona. The hotel is very nice, clean and all the personnel is very nice and kind. From the lobby to the bar and other services, people are extremely friendly. on the negative site:
- We had a room with sea vue but what you don't see on the pictures in the site from the hotel is that there are 3 buildings in from of the window. Sad because the sea vue would have been top.
- Food is very disappointing in the normal hotel restaurant. Tapas are good but we couldn't finish the Paella ..; invoiced 28 eur per person.
- We had breakfast in the room, again service very kind and good breakfast but only 1 cup of coffee. Same as the coffee machine in the room, only one coffee available and bottles of water are very expensive.
All in all, not bad but for the price of the night we could have expected more. 
Conclusion :Good stay if you just want to sleep. Eat and drink outside",3,2023,04,03
36,STAFF STEALS AND THE FOOD IS BAD,"We went to Hilton in february for business. We were also booked into the hotel next to Hilton, which was way better both in atmosphere and food. 

Hilton food was really bad, tasteless, even the fries had a sense of being cooked in the microwave.

Forgot some items when we left, I contacted the hotel, explained what I forgot and they confirmed that they in fact had these items, and said it was okay that my colleague could pick them up, as he left later on. When he tried to pick up my items they said they didn't have them.

I contacted them again, and after a lengthy correspondance, Hilton told me they would send my items. They did, but they did steal my phone charger.

Tried to contact them again, and the response time has been really really slow and now they don't want to do anything about it. Hilton apparantly honour thieves.",1,2023,04,01
36,Sea view,Nice hotel close to the sea so you can go jogging along the beach in the morning.  And it is only five minutes walk to the metro station that can take you anywhere in the city. And the breakfast is very nice.,5,2023,03,26
36,Okay stay . But not to be repeated,The hotel is in a great location . That is all about it. The breakfast is cold. The rooms are very small and look old. The lug are small and have to wait due to many people being there. The twin beds are smaller the smallest size. There is nothing called as room service. The bell boy is not there in the morning for check out Sonu have to take your bags yourself. Overall think before booking.,2,2023,03,26
36,Nice,"Well kept  hotel. They cleaned all the outside of the window while we were there. We are diamond members and had access to the executive lounge. Spirits, wine, and beer were offered. The lounge itself has an ocean and city view from the fifteen floor. Very nice canopies were offered too. 

We choose to have the breakfast in the restaurant. The usual very good european breakfast was offered. 

The hotel is across from the Diagonal mar shopping mall which has many restaurants to choose from if you don't feel like traveling. The metro L4 is a block away. Many busses and the tram connect to the area. 

We had a very good stay here.",5,2023,03,21
36,Great position and perfect service in Barcelona,"I was in Barcelona few days ago to visit my son who lives there and Hilton Diagonal Mar gave me a perfect stay and a perfect service.
Great position, with lots of restaurants near by, next to a modern boardwalk along the beach.
I really appreciated morning breakfast and also the treatment reserved for Hilton honors members.
The car park is unfortunately not run by Hilton and is expensive.
However I will definitely be back.",5,2023,03,19
36,A truly exceptional experience!!,"As a guest at Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona, all I have to say is that my experience was truly exceptional. I stayed in a 1-Bedroom Suite, on the 22nd floor of the hotel. The suite was incredibly spacious, with enough room to comfortably accommodate all of our needs. The cleanliness of the hotel was also impressive - it really felt as though every surface had been meticulously cleaned and maintained.

The breakfast buffet was a true standout. There was an impressive variety of options, from traditional Spanish specialties to more classic dishes, all of which were delicious and beautifully presented. There was also an omelette station, where you could order one according to your taste and they made it in front of you. Additionally, the room service was impeccable - our first day's in-room breakfast order was delivered promptly and with a smile.

Perhaps the most memorable aspect of our stay was the breathtaking view from our room. We were treated to a stunning panorama of the city skyline that was truly breathtaking. We could literally see the Sagrada Familia from our bed! The hotel's location was also fantastic - it was just few metro stops away from the city center, but far enough to feel peaceful and quiet.

The hotel staff were kind and accommodating, going above and beyond to make sure that our stay was as enjoyable as possible. From recommending restaurants to helping us navigate the local area, their service was truly top-notch.

Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for an unforgettable travel experience in Barcelona. From the spacious rooms to the delicious breakfast buffet and stunning views, every aspect of our stay exceeded our expectations. Cannot wait to return!!",5,2023,03,14
36,Great hotel and location for a city and beach break,"This hotel was booked as a city break.
Area... 
The hotel is on the door step of a big shopping mall (called Diagonal Mar ) with very good shops and loads of food outlets ( restaurants & fast food) its also only 5 mins walk to the metro (El Maresme / Forum) its also near the end of a beach again 5 mins walk away. The beach is massive and stretches all the way into the harbour/city (depending on fitness takes around 30 mins walk)
Hotel...
Top hotel very clean and tidy, Maria (one of the receptionist) was very helpful and made sure our stay that bit more special. always had the time of day to have a chat and help with anything, she also upgraded us up a king size see view room for free.
The rooms were cleaned every day, bed and pillows comfortable the bathroom came with a shower and a separate large bath (with a Tv built in the wall) 
We never had the breakfast or meals as the shopping centre was less than a minutes walk away and had loads of options at a fraction of the cost.

All in all great hotel and location for a city and beach break. 

",5,2023,03,14
36,Friendly people,"What lovely friendly and helpful people working at this Hilton had a great stay and Maria and Ricardo could not do enough for us very nice staff looked after us both and the hotel is near the shops and attractions 
",5,2023,03,09
36,Really nice hotel,"Just back from a 4 day stay at Hilton. Great location just out if heart of city, great service, really clean and modern. Breakfast superb. Metro 5 mins walk, and brilliant mall right next door with loads of shops and eateries. Close to beach as well. Would highly recommend",5,2023,02,20
36,"Exceptional Hotel, Staff and Convenient Location","This should be no surprise, but this hotel exceeded all expectations.  Located just a short walk from the subway stop, the beach, the mall and a number of other activities, its situated in a perfect spot.  Enjoyed a nighttime stroll on the beach and the hotel amenities were fantastic.  The breakfast buffet did not disappoint as there was such a vast array of options to choose from, making it difficult to choose what to have.  The staff here at the restaurant and also at the front desk were fantastic.  Very professional, helpful and went out of their way to make you feel comfortable and at home per se.  Definitely would stay here again should the opportunity lend itself.",5,2023,01,18
36,"Nice view, good location","Really good hotel in nice area. It’s close to the beach, but not in the city center which is good thing. Rooms were ok, especially the one with bathroom with view. Executive lounge is OK, but sadly pool area was closed, even when weather was above 15 degrees celcius. Negative thing was that rooms were ready after 16.00 which is odd.",4,2023,01,09
36,A prime example of what the Hilton brand represents!,"I've originally had a 2 night stay but given the friendliness of Stephany and the entire staff, I decided to extend my stay to 6 total nights. Upon check in I was greeted and offered free breakfast, an upgrade and lounge access as a diamond member. The lounge had a happy hour with appetizers and drinks and the view of the sunset from the lounge was unbeatable and stunning! The room was modern and extremely clean although I had trouble cooling down the room at times as the AC wasn't too cooperative so I just opened a window for a fresh breeze. The views from the room showed a spectacular sunrise and was a great start. The breakfast has an amazing selection of fresh and hot foods including a waffle and omellete station and even smoothies! I can't wait to visit again!!",5,2023,01,06
36,Beautiful property!,"Beautiful property, great location, friendly staff and lively outlets makes this place a great place to stay when you are in Barcelona. Rooms are large and spacious, self contained. Had a memorable stay! ",5,2023,01,04
36,Needs small improvements,"I enjoyed in overall the stay in this Hilton, mainly due to the fact, that the location is simply great. In close proximity to mall, restaurants, bike rentals, everything you need. Also great benefit is, that if you go by car, you can simply drive to big garages and park comfortably. They even have spots for diamond members, which I consider as very convenient. Rooms are OK, but bathrooms might need some attention, as the shower leaks and water goes everywhere. I believe the rooms has not been renovated since opening of the hotel. Also restaurant for breakfast is quite small. When full occupancy, it doesnt have enough tables and there is a line of people waiting. Lounge is renovated, however also quite small, considering the large size of the hotel. But gym OK, any outdoor facilities must be great during the summer months.",3,2023,01,01
36,Cannot be better,"Excellent choice. Feels like a brand new hotel. Friendly staff, modern facilities, good location. Everything you would expect from a 5-star hotel.

Only thing weird about it, the bed is close to the window, and there's buildings right cross. I saw some friendly locals wave at me...",5,2022,12,24
36,Fantastic view and stay - excellent value,"We had a wonderful stay at this Hilton Diagonal Mar in Barcelona on our business/couple trip. The executive lounge had outstanding service and stunning views inside and on the patio. We are recent Hilton Diamond Club Members as we have elite status that we normally use with another desirable hotel group. The lounge was one of our favorites as the staff was welcoming and relaxed. The breakfast in the restaurant was also lovely. Had I known there was a Michelin restaurant earlier, we would have made plans to try the intimate experience. While the hotel is not in the Gothic district, it is near the ocean and has a large mall with everything you could need across the street (similar to Target to IMAX). We only stayed one night but looking back I wish we would have stayed here longer as we ended up taking a taxi everywhere upon moving to the Gothic district anyway. We also stayed upon arrival from the US west coast...and fortunately they had a room available for us early so we could catch a nap and shower before anything else. although we just missed the pool due to cold weather, it would be great to enjoy at a warmer time.We highly recommend this hotel!",5,2022,12,06
36,Very Happy! Friendly team and great facilities,"Great experience! 
From the moment we arrived the team was outstanding & very friendly. Big thank you to night team Praxedes Castilla and his colleague Benjamin for being so welcoming & so helpful. 
Also, thank you to Daniela in the restaurant & the rest of the team.
I will certainly recommend it & stay again soon.
Thank you for looking after us",5,2022,11,28
36,Nice time to stay here,Very nice place and fantastic view. Jeffry is very nice person and big smile. Next time i will be here again. All services are the best. The breakfast are delicious and many menu. The room are clean and beautiful view. Fitness and swimming fool are the big,5,2022,11,20
36,Nice Hotel in the center of everything,"Welcoming staff ( Monica) was great, very accommodating and helpful. Restaurant and bar and outdoor patio in the hotel was nice. Hotel rooms need a bit updating. Carpets could have been cleaner. Sheets were clean and crisp. Busy hotel, many employees from the airlines were constantly coming and going. Easy to get to the bus and very easy to get a cab at this hotel. Executive lounge was very nice and comfortable.",4,2022,11,15
36,Great stay at pristine hotel,"We recently stayed at the hotel. The staff was most helpful, the hotel spotless, and location great. We are Diamond members and especially loved the private lounge. 

The concierge and front desk staff were excellent.",5,2022,11,11
36,Very good!,"I had really grateful our weekend. Very nice and friendly staff, amazing and clean rooms and view as like always beautiful. Theirs hotels locations always very convenient and comfortable. Tasty food and healthy.",5,2022,11,04
36,Family break,"Picking a hotel in Barcelona can be overwhelming.  Opted for the Hilton , due to stopping previously in this area. 
Hilton was great from start to finish. Room was spacious and clean , kids had a connecting room which was equally as good. 
Great facilities, great bar and breakfast was amazing.
Great location, metro/tram was less than 5 minute walk. Shopping centre opposite was great.  Beach 5 minute walk away. Great hotel for visting Barcelona.
Staff were fantastic. Thank you Hilton for a great break.",5,2022,11,02
36,Poor quality,"At first day we received a room which was occupied by another guest.
At second day the room was not cleaned 
The quality of room service was suboptimal 
The quality of lounge was very poor 
No support from reception for sending a postcard",2,2022,10,25
36,Fantastic Hotel and Exemplary Staff,"We had the good fortune to land at this hotel after an American Airlines flight was returned to Barcelona midair. We were shuttled to different places in the airport and waited almost 7 hours for information from AA. We were then given no paper voucher but sent to this hotel and told to give our names. This was an exercise in trust and we had no idea how it would turn out when we arrived at the hotel. Hotel staff were amazing, and helped us every step of the way. Apparently American Airlines was communicating in some fashion with the hotel even though the airlines was not communicating with us. There was a plane load of people at the hotel and the hotel staff handled this unexpected bevy of people with professionalism and good humor. The property itself was fantastic, three restaurants, rooftop pool and bar and fantastic food. We were so grateful to have landed at this hotel in what was otherwise very stressful situation. If you are looking for a hotel with exemplary staff close to the beach, with fantastic amenities, this is the hotel for you",5,2022,09,21
36,Beautiful Hotel,"Excellent place to stay for precruise vacation.  The staff was helpful and courteous.  They made us feel important, made excellent dinner recommendations. The breakfast was amazing with an added perk of using the executive lounge our stay was perfect. ",5,2022,09,12
36,Disappointing service and disheveled atmosphere,"Maybe we just stayed at the wrong time of year, but it seemed like the whole hotel was in disarray. We had to wait until 7pm to finally get into our room after a long day as it was not ready when we arrived. We had been waiting since 3:30pm.

Pros:
-Next to an upscale mall
-Near to the beach and public transportation
-Nice executive lounge
-Great view from the high floor rooms
-Standard Hilton rooms were clean and stylish
-Decent breakfast buffet
-The executive lounge staff were very nice and cheerful

Cons:
-Room was not ready on time
-Overcrowded hotel was very noise
-Elevators have poor circulation and were very stuffy
-Only one of the four front reception personnel was friendly and helpful, making check in/out a pain
-Room safe was broken and could not be reset by staff
-Pool ran out of towels...
-Someone with a dog stayed in the next room and it barked half of the night

Overall I would choose a different hotel next time considering that there are plenty in the area for a lower price.  

Being a Hilton diamond member, I was hoping for a much better experience.",2,2022,09,05
36,A great place to stay if you’re visiting Barcelona,"We recently stayed at this hotel as I was attending a conference in Barcelona. However I decided to bring my family and combine it with a city brea/holiday. Overall it was a comfortable stay and we would stay here again. The hotel is just on the outskirts of the city centre but everything is easily accessible by taxi or metro. It’s directly opposite the Diagonal Mar shopping mall which has a great food court which we made good use of. The room we booked was an executive room with access to the executive lounge. The sitting area in the room has a sofa bed which we used for my two older children (they provided a cot for my daughter). The room was spacious and clean with a decent sized bathroom. We had breakfast included and the breakfast area was a little busy but plenty of seating. The beach is just 10 minutes away. 
Pros: good location, comfortable and good sized rooms, helpful and friendly staff and decent facilities.
Cons: slow lifts, the service at check in took a while which did delay us a little but they also had conference delegates to deal with. The breakfast was a bit limited if you’re vegetarian- lots of meat but no vegetarian sausages or meat equivalent food. The pool was a little dirty so after using it once we didn’t try again.",4,2022,09,01
36,Great hotel!,"We were lucky enough to spend 4 night/5days at this hotel. The staff behind front desk (especially Omar!) concierge and in the baggage store were amazing and so helpful- I can’t express how much their attitudes and manners made all the difference to our stay. Our room was beautiful and were kept spotless. The Executive lounge had great choice for breakfast and free drinks between 5-7. Staff here were always friendly and polite too. The only thing that let it down the entire stay were the bar staff in the pool outside. They are not in keeping with the high quality of staff within the hotel (this is not including the staff who greet you and allocate your sun beds they were always wonderful). I ordered a glass of drink and the waiter said no problem however they didn’t serve by the glass so swapped it for a drink I didn’t like. When I queried this the bar staff mumbled between themselves gave me some questionable looks and made me a very watery pina colada with questionable lack of alcohol and when we then went on to order more they mumbled between themselves, continued to provide poor quality drinks (compared to what we had previously at €15 euros a cocktail!) But this did not over shadow the stay, I cannot recommend this hotel enough. ",5,2022,08,30
36,Rude employees and awful service. ,"As I arrived I tried to add my loyalty number - Hilton Honors and It was not computed. At breakfast I asked for salt and 3 rude employees wouldn't give it to me. And finally the housekeeping lost my flight pillow. Despite of my complaining not a single 'Sorry'.
Really not a good experience.",2,2022,08,29
36,Very family friendly!,"My family and I stayed here in July.  We found the room to be very spacious and clean, and accommodated our family of 5 nicely.  Tomas at check-in was outstanding, he provided the kids will lots of fun activities and toys, including a beach ball. The pool was fun, great atmosphere and delicious food/drinks. We love the city of Barcelona and hope to be back. Would stay here again and again!",5,2022,08,28
36,Perfect stay in a beautiful,"Excellent service, high standards throughout and a fantastic view of the city from the room. The pool area was lovely. We had a surprise upgrade as guest of the day as well. All in all a safe comfortable and ideal location to base our time in Barcelona. The nearest metro is near so easy to get to the sites and taxi rank outside is cheap for further excursions. The staff were friendly and the food was good. I would expect high standards at the Hilton but this was right up there as one of the very best I had stayed in.",5,2022,08,26
36,Excellent Beaches and location Crystal clear water and blue ocean,We had the best experience with most friendly knowledgeable staff. Only 2 blocks to the beach. Across the street was a hidden gem of a large shopping center awesome restaurants and even a huge and I mean huge superstore target like. Everything you could think of from grocerys to clothes.  ,5,2022,08,25
36,Nice hotel and location but a real shame about the system they have for the pool,"We just spent 4 nights here with my family and it is a nice hotel. Rooms a lovely and the staff are great on the hole. 

We were a group of 6. 3 adult and 3 kids.

Most of the time we were out but at times in the day the kids wanted to use the pool. However this is easier said that done because you have to either go first thing in the morning and grab a space or pay to reserve a space (50% discount if you are guests at the hotel) but the fee for a 4 poster sun lounger was 250 euros for the day!

The pool area is popular especially at the weekend and we found it almost impossible to get space by the pool.

Now, if this is the policy then that is fine but you don't find out until you get there. We were sent an email to say how much they were looking forward to seeing us, which was really nice but what would have made it even better was if they had actually warned us about the booking system around the pool. Or better still as they would have known we had 3 kids, perhaps even offer to reserve a space for us. 

The  most annoying thing was they while these space were apparently ""booked"" many were unoccupied. 

We did make it down to the beach for a bit, which is just a short walk away. It's lovely but was on a very hot day and not much shade. Locals had bought their parasols but there wasn't anywhere we could see to hire one. 

Location as I said was could - about 18euros to the port area. Lots of taxis about and massive shopping centre next to the hotel and a Westfield near by too, 

We had exec rooms so had access to the lounge for breakfast and happy hour which was a nice bonus. 

Overall 7/10",3,2022,08,18
36,Great hotel and in fantastic location,"Excellent hotel and the location was fantastic for the beautiful Clean beach 
Shopping centre is directly across from the hotel and some fantastic restaurants too
The staff were super friendly and helpful and would recommend this hotel ",5,2022,08,18
36,It was ok but expectations are much higher from Hilton,"There are a lot of hotels in Barcelona but we decided to go for the Hilton to be sure we get a Hilton quality. 
This was not really a case. We could hardly find any food at executive lounge for breakfast,it was dirty there and tables not cleared.
Public areas and lifts were not clean enough. The staff needs also more training in hospitality and customer service. 
We are not coming back there.",3,2022,08,12
36,Amazing hotel,"Our room was amazing regarding clean and view . Staff hotel are very welcoming and very helpful . Breakfast quality very high standard . The hotel close to everything and easy to get any taxi or public transportation 
The hotel area is very staff during the day and night ",5,2022,08,06
36,Offer fun pool vibe experience plus Executive Lounge,"Overall great stay, clean and comfortable rooms and great service with helpful friendly staff.  As with Hilton’s in Europe they don’t place a high value on your status. Location is about 20 min to central Barcelona.",5,2022,08,03
36,Worst Hilton ever,"This was the worst experience I’ve had at a Hilton. I am a Hilton Honours (gold) member, and I have never received such poor service alongside been treated with such disrespect. I checked into the hotel, and the website through the app and online was down while I was trying to book and had to use a third party service to book. I explained this situation not once, not twice, but three times to the front desk as I wanted to use my Hilton gold member benefits. Twice I was told “they would get back to me and phone my room” and no answer. Absolutely disrespectful behaviour from a top hotel. I asked to speak to the manager and he/she would not come out to speak to me and allow me to explain the situation. Is this how you treat all your honours members? Absolutely pathetic service and would not recommend this hotel to anyone. If I could leave 0 stars I would.",1,2022,08,02
36,Great apart from the restricted pool access,"This hotel was overall great spot for our honeymoon trip to Barcelona! Wish we could give it 5 stars but they advertise a lovely pool deck that actually had limited access for hotel guests.

On one of our days the entire deck was closed from 2pm for a private event so no hotel guests could even enjoy it in the afternoon. The next day was even worse!

A large portion of the pool deck was closed for a business conference one of the days we stayed there, leaving limited sunbeds available. Turns out the pool also takes public reservations for the loungers and cabanas with no priority for hotel guests. We weren’t even alerted to this by the hotel so we could’ve paid to reserve a spot ahead of time if we wanted to. We tried to go to the pool only to be told all beds were taken and we could be on a waitlist (which we were on from about 11am to 3pm with no movement). We asked about booking a lounger for the next day so it didn’t happen again only to be told they were already sold out. It’s was a big let down as the pool deck was a big reason we booked this hotel. A manager we spoke to said he would work on this for guest experience so we hope it improves.

The breakfast buffet was included in our stay and it had a wide variety of options with some new choices each day, keeping it fresh and interesting.

We had a fabulous room service meal one night! We recommend the steak— it was cooked perfectly, seasoned well, and delicious! We were able to order on a mobile link with no trouble.

The hotel is well located. The beach board walk was near by and we walked down the diagonal into the center of the city easily!

We had a corner room on the 14th floor which lined up perfectly to a gap in a neighboring building allowing for a full view of both the city and the water! Highly recommend!

Overall, if they could make sure hotel guests can enjoy the pool deck, this could be a 5 star hotel experience.",4,2022,07,29
36,Stay made unpleasant by unprofessional attitude of front desk staff,"Reception staff was very unprofessional. We reached hotel at 2:30 PM and were told by the lady at reception desk that our room will be ready in one hour. On checking back at 3:45 PM (after 1 hour 15 min), same lady expressed disapproval that we were checking back & said the room will take another hour. We had taken an 8 hour flight from Dubai & had a 2.5 year old toddler. She was absolutely unapologetic about the delay & in fact behaved as if it was our fault that we were checking back after an hour. 

Again during checking out, same lady was at reception. The hotel's billing system was not working & she couldn't give me any invoice & confirm release of excess amount blocked at check-in. Unfortunately, once again, she was completely unapologetic & behaved as if it was my mistake to expect an invoice during check out. 

As somebody who travels for business every month, & frequently for leisure, over the last 10 years, this was probably my worst experience with front desk staff at any of the major chain hotels.",2,2022,07,26
36,Disappointed,"Very disappointed with pool area and amount of people at hotel . When arriving at pool they give towels out and take you to your bed , beds are cramped together  music is SO LOUD you can’t even read your book . Not relaxing at all … we had to go to beach … they tried to charge us for 2 days breakfast we didn’t get . We also got a jug of sangria at the pool it was €72 … pool was closed all day one of the days for a business meeting … next day we couldn’t even get a bed at the pool so disappointing  … would not go back to this hotel",2,2022,07,18
36,Issues at the pool.,"Hotel is very good. Stayed with our 2 children. We chose this hotel because of the pool. HOWEVER on Saturday we had to pay 90 euros to use the pool because there are only so many beds for hotel guests and the rest are for paying customers. We got there at 10:30 and 90% of the beds were empty but apparently other guests are able to reserve the beds. So they have sat there all morning empty incase those who reserved them turn up. We were not told we can reserve them otherwise we would have done so for the week. 
Look at the photos attached, apparently this is fully booked. 

Apart from that it has been excellent.",3,2022,07,16
36,Not exactly a diamond experience,"I only booked this hotel because of it's amex platinum deal and as a hilton diamond member so this review is as much about that as the hotel itself.

Location is quiet but only 10-15 minutes away from central locations, right beside a modern mall and only a short distance inland from the beach.

The building is about 20 years old and that's kinda reflected in the bathrooms and room furniture which was a bit tired.  But I had a big screen, good air con and comfortable bed in my exec floor room.

The pool area was good with comfortable beds - you had to check in and be designated where you sat (which was unpleasantly officious on one occasion).  Pool small and crowded with kids so don't expect to do swim any lengths.
 
Breakfast was the usual buffet offering of a hotel of this caliber.  Nothing remarkable either way.

The exec lounge with complimentary evening snacks/wine was nice.

Gym was very small with very limited resistance/weights options.

The let down was the diamond service or lack of it.  I paid for 2 nights through amex platinum as that qualified for a $100 resort credit.  I paid for a 3rd night direct on hilton app.  The app was cheaper (but no freebie).  I qualified for free breakfast and an upgrade to the best room available at check in either way.

I was upgraded to a sea view room.  I nudged for a suite but got a polite no.  I checked what was available myself - a super fancy suite (well i didn't expect to be offered that, but they also have good availability for 1 bedroom suites for the duration of my stay).  Not to worry, i was on my own but it was good to learn that these upgrades weren't really forthcoming as promised.

The $100 could only be used for breakfast or in one deserted restaurant off the lobby.  My breakfast was already included so not much of an option.  However, on asking i was told they'd let me use it at the pool as an exception.  Lucky me.  

At checkout they argued about how i shouldn't have been allowed to use this credit at the pool restaurant.  Sigh.  They begrudgingly agreed to wave the charges.  It was an unpleasant experience with attitude. However, one charge they insisted was used on the wrong day.  I lost the will to argue over $25.  

So in summary paying extra to get more through amex was a mistake, the diamond suite upgrade although available wasn't given and they chiselled me $25 and left a nasty taste in my mouth.  I wouldn't return.",3,2022,07,15
36,Stuck in Barcelona,"Our AA flight from Barcelona to Philadelphia was canceled and AA got us all to stay overnight at this hotel.
What a nice gesture and place to stay while waiting on the next plane to arrive.
Nice, clean, all kinds of things to do and excellent service and desk personnel. There was good choice of food offered at the hotel too.",5,2022,07,12
36,Ok for business,"This was a comfortable business hotel. No character but has everything you need. I wouldn’t pay to stay here on a private vacation as there is a huge conference hall so you risk the hotel being swarmed by conference delegates and the pool area cordoned off for a private event. 

Food was so so, poor vegetarian options. Location was ok, not close to the main sites but there was a busy taxi rank outside plus a huge shopping mall across the street",4,2022,07,06
36,Paradise for Diamond Members!,"There is a moment in an old NFL Films video where Bill Parcells, trying to get the most out of his defense in a big game, tells his players ""this is why you lift all them weights!""  I thought of that during my three night stay here-- this is why you go to those meetings out-of-town, this is why you stay at all those Hampton Inns, this is why you get the Hilton card -- to end up with enough points to stay at a place like this and truly enjoy Barcelona!

The pictures looked great online, but it doesn't truly capture the experience: the treatment for diamond members is amazing.  

We were moved from a standard room to a top floor ocean view when we asked for an upgrade and the person making the upgrade seemed genuinely happy to do it!

When we went to the pool (which is world class) on a busy day, we got seated in one area, but were moved to a better, luxurious area when seating became available there, not because we asked but because someone asked us if we would like to move when possible.

The location is unbelievably good.  The (absolutely beautiful) beach is just outside the hotel and a short walk away.  Spain's largest mall is across the street and you never have to wait for a cab to go anywhere. 

And then there are the extras...

... Breakfast is phenomenal: all kinds of hot foods, all kinds of cheese, all kinds of breads including a cake of the day, flan for dessert (on some days, I think), three kinds of fresh juices, waitress service and a large area to enjoy it.

... The lounge on the 15th floor has a great daily happy hour and outdoor seating to take in a full view of the city (see photo).

... Big fluffy towers and nightly chocolates from house-keeping.

Highly, highly recommended!",5,2022,06,26
36,"Newly renovated, love the location, the lounge and the team","Back at my favorite hotel in Barcelona, the lounge is back open and its amazing to enjoy the evening with view on the ocean while drinking some wine and feeling the sea breeze. Bummers are the new limited times even for Softdrinks only from 5-7pm and the general closing time of already 8pm, so u cant watch the sunset from there. Got a nice suite facing purobeach and after the rooms were already renovated last year, this year the breakfast restaurant is already finish and the lounge terrace will be so as well soon.",5,2022,06,24
36,A good business option near the convention center.,"This branch keeps the Hilton's business standards. It is far from the city center, but a good option if you are there for a meeting in the nearby convention center. Room was small but well appointed. Staff was helpful. Breafast was good.",4,2022,06,19
36,Great during Primavera Sound,"We stayed here during the second weekend of Primavera Sound, and it was an ideal location for that experience. Despite my Diamond status, I was not able to get an upgrade, nor was I really offered an improved room, but the room was spacious and served us well over our four nights. The Executive Lounge may be one of the best I've experienced with sweeping views of the city and the ocean on the patio. The breakfast was fine, but the happy hour was a lot of fun with other guests and drinks freely flowing. The concierge Franky helped us find COVID tests in the city before our flight, and checked back in to make sure everything was taken care of. It was overall a very nice stay and an ideal location for our visit.",5,2022,06,17
36,Barcelona Hilton,Very nice Hotel. Very nice rooms! Only stayed there one night before our cruise but it was a lovely comfortable stay. Friendly staff are very helpful. If from the U.S. you will need to bring an outlet converter.,5,2022,06,16
36,Relaxed choice near the beach.,"Good location, in a dynamic beach area (Short walk from hotel), marina, just slightly further but walkable.
Hotel, is modern, clean and has a very relaxed fee, with no detriment the excellent service.  Michelin starred restaurant, but check as not open every day, Pool is set in a beach club environment.
Opposite a large shopping centre, taxi rank directly outside the hotel.
Great hotel choice in Barcelona.",5,2022,06,12
36,Lovely Modern Hotel,"This Hotel is modern and very clean.
It has a large amount rooms and does a good breakfast. The Pool is a place to be seen.... I would say it is not for everyone. We did have to call a doctor which the team at the front desk assisted us with.  Our room was on the 18th floor overlooking the sea. The location of the Hotel is perfect with shops, the beach and play areas for kids all just be side the Hotel. With this all in mind the Hotel can charge accordingly.  I would like to stay in this Hotel again in the future.

36,Take photo of charges to room,"I have spent hours trying to reconcile an error on my folio.
I suggest taking a photo of any signed billing to your room.
I have been on phone with Hilton guest.correspondence@hilton.com and 
some representatives understand problem but can't fix it.
On phone with Hilton Diagonal and representative asked if I wanted to speak
with manager after I balked on the overcharge and waited for no one to appear.
This was while  guest.correspondence was on phone with me.
I have disputed the charge with my Bank.",2,2022,06,09
36,Five day trip review,"Pros: 
-Rooms are clean and a great size 
-Breakfast variety was good, lots on offer 
-Pool was a good size in comparison to other Barcelona hotels
-Food and cocktails at PueroBeach was great 
-Taxis on standby outside the hotel 

Cons: 
-Location, it is very far out and about an hour and half walk to Las Ramblas. We did opt for walking a couple of days, and it was nice to explore but taxis may be your preferred option if you want to get to places quicker than this. 
-Sunbed/Loungers at PueroBeach was a nightmare to get. Despite the fact, we was hotel guests and told that there was no requirement to reserve (first come basis), this was not the case at all!! The hotel on the weekend booked out all the beds/sunloungers to either hotel guests who paid or to external guests (this is not specified anywhere on the website) because of this hotel guests who had not booked were put under a section with shutters, which had limited sun! But worse of all, it felt separated away from the main pool section, which as a guest I have to say is very disappointing (we wasn’t the only ones who felt this way)",3,2022,05,31
36,"Stay May 19-22, 2022","My wife and I enjoyed our stay at the hotel. We were upgraded to panoramic suite for our Diamond status. This hotel takes the Diamond status very seriously. The breakfast buffet is still excellent compared to before the pandemic. Thanks to everyone at the hotel for being very nice, pleasant and helpful. Good management and 100% Plus health and safety with wipes in the lobby and surroundings. We felt very safe. Location near metro and buses. Taxi also on stand-by. Excellent location to stay.

36,酒店银行卡被盗刷 credit card is stolen,"The cleaner entered our room and copied our information of credit card. Also want to make a payment. But the reception manager wants to cover these things. Actually, high price, the worst quality and the worst manager.

36,Lovely,"Lovely hotel and lovely pool!  However, the male staff member at reception with short black hair was rather rude!

The hotel itself is lovely, as is the pool. The gym is great and it is a clean hotel. It’s not right in the centre, however, we just hopped on metros and it was completely fine! You need to travel a lot anyway in Barcelona.

A bit ridiculous charging €8 for a bag of crisps and €5 for a can of coke in reception, so I didn’t buy any of that! 

Would return!",4,2022,05,20
36,Wonderful hotel & service,The service was incredible here.  From Rebecca at the front desk checking us in to Omar and Diago helping is find where to go for a Covid test.  Natalia and our bell hop were also wonderful.  Highly recommend the Hilton.  For Hilton Honors the executive lounge is great for evening cocktail hour and breakfast in the morning.,5,2022,05,19
36,Pretty good,"It was a fairly good experience. We had executive lounge access, which was nice and had good views of the city. When the luggage person was showing us around the room, the shelf in the closet fell on my Mom's foot and the guy just put it back up instead of addressing whatever the underlying issue was. The location was good across from the mall. Check in was easy enough. All and all, it was a nice place to stay for one night before our cruise. ",4,2022,05,13
36,Really enjoyed our stay,"The lobby staff were amazing, helping us with our late check in needs after traveling all day/night, to getting anything else we needed, to recommending local places to eat.  Nice comfortable bedding (LOVED the California King!) and quiet hotel rooms.   Would stay again!",5,2022,05,05
36,Strange Business lounge service,"Spent a week with my wife in this hotel near beach. Hotel is located in kind of business hotel area but cross the street mall with services and restaurants is very convenient.

Hotel staff was great and friendly but unfortunately like many times before in all hotel chains little bit disappointing. I requested foam pillows and bedding because if my severe feather allergy but unfortunately they were not there when we arrived to hotel. I had to go to reception three times when this miracle happened. Why it is so difficult where ever I go globally?

Room was nice and clean. Nothing to complain about it but nothing special either. Reliable Hilton service I think. Room was very much similar than in DoubleTree Hilton hotels rooms are.

But why this hotel tries to hide it´s location? No lights at the front door at all. Also cleaning outside was missing nearly whole week. Somedays it looked like 1 star hotel front with all that garbage and not cleaned cigarette poles. I have used to see Hilton front door clean, lighted and welcoming. This was not.

And what in the world was deposit when signing in? Never had to do it anywhere in Hilton hotels and it also was not mentioned when I booked a room via Hilton apps. There was nothing in the fridge to cover with deposit. Cant understand don´t they trust on Gold members?

As a Gold member we had lovely breakfast at terrace nearly every morning. Breakfast was good and selection was wide. During two days I worked remotely from Executive Lounge which is nearly empty and peaceful during the day. WiFi worked perfectly all the time in the Lounge and our room.

But Executive Lounge Happy hour was strange. Only two hours per day with extremely limited amount of snacks, drinks and food. Lounge was full of Gold, Platinum etc. members and we all together had same thoughts; poorest Happy Hour lounge ever in Hilton hotels. Big disappointment for everyone.

We didn't use pool area but went to check it and it looks really nice.

So, very conflicting opinion about this hotel. I will go there again for business but not for holidays. It was kind of OK Hilton. Nothing else. I cannot recommend the hotel without a doubt.",4,2022,05,05
36,My Stay,"The people are very nice and very courteous.  The rooms are large with good furniture.  The location is over 30 minute walk from downtown and all of the attractions, so not ideal. The elevators are awfully noisy so make sure your room is far from the elevators. The gym was very good for a hotel gym.",5,2022,05,03
36,The worst and unprofessional wedding experience,"I done my engagement celebration with Hilton diagonal mar in Barcelona.
I would like to say that it was the worse experience for me. 
All things were stressful with them. I chosen the hotel because it’s The Brand hotel and trustable one! But some of them doesn’t do their job in the right way!
firstly, after many email and talking directly, they said it’s not possible to celebrate at the day that we confirmed with ms Alina . She is so unprofessional person in her job, I guess manager change with a more professional person! So after lot of stress and calling to hotel . other person confirm me to celebrate in the same week but with different price !!!!
That person gives me different prices for first and second reservations that was in the same week (250€ more), honestly I don’t understand that!!!!!! I complained about that so they changed it for pervious price (unprofessional surprise).
But The important point is that in the day (reservation was from 12-16h) because of paperwork’s in the NOTARIA we were at 13:30 , so we leave at4:15pm. So in my opinion it’s normal to stay a little bite more! But ms Bianca wanted charge me 107€ more!!!!!!!!!!! 
Ms Bianca write me to pay all the times and destroy my honeymoon and gives me stress at the time, consider to my heart problems it’s not fine for my health.
I was thinking to my wedding celebration with 200 people with them, but obviously I changed my mind. If they can’t manage the small group how is possible with more and bigger group!!!!! recommendation is don’t do with Hilton (the worse experience ever). I want to have an explanation and response from general manager.",1,2022,05,03
36,loved it,"great big hotel. room comfortable and clean. Great selection of food for breakfast. Staff is really trying hard to please all the guests, they are professional and polite. Great stay and we will definetly be back",5,2022,04,29
36,Even 1 star is away too much. Filthy place,"Dear future guests, please avoid this place as I stayed in the second highest class room in the hotel just after the presidential suit and let me tell you it was the dirtiest hotel Room ever visited and that’s include one star hostel again in Barcelona around 10 years ago.  We Booked this room because of the views but when wen we opened the door those views were almost not possible to see as they were not clean probably for years, the room itself is extremely outdated with damaged furniture everywhere, and most importantly filthy and we ask the duty manager Anna Dimenez if I am not wrong about her name,  to send someone to clean the room which they supposedly did but when I come back to the room the human hair and some crumble’s was still everywhere at the floor. Furthermore, the usb charging points are working only at one of the desks others are just for decorations   Last but not least, the so called executive lounge is no different as only good thing is the view but please be carful as there are live electric cable hanging out from switches. Also visiting swimming pool will cost you 50€ P.p.  

Floors at the Panoramic Suite - filthy 
Windows - so filthy that this dirt is abstracting your view
Bedding and towels-  only think that was clean 
Suit furniture outdated and damaged
Shower room door is not closing properly and also some of the sealing is missing so floor is constantly getting flooded. 
When manager promises something don’t believe them. 
Anyway partial refund was made as compensation but this can not excuse the hotel management for this dirt and disappointments.
Executive longe is open full day but serves alcoholic drinks and some small choices of food only for two hours a day, time they call a happy hour. 
Just don’t",1,2022,04,28

36,Solid Hilton in Great Location,"Super-solid Hilton hotel in a prime beach location in Barcelona.  Staff were super-helpful, very welcoming and the breakfast was as great as ever.

36,Barcelona with the family,"I really loved the location of this hotel. A short walk from the beach and right across the road from the Diagonal Mar shopping centre, which has a huge range of places to eat and all the usual familiar shops, and some unfamiliar",4,2022,04,18
36,Great rooftop pool and staff are great here.,"We stayed here for 4 nights as a family in a suite.  The sofa bed was too small for our kids but the hotel got us an extra bed which worked really well. 
The views are good but the windows are VERY dirty and need a good clean! 
The room is good but a little dated and the shower is just an attachment in a bath. The carpets need to be replaced soon too. We noticed that someone had left litter In The hallway and it wasn’t removed for 2 days. 
Breakfast is quite chaotic so you have a time it well. It would be nice to see more healthy options and dairy free options.
The Rooftop pool was great.  We had a amazing weather and the staff were really good.  You may have to wait for a sun bed but there is another area where you can wait and chill out.
The location is good as it’s close to the beach and the shopping centre which has lots of restaurants.  However it’s further than walking distance from all the main sights.  A taxi to sagrada is 11-15 euros.
We had use of the executive lounge and enjoyed the cava, wine and nibbles everyday.  It was well worth it and the kids enjoyed it too.

We would recommend the hotel as the staff are really helpful/ knowledgeable and friendly and for us the use of the pool on a hot day was just perfect whilst enjoying a cocktail.",4,2022,04,17
36,"Great location, welcoming staff.","We had a great stay at the hotel, the anything they were very responsive. The executive lounge had a good selection of drinks and snacks.

36,Poor location,"The hotel is very clean and nice, but bad location for tourists looking to see the city.  Lots of taxi fares to sites.

Do NOT waste your money for the ""sea view"".   You overlook an industrial area between the hotel and the sea.  Better off with the city view.

36,Good location in Barcelona,"Stayed for two nights. We enjoyed out stay at Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona. The room was nicely appointed and the sea view was pleasant. All the staff we interacted with were great. The location of the hotel is really ideal. Its a short walk to the beach and there is a shopping mall right across from the hotel with tons of shops and dinning options. Unfortunately the hotel pool was closed for the season during our stay. The hotels dining options were less than ideal. We ate at Ma'i the first evening and ate outside the hotel afterwards. We ordered burgers at €25 each and they were disgusting. The overall food menu wasn't anything I really wanted to try either. Even the food menu at Aürt didn't look appealing. The bar tender didn't seem familiar with how to make cocktails either. We ate breakfast in the lounge which wasn't very good. Each morning the scrambled eggs were cold and I didn't feel comfortable eating them if they haven't been kept at a proper temperature. I recommend staying at the Hilton for the location due to the proximity of the beach, shopping, and dinning. However, just go across the street for delicious food options.",4,2022,03,31
36,Cold showers and Circus in the executive lounge this time. Not positive,"A few ssues we have not seen before at this hotel. The room lacked hot water the first 24 hours, this was a problem for several rooms.
The issue was resolved on the second afternoon, but we had a few cold showers.

The executive lounge was a big let down. It was supposed to open for «happy hour» at 5 pm. No staff appeared untill 5:25. the staff was then gone again, not clearing tabels and such. The next evening the lounge opened on time, but the staff again left. So soon it was «chaos», out of wine, glasses ice etc, and people roaming all over to search for something. So after 45 min I went down to the reception to inform about the state ofthe lounge.  This is far away from my past, good, experiences I have had in this lounge.",2,2022,03,28
36,Just OK 👍,The hotel is not bad by any means but it’s not up to par with other Hilton hotels I’ve stayed in. The employees were very nice. Our room smelled really bad our entire stay and there was a small amount of mold/mildew in the bathtub/shower combo. I liked having access to the diamond lounge. The pool did not have any water in it which is understandable but there was lots of trash and cigarette butts in it. The patio was not set up to enjoy for the warmer sunny days in March and April. Keep in mind this is a VERY busy hotel for business groups. We felt like we were ignored and less catered to being only 2 people traveling leisurely. The big groups walk into the snack bar or breakfast and then you have to wait a long time. It’s a long walk to the beach. ,3,2022,03,25
36,So much wrong with this place,"So much for getting any rest at this place. Between them cutting the power off at 12:30 midnight so I couldn't charge my phone or do anything. Housekeeping slammes every single door, you jump from the bed! Also they have a motion sensor, so your heating or AC cuts off in the middle of your sleep and you wake up in a pool of sweat or shivering cold. Not to mention they have a drill so loudly go off in your room that is meant for only the staff to evacuate! Yes, an alarm to wake you up, but the alarm says for only the staff to evacuate!!!! I made a recording but unfortunately this website only will allow to upload pictures, not videos. The power is cut off so I have to shower in the dark! What kind of place is this??? My advice to you, is to stay somewhere else. Dont bring your money to this horrible hotel.",1,2022,03,25
36,Very supportive hotel team,"Very kind, supportive hotel personnel,  they helped to arrange a quick PCR test in the hotel, after failures on the internet. During business trips, with time constrains this is greatly appreciated !! Thanks",5,2022,03,20
36,Absolutely amazing hotel!,"I went during off season to stay a few days. It was my first time in Barcelona. I was upgraded to an executive room on the top floor with a seaside view. The view was breathtaking.

After long, exhausting days and while still recovering from jetlag, the bed in my room was like a cloud and so comfortable to sleep on.

Unfortunately the executive lounge is closed. Instead, they have converted the executive lounge into the breakfast area. Those who are eligible to visit the executive lounge can use the lobby bar instead as an executive lounge. You receive unlimited non-alcoholic drinks throughout the day, as well as an assortment of hors d'oeurves (they call it snacks, but they are being too modest) and two alcoholic drinks during happy hour from 17:00-19:00 daily. The breakfast was great and I enjoyed having omelettes, Iberian ham, French pastries, as well as classic American options.

To stay compliant with COVID regulations, they place a sticker on your room key holder if you are vaccinated. This lets you access the bar without bringing your vaccine pass. The holder also has a convenient map of Barcelona and the best locations to visit. It made choosing places to go extremely easy!

Unlike any other hotel in the world right now, they actually still offer proactive housekeeping daily (I assume this is only if you are vaccinated). This was a pleasant surprise and very much appreciated. I didn't even have to ask them to do this; they do it just like things were before the pandemic.

Omar at the front desk was particularly helpful and went above and beyond to make sure my stay was enjoyable. I really appreciate his hospitality and he really made the stay amazing!

The only problem I had in the hotel was the internet was slow and unreliable in my room. It was difficult to have Zoom calls on it because it would lag up. It was less of a problem in the lobby bar. I hope they can look into this; it might just be my room which was 2312. But this was truly the only problem I had -- everything else was amazing, so I will still give a 5 star rating.

I would love to stay here next time I visit Barcelona!",5,2022,02,13
36,Thank you for the good care,"A few years ago I asked to see the hotel. Someone of the front desk made some time to show it to me. I found it, at first a bit far away from the city center. 
Of course with COv one looks differently at a Hotel  to stay.
So for this trip we decided to book with this hotel.
The first thing is the parking, which is spacious and with security 24/7.
Check in, your QR is checked so the rest of the stay you are good.
All staff at this hotel seems relax and loving their jobs and therefore transmit tranquility.
It feels they all work very well together.  Only good vibes.
Our room was perfect, it was a corner room with view on the city and the sea. Very nice and the window opens with real fresh air. 
Breakfast for cov times is perfect.
If you want something special the staff will order it for you.
Enough space between families.
Food good.
In front of this hotel you have a big shopping mall with all the brands you could also get in the city + a big supermaket.
And the playa is really next door.
We loved to stay at this hotel, a bit of peace in the sparkling city. 
If you don’t have a car the bus is a good option H16 to city center
And Metro of course. 
Anyway we will be back 
Thank to all the staff for the good care.",5,2022,01,04
36,Great Hotel for families,"It was a great experience with a remarkable attention to my kids (8 and 5 years old). The location is great same than the views and the services around.
Genial atención a los grupos familiares, visitamos el hotel con niños de 5 y 8 anos. La ubicación del hotel es genial igual que las vistas y servicios disponibles alrededor.",4,2022,01,04
36,What a lovely hotel!,"Were supposed to go to South East Asia for Christmas and New Year but changed our plans last minute (Covid 19 and Omicron!) and opted for Barcelona, thanks to our flexible flight tickets and hotels.

What a great choice we made: Hilton Diagonal Mar is beautifully located between the beach and the newer part of Barcelona, quite a bit from central Barcelona though. For those who want to see ""traditional Barcelona"" with a wish to hang around the Rambla, this is not the place for sure. 

Having seen it all on our previous trips to Barcelona, we loved our long walks along the beach in surprisingly warm & sunny winter weather, explored the lovely cafes and restaurants frequented by locals along the alleys nearby, quiet enough to ensure a safe environment for everybody during these challenging times.

The staff at Hilton Diagonal Mar are absolutely lovely, accommodating and very flexible, always reflecting the ""Hilton Spirit"" at their best. This is a hotel for explorers who don't mind having longer walks to central Barcelona on foot, seeing it all what modern Barcelona has to offer between the Rambla and Diagonal Mar, and trying to find a balance  between the "" traditional & touristy"" Barcelona with modern Barcelona along the way to Diagonal Mar. 

Having seen it all on our previous visits to central Barcelona, Hilton Diagonal Mar has given us a great chance to explore Barcelona from a different perspective, away from noise and the crowds. To be honest, if you are not for longer walks nor want to stay away from the crowds and touristic activities in central Barcelona, you may not find Hilton Diagonal Mar as the best choice for a dream holiday. 

We loved it, really, and felt safe at all times despite the surging numbers of Covid-19 cases across Spain and the rest of Europe, moreover, felt the area was safer due to the fact tha people actually rescpeted the current Covid-19 rules imposed by the Hilton, and the local government. Felt this is the safest area to spend your holidays in Barcelona!

A special ""Muchas Gracias"" goes to the Hilton Diagonal Mar Staff for making our stay so memorable, pleasant and safe. Nothing seemed was too much trouble and we felt really welcome at all times.  Hope to be back to this wonderful hotel soon!",5,2021,12,31
36,HAPPY STAY,The hotel is in a good location. Just across the road is a shopping mall which made it easier to access other things. The rooms were nicely cleaned. The staff were amazing. From the first night we arrived they made our stay easy.,4,2021,12,21
36,Cruise Interval Stay,"Extra   2 days spent here in Spain prior to boarding for a South Atlantic cruise. The accommodations were perfect, everything was available and accessible from restaurants, shopping and transportation. Service was very good.",5,2021,11,21
36,Very nice,"We were there during the off-peak season so the street outside of the building was not noisy.  The pillows were flat and only a heavy comforter were on the beds so those could have been better.  It would have been nice if breakfast was included for the price per night, but it was not. We did not try the food at the on-site restaurant.  It’s across the street from a shopping mall. You can see the mall’s food court from the window near the hotel elevators. It took about an hour to get to the airport at 6:30a due to rush hour.  It took approx a hour to get to the hotel from the cruise port.  They hold marathons in the area and the routes are very close to this hotel so make sure to look into that because they will shut down the roads for several hours.  The hotel is approx 15-20 minutes from the main “la rambla” or street of Barcelona. A taxi to La Rambla costs about €15-18 each way.  It was easy to get a taxi just had to wave your arm.  They also hang out near the hotel.  ",4,2021,11,03
36,Another great stay and will be back soon,"Another great stay at my favorite Barcelona Hotel. Thanks to the hospitality of Paola at the Check-In and Jeffrey at the Lounge and PuroClub, my stay was fantastic again. The suite was newly renovated and had a fantastic view over the city. The breakfast in the Club Lounge with outdoor seating was more than relaxing while watching the sunrise.

Thanks to the team,
Axel",5,2021,10,18
36,Hilton Never Fails Me,"-Good location, close to metro and other transportation
-Across the street from a shopping center and restaurants 
-Excellent customer service 
-Multiple options for breakfast 
-Rooms clean and we’ll maintained
-Beds extremely comfortable ",5,2021,10,07
36,Awesome Executive Lounge and Staff,"Great location and very friendly and helpful staff. Especially Jeffery from Honduras in the Executive Lounge made a big difference, outstanding service and absolute pleasant experience. Thank you Jeffery! Keep it up!",5,2021,09,08
36,Amazing stay at Hilton Diagonal Mar!,"We had a fabulous time during our stay at Hilton Diagonal Mar. Staying near the beach and away from the noisy La Rambla was perfect. We spent the weekend by the poolside, Purobeach staff is friendly, great atmosphere with a live DJ - we really enjoyed it, even with a toddler. We loved being able to walk up to the beach and have a mall right opposite the hotel. This is a great way to experience a 'cleaner' side of Barcelona! The sea view rooms are excellent and you get a beautiful sunrise view in the morning. The staff is very helpful, welcoming and friendly. Thank you to Anna from Reservations, Victor at the front desk and Robinson at the Executive Lounge, each of you exceeded our expectations and made our vacation truly memorable. We look forward to visiting again!!",5,2021,08,30
36,Nice view but crowded pool,"Across hotel, there was a big mall. You can pick up some wine water in the super market, tons of shops but less characters. The pool on the weekend gets very very crowded, yes on top of each other, and if you want to give up the pool and go to the beach, please don’t bother because the beach would be packed too. They need to reserve some spots in the pool for the hotel guests. ",4,2021,08,28
36,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona,Excellent look forward in staying at the Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona sometime in the future again recommend anyone who travels to Barcelona for a short term or long term stay to go there business or leisure !!!,5,2021,08,27
36,"The hotel needs the very best in renovation The hotel needs renovation, rooms wasn’t clean as I used to be in Hilton","I don’t like the location it smells bad outside, at restaurant the prices are very high for drinks, it’s always crowd at reception area, need more workers,  overall it’s okay, but I would not stay for another time",2,2021,08,21
36,Ruido insufrible. Blasting noise,"80 decibelios de música ruidosa de dudoso gusto en el bar terraza al aire libre del hotel de viernes a domingo durante el verano. Imposible relajarse, trabajar o descansar cuando están abiertos.
The open-air terrace bar at the second floor of the hotel issues 80 decibels of amplified noisy music every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday during the season. Forget relaxing, working or resting during bar time.",1,2021,08,21
36,Not very pleased,The hotel/rooms were quite old. Its time to do a renovation. Also a lot of noise which made sleeping almost impossible. The swimmingpool staff of Purobeach is very unprofessional and slow. They said there was an event at the pool thats why we weren’t allowed to lay down the pool only somewhere under the shutters in the shadow but a lot of other people were allowed to lay next to the pool and there wasn’t even an event that day like they told us. We booked this hotel for the pool but after two nights we decided to cancel the remaining two nights and switch to another hotel. Very disappointing especially for the high price we paid.  ,1,2021,08,14
36,Fantastic Family Fun In The Sun,"Nine glorious nights at Hilton Diagonal Mar, Barcelona.  As a Hilton Diamond member, I was a little disappointed the exec. club, which is often a highlight of any HIlton stay, remained closed.  My concerns were allayed even before we arrived, an advance upgrade to connecting top floor rooms.
The welcome was warm and efficient, the Diamond benefits were explained to us.  A generous number of drink vouchers for the Urban Beach Club, PuroBeach.  The value of which more than made up for the lack of Exec. Club.  On the matter of PuroBeach, it is often frequented by the Instagram crew; self-obsessed, individuals who love to be seen.  It's a great atmosphere, friendly staff and a DJ at the weekend.
The room was spotlessly clean and spacious with uninterrupted views of the beach, high praise to the housekeeping department.  
About breakfast,  I must mention Thalita, the breakfast hostess with, not only a smile but an amazing ability to recall names, preferred seating and to spend a few moments shooting the breeze.  A Hilton star who well deserves recognition. All the staff at Breakfast were helpful, pleasantly firm with Covid rules.  The quality of the food was great, a wide range of local and the usual Hilton items.
Thank you to everyone at Hilton Diagonal Mar, you made our first post-covid vacation just brilliant.  This was my first visit but it certainly won't be my last visit, well done all round! ",5,2021,08,12
36,Average hotel and not like Hilton standard.,"The hotel is nice, but do not live up to Hilton standard: The room is old, that change sheets after 6 days, forget to empty the trashes, reception is not friendly and helpful and do not get back to you if you have a request, it’s hard to get a place at the pool and you need to book in advance and find a friendly person. ",3,2021,08,11
36,Good place to stay for a good price!,"Had a great few days the Hilton. The hotel is clean and the breakfasts are great with a good choice of food and plenty of tables and helpful staff. 

We occasionally had to queue for a while to speak to reception, perhaps they should have more staff there but this may be due to covid. 

There was no room service menus or qr codes anywhere obvious in the room and we couldnt find anything on their website or the tv, which was a little frustrating as we arrived late and wanted food. When we rang them they just told us two or three options…bit strange but not enough to spoil the stay.

The pool area is PuroBeach Barcelona which is great and has a nice vibe. However, on busy days hotel guests are only given the option of the beds under cover rather than in full sunshine. If you want to reserve a bed in the main area you will get a great discount compared with the website prices if you are a hotel guest. I’d make sure to reserve a few days in advance at the weekend if you wish to. 

We paid extra for a sea view but I’m not sure I’d bother as it’s not a particularly attractive coastline and there are a couple of big buildings in the way of the view.

There is a taxi rank nearby and the longest we ever had to wait for a taxi was 5 minutes.

For the price, I would definitely stay again as it was far cheaper than a lot of hotels in Barcelona, is clean and pleasant to look at and offered a good breakfast. The staff were also friendly and helpful.",4,2021,08,11
36,Nice hotel let down by pool,"It’s a nice hotel and it’s very clean.  Cecilia and Anna have been very helpful.  The reason for the 3 star rating is that the pool is managed by a third party.  This means the pool area is a cocktails/party area with very loud pumping music most of the time.  For me, it’s not great as I want a pool that feels like it is for residents and that you can’t actually relax around and have a swim in.  Here, their main objective is to hire poolside beds out to non-residents.  And I really struggled with the service.   I found it continually hard to get service as the waiters focus on those who have paid for their beds for the day.  You can’t order drinks at the bar which is really annoying, you have to ask a waiter.  So even if you are sat at the stools at the bar, you can’t ask the guys behind the bar for a drink.   You have to try and flag down a waiter, then let him take your order, watch him relay it to the bar stuff, then watch when they’ve done your drink and put it on the bar, as you can’t take it because you have to wait for the waiter to pick your drink up to hand over to you... it’s crazy!
So in summary nice hotel but Hilton have made a massive mistake letting the pool area be outsourced to another business.  It’s detrimental to residents.",3,2021,08,10
36,a great welcome to Barcelona,"My first trip to Barcelona. This hotel is very clean with well equipped rooms and very helpful personnel. A special thanks to Cecilia and Alina who work the front desk. They were both very helpful and courteous throughout my stay of seven nights.  Also, the hostess in the breakfast room, Thalita, and Fatima, one of the servers there. They provided a good  start to my day with a fine buffet. I liked that this hotel was out of the main tourist area, but a short walk from the beach. It has a nice pool with loungers and also a shaded area and bar service. The Diagonal Mar shopping center is right across the street with many stores and restaurants. There is a taxi stand right by the hotel, so you do not have to call one. I would stay here again for sure!",5,2021,08,08
36,Full service hotel at a great location,"Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona is located a short walk away from the beach at the northern edge of town in the business district. It's about half an hour away from the airport, BCN with a taxi  and a twenty minute ride on the metro to the city centre. The hotel is modern and has all the amenities you need, including an executive lounge, good size gym and an outdoor pool. The rooms are nice and big with a great view of the sea. There are several bars and restaurants and if you want to try something different then you have plenty of options around the hotel. The hotel is next to one of Barcelona's shopping malls, and 500 meters from the beach. If you have a car, parking is tricky and the hotel parking is seriously overpriced so look at options beforehand and if nothing else the shopping mall offer 3 hour free parking. A good hotel on a great location.",4,2021,08,04
36,Unexpectedly bad customer treatment August 2nd 2021,"As GOLD Hilton Honor Members after our evening' s arrival wanted to enjoy complimentary drinks/snacks ar the Puro Beach Bar / Pool.When we showed up the staff sew us off from the pool area as it is closes down - however few groups having drinking sessions.As the complimentary vouchers expire 8pm we were not served by snacks and ""having big exception"" by having free gassy water and sprite and glass of wine(as thecstaff daid).As we are a family of 5 and the vouchers issued for 2 couples we were happy to pay 5.50 for the extra gassy water- probably the ""tax for enjoying the HH benefits"".Neither the pool staff, nor the reception in charge could help us to have snacks to balance our hunger as they having they ""rules"".Despite the fact that due to covid the hotel reports low occupancy-  this ""not win-win"" treatment part probably needs imrovement in order to meet the Customer Treatment Guideline of Golden HH members.",2,2021,08,03
36,Fantastic Family Vacation,"Convenient location (beach, food, attractions) and very nice property. A majority of the staff was friendly and very helpful. Barcelona is a beautiful city and we are glad we chose the Hilton Diagonal Mar. ",4,2021,08,01
36,Irregular COVID protocols,"Before booking our hotel, we narrowed down choices based off of amenities, a gym being of high priority. We chose Hilton Diagonal Mar because we've stayed here before and almost everything is great about the hotel. However, during this trip we are extremely disappointed in management's judgment to keep the gym closed unless you make a reservation. Each guest can make a 45 min reservation for the gym and only family members may be in the gym at the same time. First of all, requiring reservations is fine, but limiting capacity to only 1 guest or guests of the same family is not necessary. Other gyms, fitness centers, etc are open and allowing limited capacity, but not so limited that it is completely restrictive. In order to get in the gym, you have to have a reservation, then call to have security open the door, while working out, they send in housekeeping to clean the gym...meanwhile in the lobby, pool, restaurant, people are crowded together, masks and unmasked, yet the gym remains closed. Several times the gym was completely booked and while sitting at the pool or restaurant where I could see in, not a soul was utilizing it. This is not the Hilton standard I'm familiar with and I'm extremely disappointed and inconvenienced. Staff is dismissive and rude, security harrasses guests, and housekeeping doesn't keep their distance. The hotel should focus on other areas of the hotel, the pool is crowded, masks are left on the ground, elevators, at the breakfast buffet (yes, it's okay to have an indoor breakfast buffet, but not an open gym), and the revolving door in and out of the hotel is filthy. We won't stay here again, the hotel claims to be practicing safe measures for COVID, but in reality, this hotel is dirtier than before the pandemic and more restrictive too. Just doesn't make sense. ",1,2021,07,27
36,nice,"nice stay, room was spacious and well equipped. breakfast great, with lot of options. It was nice we could sit outside. Room service open until 1am which was great.  Clean and they take good effort with corona restrictions.",5,2021,07,26
36,Not perfect but nice stay,Hotel recently reopened following Covid related closure. Beautiful corner suite.  Housekeeping not detail oriented had to call down for some missed items.  Friendly and helpful front desk /concierge staff.  Pool is small for such a big property. Huge pool deck with plenty of seating. Pool staff / servers constantly understaffed and overworked.  Great buffet in the morning.  Well stocked. Rooms are spacious.  Hotel is centrally located across from a large mall which offers a wide variety of dining and shopping options.  Disappointed that the Executive Lounge is still closed.  No reason for this.  ,4,2021,07,24
36,Great hotel but pool and executive lounge below average.,"I have been a guest in this hotel for many years.

The executive lounge was always the highlight of the stay.
A nice glass of wine and a huge collection of very tasty snacks.
Due to the low occupancy in the hotel the lounge is closed.

The alternative from the hotel is a voucher for 2 drinks and 1 snack.
The snack is small poor and cold, horrible.

Please also note that you have to pay for beds near the pool from Friday to Sundays.
20 or 30 euro for 2 beds and 150 euro for a cabin.

The rest of the hotel is very good as always but still a little disappointed.",4,2021,07,22
36,Dated and loud hotel,"Very friendly staff, but rooms are very dated especially the batheoom, gym pretty bad without free weights. The hotel runs Puro beach club so its a lot of youngster around not for a couple who wants a peaceful vacation. Locations is super but We will choose another hotel for sure..",1,2021,07,19
36,"Fantastic club lounge, great location, renovated rooms","Always great to be back, super nice location at the beach, best executive lounge with outdoor space to enjoy the sunset with wines from the terrace(at the moment due to covid snacks and drinks at the PuroClub). Wide variety at the breakfast buffet with outdoor space as well. Thank you so much team, primary Paola at the FD and Jeffrey at the Purobeach.
Axel",5,2021,07,09
36,Reprehensible attitude from the front office staff Franky and Mary.,I am a diamond member of Hilton and a Titanium elite of Marriot and was extremely thrilled about taking my family and niece and nephews over to Barcelona. Initially Hilton international misinformed me about the operation of the executive lounge that I booked a room for my nephew in that category in order for us all to enjoy the perks. We were later informed that the lounge was not operational due to COVID which is acceptable but they promised to provide us with water as and when we needed. However one evening when we asked the front desk for a bottle water Mary from the front office refused my wife’s request. I identified my self as a diamond member but she insisted they did not have water to provide. When I asked for a manger they refused to accede to the request. Instead a habitually grumpy and racist man franky turned up to turn the heat on. When I told him that I would report his behavior to his general manager he said he doesn’t care. He had a previous run in with my nephew when he made a fuss about issuing a key card before.It appears that franky didn’t care about senior management despite mentioning Mr Joachim Hartle name and stating you have an opportunity to apologize before I sent the email to the GM he instead decided to hang up. Don’t even bother visiting this hotel. It is a total mess and totally an unwelcoming hotel especially those of color. Whatever your status or profession may be. ,1,2021,07,03
36,Horrible Service,"Let me start out by saying I travel often and around the world for racing. This by far has been the worst experience I’ve ever had. Service was absolutely terrible, no one answers the phones and hotel staff gives you attitude for any simple request. Not to mention security follows you around if you don’t look a certain way. 
Do not stay here.
P.S. not a beach front hotel and beach club is a small pool :)",1,2021,06,25
36,Great,"Had a good time at Diagonal Mar, close to the beach and easy access to the city center. Covid 19 restrictions made it a bit weird as the pool closed early most restaurants were not opened but I would surely recommend it.",5,2021,05,29
36,Poor customer service,"Very poor customer service, unwelcome calls early in the morning from the reception, addition of unwarranted extra charges at checkout. I did not feel welcome as a Hilton member and I won’t be staying here again.",2,2021,05,10
36,Amazing Vacations,Breathless Punta Cana was an amazing time. Customer service was unparalleled and Willy(our concierge) was magnifico! We always received everything we needed and felt right at home. The house keeping and bartenders were also spot on. Thank you!,5,2021,05,02
36,The best in barcelona,"I know lot of hotels in barcelona but the best is hilton diagonal mar. perfect location (sea, shoppings, restaurants,  public transports...)
Great hotel, very nice and helpful staff. The room was nice and clean with amazing sea view. Fun pool and gym Very good Breakfast.  you have a mall and good Restaurants 2 min walk from the hotel
The staff do there best to give me a wonderfull birthday and it was they upgrade me in a superieur room at 19floor with amazing view of the sea",5,2020,09,27
36,Lovely hotel and staff,"We had a lovely long weekend in Barcelona at the end of February.  We always stay in a Hilton if at all possible and the deal we booked luckily included staying at the Diagonal Mar. Lovely welcome - nothing was too much trouble - lots of information on the metro and how to get around to get the most out of our stay.  
The room was spacious, comfortable and spotlessly clean as was the bathroom area.
On the first morning, the hairdryer stopped working almost immediately and I rang Reception without a lot of hope - in less than five minutes, a member of the Housekeeping team was at my door with an excellent replacement - very impressed.
There was a lovely food court directly opposite the hotel with a number of restaurants which covered for all tastes.
The breakfast eggs bendict in the bar dining area was excellent and very good value for money.
For us, Hilton came up trumps again and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend

",5,2020,03,20
36,Beautiful View,"At check in I received a very warm welcome and a free upgrade which gave me a beautiful sea view and use of the executive lounge. My stay was filled with warm & friendly service throughout!  It is a beautiful hotel with all the amenities you need.  The location is right be the sea and next to a large mall with several restaurants that have outdoor patios.
I will definitely return.",5,2020,03,13
36,Business and multipurpose ,"The hotel is located in front of a mall, where you can go to shopping any time you want, (restaurant, cinema and more) next to the ocean with a beautiful view of you choose a room with ocean view. The arrival is easy from the train station or airport by taxi . I highly recommend the dinner at the executive room, you will love a glass of white wine to relax after business meetings. The personnel is so nice and friendly, they make me feel very welcome full time. I will be back for sure. ",5,2020,03,05
36,Excellent stay at HIlton Diagnol Mar,"We booked our stay on points for our honeymoon, and the hotel was sold out at the time so we were only able to get a two twin rooms. We reached out a few weeks prior asking if it was possible to switch our room and they said they would into look into it if something became available. Enrica reached out the day before and provided a wondeful upgrade for us, as well as champagne in the room, and access to the executive lounge. Even without these upgrades the hotel was fantastic, but she really made the trip amazing for us, and introduced herself when we checked in. Even though this Hilton if further out from the main drag, I would stay here in a heartbeart for the outstanding service, amenties, staff and breakfast. It's also very close to the metro, so getting around was easy. Thank you for making our honeymoon so excellent! We hope to return!",5,2020,03,03
36,Working VayKay,"I stayed here with my husband while he was on a business trip. Loved our room, large floor to ceiling windows gave us a beautiful city view. The breakfast was amazing but pricy. Location was great with shopping and restaurants right across the street and the ocean was 2 streets over.  Room was clean and spacious. Staff was very friendly.",4,2020,02,25
36,Nice experience Barcelona,Hilto diagonal Mar is located right next to the Barcelona exhibition and convention centre..but about 10km away from the city. For shopping theres a huge shopping mall ibfront of the hotel. Also metro is available within 5mins walking .overall very good business hotel.,4,2020,02,25

36,Magic memories,"The taxi from the airport was stressful and expensive, but as soon as we arrived at the entrance a member of staff came out to help us and instantly we felt welcomed and cared for.  Be careful of the Barcelona black and yellow taxis...they sting you.
The Hilton was the perfect location (by the sea) with the most stunning views of the town.  It was spotlessly clean, warm and safe.  I can’t wait to return one day. ",5,2020,02,23

36,"Great Hotel, Great Location","Great hotel very close to the beach and at the start of the Diagonal road. Friendly, helpful staff and comfy room with nice bathroom too.  The Executive Lounge was a great respite as well and the in-house restaurant had a great menu",5,2020,01,16
36,Great Hotel - a little bit away from the city centre,I very much like the Hilton Diagonal del Mar Barcelona. The rooms are spacious and the service is fantastic. It is great for a run in the morning along the beach. Across the street you find a shopping centre and after a few stops you are with the underground train in the city. Great place to stay!,5,2020,01,15
36,Great view for beach,"Not a great location for the visitors who like walking and exploring the city center, but it is a nice place for chilling, especially the sea, the sky and the sun. I tried walked from the hotel to the city center along with the coastline, it was a very relaxing experience and more engaged in the city vibe.",4,2020,01,15
36,"very Comfortable hotel, exceptional service",Very comfortable hotel and close to eating and shopping. However you’ll need to take a taxi (readily available) to major sites. Amazing view! Would be great in the summer!  Close to beach and the pool looks clean and hip. ,5,2020,01,14
36,"Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona "" top as usual""",great welcome and services; good location and perfect location for pleasure and business. I would recommand it to anyone looking for a great location and high level of service with casual atmosphere. top of the expectation.,5,2020,01,14
36,Great location for business and more,"I had a great experience of the Hilton brand - hotel, service, professionalism all very high.  Nice views of Med, great balcony experience from the Exec Lounge if you are entitled.   Great buffet breakfast selection.  Friendly staff in every location.",5,2020,01,12
36,Reasonable New Year Stay,"Stayed in Barcelona for New Year - chose this hotel as I am typically fond of the Hilton Brand and enjoy staying at their hotels. The hotel itself is very clean, modern and well located opposite the Diagonal Mar shopping centre with restaurants nearby. 

Positives 
- Service was generally good from everyone I interacted with. 
- Hotel is new, modern and clean, and very near to the beach
- Quiet floors and modern fittings. A Good standard business hotel. 
- Reasonable, safe (if uninspiring) Neighbourhood. If you wants sights or culture then you may be better staying more into the centre of Barcelona as this felt a long way out. 

Negatives
- The F&B service is generally poor. Breakfast is loud, noisy and chaotic, and when we were there it was clear that the staff had trouble meeting the holiday demand. it was in no way a relaxing or peaceful start to the day. 
- Room Service is VERY expensive for the quality of the food offered. I paid a lot of money for some basic meals which didn't live up to expectations. Avoid if possible. 
- some weird choices, I wanted to post some postcards home to family and even though the cards had a stamp on, I was told it would still be 2 Euros 50 to send these as the hotel had an arrangement with a private company but I could walk and find find a phone box. 
- Public transport isn't hugely convenient - its a good 5 or 6 minute walk to the nearest metro station but there are taxis nearby which aren't too expensive if you're going into Barcelona.",4,2020,01,08
36,Probably the best hotel in Barcelona,"Extremely friendly staff and they simply overwhelmed us with their hospitality. Hilton Diagonal Mar, Barcelona knows how to treat guests. Particularly when there are special occasions like new year and birthdays! They simply gave their best - each and every staff member. It is also conveniently located with a beautiful shopping mall next door and the beach, which is just 3 min away by foot! Thank you Hilton for making our stay memorable ",5,2020,01,07
36,Stay - December 2019,Friendly hotel with clean facilities in a beautiful city of Barcelona. Staff at the lobby was very efficient. Breakfast crowded till 10:00 - difficult to be seated. Rooms are comfortable and quite. Lounge area very crowded ,4,2020,01,05
36,Break ,"As I have been to this hotel about four times with its fantastic location next to the beach on one side and a nice shopping centre on the other with a fantastic choice of food & restaurants ,, 
The only reason I gave it two stars is not because of the staff which I found very helpful BUT because of the exclusive lounge  !! for the extra cost I paid it definitely wasn’t worth it , Half the time the coffee machine didn’t have any coffee no hot water or milk ,,complete mess and no one to ask for any service in the lounge. compared to any other hotel lounges I have been to this must be the worst !!!! I have never had experience like that last time we were there ,, 
In the evening a couple of times we went and found that they had limited of two plates of snacks for almost 20 people which I found really poor and No service ,, 
It’s about time you sort yourself out Hilton diagonal Mar !! this is the last time we will visit this hotel what a shame !!
As I notice there are many other hotels nearby now ",2,2020,01,02
36,HILTON par exellance ,"I already enjoy over many many HILTONs world wide but the Diagonal Mar Barcelona nailed it !!! 
I have never experienced such a perfect stay before.
Starting from pre-arrival with an excellent help from Front Office and Concierge Team who help us to get a lovely Christmas in Barcelona, over the extraordinary quality of the Breakfast and its fascinating organized and fast service-team. 
The Bar is definitely first class Quality!
Thumbs up for Housekeeping with attention to detail.

Team Hilton Diagonal Mar - You are the example of hospitality.

36,"Great staff, great view, complete breakfast","The front desk staff went out of their way to ensure I ended up in a room I enjoyed. Breakfast was comprehensive and in keeping with the Hilton brand. The sunrise I exoerienced from my room was breath-taking. The Executive Lounge had an open bar from 6-8 and very small bites, with terrace seating. I definitely recommend this hotel if you want to stay in this area and/or stay loyal to Hilton.",5,2019,12,27
36,50/50,"The hotel is amazing, friendly staff and o was very satisfied with the room. The only disappointment was the lounge. Being a diamond member and enjoying the lounge in many countries, the lounge had no food available at anytime and it’s closed 10 minutes early (10 minutes to 8pm). I have to say the bartender, he was very nice and even offered a wine tasting session when I wasn’t sure what wine to take. ",4,2019,12,25
36,Great spot.  Great rooms. Will return.,"This hotel is located in Barcelona close to the beach and within walking distance of many attractions.  The hotel does not operate the pool area, but there is a section set aside for hotel guests.  The pool is trendy and the bar is great.

The rooms are freshly updated and quite comfortable, however, the mini bar had open items that I reported and they still charged me.  It was corrected, but a hassle none the less. 

Only real room is was that the shower was less than average with water going everywhere.

Attentive staff!  Though the lounge did not serve breakfast until late and we had an early morning flight.",4,2019,12,23
36,Short Break before Bones Festives,"Haven’t been here for about four years but it is still as good as before.
The reason for writing this review was the excellent service from Paola from check in to check out.
I couldn’t compliment her professionalism any more, the speed and politeness she showed after a long journey was totally appreciated, it started our break off in the perfect manner, thank you Paola.",5,2019,12,23
36,"Great location to shopping, restaurants, and attractions.","We chose this hotel because of the brand and proximity to places we wanted to be. Although it is not in the Old Town area, getting around the city is easy by subway, and we had a awesome ocean view of the sunrise each morning from the 17th floor. All of the staff we encountered were great, friendly, helpful, sharing of recommendations of places to eat at for quality Catalan cuisine. à great stay at this property overall. ",5,2019,12,12
36,"Great Weekend, Great Hotel",I wanted to go to Barcelona for the weekend and the hospitality at this hotel made my stay there really enjoyable. Staff was very responsive and charming. The shopping mall is across the street and there are great restaurants there too. You can't go wrong staying here.,5,2019,12,05
36,Like as a beach hotel.,"I stayed this hotel twice time. First one was last year at June 2018. I supposed I was in the dream. The hotel position, beach, swimming pool, weather, especially executive lounge foods and drinks, perfect breakfast etc. Becuase of this this year me and my son stayed this hotel. This was miserable. Especially executive lounge, they served just one appetizer and easy hot veggie food (just one). Everyday same things. They have no bottled regular water, they serve tap water. They have one water with gas, it was very salty. I complaint this situation, but there was no change. I did not understand. The same hotel, one time is very positive, the other time is very very negative.",1,2019,12,05
36,One of the best Hilton properties out there.,"Checked in around  6pm on a Wednesday. Very efficient. We were upgraded to sea view on executive floor. Room was amazing and clean. Went down to the executive lounge which was not very crowded. Went outside and gazed on the Barcelona skyline. 
Breakfast was great and had a lot of choices.",5,2019,12,05
36,Too much smell,"The hotel has a good location, the smell of hotel is terrible , I all of the hotel you can smell something like Arabic perfume.
The staff are very slow in reservation and do not care about you that you are tired of your travelling or not.",2,2019,12,04
36,Not Hilton standard - far from public transport - terrible internet connection (wifi and land),"I came here as a recommendation for business however there were closer and nicer hotels to our venue. Stayed longer to enjoy Barcelona. 

*ROOMS: OK, but not Hilton standard. Some mold and chipped paint, it rained and the room smelled musky. 

*FOOD: Skip the in-room tea/coffee. It is the cheapest, low quality I have ever experienced. Breakfast was OK. I would expect more from a Hilton. There was canned fruit options, for instance. 

*Internet: the real reason I am giving low - the internet connection was TERRIBLE. The wifi I had to keep reconfiguring to work. I couldn't complete some online transactions because it was so dodgy. Even the business center computers was slow and barely worked. 

ACCESS: This hotel is about a 15 minute walk from the nearest metro. About 40 minutes+ of a metro ride to get to any main city attractions. That means you are around an hour away from anything touristy. 

FITNESS: Good fitness center. Only one treadmill but strong variety of other machines and weights. Clean.",2,2019,12,04
36,Lovely hotel very professional,"Client chose hotel and what a lovely choice.  Nice rooms, comfortable beds, professional and efficient staff.  Breakfast was varied, and lots of choices.

Across the road are some restuarants if you dont want hotel food all day every day.

Would stay here again when coming to the centre of the city",5,2019,11,29
36,Perfect,"The Hilton Diagonal Mar was perfect for our two day stay in Barcelona.  Beautiful property, incredible views, great food, and a fantastic staff - like I said, perfect!  We used our Hilton Honors points, so the price was right as well.",5,2019,11,27
36,Excellent Hotel with a Great Staff,"We stayed for a week at the Hilton Diagonal Mar, and had a fantastic time.  We ate at Aurt one evening and had a wonderful experience. The staff was great always asking if we needed anything, and very helpful when we did.  The executive lounge was fantastic too with a great breakfast and happy hour.  I liked that this hotel was a bit outside the downtown area, it was simple to take the train down a few stops, and extremely cheap (bought a 10 pack for 10 euros), I also liked that there was a mall across the street so if you wanted a quick bite to eat, or needed something you forgot, or just like to shop like my wife, you could go there and get what you needed.  I will def be back!!",5,2019,11,27
36,Amazing trip!,"We were only here for one night stopping through on our honeymoon and it was the best hotel
Experience I’ve ever had. We both felt like royalty! Enrica was so great! We were immediately greeted at the front door and someone helped us with our bags and gave us great recommendations on where to eat. ",5,2019,11,24
36,Nice hotel in Very good section of the town,"This is a busy professional hotel that has many upscale amenities,  a gym ,a bar ,a restaurant.  Breakfast is included and it's extensive.  The rooms are very modern and complete.  The mini bar even has a shelf to use for ""your own"" refrigerator items. As you would expect a Hilton to be, excellent.  Close to public transportation, too.",5,2019,11,22
36,I was robbed in the hotel ON THE FRONT DESK,I was robbed on the hotel FRONT DESK while checking in ! i chased the robber and they saw me asking for help but security let him out anyways and said it was my problem THEY WOULDNT EVEN CALL THE POLICE  DO NOT STAY THEREEEEEE,1,2019,11,18
36,We cannot believe the less than stellar reviews. Our stay was without peer!,"O.K., we did not look at the TripAdvisor reviews before we booked this hotel, having quite a few HHonors points and holding Diamond status, we just found a hotel close to downtown, and specifically close to the Port of Barcelona, the airport, and Familia Sagrada.

The Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona filled the bill for us.

We then contacted the hotel as our cruise ship would be arriving into the Port of Barcelona early in the morning, but not early enough to book a tour to the Familia Sagrada. We found a tour (through Viator) that would allow us to see the Familia Sagrada AND the Park Guell in the afternoon.

We asked if the hotel could arrange livery for us to and from the tour.

There were many staff members at the Hilton with whom we worked to arrange this: Ariana Fernandez  did the heavy lifting in arranging a car (driven by ""Felix"" both to and from the tour- a real peach of a man, funny, knowledgeable, competent, and punctual) - which was billed to our room; and Omar Romero.

Ah, Mr. Romero! We arrived at the hotel REALLY EARLY in the morning (our scheduled transfer would have had us stay at the cruise port for 3 hours- we took a cab, which, by the way, was a LOT less expensive than using Suntransfers.com- less than half!) and arrived around 9:00 a.m.
Obviously, our booked rooms were not available that early in the morning. However, Mr. Romero had TWO rooms (we needed two) that were on the Executive Floor, which gave us access to the Executive Club, which Mr. Romero was able to ""upsell"" to us for €60 per room. AND we could have immediate access to the rooms!

Well, duh!

So, we got  a wonderful breakfast and snacks and the next morning's breakfast for €60 per room and were able to shower and lie down after arriving early in the morning. Four adults. Cheap and more than convenient.

The rooms were fine. Quiet, well appointed, with comfy beds. Again, the other reviews on this hotel do not do the rooms justice. Maybe the rooms that were described by others were not on the Executive floor. 

The bellman fell all over himself to help us with luggage, the front desk staff helped us break some large denomination Euro currency into smaller ones.

The stay at this hotel could not have been nicer- and the hotel was having a huge conference of tech folks (CIT and EVP level folks) but still made us feel like we were the only guests they had that day, night, and next morning.

Truly, the view from the Executive Club was remarkable (and, if you smoke, you may smoke on the Executive Club veranda as it is incredibly spacious.)

We did choose to dine across the street from the hotel at the shopping mall, not for any specific reason- the hotel has restaurants with very inventive menu offerings. 

Now, if you wanted to, instead of taking a car or a cab from the hotel to the Familia Sagrada you could use the Metro for a fraction of the cost of a car or a cab- the station is a really short walk from the hotel. We just chose to use a car service (again, Felix) because we do not know our way around Barcelona.

Yet.

But when we come back, we WILL stay at the Hilton Diagonal Mar Hotel.

Good job, everyone at the hotel!

By they way- the airport is about an hour's drive via car service from the hotel. The cruiseport is about a half hour. The Familia Sagrada is about 20 minutes away.",5,2019,11,14
36,nice hotel but the rooms need some urgent TLC,"Nice hotel.  Whether you like this location is a matter of personal preference.  It's close to the beach and opposite a huge shopping mall.  As a business hotel, I would say it's perfectly located.  If your main interest is the beach, same thing. If you want to explore the city centre of Barcelona, the location is rather remote.  But taxi's are cheap and there is a metro station closeby. 
The rooms are clean and convenient but could use some urgent TLC, especially the bathroom.  
Staff is very friendly and professional, as you would expect in a Hilton.  
Overall we had a pleasant stay but our next stay would rather be after some refurbishing.",3,2019,11,14
36,Average,"Nice hotel with up and downs, great breakfast variety and quality rom as usual, service very helpful, cleaning of room not 5 star hotel. It’s far from the center, 25min by public therefore we expected an excellent hotel ",3,2019,11,13
36,"Location bad, service mediocre","The location is not very good if you wish to see or do anything in Barcelona. Sure the beach is nearby and there’s also a food court, but you’ll need a 15 min cab drive as a minimum to experience anything that doesn’t feel like a business center. 

Breakfast is mediocre, considering the price. The gym is okay, and the pool area is nice. I would only go here for business. ",3,2019,11,13
36,Great stay,"The hotel was very nice. The hotel staff was very pleasant to interact with. They quickly resolved the only minor issues that we encountered and they were very helpful both at check in and throughout the stay.

Will definitely look to stay here again during my next Barcelona trip. ",5,2019,11,12
36,Top hotel Barcelona,"This is my 4rd time I stay in this hotel while being in Barcelona.        Friendly staff, perfect service, nice & quiet rooms.  Perfectly   situated next to the congress center and to visit the city by taxi or public transport.",5,2019,11,06
36,Great location and service,"This is a comfortable accessible hotel in the heart of Barcelona.
Diagonal mar mall across the street and the sea is two blocks away.
Helpful staff will arrange tours. It seems all staff speak English even the wait staff in the comprehensive breakfast buffet which is open until 10:30 am for weary travellers.",5,2019,11,06
36,Nice hotel in town,My wife and I were in Barcelona on a business/leisure trip and stayed on night at the Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona. We enjoyed the stay. The hotel is very conveniently located across the street from shopping and dining.,5,2019,11,05
36,Beautiful Hotel,"The hotel was beautiful and the staff was awesome! The tour busses picked us up right outside the hotel. It is located a few miles from the center of town so not really walkable, but only a short cab ride and there is a cab stand right at the corner.
Again, the staff was awesome!",5,2019,11,05
36,Good hotel,"We stayed here on a business trip. We had a friendly and welcoming checkin. The room was nice and user friendly. The breakfast was superb if very busy. Waiters were helpful and friendly.
At reception I asked what time the pool opened and I was told 10am! I was so disappointed as I wanted to swim before breakfast and work. It was a waste of time bringing my cozzie!
Overall we had a good stay and would probably stay there again.",4,2019,10,30
36,Excellent Hotel and Location!,"Nice hotel, excellent staff and location.   Right across the street is a mall with many American restaurants.  The beach is in walking distance of hotel.  There are also many attractions nearby.  The breakfast is wonderful with many, many choices.  ",5,2019,10,28
36,STAY AT HILTON EVERYWHERE YOU TRAVEL,"Great hotel. Highly recommended! You’ll love the Executive Lounge. Great service from every staff.
Across a nice shopping mall and overlooking the beach. Taxis readily available lining up in front of hotel. ",5,2019,10,28
36,"Good location for the convention crowd, not as good for the tourist one","Located immediately adjacent to the Barcelona convention center, the Hilton was a great place to stay for the conference I was attending.  A short walk from entrance to entrance (although strangely you couldn't exit the Hilton on the side nearest the convention center so you had to walk around the whole building), made it easy to get back to the room during down times.  The rooms were well appointed and up to date (numerous USB outlets).  I used the gym everyday I was there. It was never crowded (I was often the only one there) and had plenty of equipment.  The breakfast they offered was fairly standard fair but quite sprawling in its offerings - meats, cheeses, fruits, eggs, breads, cereals, waffles, and pancakes.  

Although close to the convention center (and the Mediterranean which I could enjoy from my window), it is removed from the primary hub of tourist activities.  The old town portion of the city is not really a walkable distance from the city and it is about a 35-45 minute metro ride to get there.  Not terrible but also not in the center of the action.

On check in, you are asked for your cell phone number, which the front desk was able to use to text me when my room was ready.  Then I got a text checking on my stay.   Then I got a text wishing me safe travels since I was checking out the next day.  Problem was, I wasn't checking out the next day.  I was supposed to be staying one more day.  I tried texting back to clarify the situation but got nothing in return.  If you are going to use my number to send me messages, how about getting the information right and then responding when I send a question about your mistake. This was an unnecessary annoyance that adds nothing to the quality of the stay and in this case, caused unnecessary stress.",4,2019,10,27
36,Class reunion,"We stayed in Hilton Diagonal for 2 nights.It just caught my attention the 2 server at breakfast buffet Amelia and Michael, very friendly and caring.They had given us tips what we have to do and visits in Barcelona,Spain.Very commedable employees of Hilton diagonal.",5,2019,10,26
36,Disappointing Experience,"This was our 3rd visit to Barcelona and we had fond memories of our stay at the Hilton Diagonal Mar Hotel. On previous visits we had really enjoyed our executive room experience which had access to the executive lounge. The executive lounge offered a wide range of drinks and snacks and staff were available throughout the day to give advice regarding places to visit and general issues. 

However, our 3rd visit to this hotel was a total disappointment as snacks and drinks were not fully on offer as stated in the hotel information we were provided with upon check in. Having stayed 3 days there was only 1 day where there was an afternoon cake and no other snacks available other than stale crisps. Food from 6pm till 8pm was extremely limited to a sandwich and vegetable quiche or samosa placed on three plates in the communal area and no salads or cheeses or bread selection as we had previously experienced however crisps in abundance. People who were visiting the also had to bring fast food into the lounge as there was so little to eat. (This matter was brought to the attention of the reception staff who stated that the executive lounge food had changed and been reduced as directed by Hilton).  The lounge was also understaffed and no staff present for long periods throughout the day due to staff needing to cover the hotel reception area as explained by reception staff). The view from the executive lounge had not changed and is spectacular and I will be sad not to return as we were going to visit with our two sons next year but having had this experience we have decided to cancel our next reservation. We paid extra for access to the lounge but what a total disappointment!",4,2019,10,24
36,Very nice hote,Very nice hotel.  The only drawback:  Why is the pool open only from 10:00am - 6:00pm?   You cannot swim before or after day activities.  Other hotels have pool open early or late or both.  Very well run breakfast buffet.  ,4,2019,10,24
36,"NIce location, poor service",Nice location but very poor service. They seldom provided useful information. The executive lounge has a beautiful view but items were of low value. They seemed unfamiliar with the area and thus not a good source of information,1,2019,10,22
36,Family trip to Spain,We were a family of 4 staying in their rooms with a fold out couch. They came up quickly to set it up. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The breakfast was quite good. Much better than typical hotel breakfasts when I travel for business.,5,2019,10,21
36,Perfect Rest & Relaxation!,"We recently visited Barcelona for a second time, and wanted our 3 1/2 day/3 night stay to focus on restful time by the water, not sightseeing. With the Purobeach Club on site and the beach only a short walk away, this hotel was the perfect choice. Also, when we wanted to get out, there were always taxicabs lined up nearby, and a conveniently located bus stop across the street. We enjoyed great staff, hospitality, and grand breakfast buffets at the hotel. Also, the Moet Ice Imperial Champagne offered at the Purobeach made our stay extra fabulous. We thoroughly enjoyed everything about this property, including its close proximity to our cruise terminal. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone desiring to be outside of the high traffic tourist zone. ",5,2019,10,20
36,Phenomenal Service,"The experience was absolutely amazing from the customer service, rooms, and location!  The staff was readily available to answer questions and recommended some amazing sights. The location was convenient to many eateries and a Mall across the street.  The Metro was about a 5 minute walk. Very convenient I say. ",5,2019,10,20
36,Feeling at Home,I would recommend the Hilton Diagonal Mar to everyone visiting the Barcelona area. The service provided by Basile at the front desk was perfect for our first visit to Barcelona!  The hotel provided a home like point of reference for our first journey to a Spanish speaking country. The breakfast is a must do in regard to the overall differences in cuisine both Spanish and contemporary. A great trip we will be doing again in the future!,5,2019,10,17
36,Excellent as always,"This is a beautiful hotel in a nice district in Barcelona. I had a partial view of the Mediterranean from my room. Breakfast was very good and as always at Hilton, treated me wonderfully. Highly recommend.",5,2019,10,14
36,"Excellent Hotel, it’s really recommended","Typical Hilton Hotel, high standard, luxury, clean and modern, nice staff and great breakfast.
Had the opportunity to use Hilton Honors private área  in the fifteen floor but it didn’t make any difference as the hotel per se is great.
The cons: location, please don’t get me wrong, it is located in a modern area, near to one of the beaches beach and a large shopping mall, but it is quite distant to the city center and main touristic points requiring to use public transportation. The Hopon/hop off bus stop is located in the corner and subway is 500 metres. 
Second bad point, the rent a car company inside the hotel tried to charge us an absurd for a day renting of an compact car, killing our initiative to visit Montserrat.",5,2019,10,13
36,Facilities did not match price and level of hotel,"The hotel did not match the level of service and comfort offered in similar hotels. It was impersonal and the focus seemed to be mostly on making money on the reputation of the name, not the service (old bathrobes, stains in room, tap falling off, shower out of reach). What disturbed me the most was that the staff did not seem happy and motivated to work there. It made me wonder if they treat them as badly as their customers. I feel bad to post such a terrible review, but hopefully it will redirect you to a more pleasant stay while in Barcelona and help the hotel to improve (can't be fun making money that way).",2,2019,10,13
36,Barcelona Visit,"Very gracious staffing throughout the hotel.  Close walk to beach, subway, shopping (grocery/mall), restaurants(pizzeria, tapas, paella, Five Guys Burger, etc.), cab ride away to Old Towne for Barcelona Cooking Class, people watching, drinking, walking, buys.

We upgraded to Executive Level with Lounge access...I’ve experienced better...but wasn’t bad.  Great staff!

Pool closes at 8pm, so no night swims or lounging with friends and drinks for the perfect end to a busy day....leaving only the Lobby Lounge, which is empty with no entertainment at night.  They need something for guests that don’t want to venture out at night and don’t want to stay in a room.",4,2019,10,13
36,Fine for conference - Exceptional Staff,"This place is right next to the CCIB and as such it does a good job of being very convenient for conferences.
The rooms are clean but it could be better in a couple of respects most notably the water pressure is weak in the shower and the shower is just a hose on the bath.
The breakfast is also a bit ""Travel-lodgey"" if that makes any sense.
However the staff are exceptionally friendly and helpful.",3,2019,10,10
36,Phenomenal Residency,"On a scale of 1-10, I rank this hotel a rate 10...

Spacious, nice few, and a great breakfast. set-up. 

Would highly recommend to potential customers.

The facility is very modern, located near Barcelona Beach and shopping mall directly across the street. 

Geographical amazement for tourists and business trip with convenient access to Hop on and Hop off City Tourism. 

Live the dream with Relaxation and Excitement. 

",5,2019,10,09
36,Far from the action,"I would say that in terms of value for money, this is highly rated. It's a fine hotel for the money we spent, but you're really far from all the action of Barcelona. It's not all that accessible by public transit so expect to take cabs everywhere.

The pool is absolutely excellent and could not recommend it more. 

Overall, it's a 3.5 star hotel with a 5 star pool. Staff doesn't seem to want to accommodate you the best they can. If you're expecting a USA Hilton (or even Hampton Inn) level of service you're probably not going to find it here. It was a beautiful hotel, with spacious rooms, but just not brilliant. Great for business travel though! ",3,2019,10,09
36,Amazing,What an amazing hotel.  The staff is great and there breakfast buffet was amazing.  Location is great right near the beach.  A great shopping mall right across the street with great restaurants.  The hop on hop off stop is also right next to hotel.,5,2019,10,09
36,Hilton Diagonal,"Lovely hotel, clean, friendly staff, good location to use the Hop onHop off business Barcelona. Very easy to get a cab at this hotel, easy walk to the Mediterranean. Concerige is able to assist in purchasing tickets to attractions and make recommendations for best method of transportation to sites. They have a lounge with food and beverages, outdoor balcony, worth the cost.",5,2019,10,08
36,True to expectations,"After a boutique hotel experience in Florence (Hotel Cellai which was wonderful) we were concerned that we would not find the same kind of charm and service in a major name. Although Diagonal Mar Hilton is big we had great service from all but one person we came across. From Rene concierge, to the men and women at the reception who assisted in our booking tours, changing restaurant plans and fixing a drain that didn't drain in the shower. Great bar to where we retire each evening to talk about the highlights of the day and what we have planned the next. Great breakfast spread and an industrial size Nespresso machine which is welcome every morning!",4,2019,10,07
36,"Nice Venue, great breakfast but service and facilities less than required for Hilton","Nice venue with easy access to shopping mall, metro and beach. Service lower than expected for a Hilton hotel. The Refrigerator in the hotel was out of order when i first enter the room. I informed room service and reception about the problem. There were very polite but after 3 days the refrigerator was not fixed...  ",3,2019,10,05
36,Wonderful Stay,"We recently stayed here for two night before our cruise.  This is a wonderful hotel with excellent customer service.  We arrived early and our room wasn’t ready so we were went to the Executive Lounge until the room was ready.  From the Executive Lounge we enjoyed the amazing views of Barcelona and the Mediterranean.  Our room was ready quickly and we checked in.  The room was amazing, comfortable bed, clean, amazing views of the city and Mediterranean, large bathroom with Jacuzzi tub and fluffy robes, separate area with closet/mini bar, large sleeping area with desk/make up mirror.  We had our breakfast outside in the Executive Lounge each morning enjoying the views.  We didn’t use the pool but it looked great.  We enjoyed wine and dessert at night on the first floor.  There is a large shopping mall across the street with a supermarket on the ground floor that had everything, including distilled water.  There were restaurants on the first level.  We bought tickets from the concierge and went on the Hop On Hop Off bus to see the city.  I highly recommend this hotel.  Although it was away from the heart of the city, it worked perfectly for us.",5,2019,10,04
36,Beware - Check your account when you Check Out!,"The hotel is beautiful and very well kept up. The executive lounge has lots of room and offers a good selection for breakfast and appetizers in the evening. The views from it are amazing. 

We had a executive king room. It was very nice and spacious with a beautiful view of the Mediterranean. 

The hotel is about 5 minute walk from the Metro and next to a mall, with several places to eat. 

We arrived at the hotel around noon. We knew our room most likely wouldn’t be ready. It ended up not being ready until after 5pm, which was disappointing. 

So why did I give it one star? ...... We prepaid for our room a few days before arrival. When we checked in, I was then charged again, 2 more times. I had to dispute it with the front desk to get it adjusted. 

After checking out, 3 days later I checked my cc account & the hotel charged our card several times for random amounts. I had to contact Hilton directly to get the amounts refunded. Will never stay here again! ",1,2019,10,03
36,Great stay at a beautiful property!,"Had such a nice stay at this incredible Hilton! Gabriel and Paula were incredibly helpful and so kind! The hotel is so clean and pretty. The breakfast was one of the best I've had a hotel, so much food! ",5,2019,10,01
36,Mixed staff performance & aging property ,"Poor location far from city life and beach attractions.  30 min to convention center

Hotel is lower quality than most hilton and beginning to show its age.  

The good:   Select staff especially at front desk.  Manager is excellent and Paola took great pride in her work.  Really professional and committed
Rooms are nice especially those wirh sea view.  
Convention capabilities are excellent

The bad:  Marina at front desk clearly hates her job and her customer service skills reflect this status.   The lobby bar is also mixed.   One server won’t let you shift chairs to accomadate larger groups.  He is aggressive and unprofessional 
In short, if you can stay elsewhere.  

",2,2019,09,30
36,Great Quiet Option,"If you’ve previously been to Barcelona and want more of a local experience then I highly recommend this place. 

Pros
Across the street from a mall that has several restaurant options, apparel shopping, and a grocery store. 
5 Minute walk to the beach 
Pool Club
Easy/quick check in and check out process 
I received an upgrade to an oceanfront view. 

Cons
Definitely not the touristy part of Barcelona and quite a walk to get there. 
Not many local markets nearby outside of big grocery store ",4,2019,09,29
36,Nice hotel with friendly staff,I stayed in this hotel for a week in August 2019. The hotel was nice with friendly staff. The hotel is located a few minutes from the beach and there is a mall across from the hotel with several good restaurants. The executive lounge was so busy during my stay that at times it looked like everyone had access to the lounge. The pool area is very nice but it is shared with Purobeach restaurant so there are limited sunbeds available to hotel guests.,4,2019,09,28
36,Amazing stay!!!,"My stay in Hilton was lovely. The weather was great and we could enjoy the city and the beach.
The breakfast was really good specially because we met Geraldine (such a lovely girl)! She greet us with a smile that made our day! Can’t wait to be back!

Thank you so much!!!",5,2019,09,27
36,I’ll be back Hilton Diagonal Mar!,"We decided to stay at the Hilton Diagonal Mar for amenities, convenience, and familiar accommodations. We arrived in Barcelona 3 days before our Mediterranean cruise. 

The hotel was close to the port and all types of transportation. The breakfast buffet was excellent. It offered a variety of options that included fresh smoothies, cereals, granola, pancakes, and the staples of a typical breakfast served in America and locally.  Servers were very attentive with clearing dishes, refilling drinks and offering to bring seconds from the buffet. 

The hotel was very clean. My room was modern and very comfortable. The front desk staff are fluent in English and  attentive. We were able to exchange dollars for Euros and the Diagonal Mar shopping center is across the street. There are a variety of restaurants, department stores and a full value priced grocery store similar to a Meijers/Target/WalMart. All accessible from inside the mall. 

The sightseeing trolley stop is down the street. The immediate area is residential and businesses. We enjoyed our stay and plan to return on our next visit.",5,2019,09,26
36,Avoid this Hotel,"The executive lounge had the worst quality of food I have ever experienced in traveling 65 countries. They tried to overcharge me any way they could and when I challenged them, the manager was rude and argumentative. They do not represent Hilton quality. The beach was poor for the area.",1,2019,09,22
36,Great Hotel and location,"Stayed here for a 4 day business meeting. My room was on the 8th floor with a fantastic view of the ocean. Each morning around 7:00 I was able to watch the sun rise over the ocean. Breakfast buffet was great with a large variety of breads and cheeses. Each morning there is an omelet station, mamosas, smoothies and fresh fruit. Food quality was excellent. One block from the beach. Beautiful location across from a mall. ",5,2019,09,21
36,"Disgusting smell, rude staff","The staff appeared friendly, however it did not feel genuine. We were rushed and were interrupted whenever we had questions and were advised to wait until they’re done first. The hotel price is also definitely not worth the quality. There is a horrible smell in the hallway daily, it was disgusting. The walls are very thin and you can hear EVERYTHING. The staff insisted the hotel was full and could not accommodate our AMEX room upgrade but it was not full. And the room service is slow. The location is okay, close walk to a beach and in front of a shopping mall. But far removed from the city centre. So the location description is actually deceiving.

Sink and toilet are not cleaned. We got daily room turndown but the staff never replaced our used glasses and coffee mugs, and left items that are clearly for disposal on the counters it made absolutely no sense. ",1,2019,09,19
36,Great city break,"We had a lovely city break last week in Barcelona. The hotel is well located for the beach , just a 5 min walk. Across the road from a large shopping centre & close to the metro & hop on/off tour bus route. It is a way out of the city centre but easy to get there via public transport. Overall has a lovely feel, spacious reception / bar area.
Very good breakfast selection & enjoyed the outside seating area. i enjoyed the pool area though would not appeal to all tastes with the music & ibiza club feel. The free sun beds were comfortable & close enough to the pool. i felt the drinks were expensive there. 
We received an upgrade to an executive room on the 22nd floor. Great view out to sea & good size bathroom. We used the executive lounge every day & i loved the outside terrace which gave a great view out to sea & over the city. Good drink selection, limited canapes but were different every day so gave a good choice for us.
i found the level of service very good across all areas from reception , breakfast , pool & the lounge. Concierge was also very good on our leaving day . Amelia was very good & gave some good tips to my wife on places she was looking to visit.
i use the Hilton brand a lot for business & i found this location at the higher end of the scale for properties . Overall a great trip with a very good hotel team & i would certainly return.
One complaint was the reduction of room rate after we had gone but i think that was due to a large conference going on that week which finished on our last day & probably pushed up the rates for the time of year.",5,2019,09,18
36,Clean and comfortable accomodation!,"Enjoyed a lovely stay at this hotel. 

I very much appreciated the cleanliness of the hotel, rooms, and public spaces. The business center on the 2nd floor has an excellent and abundant supply of computers and printing/copying services for your convenience. 

The front desk staff, housekeepers and bar staff were all wonderful and helpful. They provided information with local amenities and fantastic recommendations. 

We had a rental car and opted to not park in the hotel garage as there was ample street parking. I will say that while the pool was lovely, it became a bit frustrating to hear loud DJ music constantly playing. I was hoping to have a more relaxing time at the pool but the DJ and house music from dawn to dusk made that impossible.",4,2019,09,17
36,Bar/Sea/lona,"Overall, not a bad stay but you will need metro or Taxi to get downtown.  Beach close by is disappointing so don’t get the sea view. Also, you have to pay more for sun at the pool, unless of course the sun is not you thing.   ",4,2019,09,10
36,"Close to Beach, 15€ Cab from Downtown","I stay in nothing but Hilton properties when traveling for business, and this one has a typical business hotel feel with a touch of pleasure due to the pool and proximity to the beach. I was disappointed in the 3’ x 3’ shower for an executive level room. That thing was ridiculous for a normal sized human. The executive lounge was definitely a highlight though. The wrap-around deck with ocean and city views was awesome! Our room was also a little warm even with the air turned all the way down. Overall, I’d stay at the Hilton Curio property downtown next time, but this one is great if you want a short walk to the beach!",3,2019,09,10
36,Nice modern hotel.,"I stayed here for a conference. I didn’t get a chance to use the pool. The hotel is clean and modern. The staff were very friendly. The hotel is not in the centre of Barcelona. The CCIB conference centre is next door.
The hotel is directly across the road from Diagonal Mar shopping centre.
The only complaint I had was that the doors of the rooms were very noisy. In fact when someone left their room my room shook such was the bang of the door. They should modify these doors. I stay at modern hotels that have doors that close gently.",4,2019,09,10
36,Good option,"Overall this is a nice property. 

There is a fancy gym and pool area. There is also an executive lounge. If you are Diamond, breakfast if free in the restaurant, the lounge, or beside the pool. The lounge doesn't have much in the evenings besides a few light items but they have drinks (which cost 7€ in the mini bar so that's a nice benefit). 

The A/C was good as was the wifi.

The room was a little small but the bathroom was decent and two people could get ready at the same time.

Both the bell desk and the front desk were very helpful. We arrived early and they were able to get us into a room without a problem. 

The property is not in town = but there is a mall across the street with every American fast food option you could ever desire plus many stores and a movie theatre. Here's a tip - there's a Spanish restaurant next to Five Guys with good food. 

You can see the beach from the property - it's about a 5 to 10 min walk.

The airport is maybe 20-25 minutes drive without traffic. A pre-arranged taxi cost 20€. 

The area is very quiet and there was no road or outside noise, no through-the-wall noise and only minor sounds from the hallway.

Bottom line, I'd return.",4,2019,09,09
36,Disappointed,"The hotel is pleasant, clean, reasonably well appointed, but has some drawbacks. It's 3.5 km away from the city, but close to a beach. It describes itself as a beach hotel which it most definitely isn't. 
Though our room on the top floor was very comfortable there was a strange smell pervading the corridor, which some days was very unpleasant.
We paid extra for the executive lounge which was really disappointing. The 'breakfast' was very limited and 'happy hour' though providing enough alcohol, was terribly disappointing in the food area. During the day only fizzy drinks,tea and coffee were available.
Breakfast in the main restaurant was better, with a more extensive choice/ range of food but it was cold. The only hot food was from the egg station. I don't eat eggs so breakfast for me was cold bacon, tasteless mushrooms and lukewarm beans. 
The fruit selection consisted of tinned mango, Apple compote and peaches all of which had a strange metallic taste.
The pool area, with free access to hotel guests, was a private club, where sun beds carried a charge of €40 per day and when private functions were going on hotel guest access was very limited.
Food and drinks were very expensive, with a bottle of Estrella costing €9.
Next to the hotel is a huge shopping mall with a good choice of food and drink at much more reasonable prices.
The staff in every area were helpful and charming.",3,2019,09,08
36,Nice hotel in calm location,"Hilton is located about 10-15 min from city center in an area close to the sea.
It was a good place to stay if you wanted a calm place away from the city center to which you comute very easy, It has a surrounding with a large shopping mall with plenty of stores and resturanges. The rooms was medium comfortable and with minibar to purches items in AC was also allright. I good place to stay in a nice and clean part of Barcelona",3,2019,09,07
36,Old Hotel poor service,"Location is pretty good with a shopping mall with several restaurants across the street as well as metro, bus and tram stations.

The hotel is in desperate need of an update. The bathrooms are old. Staying in the 12th floor, drawers are broken, ordered room service and did not get any napkins or silverware... at check-in had the feeling the hotel was doing me a favor of staying here. 

Minibar looked pretty empty, like bottles were missing, so I called for someone to check it, but no one came.

This is my third time staying here and it has gotten worse.

It is pretty expensive for what you get; compared to other Hiltons, as well as other hotels in Barcelona.",2,2019,09,06
36,Best in Barcelona,"Beautiful hotel with the most friendly and most helpful staff. We enjoyed  4 nights in a lovely, comfortable Executive King with complete Mediterranean views and spacious closet and dresser. (Thx to Paula and Basile). The large Executive Lounge had wonderful evening tapas and distilled drinks. (Thx to Sergio and Maxime) We opted for the restaurant breakfast with its scrumptious buffet,  neat pancake maker, custom smoothies and champagne cocktails. 
We enjoyed walks along the Med Sea. The shopping center across the street has an array of restaurants, a grocery store and shops. While public transportation is available, we opted for  taxi to downtown. One day was walking the harbor, the Ramblas and the Gothic. Second day was to the Antonio Gaudi architecture, Picasso Museum and across from the museum Palau Damases for flamenco. Another day we took a day trip with Barcelona Day Tours to Park Guell, Montserrat, Montjuic, Olympic etc. 
We highly recommend this hotel and the wonderful Barcelona area. ",5,2019,09,05
36,Barcelona Trip,"Just stayed at this hotel with my family. The location was great , with a fantastic shopping mall across the road.

The hotel fell below expectations. The bathroom had a bad smell for our entire stay. 

We were told we had to pay 50 Euros for a poolside bed which is criminal in my opinion. The techno music was extremely loud on the weekend.  Not suitable for families with children under 12 years old. 
",3,2019,09,04
36,Immense disappointment ,"We have been Hilton Honors members since 2004. We are an average family that chose to be loyal to Hilton for their service and value. This hotel was the biggest disappointment ever. I have traveled to Spain alone and leading student groups since 2012 and I speak fluent Spanish (so definitely no language barriers). The customer service at the front desk upon check in and check out were deplorable. We were charged over $52 incidental fee (not a hold, mind you) which two months still has not been refunded when no incidentals were accrued. The complimentary bottle of water was not provided either. And while I have contacted Hilton, still no resolution. This hotel is definitely a stain on Hilton’s reputation. If you are accustomed to Hilton service, do not stay here. ",2,2019,09,02
36,Nice stay,"The check in was painless and fast. The room was clean, modern and a nice size.In house wireless worked very well all over the property.  Pool looked nice, but no time to test it out. Lobby bar was open late which was a welcomed bonus with my late check in.",4,2019,08,31
36,Great,"Really glad we picked this hotel, although it is not convenient for seeing the major sites in Barcelona. So the negatives first:  not near the historical areas or other tourist attractions, and a solid 10 minute walk to the metro. (Taxis readily available). Sometimes we had to wait quite a while for an elevator.  

Positives:  very comfortable, clean rooms. A very elaborate breakfast buffet. Less than a 10 minute walk (flat other than the ramp down to the beach itself) to a beach (which has a small section for bringing dogs - made for great pet watching). Plenty of dining options very close. Good executive lounge with great views and a nice breakfast. 

Pool is a party pool - lots of drinking, loud dance music. Not a place to relax or take a nap. Gym was functional but needed an ac. 

Front desk was very attentive but it took almost 20 minutes to complete the check in process. ",5,2019,08,30
36,Could be Excellent,"This is a very good Hilton situated in a quiet area outside Barcelona City Centre. However there are excellent transport options, tram, bus, and metro with stops within a 5 - 10 minute walk away.The best ticket is a T 10 which gives 10 trips on any transport (or 5 trips for a couple). It costs just over 10 Euros which is half the normal ticket price..
The beach is a 10 minute stroll away and there is a very good mall across the street. It has 200 shops, 40 eateries and a huge supermarket.
Our King Executive room was reasonably sized with a good sized bathroom. However clothes storage is limited with no drawers only 4 small shelves, two in the fridge unit and two in the wardrobe. It had an excellent view overlooking the pool area, the beach, and a small nearby park.
The staff throughout are excellent, friendly, helpful, and determined to make your stay as good as possible. Breakfast in the restaurant has a wide ranging choice of hot and cold food, as well as an omelette station, a children`s menu corner and one for Catalan food. 
The areas the hotel need to consider are
1. The Executive lounge is a large comfortable room with seating outside both in
     the open and in the shade.It is let down by the food - the all day snacks consist
     of potato chips, nuts, and Special K biscuits. At the evening Happy Hour there 
     are two hot options (chicken skewers, etc) and a cold wrap. There are no 
     salads, fruit, pastries, etc. although the alcohol drinks are plentiful. Also there 
     are no newspapers, etc. available. 
2. In the tourist season the AURT restaurant was closed for staff holidays. We 
    came back from a day out about 4.15 and fancied a sandwich and coffee in the 
    MA`I restaurant but were told that the kitchen was closed until 7.00 p.m. so we
     went across to the Mall where there is an excellent range of options.
3. The pool area is designed for those paying for the privilege. Hotel guests either
     pay about 20 Euros per person or are seated under a slatted roof so that you get
     striped sun/shade. The pool itself is a decent size but does not lend itself to 
     sitting around the edge of the pool and the music tends to be loud and repetitive.

If these items were reconsidered, we would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel.",4,2019,08,29
36,Should have stayed at 3-star,"My partner and I thought we would upgrade from our prearranged 3star hotel and wanted a little more whilst in Barcelona. Unfortunately we arrived in the hotel only to find that everything was an add-on cost. The breakfast was not included and costs €28 each to dine with at least 80 other people and to top it off we were not even allowed to sit by the pool - this would also cost us an exorbitant amount. Guests unwilling to pay were placed 50m away from the pool undercover. Whilst the rooms were nice, we were also frustrated my the two intrusions by cleaning staff, despite having a Do Not Disturb sign on both occasions. Although relaying this to staff upon check out, we were met with a shrug on all the above. Wish we had stayed in our original 3-star accommodation which at least provided breakfast.",3,2019,08,27
36,Shame that the pool area lets the hotel down,"I am really not sure why the hotel outsources its pool area to purabeach which attracts the worst kind of people. The music is cranked up to an obnoxious level and day beds appeal to desperate wannabes with zero class. As a hotel guest, I don't expect to be relegated to the shade to appease these awful people. By all means charge for day beds but charging us for a recliner in the sun?? Lovely hotel otherwise and nice staying outside the centre for a change",3,2019,08,26
36,Trip to Barcelona,"This Hotel is in an excellent location on the Mediterranean with wonderful views of the sea and city.  Also, there is convenient taxi service outside of the hotel and it's within walking distance of the Metro train station.  My wife and I had a Great Time. Use the Executive Lounge with your stay.  It's Well Worth It! ",1,2019,08,26
36,Hilton with low quality features,"Sea view room on the 13th floor had a very nice view of the sea and the pool area.  Unfortunately all of the loud music coming from the pool could be heard all the way up towards our room.  From 10 in the morning to well after midnight music interrupted our peaceful silence.  Breakfast dinning was adequate but finding a Resturant in the hotel for dinner was more of a challenge.  There was a great mall across the street from the hotel where we were able to satisfy our food needs at a more reasonable price.

Another poor quality of our room was the musty odor from mold and/or cigarettes even though we had a non-smoking room",2,2019,08,25
36,Loved the fresh smoothies everyday ,A wonderful arrangement of fresh smoothies every day was one of the many highlights of the trip. Beatriz was a great smoothie concoctor ! Barcelona is a wonderful city and starting the day with fresh fruit was fantastic ,5,2019,08,24
36,5 star hotel? I don’t think so...,"Smelly rooms and corridors! 
Law food quality especially at breakfast!
Noisy cleaning ladies (impossibile to sleep after 09:00!)
Extra charge for the clients at the pool! 
Trust me, if u look for quality vacation, avoid this hotel!!!",1,2019,08,23
36,Poor due to Poll access,"I carefully researched my hotel options in Barcelona and chose this for being a Hilton, location and price. I generally look on tripadvisor at good and bad comments. The key negative comments in posts were about the pool and guest access.

The point I missed, and is NOT properly explained on the hotel website, is that if you want a nice lounger next to the pool you will pay! Basically they do not want hotel guests by the pool, there is limited space for guests and you are made to feel like second class citizens and put in an area without sun and shocking service. However, they do give you the loud music that you really don’t want! The club is targeted at the mid 20s to mid 30s, hence the excessively loud music is set for that age group and a completely non-descript irritating noise! 

I expected to see this age group at breakfast taking over the restaurant or lounge, but no! You see the usual range of ages groups that you would expect on a hotel The key topic of conversation being the nightmare of pool access. 

The hotel staff are clearly fed up with the complaints they get from regular Hilton users who quite rightly don’t expect to be refused access to the hotel pool, or told to come back later or pay! 

On a positive note, the rooms are modern, spacious, the lounge is nice and has an outside terrace, the staff are all friendly and helpful too. 

Will I stay in this hotel again? Not a chance if they continue with this jumped up pool ""club!""
",1,2019,08,23
36,Took great care of us!,"We were weary of booking a global chain hotel like Hilton since we prefer to stay at smaller boutique hotels, but we were glad that we stayed here. 

Although a little outside of the main area of Barcelona, this Hilton was quite comfortable in terms of the room that we we given. We were celebrating our honeymoon and the staff was kind enough to provide us with a bottle of champagne and a box of sweets. We were pleasantly surprised with these thoughtful gestures. 

We spent some time at the pool, which reminded us of a Las Vegas pool club with the DJ. My only critique, if I had to offer one, is that the poolside staff only provided one towel per person, which is not enough to cover the entire lounge chairs which do not look like they are the cleanest chairs out there. Staff here speak English very well and were all very helpful from the front desk to the bell man and concierge who helped us make reservations at a coveted restaurant. 

Across the street from the hotel is a mall. The hotel is also a short walk to the beach, we would definitely come back to stay here when we return to Barcelona. ",5,2019,08,22
36,Wonderful hotel ,"This hotel is great , wonderful location , clean rooms and wonderful staff.  Everything about this hotel is great I really loved staying here . The location is excellent close the beach, restaurants and transport. The staff are really friendly and efficient .  The food in the restaurant is very tasty and the rooms are spacious and clean. Totally recommend you consider to stay here for what ever your reason is to be in Barcelona .",5,2019,08,22
36,Amazingly its part of the Hilton hotels chain,"When I saw the hotel on the website it looked much more elegant, on our arrival the entrance was already disappointing. 
I booked a room on the website with a different card and on my arrival the reception told me that I had to use the same card with which I payed the room on the website, but nothing was actually written, therefore I had to pay the room again. 
The room given in the end was not even the one we booked as it hadn’t a view towards the beach but on the city. Despite this, the room was very clean with a breathtaking view on the city of Barcelona.
The service was very slow, even to change a hair dryer (provided by the hotel)  which smoked and almost exploded; not mention the room service which takes forever and the very high prices just for a bottle of water with an extra 8€ just to bring it up to the room from the kitchen.
About the terrace with the pool, when we got to the 2nd floor we were amazed from the high prices for clients of the Hilton hotel, even for just two sun beds. 
We booked a room with access to executive lounge, which I have to say was nothing special as it had nothing to nibble with before 6pm except a few chips and some nuts which just sit there as nobody actually eats them. After 6pm the executive lounge gets crowded and the amount of alcohol if quite astonishing since there is almost nothing to eat with it to have a proper aperitif. Anyways the view is incredible form the 15th floor; but the best part of 
It is that they let in people in swimwear or without a t shirt eat McDonald’s or Burger King.
Lastly 48h before our departure from the hotel they told us we had to pay immediately all the extras or they would have locked the room. 
Honesty I have never been to a Hilton or even a four star hotel with such a bad service and impoliteness.
I highly not recommend this hotel for how much you pay for such a bad service.",2,2019,08,20
36,Shame about the pool,"We recently stayed in the Diagonal Mar and thoroughly enjoyed our break with Hilton. Excellent service, lovely rooms (2), helpful staff, ideal location for us (just on the edge of the city with Metro access).  The major drawback which let the hotel down however was the pool area only allowing hotel guests to relax under a shaded area unless they pay to sit under the sun. Having enjoyed the quality of the wider hotel offer, this left a very sour taste for somewhere which otherwise provided us with an enjoyable stay.  If the hotel provides its guests with opportunity to sunbathe, the experience would be so much more enjoyable.",4,2019,08,19
36,Not recommended for families and Hotel needs serious improvements,"So many things were wrong with the room, room cleanliness and staff (e.g. finging catchup and labels in babies bed upon arival to bathroom having problems, to old plasters in headboard, to transfers being ordered but not being organized) that it would take a long time to explain. Even the pool advertised as a childrens pool was fill of drunken idiots with load techno music constantly going. There was no relaxing at this hotel. Although the manager did try to help it just kept getting worse. I did not expect this from a Hilton and will think twice if ever about staying in another one of your hotels.",2,2019,08,16
36,Good location away from tourist nonsense,"My wife and I spent 2 night (Mon-Tue) at the Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona in August. 

Pros:
- Great location, away from the overwhelming tourist area. Right next to a shopping plaza with a *great* grocery store and several interesting restaurants. Seemed like a place for locals, not a tourist trap. Awesome laundromat 5 minute walk away. 
- Excellent breakfast. 
- Comfortable bed; clean, modern room 
- Gym was just ok; one treadmill
- Had a view of the ocean

Cons
- Executive lounge basically useless - only food was ""happy hour"" stuff, all grease. Water, juice, coffee.  
- We left our bags before check-in, then returned 6 hours later, they still hadn't made it to the room.",4,2019,08,16
36,Great Stay,"Hotel staff were extremely helpful with all of our questions. Our room was perfect, facing the Sea. The Breakfast spread was delicious and plentiful. The only advice I give is for the PuroBeach onsite pool. If you are a guest at the room you have the option of staying in the subbed section in the shade for free. If you are a guest and would like a sunbed on the pool deck or close the to water, there is a fee associated with it but as a hotel guest you get 50% off and you can stay there all day. The music played at the pool is terrible techno/EDM. When the actual DJs showed up at the booth we thought it would get better but they just played the same terrible stuff. ",4,2019,08,14
36,Convenient to beach and mall.  Loud pool club area.,"Clean. Comfortable. Convenient to beach, mall, Starbucks, Five Guys, pharmacy.  Hotel staff is very friendly and accommodating.  Great breakfast buffet.  You can't really see the beach very well from the hotel, so no need to pay a higher price for a beach view.  I was sick during some of the stay and tried to relax in the room.  If relaxing is your thing, choose a room that doesn't overlook the pool or face the beach.  The pool area plays loud club music all afternoon and evening that can be heard up in your room.  Not much relaxing and reading around the pool (more loud club music).  So if you like to quietly sit around the pool and relax, choose another location.  But if that's your thing, you'll love it.  To relax, request a room facing the mall.  Good room service options.",4,2019,08,12
36,Excellent Hotel in Barcelona,"Excellent hotel with a great location. Everything was so clean and would pass a ""white glove"" test!  The bed was very comfortable and the room layout was well-designed.  The views are tremendous. I would definitley stay here again.",5,2019,08,11
36,Wonderful vacation stay in Barcelona,Had a great experience. Hotel was convenient and staff was excellent. Nice executive lounge made for a relaxing time after hectic toruing of the city. Staff went out of their way to help and make the trip very enjoyable.,5,2019,08,10
36,Family trip,"Very clean, well equipped hotel. Extremely helpful staff. Special thanks to check in lady and enrica the message sender. René and Joaquin the bellman, Omar concierge and Basile front desk! I dont remember everybodys name. Bar staff was also perfect. I was lucky. Thank you guys!",5,2019,08,10
36,Fab holiday,"My boyfriend and i were super impressed by the Hotel and had a great stay. The staff were very attentive. We were welcomed by Basil who was really friendly and approachable. We got given a fabulous room which looked on to the city and a lovely view of the cathedral on top of the mountain. 
The breakfast was great too with lots of variety. We loved the location of the hotel with it being close to the beach, the mall and a nice walk into the centre of Barcelona. We will definitely be returning again and highly recommend to other people.",5,2019,08,10
36,Short city stopover ,"We stayed only one night,  but would have happily stayed longer. Fantastic family room on 11th floor with great views of the city. Breakfast buffet had great choice and as kids eat free was actually good value for the four of us.  It was busy, but staff were well organised.  We enjoyed the use of the pool, and as others have said the Hilton guest loungers are not poolside. This is annoying and perhaps if I had been for a sun and swimming holiday it would have grated  - but I was on a short city break and my kids are competent swimmers so I can be confident not watching them 24/7 and we only used the pool for a couple of hours - so this did not really bother me. The area for guests is actually pretty relaxing with loungers and some egg chairs.  We used the underground parking,  which at 36 e a  night was expensive.  However,  on check in the receptionist told me there was free parking nearby at the beach. We chose to use the hotel carpark because we're on a driving holiday and wanted a secure carpark. Point being - there are other parking options nearby if you choose.  Location was good - 8 stops to central Barcelona on the metro - and staying outside a little you get the pool, bigger rooms etc. Finally the staff were excellent.  Everyone we spoke to could not have been more helpful and friendly.  We will certainly consider returning to this hotel. ",4,2019,08,08
36,Lovely hotel!,"The staff at the hotel were exceptional in their service. Especially the front desk staff, which was kind and understanding. 
Exceptional service!
A big thank you to Praxedes for making sure we have a fantastic stay. 
I will definitely wanna come back.",5,2019,08,08
36,Lovely,"This Hilton is beautiful.  We were lucky enough to stay on the top floor in an executive suite.  Along with the suite is breakfast and unlimited coffee and tea.  Snacks and a beautiful view.  We were treated wonderfully and the bar was great.  Drinks were good and a fun time.  Pool is available for you, although closed for storms.  Rooms were spacious and very clean and well stocked with shampoo etc.  I would do it again without hesitation and recommend it without hesitation.",5,2019,08,07
36,Great,"Loved the service
Rooms have been nicely renovated
Great at puro beach
Staff in the lounge was great and the terrasse was amazing
Good new restaurant downstairs
Breakfast is nice although a bit crowded at times ",5,2019,08,07
36,Perfect location,As it probably should this Hilton hotel has everything you would expect from a Hilton hotel including a Michelin star restaurant. Perfect location near the beach. Staff correct. Nice bar and professional people working there.,4,2019,08,07
36,Visit,"Hilton Diagonal Mar is situated east of Baecelona City centre
The Hotel is 3 minutes fron an excellent beach ,very clean ,the Hotel is one of the best location in Barcelona built near the old Olympic site ,rooms are all with a view very clean with an executive Lounge located on 15th floor with an outside balcony 1/3 around the building,
1000 shopping Centre opposite the Hotel
The Hotel has a wonderful park next door with good walking areas to the Marina 
Well worth a visit
Book early as the Hotel is very busy

36,"Great hotel, great location",Rooms were basic rooms but good size for individual or room share. Hotel staff were very friendly and willing to assist with travel and touring recommendations. Attending a conference and the meeting rooms were very great. Appreciated walk to convention center area was not too long.,5,2019,08,07
36,Fabioulse hotel but so So so Materialistic that they charge you 40 Euro for the Suntaning chair around the pool of the h,"A very Materialistic hotel with very bad service comparing with 3 star hotel maybe in Mauritania, we arrived at 2:30 pm after 9 hours of traveling, the room was not ready and they told us they will send a message or email us when ready, they supported us with pool access unfortunately the pool surrounding was full and only the Sun tanning chairs around the pool was free but they said we must pay 40 Euro to sit around the pool as per hotel law, later on we went to the mall and kept touring waiting for the hotel message that never came, when we went back at 4:30, the room was not ready still (We woke up at 3:00 am to reach your hotel), later they said OK ready, they support us with room 215 that have a view on the corner of the tanning area & the kitchen while we paid for pool view, when I went back asking for my right that I paid for, I was very upset and angry because they said  this is a pool view, so I asked for the manager, the lady manger lady said room 215 is a pool view sir and if you don't want it u can check out, she was so rude & kept saying this is a pool view until I told her please come up and show me 1 cm from the pool, so she moved me to another floor after 30 minutes discussions and supported me with free WIFI because I am Hilton Honor that was canceled next day (Wifi), after checking-in I called for some amenities, the reception replied after several calls with no luck for 15 minutes, later on I called many times to remind them which forced me after 90 minutes of waiting to Igo down to bring them myself, their was complimentary tea in the room but no water, it should be paid, a 4 star hotel support 2 bottles with such complimentary items, Honestly speaking I spend 300 night business trips every year and never saw such rude manager and such bad service, if you allow me, one more advise we choose this hotel close to the sea to enjoy the beach after work expecting that the hotel will provide beach towels, unfortunately such service is not available, maybe I am wrong but normally all hotel next to beaches support such service with special return conditions if lost",1,2019,08,06
36,Visited Barcelona before our cruise,We stayed two nights in Barcelona at this hotel and loved it. They welcomed outside the doors and grabbed our bags and escorted us to the front desk. The rooms where spotless and updated very nice. We would definitely stay at this hotel again.,5,2019,08,06
36,Interesting experience,"My husband and I stayed at this Hilton for two nights after our cruise docked. When we arrived it was early in the morning before 10am, which we knew our room probably wouldn't be ready until early afternoon. We were told our room wouldn't be ready until 3pm. During this time I asked to add my HH member number and was declined due to the fact that we booked with a third party, no worries really just annoying, We checked back at 3:15pm and were told our room wouldn't be ready until after 4pm. They asked for a number to text us to let us know the room was ready, We decided to take a walk a see what was around us. The only thing around was a mall with half of the stores closed, the beach, and a few parks. It was a 15 plus minute taxi drive anywhere else. When we arrived back 5pm the room was ready and we went up. Upon spending a few minutes in the room it sounded like the building was going to collapse. We were in room 1101; We learned that we were stationed next to the maintenance room and anytime an employee went in or out of that our room sounded like the building was going to cave in around us. It was very alarming! We left the next morning to tour the city we arrived back around 4pm and our room wasn't cleaned, not really a big deal to be honest. We had a knock on the door between 5:30-6pm to clean the room, We declined the offer and asked for towels. We ordered breakfast that morning as well and it was good nothing to rave about. Some staff were pleasant but others weren't so much and seemed to be annoyed with us asking when our room would be ready. The pool area is wonderful but very crowded. The best part of this hotel was being close to American fast food such as McDonald's and Five Guys, which is located across the street in a mall,",3,2019,08,06
36,"Fantastic stay, fantastic experience at this hotel","So, this was my first time spending a little extra on the hotel for our holiday. We usually go for 3* hotels, nothing fancy, our usual places to stay are 'functional' and tick boxes (clean, close to beach, breakfast included etc). A combination of our holiday being during the first week of UK school holidays and leaving booking the holiday until late, meant that when looking for hotels in Barcelona even the 3* hotels were coming out very pricey.

This hotel was maybe a couple of hundred pounds more than the type of hotels we usually stay in, and this year we thought 'Why not - lets push the boat out a little'. It was also one of the few hotels which were available at time of booking which were near the beach, included breakfast, had a pool area, near to public transport and in a quiet location. In the end it came down to this hotel of another lovely looking hotel which was more near the centre of Barcelona, this one was a little more expensive but ultimately the Sea View room and the fact it was a little away from the hustle and bustle of Barcelona, and nearer a quieter section of beach convinced me to book this one.

I do not regret the decision at all! From the moment we were greeted at the front desk, to the hotel calling a taxi and loading my luggage into the car when we left, I cannot fault the staff, or any interaction I had with them during my stay. Lovely staff, always there with a smile and a hello, whether that be on reception, in the lift, in any of the public spaces - the staff were outstanding. 

As for the hotel itself - lovely hotel - as others have said - its a little away from the main tourist areas of the city (but I liked that), but these are all easily accessible via the hop-on hop-off bus, or the metro (about a 10 minute walk away if you cut through the shopping centre). Despite their being a huge shopping centre across the road I found the are to be very peaceful and quiet in the evenings / night time.

We had an Executive Sea View room on the 19th floor - the views as you come out of the lift are breathtaking, as are the views from the room. We could see the sea, Agbar Tower, Sagrada, MNAC etc all from the hotel room. I can honestly say they were the best views from any room I've stayed in. We also had access to the Executive Lounge - which had a lovely outside terrace and had nibbles and drinks available (free of charge) and a breakfast in the morning (my little girl preferred the variety of the breakfast downstairs so we didn't actually eat breakfast in the Executive Lounge).

The breakfast downstairs was fantastic, even as vegetarians we had plenty of choice. We had free WIFI in the room (not sure if that was because we had an 'executive' room or because I am a member of Hilton Honors through work) - the WIFI was great even the WIFI in public spaces was spot on in the hotel. The hotel is a 5 minute walk from a gorgeous beach, it wasn't as crowded as the beaches nearer to the main tourist areas, again exactly what we wanted. We spent a little time at Puro Beach - which if sunbathing is your thing I imagine would be fantastic. The way it works, is there is an area which is free for guests which is set a little back from the actual pool itself. Then there were a couple of paid for options if you wanted to be right next to the pool, the more expensive option basically looked like a big mattress right next to the pool. Again - if sunbathing is your thing then I imagine this would be great. There was also a gym and sauna etc, which we didn't use, but the facilities are there.

The shopping centre across the road was great, the top floor which has all of the food outlets stays open late, and there is a little play area for kids as well. The choice of food was great, I think I read there are 40 + places to eat there. There is also a supermarket which is very handy for water, snacks etc.

All in all a fantastic hotel in a great location and I would 100% return again, thank you to Alina and the team at Hilton Diagonal Mar for such a fantastic experience.",5,2019,08,06
36,Great hotel in an amazing location,"It was my 4th stay at the hotel and as Diamond member I got an upgrade to a seaview room. The room was beautiful designed in a maritime way and had indeed a great sea view. However on the carpet were alot stains of red wine and the new furniture had already alot scratches. The executive lounge has a stunning terrace with pool and seaview and the drinks selection was great. However the food selection was dramatically reduced compared to prior years. The staff was friendly and professional, on checkin I was offered a cold lemonade, small things make the difference.",5,2019,08,05
36,Excellent stay!,"Clean, nice location, very good service of top class! We stayed 4 nights and uset most of the hotels services. Very nice pool area, gym was a bit sall but good in general. Breakfast was outstanding with excellent service.",5,2019,08,05
36,Nice hotel shame about the pool!!,"Cannot fault the hotel as a whole but I am disgusted that as a hotel guest I cannot sit by the pool and watch my children having fun! Not only am I paying a lot of money for this nice hotel stay and I am now expected to pay and extortionate amount of money for the privilege of making sure my children are safe! There is no lifeguard on duty so I have to watch them but I have to sit on the floor not on a subbed unless I pay €40 each that’s just for the day! So everyday I would have to pay €240 as there is 6 of us!!!! Disgraceful Hilton, you should have an area next to the pool for your guests not push us to the back like we are not worthy.  ",3,2019,08,05
36,same charme as an airport hotel,it is all efficient and organised. fast track check in and check out. decent rooms with big windows. decent swimming pool. personnel of breakfast room very nice. bar on the ground floor similar to a business class lounge of an airline company. people queueing at concierge in flip flops and Hawaiian shirts. all good if you go for business to the nearby congress forum palace. i wonder why tourists would stay here to visit Barcelona centre which is far away.,3,2019,08,04
36,Avoid!!! One of the worst experience I had!,"When you heard Hilton, you though ""service, luxury & pleasant experience"", FORGET ABOUT IT!  Hilton literally ruins our holiday, despite putting the price, I had to battle to get what I paid for.  Try to send them an email, you will get no answer!  The check-in time is at 4 pm which is non-sense but of course, if you pay an extra, you can get a room right now. Even the concierge tried to scam us, everybody without exception tries to charge us for the most basic thing, even for things you've already paid. This hotel is to categorize into the scam category. It is the first and my last time in a Hilton hotel.  Ps: I've booked a room with sea view (you pay an extra for it which is fine), guess what? I got a room with a city view, after claiming, I've got my room and well I let you admire the view.",1,2019,08,04
36,Nice Hilton,"The last timeI was in Barcelona 18 years ago, I stayed at the Hilton.  Since then the Diagonal Hotel was built.  Rooms are spacious and the lounge for Diamond and Gold members is nice with many beverages and snacks.  The swimming pool was a bit disappointing and looked much smaller in person than in the photos.  The breakfast Buffett is one of the best of all the Hilton’s Properties I have stayed.  Only to be topped by the Tel Aviv Hilton.  The restraint in the lobby has good burgers.  This is a good location for those taking a cruise and has many stores across the street at the mall.  A cab ride to the cruise port around 15-20 Euros.  There is a self serve laundromat behind the mall where you can wash normal loads into one Hughe washer for around 7 Euros.
",4,2019,08,03
36,Excellent Hotel and Location,"We had a great stay at the Hilton. It is located in the city close to a bus stop for the double decker buses. The rooms and nice and cozy. The lobby is a great place for a drink and a bite to eat. The staff went above and beyond the call of duty as they helped up search for my husband’s missing passport. Next time I go to Barcelona, I will stay at the Hilton!",5,2019,08,03
36,Hilton Diagonal Mar,"Excellent hotel, staff very pleasant and helpful all the time in all areas.
The pool is a major drawback and very dissappointing. Chose this hotel because of pool area appearance. However it is not run by hotel and is far to expensive especially hire of sunbeds and food and drink.",4,2019,08,03
36,Not that great for the money!,Hubby and I stayed in this hotel at the end of our european holiday as a special treat!  Noticed that we were one of the few nz/aussi couples there and probably the reason for that could be the price!  $400eur a night equates to big money NZ so our expectations were quite high to start with!  Our seaview executive suite consisted of two small views of the sea either side of the tower right in front of us! The room itself was quite large however the bed seemed very hard and not the usual quality you would expect for a hotel of this standard.  The breakfast restaurant was probably the best part of this experience - the food was amazing and plentiful with a huge amount of choice and great service.  The pool area however was a joke!  Not sure if this was part of the hilton or not as it was basically a very small pool with a huge amount of seating which dependent where you sat - you paid for!! If you were fortunate enough to get offered a drink (also a crazy price) then you were extremely lucky!  Sorry but would not stay here again merely due to the price which really didnt give good value for money - lots of other amazing hotels to stay in Barcelona which although not next to the sea - offer much better value,2,2019,08,02
36,This place is a mess,This place is a mess. I am a diamond member and never seen service like this at any other Hilton. Front desk is rude and they had at trainees working at the front who they blamed for everything that went wrong with the check-in process. Not sure why they would make a trainee handle diamond member in the first place. The hotel rooms and BRs were okay. However pool situation is bad if you are traveling with kids. Pool seats cost money and were filled. There aren't many poolside seats. Also doesn't seem that pool is owned by Hilton. The exec floor had very few snack selection and the fridge there was barely making the drinks cold. All in all we ended up moving out and glad we did,1,2019,08,02
36,Holiday,"The description of this hotel and its amenities fails to tell you that on Fridays, Saturdays and Sunday there is loud disco music by the pool. Anyone with a poolside view is drowned out by music. I complained and they refused to lower the music. We had to move rooms to the other side of the hotel. Also the beach is not as close as it states in the blurb. Apart from that not a bad stay but we won't be returning.",3,2019,08,01
36,Never expected to face such a terrible experience,"I was on a business trip and was staying in the Hilton Diagonal Mar. I chose this hotel for couple of reasons. Mainly because its at walking distance from my workplace and brand. Earlier visit to hilton gave a feeling of good hospitality.
But this trip shattered all these.

The day before I was going to fly back home, at the breakfast area, my backpack which had all my important belongings (laptop, chargers, wallet, apartment keys and mobile phone) was stolen. 
I was under the impression that every person who comes for breakfast is residing in the hotel. And with hotel staff going around you drop your guards and try to relax and enjoy ur breakfast. 
But alas, that's not gonna happen. Within the time span of me getting some breakfast, the theif finished his task and replaced with another empty bag. 
I noticed this at the very moment I returned to my table. 
And the surprising thing was when I informed the hotel staff, they didn't react at all and where giving all reasons of why they can't catch the theif.
I lost everything and don't have any hopes. 
But I would pray that nobody experiences these situation.
Please be very careful with your belongings when in Barcelona doesn't matter if you are in a so-called posh hilton hotel.",1,2019,08,01
36,Amazing Views,"The hotel room was amazing, with ocean view in two directions.The staff was topnotch, parking assistance, front desk and the executive reception was fantastic and the view was great. 
The location worked well for us but it seemed further away from the center, a big shopping mall across from the hotel with lot of options to eat.",5,2019,08,01
36,Watch your credit card bill when you return,"While at the hotel we had a wonderful time. Front desk was welcoming and helpful. Great location (next to large shopping mall and beach). Rooms were clean.

 It was when our credit card bill arrived that our stay took a downhill spiral. We booked our stay almost entirely with points (one room was points plus cash).  Upon check out we were presented with a total that seemingly reflected the correct amount ($200). One month later there were over $800 in charges made to our credit card. No additional folios/bills were provided detailing why such charges were made.

Rather than opening a dispute with American Express, we thought we would give Hilton an opportunity to explain/fix any incorrect charges.  After multiple phone calls and emails with Hilton's US customer service unit, Hilton Diagonal Mar agreed that they overcharged us for 360 Euro.  No additional folios/bills were sent to us. Nor was any explanation of why such additional charges were made to our credit card.  Again our final bill should have been around 210 Euros.

After more emails with Hilton's US customer service unit, they gave up and directed us to call the hotel directly with our questions.

After speaking with several employees at Diagonal Mar (incurring over $90 in international phone call charges), the hotel acknowledged that they charged us in full for every hotel room -- we had three (even though we booked with points). 

In the end, after hours of our time (and $90 in phone call), we are still waiting for the additional refunds to our credit card.",2,2019,08,01
36,A nice hotel in BCN,"Well located at the end of the Diagonal, close to a large shopping center and situated about 200 meters from the sea side, you will find in this hotel all the services you need for a business trip: friendly and quick reception and room service, fast wifi, 24h gym club...",5,2019,07,30
36,Vacation,"Great hospitality rooms very clean and more fascinating!
Mostly pro beach pools so nice to relax 
Each and every one so nice and help full!
Mainly Reseption hospitality 
So kindly and so quickly resolving all inconvenience to the guest  
I suppose to stay 2 night but I excited up to 6 nights 
I will come again 
I recommend each and every one do not miss this Hilton hospitality i",5,2019,07,29
36,Outstanding hotel,"The hotel is located just off the beach and right next to the hop and off bus stop.  The subway is 5 minutes away

Across the road is a lively shopping mall with a good selection of restaurants. Within the area there are also a great selection 

The staff are outstanding in all departments especially in the hard working business lounge

The pool area is like an Ibiza club with thumping music not everyone’s taste but I believe the pool is run by a separate beach club

This is a great Hilton and I would recommend",5,2019,07,29
36,"Service and comfort! Was great, a few issues but I think every holiday has some?","The Hilton is a confutable stay and as we’re just sleeping and showering their ,was mainly ok,

Only complaints I have was one the smell from the bathroom sewage pipe was terrible?
They did try and clean and send maintenance but because we had joining rooms with our family
They could not switch room for nicer smelling one!
So they sent up free fruit for my husband who was unwell.

The swimming pool is amazing,
and as you spent thousands on your Holliday here you think you were entitled to sit by the pool! ,
No your ushers off to a white green house at the back, with no view of pool or anything just white walls and no air/breeze..
If you do want to sit on loungers by the pool it’s 
€35 Euros each for the day! Bit of a rip off...

The maids and house keepers are brilliant!
There polite and helpful and thoughtful.

The AURT and MAI Staff 
They look through you and walk past you and tell you, my colleague will help you and there busy with others, we waited half a hour before my husband got up and asked for help! then You have to work out what staff work for what restaurant ? 
As the other staff can not help you!
Food is defiantly over priced, 
but it is all over Barcelona.
Expect to pay €100-€150 for family of four to eat!

The reception staff are great and are very friendly
Very HELPFULL.

If you venture out though, for food.
restaurants by the beaches is reasonable and to break up the cost of food the diagonal shopping Center has many food chains McDonald’s ,Burger King,subway,but there not like uk standard so not alway hot when food gets to you!

Bus trips and tours can work out expensive 
So try book on line first for cheaper costs.

Over all we enjoyed Barcelona, 
The hotel was great for what we needed for family of four.",3,2019,07,27
36,Disappointing,"Overall a disappointing experience staying at the Hilton Diagonal Mar.

Main disappointment is the hotel pool is actually owned/managed by a Beach Club, which means that if you want sunbeds in the main area of the pool, and in the sunshine, you have to pay. We were told it would cost 30 euro at least, but up to 100 euro on weekends/busiest days. For hotel guests who didn't want to pay for a sunbed, there is a section of free sunbeds but these are all under a roof, which means they are in the shade, always.This was extremely disappointing when we chose the hotel partly for the pool and the ability to sunbathe and relax. The hotel don't mention this when you check in, they promote the facility of the pool. In addition to having to pay for sunbeds in the sun and close to the pool, the music is blaring loud with heavy bass clubbing tunes, which isn't appropriate if you have children or if you want to relax. 

Given we couldn't sunbathe and relax by the pool, we made our way to the beach which was extremely over crowed, and not relaxing when people are trying to sell you things constantly. We also wanted to get towels to take to the beach but you can't take the towels from the Beach Club, so we were advised to ask at reception and they would give us towels. But when asking at reception they said to take towels from the Beach Club. So we took them from our rooms as there was no support from the hotel on this. 

The service overall wasn't great, both at check in and reception, but also in the lounge. Sort of helpful, but very slow.

The use of the Exec Lounge was good, but it was limited. There is a small roof terrace where you can sit outside but it was often overcrowded, especially between 6-8pm when the food and alcohol comes out. During the day there are free soft drinks available and snacks such as crisps and nuts.

The room itself was great. Spacious and clean. Our sea view wasn't great due to the big concrete buildings between the hotel and the sea, even on one of the highest floors. 

The hotel is also a fair way out of the city centre but manageable getting the metro around. 

Overall an average experience.",3,2019,07,25
36,Mold in the shower,"When I arrived in my room, my mom noticed mold in the shower. She called the front desk and asked if someone could either come clean the shower or if they could reassign us to another room. We were told that they would send someone to clean the bathroom, but no one ever showed up. Needless to say we were unable to use the shower during our overnight stay.",1,2019,07,23
36,Bad attitude at checkin,"Just checked in, very poor service. Receptionist is at the phone while supporting me. Also, he did not recognize my Diamond status. However, when handover my room-key, he mentioned I was upgraded SIX(!!!) levels. Sorry, this never happens and is even not possible. I told him, and the guy went ballistic and telling me that I was wrong. I spoke to the duty manager, he promised to fix, but I doubt.
On a more positive note the bar staff is very dedicated and customer focused.
Not sure coming back to this Hilton. For the record, I’m 11 years Diamond Member.
",1,2019,07,22
36,Barcelona stay,Hilton Diagonal Mar was the best hotel we have stayed at for some time the staff were just so good and helpful the room was well appointed and the buffet breakfast was the best we have ever had overall we loved it,5,2019,07,22
36,Beautiful Ocean views,"This is a wonderfully comfortable hotel in Barcelona! It's almost right on the beach and has gorgeous ocean views from most rooms and also from the Executive Lounge. Staff was amazing! It's close to most things in town, but you probably will ave to take a cab to attractions. Also would need a shuttle or cab from/to airport. It's the closest Hilton to the port for cruise ships. It's also geared more toward business travelers, however, it fit our needs perfectly. If I go back, would absolutely stay here again!",5,2019,07,21
36,"Nice hotel, but poor value for family. Reservations dept horrible.","Nice hotel, but reservations put family of 5 in a room for 2! Doubled already expensive price.  After driving hours to get there, we arrived to friendly service. But then found out that after hours on the phone with reservations months before our stay.  After spending over double on an already expensive room, room and service was mediocre.  Digital key failed several times and I was told that I should probably just use a key card.  Would not recommend for family!  Good location but not good value.",2,2019,07,20
36,"Overpriced, underwhelmed","Located in a strange beachside location in the Barca business districts, it's a rather soulless neighbourhood with quite a bit of travel to central Barcelona. Long and slow check-in and check-out queues and staff that seemed to struggle to understand their own booking software. A 10 to 20-minute wait wasn't unusual.  In 4 days we didn't have a single elevator trip where someone wasn't having trouble, in many instances, they missed their floor before they could get the card to swipe. The rooms, particularly the bathrooms look tired, the beds are firm. Few English language TV options, not a problem in itself as I wasn't there to watch TVs, but we had all these features in hotels that were half the price. Overall, not terrible, but you can do much better for less money elsewhere in Barcelona.",3,2019,07,20
36,"Terrible service, noisy.","Requested quiet room at check-in, got one next to elevator with noise all-night. Changed rooms next day (that worked out well). Upon check out the printer wasn't working. Despite having my work and private e-mails on file still no invoice was sent. Overall, not a great experience. Cleanliness is average, breakfast is OK. View of the Med Sea is really nice, but that's not really the hotel's achievement.",2,2019,07,19
36,"Have to pay extra for pool, slow service","Arrived at this hotel to find out the pool is actually managed by a different company, and if you want to sit in the sun by the pool, you're going to pay 30 euros plus for this. The only free options for paying guests (and Hilton diamond members) are sun loungers far from the pool, purposely built under a shelter that does not see any sun. I think this is really appalling for the price you pay for the hotel and included amenities (pool being one of the selling points) that they don't write anywhere that it's extra if you want to sunbathe. The room is nice and the breakfast is good with a lot of options, but the staff here are slow. The area around is quiet and strange, and not a lot going on apart from a shopping centre. Beach is nothing special and the hotel doesn't have beach towels so we can't go anyway. It's too far from the city centre as well. Wouldn't recommend this hotel, I am sure there are much nicer places to stay for the same price.",2,2019,07,18
36,Dirty Hotel,"This hotel is dirty, especially the common areas and the floors, walls and ceiling in my room. The issues were addressed, acknowledged and then ignored. It seems like its primary purpose is to generate revenue with the lowest amount of effort. ",2,2019,07,16
36,Too many issues during 100 years of hospitality celebration,Broken safe - took too long and too many men to fix - shower overflowed- never got fixed as promised- room not ready as text stated - they moved us to a room near maids closet- sounded like someone was breaking into our room late and at early hours of morning - getting into their closet or equipment room- pool closed early and altogether for private functions- ,1,2019,07,16
36,Great Hotel ... if I weren’t with my kids ,"We checked into the Hilton Diagonal Mar at the beginning of our 3rd week of a European vacation and are traveling with 8 and 13 year old kids. We booked this space for proximity to the beach, great outdoor pool and because the property is newer. 

Our arrival and check in were great- with a warm welcome and Hilton Honors amenity. We booked a family room and were given a room on the 11th floor with a slight sea view. 

The room was fine- it was clean, and had decent space. The only complaint we all had was the bathroom. It was large on European standards but it was more form than function. 

Location wise the hotel is an easy walk to a good local beach, there are multiple cabs right in front and there is a shopping center just across the street (with tons of fast food and a Starbucks). 

The breakfast buffet was really loud and crowded and we learned that this is a popular hotel for cruise ship pre arrival and departure guests. Once the ships left the buffet was almost empty on subsequent days.

The biggest let down for us was the pool. I had read about an area for hotel guests and that you could pay to sit by the pool but was not actually prepared to walk into a Vegas style pool vibe with a 70 Euro per person  price tag for a lounge chair- or be seated in an area that is in no way visible to or from the pool. ",3,2019,07,15
36,"Nice hotel, but with faults","I️ will start of by saying the property is actually very pretty. The rooms are spacious and modern. Gabriele at reception was friendly and welcoming. However, I️ checked in the day before arrival on the app, and although I️ know we would have to wait until check-in time (hours after we initially checked in after our cruise left us there at 8:45 am our room still was not ready at 5:00!!!! That’s ridiculous. We ended up with another room and they would not offer any upgrade. We spent that time at Purobeach. As a paying guest of the hotel, there’s no reason non-guest should be given preferential seating by the pool. Guest seats are under some huge cubicle with no sun and no visibility to the pool and chairs near the pool are 30-35 Europa for guests, 75 for non guests. The front rows were all booked already. Cabanas are upward/ 800-2500 euros! A guest should never get less service than a non-guest. Either there needs to be two pools or one dedicated side for paid chairs and one for guests to receive free chairs should they prefer some sun. The breakfast is great and the executive floor has great sampling’s of snacks throughout the day. Food by the pool is incredibly expensive, but the mall across the street has lots of outdoor restaurants with outdoor seating. ",3,2019,07,15
36,Love this hotel,"Third stay here and it was as good as ever. Really well run hotel, staff helpful and friendly, very modern inside, breakfast on the 1st floor is excellent. 

Exec lounge has a good variety of drinks every day and they keep re-stocking the food during happy hour. Great views from the terrace over Barca. 

We did purobeach for 3 days - love the setting but the service on two of the days was pretty poor; slow and miserable servers - although not everyone.

Will be back again next year",5,2019,07,15
36,Poor Experience,At check in I was told the hotel does not have accommodations for a family of 4. My teen children (16 and 13) had to get a 2nd room at my cost 12 floors above me. Safe - NO. Convenient - NO. Value - NO. ,1,2019,07,13
36,Great location for a bit of ‘me time’,"Not our first visit to Barcelona but definitely our best. 
From entering the hotel and checking in we were made welcome by Mariana through to the fantastic executive lounge and its staff to the truly wonderful breakfast and some of the best hotel team I have ever met around the world.
The location is perfect for views of the city, the beach and a touch of peace from the busy City. Taxi for 4 to Las Rambla is €10-12
Parking at €36 pd seemed excessive but again it is a big city and you pay a premium for convenience. 
Really excellent stay, would 100% recommend and we will be back at this hotel soon!

36,Excellent Stay,"Really enjoyed our 3 night stay at Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona.
Hotel was clean and room was spacious.
Breakfast was very good with lots of choice and good quality foods.
Executive lounge had views of the sea and the staff were really friendly and helpful.
Extended an early check in and a late checkout

36,Post cruise stay.,What a lovely way to relax in comfort and a beautiful pool after a world wind itinerary packed cruise of the Mediterranean.  We enjoyed the breakfast included daily and found there was a lot of delicious variety.  We enjoyed the use of the pool even though it was further back from the DJ and fun than the paying guests at the pool.  We loved the shopping mall across the street and how quick a taxi drive it was to get anywhere into the center of town.  Perfect spot!  We had an issue with our air conditioner that was fixed quickly.  Lovely place and would highly recommend!,5,2019,07,10
36,Nice Place!,Nice executive lounge and pool area but the room is pretty basic and the hair dryer is low power (bring your own). It does have USB power outlets near the beds which is nice for international travelers.,4,2019,07,10
36,Great Stay Pre-Cruise ,"This hotel is beautiful, clean and convenient!   I loved the fact that we had a mall across the street with great shops and restaurants.  That was a welcomed surprise.  Taxis are always outside waiting to take you anywhere and the Barcelona City Tour bus I booked was right around the corner!   

The hotel itself is so clean and the room is gorgeous.   My only complaint about the room is that the bed is very hard and there was a bizarre odor in the hallway right outside.  

The staff is SUPER friendly and helpful.   Alina at the front desk was awesome and gave us fantastic dinner recommendations!   

The pool area was very nice and lively.  I thought the beach had a private area with sun beds or chairs from the hotel but it did not.   So we didn’t spend time there.   Bring your own towels to the beach!  

Thank you Hilton.  ",5,2019,07,08
36,Theft is a real issue here,"I had stayed at this hotel for a congress and during the checkout process had forgotten my swiss watch and bracelets in the room. I called not 10 minutes after I had checked out from the cab to the airport to ask them for the items and pass them on to my colleagues still at the hotel. It took them over an hour to get back to me and then they claimed nothing was found when the items were right there on the counter in the room. So if you have to stay at this place, make sure not to leave anything behind because it WILL disappear. I will probably try to avoid having to stay at this hotel again despite the fact that I am an HHonors member.",1,2019,07,06
36,Great hotel for cruise,"We stayed here the night prior to leaving for a cruise. Great location with many food choices within walking distance, and a short taxi ride to the cruise terminal. The room was modern, our room had a pull out sofa bed that was fairly comfortable. Staff was friendly. ",5,2019,07,05
36,Barcelona Cruise Trip,"Stayed at this Hilton enroute to a seven day cruise leaving from Barcelona with family members. This was an excellent location, not far from the Airport and not far from the Cruise port. This hotel is located very close to the beach and had excellent views of the Mediterranean. Hotel had lots of great amenities nice pool, chic restaurants etc. Staff was very helpful and attentive overall. There was even a Royal Caribbean staff on duty in the lobby to assist with our cruise departure. As a Hilton Honors Diamond member I took advantage of the free breakfast and we also had dinner in one of the restaurants.",4,2019,07,05
36,"Great location, clean and helpful staffs",Love the location as the hotel is close to the beach and opposite a big shopping centers with many good restaurants. My room was clean really well by the cleaner. Staffs were very friendly and helpful. I enjoyed my stay and would strongly recommend it to others.,5,2019,07,04
36,Fun in Europe.,"My husband and I spent a night in this beautiful hotel.The staff was very helpful and the room was very comfortable. I only wished we had longer to stay here.We had a short time to visit Barcelona before boarding the Oasis of the Seas for a 7 day cruise through  Spain,France,and Italy. I would love a return visit.",5,2019,07,03
36,Wonderful stay,"My husband and I recently stayed here prior to boarding our cruise ship.
The hotel is beautiful and staff were extremely helpful and friendly.  It is well situated across from a live!y mall .. which has every kind of store, including some very high end luxury stores!  Outside the mall is a fantastic square with a variety of restaurants to sample local cuisine and wine.
The hotel is also right on the route for the city sightseeing bus...which is well worth taking.  It wasn't expensive and it's a hip on/hop off bus so you can choose what you want to see in advance.  The concierge has the maps for the routes and was very helpful.
We would highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay there if we are lucky enough to visit Barcelona again in the future.
Thanks for a wonderful beginning to our vacation and for making Barcelona one of our favorite cities in our journey.",5,2019,07,03
36,Nice but expensive,"The hotel was nice, the rooms also, you have to put down a 100 euro deposit. I am still waiting for mine to be returned over a week after checking out. 9 euros for a bottle of beer and 14 euros for a cheese and ham toastie, so I wouldn't recommend eating or drinking there if you are on a budget. Also I've been trying to contact the hotel for a week via email and phone, but unless your trying to book a room they are not interested",3,2019,07,02
36,Great hotel,There was nothing I didn’t like about this hotel. It is a bit away from the touristy part of town but there is a metro station nearby. It cost 2.2€ each way and was very easy to use. The hotel rooms are large and well appointed.  Lots of power outlets. The beds were very comfortable.  The staff is helpful. I’d stay here again. ,5,2019,07,02
36,Disappointing,"We came for 4 days to hotel with farther 
The beach club is a rip off for guests. €30-45 at weekend to use sun loungers. Music to loud and full of young people getting drunk 

I wouldn’t come back for this reason 
Complained a couple of times no response to resolve the issue from staff or manager
I am a Hilton card holder not the usual Hilton standard 
Disappointing visit to this hotel could do better",2,2019,07,01
36,I loved it!!,Long overdue review! I stayed here for a week to celebrate my birthday. I needed a relaxing trip & I definitely got one. All the staff I encountered were lovely. Service by the poolside could have been quicker though. I did have a great time and I intend to stay there again when next I'm in Barcelona. ,4,2019,06,30
36,When your stay is almost perfect ),"I can say it was a 99%  perfect stay, the hotel is nice, breakfast is very good, rooms are clean  and bed and pillows are comfortable. Location is amazing, far from crowds but close enough to beach and nice walk.

Pure club beach is a must, maybe service is super slow and if you want a drink you need to wait a lot but at the end waitresses are very nice  and smiley people.

Room is short of amenities, maybe my only complain.

Very nice stay ! Two thumbs up ",4,2019,06,30
36,Great hotel next to the beach,"You have everything you need here. Beach, tours, good restaurants, ect.  Rooms were spacious, clean and up to date with all amentities.  Great breakfast buffet with almost anything that you would want.  Close to beach.",5,2019,06,28
36,Amazing hotel and views.,"We stayed at Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona for 4 nights and find it very difficult to find anything we didn't like about our stay. 
Rooms with beautiful views, breakfast was great, the swimming area was lovely, close to the beach and a massive shopping centre across the road.
tour bus pick across the road from the hotel which is very convenient.
Looking forward to coming back.",5,2019,06,28
36,Incredible Property!,"Just stayed at this Hilton for 5 days when we were in Barcelona. A very modern and well kept up Hilton. Check In was a breeze and the service was phenomenal. Our room was beautiful and very modern with incredible views of the sea. The bathroom was huge and beautiful! Beds were comfy, as well. The location is great with the shopping mall across the way. Tons of great restaurants. I recommend the Italian one amazing pasta. The pool area was stunning and so relaxing! Easy 10 minute walk to the beach! The ride into the city center was about 15 minutes and there were always cabs outside the hotel. I highly recommend this property if you’re in the Barcelona area! ",5,2019,06,27
36,Lovely hotel but loud music at night,"Very friendly and helpful staff, all area very clean and tidy. Hotel rooms are high standard and equipped with great little touches one would expect from a 4* hotel. Breakfast has a great selection and even has an omelette bar and also a smoothie bar. 

We were bed and breakfast only so decided on our first night to each at the Mai hotel bar. It was very expensive for food and portions very small. Standard was good though. 

There is a massive shipping centre across the road which has places to eat and lots of shopping!! So location is good. Also supermarket is there too. 

Costs around 11-13 euros to get a taxi to la Rambles and you can get a bus number 7. 

Disappointed about the pool bar. Cost 9 euros for a small larger and the music is too loud if you wanted to sit and chat/chill. The music is very loud until 11pm. You can hear it in your hotel room even on the 11th floor. Would not expect that to be honest.",4,2019,06,25
36,Hilton at its best ,"Room with an excellent view of the city and an executive lounge with coffee all day and views of the coast- all bases covered. The included breakfast was the best we have had so far (Spain, Portugal, and Morocco). Staff very helpful and pleasant. Easy walk to the beach area too.",5,2019,06,25
36,Can't fault it. Excellent stay,"I’ve stayed at this Hilton twice over the past 3 years and have had great experiences both times.

I was able to check in earlier than planned by upgrading. 
Victor at reception was great. Friendly, welcoming and helpful.

The room itself was very big with a nice view of Barcelona.

Breakfast was expensive but nice. A good selection.

I especially like the shopping centre just across the street. Only issue its far from town but if you plan your day properly you can enjoy the beach and still get to the centre. ",4,2019,06,23
36,Sleep deprived,This is a great hotel if you are a partier and/or like to stay up late. If you are there to tour the city and need a good nights rest this hotel is not for you. They “upgraded” us to the 21st floor over looking the pool and the ocean. We thought that was great until bed time.  The pool plays loud techno music (which only gets louder at night) well past 2am on the weekends. On Sunday it ended around midnight. So loud we couldn’t sleep and when calling down to the front desk they only offered us earplugs.,3,2019,06,21
36,Great Staff,"All the staff - front desk, concierge, executive lounge, breakfast - were all very helpful, friendly and professional. The room was nicely designed with modern flair. The executive lounge had a lovely deck to sip a beverage and watch the waves. We didn't use it, but the pool area was beautiful. The breakfast buffet was one of the best I've seen at Hilton  - including resort properties. ",5,2019,06,19
36,"Excellent Hotel, Good Location","Very clean, a few minutes walk from the Beach, good location. Staff are very helpful and welcoming. Special thanks to Franzy ( concierge) who had help us our day trips . He is very knowledgeable of Barcelona's attractions. Good breakfast. Thank you to Amelia Paler who was very approachable and to Beatriz Galiza for her expertise in smoothie and cocktails. Overall staff are impeccable, goes beyond their means to give a satisfactory service to clients. I will highly recommend your hotel to my friends and family and will certainly come back.",5,2019,06,18
36,Fantastic hotel with great pool.,"Hotel is very modern, lots of power outlets and USB ports, very comfortable beds. Breakfast is extensive with custom lattes from Jura Latte machines, fresh squeezed orange juice, smoothie station. The Pura Beach poor was great if you got a free Hilton bed otherwise it could be expensive to use. ",5,2019,06,14
36,Great Hilton Experience in Barcelona! ,"Beautiful views, great service, comfortable rooms, convenient location next to beach and convention center with easy access to cabs... The Hilton Diagonal Mar was a pleasant surprise for this Marriott Platinum member (yes I cheated on Marriott for the first time) and here is why:

Check-in: Luijie was quick to check us in and was sweet and accommodating all at the same time. I ended up going for a work conference at the convention center and my mom and sister tagged along so I needed a bigger room, Luijie swiftly checked us in and upgraded us for $80 more to a bigger room (that can accommodate us 3 comfortably) and with a killer view on a high floor!! Even after checking in he would send me texts to follow up m to see how was our stay and see if there was anything he can do. Even walking through the lobby, he always remembered our names and greeted us every time. Luijie was AMAZING!! 

Room: we had a king sized room and asked for a rollaway for my sister. Surprisingly the rollaway was just as comfy as our king bed!! Our view was a kick butt view of the ocean and pool. The room and bathroom were large for a European room! There were USB ports all around the room which is great for travelers coming from outside of Europe!

Location: Although it was close to the beach and just a short walk to the convention center (which was convenient for me as I was there 3 days) , it was about a 10 minute cab ride to Barceloneta and all the main attractions. There was a high end shopping center located just across the street and there were many decent restaurant options nearby! Oh and there was a taxi stop just in front of the hotel so there were always cabs around (sorry, no more Uber since January 2019). 

Breakfast: I had breakfast both in the electrics lounge and restaurant and I will say both were very good food and service-wise. Freshly squeezed zumo( juice) , smoothies, eggs, pastries, etc all available! 

Internet: Even the basic internet service was very good! I used it for work emails/downloads, Skype Business, FaceTime and even play Pokémon Go (yes the lobby is a gym for your Pokemon goers). 

Yes, the hotel was on the pricey side (close to 400€ per night) but with the service, modern offerings, and comfort. Overall we had a wonderful stay and would definitely return despite having to have an affair with Hilton ! ",5,2019,06,13
36,Couldn’t be better..,"I visited this hotel back in 2017 and this is my 2nd time there.
The rooms are freshly renovated , clean and spacious.
The staff are extremely helpful and smiley faces.
I was checked in by the same gentleman who checked me in two years ago, Mr Victor..
Along our stay , mr victor took good care of us and made our stay really unforgettable.

I would like to thank the whole team for the great job they are doing and especially mr Victor for his hospitality and the outstanding service that he showed.",5,2019,06,12
36,Great Hotel!,"Love this hotel, great location near the water and plenty of shopping nearby.  The room was very spacious and had great views of Barcelona.  The staff were very friendly and you have two great restaurants located on site.  I especially enjoyed the comfortable bed, you can count on a great night of sleep here.",5,2019,06,10
36,Best staff ever!!,We loved this hotel and would stay here again!! It’s right across the street from the beach!  Lots of taxis to take you anytime! Every main attraction is within 20 mins or so and the staff is unbelievably nice and accommodating!! The purobeach pool is so nice but the music at the pool and area  is so super loud... I like loud but this was too loud even for me!! Good music though.. could use more of a variety though!  Drinks are a little pricy $15 but super good!! The food was great too!!,5,2019,06,10
36,Fabulous again,"Stayed here 4 years ago and the rooms have undergone a facelift since then.  Nice bright fresh and airy.  We were upgraded to a top floor room with jacuzzi bath which was awesome. As before, all staff were very helpful and friendly - particular thanks to Enrica on reception.  The executive lounge terrace has great sea and city views from the 15th floor, Maxime and David were the perfect hosts.  Purobeach is great if you're into that sort of thing - weekends are extremely busy and boisterous, but there's a much more chilled vibe during the week, when poolside beds are available free to hotel guests if there's availability.  I know it's not to everyone's taste and the drinks prices are approaching Scandinavian levels, but for a couple of days it was fun for us.  Definitely the place for us in future visits to Barcelona.",5,2019,06,10
36,What a disappointment,"I stayed here as a business traveller and attended a conference at the nearby CCIB.
Price per night: €297.00 

My disappointment with this hotel started when I failed to find any contact telephone number or email on their website. Instead, you are encouraged to chat with a robot assistant. The robot could not help me much, so I was passed to a human. My question was - I'll be staying almost a week, is there any chance you could place a yoga mat into my room?
Some hotels do, don't they?
The contact person said he didn't know and gave me an email address of the Front Desk.
I wrote an email.

No answer. Ever.

But ok, it's a small thing.

The room itself was ok. The first thing I noticed is that there was no complimentary water. 
No bathrobe, either.
€297 a night, by the way.

But ok, it's a small thing.

The room itself looked nice and fresh, though.

The breakfast was average. Perhaps the smoothies are nice, but the rest is really average. You get this food at an airport café sort of place.

The worst experience was the pool bar. Prepare yourself to wait and wait and wait until anyone ever comes to you to take your order or to collect your payment.

I did look at my watch and so were the waiting times:
From the moment I took a seat on the sun bed  - 40 minutes of zero attention from staff
I tried 6-7 times to attract staff' attention by raising a hand and saying 'excuse me' when staff was rushing past me. In vain.
At the 41st minute I walked to the cashier and asked if I could take a look at the menu.
An employee assured me he would be with me right away.
At the 55th minute of waiting a drink was delivered - a glass of lemonade with a piece of lime stuffed into it. Not freshly made, just poured out of a can. 6 EUR.

At the 75th minute of waiting the salad arrived - five pieces of salmon, five pieces of avocado, supermarket sauce on top. 21 EUR.

What a disappointment.

On the morning of my departure an 'early check-out' envelope was delivered under my room door. I checked the invoice and discovered they were charging me for two bottles of wine from the minibar while I only consumed one. So, I called Front Desk, was passed to Room Service, explained the problem. They said someone would come soon. I waited 35 minutes, called Front Desk, was passed to Room Service, somebody said they would come soon. 15 minutes later an employee showed up to count the bottles and confirmed the error.

Jesus Christ.

I was so glad to leave.",3,2019,06,08
36,Excellent Service; fantastic location for convention center,"I stayed at the Hilton Diagonal Mar while at a business conference held at the CCIB. The service at this hotel was great. I found the staff to be friendly and very accommodating. The breakfast buffet was sufficient, and you can’t beat the proximity to the convention center.  I will also say that the pool bar was very nice, though pricey. I would definitely stay here again the next time I’m in Barcelona for work.",5,2019,06,07
36,Always Delivers,"I have stayed at this hotel number of times over the years and they have always provided a solid experience.

The issue I have is the lobby that sometimes feels like a bus station with cruise line desk(s) partially blocking ways.

I like the spacious lounge with wonderful patio (especially good on sunny days). Wish that guests wouldn't try using the lounge as their personal pantry. 

I like the good upgrades that at least returning guests get.",4,2019,06,04
36,Great hotel with awesome service!,"We stayed at this property five nights before our cruise and one night after.  The rooms were very well appointed, views of the beach and sea were fabulous and the beds are super comfy.  We enjoyed the executive club room for “happy hour” in the afternoon. David and Sergio were very gracious hosts.  Victor at the front desk was a pleasure to work with.  When we checked in for our second stay we were welcomed like family by Victor.  Although the hotel can not guarantee early check-in, they were able to accommodate us both times.  This is very nice after a long day of traveling.  The breakfast buffet is wonderful from food variety and service. Gabriela and Amelia provided great service.  If we ever end up in Barcelona again we would definitely stay at this property.",5,2019,06,03
36,Very nice,"Stayed with the family in a deluxe room. Nice room, layout, kind service, outside pool. Everything was great except the loud waterpipes. It turns out they are placed inside the room just behind a thin decorative panel. Everytime someone upstairs flushes or showers, it feels like they are doing it inside your room. Extremely annoying in early hours.",4,2019,06,01
36,Excellent experience BUT did not pay with your credit card.,"It was a beautiful experience but did not pay to the hotel with the credit card. Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona made two unauthorized transactions. I wrote 3 e-mails asking for the explanation and I did not get an answer.
Anyway, I will never stay in any Hilton hotel.

Razvan",4,2019,05,31
36,Shame about the pillows,"Great hotel with very attentive staff. Close to beach and although5km from the centre of town  an easy underground connection 5 minutes walk away and 10 minutes to the centre.
Unfortunately while the room itself was large and comfortable with sea view the bedding had been badly laundered and was lumpy. Attempts to change it resulted in only minor improvements, which was a little disappointing for a quality hotel. Breakfast was self serve but very good quality and choice although alack of  non dairy diet equivalents",4,2019,05,31
36,HOLA !,T'was an excellent place to stay after getting off the Disney Cruise to Barcelona.  Always enjoy the area and the hop on hop off buses.Have stayed here numerous times and will be returning next year. THANK YOU.,5,2019,05,29
36,"Excellent location,nice decor and great hospitality","Stayed for 4 nights in the end of Apr to early May.

Rooms were very pleasantly furnished and decorated giving a positive vibe. Beddings allowed a very comfortable sleep. The bathroom and, toilets were well maintained. The basics like clean towels and toileteries were all in place.

The reception staff need a special mention. I had arrived a couple of hours early and was waiting in a long queue for check in. The staff were attentive of that long queue and few of them suddenly emerged and helped in quickly clearing the check in queue. In spite of being a bit early they gave me the room without making wait till scheduled check in time. The only issued with my checking  in early was that I had to accept the available room- it was a twin bedder and being a solo traveller I would have preferred a queen size.However,after a 16 hour flight getting a room to rest was my priority, so I went with it and no complaints on that.Every encounter with the staff was pleasant. All of them were very cordial and willing to help.For people waiting in corridors they would volunteer and ask if any help needed-not very common nowadays.

Location is very good. Walking distance to the beach and convention centre. A huge mall is right across. Every possible brand available in Barcelona is present in this mall. All the food requirements are easily met within this mall.
 
Train station, bus stops all are at walking distance. Surroundings are very urban and safe.

The breakfast spread was quite good. In spite of the place being fully booked for a conference, they never seemed to be running short of stuff.

I also had a great view from my room. The in room Wifi speed was very good and did not need any extra purchase.  

Overall a great expereince. Fantastic place to stay.",1,2019,05,27
36,Nice hotel,"This hotel is nice, and it has a great concierge desk! They were very helpful and happy people. We had a great view from our room and the hop on hop off bus tour stop is right around the corner. It’s close to restaurants, shopping and most importantly — coffee! I recommend this hotel.",4,2019,05,27
36,Barcelona for Business or Pleasure,We were traveling following a cruise with desire to stay a few nights in Barcelona. Staff very accommodating to get us in to a room 4 hours early. Food and rooms incredible. View incredible. It is a bit away from some of the attractions but very close to beach and beach restaurants. Service also incredible! Very hip.,5,2019,05,16
36,Check in experience poor and bad staff attitude,"Check in was a mess. I checked in early and was given the expectation that my room would be available within 2 hours and I would be contacted. Went back to front desk after 3 hours and asked what the status was. They said “I don’t know. Could be 20 minutes or 3 hours.” Not helpful and had a defensive attitude.

4 pm rolled around and I never received a call stating my room was ready. So I went back to the front desk and they said it was available. I asked when it was available and he said he didn’t know. I expressed frustration that I’d been waiting all day. He just said they don’t call anyone after 4 (again with an attitude). I had to ask for my water and again the attitude just sucked. He told me to just use the water in the minibar and if they charge me to let them know. 

Just a weird experience. ",3,2019,05,12
36,NOT for families (or anyone with hearing),"This is the only time I have ever checked in and then checked out of the hotel on the same day. So atrocious that we found somewhere else to stay. Unhelpful staff, very poor accommodation of anyone that didn't want to go clubbing and listen to deafening music by the pool. Fully deserving of one star.",1,2019,05,12
36,Terrible hotel,"NOT a family hotel. Avoid at any cost unless you want your holiday ruined.
Staff don’t make any effort. Service poor. Music at 94 dB around the pool - to loud to talk to person next to you. 
TERRIBLE hotel.",1,2019,05,12
36,Great Hotel,"We loved this hotel as it was further out of busy Barcelona, but very close to the beach and promenade where you can walk in to the centre within 45 minutes.

There is a shopping centre close by and restaurants, but the best part of the hotel is Puro Beach Club on the 2nd floor. The sunbeds and pool were great. You can order food and drinks at your sunbed and the service was excellent. 

We were there at the weekend and there was a couple of hen parties, but they did not disturb us at all. 

Our room was on the 22nd floor and we had a view of the sea. The room was very clean and very large with lots of hanging space.

Overall loved this hotel and would return, as not many hotels have pools and you do need one after a busy day in the heat of Barcelona.",5,2019,05,12
36,Absolutely Outstanding ,"From the moment we arrived at this Hotel to check in we could not have had a better customer experience .

This was one of 3 Hilton’s we stayed in on our travels and it was by far the best .

We arrived slightly too early for check in and we were invited to wait in the Executive Lounge until our room was ready .  This was such a nice thoughtful touch . Before long our room was ready and wow it was amazing .

Beautiful sea and pool views spacious and well thought out design with plenty of room for our luggage . The bathroom was huge and to our delight it included a spa bath .  The bed was so comfortable and I loved watching the sun rise in the morning .

As we were celebrating a special occasion we also received a lovely cake in our room .

The Executive Lounge was great and the staff were amazing . So thoughtful and helpful .  The breakfast in the Executive lounge was lovely and to my surprise also included some hot choices . It was lovely eating breakfast up there and enjoying the view .

The Purobeach pool area was lovely although not quite warm enough to swim .

I liked the location although it was a little away from Barcelona’s most famous sights these are easily accessible via public transport or hop on hop off bus .  There was a great shopping centre across the road as well and the beach was a five minute walk .

Sadly we left the hotel to move to one in the city and I really wished we had stayed down there the whole time . 

Thanks again Hilton for an amazing and very memorable stay .",5,2019,05,11
36,Amazing Staff make Hilton Diagonal Barcelona simply the best,"I am just about to return to Ireland from the best Hilton experience that I have ever had. Wow is all I can say about the absolutely most amazing staff that I have ever come across in all the Hotels that I have ever stayed in. From the morning that I was checked in by the wonderful Coleen in reception it has been five star treatment all the way. The friendliness of the staff in every department has to be seen to be believed,!!! The executive lounge with Amelia , Sergio and Jordi is probably the best Hilton in all the Hilton’s that I have been in so far. But for me the highlight was the most unreal breakfast with such a variety of fantastic food of all types served by the friendliest and most helpful staff that I have ever met. They come from all different countries and all have very different stories as I took some time out to chat to them but do they know how their jobs . You are a credit to your Hotel and well done to Elizeeda your supervisor for her wonderful friendly attitude. I was particularly impressed with Augustina. Geraldine . Adrian .John and the fantastic Eloi who made the most beautiful Omlettes to order. This Breakfast has to be expierenced to fully appreciate it. Yovany as the Front office Manager you have to take the credit for the wonderful team that you have molded into the powerhouse of this hotel. From your reception team to the outstanding Concierge team and in particular Franky and Omar and Miguel also you were all so good at what you do.Keep up the good work. Next to the bedrooms. I always like a nice spacious bedroom and I was delighted as it was really lovely with a great view of the sea. Housekeeping standards were excellent and rooms were cleaned early each day with also very friendly and helpful staff.This hotel is in a great location as close to all Tour Buses and the Metro underground and has a gorgeous Shopping Center across the road. Finally as I head for home having had a ball in Barcelona primarily because of this outstanding Hilton Hotel and it’s wonderful staff I want to say a huge thank you to your General Manager Joachim because it’s from you and your amazing management skills that has made Hilton Diagonal kBarcelona probably the best of all the Hilton’s in the group. Well done to you and all your crew. I simply can say no more except that I will be back very soon again and continued success to you all in the future.

36,A great hotel highly recommended,"I have visited this hotel many times and its always a pleasure to return. The newly renovated rooms are delightful and if you cna have sea view room its bonus. The staff in the Executive Lounge are always so helpful and go out of their way to meet requests. I will return
",5,2019,05,07
36,Very nice place to stay in Barcelona,"I stayed three nights and was very pleased with this hotel. The rooms are spacious and clean with good views of either the beach or the city. The staff are very friendly and helpful. It was too cold to use the pool or take advantage of the beach location while I was there, but it would have been perfect if it had been warmer. It is a bit outside the city center, but the metro station is only a five minute walk away, so everything is quite convenient. There are a variety of restaurants and shops in the shopping center across the road as well if you want a bite to eat closer to the hotel. The bar/restaurant in the hotel has excellent coffee and cocktails and great service as well.",5,2019,05,06
36,Retreat away from city,"We stayed for a week at end of april.  To start, hotel is very nice. Right next to huge shopping mall with a ton of restaurants on the top terrace.  Rooms are a little larger then most european hotels.  Nicer but about same size as US hotel rooms.  Pool is pretty but too cold to use non heated pool.  
Here is the skinny about transport to city center. There is a tram that runs up to glories station every 2-5 min.  It takes about 5-10 min to get there.  We went to spanish school near barca stadium and it took about 45 min to get there with yransfer.  If you get on yellow metro line outside of forum instead you can get to city center in about 10 min. Total time with ealking to station and waiting for metro <20 min. Mytaxi app is what to use in barcelona and taxis are cheap. We went from hotel with 5 people to park guell front door for 15 euros.  So do not let the distance from center bother you.
Executive lounge is nice and for the little extra cost you get breakfast, drinks during day and coffee/tea and apertif from 6-8pm with alcohol. It was packed and food runs out so if you would like to eat then go early. 
We ate at hotel brkfst as well and very large spead and good food but pricey.
We loved the hotel. Very nice and connected rooms for family in private alcove. Will be back.",5,2019,05,05
36,Excellent family hotel!,"We stayed 5 nights and the hotel itself was great for our family.

Pros:
- breakfast buffet was awesome.  Lots of choices and the service was great.
- our suite was great.  Lots of room for us and our 2 kids.  Had a great view of the Sea.
- access to the executive lounge nightly was great.  Small bites and drinks available, which we visited every night.
- gym was pretty good.  Treadmills, elliptical, bike, rowing machine, dumbbells, and some weight machines.
- nice pool and lounge area
- across the street from a big shopping mall
- 2 blocks from the beach

Cons:
- a bit far from downtown; we had to walk 10 minutes to the subway and it was 4-6 stops into town

Hotel is great for those who want more room and less hustle and bustle from downtown. 
-",4,2019,05,04
36,Wonderful stay!,"Just stayed at this hotel for two nights, and couldn’t have been more pleased. Victor at the front desk was amazing, the breakfast options were delicious, and the rooms comfortable and clean. As a Hilton Gold member we were upgraded to a small suite facing the sea, and had access to the executive lounge. This made our stay even more special and we really appreciated the extra touches offered by the staff. The hotel is a bit away from the city center, but we love walking and didn’t mind. There’s also a metro stop nearby for those not interested in walking as much. I would definitely recommend this hotel!",5,2019,05,04
36,Perfect stay!,Perfect accomodation for a Barcelona trip. Near the subway station and nearby a shoppingmall with lots of restaurants ( mainly fastfood) one thing where the very high prices if you take something from the minibar.,5,2019,05,04
36,READ BEFORE BOOKING,"-Room only has 1 real bed (reservation for 4, 2 had to sleep on terrible spring sofa bed)
-Never got 4 towels and 4 glasses after room cleaning despite reservation for 4
-Room was never vaccumed during the stay
-Pee smell in the corridor (by the door)
-Cold shower 2 mornings out of 6
-Wrong bill (from someone else)
-Charge you 50 euros extra/night then you might get a refund if system works
-Can not do checkin the night before (due to the 50 euros extra charge) but system not working at 4am

-Key disabled prior to official check-out time

-FORGOT THE WAKE UP CALL!!!

-Friendly staff but could not solve any issue
, puro beach very nice, nice view from room
",1,2019,04,30
36,Close to Convention Center ,"The hotel is close to the Barcelona Convention Center, the Cruise Ship Terminals, the beach, a museum and the metro, it is about 30 minutes and 35 euro cab ride from the airport. There is shopping nearby and lots of OK restaurants. The staff are friendly and the service is excellent, the rooms are well appointed and comfortable. They have a safe in the room and an ironing board and iron. The buffet breakfast is worth the $21 Euros. There is a nice park nearby and great pub in walking distance. Buy the 10 ride ticket and use the metro to get to downtown and the tourist sites. I would stay here again.",4,2019,04,27
36,Hilton by the Mediterranean,"When we first arrived on our trip through Northern Spain we decided to plan our first two nights in Barcelona at the Hilton Del Mar.
We found this hotel property located in the new part of the downtown area. The rooms were excellent with great views of the Mediterranean. There is a nice enclosed mall across the street with good restaurants and shopping. We enjoyed our quiet walks in the evening in this neighborhood of Barcelona.
We found the hotel staff very helpful and assisted us from check in till check out. We enjoyed great breakfasts in the club on the 4th floor. The lobby bar was enjoyable and their restaurant is great.",5,2019,04,24
36,Fabulous stay ,"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Hilton Diagonal Mar:)  the staff were courteous knowledgeable professional and friendly 
The room was amazing, with a great view, extremely comfortable and clean! 
The hotel is only a 5 min walk from the ocean front.. 
across from the hotel is the Diagonal Mar .. 
plenty of shops and restaurants.
The other side of the mall is the Maresme Forum metro station .. the L4 line takes you to the city in 20 mins! You can link up to other lines, get to Sagrada Familia, Barrio GOTIC, Casa BATLLO.. etc 
The GREEN hop on hop off comes to the hotel too 
Overall an amazing experience!
My only criticism is the late check in @4 pm, but we could put our bags in and go into town 
The airport transfer is not free, can be expensive.. you could get a taxi too:)",5,2019,04,22
36,"Nice hotel, too far from activities","The hotel is very nice. But we wanted to be within walking distance of most attractions. Food was good, Lobby bar was nice. Pool area was also nice with outdoor dining. If we weren’t more interested in being in the middle of the action this place is nice. . ",4,2019,04,19
36,Very Good Hilton,"Very clean and modern room. Rooms are what I would describe as nice, not luxurious but very nice.  Upper floors have great views of the Med.  Pool/cabana area looks nice - too cold this weekend tho.  

Bed is very comfortable 8/10
Wifi fast and reliable 10/10
Excellent breakfast with many options 9.5/10
Bath is large 9/10
TV has 50 channels serving programming in all European and several Asian languages
Staff has been very helpful , all speak flawless English 10/10
Ample food options in the area including several Spanish ones in the neighborhood which I will try today

Only downside I would say is that this area of town feels more like Orlando than Barca.  All signs are in English, mall across the street with Five Guys and McD, Burger King. Spain is a few Metro stops away from the hotel I think.",4,2019,04,19
36,Professional service and surroundings,"Stayed here for 3 nights. Well located just a 5-10 min stroll to the nearby stretch of beach and right opposite a modern and useful shopping centre, this hotel is also on the City Tour sightseeing bus route - handy for going into town for some tourism. There is also a taxi rank  outside so there are plenty of ways to get around. 

The hotel is modern and fresh-looking overall. Some minor scuffs if you know where to look, e.g. the base of doorways, but otherwise very clean and tidy with nice décor. 

Service is professional and friendly. An error we experienced on check-in was rectified promptly and with an apology and the staff were polite and kind in general. 

Breakfast provided ample food of good quality. Space was at a premium at breakfast but we were always able to relax and enjoy a hearty start to the day. 

We had dinner at the hotel once, ordering from the Ma'i menu. We were pleasantly surprised by both the quality and the size of the meals. .The cost was reasonable. The bar also does good cocktails. 

All in all, a fantastic hotel, well run and situated in a great location. We would return.",5,2019,04,17
36,"Great location, close to the city","The Hilton Diagonal Mar is 5 subway stations from the centre and perfectly accessible by road. As you really don't want to drive to town, this is a good option, underground parking, combined with all the luxury of a well-run Hilton. Rooms are modern and well kept, service was at all times very friendly and competent, breakfast buffet was more the enough and even the gym was great, all in working order, clean and not too crowded. The pool area called ""Puro Beach"" is great fun, relaxing and drinks are delicious. We will be back soon....",4,2019,04,17
36,Excellent location.,"The hotel is located approximately 5 minutes walk from the beach. 
The staff is extremely helpful and will accommodate all reasonable requests. There is a shopping mall with a huge store Al Campo across the street. The metro and tram stations are within 10 minutes walking distance.",5,2019,04,16
36,Amazing property and service,"Stayed here for 4 nights . Excellent location , opposite to Diagonal Mar shopping mall . There was an issue with our room soFa bed on first night and the staff ensured we got an upgrade for this slight inconvenience. Outstanding service, rooms and entire experience ",5,2019,04,15
36,Good choice in Barcelona,I stayed here during the Mobile World Congress. My room was spacious enough and has good view to sea. Room was very comfort and clean. Beside the hotel there was a mall and food court. Taxi stand just near the hotel. Food for breakfast and restaurant were also good.,4,2019,04,13
36,Obviously no standards,"I was in Hilton NY couple of weeks earlier and the one in Barcelona is no match. Check in was bad, my booking.com total was 1000 euros and they requested 2000 before they realized their mistake. 

Have being at Hilton NY where internet for guests was free, I didn't notice upon booking this one at BCN that internet was not except in public areas, it was only free for Hilton honor members (they eventually granted me a complimentary access), but honestly do they think free wifi is an exceptional benefit? They might want to differentiate their club members with something exceptional rather than what 3 and 4 stars hotels are providing 

My room was horrible, there is this unpleasant smell in corridors and room. Plus, there is this running water sound in my room which would wake me up.

Last but not least bcs they can never seize to amaze you by service, when front desk asked me about my stay upon checking out, and when I told him, he appeared so apologetic and said he wants to make it up for me, I said doesn't matter bcs am checking out, he asked me if I was leaving BCN I said no am staying at a friend's for few days (seems he didn't expect this since am checking out) and he asked for my email address so that he can extend an invitation for at least drinks by the pool... of course this invitation never came through and I was not expecting them to as their service level was clearly bad

Luckily, they store your luggage... I would have understood if they don't too...

Simply a bad experience and never again at any of their locations... not consistent and bad
",2,2019,04,12
36,poor rooms for the price - bad check in experience,"Was here twice, first time I got a room where I found someone else naked in his bed, second time i was not able to check in and got an upgrade..... that was said - but then got a room with bad bathroom and even worse elevator noise. Difficult to access the internet. Would not choose it again as there are other hotels around with better value for the price. ",2,2019,04,10
36,Good Hotel,"Very good, I recommend this hotel for visits to the City. Easy to get to the centre by Metro and good shopping and restaurants nearby. Hotel very welcoming and good rooms and facilities. Staff friendly and helpful. All round good experience.",5,2019,04,09
36,Outstanding Views,"Wonderful staff! Great breakfast! Views were fantastic!! We visited for several days with outings. Staff was really helpful. The room was outstanding! It was clean, stocked and the views !!! Room service was good, we didn’t like the Asian spin on the menu but breakfast would satisfy anyone. ",5,2019,04,07
36,Great Hospitality Close to the Sea,"This hotel is close to the sea and has got a nice swimming pool. This might be found in a number of hotels. What is to be stressed is the hospitality and attitude of ALL personnel. Front office staff is extremely helpful, Omar and Francesco are doing excellent job. It was great and relaxing time I spent in Barcelona and Hilton hotel made it even better.",5,2019,04,07
36,Great business hotel,"Great business hotel not too far from La Ramblas etc (taxi ride) and about 20 mins from the airport. Some excellent eateries across the road for nights you don’t want to go into town. Friendly staff though I think house-keeping could do with a shake-up. David in the bar absolutely made our trip - super-nice and able to manage making many different drinks for different people, always polite and served with a smile. He was the star employee of our trip!",5,2019,04,04
36,"Location, Location, Location","Being a Hilton Honors member and location were initial reasons for selection but the hotel staff and exceptional service received will bring us back.  Mall directly across from hotel, many options for dining nearby.     ",5,2019,04,03
36,Nice hotel ,"Comfortable rooms.   Nice views.   Friendly staff.  Ample outlets for charging devices.  Superb breakfast.  
Considerations - 30 min from most tourist attractions via metro.   Several line changes for most destinations.  With Barcelona card included travel options, over 1 hour 20 min to airport.  ",4,2019,03,30
36,Modern hotel with beautiful views ,"The hotel is close to the beach area with gorgeous views of Barcelona. There are in house restaurants and other restaurant choices around the area.It is not close to the main tourist attractions. We used taxis and there is a taxi bank right in front of the hotel. We also used the Metro-the Maresme Forum station is only a couple of blocks away. It is a very updated hotel with modern amenities. PuroBeach Club is within the premises. We had a room with water views!Even if you do not get a room with water views,there are windows at the end of the hallways and by the elevators with awesome views of the city.Being HH members,we got complimentary breakfast.The buffet is topnotch and also offers local Catalan selections. After a day of exploring this beautiful city, it was wonderful to go back to this hotel with relaxing views and ambience- away from the busier tourist areas.In the summer,the beach is only a few minutes walk. Definitely a treasure and highly recommended.",5,2019,03,24
36,Excellent Hotel and Great Service Staff,"We booked 4 nights in this hotel. Our ride from the Airport on the freeway was swift this Thursday evening - 25 minutes, not having to pass through Barcelona City.
Our check in had been online, and we were offered an executive room on the 22 floor with sea view. We were greeted by a most cheerful and friendly Miguel and given a Diamond info package and lots of details regarding lounge access and membership benefits at this hotel.
Our room was a corner one with a low window on one side facing north and the main window facing east with a view of the sea. It was very spacious with the king bed and a couch along the low window side.
Bathroom was huge with a bathtub and separate shower cubicle. It took a while for us to appreciate the wavy shaped clear glass window without blinds in the bathroom. 
The room, bathroom were nicely cleaned every day by housekeeping. The only issue of note in the whole room was the tight fit of the glass shower door to its opening as the door seals were very stiff and the door was so hard to close.
We had lounge access, which had ""snacks"" from 6pm to 8pm- so we missed the first night. But wow! The food provided were more like main courses with a few choices and green salads- certainly enjoyed by the large number of guests we saw each evening. The available beverages were very good. Service and friendliness of David and Sergio in the lounge were the best in our experience of dozens of Hilton Lounges in USA, Europe, HK, Japan and Australia.
Breakfast in the Restaurant was very good in food quality and variety. The super friendly Michael mixing the different breakfast treats each morning- healthy and refreshing smoothies or fruit bowls was a special feature.
We like the location of the hotel with travel using the Metro some 30 minutes from the centre of Barcelona- low traffic volume, low traffic noise, clean air. The Diagonal Mar Mall across the road with dozens of food choices was a bonus.
Definitely our hotel of choice in Barcelona.
",5,2019,03,24
36,A HILTON CLASSICS   A family hotel with very nice breakfast,"After leaving a hotel the same day we have checked in ( we had a 4 days of booking ) we searched many hotels and even looked up rooms and finally decided at Hilton Diagonal Mar. Great we did. It was really nice room with a sofa bed and very clean. The breakfast was very nice and the location was superb. Just few steps to Diagonal Mar Shopping Mall full of eating places, a very big market  and  a playground for kids (A very strange design but unique) Many thanks to Marianne at the reception desk whom we met first at check in and the bellboy from Georgia (Sorry for forgetting his name) And thanks to the friend who was cleaning the windows from outside and with a smilingface waved hands to my kids  HİLTON CLASSICS",5,2019,03,22
36,Another Wonderful Hilton Hotel,"Once again, my experience with Hilton in another part of the world was great.  I can consistently count on them from hotel to hotel, location to location to deliver.   Great staff, great rooms, great bfast!   Excellence at its best.  Thanks once again until next time.  ",5,2019,03,21
36,Must go!,"Love this hotel and its location! Team is great, breakfast is amazing, executive lounge divine. Shopping across the road is perfect, beach is very close and the only thing I am waiting for now is for the pool bar to be fully open as this is the diamond of the hotel. Coming back for sure in June. 

Thanks guys for being amazing.",5,2019,03,21
36,Great Hotel,I loved the Hilton. It was an amazing location. Great rooms. Friendly staff. Nice pool area with day parties and just blocks from the beach. I would definitely recommend staying here. Mall across the street. Plenty restaurants and the metro train is just walking distance,5,2019,03,19
36,Elegant hotel. Freshly renovated with absolute executive feeling. A treat really.,"The hotel just underwent a mayor renovation (according to the stuff, it was completed in January 2019) and its certainly looking stunning. We had executive room with executive Lounge access, which did not disappoint at all, the views from there are quite something, service was spot on and food/drinks were particularly great and of high quality. considering that most of the pictures we checked of the hotel prior to out trip DON´T really show how the premises currently look, we were sceptical about whether to stay here or not but I'm so glad we did, we had a great time. Upon arrival we asked for late check out and were granted it immediately -stayed until 14:00 last day of our stay-, we went up to the room to find out there was a birthday cake awaiting for Us -small details do make a difference- Our room was very nice  and very ""Marina inspired"" style, spacious bathroom with bathtub. Executive lounge has a spacious terrace and the decor is overall exquisite and elegant -very Hilton executive-. Front desk stuff were super nice and I gotta say they do know how to approach their guests. all and all, we loved it. go for the executive lounge access, it is worth it!",5,2019,03,19
36,"Greatfull for the stuff, for wonderfull weekend","I would like to thank all the stuff in Hilton Diagonal for an amazing weekend!
Mr.Javier in front office was fantastic, gave us a wonderfull room with astonishing view and he made our stay memorable! I would like to thank everybody in the restaurant and specially chef Martinez, the sommelier and all the stuff in Aurt and Mai for a tastefull dining experience! The stuffed peppers were super, the chicken pasta amazing (best pasta outside Italy we have ever tried). The crackling chocolate tart with the sweet combination of the wine..incredible!!! I definitely wish to come back and try a new dish!!! I have to thank the young waiter for the best recomendations in the dishes (sorry for forgeting your name my friend)!",5,2019,03,19
36,"Friendly, elegant and relaxing ","You have to stay here. Nice location, atmosphere, staff, rooms, amenities et al. Next door to a mall, walking distance from the beach and La Rambla, good atmosphere. Came to Spain to watch my son play international friendly games. Couldn’t have chosen a better place to stay. Definitely coming back. ",5,2019,03,17
36,Great Hotel,"One of the best hotels I’ve stayed in. Extremely friendly and helpful staff, superb executive lounge and clean modern rooms. Oh yeah, and the breakfast in the morning is out of this world. 
I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 due to the location, but it’s actually pretty easy to get downtown on the train/tram/bus, or you can just walk down the beach!",4,2019,03,17
36,modern hotel away from metro,"Arriving by public transport from the airport, as was my case, is not very easy. The metro station is a walk away from the hotel entrance.
Rooms are large, with nice views on the upper floors. Pool is only open in summer months. Breakfast buffet is ok. there are some shops in the mall around the corner. During the summer this hotel must be very attractive; in the winter is was just nice.
Staff at check in were two students or so who took about 15 minutes to arrange check in, untill a senior staff came over to help.",4,2019,03,16
36,Outstanding hotel in Barcelona,"I enjoyed staying at this hotel during my stay at BCN. A shopping mall with many restaurants and a large supermarket available just opposite the hotel. 

Although room size relatively small but very clean and a very comfortable bed which may upgrade your sleep quality.

Breakfast is a highlight here at this hotel with very attentive staff. Good food quality and I enjoyed it very much.  ",5,2019,03,16
36,Brilliant experience,Brilliant experience thank you..from the moment we arrived and Selena checked us in. Came with my mum and the staff sent a gorgeous vake for her 83 birthday..perfect location for the diagonal mar shopping centre which is virtually attached to the hotel..staff were fantastic ..will definitely return,5,2019,03,16
36,Excellent,"Nice lication, close to the Metro station, near seaside, quiet, clean, very nice staff. Excelent breakfast. Taxi station just in front of the hotel. There is also a Mall nearby where you can shop some gifts or eat if you don’t have time to go in the center.",5,2019,03,16
36,Best choice (hotel) to stay!!!,"Nice design, spacious room, excellent food, great oceanview, perfect location (metro, bus around the corner). Very kind and smiling staff. The city one of the best in Europe. Very organized and humman.  Would 100% stay there again!",5,2019,03,14
36,the place to stay when in Barcelona,"had a great room on a corner of the building was able to see most of this city.  Thanks to Omar and Maria at the front desk, with their help we were able to enjoy the city.

will definitely stay there on our next trip",5,2019,03,10
36,very good exeprience,"location is great for  business travelers, and good for leisure
meetings room is super great, staff are very friendly
food is very good, with a very nice Terrance during your breakfast
GYM is very good but the  size is a little bit medium size
pool operates during summer season, with no heated pool ",4,2019,03,08
36,An oasis with easy access to Central Barcelona,"I will spend a total of 18 days in Barcelona in March, and spent a total of four nights at the Hilton Diagonal Mar. 
To be clear, I'm Diamond status through my credit card, which really helps. I couldn't have been happier with my stay. 
The hotel staff is freindly and professional, and facilties are excellent. The location is around 600 feet from the T4 Tram line, which gives quick and very cheap access to both central Barcelona -maybe 20 minutes- and the same to sea front Badalona across the river maybe 10 or 12 minutes away by tram. 
Get a sea view room if you can. It's like meditation to gaze out at the Med. ",5,2019,03,07
36,Amazing!!! ,I stayed at the Hilton Diagonal Mar at the end of January! I have to say it was brilliant! The staff were courteous throughout my week with them! Especially the gentleman in the Exec Lounge who greeted me with a drink every time I walked  in!! Although the hotel is a little out of the way (obviously not the hotels fault) the surrounding area is lovely and the subway to the centre takes just minutes! I can’t wait to stay again! I definitely recommend!!,5,2019,03,05
36,Great Modern Hotel,"We stayed a night on the way home from skiing - a little outside of city center but great hotel. We didn’t get to take advantage of beach bc of time of year but great anyway. Great exec lounge, all around great set up, walked downtown which was a hike but easy access to metro as well. Staying again in May after our cruise and highly recommend. Appreciated the Catalan decor and great service.  ",5,2019,02,27
36,Perfect service,Clean rooms friendly staff. Good breakfast. Nice sea view room but a bit expensive in a comparison with Hilton in other EU cities for this season. Just do not like a location -  a bit far away from the downtown.,5,2019,02,26
36,Gorgeous Hotel,Check in was a breeze.  The staff was eager to make my stay enjoyable.  Everything was clean and bright.  This hotel was a bit off the main Barcelona attractions but the metro was easy and convenient.  The executive lounge had many wonderful offerings and the breakfast was incredible.  I was able to try many regional items!,5,2019,02,26
36,"Convenient to Beach, Shopping & Dining","I stayed at this property for a week long business function.  I found the service outstanding.  The staff was very helpful with dining advice and reservations, as well as weekend tours and activities.  I enjoyed the breakfast buffet, which included omelets upon request.  The meeting arrangements went smoothly.",5,2019,02,24
36,Great stay at Hilton Diagonal Mar,"I had a great time at this hotel. All staff members (Front Desk, Bar, Breakfast) were super friendly and very proactive. 
I loved the design of the lobby and my room with sea view. From the elevator area you additionally have an impressive city view. 
The food at the executive lounge was very good and in the afternoon it was a quiet working space.
At the breakfast buffet I especially valued the Catalonian offers as well as the fresh orange juice and strawberries.
All in all the employees managed to create a perfect and hassle-free stay without any kind of complications from arrival to check-out. 
As I have travelled to many Hilton's before I can definitely say that this was above average.
Thank you, I'm sure I will return.
",5,2019,02,22
36,Great hotel!,"I spend 3 nights in Hilton Diagonal Mar, and  I must say the service and the overall experience was great.

Already at the checkin the lady at the reception offered me to help booking metro tickets online, gave me a map and circled the locations I wanted to go to - a small effort, but one I as a guest was very happy with as it saved me lots of time!

The rooms are great, and the hotel is conveniently located 200 m from the conference/exhibition centre and with a good shopping mall across the Street.

Fully enjoyed ny stay!

",5,2019,02,20
36,High quality Business Hotel,"This is the 4th time I am in Barcelona. All of our stays were in hotels located in the diagonal avenue. I have been in the princess Hotel and also AC Marriott (Which my room was robbed), both near Hilton hotel and also near the shopping center. I choose Hilton over the other two. Rooms were larger, more neat, room service better. The only drawback, was the noise of water/waste pipe.",4,2019,02,19
36,Didn't let us down again,"3rd visit to this hotel.  Despite us arriving late, we were warmly greeted and had been upgraded to a one bedroom suite.

The executive lounge has recently been updated and looks very smart.  Great breakfast served and despite it being February, we could sit out in the sun and enjoy breakfast.

Sergio who works in the lounge was wonderful. In the evening, he kept out glasses topped up with Cava.

Thanks guys - look forward to returning soon.",5,2019,02,12
36,GREAT HOTEL,Stayed at the Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona the night before the cruise.  Hotel staff was excellent and helpful during a taxi strike.  Accommodations were very good.  Signed up for the concierge floor and breakfast when we arrived.  I recommend both.,5,2019,02,08
36,"Good business hotel, food not at the right level ","The hotel is in a very good position for the conference center and in general for business meetings, not so much for visiting the city. Rooms are fine, people working there really nice, good business facilities and a big shopping center just in front of it. The bad part is the restaurant. Not good breakfast or lunches, I really did not enjoy that and went out to the mall to eat at some point. I think you should work on this point.",4,2019,02,08
36,"Great end of our cruise vacation, almost a disaster!","This was a very clean, familiar and affordable option to end our trip. Great sea views! Pool area was nice and buzzing. Ended up being a bit difficult getting around the last day but only due to a massive marathon in town. Overall staff and facilities were fantastic! A+++ and a 10 star rating for honesty! We left out and when in the taxi realized that we had not gotten the contents of our safe! Gads! Couple thousand in cash, passports etc. Every bit waiting for us at the counter upon our arrival! Sorry for the delay in porting this review, it is a life after all! Was actually back in October 2017!",5,2019,02,05
36,"Great Hotel, simple as that....","We spent the we in Barcelona and managed to stay at this Hotel. I recommended it to everyone. the rooms are nice and clean, the breakfast is amazing and everyone is very helpful. We are definetely coming back!",4,2019,02,04
36,Nice hotel with large rooms,"Nice, clean hotel with large rooms especially by European standards. Good views of sunset from higher floors. Quiet for sleeping. Lively mall right across the street and convention center is just steps away. It is about 3 miles from the city center, so that is the only downside. We were there during a taxi strike so the distance was a bit of an issue. Highly recommend this hotel.",4,2019,02,03
36,Best Hilton stay to date,"Beautiful hotel, friendly and helpful staff.  The location was great.  Close to the marina and beach, and plenty of food choices nearby. Would highly recommend this hotel for couples it families.   Barcelona at its best.",5,2019,02,01
36,Just great as usual,"This is love from the very beginning, it was our maybe 10th stay. This is a great hotel with heartbreaking views. The redone lobby looks gorgeous as the executive lounge. The staff is professinal and friendly, room service is outstanding.",5,2019,01,31
36,Thank you - wonderful stay!,"Thank you to everyone at Hilton Diagonal Mar for an enjoyable stay. Special mentions to Omar on reception for being so welcoming and personally attentive at check-in, and to Sergio in the Executive Lounge for his excellent service with a smile. The room was also lovely - I look forward to returning in the future to try out the new restaurant and experience PuroBeach in the summer months. Thank you!",5,2019,01,31
36,Amazing! - 5 Star!,"Stayed with family for leisure for 9 nights and from the time we arrived to our last day we were not disappointed. We arrived at 12 noon and my request for early check-in was honored. Also, my Diamond status with Hilton was recognized and our room type was upgraded to Execuitve Sea View (executive rooms at this hotel are not located exclusively on the executive floor (15) as in many hotels – mine was acuatlly on 17 – but these rooms are more modern and recently renovated. The corner room also had a bit of extra space and windows on two of the walls vs just one. We could not only sea the Sea from our room but also the Pool and the city.

The hotel itself has 23 floors and the executive lounge is located on 15. The lounge was staffed with a hostess most of the time who not only confirmed the guests came into the lounge were authorizieed, but also provided detailed and helpful information about places to see, restaurants and things to do – all of which were very helpful. The lounge serves an excellent cold and hot breakfast from about 7-11 and evening canapes with complimentary bar service from 6-8. The lounge is open from 7 am – 9 pm and one can access a variety of soft drinks, coffees, teas and light snacks all day. The lounge was recently renocated and has a terrace with views of the neighgourhood of Pobleneau, the Purobeach pool and the Mediterranean Sea.

The location was a great jumping off point for trips to downtown Barcelona and only a couple hours drive from Andorra and Southern France. Would stay again!",5,2019,01,26
36,Nice place but terrible customer service,"Hôtel Hilton is a nice place: bedroom are confortable, bathroom are large, executive lounge is very nice with a large terrasse and nice staff, especially this guy in the evening who does all he can to make sure you have a good experience. 
Unfortunately, they tend to overcharge your credit card without your authorization, staff at the reception are not the most friendly people and seem not to care about your stay. You need to call the staff if you want your bathrobe back, shower gel in the bathroom or bag for your dry cleaning. They never refill your mini bar as well which is not confortable when you stay 2 weeks in this hotel. For more than 250e per night, you expect a better service than the one they provide. I won’t come back in this hotel and will stick to Hotel in city center next time. ",2,2019,01,26
36,Perfect,stayed here for a 4 day business trip very good hotel excellent staff giid rooms huge Shopping Centre over the road the sea just behind the hotel close to the conference centre easy public transport into the city has parking all in all the fantastic,5,2019,01,26
36,worst experience with costumer service at hilton diagonal mar barcelona,"charged a penalty for early departure (?!?) equivalent to a nights stay.unheard of, abusive, not to mention illegal.unjustifiable at a hostel, let alone a top rated hotel!no justification or valid explanation from staff.hardly justifiable in a supposedly oriented business tourism location.",1,2019,01,25
36,Fine accommodation at Hilton Diagonal Mar,"Hotel is conveniently located, 5 minute walk to the beachfront. Rooms are spacious and comfortable. Staff are respectful and easy to talk to. Breakfast was good and facilities are all excellent at the Hotel.

Some tips:

1. Ask for a sea facing room 
2. Buses and metro is close by
3. Shopping across the street is excellent at Diagonal Mar. You can get almost everything there.
4. Accessibility to the rest of the City is also nice and easy.",5,2019,01,16
36,Excellent stay,"Great location close to the sea front with fantastic sunrise views. Opposite the Diagonal Mall which is handy for shopping and eating. The rooms are very spacious and the exec lounge is brilliant and large, probably one of the best i've been in with a great choice of nibbles and breakfast was good too. The staff were so friendly couldn't fault them at all.
One downside is the distance to the City centre but the Metro was only a few minutes walk and of course you can Uber if you prefer (approx 10 euros).",5,2019,01,11
36,Family stay at Hilton diagonal,"Second time at this property. Booked two rooms as a diamond member. Connecting units one with twin beds the other one King. Excellent view. I had trouble using the digital key once it was enabled. It was impossible to open the main door that led to the connecting rooms with the digital key. Regular keys worked great. I went down to reception desk to fix the key issue. They were quick and I was on my way. Staff is excellent here. Complimentary breakfast is excellent and has plenty of hot and cold choices. The executive lounge is also cool. Sandwiches, pasta, salad, fruit and potato chips are available. They had a couple of choices for beer and quite of few wine and spirit choices. Location is excellent, across the street is a nice mall with plenty of food choices. A five minute walk to the Mediterranean and a 10 minute walk to a couple of metro lines which take you to city center. You will also find a taxi rank at the corner of the hotel. ",5,2019,01,09
36,Wonderful,"Executive Lounge was exceptional (large, spacious, well stocked). Service was great.  Location is a bit out of downtown but this made the experience even better.  Views were amazing.  Clean well maintained rooms.",5,2019,01,06
36,Reasonable price during peak season,I stayed during Christmas holidays and the price was reasonable. The location is not really close to the center but there are some sightseeings around. The lobby is under maintenance. I did not really get room upgrade as a Hilton Diamond. Executive lounge was full of guests during happy hours. No hotel staff in the lounge to validate the guests or manage the tables. Breakfast was great. ,5,2019,01,05
36,Despite the renovations the hotel was great,"Great location for the beach and downtown Barcelona
Fantastic attitude from every member of the team.
Especially the breakfast and the executive lounge
Cannot wait to go back in the summer.
Would recommend,great value",5,2019,01,03
36,Christmas stay,a really comfortable hotel with the best bed ever never slept so well. Renovations keep the breakfast chaotic as everyone uses the executive dining room. But staff were very helpful and friendly. Near the city centre via the metro and close to the shopping mall and extensive sandy beach.,4,2018,12,30
36,"Wonderful staff, nice location,","The hotel was located very good location, close to shopping mall, very well trained staff, helpful, always smiling and gives you positive energy during your stay. Executive Lounge was over standards. We love there. ",5,2018,12,28
36,We have a wonderful honeymoon trip in Barcelona,wonderful experience with Hilton diagonal mar Barcelona very helpful staff and get us outstanding ocean view room and offer the executive lounge for Hilton members was definitely a plus and we definitely will stay there when we go back again thank you for the wonderful stay and merry Christmas ,5,2018,12,26
36,Wonderful,"This hotel couldn’t have done any more to make our stay any better. It was a trip for my husbands 40th birthday. We arrived early and the lady on the desk booked us in, and arranged for our room to be ready ASAP. Unfortunately the executive lounge has just closed for breakfast but recommended a few places to go and took our mobile number to text us when the room was ready. She was extremely helpful with recommendations of what to do while we were there and travel arrangements through the city. 
The room was amazing. Even a treat for my husband for his birthday. (See picture)Views out of this world. Recommended to watch the sunset at 7:30am and we weren’t disappointed. 
Only disappointment was that the seal had gone in the shower screen and flooded the bath room after the family of 4 had a shower. I’m sure once we reported it they were quick to fix although we checked out and continued our tour of Barcelona. 
Would definitely stay here again.",5,2018,12,17
36,1 star hotel,"One star is more then enough for this hotel. After check-in i entered the room to find durties under the bed (attached pic) and opened nuts and biscuits on the desk. I informed the information about this and on my return back to the room at night i found a notification from front office to pay for the mini bar nuts and  biscuits already opened (pic attached)
They solved the mini bar problematic the next day however for 2 consecutive days i was asking to remove durties under the bed without success until i checked out! ",1,2018,12,16
36,Outstanding - wonderful staff!,"I stayed here with my family - parents, brother and sister-in-law and absolutely loved it.  I am a Diamond Hilton member but the staff here went above and beyond to make ALL of my family feel very welcome and special.  This started at check in when someone rushed over to help my father, and then took our car away to park - they did this to help us, not for any money!

On check in our rooms were allocated and the lady let my parents go to the lounge while I sorted out the detail of the booking - again a very nice gesture after a long trip.

The rooms were wonderful - great views, although the beds were a little hard for me (a normal Hilton gripe!).  The bathroom was good and was big.  The hairdryer was of a good quality.

We had snacks and a drink in the downstairs restaurant, and although it was difficult to get the staff's attention, the drinks and tapas we ordered were very good.

The Executive lounge had great views and the evening food and drinks were of good quality - you could easily make it your main meal if you wished to do so.

We had breakfast in the restaurant both mornings and it was one of the best breakfast buffets I have experienced in all my travels - really good quality and something for everyone - including an omelette station.

I found everything about this hotel topnotch but it was the front desk staff that really made it for me.  My family cannot stop raving about the place and want to go back - that is high praise indeed!",5,2018,12,12
36,Good quality Hilton Hotel,Hilton Diagonal is a nice but typical Hilton Hotel. Location is great very close to the beach and directly opposite of a big shopping mall. Rooms are good but nothing really special. Plus is the Puro Beach Club at the pool area.,4,2018,12,11
36,Don’t come here; their heating is not working ,"Dont come here; their heating is not working! They only put the heating on after 8 o clock at night and till 8 in the morning ! I am here now freezing, this is unbelievable. They should close it until they fix there heating problem. I never had something like this in my life. Also there is some construction in front of he hotel there is noise everywhere ",1,2018,12,10
36,Nice Place,"Beautiful, clean hotel and very helpful staff, always willing to assist and provide information about the local area.  Provided us with a very thoughtful bottle of champagne for our wedding anniversary. Located very close to the ocean and the mall, although is a bit far from attractions. Be prepared to take advantage of local transportation.",4,2018,12,09
36,Hilton is not luxury .,"just disappointed from the Hilton as it once had some luxury and class attached to this Big name but it was very avg. hotel - very avg. service and average overall ... 
i would try something more extravagant for my next trip like the W hotel..
too bad the service was so lacking.",2,2018,12,09
36,Wonderful stay in Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona for our debut visit in Spain !!!!!!!,"This hotel impressed me at once during my check in.  All staff are very friendly to hotel guests, especially to overseas tourists and presented as professional, helpful & cheerful.  The front desk officer asked us whether we were first time to Barcelona, i told her it was our first time to visit Spain.  She immediately arranged a nice room for us, with beautiful mediterranean sea view at the front and pool view at the side.

There was also a jacuzzi bath tub in the toilet and we enjoyed this nice surprise really a lot.

The food and variety provided in the cafe during our breakfast time was also impressed.  Lots of ad hoc dishes were brought to our tables, freshly made during the sunday breakfast time too.

Overall, the location of the hotel is good, with a big shopping mall just at the opposite and metro / bus stop within walking distance and the software & services of the hotel are brilliant.

Definitely will choose to stay again in my next visit at this hotel, to this superb city, beautiful and lovely Barcelona, with delicious food and friendly smile.

P.S. please do not mix up this hotel with the other Hilton Barcelona Diagonal hotel, without the name, ""Mar"".",4,2018,12,07
36,"Great location, superb facilities and first class customer service !!!","I was lucky to be staying at the Hilton Diagnonal Mar in early Dec 2018 for three nights in order to attend a conference.  The facilities are first class (as expected for a Hilton hotel) and my  room is modern, spacious with great views to the city skylines. Check in and check out were seamless and quick. The staff were all very helpful and always attentive. 

The conference facilities were superb with interactive iPads provided for us. Breakfast (7am-10:30am) was great with a lot of choices. On certain days, they also have a chef onsite who cooks lovely omelettes to your requirements. 

Across the hotel is a large shopping centre known as Diagnonal Mar. There are numerous restaurants within it which sells food at very reasonable prices. The large convenient store, Alcampo makes shopping easy and within reach.

If you wish to visit the city, ask for a Barcelona City map and the Metro map from the helpful staff in Reception. The nearest Metro station is at El Maresme Forum which is a couple of streets across the  Diagonal Mar shopping centre.  From there, it is only a 20mins underground ride to Pg de Gracia along the L4 line. It is easier to purchase a set of T10 (10 single journey tickets) at the cost of Euro10.20 from the vending machines at the Metro station. These T10 tickets can be shared if you are travelling with family. From Pg de Gracia, it is walking distance to the La Pedrera, Basilica la Sagrada and Casa Batlló. Also, lots of shops along the way. 

For those who like a bit of walk / jogging, the beach and esplanade is just 4 mins from the Hilton Diagonal Mar. One can walk for miles along the seafront. The views of the morning sunrise along the horizon is stunning ! It certainly made my day when I was there ! A good walk from the hotel along the seafront will take you to the Marina and beyond. 

All in all, I had a wonderful stay at the Hilton which was helped by the wonderful team they have there. Although I was in Barcelona for a work related conference, I would certainly like to bring my family to stay at the Diagonal Mar on our next holiday !",5,2018,12,04
36,"Great hotel, great lounge, friendly service","I stayed at this hotel for 5 nights during my trip to Barcelona and enjoyed it very much. Check in was great, arrived very early like 10am and she was all ready to check me in and upgraded me to a suite with a nice beach view! She thanked me for being a Diamond member and seemed very enthusiastic about me staying at the hotel. I felt immediately welcomed!

Also this hotel sent me a nice text message a day beforehand just to check in on me and see if there was anything I needed before I arrived, very nice touch and I was able to tell her about me arriving early and request for any room upgrades, which both was fulfilled! :)

The room itself was great, very spacious, the bed was very comfy and the view was great. They even surprised me with a little box of chocolates and artisan water! NICE TOUCH! Throughout my stay I'll get a text once in a while from the hotel to check in to make sure everything was to my satisfaction again great little touch!

The executive lounge was fantastic, had a nice outdoor patio and space. Breakfast was ok in the lounge not too much food options, but sufficient. The evening reception was impressive though, real hot foods and good spread. Also had many different wine selections and also an organic prosecco, and with a nice choice of hard liquor too! Rare to see in a free executive lounge.

There are two things that make this hotel slightly not as attractive. 

1. The shower was very not good, the temperature of the water was inconsistent and would never get hot enough, so some mornings I had to take warm/cold showers and the temp will change on its own. I brought this to the attention of the hotel and they said they would address it, but even the day I left it still had that problem.

2. This is no fault of the hotel, but the location is kind of far away from the center of downtown Barcelona, so its a good 8-9mins walk to the subway. Or if you taxi its pretty expensive, 13-18 euros each way. So just be aware if you're looking for a hotel that is walkable to a lot of the tourisy destinations, this is NOT the right hotel, unless you don't mind taking more time to public transport.

Other than that everything was great, even had turn down service for being a Hilton",4,2018,12,04
36,Super customer experience,Just stayed at the Hilton Diagonal while attending a conference just a few doors down. What a great experience. The welcome from Frankie at the front desk was warm and very human after a days travel. The same experience with the breakfast staff who were attentive but in the background. The hotel room was of a v high standard and the reception / bar area was v nice. Would definitely stay again. ,5,2018,11,29
36,Vacationing in Barcelona,"The rooms are large and nicely done, the staff is super hospitable and helpful, the breakfast buffet offers everything and is fresh.  If you want to be out of the crowds,  this would be the right hotel for you.  

However, be aware you really need to use the Metro to get to the sights of Barcelona.  You really walk our of this hotel and be close to very much (except the mall across the street).  Additionally, the Hop-on-Hop-off changes its route during the winter months so the bus doesn't go by the hotel.   
  ",3,2018,11,29
36,Beautiful hotel. ,"Stayed here in August with a group of 4 of us. The hotel itself is absolutely fabulous and I cannot fault their modern design. We had interconnecting rooms which was extremely useful. Beds were extremely comfortable and rooms were very spacious. 

The pool area is absolutely outstanding but it is not part of the hotel it is a ‘beach club’ and you have to pay for your sun lounger each day and some of the prices can be absolutely ridiculous!! 

Their is a shopping center across the road which is fabulous and prefect for your last day shopping. Beach is only a 7 minute walk away. 

There are taxis lined out beside the hotel so to go further into the city it was only 10€. There is also a tour bus which is to the right of the hotel which rings you round the city for 40€ for a 2 day ticket. 

Reason for 3 stars was we would order room service each day we were there and add our drinks to our room if we ordered them by the pool, we would collect the bill every morning and every single time they had over charged us. we had to go down and example this to them, as we had a discount on all food and drink which was never applied and it would lead to a 30-40 minute wait around trying to get everything fixed. Other then thst everything else was pleasant. ",3,2018,11,28
36,Nice rooms. Nice hotel but poor reception,Very nice hotel and I have stayed here a few times before. Rooms are beautiful and so was the executive lounge for breakfast but I have noticed that on each arrival there is typically little or no assistance and a queue for checkin. Something that I believe can be easily fixed. One last comment for the great view from the room in the morning. Picture attached. It speaks for itself. ,4,2018,11,28
36,Excellent Service,"I stayed here with my family, we got a deal that included both Breakfast and Dinner, breakfast was really good with made to order Omelets, fresh squeezed Orange Juice, great coffee and a varity of other fresh items.Dinner was great, it was a really good 3 course menu, the down side is that the special Menu for the dinner was very limited.Rooms are very larger than other hotels in Barcelona but not as large as your usual U.S Hilton hotel.It is located right across from a major shopping mall with tons of restaurants, Metro station is within walking distance.",5,2018,11,25
36,"Selecting a hotel in Barcelona, Spain","The Hilton Barcelona Diagonal Hotel is a Modern 15 Story high rise hotel located by the ocean ( about a 20 minute/30 euro cab ride from the airport).
Directly across the street from the hotel's front entrance, is the ever popular and clean modern Diagonal Mar shopping center with it's shops, super market and a number of very nice restaurants to chose from.
The hotel I booked was an ocean front room. On check in, I was given room # 1015 on the 10th. floor,  just steps away from the elevator, which I really liked! This large size room had a very comfortable King bed with a nice size bath room . Ocean view was really nice during the day. At night, nothing! Pitch black! I would opt for a room with a city view, as the city lights at night are spectacular!
The key to getting a good room rate is to book ahead. I booked my reservation  in Jan. 2018 for a 4 night stay arriving on Oct . 2018.  The total cost was 750 Euro's.
This hotel is very popular and fills up quickly with higher rates if you do not book early.( On check out, the room rates jumped to a high of 450 euro per night)!!
If you are a Hilton Honors member, the executive level rooms are really nice. It will entitle you to eat in the Executive Dinning room ( no charge) to enjoy a  good breakfast and dinner,  located on the 15th. floor. You will have  great views from inside dinning  or   out side on the terrace, your choice!
You will need a special  coded room key to access the elevator that will take you to the 15th. floor and to open the dinning room door. ( all floor levels are key coded to prevent unauthorized access by the elevators) As you enter the dinning room, there is a hotel staff member to welcome you and servers  to provide excellent service.
The hotel lobby area is very nice with comfortable chairs. 
All of the  hotel staff I found were very nice. 
The front check in staff were especially nice and went out of their way to help me .( on arrival, I had to see an eye doctor and was quickly sent over to the Saint Pau emergency hospital. The International Staff member assigned to me spoke excellent English and had me checked in and was immediately escorted to the eye specialist. 
It worked out great for me)! I would recommend this hospital  to any one that had any kind of a medical issue. The cost was 295 euros.( Recommend travel insurance when out side the US 0f A). cab fare was 11 euros from the hotel.
I would like to mention that I had an issue in the hotel which was handled quickly and efficiently by the Hilton day manager Ms.??? on 25 Oct 2018. Muchas Graces.
Cab fare to the cruise ship terminal was around 19 euros.
All cabs have meters, so you can see exactly the cost of your taxi fare displayed on the meter. 
No need to reserve a cab. There are plenty of cabs lined up and ready to roll! If not, the hotel will call one for you and by the time you walk out the front door, the cab will be there.

Wishing you Happy Travels and Good Health!

36,New building in good neighborhood,"The hotel is a little removed from the tourist areas and the port, but it’s quiet.   We had a large clean room that was available when we arrived from the airport.  The room had a large safe, but it was too small for my laptop. We didn’t hear any street noise in our room. The curtains keep out the light and the bed & pillows were comfortable.  We had access to the executive lounge and it was well stocked during breakfast and the evening happy hour.  We recommend this hotel and plan to return on our next trip to Barcelona.",4,2018,11,24
36,Great Location and Standard Hilton,"Stayed for 5 nights. I was booked an executive room. Anna who checked me in gave me a nice quiet room as per my previous request on the 18th floor. The room had a great view of the Mediterranean. The hotel is within few minutes walk to the congress center. It is also within few minute walk from the beach. There are several beach front restaurants within 1-2 mile walk. The hotel is also across the street from a convenient small mall with multiple dining options. The executive lounge serves breakfast and dinner. No water bottles available for room use at the lounge. For breakfast fewer varieties available, this is why I decided to use the main restaurant. Dinner was rich. The views from the lounge are really breathtaking. The staff is very friendly and helpful at the lounge. The main restaurant was congested for breakfast. The space for the buffet is limited and people could easily cross each other. The staff was hardly catching up with the crowd. I used the small patio that was less congested in the morning for seating. The conference facilities were great and the food was really great as well. All in all it was an excellent experience and would definitely come back again.",4,2018,11,22
36,An amazing stay in a stunning hotel,"I’ve been for 3 nights during the weekend. The hotel is beautiful, in front of the sea and 2 mins walking for the mall. You can walk near the sea and reach easily the main city center. Bedrooms are very special, a lot of space, great bed and stunning view. Breakfast is one of the best in Europe so far!! Special mention to the staff, all of them friendly and helpful. Special mentions for Maria Laura Rodriguez and Maria Clara Dell’Aria, they’re representing all the Hilton values!! Thanks a lot and see you soon 100%!!",5,2018,11,18
36,Great hotel ,Room view overlooking the ocean. A little bit of a ride to down town. Breakfast was very nice.  Significantly better than Madrid airport Hilton.  Staff are great. They checked on on us a couple times to make sure we had everything we needed,4,2018,11,17
36,A good Hilton Hotel,"This hotel delivers what you expect from a better Hilton Hotel in Europe, Nice room, clean and quiet. Attentive and nice staff. The breakfast is good but quite busy. I visited for a conference with 200+ people and it worked out quite well",4,2018,11,15
36,Love this hotel!,"Wonderful hotel. Not in city center, but easy and inexpensive access by subway. Beautiful beach views and shopping mall with restaurants across the street. This was our fourth stay, and we intend to stay there on future trips to Barcelona.",5,2018,11,13
36,Wonderful Hilton hotel ion out skirts of Barcelona,"We neede a pre cruise hotel in Barcelona. We had been to Barcelona before and new we wanted to be near the Marina area for dining.  We chose the Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona.  It’s a 15 min taxi ride from mid town ( no issues.  Taxis are plentiful). The hotel is near the convention center. Very pretty building. In character with this new area of Barcelona.  Shopping mall across the street if you forgot something you need for your visit.  Rooms were just lovely, well appointed.  The staff from the bellmen to the front desk couldn’t have been nicer, or more helpful.   The buffet breakfast was plentiful and delicious.   Would we stay there again..absolutely!",5,2018,11,13
36,"good service, nice place","The hilton is located very well for conferences and I liked my stay here, great airy lobby, good food, and as we are used to, good service. The size of the rooms and the style were quite standard, you may like it (as you know what to expect) or not (not too many experiences)...",4,2018,11,12
36,Would not return ,"My husband and I spent our last night in Barcelona at this property. We were spoiled our first few nights, as we stayed at a much nicer Hilton property in El Raval. We had to switch hotels and hated the location of this property. It is NOT by the beach, and is NOT convenient. Three beggars accosted is on the way from the metro (6+ blocks away) to the hotel. No one greeted us or offered to help us when we arrived. The location is in an industrial neighborhood that appears to be high crime. We did not feel safe walking to and from the metro. On the morning of our departure, we were nearly robbed but were able to get away unharmed. 

The room was mediocre, but it would have been worth paying more to stay in a nicer hotel in a safe and convenient neighborhood. 

This place is intended for conferences and  cruise boat crowds.",2,2018,11,10
36,What you would expect,"In my opinion, this is a pretty standard 4 star Hilton.  The size of the room is standard for a modern hotel in Europe.  It is clean, well organized, and has the expected amenities.  It is a short ride from the historic center, but walkable to a beach and a mall with many popular dining options with outdoor seating.  Taxis are always available and all the Taxis in the city seem to know the location of this hotel. Service was good considering this is a very busy hotel with tour groups, cruise passengers, etc.  We arrived on an early morning flight and they managed to have us in our room (after a few hiccups) by 12:30, which was great.  Overall, this hotel was a good fit for our stay.",4,2018,11,08
36,Wonderful stay,This was a wonderful hotel. Well located. Walking distance to the beach and a hop away from city center. Next to the Diagonal Mar mall. The breakfast buffet had a large variety that can please any pallet. Definetly recommend it.,4,2018,11,07
36,Oh Barcelona..,"Nice hotel, very accommodating experience, staff was very attentive. Location is 5 min from the ocean train not too far to center of town, Shopping mall right across from the hotel. enjoyed it will diffidently go back",5,2018,11,07
36,Top hotel Barcelona,"This is my 3rd time I stay in this hotel while being in Barcelona.        Friendly staff, perfect service, nice & quiet rooms.  Perfectly   situated next to the congress center and to visit the city by taxi or public transport.",5,2018,11,06
36,Birthday in Barca,"My girlfriend and I stayed in Barcelona for five nights with only one objective, do absolutely nothing (no city tripping and visiting musea etc.) and fully enjoy the sun from around the hotel’s pool (Puro Beach).

I always had the idea that Barca is a city to visit as a city trip vacation -with a lot of walking and visiting-. This is not the case when staying at the Hilton Diagonal Mar.

We arrived pretty late according to more Northern European standards (around 11pm) and were quite hungry from the trip from Ibiza to Barcelona. It took room service less than half an hour to have a cosy table installed in our room full of delicious food that was prepared in the ground floor restaurant. 

Sleeping well into the next morning isn’t hard in those perfect beds with perfect pillows (if Hilton ever orders one too many, and does not know what to do with it, please send it to me!). After we decided to get out of bed we were able to fill our stomacs again at their great breakfast buffet!

Next stop.. Puro Beach. Beds are for free for hotel guests and there’s a nice vibe around the pool with a dj on Saturday.

I can’t wait to go back to Barca and when I do, I’ll definitely stay at this hotel again! 

Travel time to the airport? 45 minutes max by taxi, which costed around 35 Euro.

Check-in and check-out time in the hotel took around 15 minutes.

36,OK choice for business at conference center,"We stayed here for 9 nights attending a conference next door.   If you are only attending a conference, then this is a good choice.  The pluses were: large mall across the street with many affordable and varied restaurant choices.  Also a very large grocery in mall for anything you might need.  The staff we encountered were all professional, friendly and eager to help.  The executive lounge came in handy for a quick breakfast and a place to relax in the afternoon or evening.  The lounge's deck was very nice with a great view of the ocea and city.  Our King room on the 21st floor was large, with lots of storage for two people.  Room decor could use an update.  Restaurant in the lobby was expensive, but the couple times we needed to eat there, the food was good.  Short walk to the ocean with large walking paths going all the way to the city center.  The walk will take over an hour.  In nice weather, it was very enjoyable.  This hotel is not close the city center and will require anywhere from an $8 - 25 euros taxi ride each way, depending on traffic and where you want to go.  Taxis are clean and plentiful.   There is a hop on and off tour bus stop very close by, which I recommed for a one/two day pass to see the city.",3,2018,11,03
36,Beutiful is a under statement.,"From arriving at the hotel to checking out the service was fantastic. Nothing was to much trouble for the staff. Full hot breakfast served with more than enough to go round. The rooms were clean as was the hotel areas.  

There is underground parking but the hotel does not reserve spaces and its not cheap, around 34 Euros a night. The ground floor bar is busy but again I feel the drinks were over priced.",5,2018,11,01
36,Absolutely fantastic!,"Staying here at the moment Day 2 of 3. What a wonderful hotel and absolutely fantastic staff.
We are on the 21st floor with a fab view of the city sky line.

The hotel is opposite the Diaganol Mar shopping centre. 2 minute walk. A fantastic Mall with a great choice of eateries,shops and a supermarket.

Stayed  over Halloween with my teenage daughter. Great atmosphere throughout the hotel.

We had executive lounge access as Diamond members. The chef prepared wonderful Halloween treats and cakes.

The breakfast was fantastic. Our room is amazing. It is luxuriously furnished in seaside tones with light furniture and a huge comfortable king size bed. We have both a bath tub and shower cubicle in our bathroom.

We have travelled all over the world and stayed in various Hilton hotels but have to give a huge thumbs up to this particular hotel. The staff have been amongst the best we have ever encountered in any Hilton world wide. The executive lounge is immaculate with fabulous food and drinks

The metro station is about a 7 minute walk away and we got to the main down town area in 15 minutes from there.

Fantastic location if visiting Barcelona. Fantastic staff and facilities. Ignore the negative reviews. This place is amazing:)

36,2nd stay was not that great.....,"I have to say, what a different ppl can make your stay feel. Last stay here 10 months ago where amazing, this time I would have to  say so-so mainly because of the front desk ppl during the check out. During the check-in, I had the nice German lady who speak great English, even though it took a while to check in & I have no idea why as it should be very fast mainly for a HH member. During the check out was a mess, they could not print my bill, can not even tell me the charges, and on top of that a rude front desk person (different lady than the day before).

I gave them average score for the service and treatment, but also my bathroom shower door was not opening... it was like glued. The plastic trim was preventing it from opening... 

The room was good & the breakfast too. 

I will come back again as I know this place was good before.",3,2018,10,31
36,Hilton beware,"The room was not up to par with the price. The bathroom was very dirty. The Jacuzzi tub, once filled up with water & turned on, a bunch of debris and hair came out of all that jets. The bathroom was in poor condition and was very disappointed with the overall experience and was told there’s nothing they could have done bc the hotel was full. ",1,2018,10,30
36,Nice Hotel Bad Service,"If you are American don't visit this hotel. They don't like us at the front desk... The style and quality is what one would expect from a Hilton Brand Hotel, but the front desk staff is rude and unhelpful. It's like a Hilton look with a motel level of staff... Not what you want when you are looking for a home away from home...",1,2018,10,30
36,Never again!!!!!,"What a mess in this lounge!! I am so upset now! No snacks, really nothing you get here! Only a very very dirty lounge! This is a shame Hilton!!!!!!😡😡😡😡😡 this hotel i book never again!!!! Too bad to waste my money for this stay!!",2,2018,10,29
36,Lovely executive suite,"We had 2 nights in a corner suite which was lovely and spacious. The only thing that needed improvement was that the walk in shower leaked due to there being a gap in the seal on its door.
The executive lounge was extremely busy which meant that they ran out of food and clean glasses.  It is the only lounge I have been in that allowed young children in too.
",4,2018,10,29
36,Second thoughts,"The hotel is close to a convention center which was the reason I was staying there. Although it is close to the sea, it is not exactly in the center of the city and its landmarks, which is what most  people come to Barcelona for. I assume that comes with a price discount.
The hotel itself is a typical big chain hotel with the standard level of luxury. The room is room is large and had 2 single beds. The bathroom had a shower and a tub. The toilet was a set behind a wall. The minibar was locked. I mentioned that at the reception and it was remotely unlocked for that day, finding it locked again on the n ext day ...
Cleaning was not top. The carpet had accumulate quite a bit of dust/sand and could do with a vacuum service.  The buffet breakfast had a lot of choice which stayed the same during my week's stay. Service was good. 
The bar is located in the lobby and although the menu shows that  they serve ""classic cocktails"", when asked it was not an available option. 
As a HH member, wifi was free but not very stable during peak hours. The desk is large and there are plenty of plugs for charging electric devices.
The hotel is worth a 4 but the service could have been better.",3,2018,10,29
36,"Some great views, poor experience","Hilton thinks of itself as a luxury brand but each time I try again and stay at a Hilton there are always small things that aren't quite right. Chipped paint, broken moulding, rude service (seemingly no matter what country). I don't find these things in competitors and I don't see why they should tolerate it at a Hilton. In any case, Barcelona was no exception: hordes of cruise tourists in the so-called ""executive lounge"",  cracked shower mouldings, rude waiters (including one who ""forgot"" to bring change - that one was actually funny in how unsubtle he was). 

On the positive side, the view was lovely of you are above the 17th floor seaside.

In the end, too expensive for what you get.",3,2018,10,28
36,Perfect business hotel for Barcelona.,"Perfect business hotel, good location, close to conference places. Nice view on seaside, close to metro and taxi stops. Breakfast was ok, executive breakfast on 15th floor bit limited, but good meeting place for during the day.",5,2018,10,28
36,"Excellent modern hotel, adjacent to Conference Centre, away from the city centre but good transport access","We have just spent 4 days at the Hilton Diagonal Mar hotel whilst attending a congress at the adjacent Conference Centre. The hotel is modern and comfortable. We had an Executive room on the 18th floor with sea view and access to the Executive Lounge. The views from the room were amazing with fantastic sunrises.  The room was spacious and the bed was comfortable. The bathroom was well equipped. The wi-fi is high speed and worked well throughout.

Reception was excellent upon arrival and service in the bar and restaurant was great. 

The breakfast buffet was extensive with many choices of hot and cold food and included freshly-squeezed orange juice amongst the choices of juices. There was also a good choice of bread types available. I would add that the fried eggs were fresh and not tired like in some hotels. They also have an omelette station.

Although the hotel is a bit away from the main city centre, this is an advantage as there is not the hustle and bustle of the Ramblas and Placa Catalunya on your doorstep, but the metro and bus services are fast and reliable and you can be in Placa Catalunya within 25 minutes – or even quicker if by taxi.",5,2018,10,26
36,"Great location, great experience!","I stayed for 7 nights at Hilton Diagonal Mar at Barcelona in Oct 2018, and it proved to be a great experience. The property is right next to the convention centre where I was having my meetings. It is about 30-40 min from the BCN airport.

Rooms are large-ish, and come fully equipped with twin beds,  a work table and a coffee maker. Mine had a good view of the sea. The bathroom is clean and has a bidet in addition to the WC. The 6 lifts make it reasonably fast to get to the room.

Breakfast had a good spread of local and international cuisine. The Internet was fast. Service was generally quick and pleasant.

One minor inconvenience that I faced was the towel rack that stood over the bathtub as  my head would repeatedly hit it while having a shower. Another issue was that the body lotion was kind of semi-solid, requiring quite some effort to get it out of the slippery bottle.

All said, I enjoyed my time at the Hilton Diagonal Mar.",5,2018,10,26
36,"Clean, new, sterile","The hotel was new, clean and we didn't have any problems with anything.  
Shopping mall across the street, fairly close to everything including an ocean view, but nothing stood out.  
Nothing made it memorable.",4,2018,10,25
36,"Nice place, good service","We enjoyed our stay in this hotel a few weeks back.  Good service from a solid staff, spacious, clean rooms and a nice gym.  Slightly removed from downtown, but it's a huge city so not that crazy.  We'd definitely come back.",5,2018,10,23
36,Sea view was awesome,"The Sea view room is very nice. Beds were very comfy and rooms clean. Breakfast buffet is above average and the staff was exceptional and friendly. Executive room was one of the best I have experienced. Super view, above average food and drinks.  Beach access is hard to beat and a mall across the street. Only down side is location from Las Ramblas/Old town.",4,2018,10,23
36,"Solid stay, large room, suboptimal location","We stayed here after our cruise ended in Barcelona. It is a nice property, with modern decor. The room was spacious, with decent views. The main drawback was that it was a fairly long taxi ride from the major tourist sites and the travel back and forth got old after awhile. Also the pool area was less for family and seemed more designed to be a club scene with constant oontz oontz oontz music playing.",4,2018,10,21
36,"Friendly staff, mediocre service, tired room.","So far this hotel has definitely been underwhelming.

This hotel is relatively far away from central Barcelona, the Gothic district, and sights like the Basilica Segrada Familia.  Be aware that if you want to see these places it is a taxi or public transit ride away.  That said, there is a decent sized mall across the street if required and there is a nice part of the beach only a few hundred metres away.  The neighbourhood is safe, if somewhat boring.

The good:
The gym is decent, enough modern equipment to suffice, including one high end spin bike in addition to the usual Life brand cardio equipment.  The room is on the smallish side, but adequate.  
Internet seems decent quality and speed in all areas of the hotel and public spaces.
All staff members I have engaged with have been friendly.

The not so good:
Only the lobby bar/restaurant seems to be open at all times, so selection is very limited.  It is a pretty generic space and not very big.  Its definitely not the kind of space you want to hang out in.  
The room - on the small size, king bed pretty much fills the space.  Lighting in the bathroom was dim, the mirror lights didn't work due to a faulty switch.  Staff sent an ""engineer"" to fix it.  Sort of works not if you press it a few times and jiggle it:=(  
Shower temperature is all over the place.  With handle in a set position the temp ranges from cold to burn-your-skin hot.  Speaking to the front desk they were obviously aware of this issue, which seems to happen in ""some rooms"".  An engineer was sent.  Problem is not resolved, but somewhat mitigated, now only cylces from somewhat cool to uncomfortably warm.  Makes for short showers.
Ordered room service.  Wait time for a club sandwich was 50 minutes.  A club sandwich - 50 minutes!  And 30 euro!
At the bar, draft Heineken is 9 euro.  That is egregious for a generic beer in a generic space (and there is no other choice).  
The best I can say is its not terrible, but you could do a lot better.",2,2018,10,20
36,Great hotel Delightful staff,"I stayed 3 nights at tjis delightful hotel and was fortunate enough to get an upgrade to a room on 23rd floor. Amazing views. I would heartily recommend this hotel. Great rooms and very courteous staff in all areas.

Three little niggles

1. The Executive Lounge needs to be serviced during the day. Every.afternoon the coffee machines had milk and one did not work at all

2. On one day I returned to the room at 4pm having left at 10.00 am and it had not been service. Housekeeping arrived at 4.30.

3. I reported on Saturday the bathroom mirror  light did not work. Reception assuredme it would be fixed. It still wasn't when I checked in Monday.

Small things and it did not spoil my stay.",5,2018,10,15
36,Exquisite service!,"Beautiful hotel in very good location, but the best part is the service. I have no words to describe the courtesy and the perfect service provided by Ricardo. Every morning it has been a pleasure to receive such a warm good morning during breakfast, not to mention how nice and helpful he has been. I have seen him going to every and each table everyday to check if any guest needed something or simply to greet us personally. Thank you Ricardo for such a wonderful service!!",5,2018,10,14
36,Lovely,"The rooms are great and the facilities are brilliant. Very family friendly and the staff are so nice. Only downside is price of drinks, especially by the pool... 10eur for a small beer is crazy. Nice location but a bit far from the center of Barcelona especially with kids. Taxis were a must. ",4,2018,10,12
36,Predictable Hilton Experience,"I stayed here for 5 nights (4+1).
Reception was good and efficient.
Very impersonal and corporate atmosphere, like most Hilton Hotels.
The rooms are very spacious, with great bathrooms.
Breakfast was good.
I could leave my luggage for 4 days, as I interrupted my stay.
Location is very good.
The Hilton Barra Rio de Janeiro, is still the gold standard Hilton for me [5/5]. 
",4,2018,10,12
36,Pleasant except for shower,"Overall another pleasant stay in the Hilton hotel. Nice, modern rooms, spacious bathroom with bath tub and extra shower. Good facilities and machines within the fitness room. The only surprise: the water temperature during my shower kept on changing from cold to a very hot back-and-forth. No pattern that I could understand. If I try to adjust the temperature, It changed. But also when I left they handed in one place for 10 minutes I had at least 10 different temperature waves from hot to cold. Was on the 14th floor. During checkout told a person and he made a phone call in Spanish that I could not understand. But I sure hope for future guests that this gets fixed",4,2018,10,11
36,fantastic experience from start to finish,"after contacting the hotel we were upgraded to an exec room for a reasonable charge
so glad we did as it was great to have tea coffee etc if weather clouded over during the day. the happy hour food and drink was superb and saved us a fortune
all the staff were helpful and room was beautiful

we were another group that were concerned about the pool area but I can honestly say it was fantastic and the staff there were helpful
music is obviously a personal thing but we found it ok 

will definitely be back",5,2018,10,11
36,"Poor Service, Great Pool and Breakfast","Extremely poor service. Very late formal check-in time (4 PM) with no effort whatsoever to get our room before. No gold member upgrade even though we had a special occasion, because they claimed no availability of the higher room, but it was available all day for reservation. People at front desk extremely unfriendly. On the good side: Hotel facility is nice, nice pool, and breakfast was superb. But the service is the worse I ever experienced at a Hilton",2,2018,10,10
36,Good Points and Bad Points,"Great location, the bedrooms are excellent as is the buffet breakfast which though inevitably crowded is always well stocked. However the reception staff aren't very welcoming and the situation at the pool where at times you can't get a poolside sunbed unless you pay extra is ridiculous.",3,2018,10,08
36,Nice hotel,"My daughter and I, stayed at this hotel for 4 nights from 28/10/18.
I must state the hotel was as described in their web page and if anything, even closer to amenities such as the beach, transport links  and shops. It was honestly less than a five minute walk to both the beach and red tour bus stop, which is a must when visiting Barcelona. 
The hotel itself is a typical Hilton and we stayed in a twin executive room, which was clean and well equipped. The room itself was also quite spacious and could uncomfortably fitted another bed in if required.
The executive lounge was excellent with a vast selection of drinks and food. Normally this is nibbles but in this hotel, it was an open selection of hot and cold dishes including Tapas, fish, kebabs and even a curried dish on one of the evenings. 
Upon reading previous reviews, I was a little apprehensive about using the pool area. I must state that we used the pool area several times and never felt any animosity due to only being guests and not paying. We were always warmly greeted by the pool area staff, who were as pleasant and welcoming, as all other staff within this hotel.
To conclude,
I was very pleased with all aspects of this hotel and would certainly return. 
All the staff we encountered were extremely pleasant and this is especially true to those who were assisting with breakfast upon the second floor.
The food and drink selection within the executive lounge was excellent and the breakfast within the restaurant was to the normal Hilton standard.",5,2018,10,08
36,Amenity Rich,"Our stay fit the typical upper-class Hilton stay.  The staff was friendly and abundant, which took away from the personal touch, but it was made up for in accommodation. The hotel was finished nicely and everyone was quite helpful.  I was most impressed by the restaurant staff who continually went out of their way to make sure we were always happy with our food and drinks. The pool area and bar is excellent, although it closing at 6pm was a bit early.  Nice and close to the beach and only a short walk from the metro, which made everything in the city easily accessible.

Huge thank you to Tiziano in the restaurant for making us feel that personal touch we seek out when we travel!  You’re a strong reason for our great experience.",5,2018,10,07
36,Nice hotel,"The hotel accommodations are very nice.  Everything is great except for the food. I would give that a 3. In addition, there is a limited midnight menu. Luckily, there is a mall right across the street.  The hotel is in a perfect location and taxi's are located right down the street.  The hop on hop off bus route stop is also located about a block away.  I will stay here again, but not eat the food. I is close to the cruise ship port, making it a great location to stay prior to boarding a cruise.",4,2018,10,05
36,Brilliant Hotel - Great location,"Fantastic hotel, can't fault any of it. Only a 10 minute taxi into teh main tourist areas (Las Ramblas) and on teh Green line of the Tour Bus. Can not fault any aspect of this hotel, will definitely stay here again",5,2018,10,03
36,Perfect business and conference location,"Spent 4 nights in this hotel during PI World Barcelona 2018. Located at 12th floor with a sea view, the morning sunrise view was perfect. Had some issues regarding a missing reservation, which was sorted out quickly. Nice staff and clean rooms. Puro beach pool area on second floor was open to conference participants. A great and big area with pool and bar. A small drawback are the elevators. They are quite nice, however at peak hours you will have to wait some time to get one. Will defenitely come back next time in Barcelona.",4,2018,10,03
36,"STAY AWAY ! STAFF ARE THIEVES, POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE","Whilst holidaying in Barcelona my husband and i and another couple decided to go to the purobeach pool at the Hilton hotel diagonal mar. We went there a) because they have a large pool with plenty of space B) It was going to be safe and secure being at the Hilton a 5* hotel C)We were after food/beverage service.
When we arrived we had to pay 70€ approx $115 AUD that got us a sunbed by the pool.
We had paid and sat as my husband went to the pool I was left sitting on the sunbed with my handbag to the right of me, as i spoke to my girlfriend who was to the left i went to grab my phone ( that was in my handbag ) to realise that it was no longer there. I got up and started to check around and under me and was unable to find it.I quickly informed the staff who was practically ignoring me they were unable to help me.They did not let me check the survillance they took there sweet time to assist me and on top of all that the only person that had come close to me while i was talking to my friend was the waitress. My girlfriend facing me could clearly see that no one else had come close. I asked to speak to the manager and she refused to be of any assistance she was just shooing me to go to the police station, she lied and told me that there was no cameras and nothing she could do. In my hand bag i had my phone my bank cards , money and a few little other valuables. After half an hour of going back and forth we got no where. I had staff laughing and ignoring us. I had the manager telling me there was nothing they could do. So we decided to leave on our way out i asked to speak to the hotel manager. i informed her about what happened by the pool she at the start was very helpful asked me for information reassured me that there was definetly cameras as it is a public pool and they do host events there from time to time.. She was polite and asked me to take a seat while she checked the cameras to help me locate who stole my hand bag. As time passed she came back out and her tone and attitude had changed she informed me that she couldn't see anything at all and there was nothing she can do and told me it was best to just go to the police station and make a claim through insurance ? 
Wow i thought funny how she went from being helpful to so dismissive. This confirms that it was indeed the staff and she didn't want to confirm it she then became rude and short and asked us to leave. I was left with out any cards, cash, phone and handbag during my holiday due to shifty,unprofessional,careless pool/hotel staff. All they had to do was check the cameras track down the person and refuse them from leaving unless checking there bags. But in saying that there is no free access i highly doubt someone would come in pay 70 euros to rob someone else.",1,2018,10,03
36,Enjoyable stay in Barcelona by the Sea.,Nice location by the sea but not too far from the city center. My room had great views of the Sea. The folks at the front desk were very helpful especially with an early check-in and helping plan local sight seeing. The room was reasonable and the breakfast in the restaurant were good. Overall the stay was great.,5,2018,10,02
36,Great rooms and fantastic breakfast ,"I visited here in business last week.
All in all, a decent stay.
Well sized room with all the facilities you need. I always need an iron/ironing board and they were there.
Breakfast was great. Great selection of cooked and cold items. Orange juice is freshly squeezed and the coffee was bean to cup machine.

Only thing that stops it being a 5 star review was the attitude of one of the desk staff. He didn't want to give out bottles of water despite the others doing so.

Tip: The gym on level 2 has a water machine so head there if needed. ",4,2018,10,02
36,Wonderful!,"I can’t recommend enough this hotel! The reception desk are very nice, friendly and helpful people (Laura - thank you!) 
The hotel has been recently renovated so everything is fresh and clean. The rooms are well decorated. The views are amazing- if you can - book an executive room - it is so worth it! Both city view and sea view are amazing. 
Excellent breakfast, Hilton quality. Very nice pool area.
Location- it’s next to the beach, so quiet area, but with transport/uber you are at the city center very quickly and cheap.
Overall- we can’t wait to come again!",5,2018,10,02
36,"A Quality hotel, and a thoroughly enjoyable Stay","We stayed here on a weekend break in Barcelona and thoroughly enjoyed the hotel. We are Hilton honors members and always stay in hiltons where possible. This one was as good if not better than any we have stayed in. Check in was seemless althought we did have to wait a bit for the room to be ready. It was not a problem as the bar was very accomadinting. The room was very clean, service was excellent. The consierge girl was particulary nice and very helpfull in recommending/booking trips & resturants. The breakfast buffett was particularly good with ample choice and Gluten free options were available if required. Location is out of the main town but very close to the underground and Bus tour stops which was very convienent.  
We would definatly stay there again.",5,2018,10,02

After leaving a review last month and 3 phone calls to the property - my deposit of €250 has still not been returned to me. Nothing has been offered to compensate me either for this. I'm not calling or contacting the property again. 

I gave them my bank details and I was asked for more details all of which can be looked up online. Complete laziness and unwillingness of anyone there to help get my money back.",1,2018,09,28
36,Poor service level,"There was No bottle of water in the room, and the fridge was closed, so it was impossible to open it. I’m Hilton honors members and this is not reflecting the usual service level. So I’m very disappointed. In addition when I mentioned this issue during the checkout, the front desk person seems to didn’t care about my complain.",1,2018,09,26
36,Good location near subway,"We stayed here for pre-night cruise and the location was good as we wanted to take the subway to a lot of places. Front desk was very helpful. This is a very busy hotel it seems. The buffet was a bit pricey, therefore we opted to eat outside of the hotel.",5,2018,09,26
36,Hotel equipment goes terribly wrong .,I’m in Europe for the first time on 9/7/18 prior too my departure of my 7 day cruise alone. I’m in the bathroom getting ready til I felt water on my feet and not paying attention the water is dripping faster and all of sudden water is pouring out the side of the wall and next I slip in fall on the floor. Too shorten this long story I made a report with the manager and the cause was ac Condensation was blocked and that was the cause of the leaking. Now I’m back in the states and no one has reached out too me at all about this matter and too make matters worse everyday my foot was swollen on my cruise and I feel like I need a do over vacation from my vacation.,1,2018,09,26

Nice view also from the Lounge.",4,2018,09,26
36,Perfect For Diamond Level,"This hotel was a perfect choice for our visit to barcelona,  and will be our choice in future visits.   The location was a very short trip to anything we wanted to get to.   In addition,  our diamond status provided us with access to an exceptional executive lounge providing more then what we needed for both breakfast and dinner,  leaving us focusing on lunch as our big eating out event each day.   In addition, the level of service provided by the staff was outstanding,  especially Georgiana's help in getting us into a room as soon as possible after our exceptionally early arrival the first morning, providing us with access to the lounge in dinner for breakfast.   This will remain our first choice in this beautiful city. 
",5,2018,09,24
36,Loved our stay!,"Stayed here for 2nights before a cruise, Barcelona is a fantastic city and coming back to the Hilton each night was refreshing. The rooms are very big and spacious, the location is close to train, metro,bus and cabs with a shopping mall 1 block away and various restaurants within walking distance. The front desk staff are also very helpful, on the day we arrived it was 8am we thought we would have to wait hours before being able to settle into our room but the staff managed to get us into our room straight away! We needed that after a 16hr flight!!  The Buffet breakfast was also very good and had a wide selection of various food.",5,2018,09,22
36,After cruise stay,Staff very friendly and helpful.  The breakfast buffet was exceptional for the selection and quality of food offered. Rooms very clean and quiet.  Overall a wonderful experience and we look forward to returning on our next trip.,5,2018,09,21
36,Very good choice,"Super nice hotel in Barcelona. As a Diamond member I had a beautifull big corner suite. Rooms are clean, big and confortable. Nice gym, great and fun pool ( open to the public, 2 nd row of chairs is for hotel guests).
Good restaurants, good service as well and nice vip lounge.
Great location, close but not too much to the exciting Barcelona center and crowded beaches.
Great option for Barcelona",4,2018,09,21
36,Perfect Barcelona Hotel,"I love this hotel.  The rooms are large and clean with great views of the Mediterranean Sea.  The dining room on the 1st floor for breakfast has a generous buffet and attentive servers (with lots of coffee).  The executive lounge with an outdoor terrace overlooking the sea is a great experience.  Indeed the executive lounge is worthy of several comments, because (1) the view is great, (2) the food and wine offerings are extensive and (3) the woman who greets you  upon entry has extensive knowledge of Barcelona tourist sites and gives helpful advice.

I highly recommend this property, because it is outside the noise and hassle of the tourist areas.  It is extremely convenient and easy to catch a tram or metro to anywhere in Barcelona.  The hotel is located in an area of town that feels safe and clean.  It was a beautiful experience.",5,2018,09,20
36,Hilton Quality!,"Great location, close to the beach, in front of shopping center with many restuarants.
We booked a corner executive room, was nice,very clean, king size bed, only i find the bedroom a bit small but the rest absolute fine!
The breakfast is very complete and the stuff also friendly.
We will come back for sure!
At the front desk the girls are not friendly :( for this i do not give 5*.",4,2018,09,19
36,Outstanding Hotel,"One of the best Hilton hotels I have experienced.  A short walk to the beach and mall.  Very modern neighborhood.  If you are looking for the charm of old historic Barcelona, this hotel is not for you.  Room was a large American-style set-up.  Bathroom large, with full marble, large vanity, separate shower stall and tub.  In-room coffee offered both regular and decaf.  Great fitness center, and the pool/pool bar is more of a club that is spectacular.  Great place to hang out for the day.  I did not experience the restaurant as my stay was short.  Very friendly staff at the desk and bell staf.",5,2018,09,18
36,Excellent stay,"I am a diamond member with Hilton,the highest level of frequent guest program. Everything was superb and minor errors were well corrected. Thank you for everything. food and service was lovely and i hope to come back",5,2018,09,18
36,Excellent hotel near the Mediterranean Beach,Thus modern hotel is two blocks from a beautiful beach.  Rooms are attractive and ample in size.  Concierge is very helpful.  We chose the rate which included a bountiful buffet breakfast.  Pool and fitness facilities included.,5,2018,09,17
36,Great hotel but poor service,"It's a nice hotel with pretty good breakfast and a nice view if you have the right room.
The pool area ist great and the restaurant puro beach has good food and vibes.
However the service at the reception is very poor. ",4,2018,09,17
36,Amazing stay in an amazing hotel ,What a fantastic hotel ! The rooms here were lovely and clean and very spacious. We had a good view of the sea / the pool. The beds were extremely comfortable. There is a lot of space for clothes - great if like me and you like to over pack ! The food at breakfast was good - each day there was a different thing on offer such a doughnuts or buck fizzes. Delicious. The man at the bar (didn’t catch his name) was so fantastic. He remembered our orders and what we liked. He was friendly and jokey - a perfect host. The pool is very lovely - very trendy. Nice music playing and fruit / drinks. Perfect. Literally waited on hand and foot. Would definitely come back and would recommend to anyone. ,5,2018,09,16
36,Wonderful Hilton property,Great property- good location and excellent modernfacilities.  rooms are beautiful.  All staff was very friendly.  Allowed to check in early as room was available.  Executive floor had rooftop outdoor balcony which had breakfast and evening wine and snacks available.  One of the nicer setups experienced at Hilton,5,2018,09,14
36,Corporate meeting for 3 nights ,"Hotel very good. Clean, spacious and attractive. Bar staff in lobby bar super but drinks are pricey!

The food served for us was plentiful, but utterly disgusting! It was hard to work out some days what the food actually was! We were all excited in day 3 by pasta and vegetables! This really needs to be looked at. It wasn’t for the want of trying or lack of food.. it was just disgusting! We all agreed and from many different nations so wasn’t just a particular palate! 

",3,2018,09,14
36,Excellent Hotel highly recommend,"We have just returned from a 4 day trip to Barcelona and thankfully stayed at the Hilton Diagonal - I stay at lots of Hilton and Hampton hotels and this is by far the best one I have stayed at. The rooms are massive even standard rooms, the bed is the most comfortable we have ever had.
Breakfast was again a high quality with the staff coming around with there recommendations which ranged from smoothies to champagne & orange juice, we sat outside on the balcony every day.
The pool area is like something from Ibiza (Kisstory) and free for hotel guests, and you are no more than 5 mins from the beach.
Shopping centre is next door with a range of restaurants and shops, the Metro is the other side of the centre and the hop on hop off buses stop just outside the hotel. Would recommend them to see all that Barcelona has to offer.
Suitcases were looked after by the reception team on last day - was offered to have the room till 3pm but they requested an extra £60 for this which I declined. If you did need a shower before you leave the pool area has secure changing rooms and showers you can use.
If we go back to Barcelona we will defiantly be staying at the Hilton Diagonal Mar",5,2018,09,12
36,Very good hotel,Stayed one night after a cruise which ended in Barcelona. Very nice rooms and friendly staff. Executive lounge was well stocked and the food and drink choices were varied and flavorful. The Diagonal Mar shopping center is across the street with many choices for shopping and eating.,4,2018,09,11
36,Very nice hotel and great location,"We loved this hotel

The rooms were well laid out and modern in style

The staff were friendly and welcoming. I do think some training needs to be done when computers crash as it seemed the world was crashing when it occurred

The lounge has nice food and wine although most days were full of children and noise was an issue due to parents allowing children to run around the lounge. Again staff training is needed here

I would still highly recommend this hotel. The breakfast was fantastic and again all staff couldn’t do enough to help

The location is perfect. A short walk to the beach and about 15 min by underground to the old town of Barcelona

The pool area is like a modern beach club which is great fun and very appealing. 

The gym was large and had every thing needed

The area is quiet and across the street is a large shopping centre

Taxis are straight in front of the hotel making travel easy and the underground is a 7 min walk

We will definitely return here",5,2018,09,11
36,Great Hotel,"The hotel is lovely with nice views of the city and the sea.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  Although on the map the location may look a bit out of the city, the taxis are easily available, and the hop-on-hop-off buses have stops right by the hotel.  We were overall happy with the location and the hotel, and we would recommend it as a location for your stay in Barfcelona.  ",4,2018,09,09
36,"friendly and clean, close enough to get into old town by tube easily","A always friendly, clean and helpful staff. A bit busy around the pool and very loud music like on a beach party. If you are looking for peace and quiet at the pool its the wrong place.  It would have been nice to be able  borrow some beach towels for the beach. This service let us down and felt a bit disappointed.",3,2018,09,07
36,Pre- Cruise Hotel,We were booked into this Hotel by Celebrity for one night prior to our embarkation. Hotel was excellent! People were very friendly and spoke English which helped. Good location near beach and Mall across the street. Breakfast buffet that was included was amazing. Rooms were clean and comfortable. Roof top bar was expensive but had a great view on a beautiful evening. ,5,2018,09,05
36,Wowww effect post refurbishment,"I am back to Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona after 4 years and finally, the hotel is back to Hilton quality. Yovani S.T. (Front Of House Manager) helped me to make my stay memorable. As HH Diamond, a Suite was allocated for my stay with the sea view from where I was able to enjoy the view whilst working. The rooms are fully renovated with style and see ambience, beds are super comfy and the air conditioning silent but super efficient. Executive lounge fully renovated as well as ensure a much better experience. I was then simply surprised about the swimming pool area powered by Purobeach: you can relax, chill out or party with great cocktails and champagne, food, of course, is available. Thank you again to all team: extremely professional and helpful. Well done to Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona: the new management really makes a difference",5,2018,09,05
36,not enough staff and elevators!,"We traveled with our kids ages 9 and 12 and got 2 connecting rooms. The rooms are clean and spacious. The hotel is located by the water however the metro is 10 min walk and you can explore all of Barcelona easily. The metro's are clean and have AC, buy T-10 pass which the hole family can use for 10 trips. The hotel has a great pool, which the boys loved. Now for the shortage of staff: when we arrived at 3 pm there was only ONE person at the desk helping. We had to wait at least 30-40 mints before she got to us. The guest services desk was empty and no one works it on Thursdays! and if they actually do work they work 9 am to 4 pm! so if you need dinner recommendations you better ask during that time. there is only 4 elevators for the entire hotel that has 20 floors and there is an average of 10-15 min wait for the elevator, and once the elevator actually arrives its always full.",2,2018,09,03
36,Great experience ,"You won’t be disappointed in this Hilton. My only complaint is that the elevator would take a while during rush hours (like breakfast, dinner). 

The pool area is beautiful and it’s a walking distance from the beach. 

My favorite part was the breakfast buffet in the mornings. By far the best hotel buffet I’ve been to. The Iberian Jamón was always fresh! I ate a lot of that every morning, paired with a variety of cheeses the Hilton offered. The staff was even better than the food. 

Definitely coming back for our honeymoon",5,2018,09,02
36,An average property with some broken facilities and additional charges for Purobeach,"At high-occupancy the property has waiting times for lifts, front-desk and the restaurant. We also experienced problems with broken facilities in our room. Furthermore I dislike the add-on charges for the better beds in Purobeach as I don't feel that this should be a feature of third-parties at properties - these charges should be rolled into the contract between Hilton and other parties as a minor increase in user charges. Frustratingly many of these beds went unused every day. ",2,2018,09,02
36,"Spacious rooms (for Europe), clean and modern hotel with excellent breakfast","My family of 10 booked three rooms here in August. We had a cruise that left from Barcelona and wanted to spend a few days enjoying the city first. My husband and I have been to Barcelona 9 times between us so we were familiar with the city. I like that this location is out of most of the hustle bustle of the city. It's quiet but not far from attractions and everything else. I found the rooms to be very clean, modern and quite spacious for Europe. The ""family room"" size accommodated two families of four in our party with room to spread out. 

Our family enjoyed lounging by the pool, it felt like an oasis in the city. Taxis line up right outside so getting a cab is a snap. There is a very nice mall across the street with Starbucks, tons of casual restaurants and a large supermarket in the basement level. We got the hop-on-hop off tourist bus (Barcelona Turistica) a few minutes walk from the hotel - it's the green line and an easy switch at Port Olympico to the red line which takes you to the heart of the city including the Barri Gotic. The breakfast had plentiful options and was very well done. 

The only small negative I encountered is that we usually had to wait several minutes for the elevators and the elevators have no ventilation or air conditioning. 

Note: This is not the only Hilton in the city so be sure you communicate the address to your taxi driver and announce ""Hilton Diagonal Mar"" and present the address. Diagonal is a very long street that cuts across Barcelona and I recall there was another Hilton on this street.

I will happily stay at Hilton Diagonal Mar on my next visit to Barcelona.",5,2018,09,01
36,A wonderful place to stay,"The Hilton is located in a newer part of Barcelona across from a large shopping center, and only a block from the Mediterranean beaches. It is also a wonderful piece of architecture. The subway stops nearby, so it is pretty simple to get to all the big tourist sites. 
The room was not large, but it was very well designed and very comfortable, with a well laid out bathroom and plenty of toiletries. Because the mattress was reasonable and the pillows comfortable, we were actually able to sleep - something that eluded us in many Spanish hotels. 
The views were lovely, and we were on a lower floor! It would be better if there were a rooftop terrace with a panorama, but there is a pool and bar on a lower level that is quite nice. 
The breakfast was exceptional, even by the lavish standards that have been developed in Spanish hotels.",5,2018,08,31
36,Barcelona Paradise,"Superior amenities for those who want to really relax and enjoy their vacation.  The pool facilities are over the top, executive lounge is great, excellent breakfast, top notch service and excellent location, strategically located near the beach, area restaurants and local transportation.",5,2018,08,31
36,Better than expected,Holding a meeting for 220 persons for 3 days. And everything went very smooth thanks to the fantastic staff. Always ready to help and fast. Rooms were very modern and fresh. Meeting rooms worked very well. For the restaurant the staff were very helpful and fast. No problem although we changed timings for the breaks several time. Fantastic dinner by the pool at Puro beach was the highlight. Thanks to Marcus and his team!!,5,2018,08,30
36,Great Hotel - Great Service - Don't Hesitate to book!,"To be honest I was reading the reviews right before we left on our trip and I was worried.  Not sure why it was getting some bad reviews because our stay was really great.  From the time we checked on Friday at 5:30 pm to the time we checked out on Monday at 8:30 am all of the employees could not have been nicer.  We stayed on the 20th floor city side and the view was beautiful.  The walk to the beach was less than 5 mins and very easy.  The executive lounge was always stocked with great breakfast and appetizers, the staff there was amazing, they were super friendly and helpful.  We did not use the pool, so I can not comment on that.  As far as the room, all I can say about that is wow!!  Thanks to everyone at this hotel who made our stay enjoyable.",5,2018,08,30
36,Current stay,"We are already spending our holiday at this hotel. Advantages: really good breakfast, good localization. 
Disadvantages: (for us the most important, because of that we will never come here again) hotel guests must pay for sun-beds

We stay here almost two weeks in suite so we pay not so little and hotel wants to charge for sun-beds!!!  Sorry but I would rather spend that in the hotel bar!!! 

I include sun-beds for free in “Hilton” hotel.
Defeat",1,2018,08,30
36,Diagonal to go straight to the beach,"
This modern hotel is located in the newly developed area of Barcelona. 

Best for an urban escapade with the beaches at a 10mn walk and within 12 mn from the center by taxi. The taxis are available 30 meters from the hotel on your left when exiting.

There is a nice area around the pool  - open to a high end public who pays a substantial amount to stay around the said pool! And the lounge music is loud! A trendy place for locals and tourists.

Residents have a choice between a cost-free area off the swimming pool or a discount for the prime (expensive) locations around the pool. 

Yes, this would be a « minus », the other one being the price of still water in the fridge at EUR 5.50!

Apart from that, all is fine, rooms are spacy and there is plenty of storage space.

If you go for the Executive rooms, the lounge on the 15th floor will welcome you for your included breakfast and free flow of drinks and finger food from 6 to 8pm. 

The view is also wonderful and so is the friendly and dedicated service!
",4,2018,08,29
36,Great stay,"We booked a seaview room and was very happy with the room. We didn't eat at the hotel, so I dont know what the food was like.

The hotel is located close to the beach, but a bit outside the city center. There is a big mall across the road, so getting food there is no problem. I also recomend visiting the beach, it is just a few minutes walk from the hotel.

Getting to the city was no problem, there are busses, trams and subways just a few minutes from the hotel. Getting to the city takes about 20 minutes. 

All in all I found the staff friendly and helpful, and the location was perfect for us.",4,2018,08,28
36,"Great hotel, perfect for summer","My experience at this hotel was really good. The room is big, clean and with a nice view. The breakfast is awesome. And the pool is majestic... kind of expensive but is understandable I think that a lot of people wants to visit this pool during summer in a city like Barcelona. 
Walking distance to the beach, mall and parks. 
My only complain would be a stranger aroma at the hallway, specially after 3:00 PM, but besides that everything was good   ",5,2018,08,27
36,Disappointing on many many levels,This was our first stay in a Hilton hotel and it will certainly be our last sadly. The was nice and the room was amazing with a great bathroom. The hotel is situated right next to a new shopping centre and 10 minutes from a beach. It is however an hours walk from the city centre which is far from ideal. One of the main downfalls were the pool setup - you need to pay extra (30EUR per day for a half decent sun bed)! There are free versions for Hilton guests but these are pushed right back and under wooden beams (so are in the shade). Poolside drinks START from around €15 and food begins from €20. The Hilton room service prices and bar prices are even worse. A ham toastie delivered to your room will set you back around €25 and it’s absolutely ridiculous. Staff were ok? Disappointing to ask them to book us a taxi the day before for our 4am check out but then to walk down and nothing planned. Was told to just walk out in the pitch black 200m to a taxi rank...,2,2018,08,27
36,Nice stay,"We were for ESHRE meeting in Barcelona..The hotel was very close to the place where the conference was held.
It is very close to the seashore.There is a huge shoppingmall just across the street.The rooms are very spacious and clean.Breakfast was very good.I have to mention that the waiters were very attentive.It is 5-6 minutes drive to the historic Barcelona center.. ",5,2018,08,26
36,"Beautiful Hotel, But Overpriced Bougie Pool Area","This is a beautiful Hilton that is 2 blocks from a Plajat LLevant, a nice beach.  The location is great if you want to be near a beach; however, the beach is also near the shipping port. I was only at this hotel one day; however, I have to beleive Barcelona has better beaches. Amazing Executive Lounge. Forget using the Pool Puro beach as it is overpriced, casually affected and thinks it is all that and a bag of ships.  Not worth the money and even if you are a Hilton guest, you have to pay for the pool which as I said is way overpriced!! We may stay at a Air BNB next time if we go to a better beach. The Hilton Diagonal is better situated to the sites in the city than this hotel. This hotel is gorgeous, but you will pay for it.",3,2018,08,26
36,Perfect hotel in great beach location,"If you want a beach holiday in Barcelona, stay this side of town.  This hotel is just a 10 minute walk from the beach.  It made much more sense to get clean from the beach via a quick walk back to the hotel, and then catch the tube into the centre on Barcelona (El Maresme Forum to Jaume.)  Only 10/12 minute journey.  Hotel amazingly clean, with great service from staff.  Couldn't have asked for me. Great size rooms too.",5,2018,08,26
36,Could easily be 5/5 but misses. ,"It’s a Hilton in Barcelona. Great spot near the beach and across from a huge mall. 
Building is the usual modern glass set up. 
Room is large and well equipped with hairdryer, iron, lots of storage, bath and great shower. 
So far so good. 
It is let down by minor but annoying things:

The lifts, there are x4, take a long time to arrive and to take you to your floor. I resorted to stairs many times in my four day visit. 

The pool charges for beds €30 or even a €500 minimum bar spend. 

You’ll pay €11 for a small beer. €5.50 for a small water in your room. 

The room key may fail from time to time.  

Reception on check in is slow. 

Your room may not be ready until 5 pm. 

A few minor improvements and this is s great hotel. 

But it isn’t there yet. 

Breakfast? It’s great. But it’s also €27. 

",3,2018,08,25
36,A favourite!,"Probably one of the best Hiltons we have stayed at, offering beautiful views of the sea and pool. The rooms are very spacious, bright and modern. The best thing about our trip was PuroBeach, such a chilled vibe with great ibiza styled music and amazing atmosphere, we were very sad to leave!

The breakfast was delicious, I was surprised at the variety to choose from. It’s located by the beach but not in the heart of the city centre. Over 1 hour walking distance or 12 euro for a taxi one way. Not ideal if you are wishing to stay in the city centre.",5,2018,08,25
36,Not to Hilton Standard!,"In opening I would strongly avoid this hotel, there are simply much better options out there - don’t be swayed by the Hilton name - it does not meet the Hilton standard.
Normally I’d write a more scathing review but I’m so horribly disappointed it’s easier to list my issues. This list is not exhaustive.

1.  Check in was 4pm but our room wasn’t ready until 7pm! No apologies, no offer of a free drink at the bar, not even a complimentary bottle of water in the room!
Is this a Hilton or a Motel 6?!

2. Elevators - nearly the entirety of this review was written as I waited for an elevator this morning - 12 minutes!! (Not an exaggeration). The 4 elevators don’t have the capacity for the number of rooms.

3. The pool - if you want a relaxing day by the pool or have kids, look elsewhere. Firstly they sting you €20 to sit on a lounger, secondly they have techno music blaring incredibly loudly - it’s like a poor man’s Ibiza - except they charge you crazy money for a drink (price list for wine attached as a photo) - but €150 for a bottle of Möet - is a good indicator (look I’m all for a bit of markup - but really?). The pool is suitable if you’re trying to get some sweet Instagram photos for your social media following (I say this based on this is what everyone seems to be doing in the pool, probably because they can’t afford a drink).

4. If the constant sound of running water puts you to sleep, you’ve come to the right place. I’m not sure if it’s the toilets or showers, but you’ll hear it all night.

5. We knew this before booking but, location wise this is not the best, whilst close to the beach - the beach is more for reenacting Christopher Nolan’s Normandy than swimming. But more pleasant than the pool (less instagramming though). The better beaches are further away.

6. Breakfast looked reasonable but we avoided because ain’t nobody got time to fight the masses for €27ea for breakfast..:which probably explains why half the guests eat across the road in the mall!

Anyway my advice is stay somewhere else and don’t be swayed because it’s a Hilton (see all the reviews by disgruntled Diamond members)
",2,2018,08,25
36,Literally a life saver,"The hotel itself is lovely with a great pool area and excellent food just a block from the beach and very lively. For us, however, the hotel proved its mettle in the manner they assisted us when my wife became ill and was taken to a local hospital. Because of her illness we missed our cruise ships embarkation and had to remain 2 additional nights then were planned. The staff arranged for us to stay in the same room ( although the hotel was packed), procured a doctor within minutes of our requesting one, and even arranged a taxi ride home from the hospital when it seemed like we would be stranded. The staff could not have been more supportive and turned a horrible situation into a manageable one. We will always have a special feeling for this hotel!!",5,2018,08,23
36,Great Hotel - Location a Bit Far,"Stayed here for 4 nights with my husband. The service at the hotel is great, very quick to respond to requests and friendly employees. The beds are very comfortable and spacious and everything was very clean. The room service was delicious and arrived quickly. We spent a day at the Purobeach ""pool party"" although I would have to say it is a bit tame. I would not recommend this party to people looking to get wild and rave, the DJ had some soft house beats going but no dancing or loud groups were there. It was nice if you wanted to hang out and have drinks but nothing more. The only downside to this hotel is that it is about an 8 minute taxi to the gothic quarter/beach club area so if you are looking to be in the busy area I would suggest choosing something closer to there.

That being said, for business or families I think the location is good as the shopping mall is across the street and the area was quiet and seemed quite safe.",4,2018,08,22
36,Great Location,"Barca was our first stop and we spent 4 days.  1 jet lagged day and we arrived at 1030am but they did a wonderful job getting us one of our 2 booked rooms so we could catch a few winks.  If you have status with Hilton you get access to the concierge lounge which is top notch with a balcony and a view of the city if you don't want to be inside.

You can walk down to the beach, one of the nicest malls is across the street and if you want to let loose -- Puro Beach is part of the hotel and we spent a fabulous day there, think Tao Beach but you can take the kids.

The knock is the elevators took forever and if you need to factor in you are on the corner of the city but can metro in to the sites or take a cab, 15 min to Camp Nou.",4,2018,08,21
36,Great ,"Loved our trip and our stay in a standard twin room was pleasant. We stayed on the 22nd floor which had some great views of the city. The location of this hotel is what made the trip enjoyable as it 8s perfect if you want a beach holiday as well as a city break, therefore I would not necessarily return to this particular hotel but would the area it is in. ",4,2018,08,21
36,Mixed feelings: you need to like it,"Well, I was preparing throughly for the trip and read like 10 pages of reviews for this hotel. I really didn't take bad reviews seriously. Probably should have. After my experience, I will start with positive sides:

1. the staff is really friendly and doing their best;
2. after couple of days you might start appreciating the quite location away from city center;
3. the views are splendid. We ended up with both sea and city view - city view was more interesting actually;
4. air conditioning worked well everywhere apart from the elevator (you might really sweat by getting down from 23d floor during breakfast time);
5. the beds are super comfy;
6. the beach is very close; and it's a 20 min run to Barceloneta;
7. the mall nearby is nice with lots of good shops and restaurants, met

Disadvantages:

1. I really didn't get all the hype about the breakfast. It's really simple! Just two tables of the same stuff every day. We had executive lounge breakfasts. In general, food in executive lounge was average, nothing special. It was nice to have cava in the evening, though. 
2. This hotel is rather old. I read in reviews and was prepared that the rooms will be renovated. Actually, they renewed only room in the room, not the bathroom. So be ready for not the freshest makeovers. 
3. All over the hotel there was a weird smell of smth old. Not nice for sure. It felt sometimes like in old granny house. 

Overall, it's a good hotel, but not for this price. I am not sure if I'll choose this hotel again, maybe if there are no other options. 

",3,2018,08,21
36,Vacay in Barcelona ,"We spent nine nights at the Hilton Diagonal Mar and it was a stay true to the high expectations we have of Hilton. 
The corner room on the 14th floor offered great views of Barcelona and the sea  - even from the bathtub! 

Everything was very clean and the staff went out of their way to make our stay a pleasant one. Thank y’all again!!!

Breakfast is excellent offering a wide choice of delicious foods for every taste. 

The hotel is right next to fair and conference facilities and a mall with lots of restaurants, but not all too close to more downtown areas of Barcelona. No problem at all if you’ve come in your own car like we did, if you love to walk and use public transport. And the taxis are not too expensive either. Moreover, both hop-on-hop-off bus companies have their stops quite in front of the hotel, too. We enjoyed being away from the lively downtown area. 

There were only two smaller things that bothered us a little: There’s a kind of chemical stench in the hallways to the rooms which may be due to the hallways being so long without a possibility to air them out properly. And the hotel pool area on the second floor doubles as a Puro Beach Club, which means that you may have to adapt your concept of a relaxing time by the pool - at least Thursday afternoons to Sunday evenings: Loud club music will make relaxing impossible unless you bring earplugs; and even then you still feel the beat and bass hammering. As Hilton guests you can, of course, get loungers in the slightly removed Oasis area free of charge; definitely good enough. Barcelona has so many beaches that we were able to work around that. 

All in all, though, we loved the hotel and are sure to return. ",4,2018,08,21
36,Not ideally located,"The Hilton Diagonal Mar is not ideally located if you want to enjoy the heart of Barcelona. Located in the business area, this hotel offers you a glimpse of the newer Barcelona.
What I disliked was the hotel service. The minibar in the room was broken. They sent someone to fix it but weren’t able to right away so they said they were going to do it the day after- which they didn’t. Two days later they still hadn’t repaired it. 
The room was located next to a service room. Constant creaking noise of the service door and loud sounds were really diminishing the quality of sleep- and stay in general.
They put us in a new when complaint was made and said it to be a higher quality room, but the room was exactly the same- just on the other side and with no view except of the pool.
Beware that everythings is double expensive by the pool area, a salad costs as much as a two course meal- for two- at a restaurant across the street. 
What I liked about the hotel were the rooms. They are spacious and comfortable, as well as the beds. Also I liked being able to jump across the street to the Diagonal mall for shopping and restaurants.
All in all I was not happy with the service and I would not recommend the Hilton Diagonal unless you are the for business purposes or if you have a rental car- but be aware that you have to pay extra for parking the car at the hotel although you are a guest.",2,2018,08,20
36,Perfect Location,"As Hilton Hotels go this is another fine building of the group. 

From the moment you enter the revolving doors you are welcomed by several members of staff. 

The rooms, restaurant, pool area and the Hilton Honours Lounge area are all top class. 

Clean, trendy and very comfortable. 

The pool is tabby Purobeach so it does have music and you have to pay for beds by the pool. However, there are free beds for guests further back in the oasis area and the beach is a 5 minutes walk. 

This hotel is perfect for business or pleasure. 

It’s my 12th stay here and I will return again. 

I would definitely worth giving this one a try.",5,2018,08,20
36,Nice hotel with exceptional staff,"This hotel is a relatively new Hilton. It is 15 minutes from the centre of Barcelona.
The foyer area is bright and spacious . The bedroom was nice with incredible views of the sea. There are buildings in front of this hotel between it and the sea so the higher the floor the better. 
The staff are very helpful and pleasant. However there was nobody at the concierge desk on Tuesday to help with tickets.
There is a purobeach club on the second floor which has a small pool. This pool is not adequate for the number of people present at the pool. Hilton guests are in the oasis part of the club, behind a screen of bushes with no view of the pool. If you want to be poolside you have to pay for it. €30 for direct pool side or €20 for the second row. There were lots of children running around the pool area, jumping in the pool and screaching.
The executive lounge was lovely, very big and spacious however there were lots of children running around this area also. Not a very peaceful place for business clients.
The food in the pure beach was good, would highly recommend the Goats cheese salad. The breakfast was excellent, great choice and quality. However it was very very busy at times and was very unpleasant due to noise and people milling around the food.
The beach is a few minutes from the hotel and there is a shopping centre across the road.",4,2018,08,19
36,Excellent staff,"The staff here, all of them, are outstanding. Everyone we encountered was pleasant and keen to be of assistance. We ate in the bar and at Puro Beach. Both were excellent.Room was lovely with an incredible view of the sea. That’s the good stuff. There are a lot of negatives: 
1. The poolside is operated by Puro Beach. If you want to sit near the pool you have to pay for it. It is incredibly noisy with awful music. There were a lot of children  running around and diving into the pool despite notices to the contrary. Nobody seemed to be in charge. 
2. The lifts : The lifts don’t appear to be synchronized and result in long delays and when you eventually get a lift you stop at most of the floors on the way down. Not fun if you are on the top floor.
3. Executive lounge: When evening food is served it is full of children running around.",3,2018,08,19
36,Stay unfortunately let down by poor housekeeping standards,"Great service & product generally, especially the breakfast choice and daily treats, however our stay was massively let down by the quality of housekeeping and the unfortunate loss of expensive headphones through the removal of them from the bedroom, of which is being investigated.
Basic housekeeping shortfalls such as adequate number of towels for number of guests, cups not being replenished, tea/coffee not being replenished, milk missing, spoons missing etc. On our 2nd day we returned to find a broken glass still in the bathroom, dirty cups and plates still lying around - and this was after the room had been ""serviced"". Aside from the missing set of headphones, worse of all was the uncovering of empty bottles, toiletries, french fries, sweet wrappers and dirt under the sofa bed, only revealed whilst looking for the missing headphones, and under the King bed a receipt (along with dirt) for 4 days earlier than our arrival, which highlighted how poorly the room had/hand't been serviced.
As a hotelier of 25 years and a frequent hotel guest for business & pleasure, this was the most dissatisfied I have ever been with a hotel bedroom cleanliness, of which was explained due to bringing the ownership of housekeeping inhouse versus the previous outsourcing...it would seem that the training stage was missed and that the floor supervisor overlooked the basic requirements of a clean & serviced bedroom.
We depart for the next stage of our holiday and are still waiting for any news on the missing headphones, of which the hotel clearly cannot replace as that would be acceptance of liability.",3,2018,08,19
36,Good with some surprises ,"A good hotel with comfortable beds and a nice bathroom.

I was however surprised that we would need to pay for sun beds next to the pool as there is a private company operating the outside bar area. This was disappointing as the pool was a reason for choosing the hotel. 

Also, we were not clearly informed of a taxi strike on the day of our departure, even when checking out with the reception team. A letter had been left in the room but it was amongst all of the other paperwork that we didn’t look at. I understand it is my responsibility, but when staying in a big brand hotel I would have expected this to be better communicated. We nearly missed our flight and several other guests did miss theirs.

36,Hilton Mar Diagonal,"Our family of 4 loves this hotel during our 10 day stay here. Great staff, beautifully kept, very clean and a very nice location. 
Staff are super professional and friendly.
A special thanks to Alessia from the front desk who went above and beyond to help us (got a parking ticket with instructions all in Catalan). Great hotel, great pool, nice people, beautiful Barcelona. What else to ask for ?
Also, for those with a car, we were able to find free parking within walking distance near our hotel. Hotel is close to the highway, but also is near an L4 metro stop.",5,2018,08,16
36,stay away...not Hilton quality,"With a last minute flight change, Mrs East, Toddler London and I needed a place to stay for the night in Barcelona. 
As an HHonors Diamond member I booked a room on the Hilton App, cashing in some points. 
We checked in near 10p after waiting 20 minutes in the queue (despite being only 2nd!). We went to our room, turned on the air conditioning, left our bags and went downstairs for dinner at the lobby bar. We were very rudely informed that the kitchen was closed. We went across the street to the shopping mall and found a nice restaurant open, so we enjoyed a healthy meal at decent prices. 
We returned to our room around 11.30p to find the air conditioning didn't work. The Reception offered a new room -- a suite. This was smooth and easy, yet annoying considering the time of night. This is Barcelona in summer - it's hot - how can you not know the A/C is broken? 
Our suite had two rooms and two air conditioners -- luckily, as one was broken. 
Breakfast: stale food, flies everywhere, incredibly hot in the dining room. The servers were nice and friendly.
This hotel is absolutely terrible in almost every aspect. Avoid at all costs. 
PS: you have to pay EUR20 to use the pool",1,2018,08,16
36,"Modern, efficient but not personal","We booked the hotel to visit Barcelona and to be close to the beach.  Unfortunately, the hotel is a 10-15 minute taxi ride from the centre and the beach is not great.

Nevertheless, the hotel is highly frequented by tourists to a degree that there is a very high turnover of guests.  Unfortunately, that seems to impact how the hotel is run: very efficient but not very personal.  Staff did not spend much time with guests and a concierge was never to be found.

Breakfast is very busy, especially towards the second half of breakfast time when queues are likely.  And be prepared for endless waiting times at the elevators at certain times during the day.

The pool is fun, also run as a beach club for a young urban crowd, and the staff there is forthcoming and by far the friendliest.",3,2018,08,15
36,Very disappointing!,"We stayed in the Hilton for 7 nights recently. After visiting Barcelona for years and particularly diagonal area we chose to try a different hotel with a nice pool and amenities. As soon as we arrived check in was fast and efficient- the best part of the stay. From here we only faced disappointed. Firstly the reason we chose to stay here mainly centred around the pool facility and the money we had paid to stay in the hotel did not cover the pool charge!!! So we had the choose to sunbath under a shelter for free or to pay €20 Euro per person to be a little closer or €40 to be close to the pool! So potentially €80 Euro extra a day to use the hotel facility we have already paid for!!! We had been lucky (or unlucky) enough to overlook the pool. So music was very loud up untill 10pm. Not afternoon naps! The hotel was busy so it almost seemed an effort for staff to help. I had complained about the noise in the corridor but it was simply a reply to call back when it next happens. The hotel cannot help the fact there was also a festival happening over our last weekend. This noise continued long after the pool untill 2am but simply added to our frustration of the entire stay. The only saving grace was a complimentary meal at the pool which we had only visited once during the stay. This was offered after speaking to Maribel. However on check out we got a bill unexpected that hadn’t been charged during booking and a room service bill total of €30 for a water (non complimentary), breakfast-2 eggs, beans, mushrooms and ham So a total of €104 due to tourism tax, the charge they didn’t take and room service!!!! This really was the icing on the cake. I have to say it has put me off visiting Hilton again and it used to be one of my preferred choices but after spending a lot of money to stay in luxury and then being charged extra for it, I find disgraceful!",1,2018,08,14
36,Just OK,"I'm a frequent Hilton stayer, a long-time diamond member, and this hotel has all the workings to be great so i stayed here on my honeymoon. I thought that the whole process was sloppy. Upon checkin, and everyday after, there was someone fighting with the hotel staff at checkin. It made for a very unwelcoming feel. I was given two twin beds even though it was clearly stated in my reservation that it was our honeymoon. We were not given a bottle of champagne until 1 hour before checkout which was odd timing and we couldn't enjoy it - all other hotels had it ready for us upon checkin. It seemed that the hotel was understaffed or just unorganized and i would not stay here again.

The amenities are nice. The pool is very nice and we enjoyed that.",3,2018,08,13
36,Most US travel to Barcelona arrives in early AM - check in is not until 4 pm,"I had to wait for 4 hours while I watched others come in and get their room keys. After 3 hours I complained because I am a Hilton Gold Memeber and was told that I had priority.... and I was snapped at and told that there are various types of rooms that ppl were getting. After 4 hours of waiting, I finally begged to be put in ANY room and I was given a twin room. Others in my company were offered upgrades, access to the Exec lounge, and told an estimated time for their room to be ready. I was treated very poorly in comparison.",2,2018,08,13
36,Why would you go there.....,"The hotel is average like every other hotel room you've been in. All good....however you are about 4 kilometers away from the Gothic area and 3 kilometers from a decent beach. The beach near the hotel looks like a concrete wharf during ww2. More like an industrial area. The closer you go towards the old city the restaurants start to appear. There is a mid sized mall across the road with Zara and H&H etc just like the one you have at home. Why would you go unless your sandal strap is broken.

The hotel is fine apart from the slowest elevators due in the world. But the location is way wrong. Ill tear the hell out of my travel agent when I get back for marooning me in this desolate waste land.",2,2018,08,13
36,All that you nees,"Great hotel and with a mall directly across the street it’s convenient. Nice clean room s d great service. Nice view of the ocean with a little bit of obstruction though depending on which floor could be overlooked. Never made it to the pool but seeing it from my room it was perpetually crowded starting as early as 9am but it’s definitely a central hub of activity for the hotel. 
",4,2018,08,13
36,Good location for beach and shopping access,"Service here was wonderful, despite the language barrier. Rooms were clean, beds comfortable. We actually had a King size bed, not the standard for Europe. Keep in mind that you can only exchange $250 American per day. Currency exchange onsite otherwise is an ATM machine-check your bank for fees. Breakfast buffet was fresh and had a lot of variety. Next door to the Mall for shopping. Short walking distance to the beach. American families expect to see European beach with complete nudity not uncommon. Taxis always available. Good central location.",4,2018,08,10
36,Very poor Hilton experience,"Before I start to give some feedback: I love Hilton hotels. Whenever I travel (leisure or business) I prefer to stay at my favourite chain. I am a Diamond HH member and I have seen and stayed at various Hilton hotels and the reason why I always book them is that know what to expect. At least I thought so:
- I have experienced good customer service. My room was located next to a very noisy family and I only asked the reception whether there was a chance to change to another room. I also offered to be downgraded. The reception staff was very helpful and it didn't take 10 minutes and we got another room.
- Pool: The pool is a rip off. It had been nowhere mentioned that they charge you 20 EUR per sun lounger (next to the pool) per head per day. Other ones further away are for free. And the lounge music is so incredible loud that you can't relax at the pool. 
- Rooms: The rooms were ok, but I have also seen better. We had no bugs as I have noticed from other guests.
- Air Conditioning: The AC was put up to the max but it didn't work properly - the room didn't really cool down enough. Very disappointing.
- Executive Lounge: Good selection of food, clean and very friendly staff. I really liked it there. That has been the Hilton experience I have known so far.
- Guests: i understand that the Hotel cannot choose its guests. However, there hasn't been a day where I saw half naked men walking by the reception. Many drunk young people and I sometimes felt I had booked a hotel in El Arenal.
- Beach view: You can book rooms with beach view (the first room we stayed in had such a view). Well, you can see the beach. However, there a 3 big towers in your way as well, don't forget that. Of course, beach view is charged more.
- Elevators: Oh boy. There are 4 of them. The average wait was between 3-5 minutes and this is not up to the standard of a 4 star hotel.
Overall a stay in a Hilton hotel which I don't want to experience again.",2,2018,08,10
36,Presidential Suite!,"Now this is a biased report as I was lucky enough on my one night stay to be upgraded to the Presidential Suite! I had a very very large lounge area, a huge bedroom, a kitchen, bathroom with Jacuzzi and another smaller bathroom .. all for me! Excellent view from the 23rd floor. Service in the restaurant was very friendly indeed. Great location near the beach, opposite the shopping mall and close to the metro into the City. My only feedback would be the lifts were slow ... with only 4 and 23 floors the wait time was long on occasions.",5,2018,08,10
36,"Best in Barcelona, in my humble opinion!","This hotel was comfortable, very clean, spacious, and modern, especially for Barcelona. We rented a car and parking was spacious and easy - with 2 entrance/exits! The check-in process was standard, not too friendly, not over-the-top but respectful and as you would expect. Our room was a city view room, which had a beautiful view of the mountain and city. Normally I think people would choose a sea view but I think, either way, you win with the views from this hotel. The room itself was very spacious for a standard king room, and the bathtub was large with a separate shower. Peter Thomas Roth products were a nice surprise, and the towels were fluffy and of fine quality. Even the toilet paper was impressive, to be frank! We ordered room service as well and it arrived within good time and the food was very good. The pool area was attractive, there was a cruise ship group who checked in so there were plenty of kids around which isn't really my cup of tea but I appreciated the pool area none-the-less. My one complaint is that the elevator/lift was often full and busy, and there was often a long wait for one. I've stayed in a few hotels including the one besides this one and the one across the street and this Hilton is my favorite of the three. It's not very close to the typical tourist spots but it is only a short taxi, bus, or train ride there.",5,2018,08,09
36,Great hotel personnel service and pool!,Beautiful hotel right next to the Diagonal Mar Mall and close to rail station.  Hotel staff is very helpful and gave us great tips for getting around.  Pool is amazing and had a great time relaxing and swimming.  Thanks for s short but wonderful stay!,5,2018,08,09
36,Average - more business than pleasure ,"It’s not one of the Hilton’s best and they would accept that. But is is close to the beach and is convenient for doing things ‘Barcelona’.

Eating there would be a sin given all that is available to you outside of the hotel and so don’t be foolishly and take either a breakfast or sinner package. 

Biggest problem for me was having to wait, an average of 5 minutes for a lift. They were SO slow!!!!!",3,2018,08,09
36,Great Hotel,"This hotel is not on La Rambla but highly recommended. There is a metro station one block away, great service, amazing beach view and breezes, all you need is there. Highly recommended for any type of trip. ",5,2018,08,06
36,Great hotel..... but...,"I really enjoyed our stay at this hotel.  Our reservation gave us access to the executive lounge which was very nice, complimentary snacks, and beverages was a big plus for our stay here.  The location was good for shopping and going to the beach.  My BUT is that the pool was run separately from the hotel (pool bar and restaurant)  and therefore if you wanted a chair by the pool you had to pay for it.  Hotel guests were allowed complimentary chairs (which were lovely) but not close to the pool at all, and when traveling with a child you need to be with them while they swim so we ended up sitting on the edge of the pool (when we did not go in) to watch him. Making you feel less welcome in the area. Overall it was a great stay friendly staff clean rooms.",4,2018,08,06
36,Unfortunately not Hilton level,"My HHonors level was not noticed when checking in. Check in was extremely slow - took way over 10 minutes even all passport numbers and birthday details were e-mailed to hotel before arriving. In other Hiltons this is completed less than minute. Minibar was loaded by earlier guest’s stinky food and it took 2 days from hotel to clean it. Minibar was not filled by hotel so I never received any water bottles... Breakfast was ok, but on Sunday things like bread came very late after the breakfast was started - for example sparkling wine was not offered to us at all... Pool area was very overpriced, noisy and too busy - luckily beach is close. Unfortunately I can not recommend this hotel with this experience. We made our own decision and checked out on Sunday even we had prepaid our stay until Monday. ",1,2018,08,05
36,"Eh...just okay, especially for a Hilton.","Booked this hotel for a couple of nights to explore Barcelona before a cruise.  There were a few glitches and inadequacies that, for the price, location, and Hilton brand, cause the average rating.

Through the hotel, we had arranged for a ride from the airport in advance.  This was done and confirmed through email.  When we got off the plane, there was no sign of the driver or shuttle.  We called the hotel desk and asked about it - they eventually informed us that no one had actually arranged the car, despite the fact that we had gotten confirmation of it well before the trip started.  They did try to locate the driver to see if he was still at the airport, but eventually they called back and advised us to just take a cab, so we did.

We arrived a few hours before check in time, and they advised us that the room was not ready; told us we should go eat lunch and come back in an hour.  Did that - room still wasn't ready.  Told to wait in the lobby and they'd let us know when it was ready, as it would be ready ""shortly.""  We waited another 45 minutes, went back up to the desk, was told it still wasn't ready and come back in an hour.  We finally just came back at 4 pm (check in time) and the room still wasn't ready.  It was just an aggravating first day - the staff was busy, but it was frustrating getting strung along.  

The location is really good - close to a beach area and across the street from a nice shopping center with good restaurants and shops, including a really great multi-purpose store with grocery (good for getting some snacks and drinks, plus anything you forgot to pack!)

The room was good - air conditioning was adequate and we were comfortable.  There was an in-room fridge, a safe, lots of space; beds were clean and comfortable.  Watch yourself in the bathroom, though - it is lovely, but every floor surface is slick.  

Didn't have the breakfast - we opted to go across the street to one of the coffee and sandwich places.  The location is well served by cabs - you'll have to take one to get anywhere near the old town.  

The pool looked beautiful, but it was weird - nightclub music pounding all day long, etc.  Kind of looked like the set for ""The Bachelor"" up there.  We didn't actually spend more than a few minutes up there - too loud.

The bar staff in the lobby were great - very friendly and efficient and made some fantastic recommendations for drinks, wine, etc. 

Overall, once we got settled in things were fine, but for the money, looking after the details was just so-so.",3,2018,08,04
36,Fabulous stay as always ,"What can I say - great hotel, location, staff, service and amenities 👍👍 The team know how to run a hotel and the services are well run - a no hassle stay 

If you can get the ExecutiveFloors you will not be disappointed by the views ",5,2018,08,04
36,A new low to the Hilton Standard,"My wife and I spent our 35th anniversary in Spain and 3 nights in Barcelona.  First, we made a mistake by staying too far from the old town area so we spent a lot of money cabbing to the good restaurants, sights, etc.  We thought staying on the beach would be nice but found three office buildings blocking most of the water view that we paid extra for.  Then we were surprised by a bottle of champagne and a box of chocolates already opened and consumed, but even more surprised that the bellman offered to take the empty box but not to replace it. Really? The hotel charges $20 to $40 for poolside lounge chairs and towels but the loud bass shattering music was free. (how annoying).   If you don't pay $20 each for their buffet breakfast, they won't even let you in for a cup of coffee. We had to walk 100 yards to get a cab cause there was no bellman on duty most of the time and the concierge worked maybe 2 hours a day and was not very helpful.  In short, there are too many other hotels in Barcelona, so strike this one from your list and spread the word.",2,2018,08,02
36,Front Desk ,"Just checked in, very impressed by the overall location of the hotel. 

The luggage was worked away fast, and the front desk is absolutely amazing.

On Check In my booking was incorrectly done from my side but the efficiency and professionalism of Enrica and Ettore was amazing.

They sorted me out within minutes as I was traveling with my family and the could see we just arrived from a long haul flight, the kids were tired.

I was upgraded and a room was given to me even though it was 8-30am, Enrica arrange for us to use the executive lounge early just to accommodate us for a quick coffee, thanks so much.

The hotel is lovely , with all the amenities of a 5 Star property.

Thanks again to the team Enrica and Ettore, you will certainly move up the ranks quick, 

Wonderful .....",5,2018,08,02
36,Everything has a price,"I had checked in online and inputed credit card details etc but on arrival had to go through the process again and hand in my credit card for payment. Hotel room was lovely but no complementary water. Pool is a disaster. You can opt for a €30 or €20 lounger - or go to an area where its free. However in that area the overhead canopy could not be rolled back so your only option was to savour the humidity in the shade. The staff at the pool were in sales pitch mode - spa treatment, bar, food etc.. the constant thud of the loud music is annoying and not necessary. The pool area is a separate company from the Hilton and as a hotel guest paying full price for the rooms, this should be advertised as such. Disappointed. ",3,2018,08,01
36,"OK, that is all","Due to a cancellation of our flight back from holiday, we booked a room at Hilton Diagonal Mar. We have stayed at the hotel several times before, for one or two nights as an ending of our Spanish/French holiday. 

A good reason for choosing the hotel is of course Puro Beach. However, they have changed the guest’s access to Puro Beach and it now comes with a cost. Hotel guest not wanting to spend money, 20EUR, on beds close to the pool are advised to stay on less nice beds a bit at the back. 

We were travelling with a 9-year old, hence we did not want him to spend time in the pool unaccompanied. This meant one of us had to be in the pool with him at all time. 

Puro Beach is also in need of an update, it is looking a bit shabby at the moment.

Our room was OK at first glance. However, we found a lot of dust under the extra bed, and the bathroom is in need of restauration.

Breakfast is on one hand nice, with omelette/egg station and all you can desire from a 4*hotel. On the other hand, it is extremely busy, and waiters are so eager to tidy up that they removed our coffee cups before we had finished drinking it, twice!

Staff was helpful and polite, even if our room was not ready for check-in at 6pm. We did get complimentary breakfast as we had to wait.
Sincerely,

Parking in the basement is pricy, 36EUR for less than 24hours.

I will consider returning if/when the hotel receives an update. Location is good if you have a car, and it is close to Diagonal Mar Shopping with lots of shops and restaurants.",3,2018,08,01
36,Nice hotel but no bottled water,"I stayed here with 3 friends and we booked 2 rooms.

Check in was quick and friendly and she explained everything, they upgraded us all to the Exec Floor with lounge access which is always welcome. She explained that we could take two bottles of water from the mini bar and we wouldn’t be charged, I assumed this was each day but sadly not do 2 bottles of water for 3 nights and 4 days is a bit odd. This really does need to be looked as, especially as they ban water being removed from the Exec Lounge.

The rooms were fabulous and very comfortable and the air conditioning worked well and was quiet so you could sleep with it on.

The Exec Lounge was superb with great staff and indoor and outdoor seating. Some great food and some not so great but it was plentiful.

Overall, very impressed but they need to sort the complimentary bottles water issue.

36,Wonderful Stay at Hilton Diagonal Mar!,"Had a really great stay at this Hilton. 
* Beautiful, modern room with gorgeous view overlooking the city. 
* Clean, renovated bathroom
* Great executive lounge, with awesome views of the water and great food selection. Fresh fruit in the mornings and great snacks in the afternoon.
* During the taxi strike, they offered service to the airport which was great.",5,2018,07,31
36,Poor bar service,"The only way to get served is to go to the bar. No service. Not what you expect from Hilton.
At the weekend you have to put up with the mindless continual bass beat from the pool area. OK if you are a teenager but annoying for anyone older.",1,2018,07,30
36,Not up to Hilton standards,"I’m a Hilton Gold Member for life. Needless to say I stay in Hiltons around the world often. The decor of this hotel is early 1980s, dark and dirty. Staff is helpful. As a frequently visitor with Hilton , normally my room is upgraded. Here I wasn’t. The courtesy lounge is not offered the Gold status members. The safe in the room was inoperable. When I raised the inoperable safe issue with the desk, I was asked to wait in the room for an hour until a staff member came to replace the safe. ",1,2018,07,30
36,Worst Hilton experience EVER!,"The front desk staff was the worst I have ever experienced.  They refused to enter my HH number for the first 4 days of my stay, refused to provide bottled water, and had a toxic attitude each time I interacted with them.  Members of our group all experienced their rude behavior and attitude.    The AC would not stay on and had to have someone come to the room to reset the breaker 3 times, and the shower temperature would change from ice cold to scalding hot every few seconds...  I am a huge Hilton fan...and I have to report that this is the worst Hilton experience I have every had worldwide.  Do not stay at this hotel.  They get all the Disney Cruise business and have no motivation to do anything that is hospitable.  ",1,2018,07,30
36,Excellent,Lovely clean hotel bit out the way but was easy enough get the metro to where you needed to go. 10 minutes walk to the beach. Lovely pool although you have to pay extra for sun beds close to pool area. ,5,2018,07,30
36,Disappointing,"Beach area too crowded and music too loud. It’s like a club 18-40 which was uncomfortable for my sone and wife and I. When we went to the pool it was good busy, too noisy with single tones and groups of “adults” acting inappropriately. ",3,2018,07,29
36,Dissapointed!,"1. We stood for roughly 15 minutes for check in.
2. We called 3 times before we got our luggages, it’s lack of coordination. 
3. Why guests has to pay €30 per person for beds to watch their children while swimming at pool? It is not about relaxing or enjoying at the pool area anymore, it is more about showing off.
4. The pricing is rediculous! It is not worth it. Why you pay €20-€25 at Hilton for 1 dish if you could get €20 for  3 courses at the restaurant at the mall across the street.
5. We stood again for check out about 20-25 minutes before we got help.
6. And again we stood for 15-20 minutes at the concierge area waiting to get help for transport. But in the end they couldn’t help us to get the transportation and as a result we  end up of missing our flight back home. 
This is all because of waiting, standing in line at Hilton. 
Not going to stay here again.

The positive things are good breakfast and good location if you’re going to the beach.

36,Long waits and not so clean,A hotel of that price category should have way better service and cleanliness. Waiting over 15min to check-in and out is a bad joke. Also while the lobby is sparkling clean the corridors are a mess with dust balls floating around and a funky smell...,1,2018,07,27
36,Loved it,"We just returned from 4 nights at the Diagonal Mar and had a great time.The hotel was clean and the rooms very modern. We were on the upper floors looking toward the sea. The city views were also nice and I think on the lower floors the city view may be desirable as there is a very tall building on the sea side so floors lower then 20 are mostly obstructed by the tall building. The city view was less obstructed. The beds were a little hard for a new hotel and not nearly as soft as the heavenly bed at the westin. The bathroom was nice but only had a single sink. Our room included breakfast which was American style with omelets, waffles, fresh fruit, lox, cheese and almost everything else. It was included in our rate but would have been 20 euros per person. Very nice if included in the price. The location was a little out of the way in a very new area with lots of construction surrounding it. The mall next to the hotel was very convenient. There were many places to eat and an inexpensive grocery store which also sold wine similar to a Wal Mart. It was very nice to pick up snacks and wine to enjoy in the room. Our kids also liked shopping in the mall. It wasn't a real high end mall but had several stores similar to Abbecrombie and the gap. The subway was next to the mall and a very short walk to the hotel. It took about 10 minutes to get to the center of the city from the hotel by train and about 6-7 euro by cab. We were a little worried about being so far removed from the city center when we booked this hotel but it was actually quite nice to escape to the quite of this hotel in the evening. The staff was very friendly and always helpful. The pool did not open until April so we could not use it. On the negative side, when we checked in we were given a smoking room even though we requested non-smoking and could not be moved until the next day. After we were moved we were very happy with our stay. Another negative is that there is alot of construction in the area. The hotel is few blocks from the sea and the area of the sea near the hotel is being worked on by very heavy machinary so don't expect to be right on the beach. It is a long walk to the beach area. All in all we would definately stay at this hotel again. The place is almost brand new and very modern. The rate was quite reasonable given the amenities. We paid 185 euro a night for the first room and 92.50 per night for the kids room. This included breakfast each day. Barcelona is a great city to visit and I would highly recommend visiting this exciting city.",5,2018,07,26
36,Be Prepared to Wait! ,"Our cruise line had this listed as a recommended hotel. The hotel is beautiful don’t get me wrong.... the service on the other hand is much different. Our room wasn’t ready for hours on end. In fact our room was still occupied despite it being past the check out time. Complaining to management was virtually pointless and didn’t resolve anything. They actually had the gall to tell us to next time book the night prior.

Other issues, do you want Euro techno music blasting to your room from the pool area, this is the right place for you then. Hell if you even want to sit by the pool, the area is run by some outside group that charges you go sit by lounge chairs by the pool. The only pluses to this as close proximity to a shopping mall and close proximity to the beach. Stay clear if you actually want a relaxing get away. The low point of our getaway for certain and I can’t believe these people have the gall to use the name Hilton! Will likely look elsewhere if visiting Barcelona in the future. ",2,2018,07,26
36,What a special place! A Favorite!,"My fiancée and I decided to stay at the Hilton Diagonal after a weeklong cruise. We were torn between staying at the Hilton near the city center or this beach area location. Staying at this hotel was the best decision of our trip! The location was absolutely fantastic! Two different hop on/hop off bus stations were minutes away. We took the City Bus tour because it was a direct route to the Sagrada (two stops, no bus changes). One block away are the beaches and oceanfront bars/restaurants. Right across the street from the hotel was a huge mall with 15+ restaurants.

The room at the hotel was perfect! Not only was it modern, but spacious too. We had a great view of the ocean (seventh floor). The pool club was a nice bonus. People online complain about the fee. As a guest, you can use the pool and get a chaise lounge for no cost. The cabanas and chairs right next to the pool has a fee. This luxury was not necessary and the complimentary area was just fine.

As much as we loved the location and facility, the best part of this hotel was the staff. Albert from Concierge gave us a great recommendation to visit Poblenou. We found an outstanding restaurant there called Colom. Three ladies from the hotel far exceeded our expectations. Alejandra, Marialaura and Sara went above and beyond for us. They made my fiancée feel extra special for his 50th  birthday. Not only did they arrange cake, they went above and beyond with decorating the room for him. Wow! They actually took the time to make handemade decorations and recognize his special day with special treats. Their kindness will never be forgotten! From the bottom of our hearts, we thank all three of you so much! You are the reason your hotel has become our favorite.

As many other reviewers have said, breakfast was outstanding! Awesome kind staff plus great selection of food! Nice bonus perk for gold+ members. If not a gold member, worth the splurge.

For cruisers traveling to this hotel pre or post cruise, we recommend an Uber. Taxi lines outside the terminal are really long. As for getting around while at the hotel, lots of public transportation nearby plus a taxi cab area at the corner. Hop on/hop off is a great option too

Thanks for a great trip! Can’t wait to go back soon!!!",5,2018,07,25
36,Great position,"We choose this hotel because of the position, being very close to the sea. Great position, good breakfast, easy acces to metro, bus, taxi. Great staff and concierge service was very good (they offered us all the details that we need it to know)",5,2018,07,23
36,Pleasantly surprised,"I spent one night here whilst attending a conference. The hotel was perfectly located for this, immediately next door to the conference centre which was 5 mins walk away. 

The room was large, bright and comfortable with a superking sized bed and nice bathroom. Breakfast was plentiful and a good standard.

Just over the road was a large shopping centre where I spent a couple of hours whilst waiting for my room to be ready.

The beach is nearby and my room had a sea view. There was a well appointed gym but absolutely my favourite thing was the Puro Beach Club. Now, it’s not on the beach but there was a lovely pool and deck with really comfortable loungers, DJ and drinks service. It was perfect for an afternoon of relaxation pre-conference.

The center of Barcelona is a 15 min metro ride or 10-15€ taxi away. (I’d recommend a taxi after an attempted pickpocketing incident on the metro!)",5,2018,07,22
36,"Wait, wait, wait","I was told sorry, no early room access, ten minutes before 4p (official check-in). At 4:10, “please wait ten minutes as the cleaning is just about finished.” After three more checks, and another hour of waiting (each time, “ten minutes, please”, I was finally told I could go to my room. I carried my family’s luggage, as no one was available. 
Not impressed, even if it was half the high price.",2,2018,07,22
36,Another top stay,"Our second time staying at this hotel and it delivered once again. The general quality of the hotel is high, staff helpful and friendly and the breakfast had great choice and was delicious. We used purobeach three days and it’s a great beach club addition to the hotel, with good vibe all day long. Exec lounge has top views of the beach and food drink selection is good. 

The only criticism was the lifts were on a mega go-slow so could take 10mins sometimes waiting to get to your floor, but other than that no hesitation in coming back. ",5,2018,07,22
36,Great service ,"Wonderful hotel, in a good position by the sea and near to metro stations that bring you to Barceloneta in 15 minutes. Luxury rooms, with all that you may need, excellent service, fantastic breakfast. The commercial center just outside the door is a great plus.",5,2018,07,21
36,Wasn't sure at first...,"Ok, for the record I didn't do much homework on proximity of things - ie. the Rambla, the Gothic Quarter, etc. However, it wasn't a bust. By the 3rd day I started to appreciate where this hotel was located in relation to the city center and the advantages of being away from the huge crowds that amass at Placa de Espanya. The beach area is within easy walking distance of this hotel, but if you are looking for the beach vacation thing, don't stay here. Maybe go a little north towards the W. But if you are a family looking for familiar and convenient amenities, this is the place. We got a room with a combo of city/sea views (ended in 07). Be sure to check out the floor plans of the hotel. There's a mall across the street with ample shopping, food court and restaurants, and a Walmart-type store on steroids - you can stock up on liquor and snacks (along with that bathing suit you forgot to bring), and save a ton of money burning it on the hotel bar. The executive lounge offers evening cocktail hour with snacks and free drinks, along with a nice breakfast that will save you a good breakfast bill somewhere else. The exec lounge needs to work on that bottled water thing, seems that bottled water is a premium here, and you have to ask to get a bottle you can stash in your room. I think that's an amenity we take for granted in the States, and seems to be difficult to make available here. If you do decide to stay outside of the city center, buy the T10 ticket - 10 trips on the metro for half the price of a la carte tickets each time. The metro station is on the other side of the mall and will take you into the city center within 20 minutes. Gets wicked crowded in the afternoon, but you get to see a good cross-section of tourists and the folks who live and work here. 
The concierge desk is extremely helpful and can line you up on whatever tour you want to take. While we were here we saw Montserrat, the Picasso museum, and Girona/Dali tour. I'd recommend all 3, but the highlight by far was Montserrat. There's plenty of shopping at La Rambla and Gothic quarter to be had.
Be prepared to work through language barriers. I don't mind not knowing Spanish and fumbling my way through menus, street signs, and such. Some people might find that challenging.  The people of Barcelona are super friendly and willing to help, even when they are unsure what you are saying. So I tried to operate the same way. Loved this city. I will be back again soon.",4,2018,07,21
36,Great beach location,"We flew from Sydney via Hong Kong to Barcelona. We had a 5 hour layover
in Hong Kong so by the time we arrived were exhausted. A hotel transfer was waiting
for us. We were taken straight to the hotel, had a lovely breakfast and not long after
our room was ready",4,2018,07,21
36,Disappointed !!! 😩,"Dear all,

I have organized a trip to Barcelona and I booked two nights at Hilton diagonal mar.

I’ve paid 38€ from the airport to reach the hotel (night prices). Once arrived, the room was pretty nice but the bathroom was not that clean.

The breakfast was not that tasty, the room is so big.... you don’t feel on vacations, it is really noisy.

Moreover, I’ve paid for a pool view and what I got it’s a view on the umbrellas ... nothing like the pictures I’ve seen.

The next day, we decided to enjoy the pool.
If you want to be by the pool front line you have to pay 30€, the second line is 20€ and at the extreme back of the pool (where you can’t even see the pool) it’s complementary for the guests of the hotel!!!!!

I don’t recommend Hilton diagonal mar.

The only positive thing is the receptionist who tried to help us to solve our room issue. 

",2,2018,07,21
36,Perfect location,"Travelling from Amsterdam to Barcelona in only 1h and 50 min we had no problem getting a cab to get us to our hotel. The car fare was +/- €30. We have arrived at the hotel at 4PM which was perfect because that was the check-in time...only the problem was that the hotel was full, a lot of people had extended they checkout and our room was not ready. We were asked kindly to wait for an hour and come back to ask if our room was ready. After getting some drinks at the hotel and waiting for an hour we went back to the front desk to ask if the room was ready but once again it was not. Half an hour later we came back and the room was still not ready...to make te long story short after 2 hours we got 3 rooms on different floors. Once settled in we went to the business party where we were one hour and a half late. To be honest we were not happy with the long wait but on the other hand the staff was doing everything to assure us everything will be taken care of. My huge kingsize bedroom was on 16th floor was amazing. Pool area...oeh the pool area is amazing but a lot of rules where can you sit, have to reserve certain spots and pay for them extra...first row next to the pool is €30 and so on. Ohh yeah mini bar at the room...just don't do it. The prices are insane at least to me. Little suggestion ...make it cheaper I would drink more ;) Make sure if you go somewhere with the cab to check at the front desk of the hotel if they have usual Taxi stops otherwise you will be forced to take the bus or a train...it's a blood bath ^_^. Next to that across from the hotel is a food court and a shopping mall really cool place to kill some time and have a nice meal. And the beach is 5 innie minnie tinny minutes from the hotel (be careful with your phones, wallets and all your possessions, a lot of pick pockets) ...so bingo. We worked, we partied, we worked, we networked, we went to the beach, went shopping...we just had fun. 
P.S. If boss is paying for the trip visit Opium, Pasha and Carpe Diem it's only 5-10 minutes from the hotel and take",5,2018,07,20
36,Breakfast the best deal,"We have a supposed deluxe pool view king size room- room is ok. Needs a few updates. Very big convention/ business hotel. Not the treated for vacation folks. Staff could not be nicer. They try hard! Our bathroom in 515 needs a bit of work: poor hot water, plus broken toilet seat. Tired pillows. Bed hard. A/c unit not working as well as we’d like. It’s a Hilton! So we want it all to be perfect! The bathroom amenities are great: Peter Roth Sephora level products. Good location but far from old city center. Lots of taxis and gray Line tourist bus stop right nearby. 
Breakfast buffet is huge and abundant in variety. Fresh OJ the best! Interesting foods and fruit and gluten free stuff for those folks into that. Hotel out a but from city center but a good choice for cruise ship passengers. ( which we will be starting tomorrow). ",3,2018,07,20
36,Fantastic stay,"This is a large hotel with good views of the sea. We were upgraded to a club floor with sea views which were beautiful. The highlight of our stay was the happening pool with its DJ and great atmosphere. We love every moment of it. Rooms are of a good size and the breakfast was great as well. The lounge on the 15th floor offers the ability to sit outside, enjoy the breeze, and a drink, what else can you ask for?",5,2018,07,18
36,DON’T BOOK THIS HOTEL!!!!,"My family & I are currently staying at this hotel. We booked this hotel over other more moderately priced hotels in the area, because of the pool as recreation for my 3 children. The past TWO of the three days we have been there, the Pool has been closed for PRIVATE PARTIES. 
This is unacceptable and guests should be notified BEFORE arrival.  We definitely would have switched to a hotel that caters to its guests over corporate parties.
DISAPPOINTING!!! ",1,2018,07,18
36,Great place,"Great hotel. Staff was friendly. Pool area is beautiful. Only a couple hundred meters from the beach. Easy access to beach running/biking trail. Taxi stand outside 24/7. Was great. 

Only downside was the elevators get very busy between 08:00-10:00, so leave some extra time to catch an elevator down in the morning.",5,2018,07,18
36,Bad service,"Sunbed charges, extremely impolite staff, noisy neighbours... I am staying in Hilton Diagonal Mar for a 2 week business trip and I am going to strongly reccommend to remove this hotel from my company favorites.",1,2018,07,16
36,Best Service - Highly Recommend this property!,"Having stayed in many hotels throughout years and working in the hospitality industry for 10 years in an upscale boutique property, these guys are doing it right.  From the moment of our arrival, we were welcomed and made our family feel like each member of the staff was there specifically to make our stay as enjoyable as possible.  Highly recommend this property - excellent excellent service!",5,2018,07,13
36,Lovely break lovely staff shame about sunbed charges,"Had a lovely time. Booked two rooms and thank you to xavier on check in who clearly put in a lot of effort to put our rooms next to each other. Had good sea view, rooms spacious and comfortable.we ate in the bat restaurants downstairs, and the service was over and above and went out of their way to make us feel pampered. Cant remember her name but used to work for Hilton in London. Thank you! Pool was lovely lovely but be prepared for the sunbed charges €90 for three.",4,2018,07,11
36,We liked the hotel,The hotel was nice. The executive lounge was excellent and offered breakfast and a light dinner with drinks. The pool equally as great. We enjoyed it with our three year old who loved playing in the little pool area. The location was also nice as everything is an easy metro ride away. If you are comfortable taking the metro then don’t shy away from this hotel as it is a gem.,5,2018,07,09
36,Great business hotel ,"This was my third stay in this hotel since 2015.
Although not central, its location is very convenient: close to the International Convention Center of Barcelona (CCIB), opposite to a huge shopping mall and in walking distance to the beach.
I was happy with the size of my room and bathroom, although the furnitures and bathroom floors should be refreshed.
The staff, whatever its function, is always extremely friendly and helpful. 
The breakfast buffet is probably the best I’ve ever experienced worldwide.",4,2018,07,08
36,The Sad Truth,"Readers, please bear with me, this is a long review but do read my experience because its worth being aware on some of the points.

I have written two emails for the attention of the manager whilst I was at the Hilton but I have never received a reply....so this review is directed to him. Hopefully, this time I will get a reply.

Dear Absent Manager,

I have had the best time in Barcelona with my daughter celebrating her end of year exams but I have had the Worst experience with the service at your hotel. 

Let me first relay the good points:

1. Perfect Standard Twin Room - No complaints. 
2. A brilliant side view of the sea. 
3. Absolutely spotless. 
4. Brilliant design of the recent room refurbishment

Bad points:

A day before my arrival, I was offered to checked in online and saw the option of the rooms I was able to choose from but I stuck with the one chosen for me Room 1105. I also had an email from guest relations to ask for my passport details, issue date, nationality, date of birth for a faster check in and I gave them all my details. Dalila also asked if I needed any assistance with taxis and suggestions for places to visit. I replied no thank you. I told her I have arranged to take a taxi from the airport and that its my 3rd visit to Barcelona and the hotel. I also told her the reason for my trip and she replied to say that the hotel will provide juice and cake to help us celebrate. I said that’ll be really nice. She also did her sales pitch and offered an upgrade at a cost. I said no thank you. 

Fast forward, arrived at the hotel...there’s a bellboy standing outside but no assistance given. It wasn’t busy by the way. Got to check-in and still had to wait to load our details in and confirmed our room 1105. We arrived early at 12pm and the room wasn’t ready. I did request months before for an early check in but I understand its at the hotel’s discretion. Never mind, the GSA took my phone number and said she will call when the room was ready. We came back at 4.30 to find out we were bumped to a lower floor Room 907. So despite confirming online and at the front desk TWICE, we got given a lower floor. 

I found out at check out, this was because the person who was occupying the room decided to extend his stay. The GSA would have known this at 12pm when I checked in. 

NO juice and cake. I found out at check-out that it was sent to Room 1105 and never corrected. 

Also shame about the absence of a complimentary bottle of water and the stingy offer of one bottle of shower products for 2 people.

During our stay, we came back to the room and found our cleaner using just her hands to wash our used mugs/glasses. I told this to a GSA at front desk and she assured me the cleaner had soap & sponge when they wash the glasses. I assured her, she didn’t!!

On the last day, at 11.30am, despite putting a privacy hanger outside our door, a man in normal clothes knocked and before I could reach my door, he opened it. Thank goodness, I had the latch on. He looked behind me as if to check the room, then mumbled something as I closed the door. I looked through the peephole to see him still standing there with a big shopping trolley talking to his friend. I was scared. I called Reception who didn’t apologise but said they will find out what happened. They didn’t call me back to reassure me, instead I had to ask at the front desk and found out it was Maintenence guys. They have a master key to all the rooms, have no idea which is occupied, open doors at will and scare the guests. I was not happy!! What a way to end my stay at the Hilton.

I was also told when I checked out, that depending on who you get at the front desk determines how you will get treated. The person who checked me out said that if I had checked in with her, she would have upgraded me on the spot whereas the person I actually got, bumped me to a lower floor without explanation.

My view is this. It is easy to trust a well known chain of hotel because you feel safe in the hands of a reputable brand. I worked in 2 different hotels and the things that go on in the background sometimes is shocking. I know for a fact, that my 3rd visit to Hilton this time was really poor. No manager present to talk to or reply to my emails during and after my visit. I was also told that the current FD Supervisor is leaving so might not get the chance (or the care really) to reply to a ‘Standard Room’ guest.

I must reiterate the importance of double locking your room door, using your safe and washing your glasses/mugs yourself before use. Also, it is much cheaper to catch a taxi from the hotel to the airport. The taxi stand is to the right of the hotel and is always plentiful. The costs is not more than 35 Euros. If you book through the hotel, it is 90 Euros.

Hilton, honestly, shame on you!",1,2018,07,01
36,Good except for pool availability,"No complaints as far as cleanliness or service - in fact, our flight arrived early and we hadn’t slept in over 24 hours, and the staff was great about getting our room ready early. One of my complaints would be lack of availability to the pool area. One night it was completely closed due to a private party; although I’m not sure we would have gone anyway since it costs money to use a chair by the pool. To me it seems unnecessary considering the rate I paid to stay at the hotel. Location is fine as well...a little far from the rest of the city but nice to be by the beach. I think I booked this hotel hoping to use the pool but didn’t use it once over the span of 4 days due to unavailability and/or cost. Otherwise, the hotel meets your basic needs: cleanliness, service, and convenience. ",4,2018,06,30
36,Great Hotel - great service,"Stopped here at the end of May, As per other Hiltons the place itself was great, but as ever it's the staff that make the Hiltons what they are & it all added up to a great break in a great Hotel, with great staff...

Took advantage of Puro Beach, as a Diamond member it helped, so worth making sure you mention that. Had a good half day of R&R by the pool there. The Hotel itself is a short walk to the beah which is right at the top end of the Barcelona beaches. That suited us as it seemed to be quieter (easy to find good space) & also fortunate to be right by Bambu, which was a convenient & friendly beach bar.

As others have said, big shopping mall across the street, close to the metro etc. It is away from the centre but v easy to get in there via whatever means (Barcelona is a beautiful city...). The location suited us perfectly, there's not much that you'd be short of here...

Exec lounge was excellent, staff v friendly & helpful. Had a great sea view room & were well looked after the one evening we ate at the Hotel restaurant, perfect Filet Mignon & a great wine recommendation... 

Fantastic short stay and hope to be back soon...",5,2018,06,30
36,Great!!!,"It was a really nice experience to stay at the hotel. Close to beach, close to public transport just in front of a Mall. Great breakfast. What else can you ask for? They also have a fantastic pool. Service was kind specially the concierge. ",5,2018,06,29
36,Very enjoyable short stay!,"We stayed here for just one night in advance of a cruise. The hotel is in a great location, right across the street from a large mall with some great restaurants, and close to one of the Hop-on/off tour bus routes. Service, food, room service, concierge all excellent, and we had a superb corner room with amazing sea views. Our new 'go to' hotel in Barcelona - can not wait to return!",5,2018,06,29
36,Great atmosphere!,"Good food, services and it is clean!!!! 

The lounge is a good size, good coffee, snacks and drinks, people from the hotel are very friendly. 

Located Close to the beach and a bit far from the crowded streets.",4,2018,06,28
36,Good service but for all the extra they ask money !!!,"The room was nice, spacious, big bathroom with a jaccuzi bath and tv, nice gym, purobeach down to the hotel with nice party, there is some free sunbed but far from the pool so better you pay 20 euros to have better sunbed. The guy from the reception offer us the breakfast because we came to Barcelona to celebrate something. But the problem breakfast close at 10am ???? What is that we are in Spain, people wake up late, specially we booked hotel in this area to be close of music festival, so we missed 2 breakfast, second time we arrive 10 min late, I add to make drama just to grab a coffee .... last day we ordered 2 coffee , 2 orange juice in the room they charge me 26 euros ????? When I call the room service to ask for 4 glass , no ice nothing else they ask me 8 Euros for the service ????? Is it a joke ???? I stayed in Hilton in many countries I never see that, they charged you for everything. ",3,2018,06,27
36,Barcelona Review,"This Hotel has great access to beaches and easy access to city center.  We prefer to stay outside of the city when traveling to large cities and this fits the bill.  We could relax at Hotel after visiting attractions during the day.  The concierge was very very helpful as this was our first trip to Barcelona.  Hotel staff waitress etc were great.  Pool is a party environment suited for adults during the weekend, but family friendly during the week.  Great place!",5,2018,06,26
36,Good enough,"I stayed there for 1 night, the room was pretty good with ocean and pool views, the gym its excellent , and the breakfast too, the lobby furniture are neglected, the pool its nice but you need to pay 30 euros or something to use the beds... as A guest of course I didnt pay that , I left the pool, Im a hilton gold and I cant believe that you need to pay for that",4,2018,06,26
36,Great hotel.,Lovely hotel. Easy transport access. Perfect for getting out & about. Great breakfast. Very clean rooms. Travelled for my daughters 16th birthday. Booked a day at the rooftop pool to celebrate but wished we hadn’t as it was busy with hen/stag parties.,5,2018,06,23
36,Barcelona Stay,"Stayed here as part of our extended stay through Viking River Ocean cruise.  Oliver, a Viking rep, met us at the hotel and was very helpful with information.  However, the overall stay was just average.  It was too far from the center city.  I, do not feel it met the standards I have experienced with my stays at other Hilton’s.",3,2018,06,23
36,Will recommend,It is not walking distance from city centre but if you are the type of person who wants to be away from where bunch of tourist stay after your long day trip. I would stay in this kind of hotel in terms of distance. Cab going to the city centre in cheap and it is worth it to take a cab going to your hotel after long day of walk.,4,2018,06,23
36,A culture of poor customer service,"As a Hilton diamond member I have experienced every level of Hilton property mostly for business but also enjoy using my points for vacationing. I stayed at this property as part of a 2 week vacation in Europe. This was by far the worst experience I have had at any Hilton property. The front desk staff was rude and combative, the restaurant was incredibly slow and the servers at the bar could have cared less. 
The rooms were as expected however and the housekeeping staff was very nice. Breakfast was good. 
Overall I will not go back next time I go to Barcelona ",2,2018,06,22
36,Do not stay here!,"Do not stay here! 20 Euro per chair to sit at the pool, if there is an event going on you are made to feel most unwelcome.  Can you imagine, 225 euro per night for a room, then told you need to pay for a pool chair and then made to feel unwelcome.  Location stinks for tours, 15 euro taxi ride to anywhere, nothing in this newer neighborhood.  Find another place there are plenty in Barcelona.",1,2018,06,22
36,Not bad ,Not a bad hotel.  1st day the elevators broke. Had to walk 11 flights down.  The breakfast isn’t bad. It’s not in walking distance to la rumba.  About a 10 min taxi ride. The beach is close and also the mall ,3,2018,06,20
36,It's a Hilton..,"Nice hotel.  AC did struggle a bit to keep it cool.  Rooms are nice and clean.  Staff are very friendly and very bilingual.  Very convenient to mall across the street.  Just an American style hotel  Puro Beach is there but pretty pricy. Since I am a Gold member of Hilton our Breakfast was included.  It is a REALLY GOOD breakfast.  The Fresh Squeezed Orange Juice is still missed at our house.

Convenient to Metro as well.",4,2018,06,19
36,"Ole, for Hilton Barcelona!","We had an excellent corner room with great views of the ocean.  If you have status, the executive level is one of the best.  The food was great and the wine and champaign even better.  The continental breakfast was great and the hotel staff very attentive.  My wife loves her tea in the morning and the staff always prepared her, her own separate pot of tea each morning.  The were very friendly and went out of their way to help suggest places to see and how to get there.  I am a lifetime Diamond member and trust me I have stayed at some lousy Hilton hotels during my travels.  This is not one of them.  It is a little out of the city center but close to the subway lines.",5,2018,06,19
36,Good Location for the beach,We stayed at the Diagonal Mar during the Grand Prix weekend. Although the hotel was busy it was not too congested. The staff at checking were very polite and offered us some good advice for sightseeing. Our room overlooked the small pool and we very clean as you would expect. One problem with the shower was fixed very quickly. The bar area was a bit chaotic. There never appeared to be enough staff yet they were everywhere. During our two day visit the price of a beer and wine varied by 4 euros. The hotel is very close to the beach you can walk into the Marina very easily. The tourist bus has a stop just down the road and there is a shopping centre just opposite. Ther are many places to eat and drink nearby. It is far enough from the centre to quiet yet close enough that is only takes about 20 mins to get there. A good choice of hotel. The bar could be a little cheaper.,4,2018,06,19
36,Gem in Barcelona,What a lovely hotel. Great location across from mall and walking to bus and subway. Exquisite pool. Friendly and helpful staff with hands-on manager. They helped me get a reservation for dinner at Viana (which I had read about on Trip Advisor )! Another don't miss Tapas spot. Great way to begin our vacation.thanks for the memories!!!,5,2018,06,18
36,Beautiful hotel just a short ride away from the city center,"I stayed at this hotel for a little over a week in March with my family.  This was one of the few hotels that had a large enough room for a family of four.  We arrived before noon but the hotel was nice enough to allow us to check in early which was great after the long flight across the Atlantic.  They even let us sit in the executive lounge and have a light meal and drinks while we waited for our room to be prepared.  At the time the lounge on the 15th floor was being renovated so the temporary lounge was in the lobby.  When you arrive you are greeted by the hotel bell hop who helps you with your luggage.  Check in was a breeze.  Our room was on the 11th floor.  It was a corner room with a nice view of the city.  You could see La Sagrada Familia in the distance.  The shape of the room was a little like a triangle.  Just like the design of the hotel.  We had the breakfast option in the morning which I would recommend.  It is a traditional Spanish breakfast with jamon iberico and tapas, an assortment of cheeses, breads, fruits, and hot meal options.  The hot chocolate is very good as well.  There was always plenty to eat and the staff was attentive and friendly.  The hotel is within walking distance to the beach.  Taxi stand is at the corner for trips to the city.  Fare to the city was about 10 euros. There is a mall directly across the street with many food options and apparel stores.  There is even a supermarket in the mall where you can pick up some wine and snacks.  The room itself is very nice and clean.  Well appointed and spacious for us.  There is even kid friendly programming on the television like Disney Channel.  We went in March when it was still too cool for the pool. But from what we saw, the pool area looked very nice.  We also used the workout facility which had good equipment for a workout.   I cant say enough about this hotel and what a pleasant stay we had.  I would definitely return to the hotel for the convenience and the cleanliness.  I recommend the breakfast and the executive lounge.  We sat in the lounge in the evening to watch FC Barcelona vs Chelsea and the staff offered us complimentary water and nuts and pretzels.  Choose a high floor so that you can get a view of Barcelona.",5,2018,06,18
36,exellent Barcelona,"Great location and service. Very close to the beach.
I liked a lot the breakfast buffet, where they have all what You need. Very nice little lobby bar bar.
I got access to the lounge where they really treat You well. ",5,2018,06,18
36,"Great location, and a room with a view of the ocean.","Love Hilton Hotels, and the Hilton Diagonal Mar in Barcelona kept it's promise of great customer service.   Also, it is right across the street from a mall, that has wonderful cafes and a food court that will cut food costs.    It's also just a short walk to catch the trolley into downtown Barcelona at a minimal cost.
Our room had both an ocean view and a view of the city and mountains.  The room is modern and very comfortable.",5,2018,06,18
36,Barcelona City tour and La Sagrada Familia Church,Our family of six adults stayed at the Diagonal Mar prior to our Mediterranean cruise for 2 days.  It is a modern Hilton Hotel situated about 15 to 20 minutes by taxi from the cruise terminal and the airport and close to all city attractions which can be reached by the Red Bus Hop on Hop off feature.  We visited Gaudi’s  La Sagrada Familia Church which is unforgettable as well as La Pedrera where Gaudi lived... both sights to behold for their iconic and unusual architecture.  We toured Barcelona and ate tapas in one of their sidewalk cafes.,5,2018,06,18
36,A great way to start our vacay,"We flew all night and half of a day before arriving at this hotel .The bed was very comfortable. We were on the concierge level, so had access to the wonderful sky view terrace where they had drinks and delicious snacks. It was a great way to unwind.",5,2018,06,17
36,Excellent!!!!,"This Hilton rocks!  Clean, safe, and very well run.  The location was great, close to the beach (which there is a really cool pub on the beach) and train station.  There is a mall across the street as well.  The service was excellent and the club room view was one of the best I have ever seen.  This Hilton will not disappoint!!",5,2018,06,16
36,good location and service,Hotel room had a views of mountains. I would recommend this hotel for its outstanding customer service. Staff very helpful and polite. Had some packages sent directly and i didnt have to pay for handling service. Great staff!!! Thank you!,5,2018,06,11
36,Great Hilton property,"Stayed here a couple of times, I really like this property - it is close to the beach, excellent to run along the shore, nice clean rooms, swimming pool (although can get crowded) and nice executive lounge - going back there soon !!!!",5,2018,06,10
36,Exemplary service!,"Our stay at this Hilton hotel for three nights was enhanced by the incredible service experienced from the very moment we arrived.  From beginning to end the service was delightful, friendly and attentive. Our bellman, Ivanov, was very patient, informative and gracious when responding to my questions about places we could walk to and how to arrive to places I wanted to visit. The breakfast buffet was excellent. Each morning there was a wide selection of fresh food (hot and cold) and again we experienced the friendly welcome and wait staff.  Room service also had the same attitude to make sure we lacked for nothing. These are the details that made our stay in the hotel extra special.",5,2018,06,09
36,Don't go there!!!,"We went to the Hotel terrace bar to have a nice drink and what did we find? Music extremly loud (DJ must have a hearing problem) and drunk people.... So, if you want to lose your hearing, this is the place to go... it's quite anoying.... We asked if they could lower the music and the so called manager told us a big NO....
The music goes on until late night os I imagine it would be impossible to sleep in this Hotel... what a shame, just because they won't lower a little bit the music...",1,2018,06,09
36,"If you wanna spend your holiday time, Dont tkae this hotel!!!","As a Diamond Member!!!

This hotel are so suck... It just next to shopping centre but if you go to Barcelona is OK but if not dont be here!!!

Far from the centre beach and really difficult to get there...

I have a problem since booking and i let my friends book still horible services!!!

I would not recommend this hotel to any of my friends so spend your holiday time with other hotel is better...",1,2018,06,07
36,Terrible location for leisure travel and loud,"The location great for a water view but terrible for easy access into sightseeing areas. The pool club played music until the wee hours of the morning and it could be easily heard from our 12th floor room. Staff did not care that the music was disruptive to sleeping and generally was rude. If traveling for leisure and with a family, consider staying at a local hotel where they will appreciate your business. ",1,2018,06,06
36,Nice hotel be aware of extra charges,"We booked in here for 6 nights to go to primavera for which hotel is ideally located. Hotel has great rooms with matching views. Problem we had was the 20 Euro per person per day charge for using hotel pool and sun beds. This is widely shown on hotel advertising but no mention of a separate charge anywhere. We asked to discuss with hotel manager but he did not get back to us. This left a sour taste when paying high price for room already. On brighter side, we went to nearby beach and lounged there for free.",3,2018,06,05
36,Diagonal Mar,"A Hilton hotel straight out of the box: rooms are clean, and the building/facilities well maintained. Service good and staff friendly. Prices are not value-for-money, generally speaking (but you pay for the Hilton brand, knowing that you can count on not being unpleasantly surprised, there is better value for money to be had, if you want to do a bit more research, I am sure), the pool area though is inexplicably expensive (the beach however close by). The hotel is perfectly situated for the Primavera Sound festival and a 15 mins walk to the center of Barcelona.",4,2018,06,04
36,Far from the city center ,"Hubby got the room on points, so we stayed away from most attractions. Made good use of our Hola BCN cards as we were at least 8 stops from anything. But the room itself was great - spacious, clean, and comfortable. Staff were lovely. Expensive pool area, but we only went once. Great room service, delicious chicken Caesar salad. Nice shopping mall across the street. Great place to stay if you don't mind having to take public transportation or taxis all the time. ",5,2018,06,02
36,DO NOT STAY HERE,"In Spain for round 2 of our trip. Stayed here last week came back and have sat here for 4 hours waiting to get our rooms. Have watched countless amounts of people come in after us and get their rooms. We didn’t ask for any special rooms, but only asked for an early check in upon arrival and was assured it wouldn’t be a problem. We are honors members and would never stay at a Hilton again.  Asked if we could just get one of our rooms so we could put our passports in a safe. Nothing but poor excuses and no help. We even called corporate who did nothing to assist with the problem or refund our money back so we could stay somewhere else.  Was a trip of a lifetime ended horribly because Hilton SUCKS!",1,2018,06,02
36,"At the end of the day, it's just a Hilton...","I had high expectations for the hotel - a new build with a very flash looking pool deck and a good spec, but the execution seems to be lacking. Service by the pool was irritatingly slow, offerings in the executive lounge were poor. If you're staying on a club floor, ignore any guidance on dress code in the lounge as it's not enforced. It strikes me that this hotel could be brilliant and a stand out for the chain in Europe, but at the end of the day, it's just another Hilton.",3,2018,06,01
36,Very pleasant stay,"Stayed prior to going on a cruise. Pretty good distance from the main downtown and/ or tourist areas, but safe area and close to the ocean. Hop on , Hop off buses go right by. Lots of restaurants within walking distance. Shopping mall across street with a huge grocery store for inexpensive snacks and wine. Very clean. Staff very friendly and helpful. ",5,2018,06,01
36,"Nice hotel, good area but expensive pool","Another nice Hilton hotel, rooms clean and well maintained, service very good and the fitness center is adequate enough to train well. The pool area is charged if you want to sit next to the pool and a Coke is 6 euros for 200ml. Just go to the beach which is a 500m walk. ",4,2018,05,31
36,Smart modern hotel in nice area,"We have just spent a long weekend at this hotel to go to the Grand Prix. The executive room was lovely with great views down the coast, and across the city. The big bathroom and bedroom were of a very high standard. The evening free drinks and food in the executive lounge were a real treat.
The hotel is across the road from the shops and restaurants of the Diagonal Mar.
With the Forum/Maresme Metro station only a five minute walk away. Travelling to the circuit was simple using the metro and train. We bought and shared a 10 ticket book for the Metro for 10.5 euros. Then bought a 5 euro return to Montebello from Passeig de Gracia. Great value.",5,2018,05,31
36,Need to take responsibility ,"
Our stay was mostly pleasant. The included breakfast was great. They also knew it was our anniversary and gave us a special surprise. The room was nice and I was able to select my room before via the app. However during our stay the elevator got stuck and trapped my wife and 6 other people for an extended amount of time. The situation became very stressful for some of the other occupants as the alarm wouldn’t function properly and we ended up having to pry open the doors ourselves. It was a very unfortunate incident and I reached out 3 times to management to give them a fair shot to address the situation. I never received a single reply and it’s been 2 weeks since my initial outreach. I understand these things happen however I find the lack of response during an emergency unacceptable. Sad to say I would not recommend this hotel. ",2,2018,05,30
36,Overnight Before A Cruise,My husband and I stayed  at the Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona overnight before a cruise. Our room had a beautiful view of the city. It was spacious clean and the bed was very comfortable. The staff was friendly and helpful. We enjoyed a wonderful breakfast the next morning. The hotel location is good. It was close to public transportation and across from a mall with shops and many restaurants. Also a short walk to the beach. We would definitely stay here again and would recommend to anyone.,5,2018,05,29
36,30th Wedding Anniversary,"Our visit to Barcelona was a Pre-Transatlantic Cruise, 30th Wedding Anniversary Celebration and the Hilton Diagonal Mar Hotel and Staff exceeded all expectations.  

From the pre-arrival e-mail communication with Raquel Carvalho with the Reservations Department, to the quick and efficient check in and rapid luggage delivery,  everybody and everything associated with the operation of this hotel was extraordinary.

We received a complimentary upgrade to a full ocean view and the room was absolutely spotless, spacious, and comfortable, with a complimentary bottle sparkling water and chocolate truffles for our arrival.  

The Executive Lounge had substantial choices of items to eat and drink, and the breakfast in the restaurant was incredible.

As frequent travelers for business and pleasure with current and many years of Hilton Honors Diamond Status, this was a fantastic hotel from top to bottom that we definitely recommend.",5,2018,05,27
36,Excellent location and great hotel,"We stayed for three nights , our room was on 40th floor overlooking the sea.  Good rooms with all amenities . Check in and check out was smooth. Breakfast was excellent , with little seating in the balcony to enjoy the weather.  Decent lobby . You have a mall right opposite across the street for some additional eating options.  The staff was very pleasant and courteous . Will come again.",5,2018,05,26
36,Barcelona Trip May 2018,"I highly recommend this hotel and the location.  We stayed 7 nights in May 2018. There is a grocery store, shopping mall and nice restaurants directly across the street.  The metro is only a 10 minute walk.  Once you get to the metro, you're golden.  Barce's metro, train and bus system is very good, clean, and reliable.  We visited Girona, Casterdefells, Tibidabo, the Arena, went rock climbing in Garraf all via metro, trains and buses.  We rented a car once--on day 6 to get to Montserrat and the Airport which we booked thru Sixt car rental in the hotel lobby.  

Newly renovated, the spaces are really nice.  Despite being a swimmer, I didn't get into their outdoor pool.  But if you are a swimmer--the pool area is off-the-chain nice.  As a diamond member, their executive lounge is very nice also--on the 15th floor--outdoor sitting with views to the ocean, good food, fully stocked bar.  

Everyone was very friendly, willing the help.  I was able to call customer service for help finding local tennis courts we could use.  Customer service made the call and reserved the court for us.  The courts were a 20 minute walk from the hotel.  

Looking at the location of this hotel on the map, first thought is that it is far away from the old city.  But looks are deceiving.  One evening, after dinner in La Rambla, we walked along the beach board walk back to the hotel. Don't get it twisted, it is a long walk.  It took a 1 1/2 but it's all along the beach lined restaurants.  

Enjoy.",5,2018,05,26
36,"Typical Hilton Hotel, good in every way","I stayed at this Hilton for one night and I felt very welcome every second of the stay. 

Was upgraded to a Executive Room (as a Diamond) but unfortunately there was no time to check out the Executive Lounge. 

The room was spacious and I liked that there was a bathtub in the room. 

The hotel itself is very stylish and seems clean and tidy. 

The suits of the reception staff was remarkable, as it was light colours instead of dark colours as in every other hilton I have visited.

Also late Check out was given without discussion. 

I would recommend this hotel for a business trip and a vacation as well. ",5,2018,05,25
36,Good location for business option,Have been several times to this hotel for the conferences as a part of organizers. Very good option for conference with the premises available and location. The only improve could be done in food options.,4,2018,05,25
36,Mixing Business with Pleasure,"I spent 3 lovely nights here during a conference and I enjoyed my stay very much. I had a view to the city/mountains, it was glorious to wake up to the amazing view from the 17th floor. The room's furnishings and design sparkle, everything felt clean, fresh and new. The entire vibe of the hotel is elegantly cool and mesmerizingly relaxing. The staff were incredible they were some of the best most trustworthy individuals I've had the pleasure of meeting on any of my trips. They made us feel like royalty! A special thank you to Miguel and Thali..(sorry for spelling that wrong) you really made my stay special. This hotel is in a great location for my first time visiting Barcelona, beside a huge mall, 2 minute walk from the beach, 1 hour walk to the Sagrada Familia... I took a 10euro cab ride to it and then I walked back :) The hotel's breakfast was delicious with many local delicacies and all the familiar ones too ;) My only observation is that the breakfast buffet in the later hours 9-11 felt a little understaffed so the service was slow. We weren't in a rush so we didn't mind too much. 
Overall one of my favourite hotels visited to date. Thank you Hilton Diagonal.",5,2018,05,25
36,Perfect pre or post cruise hotel in Barcelona,"Stayed here a couple of nights following a recent transatlantic re-positioning cruise.

If you are looking for a modern, comfortable American style chain hotel, the Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona is a perfect match.

Located across the street from the Diagonal Shopping Center, it is very closed to food courts and the ocean. This is a safe part of town and a fantastic hotel.
Rooms are very modern and spacious and the breakfast hits the spot.

We used points for our stay and were upgraded due to my Diamond Status.

A very nice experience~",5,2018,05,23
36,"Next door to the Natural Science Museum and we went to a wonderful concert at the Forum, next door to the Museum.","We had to go to reception due to being locked out of our room and the special breakfast amenities on the 15th floor twice!  No reason, nor apology.  One of the dressing gowns provided for guests stay disappeared on the second day and we mentioned it as we did not wish to be charged following our stay.  The housekeeper immediately replaced it.",4,2018,05,21
36,Beautiful hotel good location,"We spent one night post cruise here. It was 15€ for taxi from port to hotel and 30€ for taxi from hotel to airport.  Thy stored our luggage until we returned and brought it up to our room for us when we got back. Taxis are right outside the hotel, shopping and restaurants right across the street. Hop on hop off stops right around the corner. The room was modern and the bed was comfort and we had a king room so we had a bathtub and shower which was a bonus. The nice touch of a lighted makeup mirror in the bathroom was awesome for my wife. The concierge helped us with deciding how to get to La Sagrada Familia that morning as we had booked ticket for entry at 10:15 and this was at 9:30. We went by taxi as it was the fastest and only €10. We did not have breakfast included and the price was high at €27 ea. when we inquired. We would definitely stay here again just wish we had more time to see Barcelona.",4,2018,05,20
36,Hmmm,"It’s ok but...
Room indifferent and food bland. You could be anywhere, there’s nothing Catalan or even Spanish. This morning I wanted to sit in the sun by the pool but no cushions put out til 10.30 when I was leaving and not allowed access last night as private functions ongoing! Definitely wouldn’t stay there again ",2,2018,05,18
36,Nice property with easy access to Barcelona,"We spent 4 nights in the Hilton Diagonal Mar in May 2018 and enjoyed our room and the service of the hotel employees. We primarily used the executive lounge for breakfast and cocktails in the evening and the food and other selections were quite good. Not a fan of their coffee machine however. Formal breakfast buffet in the hotel dining room was also very nice. We constantly (daily) had key problems when our keys wouldn't work either the elevator or the room (sometimes both). Kind of aggravating to say the least. While not real close to downtown it was easy a commute by bus or taxi and I enjoyed the lack of crowds where other hotels are located downtown, but the view from the Diagonal Mar was great. Pool area would be a problem if not a diamond member, but I'm not a pool sort of guy.",4,2018,05,17
36,good hotel pleasant stay,"good hotel, located near a shopping centre with plenty of food outlets. Hop On Hop Off bus was close by. Hotel staff very friendly. Rooms were clean and quiet. Tram is also outside if public transport is preferred.",5,2018,05,17
36,Nice Hotel,"It may seem to be a little far away from downtown but this hotel has lots to offer.

The hotel has a pool side bar and you can easily spend afternoons after afternoons there.  The hotel lobby bar opens until 1am (I think) but as expected, it could be a little expensive with a pint of beer coming in at €10 each.

As for the rooms, they are nice and clean. You will either get sea view or city view but both ate nice.

Staff are super friendly especially in the exec lounge.  Lounge offers alcoholic drinks between 6pm and 8pm daily.

Regarding location, it is opposite a shopping mall with many many restaurants to choose from. It is only 5 mins walk from the metro station which doesn't take long to get into the centre.

Highly recommend this hotel and will use again for business or on holiday in Barcelona.

",4,2018,05,16
36,some great some not so great,"Arrived after a 14 day cruise in the early morning had paid for the night before so we could check in at 9am. We are diamond so had hoped for an upgrade, not sure we got one, but talking to others in the executive lounge they did and they were able to check in without paying for an extra night and they were not diamond not so great .  I need to let people know who wonderful the executive lounge is what a great lounge wonderful service the food was very good we were there 5 nights and always had great choices.  The deck was so nice esp if you were a smoker I am not I don't like smoking but I think people need a place to be able to smoke with out bothering others. so the executive lounge GREAT. We had trouble with our room key lots of trouble in fact everyday one day 2 times not GREAT. And the front desk has a hilton honor area but only has a person there sometimes, so we would need to go have our key redone and wait in line for a long time, because you need your key to use the lift not GREAT. But the breakfast was very good, only complaint they don't use cream for American coffee only milk I could live with that . Now the pool start out NOT GREAT we are diamond so we did not have to pay I would have been very mad if I had  to pay, no service we ordered a drink took over an hour we were going to have lunch but that didn't happen, the pool was like ice water I think you could heat it for what you charge very disappoint I'm the pool. Check out again my husband when down early so we did not have to stand in line. As we were leaving I looked at the bill and noticed we were charged for the mina bar and we did not use it so I hurried down knowing there would be a line I was right we were on our way to catch a train . so big problem, we had bought hilton gift cards amex had had a special on them last month knowing we were going to be staying at 3 Hilton's on this trip thought it would be a good idea. So my husband had paid our bill with the card but we were over  charged. so she took off the charges but messed up our gift card.so when we went to use it in Madrid we could not not sure how to take care of this, very mad about this.lots of problems with desk but it is a beautiful hotel not sure we would stay again 

",3,2018,05,16
36,Good standard ,We had one week at Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona. The hotel is located near to the beach and underground station to the city in a business area. Take a room in a higher level with sea view. If you want to be down town choose the other Hilton.,4,2018,05,16
36,Great hotel for mini break,"This is a large city hotel on the outskirts of the tourist area but only 10/15euro in a taxi or walkable if your very enthusiastic (we did it once) to the gothic quarter. Staff are lovely but special mention to Yovany who is  outstanding and cannot do enough to ensure you have a great stay. 

Lovely decorated rooms, we were on the 18th floor and had amazing views of Barcelona. The newly done out exec lounge was also great with very attentive staff happy to help. 

The hotel pool is great and as a diamond member we had the loungers for free however I’m not sure there website makes it clear there is a cost involved (discounted for hotel guests)",5,2018,05,15
36,Three nights in May,"Together with my partner and two friends we booked three nights in this hilton hotel I am a hhonours member. We stayed in room 317 
The room suffered from constant noise from the metal frame of the pool canopies squeaking outside which was almost unbearable how the management don't know about this is beyond comprehension.  
On our first night we had the following bar drinks three G ang T and one V and lemo cost 62 euro which was 10 euro for the booze and 7.50 euro for the mixer believe it or not . We did not drink in the hotel again. About 12 euro to las rambles and the same to the sagarda in a taxi enjoyed our stay but things that would mean I would look else where in the future for a hotel in barca 😬",3,2018,05,12
36,Lovely view of the Med!,"Our room looked at the Med. be sure that you get a high floor as there is a building closer to the sea that can block your view. The front desk was very helpful in finding dinning  locations; across the street at the mall, and stops off the metro. The executive lounge was under going renovations and they set up in the lobby bar area with a privacy screen. The lobby got very warm as the setting sun came in. Our room was lovely, food in restaurant was good.",5,2018,05,11
36,"An Excellent Hotel, except for the Pool Area","This is an excellent hotel. Great location and great service. My only issue was the pool area. It was too noisy with music blaring out loud. For some it may be great, but for some they like peace and quiet to relax. For that reason, I did not use the pool. They should publish times when it will be peaceful quiet time.",5,2018,05,05
36,Solid Hilton In Barcelona,"My family stayed here for 4 nights in early May and, all in all, were very pleased.  The location is great in the sense that its far away from the huge crowds more in the center.  The local beaches are not crowded and are a short walk from the hotel.  The breakfast buffet and staff were really spot on - great selection, good quality, very friendly.  We got upgraded to a Junior Suite which was spacious and offered great views of the ocean and city.  I highly recommend renting bikes which make it very easy to get all around the city.  The downside to the hotel was the rest of the staff.  Very messy and not helpful.  The exective lounge was so so compared to other Hilton's of this level.  The weather was not such that we could really enjoy the pool but the gym was really nice and had everything we needed.  Definitely will come back again.",4,2018,05,04
36,Bed Bugs,Initially the stay was fine. The staff was lovely and the property was beautiful. On the second night we discovered a huge bug infestation and asked that we be moved. The hotel would not move us until it was almost time to check out. ,3,2018,05,03
36,Crazy WOMAN,"when i arrived in barcelona it took us 4 hours to arrive to the hotel we were tired and it was hot we just wanted to lay down but their was a line understandble busy day the gentleman that helped me was very friendly but it was ashame that we didnt get rooms next to each other we had 2 rooms we didnt know in advance about honor app that we could book rooms our mistake but they could atleast get the rooms together one of us was staying in floor 8 and the other floor 19 eleven floors higher that was crazy after we had to pay tourist tax the basic understandle but when we checkedout and the reason for this review their was this woman tint black hair on monday 30th april she was at the honor side i still had to pay breakfast so i said we already checked out but we i havent paid for breakfast yet and then she tries to tell me with he horribke english accent i then told her i dont really understand when she then looks irritated and says i have to pay again for tourist taxed for 21 euro i said 21 euro she tried to explain but couldn’t understand a single word what she said told her that she kept looking mad and just says pay up when i tried to explain we already paid and after big aruge we just paid and the cost was 1.21 per night not 21 but she kept yelling 21 i just asked for receipt so that way i atleast saw how much i had to pay

But i had a great night but 1 horrible person ruined my vacation i had to work hard for this but this is just horrible don’t know why hilton hired her she is the worst with customer’s no friendly face or smile the gentleman that me was vert friendly i didnt even get angry that we didnt get room next to each other ofcourse i was irritated but he explained it to me in proper english unlike her just yelling and still couldn’t understand antything what she said
but never again HILTON  worse service and very experience and very far from the city!
worst vacation ever",1,2018,04,30
36,"Great, except for Executive Lounge","Great location close to the beach, shopping and restaurants. As a Diamond member I was upgraded to Jr Suite which was very nice.

The executive lounge was under construction and they set up the lounge in the lobby. I'm not sure that everyone was entitled to use the lounge, no one ever check for Gold or Diamond status and therefore the lounge was very busy.",4,2018,04,30
36,Friendly staff and spacious rooms!,"This hotel has very nice, clean, spacious rooms. The staff was very friendly and helpful.  We enjoyed the breakfast buffet each morning and it is a very short walk from the beach. There are also several restaurants and a mall just across the street. I would recommend this hotel!",4,2018,04,29
36,"Don't hesitate, book it!","Far best stay I have ever had - everything was perfect, from pre-arrival, check-in and the whole stay. Executive lounge has a breathtaking view and breakfast restaurant has a vast selection of items - famous Hilton breakfast never disappoints! Service was also exceptional; a special thanks to Yovany that made our stay unforgettable and Eliza in the restaurant who went extra mile to fulfill our request. I will undoubtedly stay here again. ",5,2018,04,29
36,Not cheap but worth every Euro,"Nice rooms, very friendly and committed staff. Breakfast really rich and e.g. with food free of Gluten and Lactose for those of us suffering from illnesses. Location is really superb. Close to the CCIB and the green line of the Tourist-bus of Barcelona. 200m to the sea and 30m to a shopping center. A visit to the parc diagonal mar is always worth the while - it's just across the street. Only negative thing I can say is the price - not only for the rooms but also for Dinner (a Burger with french fries and soup is about 60 Euros)",4,2018,04,29
36,Great views and spacious room,Stayed 4 nights at this Hotel. It is close to the beach and has a mall right across from it. The metro is within easy walking distance. Nicole from the front desk desk took great care of us being that we just came of a cruise and were a little tired. The corner room on the 17th floor we had was great with views of Barcelona and the ocean. The only thing that scared me was that one of the elevators that got stuck on the 13th floor a couple of times for a minute after that we took a different one every time. Overall this is an Excellent hotel with a very nice and comfortable Executive lounge on the 15th floor. We would stay here again on our next trip to Barcelona ,5,2018,04,28
36,Great location and service!!!,"The hotel is located in a great area close to the airport, front beach, mall and great restaurant. Customer service excellent. Employees are very nice! I would recommend this hotel 100% restaurant could be pricy but across the street multiple great restaurants ",5,2018,04,24
36,Very good but not something awesome!,"Very nice bussiness hotel situated in the Diagonal Mar district of Barcelona, about 5km away (10' by taxi) from the city centre. Lightful lounge, very good and relaxing pool bar, but average for a Hilton hotel breakfast area and breakfast itself. Clean rooms with view and spacious bathrooms with shower and bathtub. Excellent service overall.",4,2018,04,24
36,Second trip to Barcelona,During my second visit in Barcelona I spent two night in Hilton Diagonal Mar. Every Hilton hotel looks almost the same so I was not surprised. Room was clean with nice wiew to the city center. Bed was comfy as usually. Staff is nice and helpful.,5,2018,04,23
36,Great stay in Barcelona,"This was our third trip to Spain and wanted to see something new. The hotel was in a great location. Reasonably close to the airport and the city. It was across from a large shopping center that made things convenient. Public transportation is also close.
I can't say enough about the staff. They are terrific. Always willing to help. Will certainly return.",5,2018,04,22
36,"Amazing stay, a top hilton hotel","Recently stayed here for one week at the beginning of April. We had a fantastical stay, it's an extremely clean hilton, the staff where very attentive the food was amazing and the breakfast was by far one of the best i have ever had at a Hilton. We where very well looked after and I can not fault my stay or the hotel in any way. I would definitely return and recommend this hotel for any barcelona trips.",5,2018,04,17
36,Super!,"Stayed for a week and everything went perfectly. Special mention to the bar and restaurant teams who catered without fault for the entire week. 

Great spot too only 10 mins from centre. I will definately be back. 
",5,2018,04,17
36,Best in class,"Very attentive staff and great rooms! Pure Beach is the icing on the cake. Digital key meant I only had to carry my phone wherever I went. Quite relaxing. I’ll return next time I’m in Barcelona, especially due to the great location, very quiet and good connections to roads and public transport",5,2018,04,15
36,Amazing view of the city,"Location: It is a bit away from the city centre so you would need either public transport or taxi. We were a group of friends so taxi was a cheap option for us. There is a beach few minute walk away that is a bonus. A shopping mall at doorstep with plenty of cafes and restaurants.
Room: Our room on 11th floor had spectacular views of the city. Spacious and clean rooms.
Amenities: Bit silly to pay for a sunbed near the pool area and we preferred the beach anyway.",4,2018,04,13
36,Excellent hotel in the Barcelona Business district,"We elected to arrive in Barcelona a day early before boarding a 22 day cruise.  Unless you must stay in the heart of the city, You should consider this hotel.  It is across the street from a major shopping mall, with a couple of very good restaurants, and convenient to the main bus and metro for very easy connections to the central city.",5,2018,04,12
36,What you expect,"When booking a Hilton which is why we stayed there. The room was nice and the bed comfortable. The hotel is not really near anything special. However, it’s very close to a Metro stop as well as near a Hop on Hop off stop location so if you are using either service, then you will be happy here.",4,2018,04,11
36,Great stay!,"Wonderful and highly professional staff who are helpful in every way. Hotel is in a great location near the beach, shopping and restaurants. Enjoyed beautiful water views from our well appointed room. Will definitely stay here again!",5,2018,04,09
36,"Good hotel, ideal location and good service","This hotel is well located in Barcelona. Easy access by public transport by subway station Forum, which is basically on the subway line to main attractions of this beautiful city. Hotel staff is friendly and very helpful. Rooms are nice, clean and well organised with amazing view. It is not as crowded as the big squares downtown which is actually nice. Beach is on walking distance. A big shopping mall with plenty of shopping and food options is opposite of the hotel. Extensive breakfast with again amazing service. At the end of the day, we had some cocktails at the bar. Very impressed with of the knowledge and quality of the cocktails that were served. Definitely come back to this place ;-)",5,2018,04,09
36,Good,"Stayed at the hotel after a cruise. The hotel is 15 minutes by taxi from the port.
It’s in front of a big shopping center by the same name.
The staff was very welcoming and helpful.
The lobby is big.
The room was big and very comfortable with a view to the city and partly to the sea.
The bathroom was nice and comfortable.
Breakfast was excellent.
The shore is 5 minutes walking.
The Centre (las Rambla) is far (15 minutes by taxi).",4,2018,04,08
36,The Best Hotel,"I am very happy that I was in this hotel. As a long-term client of the Hilton Hotels, I would like to thank Mrs. Cecylia and Mrs. Angela for the perfect help in preparing a surprise for my business partner.
I would like to commend the receptionist who reported me. He was very knowledgeable and nice.
Apartment ""One Bedroom Suite"" met my expectations and is worth the price. The hotel is better than Hilton Barcelona, if you are considering a choice - choose Hilton Diagonal.

To summarize: Excellent service, great room, good breakfast - This is a really great hotel. Best wishes, Mrs. Cecylia and Mrs. Angela.

36,2 Night Stay - Fantastic,"Booked a panoramic suite with dinner direct with Hilton during their sale so got a great rate.
Arrived 2.30pm last Thursday and straight into the room which was on the 20th floor (number 2017) ... WOW. The room was a lot bigger than we thought with open entrance area, dining area with double sliding doors to the large bedroom with floor to ceiling windows looking out to the sea and some windows looked towards the city and mountains.  Bathroom was huge with bath and separate shower.  Lots of closet space.  Recently renovated and everything smelt new.  Sofa already made up for our child on arrival.
Exec. lounge downstairs & rather small but ok.  Pool opened up on the day we left so can't comment except it looked amazing as they were putting the finishing touches together.  Downside to this was that there was no outdoor seating for coffee and relaxing which was a shame as weather great.
My husband is wheat intolerant but they were fantastic with what he could eat and also had plenty of snacks available for him, even special chocs delivered to our room.
Dinner - we were the only group eating on the first night.  Staff member 'David' was exceptional - went off the menu with the wonderful tapas, so much we couldn't eat it all.  Great drinks selection from the exec. lounge self serve.  
Beds comfortable, extra touches were lovely.  Our friend had her birthday while there and cava and cake were in their room waiting.
Although not right in the city, we loved the beach more to relax - we will def be back!  Visited the shopping centre just behind and that had a good range of shops and supermarket - although this is huge!  Food items on the very lower floor.
Check-out easy.  All the staff were amazing and friendly and said goodbye as though we had been there for years.
Thank you to all the staff, we truly had an amazing stay from the White family.",5,2018,04,07
36,Hilton like,"Everything was on a very good level (room, quality of food, service). Especially the reception lady ""Antonella"" was reliable and super friendly. Not to forget the bar-manager with beart and Italian roots - very attentive.

Not so nice: During the booking there was so remarks that the pool was closed during our stay. Plus, the Executive Lounge opening hours were different than stated on the Hilton Website.",4,2018,04,04
36,A Superb Stay - Service was Exceptional,"I've been fortunate to stay in excellent Hilton properties across 3 continents. Along the way, I have experienced truly wonderful service (I.e., Prague) from caring Hilton team members. Well, this Hilton is right up there in memorable stays - due to the staff. Thank you Hilton. I'd like to specifically thank Maeitxell, Thalita, and the male Front Desk Supervisor for outstanding service - details below. A wonderful stay and we hope to see you again in the near future.

As with most of my reviews, the Good, the Okay, and the Ugly.

The Good.
1. I checked in via the application and arrived at the hotel around 15:00. We were warmly greeted, checked in and into our room within 10 minutes.
2. The room - 2008. This corner room was very nice. The floor and room appeared recently renovated with nice finishes. A large room, with kingsize bed, large bathroom with tub and shower - and great views. What's not to like. I liked the silence most at night. This room also had the small touches - E.g., USB ports next to each side of bed. Well done.
3. Service. First - the executive lounge is being refurbished and it was located in the main lobby. No large deal, we just like to sit and unwind after a day of being out and about. Team Member Maeitxell (I hope I'm spelling that correctly) warmly greeted my wife, young child, and I - giving us the run down for everything we needed to know. She was so nice, and spoke to our daughter with a smile and made her feel super welcome. Thank you! Second - Thalita as the dining room host. What a smile and warm welcome, and again great touch with our daughter. Thalita remembered her name on the subsequent days which made her feel like a queen (the Easter chocolate may have helped too. :) ).
4. Front Desk Staff and Service - we spoke the front desk one morning to get some local insights on our plans. The gentleman, who I believe was the Assistant Front Desk Supervisor gave us some excellent insights - and even recommended we NOT partake in a site we had planned. I appreciated the honesty and we followed his advice to the point and everything he mentioned was great. On a second occasion we requested an extra blanket and before I had ""...ket"" out of my mouth, the female employee was on the phone making the request. Wow! Thank you Front Desk Staff!
5. Breakfast - we ate both in the lounge and dining room. Food was good as you'd expect with a little something for every taste.
6. Location - we debated about staying here because it was a bit out of the center. Be we loved it. The metro stop was a 5-minute stroll away and this hotel kind of offered an oasis from the madness of the city center. Located in a nice neighborhood, we found the mall and local offerings quite nice. We would stay here again.
7. Closeness to beach - while unfortunately the Mediterranean was a bit cold for us, the 3-minute stroll to the beach was nice. We enjoyed walks and people watching. There was also a football pitch along the beach where we were able to enjoy some youth football play.  

The Okay / The Ugly
1. Believe me that I am trying to find something to improve upon.....this Hilton is a great property - and it's the Hilton Staff that make it that way. Our room was great, as were the facilities in general. Breakfast was good, rooms were well maintained and cleaned each day - all things you expect. But the staff made a very good stay, and exceptional stay.

Thank you Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona! The leadership team has a ton to be proud of with such a great team in place. We hope to see you again soon - hopefully in the warmer months when we can take advantage of the great-looking pool facilities. Until then, all the best.

Jeremy",5,2018,04,02
36,Wonderful stay,"Stayed here recently while on a conference. Very convenient as conference centre was next door to the hotel. Room was large, clean and lovely. Breakfast was really excellent with lots of choice. The staff were all welcoming and polite. It’s a bit out of the centre but with good transport links. Would definitely stay here again!",5,2018,04,01
36,5* From Start to Finish!,"We booked this hotel which was slightly more than our budget, but we used our HHonor points to pay for 1 night.
We were contacted by the hotel prior to arrival to request our passport details to make sure check-in was quicker.
As HHonor members we could choose our room the day before arrival and we picked Room 907 (which was a Twin room), as it had city/mountain views and sea views!

We got a message via the App, asking us to go to the check-in desk on arrival. We arrived and were checked in straight away, he confirmed our details and seen we paid part HHonor points, he then included breakfast for the both of us for our entire stay, which was a great touch, and saved us so much money on our trip.

Rooms were spacious and very clean. We had a twin room (2 beds), bathroom was large with a bath and shower and also very clean.
The view from the room was amazing, sea view and also a view of the city and mountains. Room had a safety deposit box (Laptop size), this was free to use.

All staff we encountered were VERY helpful and friendly, and nothing was too much effort for them.

Breakfast was on the 1st floor and plenty to choose from, waffles and pancakes available on request (made to order) and tasted amazing.
Fresh juices and hot drinks. 
Breakfast buffet, was cakes, pastries, toast and preserves, ham and cheeses, quiches, fruit, bacon, sausages, beans etc.

The hotel was very quiet, and there was no outside noise, which gave a great nights sleep, we did have some loud guests at 1am the last evening, but after they had slammed there door about 5 times and spoke on the phone in the hallway, they went into their room, nothing to do with the hotel just a quick comment. I'm sure if we mentioned to reception, they would have dealt with promptly.

The hotel had a gym and pool, which we didn't use.

Opposite the hotel is Diagonal Mar shopping centre, which had a food court and shops. Outside the hotel there is a stop for the public buses and the sightseeing buses.
A block away for the Metro and/or Trams.

This hotel was amazing, slightly out for the main town, but public transport is easy to use. Thanks to everyone at Hilton Diagonal Mar for a great Easter break.",5,2018,03,31
36,Great modern hotel,"The hotel is clean, modern hotel within a couple minutes walk to the beach. The staff is super friendly and helpful and the corner suite has a gorgeous view of the city. Only reason I only have it four stars is it’s distance from downtown and a lot of the major historic sights. (But if that’s what you’re looking for, then this is perfect.)",4,2018,03,29
36,What you'd expect from a Hilton...,"Clean room, friendly staff, great location for the conference centre, and easy access to the city centre via the metro. Shopping centre opposite is good, with a few bars and places to eat. Only down side was a rather odd smell in the street outside, there were road works ongoing when I was there, so may have been related to that? Otherwise great.",4,2018,03,28
36,Great location for families,"Right across from a shopping centre with a playground, this well furnished hotel with excellent service was a great place to land with a 2 year old. Stay a few days to help get over jet lag. Near the beach, a metro stop and the tram. ",5,2018,03,28
36,WOW just Amazing - Mary Jane,"We were overnighting prior to joining a cruise ship for our 50th wedding anniversary trip. We were treated like like royalty (without all the bowing and fawning) right from our arrival.  Very superior room, duck down pillows, birthday treats, and bottle of bubbly with chocolates/strawberry's awaiting for us.  In the exec lounge we were again treated to complimentary cocktail + chocolate/strawberries. Not just for us, but we were then treated to the Earth festival in the lounge/bar area when the lights were dimmed and we enjoyed an hour of really wonderful cello + acoustic guitar music and song. Just we were leaving we received a cake, chocolate and strawberry candle lit treat.  Best personal hotel experience ever - and I have stayed in many 4 & 5 star hotels around the Northern hemisphere. Mary Jane (Meeitxell in Catalonian) specifically was an absolute treasure in the effort she went to to help us celebrate.  Many many thanks to all the hotel staff for making our short stay so memorable.",5,2018,03,25
36,Excellent stay,We had a excellent stay. One night but everything was good from the beginning. Reception was extremely welcome and helpful. Room 902 was really clean. Housekeeping done a great job. Room service boy was really polite and been very helpful. Breakfast was fantastic full of choices. And it's really good when you see the chef coming out to check the food and  top up all. Staff was excellent. ,5,2018,03,23
36,Great location and hospitality combined with modern seaview rooms has made our stay perfect ,"Thanks so much for the great hospitality of especially the breakfast team and also for making the stay with our 10-month year old girl so easy and enjoyable. The hotel location is great, easy getting to the city and quick to the beach. The new modernized rooms especially with the seaview are great. Only the cleanliness of the rooms could be improved (e.g. dust on the floor). Otherwise we'll definitely come back here.",5,2018,03,23
36,Very nice stay.,"A very nice hotel in a high quality. Staff, service and rooms where very nice. The hotel was placed in a good area close to the sea. Just on the other side of the road, there were several different restaurants to choose. A big mall was only 300 meters from the hotel. ",5,2018,03,22
36,This is one of the best Hilton hotels we've stayed at,"From the front desk staff, the property amenities, bellman (Ivanov is fantastic) the breakfast restaurant staff and quality, this stay couldn't be better. There is a mall across the street with plenty of places to eat and shop. There was never a time when taxis weren't lined up and ready to take us anywhere in the city. Typically about 10 euros to Las Rambles, Cataluña circle or the Gaudi cathedral. A fantastic property in a great city. We were on a cruise and it was a quick ride from the port and the airport. We wouldn't even think twice about staying here again when in Barcelona  ",5,2018,03,20
36,Wonderful Property - though slightly messed up reservation,"This hotel is simply wonderful.  Staff attentive, food delicious.  Some harped that the executive lounge was closed - really? - you can't blame them for remodeling in the slow season.  What we found especially useful was the large mall directly across the street - with some 45 restaurants.  And a 2 minute walk through the mall puts you right at the Tram stop,

Our reservation was slightly messed up in that I had requested a 3rd floor room for months - and received assurance that it would be so - only to find out at check-in our room was given away.  The 5th floor sufficed - but not without trepidation.

The beach - the Mediterranean Sea was 5 minute walk - and pleasant.  Museum of Natural Science one block away.",5,2018,03,19
36,Hilton at City Fringe,My room from the hotel high floor has a commanding view of the Mediterranean sea with breathtaking sunrise colour in the morning at the far horizon. Comfortable hotel. The only disappointment is the low water pressure from the show and suboptimal bathroom amenities.,3,2018,03,19
36,Nice Hotel near the beach,We stayed here in december 2017 and had a great time. The hotel is not directly located in the city center but the center is easily to reach by public transport system. The beach is in walking distance. We received an upgrade to an executive room with lounge acess. The happy hour snacks and drinks were good and the lounge terrace was awesome with lovely view above the city. I had the best cesar salad with prawns ever in the restaurant. We can recommend the hotel.,4,2018,03,17
36,6 stars,"What an amazing hotel.. this hotel is what it is because of the staff.. the staff are incredible!
As a diamond member (booked 3 nights via points), got given room 2208- amazing views of the sea.. and early check in and late check out- thank you!!
The exec lounge was in the lobby.. really really good.. good drinks and food and the staff are very friendly.
The hotel is opposite a mall that has good restaurants and a large supermarket.
The hotel is a 30/40 minute walk (along the beach) to the arts hotel / casino- we did this walk everyday - loved it!
The breakfast in the hotel was very very good- high quality.
The gym is small but adequate.
I will def be back at this hotel- very impressed!",5,2018,03,17
36,Fabulous hotel,"This was one of the absolute nicest Hiltons I have had the privilege of staying in. I believe the rooms have recently been refurbished, and mine blew me away! I was upgraded as an Honors member and had beautiful views out over the ocean, a huge comfy bed and a spotlessly clean bathroom. Every single member of staff I encountered was helpful, professional and smiling - truly hospitable in every sense of the word. I'd like to highlight Revaz who helped me with my luggage, ordered my taxi and was a true delight. I will absolutely be back at this hotel!",5,2018,03,15
36,High floor renovated room is very nice.  Opposite big shopping mall. Easy tram (light rail) access.,"Very nice and spacious room.  Newly renovated (higher floors) with modern style.  

Good executive lounge.  Hot finger food at dinner time, with wine.  Could be packed at peak time.

Huge shopping mall opposite, including supermarket.  There's a huge Zara and also Massimo Dutti (if you are looking for Spanish brands) and other mass brands. Also food court & restaurants.

There's a tram (light rail) station just outside the other side of the mall which is convenient and simple for tourist to take.  You can buy ""10 trips@10.4 euro"" ticket at the tram station ticket machine (Bus only sell single ticket which is 2.4 euro).

Breakfast is very good overall.  Just the fried egg and scramble egg can be enhanced.

One point would like to reflect to the management.  Before my arrival, I have written 3 times (one through HH, 2 written directly to your hotel email) with regard to the hotel rate issue.  I am disappointed that I received no reply even on my arrival date.  Then my wife bring the (no) correspondence issue during our check in.  I am glad to see your team was sincere in rectifying the rate issue on spot.  So I am still a happy customer at the end.  As a loyal Hilton customer, I would be even more happy if you reply by email beforehand of your proposed resolution which I would gladly accept... rather than a grumpy customer checking in...",4,2018,03,15
36,Spectacular views,We had an amazing view of the sea and our room was excellent.  The staff were very helpful and friendly. Close to the convention center. The Executive Lounge breakfast was pretty good but the evening selection of food was limited.,5,2018,03,13
36,Post cruise relaxaing stay,We stayed for two nights after our Mediterranean cruise. The hotel is in a superb location. The rooms are clean and spacious and the staff are friendly and helpful. Would definitely stay again. We had our three year old with us and she was made very welcome. Breakfast was superb. ,5,2018,03,08
36,Great premises,"Great hotel in nice location nearby the sea, good rooms with nice views. Really friendly staff can help you with any kind of problem - taxi or medical patch :-).
Standard breakfast, but the great quality. Coffee-to-go with fruits will help you survive till lunch time.
Taxi in Barca is not expensive so you can get from hotel to city center or Port Olympic easily.",5,2018,03,04
36,Barco Break,"This Hilton is an oasis of excellence in Barcelona. It is a bit out of the mix on the NorthEast side of the city, but the tradeoff is that you are at a peaceful location near the ocean. The lounge is exceptional and the staff very friendly. Be prepared to take a bit longer to get around from this location.",5,2018,03,03
36,Great!,"Location, design and service are great!  Very nice redesigned rooms, amazing view, delicious breakfast and very pleasant staff! Many thanks to Helena,  Leon, Revaz and Elisa! Keep cool! Hasta la proxima! :)",5,2018,02,24
36,Can’t wait to come back,"I had an outstanding experience. Fantastic hotel with terrific amenities. Staff went above and beyond at all times to help with food storage, transportation issues and advice regarding sites to visit. ",5,2018,02,22
36,Top shelf.,"I stayed downtown at the beginning of an extended tour of Spain and here at the end.  The first place was great for being in the middle of it all (I arrived the day that independence was declared).  This place was great for a relaxing stay at the end of a long month of crowds.  Some of my companions went over to the subway and went back into the thick of it (a quick trip).  I preferred visiting the beach and marina and wandering the local neighborhood.  We had a great final dinner across the street at the mall.  The hotel is classy.  The lobby nice, the rooms smaller, but very well appointed.  I had an upgrade because of my Honors/Amex status and was on a higher floor with views from the pickle to the mountains (fantastic during/after sunset).  Clean, quiet, relaxing.  Perfect before the hassle of flying home.  A bit far from the airport, but transportation was fast.",5,2018,02,19
36,"Excellent location, especially if you want to avoid the summer crowds","Great location - only a 10 minute walk to the nearest metro stop, which takes you directly into the centre of the city. Less then 5 mins from a clean, crowdless beach and about 15min walk to the Olympic port. There is also a large shopping mall opposite the hotel. The rooms were large and very clean and there was an excellent buffet breakfast with loads of choice. Before the stay I was a little concerned about the trendy pool area with DJ. However, there was no need to be concerned, we were given free sun loungers and my nine year old daughter was welcome in the pool area. We chose a room on the opposite side of the hotel to the pool area, to ensure we were not disturbed. I would definitely stay at this hotel again.",4,2018,02,18
36,Excellent option for a non-touristic visit,"A hotel meant for people not wanting to be in the tourist amusement part that Barcelona city centre has become. You are close to the sea, you can have some walks, you have a shopping mall in front of the hotel and inside the hotel you have everything to stay in if you don´t want to go out. Service is very professional and very friendly, if it happens you can enjoy the executive lounge you will enjoy good views. The only bad thing I can say it is the breakfast, low quality for a hotel of this category and",4,2018,02,05
36,Great holiday spot,"Our stay in this hotel was short, only one night, but memorable. Allready few days before, executive loung team wrote to me and asked, what they can do to me. And they did their best: inspite, we arrived 30 minutes after happy hour, best Catalonian snacks and tapas were waiting for us and very good local red wine. Special thanks to Cecilia Lopez, executive lounge supervisor, who treated us very warmly, who very kindly gave recommendations about Barcelona and surroundings. Really, this team knows, how to treat guests!!!
Executive lounge has nice view to the sea and over all, this is very nice and good condition Hilton. Defenitly come back and for longer time during next holidays.",5,2018,02,05
36,"renewed rooms. Quality service , friendly environment","I stayed in this hotel 5 days for business.
Unfortunately i didnt have chance to have the breakfast but overall experience was more than satisfactory.
I had a room at 22nd floor with nice view and renewed furnitures.
THe view was amazing. I thank the hotel management for this room.

The hotel is at the end of diagonal and not in the city center.
It is 5 min walking to metro station so transport is very easy.
Also there is a taxi stop in front of the hotel so that you never challenge with lack of taxis which is the common case in Barcelona. Taxi costs around 20 € to city center. 

There is also a shopping mall just across the street with variety of good restaurants.

Only problem i encountered is, as a gold HHonor member i need to have 2 bottles of water every day. But the reception refused it. They said it is for total stay which is wrong with the hilton policy. Anyway , it is not a big deal. I truly recommend this hotel.",4,2018,02,04
36,Good stay for business trip,"Stayed at this hotel for five nights when attending a conference at the centre next door.  Had an Executive sea view room.  Room was on the side of the hotel so limited view of the sea from the main part of the room, but still a Sea view!!  Room was quiet and good standard as you would expect from a Hilton Hotel.  Really good choice at breakfast and couldn't fault the serving staff, very professional and efficient.  Hotel is a great location for the conference and the Diagonal Mar shopping centre, but not much more in then area so a taxi or tram is needed to visit the rest of Barcelona.  Ticked all the boxes for what I was after though.",4,2018,02,04
36,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona,"Overall good experience. Friendly staff. Good views from rooms on either side.
Awesome breakfast and the breakfast staff.
The restaurant food was also very tasty.
I wish they had a vending machine for snacks and cool drinks.",4,2018,02,03
36,Regular business visit,"This is the best of the Hiltons in Barcelona, new refurbished rooms, excellent business lounge that opens at 0600 👍

This hotel takes care of it’s HHonors members very well and untill now i have not been dissapointed.

Metro on walking distance, shopping mall across the street
beach nearby and so are some good restaurants like on the rambla the poble nou.

I will even go here this summer for a private visit !",4,2018,02,02

The room was big and very clean. 
very good breakfast..",4,2018,02,01
36,Amazing Barcelona ,"This hotel and Barcelona just amazing. This hotel is just near to the sea side and lots of near by restaurants n bar to enjoy. Also visit Barcelona FCB football stadium and sangrias familia. 

I would recommend this hotel as it’s price is quite good and hotel rooms are too good. You can ask for the sea view room as well. ",5,2018,01,31
36,Exceptional service,"Stayed at this property for 6 nights. The first 4 were business then I remained for personal time.  The staff was amazing and the hotel exceptionally clean and efficient. The rooms were great and the service was excellent.  Every time I had a request of the staff they met my need (except for an umbrella) - however, apparently rain is rare there so it would not be expected.",5,2018,01,30

36,Fabulous find in Barcelona!,"We loved this hotel, firstly the staff were great and very welcoming . The hotel was spotless and the rooms spacious. The pool and bar were amazing... beautiful beautiful place with immaculate service. The executive lounge was brilliant.. great views and a great selection of food and drinks all day. Happy hour was fantastic... drinks and food with great views.",5,2018,01,24
36,Wonderful stay,"This hotel is one of the best I ever stayed around the world. The team is amazing. They care about details and they always add the personal touch while serving the Guest that let you feel home away of your home. The girls and boys in restaurant could not do anymore. They are very warm in welcoming, smiling and touch base with guests during breakfast. The lady in lobby lounge during the dinner was extremely helpful . She went-out of line and recommended   Some site seeings which were brilliant. This people really represented the Hilton value in a real model.  The hotel location and view could not be better. Overlooking to the sea with wonderful relaxed atmosphere. Gym is very nice with all relevant equipment. Breakfast varieties are wide and met the International taste.keep up the great work.",5,2018,01,24
36,Great stay in Barcelona,"I had a great stay at this Hilton property. The staff was super friendly. Upon arrival I got an early check in and upgrade (I am Hilton Diamond) which was nice. I visited the happy hour in the lounge during the evening and they had lots of nice snacks, some hot food and nice drinks (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic). The room was really nice and I had view towards the ocean. During the evening they knocked on my door and gave me a small box of chocolate which was a nice surprise. They also called me during my stay, just to make sure eveything was fine. The only down side with this hotel is the location. But hey, they have several options for transportation close to the hotel. Tram, metro and bus. During my weekend in Barcelon I also stayed at the other Hilton hotel. Diagonal Mar is way better! Will definetly stay here again.",5,2018,01,21
36,Nice hotel but Fitness Center needs some help,"I have been staying here fairly regularly as doing a lot of Business in Barcelona and its near you.  Overall stay, has been fine but your fitness center needs some attention.  Last monday I was there and at 6:30am it was busy but your water cooler was empty, the disinfectant on the wall is always empty, your Bozo ball does not have enough air in it, your two work out balls don't have enough air in them.  And while you cannot fix this overnight (well you actually could with Amazon) 10 Kilo max dumbbells are not enough weight for most men to work out with.  Most Hiltons and Doubeltrees that have gyms have more but if you fix the other things at this point I will be happy.  Thank you",4,2018,01,18
36,Great central location to food and mall,"We stopped here for one night before we boarded our cruise with Royal Caribbean. We stayed at the Hilton Diagonal Mar. The mall was just across the road, with restaurants around the outside. It wasn't hard to find something to eat or get a taxi to the boat terminal in the morning. Great service from the hotel staff and lovely rooms",5,2018,01,14
36,Excellent location and lovely hotel,"We stayed here for a short break, the hotel was lovely and clean, the bed was very comfortable and all the staff were very helpful. Would highly recommend staying at this hotel. The location was perfect for us, the weather was beautiful so we walked everywhere. ",5,2018,01,13
36,Great New Years Eve Long Weekend,"This hotel is a little way from the city but taxis are always available and the metro station is a 5 minute walk at Rambla de Prim. We used the metro as it was only 20 mins into the city. The metro also stops at various beach areas on the way at Poble Nou, Ciutadella/Port Olympic and La Barceloneta. Tip.. get a T10 ticket it costs less than one Euro per journey. E9.90 for 10 trips and can be used by more than one person each time. 
          The hotel is what you would expect from a four star Hilton, the staff were very helpful and courteous. We had a nice room on the 14th floor with sea views and fabulous views from the lift area of the city. The only problem we encountered was probably because it was a holiday period the room housekeeping was not attended to until late afternoon around 4.40pm.
           There is a lovely shopping centre opposite the hotel with a large Plaza type open area with restaurants around it. Inside a lot of the usual high street brand shops and restaurants, the centre is not quite yet finished with some of the final detail being worked on but as it was a holiday time there aws no disruption at all. Don't let the short distance to the city put you off this hotel as being in a quiet modern area it was nice to come back to the quiet after a busy day in the city.",4,2018,01,08
36,Good hotel,"Friendly staff and nice hotel. 

Location was a bit of a mix. A little far out of the centre but close to the beach, so depends what is most important during your staff. 

Executive lounge was great with amazing views of the city. 

Probably will stay at the other Hilton if I ever return to Barcelona but would recommend to anyone wanting to stay near the beach in summer.",4,2018,01,07
36,Call and Ask About Construction First,"The hotel feels like it's not ready for prime time. Instead of an upgrade (I'm HHonors Diamond), at check in I got a downgrade and was told that despite what I booked (a King room) and what the Hilton website said were available rooms that very minute for the duration of my stay, none were available due to construction. 

After complaining again on day 2, I got ""upgraded"" to a new room (which looked like what I booked in the first place!) but which was on a floor that was clearly under construction. Twice each of the first two days construction workers walked into my room unannounced and without even knocking, once he brought a ladder in, did not even notice me (thank god, cause I was in bed), and started working in the bathroom. After the first two days they stopped coming in unannounced and instead were loudly doing construction in the adjacent rooms from early in the morning until around 7pm or later. Another night something started banging at about 1am and initially the front desk tried to convince me I was hearing things because ""we aren't doing construction right now."" Eventually they figured out the banging, but ""we are under construction right now"" was the excuse for everything. 

Even being under construction, the service was not excellent. Water was not replaced in the mini-bar every day. The jets in the tub never worked despite several maintenance calls and front desk assurances of attention. The bubbler in the tub was possessed by demons and started on its own once at about 3:30am and again when we were gone so that it was running when we got back from a day in the city. 

The elevators were also clearly not working right. Regularly the light would say up and they'd go down, or they'd stop twice on the same floor and suddenly stop going up and start going down again (or vice versa). Everyone was commenting on it.

Was it in the grand scheme of things a terrible hotel? No. We loved Barcelona and the front desk staff were nice and polite, despite clearly not having much ability to DO anything except apologize for being under construction. The hotel is also quite pretty with good views. 

But the problem is if the hotel is going to be crippled due to construction, there should be a WARNING on the website before booking. I know it's possible because I've seen it before from Hilton properties. Had I known, I would have probably spent my points and $ at the other Hilton in Barcelona instead of the Diagonal.",2,2018,01,07
36,Great hotel ,"Lovely hotel very close to the beach promenade and only 5 minute walk to the underground. Stayed in a nice suite with lovely views and enjoyed complimentary access to the executive lounge. The staff in the lounge were incredibly friendly and there was a nice selection of drinks and snacks available to guests. The lounge is a fairly good size and it also has a very large outside terrace giving great views. 
I had breakfast in the main restaurant which was very good indeed and again I have to say the friendliness of the staff was second to none, with particular mention to one of the female breakfast staff ( an American woman whose name I cannot recall ) who was particularly helpful and approachable to everyone. Nothing was too much trouble to her.
I used the nearby underground to travel around and bought the 10 journey ticket for 10 euros which was great value. Visited the Sagrada familia which was astonishing and if you go to Barcelona you must go and see this. Book tickets online in advance though otherwise you will have either a very long wait or not get access at all if its very busy.
",5,2018,01,06
36,Renovated Rooms,"Stayed in this property for the 2nd time and now that the hotel is getting older , they have rolled out their room renovation and the new ones look really great. Got an upgraded room to a suite being their top tier Honors Diamond member. The Executive Floor lounge was very busy , packed with no seats. The reason is that beverage and food selection is very extensive. Staff are very friendly and accommodating, great service. Breakfast selection in the Lounge is also great. Thx hotel has great views to the sea and located in front of a big shopping mall which helps as need to keep in mind the location is not downtown and s but far from the main tourist attractions. ",5,2018,01,06
36,Un professional ,"I stayed here in this place with my wife and daughters  for three days in new year.atAt 7:30 on the day of departure ;I found a guy coming to my room pushing at the door!! The reason is that I smoke in my room,and this is a non smoking hotel. He said to me that there is a penalty ,and I told him that I will pay it!!i came at reception at 8:30 and I found the penalty 100 euro;and I paid it.
The question is not the penalty,because I smoked;so I have to pay.
The question is how you come to my room,and push at the door.you can call me!!
This means that there is un professional general manager who know nothing about hospitality,to let a guy at reception come at room pushing at door,with no distrub on the door!!
You want to take the 100 euro;I will give to you,but not pushing at my door at 7:30!!
By the way;I was Hilton honors diamond;but when I found that the gm of double tree is the same as Hilton diagonal Barcelona;I never go for Hilton except for low prices;and you were low!!!
",1,2018,01,06
36,Old hotel and unexpected issues,"Bad mattress, bad aircondition m, no complimentary water bottles, bumpy wooden floor and old carpet, the hotel looked nice but it was the worst expereince of staying in hilton around the worl. Would not recommend",1,2018,01,06
36,Barcelona,"Great hotel across from the mall. Great executive lounge. Our room is renovated corner room, an upgraded because of my Gold status. Staff was welcoming and helpful! They paid attention to your needs, as they delivered a complimentary hot tea when they know I was sick! Thank you! ",5,2018,01,02
36,Barcelona!,The property is beautiful..great rooms with ocean view. The executive lounge staff was very attentive and provided great service. The metro is only a few blocks away and gets you to the heart of the city in less than 20 minutes. I would definitely stay at the property again.,5,2018,01,02
36,Wonderful stay at Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona,"Such a lovely holidays which we stay in this hotel. All the staffs was friendly and helpful. We have a corner suit with cleanest and comfortable room with breakfast on our stay. Surprising was the  complementary truffles, sweetie and drinks in our room when we check in.

Even the location is not too close to the city, but opposite have shopping complex and restaurants/food courts and along the road have 24 hours taxi services,convenience .",5,2017,12,30
36,Good hotel base to explore Barcelona,"It takes 1 hour 15 mins to get from the airport to El Maresme Forum. Get the BCN Hola to have unlimited travel for a few days - it covers transport to/from airport. Take the L9 from the airport and change at Torassa for the L1 (towards Fondo). I suggest you use the lift to save time and hassle at the interchange. Interchange at Urquinaona for the L4 (to La Pau). Get off at El Maresme Forum. At the station it is 5 - 10 mins walk to the hotel. Need to pass by/through the shopping centre.

We took the estandby upgrade for the executive room. Note that King Sea View and Executive room are semi-sea view only - three buildings block the view somewhat. On our first night, as we entered the Lounge, the female staff member challenged our access to the Lounge in front of other guests - was somewhat embarrassing. She really should have handled that better. We went downstairs to explain what had happened and the male front office staff member apologised. That incident put us off eating breakfast in the Executive Lounge.

Breakfast at the Executive Lounge was very good. It was our 4th Hilton this year and the variety and tastes were great. I must commend Amelia who made us feel very welcomed and gave us a map for places to visit. She also made very good tea for us. We were very happy to see her for breakfast every day. On our last day, she was off work and breakfast was chaotic - lack of cutlery and food. Hotel need to sort out staffing on weekends.

The executive lounge was good for tea and light dinner. The choices were limited, but fine. Islam and the young smiling waitress made us feel very welcomed. Some of the other staff were sometimes indifferent, especially that staff member who had singled us out that night. What we could not understand was why many other guests were not checked for access to lounge? Especially as you needed specially card access using the lift.

I believe their IT needs to be sorted out for communication. We were give late check-out for 1 extra hour and our cards were modified - however access was cut at 12, rather than 1. There was a tourist tax on top of our stay. This should have been notified to us prior to booking and estandby upgrades.

The hotel is situated next to a big shopping centre and its proximity to the beach for strolls is very good. The room quality was good, but I have to say that the Double Tree in Edinburgh was of a better quality. Service could have been more consistent amongst all staff, not just the half. Many thanks to Amelia, Islam and the smiling friendly waitress (Executive Lounge) who made us feel welcomed.",3,2017,12,30
36,Great hotel if you are ok with using the metro,"Good facilities and decent rooms.  The location is bit far from the city centre, but shouldn't be a problem if you are ok with using the metro.  The shopping centre next door is handy: a choice of places to eat and a supermarket.  You also get to see the 'real Barcelona citizens' since the hotel is surrounded by residential blocks - ranging from 'ordinary' to 'new riches'.",4,2017,12,30
36,Great rooms,I was upgraded to a suite and it had an incredible view of ocean and city. The place was clean and upscale. The quality of breakfast was good but I have been to Hiltons with more options. Short walk to subway. No complaints.,5,2017,12,28
36,Disappointed,"This place smelled on our floor. They preauthorized charges on my credit card 2 1/2 months before my stay. They promised me a sea view room on a high floor with an arrival detail, but never got anything but a piece of cake and a bottle of champagne and I don't drink.",1,2017,12,27
36,Great Stay at Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona,The Entire staff at Hotel really take cares of you ... we would be happy to be here again ...and again...and would like to bring lot of groups here....We would recommend for your next stay to all our Friends and Clients.,4,2017,12,22
36,Convenient and Comfortable,"A very good hotel -- not a luxury hotel, but pretty close! Not located in the historic center of the city, but offering easy access to Barcelona's excellent metro system by way of which you can easily make your way to just about anything you would wish to see.. The concierge is exceptional and will help you secure tickets and passes to whatever you'd like to do or see. It happened that my watchband became detached while in Barcelona, and the concierge directed me to a nearby department store where the watch repair boutique fixed it at no charge. The rooms are spacious and handsomely decorated with elegant bath rooms. The service is efficient and friendly. The breakfasts are exquisite, and on the day of our homebound flight they fixed us a ""box breakfast"" since we had to depart for the airport before the restaurant opened.",5,2017,12,19
36,Great stay in Barcelona,"Loved this hotel!  It is beautiful and a great value...  it is easy to get to the city by taxi, tram or metro.   The staff is friendly and able to make recommendations...  especially enjoyed the executive level experience and worth the additional cost.",5,2017,12,18
36,Nice hotel close to the sea,"Stayed at Hilton for a work conference. The conference rooms can accommodate smaller to larger group (we were close to 100 pers). Problem though is the temperature in the meeting room! Seems very difficult to control the air condition system! 
The guest room are modern and nice. You have a lounge with good views on the city. 
Breakfast offered large variety of food/juice/fruit. The buffet offered for lunch and dinner were also good. 
Overall good hotel to recommend",4,2017,12,17
36,Great service,"We checked-in quite later, after midnight and Francisco was great! He upgraded us to the executive floor as we were on a Girl's holiday trip celebrating my recent promotion at work. The room was spacious, across the street from a mall where we shopped on one incredibly rainy day during our stay. 

Breakfast service was great too! There was a gentleman making smoothies -he was such a character and was so fun to chat with. He really made our experience at the property that much more amazing. I regretfully did not note his name :(

I went in March so it was too cold to hit the nearby beach and the outdoor pool was not yet opened. We went to use the sauna instead but was sadly out of order for the duration of out stay.

All in all, I quite enjoyed my trip and would return to beautiful Barcelona in a heartbeat.",5,2017,12,15
36,hotel,"staff lovely and efficient, rooms basic need updating. bar and food expensive. Hotel quite far from city and aiport 30min. shower leaked everywhere, although 3 people staying in room only set up for 2 i.e milk cups dressing gowns",3,2017,12,14
36,**** A birthday to remember ; Love you all at the Hilton Diagonal Mar ! ***********,"Wow!  My husband has been a Hilton  Hons.Gold member for over 15 years & we have stayed at the Hilton worldwide over the years & enjoyed their hospitality. Each stay has turned out to be  better than the previous one and this one was no different. My husband planned a quick trip to Barcelona for my birthday & our daughter's upcoming commencement from her Law School. What he did not tell me was that he had emailed the hotel regarding our arrival details, wherein he mentioned that we would be checking in on the morning of my birthday. I was truly surprised when the wonderful girl, Anais who was checking us in, looked at me and wished me, ' Happy Birthday'!  Surprised indeed!  But the best was yet to come.  We went up to our room and when I opened the room, Wow!  There was a ' Birthday set up' with balloons,, cake and sparkling wine. Anyone can imagine that this is a birthday we will remember for a long long time; thanks to Antonella Leoni, who had exchanged emails with my husband.  Anais was extremely helpful, informative, professional and very very pleasant,  The Executive Lounge staff was very nice as well. I should not forget to mention Ms. Ana at the Reception too, who said to take care of our modified reservation.  All in all, this is a wonderful hotel, with an equally wonderful staff!  It is close to the beach and close to Metro station. We are already looking forward to visiting Barcelona in Summers since December was cold. Gives us a reason to make another trip.  Thank you Antonella, Anais, Ana & the staff in the Executive Lounge on the 15th Floor !  You all are amazing and I hope that your superiors recognize the wonderful job you do!!  Merry Christmas & a Very Happy New Year - 2018 to you all !!",5,2017,12,12
36,Nicely maintained and great atmosphere,"Hilton Diagonal Mar has known over the years to maintain a great level of service with new offering to give you a great experience.
The rooms have been refurbished very well, functional and clean, with all comfort.
Breakfast spread is amazing with an excellent quality of food and service.
At the bar, nice atmosphere with a new area where you can enjoy a few tapas and light bites! 
Great place to stay away from the buzzing city centre.",4,2017,12,09
36,hilton diangonal,the hotel room was clean and tidy the staff were polite and willing to help good food for breafast overall a pleasant experience would recommend this hotel for business or for a holiday as it is close to public transport and a short trip to the center of barcelona,5,2017,12,07
36,One of the best hotels in Barcelona ,"I am Hilton person and last year I stayed at the other Hilton. This time I decided to come here and was a great choice for me. 

The hotel location is great. Very close to B10 highway so I was able to get to my meeting fast. Their rooms was spacious and the bathroom were too. 

The bar in the lobby was cool, also the executive lounge. They had great selection of drinks and snack at the lounge so if you a Hilton member you should come here. 

The restaurant on the 1st floor where they serve breakfast was great too. I will review it separately. 

Highly recommended hotel to stay in the city. ",5,2017,12,06
36,Stay in hotel Hilton Barcelona,"I have been for first time in this hotel. I attaend the meeting in Building near the hotel Hilton. My imression for this hotel is very high. Very good hotel, clean rooms. Acceptable price, Perfect breakfast. Location is close to metro station Forum and bus H16 in this way to reach the hotel every place in Barcelona is not problem.",5,2017,12,05
36,Just OK,"The location was not ideal, unless you’re doing the beach, which we weren’t in December.
My room was on one of the floors that hadn’t been renovated so it was worn and tired. My friends had an upgraded room which was nicer.
I could hear full conversations coming from the hallway so it was difficult to sleep as just regular talking voices carried through the door.
The maid showed up the first night to grab my water pot for coffee. She sprayed it with windex (or the Spanish version of windex) and put it in her laundry basket with everyone else’s and spoke zero English so I didn’t know if she was bringing it back or what. Plus it didn’t appeal to me to make coffee after the pot had been sprayed with windex. 
Bed OK, very firm. Decent pillows. No usb plug for phones or iPads so bring an extra European plug.
Executive lounge food for breakfast was good (basic) and there was a variety. Cocktail hour was nice too and they switched up the offerings, which is appreciated after several days. Nice view from the deck.
Staff was great throughout. Nice lobby and decor. Location was too far from the quaint and charming areas and older part of town. There’s a mall across the street, but it has a mcDonalds in it so.....it’s basically a suburban mall. Lots of stores and fast food,  no cool bars or decent restaurants there. Go elsewhere.
In the end I wouldn’t stay here again because of the location and my room.
",3,2017,12,04
36,Seeing Barcelona,"Great location! directly across the street from a nice shopping mall, away from noisy tourist areas, with just a short walk to the beach and metro station.  The breakfast was top quality And the staff was very helpful.  ",5,2017,12,03
36,Just as expected,"Fine High quality hotel. Nice room, good service close to big shooping mall and beautuful beach. no surprices, like any other Hilton hotel. the breakfast is fine but a little boring. the view from my room in 7th floor not as good as expected. beers in the bar us totally overpriced. Far from the city center but the walk to town along the beach is just wonderful.

36,nice hotel but terrible services,I was charged two times the same amount for hotel stay by the mistake. No proper apologies before I started really arguing and complaining...I got my money back only after 5 days...there were some other issues with the reception/front office...,1,2017,11,30
36,Hilton,"This hotel is based beside the conventional center . It’s a great place if you got meetings or es t to be a little bit out of Barcelona , however taxi to go around is the best option . Breakfast is very the best in this place that’s why I put 3 . The rooms pretty upsetting they charge you to have a sea view for the price of the room and when you do you don’t even have the access to the lounge . Staff check you in without reading instructions on the booking . Hilton is not really lean o. The concept yet ! ",3,2017,11,29
36,Below expectations,"Expected the quality Ive come to experience from Hilton, however had issues with the door lock keeping me out of my room twice during a five night stay. Staff tried their best, but it was lack of maintenance and battery replacement. Sounds simple but seemingly not. Also we never got the room properly equipped for a family of four even though that is what we selected and were rated for. Be prepared to share towels and not have enough pillows.",2,2017,11,29
36,Hilton Standard with Seaview,"A per fect stay, nice hotel like Hilton-style. We got an upgrade and enjoyed a wonderful room with great view. All staff really friendly and polite. Bar and food was absolutely amazing. We booked a guided tour and it was perfectly organized by the desk. We would like to give 5 points but it was not possible to change the pillows... so only 4. We'll coming back!",4,2017,11,28
36,A fab experience ,"First time staying in this hotel and the experience has been great! It is very well located in front to a very well known commercial center, that, in my case saved me because I forgot the electric adapter for my laptop and later on my charger died precisely when I was about to join a video conference. I was able to purchase all the stuff I needed in no time and continue with my agenda thanks to that.

Service is stunning and the view to the sea amazing.

Plenty of good restaurants around to try from very local food to international cuisine.

The only thing I am not crazy about is their breakfast, it was ok (don’t get me wrong) but I was expecting something extraordinary for 27 euro.

Plenty of taxis at the door, just plan yourself ahead specially if you have meetings in the city center, it can take a while to arrive there if is too much traffic.

Money well spent in this place, definitely o will recommend. 

",5,2017,11,26

36,Very nice hotel for Business,I stayed here for 2 nights and can't fault the hotel. It was for a business trip and was an excellent location for what I needed. The bar and restaurant area over the road was very pleasant also. It would have been nice to have made more of the leisure facilities and pool bar but I was too busy!!!,5,2017,11,20
36,Barcelona is a must visit for lovers of art,"Ideally located hotel. Opposite is a mall Diagonal Mar. Behind the hotel is the beach. Walking distance form park, tram station, hop on hop off bus stop, convention centre, museum etc. Fell in love with the place, people. the city stops at 9pm as the government believes that you spend time with the family. Most shopping places are closed on Sundays. No public transport, except taxis after 9pm. Every edifice is an architectural marvel. Weather is pleasant throughout the year",4,2017,11,20
36,Nice hotel with lots of nearby amenities,"I have just returned from a 3 night stay at the Hilton Barcelona for a business trip.

The room itself was really spacious with a desk area, king size bed, sea view, bath, separate shower and safe.

We asked on Thursday night if it was possible to check out any later and reception gave us an extra hour (up until 1pm) to check out on the Friday for free.

Hilton Diagonal Mar is located next to the diagonal mar shopping mall which has plenty of shops, restaurants and a large supermarket.

We took a taxi into central Barcelona and it was about €9 one way.",4,2017,11,18
36,Average Hilton ,"Very close to the convention center and there is a shopping mall with plenty shops and restaurants across from the hotel. 

This is an average Hilton, in need of an upgrade as very old fashioned.  Staff were pleasant, breakfast was average, rooms were average. 

Hilton diamond member, no upgrade, no mention of the exec lounge! ",3,2017,11,18
36,Well run hotel,"It is clean.  The best thing I like:   Wooden floor.   I don't know who invented the stupid idea of carpet:  It is dirty, hard to maintain, and bad for the health.  Only thing is the travel time from the airport is about 7 minutes longer than the other Hilton Barcelona.",5,2017,11,18
36,Just overall,"Missing sauna, pool access denied because of private event, sea view missing from self-checking option. Staff well trained and are polite but just average.  The breakfast is OK, but not great.  Good location.",3,2017,11,16
36,Excellent staff. Great Service.,"The hotel is in a beautiful building with great views of the ocean. The staff is excellent, very warm, accommodating and helpful.

36,Barcelona Weekend Trip,"This has been, thus far the best hotel I’ve ever stayed at in Europe. The location was perfect, not far from hotel and overview of the Mediterranean Sea. Doesn’t get any better than this!!!  Executive lounge was amazing great food and so much more offered. A must stay. Five stars ",5,2017,11,14
36,The best stay!,"This was one of the best hotel experiences of my life! I received an upgrade to an Executive room with breathtaking view, Lounge on 15th floor is amazing and hotel is very well located, I spent every day on the beach.. But what is the best is the staff! I can not highlight a specific name as everyone I've met was so nice and helpful and they made my birthday trip the best - even they didn't know :) Starting with a smile from everyone I've met, asking if I need help and ensuring that I'm enjoying my time during my stay - from housekeeping, reception to people from the restaurant, everyone was so friendly and professional and they made this stay memorable. I can definitely recommend, this hotel exceeded my expectations for sure!",5,2017,11,14
36,We loved this hotel!,"We stayed here because we are HILTON Diamond.  I can’t say enough positive things about the property and staff.  Every single person we encountered was great. The food was fantastic.  NOTE: the location is long walk from the city center and tourist sites.  We took cabs (30 minutes to the airport, 15 minutes to city center). Taxis are plentiful and pretty cheap.  Even with this minor inconvenience, we would stay here again we liked the hotel so much. Hotel is across the street from a huge shopping mall.  You can walk to the beach, easily, but we live in Jacksonville, FL so we weren’t here really for the beach as we have that at home. Food at the hotel is great.  We had access to the Executive Lounge as Diamond members.  Absolutely loved it. We would stay here again, no question.",5,2017,11,13
36,I liked it,"It’s in a quiet spot but that is not a bad thing as there is the green line tram behind the shopping centre which will take you to the edge of the main tourist sites and the end of the line is the port and another busy beach, it’s less than 3 euros to use it. The shopping centre is good and not expensive with lots of restaurants( it’s closed on sundays)
The hotel is big and is always surrounded by so many taxis it’s unbelievable, a taxi from the airport is usually between 33 to 36 euros unless the driver decides to take you miles in the other direction as this happened to us 50% of the time we used taxis.
We had a executive room overlooking the ocean it was a good size with a bath, shower, robes, the bed was massive and comfortable but the tv only had news channels in English, the WiFi is the best I have had in any hotel anywhere. You can only access the executive rooms in the lift using your room key in the lift. We paid for the executive lounge which has a free food and drinks from 6 till 8 and the drinks are of good quality and you just help yourself its very relaxing, the breakfast is free as well and it has an outside balcony, breakfast is till 10clock but the girl is trying to get you out before 9.30 actually taking things from your table and stood there with a spray and cloth. I would stay here again you could have a beach holiday here.",4,2017,11,13

Warning for backpackers /
I stayed in this hotel from 29th of August to 4th of September ... after returning to the USA I received a deduction for the stay .... which included the bills for the use of restaurants with some fake signature .. the price of 360.62 and the price of 322.45 . $... I do not have to explain these wastes ...? so i warned before checking out before leaving ...... from this Hotel called HILTON. ,,,, i NEVER EVER use this hotel ...... rooms dirty ..... no maid service .... food old stinking ...... so many guests enjoy the food in the city ........ as Honors Hilton decided to bring this hotel to the US .... let the Hilton Hotels in the US",2,2017,11,13
36,Way better than AC Forum,"Stayed for a conference 6 nights. Last year I stayed at AC Forum - which was underwhelming. Hilton is next door but leaps and bounds better. Fitness is good, breakfast fine, sleep quality (beds) of the remodelled rooms great. So overall: A business hotel that ticks all the marks. I would be happy to return",5,2017,11,10
36,The best hotel in Spain.,"We had a great 15 day trip to Spain visiting 10 different cities.  We finally arrived at this hotel on the last day of Barcelona and literally felt that we saved the best for the last.  I mean this hotel was really out of this world.  My wife and I loved everything about this hotel from A to Z. The room was very spacious with a fantastic ocean view on the 12th floor.  The bed was extremely comfortable, the shower was perfect, and free WiFi connection was brilliant. We had to leave early when we checked out and package breakfast was waiting for us with excellent food.  Can't think of anything to complain about.   We really had a great stay here.  If I were ever to come back to Barcelona, I would definitely consider staying here again for sure.",5,2017,11,10
36,Great hotel!,"First time in Barcelona and we didn’t want to stay right in the middle of the tourist section, so we booked here instead. It’s a great location in the business sector with a mall and restaurants across the street and an ocean view (2-5 minute walk) to the water! Approximately a 20-minute taxi ride to Los Ramblas, which costs approximately 15 euro or the subway is easily accessible for much less. The hotel is very clean, customer service was great and overall a nice, quiet place to stay. We’ll be back!",5,2017,11,09
36,"Beach, Convention, and Forum Mall are Close By","This is a good example of a quality Hilton property. Nice size rooms, good Exec Lounge with very good 6pm to 8pm Happy Hour, quality staff that are very helpful, and not that far from Historic and Gotham section of the City.

SouthEast Diagonal Hilton near the Convention Center and beach. The very large Diagonal Mall is right across the street with numerous shops and restaurants. Rooms are nice and Executive Lounge is very good with a high quality happy hour from 16:00 to 20:00. El Mareamie Metro station with a bit of a walk through the Mall (enter door 3 on the ground level and exit door 5 on the second level for the shortest walk).

Stayed at the other two Hilton properties on this trip: Alexandra Hotel is near the City square a .6 mile walk but the Passeig de Gracia Metro stop is two short blocks away if you would rather take the Metro. If you are coming from or heading to the Sanitas Train Station, use the L5 with the Diagonal station a couple of blocks away. The taxi from the station was 9 euro but the traffic is horrible. Take the R2 from the airport and connect with L5 to reach the Diagonal station.

Also stayed at NorthWest Diagonal Hilton near Barcelona University main campus which was a typical Hilton with typical sized rooms, adequate Executive Lounge, and easy access to the Maria Cristina Metro station and near the huge L'illa shopping mall with numerous restaurants.",5,2017,11,09
36,Pricey but Great Location,"Under 10 mins walk to the beach, across a shopping mall, 20 mins from main airport, 15 mins to city centre by taxi, under 10 mins walk to metro station for about 15 mins ride to town. Perfect location! 

Lovely hotel which we didn't get to explore much as we were exploring Barcelona.

Good rooms, service and breakfast. Nice executive floor and terrace too ;) 

A bit pricey but recommended if you want a little la di da break with friends.",4,2017,11,08
36,Best Hilton in their entire portfolio of hotels,I love this place - it's the best Hilton property I've come across on the globe. The property had all of the amenities of a resort and also met my needs as a business traveler. The staff was very professionally hospitable and put a lot of effort in each interaction from the rooftop pool bar to housekeeping. The location was ideal and there was lots to do within walking distance. There was nothing I didn't love about this place.,5,2017,11,08
36,My stay in Diagonal Mar Barcelona,It’s a clean Hotel. It has a Mall in front of it. The staff is very helpful . There ya no bath robs in the rooms . The gym is small . There is no spa. But it s very good . I would recommend it for stay . ,4,2017,11,07
36,Nice new hotel near the beach.,"Stayed here for 5 days from 26.10 to 02.11. Had got the 23rd floor sea facing room. Amazing view from the room. The hotel is relatively new. The rooms are big in size and clean. The restaurant serves breakfast which is very good. Has something for vegetarians too. The hotel is strategically located opposite the Diagonal Mar shopping mall. Good place to stay in Barcelona, especially if you have a convention in the convention centre which is located on a 2 minute walk.
The hotel is slightly far from the happening places in Barcelona like the Ramblas,",4,2017,11,07
36,An excellent Hilton in a great location.,"Our family enjoyed 4 wonderful nights here. 
The Manager was excellent and gave us adjoining rooms which were perfect for couples. 
The pool area was first class. 
The club lounge was delightful and the Hilton staff were fantastic and friendly to our children. 
We would recommend this to anyone. Great beds too.",5,2017,11,07
36,Awesome property in the new business area of Barcelona,We very much enjoyed the Hilton in Barcelona.  Excellent rooms and we enjoyed the executive lounge.  The views are amazing and we had a special day poolside on our last day.  Thanks to the staff for the late check out to accommodate our flights to Madrid.  Do yourself a favour and book this hotel you will not be disappointed.,5,2017,11,06
36,Decrnt,"Decent hotel, spacious enough room, very fresh, bright and airy with a good outlook. I certainly wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel although it might be a little bit out of the way for the main tourist sights. ",4,2017,11,06
36,Clean and accomodating,We did not have reservations but they had room for us and for a good price too. Rooms are large and clean. Nice restaurant and taxi service right outside.  Good free wifi. They have a very friendly staff,4,2017,11,05
36,"Great Location, Close to Cruise Port","We recently took a Mediterranean cruise out of Barcelona and chose to stay at the Hilton Diagonal.  The hotel is well-appointed and about 10 minutes from the cruise terminals.  In addition to the hotel restaurant, there is a mall directly across the street that has great restaurant choices.  The hotel does have an executive lounge, but it is not on par with most other executive lounges at other Hilton properties.",4,2017,11,05
36,nice home base,"This was a nice hiton, nothing over the top. Our room was clean and staff was nice. It was easy to locate and get to the metro. We were also very close to the beach. My only complaint is the pool, very over priced, staff was nice and all, but did not seem worth the cost, just walk to the beach instead. The executive lounge was probably the best part, they had daily happy hour with free wine, beer and snacks from 6-8pm.",4,2017,11,03
36,NICE hotel excellent location.,"We largely recovered for a few days after being in Italy for a week and prior to heading out on a cruise. The nearby beach, and numerous incredible parks and playgrounds within walking distance and the handy mall across the street made our family's visit easy. We are diamond hilton so we could eat in both the outstanding 15th floor lounge or at the sumptuous breakfast that is E28 per person both were excellent. Service is very efficient, bell staff and lounge. Front desk is rather officious in their duties but I directed the concern to management via email and they immediately corrected it. That's what makes differentiates a good hotel from a great one---attention to details. Bathrooms super large, our family sized room very good---would have liked a suite non were available--next trip perhaps. I would certainly stay again.",5,2017,11,01
36,An excellent stay!,The wife and I stayed here as members of a tour group.  The tour started in Madrid and ended in Barcelona at the Hilton Diagonal.  The stay was perfect in all respects.  We will definitely return to the Diagonal - and to other Hilton properties!,5,2017,10,31
36,Great Location and Good Vibe - Avoid Hiltons policy to over charge longer term guests!!,"Check in  was simple, staff very informative.
The room was lovely, spacious and clean.
The hotel is perfectly located  for access to the beach and the city centre ( via the Metro)
Purobeach was great fun for adults, but not so for younger kids, thankfully we didn't have to pay for the beds as a Hilton Honours guest.
The service in lounge was very good too.
Would definitely go back, probably with out the kids!

We noted during the booking process that Hilton actually increase their charges the longer you stay! We are all aware that Hotels charge differing rates according to demand.
However unlike the majority of other chains who average out or even discount the room costs the longer you stay. Hilton choose to penalise you anywhere between 5 & 15% higher than the average price, for your loyalty!!
Try it for yourself;
Go online ( Hilton.com), pick a hotel, select your arrival date and departure, say 5 nights, click find it. Hilton will then offer you a fixed day rate for the duration.
Now start again, pick same hotel, select same check in date and this time select the duration as 1 night and tick USE Flexible DATES.
Hilton will then offer you the individual room rates for up to 7 days either side of you booking, add up the nights as per your original search and you will see a considerable cost saving against the fixed day rate for the duration.

Once you have done this exercise call the hotel directly and they will usually agree the lower rate!

I have contacted Hilton on several occasions to discuss their policy of penalising, the longer term guests, and got the same standard response:-

“Please note, the rate change is subject to availability. If the hotel is in high demand for the days you are requesting, generally the rates are high. As for when the hotel has a low demand in inventory the room rates are of course low. As in regards to your inquiry, if it is less expensive to book individually please take advantage of the provided rates.”",4,2017,10,31
36,Great Hilton hotel,"Spent here a short vacation in October and was very pleased with the hotel and the service. Staff were very pleasant and helpful, we were always looked after. The bedroom was spacious and spotless, every meal we had was delicious and got nice big portions, from breakfast, to room service, the restaurant and Purobeach.
Nice touches were the Hilton Honors place-cards at breakfast and the little screen at reception where you can check your bill (not wasting any paper).
Purobeach was an ideal place to chill out, with friendly staff such as Kathleen. The sunbed rental fee for hotel guests is really a bargain comparing to the full fees.
Will definitely be back!",5,2017,10,29
36,Hilton in Barcelona...,"Hilton Diagonal del Mar is nice property for stay. Distance to city centre is just few stops with metro. Building from outside looks great, but inside is not so nice. Really they need to make refurbishment especially in the rooms. Everthing outdate:-(. Front office team in main reception not so much friendly, but Exe.reception and Executive lounge on 15th level GREAT:-)! I want to say thank you to Georgina and Claudio. Both were great and going above their duties. Views from Exe.Lounge terace very lovely and you can smoke there:-). Swimming pool looks nice as well, but I didnt have time to try. Barcelona is very beautiful city and I will be back for sure.",4,2017,10,29
36,"Kind, Courteous Staff, Awesome Accomondations","From the time of booking to departure the staff was kind, professional and knowledgable.  Took the time to answer several questions prior to arrival and made us feel welcome during stay.  Hotel was beautiful and location was excellent with easy access to public transportation.",5,2017,10,29
36,Short stay,Great trip and experience for a family.         Staff are very helpful and you don't need to worry. The customer service was brilliant especially at the reception at the bottom. A good location for shoppers and people who want to spend time at the beach.,5,2017,10,28
36,Great short break ,"We arrived late Monday eve. A short walk from Forum station, although up till 9pm you can cut through the shopping centre of Diagonal Mar. Modern clean style entrance , friendly and helpful reception. We had a part sea view and were on 10th floor. Well appointed room, clean and well maintained. 
A great feature is the Puero Beach. A lovely bar, cafe and pool area and a gym with up to date equipment.With Sun loungers - no cost in October - some brave people in the pool which was lovely - very warm in the sun on the loungers.
Breakfast - a massive range all clearly labelled for us coeliacs, and those with allergies. Staff couldn't be more helpful and friendly. We sat on the terrace - a bit cool first thing but staff brought a blanket for chilly people! 
We had one evening meal in the Indiana restaurant - quality food, not the cheapest but very convenient and comfortable 
The hotel ideally situated - 5 mins to beach, two nice little parks to sit in and the shopping centre with a hypermarket and lots of cafe/restaurants 
To get into the main city, metro from Forum, or the tram or the bus or a 6k along the coast 
Hotel has family rooms and the pool is great for them too.
On our last day we had to leave our room by 1300 but were allowed to use all facilities including the pool area which had showers too. ",5,2017,10,28
36,Relaxing and Pleasant,"I had a lovely and relaxing time with my family. Our stay was very comfortable. Our room was a good size and the beds were comfortable especially after a long day touring the city. The hotel was in aver good location with the beach a few metres away.They were also shops and restaurant opposite the hotel. Although it is on the road, it is not noisy at all.",5,2017,10,27
36,Great Experience,The locations & accommodation was outstanding. The staff was very nice from the time we checked in to checkout.  Location was excellent. We used the Hip Hop touristic bus took us every were.  Don't miss the Segrada Familia.  Barcelona is a city I would like to visit again.,5,2017,10,27
36,Average Stay -- Not Worth the Price,"I'm a loyal Hilton Honors member and I've stayed at their properties in several different countries. I had high hopes for this property as the photos looked great and it was conveniently located for my stay in Barcelona. 

Upon arrival, even though I had pre-checked in, it was a hassle at the front desk and the attendant didn't enter my girlfriend's info into their system properly and also only programmed our key cards for two days rather than three, which almost caused me to miss an appointment. The staff was pretty rude when I attempted to get new key cards, insisting upon having my girlfriend re-present her passport even though we had done that during checkin. 

Lastly, as a long time Hilton Honors member, I feel the room we received was ""average"" while the fee was quite extravagant.  ",3,2017,10,27
36,Good hotel. Good quiet location ,"We stayed at the Hilton recently on our trip to Barcelona to celebrate my birthday.  The Hilton is our preferred choice of hotel wherever we travel. This one however is based more in the financial district and quite a walk to most of the attractions, we did not mind this, as it gave us a chance to explore. There is a taxis rank just to the side of the hotel and the tourist bus tour is only a short walk away. 

We took a taxi from the airport. It cost us nearly 40€ on the Sunday as apparently the taxi tariff is higher then and 33€ on the way back. 

It took us around 1.5 hours to walk to La Rambla along the beach front and around an hour to Sangrada Familia. The hotel gave us a map which made it easier to navigate our way around. We love walking so it was perfect for us (well more for me, as my husband complained a lot! Lol)

We took the bus tour which we feel was a bit of a waste of money (for us) but we did get to see other parts of the city. Unfortunately when we arrived at SF about 10am all the tickets were sold for that day so we had to buy them for the day after. Definitely book your ticket online to save being disappointed. The building is magnificent especially from the outside.

There is a shopping centre opposite the Hilton which has a good selection of high street stores, food outlets and a supermarket too. We ate a couple of times at the Casa Carmen restaurant there which was lovely and reasonably priced too. 

During our stay Ravaz the Bell boy was very helpful and always greeted us with a smile. The staff at breakfast were absolutely amazing. They provided a great service and are in my opinion what makes this hotel! On the morning of my birthday they brought me a piece of cake out with a candle in and sung happy birthday to me. It was a lovely gesture. Thank you again to the lovely breakfast staff. 

We were lucky enough to have some sunshine so we spent a couple of hours at Puero Beach on a lounger. There was no cost for the lounger and towels were
provided. The drinks however are very expensive. 25€ for a small Heineken and a vodka tonic. 

We used the gym a couple of times. It had the usual cardio/weights in. Enough to keep you ticking over on your trip. The water station however is right in the corner and to get to it you have to climb over the rowing machines which isn’t ideal. 

Overall the hotel is very good and we will definitely stay here again. 

",4,2017,10,26
36,WEEKEND AWAY,"Not centrally located but still in a great location just across from the shopping mall & 5 mins walk away from nearest metro & tram stops & a taxi rank outside.
Room was great as was the housekeeping. 
The Purobeach pool area/bar on the second floor was lovely as was breakfast. 
The only downside was that Drinks are fairly expensive so beware !",4,2017,10,26
36,"Hilton ""Exceptional"" Del Mar","Hilton: ""Exceptional"" Diagonal del Mar  Lovely hotel located in sophisticated area of Barcelona. not in the heart o the tourist attractions but close to the beach and many restaurants. Nice, safe neighbourhood. Can walk to Porto Olympico and casinos. A few minutes away from Las Rambas, the Gothic neighborhood and many fresh markets selling fresh fish, meats, fruits and produce. Good area to catch the subway and tours in the city.",4,2017,10,24
36,GREAT STAY,"Everything was Great, Clean Rooms, Great Staff, Incredible Service, and great location.  Check in was very smooth and simple, our bags were collected immediately and we were able to get on our way immediate.  We were notified promptly when the rooms were ready and when we got there everything was in order for all of my groups room.  The service at the lobby bar was incredible as well.  Great Trip",5,2017,10,24
36,Nice for a quick stay by the sea,"Very nice service at the front desk, however no bell boy to help with bags or even a greeter at the front. The room was very nice! The bed was perfect after a long day of traveling. The pool area seem to be the main attraction online however the day we went was fairly cool outside. The pool is not heated which is a bummer. The sun was out and warm enough to lay out. They did not charge us anything for the sun bed because there was only a handful of guest there.",4,2017,10,22
36,Great deal for your money,"Great hotel, freindly staff. Can't compare to Hilton in North America but still very nice. One recommendation the carpets in the hallway should be changed as they smell dirty. I would most definitely would stay at this place if I return to Spain",5,2017,10,21
36,"Very good hotel, but pay for the pool lounges!","This is a well run, pleasant hotel near the beach.  It has a nice pool area but you need to pay to use a pool lounge - first time in my life this has been necessary.  Executive Lounge staff are very good and there's a nice outdoor terrace on 15th floor off lounge.  Not a wide range of nibblies on offer but all presented well.  I'm not sure it's a good plan to allow guests to help themselves to the booze - much better to ask what they want and serve it!  Room was good and bathroom well appointed.  Would stay here again.",4,2017,10,20
36,Not what it used to be,"The furniture and the bathroom look used and old. There was a huge leak from my shower cabin. A colleague complained about the heating system. The guy who came to fix it speaked on the phone with the staff saying she is crazy and is warm enough for him. The heating system was working in other rooms. The breakfast was ok, with enough variety. The location was also ok. The view from the rooms was also good.",3,2017,10,20
36,"Wonderful hotel, would highly recommend","Had a check in issue with front desk staff Helen, she simply dropped everything in the midst of check-in and walk away to help the technician on something else, very annoying! But overall Hotel provides such an excellent service that outweighed one staff’s poor performance, I still give a 10 to this great hotel.",5,2017,10,18
36,Hotel Security is a major concern !,"We were shocked that our son's Samsung tablet was stolen from inside the hotel room, when we left the hotel room for just two hours. The hotel does not have sufficient security apparatus to trace someone who had entered the room. They kept saying that entry was only made with room key - with no accountability from the hotel.

Be wary of security at this hotel !",1,2017,10,17
36,Great location & beautiful hotel,"After Paris, my next stop was Barcelona and after a lot of research, I finalized this option. I must admit that I was pretty amazed by the service of the hotel staff - they was by far the most courtesy that I experienced anywhere in Europe. The hotel staff was warm and forthcoming with information and they ensured that our stay was pleasant.
The hotel is conveniently located - a 5 mnt walk from a metro station and trams and bus stops being closer. There is also a shopping arcade very close to the hotel which houses some good restaurants and is also good for shopping.
The hotel is also to the beach - and our rooms provided a great view of the beach.
We did not explore the restaurants/bar within the hotel as it was a short trip - and had a lot to cover.",4,2017,10,16
36,Corporate Visit,"Nice hotel with good rooms and ambiance. A decent location in to the Centre of the city plus the beach is local.  

Nice staff who are very helpful. 

One complaint is the cost, it's excessive bar prices wow, and different at different bars in the building. ",4,2017,10,15
36,It doesnt get any better!,"I would highly recommend this hotel to any type of traveller, in terms of quality and comfort. The staff are outstanding and the whole facility is clean and extremely well maintained. The bar is friendly and the food is great. Rooms and views are outstanding and the gymnasium is more than adequate. The executive lounge and staff can't be beaten and the pool area is modern and inviting. Transport into town or the beach could not be easier, and there is a metro link to the airport. Absolutely the place to stay in Barcelona!",5,2017,10,15
36,Lovely Hotel for Business Trips,"Had a minor problem with respect to accuracy of my stay. HOWEVER, my stay was still lovely and very comfortable. The hotel is located right across from a shopping center and various food options. The user friendly metro is also located within a short 5 min walk of the hotel.  I will definitely stay here again",5,2017,10,15
36,"A fine hotel, but not for everyone","I travel to Barcelona annually on business, and have been fortunate to have stayed at many hotels across this great city. And while the Hilton Diagonal Mar serves my needs fairly well, it has its pros and cons, and will not meet the needs of every traveler. If this is your first trip to Barcelona, and sightseeing tops on your list. Or want to be close to the action, or you're on a honeymoon, this is not the hotel for you.

The Hilton Diagonal Mar is really a business hotel first. And being outside the downtown area, offers larger rooms, more amenities, and easy access to cabs that can circumnavigate downtown to get they're going. For those that do stay here, there are a few perks. It isn't noisy or congested in this part of Barcelona. The 15th floor executive lounge has a wonderful view, a fabulous rooftop deck, and a very nice breakfast and afternoon snacks. The pool is terrific on nice days. And about a mile west, the area of town has its own, smaller, ""La Rambla"" style promenade. And if you do need to venture into town, it's only a 10 minute ride by cab or subway, even though the latter is also a 5 minute walk.

There is also a food court in the mall across the street, which is handy because the hotel food is typically average and expensive. The rooms are clean and spacious, the staff is quite pleasant and helpful, and housekeeping, while fine, is a bit inconsistent. All and all, a fine choice as long as you understand what you're getting before going in.",4,2017,10,15
36,Excellent service as a Gold member,"When I booked my room with Amex, I knew I was entitled to an upgrade and a $75 coupon. On average, many hotels would tell you that nothing is available when you check in. To our surprise, we got a room upgrade. The gentleman at the reception was extremely professional. He took the time to explain all the benefits to us including the Happy Hours at the Lounge on the 15th floor.
Furthermore, when I complained about expensive packing fees for my rental car, he proposed a great solution to me.",5,2017,10,13
36,Good hotel and location,"Hotel is a few minutes walk from the CCIB Convention Centre, over the road from a shopping mall with good selection of shops and restaurants and beach is also nearby. It was more expensive than a number of business hotels I’ve been too and Executive Rooms are on the upper levels. There is an Exec Lounge that does smaller breakfasts on Level 15 with free snacks and drinks for a couple of hours early evening. Some people experienced check-in issues but over all, were really efficient and pleasant. ",4,2017,10,11
36,We loved it.,"Close to the beach. Excellent executive floor with amazing breakfast. Very convenient. Nice people from outside to the top... There is a Mall in front of the hotel and the beach behind. A little far away from the major attractions, but taxi service is reasonable.",5,2017,10,11
36,Barcelona,I enjoyed this hotel and it’s location even though it was a little out of the way. The staff was extremely pleasant and had great guest service skills. The price was very reasonable and the room was spotless. I ordered private dining for breakfast & it was delivered in a timely manner plus it was hot and well priced. Staff had a taxi for me and I didn’t have to wait at all. I’d definitely return to this hotel!,5,2017,10,11
36,Good hotel for a weekend visit,"We went here recently for a long weekend and the Hilton is a good hotel. It's close to the sea and near to some attractions although it isn't very close to the centre of Barcelona. It's on a subway and tram route so getting into the centre isn't too difficult. 
We had a good sized room with a view over the pool area. We had a large and very comfortable bed that had really good quality linens so we slept well. Big bathroom with a very nice shower cubicle, lots of hot water and proper fluffy towels. Toiletries provided too. 
Breakfast had a wide range of foods although I have had better quality breakfasts in other Hiltons.
Staff were excellent throughout the stay.",4,2017,10,08
36,The hotel is very good with epicurean choices,"We liked the hotel because of the hotel's epicurean choices during our stay. A prime example is that the swimming pool bar offers a place to relax, splash, and have a right refreshing retreat. We invited some local friends to join us for tidbit and Sangria at the pool bar. My local friends dropped their jaws and loved the hotel's hospitality.  Our stay was at Deluxe room. It was okay. The breakfast was an elegant affair, enveloped in casual elegance... business travelers come to expect from a business style hotel. There is a plenty long list of sumptuous breakfast foods that fed us fully. We had a chance to swim on beach and enjoyed sea.",4,2017,10,07
36,Great Location,Stayed here whilst atttending the European Society of Organ Transplant congress in the Convention Centre next door. The hotel was just a 5 minute walk from the Centre and it was also conveniently located across the street from the Diagonal Mar Mall. Staff were friendly and helpful.,4,2017,10,07
36,A Hilton with a View ,"Nice hotel, great location and outstanding service.

If you stay in the Executive Floor you will get access to the Lounge that has one of the most of outstanding views of the City and the Mediterranean Sea.

The hotel is not close to the main tourist attractions, but access to transportation is nearby.  

On the downside: the beds are not the same you are use to get at other Hilton Locations in the US or Latin America. Not even close.",4,2017,10,05
36,Great location close to the sea!,Nice functional Hilton property that delivers on location and guest service. Refurbished rooms are great and Executive Lounge is a must.  Thank you to Georgiana for making us feel so welcomed.  Cannot wait to stay again in December!,5,2017,10,04
36,Pre and post cruise stay,"I stayed at the Hilton Diagonal Mar before and after a Mediterranean cruise. Check in was a breeze, everyone spoke English and were friendly and helpful. The room was large (by European standards), clean and well appointed. There is a shopping mall across the street from the hotel with plenty of stores and restaurants. The hotel serves a full English breakfast everyday, which was pretty good. I enjoyed my stay and would definitely stay there again.",4,2017,10,02
36,"Great hotel, pity about lifts","I would have scored this hotel 5/5 without any reservation as both staff, food, service were all exceptional.
Food during my meeting was surprisingly good.
The only gripe I have is how long had to wait for the lift (elevator). Consistently lengthy waits- am not sure if they don't have enough or they are badly programmed.

Other things to note
Swimming pool didn't open until 10am so I missed chance to use. Don't know if changing rooms at it but no dressing gown in my room. I don't have physique to stand in crowded elevator in my swim wear, clutching goggles so was put off.

I ate my evening meal in sushi restaurant opposite- well worth a visit!",4,2017,10,01
36,Decent property if a little off the beaten track ,"This is a standard (in a good way) Hilton property. Clean, spacious rooms and good quality bedding.

The exec lounge had a good range of drinks/nibbles meaning you could quite easily eat there for a couple of nights.

The pool was probably the most pretentious I’ve come across in my many years of travelling. Too trendy full of people who take themselves a little too seriously. 

Hotel location is OK but you do feel a little ‘out of the way’. I imagine this is worse in the winter when it’s no fun being by the sea. 

Shopping centre opposite provides lots of eating options.",4,2017,10,01
36,Wow,"Hilton's are some of my favorite hotels. This one is no different. Simply beautiful location. Extremely friendly front desk ladies...and very beautiful, it's Spain. The rooms were very clean and I think these bathrooms were the best bathrooms at any hotel that I have seen. Big and spacious with shower and bath tub and this was a standard room. A giant mall across the street and the coast of the med a block down the street. A plus I tell ya.",4,2017,09,29
36,Nice Hilton hotel in Barcelona,"Locates away from downtown, 15 minutes by metro or 10 minutes by taxi. 1 1/2 blocks from the beach. Right in front of Diagonal Mar shopping mall. Hotel rooms are large. Executive floor service was excellent. Great breakfast buffet with detailed service. Nice swimming pool serviced by Purobeach. Service at front desk and bell desk could be improved.",4,2017,09,28
36,Wonderful and comfortable,"Amazing service! Very clean and the food was delicious 
There is a starbucks right next to the hotel so it made it nice for the mornings. Also a cafe too great food great breakfast. We went to a  soccar game and when we got back at 11:30pm we were hungry- the cafe nextdoor to the hotel was open till 2 pm. Lots of fun",5,2017,09,28
36,Best Hilton- i've been in.,The room upgrade we had was amazing. Service was fantastic and we had access to the executive lounge. The pool at the hotel is like nothing you've ever seen before. The staff was extremely helpful. All around great experience.,5,2017,09,27
36,over charged,I paid 678.46 for a 4 night break for myself and my husband who is receiving treatment for his illness we arrived on 12 08 17 and stayed in room 706 on arrival I was asked to pay another 200 euro security deposit plus I paid 158 02 sterling for our breakfast for 4 mornings my husband took sick on tues and I got early flights home on Wednesday .we left at 4 am and the hotel promised to have my refund returned within a week they have sent messages to me saying it is being sorted all lies I am now seeking legal advice on the matter it might not be a lot of money to them but it is to me ,3,2017,09,27
36,Great Hilton experience,Great Hilton experience. Amazing breakfast and service. Rooms was spacious and clean and with a great view. Get a room as high as possible. Walking distance to the beach and metro. 4 km from city center but if you have a time a good walk. All in all Really good value for the money,5,2017,09,25
36,Perfect short break,"Went to Barcelona for a few days. Chose this hotel as Also near the beach. Took a couple of taxis to the centre and they were inexpensive. Always taxis outside the hotel. 
Executive lounge fantastic. Has outside terrace to enjoy the views whilst having a glass of cava
Five minutes to a lovely well kept beach. Couple of bars down there
Used the restaurants on the terrace in the shopping centre a couple of times which were good
Went to Fisher restaurant on Ave Literal. Fantastic food overlooks the beach and sea
Used Zip cars for transfers. Also great service ",5,2017,09,25
36,Amazing stay ,"The hotel very nice and very close to the beach.
The staff are friendly and the rooms are big. And clean .
Special thanks to mr. Victor for the smooth check in and his hospitality.
The rooms with sea view has amazing full   Sea view. ",5,2017,09,24
36,"Not a good experience, but they did make up for it.","My husband and I were staying in Barcelona the night before getting on our Disney Cruise. The hotel itself was not that bad, the only complaint I have is that the bed was extremely uncomfortable (but that could just be personal opinion; it was very firm).

Disney offered an early morning excursion to Monserrat and we decided to take it. The clear instruction that was given to us by both the hotel staff and disney representatives was to put our luggage tags on our luggage and leave it inside the room by the door and it would be transported to the boat for us. We did exactly as we were told and left to enjoy our morning at Monserrat. 

Long story short, the hotel forgot to get our luggage from our rooms. They were left there while we were sailing across the Mediterranean. It took us 4 days to get our luggage back. Thats over half of our cruise that we had nothing. This was a dream vacation that we had saved up for for over 2 years, and we were wearing the same clothes for 4 days without toiletries or anything. It took the entirety of the cruise, but on the last day the hotel came back and admitted it was their fault. They offered us two free nights stay at the Diagonal Mar. Well thats nice, but we live in Virginia and don't plan on coming back to Barcelona any time soon. 

After emailing 4 different people and trying desperately to get in touch with someone for about a week, Miguel Garcia got in touch. He was very kind and understanding and ended up giving us two ""Be Our Guest"" certificated for any Hilton property in the World. Overall this didn't negate the fact that our vacation was tainted, but it did give us the chance to have another awesome vacation without the worrying about hotel costs.",2,2017,09,24
36,excellent check in and room,"the room was great, quite, nice, breakfast buffet included was very nice. nice pool area, bar, food. also down stairs nice bar area to relax. really nice is only five minute walk to a real nice beach with towel service and umbrellas available. also showers and places to eat and drink right on the sand. and only 5 minute walk!. cabs always out front, city center is very close by. buses close also.",5,2017,09,24
36,Horrible staff and outdated rooms,"I'm Hilton Honors gold member and have stayed several times in this hotel due to my frequent travels to Barcelona.
Last time was July 2017 and after several unpleasant experiences in this year , I would not recommend anyone to stay in this hotel.
The check in experiences is a nightmare: its slow and always with long queues. The front desk staff , including his front desk supervisor, are extremely rude. In the many times I stayed, I was almost never allocated a room based on my gold status preferences. Most of the time , I had to request a room change ,as the first room was in poor conditions: dirty carpets, cigarette smoke strong smell, broken or heavily damaged furniture's.
Further the breakfast is very poor quality and when the hotel is fully booked , its difficult to even get a table.
The lounge staff is unbelievable rude and the lounge has nice views , but very poor breakfast.
I stay in many Hiltons around the world, and never faced such issues. 
This hotels deserves at maximum 2stars.
Please do yourself a favor and book any other hotel in Barcelona. There are many very good hotels , that have nice and friendly staff that will make your stay in Barcelona much more pleasant.",1,2017,09,23
36,Good business hotel,"This is a large hotel some distance from the touristy city centre. The hotel is very typical of the Hilton brand. The place was spotless and everything worked well exc that the free internet was rather slow in the evening.
As a business hotel it delivers good quality but if I was a tourist I would probably try and find something nearer the city centre, unless the price offered was very competitive. I will gladly stay here again.",4,2017,09,23
36,Good comfotable hotel,"Stayed 2 nights in the executive room as part of a conference, Arrived past 11pm, yet we had to wait a while to check in as all 3 people checking in were busy. It will help to have extra staff to help with check in as and when it's busy, to avoid guests having to wait too long.

The room was comfortable and well equipt. The floors were not carpeted, so probably more hygienic. Instant coffee/tea and kettle available, but only 2 milk pots provided - could do with a few more. Toiletries are good, include shower/bath gel, separate shampoo and conditioner, and body lotion, shower cap, soap bars. There are also bathrobes and slippers. The towels were big - always nice to have!

One annoying thing was the light from the alarm clock at night, not sure if it can be turned off or I just didn't know how to switch off the light!

The view from my room was good, had the sea view, although there are other tall buildings in between. The view by the lifts of the opposite side was stunning.

Breakfast was OK, nothing special, adequate, caters to all. The coffee could be improved, it tasted rather bland and diluted. I couldn't find any individual pots of yoghurt, other than big bowls of yoghurt.

Overall, I enjoyed the stay, and would recommend it.",4,2017,09,22
36,Great Hotel,"Great Hotel which is near the beach, also close to the 'green line' if using the hop on hop off bus. The staff were very helpful and willing to help at all times. Our room was very comfortable and was well decorated ",4,2017,09,21
36,Beautiful post cruise destination,We stayed at the Hilton diagonal mar for two nights after our Mediterranean cruise. It is very close to a good shopping mall with loads of shops and restaurants and a stunning beach with beach front restaurants a plenty. Several different open top buses giving tours of the city centre have stops very close by. The rooms are big and comfy and the staff are very friendly and helpful.,5,2017,09,19
36,"Just outside the city centre and a 10"" walk to the beach","The Hilton Diagonal Mar is a large hotel which sits a short underground train ride from the centre of Barcelona. The hotel has all the amenities, and a great outside area on the second floor.
The rooms are nicely presented and the staff are nice. I am knocking a star off from the five as whilst it may be atypical my room was a little noisy with background noise of running water and the halls on each floor have a mildly unpleasant odour.
However the beach is certainly in walking distance and a number of restaurants and shops sit across the road.
A nice hotel in a good location.
",4,2017,09,19
36,"A good ""big box"" hotel","My daughter and I stayed recently for 2 nights.  The room was clean, quiet and well-equipped.  The reception staff were less than helpful.  We arrived early, expecting to not be able to check in but were told we would receive a text when our room was ready which we never received.  Information we received regarding the tourist bus opportunity was also incorrect.  The pool area was nice but drinks were very over-priced.  Overall, a lovely hotel.",4,2017,09,18
36,Great location for beach & city,Stayed here for 3 nights and had a great time! The hotel is ideally located for both the city and beach which makes it perfect for a Barcelona stay. The rooms are fantastic and clean and roomy too for city centre hotels and breakfast has a great choice too. The hotel is located just across the road from a shopping mall and is a 5minute walk to the nearest underground/metro station making a trip to the city centre sights easy and grabbing a Hello Barcelona card was easy too. The executive lounge is brilliant with friendly and helpful staff which to be honest you will find all around the hotel. This is one that I will definitely put on my list to stay at again!,5,2017,09,18
36,Excellent hotel,"Good hotel for the conference centre next door.   Only gripe was the windows needed cleaning on the outside.   Good comfortable rooms and good breakfast buffet.  About 30 mins from airport, about 35 euro in a taxi.",5,2017,09,17
36,Nice place to stay,"It is a well located hotel.  You could get the hop and off bus, a shopping center across the street with good places to eat. Metro is just a lock away 
The hotel staff was very open to help 
It is a little un the medium to high price ",4,2017,09,17
36,short stay vocational visit,The hotel is immaculate and very much a business hotel. We had a great vacational short stay visit. Thought the prices  at the pool bar was a bit expensive to say the least!! The breakfast room is to be commended for food and service,4,2017,09,15
36,"Dirty rooms, NO facilities in the room Hilton diagonaal mar","I have booked 3 rooms for me And 2 friends before I booked i asked the customerservice do u have internet on the tv they told me Yes we have And you can also connect your device on the television, Till now it was always possible in every hotel i have been But still I always ask before i go To a hotel Because I Need it To watch Some very important videos for work But when i wanted To watch the videos i found out they dont have internet on the tv And i even can not connect a device so i called the receptionist And they Send Some Guy of the technical stuff(Name;ANDREU) And he told me also you can connect a device But Its blockef in all the rooms And he dont know How To unblock And No one knows who did it, So people you have To know from now Hilton diagonaal mar DONT EVEN HAVE A SMART TV BUT THEY PRETEND LIKE ITS POSSIBLE To have internet on the tv And connect your device, And the funny thing is i booked 3 rooms And paid the same price for the same rooms and i dont even have a shower cabin But only a bath and my other friends With the same room got a bath and a shower cabin, when i entered the room there was also a dirty tissue With a dirty toothpick between the bed And Bedside table, But the drop To write this complaint came after i Find out the tv dont have internet And Its not possible To connect a device Because Its NOT A SMART TV But a very OLd one. I also told The receptionist about this( name; Leon) he told me only one thing: I apologize sir Tomorrow Will be the manager here so you can talk To her(Yolanda Llorca) And the funny thing was i asked him How late should i come To the reception To tell about my complaint To the manager But he told me i dont know exact the time, so the colleagues dont even know how late the manager have To work And could not even check iT for me",1,2017,09,14
36,Great location for the beach,"We had a view of the sea and the hotel pool which was fabulous however the rooms are too close together. You can hear every conversation, the toilet flushing and people taking a shower. 
I don't expect that for a Hilton or for the price we paid! 

2 nights of no sleep and I had to tell the 'guests' next door to keep the noise down at 1.30am 

I came home expecting to be relaxed instead I'm even more tired! ",3,2017,09,14
36,Great location to shop,"The hotel is right next to a beautiful shopping center and is so close to the beach. It is close to tour bus routes and is very clean. The rooms in the executive levels were ultra modern and a beautiful view of the city. My son loved how fast the wifi was. 
Six euros for a Diet Coke in the lobby was a bit much though.",4,2017,09,13
36,Typical Hilton - what you pay vs what you get?,"Basically you pay for it - expensive drinks at the bar and ridiculously expensive breakfast €27 a day!! (Or €21 'special' rate at check in)

I give this a 3 star rate as it's overpriced for what you get, especially where it is located far from the centre of BCN. Approx €10 in a taxi but very close to the beach

I stayed here as other options closer to the centre were so expensive (and this was not cheap)

Typical Hilton standards - nice room, comfortable bed and very clean. But nothing special ",3,2017,09,13
36,Upset,Arrived today with the wife who is a gold member to be told that the members lounge was closed for a week. We went out for tea at 7pm and the elevator stopped on floor 15 where 2 gentlemen entered the lift with food / wine etc. Guess what the members lounge was open. Not happy !!,1,2017,09,11
36,Good place for CCIB,"This hotel is next door to CCIB. If one is attending an event at CCIB, I suggest you should consider staying in this hotel. There is a shopping mall just across the road from there where you will find cheap restaurants. The basic rooms are unfortunately small and reminded me of my days at university. Breakfast finishes at 1030 during week days and at 1100 during the weekend and Bank holidays. These times do not allow a lay down if one is on vacation. The room internet is expensive at 15Euros per day. It is free in other hotels.",4,2017,09,07
36,Good quiet location,"Hotel is just on the city outskirt right next door to a decent shopping centre and next to Barcelona's beaches. 

The rooms as are you would expect from Hilton. 

A shame though there is no dedicated pool. It is home to the Purobeach club which Hilton guests have access to at discounted rates, however it is far too overpriced, the food isn't great and the service is even worse. Be warned. Much better off taking yourself to one of the nearby beaches. 

While Purobeach isn't technically part of Hilton, I feel having it on location distracts from the overall experience and brand. ",4,2017,09,07
36,the pool,"Nice hotel with nice rooms (excecutive room) with nice view of city. Hotel is on the east side of city, but cheap taxi can take you anywhere. The big plus with this hotel is that they have a nice pool and large lounge area with lots or sun beds and a few Bali beds. Fridays, Saturday and Sundays they have ""club"" theme and nice lounge music. Service is great and drinks are great! But a bit on the expensive side. Sun chair prices are 70EUR if you are not a HH-member.",4,2017,09,07
36,Great quiet location ,"This is a typical Hilton hotel located at the quieter end of town, yet ideally located for the metro, bus etc.
Usual Hilton standard of rooms with usual toiletries etc included.
Expensive mini bar electronically controlled and a small area for personal use. Tea and coffee facilities.
Great pool area but expensive and busy.
The check in was excellent and very efficient.
All in all a great location for Barcelona city and beaches.
I'd recommend.  ",4,2017,09,06
36,Not so good on 2nd visit,"Unfortunately, this is now just an average Hilton. The rooms are good and if you’re fortunate to have access to the Executive Lounge, the terrace is great. But it is very orientated towards cruise tourists and other tour groups. This time, the reception was simply chaotic; and it was usual for our room to be serviced towards 5pm on each of the days of our week-long stay. It's a pity, but standards have declined.",3,2017,09,05
36,Wouldn't stay here with kids again,"Not the most kids friendly Hilton. Pool is very posh and filled with party animals. Topless swimming and smoking is allowed, so be prepare to explain to your kids why someone's breasts are showing, inhale 2nd hand smoke, and cover their ears from all the fowl language from party goers",4,2017,09,05
36,Not a Hilton Quality Property,"We have stayed in many Hilton properties and this was the most disappointing Hilton property we have visited.  Housekeeping at best gets a ""C"" grade.  No refills on shampoo or coffee. Found a partially drank bottle of seltzer water on our cabinet after housekeeping was in to minimally refresh room. It wasn't  ours! The hallway on the 17th floor had a terrible odor and no one seemed to care.  The front desk was slow and seemed not to care about our complaints. Waited in line 30-40 minutes to check in...and again to out. There is a charge to use the pool chairs! Really??? Also overheard them telling one hotel patron no towels could be taken to the beach.  The hotel clerk was just straight up rude.  The entire staff needs customer service training.",1,2017,09,05
36,Great Pre Cruise Hotel,"Spent two nights here before our Disney Cruise.  Even though it was one of the cruise line sponsored hotels, we booked it independently for two nights.  Prepaid 258 EUR/night when the conversion rate was $1.06/EUR several months ago, so felt good about that.  Anyway, we arrived at 9:30 am after a red eye flight from the East Coast of US, and our room was ready.  I am a Hilton Honors Gold member. They explained that normally I would be entitled to an executive club upgrade, but since the hotel was booked and the club was full they offered us the free breakfast buffet for each day for the family of 4.  This normally costs 27 EUR pp, so I was happy with that.  Also offered free drinks at Purobeach, but did not use them.  We booked their king family room, which by US standards is a regular room, had a small double pull out couch which worked for the kids and they brought a rollaway in without even asking for my second one.

Hotel is in a quieter new section of Barcelona, about 1 block from the green route stop of the Bus Turisitic which was convenient.  Given that I was there 1 week after the horrible events in Las Ramblas, I was more comfortable staying away from town.  Mall is across the street and found they have an Alcampo grocery store, and several restaurants (BK, McDs, etc).   Go their to buy your snacks and drinks.  Bottle of water is 0.15 EUR vs 6.00 EUR at the hotel.

The concierge reached out to me and offered to arrange a private car from the airport for 90 EUR.  A little pricey, but decided to do it and it was a nice easy experience.   ",5,2017,09,04
36,Very Busy Hotel!,We stayed there a few days before we embarked on a Disney Cruise.It was very busy on the days leading up to the cruise and when the previous cruise docked.If you think you will be able to check into the hotel if you arrive early it will probably not happen.The good news is that there is a nice shopping mall with plenty of restaurants across the street as well as good shopping! The beach is just blocks away too.So plan ahead to beach-it or shop!The hotel itself is very nice and the staff very helpful.,4,2017,09,03
36,Good enough but nothing exceptional,"We chose this hotel because this is one of Disney's partnered hotels for their Cruise Line. We didn't book through Disney.

The hotel is (as most Hilton's are) of high quality with strong decor and high standards of cleanliness. Having said that it was nothing special and didn't have any particular character. 

Because of the time of year, it was remarkably expensive and had zero perks in the price. The buffet breakfast at 27 euros per head was poor value and the variety was weak.

Despite my several advance requests, not only did the hotel fail to give us interconnecting rooms, but they actually spread our 3 rooms across 3 floors. And they apparently couldn't do anything about this on the day.

Location next to Diagonal Mar mall is good, but it's quite a long way from the Gothic quarter or any places of interest. Be clear why you are staying at this hotel...for touristy stuff, not very good.",3,2017,09,03
36,5CC Hilton Diagonal,Excellent business hotel next to the congress center. Meeting room staff are exceptional. Reception is clueless. Pool restaurant very good and staff very nice. Room service staff very good and attentive.,4,2017,09,03
36,One night in Barcelona before a cruise,"The hotel is lovely with a nice airy lobby. Reservation agents were pleasant, efficient and spoke English. The rooms were unexpectedly large, but a room for 3 had accommodations of a mattress on the floor for a third person. They would not put two young children in a room with their parents so a second room was necessary.There was a nice view of the ocean from our room. Public bus and subway transportation was convenient to the hotel. The included breakfast buffet was large and well stocked and they appeared used to dealing with children. The main drawback was the high cost of the rooms (we had 4) which I would not have agreed to if it had not been arranged by the cruise line.",3,2017,09,02
36,"location amazing, staff service levels poor","great location next to the sea, taxi rank and shopping centre next to the hotel. Room basic. Bathroom bit mouldy shower curtain but cleaning very good otherwise. Window could open which was great. airco worked well. Nice view on the sea. Comfy sleeping. Internet worked well. Breakfast was very good with a lot of choice and quite good quality. I didn't enjoy the plates were taken away as soon as you finished and I had to keep passing items to the waiter as they asked for it to clear as soon as I had the last bite of something. Prefer they take it a bit easier. Instead they didn't pour coffee for you, but rather stood next to the pot, bit weird and I find it very welcoiming when someone pours it when you arrive. Checkout took ages with a very long queue and the lady at reception, alba, was very rude to me. she insisted I paud for items on the bill that were not mine and even when she got her manager to approve to take the mistakes off she was very rude with me and didn't say goodbye. Left me with a very bad feeling, very poor customer service indeed. Had taken me almost an hour to check out and then be treated like that for no reason. other than perhaps stress by the girl, but I find that very unprofessional and have not experienced that before in any other Hilton. Overall okay apart from the service.",3,2017,09,02
36,"great location, service level to be improved","great location next to the sea, next to shopping centre and taxi rank. Check in was quick and friendly, though later it appeared the Hilton membership card I offered hadn't been entered into the system at check in. Hotel looked very nice overall, room was a bit dated with unfresh shower curtain, but okay overall. I was very happy I could open the window and loved view on the sea. Airconditioning also worked well. Toiletries were very basic, no slippers or bathrobe. Enough plugs and enough space to put my things, big enough room to feel comfy for a week. Breakfast was nice, a lot of items and quite fresh. nice you could sit outside too. Staff was not great at breakfast, they wouldn't pour your coffee, you had to do this yourself from coffee pots they had on the side whilst they were just standing there, I thought it was odd. what they did do was take every item away as soon as you'd finished it, which I found a little disturbing as I was trying to have my breakfast they kept asking me to pass the used plates etcetera. I prefer they do this at the end or maybe just halfway f there are a lot of things on the table (not the case with me). Sleeping comfort was good, quiet and comfy bed. Room service had nice choices including some local dishes. Quality was quite good for a room service. Miniar present and filled too. Check-out was a very long queue almost half an hour and an unprofessional and rude member of staff called Alba who presented me with an inaccurate bill that had items on it from other people and one breakfast charge where I had a 6 night stay. she couldn't explain this but insisted I pay for it. She got her manager to approve removing the item but was very cross with me I didn't pay it and thought I should have. It was a very unpleasant experience. Checkout lasted almost an hour and left me with a very rude reception lady who didn't say goodbye to me at the ened, even if I think I had been polite throughout, but just explaining I didn't want to pay for items that shouldn't be on the bill. All in all the hotel was good especially because of its location. If I was the manager I would get new shower curtains in and review the service level that my staff was offering. Cleaning staff was very friendly by the way and did a good job every morning in my room.",4,2017,09,01
36,Wonderful stay at a great hotel!,"This hotel is beautiful & in a great location. This was my first visit to Barcelona & Spain. I researched hotels for weeks & am so glad I stuck with this one. Hotel staff is very professional, speaks fluent English gave a good overview of the hotel & local area. I was checked in by Helena & she was very pleasant. I unfortunately did not get my Diamond members upgrade which was very disappointing. And I arrived early & had the Diamond desk request a suite. I reserved an Executive King & had to ask to be put on a high floor with sea view. I stayed on the 20th floor. The seaview was obstructed by buildings. These rooms are nice & modern, but tiny. With those sea views & breezes, it would be great if the rooms had balconies/terraces, which would also add much needed space.
Anyway, the Executive lounge is Wonderful. Great breakfast & evening snacks, but no bottled water. That was super strange, especially since they have lots of other drink options. They do need to get extra stations in the morning for coffee & hot water for tea. Those lines get really long & that's an easy fix. The Executive lounge indoor/outdoor dining areas are both great & staff was very professional & attentive, especially Mohammed. 
The hotel location is perfect! Close to the beach, museum blau, tour buses, great mall with good restaurant options, quick taxi services. The pool looked nice but I didn't visit. Went to the beach & city only. Overall my husband & I had a wonderful stay & we would definitely stay here again, but in a suite. Highly recommended!",5,2017,09,01
36,Modern hotel far from city center with fabulous pool terrace,"I stayed at this hotel for two nights in August. It is very modern and have a fantastic pool terrace with spa, bar and restaurant. The restaurant was very accommodating to my dietary needs. The room was large and well appointed. The internet worked very well. The onky downfall is the distance from city center. ",4,2017,08,31
36,"Good location, next to a mall, friendly","The hotel was situated outside the city centre and i have been to barcelona many times , so for me i wanted to try and get a location that was not too far and easily accessible from city and the beach.  Cabs are cheap there, and everything is 10 15 mins and you can walk up and down the beautiful beach - as it is near to the hotel and on vacation ideal in the weather.  Good staff clean rooms and a poolside club.  Taxis are always outside.  Good shower and clean room will stay here again.  Its got a pool club too thats bustling during the day, music, etc only downside s i can think was not enough veggie options to eat, and drinks overpriced but nothing new if you want luxury hotel.  

Right bang opposite a mall that has everything from food, to shoppin to a cinema so it was perfect location avoiding 100s of tourists as well in the city centre crowds.

I chooses these hotel because it was near to the beach and closed to the shopping mall. It makes me easy to get all the things I wanted to buy.

1 minute walk to the shopping mall. 5 minutes walk to the beach.
5 minutes walk to the metro station.
Very convenient!

You can also walk along the beach to the city centre roughly about 45 minutes. 

It was my first time checking these hotel. All the staffs are friendly, always helping if you have any requests. 

Very enjoyable stay with a wonderful pool. 

I will be back again. Thanks for the wonderful services, especially the lady cooking the omelettes for the breakfast. Although I didn't get her name. She makes my days. Thank you. ",5,2017,08,29
36,Great place but if American be mindful its Spain,"Wii stayed here because it was a part of Disney's post trip location hotel is in a wonderful area across from the mall there's a separated pool  area convenient overall great location clean Modern Hotel friendly belstaff in front desk people
",5,2017,08,29
36,Nice hotel,"A very nice hotel with a fantastic 'Executive Lounge' with great views of the city and beach. At the end of Diagonal, well connected by Tram and Metro, and across form the Diagonal Mar mall. Note that if you plan on dancing by the poolside, the DJ does not have dancing music, just some background beat music.",4,2017,08,29
36,One Night Stay Before Cruise,"This hotel was a pre Disney Cruise stay for us. We were required to reserve 2 rooms because they do not allow more then 2 guests in a room so it was quite expensive, but we felt it was necessary as we have had flight delays on previous cruises which resulted in a disastrous situation. The room  itself was of a modern decor. It was clean and comfortable for a one night stay. The location was far from the center of town so that was very inconvenient. However, there  was a shopping mall across the street and the beach was a few blocks away. The breakfast buffet was ample and offered a nice variety. There was also an omelette station but we think the regular chef might have been out or this person was in training because he was very slow and seemed inexperienced and the omelettes suffered. The front desk was welcoming although slow at getting us processed through and initially told us our room would not be ready for half an hour even though it was well after check in time. They were able to put us in another room that they found at the last minute. I was very disappointed that they could not have our two rooms next to each other or even on the same floor, despite the fact I made that request with the initial reservation ( months in advance) and then made another request online a week before. I felt there was no excuse for not accommodating us and heard another family complain to the front desk about the same thing. I would unfortunately not choose this hotel to return to if I return to Barcelona and would prefer to stay in town center.",3,2017,08,28
36,"Good location, could use a freshen up","I've stayed at Hilton Diagonal Mar in Barcelona 3 times for company events. 
The hotel itself is quite large and easy to get to as it is both on the diagonal and the seaside roads. The rooms have been clean at every stay, although some spots have traces of significant use. All in all, a standard Hilton hotel.",4,2017,08,28
36,POOR,Customer service is non existent at this hotel. Management does not care about guest experiences. Cleaning of the room is terrible. Really terrible. They only fix something if you complain but don't resolve to make sure that it doesn't happen again.,2,2017,08,28
36,Great business hotel with close access to shops and conference center,"Clean, efficient with friendly staff. Busy conference but handled with apparent ease and overt professionalism. Convenient shopping center across the road with the beach nearby. Quite a distance from La Rambla and most of the tourist sites but easy access to public transportation.",5,2017,08,27
36,POOR!!!!,"Having recently stayed there, I can honestly say we would never return to this hotel.  Room cleanliness terrible.  Sticky floors, bathroom towels not replaced unless you call housekeeping, counters not wiped down and bathroom soap (not body wash) is almost non-existent.  The breakfast staff are very friendly but things seem to go awry after you get placed at your table e.g. having coffee/tea brought to you and when you get back after choosing your breakfast, all items on the table have been removed and the table reset for the next guest!!  Management needs an overhaul with staff seeming lost with poor direction as to what their duties really are.  The biggest failure at this hotel is the incessant LOUD noise drifting up through to the rooms from the Puro Beach pool area.  While the area in itself during the day is relaxing, it's the continual pool party that goes on every evening until 3am with music, I'm sure, that is heard over most of that area of Barcelona.  Personally, I would only recommend this hotel for anyone under 30.  If you're after cleanliness, efficiency, good service and a restful atmosphere, give this hotel a big miss!!!!!",2,2017,08,25
36,"Nice hotel, pool ok - but you get charged for the sun beds.","Check in of 4 pm is extremely late and inconvenint. Check out is, after all, at 12 pm. I would have expected to find the room extremely clean. Instead it wasn't cleaned very well. This isn't really understandable given that they have ample time to clean the room between check out and the next check in. Also, no pot much effort was done for providing me with an upgrade. All I got was ""I'm sorry, it's not possible."" The hotel is quite far from the city center. It seems to be quite used by guests that are going on a cruise.",3,2017,08,24
36,Very satisfied ,"I maybe a bit harsh not going the full way and giving 5/5 but I just can't bring myself to. Maybe it's because I've just done a review for another hotel which was better and received a 5. 

The room was comfortable and well air conditioner. I was a little disappointed as a Hilton Honors Gold not to get a executive floor however I accept that if that's what I wished for i should have just booked it. 

The pool area is very glamorous as it's part of Puero Beach so be aware it's not ideal for kids or the self conscious. 

Breakfast had a large selection however it did get very busy and coffee service was slow. 

My main gripe was the reception desk which was always busy but only ever had two people working it meaning there was always a queue

Location wise it did the job for me and my 7 year old as there was a large playground opposite and lots of restaurants. If you wish to be right at the heart of things it may be a bit fat out. 

I'd happily stay there again but would gladly try somewhere else too. ",4,2017,08,23
36,Great Stay,"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay in this hotel. Lovely big bedroom, comfy huge bed, great bathroom. Very busy at breakfast but all the staff were great, very attentive and friendly. Excellent variety of food and drinks to choose from. They couldn't do enough for us. Good location across the road form the mall and restaurants. People who complain about it being busy and moaning about not being given their rooms earlier (than it states whilst booking) should get real, what makes you special and any different from the norm. 
Stay in this hotel, it's great! 
Thanks Hilton Diagonal Mar. ",5,2017,08,23
36,Great hotel,"Just got back from a short stay at the Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona. We had booked to stay at the Hilton before the terrible events of 17th August unfolded. We did think long and hard about cancelling the trip which was due to commence just two days later on the Saturday. In the event though, we decided to proceed as planned and notwithstanding our thoughts and feelings for all those poor people so tragically affected by the actions of just a few demented individuals, we were glad we didn't let them deter us.

We are regular customers of the Hilton group and Hilton Honors members, using their hotels all around the world and so feel well placed to make a considered judgement on this hotel.

So as far  as 'city' Hiltons' go this is a good one and  well situated too, for the beach (about 300 meters across the road) and with easy access by Taxi to the centre of the city (about 12-15 EUR). There's a great shopping centre just across the road on the other side which is literally 1-2 minutes walk from the hotel lobby.

There's loads of shops and restaurants there with a great variety for all tastes and budgets. The range of outlets was actually pleasantly surprising in that respect. Still we didn't go there to spend our time in a shopping centre! But for anyone with families and young children and budget to consider you won't be disappointed by the choice.

The rooms in the hotel are great and the family room we had was very spacious and well furnished with a super side view of the ocean and a great panoramic view of the whole city. We were on the 11th floor by the way. 

As usual the Hilton buffet breakfast was great and superb value for money. The staff in all departments were very friendly and very helpful to all our requests during our 4 day stay.

There's a perfectly adequate Gym in the hotel located on the second floor and part of what we think is probably the best asset of this hotel-  the Puro Beach club located on the second floor of the hotel. Now as far as roof top hotel swimming pool facilities go; it doesn't get much better than this. 

The area is extensive and the bar area is truly lovely with great aura of calm and a very relaxing vibe. There's plenty of seating and sun beds available. Admittedly if you want to be right by the poolside then you will have to pay for the privilege but at 20 EUR a day its considerably cheaper than what you'd pay for much less on the beach below. If you are are a guest then you can still have a sun bed for free, but that might be slightly shaded by the pagodas. 

Irrespective of that this was a wonderful surprise and a great place to spend a hot sunny day and being some fifty feet up I guess; whenever there's a breeze off the shore you get the full benefit of it.

Admittedly some might find this place over the top and a little too 'pimped' for their taste, but despite my usually somewhat conservative attitude to such places, I found it to be a super place,  made more so by the truly great staff that work hard there in what are not easy conditions. 

So if you are planning a trip to Barcelona then I would thoroughly recommend this Hotel which in my opinion does all that it says on the tin and more and offers the relaxation of a beach location/vacation as well as easy access to all the sites of the city via a 24 taxi rank just across the street.

For the record we are travellers in our mid 50's with teenage children.",5,2017,08,23
36,Manager saved the day with world class service  ,"I stayed here with my wife and we had a few issues after checking in but then the manager on duty Miguel Angel came in and saved the day with a world class 5 star service. 

Hotel location is excellent and close to the beach. ",4,2017,08,22
36,Comedy of errors,"Booked two rooms. One double beds on king. One party checked in after noon and was given the wrong room. Got the twin instead of the king. When we checked in late at night was given the king. Went down to resolved issue and front desk stated it was our fault as we had checked in on their website. Gave us a room with twins which turned out to be a handicap room with no shower. Return to complain and told that was all they had. After insisting they gave me a twin not before locking out our luggage in the handicap room. Had to go down again to get that room unlocked. Then told I was the other agents fault because he only was told to change the rooms. Room did not have toiletries like soap. Next day even thou the hotel was full two of the  four elevators were not working so waits of 45 mts or more were common. People checking out from lower floors would just ride the elevator up because if you waited for it to come down it wouldn't stop as it was full to capacity. Went to the ""free breakfast "" to be told we were not entitled because the front desk had not advised them. Hostess had to call the front desk but because of the long line for checkout nobody answered the phone. 
The hotel porters are non existent. You arrive and there is nobody to help with the baggage. The lines at the front desk are always long no matter the time of day. Tried to book a dinner reservation at the main restaurant for 7 pm and called at 6 pm and when they answered the phone was told they were busy preparing for opening and to call back later. Maybe it's because it's August and they are too busy but I have stayed at this hotel for the last 5 years and this has to be the worst stay at a Hilton property. And I am a Diamond member!",1,2017,08,22
36,Family holiday,Have been to this hotel several times excellent location good shopping mall close to beach and tube would definitely go back again. Pool a bit over the top for my liking and pushy with trying to sell you beds. However really like this hotel and executive lounge is fantastic and if you are not a diamond member I would advise anyone to pay the extra,5,2017,08,22
36,Really enjoyable stay,"I arrived at the hotel at 2pm with my 12 year old son. 

There was a long queue at the reception check in but the staff were dealing with it as quickly as they could 

When it was our turn to check in, Maria asked if it was just myself and my son who would be using the room. When I replied that yes this was the case, she had a brief conversation with the manager and upgraded us to an executive room with sea views on the top floor of the hotel! We were delighted

As we were on the 23rd floor, one minor niggle was the amount of time it took to go up or down in the lift. One morning we waited 25 minutes as it was peak time and the lift stopped on every floor 

The breakfast was delicious and catered for everyone - the choice was enormous and my son was delighted to be treated to Nutella on pancakes or waffles every morning 

The terrorist attack occurred on our last day in Barcelona and the hotel staff couldn't have been more pleasant, accommodating or reassuring. We chose to eat in the hotel restaurant and had a lovely meal at a reduced rate 

The hotel is close to beaches but it is a fair distance away from the centre of Barcelona. Hotel staff provided us with maps and information about the metro and tram system and we found it very easy to use (and very cheap)

The pool was lovely albeit it is owned by Puro Beach not the Hilton and yes you do have to pay extra for the premium sunbeds 

However I used the non premium ones which are free for hotel guests and still came home with a lovely tan 

All in all, I would highly recommend the hotel 👍🏻",4,2017,08,21
36,Perfect Location for Family Vacation,"I high recommend this hotel for its location and service. The hotel is close to a shopping mall and the beach, and it is easy to take taxi to the airport and the subway to the downtown. The front desk is a bit busy or slow around noon but the staff are very helpful.",5,2017,08,21
36,Swimming pool - terrible experience,"This hotel doesn't mind to let their hotel guests pay 20 to 30 euros to have access to the purobeach swimming pool area located outside on floor 2. 
We preferred to go to the beach only 2 minutes walk away. But again a bad customer experience. The hotel does not give beach towels to their guests. Impossible ... prohibited by the management ... were the reaction from the towels boys at the swimming pool. They would prefer their guests take secretly their room towels to the beach. They would not mind if their do not know ... so the official reaction. Same reaction the following day. The manager on duty tried to explain that this is the official hotel's position. Not very convincing. They would loose every year a lot of towels because guests would not return the towels after their beach trip. We told them about an efficient tool to manage this: ask the guests for their room number and let them pay in case of no return. Manifestly to complicated to understand for the manager. They prefer to punish honest guests because of a few others and their incompetence to manage correctly. At the end of the day we had 2 hours of endless discussions with managers for whom customer experience and friendliness seem to be words from an outside world. Not acceptable. Incredible ... and this bad experience only because of a few towels. Definitely a reason not to check in again at this hotel

Asked to wait 30min and still not ready. Our friends we were travelling with were checked in and ready to go and we were still waiting for room. 
1 1/2 hours later we have our room 
Check in service poor 
Breakfast good but staff wander around without asking if you want coffee. 
",2,2017,08,20
36,Good hotel,"I'm a regular visitor to Barcelona and have stayed at this hotel numerous times.

The hotel is in a good location and the beach is 5 minutes walk away, and port is 10 minutes taxi away.

Rooms at the hotel are fine and what you would expect from Hilton.  Executive rooms are nice with great views, plus access to the Executive lounge is worth it, particularly for early evening drinks.

Unfortunately, the pool is now run by an independent firm which means hotel guests have to book and pay for beds, which is a bit ridiculous.  On occasions beds have very limited availability, which is pretty poor as hotel guests don't take precedence.

Another negative is the restaurant - depending on when you visit and how busy the hotel is, breakfast is equivalent to a zoo, with long queues.

Those issues aside, it is a good hotel for business or a long weekend. ",3,2017,08,20
36,Hospitality at it's worst.,"As a frequent business traveler with Hilton Honor points, I opted to stay at this Hilton with my family after a cruise porting in Barcelona.  However, unlike others on the cruise who booked their rooms for this Hilton directly through the cruise line; we experienced no courtesies trying to get an earlier check-in.  Even being a Hilton Honors Gold member and having a child who was sick with a fever and cold after getting off the cruise couldn't get the front desk to acknowledge their concern or offer any solutions to get our son to a bed before their standard 4pm check-in time.  We arrived with other cruise guests to the hotel around 9 am in the morning and watched others get earlier check-ins (that booked directly through the cruise line).  So, as a Hilton Honors member, we felt like second-class citizens from the start.  The strangest thing of it all is that I had already checked-in online through their Hilton Honors app but once arriving to the hotel--that didn't matter.  We were told that we would be contacted should a room become available earlier.  For most of the day, we waited in the lobby with our feverish child and leaving for a while to find our children some food and water across the street.  We would check back with the front desk frequently to inquire on the status of the room only to be told that no rooms were available because other families were staying later than the 12:00 PM check-out time.  The front desk staff were a great example of some of the worst hospitality and lack of empathy I've ever experienced in a Hilton Hotel.  

We checked on our room situation throughout the day and again around 3:20 PM to be told the rooms were still not clean.  Seriously?  They could not tell housekeeping to clean one room in the entire hotel for a sick kid?  What a joke of a hotel.  Does anyone here know how to be customer-service oriented or a be a problem solver?

However, at exactly 4 pm in the afternoon during the standard check-in time; and not a moment sooner--miraculously the room was ready.  

After putting my son to bed, ironically I see a letter from the hotel area manager on the night stand to guests of the hotel commenting on their great service, hospitality and amenities including the ""relaxing"" pool.

The Pool:  LOUD. CLUB-LIKE. EXTRA FEE.  This should be disclosed by the Hilton when you book...that prime seating around the pool are only available for an additional fee to a company that rents the seating.  If you're a Hilton guest, you must sit in a patio area about 20 feet away from the pool.  Otherwise, you can pay extra to sit around the pool with the non-hotel guests that are using this area for more of a club atmosphere catering to the Millenials single crowd with loud music.

Elevators:  Are very slow.  Lots of people from and outside the hotel heading to the Club Pool area.  The Hotel really needs to invest in a better way of allowing people access to the pool area instead of letting them use the elevators with all hotel family and business guests with appointments and meetings to get to.

Location:  It is in a good area close to the beach and near a shopping mall.",2,2017,08,20
36,Excelrnt hotel,"We stayed at the hotel during family vacation in 2 rooms on a BB basis
The rooms are spacious, comfortable and very clean
The crew was very kind and hospitable  
The breakfast was very rich

The great shopping center and the great restaurants just under the hotel are a big advantage
Bottom line… much recommended as Hilton hotels usually are",4,2017,08,19

36,Spacious hotel away from the crowds,"At this point in our trip we wanted to relax in large facilities rather than another boutique - this fit perfectly.  Location is a quick cab ride away from the Gothic Quarter, and the mall across the street has many reasonable places to eat if you wish to stay close.  The hotel was up to Hilton standards.",4,2017,08,19
36,posh hilton,"very nice hotel with more of a lounge vibe to it.  the pool is really nice but a little on the pretentious side with very expensive food and drinks.  Felt a little like a Las Vegas pool scene. easy metro ride to all the attractions.

36,"Average Stay, look elsewhere","We went for a weekend getaway, used points, and came into a room with no AC and no sign of the Hilton Jamon tray I ordered in advance.  I found the staff helpful but the rest of the hotel expensive.  

I would recommend for the price to look elsewhere.  This hotel is centered around the beach club that was expensive.  ",3,2017,08,17
36,Wedding anniversary break.,"Fantastic 6 night stay at this well located hotel in beautiful Barcelona. Hotel is very clean, staff fabulous, informative and helpful. 
Breakfast very busy, food selection extensive,fresh and delicious. If you can get a table outside on the balcony go for it more relaxing than sitting in the main restaurant. 
Pool area is Purobeach sunbeds and must be booked in advance for 10e to 30e each expensive but exspected. Music very monotonous........
Drinks and food expensive too 15e for 1 ices Mojito(delicious though) This was an enjoyable way to spend sometime off the beautiful beach, which by the way is around the corner from hotel.
Had a fabulous time and would definatley stay again at this hotel.",4,2017,08,17
36,Slow evalator,"Ok services with few staffs but can not compare with other Hiltons so far...Good location but too pack of guess. Room is nice. Evalators are super slow, you are better prepare sometime for check out while all is full of guests",3,2017,08,17
36,You're Paying For The Ambiance,"We wanted to sit out on the terrace, and take in a lovely view. We paid for it. The non-alcoholic smoothies were delicious, but €14 each. 

We ordered a ""basket of bread"" which was 3 small rolls and 2 pieces of mini-toast for €6. Surprisingly, the bread came with a side of mayonnaise-not butter.

I ordered a chicken Caesar salad, which was mediocre at best, and drenched in dressing.(€18)

My companion ordered the swordfish. It was a small cut with vegetables. The dish was adequate, but not spectacular.(€36)

Overall, the meal was OK. It was a trendy location- near the pool-and the prices reflected that.  It was a decent experience because of the ambience, but I wouldn't recommend it if you are dying to have a great meal in Barcelona. 

Some people sitting around us were smoking hookah. When we asked about the price of the hookahs, we were told it started at €100.

36,Hilton diagonal mar,Stayed here for 5 nights. Very close to the beach and right opposite a mall. The hotel was very nice and enjoyable but the check in procedure could be a bit better. It was past 4 and we had to wait for the rooms to still be cleaned and we were tired from our flight.,4,2017,08,16
36,High Value with the Price,"It took just 40 EUR from Airport to hotel. The hotel has very nice lounge at 15th floor, where I spent time to relax with very nice view, especially at sunset. I could even see the Sagrada Familia from the lounge. The wether was very hot, but I can go to the beach from hotel, which takes less than 10 min. Very nice location. The lady at the lounge always gave us a nice smile, and talked to us. I will be back to the hotel for sure. Many Many Thanks. One thing for the hotel to improve is the key-card, which often didn't work, so we changed 3 times for 4 days stays.",5,2017,08,16
36,Hilton? the worst that I have been to.,"It is hard to find a hotel in Barcelona. That rooms were available in this hotel, seemed like a stroke of luck. It was not. The hotel is expensive. Not expensive for the Hilton brand but for the service and comfort (or lack there of ) that it offers. Except for the Hilton brand and the room with dated tasteful furnishings - this is  a rip off. The hotel is clearly short on staff. They are overworked and struggling to manage the demands of the guests.
To put it simply, the service sucks. The check in takes forever. The lobby is like a fish market. The welcome drink is self help, jugs of orange juice on a table in the middle of everywhere with glasses on a side. No one offers it to you.As a Hilton Honors member, I am entitled to quick check in and check out - none of that. 
We had booked a room for 3 people. However there are no triple rooms, so we were given a double room. Someone was to set up a roll away bed in our room - when available. We were calling people till 10pm to get a roll-away bed. we did. It was good enough for a child. We were three adults. 
The carpet had stains. The corridors reeked of some strange smell. It became over bearing on and off. 
We had a pool facing room. Loud music pierced through closed windows. And when we decided to just go to the pool and chill out, turned out that the pool is not free for Hilton guests and had some obnoxious extra charge. There are no complimentary water bottled. The minibar will be charged even if you move an item from its location in the fridge. 
The Bathroom was spacious. But the commode and bidet setting facing each other -makes one wonder if the architect ever really used a bidet. The shower had a lose joint, and had a sprout of water going in all directions.  Creating puddles in the bathroom. 
The car park is charged extra. They say its the same if you use the valet service or not. We decided to ask the valet to bring our car as we went out in the evening. After 20 mins of waiting and asking around the car showed up. When my brother commented (cheerfully, to my surprise) "" shall I fetch it myself next time "" .. the staff, rushing back to the hotel turned his hands up in the air and said  ""as you wish"" without even looking at us. 
Perhaps the only nice person I met at the hotel was the bartender who managed to smile and wished me to enjoy m meal, as I stopped to grab cutlery for my dinner. (couldn't wait for the room service to take ages).
The location is nice. The diaganol del mar mall and food area is right opposite to the hotel. The area is great for late walks or early morning run. The beach is walkable. But, do yourself a favor- stay else where. Barcelona is too beautiful to be ruined by this hotel.",1,2017,08,14
36,"Great Hotel, Poor Food","The hotel is nice, clean, and located under 5 minute walk to the beach.  It is however, far east from city center main neighborhoods such as El Born and Gotic.  The metri is a quick 2 blocks away. This hotel is more in the business district as opposed to tourist area.    Puro Beach, the rooftop pool is really nice and a great atmosphere.  The food at this hotel is sub-par.  I ate breakfast and lunch here.  The quality of the food is below what I would expect from a Hilton.",4,2017,08,14
36,Amazing team at Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona,"Staying at the Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona after an unfortunate robbery causing me to lose my passports, wallets, etc.  The nightmare was made a bit more bearable by the AMAZING front office team of Constantine, Judith, Leonardo and Ana, who worked with us for hours to find us a room at the peak of the tourist season when hotels are packed.  Whilst they could not find us a room on the first night as they were totally booked, they did come through for our second night.  Not only did they go out of their way to help, they were patient and empathetic, pleasant and professional.  Also during our time of stress they did everything that they promised and more, called us back when they said they would to keep us updated, dealt directly with Hilton Honors as we needed to use reward points since our cash and cards were stolen, and the list goes on.

The hotel is in a great location near the beach and the largest mall in Barcelona, is clearly very well managed with well equipped rooms, however it is the service that makes this property stand out.

I was already a loyal Diamond member of Hilton Honors, but this experience has further entrenched Hilton as my absolute favorite hotel chain in the world!!

Hurrah to the Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona team!!

36,Good hotel located near a great mall,"The hotel is a bit outside the city center, however, the staff is warm and friendly. It's located right next to a great mall with excellent food. The pool is outstanding, and a great place to relax in the Spain summer.",4,2017,08,13
36,Vaccation in Barcelona,A very nice hotel close to Barcelona beach. The pool area is nice but maybee to bysy during the weekends. A special thanks to David the supervisor in the restaurant . He make our stay very special. From a Diamond member,4,2017,08,12
36,Average/poor,"Bad start with a long check in process: the young lady was just polite and took ages to check us in (for a prepaid stay!).
Room was okay but amenities were not properly replaced for instance, the firts day we used the whole shampoo, and the following day we had 2 conditioners instead of a replacement shampoo.
Small things like this are not of great importance but do make the difference for the customer, and show some training is missing.

A good mark to the young lady at the bar in the lobby: smiling, courteous, committed and efficient. Bravo la regazza!

Check out was also a nightmare with 20mn queues on 4 counters. I know the hotel seemed to be quite busy but to me it is a question of organisation, process, training and management.

Surprising for a Hilton, indeed.",3,2017,08,12
36,DON'T LET THEM AWAY WITH IT,"On our first day we went down to lie by the pool to be told we had to pay between 10-30 euros per person depending on how close we wanted to be by the pool. We thought this was a joke as we were residents of the hotel. This was not a sick joke! It is a beach club so the Hilton make their money from hen and stag parties particularly at the weekend.  We felt like second class citizens as we felt that the Hilton were more interested in making money from non residents using the beach club than residents of the hotel. We complained so did not have to pay for our sunbed so follow our example COMPLAIN. On our last day which was a Saturday the rave music started at 12 noon and got louder as the afternoon went on so much so that the lady beside us had to go to her room with a headache. You could only block out the boom boom for so long, so we complained to the manager, while I was complaining other residents also complained. HILTON hang your head in shame, a hotel should never have a beach club attached to it and there should never be any charges for lying by a pool.

We will never be back at this hotel and would definitely not recommend it to anyone.",2,2017,08,11
36,Pre-cruise stay,"Booked through cruise line (Disney) as a place to stay pre-cruise and to see Barcelona. Rooms are neat and clean.  Location is very convenient to cruse terminal (~20min), beach, shopping, and Metro to popular tourist sites. Trying to book direct we couldn't get 2 rooms for 5 people but via cruise booking it was no problem (they set up a roll-away in one of the rooms for our son and it was very comfy).  The included breakfast is very good.  Check-In was long and there always seemed to be a line.  They should do more to prep check-ins to make the process speedier.  Food at the bar in lobby was very good but quite pricey, as were the drinks.  We did not use the pool but we did take the short walk to the beach.  Metro station (very easy to use and cheap) was a few blocks away and hotel provided a nice map of tourist locations.  Don't know if I would stay for an extended vacation but it was great for a pre-cruise stay.",4,2017,08,10
36,Great location and safe area,"We enjoyed our stay at the hotel for a great location 200 meters from the beach and almost the same to nearest metro station 
We had a very good care from the duty manager Ms Rocio Fontela

I would like personally to thank her for the great welcome and her effort to make our stay comfortable",5,2017,08,09
36,"In term of 4* standards hotel, this hotel IS NOT ONE OF THE best!","1. Some missing items from the room:
- Part of personal hygiene kit
- Slippers
- Bathrobe
- Beer opener
...
I asked and I received! For two people: 6 bathrobe, a lot of slippers, 3-4 towels/per day! 

2. Is possible to have some experiences with rude personal. I've had two with the employee of the omelet pan, in the same day.

3. There are no full information concerning the guarantty/deposit per night.
4. There is a smell, on the hall of 11th floor.

Conclusion: In term of 4* standards, this hotel is not one of the best.",3,2017,08,09
36,Convenient,"Overall we were pleased with our stay. The room was comfortable and taxis line up at the street corner, making it very convenient to get anywhere in the city.  We paid for our room with points, but were also charged the full rate upon checkout despite showing my points receipt. However, we were refunded after making a phone call and some emails with Hilton Honors. ",4,2017,08,08
36,Great hotel but too far away from city center,"The Hotel itself is wonderful.  Top notch staff, excellent rooms, super executive lounge, ocean views.  Everything one would expect from a Hilton.  

But it is a 20 minute taxi ride or metro ride from any major attraction, which really takes a bite out of your day.  If going to Montserrat, the train station is on the other side of town, about a 40 minute journey by metro.  All in all, if sightseeing is your main goal, a hotel closer to city center should be considered.  It is a five minute walk to a lifeguarded beach if that is goal of your trip.

Again, the hotel itself is wonderful.  The executive lounge concierge was particularly helpful to us and her recommendations were spot on.",4,2017,08,08
36,Underwhelming,"In terms of Hilton standards, this is not one of the best. The service was slow and sloppy, the hotel amenities were very basic and even though use of the pool is free the sun beds are charged. The hotel is clean and the breakfast is ok but the rest were below my expectations.",4,2017,08,08
36,Good hotel,"Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona is located in the northeast of Barcelona (Forum / El Maresme) which is a little bit far away from the downtown, but on the positive side it has a spectacular view over Barcelona skyline from the upper floor.

They also have a nice gym and beach club in the second floor for which I unfortunately don't have any time to use since I'd like to explore Barcelona more.

Due to my HH Gold, I got upgraded in the junior suite and was also given a complimentary access to their executive lounge. The breakfast in the following morning was rich enough for me. There are basically two options fo the breakfast: in the lower floor with more options but could be a little bit crowded or in the executive lounge which is less crowded but with less choices as well.

I was satisfied with my stay and I wouldn't mind to stay there again.",5,2017,08,08
36,Excellently located and Wonderful Accomadations,"The accomadations were wonderful.  Beautiful hotel.  Comfortable beds.  The hotel was well sitiuated next to a shopping centre, walking distance to beautiful beaches and dinning at the port nearby.  Few blocks away from metro system, with only a few stops to major attractions.  

A very heartfelt thank you to the knowledgable staff and especially Francesco at the front desk for superb service and making our stay even more enjoyable.",5,2017,08,08
36,A Short Break at a big chain hotel with excellent service,"We stayed for a few days and were very impressed with the hotel, the rooms, the cleanliness, the food and, most importantly, the very friendly and helpful staff.  They went out of their way to be helpful and pleasant and, though expensive to stay there, it was well worth it and we would return.",5,2017,08,07
36,Very good family hotel,"we stayed there for 5 nights with two kids. We had a junior suite which ideal for a family of four. 

the hotel is really nice. close to the beach and to a shopping mall. there is huge playground in the mall where kids can play. The executive lounge has a kids area for the children (my kids preferred to have breakfast there because of that).

service is very nice in all areas of the hotel. we didn't try the pool.

I definitely recommend this hotel to anyone teaseling with their family.",5,2017,08,07
36,Good hotel,A nice hotel for a break. It has an excellent location with access to the beach and shops and good access to public transport. Customer service was very good with polite and helpful staff throughout. TV choice is quite limited for a hotel of this standard. Only downside to the place is the pool area. At time of booking it looked as if the pool area was part of the hotel but it is run separately from the hotel as a sort of franchise. Music blasts out around the pool so it's not the most restful of places. ,4,2017,08,07
36,Weekend break,"All was going well until we decided to take advantage of the room service which was not good. The Caesar salad was fine but the Hilton burger was served raw and furs cold. Without going in to detail the service afterward was terrible. The Hotel ""if you're not satisfied with your stay, let us know and we'll make it right"" simply didn't work. We sent both meals back and the Hilton didn't ""Make it right"".",3,2017,08,06
36,Excellent property.....,"Beautiful property on diagonal mar. Next to diagonal mar mall. Large lobby with helpful front office staff. Rooms are very spacious and lot of them are sea facing. Elaborate breakfast with sitting even outside which is a welcome break. Although the hotel initially mixed up rooms for us and gave wrong beds, however the same was quickly rectified by their side. Overall if you are in Barcelona, this is good property to stay and venture out in the city.",5,2017,08,06
36,Great hotel but limited upgrade availability,"Nice comfortable hotel and really helpful and awesome staff. Only two issues, 1) the hotel tends to get very busy with cruise lines so if you are expecting upgrades based on your Hhonors elite status, then good luck. I stayed here 5 nights and every night the front desk staff asked me to check tomorrow for upgrade availability. None was found. 2) it is a little far from airport so taxi is your best transportation option to and from airport. Metro is only 8 minutes walk away but will need to change twice to get to/from airport.    Other than the above, it is a great hotel, next to the beach and a shopping mall and really helpful staff which makes a big difference.",4,2017,08,06
36,Great Service - good location ,"Friendly staff
Flexible for late check out 
Attentive specially room service
Good location specially in front of the mall and restaurants
Rooms were new
Nice view
Taxis are available on the corner
Nice lobby lounge serving snacks and sandwiches 
",5,2017,08,05
36,"Out of the center, convenient to the beach","This hotel was a long way from the airport via the metro, nearly at the end of the line.  It is relatively close to the station with the Diagonal Mar shopping mall in between; there is a supermarket in the mall.  The beach is a few blocks away.  

I enjoyed a smoothie and sun at PuroBeach.  The service on the pool deck was friendly and attentive.  The room was comfortable but the in-room coffee was poor.

I expected more from this property.  Hilton allows guests to check in to rooms prior to arrival.  I used the app and was surprised upon check in that I was given a different room on a lower floor further from the ocean view.  Also, the Honors breakfast amenity was not available and the promised points were not added to my account.  

Overall, this property seemed to be more of a convention hotel and I was not their preferred clientele.  Given so many wonderful hotels in Barcelona, I will not return.",4,2017,08,05
36,Great hotel out of city center,"I stayed at this hotel for a convention. It was great as it was right next door to the convention center. My room, corner unit, was very large and so was the bathroom. The bed was very comfortable and blinds kept out all light from the room! Even though I was very jetlaged, got to enjoy good night sleeps. The breakfast buffet was worthy of a 5-star hotel. A lot of choice and very good quality. The only thing that was unfortunate was the distance to city center. However, it was right next to the beach. Very nice beach, would go for a walk every day around 5:00 PM and could walk for miles. You see a lot of people jogging along that boardwalk. The gym is quite small, hence why I went outside rather than to the gym.",5,2017,08,04
36,"Best view over Barcelona, fantastic outdoor lounge ","Stayed here for 3 nights at the 21st floor's Club executive suite.
Love this hotel, my 6th stay in between the last years. It's pretty close to the beaches of Marbella and has good connections by train, bus and subway.
The staff in the executive lounge and at the main breakfast area was super attentive and helpful.

Thank you management ",5,2017,08,04
36,"Reliable, satisfying and full of great surprises.","Hilton is never changing - you know what you are getting and in many ways it's like coming home - not always perfect but always happy, comfortable and satisfying. They do not fail you. Too dare crisp and elegant - maybe not massive but they are good. 
The service is lovely, people working here are lovely. 
Overall, would always stay again. This brand is iconic for a reason; they work very hard to please. In my opinion, they mostly succeed. ",4,2017,08,03
36,Diagonal Mar,"Good hotel in a reasonable location close to metro and beach, purobeach pool is available to hotel guests but sun dloungers are charged for an in my opinion are very expensive. Breakfast is very good although the queue can get very long at peak times",4,2017,08,03
36,Anniversary Vacation ,"Well placed property. Shopping mall, Diagonal Mar, with great shopping, restaurants located just across from the hotel.  Taxis available right outside the hotel entrance is a great plus!  Staff really professional helpful.  Alba, Helena at the front desk are an asset to the hotel.  Sylvia at the lobby bar is awesome. She provided great friendly service and much needed guidance for the day before we ventured out to the city.   Rooms are getting an upgrade; ours was already done to modern scale. BUT lacks soundproofing, you can hear most activites of room neighbours. PuroBeach Club runs the hotel pool/club area.   Really up scale to be prepared to spend some $$€€ if you intend to use the club!   Housekeeping always on point! !  Great stay so far! ",4,2017,08,03
36,Absolutely wonderful,"We booked a short holiday for the weekend as a get away during the summer holidays. From start to finish the hotel was absolutely amazing. Extremely good location with amazing staff and wonderful rooms. The hotel staff were extremely friendly. Accommodating my venture at 3 in the morning to the lobby by keeping the bigger lights on. The staff at breakfast were extremely helpful and very fast, the quality of the food at breakfast was satisfying. Breakfast almost everything you could think of. The timing for breakfast was reasonable as some hotels have extremely early times for breakfast. The room was a good size, beds very comfortable. There was plenty of storage space and the staff gave us a nice semi-sea view

The location of the hotel is prime. There is a bus stop for the City Bus Tour outside of the hotel, which costs less than 40 euros. Opposite the hotel is a massive shopping mall with many places to eat, accommodating halal needs. The shops within the mall ranged from high-end fashion to shops like Primark. A couple minutes walk away is the beach, making it easy to go at any time of the day. I never used the hotel pool as the beach was so close!

Overall, I would definitely stay again at this hotel. Staff were wonderful, along with the location.",5,2017,08,03
36,Good location,Hotel is near the beach and not far from city center. The line at check in was long but other than that my experience was great. I let a review on the Hilton website and the manager emailed me and apologized for the lines.,5,2017,08,02
36,City break ,"I stayed here last week as part of my honeymoon. The hotel staff were amazing. Our first contact was with Alba at reception and she was amazing - she provided tonnes of information about Barcelona that helped us decide how to spend our time. Thank you Alba! 
Breakfast was absolutely fantastic! The selection was great - continental and British. The breakfast staff were all pleasant.
Our room was clean and comfortable. We booked a room with a sea view and I'm glad we made that decision. There were blackout curtains so we slept really well. 
The location is a little ways from the city centre. My husband and I like to walk to that didn't matter to us. There are also tonnes of transit stops or tourist bus stops within a short decision. The hotel is a 5 minute walk from the beach. It's a nice and quiet part of the beach. 
The only complaint I have is that I don't feel as though it was made clear that the hotel doesn't actually have a pool. There is a pool at the location, but it's owned by a separate company and guests have to pay for a bed. The rate is apparently reduced for hotel guests but I was still disappointed with this. Drinks and food at the pool are expensive. Just go to the beach! ",4,2017,08,02
36,Disappointed ,"I have to admit, we had a lovely first few days at the Hilton. My three sisters and I took our mother as a surprise for her 50th birthday. 

The rooms were lovely and one of the ladies on reception was most helpful, giving us tour information and even setting up a bottle of cava with a birthday cake for our mum. 

Location was good, near to the sea and next to a shopping centre. Also close to the train and metro stations. 

We spent the first three days touring around the city and were looking forwards to our last day by the pool to relax. 

We checked with reception the night before, that as we were checking out at 12 the next day and wanted to use the pool, we would we be able to shower. The receptionist said yes. Although the showers in the gym were out of order, there were showers downstairs. Perfect. 

We slathered ourselves in sun cream and paid for sunbeds. We all had a swim, got our hair wet and then unfortunately it was time to leave. Off we went to the downstairs showers. To our disappointment, no showers. We thought we must have got the wrong place. We went back to reception and apologised as we thought we had got it wrong. We hadn't. The receptionist the night before had got it wrong. No showers facilities. None!! 

We politely asked in reception if there were any other shower facilities. The answer - no. When asked what we were supposed to do, sopping wet through, full of sun cream and chlorine, about to board a flight home - change in the toilets. We even asked if we could have a room just for an hour to shower and change in. No. 'Fully booked' they said. (Upon checking their website, there were rooms available). 

We had to change in the toilets. Not wash our hair, not shower, but change in public toilets with other customers. We actually met another lady who was complaining about the same problem. To send paying customers home without a shower is disgusting. 

We are all extremely disappointed about the lack of service and facilities provided by Hilton. We expected a lot more. ",3,2017,08,02
36,Day By The Pool,"While I was enjoying my vacation in Barcelona, a friend and I figured to go poolside for our last day. We researched this location which is a little outside the city limits. Upon arrival the staff wasn't very welcoming, however, we did get out sunbeds. The wait staff we all very friendly, accommodating and attentive. The service time was a little slower yet was to be expected knowing how service is in Barcelona. The food was quite enjoyable, however swallowing the price was less than enjoyable. All in all a great day was had, would definitely go back.",4,2017,08,02
36,Poor Housekeeping service,"While the hotel is nice, and the overall staffing is good, the housekeeping is terrible.  I had to wait 2 hours past the check-in to get my room (and I certainly was not the only one).   One afternoon I returned at 4:30 and my room had not been cleaned.   I have never stayed in a Hilton with worse housekeeping service.",3,2017,08,02
36,Can't fault the place,"Stayed for 4 nights at the end of July just me and my 12 yr old daughter.We picked the Hilton for its location to the beach and shopping centre.Check in was a little slow but queuing is part of life,staff were all friendly and helpful when needed,the room was great with everything you might need on holiday,it was also cleaned on a daily basis.The breakfast was excellent,and as a ""Brit abroad"" I enjoyed a full English every morning.We only went to the purobeach on one occasion as the beach is only 5 mins away with great beach bars.The purobeach pool area has a great setting,very chilled and relaxed,however as mentioned in other posts it's not what you call cheap,loungers are charged at 20 euro each,with similar high prices for food and drink,2 loungers,nachos,patas bravas,2 smoothies and 2 cocktails came to around £135,which isn't a problem but could get expensive over 7 days.......All in all I would definitely recommend this hotel,yes it isn't cheap but remember your in an amazing Spanish city and everything comes at a premium.",4,2017,08,02
36,Very Average- customer service poor. Puro beach- amazing ,"We stayed at the Hilton for 6 nights at the end of July. The hotel downstairs is clean and the rooms are spacious. Puro beach is definitely the best part about the hotel!
On the whole we felt that the customer service and performance was pretty poor for a 4 star hotel also considering the cost per night. The bed sheets in our room were not changed once in 6 nights. We were missing basic amenities hair dryers, bottle openers etc. And it took multiple calls to reception to obtain the items we should have already had in the room. On check out we were extremely suprised (as frequent travellers) that there was absolutely no facility for showering/changing once you had checked out. Their solution was to use the shower in puro beach (the one as you enter the pool) or to go to the toilets which are cramped and very hot. Location is quieter and is further out of the city which we preferred but if we had wanted to be central this hotel is not the one. The beach is close and the shopping mall being directly opposite was extremely handy as there are no other ""convinience shops"" and surprisingly €6 for 500ml of water at the hotel was not so appealing. Great experience of Barcelona however would think twice about returning to the Hilton diagonal mar, especially as you do not have to be a guest to go to Puro Beach. Also if this is your first visit to Barcelona be advised that beach wear is not allowed off the beach you have to be in tshirt and shorts/dress, kaftans aren't allowed. We awkwardly got asked to leave McDonalds for only having bikinis and kaftans on! ",2,2017,07,31
36,Great hotel and staff! ,"I stayed at this hotel in early July and again in late July - everything was fantastic!  Hotel staff went above and beyond throughout the stay - kudos to the Front Desk team, Executive Lounge staff, and the  bar team in the lobby - everyone was a delight!  Can't wait to come back!  ",5,2017,07,31
36,Very slow service at reception,fantastic facilities and convenient location for the beach and tube into town. The service on reception however was desperately slow and understaffed. There was no que for hhonurs members which is unusual,1,2017,07,31
36,Brief but wonderful stay in Barcelona,"Hilton Diagonal Mar is a great place to stay in Barcelona.  Only had a few days, so the staff went out of there way to make it great!  They booked an excursion and followed up with us each day.  They took a personal interest in making sure we had a relaxing time.",5,2017,07,31
36,Not good standard!,"For being a Hilton hotel you expect high and good service when the prices are that high! 
Forgot our order
Lazy in the bar
Service remote didn't work
Took the freedom of giving us the most expensive alcohol in the drinks without asking
Gave us the wrong bill
The staff were friendly but should maybe have a lesion in hotel service!
Not worth the visit!
",1,2017,07,30
36,Spectacular Hilton Hotel on the Beach,"I had no idea the hotel would be so close to the beaches and public transit until we checked in and became familiar with our surroundings.  This hotel is perfect!  The staff, guestrooms, location and comfort are all exactly what you want when traveling.  We will definitely return to this hotel next year.  Not necessary to shop around.  This is the place to stay!",5,2017,07,30
36,Mixed feelings,"Hotel is very close to the beach and beach side restaurants. It is a considerable walk to and from the centre of Barcelona but there is a tram line very close to hotel that takes you to the centre.  I would only recommend this hotel if you want to be far out of town and close to beach.   Puro beach is a very expensive pool club located within the hotel who charged me for 3 Moët & Chandon  when I'd ordered cava and been given cava each time. I would avoid this place at all costs and instead relax by the beach.  The executive lounge was nice and well appointed with lovely views.  Check in was very slow & tedious and we had to move rooms late at night after being out all day as we were allocated a twin room instead of a family room. This was resolved eventually but took a lot of 'chasing up' with reception to resolve. 
The bar area is very nice but would I recommend this hotel to friends heading to Barcelona ? Probably not as there are many better hotels closer to the centre.  We chose this hotel as it seemed to provide the best of both worlds being near the beach but was just too far out to go back to the centre to eat at nights.  ",3,2017,07,30
36,Great hotel with views of the Mediterranean Sea,"Lovely 5 night stay at this hotel situated a bit further away from the city centre.  Across the street to the Diagonal Mar Shopping Centre and a 5-min. walk to Llevant Beach.  Stayed in an executive level room with access to the lounge. Food & beverages were good quality in the lounge and service there was excellent!  Went to PuroBeach for a few hours to lounge on the pool deck but did not use the pool or spa.  Drinks were very expensive 12-15 Euros each and just OK, nothing spectacular.  The gym was being renovated and the temporary gym that was set up was very small & not conducive to a good workout.",5,2017,07,30
36,Hilton Pool staff ,"Hotel is good , clean and breakfast great . The Hotel staff are friendly .In my view though the pool is a party scene and a real ""pretentious w**k fest "" hotel guests are not given priority and are treated as a burden . You have to pay for your bed again in the day .I would not recommend staying at this hotel over a Fri Sat or Sun if you like to relax by the pool . The music is way to loud and staff are not that attentive . Also many are smuggling alcohol in as they don't actually want to pay the prices listed . It really is so chav and lacks class . Could be done much better,  a little quieter and less pretentious as well as giving hotel guests priority or advising them that pool is not really worth visiting at the weekend if they want some down time . ",3,2017,07,29
36,A very pleasant hotel,"We've stayed in the hotel during the end of july for 4 nights.
The entrance lounge was very nice with some jars of lemon water for the guests who come back from the long day at the city. There are about 25 floors and we were at the 9th and the view was astonishing!
There were a few things missing in our room when we got in: we didnt have shower blankets (took us a while to get them, only after we asked for the 2nd time) and no trash can (only a small one in the bathroom), the room was very cozy and there was an alarm clock too.
Breakfast was good, it had all the things most people eat - eggs, sausages, bacon, salad, yogurt, cornflakes, pastry', bread and more and the staff was VERY friednly and polite.
At the front of the hotel there is the Diagonal Mar shopping mall which has EVERYTHING literally - from water to clothes.
Generally we liked our stay in the hotel and we had a great experience there.",4,2017,07,29
36,Broken Promises,"I booked here because after calling other Hotels in Barcelona  I spoke with the Executive Chef and he promised me that he would, and I quote  "" Make plenty of Gluten free food for your daughter"". He told me to call again a week before to make sure they would cook enough food for her. So, I thought I had this covered. Not so fast..The first morning  I was met with store bought cookies and some bread, the second day i was given store bought cereal, the third day I was promised a salmon but the salmon  never happened, on the next day I gave up. I ended up at the MacDonalds across the street that has a Gluten Free menu. I paid for a high end Hotel only to have breakfast at MacDonalds.  The Junior Suite's view was amazing, the hotel room was immaculate, the front desk staff very friendly. The staff at the Club lounge is not very friendly and did not deliver on their promises.",3,2017,07,29
36,Nice hotel but shame about Purobeach pool area,"I am just back after a 5 day stay and I must say I was very happy with our room (310) which was roomy and clean with a very nice bathroom. The front desk staff were very welcoming and helpful as were the staff at breakfast lounge. Breakfast was very nice with a large array of fresh fruit and juices not to mention an extensive warm buffet style English breakfast. My gripe with the hotel is the Puro Beach pool area. Once you make your way to the pool area you are greeted by a sales pitch to the various packages available for your stay with varied from 20 euros for a lounger to 90 euros per person for the Puro package which I still do not have a clue what it entailed! Having decided to take up the 20 euro sun lounger for the family (60 euros lighter!) I was soon wishing I had gone to the beach which we did for the rest of our stay as we were constantly being asked if we wanted cocktail above the thumping music from the loudspeakers dotted around the whole pool area. I decided to go for a dip in the very small busy pool to be greeted by a layer of sun lotion scum in the water, clearly too small a pool to accommodate so many people and my other observation was that the toilets were located a floor down, I will leave the rest for your imagination! Needless to say I did not dip my head below the water for my one and only dip into the pool. Sadly this is were the hotel has let us down and I know a few other guests felt the same way. A real shame as the hotel itself and the location is  fantastic but the lack of a clean pool and a quiet area to bath and unwind is lacking which leads me to sadly not be able to recommend this  hotel unless you are after a beach resort club experience. Sorry",2,2017,07,29
36,"Good Hotel, Good Location.","This Hotel is not in the really busy Gothic and Las Ramblas Area, but is a short cab ride away.  It is in a bit quieter section of the city.  The beach is a five minute walk away, and there is a giant shopping mall and several restaurants across the street.  Several other restaurants are near, as us a beautiful city park.   Our room and the bed were comfortable.  

The pool area is nice but a bit pricey by the time you rent chairs, buy food or drink, etc. 

The hotel, overall, is a good value relative to others in the busier areas.  We will stay here again when we return in September.",4,2017,07,27
36,Hilton Diagonal Mar - nice surprise!,"My family and I stayed at the Hilton Diagonal Mar on a recent drive from Southern Spain back to Switzerland. Even though the hotel itself is not in the centre of Barcelona, it is only a 10 euro taxi ride to all the central attractions. Several Barcelona open-top tour buses pass the hotel (the pick up spot is a 5 minute walk away) and there is a taxi rank next to the main entrance.The hotel is luxurious and the rooms spacious. The hotel is located just opposite the Diagonal Mar shopping complex, which has a fabulous outdoor food court with a good selection of reasonably-priced restaurants. There is also a children's play area. I would highly recommend this hotel and will stay there again on our next visit to Barcelona.",4,2017,07,27
36,Not for a family with young kids,"We have stayed at Hilton before but this Hilton D M Barcelona does not reach the Hilton standard that we usually get. 

Pool area does not suit for the kids family as they around half naked (topless) drunk lady dancing with a very very loud music around the pool and inside the pool with champagne. I took this with the hotel but said it was ok here in Barcelona to go topless. But what? To go topless is find but get drunk and dancing topless when there were so some kids around? That's a disgusting behavior and it's a joke that hotel stuffs did allow it.

Positive about the hotel is that stuffs in executive floor are polite and friendly (not all of them but many of them) and they stuffs at pool area also polite and friendly. But the guest service (when you dial 9 from the room) are not that friendly. Don't know if it's how they talk like this in Spain or she sound just unhappy or impolite to me (the girl I talked to at 9 pm on 26/7)

Back to the room. Housekeeping were polite but the forgot to put towels for us. We went for swimming and got to shower direct when we came in and found out we had no towels at all in the shower. And another thing that bothering me was one of the housekeeping knocked on the door at 8:55 and asked if wanted him to clean the room. That was very very sweet but I still wanted to sleep 8:55 am in the morning on my holiday. 

There were a lot of things that I want to mention but well. There were just small things so I pass for this time.

Anyway like I said before. If you have kids. Don't stay in this hotel unless you want you kids have early adult experiences. 

",2,2017,07,27
36,Worst Hiilton ever!,"Well let me start by saying that this is the first time that I am writing a review when I haven't checked out of the hotel.   I'm a Hilton Honors member and one of the reasons I picked this hotel is because of the benefits that come with it....well let me just say that if this is the reason you are coming stay away.  This has to be the worst service that I have ever experienced in any of the Hilton Hotels.  Poor management....let me highlight some of the negatives below:
1.  No bellman to help you with your luggage (stayed for 4 nights and I think I saw just one randomly)
2.   Check in time is at 4pm, I came in at 3:30 and was told that my room wasn't ready...to come back in an hour.   Came back at 4:30 really annoyed to learn that it still wasn't ready, didn't get the room till 4:45pm...they must have called housekeeping 3 or 4 times to ask if it was still cleaned?  check in was poor...never got keys so had to make the line 2x....just awful.   I travel a lot this has to be the worst experience
3.  I had a family suite....the sofa bed that my son slept in was horrible, you can feel the bar ...complained spoke to a supervisor and stated all my complaints.....he said he was going to have management call me...I never received the call.  I asked him for a power adaptor and NEVER RECEIVED ONE
4.  Room was not adequately cleaned...rushed.
5.  no complimentary water
6.  Concierge service Leon is amazing...but only 1 person for a big hotel.....saw a number of ppl leave because the line was long including myself
7.  My daughter found the new toilet paper roll they had just changed dirty....Ugghh don't want to get into this.....
8.  On the 3rd night my husband tried to make coffee in the room to realize after boiling water that the lady had taking the coffee packets....
7.  staff doesn't seem to care when I addressed complaints...they almost seem use to it.  I'm very surprised that this hotel has so many positive reviews.   I would never recommend this hotel to anyone.   The hotel itself is nice..but rooms a bit rundown.....service is the worst that I have ever experienced!  Will NEVER stay here again.",2,2017,07,27
36,Noise Noise Noise,Nice hotel completely ruined by a pretentious and overly noisy (music) pool area.  So bad we left the hotel during the day for peace and quiet at the public beach as the music was clearly heard in room.  Great location and apart from noise the rooms were good as well.,1,2017,07,26
36,Avoid this hotel!,"The ONLY reason to stay at this hotel is its proximity to the conference center next door. The hallway outside our hallway smelled of a dead rat, housekeeping never came unless called and requested. The swimming pool is a joke for a family - it is more like a hip hangout, with people smoking shisha and behaving poorly. We were concerned an escort service was being run out of the pool area! Just avoid this hotel - there are so many other hotels which are much nicer!",1,2017,07,26
36,Poor Experience,"I have just checked out of the hotel and wanted to get my views about this hotel submitted before it becomes a distant memory.

Out of all the hiltons I have stayed at since I became a member I think this has been the worse experience. Things to note: 

1. Check-in and out was painfully slow - 20+ mins waiting each time.
2. No complementary bottles of water. I presume that isn't a hotel issue and more to do with membership levels. Disappointing since other hotels offer this for free to members.
3. Family members were staying In room 322 and were not informed that there was going to be maintenance works going on around them resulting in them leaving the hotel to be able to relax in the afternoons
4. Family members had no fridge in their room so they couldn't store the water they had purchase to keep hydrated. Again wasn't informed by hotel staff that the fridge wasn't going to be available 
5. My partner and I stayed in room 701. I presume it was located next to the service elevator/store room. I kept being disturbed/woken up in the middle of the night due to sounds of trolleys crashing and doors slamming. This room is not sound proof and was not relaxing or a peaceful experience. Again, hotel staff did not inform me of this. 
I am usually an advocate of Hilton hotels, however, I will not be recommending this hotel to anyone or reusing it in the future.

36,Perfect hotel,I stayed in the hotel during a business trip.  Good rooms with a required facilities and good connectivity to the airport (BCN).  It made the burden of business travel just a little lighter.  The location is also close to the business center making it an easy connection,4,2017,07,25
36,Great location - near the beach and shopping mall.,"I was there for a week-long business conference. The hotel is just 5 mins away from the beach. It was so close I could wake up to watch the sunrise and had a swim before breakfast. A large shopping mall is located opposite the hotel. If you want good authentic restaurants, you will have to take a short 10-15 mins taxi ride out. Taxis are easily accessible outside the hotel. Breakfast buffet range is good. Hotel is very clean. Good amenities although the gym is very small (smaller than a single bedroom!). Service is above average, and seem lacking especially at check-in/check-out. All in all, good stay and would return.",5,2017,07,24
36,Excellent!,"Excellent place to stay in Barcelona!!
   Beautiful hotel , close to the beach & nice mall !
   Purobeach on the property is amazing - pool with sun beds , food & drinks - reservations ahead recommended..
    Would definitely go back :)",5,2017,07,24
36,5* experience - thank you Hilton!,"We were spoilt with The Presidential Suite on the top 23rd floor, which was bigger square footage than the rented apartment for our main holiday! My 2 kids loved the extra space - the wonderful views, great whirlpool bath, dining room and a couple of lounges to relax in. We also made good use of the Exec Club on 15th floor which needs special key access in the elevator - tapas were served 6pm - 8pm. Room service was very responsive later in the evening.  Congrats to the GM here and their team on site - a 5* experience!!",5,2017,07,23
36,Top hotel,"My girlfiend and I stayed for 2 weeks in this hotel and it was amazing, we celebrares our honeymoon and the staff was so generous and polite.. breakfast zone its of very high quality .. the pool was clean and theres dj and music all day",5,2017,07,23
36,Great stay,It was always a great experience staff are effective and efficient well kept and maintained rooms we always wants to come back whenever we are in Barcelona it's perfect location close to anything you need,5,2017,07,22
36,Not worth the cost; accommodations similar to a budget hotel,"Our stay did not match what we expected for the Hilton brand at 300 euros a night.  Clogged shower drains that did not get fixed even after three days, mold and mildew in shower stalls, electrical outlets that cannot hold a plug, shower water gets hot and cold randomly, lights go off randomly, toilet leaks so flushes automatically through the night making noise,  toe nails clippings found on carpet (did not vacuum room in between guests or ever at all?)",2,2017,07,22
36,Luxury stay ,"What to say? This Hilton is a great place to spend your time in Barcelona. The location is perfect, well connected both to the beach and to the city centre. As my stay was a work stay, I enjoyed breakfast and lunch buffe ,with an incredible mix of choices for any taste and the well known Spanish flavours. The top roof is also amazing, so relaxing! And staff professional and kind in any occasion. Top rate!",5,2017,07,21
36,Not family friendly,"The location of the hotel is great next to the beach. 

The view from the higher floors is good. 

The furniture on the room was extremely old and broken. 

Pool is not kids friendly. It resembles an adult only club and charges €20 per person per day to seat close to the pool. 
",3,2017,07,21
36,Excellent Stay during my Vacation with Kids,"This is a review for my stay with 2 Children aged 5 and 7. We had an excellent stay. 

First, I am a Hilton member and was treated very well. Fantastic Value for points.

I had no issue getting a complimentary roll away bed for Children. Executive Room was spacious and had great ocean views; Firm beds. Executive lounge was fantastic, great out door terrace with plenty of Cava.

Breakfast in the main restaurant was good, some servers were exceptional, others could care less.

Pool was nice, although during Saturday and Sunday full of trendy people, but surprisingly there were two other families with kids.I was able to get 2 complimentary pool side sun chairs with no issue. Menu was expensive, so did not order anything. I overheard service was poor, odd since I saw dozens of servers.

There is a public kids park next to hotel; Also, the Diagonal Mall in front has a very popular play area. Plenty of restaurants for kids and adults, plus a supermarket. Restaurants range from fast food, to Spanish and international. I found them very well priced and excellent wine.

One block from beach; 2 blocks from subway, tram, bus, tourist bus. I prepaid private car to airport, E40 each way. Taxi is E35-E40 depending on bags, traffic, etc.

Hotel is mix of business guests since it is next to convention center and plenty of tourists, since it is close to beach. 

Location is not ideal for first time visit to BCN, but for my family, it was great due to pool, parks, beach, mall, short taxi ride to zoo. The hotel is modern, so no local charm, but very comfortable. If you like to jog, there is a path along beach close by, you can also ride bike and rent from bike share located across mall.

Bell staff was good; Lounge staff was very friendly. All staff is multilingual, great English. Internet was free, fast enough for my laptop, 2 cells and 2 ipads all connected at once, streaming netflix on US account.

I would highly recommend if you like modern amenities and international comfort. Also, if you want easy beach access and a nice pool, this is the place.",5,2017,07,20
36,Away from Congested City Center,"Brief description: Spacious, recently-remodeled rooms. Although the beds were extremely hard, I would stay here again because of its location away from the crowded city center. If I were traveling with children, I would choose Hilton Diagonal Mar over Barcelona Hilton because of its location near the beach, two playgrounds, the mall across the street with a food court for fussy eaters, and larger hotel room.

Detailed description of Room #1707: Spacious room with partial waterfront view, twin beds, black out curtains, in-room safe, fridge with small space for personal items, electric kettle with coffee-no tea, two bottles of water provided per stay, ice cubes near elevators, no slippers, no robes, no USB ports. Medium-sized marble bathroom with bathtub with detachable showerhead, shower stall, telephone, hairdryer with outlet in bathroom. Space for personal toiletries next to basin-bowl sink. PeterThomasRoth toiletries.

Executive Lounge on 15th floor, amazing views of beach and Barcelona, pleasant variety of food items, very friendly staff. Five minute walk to beach, €10 to €15 taxi fare to most attractions. Small salt-water pool with mind-numbing pumped-up music on weekends. Everyone, even Hilton guests, must pay for sunbeds. Couches and suspended lounge chairs can be enjoyed for free, however. Great cabana massage by Luciano.

Tips: Get a business card with the hotel's address. There are two Hiltons in Barcelona, both on Diagonal Avenue. This Hilton is closer to the beach. Buy advanced tickets online before attempting to visit any tourist attraction to avoid a long queue and/or disappointment. Buy a one-day ticket for the Hop On Hop Off bus to get an overview of Barcelona. Do one route, take a siesta in the middle of the day, and then do a second route in the evening. Take taxis to attractions on subsequent days. Taxi fares usually  €10 - €15 and accept credit cards Taking the Hop On Hop Off bus for transportation to see sights is extremely frustrating since busses only run in one direction and time is wasted waiting for the bus. Barcelona BusTurista busses seemed to run more frequently than Barcelona City Tour busses.",5,2017,07,19
36,Great Hotel for Business or Cruise Ship vacations,"Since we have been to Barcelona a few times in the past, we decided to have just a 1-day stay prior to our cruise departure. The Hilton Diagonal M.B. is a great hotel for such an occasion. Aside from the standard amenities, their staff were very friendly, helpful, and accommodating, and the breakfast food is a filler (seriously, if you came to Barcelona, GO out and eat!!). The pool area is very Miami Beach chic' and run by an outside company of Hilton, so watch out for hidden fees on food and beverage.

An added bonus was having the Diagonal Galleria Mall just across the street (for those forgotten items that were missed in your luggage, OR anxious teenagers that needed some ""freedom""). The city itself was just a 10-15 minute cab ride into town (pending traffic) OR the subway system is located on the other side of the Galleria Mall.  Again, a good location as a stop-over.",4,2017,07,17
36,much better value at other local hotels,"There is a rather significant charge for pool usage, which seems foreign to me, the price per night did not reduce when they transferred to the new model. Also the breakfast offering was one of the worst I have ever experienced.",3,2017,07,16
36,Inconvenient Location Variable Service,"Location: It is not convenient if you are interested in visiting the city center.  Though there are taxis available just outside the hotel, the cost of each trip to go to the city is between 13-20 euros and 30-40 euros to the airport.  It is close enough to a beach, but the beach is very crowded and kind of dumpy, its proximity to the beach should not be the reason to choose this. It is close to a mall, which has the advantage of a supermarket and some shops if thats your purpose. 

Staff:  Variable service.  The breakfast staff was wonderful.  The front desk staff were not all great. 

Lilliana was pleasant but not empathetic, cold, and condescending.  She did not seem to care that much regarding the issues at hand and made no extra effort to accomodate us as guests.  Not a people person, and not someone who should be at the front desk in my opinion. 

I came back after Lilliana left (maybe our issues were because it was the end of her shift and she didnt care).  I spoke with Ettore - what an absolute star.  He went way out of his way to accomodate us in a very full hotel trying to reorganize things to help get us into a better room - though we ultimately stayed in our original room his efforts were much appreciated. Other staff were also extremely kind and apologized for our situation. 

Overall:  I generally only book with Hilton for as I am a gold member.  Though official policy that gold members do not get access to the executive lounge unless they are on that floor, there has never been a time where I have not been extended access as a courtesy, even when the hotel is completely booked. This was probably the sole reason to book here given that with a small child it would be easier to have access to snacks, drinks, water and milk throughout the day.  We were denied access, which given the policy was not a travesty, but rather an inconvenience.  It is more an issue of principal.  I have stayed at hiltons all over the world, and our initial experience with Lilliana left a bad taste right at the beginning of our stay in barcelona which started us off on the wrong foot.  I think loyalty to the brand, should be rewarded with executive lounge access as a courtesy even though it doesnt meet official policy - its a very small gesture but goes a long way.  

Would I stay there again:  No.  Though a nice and mostly modern hotel, there are so many options in Barcelona that there is no reason to stay here with advanced planning",2,2017,07,15
36,Ok hotel with great pool and bar,"Ok hotel. We had the junior suite. The furnitures were worn out and unfortunately quite boring room in general. 
Pool area was great but quite expensive. Good drinks, music and personnel with top notch service. 
The exclusive launch-bar at the 15th floor was good with free drinks and snacks. 

All together would we come back again",4,2017,07,14
36,Hilton standard is superb!!,"Just returned from a fabulous stay at Hilton Diagonal Mar. Junior suite allowed access to executive lounge, where we got more than enough free food / drink every evening. Staff (especially Amelia) fab",5,2017,07,13
36,Crowded property,"The property is located in Diagonal Mar which is not very centrally located, but everything is a bus ride away considering how small Barcelona is. Very typical Hilton stay in terms of the lobby, room and facilities. Not feeling the beach club located in the hotel though. As a Hilton Diamond member, lounge chairs at the pool were ""free"", however the hotel could not reserve these chairs for us and we had to be present to reserve them ourselves. Considering how pack the club was on weekends, this is nearly impossible unless of course you go down in the morning. Saw a couple of drunk party-goers in the hotel lobby and lift area as well. Certainly not something you would expect in a Hilton. But overall a pleasant stay.",4,2017,07,12
36,Awesome stay before Med Cruise,"We stayed here the night before our Mediterranean cruise. It's a beautiful hotel, great views and near restaurants and a HUGE mall. We enjoyed the executive lounge level immensely for cocktails and snacks and breakfast. Easy to get a taxi from airport and also taxied to port. Rooms are huge, clean and at the high end of Hilton standard. Great lobby bar too with comfy seats to watch a soccer match on tvs.   ",5,2017,07,12
36,"Great accommodation, great food and service","One of the best accommodations I have experienced. Good staff, good food, excellent view on the city from the room window. Pleasant stay, and comfortable beds. The position in the city could be better for this brand of hotel but it might be the only flaw which is not really big since it is approx. 2 euros and 15 mins to city center.",5,2017,07,12
36,Handy and clean,"The hotel is on the main route into the city centre and minutes away from the subway. The area itself - if you took a small walk heading away from the main road you will find small cafe's, bars, and square and some quaint buildings. Its dusty but authentic and a lot cheaper than the city to eat. The hotel had sufficient staff on the desk to help you and they spoke different languages. The room was large enough and had the usual Hilton facilities - nice bathroom. BUT and this is the only BUT -  I could hear my neighbours every move and it carried on until the early hours.",4,2017,07,11
36,Not too sure really but on the whole OK,"My husband and myself with another couple booked the Hilton Diaganol Mar for 4 nights whilst visiting Barcelona. On arrival the first impressions are good but that was quickly dispelled after the long wait to check in. The process was incredibly slow and this was made worse by the receptionist constantly breaking off to answer the telephone. At the end of it we were told our room was not ready and we would have to come back for the key in 30 minutes, we did and were told it still wasn't ready and to return in another 30 minutes. We had booked the hotel as part of a Jet2 package holiday so you would have thought they would have allocated us rooms that matched our flights.

The reception area is really nice but the corridors are a bit tired with faded carpets. The rooms are big but a bit dated with scratched headboards and heavy gloomy curtains. They would certainly benefit from being brightened up a bit. Everything was provided that you would expect including an iron and board, safe and hairdryer. Lovely fluffy large towels and the bed was very large and comfortable. There are ice makers on each floor.

The dining room was fine and the staff were extremely friendly and attentive. There was a good selection at breakfast which was fine apart from the omelettes that are cooked outside on the terrace to order and these were awful.

Drinks in the hotel are very very expensive and the room service and mini bar prices are the same. I suppose this to be expected in this sort of hotel that in my opinion seems to be aimed towards business people.

The location is great, just a short walk to the beach and across the road from the Diaganol Mar shopping centre where there are some good shops, a fantastic supermarket and a wide range of bars and restaurants. It is well placed for the bus routes and taxi rank. A taxi into the centre costs approximately 12 Euro.

We didn't use the pool or spa but we visited one evening and it looked lovely.

I must say that every time we wanted ask a question at reception we had to wait for ages. They desperately need more staff in this area.

Barcelona is fantastic and there is so much to see and do we could quite happily have stayed for a week. If you want to walk into the centre it takes about an hour so make sure to wear some comfortable shoes. We walked a couple of times and you certainly see a lot of things you would miss on the bus or in a taxi.

So there you are, the hotel was fine for our short break but I really can't get enthusiastic about the Hilton Diaganol Mar.  Put it this way I have enjoyed staying at many other hotels for quite a lot less money.",3,2017,07,11
36,Its not the Hilton as I Know,"Good property, close to the beach but nobody cares for the guests in the building!
Its nearly imposibble to find a front desk clerk in the desk can give you proper answers and cares what your problem is!
The rooms are specios and light but the furniture looks very tired. 
I did not try food yet, so I have nothing to say about it.",3,2017,07,11
36,Management does not care....skimp on everything...,"Lied about our AC, never tired it on. MiniBar and fridge inadequate, treat people terribly and quality of food was bad.  No beach towels, must have reservation to use the pool, and felt management and their employees do not know or even have been exposed to treating people nicely nor do they care. No room for any items in refrigerator.  We have stayed at many Hilton properties as feel overall that the management of this property should not be in the Hospitality business.  Quality of everything lacked! No class!

",2,2017,07,09
36,Good choice for walking to beach,"My wife and I chose the Hilton Diagonal Mar for a couple of nights during a week long stay in Barcelona because we wanted to be near the beach.  The hotel is located at the end of Av. Diagonal and the end of the beach strip.  Hotel is not near any of the main attractions, but is within a 5 minute walk from a nice beach (nude optional) with great beach bars.  The beach near the hotel is part of Mar Bella which is the last of the main beaches in Barcelona - less crowds which we thought was nice.  If being close to the beach is the goal, then this is a great choice.  The Metro system is Barcelona is also very easy, so you could choose this is main hotel for the whole stay, but there are likely other parts of the city you may want to experience for a longer stay duration.",4,2017,07,09
36,Not appropriate for a family trip with young kids,"Very nice hotel, good food, good DJ at the pool... but the hotel is not appropriate for a family trip: loud music until very late.
The employees at the pool are not welcoming at all when you are with the kids...
The hotel tried to make it right and moves us to another room. Many thanks for this. It was very much appreciated.
So, if you join with your family or you are not ready to party until very late, ask a quiet room on the city side.
If you are on a business trip or with a group of party animals and if you like champagne, this hotel is perfect for you !",3,2017,07,09
36,Worth staying,"Not great, not bad. If you want to be near the beach and outside of the fuzz at the ramblas this is a nice place to stay. Good swim-pool environment to relax as a young couple. Small but honest gym. Rooms are (my at least) honest, clean and straightforward as one would expect from the Hilton.",3,2017,07,03
36,Convenient and comfortable!,"Just a short cab ride from the Gothic Quarter in Barcelona this above average Hilton property was a great find.  On a business trip and vacation accompanied by my wife we had multiple agendas: shopping, sight-seeing; a little bit of business, and relaxation.  All of our expectations were met and then some.  My biggest complaint is the architecture of the building - the windows - for being a seaside property - were tiny.  Also, the menu options at the restaurant by the pool were slim.  Overall, the staff both at the front desk and the bar, were very professional and courteous, accommodating, responsive.  They could use a concierge and a few more people at the front desk during peak times.  Being a Lifetime Hilton Diamond member, I can be pretty picky, but, I would definitely stay there again. I give it 4 stars.",4,2017,07,02
36,Great hotel and staff,Hotel is clean with beautiful views of ocean and Barcelona. Leon at the concierge desk was very helpful and provided excellent advice for sightseeing.  Hotel is across from a shopping plaza and walking distance to the beach. ,5,2017,07,02
36,A first class hotel with a lousy service and breakfast ,"I had a nice suite on the 8th floor, a living room, spacy bath and sleeping room. So far so good. After shower I grapped a coke from the mini bar and found no opener. Called guest service and was told to go down to the bar to let the bottle open. After answering that I am not properly dressed she said everybody is busy in the next hour. Next morning after a lousy breakfast I noticed at checkout that there were flyers telling that all taxis are on strike for 24 hours from 6 am. When I asked the reception how to make it to the airport in 1 hour they just referred me to the flyer that praised the public transport system.",3,2017,07,02
36,Excellent hotel in a good seaside location,"We stayed at the Hilton Diagonal Mar enroute to a cruise out of Barcelona. It is an attractive, comfortable hotel in a seaside location about 8km from the city centre. We had a family room, which comfortably slept 2 adults and 2 children. We were on the 8th floor overlooking the pool area, which was pumping. There were a few hen's nights (bachelorette parties) in town. Fortunately they closed the bar at about 10pm. 

Our room came with breakfast. The buffet was very large, well stocked and comprehensive and the service was outstanding. 

Opposite the hotel is the large Diagonal Mar Mall, where you can get anything you need. 

Overall excellent, if it were closer to the city centre or the cruise terminal I'd say outstanding. ",4,2017,07,02
36,Excellent Hotel,"Our family stayed here before we left on a cruise. The hotel is very clean, very updated, the staff was friendly and everyone spoke English. The pool and gym were both very nice. The location is in a great area as well. Will stay here again when in Barcelona. ",5,2017,07,01
36,Good Hilton!,"Our experiences were as following:

Positives:

+ super friendly staff at the reception (during check-in and check-out)
+ very nice appointed room with views to both the city/mountains and the sea
+ clean property
+very quiet room
+ great curtains for a good night's sleep
+ both bath (with jacuzzi function!) and shower
+ free wi-fi
+ nice pool/lounge area (Purebeach)
+ nice breakfast with the option to sit outside (if availability)
+ location is more then acceptable for us (access to the city center via the metro and a commercial centre with drink/eat/shop options in front of the hotel)

The only negative point for us:

- it can be quiet loud at the pool/bar area (especially the music)

However the location is not superb, there is metro line L4 that takes you to Barceloneta and to Urquinaona.

To be recommended!",4,2017,06,30
36,Excellent hotel to stay when in Barcelona. Close to a mall and restaurants,My wife and I stayed at this hotel from June 23 to June 27. We thought this hotel was excellent. A very clean hotel with supportive staff. This was our first time visiting Barcelona. A mall and several restaurants are across the street and the beach is 1 block away.,5,2017,06,30
36,Far away from the City Center.,"If you like to walk in Barcelona, thats not your hotel.  But if you like to run in the early mornings it is. Its very close to the sea, and a long harbour for running.
The hotel is good for work and the lobby for work meetings.",3,2017,06,29
36,Front Desk Problems at This Property,"We travel frequently and use the Hilton chain hotels when available.  This Hilton did not live up the Hilton standards.  Room wasn't ready, and then we had to move even though the room assigned to us had already been allotted for another guest.  We were told we would receive a ""welcome basket"" at the pool only to learn that it was unable because the lounge beds were ""free for everyone"".  If you can make sense of that, please do tell.  Food in the exec lounge was lacking in variety, quantity, and the lounge was understaffed.  The rooms were nice however, well equipped and clean.",2,2017,06,28
36,Brilliant weekend break,"Our 3rd visit proved to be yet another great stay.
We loved the new beach club, great service and a really good atmosphere.
Having requested a specific room on the 19th floor, it was ready for us when we arrived at 11.00am - big thanks. It was a nice touch to be well looked after as a diamond member.
Found all the staff to be helpful and freindly. In particular Claudia at breakfast, such a lovely girl who would brighten anyones day.
Several staff tried to help me revover my Iphone, that I had left in the taxi from the airport and when the very kind taxi driver returned it on the sunday, the front desk knew it was mine and much to my relief gave it staright back to me. (one very happy customer!!)
Other things of note - 5 mins walk to the breach (you must go and see the dog area on the beach  - very enterataining when one escapes!). 10 euro taxi in to town. Plenty of good value restaurants across the road and as mentioned by many others - great exec lounge.
Thanks to everyone there - a great stay, will be returning for the 4th time next year.",5,2017,06,27
36,Decent ,"Decent Hotel, great service and great location. The executive lounge was a great place to have snacks and relax. The only problem was there was no complementary water. We had to drink tap water which tasted like chlorine. ",3,2017,06,26
36,Great hotel and Great Location,We really enjoyed our family vacation in Barcelona. The hotel was very clean and the staff was amazingly helpful. The breakfast was great and the location was excellent. We highly recommend this hotel.,5,2017,06,23
36,Beautiful,"Great location , beautiful decor , organized staff friendly , fully bilingual , great restaurants  the early morning buffet fully attended with friendly staff , wide selection of breads, juices , fruits  , eggs and meats , will definitely return.",5,2017,06,22
36,Very nice place to stay while in Barcelona ,"We originally booked one night, and ended up staying for five nights. Excellent and friendly staff, it has a nice pool area that in the summer run pool parties with nice Deejays and live electronic/lounge music. Located right in front of the Diagonal Mar shopping which is great for a quick but tasty bite,  hageen daz ice cream, or general shopping including a supermarket. The hotel is located about 5 mins from the Port Olimpic, which has various restaurants, etc",4,2017,06,18
36,DISAPPOINTING STAY,We are regular hilton guests.  We found that this hotel failed to give sufficient information on check in.  One of the key features that tempted us was photos of lovely pool area.  Not told you must reserve 20€ on the first day as there was a party day.  If you do not pay you are tucked away separated from the pool area.  Second day we thought no party today?  On arrival told no beds free you must reserve - we had not been told this.  All lovely beds lay empty and we had to lie once again in second class area!  Never before have we been expected to pay for sunbeds when residents.  Left a bad taste,3,2017,06,18
36,Amazing Quality and Customer Service,"Liliana was one of the best check-in front desk staff that my wife and I have ever dealt with. She was personable, helpful, and caring. After 19 hours of traveling-Liliana did everything she could to upgrade us and get us into​ our rooms before the required check-in time. As we waited we had drinks and snacks at Pastaccio. Andrea waited on us and gave outstanding service. 

The room was amazing-very spacious. We received a King Deluxe Room. The bed was amazing and the bathroom was luxurious. The view of the hills in the background was a welcomed site.

The Executive Lounge was amazing. Claudio was our server and he gave exemplary service by greeting us and suggesting several places to visit and eat while in Barcelona. He also gave advice on how to take the subway to these areas.He genuinely cared about us and he also shared about where he was from and a little bit about his life. Lastly, he took us to the Balcony of the Executive Lounge and pointed out the major areas to visit. He went above and beyond the call of duty.  

The service at this hotel is the main reason I will come back every time that I am in Barcelona. Thank you for making our anniversary trip an amazing one.

36,Great experience ,"Beautiful hotel. Just what I would expect of a Hilton brand hotel. The rooms are fresh, spacious and airy with powerful air conditioning, really comfy beds and fresh clean linen and fluffy white towels. Water in the room. Staff professional smart and really helpful. Great experience ",5,2017,06,14
36,Best girls weekend away ever,"The hotel was lovely, comfortable beds and really friendly and helpful staff. Purobeach was fantastic - people complain about paying for sunbeds but you are paying for the experience. Great atmosphere and cool music with staff serving food and drinks at your bed all day. Loved it. Make sure you book the beds in advance as it gets full up especially at the weekend. ",5,2017,06,13
36,Nice hotel with a nice view; don't forgot your electric adapter kit!,"We stopped here on our way to cruise and were not disappointed.  Our only disappointment was that we could not get a room for the day we were leaving and had to stay at another Hilton. No pictures of the actual room as it was a late night and then forgot to take some the next day.

Our room was ready when we arrived at 7 p.m. and was clean and comfortable.  We then realized we had forgotten our adapters since we were going by cruise and knew they had US plugs.  I went to the front desk to retrieve a couple adapters, but they only had one.

We plugged in our phones one at a time and no issue.  We brought a sound machine with us for the cruise and thought nothing of plugging that in when it was time for bed - OOPS, that's wasn't a good idea.  After a pop and puff of smoke the sound machine was no more.  Well darn, we didn't think it needed a transformer too, but it did.

Long story short, the hotel paid is for the sounds machine having not advised us that only small things like phones and such could be used without transformers and thus they made things right.

The breakfast area on the upper floor was amazing and the views only enticed us to get out and experience Barcelona.

Clean, the price was good, and when a mistake was made where we held some of the blame, they made it right; all in all that's service.

We would definitely go back.",5,2017,06,12
36,great hotel in a quieter part of town,"Stayed for 3 nights as i attended a conference next door. Staff are very friendly and helpful from check in to check out. Breakfasts were good and being able to eat til midday on the weekend is great! I had a room on the 18th floor with a marvelous mountain and city view. I prefer this to the opposite sea view and there is nothing to see there apart from water and some nondescript high rises. With the city view you get lights and mountains but you need to be reasonably high up. The hotel rooms are large,  well appointed,quiet ( but stay away from poolside where it becomes a noisy disco at night). The local beach is a short walk away but is not that good - better beaches are a short ride away. Large mall opposite hotels includes plenty of bars and restaurants. The hotel is in a much quieter neighborhood and the metro if just a few minutes walk where the excellent metro takes you everywhere you might want to go ( including very touristy Rambla). Only downside is Hiltons stupid policy of charging for internet and bottled water.
Overall highly recommended. The staff really make you welcome

",5,2017,06,11
36,Great location,"Best location, beautiful hotel, the bar was great and the bell hop/bag service was extremely helpful! However I've stayed at so many Hilton's all over, i don't know why this one the staff fell a little short for me. I am used to the above and beyond staff but this one just seemed a little less ""Hilton-like"" if that makes sense? No stand out problems really, the breakfast in the exec lounge wasn't all that amazing, and the lady who checked us in to breakfast seemed like she didn't want to be there. But the view from the exec lounge balcony almost made up for it all. Honestly would recommend just going to the mall right across the street, ate there every night such amazing food for a way better price. The bar staff was good, very quick. Still a pleasant stay.",4,2017,06,11
36,family trip,"Hotel is Great the Rooms are very clean, beds and pillows where very comfortable and clean room was very nice the view we had was nice! we had a suite facing the mediterranean sea we absolutely loved it we would definitely stay here again!  ",5,2017,06,10
36,Excellent hotel and location,"An excellent hotel and location for the Primavera Sound Festival at end of Diagonal Mar. 
Would definitely use again. 
Rooms were comfortable and fresh, along with great breakfast. Slightly expensive, but worth the payment",5,2017,06,10
36,Hilton standard,"Overall good stay for 3 nights in barcelona.

The room is spacious with good connection of Wifi (but you have to register and hilton honors before the front desk give you the password.) 

Breakfast was great with huge variety of foods and fruits.

Even churros was serve in the morning spread.

Located next to the mall and close to beach.

Will get a good chance to see a sunrise if you have a sea facing room with good weather.

Water pressure was good but the water temperature is not consistent with sometime hot and sometime cool during your bath just like you're dancing around within the shower room (small).

Overall a good stay",4,2017,06,08
36,Room service at Hilton,"I had a wonderful experience at this hotel. The scenery is amazing and very urban. The location of the hotel is in a city area that is around many places such as Starbucks and McDonalds. I feel that this is very good for Americans to see especially if it is their first time overseas like it was for me. The hotel itself is extremally clean and the receptionist were very polite and knowledgeable. They could explain the electricity difference to me as well as local food places for me to eat. Unfortunately, due to me being exhausted from my flight I did not want to go out to get food, I stayed in and ordered room service with Hilton. I was very pleased to see that there was a menu that was in English. I was a little shocked at the prices of the food items at first. Since they were kind of high. Also, they did not have a wide variety of items. They had two salads, tapas, three sandwiches and sides. I decided to choose the Caesar salad and with a side of fried and a bottle of water that came to a total of 31 euros. Which is very expensive in my eyes for just a regular salad. It took about 45 minutes for my salad which also upset me. When the food did arrive the guy that brought the food in was very nice, but they should have more employees that speak English. He brought the food in and set it up on the table. When I started to eat the salad, I had noticed that the dressing was not Caesar but mayonnaise. I was not happy with that at all because it was chunky and not the correct dressing. But the fries were extremely good and the water was crisp and very quenching. Other than the salad everything else was very good. I was upset at the fact that I paid so much money for a salad that was not correct. I did not read any reviews on the hotels room service but I did research the hotel before booking a room. The reason why I picked this hotel was because it was the cheapest and very beautiful and close to the airport",3,2017,06,07
36,Visit to Barcelona/Camp Nou,"This hotel appears to be fairly new. The room was a good size, especially when compared with normal European hotels. Housekeeping services were very good. If you stay on the Executive Level, there's a hospitality lounge that does a good free breakfast and Happy Hour. The hotel is about a 5-10 minute walk from the nearest metro. There is a huge shopping mall over the road where it is easy to get a quick meal. It includes a Starbucks. Good value for money. About 40 minutes from the Camp Nou by metro. Try to see a game at the Camp Nou if possible.",4,2017,06,07
36,Best in Barcelona,Very fine quality and friendliness of staff.  Accommodations excellent.  Visit was split between 6 nights followed by a week of travel and then a single night return.  Staff remembered us by name and immediately took care of our needs.,5,2017,06,06
36,Hilton Diagonal Mar provides an excellent experience.,"The property is in a prime location, and provided us excellent amenities and service. The room was clean, well appointed and maintained, the restaurant service and fare for breakfast were excellent. The staff everywhere were friendly, courteous, prompt and helpful. Our one day overnight stay was a wonderful experience.",5,2017,06,05
36,So much potential...,"The wife and I just finished 5 nts at the other Hilton in town, and we booked our final nt in Barcelona here.  As soon as we got out of the taxi, we were impressed and we liked the change of pace since this property is right by the beach.

My mood quickly changed during check in.   Why in the world are there agents that work in this industry that are simply not nice!??  I simply do not get it.  You are making the first impression on behalf of the property...but yet fail to make me feel welcome.  

Then another quirky thing occurred when I had been upgraded to a suite.  The night prior I had selected my room online...on a high floor and with a sea view.  I was thankful for the upgrade of course, but it was simply executed poorly.  The key worked for the main bedroom, but the other room remained locked.  I was just confused at this point.  If it was a suite, there'd be more than one room I thought.  So I called downstairs and was connected to someone at the exec lounge.  They politely re-keyed my key after I personally went to the lounge.  I tried the other room again...and it still didnt't work.  At this point I said whatever...too much wasted time and effort.  Eventually, someone physically came to the room and solved the issue.  Just an unfortunate fluky incident...appreciated the upgrade, but basically I gained an extra room which I didn't use at all (large conference room with a tv and outdated furniture).  

Breakfast and room service were good.  The pool area looked beautiful, although I believe there is a fee for using the pool lounge area.  The area around the hotel looked really nice as well...very modern and plenty of dining options.

This hotel has so much potential...perhaps my experience is not the norm.  If the hospitality here could match the physical property itself, I would recommend staying here.",3,2017,06,03
36,Could be a great hotel if staff had a clue!,"The hotel is close to the beaches, convention center and metro (subway).   Unfortunately, the staff does not know what it means to DELIGHT guests!   I think this is a management issue.   They close the pool area at 5 PM for a private function. Unfortunately, we were turned away at 4:15 PM, 45 minutes earlier than what we had been advised. ",1,2017,06,01
36,Sheer bliss !,"We stayed here for 1 night post cruise and it was the most wonderful way to end our holiday . We had originally booked another hotel which we stayed in the night before our cruise but we're so disappointed with that hotel that we cancelled it and booked into the Hilton . Boy are we glad we did ! It may seem a tad expensive but the absolute luxury more than justified the price . The rooms are spacious , very clean and extremely well equipped,we had a wonderful sea & pool view , amazing! The staff are very friendly and helpful. The pool area is something else ! Wow !!  I would definitely stay there again and highly recommend this hotel .",5,2017,06,01
36,They took great care of us,"As a gold member with Hilton Honors we were upgraded to a wonderful, huge suite. We also had use of the Executive Lounge for afternoon cocktails, appetizers and breakfast. While it was very crowded and busy in the Executive Lounge, they kept the flow going well. A new morning coffee system is required as the lines are very long to get coffee in the Executive Lounge. They have two espresso machine that take a while and therefore causes a back up of coffee. Very clean, however a large convention style hotel. 
The location is not downtown Barcelona, however across the street from the beach.",5,2017,05,31
36,Hotel Stay,"Great Location - poor cleanliness and food availability. The bathroom floor of the hotel suite was not cleaned for 5 days.  I was on the executive level and every morning for breakfast the tables were not cleared to you had to eat at tables with the plates, glasses and silverware stacked in the corner of the table.  Food for the continental breakfast continually ran out requiring patrons to wait and the coffee machine was down 2 of the 5 days I stayed at this hotel.  Touted as 4+ stars, it should be rated as a 2 star hotel.",2,2017,05,31
36,barcelona hilton,"the hilton diagonal del mar, is well worth moving to gold or diamond status for, if enrolled in hhonors, free access to the executive lounge with outside seating and panoramic views, near beach, but a bit of a trip to get into the city center (10-15 euros in taxi) pool area is good, but there is a fee, and plays constant loud club type music",5,2017,05,31
36,Great Hilton Experience,This is a great hotel with wonderful Hilton Honors benefits.  Staff in the Executive Lounge and the amenities are superb.  The location is a bit of a distance to city activities.  You can use the Metro which is very convenient or take a taxi.  Taxi is about 10 euros each way.  It can get expensive if you are going back and forth.  We had a great view of the sea.,5,2017,05,31
36,Usual chain hotel.,"The rooms are fine.  Clean and simple.  There is the usual emphasis on trying to wring as much money out of you as possible during your stay.  You even have to pay to sit by the pool.  The location isn't great.  You can walk to the beach.  But, for exploring the city it's a tube ride away.  ",3,2017,05,30
36,Hotel,Excellent business hotel with easy access to taxi and subway.  This hotel is located across from a food court and mall. Executive lounge has a very large open air patio on the 15th floor with great views. Executive lounge staff are excellent.,4,2017,05,29
36,Second stay and still good,"Good Hotel with access to near by underground to go Camp Neue , the hotel clean and very efficient , nothing luxurious but efficient, Food & Beverage is average but breakfast was good.

Next to the Mall for additional dining variety and walking distance to the beach.",4,2017,05,28
36,Lovely hotel n perfect for families travelling with kids!,"Great hotel , perfect location n so convenient! This hotel had great service and it's right opp. the Diagonal mar mall that had lovely play area for kids.
The staff was helpful and the view of the sea was just amazing ! Would stay there again for sure!",5,2017,05,25
36,Great modern facilities,"This hotel is a great place to stay. I felt that all staff from reception through to Resturant actually cared about the job they weee doing. This is the same with all Hilton I have experienced.

This hotel has character but is totally modern",5,2017,05,24
36,Super long weekend,"Started off not so good as taxi driver took us to the wrong Hilton , common mistake apparently . Once at the right place we found a massive queue due to a conference coming in , however the staff there suggested we store our bags there and go up to the second floor or into town for some lunch and return later . We went over into the shopping centre and found a very nice healthy food place for lunch .
Once back and the queue had gone we checked in and got a very welcome upgrade too. Service was excellent rooms were great nice views and a good place to do touristy stuff as the open top bus tour stop is yards away . Really pleasant hotel with great staff would happily go back again ;-)",5,2017,05,23
36,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona,"This hotel is placed away from city centre, but it is close to metro, so, in 20 minutes you can be in a middle of all attractions. One big plus of its location is, that the hotel is  next door to Diagonal Mar shopping mall, so if you are in town for shopping, it is a best place for you.
The beach is also near by, and a sea view form your room could be excellent.
  The room is clean and has a lot of space, even a standard room has a work place. Also, they have a free wi-fi in a lobby, which is nice.
A breakfast is a standard Hilton breakfast, which is good, and a restaurant dinner menu has a good choices and prices are reasonable.
Overall, it was a good stay.",4,2017,05,22
36,"Modern room design, great conference space, breakfast was OK.","The hotel property is beautiful. Well laid out, across the street from shopping, and a five minute walk to the beach. The interior was immaculate and the staff was very helpful. My room had a huge desk area, lots of closet space but follows the design of many hotels today of having shelves in the closet but no dresser or any furniture with drawers. For a one-week stay, it was a minor inconvenience. Dinner and lunch were excellent, breakfast had a wide variety but was a bit repetitive. If you're considering this hotel for a conference, their break/snack setup and service was outstanding and the staff was extremely professional. They even took the initiative and asked people in a different conference area to stop congregating around our windows. I highly recommend this facility for business purposes, and would gladly return for personal stays as well.",5,2017,05,21
36,Front desk - nightmare - other bits poor too,"Bad stuff first- and why it only got 2 stars. 

Well maybe a little exaggerated but considering I paid €250 bed only I would have expected the front desk to have properly registered my key! Although I was grateful to receive the 'guest of the day' award it would have been nice getting into my room. As it was it took two visits to reception to validate the key - tut tut. 

The other bad points; the bar is right in the reception area so there is little privacy. The bar only served two beers on tap and not the best quality. I did see a nice selection of spirits and some wines but the beer choice was dreadful. I ordered a Mahou (I think) on tap and it was cold which was lucky as it was not particularly tasty. Whilst there I wanted to see the restaurant menu as I had immediately discounted bar food as there was no privacy; the choice was poor. The shower the next morning was a disaster; I took mine at 8am and there was barely any water pressure or warmth. The last bad part was the location; apart from a shopping centre and a forlorn beach walk it was very poorly located. This is entirely my fault as I thought I was within an easy walk to the centre of town - how very wrong. 

The reason for the two stars? My upgrade and wifi. The room was lovely and the bed was comfy. The wifi was strong enough for work. 

I doubt I'll go back. Sorry guys poor effort!",2,2017,05,21
36,Satisfactory stay,"Nice location, though pretty far from city center, average rooms ( though highlighted as recently refurnished) .  Breakfast could have been more varied.  Good hotel  service and a satisfactory stay overall.",4,2017,05,21
36,Excellent!!!!,"Everything was excellent, but the best was the Service... Claudia and Albert in breakfast, Carolina at the restaurant for dinner, Helena at the front desk, and Amparo in room service!!! Thank you all for making this an excellent stay!!!
Definitely recommend and will return.",5,2017,05,19
36,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona,"A visit to Barcelona would be enhanced by a stay at the Hilton Diagonal Mar, with its lovely location by the beach, access to a shopping mall, close proximity to a metro stop that easily takes you to the city center or other parts of Barcelona, and the hotel's excellent facilities, superb staff, and first-rate service. Highly recommended.",5,2017,05,17
36,"Decent enough, close to the beach","I stayed here for 3 nights during the Spanish F1 Grand Prix - this hotel hosted many visitors and guests of the GP so was quite busy but they appeared to take this in their stride.

The hotel is located away from the heart of the city, but has a large shopping mall right across the street with many shops and restaurants.  It is also an easy 5 minute walk to the beach and promenade along the sea front.

Check-in was friendly and efficient, as in fact were all staff interactions.  My twin room on the 18th floor had a stunning sea view and was well-appointed, albeit a little tired in the decor.

Breakfast was adequate and served the purpose of fuelling up for a long day at the race track.

Access to transport options were good - there is a tram stop and a metro station within 10 minutes' walk which will get you pretty much anywhere in the city (or even in Spain!).  You can use this transport to get to the airport but a taxi is quickest.

Overall it was a perfectly pleasant place to eat and sleep, which is all you need really.",4,2017,05,17
36,Good stay,"It is a really classy big hotel. It is located near the beach, near a Barcelona city tour station (a sightseeing bus tour that you should definitely try), and absolutely spacious and beautiful.

The staff is in general really good and welcoming. Whoever, I have to say I was pretty chocked by the behaviour of one woman at the reception desk: she barely said good morning, did not goodbye, and was very rude. She was talking under her breath, and did not want to help me because I had a problem with my flight ticket. She was so disrespectful. It was a woman with short red wavy hair. An advice: if you don't like tourists, just change your job! 
But I think she was just an exception, because all the other staff was so lovely!

There are 23 floors. Rooms are big.

One dislike: you must pay to enter to the swimming pool. It is not free, even for clients.

The breakfast is good: it's a wide buffet. However, it's the same everyday, nothing changes. ",4,2017,05,17
36,Fabulous hotel experience,"The letter in our Hotel room stated that Hilton Hotel aimed to exceed our expectations - we would not disagree. Everything that we asked was accommodated for - booking and transfer errors (not the Hotel's fault) were sorted out by management and staff on our behalf.  Staff were friendly, courteous and well informed. Our room (10th floor west) had great views and was clean and comfortable - unfortunately the cleaner's storage room was next to ours so it was noisy occasionally. Food- breakfast (buffet) and dinner (a la carte) were plentiful and very tasty. This is a luxury hotel and the tarrif & other costs reflect this.",4,2017,05,17
36,Top Notch Hilton Experience,"From the moment we arrived and up to when we had to leave we experienced the Hilton Brand at its best. If staying in Barcelona, select this hotel - you won't be disappointed. Great rooms as well as common spaces. Superior staff!",5,2017,05,16
36,Best sleep ever!,We were on a pilgrimage and arrived in Barcelona the Hilton diagonal Mar service was excellent carpeting beds dacor all new bed was so comfortable sheets towels everything was clean they could have been more helpful I highly recommend the Hilton diagonal Mar,5,2017,05,16
36,Barcelona Diagonal Mar,This is an excellent hotel if you are looking for a hotel close to the beach and you want an extremely helpful hotel staff.  the hotel offers excellent views of the sea and the staff is very courteous and helpful.,5,2017,05,15
36,Excellent stay near the beach,"Walking nearby along the beach, going to the city center for sightseeing or hiking in the proximity mountains - all easy and exciting to do individually or in couples on any short or medium term-stays in Barcelona.",5,2017,05,15
36,Lovely Location,"This was a wonderful location offering a well-stocked executive lounge that was open a couple times per day. Both the Tapas and the view were wonderful.

 The rooms were spacious, clean, well-stocked and the staff went out of their way to accommodate my computer system (which tripped a breaker!).  A very modern hotel with polite and hospitable staff, We would Definitely stay at this location again!

 If you like to shop, there's a decent sized mall directly across the street.",4,2017,05,14
36,"Top hotel, friendly staff nice facilities","I had a room looking towards the street (other side = water). The room was clean, maintained, quiet, large and with a little sitting area besides the desk. Good bed.

Breakfast in buffet style was excellent. Friendly staff gave you a warm welcome.

Minor item: prices of the mini bar: well, lets put it like this: stereo typical (I didn't know there were places left with these prices). Especially with the very large mall right across the street, were you can get anything you like until late.

That mall is an excellent place to eat: it has about 40 places in it to grab something to eat, ranging from Japanese (2: Sushi + Udon) to American Steak House.",5,2017,05,13
36,You HAVE to visit!,"I was travelling with my 10 years old son. Starting with making reservation trough the check in, breakfast, exe lounge I have to say (I'm travelling frequently), I never saw such a helpful, professional, kind staff - with always smile!!! - on the world! THANK YOU HILTON DIAGONAL MAR BARCELONA! A special Thanks for the fruits, water and aspecially for the Birthday cake for my son! THANK YOU!",5,2017,05,11
36,Modern hotel,"My wife and daughter first time in Barcelona, they found a familiar face, one of Botero's sculptures. They were very exited, then we arrived to this gorgeous Hotel. From the doorman, front desk and bell staff were happy, polite, always with a great smile. We got large room on the top floors with a breathtaking view of one of the most iconic city in Europe; the bathroom was large with a separate shower from the tub. The pool is beautiful and inviting, but to be quite honest we did not used it, the restaurant is widely open (loft style) have a outdoor section which is convenient to enjoy tapas and sangria while re-energizing before going out for the night (keep in mind that diner time is late at 10 PM). The location cannot be better is close to everywhere, there is shopping mall across the street with food venues as well, passing the mall there is a tram station, two blocks away a subway station and coming from the airport is 25 minutes away (€50.00). Walking is the better way to know this magnificent city so please bring confortable shoes, even though the only place ones may not walk is Park Guell because you may need your breath to walk the stairs to heaven. Do not forget to visit la Boqueria, barrio Gótico, Gaudí houses and building, Sagrada Familia and please do not purchase a leg of Hamon de Pata Negra because it is not allowed to enter the states. ",5,2017,05,11
36,Really enjoyable stay,"We had an excellent stay at the Hilton Diagonal del Mar. We had an executive room and enjoyed the access to the executive lounge with lovely views over the bay and the city. . A good range of snacks and drinks available. Easy to get around -,taxis right outside and metro along the road. Easy to walk along the promenade right by the sea.  Fab staff who could not have been more helpful.",5,2017,05,10
36,"Busy, beautiful hotel","The breakfast has everything you can think of.  I love the variety of special coffees that you can make. The desserts are exactly the right portion and very delicious.  Our company has over 70 people here and we have food at every break. The staff is quick, picking up as soon as you are done and delivering fancy, yummy snacks. I am very impressed. ",5,2017,05,09
36,A very pleasant experience,"I had a very pleasant staying experience within Hilton Diagonal Mar hotel in Barcelona . Staff extremely helpful and ready to serve you  , clear and well furnished rooms . Very good services . I have been in many Hilton company hotels - being a Silver HH - and I have to say it was one of most nice staying I experienced . Thank you for these nice moments .",5,2017,05,09

36,Post-cruise hotel,"Hilton Honors gold member, received complimentary upgrade to executive level, which included evening cocktails and heavy appetizers & full breakfast. This was my second stay, booked again in 6 months!",5,2017,05,07
36,Great value,"Great value, recomended. Big rooms, very good breakfast.easy communication to city center. Very pleasant and helpfully staff. Close to taxi stand and metro. Good bar and restaurant. Nice pool, but no heat'ed water.",5,2017,05,06
36,Horrid,"Staying here for 3 nights. Spent several hours by the pool upon arriving on Thursday, prices ridiculously expensive (€10 per beer) but despite this my group spent over €500. This afternoon I went to spend couple of hours by the pool and was informed I must make a reservation and payment to access the pool. I spoke to the manager and she told me this was company policy to charge guests as the hotel allows members of the public to use the facilities. She seemed alarmed that I told her we didn't pay on the Thursday and offered little in the way of an apology. 
Don't waste your time staying here, plenty much better hotels  a lot closer to the action too.",1,2017,05,06
36,Hilton - Barcelona Diagonal Mar,A very fine hotel in a great location in new Barcelona for business and close enough to old Barcelona for seeing the sites.  The hotel is adjacent to a stop for the Barcelona City Bus Tour that took me about 5 hours to complete booth the east & west loops of the tour and well worth the price.,5,2017,05,05
36,Awesome Hilton Service,"We had been to the Hilton Diagonal Mar in Barcelona two years ago.  Like it so much, we returned this year.  Glad we did.  It was our anniversary and they acknowledged this and treated us like royalty.  We are Diamond members and utilized the awesome Executive Lounge.  It has a nice view of the city and The Mediterranean.  We were in the bar during a soccer game and had a blast with other patrons.  The hotel is a bit far from airport and museums but worth it since the place and service is great.  Make sure to acquaint yourself with public transportation and buy multi-day passes.  I hope you enjoy yourself if you stay there.",5,2017,05,04
36,Terrific Stay,"First time to Barcelona and all hotels were fully booked but I managed to get a room at Hilton Diagonal Mar. It was away from the crowded streets of central Barcelona but had such beautiful views of the ocean with a lovely promenade just a walk away. Lovely hotel, great breakfast and friendly staff. A hotel I wouldn't mind going back to.",5,2017,05,04
36,Fabulous hotel,Had a lovely room on the 17th floor with great views. Coffee and toiletries provided. All staff very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was terrific with a wide selection of products. Only slight criticism was the omelette chef was very slow and the pans were caked in egg. There is a shopping mall opposite the hotel with a variety of restaurants and lots of taxis waiting outside. Good location for the port. Unfortunately we were only here for one night but would have loved to stay longer.,5,2017,05,01
36,Very nice view of the ocean,Clean room. Good wifi. Bed was a bit too firm. I highly recommend a room on a high floor and toward the north end of the building to get fuller view of the ocean. Breakfast is not cheap unfortunately.,4,2017,04,30
36,Lovely stay ,"Currently on the second night stay at Hilton Mar Barcelona.

We were fortunate enough to receive a great upgrade to an Executive Club suite on Floor 20 with great views.

Club lounge also good and the staff are very friendly and provide good suggestions on restaurants and sightseeing.

Unfortunately I was a victim of phone theft from a bar off the Ramblas last night ( according to the police this is a hugely common occurrence , this of course has affected our enjoyment somewhat.

However, I would like to recognise Francesco on the Front Desk who was very helpful in supporting and organising with my Mobile network provider to put a stop on my number.

This support really helped in what was a stressful situation.

36,Treated Like Gold,"After completing a 9 Day cruise on the Norwegian Epic to the canary islands, we decided to rest one night and selected this hotel based on price and Hilton brand.   We arrived at 10:00 AM and our room was ready for check in. The lobby was chic and modern.  We received an upgrade to the executive lounge as a Gold Member and also a flower since the hotel was celebrating Sant Jordi (similar to Valentine's Day).  The front desk assistant answered all questions and told us we would save a Euro by booking the hop on hop off with them. The room was spacious and modern.  I forgot to bring a Euro converter for my US Plus and had to request it. It was delivered within 45 minutes.  The Executive Lounge had a great view of the Barcelona skyline.  The lounge served appetizers (breads, cold cuts, chicken skewers and croquetas) and had plenty of beverages.  Since I like to drink, the lounge served wine, beer and more importantly hard liquor.  They had rum, vodka, gin and one more bottle.  To my surprise, when the bottle was finished, they brought out another one even though the service was ending in 10 minutes!  Hurray for me!   I did not realize the lounge would completely close at some point (I think around 9Pm) because I would have grabbed water and dessert for the evening.   The breakfast was also hearty.  The Hop on Hop Off stop was right down the block and the beach was near by.  A mall is also across the street and in the corner is a great small Italian Restaurant which served an amazing Diavlo pizza. The hotel dining options and drinks were pricey.   My only caution would be to time your taxi ride to the airport.  We left around 8:15 Am which put us in traffic and added to the cost of the taxi ride (around 40 Euros).",5,2017,04,28
36,Perfect Hotel....If You Can Afford It,"I stayed 5 nights at this hotel.  It was perfect in all regards.  I had a view of the ocean from the 12th floor.  The staff was friendly and professional.  The room was nicely appointed with a comfortable bed with great pillows.  The bathroom was very nice and the shower had excellent water pressure.  The room was spotlessly clean.  The whole hotel smells good!

Honestly, I could only afford to stay here, however, because I got the corporate rate through the company I work for.  But, it was awesome!

There is a nice mall right across the street with several nice restaurants with varied cuisine.  The beach is about a 20 minute walk from this hotel (estimate).",5,2017,04,27
36,"Outstanding staff, service and a great location, too!","I've stayed at this hotel before and found on this occasion that the service was even better than previously. I hadn't thought they'd be able to better the previous service but they certainly did! The hotel is modern, located about 20 minutes from the very centre of the city but easily accessible by metro and bus. Handily, there were taxis on the corner every time we went in to town. It is also directly opposite the large Diagonal Mar shopping/restaurant complex. We opted for an Executive room because it gives you entrée to the Club Lounge (so handy for when you're in and out between tours or meetings) and a better type of room. Ours overlooked the city (much better than the ones overlooking the sea, as we had done previously, because at night the city lights are wonderful whereas you'd see only the blackness of the sea). The room was very large, with state-of-the-art shower and appliances and beds so comfortable you could be excused for thinking you'd gone to heaven! The service from al levels of staff was outstanding! Professional, prompt, efficient: nothing was a problem for them.",5,2017,04,24
36,short stay,"Really excellent hotel - 5 mins from subway. Staff were excellent, there is a nice beach 5 minutes walk away and you can walk to Port Olympic in 20 mins where there are lots of activities and restaurants.",5,2017,04,24
36,Good Hotel,"Good facilities, friendly staff, good location, many advantages, excellent breakfast, nice view, diagonal mar mall, not noisy, more attractive, i enjoied and stay there for second time, you can see Mediterranean sea as a nice view",5,2017,04,23
36,Excellent Hotel with Excellent Staff,"The hotel is just outside the city centre, opposite the Diagonal Mar shopping centre in a nice area with pleasant parks. NIce to walk around and feels very safe. We used the excellent trams and the metro system to get around the sights, but you can actually walk along the Avenue Diagonal from the Hilton to the city centre in less than half an hour, and it is a very pleasant walk.
The hotel? An excellent Hilton. Lovely rooms, excellent breakfast, great executive lounge with amazing views from the private terrace. But the highlight for us was the staff. Every single team member we dealt with was pleasant, helpful, and a delight to talk to. We also used the hotel's limo service to collect us from the airport and return us there upon departure. Not cheap but totally worth it. We had a brilliant stay and will definitely be back.",5,2017,04,22
36,Lovely hotel in central location.,"Hotel was about 20 minute drive from airport but could have been a lot longer in heavy traffic as the Diagonal can be a very busy road at peak times. Check in was very efficient as we had done most of it online a couple of days earlier. We had a nice room on the 11th floor with a nice city view. The room was spacious and very comfortable.
Buffet breakfast in the hotel were very good with a very good choice of hot and cold items. Did not use restaurant for dinner.
Hotel is about 5-10 minute walk from nearest metro station which we used a lot as we had purchased a 3 day public transport pass. Trams also run just outside hotel and bus stops also very close.
As gold card members we were allowed access to executive lounge if not too busy with diamond club members. 
Staff were all very nice and helpful with directions and organising trips.",4,2017,04,21
36,great staff lovely hotel,would suggest joining hilton loyalty scheme then pay for an executive room its a slight bit more for your room but you get to stay on one of the upper floors with great views of the beach or city or both if your lucky . also you get to use the executive lounge were you get continental breakfast/coffee/soft drinks etc. in the evening you can take a selection of alcohlic drinks and this doesnt cost you a penny extra.overall at great hotel in a beautiful city.note if staying at this hotel get a travel card they are not expensive(25 euros 96hours) and you can use metro/bus or tram to get into the citycentre also dowload the app it tells you when your bus is going to arrive and when to get off its free as well,4,2017,04,17
36,Great Hotel / Great Location,"My partner and I stayed at the Hilton Diagonal Mar for two nights over the weekend.  We were very pleased to be able to check-in early since our cruise dropped us off in th morning.   The front desk staff was very friendly and selected a lovely sea view room for us on the 20th floor.   

The room was very spacious and comfortable.   Room was clean and amenities were replenished during our stay.   Our only issue with the room was that it took forever to get cool.   So during the day the room was quite warm, but eventually cooled down.   The TV has limited English speaking channels.   

The executive lounge on the 15th floor has a lovely terrace and offered light items in the evening.   We enjoyed our time there and the staff was very friendly and helpful.
Location is good, being right across the street from a mall and a block from the beach.   

Our only issue at the hotel was with the pool.  Since we arrived early we wanted to spend some time at the pool, but due to limited seating at the pool it was impossible to find two chairs together.   While the hotel seems to be making the pool. and upgraded experience, it tends to have the opposite effect because it limits the space available for guests and thus made for a not so great experience.   Staff at the pool were less than helpful and seemed clueless, not offering any assistance whatsoever.   

Overall, we are satisfied with the hotel.   We wish that the pool situation would be different, but other than that, we had an enjoyable stay.   The location was quiet and we felt very safe there.",4,2017,04,17
36,Comfort and elegance with a view,"The best part of our stay were two of the front desk clerks who helped us during our stay.  Raquel, who checked us in, was extremely gracious and patient as it was our very first stop in Europe.  Later that day Anais was also very kind and helpful when she gave us a terrific restaurant recommendation.  The highlight of our trip to Barcelona was the Sandeman walking tour of the city which Anais highly recommended to us.  We are so grateful to her for bringing this tour to our attention - it was truly amazing.  Breakfast was a vast buffet - service was friendly and attentive.  Everyone in the hotel was quite friendly overall.",5,2017,04,16
36,Great stay,"Great stay at The Hilton. Lovely, spacious, modern room. Location was perfect as in a quiet location yet close to metro and beach. It was a treat to spend a few quiet hours at Puro Beach Urban Oasis after sightseeing in the city centre. We really enjoyed our stay.",5,2017,04,16
36,Love this Hilton,"My daughter, grandson, and I spend eight nights in this hotel, and it was a very positive experience.  The staff were very accommodating, friendly, and helpful.  Our room was always clean and prepared for us.  The Executive Lounge for Diamond members is in an excellent location with fabulous views of Barcelona and the sea.  The metro stop is very close which is convenient.  Highly recommend this Hilton.",5,2017,04,16
36,Screams I'm being fancy near the beach in spain,"Upon arrival, we were warmly greeted and because of my Hilton honors status, we ended up with an upgraded room.. all in all, a really pretty hotel. And just steps from the beach, so you can grab your towel and walk out on the sand. highly recommended.",5,2017,04,16
36,Somethings good..Somethings bad,"Be advised that the air conditioner turns off when you leave the room. And if you like a good health club, don't stay here. On a good note, the bar is great and the bar staff is very attentive. The location is excellent and you are right near the water. And the pool is great as well.",3,2017,04,14
36,Great hotel away from the bustle of the city!,"Great hotel 5 mins from the beech and beech bars, across from a mall with a number of restaurants. Easy access to the city via metro or hop on hop of buses.  Exec lounge crowded and could have had more of a selection as experienced in other Hilton exe lounges. Staff very helpful and friendly.",5,2017,04,13
36,Great Experience and Incredible Staff!,"I booked this hotel with HHonors points and did not have the highest expectations based on my experience with similar style hotels. The experience her was much different. The staff at this Hilton was incredible. From the concierge, front desk, bar, and bell hop - they all went above and beyond the call of duty to take care of us and ensure we had a great trip. All of this given we were not elite level Hilton Honors members (Silver). The hotel rooms were nice and amenities were perfect.",5,2017,04,12
36,A really nice stay ,"After reading some very negative reviews in here I nearly changed hotel. However I am a fan of Hilton brand and we ended up staying for two nights.  The hotel is great. Lovely welcome when you arrive very modern reception bar and lounge.   Reception staff good and accommodated everything I asked for.   The pool area was lovely and a very big bonus. Really enjoyed the pool. Had lunch two days by pool.  The bedroom was high 20 floor amazing views. Went into executive lounge really good with a nice terrace so you can sit outside.  Every night 6 to 8 they do nibbles and drinks   Asked for a late check out. That was no problem.   Outside opposite is restaurants and a. If shopping centre if you don't want to go into town every night.  Very reasonable.    To go into town you need a taxi which is 15 euro   To get to airport 30 euro.   The beach is ten minutes walk.  Would recommend hotel 
",5,2017,04,11
36,Palm Sunday weekend,"Very nice Hilton Hotel near the beach, across the street from Diagonal Mar Shopping Mall. My room was on the 13th floor with sea view and quite spacious. Friendly personnel and good quality buffet breakfast. Local cheeses  and ham are provided among the usual Hilton food offered.",4,2017,04,10
36,Good hotel near the centre,"The hotel is good, conveniently located opposite a huge shopping centre and 5 minutes walking distance to the underground which brings you to the centre in 5- 10 minutes. We had a nice room on an upper floor with a nice view. water pressure in the bathroom was not so great and bathroom amenities were small and a bit too less for 2 persons. The breakfast was good, buffet style, with some attentive staff. The executive lounge had a nice rooftop garden. The concierge was very friendly and helpful. All in all a good stay in a great city",4,2017,04,10
36,Couples trip to Barcelona,This hotel was conveniently located next to a mall and the metro. The cost saving of the hotel was at the expense of using the metro daily which added about 15 minutes. Trains were available every 3-5 min. ,5,2017,04,09
36,Great hotel,"The view from the room was awesome, the Hilton lounge is really a nice touch and welcoming - great breakfast and sunrise. Staff were exceptional - bar staff that helpful are rare. Somewhere I would go in a heart beat. Really well done ",5,2017,04,08
36,Lovely Stay,"Stayed here for 4 nights and throughly enjoyed it.  Good service with very attentative and committed staff.  We had a lovely room next to the executive lounge which was handy and had a lovely view of the sea,  The food and drinks in the Exceutive Lounge were excellent.  One of the few remaining executive lounges which offer such a good variety. Would recommend that any visitors trade up to an exec room. Well worth it. We walked to most attractions down the diagonal which kept us fit. Great memory.  Thanks Hilton.",5,2017,04,05
36,Pleasant stay&nice hotel,"We stayed at Hilton Diagonal Mar for 3 nights during a city-break.From airport(witch is a little like a labirinth) we took the Renfe train until Paseig de Grácia,and from there the metro until Maresme/Forum.It took us about one hour and 15minutes to get there from the airport.The hotel is quite impressive,nice lobby area,we got a room at the 17-th floor and we could see the sea from the window(1705 room).There is a mall in the front of the hotel if you want to shopping.It is not very far away from the atractions,the metro conection is very well.But now,I will tell my opinion about the hotel staff during our stay.I have a BIG PLUS for the Housekeeping team,we find a very cleaned room at our arrivel,and from entire stay it remained the same,clean(I have ""the eye"" because I work in Housekeeping too).We had a little funny incident Sunday,but everything was ""fixed"".My second BIG PLUS is going to F&B Breakfast team,especially to Simone.She was very nice with us,in the second morning when we took the breakfast she remembered that the day before my dother had pancakes and asked imediatly if she want again.The second person who paid atention at the breakfast was Sandy from kitchen.I watch her 2 mornings,and she was always there,changing the food with another,so I really admired her,that's way I asked her name.I have only a sugestion for the F&B Supervisor:put more people in the breakfast area,2 mornings I saw only 2!!!and that was not enough.Unfortunatly I have a BIG MINUS for the Front-Desk team,still waiting an answer to my email that I sent a week ago to their Supervisor.And I have a good advise to them:make a guest to feel like a guest!!!",4,2017,04,02
36,Hilton By The Sea,A great hotel by the sea with very lovely lobby and warm welcome upon checking in. Our junior suite is enormous with a view of the sea. Breakfast is sumptuous with a big selection of hot and cold food and eggs on order. Service is efficient and attentive all round. The location is a bit outside the city centre but the metro is only 5 mins' walk. The hotel is also conveniently located opposite the biggest shopping mall in Barcelona. ,5,2017,04,01
36,Repeated visit - quality decreased avoid during Christmas,"Went back to the hotel for Christmas and found my feedback from a previous stay about upgrades was not taken into consideration which means the hotel Manager actually doesn't care much.

During Christmas the hotel is kind of empty which has an impact on the quality. Whilst last year the breakfast was stunning this year I was disappointed. Thankfully due to Diamond status I did not pay extra but

A) No fresh station for eggs etc like in 2015
B) Staff doesn't care about quality, found scrambled microwave eggs cold, dated food because of early or previous day preparation, less items to choose
C) Boring Executive lounge - less quality food than 2015

Room etc is all what you expect.

Unfortunately I forgot a tumbler in the room and expected the hotel to inform me but only after a week when I inquired they actually replied which means even they found it in the room they didn't follow up. 

Clear Management problem- quality decreased 
",3,2017,04,01
36,In Barcelona will stay at Hilton Diagonol Mar hereinafter for weekends!,"Decided to spend my wedding anniversary in Barcelona ahead of my meetings in Madrid and friends recommended  ""W"" for various reasons location/sea view in particular. But the price was too high and availability was suspect. Hilton Diagnol Mar appeared as a possible option @ HiltonHonors website.

Realise now it was one of the wise decisions! Excellent location/view (slightly inferior to W but still good sea-view on onesie), good rooms - believe there are refurbishing. Though we stayed in an old room, it was good with Seaview. 

The service was more interesting, they have Francesco at the Reception (who must have sold Sand in Sahara previously??!!) to make you believe that your room is the best room in town followed by an enthusiastic staff who offer no-nonsense service.

Pleasantly surprised when Leonardo from Roomservice arrived wth Champagne and cake arrived in the evening. Obviously someone noticed it was my wife's birthday (didn't tell them it was our wedding anniversary also!) and went the extramile to organise this. Leonardo set-up the table and left after wishing my wife who first thought I had made the arrangements!! till I told her the truth

Do hope and expect Hilton will encourage this team, help them upgrade even further. I shall ask my friends to try HILTON DIAGONAL MAR next time when they are in Barcelona next. Really impressed and I still have a night to go at this place.",5,2017,04,01
36,Out of Order - stay elsewhere,"Out of Order seems to be the main theme in this property - from the ice machine to the car park payment kiosk, it's a constant stream of issues.

Check-in was fairly cursory and not very friendly. Not 1 hour in the room the light sensor seized, shutting down the ceiling lights and had to be deactivated. I couldn't get the A/C to provide any stronger flow of air despite trying the various settings - flagged this with reception upon going out and there was no change whatsoever upon returning.

The ""sea view"" for which I paid extra is entirely unimpressive and the room is incredibly small, with a very dated decor (the ""art"" in the room looks like it was put together by a 15 year old). Shower is small and cramped due to a corner in the wall reducing the space.

Finally, a major pet-peeve - the automatic mini-bar, where all items are on pressure pads: touch one and you get billed. This is a nightmare with kids but the hotel has thought about this - want mini-bar emptied? That will be another 15 euros... outrageous.
 
There are so many good hotels in Barcelona that staying here is entirely un-necessary. Would not return nor recommend.",2,2017,04,01
36,"Very, very nice","I moved to this property after staying at another hotel by the conference centre. The Hilton beats the Princess, the AC and Diagonal Zero. 

Very large modern lobby. Front desk staff is very friendly. The hotel is super clean and modern. The room was spacious and was what one would expect of a Hilton in Europe. I have nothing bad to say about the hotel at all. A huge mall is across the street, including restaurants with patios. 

The sea is a couple of minutes away. Other than the mall and the beach there is nothing to do in the neighbourhood. You won't get the typical Spanish feel here but downtown is just a quick metro ride away. It is nice to come back to this very nice quiet hotel after a day in busy downtown Barcelona. 

The pool was closed which was unfortunate. Outside pool area did look great though.",5,2017,03,31
36,"Nice hotel, great welcome, staff very customer oriented","Checked in at noon, received a very nice upgrade (corner room with a nice sea view + executive lounge access for the whole family), the reception desk also arranged a much earlier room availability, first impression is just great!

Hotel well located to go walking along the beaches and just in front of the shopping mall but about 4km to get to downtown, not an issue because of the many options you have to get there in minutes.

Went into the executive lounge for a drink and was very impressed by the entire staff, very pro and super customer minded.

We still have 4 nights ahead but would recommend it without a doubt so far!",4,2017,03,30
36,Stunning hotel - superb location,"Our four night stay was in a twin executive room on the 23rd floor.  The door opened from the lift and there in front on you was a panoramic view of the city. You opened the door to our room and looked straight out to an ocean view - stunning.  The room was spacious with a large bathroom.  We paid for the use of the fridge, which I would thoroughly recommend.  Being an executive member of Hilton, we had free wifi, but wifi is available throughout the hotel.
Hilton is not a budget hotel so if you want cheap then chose another hotel.  The service throughout the hotel was first class, nothing was too much trouble - from the front desk and concierge to the cleaners.  It is the little things that make this hotel special, like our toiletries in the bathroom which were refreshed each day.  The food was delicious.  Having use of the Executive Lounge made the stay.
The hotel is a five minute walk to the beach and five minute walk to the tram and metro.  During the summer months, the open top bus tours stops just outside. Right opposite the hotel is a large shopping mall with restaurants, stores and a supermarket.   There is a large outdoor swimming pool complex which is seasonal. A good gym.  
This hotel is perfect for either a quick getaway, a full vacation and had all the facilities for business use. We used the hotels limousine service, were collected from the airport with no hassle and returned the same way.  The hotel was around 30 minutes from the airport.
Being a cosmopolitan hotel, language was not a barrier wherever you are from.
Go and try it, you will love it.",5,2017,03,30
36,"Good hotel, clean and comfortable","Rooms were good, decent size and clean; the latter is very important. I had dinner in the bar one night, it was a bit messy and not a great location if you like to relax after a long day. The food was ok, very large size, I would have appreciated smaller sizes. 
The hotel is quite some distance from the city, but close to beach and conference centre. 
I enjoyed the beds, only don't like the soft pillows at Hilton in general; I always ask for hard pillows but they don't have them. The wifi is ok, not particularly fast, especially the complimentary one, but reasonable. 
All together nice hotel with some very positive points and a few minor points that could be improved upon. ",4,2017,03,28
36,BASIC & BORING ! ,"Firstly I would like to thank Simona from the breakfast restaurant, her service was truly amazing & always willing to help.

Now ! Before going away I requested a few thing & in return I got email confirmations stating my request were accepted but when I arrived nothing was fulfilled ! No facilities were working including sauna- disappointing.
Bedroom dated but ok. Nothing great about the hotel defiantly not returning.",2,2017,03,26
36,"Beautiful views, spacious suites, friendly hotel!","We enjoyed 2 long stays here during our 1st trip ever to Spain! We 1st stayed 5 nights, then flew to tour Italy and other cities in Spain, then returned for another long stay before flying back to USA. We had a beautiful suite on a high floor with great city and ocean views! We had a King size bed, then a pull out sofa bed in living room area for our son to sleep on. Front desk staff was very friendly and helpful. We received nice upgrades as Hilton Honors/Diamond. We enjoyed the 15th fl Exec Lounge privileges daily. There was a small safe in room & refridgerator/mini bar. It was not high season so the pool/bar outdoor areas were not open/staffed. My husband used the work out  facility and said it was nice/clean. We enjoyed hotel location across from Mall w/ many restaurants and a short walk to Metro station. But this hotel was not located by many of the popular sites tourists would want to go to. It was nice there was always a line of available taxis waiting outside of hotel to take you if needed. The restaurant offered a very nice breakfast buffet and was accommodating.",5,2017,03,26
36,Great door man Ivanov,"Located beside conference center is very convenient but above all to student out a doorman Bulgarian to help me with many small things including carrying bags and night watch ETOrre

Lounge appropriate to a little modest on top floors grade you",3,2017,03,23
36,Terrible Hilton- waste of money!,"Awful hotel- Very poor Service & Quality-so over priced.

My husband and I were put into a old run down dated room- when asked to moved we had to negotiate a new price (even though my husband is a Hilton Honors member) they wanted additional payment on top of the €270 a night- 
Priced like a 5 star  hotel but is really a 3 star. Window would not open in the new room so had to change again to another room with another broken window- took 3 calls to get it fixed and 3 moves!! Painful on top of it all being asked for additional payment!! 

Ordered room service - wrong order, finally new order came and food was awful.

Internet comes and goes 

Definitely would not recommend this hotel",1,2017,03,21
36,Weekend stay,A bit far out from city centre. Excellent executive lounge made up for exorbitant prices in the mini bar. Nice walk from the hotel down avenue diagonal to city centre. Close to Diagonal Mar shopping centre and large selection of different eating places.,4,2017,03,21
36,"The Worst Hilton Hotel - Don't Waste Your Money, stay someplace else.","We arrived after midnight. The staff were so upset that why we bothered them to check in that late night. They were rude, disrespectful and hostile. They asked to see passport of all my family members (it has never happened to me even though I have stayed in hotels worldwide including Hilton Barcelona city). I did not have energy to argue so I gave him all passports. I asked for upgrade as I am a Gold member and was told that they were sold out even though the parking was empty and in the morning, I hardly see any guest (no wonder that people don't stay there, I'll never go there). We woke up late and missed the breakfast in the executive lounge and discovered that the lounge has been closed for cleaning (even though I have booked and paid the executive floor room), I asked front desk about this and they said ""too bad, the lounge is closed"", I can go to restaurant and pay for the food. Every other Hilton always has given me the option of going to restaurant or lounge or give vouchers as I am a gold member plus I have booked the room with breakfast on executive floor. So I did not use the lounge at night because it was closed and I could not go in the morning as it was closed (wow – why did I pay for the executive floor). The staff attitude was very hostile. I booked the hotel as it was falsely advertised the beach front hotel. The hotel is not on the beach but far away, you have to walk 15 minutes to get to the beach. There is no reason to stay on this property as there are plenty of nice hotels in the area, I switched next day to other Hilton in Barcelona; they treated me like the way Hilton treat their loyal members, the friendly customer service is striking different so it is not Barcelona but it is the staff and management of Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona who choose to be rude, disrespectful and hostile to their guests. This is by far the worst Hilton hotel I have ever experienced.
Plus, the room was so small, I have booked the King Executive Suite, if this is the state of affairs for the suite, I don't know what would regular rooms will be.
I still don't understand why the attitude of staff is such when they are supposed to be in the hospitality industry.",1,2017,03,18
36,Great experience,"Great hotel right beside the conference centre . 
Staff very friendly.
tried to  accommodate and support everyone with taxi strike 
Room service food was excellent .
Only negative is price of water in room .",5,2017,03,17
36,Never again,"The only service of interest to this hotel is to help you empty the contents of your wallet into their cash-register. Nothing, nothing, comes without a high price. I'm surprised they don't charge extra for each  flush of the lavatory. As a final insult they failed to let us know there was a taxi drivers' strike when we needed to get to the airport on our final morning. The hotel is very badly situated in a very boring location. Never again. ",1,2017,03,16
36,Good business hotel,"Stayed here during the Mobile World Congress and it was really set up for catering for large numbers of people. Was put in an executive suite, which was huge - dining table for 8 people and separate bathroom.  Lovely experience - just a shame when one is travelling for work, not too much time is spent at the hotel.  Very comfortable room and great and helpful staff.  It was a 20 min drive minimum from anywhere i needed to be- but lots of taxis there",4,2017,03,14
36,"very good location, near to convention center","5 minutes walk from the convention center with numerous small and big meetings rooms, appropriate business center. Nice Buffet for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Very convenient for meetings. Also 5 minutes walk from the beach. Tramway in front of the hotel.",4,2017,03,13
36,Very nice hotel,We were upgraded to a suite on the 20th floor. Excellent view of both the city and the ocean. Really one of the nicest rooms I've stayed in at all the Hilton's I've been to. Very spacious with a nice bathroom. Only complaint I have is the selection of beer in the bar. Only 2 beers on tap is really disappointing for this caliber of hotel. Apart from that we had excellent service from all the staff. Would stay there again if I ever go back to Barcelona.,4,2017,03,11
36,Nice place to stay,"The strength was with the staff which goes out of their way to ensure you are satisfied.  The only reason the Sleep Quality is Very Good is the curtains do not fully block the light and as a pilot that flies all night and sleeps during the day, that is extremely important.  For people that sleep during normal hours, not a problem.",5,2017,03,11
36,Best hotel to stay in Barcelona!,Great rooms with sea view...excellent breakfast facility...amazing staff...perfect location...there is nothing to dislike about. This was our second 5 night stay in last six month...enjoyed every bit of it!,5,2017,03,09
36,Great hotel - but quite pricey!,"The hotel is well situated if attending an event at the nearby conference centre. The staff are attentive and extremely helpful. We stayed in an executive suite and had access to the lounge which was nice and quiet. The rooms themselves were spacious and had a good view of the beach. The bathroom looked a bit tired to me, expected a separate shower and bath but that's only a very minor point. Nice hotel all in all

However it is quite expensive. Not only for a room, but good, drink and the minibar are pretty pricey! 6 euros for a Kitkat, 8 euros for a Heineken and 20 euros for a burger. ",4,2017,03,09
36,Excellent Hotel,This is a good hotel which provides all that you would expect of a well run Hilton Hotel. It is a little way from the city centre but excellent transport links mean that this is not a problem - it takes about 15 mins on the tram or a little longer on the bus to get close to the city centre. The Executive lounge is very nice with a generally good offering.,5,2017,03,07
36,Great hotel - far from the action,"Group trip, excellent facilities, great rooms, fantastic breakfast. Pool and pool bar is great, real party feel, when sun is shining.  It is some way from central Barca and nightlife but definitely would return.",5,2017,03,05
36,Hilton at its finest!,Top notch customer service from arrival to departure! The views of the city from the executive level are amazing. The ocean view at sunrise is stunning! I would highly recommend this property to anyone wanting to stay near the water. ,5,2017,03,04
36,Great Location Out of Downtown,"We really enjoyed our vacation in Barcelona.  The hotel room (Deluxe King) was very roomy for us and our two small kids.  The hotel is not downtown which was great for us.....very close to the metro and quiet area near a mall and restaurants.  If you are a Hilton Honors member, the executive lounge is fantastic.",5,2017,03,01
36,Great weekend experience,"Although a bit off from the town center, only a couple of minutes away by taxi. Great service experience when checking in as well as in the lounge. Great room with top Hilton standard, friendly and professional staff. Really good experience!",5,2017,02,26
36,Business,"Very nice hotel and very nice location with a beautiful view of Barcelona.  The staff were pretty well trained, and all the services met my expectations. As a Hilton Honor member, I was selected as the guest of the day.  So, I was happy with that.",5,2017,02,20
36,First class,Clean Luxury Hotel with outstanding facilities. Perfect location near Congress Center (3 minute walk) and across street from large shopping mall with numerous restaurants. Perfect for business.  Its location is not close to city center and tourist attractions but for business trip its perfect.,5,2017,02,20
36,Good place to stay for the congress centre,"Nice clean rooms, friendly and helpful staff especially at breakfast time, and food retry good for a chain hotel. Meeting room a bit stuffy but not a major issue. Would definitely recommend to delegates attending the CCIB but a bit far from the city centre",4,2017,02,19
36,Great For Conferences,"I had was here for a conference. The hotel was prices very reasonably with a very good included breakfast. The rooms were large, clean and the staff was friendly and accommodating. The nearby shopping mall was convenient for some shopping needs.

Unfortunately, as is usual for a conference-oriented hotel, there aren't many food options in the area (outside the nearby mall) and city signature attractions are likewise far away and require using public transportation. 

If you're among those who like to stay in the city while at a conference, there are probably other options. Otherwise, this is a great hotel.",4,2017,02,19
36,Great option by convention center,"Modern, very clean, comfortable.  Room and bed terrific. Great views from higher floor. Across street from Diagonal Mall with great shops , restaurants, and food court for kid.  Executive lounge with limited breakfast and snack options. Very easy to get to beach area.  Free wifi.  Lobby restaurant excellent. ",4,2017,02,19
36,good hotel for business meeting at convention center,"Good hotel for business meeting. Staff were very accommodating. Wifi (premium) excellent. I gave it an average rating because overall the rooms are a bit tired, the bed somewhat flat and the water pressure/bath not great. I was also surprised that during my three days, they didn't refill the minibar of the waters I drank. ",3,2017,02,18
36,Medium quality & service,"The hotel is close to the harbour, cruises, and near to the Diagonal Mar shopping center.
Nice and clean entrance area, as well as good restaurant (breakfast).

The rooms are large, but some years old and some minor things sre missing, e.g. waste basket on the desk, glass for tooth brush in the bathroom, etc.

Overall, a good hotel with medium quality, as the rate is quite high.
",3,2017,02,15
36,Short stay,"Very nice hotel , friendly staff , good spot , very clean , near a shopping mall, near the beach, near the ramblas, very nice swimming pool. Good hotel for business or to visit with the family , quiet area",4,2017,02,13
36,A Room with an Amazing View,"I stayed at the Hilton Diagonal Mar recently on a business trip. Here is my feedback:

1. Location is not too bad but it is on the other side of the city so you will need either a taxi or public transport to get around. Luckily there is a Metro Station 5 minutes away and you can be in the city center in 20 minutes.
2. The Hotel is modern and everything is clean and the staff are very friendly.
3. I got a room on a high floor and had the most amazing view over the city. The room was large, and the bed was very comfortable.
4. I got access to the executive lounge where I had breakfast every morning. Decent breakfast and again friendly staff that were very accommodating.
5. Right in front of a large shopping mall with lots of restaurants. It was raining one of the days that I was here, so it was convenient to just run across to the mall and grab something to eat.

This is a great Hilton property and I would stay here again, but just wished it was closer to the center of the city.",5,2017,02,12
36,Very bad...,"We chose this hotel due to the location as it is close to the residence of our friends. The first thing that I liked at all, it is the inability to open the fresh air shortage spoil the mood, constantly running the air conditioner in the automatic mode. Shut it is simply impossible. Asked to open the window, we refused, citing security rules. However, the window itself opens only at an angle of 10-15 °, since it is set to lock, respectively, that will give the possibility to open the window completely, and people could not fall in any situation. Very meager breakfast and care attitude of the staff. There is little available sun loungers by the pool. On weekends, allowed visitors from the street to the pool, where entertainment party, so the site a lot of drunken youth, vulgar and aggressive. Very uncomfortable pillows. One elevator was broken, this problem could not be eliminated for almost a day, those who came to the hotel and those who went out of his worn if your bags up the stairs yourself !!! Personally, I, four times per day help women carry baby strollers and bags from the 10th floor. Porter and simply disappeared somewhere at this time! In short, the hotel is not up to its brand. The only plus is the location of his place, near the beach and near the shopping center.",1,2017,02,12
36,Location superb,1st time to Barcelona. I'm a Hilton guy and picked this one out to stay. Not disappointed. Took a taxi from the airport--$37 US or 34 Euros. Right across the street from a large mall with upscale shops and many restaurants. 2 blocks to metro which will take you everywhere for 2 Euros each way. Ask for room up high with sea view. The Executive Lounge has a free happy hour from 6-8pm nightly. Good food and beverages. Great friendly staff. Little cool to swim in Feb. temp still not bad 50-60 degrees daytime. Great city views from the lounge also. I would recommend this hotel. ,5,2017,02,11
36,Great for business,"Close to beach for running, with pool to relax from weather and drink, and a shopping center just across  the street with a lot of restaurants. The rooms are clean and well designed with office desk behind the bed so that bed view is on the beach and sea.",4,2017,02,11
36,Beautiful Hotel With Great Service,"I stayed at this property about a year ago and decided to come back as it was much nicer than a couple Marriott properties I tried in Barcelona. This stay was even more impressive! The hotel staff are extremely friendly and very willing to accommodate your needs such as a better room view or questions regarding the city/property. The rooms are renovated and very nice. If you have access, the executive lounge also is large and has a great spread in the evenings. If not, there is a mall conveniently located right across the street. The hotel is also very reasonable priced for being a 10 minute taxi ride from most attractions around the city.

A few minor complaints are that 95% of the mini fridge was stocked with an automatic mini-bar. Also, even though the bathroom was spacious, the shower is poorly designed and water leaked onto the floor every time I used the shower. 

Overall, I would for sure recommend this hotel and will be planning all my future trips to Barcelona at this property.",5,2017,02,08
36,Perfect Holiday,It was our first trip with our new baby but the staff in the hotel managed to make this the best holiday yet. The rooms are spacious and modern with great facilities in the hotel. The shopping centre across the road has a vast array of restaurants and bars that are open well into the evening.,5,2017,02,08
36,Close to Beach and Business,"Location of hotel is great, walking distance to lots of offices, shopping center directly on opposite side of the street. Spacious parking. Rooms are great with astounding views to the beach. Fitness is rather small but well equipped.",5,2017,02,05
36,Disappointed,I thought I was booking something special ie Hilton Hotels have a reputation of being amongst the best in the world. The room was dated and must be last on the list for an upgrade.  The was room was clean apart from the shower which was black where the hose curves and the wood surround on the casing was water damage and had swelled and was coming away.  The amenities were very cheap and tea/coffee was not always topped up.  The mini bar has a system whereby it you move something you will  automatically get charged for it so you couldn't put anything of you own in it incase you moved something of theirs and got charged. There were no bathrobes or slippers. The breakfast although plentiful was for the most part luke warm or cold. On the plus side it was near a good shopping centre and around the corner from the train/underground station.  I wouldn't say it is that bad you need to give it a miss but wouldn't pay  premium rates per night for something that basic. For my first stay at Hilton Hotels it was very disappointing.,3,2017,02,04
36,Good hotel for business trip,"Just stayed here for 2 nights for a business trip. Thought it was good and would return on business. What was great about it was the service - on check in and check out there was no wait, in the restaurant at breakfast there were plenty of people on hand to assist if needed and in the bar in reception area to order drinks & snacks. Compared to other recent hotel visits, this stood out for me. 

Slept well in comfortable room. Went out to eat to the shopping centre opposite - as other folks have said, loads of choice there. We had pasta one night and fish the next.",4,2017,02,04
36,PreCruise Hotel Stay,"Greeted by staff with friendly smile as soon as our private transport pulled in at the front of lobby door. Immediately led to Registration counter. Registration staff were very friendly, professional and very much service oriented. Upon knowing that we are one of  Royal Caribbean guests, we were instantly upgraded to a Suite situated on top floor (can't remember the floor number) at a corner with a magnificent view of the Mediterranean Sea, Sea Port, and Diagonal Mar Shopping Mall which is right across Hyatt Hotel. Christobal, the staff who catered to us was very warm, friendly and professional which made our stay more comfortably relaxing. The waitress and the Chef went out of his way to meet my request, making the Seafood Paella for me alone. Traditionally, Paella is prepared for more than 1 person. Chef willingly cooked the Paella for me since my husband doesn't eat seafood. Didn't have to make a trip to Las Ramblas to venture into crowded place for the Tapas and Seafood Paella. The Hyatt Restaurant chef made the 2 dishes especially for me. Kudos to their excellent service. Highly recommended for hotel stay. Will be booking again Oct for our precruise hotel accommodation.",5,2017,02,03
36,Excellent 👌 ,This was my second time to visit Hilton diagonal mar Barcelona and definitely won't be the last. First of all the staff is very friendly and it's only just a five minute walk to the beach. It's also near the diagonal mar mall which has many shops and restaurants. I'd like to thank all staff members and especially Miguel for such an unforgettable experience.,5,2017,02,02
36,Very Good Hotel,"Great hotel, met expectations for the Hilton Brand.  Great location for beach, and good lnks to center 10 mins away.  Good food and friendly helpful staff.  Would highly recommend a visit for business or leisure",5,2017,01,31
36,Perfect business place,"This Hilton is located 200 meters from the seaside. If you have a room with this view, especially on the business floor from 19 to 22th stage, you will greatly appreciate. The room is nice, and, which is not frequent, you can slightly open a window. This is important for those who do not like so much to stay in a closed box!
The only detail that I have to mention is that, for me, the shower is weak. Bt it is only a little detail. Regarding the facilities, it is really convenient for a meeting.",5,2017,01,27
36,Comparing Hiltons,"So my second time here, very nice hotel at good location this time in a executive room on top floor.
Ex. lounge is 👍👍good care by the staff.
Room is good but on the topfloor the water presure for the shower is mwahhh.
my fridge was making more noise then a boeing so unplugged it myself, staff should have noticed it.
Then the parking (almost empty) but expected if you charge 36 euro per night , i come at 20.00 and leave before 0700 is more then 3 euro per hour 🤐.
why not lower the price and it will be used more, and give regular guests a discount of say 50%.
This keeps holding me back for staying here more often.
The restaurant then is a different story, see my other review.",4,2017,01,26
36,Barcelona Hilton Diagonal Mar,Hotel was very nice and in a great location.   Room was of sufficient size and had a minibar.  I like the fact that the bathroom had a tub and shower separate. I had a room with two tiny twin beds.  Very uncomfortable. And the TV had only 2 channels in English.  And no Fox News which I prefer over other new networks,3,2017,01,26
36,Nice views,"I have been in a few hiltons before but I have to say that I didn't feel like I have been in hilton this time. 
Don't know service and staff and everything was great but .. I think every single Hilton should have the same standards in terms of cleanliness because its such a huge chain of hotels and no matter what they should keep their standards everywhere in the world and you should not feel like ok I'm in Spain and those are their standards and lets accept that. It shouldn't be like that. 
When I was in lobby bar i have spotted high in the corner of ceiling huge spider web I dont know what kind of spider made this enormous web but like maybe 10 tarantulas were living there. And other bits and pieces i could see which didn't meet Hilton standards(in my eyes). 
But other then that i can say staff was friendly food was nice and I have to point out the views on nearly whole barcelona were beautiful.",4,2017,01,26
36,Fantastic stay..thanks everyone,"We went with friends to celebrate my husbands birthday and had a truly wonderful time thanks to the excellent staff who work in this super Hotel.  The location is so peaceful with wonderful views of the sea, city and mountains, but yet so close to all that Barcelona has to offer.

We were greeted very warmly by the young man at reception, sorry didn't get his name and he informed us we were getting an upgrade..wow..we had the use of the Executiive Lounge which is on the 15th floor and has a wonderful outside terrace with great views, not to mention the additional afternoon teas and appetisers with drinks pre dinner.

We ate in the Hotel and enjoyed excellent food both in the bar and the Indigo restuarant . As you expect from a Hilton hotel breakfast was great with lots of very attentive staff to look after the guests.The beds were very comfortable and house keeping done an excellent job every morning.

As mentioned earlier this Hotel had super staff but there were some who just stood out from the rest during out stay.  Carlos at Concierge was very helpful. Albert, in the bar had a smile which would light up a room and obviously loves his job. Elisa and Victor at breakfast could not have done any more to ensure our breakfast was a great start to the day. David, in Indigo made our birthday dinner a wonderful experience and last but not least Georgiana, in the Executive Lounge, who was so helpful in tips and advice to maximise our stay whilst in Barcelona. She told about some super places we would not have found otherwise.  A very big thank you to all who made our trip so enjoyable and we plan to return again very soon.",5,2017,01,23
36,Superb accommodation,Beautiful hotel start to finish. The rooms are large and well-appointed. The breakfast buffet is world class. The fellas in the lobby bar took great care of us. And the front desk staff is absolutely superb. ,5,2017,01,21
36,Excellent in every way - 5*,"I stayed here for four days at New Year. Excellent hotel in every way. Great room with a lovely sea view, amazing breakfast each morning and about a ten minute walk from the metro station, which takes you into the city centre.

There's a large shopping centre across from the hotel which has a supermarket so you can stock-up on essentials and it has various places to eat.

I'd stay here again in a heartbeat. Thanks to all the wonderful and friendly staff who looked after us during our stay.

You won't be disappointed if you book this hotel.",5,2017,01,21
36,"Comfortable , hilton hospitality.","We went to Barcelona during La Mercè festival and opted to stay in this hotel which was a bit away from it all , there are 3 reasons I chose this hotel 
a) convenience of the Mall across the road
b) Close proximity to the Marina as I would be taking a cruise after
c) There is a big bus tour bus stop just near the hotel.

a)BEcause of the festival and the public holidaythe mall was mostly closed that weekend although the restaurants were open. Halaal option in the mall. I was really disappointed that the stores were closed , hoped to get some shopping done. But generally in Barcelona its important to note , that Sunday is not for shopping . 
b) The marina was not really close to the hotel, the hotel is close to the beach . But had I stayed in the city centre it would have taken me the same time or even less to get to the port .
c) The big bus tour did stop 100 m away from the hotel which was fantastic. I bought tickets at the hotel and this worked to plan as the tour took as all through the city and we got back to the hotel using the bus as well . This was very convenient.

The hotel is away from the city centre. But I would stll recommend it. It was neat and comfortable. The views from the executive lounge were beautiful. The size of the window in the room was really small height but long width . . I wonder why this was considering the beautiful view outside. Breakfast was good. 
The hotel did take a deposit off my card twice and it took numerous calls to Barcelona and explanations to try and sort this out.",4,2017,01,21
36,Perfect for families,"We spent total of 5 nights here .Location was perfect for us . The Beach is  less than 10 mins walk we had so much fun on the beach cold as hell but still great . There is aHuge mall with every thing from amusement arcades to restaurants etc right outside the hotel again enough to keep the kids busy. Hop on hop off stops outside the hotel as well. Metro can be found behind the huge mall. 
Staff were great.We had issues getting interconnected rooms but the manager finally sorted it out .Again great staff esp cristobal at checkin who upgraded us and gave us access to lounge on  our last night . He helped us with all our queries and spoke spoke english well which  was a huge releif for us . we were on halfboard bad move on our part as there were so many restaurants in tb nearbymall. We were given  the same food everyday for breakfast and worse the dinner menu was the same every night!!!! After 2 nights of looking at the same food Thankfully we met bartender David  he did everything to make it right . He even changed the  boring menu and arranged for some great steaks and  even managed to get ice cream and candy for the kids. He is truly exceptional  .He did everything to make our stay pleasant.",5,2017,01,16
36,Mixed bag,"Some nice people (Francesco, Sarah) some less than courteous folks. Some forgetfulness in terms of diamond membership niceties. Beautiful room, though small for what was to be terms an executive room.",3,2017,01,13
36,Best Views in Town,"We love to be again and again at Hilton Diagonal Barcelona. Realy relaxing, verry friendly Staff, wondefull views over the City and ofcorse over the Sea. I would recommend a Junior Suite or if can afford, the Presidental Suite that brings relaxation to a new level with it's great views and big Whirlpool that fit's up to 4 People...",5,2017,01,10
36,Bev and Jon Gregory,We stayed here in an Executive room from 29th December 2016 until 3rd January 2017. We were pleased with the staff throughout the Hotel and the general vibe was good. However I know it is a predominately business based Hotel but the Executive bedroom was very basic in terms of decor. The Executive lounge had a very pleasant vista and the staff were very friendly although it became very busy at times and some who who were only able to sit down if the went outside on the balcony were offered blankets to keep them warm. I would suggest that they make the area set aside for children smaller and bring in a few more tables and chairs to house the paying guests.  The food in the Executive lounge was good but not brilliant and the options limited with regard to choices but nobody went without. We ate in the restaurant downstairs one night and the food and service was very good. I have stayed in many Hiltons and it was a lovely place to stay although a little far out for the city centre.,4,2017,01,09
36,3 Days in Barcelona,"My wife and I stayed here on a quick vacation to Barcelona.  This was a very nice hotel and good location, next to the sea, the mall and train station.  The front desk personnel where awesome.  Very helpful and made great suggestions for dinner.   One of the best concierge lounges I have seen at a Hilton, with great views of the city.  We have to come back during the Summer, to visit the fantastic looking elevated pool bar and cabanas.",4,2017,01,07
36,Great hotel,"The room and amenities were perfect. The breakfast were great, they provide gluten free bread and a wodnerful buffet with many choices. The bedding is comfortable and the rooms quiet. The mall opposite the hotel has many nice food choices, tapas, chinese and a great ice-cream place.",5,2017,01,07
36,Great all around,"outstanding staff form the reservation team to the front desk , great location, quit and by the sea beautiful facility, great value for the stay. We had a great experience there. We will go back anytime.",5,2017,01,06
36,Love love love it!,"Absolutely had the best time here. Hotel is amazing, probably helped by the fact it was my birthday and my boyfriend is a Hilton Diamond member so they upgraded us to the presidential suite - unreal! The view from the room so absolutely beautiful. You could see over the whole city, you could see the beach which is a 5 minute walk away. There was an amazing bathroom, the bath was huge and had loads of jacuzzi like settings and there was also a small descreet window for a view from there, shower was also great. Bed was huge and great. The first day they brought up free Cava and cake for my birthday, the staff were so lovely and so helpful. The hotel was clean and modern as was the room, cleaners left it spotless every day. There was no balcony but the excutive lounge had a big one to eat/drink out on. View was also great of the city from there but a bit lower than our room. The view of the beach wasn't the best as other buildings were in the way but still lovely. There was a bus stop right near by for the bus tours that you can buy which I would 100% reccomend over the Metro. It takes you to all the best spots and attractions, so worth the money as it has 3 routes. Helpful because it's not in the centre of the city but it doesn't take long by tour bus or can which are reasonably priced, they work on a meter. It's nice being further out anyway as it gives a better view. About 20 mins from the airport. Opposite is a shopping centre with lovely restaurants outside and great shops inside (Sephora!!). The pool area was lovely, music was slightly annoying but I guess that's just personal taste. One day the speakers were playing up and the noise was so loud, when it ended they brought us free cocktails to make up for it. Wouldn't have bought anything from the menus there to be honest, so expensive. The food in the exuctive lounge was also pretty decent. Honestly the best hotel I've stayed in and the best city. Beach isn't the best in the world obviously but it's still so lovely in a city. Love love loved it.",5,2017,01,06
36,Lovely stay,"5 minute walk from beach, the pool area is fun but also chilled. Cocktails at bar and by the pool were very good and the views were amazing. Definitely back this year. Shopping centre across the road with a Sephora so was happy with that!",5,2017,01,06
36,Very nice hotel,"Me and my husband booked the hotel for 5 nights -excellent choice.  The view of the Mediterranean and over the city was fabulous! The staff were very helpful -from the housekeeping to the concierge !

It is located a little further from the city center,but easily to reach by metro -there is a close station -3 min walking distance from the hotel.

The Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona is a good choice, close to the metro, across from a shopping mall, near the forum and financial district. The tourist areas can be easily reached by metro, and the beach is just few steps away.

The room was large and modern, but lacked power outlets -not possible to plug in phones next to the bed for example. The desk chair and lounger were very nice and very comfortable. The bed was also very comfortable.

Very good breakfast with a lot of choices and nice service. Juice and coffee delivered to your table and quick removal from used plates. 

The staff were welcoming, helpful, and always smiling. Certainly a hotel we would stay at again.

Highly recommend this hotel for leisure stays.",4,2017,01,03
36,Amazing Hotel,"I have stayed in this hotel in my last vacation in Barcelona and  I've just loved it, the location was great just close to the Beach and to a big shopping mall diagonal mar Barcelona. we have enjoyed the tasty food I have liked the service at the reception and the restaurant the staff were all friendly and helpful. The best thing was our room which was on a high floor and the view was just amazing overview on the city.",5,2017,01,02
36,Hilton Diagonal Mar,Very good hotel and ideally located to access the main parts of Barcelona. Myself and my wife stayed for 5 days/nights between Christmas and New Year and would highly recommend this hotel. It also has the added benefit of  a large shopping mall with food courts and restaurants close by.,4,2017,01,01
36,My Hotel for Business,"I loved this place. The food, service , and view of the Mediterranean sea was fabulous! The staff were very helpful from the housekeeping staff to the concierge. Did what ever was asked of them. The only issue if you are a tourist and want to see the city you need to stay closer to city center. But, if you want to on the outside of a busy city then the Hilton is for you",5,2016,12,29
36,Can't wait to return!,"I spent the night here following the end of a cruise and absolutely loved my stay here! The hotel is stunning, the rooms are gorgeous, the bed is so comfy, the bathroom was amazing as well! Getting a room that had both city and ocean views was the Best Bonus! The staff was so friendly and helpful. I cannot wait to return!!",5,2016,12,27
36,"Good hotel, good service. Not in the city centre.","Very good hotel, spacious rooms and excellent service all in reception, executive lounge and breakfast.
My room was on the 22nd floor facing the beach and it was lovely waking up to such views.
It is located a bit far out from the city centre but easily reachable by Metro or Tram (around 30min ride).
There is a massive shopping centre outside the hotel with lots of shops and restaurants; very convenient if you arrive late in the evening and think that going to downtown Barcelona is not an option for a quick bite.
Given this, I suppose that this hotel is a more popular destination in the summer months as it has a lovely swimming pool and the beach around the corner.

",5,2016,12,24
36,Solid Hilton Experience,"We spent two nights at the Hilton Diagonal Mar on our arrival to Barcelona. Overall excellent Hilton experience with the reception we expected as Diamond level status holders. We were greeted by name on arrival and immediately upgraded to an executive corner room with spectacular sea and city views. 

The room was large and modern, but lacked power outlets, and was a little rough around the edges... plastic electric conduits ran under the desk with some exposed wires, and along the entry hallway. We were forced to search for places to plug in our electronic devices - not possible to plug in phones next to the bed for example. Some of the wooden furniture was obviously worn from use, but the desk chair and lounger were very nice and very comfortable. The bed was also very comfortable, and we slept like babies. The bathroom had a nice walk in shower and deep tub, with an additional shower. The ceiling of the bathroom was sagging a bit, however, and the metal slats looked like they should soon be replaced. 

Another positive note was the executive lounge. The food and beverage options were extensive during the evening tapas hours. Cava, wines, beers, and spirits all help-yourself. Breakfast was also good, but hot buffet items were limited to eggs and bacon. It was never busy the three times we visited during our stay, although the guest reception in the lounge was only staffed once.

The Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona is a good choice, close to the metro, across from a shopping mall, near the forum and financial district. The tourist areas can be easily reached by metro, and the beach is just two blocks away. The rooms could use some updating and modernizing, but otherwise this was a solid Hilton experience. The staff were welcoming, helpful, and always smiling. Certainly a hotel we would stay at again.",4,2016,12,21
36,"Superb, luxurious, business hotel",Very suited for conference participants as it is less than 5 minutes to the conference centre. The hotel is comfortable and suited for business. The swimming pool looks very luxurious but I didn't use it! As Barcelona downtown was much more interesting. There are also computers in the lobby with free internet that came in handy when I needed to change my car rental details. No complaints!,5,2016,12,20
36,Perfectly Fine Business Hotel,"Stayed here for a week on business and it was a perfectly fine hotel to stay in for business.

The lobby is very nice and home to a (very pricy) bar. It never seemed too lively.

The rooms are big with large bathrooms and plenty of closet space. My room offered a nice view of the Mediterranean Sea as well. It also featured a desk to get some work done. The Wi-Fi was not great anywhere outside of the Lobby. 

I ate at the restaurant once. It was a dull, almost somber, atmosphere. The food was pretty good but very expensive, especially with Barcelona standards.

The hotel is in a good location if you're solely in town for business. You're next to a mall, but not much else of interest is incredibly close. 

One great convenience is that there is a taxi stand right out front.",3,2016,12,19
36,Excellent service,"This is a well run Hilton with all the perks at check in for HH Diamond guests. Executive room with view over the sea, superb Executive Lounge serving snacks and beverages, steady wifi internet. Highly recommend this hotel for business or leisure stays. ",5,2016,12,17
36,Robbed,"Survived Cambodia after many years and within 5 minutes of being in Barcelona - my car was robbed in front of the Hilton.  I've only ever been robbed twice in my time of 30+ years of travel and both times have been in Spain.  

I am not sure if this time occurred while I was speaking with the bell-boy who was trying to convince me to let him park the car and he would validate my car ticket, so I wouldn't have to pay 37EU a night (which I sure he would have wanted no tip for) or when I went into the hotel to check on the reservation. I thought I had pressed the button of the lock on the car - but obviously didn't and within 5 minutes of returning my purse and phone were stollen.  Yes - I know I shouldn't have left them in the car.  I should have checked the door.  I did think I had locked the car. Lesson learned.  

However, what is really upsetting is that the one and only security guard who is a retired policeman was apathetic about assisting me.  I wanted him to rapidly go outside and do a walk around the hotel with someone else, to see if the purse was dumped and contents spilled or at least see if he could see someone running away or knew of where the local theifs hung out.  Snail's pace without a flashlight and condescension were what I received.  The hotel reservation managemtn were telling me to calm down, when all I wanted was some action and assistance, which they preferred to discuss rather than do anything about.  Needless to say purse and contents gone.  But, I was offered a free bottle of water and a free night for parking the car.  I would like to add that I was there under a Gold Member Status.

So, Visa sent out emergency cards to me - they arrived.  The whole hotel staff knew that I was robbed.  They signed for the first card, but neglected to tell me that a parcel was at the hotel for two days.  I only knew that it was there as I had spoken with Visa,  wondering where my card was and they advised me that the card arrived and was signed for, but the other card that arrived the next day was declined to be signed for and sent back.  I was told was that reception didn't recognise my first name (not that last names are important - nor that they signed for the card the previous day) and sent way.   So the card was emergency sent again and arrived the day before I left Barcelona.  7 Days in Barcelona with only 2 of those days with access to my funds.

Only until the second night before leaving, when I was crying in the lounge out of frustration, after finding out the card was there and the other declined. I was offered room service, free phone calls to contact my bank - which I had already done through Skype on my computer and that was it.

The manager, myself and my mother sat down to discuss the issue and the manager spoke as though they had done everything they could to make my stay as best as possible, which was untrue, as no attempt was made to make my stay more easy, until the moment when the card issue came to light.  It was insufficient, inadequate and much too late.  

My feelings about the staff were mostly good, except for the management of reception, hotel and security.  The room was fine. The hotel is too far away from anything. The rooms were not special or fabulous.  And, basically I am appalled at Hilton's lack of protection of their customers.  The management claimed that theft was high in the city and they had problems before.  We asked, them why then if they knew that their customers were robbed at the front door, why do they not have someone protecting them watching their car and their valuables, while they are inside making reservations?  Why do they only have one security guard, who basically refuses to do anything further to assist guests than take a precursory glance.   I question the capability of Hilton to adequately manage high stress situations and make good judgement decisions in order to protect and aid their guests.  Having a conversation with the reception management about calming down, when I needed action - is not an adequate response. I was not overly or unreasonably communicating my need for assistance. There was little need to be asked to calm down and discuss what happened. What was need was a flashlight, security assistance to quickly move and assess, assist and protect - these were not top priority.  

Furthermore, the security guard left me to roam the grounds looking for my purse alone, without a flashlight after a thief.  Good judgement to allow a guest in a new town to wander the unknown streets after a thief - I don't know.  I am an adult and I can do what I wish, but wasn't even asked, assisted, directed or told to be careful.  Just left to go, which I did - as I wandered through the bushes of a dark park at night.  Stupid on my behalf yes - angry yes, wanted my purse back yes, scared no, lucky yes.

I've stayed at many Hiltons and hundreds of hotels, but the lack of customer protection and care from a high quality hotel such as Hilton is really unbelievable and unacceptable.  I do not know if all Hiltons conduct or manage these situations in the same manner, but if they do - I would not feel any safer or cared for by them than any other one star pension that I could stay in for a lot less money.  

However, special note should go out to the upstairs lounge staff girls and the breakfast team who really made my less than happy time, a bit brighter.  They are a credit to professionalism and customer care.",1,2016,12,11
36,good hotel but old,"The facilities are old, but the bed and bath room is large and comfortable. I experienced my door lock broken, toilet broken, faucet kept making noise... Other than this, it is a good hotel. Btw, the breakfast is nice, but it doesn't change menus...",3,2016,12,10
36,Clean and convenient hotel,Hotel is across from the mall which was convenient for quick bites and was also close to metro and around 15 min cab ride to downtown. Rooms were spacious and clean. Staff were pleasant. Food served as part of our meetings were good and had enough variety.,4,2016,12,07
36,Excellent Overall Service,"we had an excellent Arrival and Concierge Services.  Eventhough we arrived early morning, our room was ready.  Housekeeping was awesome and attended to our needs. Definitely will use HIlton Diagonal Barcelona, on my next visit to Barcelona",5,2016,12,06
36,Excellent business like hotel,Good location. Bit far from the action but right opposite a large mall. Also a stone throw away from the beach. An early morning run to the beach front is great. There is a Metro station 5 min away. Breakfast was good and had enough of everything. Small gym. We were there in winter and hence pool was closed.,5,2016,12,05
36,Overall a good hotel,"Very nice large hotel, good comfortable rooms.

Upgraded to a nice room on the higher floors and an early check in was MOST appreciated, service in the exec lounge exceptional all though the offering after a week got a little boring for afternoon snacks.

Breakfast was good with a wide choice.

Location was fab for the beech and Metro, also the shopping centre was opposite the hotel with a great choice of shops and restaurants. Getting from the hotel to the Centre was easily done in 20 minutes.",4,2016,12,05
36,Gem in Diagonal Mar,"Hilton's Diagonal Mar is an excellent place for those that want a convenient conference location and more relaxing location than the hustle and bustle of downtown.  Close to all forms of transportation as well as a wonderful mall across the street in one direction and the beach in another.  Staff is excellent, customer service impeccable, rooms modern and well stocked with amenities, etc.  We have stayed here twice and would definitely stay here again!",5,2016,12,05
36,Fantastic Hotel,"This hotel totally exceeds one's expectations, whether you are staying for business or pleasure (I stayed here for both). Friendly staff, good location, practical room, great views, and amazing facilities.",5,2016,12,04
36,"A regular Hilton, without the Gold perks","I stayed here for almost a week and was not overly impressed with this property.

Upon arrival, I was told that unfortunately the entire Executive floors were booked up (as a Gold member I'm entitled to an upgrade).  Fine, I just wanted to settle in a room.  

I was also told that breakfast runs EUR27, which at the end of the stay was corrected, though.  As a result of this, I only had breakfast at the hotel once, and let me tell you it's not worth that amount by a good stretch: the cheese and cold cuts are clearly on the cheap side, and the coffees I ordered never arrived.  I ended up figuring out I should just get it myself at the machine, which I did not see at the start.  Long story short: if your rate does not include breakfast, take EUR10 and have breakfast outside the hotel - you'll do just fine.

The rooms are ok, smallish, but kept in good order - housecleaning is excellent.  I did not experience any delays with the elevators, but on some nights there were some loud crowds in the lobby, but none of that was heard in the rooms.

In terms of location, this is good for the new business district, up from the Olympic Port, but you're quite removed from the tourist areas and there's no metro station nearby.  There's a new mall across the street with several dining options and a good variety of stores.  Note that if you need to get anywhere outside the immediate surroundings (or the airport), you should take into account that there's a good chance of getting stuck in traffic.

Will I be back?  Not necessarily - possibly if business takes me to this neighborhood.",3,2016,11,27
36,"New Facilities, Great Executive Lounge, east to get to","Everything was new and extremely clean, the views of the beach during the day and cit at night are incredible.  I picked a corner room facing the water on the 22nd floor, it was amazing, modern decor, brand new linens.  The lounge has a great breakfast spread with eggs and jamon, a great espresso machine, and a outdoor Terrence with amazing view of the water and the city.  The hotel is next to the subway, tram, and across the street from a giant mall, which makes shopping very convenient.",4,2016,11,25
36,Good staff,"Hotel was good -nice view however not direct on the beach.

Sea view through two office buildings.

Great location away from city center which I found convenient as it is located next to a nice shopping center.

Nice breakfast.

Rooms needs renovation.",4,2016,11,24
36,My visit 2 nights,"The smell of the carpet or something in the hallway on the 7th floor made me upgrade extra 40€ a night offered me the 10th with sea view very nice. 
From 10th floor and up everything very good except the air con(got fix on the second night in the room)
Gym & sauna I loved.
The breakfast selection one of the best I've seen. 
And all that you need is across the road in the (shops ,restaurants,bars with cheep drinks,clothes and more) One of the workers for some reason wouldn't call a taxi for me and just pointed at where they are witch I thought was rude so I tipped the guy that got my cases and asked me if I wanted one (must of thought I was just there for a drink (IDIOT)

",3,2016,11,23
36,Very Good,Excellent hotel both for a business trip as well as for family vacations. The breakfast is a highlight. The convenience of the shopping just on the other side of the street is also something to consider.,5,2016,11,20
36,Business trip,"Hilton is always a safe choice & this is no different.  Set in the ""business"" end of Barca, I wouldn't stay here if you actually want some typical Barelona culture = food, atmosphere etc.  Room was very clean & bed was massive.  Big window look out to the mountains.  For a conference, this hotel was perfect.  The hotel itself is great. Breakfast buffet is substantial. the staff were more than helpful too. freshly cooked eggs station is great for omelettes or poached eggs. buffet is cooked food + pastries / ham cheese etc.   This area is built for high rise office towers & conference facilities - it could be any where in the world really. I stayed here for business. I would stay in town usually. Outside my window is a shopping mall full of rubbish restaurants that cater for the conference people - Macdonalds etc.",4,2016,11,20
36,"Clean room, great layout and great view","I stayed at this hotel for a conference.  I was upgraded and had a great ocean view.  The room layout is one of the best for a business traveler, with a nice work area and spacious room.  The bathroom had a separate shower from the bath which you don't often see in hotel rooms.",4,2016,11,19
36,Hotel rooms sold out in Barcelona ? Not to worry!,"Hotel rooms sell out fast when there is a special event happening in Barcelona.
Room rates soar when there are  rooms  available at double the cost.
If you did not book ahead, as I did, you can be snake bit!
2 day's before leaving for Barcelona on Monday,  I thought it would be no problem to book a room for a Tuesday 18 Oct.  and Wednesday 19 Oct.. WOW was I wrong! 
 Surely I would find a place to stay by the airport. Wrong again- SOLD OUT!
I tried every internet travel company( and no luck) except for Expedia!
So, when things go South on you, you will find plenty of hotels within 25 miles of Barcelona that are quite reasonable.
Check out the Village of Castelldefels within in 20 minutes of the airport or the sea side  village of Stiges that is a bit further away - 25 minutes by car. 
Through Expedia I found that Hertz had a Mini car rate or $ 75 for  a 2 day rental. Our 2 roll along and 1 - 2 suitor  bag just barley fit in the back seat. No trunk space( I was to tired to go back to the Hertz counter and up grade to a larger car).
  
I selected the 4 Star MELIA  Hotel and Resort in Stiges that had available rooms for 2 nights for 338 Euros total. This included  a free buffet breakfast.
It took me 30 minutes to drive from the airport to this hotel driving  below the 90 KM posted speed limit. It was an easy drive on the express way all the way from the airport  to the turn off to the hotel. ( used google map search). By the way, driving around Spain is not as bad as you might think. No worse then the States).
Stiges is a sea side resort area that is over crowded in the summer months. It encompasses a large area with 1- 5 star 11 - 4 star and at least 10 or more 3 and 2 star hotels.
There is a bus service from Barcelona airport terminal # 1 (runs 1 times per hour to Stiges . Cost is 7 Euros) then another 7 Euro taxi ride  to the MELIA Hotel. The taxi driver at the airport  told me that the cost from Barcelona airport to Stiges will run you 70 Euros.
Cost of a taxi from the airport  to a hotel in Casteffedlls around 40 Euros
The MELIA Hotel and Resort has 307 rooms. A very modern 6 story up scale place to stay. The building is wider then tall. ( you can spot it at a distance after leaving the express way).
Friendly English speaking hotel staff that awaits your arrival like long lost friends!
Our room # 183 was huge! I was impressed with the modern look of this very clean room. Iit had one of the most comfortable King size  bed of any 5 Star hotel I have ever stayed in.
The roomy bath room had a walk in shower with rich looking ceramic flooring and matching counter top.
It is so quite at nights that one could hear a pin drop.
All rooms have small  walk out balconies with table and chairs.
Various views from each room. Better views on the 4th. floor and above.
Saw very few people wandering around during the day.and thought the hotel may be empty of guests. A mob of people showed up each morning for the breakfast buffet. 
( it was refreshing to see women dressed elegantly and men well dressed in sport coats and suits with others in smart casual dress).
Enjoy the floor to ceiling glass view of the swimming pool and the many trees and flowers while you enjoy a wonderful breakfast that is as good as it gets! 
Yes, eggs cooked the way you want them!
For a late night snack , the bar / restaurant stays open until 1:00 AM each night( in case you arrive from the airport late.at night).
Yes, they have room service.
Parking your car will cost you 21 Euros per night.
For FREE parking, you can park your car up and down the  in front of the hotel . Just a short walk back  to the hotel
The only draw back for staying here with out a car is that it is to far to the beach and downtown shops. A city bus runs 2 times per hour ( a short walk away from the hotel).
Regardless of location, I will come back to stay here again.

Happy Travels,

Sydney Paul

36,Decent hotel for business,"The Hilton Diagonal is a decent hotel with everything you'd expect. Rooms are nice and clean, with good views of the city. Gym is ok.

Wifi was ""okay"", air conditioning wasn't fantastic and the elevators take forever to get you anywhere. But these are relatively minor things in an otherwise decent hotel",4,2016,11,13
36,Thanks,"It was pleasure to stay, extremely good sercice. Would like to specially mention Albert from breakfirst and Rick from reception never before met as freiendly and polite people and stuff. Ill remember this alleays",5,2016,11,13

36,What you would expect.  ,"Typical Hilton in the business district. My air con did not work, which was a problem as windows do not open. 
But as it was not too hot temp was ok. 
No free bottled water in room.  
Wifi now free also.

36,Top choice in Barcelona!," Barcelona can be intimidating for a first time visitor due to the hordes of tourists. Therefore, the choice of hotel can be something that ""makes or breaks"" the vacation. With this in mind, I tried to find a hotel which ""checked all of the boxes"": convenient, close to but not in the center of the action, modern, safe and clean with good food options in house or very close by,  and a pool for the kids.  And all this with a good price point. I decided on the Hilton Diagonal Mar and it was a great choice. It is a block from the beach and has a great, happening pool. It is a 15 minute cab ride from most central tourist attractions, yet is located in an open, more quiet and less touristy (and safer) part of town. The rooms are modern and clean and the breakfast buffet is of good quality and ample choice. There is a big mall right across the street with numerous fast food options, upscale dining and a supermarket. The club lounge is great (offerings as well as staff) and Hilton elite status is recognized. And the price point is much less than some of the other 5 star hotels, but the quality is just as good (it is much better than the Barcelona Hilton located right in the center of the tourist action). I was very impressed with this hotel and would have no hesitation in staying here again or recommending it to someone. It is a top choice in Barcelona!",5,2016,11,07
36,Great Hotel at Barcelona,"This Hilton hotel is ideal for both leisure and business travelers. The rooms are clean and tidy, though they should be modernized. The reception and the bar are great and the pool terrace is unique and fantastically beautiful. The proximity to the shopping center is perfect. The staff is super friendly and helpful. Whether reception, service or housekeeping. Top! The breakfast buffet is very good and has a good quality. We like to come back.",4,2016,11,07
36,Bad beds,"The hilton looked very contemporary and clean, but there was a horrible smell in our hallway on the 7the floor. The beds caused me a backache. The most uncomfortable bed Ive ever experienced at a Hilton property. (And I've stayed at many) No breakfast is included, but I realize certain Hilton properties are
Like that. Although I don't understand why there are differences. The staff was awesome from the men handling our luggage to the front desk. They were friendly, knowledgeable and helpful with our questions. ",3,2016,11,06
36,A friendly stay,The staff at the Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona were very helpful even when I was a little crazy.  Their English was universally good and despite my frazzle they stayed calm and helpful while I tried to find money to pay a cab after my cards all locked up.,5,2016,11,04
36,pre-cruise stay,"Cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.  The staff are wonderful, and go out of their way to help.   I booked using my Hilton Honors points, and was upgraded to an Executive room, with access to the Executive Lounge, with complimentary drinks and food.   Taxi to the airport approximately 35 - 40 Euros, even on a Friday evening.  Taxi to the cruise port 30 Euros.   Directly opposite the Diagonal shopping complex, with numerous shops and restaurants.  Wonderful views over the sea, and over the city of Barcelona.   Would always choose to stay here when visiting Barcelona.",5,2016,11,04
36,Great location,"The hotel is a typical Hilton hotel it is clean and tidy with well equipped and good sized rooms. The bar in the lobby is a great place to hang out with friends, but at Eur 10 a pint it is expensive. The hotel is perfect for CCIB",5,2016,11,02
36,"Very nice hotel, great location","I stayed here for a business trip that was intertwined with the conference center next door. The hotel was very clean and the rooms were also clean with no real issues. Being an international hotel, there are no 110v outlets in the room and unlike some U.S. hotels, there are no outlets above the night stands. Therefore if you have clocks, chargers, medical equipment you need to plug in at the bedside, you will need a converter and have to move the night stand forward to get to the plugs near the floor. Not a problem, just a nuisance. Also, if you are using your converter there, you will need 2nd and 3rd ones for your laptop and the plugs near the desk. I hear the hotel desk has some for rent but I didn't need any more than I brought. Also, there's no complementary water and if you're like me, I don't drink tap water. Therefore, you'll need to cart your own water in, or pay the 4 Euros for the ones in the minibar.   The room was clean, as was the bathroom, no mildew and no smells. Both the room and the bathroom had plenty of space and amenities. The housekeeping staff kept everything tidy and replenished.  Overall, I would stay there again when I come back to Barcelona. Just beware, the bar food/drink is pretty pricey. Lots of food options across the street and all over town.",5,2016,11,02
36,Summer European vacation,"The hotel was very clean, rooms very comfortable, but most of all the staff was wonderful.  Location is very good.  The beach is within walking distance.  There is a shopping center across the street.  In addition the metro station is very close by.  We would book there next time we visit Barcelona.",5,2016,11,02
36,Business place,"Not so friendly hotel as it's a business area, and a business hotel with conference meetings. No specific attention. Far from downtown about 20 minutes by bus. Room was fine, clean and spacious as well as the bathroom. End of October the swimming pool was closed unfortunately. Parking service is ok. Staff is friendly and polite.
Diagonal Mar shopping mall in front of the hotel is a big plus with many restaurants and shops, open till 10pm.
International breakfast has a large offer and is very good.
Great view from our room at 10th floor.",4,2016,11,01
36,Comfortable Business Hotel close to Convention Centre,"Not the closest hotel to the conference centre, but within 3 minutes walk. Easy to get taxis to the city centre if required, and short walk to the metro through the Diagonal Mar Shopping Centre. There are nice restaurants in Diagonal Mar as well. Lovely view from the Executive Lounge, and very friendly staff. Only downside was the assistance from Concierge and Front Desk PRIOR to arrival for organisation of airport transfer and other requirements was very slow and disappointing for a hotel of this calibre.",4,2016,11,01
36,Nice Modern Hilton in Barcelona,"I stayed at the Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona for 4 days during my recent visit to Barcelona. I enjoyed my stay very much ! The room was nice with lovely views of the sea. The buffet breakfast had a nice selection of items and the staff were amazingly accommodating. I want to thanks Amelia along with Ellie and Juliano for providing excellent customer service during breakfast.
I'm a Gold Member and was upgraded to the Executive level. They offered a nice assortment of food in the evening and complimentary drinks. The views from the lounge along with the balcony was awesome.
The hotel is not in the city center but there is a hop on bus within a few steps and the metro just around the corner. Taxi's are always available right outside the door.",5,2016,10,31
36,Great hotel,"Visited this October with wife and kids.
Great rooms, great breakfast buffet, staff was very nice
and polite.
At check in the staff helped out with our 2 day plans for touring 
Barcelona, great tips on metro lines and discount tickets.",5,2016,10,31
36,Business hotel - perfect for conferences,"Nice hotel, typical Hilton style. Far from the center but ideal for conferences areas. There is also a huge shopping center next door with any kind of shops/restaurants. The subway is about 10-15 mins walk and takes to the center (Passeig de Gracia) in about 20-25 mins. The airport is quite far too but in light traffic condition it takes about 30-35 mins by taxi.",4,2016,10,30
36,Best of both worlds !,"If like me, it is not your desire to stay in the dust and noise of a downtown hotel, then this Hilton offers you close proximity via metro to downtown, yet is far enough away and with a beach setting to allow you peace and tranquility away from it all. The metro is every two minutes and regular as clockwork, and we had a Hola card for three days making it a very economical way to travel. Taxis are next to the hotel if you feel so inclined, tram and bus not far either. The rooms in this property were large and confortable, with lovely views over the see or city. Close by there are several good eating choices, literally up the stairs across the road. There is the Diagonal shopping mall close by too where you could happily spend half a day !! The breakfast at the hotel is superb, and staff welcoming and helpful. My only gripe would be that bar drinks and food were over priced which was a great shame, as I could not fault this hotel on anything else. Would certainly use this property again when in Barcelona.",5,2016,10,30
36,Pre-cruise stay,"We were three couples in Barcelona for three nights prior to a transatlantic cruise. Check-in was easy. Since we are HHonors gold members, Ilan upgraded us to an executive room. Our rooms were spacious, clean, and the beds were very comfortable. Because of the upgrade, we had free continental breakfast, which included hot items like scrambled eggs and bacon. We also had free happy hour, with complimentary beer, wine, and sparkling wine, as well as heavy appetizers and items such as salmon and roasted potatoes. Breakfast and lunch were so substantial that we only ate lunch out. We will definitely stay at Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona again, and the sooner, the better!",5,2016,10,27
36,Nice stay,"The hotel is a Hilton, so you could expect a very nice staff and a perfect room. It was really nice. The only thing here is that the hotel is really far from the downtown, so we had to take the subway. They took care really well of our luggage for a couple days, thank you for that!",4,2016,10,26
36,Will stay again,My wife and I spent 3 nights here last weekend and we thoroughly enjoyed it. It is located opposite Catalonia's largest shopping mall which has plenty of eateries to suit all budgets.  Our room (1003) was comfortable and spacious. The beds are firm but very comfortable with proper pillows. The standard of service was very good and buffet breakfast offered a great choice of options with pleasant and helpful staff.  Special praise must go to David at the Pistachio bar on the ground floor of the hotel. His standard of service was exceptional. He is a great Ambassador for this Hotel. He was attentive without being intrusive and was pleasant to all customers. I hope to return to this Hotel in the near future. ,5,2016,10,26
36,Overbooked and rudely sent to another hotel,"Visiting on a recce trip to check out suitability of this hotel for a meeting later in year. Tired after a long haul trip and arriving at 10.30 pm to be told that American Airlines staff had had an unscheduled stop and there were no rooms. We had apparently been booked into one similar up the road and given options to walk or take taxi. Am v glad I had 2 male colleagues with me because it was further than we thought and you really don't want to be walking at night as a single female down the street. 
So we get to the other hotel - and they can only put us up for one night not the 2 in our booking ( and the Hilton receptionist had told us that we were better off at this hotel because they could take us for both nights...)
A long and painful argument ensued which culminated in escalation to the Hilton duty manager who ended up paying for us to be upgraded for 2 nights....I did not get to my room until midnight. 
I am a frequent traveller and understand that these things happen - it's how they are dealt with that leaves you with a good or bad impression. My impression of the appalling Hilton receptionist and her attitude has left me highly unlikely to ever stay in a Hilton again! And the fact that it took 1.5 hours to get a begrudging manager finally to agree to an upgrade that quite frankly they should have done in the first place! Also highly unprofessional to name American Airlines and blame them !! ",1,2016,10,26
36,Not Recommended,"this is overrated hotel, not very much a Hilton hotel standards, staff is less friendly, facilities a bit old and room doesn't have minimum needs.  qwertyuiiopasdfghjklzxcvbnmasdfghjklwertyuiozxcvbnmssdfghjklwertyu",2,2016,10,21
36,Holiday in Spain,"Stayed at this hotel recently while on a bus tour of Spain. It's a nice hotel which has a very good breakfast buffet. The rooms are a good size and well kept.
It is across the road from a good shopping centre which has some good value restaurants. The prices for drinks on the pool bar level are very high so I'd give that a miss. 
The wifi was odd, there was a letter on our desk basically saying they don't provide I room wifi & if this is a problem just go down and speak to the staff about it, they just give you a password, bit odd. 
Overall, it's a good hotel in a good location.
",4,2016,10,19
36,Modern hotel with great service,"A great venue for a business stay. Rooms are large and well appointed, baths have sea views and staff could not be more helpful. The food was of a high quality and large bright rooms make meetings enjoyable. I would think this would make a good city break too if you just want to be assured of a high quality stay, without expecting too much real Spanish culture. It's a great option.",5,2016,10,19
36,Incredible hotel!!,"Beautiful property, next to mall AND beach!!  Wonderful staff!  Cannot believe anyone could say anything bad about this place! Wonderful breakfast, great Internet access, and beautiful rooftop pool. Can't wait to go here again!",5,2016,10,16
36,"Nice hotel, Great breakfast","The hotel is nice, Hilton brand, nothing special. The breakfast buffet had a huge selection of tasty food. I don't know about the cost, as we were with a tour, but whatever it cost was worth it. The desk staff was friendly and helpful. 

There is a nice mall across the street, with a large food court on the top level. 

The hotel is not in a particularly central location, but the downtown attractions are easily accessible in a few minutes by Metro. But on the metro and in the stations: Watch for pickpockets!",5,2016,10,15
36,Great hotel,This is a really nice hotel. The rooms and the facilities are well maintained. Great breakfast!!  The only downside was that it was raining all day so we couldn't go to the beach which is about a 10 minute walk or even use the pool as the water was cold. They should really look at having an indoor pool. ,5,2016,10,15
36,"Nice hotel, but crowded restaurant ","The hotel is located about 15min by Metro outside the city center. There are also direct buses and a tram going close to La Sagrada Familia.

The staff was thoroughly very attentive, especially the cool concierge Sheraz and also Mr Abdu Douah.

They made our stay special and felt very welcome.

If there is a chance you can book a room with a view onto the sea, book it. Be aware you can see the sea but the Hilton is in the 2nd row to the beach.",4,2016,10,15
36,If you have to stay near the seaport for a cruise,"A fine Hilton hotel with excellent rooms, service and facilities especially if you need to stay overnight to board a cruise ship at the seaport.  If you have access to the executive rooms, they are well appointed, and the staff at the Del Mar will do their best to be of service to you and your family.  We would look forward to another opportunity to visit at this location.",5,2016,10,14
36,Great views and good location,Picked this out primarily because it was the only Hilton available for that night because of a big medical conference but ended up loving it! Great staff and excellent treatment and definitely got the HHonors Gold Status treatment. Pool looked very inviting as well but didn't get enough time to dive in. ,5,2016,10,14
36,Just Good not Great,This is a nice property located close to the beach and a great mall but was not near as enjoyable as I expected. Beautiful pool but weather did not cooperate during our stay. Location is close to metro line but this hotel is rather far away from anything we wanted to visit. Staff were fairly friendly but not overly helpful. Food was decent. Had higher expectations for the cost of this stay. View was nice from room.,4,2016,10,12
36,No hilton level,The hotel is all right but never on a hilton level. The furniture in the rooms remind you on a hostel. The buffet is on a 3 star level. The staff is friendly. Especially the pool staff. There are bette hotels in barcelona for cheaper prices,2,2016,10,10
36,Clean Hotel,"I stayed at the Hilton Mar for the weekend. Our room (booked with HH points) was located on the 23rd floor and allowed for access to the Execitive Lounge on the 15th floor.
Overall the room was clean and of good size.
Seaview was a bit disapointing as the hotel is located two blocks from the beach and there is a big parking lot and industrial area between the hotel & the beach.
Batroom was rather small, only 1 sink. Shower is not seperate, but in the bath. Not much water out of the shower :( When will Hilton install nice large rain showers???
For breakfast we could choose between Lounge or buffet on 1st floor. We choose the latter as it was included FOC for HH Gold members (cost otherwise 27€ pp). There was a larger selection to choose from. Outdoor sitting is available.
The pool is very good, good size and nice sunbeds!
The location of the hotel is a bit of a minor, as it is not close to the center. Taxi to any of the ""hotspots"" is around 10-12€, so still reasonable.
We did not found many restaurants at walking distance around the hotel, just in the shopping mall across the street.",3,2016,10,10
36,"Very nice property, great outdoor restaurant, very close to beach","We checked in around noon and had to give up our rez for an ocean facing room so we could settle in.  Not a big deal given all day access to the Executive Lounge - which was excellent, except that you could take nothing out.  I guess I can see that, but our special treat is for me to bring my wife breakfast in bed on vacation (yes, i know there's something called Rom Service, but this is more personal).  We had two lunches in the PuroBeach restaurant - outdoors by the pool.  Interestingly, the hostess in the indoor restaurant pushed us toward this option.  Very happy she did.

Very comfortable king-size bed, room and bathroom with small shower, but a bath tub, too.",4,2016,10,08
36,Beware the pool parties at weekends,"Stayed for a week at the end of July, having stayed many times in this Hotel as a HH Gold member, its attributes are well documented and as always my wife and I enjoyed our stay.
However I feel obliged to comment on the following:
I was amazed that a Hotel of this stature could run out of butter in the Restaurant at breakfast for two days of our stay and also tonic water in the Executive lounge for three days. The pool area was fine during the week but from Friday afternoon until Sunday was rowdy, noisy and intimidating with bouncers (security personnel ) at all  entrances to and from the pool area. Accordingly Hotel residents were made to feel like second class citizens.",4,2016,10,07
36,This. Is. It.  Stay here.,"We had the opportunity to stay at this fantastic hotel in May of 2016.  What an amazing experience.  We were in the upper floors and had access to the executive lounge that had unbelievable views of all of Barcelona!  The hotel was modern, clean, super service, a great value!  Love it!!",5,2016,10,06
36,Hilton by the beach,"Very nice Hilton hotel.  2.3 km away from city centre.    All staff at all level exceptional  a lot of security out front.  Beautiful pool    Room super clean well decorated 
Internet exceptional 
Very confortable bed 
2 minutes walk to beach and ocean front 
Big mall across the street with a variety
 Of many great restaurant 
",5,2016,10,06
36,Great Stay After A Long Trip,"After being in the air for over 12 hours, and awake for almost 24, this was a welcome site. Nice modern hotel very close to the Mediterranean and a very modern mall across the street. Our room was a single king with a view of the Med. The room was clean and the bathroom was large. The bathroom contained a tub/shower and the toiletries provided were very good. There was a full buffet breakfast included in our rate. It had a lot of options for breakfast and it was in a large enough area so that finding a table was not a problem. The staff (front desk, bell, and food) were excellent, warm, and inviting. The fact that we spoke little to no Spanish was not a problem. English was prevalent. Did not have time to enjoy the pool as we only stayed one night. Very nice mall across the street with a number of table service restaurants to choose from.",4,2016,10,06
36,Best Bargain on Barcelona's Beach,Rooms were a fraction of the price of those at hotels farther west on the beach.  I had a view of the beach and the  Mediterranean.  Breakfast in the Executive Lounge was great. I was happy with everything except the internet connection.,5,2016,10,06
36,One of the best Hiltons I've stayed in!,"Hotel was incredibly modern and fresh, the rooms were spacious and well laid out, and the view from them was fantastic. The bed I had was great, and was honestly one of the best sleeps I've had.   The internet is decent for a hotel, better than most, I think on the 22nd floor I got around 6mb Down, 1 Up, which isn't too bad for complimentary internet.   The executive lounge was very nicely laid out, great seating and facilities. The food and beverages on offer were brilliant, even laid out a few spirits along with the rest of their drinks. (Shout out to the Mini Pizzas, I think i ate about 15)   The pool is phenomenal, its absolutely beautiful, reminds you of a very luxurious expensive resort somewhere, but its just part of the Hilton right in the city. The pool was great, although a little cold on the months we went (September) Possible could use a heater? The loungers, drinks and food were so comfy and had so many selections. The music however was pretty repetitive and mundane, and you got bored of hearing the same song after sitting around for more than an hour or two, mix up the music!  The staff were fantastic, so warm and friendly, very welcoming and went above and beyond to answer any of my questions, and cater to my needs. Easily the best staff I've had staying in a hotel before.  All in All, this was the best Hilton I think I've ever stayed at, with everything considered. It even trumps some of the 5* ones In London. Will definitely be recommending it and staying there again in the future!",5,2016,10,06
36,Fantastic hotel in a great location,Stayed here for 3 nights which was just not enough to experience everything Barcelona has to offer. Huge shopping centre directly across the road. Close to beach. Swimming pool was amazing. Great breakfast. Huge room with excellent wi fi. Definitely recommend and definitely will stay again. ,5,2016,10,04
36,Diagonal Mar Retreat,"Great hotel is in a quieter section of Barcelona.  Walking distance to the beach.  Puro Beach Club is a lot of fun on weekends but remember that you need to pay extra to get in - a lot of the beautiful locals come to party here so worth the $$$ and it keeps the riff raff out.  Exec Lounge is fantastic - well stocked bar and great eats.  Good internet access.  Room décor is Spanish hip.  Because of the location be prepared to have higher expense allocated to taxis and/or other transportation, but again worth it.",5,2016,10,04
36,Great Pool Bar,It's located a bit outside the centre of Barca but close to a very large shopping centre close to the beach. Many rooms with a view of the ocean. Rooms very nice with everything you need. Beds and pillows were extra comfortable. There is metro station but it's about a 10 minute walk away. You better off taking a taxi as they are not so expensive in Spain. The Puro Pool club is very nice but not cheap. Expect to pay €9 for a beer.,4,2016,10,03
36,Our Room Was Ready at 10:00 AM,"Hilton staff meet us at the airport baggage claim and took us to the hotel.  Upon checking in we found our room was ready which was fantastic after just completing an overnight flight from Newark, NJ.  We were a family of 5 and we were booked by DCL into a family connecting rooms with a view of the sea.  Our rooms were clean and the bed was very comfortable.  Hotel has a great breakfast room and the swimming pool is wonderful.  Bar service is also great.  We stayed two nights and it was a perfect choice.  I will certainly stay here the next time I'm in Barcelona.",5,2016,10,03
36,Great location and views,"Location is excellent if you are looking to relax while in Barcelona. The views to the water are amazing and the view to the city is stunning including ""La Sagrada Familia"". Front Desk clerks could use some training as of how to greet the guests and make them feel welcome. As a Hhonors Diamond member we had to ask for all the questions and service at the lounge was very poor. I recommend the pool area as they have great service there and the drinks are great. The bellman was very pleasant! Good size rooms and if you can get a view of both sides (corner rooms) you will be very happy! 
Room service was worth it. 
Also, there is a shopping mall right across from the hotel and you can have dinner at one of the many places until later (mindnight). Taxis are always available downstairs as well. ",3,2016,10,03
36,Great hotel but expensive,"Stayed for a conference incorporating a weekend. Had a corner room which effectively was a suite. Extremely comfortable bed , great views and a very nice bathroom. Be careful with your mini bar - if you take a bottle out to read the label it automatically appears on your bill. Great pool area apart from the sunbed mattresses which had seen better days and in fact some of them were sodden with water!!! Most of the staff were extremely professional and friendly.  The main downside was the ridiculous price of drinks in the bar.  If you enjoy a drink find somewhere else local to go to because if you use the hotels bars you will get fleeced!! However great location and great views and handy for the beach and the diagonal mar shops.",5,2016,10,02
36,Another excellent stay!,"Stayed here for a night prior to our Disney cruise and was impressed that Hilton honoured a requests for 2 rooms next door to each other and a rollaway bed was already in the room when we arrived.

Great service and great stay, and was pleased the purobeach area was more inviting for our family than last year.

Breakfast fantastic, and great customer service throughout the hotel ",5,2016,10,02
36,"Brilliant stay for our Holiday, will be coming back!","Hotel was fantastic, easily one of the best Hilton's I've stayed in. They upgraded my room to a presidential suite, which was very generous of them. The room itself was fantastic, very spacious and modern, and the views from the 22nd floor were amazing. The bathroom was very clean and sleek, and even had a view from the bathtub.

The main attraction of the hotel would probably be the rooftop pool, it's not on the top floor, its on the first floor. But its absolutely stunning, perfect layout, it has one large and one smaller pool. The bar and food there was great although, very pricey. The sun loungers were very comfy, and there was a lot of shade if needed. It's the best place to just sit and relax in the sun, the views could have been better though, but the staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming. 

The executive lounge was very nice, nicely laid out with enough space. The food on offer was brilliant, they even had a variety of spirits out along with the wine/beer/soft drinks. The lounge also had its own balcony on the 15th floor, which although a bit cold on the evenings from the winds, had very nice views and was comfy and spacious. 

All of the staff were incredibly friendly and fantastic, from the concierge, to the front desk, the guys around the pool and the executive lounge. Definitely one of the friendlier Hilton's I've stayed at.

The location can be viewed as good depending on your preference. It's a little out of the way of the main city attractions and the beaches, a taxi ride of 5-15 euros will take you to most places. But it is very close to the beach, about a 3 minute walk, and it has a large shopping center located just opposite it, the Diagonal Mar. Which has loads of food options, and loads of different shops that are great to look around, and even has a cinema! 

The breakfast wasn't the best, but that's maybe because I was expecting a full English to be as good there as it is in England, but the restaurant its served in has its own terrace with a balcony, and the selection of foods was great.

All in All a fantastic Hotel, in a very nice location, close to the beach and food places. Great rooms, fantastic views, and in budget prices. Will definitely be staying there again!",5,2016,10,02
36,Superb quality for reasonable price,"The hotel has a perfect location close to the city, beach and shopping mall. The rooms have expectational view even from the bed and the bathtub we could see the sea!! Executive floor has a nice terrace overviewing to the whole city. It was our second time in the same hotel in Barcelona, and would not go elsewhere. Can't wait for the next visit in BCN!",5,2016,10,02
36,Barcelona great!,"Hilton Diagonal is an excellent hotel with a great value for your money rate. Our room was beautiful, comfortable, great view and perfectly clean. Don't be put off for the fact that is not in downtown, that is actually a plus, is close to the water and is not that far from La Pedrera, you can get there via the Diagonal avenue in one shot, via taxi, bus or Metro. If you are into walking, jogging, the sea trail all the way to the port is awesome, about 5 miles with great views. The breakfast buffet was nothing like a buffet, more like made to order and it was very rich on every possible breakfast food for all tastes. I had one of the best croissants ever and we just came from Paris where we had the best. The executive lounge could use an upgrade in food selection as well as drinks but it was very good as well, especially the awesome view. Come enjoy this hotel with confidence. It also has a good shopping mall just in front of it that will not disappoint, is a B level one but good dining and decent shops.",5,2016,09,30
36,Poor WiFi and breakfast,Do not expect to use the WiFi in the room if you are above level 9. It does not work. I needed to go down to the lobby to have access that did not disconnect all the time. Breakfast is really poor compared to other Hilton and absolutelt not worth the money,3,2016,09,29
36,Outstanding hotel and lovely staff ,"I had a meal in the indigo restaurant. We was seated by David the food and beverage supervisor, he was very helpful, very knowledgable, made our stay, with his recommendations and his really good customer service. We couldn't of asked for better service off him. 

The hotel it's self is beautiful and in a great location. Would definitely recommend as a couples holiday. ",5,2016,09,28
36,Family Trip with 6 weeks old baby,"Nice hotel where also a young family can relax. A nice relaxation room and a lot of shadow at Puro Beach for the baby and good food. Was only two days but had the feeling we had a complete weekend. In case there is bad weather, you can visit the shopping mall across the street. Only minus point is that we had to ask several times for a cup of coffee or cocoa during breakfast. Nobody informed us that coffee is self service and cocoa is being served. This could be better communicated when you arrive at restaurant for breakfast.",5,2016,09,27
36,Comfortable hotel for business,"Handily placed hotel, just opposite the Diagonal Mar shopping mall.  The rooms were nice and clean as well as spacious and well equipped.  All in all a good place to stay.  Breakfast expensive for what it is though.  Go out into Barcelona and get better for cheaper.  ",4,2016,09,27
36,Ab Fab,"This hotel is great ! Everybody is very friendly ! The entire staff is contributing to the ""we make it right"" policy . One night we had dinner at the restaurant and I would like to thank our waiter David for all of his efforts and his kindnes. You could see it was his passion! He even lend his jacket to a client because it was to cold outside... I have never seen this before ! Good job David ! Keep on doing what you're doing ! We will be back !",5,2016,09,27
36,Perfect location - amazing view of the sea,This hotel was a great location for rest and relaxation following our 7 day cruise. The location has modern decor with amazing views of city or sea. The pool is beautiful. The location is close Las Ramblas and other city attractions. ,4,2016,09,26
36,Very relaxing,"Very close to conference centre, beach and metro links.  
Spacious room which was kept impeccably clean, good facilities.
Good variety of breakfast choices, but no mimosas unlike Barcelo hotel (10 mins away).
Helpful and friendly staff.
Pool area is a bit TOWIE but otherwise lovely.",5,2016,09,26
36,Barcelona Hospitality,Checked in after being on an overnight flight and was able to go to our room straightaway. Rooms are large and comfortable. Ate at their restaurant twice and loved the food especially their tapas and lamb shank. Breakfast buffet is one of the best I have had a hotel. Pool area was clean and convenient. Close to the beach and big shopping centre across the road. Thank you to all the staff especially the restaurant and bar staff for making our stay enjoyable.,4,2016,09,25
36,Very modern conference oriented hotel,"We stayed here after a cruise. Even though this hotel was the recommended hotel to stay at before and after the cruise and the hotel new that cruise guests would be arriving early in the morning there were no rooms available unless we paid for a upgrade. We did but as far as we are concerned the room was a downgrade. Instead of the king bed they took two twins and tied them together. One of us got to sleep on the crack the next 3 nights. This is not as tourist friendly nor is the locale as close to the heart of Barcelona and therefore you either use the hop on hop off bus, the metro, or taxi to get to just about anywhere. As just about anywhere good restaurants abound. There is a huge modern mall across the street with a Walmart type grocery everything store buried way down in the ground floor. On Sunday's the only floor open is the food floor - and it is not the US food court these are white tablecloth restaurants.",3,2016,09,25
36,Stunning Hotel,"Fabulous hotel that gives you the best of both worlds in Barcelona.  Well linked by the metro to the main city centre, right by the beach and with a fabulously trendy and luxurious pool area for a day of relaxation, which is great to be able to do to break up the days of walking with the kids.
Breakfast is outstanding and the staff are great.  We did not eat in the restaurant on the night but any food we saw looked very good.  I thought €10 for a pint of lager was a little steep however.
We had exec access which is definitely worth the upgrade, as the food on offer and views in the exec lounge are superb.
The pool is small but wonderfully cool in the August heat,  Poolside food is good and the service second to none.  No towels to reserve sunbeds here, you show up and give your room number and are taken to a bed.  That is how it should be.
Right opposite a great shopping centre if you feel the need.  One word of advice, the pool part they hold for anyone prepared to pay high enough on Saturdays and Sundays is rather lively (open to the public).  Familys are put the more traditional sunbeds without matresses over the back area ""out of the way"".  I can see why they hold them as the money spent on champagne alone is impressive to say the least, with sunbed reservations costing in the thousands.  For familys though, once you have had a nose around, these are the days to go out on visits to the city.
Great hotel, thoroughly recommended.",5,2016,09,25
36,Barcelona trip,"Great hotel walk to beach 1 block across street huge underground mall hop on off bus tours 1 block close to cruise ship port modern clean rooms with helpful staff that speak english.
Plenty of cabs and rail
",5,2016,09,23
36,Great hotel and staff,Great hotel and staff.   Accommodations modern and very nice.   Staff exceptionally friendly and helpful.  Food very fresh and good.    Beware spa/massage area next to loud pool and bar area pumping club music.  Close to large shopping mall and beach.,5,2016,09,23
36,"Great location, excellent service","We have stayed at this beautiful hotel directly by the sea and we have enjoyed it very much. The staff at the Executive Lounge, especially Maria was very nice. And also Borja and Christiano from the front desk were extremely helpful and always smiling. We will be back. Thank you!",5,2016,09,22
36,Too much loud music,"We booked here expecting to get the standard Hilton experience with the benefit of a pool and close to the beach.

The hotel and room design was exactly as expected, but we were not aware that the hotel is trialling a new concept focusing on the concept of a beach party.

This meant that every Saturday night there is a party around the pool with very loud music which we could hear on 14th floor in a room designated as a quiet room.  During the other periods the music around the pool is not the background music you might expect, but again loud enough to prevent any peaceful relaxation.  I was glad I had my noise cancelling headset to reduce the sounds.

On the positive side when we complained the management did all they reasonable could without actually stopping the noise, so we were grateful for that.  This was when it was explained to us that they were trialling this new concept ( they were only the second hotel in the chain to trial it)",3,2016,09,22
36,"Rude, judgemental staff - do NOT book the pool party","I had one of the worst customer service experiences of my life here - not something you would expect from a Hilton. My boyfriend and I booked tickets to the pool party. When we arrived, we showed our tickets and were directed to the pool area. We sat down on some sunbeds and ordered some drinks, only to be told minutes later that we had to move. We chose some other sunbeds and got comfortable, only to be told we had to move again. The waiting staff told us that the sunbeds we were sitting on actually cost 500 Euros to book (really!? They weren't THAT good, they were dirty for a start). Quite frustrated and embarrassed by this point (as we had paid for tickets for the pool party, and we had to keep moving spots), we asked where we were ""allowed"" to sit. They directed us away from the pool area to the hotel bar, where you couldn't even hear the music - let alone see the pool. We found this completely bizarre and unacceptable, seeing as though we had paid for pool party tickets. What made this experience all the worse is that when we questioned why we were repeatedly being moved, the waiter looked us up and down, pointed at the other guests sitting on the sunbeds and simply said ""because they buy bottles"". So basically we were judged by a waiter! Ha. We walked out there and then and took our money elsewhere. Will not be returning to a Hilton and would strongly advise you stay away from this one in particular if you want a positive experience.",1,2016,09,21
36,"Quiet, Relaxing Finish to a Barcelona/Cote D'Azure vacation","I chose this hotel as the car rental company (Sixt) had an office in this hotel.  It made it convenient to pick up a car (and drive to the south of France after spending a week in a hotel in Barcelona's Gothic centre).  I dropped off the car here and took a taxi the next day to the airport.  I didn't want the stress of driving the car back to the denser more hectic older part of the city.  It is still only 20 minutes to the airport with a quick entry to the highway.

The hotel is a little on the pricey side but it is very clean, spacious and modern.  Check-in/out were quick, service was courteous and communication excellent.  The beach is right behind the hotel while having all the conveniences of a modern city.  Decent places to eat with some variety.

I wouldn't use this hotel a primary base to tour Barcelona but for business or transit purposes it is idea.",4,2016,09,20
36,Disappointed in the Executive Level,"Booked a room because I am a Hilton Member.  Spent the extra to get the club level because I like having the perks of snacks and cocktails.  Was very disappointed when at 5 I stopped by to have a glass of wine.  I was told that the bar was only open from   
6 to 8.  There were not a snack to be found either.  I have always enjoyed the club level at Marriott but was very disappointed with this Hiltons Executive Level.  Do not bother....not worth the money.
",3,2016,09,20
36,First time to Spain,"The hotel is truly business class. Clean, functioning and the best part, near the beach! Shopping mall opposite will provide some shopping relief, the antique parts of Barcelona is truly beautiful too! Don't forget the church if you are like me, into old churches. Enjoy the photos! And oh ya, the food, go for the Porto Olympico area. Take your pick ! Seafood! ",5,2016,09,19
36,"Clean, good amenities, keen pricing - families on a budget","It was well equipped, easy to get to, comfortable beds and spacious rooms felt bright and airy. well priced for our small family party of 3. Reliable choice in Barcelona which can be very pricey, but you must be prepared to walk/public transport to the main areas etc.",3,2016,09,18
36,Great location and awesome staff,"The staff was really nice and helpful. Location was very convenient, lots of restaurants near by, mall across the street and beach is not too far away... I would definitely come back and recommend this hotel.",4,2016,09,16
36,Great place to stay,"The hilton diagonal mar Barcelona is a great place to stay especially if the goal of your visit is business as it is very close to the CCIB , spent there 4 nights at an executive room with lounge access , Being a Hilton gold member extras like early check in , late check out, online check in and complimentary water bottles were excellent additions , the view was great and just opposite the diagonal mar shopping mall, rooms may be small but not a big issue , Wifi was also complimentary and was good.
Breakfast was good and had diner also once in the first floor restaurant.
Overall meets expectations if you found a good price go for it.",5,2016,09,15
36,"Noisy, but comfortable","Stayed here two nights for a meeting in September 2016.  Super friendly service, prompt and efficient.  The room was large and comfortable.  The air conditiioning was not great, and did not appear to respond to the flimsy thermostat.  The shower leaked, and the wooden molding was rotting and coming off the wall.  The water pressure wasn't great and took forever to get warm.  The room smelled of cigarette smoke after it was cleaned (I suspect the cleaning staff smokes and carries the smell in on their clothing)--very unpleasant.  Hilton could do well by putting outlets near the beds for charging phones and tablets.  Room service was prompt and the food was good.  There are no vending machines or sundry shop.  A 200 ml bottle of soda was a whopping 6 euros!!",4,2016,09,15
36,Briliant!,"Fantastic loction, view, staff, cuisine, pool. Hotel is really unique, I was delighted firstly with the very professional service at a reception desk. At the very first view as ""usual Hilton"" (if there is even such a category :-)) but I see there this one is even better. Really recommend.",5,2016,09,13
36,Nothing special and too far from historic Barcelona,"I spend four nights in this hotel recently for a conference at the adjacent conference center.  The hotel itself is a standard Hilton.  Typical size and cleanliness of rooms.  One thing to note, the ice machines are located adjacent to the elevator on each floor, so noise may be an issue if your room is near the elevator.  The staff were all very pleasant and spoke fluent English.  The buffet breakfast was included in my room rate and contained a very broad range of foods and beverages.  The problem is that this hotel is too far from the center of the city to be easily accessible by tourists.  The area is a bit modern urban and outside of the huge mall across the street, not very pretty or inviting.  There are no nice restaurants outside the mall within easy walking distance.  If you are traveling to Barcelona for history and culture, this is not the place for you.  There is a subway station a couple of blocks from the hotel.  It has one line - the 4 line that goes into the historic area of the city but perhaps not convenient to many sights.  Finally, upon checkout, the clerk insisted on reading aloud everything that had been consumed from the minibar during my stay.  As there were many others around and checking out, I would have preferred that she not do this and told her it wasn't necessary, however she did not pause until she had finished the list.",3,2016,09,12
36,"Stellar service, lousy internet","I stayed here for 6 nights in late Aug/early Sept. The enthusiasm and helpfulness of the front-desk staff was incredible. The property is beautiful and well located very near a subway line that goes directly into town, the convention center, and the beach for swimming in the Mediterranean. The views of the city from my room on the 11th floor were outstanding - much nicer than the view of the water.

The breakfast was expensive but well worth it - everything was fresh and beautifully presented and the variety of offerings was exceptional. Being able to dine outside on the balcony was an extra treat.

My only complaint (other than a shower stall with a non-working drain and a door latch that fell off!) is that the internet service in the rooms was non-functioning. As a hilton honors program member I was supposed to get free internet but it did not work one single day. It was so frustrating wasting so much time on the phone working with IT to get it to function, I just gave up and carried my computer and phone to the lobby, where wifi worked just fine. Also, the computers in the lobby were very iffy.... best to bring your own.

For people who do not need wifi, the HIlton Diagonal Mar will offer a memorable stay in Barcelona.",4,2016,09,12
36,Needs more cleaning,They need to put some odor fragrance on the hallway to the rooms as well as in the rooms... The hallway of the floor I've stayed  smelled like fish. And the lift always had like the greasy residue on the mirror.  ,2,2016,09,12
36,Hilton Barcelona Diagonal Mar,"Very good location and good quality hotel. Breakfast in the restaurant is very good. Executive lounge has a fantastic terrace overlooking the city, although the air conditioning inside the lounge is quite ineffective. I found the internet connection in the room to be poor, but better in the lobby. Staff and service is of the usual high quality associated with Hilton.   The pool area has been franchised out sine we visited 2 years ago and it gives the feeling that hotel guests are ""2nd class citizens"" to the hoards of young pool party revellers.  That said, it is a great hotel and we will definitely be back!",4,2016,09,11
36,Comfortable,"The hotel is convenient and comfortable, and decently priced. The pool area is nice, breakfast average, and the mall right in front of the hotel has very good restaurants and shops. The only downside is that it is on one end of Barcelona, and decently far from the heart of the city.",4,2016,09,11
36,Amazing hotel Great staff,"Great place. close to the  beach and city center. Amazing staff they deliver a great service. thank vannessa, toni,maria, claudia,elisa, and all the staff. Indigo restaurant great quality and service for dinner time.",5,2016,09,10
36,Hilton Barcelona,Clean friendly hotel Slightly outside city centre but close to tram and metro stations.  Great roof top pool area.  We made use of Hilton exec club which provides evening drinks and snacks whilst offering great views over city.,4,2016,09,10
36,5 Stars holidays,Enjoyed a 5 stars holidays week end in one of the  best Hotel in Europe....Barcelona is a great city but the Hilton Diagonal Mar is a pearl in that beautiful city. Can't wait to be back soon. Thank you for a great stay Hilton,5,2016,09,09
36,6 nights Hilton Diagonal Mar,"Just back from 6 night sat the Hilton Diagonal Mar, It's the 5th time I've stayed there and it's as good now as the first time I stayed over 5 years ago.
It was a short break with my wife, we originally booked a room on the 23rd floor but when we arrived at 2pm we were told our room wouldn't be ready until 4pm. The reception was really good and found us a room on the 15th floor which was available immediately. This was good as the Executive Lounge is on the same floor :)
The room was good size with a separate shower and a bath in the bathroom. The cleaners did a good job each day making everything spick and span.
Executive Lounge was also good with plenty of Cava, Wine, Beer and Spirits (serve yourself) flowing from 6pm to 8pm. Breakfast in the lounge was great but there is no afternoon tea and the canapés/food in the evening isn't great. There is an outside terrance with great views from 15th floor across Barcelona and to the beach. The Gaudi Cathedral can be seen in the distance.
The Pool area is excellent. They have a pool party on Saturdays and Sundays which attract a young crowd and provides plenty of people watching. Only downside is most of the poolside loungers are reserved/sold off to the pool party crowd. However, there is plenty of room and if you really wanted to be poolside you can always pay. During the week its much more relaxed and getting a poolside lounger is pretty easy.
We went down one evening and had cocktails at the bar in the pool area and found it to be excellent.
We didn't eat in the hotel, preferring to eat out instead. There are many restaurants  and food outlets across the road in the shopping centre. A number of these are on a large terrace area were local and holiday people walked about and relaxed.
Taxis are plentiful for getting into the centre, alternatively you can get a tram and then a metro to get to the heart of Las Rambles.
We like to walk and it took us about 90 mins from the hotel to the Hard Rock Cafe at the top to Las Rambles.  Open Bus tours also operate from right outside the hotel.
The Beach is about 200 meters from the hotel and walking along the promenade there are many restaurants and beach bars to stop at. It takes about 60 mins to walk the whole way down the promenade.
Overall the hotel is a great location and an excellent standard, I'll definitely be going back for another visit next year.",5,2016,09,08
36,Purobeach Charges,"We have just returned from a 4 night visit to the Hilton, we last visited 2 years ago and everything was of the same high standard. My only problem is the lack of information on the Hotel's website regarding Purobeach. The pool area has been taken over by a private company but nowhere on the Hotel's website does it mention having to reserve sunbeds and being charged. Earlier in the year I had read a review about this on Tripadvisor and emailed Hilton Honors to ask them to clarify the situation. I received a reply stating that as far as they were aware there was no charge for the sunbeds or use of the pool. When I went down to the pool on Friday afternoon the first question I was asked was have you reserved a bed and when I replied no I was asked to pay 20 Euro. I refused and explained about the email from Hilton Honors so they waived the charge, but I had to reserve my sunbed for each day. At no time was it pointed out to me that the sunbeds at the back of the pool area were for Hilton guests with no charges. It was only another guest who pointed this out, although on the Purobeach charge card it still showed 20 euros for Hilton guests. All very confusing. Hilton would need to clarify how Purobeach works on the Hotels website. On Saturday and Sunday there were pool parties with loud music and crowded with young people consuming large amounts of alcohol, no peace or quiet. This is really the only negative, when I went to the pool on Monday it was really only Hotel guests. Iam still not sure regarding the charges and how it works for guests.",4,2016,09,08
36,Overall very good hotel!,"I liked rooms, though a little bit out of date. Breakfast and meals are good. the rooms are well tided and cleaned. staff is pleasent and helpfull. Did not have quite good expariance with the swimming pool area, choosing the place to lie on is not free especially on Saturday/Sundays. ",4,2016,09,08
36,Excellent,Stayed in executive room. The room size for a city was great plus the bed very comfortable. The few staff we spoke to were all very pleasant. The pool area is franchised (puro beach) so that offers a few challenges eg at weekends they want to stick hotel guests up the back on basic sun loungers as they sell the other comfortable beds to pre paying visitors. The cost of food and drink around pool is also pricey. They hand out different menus at the weekend - a bottle of white wine costs 35€ during week but 60€ at weekend.......anyway overall my stay was excellent and I would definitely stay at this hotel if I return to Barcelona.,5,2016,09,08
36,"Nice building, great service staff, shameful restaurant food","Close to Barcelona beaches, nearest which you can walk to in 10 min.
Friendly helpful service staff
Food apart from breakfast is awful, and terrible value. Compare with Hilton Lisle or Hilton Gatwick, lovely restaurant food, good value. These hotels can't rest on the laurels of their location like hilton diagonal Mar, so have to be good in other ways.
The Exec lounge is very well designed. Poor aircon, in the lounge but otherwise ok.
Don't pay for the marketed ""Purobeach Experience"". It's an expensive rip off of a handful of lounge chairs round the hotel pool, with some naff loud music to destroy your afternoon peace in the sun and and sunset. There is no beach, no ""experience"", and certainly no sand!
Food at all of this Hilton's restaurants was bad. Find good restaurants outside on tripadvisor.
Try food at Hilton Gatwick, and then compare to this... Note - Hilton Gatwick has good food, inattentive service. If only the best of the two could be merged!
Overall, the staff at Hilton Diagonal Mar are very friendly, nice and helpful, but they are struggling to sell a bad product. (Bad food, poolside lounge rip off). I did get a free cooked fly in my Purobeach Dinner ""Experience"", but decided to reject it. The steak I had as an alternate was supposed to be medium, but was not cooked all the way through, yuck!  I left the raw bits behind.

Eat out!

",3,2016,09,07
36,Nice hotel but staff not so helpful,"Spent a night there on a business trip, the room was good, nice view and good comfort. The hotel looks good but is missing a bit of character. Staff welcoming but not very helpful, I would not have known about breakfast and swimming pool if I did not ask about it on my arrival at the front desk, I literally just get the key and a smile there! By the swimming pool I had to go and ask for a towel as no one greats me on my arrival. Would still go back there as overall I had a nice time.",4,2016,09,07
36,"Great hotel, great service, not in the center of town","This is a lovely, modern hotel with all the amenities, and an exceptionally friendly and helpful staff.  It is just a few blocks from the beach (as well as a huge shopping mall) and next to the Convention Center if you are here for a conference.  It is NOT in the center of things however--it's a 3 mile walk or a 12 Euro taxi to the Gothic District for example.  However, it is right around the corner from the city' excellent subway system and this line goes straight into the heart of things without changing trains. We bought one of those T10 tickets good for ten rides and that was very fast and handy.  If you are a Hilton honors member with enough points or Gold status, (although I'm only Silver but somehow got access) you will have access to the fabulous Executive Lounge on the 15th floor that serves free breakfast and free drinks and snacks during their Happy Hour that goes from 6-8.  It overlooks the city and the sea and is absolutely lovely.  The advantage of not being in the heart of things is that the hotel is very quiet and restful, and housekeeping does not come banging around the halls in the early hours.  The Wifi can be a little funky at times and the bar (compared to a little place around the corner) is preposterously expensive (10 euros for 2 coffees, 50 euros for three gin and tonics!) but highly recommended.",5,2016,09,06
36,Very good,"While still at the hotel , I have to say that if far from city center , the facilities , and the staff is up to the highest standards. 
Pretty hotel , clean , with a nice lounge with outdoor sitting , excellent pool ( Puro beach ) and specially the staff at this hotel is outstanding. 
Starting with the warm and professional check in ( Toni ) continuing with Maria at the executive lounge, Andrea at the breakfast , etc   ALL the staff smiling and ready to help. 
Rooms are big and have an spectacular view   
Highly recommended ",5,2016,09,06
36,Excellent for business ,"Very very near the conventional center,
Rooms have excellent view,
Just across the street u can find a shopping mall with all shops,restaurants and cafes.
Hotel staff are very friendly.
U can easily get a taxi near the hotel.",4,2016,09,06
36,Very good,"If you have hhonors benefits the lounge is great. 
The small gym is packed with cardio equipment, some weights but the air conditioner is not up to the task - be prepared to sweat. 
Location opposite mall and by cruise ship port is good and seemed safe enough. 
Check in seemed to double as converge desk so we waited for about 10 mins to check in despite no people ahead of us (but both people occupied)",4,2016,09,05
36,Perfect stay,Basically the hotel is 5 minutes from golden beach. Massive shopping centre with 100 places to eat and ginormous supermarket just across the road. T10 ticket is a must gets you on trams buses and metro.  Visited Barcelona Zoo which is 15 minutes away by tram . Great stay . The only down side I told at the  reception that we came to their hotel on purpose of celebrating my sons  birthday as he turned 15 while we were there     but no even a note through the door... oh well .,4,2016,09,05
36,"Enjoyable stay, good venue and excellent staff","We stayed nearly 1 week toowards the end of August and it was really a very enjoyable stay. The ample room at the 17th floor had a very nice view over Barcelona (I hesitated between this city view and the sea view and I do not regret the choice). A first word to the staff - always available, showing genuine care for the client - an asset in this hotel. The hotel itself is quite nice despite its huge size, a bit far away from the city center (30 mins by public transport) but only a few meters from the beach. The swimming pool at the roof of the 2nd floor is quite a nice place (maybe a bit crowded on week-ends) where you can enjoy a drink or have lunch dinner - so if you go there do not miss the ""Purobeach"". We also tried the Indigo restaurant at the first floor - the first time as a couple then with some friends and we were very pleasantly surprised. It debunks the myth of ""hotel cuisine"" - elegant, well prepared, sohisticated as needed - the codfish was excellent as well as the sea bass (""lubina""), the beef tenderloin (""solomillo"") was very well cooked and our friends also praised the ""entrecôte"". 
The check-in and check-out were  carried out efficiently requiring little time - once again the staff was very helpful bringing all the lugage and putting it in the car. There is car park in the hotel - a bit pricey but very convenient and safe.
A really nice place that honours the Hilton tradition and I clearly recommend for those wishing to enjoy the sea side of Barcelona",4,2016,09,03
36,A great escape from touristy crowd,"Stayed here during our family trip to Barcelona in September. It is a bit off from the tourist attractions however very close to a subway stop on yellow line that goes to both ends of la rambla. After hanging out in crowded attractions, felt so good to cool down here. Great breakfast buffet, pool is run by puro club but guest could use for free. Bit crowded with 20 something group on weekends due to parties! There is a mall across with some more meal choices. ",5,2016,09,03
36,Great hotel great staff,Stayed here for 10 nights from 20th of August. Our room a junior corner suite was well appointed ant comfortable. The pool area is superb and the staff very helpful. We had access to the executive lounge which is situated on the 15th floor and commands wonderful views of both the Mediterranean and the City. A wide variety of drinks are available and the tapas in the early evening are also a plus. Will return again either at Christmas time or for our summer holidays next August.,5,2016,09,03
36,"Weird service, interesting location","This hotel is far from downtown-- but only a 15 minute metro ride away.  It is 3 minute walk from a beach [though I find it hard to go to the beach in Barcelona since the city is so beguiling].
Service was weird.  First, everyone at breakfast restaurant was incredibly nice.  Perfect service.
Reception service was sketch.  First there was nobody at reception desk when we got there at night.  Then the guy who checked us in gave us some confusing reason as to why we could not have access to executive lounge despite our Honors status.  
Then when we asked for late check in, the woman very rudely responded--""you will have to check with us tomorrow after 9 a.m.!""  It was very rude tone-- and again, not in keeping with our Hilton frequent stay privileges...  we just let it go but we thing the reception people need better training.
Also we told ocean views were only available for smaller rooms-- so WAIT we paid a large sum of money for a large room that prevented us from ocean view?  that makes no sense!!!",4,2016,09,03
36,Great pool ,The rooms are okay and the service is pretty good but the pool area is excellent and very chic. They have a wild party on Saturdays and it's really busy on weekends so if you're trying to avoid the pool party scene maybe stay somewhere else. Overall much better than I expected ,3,2016,09,03
36,"Nice room, great pool, would skip the restaurants","The hotel is very nice overall.  It's located just down the street from the beach and right next to the conference center and mall.  It's a bit of a ways out of town, but we used the metro to get around without any trouble.  The restaurants weren't very good and the room showed a bit of wear.  The pool area is young and vibrant",4,2016,09,02
36,Solid hotel with an unexpected plus: Puro Beach!,"This is as good a Hilton as you'll find anywhere, but it has one feature that lifts it above the norm: a very hip and elegant pool deck which bills itself as Puro Beach.  It's sponsored by Moet & Chandon champagne, and features cabana-like beds for daylong lounging, nice chaises for sunning, an excellent sound system with upbeat, sophisticated instrumental and percussion music, waiter service for champagne, drinks, smoothies and light meals and snacks and a full-service spa.  It is an incredibly cool venue.  There's also a great Executive Lounge on the 15th floor with an outside terrace for a good no-charge breakfast which you'll want to be sure is included with your selected room and rate type.",5,2016,09,01
36,Family get together,"Rooms good. Breakfast good. However, the introduction of pool parties rendered family or individual use of swimming pool area nigh on impossible. Go in winter when presumably pool parties are not scheduled and then you may enjoy this hotel. For family use it is a non starter in the summer months.",3,2016,08,31
36,Amazing view from out corner room on the upper floors,"We stayed for a night before and after a cruise from Barcelona. I made a mistake and booked what I thought was at the bottom of Las Ramblas turns out its at the bottom of Rambla de Prim. DOH! 
We are Hilton loyalty card members and got a high room on the corner overlooking the city, even had a panoramic view from the bath! This is not in the centre and is about 15 minutes cab ride to Las Ramblas. There is a shopping mall opposite with some good food outlets. 
I would say this is more a conference hotel. Its normal Hilton standard and very good but if you are looking to be in the thick of the action this is not the one you need.",4,2016,08,30
36,Disappointing ,"This hotel is right next to the convention center and that convenience is its saving grace. All else is rather mediocre. The hotel is not anywhere near a useable beach (the coastline 5 mins away is a concrete jungle). The gym has only 3 treadmills in a small room - don't even provide bottled water! Internet service was spotty and slow, and went offline for 2 hrs while I was there. As a Hilton gold member, I was given the princely reward of two bottles of water (apparently the Exec lounge was too busy with much more important people to allow mere minions like me access). Indigo restaurant grossly overpriced, and delivered bland food. Small pool, with lots of efforts to upsell the pool services. Staff doing the bare minimum. Hotel overall seems to have lost its way, and needs injection of energy from someone who cares about their guests. ",2,2016,08,30
36,Solid 3.5 star property,"Stayed at the Hilton Diagonal Mar as part of a conference next door.  On the positive side, the executive rooms are spacious, nicely furnished in wood and the bathroom has reasonable amenities.  The shower is a bit weak, but this is Spain.  The pool area is lovely with lots of chaise lounges and a staff eager to sell drinks and make you comfortable.  The executive lounge is on the 15th floor, but its breakfast has much less choices than in the restaurant.  The rooms were warm and it took a while for the air conditioning to cool down the room.  However, once cool it was comfortable.  Beds are fine.  On the negative side, there is no concierge to speak of (reception staff do double duty), no one in front to hail taxis and at times they seem understaffed or overwhelmed.",4,2016,08,29
36,Great Hilton by the beach,"If you are looking to visit Barcelona and stay near the beach, then this is a great Hilton. It's not in the Barceloneta beach area or in a very touristy area so be prepared to travel to get into the city center. 

We were able to sit in the daybeds by the pool at the puro beach club. It was very relaxing from weds to Saturday morning. The executive lounge also had a great happy hour with beautiful views. I thought it was a good mix between being near the beach and having access to the city.",5,2016,08,29
36,Great hotel near the beach,"This hilton is great situated a bit out of the centre but close to the beach and a metro station. Large well equiped rooms with most of them a seaview. The gym is too small though and most of the equipment should be renewed. The pool is great but be aware that in the summer weekend they throw pool parties for non recidents which is not what i expect from a hilton. Too many people in the pool area and i ln the hotel itself, not nice if you expect a quiet weekend away! ",4,2016,08,29
36,Customer Service at it poorest,"Stayed the second time at the Hilton Diagonal Mar and this might be it. Last year we paid the regular room rate and as a HHonors Gold member we got ignored mostly. No upgrade, no recognition, Hilton was too busy with large groups.

This year I paid through a travel agent for 3 nights as it was almost 50% less than the rate on the Hilton web-site - so much about the Best Price Guarantee by Hilton - and it was nothing different. 

I know that Hilton has changed their policy, so if you do not book through their web-site there are no points, but that they completely ignore the status is just ridiculous and honestly I believe is going to hurt them in the future. I did like Hilton in the past, so I am Gold and it was always my favorite Hotel chain choice, but this has meanwhile changed. Hilton is rather on the bottom of my list nowadays, this Hilton for sure. 

Check in rather stressful, lot's of people complaining, long queues. Lady at check-in hardly talked to me and handed me room key with no further information. Well, guess I had checked in online the day before. HHonors Gold, forget about. 

The worse was the breakfast. Very nice Lady at the checkin and she brought me to my table. From there on I was basically left alone and that was for 2 mornings out of 3. No coffee offered, no Orange Juice, dirty table never cleaned while I was at the table. I finally got over it and got myself served with coffee and OJ, which was not a big deal. It was just annoying as most of the staff just seemed to be busy talking than to look after the guests. Definitely not a pleasant experience. 

I stayed on the 10th floor and out of 4 elevators only 3 were working most of the 3 days. I spend quite an amount of time to wait for the elevators and at certain times the elevators were packed that no further guest could get on. 10 to 15 minutes to wait for an elevator feels like an hour literally and is unacceptable.

I asked for a late check out and when at the Reception I was told I have to call #9 to discuss. So I had to went up to my room and with the elevator situation it was a trip of easily 30 minutes. 

Late check out was granted finally after some discussions and arguments, but when I got to my room after noon, of course the key card did not work. I had to make another unpleasant trip to the Reception, wait in line to get the room key card reset. 

Unbelievable service. 
Not sure why this could not had been done the 1st time when I asked the Reception. To call #9 discuss and later return to the Reception seemed to be useless and rather a punishment. Bad service all over. 

Not a nice place to stay and I would rather forget any HHonors status as it seems those are anyway not granted at this Hilton.

I will look for the price at a different Hotel in the area as there are many, like the Melia Sky. The Hilton is just too low in their services provided for the room rates and as a Hotel guest the service and treatment as a guest count to me, otherwise I would go elsewhere. In addition to be HHonors Gold you had shown a kind of loyalty to the chain but this Hilton really does not care. I would stay away.",2,2016,08,28
36,Poor Experience at Purobeach,"We stayed at this Hilton in August 2016 as a family with 2 children.I am a diamond Honours member. The check in was very quick. The Hotel is in a great location within walking distance to beach and across the road from large shopping mall,restaurants and food outlets.The hotel is very nice & modern.
The cost of food & drink in the hotel is very expensive with a coke costing 6 Euros.
The pool area - Purobeach consists of a relatively small pool with loungers around the pool area and further back under a pergola area. The hotel advertises as free to guests but there is frequently no loungers available unless you reserve in advance for 25 Euros/lounger/day. On Saturdays and Sundays the hotel holds a pool party where loungers are not available to hotel guests - i tried in advance to be told none were available for either day. These pool parties are very busy where the hotel promotes these parties to be exclusive to the wealthy where lots of champagne is consumed. The ""Purobeach experience"" consists of a cabana with a few bottles of champagne for 2500 Euros/day. These parties are not child friendly with lots of alcohol being consumed and inevitably bad language & behaviour to follow.We saw people leaving the pool area having to walk through the hotel reception (Unless security managed to usher them out the side doors) turning the air blue with terrible language and dressed inappropriately.We followed 2 of these revellers- young girls walk from the hotel and into McDonalds opposite using very loud disgusting language in swimsuits with there breasts revealed. They were evicted from McDonalds  - a food outlet but were welcomed in a 5 star hotel such as the Hilton. I understand these parties must be financially beneficial to the Hilton but in my opinion at the expense of the hotel guests. I overheard lots of guests complaining regarding Purobeach. This is our 3rd stay at this hotel but will be our last purely because of how purobeach is being promoted",3,2016,08,27
36,Fabulous visit,"Stayed for 3 nights with 2 teenagers. I was concerned about negative reviews for this hotel but it was a good price so I gave it a try anyway & I was not disappointed. We disembarked from a cruise so arrived early & did not wait too long & our room that I had selected by checking in on the Hilton app was ready. All the staff were friendly & very helpful. The room was spacious & comfortable. We used a combination of the metro, taxis & the hop on hop off bus to get around the city & the sites. It was easy & I was actually glad that I booked away from the main city centre where it is very expensive for food & accomodation. Being summer holidays, we enjoyed being among the locals visiting the shopping centre across the street. We picked up cheap dinner there twice. It also has a massive supermarket with homewares/hardware with almost everything there. It was nice being away from the other tourists. Breakfast was fabulous but extremely busy. I admired the dining staff who remained pleasant while they were run off their feet. Having a taxi stand outside the hotel is very convenient. I would stay here again. The foyer is large, open & airy & was a pleasant place to wait for our room to be ready. ",4,2016,08,27
36,An excellent Hilton,"I've stayed in Hiltons worldwide and this is one of the better ones.  The hotel has nice staff and clean, new facilities.  Barcelona is an exceptionally clean city but this hotel is in one of the newer and cleanest areas.  It is opposite the Diagonal Mar shopping mall with restaurants and shops aplenty.  The poolside, on the second floor, has summer parties at weekends and is a cool place to be.  The beach is a short walk away.  Barcelona is not a big city so the hotel is well located for touring the city, despite what you might read on some of the reviews.",5,2016,08,26
36,Good location for beach and nice facility,"Second stay at the Diagonal Mar this August.   The hotel and staff are very nice and very close to the beach.  This hotel is that it is pretty far by public transportation to most of the attractions and pretty much forces you to the double decker bus or paying a fortune for cabs in transportation.  

Since my last visit they have added a pool which is more of a Las Vegas club style pool than a Hilton hotel in the middle of the city pool.  The weekend I was there they were having major parties and didn't seem to have any time for hotel guests that just wanted to swim.  

If you have Honors status the executive floor and breakfast are awesome additional bonuses to this hotel.  So as long as you don't need to be right in the center or town this hotel is a great choice!",4,2016,08,25
36,Wonderful holiday,"we had a fantastic time at the hotel. My kids enjoyed the facilities and especially the pool. Loved the fact that the hotel had an ice dispenser on every floor. The staff were very friendly, professional.We thoroughly enjoyed the breakfast buffet with so much variety. Totally spoilt for choice every morning.",5,2016,08,24
36,Excellent stay,All round excellent experience during the stay at the hotel with staff service extremely professional . Hotel is a beautiful play to stay and close to the beach with easy access to to the centre of the city either by taxi or public transport.. Airport is also a 20 taxi minute taxi ride away ,5,2016,08,23
36,Beautiful property but extremely FLAWED!! ,"This is a beautiful hotel with a great location in Barcelona. Things are not as good as they appear. The only good things that I can say about this hotel is we were allowed to check-in early and the included breakfast was nice. We arrived around 10:30am and it was a bit of a struggle but staff was able to get us into a room. I do wonder if they found the worst room they had available. If you stay here brace yourself for the smell. The foulest way I can explain the smell is a three week old urine soiled baby diaper. It's a smell you can never get used to smelling. Rooms are spacious but the bed was HARD! Not comfortable at all. Our bathroom (1203) shower leaked when in use. The water would build up and run behind the toilet. We would use the floor towel as well as a big bath towel. We complained about it for 4 days before they actually sent someone to try to fix it. Also, whenever the room above us showered, their water would leak through the ceiling above the shower. The night before we checked out, they offered us free dinner! Really?!? That's it with as much as the room cost and the inconvenience... NOT OK!!!  ",2,2016,08,23
36,Holaaaa Hilton Diagonal Mar again !,"Hotel staff could not be more friendly and helpful. Rooms, executive lounge, pool area all fabulous. Saturday and Sunday in summer are pool party days so unless you want to make reservation for that (not sure about cost) perhaps good days to go to the beach.... very close by. Have stayed at this hotel 3 times so far and it wont be the last",5,2016,08,23
36,Puro beach is brilliant,"I went with my boyfriend to celebrate his birthday , and the experience was wonderful. The Puro beach restaurant was very good, nice service of Maxi and a Romanian girl( I'm sorry I can't remember her name , very good bartender) They made our stay to be brilliant. See you soon guys, hotel big and clean, the rooms are clean and with good views. Breakfast is good and fresh, with a lot of variety.",5,2016,08,23
36,The best choice in town,"Excellent Hilton Experience from welcome to farewell. Great staff, quick check in, HH status recognized and upgrade to Executive Floor extended. Room was large with stunning views over the sea and Barcelona. Room is meticulously clean and well kept. AC is working perfectly. We enjoyed Purobeach and were informed about a party on Saturday and Sunday. As guests you can still enter the pool area and I really appreciated the personal attention of all the staff to check if we enjoyed ourselves. Definitely book a Balinese sunbed which is great for families with small kids. Food served at Purobeach is excellent, cooked and served next to the pool or on the deck. Loved the Popeye Chicken! Breakfast was best to enjoy early in the morning as it can become very busy around 10am. The team is delightful and attentive to serve you coffee and OJ. Also ordered Room Service which was served within half an hour and on hot plates! Would definitely return to this hotel as it is slightly out of the busy center of Barcelona, but so close to the sea and connections. Loved it!",5,2016,08,22
36,Worst Hilton property I have ever visited,"I am a big fan of Hilton and stay at their properties almost exclusively but I just returned from a holiday and visited this property and regret it. I am a Hilton honors member and have either been a gold or diamond member for many years and have stayed at some awesome Hilton properties world wide.... This was not one of them. Upon check in I was surprised to walk up to the main entrance of the hotel and find cigarette buts strun around the arrival area, really gross. Next when I was checking in I was told that I would not have access to the executive club which was strike two. Next the hotel wifi was crap. Next the hotel lobby area was dirty specially up near the entrance to the pool area. Btw the pool was very nice but drinks are brutally expensive. I also ordered a cheese sandwich and a Diet Coke all for 20.00EUR. Wow that's brutal. The staff were nice but with the amount I travel and spend with Hilton on a yearly basis I expect to be treated properly and have a memorable experience. My memory from this is not to stay here again.",1,2016,08,22
36,Short break in Barcelona,"Overall - would recommend!

This is a really good quality Hilton, with an executive lounge and a trendy pool area.  It's just across from a big shopping mall and about 200m from the beach.

The metro  ""El Maresme-Fòrum"" is behind the shopping mall and about an 8 minute walk.

Travel into Barcelona is easy by Metro - easiest to buy a ten journey ticket

Plus points of hotel;

- good location 
- good rooms
- excellent service
- nice outside restaurant area (food served quickly)
- very trendy pool are (Purobeach)
- good exec lounge

Considerations

- pool area very trendy and busy with pumping music (may not be everyone's taste)

- venue at weekends for hen parties by the pool (although civilised)

- hotel guests can only use the sun beds further back from pool without an extra charge

Other points 

- despite making a two night booking, we were only expected for one night (caused delay at check-in)

- had to get room card re-programmed 3 times

- Purobeach food was not brilliant (and very expensive)

- need to spend min of 500 euros for a double sun bed  by pool!

36,Reception staff at Hilton,"Tried to overcharge on departure- extras from restaurant and local tax which we had already paid.
 room not ready on arrival
party at puro beach couldn't use pool at weekend
Noisy at night outside room, 
2 and a half hour wait for luggage to arrive in room eventually picked up myself.",1,2016,08,20
36,Avoid this hotel during summer,I would this hotel off the summer it gets really busy during this time of the year. I have seen long lines for people trying to check in which can be frustrated especially if you just got off from a red eye flight. Luckily me and my family checked on late at night so we didn't have to wait. Also during breakfast time they long waiting lines. The housekeeping staff do resist good job to keep up with busy hotel. I love the breakfast at this hotel it has mixed of European and American breakfast items. I would like to thank the breakfast as they do an outstanding job by hiking from to another to check if they need anything kudos and to the housekeeping staff as well as they their best to keep up with busy hotel.,2,2016,08,19
36,Ideal location away from the tourist hustle,"Located in the business district. Comfortable, modern rooms. City tour bus stops right outside the hotel. Neighbors the largest shopping center Diagonal Mar. Ask for a room with sea views. Taxis always available and close to the airport. ",4,2016,08,19
36,Very Nice,"We found the Hotel very clean, there were plenty of towels and the staff were helpful. Breakfast had plenty of choice and the Hotel is within easy reach of the beach and all forms of public transport. There are lots of Restaurants in the shopping mall opposite the hotel which will cater for most tastes.",4,2016,08,17
36,Nice hotel on good location.,"We arrived from Aruba for our vacation in Spain with our 2 small children and started it off with a weekend in Barcelona at the Hilton Diagonal before heading for the Pyrenees. Only thing we did not know is that during weekends the pool is not suitable for young children as loud pool parties are taking place there.
Other than that, enjoyed our stay. We were upgraded to the executive floors (being a HH Diamond member) which had nice views. Did not use the executive lounge much, not nice to go with small kids as people come there to relax, but we stopped there on our way in and it sure looked nice. 
We ordered room service once for dinner and for both breakfast, which was delivered promptly and was of good quality. Had one dinner outside at Indigo which was quite nice too. 
Rooms are nice and spacious and housekeeping service was very good. 
We had a rental car so was easy to get around from the hotel and the Hilton DM has a very large parking garage connected to the hotel lobby.
So all and all enjoyed our stay and were relaxed from the long trip before we started the rest of our vacation in Spain.
Whenever traveling to Barcelona, we will stay the Hilton DM again.",4,2016,08,17
36,Everything was nice except for very dusty room hours later,Very nice and helpful staff. Clean rooms when we got in there. Spacious and attractive rooms. But by morning the room had  dust all over the table and our equipment. Definitely an allergy nightmare for those allergic to dust. ,4,2016,08,15
36,Comfortable,"I stayed in the King Hilton Guestroom. It was a decent size, enough room for me and another guest. The beds were really small in size, not what I'm use to in the US, but I got over it quickly. The bathroom was spacious as it had a bath/ shower and a separate shower. The view was of the city, so  I got a glimpse of people going to the mall, businesses, and the far away mountains. As for the room service, the food was pretty good. It can get expensive though! They were also very prompt in food service, and housekeeping. The good thing about the Hilton location is it is a couple blocks away from the beach, AND it is right across the street from the mall. I sometimes ate a McDonalds at the mall if I didn't feel like spending 20 dollars for a meal at the hotel. Also, there is a grocery store inside the mall where u can purchase snacks and water (life saver!). 

I was not expecting the plug outlets to be different, so I could not plug anything in! Luckily, the front desk was nice enough to find me a convertor so that I could plug my laptop in, etc.The pool area is very nice, however, gets very crowded. I was expecting to lay out and get a tan but could not due to the amount of guests partying (I assume a lot of ppl at the pool didn't even stay at the hotel). Nonetheless, it was a nice environment, but maybe not so much for kids. Unless you find the perfect time to go out with your kids before the partying begins.  The hotel bar in the lobby was also great to me.. especially the Sangrias made by David or Daniel (they were awesome!). If I ever did visit Barcelona again, I would stay here.",4,2016,08,15
36,Disapointed,"This hotel used to be our favorite hilton hotel. A 3 years ago we spent the best two weeks in there. The location is great. However, the customer service went down. In the executive launch we were told we could not take the half litter bottle of water to our table. The worts part is that the outdoor pool is now manage by purebeach bar. They give the worst seating (meters away from pool) to hotel guest and it is just a party crow. Not suitable for families unless you want your kids around people smoking pot, topless girls, couples making up and rich guys with prostitudes. We are incredible disappointed!!!",1,2016,08,15
36,DC,"Pool area was taken over by a pool party when we there and effectively stopped our children from enjoying the area, apart from that - perfect ! Really good breakfast, and in a good position to access open top tour buses, beach etc",5,2016,08,14
36,"Very nice, Hilton+ quality","I have been there several times, When working in Barcelona. Also i have been dozen other Hiltob hotels abroad.

This is very nice, clean hotel located next to mall and beach. Little walk to la rambla (2 kilometers??? Not sure)

Very good executive lounce with Tapas and selection of beverages. A couple of nice restaurants / bars.

Service and stuff have been nice and helpful. 

Only thing that i like to complain are the prices in restaurants & bars - but, that is the problem in all Hilton/Marriot/for seasons/... Quality chain hotels around the world.

It is very likely, that i'll be there again, when i'm in Barcelona.",5,2016,08,14
36,Fine,"We stayed here at the end of our trip around the French/Spanish coast.  

Hotel is large and busy, it appears that it supports some large cruise ships.  

The hotel is clean, tidy and reasonably priced.  Location is slightly out which suited us.

However, it's disappointing that the pool area is a pool party on a Saturday and Sunday very Vegas style! Not quiet and relaxing.  The executive lounge had far too many quests accessing which created a busy and hectic atmosphere.  The staff were swamped by the volume of customers.  

Can't decide if I would go back.",3,2016,08,14
36,Mediocre,This place is decently located as being a block and a half from the beach. The interior is nice. Rooms are very well appointed. There are just certain areas it falls flat. The pool is appointed like a Vegas pool club and I wouldn't say is very kid friendly. Prices are outrageous for food and drinks.,3,2016,08,14
36,High season work stay,"I selected this Hotel because of the location just outside the city and it is still walking distance (5km) . The hectic in the high season in bcn downtown is just too much , now in this hotel very quiet surrounding but across the street the beach and on the other side the mall.
rooms are nice , new hotel, great pool with only 1 thing you either love or hate the best beds at the pool are paid 40euro per 2 per day.",4,2016,08,14
36,Great Hotel for vacation,"this location is great you are 2 minutes from the beach and the hotel has a rooftop pool that is very lively. The Bartender David in the lounge is very friendly and knowledgeable, all in all this is a great stay!!",5,2016,08,13
36,location across street from ocean...,Easy to use hop on bus line as entry is block away.  Wonderful view of city from my window and close to beautiful park.  Wonderful food in restaurant and wait staff was especially attentive at breakfast.  Very nice mall directly across the street.,5,2016,08,11
36,Very good service,"I stayed at this hotel recently and got very happy with the staff service levels. Specially the front office manager, Rocio Fontella who was exceptionally very help ful. Hotel shall maintain the kind of staff who try to make the gust happy and make them a loyal customer. I will definitely come back to Hilton mar when I am back in Barcelona.",5,2016,08,10
36,Great for the beach,"In terms of the hotel itself it's perfect for close access to the beach. If you are doing a lot of sight seeing then it's a bit out the way in terms of walking but the metro makes it easy enough to get to most places.

For those staying on floor and upwards, the executive lounge is fairly standard as hiltons go, the view is good (albeit not like the picture shows with all the drinks outside...)

The room's are a very good size, lovely bed and bathroom is also spot on.

Now for the bad parts.

The pool and sun loungers... Normally fine during the week (We happened to stay over a weekend) But during the weekend it turns in to something out of the only way is essex with a lot of the sunbeds ""pre-brought"" for when the party kicks off mid afternoon all the way through till around 2/3am (I think was the latest we still heard music). this meant those lovely white sunbeds you see, and you think you are getting are actually reserved and you can't use them.

We were able to use them on the Monday and Tuesday as it's back to hotel guests using them, but if you are staying at a weekend I'd rule out getting to use them. 

The lifts also seem to take forever. I'd find myself waiting 5-8 minutes for a lift from the 17th floor which is not a great deal of time but still a pain. 

Overall knowing what I know now i'd most likely not stay there again (certainly on a weekend). If I didn't want to do any sight seeing and was visiting during the week I'd certainly stay there. Otherwise I'd stay else where.",4,2016,08,10
36,Excellent experience,"I stayed at this hotel after almost 4 years and my experience was even better than before. Although last time I was a platinum member with Hilton and this time just a normal blue level, but still the service I got was very good. Specially at the front desk, Ms. Rocio Fontella was really a good help. Giving us a good room and make us feel at home. I was with my family and had two rooms. My original plan was only for one night stay but I extend my stay by another one day and th help from her was actually appreciable. I will definitely come back to this hotel again when I am next in Barcelona. Dear hotel management, you shall keep this kind of staff really happy who help promote your hotel with the loyal customers and maintain them.",5,2016,08,10
36,Staff was great rooms were spacious,"Hotel is well located got a mall right opp it's away from the hustle of rambla and very close to the beach . Rooms are spacious breakfast is amazing 
Taxi's easily available as and for cruise travellers it's a 10 min drive",4,2016,08,10
36,Excellent Hotel,"A truly brilliant hotel with amazing views of Barcelona from the rooms. One of the best pool areas I have experienced although food and drinks at the bar are expensive. Excellent breakfast. Only issue is the location which is quite a bit away from the centre. Also, its about a 15 minute walk to the closest metro station. There is a very nice shopping centre across the road with good restaurants and a cinema.",5,2016,08,10
36,"Great Hotel, great location and smoking rooms","Very comfortable and welcoming hotel which has smoking rooms if you ask. Staff excellent and helpful. Nice outdoor pool.
Great location just opposite the Diagonal Mall with a variety of shops and eating places. Also only a few minutes walk to the beach. As a Hilton member I got free internet.
Enjoyed my stay and would return.",5,2016,08,10
36,A good place to stay near the beach,"This hotel was about a ten minute walk to the beach.  It was very convenient.  By the way, the beach is topless.  You have to pay for an umbrella and two beach lounge chairs.  It costs 24 euros.  It's good for a very sunny, hot day. If you're going to be at the beach for at least a couple of hours it's worth it.  The beach was very crowded wehere we were.  If you walked further down the beach however, the crowd thinned out.
We were upgraded to an executive room, where we got free breakfast and access to the excutuve lounge.  There is a shopping mall directly across the street.  I would recommend this hotel because of the location and good service.",4,2016,08,08
36,Lovely stay,"10 members of my family stayed here for 3 nights and we thoroughly enjoyed our experience. Not only did the staff go above and beyond to help us at all times, the rooms were clean (I'm fussy) and spacious. The pool area was lovely, my 3 year old loved it. The location of this hotel is perfect, so close to the beach and literally one minute walk to the mall across the road that has a large variety of restaurant/takeaway choices. All in all I'd definitely stay here again. Thanks Hilton! ",5,2016,08,08
36,Not everyone likes house music!,"The hotel was great, good location very close to the beach, metro station and with ashopping mall over the road.  However, we chose this hotel because it had a good size pool, which was lovely, but it was totally ruined by the music they played -- loud, non-stop house music with a thumping base.   Clearly they want to make the pool area ""cool and party'ish"" but it made it impossible to concentrate enough to read, answer emails, think or listen to music of our choice on our headphones.  We had planned to spend our afternoons chilling by the pool, but the music was torturous and made this impossible.  The Hilton proclaimed they had a ""make it right promise"" -- we complained to 3 different members of staff and all they did was sympathise with us, they did not make it right.  All in all, our stay was all but ruined because we could not use the pool area other than for a quick swim.  By the way members of our party ranged from 20 years old to mid-sixties and both found the music intolerable, so it is not an age thing.",4,2016,08,08
36,Bad service and overcrowded hotel,"Unfortunately this hotel is so busy with cruise ship customers that the service quality lacks significantly. Rooms are nice and facilities are excellent otherwise, but expect to queue 20 min at reception for checkin and out. For roomservice better to order outside or go to the mall opposite, lines are busy all the time...",1,2016,08,08
36,Good business hotel,"I stay in this hotel every second week for work and the standard doesn't really change which is good. Big hotel so some staff are not particularly friendly especially at reception as you can feel the volume they handle, but others are very nice. I'm always surprised they don't welcome me back as they must see somewhere that i was there a week before...
Big hotel so you feel a bit like a number!
But overall very good hotel, great breakfast and the staff there are very pleasant, nice porters, and very nice area by the pool! 
Close to the shopping centre, the beach and practical for the offices around but nothing else in the area!",4,2016,08,07
36,Standard Hilton,"Facilities: 
- Nice and clean
- the reception area is a bit tight 
- room size is good, some noise from the hallway
- Very nice pool area, however, you have to pay for the best sun beds.
Breakfast:
- Standard breakfast buffet, not extra ordinary but sufficient
Service:
- Outstanding, every one was very service minded; in the restaurant, pool area, reception room cleaning - Hilton standard
Location:
- Outside city center and have to use bus/taxi to reach the sights. Very close to the beach and a big mall.

Improvements: I was over charged. Someone had used my room number and billed a meal on me. Based on current routines it is easy to charge someone else as long as you get a room number and a name. Again, the service was very good and it was no problem to correct the final bill.
Something in the hotel is impacting our cell phones. The batteries were discharged very fast in the hotel. We did not experience anything like this else were in Spain.",4,2016,08,07
36,Excellent family vacation,The hotel is right across the street from the Diagnal shopping center where there are plenty choices of restaurants and stores. There is a playground in front of the shopping center where we spent some time every day. The beach is about 10 minite walk away. The Barcelona hop-on-hop-off bus has a stop at the shopping center. The executive lounge on the 15th floor has amazing views and offers breakfast and evening snacks. But the breakfast on the first floor has much more variety of food. Rooms on the high floors have amazing views. Pool on the second floor has nice views and good for sun bathing. Hotel staff is friendly and helpful.,5,2016,08,06
36,Conference Attendee,"I did not stay at this Hilton as a guest, but I did attend a conference that was being held here. My conference was 4 days long. The conference space was spacious and clean. Materials such as writing pads and pens were supplied in each conference room. 

The ladies bathrooms were clean; however, the air in the bathroom was very stale.

The snacks and tea selection provided during the conference by the hotel were not to my liking. 

I had the opportunity to eat breakfast at the hotel and it was quite a nice nice spread. I love eating breakfast at hotels in Europe. They have so many selections it is hard to choose from. 

I did not stay at this hotel during the conference because it was entirely too expensive. The location is a few blocks from the beach and is across the street from the shopping mall, Diagonal Mar.",3,2016,08,06
36,Warm and friendly staff make up for technical glitches,"Helpful staff can make up for a lot of the small glitches in a hotel. Staff at this Hilton were very helpful, and always smiling. Claudia in the restaurant greeted every guest with a morning smile.  Some small problems; shortage of hot water, wifi that was not reliable, were also part of the daily routine, even on the executive level. Security in the hotel is very good and very diligent, and they needed to be as a few of those at my conference were robbed just nearby the hotel by pickpockets and very brazen thieves. Be careful on the streets, and maybe use the mall across the street for restaurants nearby. Weekends they turn the pool into a ""dayclub"" with music and drinks and offer it open to the public for a fee, so don't plan to relax by the pool on the weekends in the summer.",3,2016,08,01
36,Birthday in Barcelona,"As every year we celebrate my birthday in Barcelona. This time we have chosen this hotel and we have been very satisfied. For someone it can be far from centre, but it is nice walk on the promenade from centre to hotel. Staff at reception was very friendly the whole time of our stay. Great service in the bar. Room very clean, breakfast very good and the highlight was Puro beach.",5,2016,07,31
36,Nickeled and dimed at the executive rate,"The floor of our executive room was so dirty and sticky that I had to take a towel and wash it myself- never had to do that before in a hotel. Then I went to the included executive lounge to eat breakfast while my son slept- average offerings. I tried to take one serving of breakfast to my son in the room and they said that I could not take food from the area- ridiculous! We don't drink alcohol so they already saved all that money on the fee for our executive room and then I could not feed my son without buying breakfast downstairs as I was told. Water pressure was poor on the 23 rd floor. And limited the internet so that even at the executive rate, we would have to have paid more to better service.

We finally moved to the Catalonia Magdelenas hotel Barcelona for the balance of our trip- 4 more days. Too bad Hilton, we wanted to enjoy your property but won't use it again.",2,2016,07,31
36,Nice contemporary hotel,"This hotel is just off the beach but a bit out of the centre - about 20 mins in a taxi so be prepared. 

However, it has a welcoming vibe and is very contemporary in its decor. Rooms are a good size and bathrooms fine.

Pool is a little small and more of an adults retreat than something for the family (especially if young).

Overall though very nice.

I would recommend using the red hop on/hop off tour buses, which you can get a few 100 yards up from the hotel - a great way to see the city.",4,2016,07,30
36,Not worth the money!!,"Poor service, smelling rooms (smoke), no complementary bottled water, too hard bed, amenities would better fit in a cheap motel, all over: I would never recommend this hotel! You can get much better for 230+ a night.The only nice place is the pool. But then, any drink there is crazy expensive!",2,2016,07,30
36,Check in at 16:00!!!!!! 😡😡😡,"Its 15;00. 
And i cannot check inn
3 hours later of the supposed  check out of the rest of the clients.
And i cannot check in.
I arrived to the hotel at 12:00 hopping to do check ln.
And they didnt let me. 
Had to wait until 16:00!!!!!!!

So you have to check in at 16;00 but you have to leave the room at 12:00

4 hours that they steal you!!

😡😡😡",1,2016,07,29
36,"room, amenities, inconveniences","We were drained and very tired from long flight. As soon as we got to the room to shower, there was stoppage in drain, and the water flowed on the floor during shower. We had to use hotel towels to soak up the water twice since we have been here. There is 2 showers, but the other has no shower curtain. We're here on business til August 1, and it has been miserable. There are no vending machines, so you are forced to pay 6 euros from the bar for a mini-cola. The fridge is full of their overpriced drinks, with space for 2 personal 20 ounce items. There is no microwave for use in the whole hotel.",2,2016,07,28
36,Dissappointed ,"The hype around this hotel made me think so much more of it. The bed felt like I was sleeping on a rock, the Internet didn't even work. I'm a diamond member, there's two wireless networks for me to connect too neither work. The only thing that made it two stars rather then one was the location. Very disappointed for how much I spent. ",2,2016,07,28
36,Great Hotel in Barcelona!,"Excellent Customer Service!
Asked for a sea view room, given one in no time. 
Breakfast.. Large variety to choose from, great atmosphere.
Walk across to shopping Mall and variety of restaurants.
5 minutes walk to the beach
Excellent location!
Highly recommend.",5,2016,07,28
36,Excellent staff and location,"Staying at 3 nights prior and 1 night after a Mediterranean Cruise. Arrived early flight from US. Very helpful to make you comfortable while waiting on room and getting you into your room asap. Location has nice view, near beach, great pool and pool area, across street from a mall with various food places besides good hotel dining too. 15 minute drive to downtown. Will stay there again!",5,2016,07,27
36,What Travelling Families Should Know...,"This review provides information relevant to travelling families, tourists and runners.

Families: The treatment our  family received from the hotel staff was outstanding! However, I do have a beef with this American-based Hilton hotel chain that operates as Americans' home away from home. Unlike North America's ""double rooms"", it seems that the Hiltons in Europe do not offer reasonably priced rooms for families. Our family of four was forced to purchase two rooms: king room + twin room (two singles).We had hoped to trade our two rooms for a suitable suite or at least adjoining rooms, but that upgrade was not available. In fact, we were only able to negotiate ""adjacent"" rooms. [Note: Adjacent does NOT equal ""adjoining"".] The fact the stay cost twice as much as it should have (3 nights for the cost of 6 nights) would be the only negative aspect of our stay. And, we knew this prior to our arrival, so I don't hold this against the hotel. Considering that such a high percentage of its guests are from North America, I'm surprised the Hilton standard does not include more suitable family accommodations.

Location and Transportation: The hotel is situated across town from the airport. It is in a recently revitalized and modern part of Barcelona. Within a five minute walk you will find a major shopping mall (with a grocery store, many restaurants, etc.), a subway station, the beach, and stops for both Hop-on Hop-off tourist bus companies. The taxi from the airport cost 45€ and to the seaport cost us 25€ (in traffic). From the hotel the town center is about 40 minutes away when travelling by Hop-on Hop-off bus (requires transfer) and shorter by subway (15 minutes). About a 20 minute walk toward town is a street with many restaurants and  patios and great atmosphere. Note that the subways were excellent: clean and safe. Families can opt for the10 ticket pack which costs 10€. The bottom line on location is that it is perfect for families: far enough from ground zero but close enough to access the action when needed.

Pool: The outdoor pool is a fair size with plenty of umbrella beds. ‎A bar, restaurant and spa are all adjacent to the pool. The towels from the spa are free for guest use but the umbrella beds have a cost! There are lounge chairs and the beach where the price is right!!

Runners: The hotel had a smallish indoor gym with three treadmills and other equipment. I used the gym only to refill water bottles. There are so many awesome running options outside that you should not waste the opportunity by running indoors. And, Barcelona has many runners - especially when the sun is less intense.

Room: Very clean and newish. We stayed on the Executive level of the hotel. The lounge provided breakfast and there were snacks throughout the day. The lounge also had an outdoor patio. 

Conclusion: A very good option for Barcelona. Too bad there isn't more suitable options for families.",4,2016,07,25
36,Taste of Spain,Great hotel! If you have access to executive lounge you will not be disappointed.  Wonderful selection of breakfast and great evening snacks and drinks.  Perfect location.  Across from the beach and huge mall for shopping on the other side.  Hop on hop off bus line is on the corner-- fantastic way to see all of the beauty of Barcelona.  Staff was very friendly.  Highly recommend this hotel.  ,5,2016,07,25
36,Good location and friendly staff,"Recent trip to Barcelona and the Hilton helped make the experience a good, solid all around trip.  Location was good near the old harbor with dining and shopping very close by.  Pool was very nice, although very busy and loud.  Our room was good but the beds were not what we were used to in the states.  Our room consisted of 3 twin size beds....felt like a campout vs. a Hilton stay.  Staff was very friendly and helpful and local dining for breakfast was quite good.  This is not in the heart of Barcelona but has great access to beaches and local harbor.",4,2016,07,25
36,Beware of the pool parties,"Stayed here for 5 nights / 4 days for complete R&R after a very busy few months.  Booked this hotel purely for the pool area after looking at many different hotels across Europe. Beware, the pool area doesn't feel like it is for the hotel guests particularly at the weekends, we arrived around 11am on the Friday and were told since we didn't have a reservation we couldn't sit on any of the nice lounges next to the pool, the same on the Saturday. Never ever had to book an area around a hotel pool before.  Sat and Sun were big pool parties, with all non hotel residences, the toilets busy, bar busy, noisy etc. If you are coming just make sure you reserve a lounger. There is an area for those who haven't but very much feels like you are in the cheap seats. 

On the plus side, service was excellent, Daniel in the lobby bar an asset to this hotel. Cocktails great, although on the expensive side for a Hilton, drinks are actually cheaper at the W hotel. Food also good. Buffet breakfast busy but good service and food.

Stayed in an executive room, lounge nice but big lack of GF nibbles at night.",4,2016,07,24
36,"Caution ""Construction Site""","Early morning construction with drills and hammers in front of your door, just to be told by hotel that you just have to deal with it til they are done. Never again!!! As a customer, I deserve more respect. ",2,2016,07,23
36,Happy with Hilton,"We enjoyed our stay at this Hilton.  We stayed at this Hilton and the Hilton Diagonal Mar during our stay.  While we liked being close to the beach at the other Hilton, we would probably stay here next time because it was easier to get to via metro.  The rooms were pretty and clean, staff was friendly, and the breakfast is really great.  I would choose this hotel again.",5,2016,07,22
36,Not a Hilton,"If you are expecting a standard Hilton hotel, you will be extremely disappointed with this hotel.  Customer satisfaction did not seem to be high on their priority list, even for Diamond members in their loyalty program.  I fell sorry for the average person to visit this hotel",2,2016,07,21
36,Great stay in Barcelona,"We had a lovely stay in our connecting-rooms👌🏼 Nice walk at the beach-promenade to the city center, lovely swimmingpool, nice breakfast, helpful straff and good sleep for everyone. Free internet in the room that worked perfectly. ",5,2016,07,21
36,A Special Birthday.,"We only stayed in Barcelona for one night, allowing us to decompress from our cruise, and explore the wonderful building art of Gaudi. We hadn't planned on the hotel being our highlight of the visit, but it was. The staff was friendly, the room was clean, and spacious, and the hotel was close to everything, mall - across the street, beach - less than 3 blocks, buses, and tours - pick up right on the corner, pool - crystal clean, with a Vegas style party going on. The staff surprised my wife with a cake, and a bottle of champagne, when they discovered it was her birthday. Highly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,07,20
36,Great property but Front Desk staff needs to improve,"The property is simply amazing: Spacious and clean rooms with all amenities one could expect (if you get lucky you have a fantastic view as well) ; beautiful bathrooms ; a nice restaurant ; well equipped gym and of course the fantastic Pool area on the second floor roof top which is an absolute highlight

The location is very nice and convenient: the beach is located in 5 min walking distance; a nice shopping mall is right across the street ; the neighborhood is modern and clean ; it takes a 10 min cab drive to the city's center

What I didn't like at all was the lack of service we experienced during our stay. Front Desk staff did not take the time to explain the property ; no smiles, good mornings or good byes when you walk past them. It always seemed they didn't want to be bothered when you asked them for help - this is not what I am used to when staying at a Hilton.

Same goes for the service at the pool: very slow and almost rude at some points. This does not comply with the high prices they charge and should be taken under consideration by management.

Only exception is the staff in the restaurant who did a terrific job when I went there for breakfast and dinner! That is the service guests expect from a Hilton Hotel. Their colleagues should take them as an example in my eyes.",4,2016,07,19
36,Wonderful Experience and Service,We had a great time and the service was terrific. It is worth paying for upgrade to have access to club floor with breakfast and in substantive snacks in the evening with an excellent view. Also extra charge for pool lounge chairs and cabana is worth it.,5,2016,07,19
36,Perfect for conference visit and very well placed,"I have stayed in 3 hotels near the conference centre over the years and this was the best experience so far. Very close as are the others in this space, but the room quality was excellent. Room service was prompt and the food of good quality. The room I had was spacious and good view out across the city and sea view. There is an underground station not far and this takes you directly to the old city. The local beach area is also just 2 blocks away so if in summer this would also be a great option. Little things, but the minibar fridge had a position for your own milk or beer if you wished.",5,2016,07,18
36,Strange!,"I might say rooms are more than spacious and views are stunning if you get either sea or sagrada familia views. It's weird to go to the pool of the hotel and you might not get space to put your towel or not be able to get in, without a fee I mean, never seen before. Parking is very costly, abusive I would say. The lounge terrace is one of kind where you can enjoy a typical Hilton buffet. Near the beach that is true. Sorry but parking fee and limited access to the pool  still hurts. I have stayed in your hotel several times before writing this review. ",3,2016,07,18
36,"Comfortable rooms, helpful staff","Stayed two nights in July, hotel is a bit out of the way, but downtown easily reachable by taxi. About 20-30 min walk to the outer part of the more popular areas. Staff was polite and friendly. Good variety for breakfast. Rooms were very nice, comfortable size standard double. Free wi-fi if you are a Hilton Rewards member, very easy to sign up. Bar was a little expensive, but not much more than we expected to pay. Overall a good experience, would recommend this hotel.",4,2016,07,17
36,Excellent choice for a long weekend trip to Barcelona,"We stayed in Hilton Diagonal Mar during our recent weekend trip from Madrid to Barcelona. For a relatively short stay that was a very good choice that allowed us to experience both the beach and the city. The hotel is within a short walking distance to a nice beach so one can go for a swim before lunch and then explore the city in the afternoon and in the evening. Getting to town and back to the hotel was easy: there is a metro stop across the mall from the hotel (we bought a 10 ride ticket per person that was enough for the entire weekend). The hotel staff was very helpful, rooms modern and very comfortable. I would definitely choose this hotel again during my next visit to Barcelona.",5,2016,07,16
36,Great Experience,"Very clean hotel with very Nice staff.  Also, great location with beach close by and mall next door providing a variety of resturants and shopping.  Breakfast was very good.  We will definitly stay here if we visit Barcelona again.",5,2016,07,15
36,Perfectly Functional Hotel,"Perfectly functional hotel, it is was exactly up to par with up it presents itself to be. Beware the pool In the summer seasons, it is mostly public entrants and very difficult for hotel guests to b comfortable. All else, very good for a getaway.",3,2016,07,12
36,The One and The Only,Perfect location and nice building. Very well-trained staff. We as famly feel that it is not hotel that's our HOME. It gives the impression that Hotel for Business as well as the Resort both aim. I humbly advise Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona. I do say please stop your Hotel search in Barcelona. This the ONE and ONLY.,5,2016,07,12
36,Nice hotel!,We had a great stay at the Hilton Diagonal Mar after our recent cruise. The hotel is located close to some nice beaches and a great shopping mall was across the street with lots of restaurant options. The service was great and the room was in really good shape. The room we had included a pullout couch for our son so that worked out really well.  Also has a nice pool area that was pretty busy and happening while we were in town. It's a little farther out from all the activity and sites near Las Ramblas but was an easy 11 Euro taxi ride. ,4,2016,07,09
36,Some areas of improvement required. ,"This is my second stay at this hotel last one was 4 years ago. 
The hotel rooms are nice and spacious and cleaned really well thought out weeks stay. The only issue with the room is the bathrooms are quite dated and perhaps need a refresh. 
The check in process was fast but check out was slow and people kept jumping ahead of the que. 
The pool has now been taken over by a company called puro beach and the pool when they had parties gets rammed to the point that there's glasses and bottle tops thrown in the pool. On one day we watched a young boy snorkelling and pulling all the glasses and tops out of the bottom of the pool. I would say get there early to avoid not getting a sun bed at the weekend. We booked ahead and nearly had to pay for our reservation of sun beds until they sorted it out. Be aware if you reserve ahead you will have to pay 25 euros per bed! the drinks at the pool were really expensive and I feel it's very very separate from the hotel lots of drunk people around and not a child friendly area at all. 
The breakfast was.... Ok there wasn't that much variety not like it was a few years ago. The hotel is very close to the metro and a taxi in to town will Cousy around 17 euros. Overall a good stay but I wish the hotel had more control over the drunk people at the pool party. ",3,2016,07,08
36,HILTON - SIMPLY THE BEST,"Great place, very local to all amenities i.e. large shopping mall, supermarket, restaurants and beach not far from central town which can be reached by bus, train or taxi. Staff very efficient, pleasant and helpful. Not too impressed with the facilities in Purobeach - firstly we were unable to use full facilities as place booked out weekends for private parties. Ladies changing and steam room extremely small. Staff very pushy in you must purchase drinks/alcohol if using their sunbeds - don't quite feel relaxed without staff hassling you to buy either food or drink every few minutes!! Bar staff excellent and make great cocktails however extremely expensive prices even for a Hilton.",5,2016,07,08
36,It was perfect!,"Although the location is out of city, subwaystation is near the hotel(oppsite of shopping mall). And it take 10min to city town by taxi. We went to airport by taxi it took just 20min!! There is big shopping mall in front of hotel. It is very nice, there are many shops and playground(my children played there while I enjoy shopping). Also you can walk to beach from hotel. and out-door pool in Hotel is also very good. The lounge and buffet at 1st Floor also excellent. All staffs are very kind and nice!!",5,2016,07,07
36,A Great Place to Anchor your Barcelona Holiday,"Staff here are fabulous: knowledgeable, friendly and eager to provide great service. Location is very nice with a vibrant pool scene, a short walk to the beach, a few blocks to the Metro. 

Our room was clean, bed exceptionally comfortable",5,2016,07,06
36,Ivo Milikin,This is one of the best hotels that I'm staying ! All of the facilities is great but most important is the service. This hotel have the excellence of all of the aspects of servicing. Next time I will chose hotel again and strongly recommended for visitors with any purpose .  ,5,2016,07,05
36,Solid Choice ,"Had stayed at this Hilton hotel previously back in 2005 and decided to stay again on a recent business trip to Barcelona.

The hotel is quite far to the east from the city center but close to the beach if that is your reason the stay here.

Received an upgrade to Junior Suite based on my Hilton HHonors Diamond status. 

The club lounge was very busy in the evening when most guests were pouring down wine left and right. Snacks run out occasionally. Did check the breakfast.

There's a mall on the other side of the road that has few F&B outlets and a cinema.

Will probably return if need to be in this part of Barcelona again.",4,2016,07,05
36,I would like to commend all the staff of hilton diagonal mar Barcelona for their amazing service they have given to us.,Most of the staff are very helpful particularly Leonardo from room service and Eliza from morning breakfast this people were high value to this hotel they are so amazing in term of hospitality is concern thank you very much certainly we were coming back and recommend this place to our dearest friends around the globe.,5,2016,07,03
36,Very happy,"Everything was lovely about this hotel. The only thing it doesn't have are balconies, apart from that I couldn't fault it. The staff were all very friendly and the food was great.  Five minutes walk from the beach and opposite lots of restaurants. ",4,2016,07,02
36,Great Hotel/Amazing Staff,"The rooms are pretty modern.  The bathroom is good size and it has a full size tub that has a shower, but no curtain, however they added a small shower (don't understand why), which is very dark and leaks water on the floor when you open the door.  The Staff is very nice and very attentive, especially Daniel at the pool bar and he  also worked the lobby bar, such a nice guy.  Ana at the Front Desk was very helpful with some reservations changes and David at the Lobby Bar was very nice.  The only issue I would say is that the hotel has events by the pool on the weekends and the staff tends to forget about the hotel guest at the bar.  Overall the hotel is great and I would stay there again. It's right down from the beach and not in the middle of City Center, but you can catch the train nearby.  There is a very nice mall across the street, with nice restaurants and shopping.",5,2016,07,01
36,Great Service and Fine Hotel,"This hotel is modern, comfortable, and conveniently located. Most importantly, the staff is highly attentive and the service is first rate. I would easily stay there again on or next trip to Barcelona. Hint: ask the bartender, Sergio, about the best places to eat his recommendations are terrific.",5,2016,07,01
36,nice place to stay beach is close,"Nice place for a business trip or with family,  service and facility is above average a short walking distance to a nice beach.  Shopping center is across the street however if you the location is away from the city center or any tourist attractions. A 20 minute taxi ride to the city center",3,2016,06,30
36,Great service and attention ,"We stayed 4 nights at the hotel, my friend and I. We received great service throuhout the stay and the exec lounge was a nice perk. The hotel helped us to have a nice ""mum's"" vacation, and we enjoyed the horel and club puro.  So a perfect place for us!",5,2016,06,29
36,great place to stay,"This was a very nice hotel to stay, the staff went out of there way to insure our stay way the best. We will stay here next time when we return. Very stylish hotel, and we found that it contently located to everything.",5,2016,06,28
36,Fantastic place!,The rooms are spacious and clean. Location was fantastic. Easy access to the beach and a mall. Taxi service was easy to use. Would stay again!  Had a lovely view of the Med.  The breakfast buffet had anything and everything you could want. Staff was friendly and helpful. ,5,2016,06,27
36,Quality Hilton,"An extremely nice hotel that fits the Hilton brand. A little out of the city so quieter from all the hustle and bustle but close to public transport for easy access to the sites.  The tourist buses pass the hotel so this also makes things easier. Great facilities throughout as you would expect, the Purobeach pool area is exceptional. Access to the executive lounge for breakfast and snacks is a nice addition as is free WiFi for HHONORS members.",5,2016,06,27
36,Great views to the city and very decent hotel,"Hotel rooms in good condition which are very spacious. The staff is quite friendly and helpful. We did have access to the executive lounge on LV25 and this is the USP of the hotel. The lounge has a  big terrace with great views of Barcelona city and the sea. The food offered though for breakfast is extremely limited (no fried eggs available a la minute as no live cooking station). Food for evening cocktail is limited too. So for more variety suggest to have breakfast at the All day Dining on LV1. The hotel location though is far from city downtown, but conveniently in front of a great shopping mall - Diagonal Mar. A good hotel to stay overall.",4,2016,06,26
36,"Take it or leave it, but probably leave it","Stayed here for 2 nights, to see the city with family who hadn't been to Spain before, and to catch a cruise. 
Barcelona is a vibrant city ( I have been here before), so if you really want to ""step out"" into this: stay somewhere else (in, or closer to, the old center). If you want to feel like your in 1 of a hundred similar modern cities (or perhaps on Business): this may suit you. 
Service wise: only just OK; really nothing special. Porters seemed to look the other way, and not help unless asked. Reception and executive lounge staff: OK when you could actually get to someone e.g. It took over 30 minutes to get a room key fixed, which didn't work paste midday (was bounced between reception, to executive lounge which wasn't staffed, back to reception).
When I'm back in Barcelona, this hotel won't be on my preference list.",2,2016,06,26
36,Great Hotel,"Nice hotel to stay. We were with the family there. Close to the beach. Not in the center but also not far away. Nice food, good breakfast. Clean rooms and very quiet area yet only 10 minutes to the center of the city with the taxi. Nice place to stay.",4,2016,06,24
36,Barcelona visit,"Stayed at the Hilton before getting cruise ship. Very clean, comfortable hotel. Small mall across from it with several good restaurants. They have a very good buffet breakfast.
Beaches are only several blocks away.",5,2016,06,22
36,Visit to the city,"This is a very large hotel but the staff if still friendly. It's a little further outside of the main city centre and the beach, but perfect for the Nou Camp or for business travellers. I walked into the city and was only a 20 minutes walk down the Diagonal that meets in the main square and the las ramblas. Wasn't too expensive, but with all the new hotels built at the seafront, it is losing some of its tourist appeal and will be more for business travellers.",4,2016,06,18
36,Too expensive,"Not good value for money. Poor wifi, expensive room service, windows cracked and dirty in the outside, shower and tub need to be replaced.
Useful for conferences/events at the convention centre, but otherwise I would go elsewhere.",2,2016,06,18
36,Good Hotel,"This Hotel is good and has nice rooms, with a beautiful view and a nice pool area. The food is nice and the overall service is really good. Beach is not far and if you like shopping the Diagonal Mar shopping mall is just across the street. The travel to the city centre takes a bit longer but it is no problem.",4,2016,06,15
36,Fairly good place to stay in the Forum area in Barcelona.,"This is a Hilton hotel with the typical standards of an American hotel: carpeted rooms and aisles, iron and a wide safe in the room, wide and comfortable beds, and everything perfectly clean.
The location of the hotel is just opposite a big mall and at a walkable distance of the beach. However it is far away from the main touristic attractions and night life of this otherwise vibrant city.
The aisle of my floor (6th) smelled pretty bad. The staff at the lobby might be more proactive and anticipate their clients' needs.",3,2016,06,14
36,Daniel,"Excellent location, opposite to International Mall with lots of eat and lots to buy. 5 minutes walk to beach. Food was excellent, service is cosy. Very expensive Bar with beer costing 10 Euro. Have nice size function room. Pool side cafe was nice.",4,2016,06,13
36,Great location nice hotel,We stayed on club floor the lounge was great lots of afternoon nibbles and evening and drinks and good size selection for breakfast. The pool is good but we had a issue as they wanted to charge to use the pool lounges just not good enough when you are a guest of the hotel. We did speak to the manager who sorted it out which was great but just beware as you should not pay,4,2016,06,13
36,Good hotel but pricy,"Hilton offers a good quality generally speaking. The room was standard for a hotel of this class. Bathroom too. The hotel is quite big and can accommodate large groups for conferences or meetings. Good facility including catering. From the airport you will be paying a bit more than 30 euros. A metro station is close by and the beach just 150 meters away. You can walk or run at the seaside or just have a swim.
Right in front of the hotel is a big mall with hypermarket, theatre, small restaurants... everyone will find his own enjoyment. The room as well as the breakfast prices are definitely overstated. Service was excellent - mostly young employees - and very efficient.",3,2016,06,12
36,Good location hotel,"I stayed for four days in this hotel for a business trip, and used the gym, pool, the lobby cafe, the catering , conference area, in room dining service, and here we go:

The Goods:
- The hotel location is superb, 5 minutes walk from the beach and right across the street you have a great shopping center and a load of different cuisines restaurants and cafes. 
- The food and drink was great starting from the varieties at the breakfast and the catering during the conference coffee breaks till the in room dining, i had a lovely burger (US Burger), i highly recommend it.
- The staff were very friendly and helpful.

The Bads:
- The room i got was some how small and felt old with some marks on the wall. I had a small hair on my bed sheet once i got in, didn't have a trash can neither a luggage rack, i called the house keeper, took the hair, and brought me the stuff! 
- The pre Authorization on Credit Cards upon check in was made two times and refunded and it happened again at the last day before check out, which i considered annoying and should never happen in 5 stars hotels! 
- The pool area was nice but the pool itself was relatively small, and the Gym was also small, loaded with equipment but not much space to stretch!
-  I thought the rate of the rooms in comparing to the quality is overpriced. 

That was it for this Hilton, I usually don't stay in Hiltons quite often to compare, but if you look for a great location in Barceluna this one can be a good option !!",4,2016,06,11
36,Great location but disappointing ,"Picked this hotel as it was near to the Parc del Forum where we were attending a music festival..was less than 10 minutes walk so ideal for this plus the beach was round the corner. We also picked it because of the nice pool area where we were looking forward to relaxing in the daytime.
The room was fine..clean and roomy, nothing special as such but perfectly nice. 
The pool was very disappointing..a lovely setting but a clear money making exercise with the focus on people coming in from outside rather than Hilton guests..should be the other way round! And one staff member tried to convince us we had to pay for beds which was not the case at all & left a sour taste in our mouths. Yes you can pay to reserve a bed when it's busy if you wish but you don't have to.
Wouldn't stay here again as it was nothing special and the pool, which was one of the deciding factors, was disappointing for the reasons stated. Would stay elsewhere next time for less money & just go to the beach.",3,2016,06,11
36,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona Review ,Definitely not worth the money. Rooms equivalent to 4 star rating. All food terrible especially breakfast. Location far from town center & harbor. Close to beach front but not close to the popular beach front places. Awesome pool area. Staff very friendly but found reception staff not obliging at all. Will not stay here again. ,3,2016,06,10
36,Ideal hotel if you are visiting Primavera Festival,"The hotel meets what you would expect of a Hilton hotel. The rooms are quite spacious and the beds are pretty decent. Nice bathroom and lots of space to unpack your stuff. The real advantage of this hotel is its location if you are visiting The Primavera Festival. The hotel is basically a 5 minute walk from the festival grounds. On the other side of the hotel you have a large shopping mall with restaurants and bars, shops and a very large supermarket. You can literally survive the whole Festival weekend there not having to walk more than 5 minutes either way. The hotel has also a poll with lots sun beds and a bar. Most beds are reserved but they will allow you to use the beds further away from the pool which are just as good. The only downside was the Wifi which was quite poor and most of the time we just hooked up on the Free Barcelona Wifi instead. Still, overall good experience.",4,2016,06,10
36,Fantastic hotel!,"We came for Primavera Sound, the music festival at Parc de Forum. This is best choice to stay at around that area.

We booked the Relaxation Room and the one we got faced the festival itself. Simple in its furnishings but very comfortable. Amazing bath tub with jets for our tired legs. 

We had ordered room service one day and ordered a plate of cheese. But the housekeeping cleared up the plate of cheese in the room before we were done. We were hoping to finish that up when we got back. We called the front desk and they couldn't do anything about it then, and never followed up with replacing the food they took away. 

We made the reservations online under ""Weekend Getaway Package"" which should include breakfast, double points and internet package. But the reservation confirmation didn't reflect that and we never got any breakfast or double points. We did get the internet because we are Hilton Honors members. So make sure you take a screengrab when you make the booking.",5,2016,06,09
36,Hilton Diagonal Mar June 2016,"Pricey but good hotel.  Pool and gym pretty good with lots of sunbeds - but the better ones around the pool are for reserved 'party' guests only. There was a DJ playing around the pool the whole time I was there and the music was so loud, that it was better to have the 'free' sun loungers further away from poolside.  We should have two connecting rooms but they didn't give us this so later on we switched to the top floor Lobby corner rooms. I had the twin sea view rooms which were good but the air-con was not working - you have to request to get it switched on.  Short walk from local Metro and ideal for the Primavera Sound Festival.",4,2016,06,09
36,great for barcelona festivals,"best hilton I've stayed in, rooms are a good size , very good location for any of the events on at the parc forum but a bit out of town .
on the first night we were woken up really early by the primavera soundchecks but the staff were great and moved our room after that there was no problem with noise.
my only real complaint is that although the roof pool is one of the nicer I've seen its franchised, so you aren't allowed to take any drink or food there , not even water , there was also a suggestion that residents may need to pay to use the loungers",4,2016,06,08
36,Great Hotel - Pool Let's it Down ,"We stayed here in 2012 and loved it. Last year as the Hilton was fully booked we stayed at the Princess across the street. This year we went back to the Hilton...

We booked a Junior Suite but upon arrival Ana at the front desk offered an upgrade to an Executive Suite which we decided to take up. We were told we had access to the 15th floor lounge for easy check out, breakfast and balcony. We were also told we had a large daybed at the pool with free water, fruit and after sun moisturiser. The suite on the 17th floor (Room 1717) was very spacious and modern. The room was well maintained (although it had a broken blind slat). House keeping and laundry service was excellent.

We tried the 15th floor lounge the following day and were not impressed. Basic breakfast and the bar doesn't really open until late in the day and didn't offer spirits. We never went back.

Also on the first full day we were shown to our day bed and as we were told water, fruit etc... was given. We stayed from 12 to 4 but left as it was getting a bit loud and rowdy as a function was organised and wasn't exactly family oriented.

The following day we returned to the pool and felt like we were unwelcome. No water, no fruit,  no service.

On our final full day we decided to have a pool day. We arrived at 12 noon. Fruit and water was brought over, great ! Our 8 year old son met his new friends and played in the pool with the inflatables.  By 2 pm a chap dressed in black, with an orange walkie talkie took the inflatables out of the pool. The kids said they are still playing with them. He said, ""no, no more"". As a waitress walked past I asked why the toys were taken and was told Coke have a function at 2:30. I said can they play with them in the big pool as the small pool had been cordoned off for this event. She said no. They have both pools. I wondered how they were gonna manage this as all the sunbeds were taken by the pool by guests (about 50 guests). Turned out only about 12 turned up for this Coke event... Felt like we were valued guests until the rowdy pool events start - then please leave...

Don't get me wrong, the hotel is great. Wonderful reception, bar, rooms, housekeeping and laundry service.  Unfortunately the pool (Purobeach) spoils it.

As we go to Barcelona annually to spend 25% of our time at the pool this hotel is no longer for us.",3,2016,06,07
36,Fantastic stay at Hilton Diagonal. One of my favourite hotels.,"Fantastic to be back! Superb Room on the corner of the 21st floor, combined with the use of the lounge on the 15th floor. It really does pay to be an Honours member. 
Restaurant on the 1st floor welcomed us back with open arms, The food cooked to a tee!
We where blown away by the fantastic upgrade in the pool area and the Spa simply amazing. ""A very grateful full body Massage After a long day at the MotoGP.""
Also this week is the Barcelona festival of spring. Bands and DJ's from around the world
converge onto a gigantic carpark area next to the beach. In attendance some 80,000 people enjoy a three day event, in close proxcimity to the Hotel. 
The Hilton fully entertained us with Dj's mixing chillout combinations from mixture of genre, around the fabulous cocktail/pool area.
What an amazing long weekend!",5,2016,06,07
36,"Great room, good location if you are happy to be out of town","We went for Primavera festival and the location could not have been better. The rooms were great, we got executive rooms so that we could access the lounge which had amazing views over the ocean and free drinks and nipples throughout the day. 
The only down side would be the food at the pool and for breakfast, for a 5 star hotel it was a little disappointing.",5,2016,06,07
36,Deceived,"I use Hilton all the time (about 200 nights per year) for business,this time however it was for a few days break with my wife and young son.
One of the main reasons I chose this hotel was because it had a pool for my son.
If you checkout the website you'll see that most of the photo's they use feature the pool.
On arrival we went to the pool to be told that there was no space,there wouldn't be any space the following day and maybe not the day after.
The pool area is set up as a 'spa' and run by a company called Purobeach.
Access to the pool is controlled by Purobeach,AS A HILTON GUEST YOU DO NOT HAVE AUTOMATIC ACCESS !!!!!
If you can get a space it's 20 euro's per person to be there.
Also the member of staff I spoke to said it may not be appropriate for a child to be in that area because of the amount of drunk people (not guests) who were there.
I know I've majored on one issue here but it was a big deal to me and I feel deceived.
The rest of the hotel was acceptable,be aware it's a few miles from the city centre (10 euro taxi ride) but they do make that clear on their website,a positive is that it's only about 500 metres from a really nice beach",1,2016,06,07
36,One of the better Hiltons,"Hiltons can be hit and miss. This was hit. The standard room was spacious, clean, good bed, large desk, decent bathroom. Airco was poor though, never really cooled the room. Could have also used two free sockets either side of the bed. There were sockets, but I had to move the side tables and unplug the night lamps. Another example of a room designed by someone who doesn't sleep in his designs. 
Shopping center with supermarket and a dozen restaurants across the street, 5 minute walk to beach. ",4,2016,06,06
36,Very average for Hilton,"Hotel is a bit out of town but there is a train station nearby!

Average at best - room is nice, showers had low water pressure, gym is small and executive lounge pretty mediocre.

The breakfast buffet at Mosaic was decent but same every morning!",3,2016,06,06
36,Short trip,The hotel says it has a pool but it actually run by another company that was having a pool party both Saturday and Sunday.  They stated it was not good for kids. I specifically booked this hotel so my six yo would be able to use the pool. ,4,2016,06,05
36,Great for extended stays,"We stayed for 8 nights and chose this hotel because of it's location and pool.  We travelled to see Coldplay at the Olympic stadium but wanted to stay longer to enjoy some warmth instead of the dull drab UK ""springtime"". We have been to Barcelona many times before so we didn't need to race around the sites like a normal citybreak.  The plan was to relax and chill during the day and enjoy the many things this city has to offer in the evening. Have to say this hotel was excellent on every level for doing just this. It is located right next to one of the largest shopping malls in the city, which also has a number of eateries, so if you fancy staying local that is also possible. Access to the city centre is very easy either by cab (5 minutes) or Metro (station is through the shopping mall). The 10 trip metro ticket for 9 euros was ideal for us. Regarding the hotel - all staff we met were super helpful and friendly (Claudia absolutely made our breakfasts). Nice lobby bar, great room, the Executive lounge has an outside terrace which was amazing and the Purobeach experience around the pool is fantastic (if a little hectic at weekends). We will definitely return on our next trip to Barcelona",5,2016,06,04
36,Great Modern Hotel near the Mediterranean ,My wife and I stayed here for two days after a guided tour of Portugal and Spain. It is a modern hotel at the far end of Barcelona in a nice new business area. It is right a cross the street from a three level shopping mall with many shops and restaurants including a food market. It is only a three minute walk to the beach. The nearby beaches have a walking path and beach bars/cafes. As Hilton Diamond members we were upgraded to a nice room on the 22nd floor with wonderful views out over the Mediterranean. The Executive Lounge on the 15th floor has a terrace with amazing views of the Mediterranean and the city. We could even see the Sagrada La Familia. The food and wine in the Executive Lounge was very good. ,5,2016,06,03
36,A good option for business travellers.,"Just came back from a quick 3 night business stay at Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona. 

It is a big, modern hotel, with all the facilities and services Hilton chain usually offers. Location is good, in a busy modern area of Barcelona, with the beach right in front and very good transport options nearby. There is a huge shopping center across the street with plenty of restaurants for all prices. A taxi trip to Sagrada Familia took us 10 minutes. 

The room was rather big and modern, and everything was perfectly clean. The bed was stunning and allowed us to get a good rest after our big journey. TV with plenty of channels and minibar with the usual stuff.
Bathroom was also very clean and pleasant, built in marble.
Fast wifi connection in the room (and around the hotel), but I am not sure if it is complimentary, because I always get free wifi on Hilton hotels due to my HHonors Gold card status.

Fitness center was extremely small and somewhat cramped. I decided to run on the beautiful Barcelona shore instead of using the treadmill. The pool was closed, it opens only in summer but in my opinion it wouldn't hurt to let the guests take a walk around the area, and opening the bar to serve some drinks.

Breakfast was great, with a lot of hot and cold options, and excellent natural juices. Sparkling wine was available for free. Few options for the kids. Also, a bit crowded on peak hour, with line up of people waiting for a table. Try to get there early (at least 1h30 before closing time).

The personnel was very kind and helpful, everywhere from the reception to the Restaurant.

Overall experience was good, the Hilton Diagonal assures the Hilton standards in a very professional way. I will probably return in my next Barcelona trip or stopover.",4,2016,06,03
36,As expected,"Good stay, with all the amenities you would expect. 

Nice bar downstairs and located centrally, with about 20-30 min drive to the airport. 

Gym located on the 6th floor with nice equipment (treadmills, bicycles etc.) and a couple of free weights.

Rooms are the std Hilton quality.

Service was fast, efficient and friendly  ",4,2016,06,02
36,Great hotel,If you are traveling to Barcelona I would highly recommend this hotel. The rooms are roomy and clean. The staff is fabulous. They are very professional and accommodating. There is a very nice mall just across the street. I wanted to see a Flamingo dance and the staff helped me get very nice tickets for dinner and the show. ,5,2016,06,01
36,When a Hilton stops being a Hilton when you stay,Hilton Barcelona Diagonal Mar no longer lets guests use the pool unless you pay the pool outsourced Co Purobeach a fee. staff admit the hotel is leaving the Hilton family. Hotel offers the PuroBeach customer. Spree room upgrades so no sleep on exec floors. Diamond Hhonors status does not help. Suspect over 50's pool will be fully booked 7 days a week. Only went to hotel to use pool. Probably will never stay at a Hilton again as cannot trust what the hotel will be like despite having a Hilton honours member for 16 years and Diamond.,1,2016,06,01
36,The staff is outstanding and made our stay in one of our favorite places even better. 10 minute on the subway from cente,Plan on staying here again. Away from the business and noise of the city center. We had oceanview room and it was wonderful to see the sun rise each morning. The hop on tour stop was next to hotel and Metro stop was a couple of blocks away. ,5,2016,05,31
36,"Great stay, pleasant stay!",Overall was a good experience specially the bar by the poolside was very relaxing. The staff at indigo restaurant were very friendly and welcoming. The conference facilities were up to date and well organised by the staff.,4,2016,05,30
36,Perfect!,"Went to the Hilton for business and extend my stay for pleasure.
Location is great, really easy to take the metro to the centre and walk to the beach. Staff is really friendly and helpfull. Quality of food and facilities is also really good. Had a great stay and would deffenately recommend this hotel!",5,2016,05,29
36,Great venue but lacking something,"Fantastic sea front venue, but the service was well below power, both at the Purobeach poolside venue, lobby bar and room service. Orders took much to long to be delivered, if they were provided at all and for a venue of this calibre, not really good enough. In our room the teas and coffees were not replenished etc.. For the cost and the Hilton brand, not good enough.",3,2016,05,29
36,"Thank You, Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona!","We stayed at this hotel for two nights before boarding our ship for a Mediterranean cruise.  We were treated like royalty from the moment we entered.  I mentioned that my luggage did not arrive and I was expecting it to be delivered the following day.  The lady at the desk asked to make a copy of the paper that was given to me by the airline.  She assured me she would handle making calls and seeing that my luggage was delivered before we left on our cruise.  She followed up with updates later that evening, and my luggage was delivered to my room the next morning.  This was an unexpected service that was much appreciated!

We are Hilton HHonors gold members and were upgraded to the executive floors and given use of the executive lounge.  This was a great bonus after traveling many hours to reach our destination.  We could wait in comfort until our rooms became available, and enjoy breakfast, snacks, and evening reception privileges.  What a great welcome to Barcelona!

We were more than satisfied with the clean and comfortable accommodations. The location was perfect for shopping, transportation, and being away from some of the city noise.  If we have the opportunity to travel to Barcelona again, this will definitely be our hotel of choice. 

A special thanks goes to Abdelhak Douah for his attentive service and the beautiful bowl of fruit delivered to our room!  We greatly appreciate the great service, and enjoyed our visit to your beautiful city!",5,2016,05,27
36,My experience at Hilton,"Hilton is an excellent hotel, strategically located close to business and leisure venues. However, they need to be more welcoming to all people. Food needs to have a better presentation and higher variety.  ",3,2016,05,26
36,"Excellent location, clean and modern hotel","Very close to the beach, shopping and is very modern looking. Excellent dining and breakfast area and food selection. The front desk also helps you with city tour bus. The only downside is the bed - not very comfortable like other Hilton properties.",5,2016,05,25
36,Beware of Pool Parties,"The hotel in general was fine.  100% a business hotel, but friendly staff on main reception and rooms were adequate.  However....... hotel guests are made to feel like second like citizens at the pool area, especially if they have a function, which when we were there this weekend they had one on the Saturday and Sunday (we were only there 3 days).  The staff are quite rude and VERY dismissive of hotel guests in favour of people attending the parties.  I ordered a Mojito, to then be told that I could only order beer or wine because they were busy.  Seconds later 3 mojitos passed me for people attending the party.  You are literally asked to leave an hour before the party starts.  I don't know what the answer to this is, maybe keep a section for hotel guests?  Also, don't order the popcorn chicken unless you like heaps and heaps of SALT.    Its a shame as the pool area is lovely, but beware as a hotel guest, you are not really welcome.",3,2016,05,25
36,Good choice for business trip,"I've been a whole week for a congress within the hotel. Friendly staff, nice rooms, fast wifi. Far away from downtown. 5 min. Walking from the seashore. Nice commercial center just crossing the street. Good choice for business trips",3,2016,05,25
36,"Great location, but that's all","I booked this hotel for 11 nights, and when  I checked-in I told the reception I would have left 1 night in advance.
10 days later, at check out, I was charged one night penalty: ridiculous. 
Wrong authorization charges on my credit card: any tentative to resolve the issue was useless, as the staff at the reception was, which is by the way not very polite either. I would never stay at that hotel again and I am emailing sales ops at my company to advise against booking there in future.

36,Great place to stay while visiting Barcelona,My wife and I stayed at the Hilton Diagonal Mar while on vacation in Barcelona - near a subway station - staff was very helpful - great bar and restaurant - we had use of the Executive Lounge - wonderful breakfast - our room overlooked the water,5,2016,05,23
36,Business hotel,"Location ok for business trip, quite far away from downtown. Service at reception was poor. The shopping mall in beside the hotel is a good advantage. Barcelona is an attractive destination both for business and vacation.",3,2016,05,22
36,Worst manners ever,I tried to get a room and a guy in the door just kicked me out with bad manners and  without asking... It was the worst experience ever. Now I'll have to look some other hotel; I thought better about Hilton I will think it twice before coming back...,1,2016,05,21
36,Loved this property,"Though it is away from city centre, the trade off is its proximity to the beach and promenade.  Getting to the city is easy, so I will stay here again. The rooms are large for European hotels (roughly standard size of US hotels).",5,2016,05,21
36,Enjoyable stay before our cruise,This is a great hotel in a very convenient location to the harbor. The staff is friendly and helpful. The restaurant has an excellent buffet breakfast and the lobby bar has a nice evening vibe. We stayed in a Junior Suite and it was clean and comfortable and easily fi the 3 of us. If I visit Barcelona again I will certainly consider this hotel.,5,2016,05,20
36,The Executive Club made this a great break,"I took my 92 year old mother for a four day break and booked through BA. The option to pay extra for the executive club meant that we were close to evening drinks, breakfast and lovely ocean views from the balcony.

The hotel had a large conference at the time which meant that check in and finding an elevator was busy at times.

Staff were very helpful as I had a wheelchair to manipulate.

The rooms were not very old person friendly, shower in the bath and very low chairs but beds were comfortable and room spacious.

Location is not very central but it is on the tourist bus route which is useful, the shopping centre across the road is good. We also had two excellent meals in the restaurant.",4,2016,05,20
36,Hilton Quality,"I stayed in May 2016. I was on the 15th floor, which is on the Executive level, so each morning I had breakfast and there was a manager's reception each evening.  Breakfast included eggs, bacon, fruit, cereal, pastries, etc.  The food in the evening is generous and twice I made it my dinner.  The hotel is walking distance to the beach and the Metro.  I had a great view of the ocean.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  There are two Hilton Diagnals.  This one is Hilton Diagonal del Mar (on the ocean).  It was my preference to stay at the Hilton on the beach rather than the one in town.  I plan on returning to this hotel.",5,2016,05,19
36,Excellent Stay,"We stayed at this hotel as part of a Grand Prix package and found it to be a very pleasant stay. Excellent, clean rooms and the staff were wonderful. I recommend it to anyone looking for a hotel in Barcelona. Close to the beach and the city sights are not far away by Metro line.",5,2016,05,19
36,Great location and customer service,large hotel room cleaned meticulously daily.  Great location opposite shopping plaza and great restaurants.  5 mins walk to beach.  5 minutes walk to public transport to take you anywhere at a reasonable cost.  Hotel staff very professional and helpful.  Executive lounge the best of any Hilton hotels that we have stayed at.  Great outdoor patio too.  Would return to Barcelona and this Hilton hotel in a heartbeat.  Not cheap but you definitely get what you pay for.  Highly recommended.,5,2016,05,19
36,Excellent ,"I'm currently staying at this hotel, what can I say ? Well all the staff are extremely friendly and courteous. This hotel is part of a huge chain obviously, but it has a family atmosphere. I feel I need to say a big thank you to Cris on reception for all his help on facilitating entry for the truck and for my swift check in , he's a true professional. And another huge thank you to Elisa in Indigo Restaurant, her fantastic smile and lovely nature made breakfast an absolute joy ! 

Thank you Hilton Diagonal Mar",5,2016,05,19
36,Jacuzzi in executive room is a must,"Booked 3 nights here in early March, hotel is located just slightly outside the town which is perfect for me as I can escape the hustle and bustle and come back to a more relaxed area.
The hotel is massive and has 23 floors and 4 lifts. It is a busy hotel and almost every time we went out there was always a long line of people either checking in and out, however you don’t tend to bump into people that often around the grounds and floors. Staff were friendly and assisted promptly when we brought something to their attention.
 
We had a standard room which was very comfortable with sea view on the 12th floor, there are two buildings in front of the hotel that slightly restrict the view. For the last two nights we decided to treat ourselves and asked for an upgrade to one of the executive rooms, we were lucky enough to get a room in the presidential suite section on the 22nd floor which comes with a huge bathroom area consisting of a Jacuzzi (amazing), standalone shower and mini TV screen. This bedroom probably has the best view as it’s on the corner of the hotel so you get both City and sea view. There were times when I would just stand in the room and gaze out the windows mesmerised by the view which even captures Sagrada familia.
 
The breakfast selection area has a lot of variety including, eggs, omelette station, cured meats, freshly squeezed juice and more pastries and cakes then I have seen for a breakfast buffet. The sitting area is also massive and seats tables of 4 so there was always more than enough space.
 
Wasn’t overly impressed with the executive lounge, selections of drinks were ok but the pastries seemed like the leftovers from breakfast. I will say the executive lounge is handy for quick checkouts avoiding potentially ques on ground reception.
 
The fridges are automated, meaning if you move a drink or anything accidentally falls out it will automatically get added to your bill but will be adjusted if you tell them at checkout. Mrs said the hair dryers in the standard room were better than the executive ones, something about having to simultaneously press two buttons at the same time to get hot air blowing through.
 
Amazing transport links, 7 mins walk to the metro station and Tram stop around the corner which takes you all the way to the zoo. You can actually get the Renfe and Metro from the airport to the Hotel for less than 1 euro using a T10 card. There is also a big mall Diagonal Mar across the streets with restaurant’s on the terrace and a huge supermarket called Alcampo.
 
All in all, a lovely stay.",4,2016,05,18
36,"Good, clean and comfortable","Lovely staff, very helpful and English languge is widely spoken. Resturants were very good, meals were very tasty, and the waiting staff didn't hover, which I found was great. I really liked the facilities on site, although being a brief business trip, didn't have any time to try them. Recommended from a business aspect.This hotel is set in the commercial area of Barcelona, not where I would go for a holiday on the beach!",4,2016,05,18
36,Does everyting you want,"Stayed for long weekend while visiting for Spanish F1 GP. All facilities you would expect from Hilton at this grade Hotel.  Taxi into City Centre, which is less then 15 mins away, is about 10 Euros. Large shopping/dining complex directly across the road really handy.",5,2016,05,18
36,Excellent,"Great location, huge property. Huge shopping centre across the road with lots of restaurants to choose from.  Room was very quiet and spacious. Executive lounge was great. Staff was extremely helpful. Restaurants at the hotel was outstanding. Beach is a few minutes walk. Lovely pool. Tram stop nearby. Can't wait to come back to this wonderful city.",5,2016,05,18
36,Hilton Diagonal Mar,"We stayed in this convention-style Hilton for five days following a European cruise that terminated in Barcelona.  It is convenient to a shopping mall across the street, and is a 10 minute walk to the subway and 15 minute ride to downtown.  The common areas are in need of a facelift.  Fresh paint and carpet in the common hallways would help.  Our room could use a new carpet as well.  The staff was excellent and very helpful.  We only had breakfast and it was a wholly satisfying buffet-style affair.",4,2016,05,17
36,Review,"Great hotel, like a 5 star, the staff were so friendly and assistive, rooms were spacious and clean with great view, near see and right in front of diagonal mar, breakfast was awesome 

But location!! It was too far from the airport and also from city center..",5,2016,05,17
36,Hotel Diagonal Mar,"This hotel for a Hilton brand was poor, the music was too loud by pool till 01:30 am even with windows closed on 21st floor. And the plumbing was like a fight train in your room every hour. Hilton need to start to pay attention to voice of the customer as small things like lack of sleep generally spoil any stay.",2,2016,05,16
36,Great stay !,"Great staff, great place, great breakfast, great room ... Thank you ! The hotel has a great situation next to the subway . We were warmly welcomed. Our room was large and nice. All the hotel staff is smily . The buffet breakfast was so huge that we didn't get the chance to try everything :) We recommend the Hilton Diagonal Mar!",5,2016,05,16
36,Simply Awesome,"A very nice property with great sea and city views. The exec rooms are great. The pool and purobeach area is really nice, as is the exec lounge where there is good food and drink available. The best feature of the hotel however is the staff. All the staff are so friendly and can't do enough to help, for example the main restaurant staff at breakfast, the exec lounge staff, the Pistachio bar staff, guest services etc etc. All fantastic. I'd stay here again without question, one of the best Hiltons for sure!",5,2016,05,16
36,Nice but expensive,"It is very ideal for conference in CCIB. The mall adjacent to the hotel is a plus. The rooms are really nice, clean and spacious  ( reason for my overall rating) The breakfast in the lounge is good but would be better if it is not the same everyday. Most staff are nice but some shows no sincere willingness to help.😔 And for that reason, it is expensive for its rate. ",4,2016,05,15
36,Bug Infestation,"Sequence of events:
1) Checked in and was told that our luggage would be sent up to our room.  30 minutes later, still waiting on luggage.  We had to call the front desk (call #1) and remind them that we were waiting on our luggage. 

2) Sat on the bed and a few moments later, I was scratching my hand.  I looked on the nightstand next to the bed and saw a bug that obviously bit me because it was completely engorged and crawling on my papers.  After I killed it, we looked it up and found out that they were bed bugs.

I called at the front desk (call #2) and told them that a bed bug bit me.  10 minutes later, nobody shows up.  In the meantime, we are using our cell phone flashlights and inspecting for others.  2 more live bugs come out of the headboard (pictures below), still no sign of hotel staff.  I called to the front desk again (call#3) and was told that they were following procedure and will be up shortly.  I informed her that we had found 3 live bugs and we have already moved out into the hallway with our luggage and that somebody from the hotel staff needs to come up to our room and deal with what is now an infestation.  I told them that I am on my way to the front desk.  That’s when hotel staff appeared and met me on the way to the go downstairs to the front desk.  Once inside the room, there were even more bugs crawling on the wall from the headboard. Members of the staff used a glass and collected some of the bugs for further identification.  I showed them the bite on my hand, now red and swollen from scratching.  Once the staff witnessed the bugs for themselves, then we were taken seriously and moved to another room and the staff inspected the new room for any bedbugs.  At my request, the beds in the new room were moved away from the headboard and the musty fabric chair was removed and replaced with metal chairs.

I prepaid in full for the room weeks in advance and was told that the cost of my room will be refunded to me.  I didn’t get a full refund. My nerves were shot, so I ordered drinks to calm my nerves, which were supposed to be complimentary, but I was charged for those also.  The front desk supervisor mentioned that the front office manager was going to contact me. That was Sunday...as of today (Wed), still no response from the manager. I have yet to see my room refunded and I also have an additional pending charge on my account that I didn’t make. 

Thankfully, we didn’t unpack anything when the bed bugs appeared so I don’t think we took any home with us (fingers crossed).  If you plan to stay here, make sure you check your room for bed bugs and launder your clothes as soon as you get home to avoid an infestation. 

After I got bitten and called the 1st time to the front desk, somebody should have come up to inspect our room, and not have us call back multiple times. I expect better service than this from this caliber of hotel.  Not only for honors members, like myself, but for other guests as well.  

Update:
After I submitted the satisfaction survey and expressed my dissatisfaction, I got an email from the manager saying that what was in our room were warm weather flies, which is not true.  I understand that the hotel has to play down the fact that they have a bed bug infestation, but warm weather flies?  We took pictures and… 
-     These flies didn’t have wings. How can “flies” not have wings?
-	I was bitten by one of these “flies”.  Since when do flies bite and leave red itchy marks?
-	These “flies” were found coming from behind the headboard and on the nightstand.

I was given the rest of my refund that was promised and was given extra points, so the matter has been resolved.  Thankfully, we didn’t have any bed bugs hitch a ride with us back home.",1,2016,05,14
36,A superb hotel in all aspects,"I stayed at Hilton Diagonal Mar for 5 nights for a conference. It is not common to find everything at an hotel to full satisfaction and with a kind attentive personal touch from all the staaf - this was simply a beuriful experience, I warmly recommend this hotel, in particluar if you are conferencing at the conference centre next door.",5,2016,05,14
36,barcelona diagonal mar,"wonderful service, excellent location, comfortable beds, super clean! the cleanliness of this hotel is great, close to the shopping mall and great locatio for the tourist bus stop, close to the subway etc",5,2016,05,13
36,Meh! Average at best! Front desk staff needs customer service & quality training! Watch out for twin-bed room switch!,"Front desk staff fell a little short on customer service. I have Silver status with Hilton and used my Hilton-Honors American-Express CC which I thought might afford a room upgrade. Maybe not!
     In fact, girl at check-in said, ""we have you in an executive room on the 21st floor"". Ha! What a joke!  Room had two tiny twin beds versus King bed. How does a 6 foot-plus guy sleep in a tiny child bed.  And that is an executive suite?  Noting ""suite"" about it!  Just a trick on their part!  I complained but got nowhere, ""sorry sir, we are full"".  
     At this point I requested access to the concierge lounge (15th floor) as compensation for the Twin bed issue - and the front desk guy said he must check with his supervisor - so he disappeared for 5 minutes and came back with a NO! Really? Too bad for them as I sneaked into the concierge lounge anyway as nobody was attending the unlocked door to it. Good place for a light breakfast and some coffee.
     The room had wood floors which is a nice change from carpet, some long black hairs in the bathroom (I am bald), and noisy hearing next door doors slam.
    Elevators a tad slow - not sure if all of them were working.  Could use better shower pressure.  Cool up-raised sink - but causes excessive water splash to surrounding area.",3,2016,05,12
36,Average,"Nothing else to say
The location is great but there is a big need for better food at the lounge 
Make room available for costumer from overseas 
Internet is slow 
The gym need to be be renew and Mir space with more machines ",3,2016,05,11
36,Birthday Celebration Weekend,"I love Barcelona and spent a lovely weekend there last November with my husband. We had a great stay although the weather was a little windy 🌬
We were looking for a city break this April as both my husband and my sister had upcoming birthdays. 
Although my husband had attended conferences nearby he had never stayed in this hilton so we were excited to try it.
From the moment we checked in I could see we had made the right choice.
The front desk staff were friendly and efficient and as a Hilton Diamond member we received a great corner room with beautiful views over the city.
I honestly can't fault the room and as an extra touch  some cake and a bottle of cava were provided on my husbands birthday.
Breakfast was good with a reasonable selection of food on offer. We didn't dine in the hotel but the food sounded lovely. 

The hotel location is great. It is across the road from a large shopping mall with all the major shops and restaurants.  The tourist hop on bus stops accross from the hotel. The beach is a short walk and the area feels safe to wander around. It is about a 30 min walk into the centre along the beach paving via the Olympic port and with the sun shining it was a lovely journey. Plenty of bars and beach clubs on the way.
I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking to visit Barcelona.  I only saw the pool from the 15th floor executive lounge terrace( amazing views of the city and sea) but it looked lovely and I could see myself relaxing there when the temperature improves. 
I will definitely be returning to this Hilton on my next visit to Barcelona.",5,2016,05,11
36,First Stay in Barcelona,"From the moment we arrived until we reluctantly left we had a really enjoyable stay.  The staff were very pleasant.  The room we were allocated was on the 23rd floor with fantastic views over Barcelona city centre and out to sea.  The bathroom window even had a great view!  The executive lounge was very well stocked each evening with a great choice of drinks and snacks.  Breakfast, even though not offering many hot choices, was also good.  We would definitely recommend the hotel and hope to return one day.",5,2016,05,10
36,Ladies weekend at Hilton Barcelona,"I stayed here with friends this weekend and cannot rate the service highly enough. Although a couple of things went wrong the staff were so quick to fix it. The politeness and helpfulness of all the staff was exceptional. 
I would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay here again.  It was a short metro ride to the city centre (cost 1 euro).  
The rooms were light and airy and the beds very comfortable.
Breakfast was plentiful and tasty. The nearby shopping centre is also a great way to spend a few hours.",5,2016,05,09
36,Very nice hotel and pleasant staff,"We didn't realise how further out from the town centre this hotel was situated but it was not a problem.  The shopping mall opposite was great and if you walk through it, the nearest metro station can be found on the other side.  Its a short walk to the beach and that is really nice.
The rooms and facilities were good.  We stayed during first weekend of May so it was too windy and not warm enough to use the pool.  Do visit the bar as the barman is very helpful and makes some lovely drinks. 
The only down side is that our room faced the sea and we can hear the funfair park each night with its music and announcements blaring out.  If you are above the 15th floor and took advantage of the executive lounge for breakfast, then during weekdays, you can be a little disappointed.  Obviously business travellers use this and during week days, the food was slow in being topped up and tables were not cleared up.",4,2016,05,09
36,Excellent with beach on door step,"Although essentially a business hotel we like it as very close too the beach and only a short bus or train ride to centre of town. Staff are very friendly and attentive. The breakfast is wonderful and could set you up for the day.  We had dinner at the Indigo Symphony Restaurant on Saturday night and could not fault either the food or service. Unfortunately it has rained for the five days we are here but, with a shopping mall across the way and the Metro only a short walk away, there was no problem finding a museum / tapas bar to visit.",5,2016,05,09
36,Yes-definitely!,"Through the years I've stayed at this hotel many many times. It never fails to deliver. The best things about this hotel are the executive lounge overlooking the Mediterranean Sea, The large pool, and the close proximity to some of the beaches. This is not centrally located but if you're willing to take Uber or a taxi or other forms of transport you can get into the Gothic area and central Barcelona without any problems.",4,2016,05,07
36,very good hotel,"Perfect location close to the  the sea and a big mall.Clean, calm rooms... beautiful views specially the sea view. Cooperative  staff specially TONI who was very helpful and also was LEON. Wide spacious rooms with clean and modern bath.",4,2016,05,05
36,"OK, But Not Quite Up to Hilton Standards","The Hilton Diagonal del Mar is clearly focused on business travelers.  As a tourist, it was a bit disappointing to find no dedicated concierge.  The front desk staff fills that role and does it well, but you are always a bit concerned that you are holding up someone wanting to check in.  That nit picked, on to a review.

We checked in very early, having arrived from a cruise ship.  There was no bell staff at the curb, so we hauled our bags into the lobby.  There was also no bell staff when we checked out.  A room was available and an upgrade based on Gold status was provided.  Front desk staff was very helpful and a pleasure to meet. Our room was clean and ready for occupancy - pretty much.  Missing were a hair dryer and an ice bucket, small things but necessitating a call to get them. Housekeeping seems to need some attention.  On subsequent days water was left in the ice bucket and the hot water kettle when the room was cleaned - again, little stuff, but just enough inattention to get your attention.  Our room had one lounge chair and an office chair.  It seemed clearly designed for a single business traveler.  Wi Fi and wired internet worked well.  English channels on the TV didn't work on our first (weekend) day.  Throughout our stay, front desk and executive lounge staff were uniformly friendly and helpful.  

While not focused on tourists, the hotel is in a good location to catch the subway and city tour buses.  The location near the beach provides beautiful views and the opportunity to enjoy being outside.  The views - both city and ocean - from the hotel are beautiful. There is a big mall just across the street from the hotel with many food options.  We didn't get a chance to use the hotel restaurant. The sheets were not quite big enough for the king bed.

If you are doing business in the area, recommend this hotel.  If you are in Barcelona with spouse or family, stay elsewhere.",4,2016,05,05
36,Top Notch!!!,"Wow! - what a place to stay...wonderful hotel with and equally wonderful staff. 
Its situated perfectly out of the hustle... with a beach and a shopping mall just at an stone's throw. The food and staff is just wonderful...specially the staff during the morning breakfast...have never seen such prompt ppl.....it makes the breakfast far more tastier.
The rooms are good and do justice to the amount charged.
A good place to stay by any means!",5,2016,05,02
36,Excellent,"Perfect location close to the beach, a mall, and public transportation. Not on the Rambla though, which was actually a bonus as it was quiter. Access to rambla was pretty easy though. 
Rooms were very good with a spectacular sea view. Club lounge was excellent. Service great and very friendly. 
Highly recommended for sinhkes or families",5,2016,04,30
36,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona is the place to be,"I was at Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona with my family on a short trip and totally enjoyed my stay there. Hotel is just 5 mins walk from the beach, right opposite to a big shopping centre and around 10 mins walk from Metro/tram station. I got a higher floor upon request and the view of sea from our room was amazing. If Barcelona is a vibrant, friendly and lovely city, Hilton Diagonal Mar is cherry on the top.   Highly recommended for anyone visiting Barcelona.",5,2016,04,30
36,Great experience,"we booked in Hilton Diagnonal Mar Barcelona for 4 nights in April.It was a wonderful experience.The location of the hotel is perfect, had a room overlooking the sea which was so refreshing and beautiful.The hotel staff is excellent, very helpful, good breakfast and room service.The mall across the hotel was extremely convienient.Also there was a stop for the hop on hop off tour bus very close to the hotel which helped us doing our sightseeing very easily. Overall we had a wonderful stay at Hilton Diagonal Mar and sure looking forward to staying there once again.",5,2016,04,30
36,Good Experience,"I stayed only one night. Hilton quality. View was facing the city, quite far from the center but near the Sea. Across the street there is a small shopping center with some restaurants. Used the parking at the basement, which is not free.",4,2016,04,29
36,Amazing Hotel! Wonderful experience!,"I booked a 3 night break to Barcelona as a wedding anniversary gift for my parents. On their return, they described their experience as ""out of this world"" and were absolutely delighted with their stay in the Hilton! The hotel organised a surprise bottle of champagne, and cake on their first night there as an anniversary present and my parents had the pleasure of staying in a sea view room! The breakfast was absolutely delicious, and the staff were very warm, welcoming and friendly. My parents have had a wonderful experience in this hotel, and I would like to say a special thanks to Maribel for making their experience so memorable. I would highly recommend this hotel to everyone!",5,2016,04,28
36,Great Choice for a Stay in Barcelona,"We stayed 4 nights at the Hilton Diaganol Barcelona. When we booked we were a little concerned as it was a ways from the city center.  We shouldn't have been.  First, the taxi ride from the airport was quick (under 20 minutes) and cost 27.95 to the hotel and 35.80 from...not sure why to the airport was more as we left on Sunday morning with very little traffic.  The metro was a short 5 minute walk to the airport.  We took advantage of the T-10 metro tickets for 9.95 Euros (as opposed to the 2.15 single ticket price) and the L-3 line whisked us to our destinations in a clean, easy to use environment.  We checked in around 11:30 and our room was ready. We really appreciated that.  Bruno at the front desk patiently went over maps and information with us, orienting us to the city and our environs.  Our room was on the fifth floor and very comfortable.  It came with a kettle and coffee maker, a efficient air conditioning, good WiFi, and quiet from the city. The hotel location is in a really nice, clean neighborhood with interesting shops and restaurants.  We had access to the executive lounge where we enjoyed tapas and a great tasting red wine and beer from 18:00 to 20:00.   Breakfast in the lounge was okay for a quick bite; however, we opted for the complimentary breakfast buffet (for gold Hhonors members) downstairs which we really enjoyed. It included eggs, bacon and beans (British) along with a nice salad bar.  I would suggest more fresh fruit instead of the canned variety.  All in all, this hotel provided a quiet oasis and easy access to this wonderful city.  We will definitely stay here when we return.",5,2016,04,28
36,Good Business hotel,"I spent 2 nights here, its not faraway from the Centre, even with taxi its just less then 10euros. Rooms are standard not fresh but still OK. Bars are expensive so i recommend rather pass the street and save money. Breakfast was nothing speciál.",4,2016,04,27
36,EXCELLENT CHOICE,"far for center,near beach,excellent overall treatment,nice pool,good bar,very good breakfast. Specially for business and for families and specially for beach lovers and for shoppers( very nice shopping center just next door)",5,2016,04,25
36,Great hotel,"Just got back from a two night stay and would definitely recommend this place to others. I had a room on the 17th floor facing the ocean which was very pleasant to look at. The hotel is right next to a large shopping center which has a great food court and a large supermarket. Hotel is right next to to the beach and has great transport links. Metro is a 5 minute walk or you can walk about 2 minutes to the bus stop that takes you to la rambles.

I feel this hotel is good because I was away from the tourist areas so it was peaceful but at the same time I could be within the tourist areas in about 20 minutes. Breakfast as beautiful with a huge selection of dishes.

My only criticism of the hotel is that they don't give you free water. For the amount of money you pay for the room you'd expect a few bottles to be included. It wasn't an issue as there's a supermarket across the road which pretty much sells everything. 

Due to its location I didn't actually get a taxi once. Purchased a 3 day travel pass and with this I was able to go everywhere. Area felt very safe",5,2016,04,25
36,Worth the trip,"This was my fourth trip to Barcelona and I found this to be a great hotel just outside the city, so quieter than normal. Service was excellent and local knowledge passed on to us saved us time and money, so ask the team to help you out with tourist questions.",5,2016,04,25
36,Amazing birthday celebration!,"I came here to celebrate my best friends birthday and we couldn't have chosen a better hotel! It is well designed, spacious and of high quality. The real treat was the staff! The men at the front reception were helpful, charming, funny and very very welcoming. The rest of the staff who we met at breakfast, dinner and generally throughout our stay were amazing! Everyone was very enthusiastic, friendly and helpful. We looked forward to seeing them and whatever we needed was catered to. I cannot fault their professionalism and dedication to their job. Really lovely people. 

We had breakfast included which had a large variety of food and the surroundings were spacious, well designed and well presented. Travel was made easy as there was a bus stop around the corner and the beach is less than 10 minutes away by walk. The mall is right outside which is very convenient and so is a Santander bank. 

All in all my friends and I loved it. We are already making plans to come back to Barcelona and will be choosing this hotel again. Thank you for allowing my best friend to have an amazing time!",5,2016,04,24
36,Birthday trip to Barcelona,"This hotel was amazing, I cannot fault any of the employees - they made our trip! From the front desk to housekeeping everyone was friendly, enthusiastic and welcoming, everything we needed was catered to. 

Our booking included breakfast and every morning we enjoyed a variety of food and drinks. The staff were very attentive and made sure we were taken care of. 

It is very close to the beach, it took less than 10 minutes to walk up there and there is a bus stop a few minutes away that can take you into the city centre. 

I cannot recommend this hotel enough we will definitely be visiting Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona again!",5,2016,04,24
36,In general: excellent,"I have nothing but congratulations and positive comments about the hotel, location and staff. Great place, I recommend it. Some of the guys have some issues to understand or speak english but, we are in Barcelona, so VAMOS!!",5,2016,04,23
36,MR Noorani ,"Stayed on the 18th April 2016 for one night and was very disappointed .No bottle water was provided in the rooms yet the tea bags and coffee was available.i called the reception and was told that the bottles of water have to be purchased at 5.50 euros or I use the tap water as it is drinkable.secondly I was charged 30 euros for parking for one day.I would rather have stayed in a five star ,much superior hotel where all this would have been provided at no cost. I have stayed in much better hotels in Barcelona and all was provided.It is silly not to keep bottle water for the guests.😠😠
",3,2016,04,21
36,Very well located and good service,The hotel is located in a nice area of Barcelona with good service and nice accommodation. We had a wonderful time there and even though we were there for convention we enjoyed been there. We were in a group of people from 40 international countries and everybody had a good time at hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona.,4,2016,04,21
36,Brilliant hotel,Can't complain at all about the hotel. Wonderful location and fantastic facilities. The staff couldn't do enough. The executive lounge is splendid and has an outdoor seating area which overlooks the beach. Nice and quiet location and the centre of Barcelona is only a short taxi ride away.,5,2016,04,19
36,Business trip,"Excellent hotel, friendly staff and excellent amenities. Bar was fine. Location excellent. Front desk staff were prompt and excellent. Breakfast was great. only meal we had there. Great views . Close to the beach . Near to the shops",5,2016,04,19
36,Good hotel,"Everything was ok. There are some areas to improve. Breakfast was excellent, staff very kind but some areas such as fitness center and the swiming pool have to be improved. Last day the said that the didn't have the System to add my stay to my account ",3,2016,04,18
36,Great Hotel and Staff!,"The staff went above and beyond and were so accommodating.  The hotel was exceptionally clean and one of the best Hilton's I have ever stayed in.  I HIGHLY recommend to anyone!  The other family I was traveling with was so impressed, they decided to become Hilton Honors members on the spot.  Well done Hilton team, this is the exact reason I continue to have loyalty to the Hilton brand hotels.",5,2016,04,17
36,Wonderful Stay,"Having read several not great reviews prior to our trip I was concerned about the hotel. Complaints about the rude staff and slow internet were disconcerting, however we decided to book because with Hilton points I only had to pay the tax for the stay.
We got in early after our morning tour coming off a T/A cruise from Ft. Lauderdale  the room was ready.  Not bragging but as a Hilton Gold member we were given a corner room on the 23rd floor.  Room was very large and modern, comfortable bed and the bathroom had both a tub and stall shower.  The complimentary wi-fi is slow, but there is an ethernet cable in each room.  I hooked up my laptop via the cable and got acceptable speed for e-mail etc. ( I ran a speed test at one mb/sec) 
  Previous reviews mentioned rude front desk staff.  We did not find this to be the case,  every staff member was very polite and helpful getting us tickets for some of the sites we wished to see. 
  Having access to the executive lounge, breakfast consisted of scrambled eggs and bacon, danish, cheeses cold meats, fruit hot and cold cereal, breads and cake.  Juice and coffees were available.   In the evening a nice spread was also available from 6pm  to 8pm with wine or beer, hot tapas, cold tapas, deserts and even complimentary hard liquor.  
  If you wanted to go out for food there was a shopping mall across the street which had 48 different food venues. 
  Subway stop was 2 blocks away and the system is very easy to use to get around.  
We were very sorry to leave to come home as it was such a wonderful stay.  When we come back to Barcelona we will definitely stay at this property again.
  The hotel has adapters available but if you have a lot of electronics you can obtain adapters inexpensively.  All of our phones, computer, chargers all work 115/250 volts so I brought the two prong adapters and only had to borrow 1 3 prong adapter from the hotel.",5,2016,04,17
36,Wonderful stay,"The Hilton Diagonal Mar is nicely located a few minutes walk from the beach.  The walk along the boardwalk is quite extensive and interesting with children enjoying the numbers playgrounds, volleyball games ensuing and Barcelonians enjoying their beautiful beach (swimming with wet suits as this was April). We had a lovely walk to nearby restaurants.  The staff at the Hilton was superb.  They were quite welcoming , helpful and friendly during our stay.  We were on the 13th floor with a view of the city and partial ocean.  The  room was spacious with bed and lounge chair both extremely comfortable.  When back in Barcelona we would op to stay again at this hotel.",5,2016,04,17
36,"Fantastic location, top class hotel","Very convenient location in modern business district of Barcelona also two hundred yards from the beach and also excellent connection to the city center. Fantastic views from almost every room of the hotel. Some have a beach view, some have Barcelona views (which I personally prefer). Nice bar and chose of wine, sometimes live music in the lounge. Good restaurant with good quality local and continental food.",5,2016,04,17
36,Excellent time at Hilton,"We choose Hilton hotel and we knew it is a little far from points of view, but for sure i would make the same choice. 
It was awesome. Everything.
We got a room with the view to the sea, it was nice in the morning the sun shining in the water. 
Spacious and clean rooms, comfortable beds, safe box and mini fridge available. Jacuzzi with television is more than we expected. 
Even the hotel has lots of rooms there is enough place for food area. Plenty of delicious and tasty food we had for breakfast.
Free wi-fi working good.
The hotel is 5 min walking from the beach, in front there is a shopping center and at the corner there is a taxi station. Also bus station is 2-5 min. walking ( depends which route ).
The staff of the hotel is helpful and professional, always there if you need them.
There is also a swimming pool outside available and a sauna at top levels .
Good wines and coffee at the lobby bar.
I highly recommend this hotel, i enjoyed every moment and for sure next stay it will be at Hilton Diagonal Mar. 
",5,2016,04,15
36,Excellent stay by the beach in Barcelona,This our second stay at this hotel and we were not disappointed. We had a lovely room on the 22nd floor (it is worth paying for a sea view) with access to the Executive Lounge.  Breakfast was exceptional with a wide selection of items including regional specialities and freshly cooked omelettes. After a busy day of sightseeing in Barcelona it is great place to come back to for some rest and relaxation.  ,5,2016,04,14
36,Great hotel in Barcelona,"Hilton is always a safe choise when you travel
this hotel is not in the city center but has metro station and 2 bus stations within a few minutes walk. Bus # 7 will take you to the Camp Nou, Casa Mila, Casa Bastilo, and many other attractions. Bus # H16 will take you to the Triumph arch, Catalonia plaza, La rambla and many other good spots.  Also Diagonal Mar shopping center will provide you many restaurants  
and shops just across the road",4,2016,04,14
36,Football Match,Excellent location for Nou Camp. Really great staff. Prepared a nice off menu supper for us and provided accurate travel directions. Clean modern rooms with great bathrooms with walk in showers. Taxi rank just outside and bus stop not far. Beside shopping centre. Highly recommended. ,5,2016,04,08
36,Excellent - location and service are tops!,"One of the best Hilton properties I have stayed in. Location can not be beat - the sea is right outside the window, as are the mountains. Everything is easy to get to from this location. The staff and service were some of the best I have ever experienced... not only at Hilton, but even better than some higher end brands. Good job guys.",5,2016,04,06
36,Extraordinary service culture,"From check-in to executive lounge we experienced a truly great service that made our stay in this hotel a pure pleasure and will make us come back soon. 

Especially during high season (Easter) it feels relaxing being a little bit outside the city center but steps away from the beach and still in walking distance to the old town.",5,2016,04,05
36,simply too expensive for the quality - awful breakfast,"Stayed here for work and was very disappointed. This hotel is simply too expensive and not worth the price.  Give the breakfast a miss since it was very low quality and not at all fresh, even if they offer a reduced price coupon, you can eat better anywhere else!  too bad! Room was ok, not in centre but was close to my office. I will stay at another hotel next time.",1,2016,04,03
36,Perfect hotel,"Again: excellent location- the beach, the Diagonal mar shopping center...friendly, english speaking staff, extremely well educated. 
Spatious rooms, clean, well maintained, great view. Great buffet breakfast- excellent selection of
food.
Had dinner in their Indigo restaurant- baby lamb with rosemary and honey is a must! 
An absolute winner in BCN

P.S. Dont forget to buy charity ducks! ",5,2016,04,03
36,Wonderful hotel,Super friendly and clean. Right across the street from a huge shopping mall with terrific restaurants and movie theatre. I love this location because it's quiet . You will need to ride the taxi to the sights. Each way approx 10.00 euros. Both city and water views are terrific. There is an Executive lounge but I did not use it. It's more fun to hang in the lobby restaurant which is open an always chock full of people. Barcelona is a wonderful city and you will certainly be rested and relaxed at this location. Food is excellent and service is top quality. I would recommend to everyone.,5,2016,04,01
36,One of the best Hiltons I have stopped in,"It may not be the best looking or !ost glamorous of Hiltons but it makes up in many other ways.  Every member of staff was nothing but helpful, polite and all round nice.  The breakfast was superb, so many choices and variety.  The view over the city is great at night.  It has a shopping centre across the road with many restaurants.  Transport links into the city centre are plentiful and very frequent bus, tram and underground. It was only 35euros to the airport.  ",5,2016,03,31
36,A Hotel That Has It All,"We have stayed as a family at the Hilton Diagonal Mar for the past ten years approx. at least once/twice per year. We keep returning simply because it has everything we want as a family. The area is out of town and safe, the beach is literally a 2 minute walk, the Diagonal Mar Shopping center is straight across the road and offers everything from designer labels to Primark, hairdressers, cafe, cinema etc etc. Taxi stand directly outside and bus stops opposite. Now that's just a small insight to the area. The Hotel itself has a fab pool area (puro beach), brilliant for family and couples alike. The rooms are large and its well worth the little extra for a Junior Suite. The staff themselves is our main reason for being returning  guests.  The service is second to none and nothing is too much trouble. A massive thank you to Jordie-front of house, Emanuele, David and Elisenda Restaurant and bar. These people are our reason for returning as they make us feel part of the Hilton Family.",5,2016,03,30
36,Good hotel on the outskirts of town,"Last week I was caught up in a French air traffic control strike so was unexpectedly booked into this hotel by Easy Jet (well done Easy Jet, good choice!).  The hotel is a 10-15 minute bus/metro journey from the centre of Barcelona and is located close to the seafront.  The staff are friendly and helpful.  The hotel and rooms are clean and the standard of the rooms are more than sufficient.  Tea/coffee making facilities are available in the room.  The staff in the restaurant are extremely helpful and nothing was too much trouble.  I would definitely stay at this hotel again if I was revisiting Barcelona even though it is slightly out of the centre of town.",4,2016,03,29
36,Fabulous Hotel,Wonderful short stay. Staff all very helpful & friendly.Would definitely return to this amazing hotel. Even afterarriving in the early hours we received a warm welcome. Hotel is well located for city or beach,5,2016,03,29
36,Very nice place,"Very nice and friendly staff all arround. Reception desk, restaurant, hotel bar - perfect service everywhere. Good clean rooms and very comgortable beds. A very nice place to be and a perfect place for a short city trip. The hotel is not inthe city center but there are good connections by public bus or metro. ",5,2016,03,27
36,Great location and Service,"This hotel had the best executive lounge I have ever used.  The hotel is close to everything without being in the middle of it. Close to the metro. 

We have stayed there twice and would stay there again.  The staff was excellent and was extremely helpful. ",5,2016,03,27
36,Great business hotel,"My fourth stay at this hotel and I will happily return. It is everything you need on a business trip. The rooms are consistently clean, good food and friendly staff. The beds are comfortable and it is quiet at night. The wifi is also good and the rooms are large enough to enable some serious email work without feeling like a caged animal after a few hours. Easy access to taxis and scenic walks are another plus.",4,2016,03,27
36,Very friendly and warm-hearted service in a convenient area,"We spent 4 nights in Hilton Diagonal Mar as a family of 4 (2 kids aged 6&10): starting with the arrival, the concierge service, the service in the executive lounge and the astonishing service in restaurant Indigo (breakfast), this was one of the best hotels in terms of service and honest friendlyness (not pretending to be friendly!), I've ever stayed.
The hotel is just opposite Diagonal mar shopping centre with a large children playground and a 10min walk from the beach. Tram (5min) and Metro (10min) are nearby.
Our room (1421) was very well located (only one neighbour room) and very quiet therefore!
Buffet Breakfast in Indigo was - apart from the excellent service - very rich, well decorated and something for really everyone (including a large variety of tea and proper Capucchino if you ask for it!).
Can highly recommend it!",5,2016,03,27
36,Was nice,"Good hotel as always. Has a local shopping plaza with a great level of restaurants too.
Beach is not too far, short walk. Nice quiet hote. Is easy to access to get into other places in the city. Not too far from the airport and is easy to find.",4,2016,03,25
36,Great hotel ,"Good hotel with fabulous breakfast selection only minutes from the beach. Clean tidy and spacious rooms. Nice pool area too with sun loungers and pool bar

Healthy breakfast options in a large restaurant area - plenty of space for family and friends ",4,2016,03,24
36,Views are great - firendly staff,"I must say, I liked the stay here. I stayed at 21st floor and the views were just great. Further, the staff was very helpful, gym worked well, even at 5:30 AM. Do not choose this hotel if you want to use the outdoor pool during winter time (I believe you can), but if  were to return at a warmer time of the year, I would love to spend an afternoon at the poolside too.
Rooms are spacious and up-to date.",4,2016,03,23
36,Very Good,"Very nice looking hotel, very helpful front desk staff and in a fantastic location. Room was extremely hot even with temperature turned right down, not offering free wifi in guest rooms was very disappointing and a first for me. Drinks prices in bar area were a little over the top compared to other hotels, but I still would probably stay agin based purely on the location ",4,2016,03,23
36,Hilton diagonal mar,"Stay at this Hilton was excellent breakfast was good proximity to diagonal mar was very helpful for non spannish speaking Australians  front desk staff are excellent in helping with local trips  piano recital on Saturday was super 
But the BEST ITALIAN RESTAURANT  was across in the diagonal mar  GINOSA, the quality of food is excellent and the preparations are really authentic and would recommend that to any one requiring Spanish and Italian cousine",4,2016,03,20
36,Very nice indeed ,"I visited this hotel while attending s conference in Barcelona. It's large, very modern and right next to a lovely large shopping mall with lots of shops. The beds are very comfortable and the restaurant serve very clean tasty food. A lovely hotel in a nice part of Barcelona. Just a little far from camp nou! Will return with the wife and family at a later date. ",4,2016,03,18
36,Very nice hotel!,"Spent a week here in early August prior to going to a cruise. The hotel is very nice, and a bit outside of the city center. We stayed at the executive floor, and the lounge there was excellent. Plenty of beverages (alcoholic and non-alcoholic), and snacks available throughout the evening. The lounge also has a great view, with a very nice atmosphere. The hotel itself, deserves 5 stars. But only get 4 due to the pool area. The area is very nice, but to get a sun bed close to the pool you have to reserve it. And that cost you 20 euros per day per person. There are free sun beds in the area, but they are under a ceiling with a lot of wooden bars. So half you body gets sun, the other have no sun. We tried that one day, realized that this was not very nice, and thus ended up paying 240 Euros just to get two sun beds during our stay. If we had know about this prior to our arrival, we might have chosen a different hotel.",4,2016,03,13
36,Excellent,"Totally Satisfied. The location is very handy to anywhere in Barcelona.   I used  Subway, Tram systems to go most of the famous spots of Barcelona. The city of Barcelona is charming. Diagonal shopping mall is located next to the hotel. it's so convenient and we took advantage a lot.  The hotel helped us to make the start very commemorative.",5,2016,03,12
36,Liked it!,Liked this place. Location is excellent! 5 minutes from the beach. 5 minutes from nice shopping mall. The business lounge is excellent with great view and nice food. The hotel atmosphere is pleasent and friendly. Recommend this place!,5,2016,03,12
36,Best hotel near the conference center ,"Every time I come, I'm happy to stay there: warmly welcome, great rooms with sea view if located at the right place, nice bar and big terrace with the pool! The only negative point is the breakfast which could be more of the same standard........",4,2016,03,12
36,Nice Hotel,"The hotel is not overly busy as this is the off-season for the ocean-front area. The rooms are quiet and nicely appointed appearing to have been refurbished recently. I have a spectacular city/mountain view from a high floor. As best as I can ascertain from the 15th floor exec lounge, the ocean view is marred by some nearby high rise office buildings so don't freak out if you don't get an ocean view room. Due to arriving at a late hour, my group chose to eat dinner in at the Pistaccio Lobby Bar. The typical Hilton Burger was pretty good as Hilton Burger's go. I ordered a Maker's Mark Manhatten, but due to a language barrier issue, I got a glass of straight bourbon. I let it slide, since Maker's Mark is a good thing in any form. Restaurant prices seem a bit high as are off-season room rates. Wi-Fi is temperamental. All in all, a pleasant experience with friendly service. I am unable to evaluate the Pool area as it is still closed for the winter season.",4,2016,03,12
36,Brilliant Staff,"a short  break was made very memorable by the kindness, helpful approach and professionalism of the staff.  Wonderful food in Indigo Restaurant, good facilities in Executive Lounge, very comfortable room with a good view.",5,2016,03,08
36,Friendliest service,This is the friendliest hotel I have stayed at in a long time. There were some small issues to be taken care of - and it was done with a gracious smile. The breakfast team made me feel like an old friend by the second morning.,4,2016,03,05
36,Awesome Hotel,This is one of the best hotels I have been to. No surprise because it is a Hilton but the location and amenities here are the best. Some of the best food and a fun dining experience was enjoyed by everyone.,5,2016,03,05
36,Fantastic Hilton stay in Barcelona!,"I have stayed at many Hilton properties, but this hotel includes the best service by far!  Normally I travel alone for work, but this time I brought my wife along for an extended vacation.  The reviews about the Hilton Diagonal Mar were spot-on.  From the time we arrived, taking advantage of the Executive Lounge with my gold membership, through the time we left, the staff at this hotel treated us with the greatest respect.  It was clear that they value the importance of customer service.  Highpoints for our stay were the Sea view (incredible!), help from the Concierge in choosing where in Barcelona to visit (the Flamenco at Tablao Cordobes on Las Ramblas was fantastic!), Executive lounge staff that were attentive to our needs, and Bruno plus other waiters, who took EXCEPTIONAL care of us in the Indigo Restaurant both nights we ate there.  Also, the close proximity to a Metro station on the other side of the mall really helped us with easy access to all the things we wanted to see in and around the city.  Without a doubt I will want to stay at this hotel during future visits to Barcelona!",5,2016,03,02
36,Average experience at a high price,The Hilton Diagonal del Mar is a fairly new property that is well located close to the beach. However traffic to and from the hotel towards the downtown area can be bad taking upto an hour during peak traffic! The staff is not very friendly or eager to help but the rooms are fairly new and clean,3,2016,03,02
36,"Like the hotel, love breakfast!","Being there for business. 
Nice young staff, clean and comfortable room. 
Not really my favourite area in Barcelona but next to metro station and good if the meetings/conferences are nearby. Shopping center really close.

Lots of facilities (gym, swimming pool at the rooftop and beautiful terrace!) but what I love the most was breakfast. So many choices, good quality, typical Catalan food (different oils, pa amb tomàquet, ...)",4,2016,02,29
36,Beautiful place to have a family weekend,"Hotel is not located in the center of Barcelona but  resides in a new modern area,  next to malls and business center, not far from metro.  The staff was welcoming and  the family enjoyed the stay and delicious breakfast.",5,2016,02,29
36,Good Location Good Service,"This is what you would expect from Hilton, clean, efficient,and they try hard. The Executive lounge and Restaurant are very good and feature a good selection and great service. It is well located and it is always easy to get cabs and get around, and is situated right opposite a mall, which features shopping and restaurants",4,2016,02,27
36,"Super stay, perfect rooms (17 & 18floor), nice breakfast.","Perfect rooms, clean, fully equiped and very good beds. Nice bathroom with toilet and bidet. TV with lots of channels, cnn, arab, german, french, english and off course spanish.
Very good breakfast and nice service there. Juice and coffee delivered to your table and quick removal from used plates. Very, very good!",5,2016,02,23
36,What.A.View,"The business lounge upstairs makes this hotel. A top floor, panoramic view of the city while you eat your breakfast with the sun on your face is hard to beat. The rooms are clean and modern and the staff are great. 

Honestly though, that view makes it!",5,2016,02,22
36,Made to feel welcome,"Despite being 5/6 metro stops outside the city, this hotel is across from a busy mall and there was enough to do in both in the hotel and in the vicinity to make it feel like we were in Barcelona. The metro itself runs regularly so we never felt like we were far from the main attractions.  Hotel itself was very good. We got into the exec club where the staff were particularly helpful. There was a good range of Catalan wines available too!",5,2016,02,20
36,Best Lounge Ever,"Hotel exceeded all expectations. Lounge perfect, staff friendly and very helpful. Room perfectly made up each day. Thanks to housekeeping staff.  Love this hotel. Nice location even for winter as I traveled in February.  Breakfast was good and HOtel quiet.",5,2016,02,19
36,Another great Hilton experience,"I had a room in the top floor of the hotel seeside. The room was nice and cosy. The staff was freindly especially at breakfast. I had access to the executive lounge, which was a nice experience in the evening. As always a pleasurable Hilton experience.",5,2016,02,19
36,"Very nice, a bit far from the center","Spent one night on a business trip. A very nice hotel, I had a room with two single beds, clean and recently renewed (as the bathroom). Breakfast was OK, with a large choice of UK and continental food. Also had dinner at the hotel restaurant, that was OK for the price paid. ONly downside of the hotel is that it's not very close to the main center of the city, but metro or taxi are at range.",4,2016,02,18
36,Excellent hotel in Barcelona,"Many times a guest and have always enjoyed its excellent service, facility, cleanliness, friendly staff and location in Barcelona. No doubt on top of my list of hotels in Barcelona. Being regulary in Barcelona for work, this hotel is my favourite of all.",5,2016,02,17
36,Excellent Services,"Well situated hotel with very pleasant staff and spacious, clean rooms. Very easy to reach the centre of town either by metro or taxi. Situated by the beaches as well as all necessary amenities made this hotel a pleasant experience during a business trip. I can recommend this hotel with no hesitation.",5,2016,02,16
36,Barcelona experience,"Hilton Diagonal Mar was overall a good experience. Front desk services are excellent and the location is convenient to a large shopping mall across the street. Close to the public beaches and easy access to metro. Taxi service is on corner outside of hotel. This was my second trip to this hotel and though not as pleasant as my first stay, the quality of service is high Hilton standard.",4,2016,02,16
36,Good Hotel & Good Service,Stayed at the Hilton Diagonal Mar over a weekend. It is located a little outside the main tourist area which is very nice. Across is a good shopping mall with some nice restaurants. Rooms are typical Hilton like and if you get the chance for a sea view room - go for it. It's worth it. Staff is friendly and helpful. Can't comment on the pool area as it was closed because of on-going renovation. ,4,2016,02,14
36,A blend of corporate & leisure,"Hilton Diagonal Mar is located in the finance destrict of Barcelona but really doesn't feel that way due to its close proximity to the beach. It's everything you'd expect from a Hilton - nicely furnished and a blend between corporate and leisure. The local train station is a short 5 minute walk away and links to all the major attractions in the city such as the Gaudi landmarks and shopping districts. The hotel has a shopping centre conveniently located at its doorstep which stays open until late with a nice 
selection of shops and an outdoor food court. If you stay here our tip is to upgrade to a sea view room which we did when we arrived at a little extra cost; it made the experience all the more pleasant and you do get a nice view of the city at night. There's only 2 hotels which stood out to us along the long stretch of beach in Barcelona; one was this and the other was the W Hotel at either ends of the beach.",4,2016,02,11
36,Love this hotel!!,"I think this Hilton may top the W.
The service was amazing. Rooms were spacious and clean. Big, comfortable beds in the rooms. Not forgetting how big and clean the bathroom was. The breakfast here was amazing!! So much to choose from. I always find breakfast to be a bit of pain in hotels as they don't offer much choice of hot food for vegetarians. The Hilton had a great variety.
The pool party was great and we had a free  sun lounger as we stayed in the hotel.
There is a shopping centre across the road from the hotel. Not up to a minutes walk which has a Zara. I recommend you leave all your Zara shopping until you get to Spain as it is much cheaper!!
The Nightclubs and Las Ramblas are a short taxi journey away.
Very good location. I would definitely stay here again.",5,2016,02,11
36,Superb Pool area,"Beautiful room overlooking the Mediteranian, and great breakfast buffet. Transportation nearby, and the Diagonal Mar Shopping, just across the street.
Walking distance to the Beach and the Beach-bars!",5,2016,02,10
36,Really good but didn't appreciate the handyman walking in!,"I stayed at this hotel for business. The staff were very friendly and check in was easy.

The room itself had a nice view of the marina and was very spacious and the amenities were very modern. The only thing that was a bit strange was when I was getting dressed a man just walked into my room. He knocked first but walked in immediately. I presume he was a handyman but he walked straight out. 
As a women travelling on her own it was a bit scary. I would recommend that someone knocks on the door and wait a minute before walking in!! Other than this it was a lovely stay.",4,2016,02,10
36,One of Hilton's BEST,"We are HGVC owners & Hhonors Gold and this hotel IS an absolute 10 on our scale for Hilton Hotels.  Close to the beach, a huge shopping mall...close to the metro so very easy to get to downtown Barcelona. The Front Desk to the Indigo (both morning and evening staff) to the Executive Lounge to the Housekeeping Staff were the friendliest I've ever met.  Our first meal after check-in was at the Indigo on the first floor.  Bruno was out of this world...best service, meal, dessert, and even provided us with recommendations for other places in Barcelona to check out.  And to the Chef...awesome chicken.  Meri in the Executive Lounge was so pleasant and made our evenings with Cava especially enjoyable.  I wish I could remember and mention all of the other staff that made our visit so pleasurable but there are too many.   ""Miss Cuba"" in the Indigo, we will see you in Cuba!!  Best hotel & staff...we will be back!  LOVE LOVE LOVE Barcelona!",5,2016,02,09
36,Like hotels used to be,"First stay at the Hilton having stayed at many hotels in Barcelona in the last 12 months. This hotel is great and the staff are even better.

The hotel itself is big and spacious with everything you could possibly need. The rooms are a proper size with bathrooms to match and with air con that actually works!!

But the staff are the stand out part, quiet but really attentive always on hand,always very helpful. As I checked in I witnessed a member of staff very patiently helping an elderly gentleman who spoke little English or Spanish and would have tested the patience of a saint. 

Highly recommended",5,2016,02,09
36,"Empty at Christmas, great breakfast, perfect staff- small issue with upgrade policy","We stayed there for 2 nights. As a Diamond member I usually receive the best room available. Not at this hotel- even empty and quiet I received a ""small"" upgrade. 
Breakfast buffet is fantastic with great service. I remember Albert taking care of us. Great staff in general and nothing to complain. 
Went to the Executive Lounge where the food and snacks offered for free are not that good but OK. They were also running out of red wine which should not happen. 

Hotel has a great view. Pool area was closed due to renovation. 

Parking is super expensive!",4,2016,02,08
36,Professional Service ,"I stayed at this hotel for a conference and i totally enjoyed my stay! I had an executive room with access to the executive lounge. The staff is friendly and proffesional and the view is fantastic from the lounge.The internet connection was a bit slow but Georgiana provided an excellent customer service and made sure i enjoyed my stay.Unfortunately, i couldn't visit the city because of my busy schedule but i will definitely be back! We arranged a dinner at the Indiggo restaurant and the food and service was fantastic!",4,2016,02,07
36,Excellent service and close to FOOOD,Loved staying here with my wife. Its across the street from a Mall and nice places to eat. Close to the beach. Very good location. The room was very clean and the hotel itself is very upscale. The city tour bus station is also a 1 minute walk from the hotel.,5,2016,02,04
36,Great stay - Business trip,"Nothing wrong. Staff extremely helpful. Hotel very clean. If I have to point out ONE opportunity for improvement would be the breakfast buffet. Never changed! Gets boring! But the quality of it was always excellent... The gym was too small, but never busy, and had machines for everything, so it is adequate...",5,2016,02,03
36,Really Great Service,Staff at this hotel could not do enough to ensure your stay was  the best experience.  Could not recommend this hotel enough. Service with a smile. Food was great. Internet a bit slow but we had lots of people at the hotel so it was probably being used a lot !,5,2016,02,03
36,A conference hotel that worked well.,"This was a 4 day business meeting. I had a corner room with great views, good bed and big bathroom. Eating -  breakfast and lunch were good with a great variety. Hotel was very busy so breakfast was crowded. Room service was prompt but the variety of main courses I fancied was limited. Conference facilities worked well",4,2016,01,30
36,Great experience,"Was booked into another hotel in the area but wasn't what I was expecting, ""walked in"" to the Hilton and the service couldn't have been better....good location, next to the conference centre....thumbs up!",5,2016,01,30
36,Amazing business Hotel,"I have to say every time I go to Barcelona, I am amazed with this fine, luxurious business hotel. The A-location (near to the beach and near to a large shopping mall) next to the Barcelona Forum makes this the perfect place to stay. Please note that this is not only a business hotel: for leisure you can stay here perfectly!
I loved the diversity of the food (from breakfast to dinner) and the amazing pool place, where it is also possible to eat & drink. Yes, even the staff was good, helpful and spoke other languages pretty good. You gotta love this place if you love Barcelona!",5,2016,01,29
36,Excellent hotel,"I have stayed here on two occasions in the summer with my family.
Although the hotel is some distance from the centre of the city transport links are excellent.The location is good in the heat of the summer with the beach and some good beach bars nearby.The hotel has an excellent pool area.
I recommend paying the extra for the executive rooms.The rooms are large and well appointed with extremely comfortable beds.The city view from the veranda of the executive lounge is fantastic.Access to the executive lounge means you have free drinks and as well as breakfast excellent tapas are available in the afternoon and evening.
Service throughout the hotel was excellent .",5,2016,01,26
36,Great hotel by the sea.,"Lovely hotel with friendly staff. We were upgraded so had access to the executive lounge which has nice views of the sea. All in all a lovely stay but I would have liked to use the pool (but it is seasonal, but I think that is the same for most hotels with outside pools in Barcelona.) It's a bit of a way out of town but only a few minutes walk to the underground, or a lovely walk along the sea front if the weather is nice!",5,2016,01,26
36,Busy Hilton Hotel,"The Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona is located opposite a shopping mall, although it does not have the best location in the city.

Rooms are comfortable.  The breakfast is very good.  Service is fine, no complains.",4,2016,01,24
36,Wonderful location and staff,"I always choose Hilton family hotels for personal travel, but for business I'm at the mercy of my company. Thankfully my meeting was scheduled at this hotel, which is clean, nicely appointed, in a great location overlooking the sea, and has an amazing staff. I was a little apprehensive about my second trip to Barcelona given my first experience for which virtually no one spoke English. The staff here all have great English and are very courteous and helpful. I especially enjoyed Bruno at the Indigo Restaurant. He did everything possible to ensure I had an amazing dinner.",5,2016,01,24
36,Great Service!,"I had a wonderful time staying at this hotel.  Everyone I encountered was incredibly friendly and they couldn't have been more helpful.  Three employees really stood out for me and they were Bruno, Zacopo, and Antoine.  I met them while dining in the Indigo Restaurant.  The food was excellent and moderately priced and the service was out of this world.  Not only were they attentive and made great recommendations regarding the menu, they gave me travel advice as well.  Antoine and Bruno were from one of the areas I was going to visit, and they gave me some incredible insights into this area.  I will definitely stay here again!",5,2016,01,23
36,Sweet spot in Barca :),"A fantastic location, overlooking the sea, in front of a very nice shopping mall. You can stay, walk by the sea, do shopping and select from different restaurants starting from small take aways to the a great Italian cuisine in addition to StarBucks :)
Hotel staff is very friendly, special thanks to the main breakfast restaurant staff for the great service and nice smile
Rooms are quite clean and internet speed is good   ",4,2016,01,22
36,Nice Centrally Located Hotel - specially the executive floor,I love the location of this hotel. Very centrally located. Near everything. Also the executive floor and suites have a very nice exclusive restaurant and snacks available all day. Definitely recommended specially for Business Travellers.,5,2016,01,22
36,Excellent Service,Very nice location with great views. Will definitely stay here again the next time i visit Barcelona. the staff were very helpful and professional and provided service with a smile. Enjoyed my stay at the hotel and would like to say a special thank you to staff member Georgiana for exceptionally good customer service.,5,2016,01,21
36,Expect more from 5 star hotel,"-Although i told  the receptionist i will pay cash in advanced and don't charge my credit card , i received sms from my bank and they block advance payment.
-Rooms missed trash can in the bathroom -No slippers and some basic bathroom items eg cotton puds which should be essential for 5 star hilton hotel

",1,2016,01,17
36,Great Hotel,"Got a great deal and stayed here for 4nights.
Really nice , Clean, luxurious room and looking out over Barcelona from thr bath tub was fantastic.        
Breakfast was just how it should be with everything that you could want and plenty of it.
Will stay again if im feeling flush and in Barcelona. 
Cocktail bar next to the reception is quiet nice. 
Nice location for us , shopping mall across the road with eateries.
Bus stop very handy also.",5,2016,01,16
36,Excellent business hotel,"Very well located. Excellent wifi. Quiet, dark rooms with good amenities. Good selection of food at the restaurant and a good breakfast. Very little not to commend this hotel as a decent business hotel.",4,2016,01,16
36,A great Hotel,"Our stay was fabulous.  The room had comfortable beds and a great view.  The hotel has more than 20 floors.  The breakfast buffet had more than 100 items and they were all good.  They had traditional American food in the buffet.  The front desk staff was very helpful, as was all the staff.",5,2016,01,14
36,"Excellent Service, nice rooms","My family stayed at the Hilton Diagonal Mar on the night after returning from a Mediterranean cruise.  The cruise disembarks early in the day, and we made it to the hotel at about 1030 am, well before rooms would be available.  The front desk staff was very friendly and accommodating. They offered to secure our luggage and even gave us some information on what to do in the city until our rooms were ready, or when we returned to the hotel.  

The rooms were very nice and mostly clean. We had an issue with a couple of the towels in the bathroom, but when we called down to the front desk and reported it, the towels were replaced immediately.",4,2016,01,14
36,"Nice views, good location and good service","The hotel is just next to shopping, the convention center and the beach. High floors have very nice views and the executive lounge offers outdoors seating with excellent views over Barcelona. This may be more of a business location, but it's still easy reach from the traditional tourist sights, just a 5-10 euro taxi ride or a long walk. Highly recommended for business travel.",5,2016,01,10
36,Excellent views,"My daughter and I stayed at the Hilton Diagonal Mar for New Year's Eve, the ocean view is beautiful and the hotel staff were very helpful. The room itself was a good size. The hotel itself is not close to downtown Barcelona, but there is public transportation nearby that was easy to navigate. We felt very safe and comfortable in the space. The taxi to the airport cost about 35 euros.",5,2016,01,09
36,Outstanding Service / Beautiful Hotel,"I stayed at The Hilton Diagonal Mar Hotel from the 24th of December until January 1st, 2016.    I booked the trip through a travel agency.  I didn't have any expectations of staying at a Hilton, as I usually stay at Marriotts.  My daughter, who lives in Pamplona  met me and a friend of mine.  We stayed in a suite on the 21st floor for 3 nights while my daughter was with us. After my daughter left, we moved to a room with 2 double beds.  I found the hotel to be outstanding.  The staff were friendly, helpful and provided excellent customer service.  We had access to the executive lounge on the 15th floor, which helped make our experience even better.  The lounge is open for breakfast, a few hours in the afternoon, and for dinner.  They offer beer, wine, champagne, snacks, one hot entree, tea, coffee, etc.. It was a hub for guests and we met wonderful people.  The rooms were clean, and it was evident to us that the people in the hotel take great pride in their jobs.  We also had free Wifi.  Inside the lounge, they have a computer with a printer, and down in the lobby, they have four computers.  Our stay included free breakfast in the restaurant.  Every morning there was a buffet.  Many choices, from hot entrees to cereal to fruit, breads and pastries, etc...  We also ate dinner at the restaurant on New Years Eve.  It was a 7 course meal with two choices for the entree.  My friend ordered the chicken and loved it.  I did not.  I notified my server, and he asked what I would like instead.  There wasn't even a hesitation to offer me steak and roasted potatoes.  10 minutes later I got my meal and it was delicious.  The hotel is less than a 10 minute walk to the beach on one side and a mall on the other side.  We never had to wait for a taxi, as they line up outside in front of the hotel.  I would definitely recommend this hotel, as It far exceeded our expectations!!  When you go away somewhere for the first time, you sometimes come back saying what you would do different the next time.  I did not feel like that at The Hilton Diagonal Mar.  It was Awesome!!",5,2016,01,02
36,Christmas/New Year break,I am a frequent traveller in hotels around the world. This is possibly the best service I have ever received. A special thanks to Marlene and other ladies on the front desk. Another thanks to Georgiana In the executive lounge. This hotel is not in the city centre but for the service we received it was worth the short metro ride every day. Breakfast was outstanding along with service. Very welcoming!,5,2016,01,02
36,"Nice typical Hilton, not the best location","I picked this hotel for a trip because I was able to use points for our stay.  It was a nice property and everything was what you would expect for this property, however the location wasn't the best for enjoying the older part of the city.  This didn't stop us, there are plenty of cabs, however if I returned to the city I would probably look for a hotel in the older part of town.",4,2016,01,01
36,Easter Weekend with Kids in Barcelona,"Visited April 2015 stayed with 2 teenage kids at Hilton Diagonal Mar. Excellent hotel, our room was very spacious and kids were happy with the free wifi. Location is superb as you are away from the busy city centre but can easily travel back and forth on the metro which is a stone's throw away or the tram which stop outside the hotel. 
There is a quieter beach within walking distance which was very popular with early morning joggers. The hotel has a small gym the outdoor pool was not open as weather was not pool weather. However this did not distract from the enjoyment of our stay. There is a really good shopping centre literally on the grounds behind the hotel. Staff are very friendly and provide excellent information to tourists. They were able to recommend the waterfall show which was amazing and inform us on what taxi charges should be. We were very well looked after. We stayed on a bed and breakfast basis which suited us fine as after the excellent choice of breakfast we were able to venture into the city and come back in the evenings to relax and enjoy the hotel facilities. Would stay there again. ",5,2015,12,31
36,Good enough,Typical of any large European business hotel-sterile and lifeless. Nice enough facilities in the rooms but awful conference food and way too long check in/out lines. Eat and shop across the road. Wish Hilton in Europe would make more of a fuss for their guests.,4,2015,12,29
36,Pleasant hotel but has a few hiccups,"This hotel is in a good spot close to Maria Cristina metro, a few steps from a El Corte Ingles It is a nice set up and with pleasant views out the window with lots of light.  We stayed here on two seperate occasions in December and we found that the staff were helpful but several times we were given the wrong tourist information about different facilities. This is really frustrating when you are a tourist and don't have much time to enjoy a city- you don't want to be wasting time and travelling unnecessarily to a location when you could be visiting another site that is open.
I did appreciate how the staff were accomodating When I needed our tickets printed off for the Sagrada familia they were more than happy to help out.
 It is a pity that little things like the bathroom taps are not maintained. On our first stay we were in a bathroom where the taps were loose. It's disconcerting turning on a tap and it moves on you.",3,2015,12,28
36,Fabulous hotel ,I loved my stay here. It was such a relaxed and friendly hotel. The food is the restaurant was amazing. As was the service. I would recommend this hotel and would definitely stay here again. It is a perfect location for a holiday in Barcelona. Fabulous hotel ,5,2015,12,25
36,Great city. Great Hotel,"Fantastic hotel in a fantastic city. All you would expect from a Hilton Hotel. clean, modern, spacious and fantastic staff and customer service. Nice location and the restaurant within the hotel was amazing. Food in there was top drawer and reasonably priced..
",4,2015,12,14
36,"Great Location, Great staff, great room with a view","The front desk was very hospitable! I would give them 5 stars for accommodating guest!  The room was spotless, with a nice view of the sea.  The breakfast included was very good, very European.  The location is across from the Diagonal Mar Shopping Center which has good tapas, seafood and other restaurants.  Nice shops as well.  A nice cab ride to the area of all of the Gaudi architecture.  Beautiful trip!",4,2015,12,12
36,Management does not care.,Anthony Coligado <anthonycoligado@gmail.com> 	 Dec 8 (2 days ago) 		 to Bcdm.barcelona I took a shower after checking in and pulled the towel out of the rack and a piece of drywall hit me in the face. I think that the 1/2 by 3 inches piece of drywall was on top of the towel. Gave the piece of drywall in the front desk and explained to the lady what happened. Told her that maybe a repair was done recently and the room was not thoroughly cleaned. I waited till checkout to get an explanation or apology but never got one. I think that is a very poor customer service for a Hilton hotel.  Anthony Arrieta Coligado,2,2015,12,10
36,Good standards,"Rooms are big, clean and with some good sea / city views.

Hotel is far from city center, but good for conventions / concerts near Forum area.
Service and facilities are just the standard from a Hilton Hotel, but all is good.

If you need to be near this area I'd recommend the hotel.",4,2015,12,09
36,The Hilton is the place to stay in Barcelona.,"The Hilton is the place to stay when in Barcelona, convenient and easy to reach, Friendly cheerful and helpful staff. Warm and welcoming to everyone. The breakfast is superb every request catered for, and served with a smile. The Hilton has a calm and relaxed atmosphere, and it is ideal just to chill out. Opposite is a large shopping center where there are all different shops and resturaunts. Must try the Srilankan Tea, overall a great stay and would recommend this Hotel if you are planning a trip to Barcelona",5,2015,12,05
36,One of the dirty Hilton   ,"We arrived at the hotel 2pm as we book our room before and was thinking that we will go to our room and rest so we will be ready for evening. 
We was told that room is not ready and have a bigger room and pay 35 euro per day extra  which we said NO. 
Waited in the lobby for 45 min while they were cleaning our room. No one ask us for drink or anything. 
My wife went to tell the manager and she told us this room was in someone use and we do not allow our guest before 4pm. Which was not very nice. 
When we arrived in our room it was not as clean as we were expected. 

The chairs are so dirty as we took the picture to show everyone. 
Today is our 1st day I do not know how will we stay here. 
Before you book in this hotel thing 10 time. ",1,2015,12,02
36,Recent Stay,"This is a lovely hotel based in a lovely area.  You have the sea five minute walk away and the other side a modern shopping centre with several restaurants.

The hotel is nice and very clean with fantastic views.   Had a few problems with the reception staff when we had a problem with opening our fridge, took two hours for us to get this sorted out, when all I wanted to do was put a  pint of milk in the fridge.

The fridge is very stocked up with alcohol, water, soft drinks and snacks, but please beware items are ridiculously overpriced.

A trip to the centre is a metro ride away, station within easy walking distance and easy to use.

I would definitely without a doubt stay here again.",4,2015,11,29
36,"Fabulous location, awesome views, spacious room","Service was really good once we got there. The hotel is modern and  upmarket in terms of decor and the location is great if you like to be by the sea, waterfront restaurants and, beach boulevard walks. Also the hop on buses are pretty much across the road and there is a tram that goes directly up Diagonal Ave. There is an average mall opposite with an excellent superstore for all sorts of things as well as cafes and clothes shops. It is easy to taxi to places but the hop on bus is the best to get around the city. The cocktails are great but pretty expensive. 
If you or your organization are paying forward, that needs to be arranged prior to your stay. I made sure I had a letter from Hilton International Reservations to say my stay had been paid for as they tried to charge me an extra night. Watch the extras they charge for mini-bar as well and keep a tab otherwise they will overcharge you for it.",4,2015,11,29
36,Not Realy good for business,"This might have been a great place a fel years ago, but it has lowered the standards for sure; while a normal decay is acceptable, the dirty doors of the elevators are only negligence; besides these cosmetic issues, a modern hotel will simply not appeal to business customer without a really good internet connection and here it is not the case; too bad, but it can be fixed !",4,2015,11,28
36,Convenient Executive Lounge with Helpful english-speaking staff ,"This hotel is located in a newly developed district in Barcelona and not quite near the city center but accessible through metro ride (approx. 25 minutes). I was provided an upgrade to their executive floor with access to the lounge. The staff were very friendly and helpful. They even provided me with directions for the metro, which made it easy for me to go to the city center. I really enjoyed staying at this hotel and highly recommend it. This hotel is also conveniently located beside the Diagonal Mar commercial center/mall",4,2015,11,27
36,Zeta Tours reviews the Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona,"As you walk in this looks like a lovely hotel, and in many ways it is. But the hotels infrastructure cannot keep up with demand! The internet wifi is terrible, and not only that, the hotel have known about this for a long time. Management should do their guests and staff a favour by sacking their IT supplier! The English language TV stations did not work all the time and even the lift broke down on one occasion leaving me and another guest to exit by the fire escape! Otherwise the rooms are nice and the downstairs lobby area very nice. Breakfast and bar snacks good too. Long suffering staff faced with many complaints still had a smile on their faces well done them!",3,2015,11,21
36,Very nice hotel,"Room was clean and well appointed with a view of the city.
The front desk staff were very patient and helpful in fact all the staff we met during our stay seemed to go out of their way to be pleasant and say hello.
This is a very well managed hotel!
There is also a convenient selection of restaurants just across the street, everything from fast food to fine local dining.",5,2015,11,21
36,Not quite living up to the expectations ,"I was there for a 4 days visit. The internet access which I have paid for was very unreliable and unstable, making business video conferencing impossible. 
Some of the furniture has seen its best days long ago and the security lock at my door was pulled out of the frame.

The staff was very friendly and helpful! The food at the breakfast buffet was good and a good variety was available.

The hotel was clean and well located close to the sea. 

I am not sure whether I will return to the hotel but probably try a different place next time
",3,2015,11,17
36,A good hotel but ultimately fails business visitors,"Pros:
- Excellent service and polite staff
- Clean rooms
- good breakfast choice, coffee was great too

Con:
- This to me is unforgivable. Absolutely unusable internet connection. I had to go to nearby cafes to get work done. Not slow, utterly unusable. I don't understand how a Hilton hotel can get this wrong.
- For the love of god provide your guests with tooth paste. We can't carry these on planes and finding one on a Sunday in Spain in relatively remote Diagonal mar is very hard.
- I was no pleased price of minibar. 5.50 euroes for a small bottle of water is too much.",3,2015,11,17
36,Hilton Excellence,"Wonderful experience at the Hilton 10th - 13th November 2015 where I stayed on business with a large group. I can only congratulate the management and staff for providing an excellent service. The hotel is spotless, the staff are all friendly and helpful, the food was excellent and facilitates top class. What more can I say, it is a beacon of light in the service industry.

36,Very Nice Hotel and Great Staff!,"When our cruise ship  could not dock at the Port of Barcelona many passengers had to wait an additional day to connect with flights to return home. Our cruise company had partnered with the Hilton to provide overnight accommodations for a large number of passengers as well as for future passengers that could not board the ship as scheduled.

When we arrived at the hotel around 9:00 AM we were pleasantly surprised that our room was, in fact, ready and we could check in. This was a huge benefit for us as we spent an additional day at sea in 40 knot winds and we were both a little under the weather for obvious reasons. The staff did a very good job of handling the long line of grumpy travelers with anxiety about returning home.
Our room overlooked the Diagonal Mall just across the street and the view of Barcelona from our window was magnificent.
The room was very clean, comfortable and well appointed. There is a safe in the closet for keeping valuables and documents secure.

The location of the hotel is about a ½ hour cab ride to the downtown tourist area and about a 45 minute drive to the airport in morning traffic.

There is a public beach 2 blocks away which was a pleasant walk. The Diagonal Mall across the street has a large number of restaurants to include a McDonalds so lunch and or dinner should be easy.
On Avenue Diagonal there is a small food market to pick up some fruit, a snack or some wine as well as a number of pharmacy’s if you need one.

In the lobby is a computer work station with a printer and about 6 PC’s for guest usage.
We noticed a breakfast restaurant on the 2nd floor which was crowded but we didn’t get a chance to eat as it wasn’t included in our package and we left for the airport early in the morning.

All in all a very pleasant stay and just what we needed after a hectic additional night at sea",4,2015,11,15
36,Service at its best,"To start, the hotel itself is beautiful and in a nice location, but what really makes it stand out are the people.  People like Anna at the front desk, Alexandra in reservations, or Giovanni in the restaurant were striving to ensure that I never stopped forgetting that I'm on vacation.  Standing ovation.",5,2015,11,15
36,Excellent Hotel,Came off a cruise and wanted a good quality hotel as a base for exploring Barcelona and staying for two nights.  This is wonderful.  Outdoor pool.  Very spacious rooms.  Very clean hotel.  Friendly staff.  Very good breakfast.  It is not in the dead centre of Barcelona but on the tramline.  Better than the W Hotel in which we stayed earlier!  Well worth trying.,5,2015,11,14
36,Great business hotel,Really good hotel with a big open bar. And great rooftop facilities. Very close to the beach and has good business facilities. You won't be disappointed the suites on the 18th floor where I stayed were huge and very well apportioned. The lounge meeting area was big enough for a meeting with 10 people. The bedroom was large as well and the views were great.,4,2015,11,14
36,Expensive and mediocre experience,"Stayed at Hilton for 5 days. To me it seems that the hotel's best capability is capacity and the proximity the the conference center. The room had very good airconditioning but overall a disappointment. It was not possible to take a shower without water flowing out all over the bathroom floor. The room was facing north-east which means no view at all. For a good view you need a room facing south or south-west. Breakfast was good, the staff was nice. The neighborhood is not very interesting and if you have any other intentions than going to the beach or joining a conference you should consider to find something else unless you enjoy daily trips with taxi or metro.",2,2015,11,14
36,"outside city center, but close enough","Good hotel outside the city center, but 10 euro cab ride walk see the sights tan back to a relaxing hotel, plenty of eating places close as a large shopping center is across the street. Good breakfast at hotel.Staff friendly room had a partial view of ocean and was clean and relaxing. Hotel can be pricey but you just gotta book early for a good value as with anything demand will make prices go higher. Would defiantly book this hotel again.",4,2015,11,13
36,Want to feel Barcelona but still want some fresh air?,"Hilton Digonal Mar is situated in the northern part of the city along the costal line. Views to the see and convenient transportation into the city center if your not able to walk. Great facilities and quiet atmosphere. Shopping center with a lot of restaurants near bye. Begin your day with a swim in the Meterinian Sea, enjoy a breakfast on the terrace on the 10th floor. Continue into town in a taxi, by metro or even walking. Come back late afternoon for a relaxing drink, take a shower and go back to town to enjoy the most excellent restaurants. We love to stay here while visiting Barcelona.",5,2015,11,13
36,Great business hotel,"I had the chance to stay at this hotel in October 2016 for a conference which was held at the same venue. The hotel is located along the seafront in the business district of Barcelona. My room had lovely views of the Mediterranean sea. There is a large mall next to the hotel which has all the usual chain stores and many restaurants. The metro is very accessible. One needs to take a cab (around 10 euros) or the metro to the Gothic area or Las Ramblas or Sagrada Familia. Barceloneta can be reached by foot. The hotel is a typical business hotel- well appointed, neat and excellent conference facilities. All staff that I encountered were friendly and efficient. Breakfast was more than adequate. Wifi, internet facilities, gym and bar all readily available.",4,2015,11,12
36,"Good location, nice staff, outdated furniture","Good hotel in a nice location if you Want to be close to the beach or the Forum. Very helpful staff but rooms are a bit outdated even when I booked a superior category. A bit disspointed, I would say it would be a good 3star hotel",3,2015,11,12
36,Nice Loaction and Great Service,"On the map, this hotel seems very far from the historical center.  In reality, it is less than 20 minutes ride on the Metro to most of the major attractions.  The Metro Stop is just five minutes’ walk from the hotel.  

The hotel is a high rise modern hotel.  One can get a very good view of the city or the ocean on the high floors.  The beach is five minutes' walk from the front door.  The Executive Lounge is on the 15th floor and commands a great view of the city and the ocean.
 
The bedroom was clean and tidy and was kept in those condition during our stay.  The room was surprising large and had a good size sitting area.

The Front Desk staff was friendly and extremely helpful.  There was no language barrier.  We arrived late at night.  Unfortunately British Airways did not put our bags on our London - Barcelona flight in time.  When I told this to Omar who checked us in, he asked for the bag tracking notice issued by BA, made a copy of it and promised to call the airline the next day if still un-delivered.  His colleague who came on next day's shift did call BA and we got our bags that evening.  Another front desk staff, Jocelyn, handed us maps and brochures when she found out that we were visiting Barcelona first time.  On the day before we left, I had trouble checking in on line on the BA website.  The Front Desk staff called BA on the phone for me.  Now, that's great customer service all round.

When I e-mailed the hotel that we could either missed our flight from London and not arriving for the day at all or arriving very late at night, I got replies from the Front Office Manager and the Executive Lounge Supervisor saying that they would hold the room for me (and upgraded us when they found out we picked only a standard room at the e- check-in).

The services in the Executive Lounge were of very high standard. The staff there were courteous, helpful and worker very hard to provide all the amenities and services.  At times, there were more than 20 people in the Lounge but the food, snacks and beverages were never in short supply.  The canape and sandwiches served during the Happy Hour were substantial and tasty.  We did not feel the need to go out for dinner most of the time.

This is indeed an ideal hotel for visiting Barcelona - nice location, great service and better value for the money.",5,2015,11,11
36,"Very nice property, clean, nice staff, perfect location, and lovely rooms","Stayed here a couple nights while on the way to a disney cruise. This hotel is not at all far from the airport, and is located 5 minutes from the beach. Its right across the street from the Diagonal Mall, which is very large with shops and restaurants. The staff are very nice and helpful. Outdoor pool is so nice and there are no complaints. Free wifi if you are an HHonours member.",5,2015,11,11
36,Wonderful hotel overlooking the Mediterranean Sea,"My parents and I stayed at this hotel whilst on holiday in Barcelona. We couldn't have been more pleased. The staff was friendly and went out of their way to help us, especially Cristobel at the front desk.
The Executive Lounge offered a filling breakfast, as well as hot and cold appetizers in the evening, and free drinks.
My room had a wonderful view of both the Mediterranean Sea and the city.
It is located across from a shopping mall with some good restaurants in it.
I highly recommend this hotel!",5,2015,11,11
36,Worth Consideration,"I usually avoid chains abroad, but this was an emergency as weather forced our cruise line to put us up.
The hotel managed hundreds of displaced travelers with amazing grace (use of that phrase unavoidable). It had a good business center, free wifi in the lobby, with monitors, free electric converters to borrow, fabulous toiletries (Peter Thomas Roth), and washcloths.
I could see a lovely beach from my window. It looked public. The pool area had just closed but it looked great.
The breakfast was in the top three of my long life. It was free, yet it rivaled the Four Seasons in Chicago. (I had just left a cruise, too.) Several types of Iberian ham, all manner of other breakfast meats. You could have made a full English! I overheard staff volunteering special orders. Both coffee and tea were excellent and my waitress offered a to go cup.

The bad part was that the shower curtain was mildewed and the toilet ran constantly. Shower in the tub was great.",4,2015,11,09
36,Away from the Crowds,"A beautiful, modern hotel that is would appeal to the North American traveler visiting Barcelona.  Great front desk staff that were very accommodating and patient.  Large rooms and beds with lots of technology and good wifi in rooms.

It is well removed from most everything but shopping and the beaches, but it is only a few blocks away from a metro stop - a highly recommended option for those visiting the city - and about a €12-€14 cab ride to Las Ramblas.  Great city views, a little more elbow room than other places, and a good place for those seeking a little slower pace than something in the heart of the action.",5,2015,11,06
36,Hilton is always a winner!,"Though our stay was only one night following a cruise, it was a pleasant and enjoyable stay.  The staff were exceptionally helpful, friendly and accommodating.  The location was optimum.  Hope to return for more than one day.  Albuquerque Annie",5,2015,11,05
36,Our third visit to Barcelona and our third stay at this hotel,"We enjoyed this hotel again very much.  We had a room with a nice sea view and being Diamond we had access to the executive lounge which provided evening tapas and wine/beer/soft drinks.  

The metro station is only a short walk away.  This hotel is not in a busy part of the city which we always find nice after the crowds at the tourist areas.

We hope to return again sometime.  I would love to come back to see La Sagrada Familia when it is finished.  We toured the inside of the church this time for the first time and it was amazing.",5,2015,11,03
36,Excellent hotel and staff,"This is an amazing hotel, and likely one of the best hotels in Barcelona. The rooms have amazing sea views. The executive lounge is good with views. The service is excellent, especially by the reservations team to whom I would like really thank for taking note of my room preferences. Breakfast is super too – good selection and quality.

Highly recommended for business and pleasure.

A big thanks to everyone.",5,2015,11,01
36,Business hotels with poor wi-fi should be unacceptable in 2015,"Nice business hotel, great staff who were all very pleasant, excellent business meeting facilities too. I would not stay here for leisure but would be happy to come back for meetings etc. However, the wi-fi was intermittent at best, not strong enough for any large files, had to turn off and use data roaming so many times on phone just to keep up to date with daily emails.

We stayed for 3 days and had a great time overall but the hotel needs to work on their wi-fi if they are going to host business conferences.",4,2015,10,30
36,"Great hotel, breakfast, location; expensive thou","I stay at this hotel a few night this month and I loved it:

- Like most Hilton hotels, it looks imponent, with a large lobby area and a great room
- The breakfast was outstanding, with lots of international variety
- The location is great (close to the sea), although it's far from downtown

Now the sad part is that is the room rate was expensive, even with my corporate rate.",4,2015,10,29
36,Convenient hotel far from downtown,"This is my second stay in the hotel and i really enjoy it. I love the idea of being close to the seaside, and even the side views from my rooms on the city and sea were wonderful. The rooms are quite spacious and nice. Very good sleep quality. The breakfast is very nice as well with lots of different items. We used this hotel for a conference and had some difficulties checking in groups of people, as the check in process is rather lengthy. The wifi was not working properly, and i had to reconnect very often while working, which is very disturbing. Other than that, I have no complaints.",4,2015,10,29
36,"Pleasant staff, good location for business meetings","I am having a run of Hilton Hotels in recent weeks, London Kensington (see my earlier review), Barcelona last week and next will be Rome. This trip to Barcelona was for work. The staff I found pleasant, cheerful and helpful. I got back to my room during lunch-time for a break and it was not yet cleaned. I asked the house-keeper and she immediately got onto the case and cleaned my room in under 5 minutes, all with a smile. The breakfast was fresh and clean dining areas. If you are reading this, I guess you are wondering whether to book this, my question would be whether you are looking to stay for work or for holiday? I would not recommend for a holiday as is in the business commercial district of Barcelona and huge sky-rise buildings and not much of an atmosphere. I would choose a location closer to the buzzing harbour region. For work purposes is adequate. The interior of the room decor was in need of some attention (see photos attached ). I was looking forward to the view from my sea facing room, unfortunately, this was not all that clear due to the condition of the windows, see photos. Also the mirror in the bathroom was in need of some attention (see photo). Overall, these were fairly minor points. Generally you will get what you expect from a standard Hilton (apart from a towel bathrobe- I did not have this in my room!)",3,2015,10,26
36,Good,"The hotel is nice, located very close to beach but in order to go to city center you need to take the subway or take taxi, subway station is close to hotel,  rooms are good, breakfast is nice a very good swimming pool and nice gym. Internet is free in the lobby and as a member of hilton hotel club you can have free wifi in your room.",4,2015,10,26
36,From great to I wish I never have to go there ever again.,"I am starting to get a horrible perception of places that only feel the need to be of service to a client once. I enjoyed my stay at this hotel having visited it three times that I decided ... mistakenly ... to go there again. 
There seems to be a general trend in terrible customer service, which is something we can learn to live with, but what is worse is that the staff has a general opinion that it's OK for them to insult the guest and that, due to the fact that the hotel has more choice in customers than the guest has in hotels - nothing is going to happen. 
Indeed, that is what was the case this time, from booking with staff that acts like children by confirming and then claiming that they didn't, down to housekeeping that can clean a space as big as half of my house in ten minutes or less, while there is no accountability, there will of course be no recourse. 
When booking, we requested a ""very"" specific class of room - and were told, and confirmed - not once, but four times, that we were assured that this is the room that we would get - so we set off for a drive all night to get to Barcelona, only to arrive there to the usual set of four hundred or so vans being tended to be eleven trainees and one supervisor, and of course the usual - ignoring the hundred or so guests in line while three trainees tend to the one highly technical and highly sophisticated question of ""how can you get to the taxi stand ?"" (it's 100m from the hotel, line of sight) we were finally received by a trainee, who gracefully welcomed us to the Sevilla Hilton (yep...) ... Okay, the usual motions of credit card, passport, and of course, membership card, and we get told that ""okay sir, your room is on the fifth floor"" ... 
Considering we had requested a completely different room - this of course started the usual discussion ""it's not on the computer, person X who confirmed it has gone home for the day, no you cannot speak to the front desk manager, who is in (the usual) meeting, he will be happy to rectify this problem tomorrow (exactly, and that is the reason why they will apologise for the terrible misunderstanding due to the one night's brief stay we could not resolve it for you in time...but we will speak to our colleagues to make sure such an issue never happens again...  sound familiar ?)  and no manager is here to speak to you"" ... For once, it really got to me that perhaps - and maybe, just maybe, the way to get your voice heard is to make a scene... 
....but, that didn't happen, because the trainee did see that we were not going anywhere till this matter was solved, so, within 2 minutes, she magically got the FD manager out of his ""meeting"" to approve the horizontal upgrade, and we did in fact get the high floor room we wanted, asked if it was ready ""oh yes sir, it's ready..."" up we go... 
All's well of course in the room, we ordered our room service lunch - the room service people remembered us from the previous stay ! That was awesome ! (Thanks a lot guys if you're reading this, your burger is still the best in Barcelona ! with or without the Foie Gras !) 
The nice thing about the furniture in the hilton is that, despite the fact that it is slightly dated, it is very comfortable, the seats / sofa (if you get one) are very plush and the TV is nicely placed to be seen from all over the room. Bathrooms have good water pressure which allows for a nice shower (will get to that). Went to take an afternoon siesta on the just as comfortable bed... order the down pillows if you're feeling like a good sleep ! 
We went down to the restaurant for dinner after that, and were pleasantly surprised to see that it was still staffed by the same ladies who served us during our last stay. The speed and quality of service is second to none and I can recommend a little of anything and everything, but do try their catalan cream ! 
Later that night, before going to bed, decided to take a shower... As soon as I got into the tub I had the feeling of something furry touching me, turned around to see  enough hair from someone stuck to the wall to make it seem like a fur fight had gone on there... After hurling everything in my stomach I called housekeeping and asked them to clean it up, but decided against pursuing it further to not have to go through the blood-boiling process of hearing ""we can't answer the phones because reception is too busy"" or a guest services associate completely ignoring you because ""the hotel is full"". 
(remember, Barcelona gets 30 million tourists a year - the sheer numbers are overwhelming to any institution - but fixing it means getting less profits, ergo let's just putt-putt past the summer and train our trainees into the winter and hope they get better next year). 
The following day, we went to breakfast in the lounge - this is another really good part of staying at this hotel and the food - while limited, is actually quite nice - I like the Juice selection so I do recommend you spend extra and go out and eat on the terrace, the view alone is worth the difference in price. 
We went down to check out after breakfast, and unfortunately, we got met by the FD manager who did apologise for the fiasco during the checkin.... 
But... If you travel as much as we do, I recommend you look out for the telltale signs that come with that apology. Do you know what happens when you complain ? The points that are due on your membership account for that particular stay... They will not show up... Forcing you of course to go through the long and extremely arduous procedure of claiming them via HHonors. That happened to me ! 
Strangely, I will say it again, I do recommend this hotel, for the simple fact that of the hotels I have stayed in in Barcelona, this is one of the very few where there are staff who take it upon themselves to take the initiative and help the guest when the guest needs it, in that hotel, they are not hard to spot. Just look for those that will come to you when they see you in need of help and not walk around you like roadkill. I specially want to thank Carlos, in the lobby, Jordi (again - you're awesome ! I wish they could clone you !) Victoria (sorry if I didn't spell your name right again) and all the wonderful staffmembers who take pride and value guest satisfaction. It is my hope that the management of this hotel does improve in some of the grey areas, and that they set-up internet wifi that actually works !. 
One final remark - this hotel does a wonderful job helping a childrens society in the Diagonal Mar area. The extra thumbs up in my rating is for my admiration of the consistent objective goals in helping those that need it most. Good work !",3,2015,10,25
36,Buenos Dias,Helpful staff. Great location. Adequate service in Lobby Bar. Comfortable room. Alarm clock in room did not work and could not be adjusted/fixed. Room maid never re-stocked coffee packets. I heard waste water draining through the pipes all night...sounded like someone was watering my hotel room door.,4,2015,10,25
36,BEAUTIFUL OCEAN VIEWS GREAT LOCATION,I enjoyed staying in this hotel with its beautiful views of the sea.  We were on the 18th floor so the views were wonderful.  There is the biggest mall in barcelona right across the street with every store and restaurant you might want.  It is close to all the tourist on and off busses and the hotel gives you a discount pass.  They have a restaurant which is very good.,5,2015,10,23
36,Nice Hilton property with all the Hilton amenities.,"Spacious, well furnished room.  Great view from Executve floor window.
Nice restaurant. Also many other restaurants just accross the street.
Minor language difficulties with some of the staff, but always someone to help out.

Would stay there again if we ever come back to Barcelona.",4,2015,10,23
36,A relaxing and comfortable stay...,"My wife and I had a lovely 4 night stay at this hotel. Whilst this hotel is not located in the heart of the city, the great (and cheap) Metro links into the city made this hotel an ideal location to relax  but quickly you can be in the city exploring the many sights. We had an corner executive room on the 22nd floor  with great views the sea. The Executive Lounge was a great place to relax and enjoy your breakfast or unwind after a busy day sightseeing with snack and drinks. The staff were friendly and helpful which ensured that the viisit to the hotel and the beautiful city an enjoyable one.We would return to this hotel again if we visited Barcelona.",5,2015,10,22
36,"Great location, but property in need of refresh","Stayed here for a week in September.  Had 3 separate bookings, and was told at check-in that he had merged them together.  It worked well from first to second, but when it came to the 3rd (just the last night), it was a fail.  Not only were we checked out, but I received a, ""thank you for your stay,"" email.  Housekeeping wasn't done that day, fridge locked, etc.  It was fixed (in pieces) after we let the front desk/housekeeping know, but it was a rather pain to deal with.

Internet in the room was nearly worthless.  When there was a signal (which was rather rare), it dropped within 10 minutes.  Thankfully I had gotten a SIM card for an old phone that allowed me to create a hotspot for other devices.

The rooms do have hardwood floors, but after several years it has gotten quite scratched.  Definitely in need of refresh/resurfacing.

I can't remember ever being at a hotel in the past (even a Motel 6) where towels had holes in them, and some quite large.  Plus many towels had strings creating a fringe on the sides.  Not sure if the hotel is skimping on replacing towels or if housekeeping is simply not checking them.

The bed was short-sheeted.  It is common for hotels to use 2 flat sheets, one should go tucked into the top of the bed, then the other the bottom.  This way you should have a rather clean sheet between you and any other bedding.  At this hotel, they only used 1 sheet on the bed, which means your body has to touch the comforter.

Breakfast in the restaurant was good.  Staff do get a bit overwhelmed during peak hours, but that is to be expected.  After trying them once, I avoided the churros and chocolate, as the churros tasted frozen and the chocolate was very watered down.

The pool was actually rather nice.  They do events on weekends, so you need to be careful about that.  But during the week, I never had a problem swimming.  I'd guess it was 20m, and most of the time I was the only person in it.
That said, if you want to swim, and the weather permits, I'd highly suggest just walking ~5 min to the beach.  This property definitely has location going for it, Llevante beach is an easy stroll (and from Llevante you can connect to all the other beaches if you want to).

There's a mall across the street with an assortment of shops and restaurants.  We found the supermarket very convenient for water and snacks.

Just beyond the mall is a tram line, and just beyond that is an underground metro.  Depending where you are headed, the tram may be the better choice (and you can see outside).

Overall an average stay for this property.",3,2015,10,20
36,Way better than i expected!!!!,"I stayed in Barcelona at this hotel in august and i must say that i spent an amazing time! I had a room on the 15th floor with access to the executive lounge (the service, the views and the happy hour are simply fantastic!) 
The concierge was very well informed, friendly and professional (i would like to thank Georgiana for her patience and for her recommendations)
The restaurant Indiggo had delicious food and a great service!!
All in one, i would highly recommend this hotel!!!!!!",5,2015,10,19
36,Excellent for business ,"Much above standard of usual Hilton hotels. Comfortable and spacious corner room, bed superb, nice views over sea. Excellent service from reception to bar (fairly expensive for Spain). Outside city center and you don't want to stay in this area unless you are here for business.",5,2015,10,17
36,Could happily live there,"Wonderful hotel in fabulous city. The location is great - across the street from a mall with a wide variety of restaurants, boutiques, and a huge department/grocery store; a short walk to the highly efficient, easy to use, and cheap metro, a short walk to the beach, and a long and fabulous walk into the old town for folks like us who enjoy walking. The room (executive) was spacious, super comfortable, and had a great view of the Mediterranean Sea. The executive lounge was among the best I have experienced - very spacious with a wonderfully large outdoor balcony, nice wine, and healthy and varied canapés. We really enjoyed spending the early evening sipping wine, munching on good snacks, watching the sunset over the city and the cruise ships coming and going. The staff were uniformly amazing in their helpfulness, friendliness, and facility with the English language. All our needs were taken care of quickly (even a charger for our cell phone) and with the utmost courtesy. I hated to leave (although we were there for 10 days) and long to return.",5,2015,10,16
36,Room OK. Staff Rude,"Decided to stay someplace new - probably  should not have - it's not convenient 
to the city - everywhere you go is a 20 taxi ride.  

Rooms are ok - but the staff especially the front desk staff is not efficient,  I waited over 30 minutes to check in - 2 girls were not 
busy - but they only did check outs - will not be back asthere are better places in Barcelona .

Thanks!  C!

36,"Our second fabulous leisurely holiday here this year - gluten free, care free","We had already visited here March this year and enjoyed it so much that the decision of where to go in September was easily made. Frankly, this hotel had already ticked all the boxes for us on previous visits. The hotel caters expertly for gluten free diets, coeliac ( UK) , celiac (US), especially if you pre-inform management, which we did. Our contact was Yolanda Llorca. She notified all relevant staff of our gluten free requirement.
We travelled from Barcelona el-prat airport and back using Hoppa, who are very competitive and offer a good service; a meet and greet at the airport and a 25 minute B-line to the hotel with no suprises. We would never recommend hiring your own car in Barcelona for a short break since the Barcelona driving seems so adrenaline charged. In fact I would say we pulled more G's in the taxis than during the entire plane journey! (Monarch airlines were very good). At the hotel we stayed in room 1920. It was very clean and tidy. Also fabulous views of sea and city!
New to us was an outside recreational area within the hotel and part of the hotel  called Purobeach - it is found on floor 2 and is a tastefully laid out area having many sun loungers, parasols and tables.The sun loungers are free to hotel guests. Towels are provided. Food, drinks and snacks were available. The is a good sized pool for adults and a paddling pool for children. Also there was an outside restaurant (menu is marked for most dietary needs) and bar area with a barbeque at the weekend. It does busy up at weekends and you can reserve a lounger for a fee. There's complimentary wifi. Mood music is played, which gives way to a DJ and louder music at the weekend. A little too loud at times for us. For this reason, I would recommend you pre-confirm a room not overlooking this area if you are hoping to catch up on sleep during the day ( eg if you're jetlagged). Our room had no such problem. The executive lounge was available to us and it has a lovely balcony overlooking Barcelona on floor 15. Breakfast is available there - but limited in range. We chose the full-range hot and cold buffet breakfast in the main Indigo restaurant on floor 1. (The restaurant also cooked us fresh breakfasts to cater especially for our dietary requirement.)Then we would go to the executive lounge for a relax and plan our day over more free drinks. By day there is made available complimentary soft drinks, snacks and some newspapers. In the evening, complimentary alcoholic drinks are also available.
This hotel is ideally situated with nearby tourist bus stops, tram stations and a metro station. There is also a shopping mall across the road which holds restaurants, fast food outlets, a full range of clothing shops and also a large, well-priced supermarket.",5,2015,10,16
36,Not the best value for money,"The Hilton has quite the reputation, but sadly we found it a little hard to see why here in Barcelona.

The hotel was fully booked, so that might have hurt the experience a little, but we did not get the high level service we associate with the Hilton brand.

Barcelona is a very cheap city, damaging the price/quality ratio even further. You pay 19euro for breakfast per person at the Hilton (25 if you decide to have breakfast in the hotel -after- checkin. This is beyond unreasonable. The breakfast is not that spectacular, especially for that price. 

The staff is very friendly, but even they could not compensate for us being a little disappointed. 

Would not recommend.

36,"memorable,  enjoyable, and superior accommodation","This hotel is not close to the central downtown -- it is about a half hour away by the metro -- but it offers superior accommodation and is close to the beach for nice walks and to a large mall for shopping, lunch, and coffee. The staff were very attentive, friendly, and highly professional. Our room was clean, spacious, and quiet, with a good view of the sea and beach. The executive lounge was nicely designed on the 15th floor with a nice spread of food and wine and good views of the sea and city. An advantage of this hotel is that it is away from the bustle of the city. But the Gothic Quarter and attractions can be easily reached by the metro, which is inexpensive and easy to learn how to navigate. Were we to come back to Barcelona, this is where we would stay.",4,2015,10,15
36,Wonderful stay,"The hotel was clean and very nice.  Was there while a conference was going on, and the staff was very accommodating.  The rooms are pretty large and the hotel is conveniently located very close to the subway and across the street from the mall and lots of restaurants.  It's very easy to get to Las Ramblas and other areas that are good for site-seeing and experiences.  It is also right next to the conference center in Barcelona.  I would recommend staying here.  The only reason that the rating is not 5 stars is because of the breakfast in the morning.  I've stayed at many Hiltons, and the breakfast here was not very good in comparison, which was surprising.  There were a lot of pastry options, fruit, and yogurt, and if you're a meat eater, there were some hot options for you as well.  Overall everyone I was with didn't think the food quality was that good.  Also, there weren't many options for vegetarians and the scrambled eggs were consistently runny.  The room had wifi, but due to the hotel being very full, it wasn't very consistent.  It was also free for me because I was here for a conference, so I'm not sure if it's normally free or not.",4,2015,10,14
36,"A little out of the way, but all the better for that!","It's nowhere near the Gothic Quarter, but lies in the near vicinity of Montjuic and is easily accessible to the many famed attractions of Barcelona by metro: there are two stations nearby. Or, if you're on vacation and feeling lazy, the large taxi rank is immediately outside the front door across a broad expanse of plaza. Better still, directly opposite is the huge Diagonal Mar Mall, with over 42 restaurants, more boutiques than you can poke a stick at, and a gigantic supermarket where you can stock up on good water instead of paying those exorbitant onboard prices. We enjoyed our Executive Room, with two double beds, superior bathroom amenities, panoramic views over the sea and - best of all - accost the Executive Lounge, with the refreshments and, from 1800-2000, drinks and canapés, a meal in itself, and well worth theatre expense. I'd have to say that this Hilton property is looking a little tired, but the level of service, the warmth of the welcome and the efficiency of its operations still make it a pleasure to stay here. If you're not staying in an executive room, you can still enjoy two other restaurants, a small pool (and a wading pool for young children) and an overcrowded sun deck.",4,2015,10,13
36,"Good hotel, great staff -  but in need of some extra TLC","My friend and I have just returned from a short break to Barcelona.  We booked the Hilton Diagonal Mar as wanted a coastal location yet to be relatively close to the city.

It is clear from the location of this hotel that it's primary target market is the business traveller and therefore we managed our expectations accordingly. 

Upon arrival, we were greeted in a friendly and professional manner.  Despite arriving much earlier than the advertised check-in time, we were given our room straight away.  A few other reviews had mentioned long queues at the front desk but while the hotel seemed busy, we didn't see any throughout the weekend.

We were on the 7th floor and the corridor leading to our room had an unpleasant odour (similar to dead fish), this was present throughout the weekend but seemed confined to the corridor - not in the room or lobby area.

The room was clean, well presented and perfectly functional.  In terms of the TLC required throughout the hotel, increased maintainence of cawking around shower/bath; wooden fixtures which have been scratched; scuffed decor - nothing that has negatively impacted on our stay as such, more that extra efforts to maintain the property would align it more to what you'd typically expect from Hilton.

We didn't eat in the hotel, the Mall opposite fit our requirements adequately for breakfast - though note that the Mall doesn't open until 11am on Sundays.

In terms of getting out and about,  Taxi from BCN airport cost EUR 35.00; taxi to City Centre cost EUR 10.00; it's also on the City Sight Seeing Bus Green Route although this only runs until 1st November.",3,2015,10,12
36,Enjoyed my stay,"Spent 6 nights here and enjoyed my stay.

The location is great - near the beach and directly opposite a shopping mall (what woman wouldn't like that :-) Lots of restaurants opposite too.

The rooms were clean, and there was lots of variety in the hotel restaurant, authentic Spanish food cooked well.

Would definitely stay again",5,2015,10,11
36,Wonderful short break experience,"Stayed at this hotel for 4 nights in an executive suite on the 16th floor we chose it because we wanted somewhere a little quieter than the centre of the City and despite the hotel being full we did not experience any noise once in the room which was situated on the corner with 180 degree views of the mediterranean, city and Pyrenees, cannot review it highly enough for our needs.",5,2015,10,11
36,Modern Look-Not so good.,"It might be modern, but it does not translate to quality.  Others hotels are much better, like the Miramar Hotel in Old Barcelona!  Better views and feel.  Staff was a bit rude.  It felt like they did not like foreigners and it felt like they were talking down to you because you did not speak their language or may be because we were Americans. Not sure which one.  The location of the hotel is in the new area of Barcelona, far from the city center (walking distance) and airport.",2,2015,10,10
36,Prof Dr,"Poor interaction check in staff. Long waiting time for check in. Lack of understanding with request previous check in Formal answers from the staff; no intention to make the guest comfortable. I suggest more emphatic behaviour. Hilton has a famous name but my experience this time has been below expectation. I am very disappointed, indeed",2,2015,10,08
36,Very Disappointing,"As a lifetime Hilton Honors Diamond member I spend a lot of time in Hilton properties. While this is far from the worst experience it was very disappointing.  First the desk was argumentative about giving family members in a second room access to the executive lounge.  The lounge was poorly staffed with third tier food at breakfast and cocktail hour. The worst was the room with a laminate floor on the penthouse level.  
The bathroom had mold in the grout....we could not walk barefoot in the room with having black soles on our feet.  The front desk staff ranged from very friendly and helpful to snotty.  We won't be back.",3,2015,10,07
36,It's the Small Things that Matter,"Stayed here 4 nights - tea/coffee not replenished even once!
More unbelievably the toilet paper - by the 3rd day we just bought our own!!!
Wifi - couldn't connect - reception no help just said it was our devices - had 5 devices between 3 of us - funny how they were all broken!
It's a hot country and despite paying premium prices for this hotel they still charge you 5.50 Euros for a small bottle of water in the room - penny pinching.
Gym - few machines they have are on top of each other and the exercise floor is only big enough for 1 person.
The room it'self is nice enough and the pool area but I wouldn't stay here again, not worth the money - expect much better from Hilton.",2,2015,10,05
36,Top hotel,"Stayed here many times but not for a few years, have to say I think it has improved, from the lovely people at the front desk to the fantastic breakfast,which has lovely fresh orange juice,fruit,pastries anf eggs anyway you like.",5,2015,10,05
36,Disappointing for a Hilton Hotel,"We arrived early, after getting off our cruise ship. The check in took a long time, only 2 people on the desk!  Our room was not ready, so they suggested an upgrade which would be an additional charge if we wanted our room right now! We refused and went back after some sightseeing.   We sat around the pool, which would have been very relaxing, except for the loud music booming out. Had to wait a long time to get the pool towels  again lack of staff!

The bedroom was spacious and very comfortable. We had breakfast, but not a great meal for 19 euros per person.  It was more like a staff canteen, had to wait a long time to get our coffee and the food was not brilliant!

Very disappointing!",3,2015,10,03
36,Good Business Hotel,"Hotel is a good business hotel. Has a Hilton Lounge on the 15th floor. The hotel is located on the coast on the northern end of the Barcelona. If you are looking for a hotel for central Barcelona meetings, it's convenient and there are lots of companies in the area. We had meetings on the other end of Barcelona - can take you 1.5 hours to go 25 km, so prepare appropriately. There is a gym at the hotel, relatively cramped. Usually the weather is great and can run across the street and have access to the Barcelona waterfront. There is a good 6-8 miles round trip that can be done on the waterfront. Enjoyed the running. I'd stay again.",4,2015,10,02
36,Good for business and conferences...,"A little disappointed with this hotel for our annual convention.
It's just OK but, for the money, it should be much better. It's not just bthe cost of the rooms, drinks prices here are outlandish - drink outside the hotel! 
Service is variable, from just OK on reception to very friendly in the bars....
Rooms are nice and airy, air con not great, but immaculately clean.
Pool area was a disappointment, unless you're into loud clubby music - they really do need something much more tasteful, during the day at least....... and much quieter.",3,2015,10,02
36,Great location; Nice hotel!,"Hotel is in a good location close to the beach and the train.  Service in the hotel was lacking.  Concierge was ill informed on many of the local aspects of transportation, dining, etc.  Food at hotel restaurant was average at best.  Hotel rooms are very clean and the hotel is quiet.  Music around the pool was extremely loud and was focused on the rap/hip-hop crowd.",3,2015,10,01
36,Business trip,"Which hotel has a 4pm check in? I understand that the Spanish people  enjoy their siesta, but 4pm?

We arrived at 1pm after a stop over in London from Singapore so we weren't thrilled to wait for 3 hours. They offered an upgrade to club for for an extra €80 which we took. Funnily enough, there couple next to us had booked club floor but were told that their room is not available until 4pm - which is strange as this type of room was available for us who paid the surcharge. Anyway, we met the other couple in the executive lounge where they waited until 4 pm... Unhappily. Good revenue maximisation; bad customer service. 

Maybe it's Europe but even in club floor rooms, there are no amenities (tooth paste/brush), water etc. 

I've also tried the gym and its not fantastic but you can have a decent workout.

Also, don't stay too close to the elevator (our room is 01), the service door is banging nonstop!",3,2015,10,01
36,NOT WORHT THE MONEY,Internet didn't work almost at all. High price not worth the money + not good location for sighseeing Rooms were cleaned everyday. Diagonal Mar big shopping center is on the other side of the street with good variete of stores and restaurants.,3,2015,09,30
36,Very business property,"A good quality business like property, no particular wow effect. Rooms are specious, bathrooms comfortable, nice view from sea side rooms. A very good situation to go to the beach or for a morning/evening jogging. A little bit far from the city center if you're a leisure traveler.
A big thank you to Reception team. Thanks to them we could move from the smoking room on the 4th floor to a non-smoking room. Your care is highly appreciated.",4,2015,09,29
36,Good hotel but not if you don't like loud music,"The hotel is nice enough - large comfortable rooms, friendly staff, decent location. I only have two complaints: 1) the Wi-fi was very slow and unreliable, and 2) the Purobeach pool area - so annoying! On the weekends, you have to pay for a reservation, if you can get one. It's basically a disco with a pool. My room overlooked it. So whenever I was in my room, I could hear the same techno pounding beat, over and over, (music was very limited) until late at night. Ask for a room facing the street.",3,2015,09,27
36,close to beach with a great pool,"While this would not be my first choice on a visit to Barcelona if it were my first time there and I wanted to sightsee as it is quite far out from the historic centre, this is a good hotel with helpful staff. I was here as my husband had a conference and as I have been in Barcelona many times before I settled myself by the pool area and really enjoyed a relaxing few days! 
It is also a short walk to the beach and just opposite a huge, actually make that an enormous, shopping centre it would be possible to spend an entire day in there. The food isn't great in the hotel but there are many options close by and some fabulous ones a taxi ride away. Main issue would be that the room shower needed attention. Clean but tatty.",4,2015,09,27
36,Excellent location with nice food ,"Stayed there for the Mobile World Congress 
A very nice luxurious hotel. 
It is far from city but with easy access through metro.
A nice business hotel.
Hotel was very professional handling the huge number of guests and the several events taking place during MWC 
",4,2015,09,26
36,"Great View, excellent conceirge lounge","Room on corner on 14th floor, most excellent.  Huge bathroom and nice bed.
Across street from Mall with 45 restaurants.  We tried Wein Bar, fun guys and great dogs.  Panchito's surprisingly good food.  Bus Turistica good to see entire city in two days.  Buy 2 day pass and take one route one day and another next day. Walked to beach one and half blocks.  Good wifi.  No jacuzzi, needed one.  Had cool massage pool but who wants cool.  Nice swimming pool and deck but couldn't use it at nite always a private party going.",5,2015,09,26
36,Good but no personalized service and too crowded.,"Hello there!  I am always booking this hotel when on business trip in Barcelona because of its location. It is just next to the office I need to visit.  I booked a room on the executive floor and used the lounge for breakfast/drinks/snacks.  

I used the Purbeach (pool) which is a nice concept but you will not be able to relax as the music is very loud... :)  It looks like as of October they will put back the normal set up.

The hotel is becoming more and more crowded and the front desk officers are not so responsive as before.  When booking the Hilton in Asia you are for sure getting a much better service (lounge, efficiency of personnel, food, ....)

I don't know whether I will book the Hilton when back in Barcelona. I felt a bit like in a factory...

Drop me a line if you need more information.

Ciao, Sara",4,2015,09,25
36,Nice location and nice service ,Choose this Hilton for my first visit to Barcelona.  Great location near the beach and the mall.  Being next to the mall was great.  Did a little shopping and bought some snacks for the room to cut down on cost. 10 euro taxi ride to all major locations in Barcelona.,4,2015,09,25
36,"Nice property, but let down by the details","I stayed here for 5 nights while attending a conference in the nearby conference centre. I booked an executive room, which was located on the 19th floor.

First the good points. The room was comfortable and had a good view over the sea. The executive lounge on the 15th floor has a good range of snacks in the evening and an adequate breakfast in the morning. The roof terrace is great, if a little windy sometimes. The gym has a good range of equipment, but like many hotel gyms some equipment is defective. Staff in the bar were friendly.

Now the bad points. The reception often had large queues, resulting in irritatingly long waits. They were not particularly helpful either. For example when we arranged a late checkout we asked if our keys could be updated (so we didn't get locked out of at 12:00).   This simple request was initially refused and we were told to come back tomorrow morning. When we insisted (we didn't want to queue again) our request was granted, but with lots of sighs. 

The pool is located in some sort of urban beach club, with a lot guests from outside and a lot  noise. Not a great environment for a simple swim after using the gym.

Finally breakfast in the lounge on the weekends finishes at 11:00, while the lounge itself closes between 11:00-12:00 for cleaning. This means its impossible to collect something to eat just  before the buffet closes. Moving the cleaning time to 11:30-12:30 would solve this.",3,2015,09,25
36,Great hotel and perfect for business meeting,"The hotel is located just along the cost, it's very well furnished and I was lucky because I had a room at the 21st floor with a great view of the sea. Wake up every morning was a real pleasure! 
Actually I was here for a three days business meeting with a large number of people (more than 100) and everything went well.
Maybe the only negative side is that the. Plenary meeting room is very dark with no windows and only artificial lights. 
But a part from that the location is really in the center with a mall just crossing the street. 
The meal was good and available at any time. 
The people at the reception was very nice and they made their best to make the stay welcoming. ",4,2015,09,21
36,Disappointing,"As a Hilton property I expected a level of service, cleanliness and room conditions similar to other Hiltons around the world.  Unfortunately, the service was inattentive.  Perhaps the staff were over worked or simply didn't care.  In a country with 25% youth unemployment (which is the demographic of most hotel staff) either the management could hire more people or better quality of workers.  The room we were in looked old and the bed and couch were dirty and scratched as if a cat was a previous guest.  Hilton, this is not one of your nicer properties.",2,2015,09,20
36,Great hotel but pricy.,"As a Hilton Honors member I feel I understand the value of a hotel property and it's amenities. Upon arrival we were greeted and baggage was handled right away. The front desk experience was exceptional (Thank you Maria) and I felt the lobby area, elevator, and halls were clean and tidy. The room was nice, bedding good even great and it was tidy, clean, and stocked. The view was good and having the mall right beside the property was definitely a plus. I feel this property is probably a hot ticket during beach season and attracts a somewhat polished clientele. However for the off season and while we did have a junior suite, I just felt a bit gouged. I have had just as much ""luxury"" and presentation at other properties for less money. I am by no means a bargain hunter and believe you get what you pay for. It was just downright expensive for the sake of being expensive. That being said, I would stay at this property again but make sure I did so during the in season.",4,2015,09,20
36,Pros and Cons,"I am checking out of this hotel this morning after a three night stay.  I am traveling on my own with two young children before a disney cruise.  The room was great with an extra bed for my older child.  The mall across the street provides lots to do without traveling downtown.  The breakfast was included in the room rate and was very, very, good.

However, this hotel misses the mark on some very important things.  First of all, Nell services needs much improvement.  I showed up in a taxi after 18 hours of travel with two young kids, and there was nobody to help us with luggage upon arrival.  So I had to haul a stroller, toddler, two huge suitcases, and other travel gear all on my own through a maze of stairs and ramps to the front desk where there were three bellboys just chatting away and ignoring me.  I had to interrupt their conversation to ask for help getting my bags up the last flight of steps to check in.  Now, when I call them to bring my bags back down to the lobby before checkout, they show up without any sort of claim ticket to give me in exchange.  This is really basic, guys, and disappointing for a Hilton.

The wifi worked well.  I am an HHonors member so it should be free in my room.  I've not seen my bill yet but have a bad feeling I will be charged. The pool area,  although it does have kiddie pool, it not at all welcoming to families with the loud music and slippery steps.

The room service was good, but when I discovered that housekeeping hadn't left a bucket in the room for ice, I was told that they could bring me one for six euros.  What??

So this hotel isn't terrible, but as one of the hotels recommended for disney cruise travelers, it should pay more attention to the need of families.",3,2015,09,19
36,Beautiful view of the Mediterranean,Very nice hotel. Lovely setting. Good service. Distant from the center city but peaceful. Expect a €20 taxi charge. Less than 10 minutes walk to a small beach. The purobeach beach pool on floor 2 is lovely.,4,2015,09,18
36,Mr. P,"My wife had a business trip to Barcelona. I joined her for a few days of sightseeing. We were assigned a room on the 16th floor. It was quiet with a great view of both the sea and the city. 
The room was comfortable in spite of having twin beds, the only choice being those or a double bed. The room was clean and spacious. Good bathroom. 
We only took breakfast in the hotel; the buffet was great. We had numerous drinks and snacks in the lounge, all great. They make a terrific-and unique-gin and tonic. 
The hotel's proximity to the shopping mall, with excellent restaurants, was very helpful. ",4,2015,09,17
36,Great location overlooking the city,"This is a great hotel if you want to be close to the city and beaches, with good transport links.  Very good staff and service and good facilities.  Restaurant was OK and although the pool area was good it suffered from a constant thumping beat of so called music which disturbed the peace.",5,2015,09,17
36,Strives to be a 5-star but misses the mark; poor pool concept,"First of all, Hilton Diagonal Mar is a very good hotel. However, it does not quite live up to the standards of a 5-star, and one of the biggest problems is the new Purobeach pool concept. We were travelling with a toddler, so I spent some time beforehand looking for a hotel with a kiddie pool so that we could have a litlle splash around in the afternoons. I was happy to find out Hilton Diagonal Mar has one. However, what they don't advertise at all is that the pool area is adults only on weekends after 4 pm, with loud music and trendy young things lounging around. So much for refreshing at the pool after a day of sightseeing. Even if you are not travelling with children, you can forget about relaxing by the pool with a book, as the music was so loud that we could hear it in our room on the 20th floor (the pool is located on second floor). The pool area also tended to be full with no sunbeds available for hotel guests. In a 5-star hotel the guests should have priority for amenities such as the pool! The pool personnel was very friendly, though.

There are also several smaller issues that contribute to the hotel not quite living up to the 5-star expectations. The lack of free wifi in the rooms is ridiculous, as even the mall across the street has free wifi for customers, as did almost every restaurant we visited. The cleaning was not very detailed (we arrived to find dark hairs on the bathroom floor), it took housekeeping hours to provide our room with the requested crib, and they regularly forgot to replenish some of our towels. I would also recommend adding a sign that says ""please clean"" that can be hung on the door, since we often had to get back to the room for naptime in afternoon and that seemed to be the time they were cleaning rooms. Once they missed ours completely (although a call to the reception fixed this), a sign would have prevented this.

Otherwise we enjoyed our stay. We had an executive room with executive lounge access and breakfast. The breakfast was satisfactory. We had great views over the city and to the sea from our room, and were welcomed with complimentary water and some sweets. The staff was friendly. The hotel is located right across the street from a shopping centre, which has lots of shops and restaurants and a hypermarket (and free wifi!). The shopping centre also has a children's playgound and a Lego play room, and there's another playground in the park next to the hotel. The beach is a few blocks away. There's also a metro station nearby with lifts (but if you need one, be warned: not all metro stations in the city have them).

Overall, a very enjoyable stay except for the pool concept.",4,2015,09,16
36,Great hotel,"Great location, few minutes to beach but not too far from centre. Friendly, helpful staff, special thanks to Giovanni. Large spotless rooms, we booked executive rooms which gives access to executive lounge. Loved the pool and sunbeds. Would definitely stay again.",5,2015,09,16
36,"Excellent service, great location","Huge mall is just outside the hotel's doorstep so you can do a bit of shopping and there's wide variety of restaurants as well as fast food..

So if you fancy swimming, hotel is only 3 minutes walk from the beach but if you want to just relax on a sunbed while sipping a cold drink, spend your time in 'purobeach' in Hilton Hotel.

Hilton is only 15-20 min ride via taxi to get directly to places like sagrada familia etc..

Try to book a room with executive lounge access and you'll be able to enjoy nearly 360 degrees view of Barcelona with free food, nibbles and drinks while relaxing. There is also complimentary wifi.

Tour bus is just a minute walk from the hotel and goes a long way to touristic places.

The staff let us check in early so we were able to freshen up and got a little bit of rest before we went to check out the shopping mall.",5,2015,09,15
36,Liked the hotel hated Purobeach!,"Nice Hilton hotel with great service.  Can't believe for a business hotel there is not free wifi in rooms though!!

Only negative would be the Purobeach concept.  When we booked the hotel this wasnt in operation but had been converted.  As a hotel resident we were made to feel like second class citizens and unless we coughed up euros for a poolside bed.  However these were full of young trendys drinking.  The hotel seems to be a bit confused though as there was a large group of tourists (ourselves included) staying before a disney cruise so we took our toddler in the pool wearing her anna and elsa swimsuit - not quite the image I imagine they are going for??

I was pleased to have booked a city view which didnt have a pool view so I didnt have to hear the purobeach music through the night.

Hilton - I think you need to decide who is your target audience with this hotel as you seem a bit confused!",4,2015,09,13
36,Choose for business rather than leisure?,"Out of town location but on the plus side it is only a few stops on the metro into the city centre for sightseeing .  A five day metro/tram/funicular ticket was approx £24 each and covered the entire city and beyond, so travel was excellent value and the transport system was easy to use, not crowded and clean.
The hotel is in the suburbs directly opposite a large shopping mall with a range of places to eat from Subway and McDonalds to Tapas bars and moderately priced independents.  There is a large children's play area opposite the hotel and it's close to a small sandy beach. The walk to the beach isn't attractive (bridge over a dual carriageway) and the beach itself is small and bordered by concrete with only one beach stall which sold burgers and ice creams.
 We booked a superior room and had a choice of sea view of city view.  We were on 14th floor and the 'sea view' is literally just a glimpse of the sea between two office blocks, the city view is much better.  We are a Hilton Honours members and requested an early check-in, that didn't happen and we didn't get into our room until 4.30pm having arrived at 1.30pm which was disappointing.
The pool has a 'party atmosphere' every weekend, this consists of trance music, drum and bass (and I do mean BASS) relentlessly for hours at volume, while too many staff keep asking if they can get you drinks. The music was too loud to listen to music on headphones or read and guests beside us said it  brought to mind music played during torture sequences in films. Mid week the drum and bass continues unabated albeit at a lower volume.  I asked for it to be turned down a little mid week and was completely ignored twice even though other guests also made the same request of the pool staff.  I finally got dressed and walked down to the front desk and asked again as I found it just too loud for relaxing and reading, it was then lower to a more background level.  There are far too many pool staff and too few cleaning staff.  Our room regularly went uncleaned until late afternoon (hence the late check in?) but in contrast we were given multiple 'bracelets' by enthusiastic pool staff when sitting poolside, (why the room key wasn't good enough for orders I don't know).
I wouldn't chose this hotel again but if you like trance and dance and a businesslike atmosphere this may suit you.",3,2015,09,13
36,Beautiful sea views,"The hotel staff was very helpful and let us check in early. The lobby is spacious and inviting. We stays on the executive level and the breakfast in the club 
lounge was nice with beautiful views of the sea. Our room was spacious and had a lovely bathroom.",5,2015,09,13
36,Great service and excellent views/location,We had a high level room with excellent views of the city and water.  Service was excellent and the executive lounge was a real treat with awesome views and food/drink The pool was fantastic with amazing service.  If you get to pool early you can get lounge chairs with out having to pay to reserve.  Drinks are well made.  ,5,2015,09,13
36,Nice waterfront hotel,"Good location for the beach, very short walk, with great views.  There is a very good sized shopping mall across the street with lots of outdoor reasturant options.  There are several tour options from the hotel.  We took a taxi down to the main square, and met our tour at that location.",4,2015,09,12
36,Rather disappointed. Service does not match reputation,"Rather disappointed, considering the brand and reputation of this hotel.

We arrived at about 12.30-13.00. Indeed, we were a large group, but reservations were made in advance, they knew we were coming and could have organized the check-in a little better. We had to wait for another approx. 50 minutes in the lobby, only to find out that our rooms were not ready. Still, the receptionist charged us 50 EUR per night, and advised us to come back at 4 PM. She explained that this delay was caused by other guests who had checked out late, and that the hotel could only guarantee check-in at 4 o'clock, not earlier. I think it is really rude to treat your guests like this. Most of us had traveled since early morning, changed flights, waited in the airport, then waited in the hotel lobby, then waited some more hours for the room. It was the first time I had such unpleasant experience.
Finally, we got the rooms. The room card I received was not working; while trying to activate the button for floor 23, the elevator got stuck between floors. I had to come back to reception to get another card. 
Internet connection was free but really slow, so I had to use my internet stick instead. I didn't find slippers or dressing gown in the room, I had to specifically ask for these items. The towels in the bathroom were still wet.

Nice room, interesting view, good quality of sleep. Rather expensive automatic minibar, with a very very small area to deposit your personal items. Wish I had some complimentary bottle of water or some fruits, instead of the tea and coffee bags.

Good impression of the restaurant; good breakfast, nice and friendly personnel, they had somehow softened my first day experience.

The big shopping mall opposite to the hotel is probably the best argument in favor of booking a room here; otherwise you can find better service in better locations.",3,2015,09,12
36,Great for business and leisure!,"We went to take part of a corporate program for few days at the Hilton Barcelona Diagonal Mar. You could see that the team was highly trained and of very good standards. The team made sure you had nothing to worry about, everybody was very helpful. The hotel combines business with leisure with style with their latest addition the Puro Beach bar, a must do. This gave our conference another dimension on top of the fact that the coffee breaks and special attention were already very high. Will definitely come back and book again.",5,2015,09,12
36,Gotta love the ocean view,"Sure, the hotel is not located in the turistic area of Barcelona but it only takes a short trip on the public bus or the subway to make it there.  I especifically requested a hotel close to the beach despite it was my first time in Barcelona.  My only negative comment is that they dont offer free wifi while most 3 star-hotels do so it was a bummer having to pay for internet.  Besides that, I enjoyed my stay, comfortable room, nice view, close to the beach, great bar and breakfast menu.",5,2015,09,11
36,"""5 star hotel but smells of dead fish""","Above opinion has been expressed by my son in his essay about his holiday in Barcelona. To be fair describes hotel very well.
Starting from the positive points:
- Location is very practical (next to quiet beach and good shopping centre) 
- Reception staff, security guards, restaurant stuff are very warm and dedicated
- Price were very reasonable
- Guest can join PURO Beach Parties (if you love vanity fairs)

But  there are coupe major problems which, i believe are related to poor management of the hotel 
- Outside hotel rooms, on corridors there is notorious smell of dead fish (i guess from not well ventilated moisture)
- Cleaning in room is more than un acceptable, I am not much detailed person but i guess some of dust remembers time when Paris Hilton was a virgin. 
- Purobeach pool needs deeper cleaning, cigarettes buds, but again staff where very nice and helpfull
- Quality of vegetables in breakfast restaurant where very low, but gain staff and people who served us compensated us lack of good quality vegetables 

IMHO management is not doing their work well as they have amazing staff (maybe despite the cleaning team;) amazing location and quite spectacular building and they could that place into european leading Vanity Fair :) But instead they have 5 star hotel with dead fish.

However I most likely will comeback due attractive price I have been given!",3,2015,09,11
36,One of the best pool.,"Very nice hotel! Good location, about 20mins walk to the metro station. 
Right opposite to the hotel, there is a very big shopping mall for tourists to have a quick shopping. 
The executive room is very nice and big. Excellent services in the hotel too!",5,2015,09,11
36,Beautiful views,The room was very nice and spacious. Pool area was nice but very crowded and not family-friendly. Beautiful bathroom in our room. Very comfortable bed. No outlets near bed (disappointing). Views of the ocean from the window were amazing.,4,2015,09,09
36,Excellent hotel,"Just returned from this Hotel and loved every second there. The Hotel is immaculate, the rooms are spacious, clean and airy. I was located on the 21st floor which had superb view of the sea ( room 2114).
Staff were excellent at the Hotel, upon our arrival the room was not ready so they invited us to use the Executive Longue on the 15th Floor. This lounge offered nice refreshments early afternoon and good food and alcoholic drinks between 6pm and 8pm.
The swimming pool was lively and did have a party at night, luckily on the 21st floor I didn’t hear anything but felt sorry for people on the lower floors.
Breakfast was superb offering really good quality food.
I would recommend this Hotel, I will defiantly re visit this place. One hint for you, this hotel can be very busy, give plenty of time to check out in case you are delayed for your next port of call.
",4,2015,09,09
36,Modern hotel beside the sea,"Check in was efficient and friendly as normal with Hilton hotels.  We were in a sea-facing room on the top floor - the views were great with ships coming backwards and forwards and planes coming past for the airport.

Everything was clean and comfortable - we slept well.

The executive lounge had a good range of snacks and drinks in the evening.  Although it had a terrace - this was not restful because of the noise of the pool disco bellowing up from below.  Soundproofing inside the lounge and elsewhere in the hotel worked well though.

The breakfast in the main restaurant was excellent - the best we had in Spain.",5,2015,09,08
36,3 days in Barcelona,"No internet in rooms unless you want to pay extra for what is standard now days, it was available in public areas but very unreliable to say the least..housekeeping was average did not replenish coffee supplies or clean properly and knocked on our door,at 8.30 am!!! Staff were mostly unwelcoming when entering or leaving the premises, we obviously looked liked tourists which I presume are not their target market.Pool area was nice but severely advertised by Moët ..and you will pay for it. They appear to cater mainly for the business traveller, if you are not familiar with Barcelona it is a distance from the city. On the upside we had great service from one of the staff at reception on places of interest and the room was a good size.",3,2015,09,06
36,Not recommended for tourists to Barcelona,"Its a large Hilton hotel and like a lot of them in Europe, it caters to either conferences/large groups or one time guests and therefore does not cater to one time tourists - hence my recommendation is poor (at best!)

The good: good water views, nice pool, typical Hilton service and likely excellent using HHonors points instead of paying to stay. Warm Spanish service be several of the staff we interacted with - though tempered with Hilton's demands of cold impersonal process to reduce costs throughout. Good mall across the street with shopping and food options (Casa Carmen was good but our expectations were tempered when we saw Chicken Tikka Masala and thai curry options on the menu.) Free parking on the street overnight if you are lucky to find it (else 36 Euros a night in a deserted parking lot at the hotel.) 20 minutes drive to the airport without traffic (taxis available easily though they also have a Sixt car rental on premises.) Taxis in Barcelona are cheap at 1 Euro a kilometer, approximately. A small surcharge for night or airport fares. (We paid 36 Euros in midday traffic, ex-Barcelona Terminal 1 - which tends to be more than the fare ex-Terminal 2.)

The bad: check in was manned by warm staff who were not equipped to take care of the needs of the guests (we checked in early, were told the room would be ready in 30 minutes - after housekeeping said so - yet the room took 90+ minutes to be ready.) 15th floor executive lounge was bareboned with stale croissants at 1pm and manned by a (warm) gentleman who reminded us that he was new to his job and therefore could not be of assistance to recommend a restaurant in the area for lunch. 23rd floor room had VERY spotty internet service. Executive rooms were ABSOLUTELY without character. I would, for the future, not pay for ocean view rooms (three buildings in front of us, obstructing views till the 15-17th floor and the bare ocean after that which was east facing meant that there was strong sun early in the morning.) Very poor water pressure in our bathroom shower (upon checkout we were given the reason of water conservation... though I fault the plumbing more than anything else.) When we came back into the hotel at 3am, after a late night out - the lobby was not manned, it was mostly dark with the lights mostly switched off (except by the front desk) giving less than a safe feel (though this was a personal feeling and likely a cos cutting measure and by no means did we otherwise feel unsafe!). Got woken up one evening by housekeeping coming in with fresh towels (we had not asked for these.) All in all not recommended because of the spotty service and the bland atmosphere. If this was my first or a special time in Barcelona, I would not want to stay here at ALL. 

All in all, I am happy to have been able to use my Hilton points towards part of the stay. I would not have been happy to have spent money towards this hotel. There are hundreds of options better equipped to take care of first time tourists. Should I land up in BCN again, I will not be staying here.

A few pointers: we had no problems of wait times for elevators from the 23rd floor. I am not sure I would pay a premium for an ocean view room (what a dull view it was!).

We loved Mercat Princesa (http://www.mercatprincesa.com/) for a meal and excellent sangria; it was a short walk from the Picasso museum. Mercat Boqueria (http://www.boqueria.info/index.php?lang=en) was wonderful to pick up some good cured meats and get a feel of the local market (find a stall that allows you to taste the product and you will enjoy the experience even more.)",2,2015,09,06
36,"Very nice hotel, had a problem at first, changed rooms in minutes","I had a room assigned but unfortunately the sink was broken and water was on the ground. As this can happen to everyone and every hotel, no matter what class, I reported it to the staff at the reception.

They issued me a new room immediately.",4,2015,09,06
36,Nice location,"I stayed there for one week with my family.  The suite was spacious.  I loved the area very nice location.  Walking distance to the beach.  The mall just under your hotel.  Outdoor Play area for kids at the mall entrance. Rambla del Poblenou, nice street with coffee shops and restaurants is 20 minutes walking from the hotel.   However, catalonya shopping area the famous street is almost 15 minutes by car.  ",5,2015,09,04
36,Rough start but excellent service and stay,"I gave this hotel a 5 out of 5 simply because our experience was that they really do care about their guests. Let me start by saying that we stayed a night after our cruise. All we wanted was a stress-free comfortable night before our long flight back home. When we checked in, the lady was rude to my wife. We asked to speak with the manager, and the manager promptly came out and discussed our problem. She was very professional and understanding. Next, we got into our room and even though it was a non-smoking room, it smelled like someone smoked like 2 packs in the room. We called the front desk. Within the hour, they moved us to a different room. Although the start was difficult, the Hilton staff did a great job of trying to rectify the situation. They really do care about their guests.",5,2015,09,03
36,Had to leave,"As a Hilton Honours member I used points to stay at Diagonal Mar. The room we got was old & had a musty smell. The room was carpeted. We asked to upgrade to another room but being summer the hotel was full. After spending a night there we decided to leave & forfeited our remaining nights. 

I didn't get an opportunity to use the pool but it did look nice (& why we choose staying at this Hilton rather than the other), & there is a gym although relatively small with a tv which was not working on the day I was in there. 

Having 2 Hiltons in Barcelona one named Diagonal Mar & the other ON the Diagonal is very confusing for taxi drivers & colleagues alike. Should look into rectifying this.",2,2015,09,02
36,excellent hotel good location,"Great room, very friendly staff and excellent breakfast . great location opposite big shopping complex with lots of restaurants. on the hop on hop off bus route with a stop just outside the front door . highly recommended .",5,2015,09,01
36,High time at Hilton,"we stayed here pre cruise and were completely satisfied in every respect.
Excellent executive room on floor 14 ,we were offered choice of sea or city view.
Very comfortable room with coffee making facilities.

Great buffet breakfast.

Easy access to the city and eventually to the cruise terminal.",5,2015,09,01
36,Highly Disappointing,"Hi all, this is the first review I've written. As a frequent traveler I often stay at Hilton Hotels, and I am a Silver member. Though it is a beautiful hotel, I immediately had problems with my bathroom sink clogging. I phoned down to reception, and the receptionist only spoke to me in Spanish even though I didn't understand. Then, she sounded very annoyed saying someone would be up 'soon' to fix it. It still wasn't fixed 2 days later, and only when I personally went to reception to ask again on my way out for the day. I understand that it can be annoying when foreigners don't speak the language, but I genuinely try my best wherever I go and am always very polite. I also had issues with housekeeping, on my last night I had to phone them 4 times in order to get toilet paper! My complimentary coffee and tea was not refilled either day, and and then was replaced but the milk wasn't. With the exception of most of the front desk staff, and the lovely bartender and porters, I was very disappointed with my stay. I will not be going back. It was the little things, but what bothered me most is how I was treated when I politely asked for things to be remedied (i.e., bathroom sink) It is not easy to be a solo traveler and I would have liked to have been treated with more respect, especially since I was paying for the 'Hilton' service.",2,2015,09,01
36,Re-visit to Diagonal Mar,"After a bit of a disappointed stay in the summer of 2014 - my family and I chose to re-visit Hilton Diagonal Mar in Barcelona in hope for the better.....

.... and let me begin with the overall fact that we had a fantastic time on our re-visit to the hotel. We had the impression and feeling that from the front staff to the breakfast staff – the service level were substantially improved from our last visit. Whether it was because of our history or just every day at the hotel is obviously not something for me to judge – but compared to last year it were definitely improved. 

Upon arrival we were upgraded to an Executive suite – fantastic – with a view to die for. One of the best things, however, were the possibility of visiting the Executive lounge, even though it was relatively crowded around 6 PM as the dinner snacks were served, it was really nice with a huge variety of drinks (and snacks obviously). Additionally, the new Puro Beach was really good – we truly enjoyed the area with sunbeds and water/fruit. I don’t know whether we got a splendid deal or whether this is how people normally are served at the pool – but it was outstanding. From other reviews I can off course come into doubt on these matters. The only thing I can put a finger on – were the volume of the music – which were to the loud side (unless you off course are into loud techno music) 

The breakfast were also good – the kids only missed the bags with treats that they received last year and off course we missed the omelet station. But again this is definitely not something that will affect our overall imprecision of the breakfast and I must admit that I at least found the selection and variety of a really high standard. 

So – all in all – a really good experience and stay at Hilton Diagonal mar – and already now my kids are complaining to go back again. So this is by far the last time we have visited your hotel – and I do hope to return in the near future again.",5,2015,09,01
36,Great Hilton with above average facilities,"One of the best Hilton's I have stayed in (and I've been to lots!)

Exec floor rooms are bigger than average with excellent bathrooms and very large comfortable beds.

The exec lounge has a great balcony with fantastic views where you can breakfast etc.

The pool area is a Purobeach with free beds (at the back) and more comfortable beds and cabana which at peak times have to be booked and paid for. It's a pool party atmosphere with excellent staff and great seating & dining options. Drinks and food is expensive here though!

Small gym (needs to be bigger for the size of hotel) but has most of the equipment a typical traveller needs, with very small changing room and sauna.

Main check-in area is too small and understaffed for the size of hotel with long queues at peak times.

Great shopping mall across the road and plenty of eating options around the hotel. 2 mins walk to the beach and 30 mins to central Barcelona along the seafront. Metro stop at the shopping mall makes access to all areas of Barcelona very easy, with great value for money tickets.",4,2015,08,31
36,"Overall, a nice hotel","This was my second stay here.  Overall, this is a pretty nice hotel.

What I liked
1. Excellent executive lounge for elite members, great breakfast and evening snacks
2.they accommodated my early arrival
3. I got upgraded to a waterfront room
4. The breakfast in the restaurant is pretty elaborate
5. The gym is adequate
6. the hotel across the street from a shopping mall; there are restaurants and shops within a 2 minute walking distance
7. every employee I interacted with was pleasant and smiling

What I did not like
1. I was first put into room 1501.  This room was right next to the service room, and there was a door slamming every few minutes
2.  I was then put in a room that smelled like an ash tray.  I don't blame the hotel for having a guest that smoked in a non smoking room, but do blame them for making the room available
3. There was no sense of urgency with the hotel staff.  Multiple times, I was told ""my colleague will call you right back"", and would never hear back
4. There are no clocks in the room
5.  This is the only Hilton I have every stayed in that does not provide complimentary bottles of water to its elite members",4,2015,08,30
36,Still a very good choice but needs to review some of its operations.,"I wrote a positive review of this hotel back in 2007 when the property was new and I've been back on a number of occasions since. For me, the location of the hotel is still a big positive; you're situated in a quiet, relaxed neighbourhood. Taxis are cheap and the efficient metro is just a few minutes walk away so the centre of Barcelona is easily accessible

Opt for an Executive Room if you can as the benefits far out-way standard rooms - higher floor rooms have fantastic views and you get access to the Executive Lounge. In 2007 I commented on the Lounge being busy and slightly chaotic. It's still busy on occasions but the staff work hard and are to be applauded for their efforts. My only other observation is that the front desk isn't always manned so the option of checking out via the Lounge isn't always available as we ourselves found out.

There are two things that seem to crop up as negatives on a number of other TA reviews - Internet access and the Pool area and I too, feel inclined, to comment on both.

Internet: If you plan to video stream or play computer games 24/7 then most people would expect to pay a premium for this. But being asked to pay for basic, room-based Wi-Fi which on my experience was patchy at best (although free to Gold HHonors member and above it seems) is really not on. Even the smallest hotels now offer free Wi-Fi to everyone and everywhere.

Pool: This seems to be the one thing that had divided recent reviews. The Puro Beach Experience probably looked good on paper as a 'concept'  but at the end of the day it's just about trying to improve upon what is otherwise a standard, but decent-sized pool and terrace.

Trying to get a pool-side bed is, as many reviewers have commented on, a pretty farcical experience until you know how to play the game. Allowing guests to pre-book beds the following day and then simply not turning up, leaves beds completely unoccupied. I watched on more than one occasion families with young children being offered the only beds available at the back of the pool area.  These came with little or no shade and meant that parents were well away from the pool where their children would most want to be. Meanwhile, most if not all the Cabanas remained empty. At 500 Euros for the day, the temptation of a few drinks, lunch and a 30 minute massage is going to appeal to a very small and selective audience. It's hard not to see Puro Beach wanting to make as much money as possible rather than providing a good customer service to ALL guests. 

I personally don't have a problem with chill-out music but starting at 10 in the morning it can get very repetitive, very quickly and there seems to be an unnecessary tendency to boost the decibel levels late in the afternoon. Then at weekends the sense is not of a relaxing pool for hotels guests but as a late afternoon club venue for non-guests who pay for the privilege of a pool-side location. I watched in disbelief as a couple with a young child made their way to the children's pool (at about 6pm on a Saturday) only to find a half a dozen young and increasingly vocal adults dancing about in the water, drinks in hand. Sadly, the family had no choice but to turn tail and return to their room with a very disappointed child in tow who hadn't been able to swim. Perhaps pool hours should be better advertised?

Whereas on past visits the pool area was very much aimed at the hotel's mixed clientele of couples (young and old) and families, it looks as if the new 'raisin d'être' was about making as much money as possible and if that meant isolating some of the hotel's guests then so be it. As someone with a fair understanding of customer service then this seems to be a somewhat crazy approach. I wonder how many potential guests will read these reviews and think twice about booking, or maybe not come back in the future?

Now here's a thing, the Hotel Princess just across the road is currently rated a good 50 places higher on Trip Advisor than the Hilton, and for a hotel which I guess has many of the same facilities at similar if not lower prices. They must be doing something right; Hilton Management take note.",4,2015,08,29
36,An relaxing oasis in Barcelona,"We stayed here with our three kids and in-laws for 3 nights. I used air miles to stay in executive rooms and it was definitely worth it as the executive lounge was a great venue in the evening for a few drinks and some food. It was also useful for my kids to chill for an hour out of the heat, using the wifi or the computers in the lounge. Whilst busy in the evenings we could still get a table for 6 of us and the outdoor terrace provides great views of the sea, Barcelona and the hills. Breakfast was great too although there was more choice in the 1st floor restaurant.

We found the location ideal - it was quieter than the centre and had a large shopping centre across the road which had some nice places to eat. Transport links into the centre by tram and metro are excellent and it was nice to ""withdraw"" to the hotel at the end of a busy day sightseeing.

The Purobeach concept was not such a negative for us. We could head down to the pool for a dip whenever, there is a smaller pool which worked for our toddler. You can book loungers near the pool for EUR25 but otherwise the staff direct you based on how busy it is. Sometimes we could sit near the pool, other times we were further away but it was hardly an inconvenience. Having a pool to cool down in was the key for us.

On the negative side, having only 4 elevators for a hotel of this size is a bad design flaw. Whilst there were some delays, we did not wait for as long as some other reviewers.

Similarly, the gym is too small and poorly equipped - they need to find a bigger room spend some money on better equipment.

However, overall I would recommend this hotel if you are visiting Barcelona and want a location that allows you to withdraw from the busy centre.

36,hilton by the sea,"stayed at the hilton diagonal in july, big size lounge area with reception good quick booking in. good size bedroom very good  daily maid service. food as good as anywhere with the best service we had in a long time. however lifts to higher floors very slow, we paid extra for exutive lounge facilities waste of time closes at 10p.m. and only basics in there, eventually started to have breakfast in the main dining hall was far better. on the whole enjoyed the hotel opposite the main shopping centre with bars and restraunts and a stroll down to the fabulous beach, metro and tourist bus close by, would use again perfect location.",4,2015,08,28
36,Great Pool and Views from Higher Rooms,"I had a beautiful room, the hotel itself offered a decent breakfast and the bar staff were friendly. Some of the reception staff struggled a little with English but none the less it was an enjoyable trip. The hotel is located opposite the Diagonal Mar Shopping Complex which has a selection of good restaurants and shops. I'd stay again.",5,2015,08,27
36,Disappointing,"I had a pleasant stay in Barcelona but this hotel was without doubt, the lowlight.

All the information says 'check out at 12:00 and check in at 14:00' yet, my room was not ready until 16:00 with no reason given.

Reception staff surly at best and felt like they were doing you a favour by having to interact with you.

Wi Fi: 'It is Hilton policy to have free wifi in public areas' is what the hotel has responded to other reviews regarding this matter.  Fine, keep your heads in the sand and continue to be outlier and dinosaur.  Almost all hotels in the universe offer a free wifi service in all areas including rooms.  To respond in such a manner is arrogant and out of touch with current trends.  

There are 4 (yes 4) pcs in reception for guest use.  Obviously, in peak summer time, with 3 million guests staying at the hotel, 4 was more than enough to go round...

I have stayed at small, family run hotels with more pcs...  And this is a 'premium' global hotel brand???

Room was tatty and probably last saw a refurb 3 thousand years ago.  Bathroom had evidence of flooding/damp that had come from shower (due to poor door closing mechanism) but, hotel clearly feels it is ok to leave like that.  Toiletries and toilet paper felt like they were being rationed.  Just what I expect from a global brand.

Mini bar.  Don't breathe anywhere near it or you will be charged.  To be fair, this is well labelled on the fridge but, still.  There is nothing like being treated like an idiot, eh?  Walk 100m across the road to Alcampo and buy your water/crisps at 'normal' prices and save yourself the hassle and expense.

Pool.  Nothing short of a farce.  This is not a pool for hotel guests - although you are welcome to sit in the corner of the complex away from the pool if you like- unless you pay whatever it is they charge for a sunbed.  It is basically a Vegas pool party where 20 something wannabees and older 'should know betters', pay well over the odds to try to look cool on an overpriced sun lounger listening to 20 year old house beats on maximum volume.  Lots of flesh on show with evidence of people having drunk a little too much.  The pool itself was dirty and had evidence of rubbish in it.  I can guess what might go on here...

Breakfast was fine with usual range of fare on offer (obviously reassuringly overpriced).  Avoid anything after 9am as it is a fist fight to be seated.

Lifts.  There are 4 to serve a big hotel with lots of people.  Unacceptable wait times all the time.  When one finally arrives, it is either full - so you have to wait some more - or, it is full of drunk people leaving the pool on the 2nd floor.

Location is 'ok'.  Beach is a 5 minute walk and the metro stop about a 10 minute walk with good access to town.  Shopping mall across the road has all the usual stuff one would expect although restaurants there have a fast food feel to them.  I would recommend Lizarran for a 'menu del dia' option and the Italian on the main square opposite the hotel (I think it was called Tagliatelle).

Choose a room facing the city rather than the pool and you will have little to no noise from the road or the pool.

In short, I was disappointed with this hotel.  The negatives far outweigh the positives.  There is no personal touch and nothing to make you feel like a special guest.  No contact made prior to arrival, no offer of additional services (beach/pool/trips), no explanation of services available on (late) check in.  It was all just very production line.  I suspect a lot of their trade comes from the UK/North American/Asia market where the brand is well known.  I think they are also trying to make hay with the pool thing.

There are far better options available in Barcelona and I would suggest you look elsewhere.  I shan't be returning.",2,2015,08,27
36,"Great Pool - Partial Sea View Rooms ""just okay""","You want to spend your time at the pool or the beach? This is a GREAT option. The pool is clean, temperate, and great for people watching. Drinks are pricey and not boozy enough - but you don't have any other options if you stay there. Room is totally standard. Bed was comfortable and the water pressure in the shower was excellent. Hotel lobby feels like a mall versus a nice hotel. The elevators took FOREVER, as though there was only one working. Location wise - great for the beach. If you plan on spending more of your time in the center of town you may want to consider other, more convenient, options. And the paid WIFI in the room is a big disappointment.

36,Average Hilton,"Average Hilton close to a mall, but in an otherwise boring location.

Arrived a little bit before normal check-in time (as late as 4 PM!) and was told my room was not ready yet. As a HHonors Diamond I found this to be a bit odd. 

Average Hilton room, yet well maintained.

Expensive drinks, extremely expensive minibar. Only two bottles of free water per stay.

Will not return as I find both the city of Barcelona and the hotel to be extremely boring.",3,2015,08,25
36,Missed the Mark,"I am a Hilton Diamond member and have been to many properties in several countries.  This property disappointed. First, there were not enough front desk staff. Every time you needed something (more on that in a minute), there was a 10-20 minute wait in line. You sometimes could see additional staff performing ancillary duties, but apparently they could not be reassigned to clear the line. As someone else noted, the electronic keys became unreadable every 2-3 days for no reason and you needed to key a replacement at the front desk. Second, the Purobeach Dayclub was better suited for Las Vegas. A good party for the young, but not really consistent with an otherwise straight-laced hotel. Third, the Executive Level Lounge had nice offerings and better staffing. This spot was probably the best feature at the property. Fourth, the rooms were above average, but nothing special. Housekeeping did a fairly good job of stocking/refreshing most items. Last, the elevators took forever! If you needed to be somewhere, you had to plan for that lift delay. All in all, not terrible, but not paradise either.",3,2015,08,25
36,Not for families / when a holiday is anything but relaxing!  (Read on...),"Having stayed at this hotel on a number of occasions (for one to two weeks usually), and having previously had a positive experience, this trip was a huge disappointment.  The addition of the ""Purobeach Experience"" seems to be alienating this hotel's traditional customer base.

Having avoided the charge for sunbeds (25 Euros or 500 Euros for a Balinese Bed per day), and having declined the offer of the third class facilities which have been allocated to hotel guests, we found ourselves on sunbeds at the poolside.  We then had to endure constant House music at 85db, often turbocharged by the arrival of the House DJ playing offensive music, and the prospect of anything but a peaceful holiday.  We were unwittingly witness to the daytime nightclub which is Purobeach.  The constant flow of Champagne (well usually Cava) to the day-trip, middle-aged, twenty-somethings who descended upon the hotel for the purpose of becoming self-appointed celebrities, became very wearing.  Mid-afternoon and the children are ejected from the kiddies pool to enable the 'glitterati' to dance without getting wet above their knees.  The children who do attempt to access the 'grown up's"" swimming pool, negotiating their way through the glasses which were left on the deck, are then moved on again to allow the revellers to be photographed star-jumping into the water - ""Look at me!"".

The Purobeach Experience reached an all-time low when I reported my concerns to the Duty Manager.  ""Were they actually having sex?"" was a question I had never expected to be asked by a professional hotelier.  This was the response to the concern I raised when my daughter asked why a woman was gyrating, in her loose-fitting bikini, atop a man on the sunbed next to her!!

The duty photographer sees it all and posts most of it on the Purobeach website.  From the gong-striking dwarf to the hired-in guests, it all sounds like a nightmare now.  As I suggested, I must be getting too old; I didn't recognise any of the several thousand erstwhile celebrities who were photographed in front of the pro' sponsored banner.   

As the Duty Manager suggested, Purobeach is a profitable venture for the hotel, but as I suggested, I think this may be a short-lived success.  The talk between people in the 15th Floor Executive Lounge, and elsewhere, is all about mutiny and displeasure.  I think the hotel guests will vote with their feet, but at least the blancmange beat of the music, which was clearly audible above the fifteenth floor, stops at 10pm!

What a shame, because this hotel used to be great.  Can it really afford to lose the revenue from hotel guests to please the day-trip clubbers?",1,2015,08,23
36,The pool experience lets the Hilton brand down,"We booked this hotel as have kids and the pool looked fabulous on the website. Unfortunately what a disappointment....we felt cheated at paying 25 euros EACH to book a pool area sunbed. If not you were put at the back away from a pool view and no visibility of seeing your kids in there at all. The staff we rude and were patronizing as one said we could have the cabana for 500 euros then! An absolute joke. On the plus side the beach 5 mins walk away is beautiful, clean and friendly  beach bar staff!
We did however meet a great couple in the hotel and was asked to join them in the pool restaurant. ANOTHER disappointment as the seafood kings prawns were raw! We did however get 70 euros off the bill (cost of prawns x2).. Drinks also expensive.

We stayed in the Exec Room and it was large but tired. The flooring was falling apart at the entrance door, the bathroom ceiling was not fixed properly. And we were left with lots of curtain hooks on the window sill (never removed through out our stay.
the room keys cards every other day stopped working so had to queue for 30mins each time at reception!
The Exec club was a nice experince though. The viewing area is clean but when busy there are not enough chairs for everyone.
The breakfast dining room staff were the best. Service was impeccable and staff attentive. Don't opt the breakfast in the exec lounge go to level 1 and have more choice there.
Overall a totally expensive disappointment.
Positive note: There is a kids play area across the road and great choice of restaurants.",2,2015,08,21
36,Hilton quality and great location ,"Took a short break here and had a great time. I use Hiltons for business travelling a lot and have grown used to the nice touched, general high standard and well trained staff. This hotel lives up to this standard very well. The Puro pool rooftop area along with bar and sun lounger area is lovely. Great views across the City and very friendly and helpful service. Beware the sky high drinks prices though and extra costs such as booking poolside sun beds. These are avoidable if you choose not to indulge as there are plenty of free beds for guests a little further from poolside. We loved relaxing up here in the lovely Catalan sunshine.
Breakfasts are brilliant, huge choice and very high quality. Great restaurant welcome and efficient table service. Room was fine, clean, comfortable and exactly Hilton standard. Got stung for the in room Pringles (my fault, should have known better) but no real issue. Good nights sleep and effective air con. Free baggage storage handy to allow extra sight seeing before flight home. 
Just across the road from the Diagonal Mar indoor shopping centre and food plaza. Heaps of choice inside and out plus shop till you drop if you want!
5 mins to the beach. 10 to the nearest Metro into the city centre (Meresme Forum) on Line L4 or Tram just the other side of the shopping centre. 
Top tip- get a Barcelona Card (2,3 or 5 Days). This pass gives you unlimited public transport on the excellent networks of Metro lines, trams and bus services. PLUS you get free or reduced entry to a large range of top attractions, museums and activities. For example, Las Ramblas is easily reached on several Metro lines and you are never far from a station. 
Loved it here!",4,2015,08,20
36,Normal hotel,"Hotel is good , location , rooms but they have some big issues 1- pool which belongs to bar and i cant go swim i need pay for it !!!!! Its not cheap hotel and it is not normal

So its not normal sell vouchers and after tell me i can order maximum 35€ when starter 20€ and mains very expensive
 Im not happy to stay there.",3,2015,08,19
36,Consistently Hilton!,"I have to admit to liking the Hilton Chain, I've stayed in a few round the world and whilst they are not the most luxurious chain, they do offer a consistent standard of helpful staff, quality spacious enough rooms, good food and good housekeeping standards. The Hilton in Barcelona is no different.

We had a great time and the location was perfect for us. Two min walk to the beach, shopping centre opposite which had a food court with a variety of fast food and more formal restaurants (nothing too posh, but great if you or the kids just wanted a quick snack or informal meal away from the hotel). The metro in Barcelona was great value and there is a station just behind the shopping centre so the slightly out of the town centre location became a plus rather than a minus for us as we had an out of town location with quick links. 

We went for the breakfast included option and have to say it was well worth it, great variety of food (although my son never did get used to chicken sausages) that set us up for the day.

The only negative I found was the Puro Beach pool area. We arrived on the Friday afternoon and had a room on the 16th floor (so quite high) and all we could hear was the bass line of the music from the outdoor pool area on the second floor, even over the TV, so no chance of an afternoon seista!. The volume decreased each night bang on 9 o'clock and then stopped an hour or so later. Things did get better on the Monday as it seems during the week the pool has a more spa like feel to it with quiet chill music, which we couldn't hear 16 floors up. In fact we spent a lovely day on the Tuesday having a lovely massage and great food by the pool for the day. I guess they have to cater for everyone, but it was very loud at the weekend. My tip would be to ask for a city view room rather than the sea view we had as then your the right side away from the weekend noise. I'm sure if we had asked we could of been moved but we had unpacked and settle in by the time it really got under my skin!

Overall a good experience, just a shame I'm getting too old for the loud music!

... oh and free WiFi in public areas, like the lobby and pool, but you have to pay to use it in your room.",4,2015,08,17
36,Still love this hotel,"We have spent one week of our holiday in August in Hilton Diagonal Mar since 2005. This year we were exited to explore the PURO Beach, and I have to admit we really enjoyed it (except the music with the base drumming constantly!) Lovely, cool and very friendly team members, both the new ones with Angel and Sergie among others, and our old friends Daniella, Bruno and Tiziano looking after us all day. Make your reservations for sunbeds and umbrellas to be sure to have a place in the sun.

We had our lunch in the shade at the PURO beach restaurant, and even though they were busy every day, Matheo provided excellent service with a smile. Last thing before we left after 8 days, was to enjoy our coffees at the beach planning next August vacation.

Giovanni, the fantastic italian guy, has returned to the restaurant/F&B, and looked after the extensive breakfast buffet and were really hands on.

The executive lounge were quite crowded and the staff were busy filling up the food and drinks. Cecilia is a supervisor of the lounge and very eager to please guests meeting every request with a smile, Sabrina assisted us with restaurant bookings and confirmations in the evening. After dinner in city centre, we enjoyed a nightcap with   quiet glass of wine in the bar chatting with David ""the bar man"" and his nice colleagues David and Daniel
Really glad we had the chance to tell the General Manager how much we appreciate the fantastic service provided by his lovely team members. We will return.",5,2015,08,16
36,"always my choice while in Barcelona, have been there more than 50 times in 7 years.","This hotel is fantastically located if you want to shop, business, tourism or if you want to relax and workout.
They have different options of restaurant, which are great, breakfast is amazing on the first floor. The pool is great and the bars are amazing! :) 
The staff is always incredible, always looking to visit Barcelona for business or vacation at any time of the year.",5,2015,08,16
36,Crazy sunbed booking system,"So this hotel's pool area is run by Purobeach so it's very hip and trendy, cool tunes and well organised by cool people. Here's the problem though, you have to reserve sunbeds even if you're a hotel resident. They don't tell you this at any time during your stay and it's not in the hotel info in your room. Sunbeds are reserved days in advance, often by people who aren't staying at the hotel. If you haven't got a reservation you are directed to sunbeds at the very back of the pool area, no where near the pool or 'looked after'. Half of the 'reserved' sunbeds remain empty all day, it's a crazy system. We were lucky enough to get a sunbed but 9 out of 10 guests who came down to the pool area were turned away. None were happy understandably so. All complained but to no avail. Hilton you really need to review this. We would have given 5 stars were it not for this crazy sunbed system.",3,2015,08,16
36,Hotel is overrated and too expensive. Lots of improvement possible. Average at the most.,"Well..... As Hilton Honors Diamond member I have seen many Hilton Hotels all over the world. We have to admit that this one is a very special one. Let us start with the positive elements of this review. The rooms in the hotel are spacious (we were staying at the top floor / 23), the rooms are clean, the breakfast is OK with a variety of choice and friendly staff. Overall our stay was OK. However,..........

1. Since May 2015 the hotel has introduced the Puro Beach concept at its only hotel pool. For hotel guests this has very negative consequences, because you have to pay for sunbeds close to the pool, no beds are reserved for hotel guests and you have to make your own paid reservation (without people at the front desk telling). Sometimes reserving is completely impossible, because outside visitors have reserved all beds (especially during weekend Fri - Sun). There are some additional hotel sunbeds way back in a separate area where you feel like a second class guest (beds uncomfortable, in the shade and from a different class than the regular beds) 
2. Some reception / front desk staff are very unfriendly and not cooperative, others are fine. 
3. Prices for mini bar and food and drinks at the hotel are outrageous, especially if you compare to prices in upscale restaurants in the city. EUR 5,50 for a small bottle of water in the minibar EUR7,50 for an average glass of white wine is simply too much or EUR 12 for a cocktail with very minor level of alcohol is another example. 
4. We believe the Puro beach concept is a nice concept, but not well executed within the set-up / logistics of this hotel, the result is many complaining people to staff at Puro Beach. The staff at Puro Beach are trying to solve the problems but still a lot of people are unhappy. 
5. Executive lounge is OK, but extremely busy during 6pm and 8pm when alcohol is for free and there are small snacks.
6. Elevators are slow and stop a lot, sometimes it takes you 10-15mins to get from ground floor to top floor 
7. Be aware that during the weekends there is an (outdoor) club just behind the hotel with extremely loud house-music until 4am in the morning. Even at the top floors you hear it. 

Conclusion: very average hotel, overrated, too expensive and not an option if we return to Barcelona. Puro beach can be great, but they need to figure out how to accommodate the hotel guests during peak periods (weekend/summer).",2,2015,08,16
36,Great Beach location,"We stayed here 3 nights at the start of our trip around Spain. The property is wonderful and in a great location away from the very busy city center, yet easy to get anywhere. The beach is about 2 blocks away, and a large modern shopping center is across the street with access to the subway and street rail systems.  Upon check-in we were met with very friendly staff that upgraded us to the Executive Floor. We are HH Gold members and used points on all of our Hilton stays in Spain. We never fully expect to get to the Executive Floor while using points so it’s always a nice perk when we do.  The outside area of the rooftop executive lounge is fantastic!  Our room was very comfortable, clean and cool (there was a huge heat wave across Spain in July).  Every staff member we encountered was friendly, helpful and spoke English very well. Our room was not quite ready when we arrived in the morning from Miami, so we stored our bags, went to the concierge desk and bought the Hop-on-Hop off bus tickets and we were off. The bus picks up right down the block.  I would pick this location over the other Hilton properties in Barcelona. We returned to Barcelona after 3 weeks around Spain and stayed at the Barcelona Hilton, regretfully.  Nothing bad to say about the other location, it’s just we enjoyed the amenities, location and overall experience at this property better.",5,2015,08,15
36,Not up to Hilton standard.,"Visited this hotel last summer. Wrote a review then. A lot have changed at this hotel, and it's not to the better. At check in we received a room at the 3. floor. Room ok, cleaning up front of arrival bad. Long black hair left in the tub, and leftovers from earlier guest in the frigde. Beeing a Hilton Honors gold member, no upgrade received. Given a welcome letter telling us that we could remove 2 complimentary bottles of water per stay from the frigde . Most disapointing was the pool area. It's now faller Puro Beach club. Pool area seems to be leased out to another company that needs to make a profit. Last year we could relax by the pool, this year we could do so if we made a reservation and paid 25 Euros a person. AS a guest of the hotel you could get a chair for free if available, we did the first day, in the shades ,  but the next 3 days ( friday, saturday and sunday) was fully booked.
This is a shame. Hilton selling out noe of the tings that was good at the hotel. As Hilton gold we received free breakfast, and the breakfast was ok.                                             The Beach is a 10 minute walk from the hotel. You can rent sunbeds for 8 Euros a day.  I.m sorry, but I can't recommend this hotel. Staying for 4 nights we didn't receive toiletries the last 2 days, and we had to call for more coffee to our room.                          This was my second and probably last stay at Hilton Diagonal Mar.",3,2015,08,15
36,Ridiculous Pool Policy,"The hotel was on a par with other Hilton hotels of the same rating BUT the availability of a sunbed/umbrella close to the pool, at any time of the day, came at a fee which, on principle, I was not prepared to pay. 50 Euro for a sunbed or a minimum spend of 500 Euro for a daybed I felt was a complete rip off.  The option was to be given a sunbed  without shade in an area further away from the pool where sunbeds were lined up and it was unpleasantly hot. This Beach Club idea may be great for the hotel to generate revenue by drawing in members of the public, but does not serve hotel guests well and  means that if we are to stay in this area of Barcelona again,  I would book another  hotel due to this policy.",2,2015,08,14
36,Beautiful Hotel but service not a Hilton,"As a Hilton fan I decided to book this hotel,  BUT pool is beautiful but no place unless you book a day in advance + charge. Staff don't know the basic information about the hotel it looks like it's the first day on the job :-) asked the reception at 22:30 if there was still something open for a drink in the hotel and he answers that the only Bar that is still open  is in the lobby!!!  I decided to go and check out the pool on the second floor and what do I find there is a beautiful lounge bar open till 01:00 but no customers. That's what happened when the reception telling every one that the lounge on the second floor is closed I don't think that the person at the reception even know that there is a place on the second floor it's a pity because there where about 8 waiters waiting for customers. On a different day I asked a staff of the hotel for bathroom on the first floor so he send me in a corridor with not bathroom lucky I was not in a hurry 😎. At my checking in I told reception I Will pay the hotel bill in cash and left my credit card as a Deposit 3 days before my check out I see that they have charged my credit card,I whent to the friendly reception left some more money in cash and they promised to refund my credit card so still waiting for it to show online. 😏 But one off the most frustrating thing in the hotel is the keycard I am staying at the hotel for 11 nights 2 rooms and every day I had to go to the reception to have my key re activated and every day they say don't keep it next to your phone. So at the end was scared to carry my phone with me !! But did not help the hotel has problems with they system because i so other customers complaining about the same problems.  So if you stay 1 night at the hotel and the key is not working next day you check out not problem but when staying 11 night very frustrating.   Now the positive things about the hotel !!!!   Staff are very friendly, rooms a big and modern,  food at the hotel pool is great probably one of the nicest hotel pools in Barcelona. ",3,2015,08,14
36,Ideal Stop Over,"Stayed here after our cruise, just for one night, very pleased, located slightly further away than I anticipated but this just meant a slightly longer taxi ride to Les Rambles.
The jewel in the crown for this hotel is the pool, terrace area This was incredible, large pool, attentive staff, ample loungers, loved it. Typical Hilton breakfast YUMMY, Could do with more lifts as there was quite a wait at times and they filled up easily especially when guests were laden with cases. Only a short walk to the beach, plenty of taxis outside the hotel, a very good shopping mall 100 yards across the road. All in all, very satisfactory.",4,2015,08,13
36,Just not great but it could be...,"A hotel with potential but very warn (physically tired) feeling.    The front desk and concierge desk, while very friendly, didn't seem to know basic information.  Lots of scurrying around that seemed very unfocused.",3,2015,08,13
36,poor quality,"I will not recommend this hotel to anyone. Very expensive hotel, even no internet. I had to wait for the towels severla times in the bathroom. No change of bed sheets(only make it look tidy)! They offer poor quality of breakfast in case you want to eat breakfast in resturant you have to pay 25€ extra! overally there are many other options of hotels with better quality.  You need to also pay extra in the pool if you want to get a bed close to the pool!",1,2015,08,12
36,Good hotel. Great location.,"This is a modern, clean hotel not far from the beach as well as in town attractions via the metro.

Staff and management are excellent.  They try hard to provide service.  We were able to use the Executive Club on the 15th floor.  They had lots to offer, but were over whelmed and over crowded during their ""happy hour"" when too many people were trying to make dinner out of the snacks.

While at the hotel, we rented a car from Sixt which is located in the lobby.  Very convenient, easy to return without having to go to a remote location.

The only suggestion that I have to offer is that there is no ""professional"" concierge at this hotel.  The staff that they use to work at the concierge desk is not very experienced and more than twice gave us wrong directions and not very good suggestions.",4,2015,08,10
36,Horrible Hilton loud and not appropriate for Children,This Hilton Diagonal Mar bills itself as an oasis in the city.  In reality it is a gauche party place for the over 40s where the music is so loud the rooms are throbbing from the beat from around 3 pm until 12 am saturday and sunday.  Secondly the number of professional women and drunk people make the pool totally unusable and unsuitable for families. The staff are indifferent to the noise and offer earplugs.    I came here to get away from the noise of the city and stay in a tranquil environment by the beach.  I would never stay here again and encourage families not to stay here,1,2015,08,10
36,4 night stay - August 2015,"We spent 4 nights at the hotel and stayed in standard rooms as part of British Airways holiday. Our 2 rooms had a partial sea-views, obscured slightly by two office blocks, but overlooked the pool area. The rooms were clean, air-conditioned, a good size and provided all we needed as a couple with two grown-up boys.

The hotel is in the business district so very functional and some might say clinical, but it's a Hilton so ticks all the right boxes, but not really recommended for a romantic getaway.   

We ate out for all meals and although the hotel is 10 minute Metro or taxi ride to the centre it has the advantage of being a 5 minute walk from the beach. The beaches aren't the most picturesque in the world but are clean, if quite busy.

The hotel pool and gym area is very nice, but you do have to compete with non-resident club members for pool-side loungers if that is important for your stay.     

We found it to be a great base from which to explore the city with good rooms and fantastic staff, particularly Georgina the concierge who couldn't have been more helpful.",5,2015,08,10
36,Fun in Barcelona,"To cap my European vacation, I decided to stay at Hilton Diagonal Mar. Although a bit far from the city center, everything is accessible through the subway train near the hotel. It is also close to a shopping mall and the beach.  

The guy who checked me in is really nice.  I pre-checked and selected my room a couple of days before arriving, but due to my status he gave me an upgrade to an executive room with an ocean view.   The size of the room is decent and clean (maybe because I always feel that hardwood floors always feel cleaner than carpeted ones.).  

The food in the Executive Lounge is decent.  Although the coffee machine was out of service one morning. But other than that, I'm pretty satisfied with that.  Only thing that could have been improved would be the check-out process.  The taxi stand is quite far from the hotel door and I had to drag my suitcase a block to get to a taxi.  Could have been better if they can call the cab for you.  But other than that, I think I had a nice time staying at this hotel.",4,2015,08,09
36,Mediocre Hilton - rip off price for car parking,"The Hilton Diagonal Mar is a mediocre Hilton. Whereas the hotel has a nice design style look, it also has a lot of areas which could be improved. On arrival we were not offered an upgrade to executive floors, which was a disappointment since this is the first time I was not upgraded as a HHONORS Gold Member. The room we received was nevertheless ok. The breakfast was reasonably good although we did not receive fresh orange juice on the second day (the oranges did not arrive - suprising since Spain has plenty of oranges...). The pool was ok but you should expect to pay 25 euro for a descent sunbed in the shade (if not you will be obliged to sit in a 1 star hotel sunbed in the sun). I found this really scandalous. The hotel has also many floors (23 i believe) but only 4 elevators so expect to spend a lot of time in the elevators. The worst was the parking, they charged 72 euro for 2 days. This is really rip off. Alll in all a mediocre Hilton Hotel not really in line with the normal Hilton standard.",3,2015,08,07
36,Great hotel,"We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. Polite staff, very nice and clean areas, lovely rooms and also pool and near by beach. Highly recommended if you plan to visit Barcelona. Breakfast was various and very tasty.",5,2015,08,06
36,Nice Stay in Barcelona,"We stayed at the Hilton Diagonal Mar on the last night of our vacation.  The hotel was nice, modern and clean.  Breakfast was a bit pricey but good.  We would definitely stay there again when visiting Barcelona.  It is close to pubic transportation and in a nice area of the city.",4,2015,08,05
36,The Best Hotel in Barcelona,"We are currently staying at this hotel for the fifth time, and became Hilton Honors members as a result of our positive experiences at this hotel.

We were sceptical about the Purobeach Experience (new this year) and raised our concerns with the hotel before booking.  We received a personal and positive response from the Hotel Manager and were supported by the excellent staff working on the pool deck when we arrived today.

I am sure that I could concur with many of the experiences of other guests, but overall this hotel's attributes, including an excellent location (good Metro and Tram access to other parts of the city, as well as being close to the beach and to modern shops and restaurants); its many excellent staff; rooms with ""views to die for"" and a Manager who is clearly keen to listen to and respond to his guests, far outweigh any negatives.

I hope the remainder of our holiday is, once again, a very positive experience.",5,2015,08,03
36,Very good but far from city center,"I stayed in this hotel 4 night hotel has good swimming pool and near the beach. Brekfast was various and waitress were really polite.
The room was big and had a comfortable bed and you can find ice maker at the floor .the elevators were very big and modern but at the busy time of the day you must wait for elevators and it wasn't good.another negative thing that you can't find wifi at room.",5,2015,08,02
36,Fantastic Staff and Great Views,"I recently stayed at this property while in Barcelona for a work event, that was taking place on the beach. While the location isn't ideal for everyone, it was excellent for my needs, shuttling back and forth to the beach. The hotel staff was warm and accommodating, the views were gorgeous, the rooms very nice and well-appointed and I loved the pool. I would absolutely recommend it to anyone looking for a quiet location with easy access to the tourist bus, shopping mall and more.",4,2015,07,30
36,Usual HIlton Excellence in Decent Location,"As stated in the title, this property pulled out the usual excellence of a Hilton international hotel.  Rooms were very good, well-decorated and with all the just-right amenities.  Would be difficult to get a room without a decent view, either of the city or of beach/sea.
Staff extremely professional and helpful.
Breakfast was the usual high-end buffet offered at other Hilton properties, offering something good for everyone except those with extreme dietary prejudices.

I would definitely consider staying here on a return trip to Barcelona.",4,2015,07,25
36,Beautiful Hotel and View!,"This hotel is beautiful and in a great location for a reasonable price. It sits only about two blocks from the beach giving you a short walk there and is right across the street from a nice and quite large shopping mall that also has a lot of restaurants and a movie theater for those looking for something to do close by. One day, we did walk from La Sagrada Familia to the hotel, which was a far way, but there is a metro stop nearby so I would suggest for everyone to avoid the trek downtown and take the metro to wherever you are going as taxis can be really expensive in the area. Also, if you are a Hilton Honors member, the executive lounge is very nice with a great selection of food and drinks as well as an amazing view from the balcony overlooking the Mediterranean. I would recommend to anyone whether you are staying a night or a month to stay here as you will certainly have an incredibly comfortable visit.",5,2015,07,24
36,Location is not too bad!,"The price is much affordable than downtown hotels. You can go anywhere you want if you take any of the Sightseeing Bus( you REALLY need it anyway.) ! The bus stop are only 200 feet away from the hotel.  There is a big three stories shopping mallright cross the street. The font desk since under staff; always have to wait for a long time to get any type of help, especially at check in or at check out hour.",5,2015,07,22
36,very nice hotel but ohhh ... that awful pool music !!,"Lovely hotel, and as the temperatures in Barcelona were very high during our visit, we appreciated the pool... however, one word of advice, the pool has a 'club' format, so there is a DJ and constant house music aimed at a young generation of visitors ( in fact, over weekend most of the people around the pool and with the best sunbeds have paid to get in and are not hotel guests) There is only so much thump thump THUMP music you can stand before it gets on your nerves and low and behold you are not safe either when you go back to your room as the lifts have the same techno beat music playing... This hotel is right in the middle of the new business district so I am not sure why they can not cater for all music tastes.  One thing this hotel should urgently look into is the speed of their lifts and perhaps install some more, The average wait for a lift was 10 mins, on our day at 10 am on a monday morning, I waited for 13 !!! mins with my suitcase before the lift finally stopped at my floor , this is just unacceptable.  And to finish off... my usual gripe with Hilton hotels in general, Free wifi should be standard all day, not just in the lounge of the hotel and then costing a fortune for one day use !!!",4,2015,07,21
36,Great hotel and great value,What a great hotel. I stay at Hilton's all the time and this was one of my favorite. A great location right across the street from Diaagonal Mar Mall and a block from the beach. Purobeach Club pool at the hotel made me feel like I was in Vegas. Reserve a few chairs by the pool. Huge breakfast buffet was great too.,5,2015,07,19
36,"Nice view, great pool area, still an average hotel","We arrived late in the evening, and the check-in was quick and easy. The cashier was very helpful and upgraded our room on request. As being hungry at our arrival, and restaurants nearby being closed, we ordered from the room service menu. We had two bottles of water, two Coronas and three ham and cheese sandwiches, at the price of 73 Euros, really overprized! The key cards to the room kept stop working, even though we didn't keep them close to our mobile phones, and being quite a wait for the elevators sometimes, that was somehow annoying. Our day at the Purobeach was really nice and calm. We had lunch at the restaurant, and ordered salad and a bottle of white wine. We did not get the wine before we were almost finished with our meal, and we asked for it twice. Be aware that the hotel charge you from everything you remove from the minibar, even though you just take it out to look at it for a few seconds. They also tried to charge us for internet, although it was included in our upgrade. The cashier fixed all this at check out. Overall the hotel is nice, but I would expect more for the price we paid.",3,2015,07,19
36,"Great location, close to beach","This is a pleasant hotel but certainly not as great as some of the Hiltons we’ve stayed in. We were in an Executive room on floor 22 (out of 23) and it was generally a very long wait for a lift to come.  There was no ice bucket in the room (even though there’s an ice machine by the lift).  They charge you if you want an ice bucket.  Also we only had one glass in the room (I didn’t ask for another in case they charged for that too).  They also charge (20 EUR) to empty the minibar if you want to use it as a fridge but there is a small space at the top of the mini bar marked “for guest use” that just fitted a small bottle of water.
Our room looked over Diagonal Mar shopping centre rather than the beach.  The rooms don’t have balconies so the only place to sit outside was the Executive lounge (stunning views from there) or the pool area called “Purobeach”.  They tried to tell us we should reserve a sunbed at Purobeach to be sure of getting one.  They charge 25 EUR per person per day to reserve a sunbed which we thought was exorbitant and as it turned out we had no problem getting one anyway.  The sunbeds are extremely close together so quite difficult to walk between them – you certainly get to know your neighbour quite quickly!!  Also by 3pm we found they really turned the music up loud which we didn’t like, it just doesn’t seem relaxing when the music’s blaring away so that was usually our cue to leave.
We’d paid the bed and breakfast rate and breakfast was good, just as you’d expect from a Hilton and the staff in the breakfast room were delightful.
The Executive lounge was a bit disorganised and ran out of food and drinks most nights and people would be hunting around for cutlery, glasses, napkins etc.
We had a great Concierge who recommended we get about on the Barcelona Metro (subway system) which is quite close to the hotel (round the back of Diagonal Mar shopping centre) and was a great way to see Barcelona.",4,2015,07,19
36,Nice views of the Mediterranean,"Only 2 things were great about the hotel - the view and our waitress at dinner in the hotel dining room (Paula).  The rest of our stay was very average.  As Diamond members, we were moved to the 22nd floor (out of 23), so we had a lovely view of the sea.  The executive lounge was very average and ran out of food and drinks often.  The breakfast was also very average.  (We walked over to the mall and hit Starbucks for breakfast a couple mornings.)  Our bed was not very comfortable and the phone on the bedside table was missing buttons.  There was only 1 waste can for the room - a small one in the bathroom.  The shower flow was very weak, as well.  It was always quite a wait for the elevators, and it seemed one of the 4 was always out of service.  The maid service was also slow - we were gone most of the day and returned around 4:30 to find our room still unmade.  The mall is right across the street, with several restaurants, which we tried.  It's about a 10 - 15 minute cab ride into the old city, depending on where you want to go.  Next time we will probably stay in that area.",3,2015,07,18
36,First time out of the city,"I stayed for two night in the executive floor.. The rooms was just what you would expect from success a consistent performer.

My only grumble was check in .! As executive access we should have been taken to the lounge to wait room preparation.

Put this to one side and you have got in my opinion the perfect holiday/business/pleasure hotel. 

Puro beach is a concept of cool and elegance food and cocktail of the highest quality.. It is great and it deserves 5 stars of it's own.
We will be back in August for 4 nights next time.. Can't wait.! 
",5,2015,07,18
36,"Modern, Clean, Functional","Some might not find the location appealing as it is some ways down the beach out of town. On the upside it is really close to the metro station that will get you pretty much anywhere in around 30 mins max. (good AC in the metro you Londoners will be delighted to hear). Plus it is in walking distance of the beach. Another upside is the Purobeach setup at the hotel pool. Good vibes, hip tunes and really decent food and good service. 
Rooms are a good size, are showing some light signs of ageing, might need some attention pretty soon. A wonky sofa bed for our child was very quickly and efficiently replaced by a proper bed in the room. 
I would not bother booking your stay with breakfast, even though the spread is excellent, Barcelona has so many great breakfast spots on offer (like a really nice little bakery?cafe just round the corner, unless of course you are a business traveller, then you will be happy with the breakfast. For holiday travellers it is simply overpriced and not really necessary. (EUR 25.00 pp.).
All in all a really good hotel at a fair price.",4,2015,07,16
36,Great hotel,"This is a very good hotel situated at the end of the diagonal mar, blessed with stunning views from the executive lounge unbeaten by many hotels around the world .
The hotel has both the city and sea views, and whilst not located in the city centre, it is a good retreat out of the busy city, Travel to and from the centre is very easy  with a local Metro line and also Tram line very close by.
The hotel has  a stunning pool deck and also a beach located a short walk away. There is also a good shopping centre residing alongside the hotel.

I would strongly recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a mixture of city and chill out holiday.

There areonly two areas of improvement that would have made me rate excellent, the first is the lifts - there are four lifts but the combination seems to be very flawed and there is often a long wait.
The second during my stay was the maid service whilst the room was left clean and tidy, the bathroom wasn't, with empty toiletry bottles left in the bath. the tea and coffee was also not replenished on day two - however these are both fairly minor things for a very good hotel.",4,2015,07,16
36,Nice hotel,"Nice hotel, great shoppingcenter across the street with very good restaurants.
Business area, but close to beach and metro, apprx 15 minutes to the rambla
Nice pool area, but the sunbeds close to pool are expensive, 25 €/day - Other sunbeds further away are free
Breakfast good and staff very helpfull and polite
",5,2015,07,15
36,"Last day in Barcelona, should have been first!","We booked this room for a post cruise day of rest. While we did arrival very early the staff did a good job of welcoming us. We waited for our rooms in the lobby, we should have gone to the pool area and got the day off to world class start! The pool area is impeccable!! While the ocean is just 2 block away, I would stay up on the pool!!!
Rooms do show a little wear and tear, as do the hallways. There is a mall across the street for food. Recommend this for second choice for food, the really good stuff is a taxi ride away....",5,2015,07,15
36,Unannounced construction activity.,"We had a recent 5 night stay at the Hilton Diagonal Mar in Barcelona. A hotel I have visited several times before and have been happy with. This time started also good as we, on my request, was allowed to check in from the exec. lounge on the 15th floor due to a very long line in lobby of people waiting to check in.
The disappointment started Monday morning when all baths on the rooms across the hall from us on the 18th floor was being refurbished. So early in the morning the crew moved in with power tools and the noise and racquet started. I raised this with the nice staff in the lounge but all they could do was referee me to the manager. (he had left for the day) I also raised this at check out and the lady was sorry she hadn't heard anything about any construction work..??..? So nobody could solve my issue before we left. This was noticeable for 2 of our 5 days stay. So I'm not to happy this time, even if the staff is nice and normally very good at fulfilling any request",2,2015,07,15
36,Great Stay except experience in 1st Floor Restaurant for Breakfast,"We stayed at this hotel after disembarking our cruise ship adventure (on July 5-6).  We stayed for 1 evening prior to returning to the US.  I am a Hilton Gold Member and believe that the benefits that you get as a Hilton Gold Member are really good at this property.  The front desk staff was very friendly when we checked in.  They shared that we would receive either a full breakfast in the 1st floor restaurant or a continental breakfast in the Executive Lounge.  We booked 3 rooms and were told that those privileges extended to all 3 rooms, since they were booked and paid for by me as the Gold member.  The rooms are very modern and ""westernized"". The hotel even provides complimentary converters and adapters at the front desk if you need one.  

My only disappointment was how we were treated at the restaurant for breakfast.  My husband and son went down to eat breakfast 1st and shared 1 of the 3 room numbers.  They did not have any issues with obtaining the complimentary full breakfast.  However, when my daughter and I went down shortly thereafter, the hostess was very rude.  She said that we would have to pay for breakfast.  I asked her to check again and ask the manager if needed as were were told that we would obtain a complimentary breakfast and that my husband and son had not had any issues.  She supposedly checked with the manager and confirmed that in fact I should get this benefit.  

My parents (who were in our 3rd room) went down for breakfast about an hour after each of us and they were given the run around.  They were told that they would need to pay and the lady was extremely rude to them.  My parents didn't want to argue, indicated that they would pay, and then the lady acted as though she was doing them a favor by ""comping"" their breakfast.  

The hostess has a sheet with names and room numbers that she is supposed to check when you come down for breakfast.  I was VERY disappointed in the service and rude behavior by the hostess and shared my discontent with the front desk staff when checking out.  I'm not sure if this feedback made its way back to the restaurant manager, thus, I decided to ensure my feedback was included here.  

Overall, I really loved this property.  It was conveniently located near a mall and other eateries.  Unfortunately, the customer service provided by the restaurant hostess really left a sour taste in our mouths and I would be reluctant to return.",4,2015,07,13
36,GOOD,"This hotel is very comfortable, friendly and has many amenities. Your pool is very nice and is located near beautiful beaches. Its location in general is not very close to the tourist centers of Barcelona, but has excellent means of transport, very close and good shopping,  The restaurant and breakfast are of very good quality, nice, well stocked and plentiful.  In short, I recommend it as a good hotel in Barcelona.",4,2015,07,13
36,Front Desk Rude and Unhelpful,"After I checked in I realized I did not tell the clerk that I am a Hilton Honors member.  When I went back to give him the information to have the number attached to our reservation, I asked about internet.  Which as an  honors member I do received.  They told me that I did not have access to the internet unless I paid 13$.  No mentioned about receiving the service because I was an honors member.  No mentioned that all guest received 6 hours of the internet.  They were rude and unhelpful!",1,2015,07,13
36,quick over night,"Very modern hotel in busy area of town. Didn't get time to use all services, but had a great nights rest. Wonderful cold or hot buffet breakfast to start our day. Great glassed in shower after you figure out how to work it.",5,2015,07,12
36,Mixed feelings,"I am a Hilton Gold member and stay at Hilton properties whenever possible. Check in was fine.  I did get an upgrade to the tranquil room that has a tub. We were traveling with friends and just a tour and were a bit hot so we thought to go to the pool.  I asked where the pool was and if they served food.  I was told the information.  We changed into our suits and headed to the pool to coll off and get a bite to eat.  The pool area is awesome.  However we were stopped at the pool and asked if we had a reservation in a very arrogant tone.  We were also asked if we were hotel guest.  We were told there was a wait.  So we got a bite to eat at the restaurant by the pool.  We were so put off, after we ate, we left and went to the beach. The next morning for breakfast, we were seated right next to all the stored luggage. I did have a cold and was coughing, but there were loads of empty tables that we could have been taken to, In all my years of being in the Hilton honors program, I have never felt unwanted at a Hilton before. 

On a positive not..the concierge was wonderful! He helped us to secure transportation to the airport the next day.  He was also at the front desk as we checked out.  He was the only friendly face we saw this stay",3,2015,07,11
36,Too much hassle despite great facilitied,"If like me you going to Barcelona for the city and a bit of leisure this is not the hotel for you
Facilities are superb but the leisure side is shambolic 
The hotel seem to run the pool area area like a leisure club consequently you may not even get a sunbed or if you do you have to queue for up to 30 minutes as per this morning to be seated
Clearly they are trying to be all things to all people forgetting the core business which is providing accommodation and facilities for paying guests
Yesterday was my birthday and a friend who lives locally came to the hotel for lunch. To get into the pool area to see me he was given the 3rd degree and one of the hosts wanted to charge him
As a consequence we went elsewhere for lunch
Whilst I am a Hilton fan and generally only stay at Hilton's, when I leave on Tuesday I will not be coming back here in the future
",3,2015,07,11
36,disapointing,"when you go to a hilton! you expect proper services. special touch for everything . from the decoration, to the restaurant, bar, rooms.
but when you go to this hilton, nothing of thiis
1st -  a payment internet!  250 euro simple bedroom and you still need to9 pay for a internet connection.!!!
2nd - no parking place for cars...not even a discount if you re a guest!!instead of this you get a 50% over priced parking compared to the other ones in barcelona town.!!!!
3rd -  room service made mistakes all the time...you order a steak. 30min later they said they forget!!!!!
4th - staff  doenst really care about your needs!!its all about the hotel policy, we cant do this we cant do that!!
if you want to spend 250 euro for a crap hotel that gives you a 50euro/hotel service , go ahead..hilton is the perfect place for that...
NEVER AGAIN",1,2015,07,10
36,Check where you want to be - but great hotel,"The hotel is great, but check where you want to be. This hotel is located well out of town so I'd suggest there are better options for a first time visit to Barcelona. Now, having got the location out of the way the hotel is good value, and close to the beach, right opposite a shopping centre, and has great room service food. Rooms are very 'hilton' and comfortable. 

Staff were all helpful and service was good. 

We are regular visitors to Barcelona and knew the location we wanted to be - BUT, there were plenty of people who were disappointed how far out of town it was (seriously people, check the map!). If a first time visitor to BCN and you want the Barcelona Beach life I'd suggest a hotel around Barcelonetta (e.g. W Hotel, Pullman or Hotel Arts). For sightseeing then something in the city (around Las Ramblas, Plaza Catalunya, Exiample). Whilst there are plenty of travel options from the Hilton to get you into town it would become tiresome I think - but if you've been to BCN before and know the location then this is a great option in that area. I'd stay again.",4,2015,07,10
36,"Typical hilton business hotel, very nice pool and bar","It's the typical hilton business hotel, steps from a large conference centre. It's not the best area of Barcellona - far from the nightlife and the historic centre - however the hotel offers a lot of amenities in the typical hilton style.
Excellent the pool and the pool bar.",4,2015,07,10
36,Far from center but very nice hotel,"I went to the hotel for 1 night with my mum.
We got a beautiful sea views room in the executive floor. Super views and very illuminated. 
The bed was big and comfortable and the bathroom very spacious and nice. 
As we had access to the Lounge Club we went there and they a very beautiful terrace with sea views. All the snacks were good, specially the cava. The service very attentive and nice. 
The pool area it's cool but i believe it's becoming trendy like a pool club ans this makes you feel in a disco pool more than relax in the pool.
I think they should have an other relax pool. Anyways the hotel is far from the center but it has a mall just in front and Sagrada Familia it's near. Thank you to all the team it was a nice experience.

",5,2015,07,10
36,Anniversary celebration,"This hotel was so nice and well located. We were joining a cruise and it was very close. They upgraded us to a lovely room overlooking the city including the Sagrada Familla. They gave us a lovely bottle of wine and dessert to help celebrate. The hotel is across the street from several restaurants and a shopping mall. Our room had 2 walls of windows so we brought a lovely meal back to our room where we enjoyed the city below us. 
Great front desk help and great concierges. They took care of our every need. 
A great water view from the executive lounge with balcony seating. 
We enjoyed our time at this Hilton",5,2015,07,09
36,"Amazing hotel, location, resort style quality, friendly staff","This hotel is fairly new, it has all the amenities typical for a Hilton, they offer discounts for the hotel restaurant, well worth the price, especially for breakfast. The staff are friendly, free internet, great views of the city and the beach. The location is next to a the beach and mall, which has many nice restaurants for all tastes. It is walking distance to the Metro and the beach, the 15th floor executive lounge has breathtaking views of the city and the beach. They have a nice pool area where you can lounge in cabanas or do morning yoga.",5,2015,07,09
36,Would come here again. Great breakfast.,"Stayed only one night but have nothing really very negative to say about this hotel. Great breakfast. Free Wifi in room,

Room service (steak) : not great. Would have expected more from a Hilton restaurant. Small breads that came with the meal were so hard you could knock somebody dead with them.  

Small thing is that there were no cotton pads and no cotton buds in the room. These things are expected to be there in hotels like this.",4,2015,07,09
36,Great location for families-- easy food and play,"My wife and 2 kids (7 & 9) went to this hotel.  The rooms were very good.  No problems, nothing spectacular.  Service was very good.  They were able to get us in a room even though we were very early.

The executive lounge was good, but could use a little improvement.  The breakfast was exactly the same all 5 days.  Bacon and scrambled eggs every time for the hot food.  It seems they could rotate the food sometimes.  For evening snacks, they only had one hot food option even though they had 2 hot food trays.  It would have been nice to have 2 hot food options.  A little variety or more options would be nice.  I know it isn't a big lounge but I think a little more could be done.

What I really liked about the hotel was location.  There is a mall across the street with lots of food options inside and outside the mall.  There were at least 3 nice playgrounds nearby for the kids (one outside the mall) that the kids really enjoyed.  Be sure to check them out.  Also, the beach is in very easy walking distance and the kids loved the beach.  

We also like that taxis were just outside the door and we felt the taxi rates were reasonable for anyplace we wanted to go.  

One negative is the outdoor pool area.  One night they had a very loud fashion show which went until a little past 10 PM.  That did not work good for us and the kids.  The base was very loud and we could feel the vibrations from our rooms even though we were very high up.  We were pretty tired the next day and had an early morning tour.  I hope they don't plan on doing shows that late again.

If we come back to Barcelona, we will definitely strongly consider this property.  It does make things easy with kid friendly food options and entertainment nearby.",5,2015,07,08
36,Resort feel,"Stayed at this hotel for 3 days.  The pool area felt like a true resort should feel.  They have great music playing, attentive service by the pool, and great drinks.  The only downside of this hotel is that it is located in the ""newer section"" of the city and requires use of either subway (not too far) or taxi.  I would definitely get over my jet lag at this place again.",5,2015,07,08
36,"Great value, good location","Perfect for a business or leisure trip. Really high standard of cleanliness and friendly staff, good food & great cocktails ;-) The gym is small but adequate..cheap taxi ride into the city and lots of shops and restaurants straight across from the hotel.",4,2015,07,08
36,Peaceful retreat seaside,"Upon arrival I was greeted and assisted with my luggage. My husband and I stayed in a wonderful corner room .  It was wonderfully appointed and had views of the sea and the shopping area.  The fitness facility boasted treadmills , nautilus machinery and a a view of the pool area .  Pool is truly for adults .  The bar area is fun and a pleasant venue before dinner .   Plenty of taxis await .   It is close to many sights and bus service.  It is a distance from the airport and taxis are recommended . We strolled the mall too .",5,2015,07,05
36,Nice hotel and executive lounge,"We stayed here for two nights while on vacation.  The hotel caters to American guests and the executive lounge had good free breakfast options. The location is not close to a lot of dining options, but the few places outside of the mall were pretty good.   Beach access is close.  Pool looked very nice but we didn't use it.  Warning to Americanos: twin beds are tiny and not for sharing.  Room was very clean. 

The place isn't far from the subway station, making access to the city attractions like Segrada Familia a breeze.  Allow for slow traffic in the morning if you're going to the train station in the morning--it's about 30 minutes and maybe 25€.",4,2015,07,02
36,Good hotel an location,"This hotel have very nice and spacious rooms, the lobby area is very nice and is located across the street from a big mall with lots of restaurants and even an outdoor playground. There is a beach near by but we didn't go we took taxi to another beach area to have dinner and walk around. Breakfast buffe was also very good",4,2015,07,01
36,"Great hotel, across from mall and near beach","This was a nice hotel, the lobby is spacious and has food and drinks. I had a really nice snack of a chicken wrap and it was really good. Nice elevators, and they secure your bags if you arrive before your room is ready. The room was very nice, the bed was wonderful. The air conditioning worked. We had a nice view of the mall across the street. It was a weekend and there were kids out playing on a playground in front of the mall until 12 to 1 am! That was surprising! The lobby has computers that you can use. I don't think the wifi is free here unless you have Hilton honors. I don't think this is a very smart move. Wifi should be free, it's 2015 for Christs sake!
The mall is a great place to people watch and there was nice places to eat. Especially the ice cream stand and the crepe place! 
The hotels breakfast was very good! The best I've seen in Europe.",5,2015,07,01
36,OK for a work trip,"I stayed here for one night on a work trip and didnt spend a significant amount of time in the hotel. Service was good and efficient but I found the lighting in the room a little dark. Bed was reasonably comfortable. Breakfast the next morning was pretty much non-existant. There was a few pieces of bread, some jam and mini cereal boxes (corn flakes or special k) which was all served along the bar. I know its a continental breakfast but there could have been a little more on offfer. Its close to my office so likely I will be there again but its very much a business hotel and far from the main attractions of Barcelona.",3,2015,07,01
36,"Great location for convention, chaotic service","Stayed for four nights during a conference. Always a queue/ didn't feel there was enough people handling check in. Great confusion about breakfast (breakfast was included in our rate; so one expects to be able to order it to ones room and pay delivery/service - in the Hilton they've created a new rule of free breakfast onky at buffet or if one comes down to breakfast and charge full price for the breakfast if one orders to ones room. In order for this to work it needs to be made explicit in booking details and at check in - which it wasn't..... Crests bad will and delays at check out.

Rooms decent size and clean, some with good views. Lobby bar a bit blah. The 2nd floor pool, restaurant and lingers is quite lovely, well designed and food decent enough however service chaotic (took 25 mins to get a bottle of rose and another 5 to get an extra glass).

Location withing walking distance of convention centre and across from Diafonal Mar shopping centre is excellent if attending a conference.",3,2015,07,01
36,Wonderful hotel,"We booked 2 rooms for a 2 night stay. Rooms were spacious, check in was a breeze, staff was very helpful and friendly. Location is a little bit far from the center, but it's very close to the beach. Metro stop is very close and easy to use. Shopping mall across the street has many restaurants to choose from too. Would definitely recommend!",4,2015,06,30
36,Good hotel for a business trip,"We travelled to Barcelona for a business trip. The Hilton Diagonal Mar was an ideal basecamp for us in terms of location, and was only a short direct train ride to the centre of town. The area in and around the hotel was very quiet, and close to the beach.

We arrived in the morning and were delighted to be able to check in immediately. Our room was clean and spacious, all we really required for a business trip.

The staff were polite and helpful throughout.

Breakfast was €25 but quite disappointing and not worth the cost in our opinion. Perhaps this was because we arrived half-and-hour before the end of serving.

There is free Wi-Fi in various areas around the hotel, basically the first 3 floors, which was a little temperamental. There were no BBC/Sky channels on the television which was a first for us, so we made do with other countries' news channels to fill any rare spare moments back in the room.

The gym is quite small and basic, but just about adequate for our needs.

The bar on the ground floor is a good spacious area for large groups to congregate. Purobeach on the second floor is a very pleasant area indeed, whether sunbathing, eating or drinking. Spaces around the pool can be booked, and the staff were perhaps a little too keen to charge for this even if there was barely anyone around.

All in all it was a good stay, although there was a large error on our final bill, which the staff subsequently rectified appropriately.",3,2015,06,30
36,Close to the beach and service great.,Our room had a view of the beach so it was a nice get away from the city.  It is close to the on and off sightseeing bus.  There are also taxis waiting to take you to the old town.  The service was very helpful to check us in to the hotel and give us maps.  It is a little far from the sights of Barcelona but I liked being by the ocean.  We went next door to the shopping mall and purchased a 19 euro bag to take home.  I enjoyed seeing the fashion displayed in the windows.,5,2015,06,29
36,Destination Hilton Diagonal Mar Purobeach,"We have just returned from a six night stay at this hotel, and our third stay this year.....so why do we keep returning to Barcelona and to this hotel ??
In one answer "" outstanding service"".......from the moment we arrive we truly feel that we are returning to our second home in Barcelona, the welcome we receive from the entire team is so genuine, in fact we consider them all as Family and not staff.
We are allocated our usual room ( thank you Yolanda ) even though this time I booked the hotel and flight together with BA instead of my usual separate booking. One word of warning by doing the hotel booking through a third party as a Diamond HH member it will not count to your HH profile and you will not earn any HH points.
I am fed up reading reports about the poor location of this hotel, it is one of the best locations away from the hustle and bustle of the city centre, but if you want that, a ten minute metro ride takes you right into the centre ( buy a T10 ticket at the Forum stop ).The beach is a short stroll one block away and the promenade runs the entire length of the city, great for an am jog.
The hotel pool area has recently rebranded to The Purobeach and the change is totally amazing for sure this is now the key destination in Barcelona. We enjoyed six days of total pampering, our prime sun bed reserved on a daily basis and every detail was covered from the daily welcome tray to the outstanding quality of food served by the great staff...of yes the Purobeach house wine was rather good too...ask no more !!!!
This hotel continues to shine, great breakfast selection and any special requirements met and despite some very busy morning services the staff worked so hard and efficiently but more importantly always with that smile.
The Executive lounge team were as always a pleasure to be with, great attentive service despite our high demands !!!!!???
The 15th floor outside terrace allows the guests to enjoy a panoramic view of the beach and City....and even better with a chilled glass of wine. 
Will this be our last visit this year...???  I somehow think not....so until we return, fellow travellers don't delay in experiencing the Hilton Diagonal Mar for yourself, you will not be disappointed.
",5,2015,06,29
36,Stay in Barcelona,"We were staying as a group for one night so hotel was chosen for us. Couldn't have been more pleased. The room was quite comfortable and provided a view of the water although we did not ask for this. The staff was very friendly during check in and check out. With a large group they managed to do this in a very efficient manner. Their bar staff seemed a little overwhelmed, however they were attentive. The pool seemed a distance away from the main hotel, but I didn't use this facility, I'm only going by what I could see from my room. I would recommend this hotel if ever in Barcelona again.",5,2015,06,29
36,Manucore conference,"An excellent stay in a hotel, well equipped for these type of conferences. I can recommend based on my experience. The bedrooms are spacious, the meeting rooms well equipped and the employees always happy to support where needed.",4,2015,06,29
36,Nice Hotel-rude staff-strange rooms,"We arrived from the port earlier than expected and our room was not ready.  As a Hilton Citi Card holder and Gold Level member when we arrive early we are usually given access to the Executive Lounge (as we were in Venice 13 days earlier).  At this hotel we were told that was not possible as the Executive Level was over-sold.  We were also told our Executive Level room was over sold and we were not going to be able to have access to the Executive Lounge at all and we were being given an upgrade to the relaxation room instead.  This was nothing more than a strangely laid out room with a jacuzzi tub.  Our friends are Diamond Level and they were told they were told they could not have early access the Lounge also.  They asked for a manager and the access key quickly appeared.  We just went with them and amazingly the room was empty and not ""over crowded"".  We were not overly impressed with any of the staff at this hotel and were happy to check out the next day.",3,2015,06,28
36,Very Nice Hotel,"Stayed at this hotel on business and I had a room on the 9th floor.  I had a nice size room with views of the rooftop bar and swimming pool, and the sea.  My room had a proper double bed - not two singles pushed together and a good sized bathroom.  The hotel isn't centrally located but it is near the beach, a train station is about 5 minutes walk away (can't remember the name sorry) and takes around 25 minutes to get to the airport by taxi (cost me around 30 euros).  I had complimentary wi-fi in my room for the 3 nights that I stayed there (YAY!!) and it didn't lose it's connection once.  Room service was very good and prompt, breakfast was OK - it wasn't anything special and for 25 euros you can probably get a lot more for your money if you ate outside the hotel, it's opposite the Diagonal Mar shopping centre which has a food court if you want a change.  I'm not saying the breakfast was bad, there was lots of choices but I can only eat so much and to be served with the same thing everyday, you might fancy something different for 25 euros each day.

It is also opposite the CCIB so if you have an event there I would recommend staying at this hotel.  If you are here on a break/as a tourist, I think you may prefer to stay somewhere more central as there is little to see and do around this area - but as I said before the train station isn't too far away and you could always get a taxi into town.  The hotel does have a nice pool bar area on the 2nd floor which looks really nice especially at night - but that's as lively as it gets.  The staff are very friendly and willing to help.  This is my 2nd time staying here on business - mainly because of the business I had at the CCIB, but If I needed to stay in this area again for business I would choose this hotel.  If I came to Barcelona as a tourist I think I would prefer to stay somewhere closer to the centre, but I wouldn't completely rule this hotel out.",4,2015,06,27
36,I would not recommend this hotel,"If you are asked via e-mail, and prior to your arrival, if you would like to be upgraded for a minimal fee of Euro 17 per day, and your answer was yes, make sure you print a copy as proof. Also make sure you ask for slippers upon arrival as it doesn't come as standard in your room. If your bed squeaks expect to be stuck with it till you end of your stay",2,2015,06,27
36,Excellent week-long stay,"I've attended a convention at the nearby CCIB for the last four years and have until now stayed at the nearby Diagonal Zero, which has been absolutely fine. But for a change - and because I spent a good deal of time in the excellent lobby bar on my last visit - I decided this time to give the Hilton a try and absolutely loved it.

The lobby bar is light and airy and a great rendezvous at the end of the day. That said during the week I was there, they couldn't take card payments which made like a little more difficult, but the staff were friendly and attentive.

The room I had - I think a deluxe - was excellent, with both a bath and a shower and all the usual mod cons, albeit in a very stylish and chic setting. Housekeeping was excellent. You have to pay for wifi - as you do with an increasing number of hotels - but at least it worked throughout the building and not just in my room.

My stay didn't include breakfast, which in truth was more than a little over-priced at €25 a throw, but did at least have an exceptional spread of hot and cold choices. 

But compared to its local competitors however, the true selling point of the hotel however during the week I stayed there is/was the first floor pool/bar, which had been transformed since I last visited to (apparently) an 'urban oasis'. Seeing past the marketing speak, what has been introduced is a very cool spa and dining area to add to a great pool and sunbathing space.

Highly recommended and definitely my choice next year.",4,2015,06,26
36,Nothing more than average,"Clean, bright and airy lobby. Good check-in staff and pleased my room was ready on arrival. First room however stank of cigarettes, so staff promptly moved me to another room. Clean sheets and fairly spacious but the decor is far from attractive and rooms are average at best. Lovely pool area but it costs a mint to use. The Indigo restaurant was very poor and as the conference is used mainly for business I would ensure that you check before you book, as prices were pretty high when we went. Definitely not a hotel for leisure but for functional business if you really want to be right next to the convention centre it is handy. NO free wi-if which was annoying.",3,2015,06,25
36,hilton diagonal mar,Great hotel with a fab pool. Also a fab executive lounge. Had a junior suite. Just across the road are places to eat and drink. Most important the hotel is a short walk from a fab beach with a bar and sun lounger hire (25 euros),5,2015,06,25
36,Love the views from this hotel,"We have stayed here once before and only returned to Barcelona to stay here as we had already done the sights and this was a coast to Coast road trip. That was the only mistake we made as car parking is very very expensive when you are not even intending to use the car . I am a Diamond HH member and we were given a lovely room on high floor with sea view. The Executive Lounge is very good and staff very welcoming. We had breakfast there outside on the terrace on the 15th floor with great views and again drinks and canapés each evening. Great standard and no problem with food/ drink being topped up when needed. The tram stops behind the shopping centre opposite and the metro only one street behind that, so really really easy to get into the centre of the city. The shopping centre is very good and even has a Primark now and big supermarket if you need to stock up with water and supplies. Also lots of tapas, McDonalds opposite too so you won't go hungry !
I love the fact the hotel is in a quieter area as find the noise overwhelming sometimes.
There is a lovely walk through the Olympic Park opposite to a quiet beach too and my husband ran every day along the beach front. The Wi Fi which was provided free as HH member was not very good in our room though but a little better in the Executive Lounge.",4,2015,06,25
36,Wasn't expecting this �� ....,"Just spent a lovely weekend in Barcelona enjoying the beautiful city and taking full advantage of the sea location of this Hilton Hotel.
The hotel appears to be busy at all times however our room on the sixteenth floor was well above the din and offered very peaceful nights sleeps 👏🏻
Having some time to wait before my taxi transfer to Barcelona Airport I settled into the very spacious lobby and ordered a soft drink ( diet coke ) 
Have to say I was somewhat shocked to be charged €6 for the pleasure 😧 !!",4,2015,06,23
36,Fantastic Hotel with beautiful views.,"I just wish it had been warmer while I was there.  The building itself is a work of art, and the rest is standard international Hilton.  You won't be disappointed with this property, though it is a little out of the way from the city center, it's still close to shopping and the coast, and just a short tram ride away.  There's no negatives here and I prefer staying at this location than right downtown as it makes me feel like it's more of a vacation even if it's business.",5,2015,06,21
36,Wonderful Hotel,"This is the best hotel in Barcelona out of the Hilton Family particularly if you are a Gold or Diamond Member like we were. The service is great, food is good and it's very close to the beach - plus a shopping mall just opposite. However I was very surprised at how they only offer Diamond members two bottles of complimentary water per day even if there is more than one guest. Every other Hilton in the U. S., Singapore, United Arab Emirates and even Finland gave us as many as we wanted (usually around 4 bottles per person per day) which is very much appreciated. My mother and I will definitely come back next year and stay here again however if the water bottle allowance could change then everything would be perfect. Otherwise great hotel.",5,2015,06,21
36,Easy stay! ,We stayed here prior to boarding a cruise and the night after and enjoyed. They were able to get us in to our room early which was beneficial. Laying by the pool was relaxing. Easy to figure out the train station. Across from the mall. Good location. ,5,2015,06,21
36,"Until they get wifi working, it's 2 stars","This is a conference hotel away from any points of interest. I was there for a conference. But if you bill yourself as a business hotel at 300+ per night you need to have business amenities. Wifi required extra payment - in today's world, where it's basic as hot water, that's obnoxious. But it didn't work. We were on 3rd floor, and at no point could we connect to wifi. Lobby and executive lounge were spotty. Not bring able to work from the room is unacceptable, so if you're here for work, stay somewhere else. Also, the shower drain in our room was slow. ",2,2015,06,21
36,A Hilton,"Everything you'd expect from a Hilton. That said, it was a very nice experience with a great staff and clean rooms. The only complaint is the distance to the city center. A cab will cost around 20 Euro just to get in towards Las Ramblas. It is walkable to the beach, but the beaches near here were nothing to be excited about. There is a city bus tour with a stop just outside the hotel that we used one day which worked very nicely. The hotel has a nice pool and outdoor bar. Also a decent breakfast (at an extra cost) and room service was fine also if you get in a pinch.",4,2015,06,18
36,"A bit boring, but efficient","Stayed here for a conference in May, which is convienent with the Congress center around the corner. The hotel lacks charm, but the property is well maintained and rooms are good. The hotel lobby and bar is nothing special. Pool area was closed.",4,2015,06,18
36,Very average hotel,"For anyone looking to stay in Barcelona don't make the same mistake I did.  
As the hilton chain has a fairly good reputation, we chose to stay there and the description and photos were appealing to us as this was our first visit to Barcelona. 
We arrived there about lunch time and the line for check in was short however took approx 35 min to check in. 
The staff work very slow upon check in and check out where I noticed several guests getting frustrated with them. 
We were told once we arrived that wifi is only available for free in the lobby and that we would have to purchase the wifi for our room which I thought was very disappointing for the Hilton chain. Once we decided to purchase the wifi, there were two options, standard wifi and premium wifi at an addition cost. We purchased the standard wifi as we were in and out of the room and it was dropping out every few minutes. 
The buffet breakfast was below average even for a 3 star hotel. The variety was very limited compared to same priced hotels we have stayed at during our Europe trip and the waitresses removed our plates the minute we finished our meal, making it awkward going back to get another serving. 
The laundry service and housekeeping were up there with the best hotels we have stayed at and the housekeeping employees were very friendly and quick. 
To get to the city you either need to get on the metro or taxi which is about a 10 euro taxi ride and the airport about a 35 euro taxi ride. If you want to explore the city I would advise to stay closer to the City so you can walk to and from your hotel and save the extra euros spent on taxi rides very day. 
The diagonal mar shopping centre is the largest in Barcelona but is nothing special at all. Everything there is pricier then the city and most of the restaurants are tourist traps. 
Out of 10 I gove the Hilton a 5 for location, services and value for money",3,2015,06,17
36,Brief but enjoyable,"The hotel staff was friendly and helpful. The room was nice but not exactly what I thought I was getting. It was on the back side of the hotel and what I was told I had reserved was the front side of the hotel. It was on a higher floor than I had thought it would be and we had a lovely view of the Mediterranean. We were celebrating our 25th Wedding Anniversary and we had a lovely bottle of wine and chocolates in our room with dessert when we arrived. Thanks to Delta we were much later arriving than anticipated so instead of seeing the city, we only had time for dinner. The staff recommended a little Tapas  restaurant down the street within walking distance. It was family owned and lovely. The food was exceptional and we sat outside and enjoyed the evening. The next morning the hotel assisted with getting a cab for us to head to the port. Our room had robes and house shoes. We were able to take the house shoes with us which was great. They were small for travel but comfortable and we wore them every day in our room on the ship. The only free WiFi was in the lobby and the lobby was quite full of people taking advantage of that.",4,2015,06,17
36,"Lovely Hilton hotel, not far from the beach","Had a lovely time at this hotel, one of the better Hilton hotels I've stayed at. 

We arrived quite late in the evening, so nobody was at reception when we arrived. A member of staff quickly arrived though, and check-in was quick and efficient. As Gold HHonors members, we were allocated an executive room which is always a delight, and one of the reasons I remain loyal to the Hilton brand. 

The room was smart and modern, and clean and comfortable, with a nice sea view. We were on the 23rd (top) floor and it was extremely quiet. The air conditioning and opening window meant we could keep the room at a nice temperature, or get fresh air. I was a bit surprised that the complimentary water for HHonors members wasn't in the room - I phoned reception, and they told me to help myself from the minibar. This appeared on the bill at checkout (quickly rectified), so something to watch out for.

The executive lounge is fabulous - quite spacious, with a nice outdoor area with sea views. We had breakfast there, and evening snacks and drinks. Breakfast was a fairly limited buffet, but adequate - cooked items were bacon and scrambled egg. Also a selection of cereals, pastries, toast, bread and continental items. 

The selection of drinks and nibbles in the evening was quite nice, and the atmosphere in the lounge was lovely. It was also nice to note their hours in the evening are 18:00 to 22:00 (snacks finish at 20:00).

The location of the hotel is good - a short walk to the beaches, or the Metro station. The Metro is reliable, fast and frequent, and very cheap. We got the 10 trip ticket for €9.95. The shopping centre opposite the hotel is good, with a huge supermarket and a Primark, and many other shops.

The pool area is very nice, and we were made to feel quite welcome - it is a bit odd that the staff lavish attention on you, but we didn't find any of the 'hard sell' tactics I'd feared. We did go down to the pool late afternoon, and it wasn't too busy, so maybe that's why we found plenty of free sunbeds available.

The couple of negative points - wifi in the room was very unreliable. We had to resort to using wifi only in the public areas. We wanted to check out in the executive lounge as we'd noticed the front desk was extremely busy. Disappointed to find the lounge closed for some cleaning just before midday - I'd have thought that would be a peak time for people checking out, so probably not the best time to close the lounge. Also, the shower water pressure was slightly weaker than I'd like.

However, so many good points, I would love to go back to the hotel one day soon :-).",4,2015,06,17
36,"Nice hotel, however far from city centre","Nice hotel, with good virew to the sea, however no balconny. They have good executive lounge with a terrace with nice view. Rooms are clean, staff is friendly. Hotel is located quite far from city centre. Metro is around 5-10 min walk.",4,2015,06,17
36,Dissapointing,"Firstly we arrive at the hotel and realized we left our daughter’s buggy at the airport so asked for assistance and all they did was write down the airport number which was no use because no one spoke English so my husband had to spend €65 there and back to fetch the buggy, thought they would’ve at least offered to call the airport. We check in and they advise we are in a king bedroom so we check whether there is a bed for our daughter, which there wasn’t so they had to request another bed get sent to the room for her. Once we get to the room the Safe and TV were both not working and we asked 3 times for this to be fixed. The extractor fan in the bathroom was dripping water continuously. One afternoon we returned back to the room which had been cleaned to notice that my daughters teddy bear had been stolen. On another afternoon, after being out all morning we decided to spend the afternoon at the pool, when we got to the pool we were asked if we had a reservation, after I asked why we needed a reservation to use the pool we were advised that there was an event so all the beds were sold and if you wanted to use the pool you had to reserve seats which you had to pay for. He said there’s adverts around the hotel you should’ve seen there was an event. I said surely when you check in you should be told about these things so you can plan accordingly. On our final evening after we all in bed we get a knock on the door at 21:30 in the evening to tell us they could not find our daughter’s teddy bear. For Hilton Hotel I found it quite disappointing, you would expect better service and not have little things happen that ruin parts of your stay. It’s not a hotel that is suited towards families at all. Will definitely not be going back there. 

On a positive note, the breakfast was lovely. It is worth the extra expense. The hotel is located opposite a large shopping centre which had everything so a big positive. The Hop on Hop off bus stop was a 5 minute walk away outside the Princess Hotel. The Tram/Metro were about 10/15 minute walk away. Really quick to get to the city. The beach is about a 10 minute walk away, get’s quite busy on the weekend so make sure to get there early for a good spot. Apart from the reserving a seat issue the pool area is lovely and clean and really efficient.",2,2015,06,16
36,Very average place if you are looking to mix business with pleasure,"The train connectivity is nice and you can get to places easily. But you are limited in terms of things to do if you want to walk around and try things. 

If you there for meetings and no pleasure this is not a bad place

I recommend staying at one of the hotels in La Rambla and taking the train for meetings ",3,2015,06,15
36,Amazing,"Stayed here with kids.
Nice, modern property with good sized corporate rooms. clean and comfortable. 
The breakfast was exquisite as one would expect, true Hilton  standards. The beach was a stone throw away. Right infront of the hotel was a shopping center- excellent choice of resturants and good shopping, with a large supermarket inside. 
Also the metro stop wasn't too far, 5 min walk. The place surrounding was tranquil and pleaseant, kept well and certainly made it for kids. 
Metro ride 15 mins to center. nearby zoo 2 stops (I think).

taxi ride to hotel 35euros

Overall a good stay and will definitely be back!!",5,2015,06,14
36,Lovely hotel away from the tourism!,"We completed a wonderful Mediterranean cruise in Barcelona. Absolutely love this city,so wanted to stay a couple extra days. We chose this hotel because we wanted to use hiltonhonors points, but it turned out to be a great decision! Nice,clean,modern hotel,in the business district. We were upgraded to a lovely suite on the 21st floor! Sea views all around. There is a beautiful pool,but unfortunately we did not have time to partake. Executive lounge was great, with a rooftop view and outside eating area. Staff was very attentive at the lounge, food and drinks also good. Easy to get around. Metro stop and Hop on Hop off stop are both about a block away. Cabs plentiful and reasonably priced. Would definitely stay here again!",5,2015,06,13
36,Appropriate for business meetings,"Stayed at this hotel for a business meeting. There is a huge conference room and several small meeting rooms, that are well equiped for the purpose. Although we were warned in advance of the posibility, i found it to be a bit too chilly for me.
Rooms are clean and quiet. However, one of the days the wardrobe smelled quiet intensely of cigarette smoke, which i did not like. Also i think a pipe was leaking as the ceiling near one of the fire sprinklers was moist and bulky and paint started falling off. Wifi is fast and reliable, free wifi in the public areas did not connect at all.
Hotel is nice, staff is polite and very helpful. There was some miscommunication with reservations between the hotel staff and meeting organiser, which left us the guests puzzled for a while, but in the end it all got sorted out. 
Did not get a chance to try out the pool area. 
All in all, location was well picked for the meeting and would recommend for this purpose. Cannot speak about leisure travel though.",4,2015,06,13
36,Very good stay,"The rooms are big and quiet. 

The gym is small, but well equipped: shame that it was too hot due to the a/c not working properly.

Very good outdoor swimming pool.

Very long queues at checkout and checkin due to the little number of workstations: must improve.

Excellent and smiling staff.",4,2015,06,13
36,Thanking Remy. Manager,"I have left positive reviews in the past. 
I'm returning to give Praise to Remy. He's one of the manager's. I am a frequent guest at this particular Hilton.  And Remy went beyond the call of duty.
I'm a musician (saxophone). And I'm always concerned about where to practice. And if I'm bothering anyone.  
Remy found me a place where I could practice in peace.  And not disturb anyone. 
Thank you so much.",5,2015,06,12
36,Fab Hotel shame about Purobeach,"Bad bits:
This was our second stay at this hotel and It’s such a shame they have changed the pool area to Purobeach.
 
Reducing the amount of sunloungers, it’s very ‘pretensious’ and the most annoying part of it is the very loud thumping music played all the time.  We asked and complained about the level of the music on a number of occasions and they only turned the speakers off near us once for 30 minutes.  It was so loud I couldn’t hear my own music and it gave my husband a migraine.  From the Monday to Thursday there really wasn’t many people using the pool area those that did didn’t stay very long.  It’s a bit strange really as it’s not a ‘hip’ hotel to have such an area, it’s full of conference guests, not young party people (well not while we were there).

You get 'jumped' on by staff when you arrive at the pool area and we didn't feel at all welcome, I like to sit where I want to sit & be left alone.  We even took a tea down from the exec room & got told we weren't allowed external drinks (it was from its own hotel!) Constantly being fussed by staff & the third degree when you left.
 
If you don’t want to use the hotel pool, then I would give it 5 out of 5 for a hotel and that' s why it’s hard to only give it 3 stars but they say they have a pool and I expect to be able to use it.
 
We did have a major problem with the shower in the room it was extremely hot or extremely cold.

Limo
We booked the hotel limo back to the airport which should have included mineral water and a daily paper what arrived was a black minibus no water and no paper this was €75 compared to a taxi which was only €35 on arrival.  It really upset my husband that it wasn't a limo & didn't include items as advertised it was just a slightly nicer taxi.  We both felt very let down by this and it spoilt the end to our holiday. We did complain and they have refunded €40 being the difference but really they should have given that for free for the disappointment, it really wasn't as advertised.

The good bits:
We stayed on the 23rd Floor, fab views and I think the extra for the executive room level was worth it for us, we only ate in the lounge once at breakfast but it had everything you would want, drinks, cereal, eggs/bacon and fruit.  Soft drinks during the day and Tea/Coffee then 6-8pm a salad bar with some form of hot offering, bread, cake, and a couple of sandwich items.  They also have alcholoic drinks from 6pm to 10pm like CAVA, wine, some spirits and bear.  We like the quiet of the lounge and being able to sit outside and I guess that’s one of the reasons why we will go back.
 
Breakfast in the main restaurant was very plentiful, it was extremely busy with conference attendees at 7am but we sat outside for some quiet.
 
The hotel was overrun with conference guests but it didn’t bother us at all, just at breakfast time.
 
As for the location of the hotel, we have been to Barcelona before and just wanted a break for some sun, relaxing by the pool/beach and be able to go shopping.
 
We jogged into the centre it’s only about 2 miles and got a tram back using a 10euro travel ticket which two people can use which you stamp and it uses 1 trip per person, for the bus, tram and tube.  There is also a time allowance to swop transport and you don’t use another stamp.  The tram stops outside the Mall across the road.
 
We think it’s a good location, we would go back twice a year if it wasn’t for the pool area.  Now we just need to decide if we want to go to a hotel on the beach or not because we cannot relax by the ppol anymore but we aren’t too keen to go to the beach all day long.  It’s just spoilt the hotel for us.
 
However if you like an lbiza/Miami vibe around the pool you will be very happy, if you want to relax, read a book, go to sleep or even listen to your own music you won’t be happy.
 
I hope they either make a quiet area for people or get rid of the company running the pool then we will go back ASAP.",3,2015,06,11
36,A MIXED EXPERIENCE,"There are many great aspects to this hotel but unfortunately not enough to make me stay again. The actual property is very nice and up to date with good amenities.  The beds are comfortable and rooms are very quiet with great views. The downside to my room was that the shower switched from scorching hot to ice cold every 10 seconds or so and I heard someone else on another floor moan about the same problem! The staff were very nice and helpful although they kept coming up to me every 15 minutes at the pool asking if I wanted anything, even waking me up at one point. There is free wifi in public areas but you have to pay to have it in your room. The location is excellent if you like the beach and is directly opposite a great shopping mall with nice restaurants.",4,2015,06,09
36,Overpriced and Silly Pool Policy,"Stayed in this hotel as a couple on a city break, with the hope of relaxing by the pool for some of the time.
The hotel was very expensive, and we didn't realise that our rate did not include breakfast. Some of the staff were quite abrupt, we were prepared to pay for breakfast but nobody was interested in dealing with our request.
The pool didn't open until 10am and we felt very unwelcome as we were not prepared to pay 50 euros to reserve our sunbeds and were made to feel uncomfortable if we said we wanted to wait for a bed free of charge. You were even harassed by the poolside staff if you just wanted to walk around the pool or bar and dipping your toes in the water was a no go!!
A bit too far from the city for a short break. The beach was nice. If you're there for business it's ideal but not really a good hotel for a holiday/city break.",3,2015,06,08
36,"Clean hotel, good location outside the centre","We stayed in this hotel in May for the skate board street league competition. The hotel is straight opposite a shopping mall with restaurants and shops. The nearest metro stop is about a 10 minutes walk away, it can be quite hard to find at first. This metro takes you into Barcelona. The hotel itself is really clean and my room had a fantastic sea view. The pool looks newly refurbished although we didn't get chance to try it.",5,2015,06,08
36,"Nothing special, not much to complain","The Hilton Diagonal Mar is located between a small shopping centre (Diagonal) and the saside (Mar). I was booked there because of a conference in the near by conference centre (CCIB) and I would guess that most of the guests have the same reason, the hotel is located outside of the city centre and a 30 min walk from the olympic harbour. 
The shopping centre across trhe street allows to buy something to drink to avoid the usual super high minibar cost, unfortenately the minibar is theHilton-typical ""autobilling"" style which does not allow you to use it for your own except of a small box where one can fits in. You also find different kind of restaurants, we tested and liked the italian one on the left side.
The rooms are clean and offer enough space. WLAN is fast and reliable, but if I remember right not automatically free. 
The breakfast is average, nothing special but you will not miss anything.
While I was there the outside pool was closed and under construction which caused also quite some noise and disturbed me when I tried to work in my room. I had a direct view to the pool and between some large buildings I could see the sea, but I would not call that seaview. 

All in all one can discuss if the hotel deserves 4 points here or just 3, in the end it is nothing special but if there is no noise from construction works also not much to complain",4,2015,06,07
36,Lovely hotel but will not return because of pool policy!,"The hotel is lovely and is in a great location. We knew the hotel was far from town but wanted somewhere near the beach with a pool. (Transfer to town was easy, Metro line 4 for 15 mins or a nice bus run -H14 or H16 to plaza Catalunya in 30mins). The Executive club was great with really nice people there looking after you. However the great disapointment was the fact that the pool doesn't open until 10am and you struggle to get a bed and they recommend that to guarantee a bed you pay 25 Euro.
The first day we had no problem and were asked where we wanted to sit. The next day was completely different. We were advised that beds with towels at an angle were reserved for the day and those straight were free. Surprise, surprise - those available were in the shade and all the ones in the sun reserved. We sat at two beds in the shade but saw two beds with straight towels poolside so moved to them but were told that these were premium beds and incurred a surcharge. After protest, the manager gave us two beds free of charge. The next day we were told that none of the beds in the sun were available as they were having 800 people for a Love Brunch but as were checking out 90 mins later, the allowed us to sit in the sun. Even when you got a bed, you get pestered to buy drinks or Purobeach merchandise.
We got to speak with the General Manager but gave up on him as his attitude was that space was limited (due to them selling beds- the charge ties them up for the whole day!!) and you need to pay to guarantee a bed. All we could hear in the Executive Club were people complaining about the pool policy. Seems that they have spent so much money on the Purobeach they need to recover the costs. But the next cost they have will be no repeat business. We booked this hotel while the pool was closed to be converted but I see that the website advises you to pay the charge.
Sadly we will never go back and have complained about this policy to Hilton Honors.
If you are at a convention and expense account, you will love this hotel but if you want a swim before breakfast or a leisurely rest by the pool forget it. And don't bother the General Manger as he doesn't care.
Also gave up trying to access the wifi in public areas. Limited English channels on the TV- No BBC International and CNN not working on channel 7 as advised.",4,2015,06,07
36,Not worth the money,The hotel and personnel are very nice. However and the main reason to give a low rating is the pool policy they have. Although we are paying a high price for the rooms the hotel stink insist to charge an incredible amount of 25 € for using the sun bathing chairs no matter if you use them for 10 min or a day. And they will charge you this everyday. This is ridiculous and I have never experienced such a greedy unfair way to ripping off hotel guests. I won't recommend this hotel not for business nor for private.,1,2015,06,06
36,perfect,"It was a perfect time spent there, the employees were very helpful and friendly. The location was on the sea and very close to ghe beach, the subway stations and the tauristic buses.
The other side of the street you will fins diagonal mall where yoh can make all kinds of shopping you needs and you will find many restaurants and cafes as well. 
The food was good especially the fresh fruits, the overall environment in the hotel was cozy and the rooms were wide and beautiful. 
The pool was small but with a perfect view over the sea. But I didn't try the health club there.
There were a huge conference room with high speed and stable internet connection with many other small meeting rooms.",5,2015,06,05
36,A business/conference hotel- service communication sometimes spotty,"1st time staying at this hotel which was convenient to meetings, nearby amenities (mall, restaurants, city tour bus stop, metro). It is up there in terms of expectation for Hilton quality.  Service is courteous but can be spotty. In my view this comes down to communication with guests.

I arrived on an overnight transatlantic flight so understandably had to wait a bit for room to be readied (which I had paid for and selected ahead of time). I expected that so killed 7 hours working in lobby, visiting mall conveniently across the street, trying to stay awake.  So was pleasantly surprised when I obtained room key slightly before 4pm that apparently they upgraded me to an executive floor room.  Mind you the front desk did not communicate this to me, and I only figured it out on the elevator when had to use the keycard to access the floor.  I am 50% conscious at this point.

The room itself is terrific, great views. I very much appreciated the gesture. But it would be nice if it was communicated it did not include access to the executive lounge. Which I only found out after returning tired from an excursion the following day. Moreover, I was informed by the lounge staff that apparently breakfast was included with my room. That also was not indicated to me when I checked in with the front desk. Had I known that, I would have taken advantage of it and not pursued alternate options. 

So all in all, I like the hotel and the room was great (except for clogged shower drain so one is standing in ankle high water). But as a professional who stays regularly at Hilton properties for biomedical meetings, I'd like to avoid feelings of embarrassment in the future.",4,2015,06,04
36,Excellent hotel near the beach,"We stayed at the Hilton Diagonal Mar for six days in May.  We thought this hotel was excellent.  Rooms are large, in excellent condition and quiet.  Service needs were dealt with quickly and efficiently.  

We chose an executive level room, which was a good decision.  These rooms are on higher floors, and include access to the executive lounge, which offers a continental breakfast, including eggs and bacon, fruit, pastries, meats and cheese.  Late in the afternoon the lounge offers hors d'oeurves and light entrees, along with wine, beer and other alcoholic beverages.  

If you are looking for a comfortable hotel with American style rooms and conveniences, the Hilton Diagonal Mar would be an excellent choice.

The hotel is about two blocks away from the beach, where we spent several evenings at a bar on the sand - an enjoyable way to end a day of sightseeing.  Across the street from the hotel was a large shopping center offering a number of restaurants, ranging from fast food, to nicer places to each, along with a large number of fashion and merchandise stores.

Although we were able to get to the center of town easily by cab, and the hotel is near a metro stop, it is some distance from the center, and cab rides were always more than 10 euros.  

Finally, it should be noted that free wi-fi is only available in the lobby and the executive lounge.  On the plus side, it should be noted that the paid wi-fi is fast and reliable.",5,2015,06,02
36,Very good Hotel and nice stay,"Very good service and friendly people. Reception was fast with check-in and check-out. Nice room with a normal space. Internet however is always a struggle, slow and ipass is not supported.
Nice breakfast. A lot of other facilities which looks very good but no time to make use of it.
Worth to come back.",4,2015,06,02
36,"If the beach and shopping is your thing, this is the best location!",My first time staying at this Hilton in Barcelona and I'm sorry I waited.  Across the street is a 4 story mall with 30+ places to dine.  Everything from Tapas to burgers to Japanese food.  And the beach is visible from the hotel and a mere 5-10 minute walk.  The rooms are spacious and the Executive Lounge is huge when you factor in the outdoor terrace.  The views are great and it's a short 30 minute taxi ride from the airport.  Olympic port is a 10 minute taxi ride or a 25 minute stroll down the beach.,5,2015,06,02
36,"Hilton Diagonal Del Mar, Barcelona","Our stay at the Hilton Diagonal Del Mar, Barcelona was great!    Pros:  Situated only minutes from the Mediteranean, quiet, and shopping mall/dining/movie theater and playground for the kids right across the street.  Also plenty of taxis waiting on the corner.    Cons:  No airport shuttle and taxi rides into the city center can get expensive.  Tip:  For great, resonably priced tapas,  try Tapa Tapa, right next to Las Arenas Barcelone (Barcelona Arena) in Plaza Cataluna.",5,2015,05,31
36,OK business hotel but with issues ...and not well-located for a city-break,"I stayed here as part of a conference.  Rooms are fine in terms of size, furnishings but lack any sense of luxury - rather basic toiletries, no robes, etc.  If your room is high enough (hotel has around 22 floors) views are OK but not wonderful. You see the sea from a sea-view room, but only looking over some scruffy land & buildings in-between. If you're lower down, you're just peering between nearby tower blocks.  What really lets this hotel down are the front desk and elevators - as other reviewers have mentioned, both are inadequate for a hotel of this size catering for large business groups. It's easily possible to wait 10 mins or more for an elevator (it was a widespread complaint among our large conference group) and as there are no indicator signs in the elevator lobbies on the floors, you have no idea if one is anywhere near or on its way. And when one does arrive, it can stop at every floor on the way.  The front desk is just under-staffed and many of the staff seem to be trainees, so anything - checking in/out, dealing with questions etc can take far too long. On the good side, the breakfast buffet was fine, the 2nd floor pool terrace is very nice, and the buffet lunches we were served there were fine.  Location-wise, if you're visiting Barcelona for a city break, you should not consider this hotel as it really too far from the centre and there are much better options at every price level in the historic centre.",3,2015,05,31
36,On the Beach & Great Views,"We stayed 3 nights and enjoyed our stay.  Although some areas of the hotel are starting to show some wear, overall it is very nice, with a good size room and bath.  We enjoyed the executive lounge for breakfast and happy hour, but did not understand why the computers in the executive lounge are not available for free usage. Beach front access is just a 10-minute walk and you can take a long stroll along the beach (clothing optional in some areas).  The Metro Station is just 2 blocks away but if you cross the street and walk straight through the mall, it's a good short cut.  The hotel is not in the heart of the city, but using the Metro yellow line you can be in the city center in about 20 minutes.",4,2015,05,30
36,"Lovely facility, but still","Hotel is pretty new, and public spaces and conference facilities are attractive, rooms are spacious with ocean views, and yet ...

For a higher end business hotel, how can the wifi be so atrocious?  How could a business hotel be so under-elevatored?  Why don't they have a front desk equipped for an influx of business guests?

If this were a destination hotel, I could forgive those service failings, but not for a business hotel near a conference center with large conference space of its own. ",3,2015,05,28
36,Great experience,"Stayed for a long weekend with my girlfriend in a ""junior suite"". Everything was really nice, clean, and in order - no problems whatsoever and the staff was very service minded. Perhaps a bit too many furniture in the room for my taste, but not a problem.",5,2015,05,28
36,OK hotel but very poor service at reception and wifi was a rip off,These days we should expect a modern business hotel to not only offer a decent room with good facilities but with good service and good food. This hotel it disappointing; it only does well because of where it is in relation to the conferencing facilities within Barcelona. Reception took 20 minutes for the smallest question!  Room was OK. Wifi was extra. Food was at best average. Not special in any way. Go elsewhere for better hotels in such a fantastic city! Also a long taxi ride anywhere good!,2,2015,05,27
36,Nice,"Very good hotel , located near sea shore..!
Only problem with internet connection, they do charge for internet if you want to use it in room otherwise it is free in public area
Near by very good shopping center
      
      
      ",5,2015,05,27
36,Short break in the sun,"The hotel is located away from the centre but a stone's throw from the beach. It is a 20 min walk along the promenade to Port Olympic. Taxi to Port Vell/Gothic Quarter approx €9 and the tourist bus stop is almost outside the hotel. Smart, contemporary Hilton hotel and this is our third visit. The new Purobeach swimming pool and outdoor rooftop area is great if you don't mind the monotonous music but sunbeds are comfy and service excellent. Weekends poolside can get busy but we were accommodated on every visit. Would recommend paying extra for access to the Executive Lounge as it has a quiet lounge and 15th floor outdoor seating with good views of Barcelona.",4,2015,05,26
36,Memorable stay. ,Stayed here for my birthday this past summer. Most memorable stay ever. They took really good care of us. They gave us a beautiful suite and gave us great advice about where to hang out etc. Will definitely stay again. I recommend this hotel to anyone that wants quality service without breaking the bank. ,5,2015,05,25
36,The Best Stay,"after a long trip through France, we finished in Barcelona with a stay at this hotel.  Our time here definitely recharged our batteries.  We had connected suites so the kids could stay in their own room.  The rooms were spacious, clean, had great views.  Our bathroom was huge and very luxurious. The beds were very comfortable.  
The staff was overly friendly and attentive, always greeting us upon our return, or talking to our children about their day.
If you are a Hilton Honors member, the Executive Lounge is great.  My family did not want to leave- free WiFi, alcohol, coffee, drinks, snacks, etc.  
The location is close to the beach, which means it is further away from the main area downtown.  The Metro is a 6-8 block walk.  Great Mall across the street, with decent restaurants and a kids play area so parents can eat in peace.",5,2015,05,24
36,Great hospitality but at a not so central location,"My girlfriend and I were here for the weekend to celebrate her birthday. We had a great time in Barcelona and return back to the hotel at midnight. We were very delighted that the hotel arrange a bottle of champagne and a small bday cake for her. 
The hotel is located near the beach and we had a room with seaview overlooking what looks like a rocky beach alongside some industrial area.
",4,2015,05,24
36,Great location and ideal for conference,This is a great hotel. Rooms are clean and well laid out. It is close to the beach and great to take a stroll or run down the beachfront. Great shopping center with restaurants across the road. Staff were friendly and very efficient. Free bottled water for Hilton honors members.,5,2015,05,21
36,"Awful, awful, terrible customer service","If I could give zero stars, I absolutely would. We stayed here at the beginning of May and they had the pool/deck/bar closed for renovations. I understand they need to do this every once in a while, but why not do it in Jan or Feb? We booked months ahead of time and were never informed about this. The front desk staff was snotty, rude, and uninterested. No one tried to help with anything. We wasted hours arguing just to get what we originally booked. Stay at the Princess, it's less expensive and way nicer.",1,2015,05,21
36,happening hotel,"Perfect location! Beach behind the hotel, mall in front of the hotel. What more can you ask for? Easy access to public transport. Hotel rooms are clean, comfy beds, tea/coffee facilities. Wonderful peeps at the executive lounge.",5,2015,05,19
36,Nice stay,"The staff was friendly even I arrived with quite some delay. The breakfast is very good. For the amount of money you spend normally you should expect a bit more comfort, e.g. we did not even have a bath tub - just a shower. Moreover, the room was not even equipped with a bottle of water in the first night. I was a bit disappointed. From my point of view not a 5 star hotel. Moreover, I did not even have a swimming pool.",4,2015,05,19
36,No better way to relax in Barcelona!!!,"The newly opened Purobeach is a triumph. We visited for two days back to back we enjoyed ourselves so much. Its branded as Urban Oasis, that's selling this place short. It should be marketed as an Urban Paradise. The staff genuinely can't do enough for you. The staff genuinely are all excellent and genuinely friendly. 

We visited on the second and third day it was open, and considering that i have to take my hat off to the team. The service was as if they'd worked there for years!!! We ate by the pool on the first day and the restaurant on the second day. Whilst you have to find the energy to walk the 50 metres from the pool to eat at the restaurant the chef's really do thank you for making the effort with modern dishes of international cuisine to die for!!

Simply put if you're looking to relax in Barcelona, look no further!!",5,2015,05,19
36,Great hotel,"Prior to our NCL cruise, stayed three days. We purchased a two day get on-off bus ticket. Across the street is a relatively new shopping mall and great outdoor restaurants.
The hotel personnel were very professional, courteous and helpful. Pool and pool deck under renovation so no swimming.",4,2015,05,18
36,Great hotel,"Second time we've stayed at this hotel, helpful, friendly staff, really quick check in. Room beautifully clean, amazingly comfy bed (as with all Hilton Hotels) The new Purobeach pool area is amazing, wonderful cocktails! Would definitely stay there again.",5,2015,05,18
36,Perfect pampering-comfort all around,"The beds are comfy, the bathrooms modern and large, the lobby bar a nice design, the fitness center one of the better hotel gyms we have ever encountered, and the newly renovated pool area (reopened May 2015) super lux.  Every staff member we encountered was friendly and helpful without exception.  The pool staff pampers you like a 5-star spa resort. There is a mall directly across the street with a movie theater, great shopping options and several good open-air restaurants in addition to the standard mall food options.  (The tapas place that specialized in seafood was fantastic and hard not to return to repeatedly.) There is a metro station close by and taxies are readily available and not super expensive.   Our wifi was included in our room rate but I don't know for sure that it is always included. Would return here time and time again!  Loved our stay!",5,2015,05,17
36,Hilton wins again!,"Prior to our cruise out of Barcelona, we explored the city for about three days. Upon our late arrival, from a very long day of travel, the staff at the Hilton were exceptional. They upgraded our room that I paid for with points to a junior suite, which they didn't have to do.  They gave us great recommendations for our visit and even exchanged our dollars to euro.  Very professional, courteous, and extremely helpful. And, the hotel was beautiful, right on the water.  

When we return, we will definitely stay here again. 

",5,2015,05,17
36,Profesional like in every Hilton! Big room with comfortable bed. Delicious breakfast,"Breakfast is really good also with terrace
Room is nicely cleaned each day and the bed are really comfortable. I had a King Room with sea view - beautiful and big.
Staff during the breakfast,on the reception and pool was very nice . Hotel is only few minutes to the metro station (it takes about 5 stops to the city center) and very close to the beach -also few minutes by walk. Pool and area also very beautiful with a lot of space and sunbeds. Quiet location opposite shopping centre. If i will back to Barcelona of course to Hilton Diagonal Mar. One big minus for Wi-fi- free of charge only in lobby (in the room only for Gold and Diamond HH Member), now it's a standard everywhere free internet.",5,2015,05,17
36,Great location! Awesome staff! Professional in every way!,"Our family really enjoyed the stay at Hilton Diagonal Mar. This brand typically brings in the comforts of home, but it was the staff that made it an even better experience. We've stayed in many Hilton hotels in the past (Dublin, Vienna, and Condado Beach) which offered great service. What makes this hotel unique is the staff. They are the most professional and friendly bunch of people I've ever encountered. You just can't be mad at them even when things go wrong in scheduling, because they handle everything with such ease. Yes, we had a few issues toward the end of our trip that were handled in a very efficient manner. None of that mattered, nor did it ruin our trip. It was quite the opposite. It added to the whole experience. 

I'd like to add that the showers are very good in this hotel (or at least in the rooms that we stayed in). There was a lot of water pressure which is something you don't find very often. You just have to make sure to turn the hand held shower head away from the shower door before you turn on the water. Otherwise, it will spray outside the shower stall and create a slippery mess. Just a minor detail I noticed that is easily fixed. 

We opted to include breakfast in our hotel rate. The breakfast at the Indigo Restaurant in the hotel was very good. They had all the typical breakfast items. They even have churros and hot chocolate, as well as Catalan bread with tomatoes. You can have tapas for breakfast, as they had many wonderful varieties of cheese and sausage. We also liked the Pistaccio Lounge which is also another dining option within the hotel (located in the lobby by the reception area). On many days we would just have dessert and coffee in the evening. Again, the churros and chocolate made it's presence known. What a wonderful treat! You also can't go wrong when ordering the cheesecake. It was so delicious! 

It was just a pleasant experience from beginning to end. Everyone greets you with a smile, and goes out of their way to make sure you're happy. We would pick this hotel again if we ever decide to come back to the beautiful city of Barcelona. It was a great choice and a wonderful location.",5,2015,05,15
36,Superb staff and great location make this a solid choice in Barcelona,I spent 8 nights in Barcelona in April 2015 and stayed here.  The location was great.  i had to attend a conference and the conference center is right next door.  There was a wonderful Flamingo dancing festival by the Mediterranean nightly an easy stroll from the hotel.  The tour buses stop directly in front of the hotel and for 27 euros you can get a daily pass that will take you all over the city with on/off privileges.  It is minutes from the famous church La Segada de la familia and also from Port Olympic which is a fantastic beach filled with restaurants and night clubs.  But the best part was the staff.  Each and every person I encountered was friendly and helpful.  I can't wait to go back!,4,2015,05,14
36,Nice hotel on main street,First time I stay at the Hilton Diagonal. It is conveniently located on one of the main street but it is not located in the touristic old town area. There is however some very good shopping near by. The rooms are nice but don't have much of a view. One interesting architectural point is that they have double floor tall lounges. Their premium lounge is OK but nothing great.,4,2015,05,14
36,"Good, quiet location opposite shopping centre","We have really enjoyed our stay at the Hilton Diagonal Mar in Barcelona. Shame that the pool was closed for renovation during our stay. With three children who love to swim, it was one of the reason for choosing this hotel. We would have appreciated it if Hilton had informed us beforehand (we booked directly at the hotel) and maybe had offered something as compensation. The only thing the receptionist had to say is that the sea was close by. The fact that we could use the pool didn't spoil our stay in Barcelona by any means, but it does feel like a missed opportunity for Hilton.",4,2015,05,14
36,Good Hilton Mediocre Executive Lounge and Gold/Diamond Internet,"For Gold and Diamond members accustomed to complimentary internet be aware they limit access to 3 devices - insufficient if there are 2 people on the reservation and the ""normal"" cell ohone, tablet and computer compliment is used by both people. They will provide additional access,but it took me two trips to the front desk and a bit more aggresive behavior than should have been required.

As for the Executive Lounge, it is a  but lacking. Nice space, but the hot component, be it breakfast (eggs) or evening ""snacks"" are not even close to being warm and the bacon floated in so much grease it was next to impossible to pick up with tongd much less keep from sliding off the plate.

The location is good - close to the beach and conveniently located across the street from a modern shopping mall and about 3 blocks from the subway system.

I would not choose this Hilton property again without checking out the other Hilton propeties in the city.

Oh, one more comment about the Executive Lounge, While they do offer complimentary beer, wine and spirits as do the other Executive Lounges we have enjoyed in Europe, in the spirits department, if you don't drink, scotch, gin, vodka or rum, you are out of luck.",4,2015,05,12
36,6 Day Visit Prior to Med Cruise,"Conveniently located hotel to things in the city.  It is right on Diagonal Av.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  Most speak multiple languages, which helps at times.  The recommendations for places to eat were excellent.  I cannot wait to return here.  The rooms are a bit on the small size compared to other Hiltons.  I understand that the other Hilton here in Barcelona has larger rooms and also a pool.",5,2015,05,11
36,Good Hilton Hotel,"Standard Hilton, so if you want a typical Barcelona hotel, choose another hotel.
Had our company kick-off meeting here. Staff very helpful. Food was fine, cold food better than the hot (like many hotels imho). Nice outside terrace for breakfast.
Good location by the beach adjacent to the congress centre.
Only downside was the pool being closed. Very comfortable beds.",4,2015,05,10
36,Business trip,"One that travels FREQUENTLY.  Lovely business hotel, nice comfortable rooms, great wi-fi connection.  Perfect for access to the CCIB - I was there for a site visit.  Stayed here a few times and would recommend for business.  Opposite one of the main shopping centres which has shops and restaurants and a starbucks for the USA contingency....

Stayed in quite a few hotels in Barcelona and this one is fine for business use.

Meeting space is functional and has a good variety.  

Breakfast - great variety

Now they are adding Purobeach to the hotel I'm sure it will be very popular with the swanky crowd (they have Purobeach at the Conrad Hilton where i've stayed a week after it opened), I just hope the staff are pretentious and don't love themselves like half of the staff do at the Purobeach Conrad Hilton

Access to airport - approx 30 mins away pending traffic - approx 35 euros in cost.",4,2015,05,10
36,"Well located comfortable hotel, excellent service.","We visited for a long weekend in May and found the hotel overall very good, with the staff service outstanding.

We appreciated after arriving on an early flight that we could check into our room, have a quick breakfast before heading out for sight-seeing.

The hotel is located close to the water and within metro reach of the main city, with a station a few minutes walk from the hotel. The bedroom was clean, reasonably up to date and quiet. 

At breakfast, there was a wide choice, well laid out, on some days a little noisy and busy, but overall very good. 

All staff we come into contact with were friendly and professional and very helpful and we were very impressed with this and appreciated it - the staff helped make the stay very enjoyable.

One negative is the insistence of Hilton on charging wifi in bedrooms - the free use restricted to common areas was irritating and required entry of a long code each time and for this, the review loses one star. Otherwise, a great hotel and very enjoyable stay.",4,2015,05,09
36,Re: Leisure break at the Hilton for my wife's birthday.,"I advised the Hilton Customer Service team at the Hilton that this was a special break for my wife's birthday, but nothing was laid on in the room on arrival, which was a shame. The staff are fantastic, but there are a few basic errors:
a. In the Executive room - you are only allowed two free bottles of water per stay, which is crazy as they want to charge you 5.50 euros per bottle.
b.The hot food in the Exec lounge at night is not good & is often cold & lacks imagination on the part of the chef.
c.Internet is only free in the foyer,but not in the Exec lounge.
d. As with many Hilton hotels - trying to get a medium to well done steak is almost possible, but otherwise the food in the main restaurant is excellent.",5,2015,05,05
36,Best All Around Hotel in Barcelona; the Staff Makes it GREAT!,"My wife and mother-in-law were visiting Barcelona on vacation, which included three days/nights to see the city pre-cruise and one day/night post-cruise. I have traveled to 29 countries and when traveling on leisure, I am very thorough and try to be very discerning in my search and selection of hotels. Based on past experience, I have come to seek Hilton brands out, especially those outside of the USA because of their quality amenities that are what my family and I are used to, and reasonable prices. After all, while we enjoy experiencing different places, at the end of the day, we don’t like new and exciting adventures within our hotel room--we Iook for places that have familiar sized beds, comparable showers, and food selections that bring some familiarity (if needed) after a day of trying new things out and about.  We looked at several hotels in Barcelona, reading many Tripadvisor reviews for each, and chose this specific hotel for a few reasons. First, it is a four-star plus hotel that offers view of the Mediterranean Sea and beautiful city of Barcelona.  Second, it was right across the street from a major shopping mall, very convenient for picking up basic items and our research showed there are some very nice Spanish restaurants there, particularly for local favorites. Third, the price was right, with a pre-paid rate that included breakfast. What kept me looking elsewhere initially were reviews that said it wasn’t in the Las Ramblas area (which I thought was important at first), and what kept bringing me back to this Hilton was learning what else was at this location, and comparing all factors to hotels closer to the Las Ramblas “tourist action.”  I’ll get into all of this later.  So I paid for two “King Hilton Sea View” rooms and requested in my comments an early check-in, high floor, and two rooms right next to each other so we could attend to my elderly mother-in-law. She is (happily) very cautious about security and won’t sleep at all if my wife and I are not nearby, and we also won’t rest well if we know she’s not comfortable.  I can say most all hotels are good with understanding this concern, but Hilton has always come through, which factored into our visit here. As we finalized our itineraries to visit Barcelona and the surrounding area, I emailed the hotel with a few questions about times/locations of hotel amenities, such as when breakfast starts. Jordi, an employee, very promptly responded with very helpful information.  Two days before our arrival to Barcelona, I emailed the hotel again and emphasized the requests for two close-by rooms, high floor, early check-in (flight arrival at 9:40 am, normal check-in 4 pm).  I was given a warm welcome by Cecilia (a front office supervisor) via return email and her assurance the hotel would try to accommodate my requests, but could not guarantee them. This is a common and understandable answer but she was clear they have taken note of our requests. When we arrived about 11:00 on check-in day, Monica, working at the front desk at the time, seemed to be expecting us; and when I presented my reservation and name, without hesitation she said one room was ready and the other would be ready in 30 minutes. She did offer that if we wanted two rooms exactly together, a “twin” would be best, and learning how the rooms in that hotel are arranged (after I made the reservation), we’d already decided before arrival if a King Sea View and Twin Sea View were offered, that combination would be just fine, given my mother-in-law (a small-sized lady) has just a double bed at home.  The rooms they put us in were simply awesome; exactly as requested on a high (17th of 23 total) floor, and one room was a corner room that had both a sea and spectacular city view. We also had a special third door that closed off both rooms from the rest of the hallway/floor, offering my mother-in-law an additional sense of security. Now, there was also a conference starting and many people were checking in for it, so the place was very busy, but each time I went through the lobby, the staff was cheerful and greeted us, often by name.  Maribel, a front desk supervisor, even offered to make copy of my passport to have handy to use while we explored the city, suggesting the original be locked in the safe. The Indigo Restaurant staff (breakfast) was superb, and the breakfast buffet was very well done. They treated my mother-in-law like she was their own mother, and were always courteous and attentive, checking to ensure we were comfortable with all we needed. The Pistachio bar (Lobby) Staff was equally superb. They were very friendly and offered a lot of information about their city and were very conversational as well. The service and food (we had tapas, dessert, and various coffees) were also excellent!  Francisco, whom I believe was one of the several bell captains, was also helpful and efficient and very pleasant to talk to. He promptly arranged taxis, bag pickups, and was always pleasant.  While I mention several specific people above, there were many others who also did such an outstanding job, so this is not to leave them out—everyone we interacted with were outstanding, and the main point here is the hotel staff clearly went out of their way to meet our requests and make our stay very pleasant. Without question there is an emphasis by management on providing a high level of service, higher even than at other Hilton hotels in which we’ve stayed.  But there is more. We planned to return from our cruise to stay one last night before our long flight home, and I realized check-in at 8 am would be hard to do, so I called the hotel from a cruise port stop the day before to extend our existing reservation to include one extra night. I was apparently forwarded to central reservations, but nonetheless a night was tacked on, and I was sent the confirmation via email. The second night had been pre-paid months ago, and I was told I would just need to pay for the extra night added, and that notes in the itinerary would explain all that, to include keeping the same room for both nights. However, upon arrival for our final second and final stay of the trip, I was met by Maria at the front desk who told me there was only one day on the new reservation, though she did see the previous prepaid reservation as well. I showed her the new confirmation email and she checked the hotel’s own records—then disappeared to the back office for a short time. She emerged to offer us complimentary upgrades to the executive floor (21st floor) and checked us in immediately--now about 8 am. The main point here is that while any business is rarely perfect, this hotel quickly recognized a central reservations problem and fixed it without any inconvenience to us at all, actually even (technically) providing better accommodations than we’d anticipated. Now THAT is the mark of outstanding customer service and superb professional competence in the business. And once again, Monaca, Maribel, Francisco, now Maria, and others took great care of us, making our final (short) stay in Barcelona very pleasant.  Now I want to address what I learned and make some recommendations/comments based on our stay at this specific hotel. First, there are not (to my knowledge) “King Hilton Deluxe” rooms here (slightly bigger rooms than a regular King Hilton room), and having stayed in both “King Hilton” and “King Hilton Executive,” the executive rooms don’t seem to be any larger.  Of course, I did notice the main differences were higher floors, executive lounge access (with free drinks and tapas 6pm-10pm), bath robes, and wood laminate floors. The executive floors are 15, and 19-21, with the lounge on 15, and floors 17-18 are regular room floors, where we stayed the first time. The rooms on floors 17-18 had the same gorgeous views without the extra money, and we found the carpet really to be better than the wood floors because they very well attenuated the sound. In the executive room we noted the wood floors amplified noises that would never be heard in carpeted rooms. We heard (and maybe others heard ours) rolling of suitcases, shoes dropping, phone/personal conversations, television, etc.  I often choose the executive floors when traveling depending on where I’m staying and what’s nearby, but for this location, there are plenty of places for tapas right across the street and in the lobby bar. While they are not free like in the lounge, they are reasonably priced and of very high quality, frankly, likely better than what the executive lounge serves in any hotel. Of course, if you are really into happy hour with free drinks, the executive rooms might be for you. For the lobby bar, any of the coffees are outstanding; there is no need to go out for coffee at all. For the ladies, you will absolutely love the churros and evil-rich hot chocolate. These were the most amazing treats from our trip (and we had quite a few wonderful treats), and the young lady who served the churros and hot chocolate seemed to intuitive know how good these were too, as she came around a couple of times to get our thoughts, as if knowing we’d be impressed, and she was clearly pleased we enjoyed them. I also highly recommend Casa Carmen right across the street for tapas and/or dinner, but that’s another review I will write. Nonetheless, just an example of what’s nearby this hotel. Also, there is a carnival and of course, the beach, right across the street. Back to my recommendation for this specific hotel, I would recommend some local private or group tours of the city and surrounding areas, which would include a visit to Las Ramblas (touristy/shopping/nightlife area) and suggest that you stay in the Las Ramblas area only if you are into a heavy nightlife and late night noise on the streets outside your hotel is no bother. Our tour guide took us there and we saw it for ourselves, but he suggested the location and activities, while historical, is not really Barcelona or Spain now at all. Without question, this hotel was a perfect choice for us, made so mostly due to the great staff, with all the other comforts and conveniences there as well. I leave you with this: So many times I have stayed in hotels where if a staff was average or just good, I still recommended the hotel because of the good location/facilities. But this is a hotel where all the facilities are still quite good as we expect, but the staff at every level is what makes Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona GREAT!",5,2015,05,05
36,Guaranteed comfort and good service during business trip,As at most of Hilton hotels you will find high level service and very professional attitude here. The breakfast buffet is   a must - delicious food and nice ambience. I enjoyed the view from the room as well as the nice lobby area. The only thing I missed was the spa (being closed at the during my stay).,5,2015,05,05
36,Internet was not working and the manager was ignoring me and my problem,"The Internet at my room did not work for my entire stay. I was told by the front desk that I can work at the lounge. Really?  Is this is the Hilton way of treating its members?  Even I was offered to change my room but the same problem happened at another room.  It seems like that the management at this Hilton failed to monitor their overall performance.  I was staying at the top, 23rd floor which I was told that is mainly for HHonors members. How they can say they treat their HHonors members seriously?  They do not even know their Internet was not working at all!
I have been complaining about the Internet was not working but there was no help offered by the staff.  They only transferred my phone to the support call center.  I knew there was a manager on duty as I saw him at the lounge saying sorry to another guests for the same problem but he just ignored me and my problem.  I might only a Gold member not the Diamond member and that's why I was not as important as that other guest he was ignoring me and my problem.",1,2015,05,05
36,Wonderful Hotel and staff all around,"Just returned from our first time in Barcelona and had the opportunity to stay at the Hilton Diagonal Mar. We are Hilton Honors gold members and were made to feel very welcomed. Had a problem with Wi Fi in our upgraded room and was upgraded to suite with Cava and fruit platter from the manager! Beautiful views and close to Metro.Only downside was the pool and deck area was under renovation so unable to sit out there.
Highly recommend not only for the great location- views of water and also the city, but for the lovely physical space and professional staff.",5,2015,05,02
36,Nice and convenience hotel for business,"That's nice hotel and fool location for business and good loung and clean with nice staff
Thanks you. It's near convention center and I was staying in that hotel for congress of radiation oncology .and every day I went to congress by 2 minute walk and return",5,2015,05,01
36,Good all round hotel,"Stayed for one week on a sight seeing holiday with my husband and son.  Being a Gold member, we were upgraded to a high floor, with use of the executive lounge.  Lovely view from the outdoor terrace and room, overlooking Sagrada Familia and the sea. The location is further out of the city centre, but we enjoyed the peace  and yet could hop on any type of transport .  Sightseeing tour bus on the corner, taxis on other corner, metro across road, tram along street and local bus stops all around.  Travel is cheap and plentiful, so yes if you want the biz, this is not the hotel, but it was perfect for us.  The room was huge and also had a setee and desk, big window and very bright.  The lounge was open all day for soft drinks and coffees and  from 6-8 served taps along with a variety of alcohol until 10!  Barcelona is amazing and the hotel was well placed for all our needs, including the mall across the road when we were too tired to head into the centre for dinner,  Good variety of shops and the food was fine.
I would definitely recommend Hilton Diagonal Mar and Barcelona for a cultural trip. The hotel staff are very helpful and informative, also very pleasant.  We also managed to watch Barcelona FC win two matches...........  terrific atmosphere. But the highlight of our trip was Sagrada Familia -  a must to see!!! . Hopefully we will be back and if so, we will book The Hilton Diagonal Mar.",5,2015,05,01
36,Wonderful,"This is a new facility. It is a bit out of the center of the City but only a short Metro ride. The Metro is worth taking, new and very efficient. The staff were excellent. Check-in, check-out and supplying extra pillows for us very quickly. The restaurant is outstanding, really outstanding. Bruno and Emmanuelle looked after us. Perfect. Courteous, explained the dishes and made recommendations. The Chef has an excellent Tapas menu. You should eat at Indigo and try it. You will not be disappointed. The location is nice, only a short walk to the ocean. We very much hope we can stay there again. We stress, the restaurant, Indigo is tops. We have been at 3* Michelin places in France and this ranks with the best. You will not be disappointed in any respect at this hotel.",5,2015,05,01
36,Nice hotel but why put it there?,"There is nothing to complain about with this hotel except the prices[small coke-6 eurosand wi fi-25euros per day] but there is nothing really to enthuse you about it. The staff are efficient and polite but they seem to stay aloof from you so that you never actually warm to them, the buffet breakfast is satisfactory, but nothing to write home about and I have no idea why they stuck it in the middle of nowhere. We were on the 17th floor which left me a little uncomfortable but it did provide excellent views of part of Barcelona. There is a fair sized mall across the road with a couple of good restaurants on the top deck but after that there is nothing else nearby. Caught the train into the city but you have to go in a big loop to get back and the locals grasp of english was not up to offering under standable directions so 25euros in a taxi to get back. Very good swimming pool but the gentleman next to us fell asleep and when he woke up clothes, phone and wallet were gone and we didn't see a thing. Rooms were spotless, air con worked, bar fridge worked,everything was okay but at 400Aud a night it just did not quite make it.",4,2015,04,28
36,"Very nice: great hotel, near the subway, but far from attractions","It's the standard expected Hilton quality: great. The continental breakfast is amazing: including the ""best"" thing from Barcelona: the ""jamon"". It's in front of a shopping center, with good dining options, and a couple of blocks away from the nearest subway station. I've stayed in a high floor room, and the view of the ocean and the city was superb.",5,2015,04,27
36,A little outside of Gothic Barcelona but nice,"We stayed here in June of 2014, nice overall place and the staff was great.  With that said there was a strange odor that was noticeable each time we wen to the pool.  To get to the main sight seeing stretch with in the city we preferred the taxi vs the light rail (light rail just took too long)",4,2015,04,26
36,Average stay,"We stayed at the Hilton for a business convention. Check in was interesting. The taxis can not pull up to the front of the hotel. The bellman did come out to help us with our luggage. 
We checked in on line, so our room was ready. It was a nice room with a view of the sea. 
We had a very hard time using the wifi connection. We spent a lot of time with iBahn to get us connected. 
The pool was closed for maintenance. 
The facility was nice. 
Check out was terrible. It took forever to get my bill. They had a few extra charges on the bill that they agreed to take off. 
There is a nice mall across the street with good shopping and restaurants. 
The staff was friendly. 
I just was not real impressed with the hotel. I stay in too many hotels, so I know when a hotel is good or bad. This Hilton was average at best. 
",3,2015,04,25
36,Conference - Event,Quality of services was excellent. Rooms were clean and to usual Hilton standard Bar staff always friendly and fluent in English. Conference facilities were excellent. Some issues with internet speed due to large group. Hotel worked well with our external suppliers in organising the event and setting up the venue.,4,2015,04,23
36,"Ordinary, bad value","There is nothing remarkable about this property. I was not impressed with the gym (tiny), the pool (under construction) or the value (272 euro for a non bfast, non wifi, ordinary room is way too much). There is also nothing super wrong with it. Reception staff were efficient enough. Room service was too pricey for what it was but came swiftly with a smile. Wouldn't recommend. ",3,2015,04,23
36,Overpriced,"Extremely low quality toiletries, jobs being done in the room while resting, slow hair dryer, not very flexible staff. The hotel is way overpriced for the service they provide. Will no go back to this hotel.",2,2015,04,23
36,"Actually an ideal location, despite what others may say","For Shah, location is everything. He loves to be in the midst of things, of people, of excitement, even of noise. That's just the kind o' guy he is. So, with some hesitation, he booked a hotel a bit outside of the city centre (center, for you yanks). And it worked out; here's why.

Barcelona has many great neighbourhoods, so it's hard to choose the right one for most people. Yes, the old city is not a bad area but does get noisy and can feel cramped for people who sort of like to spread out. The advantage of this hotel is that it's very close to the metro (TMB) which whisks you right into the midst of everything in 15 minutes, with trains running every 3-4 minutes. You can walk through a shopping mall just across the street to the other side to get to the subway. There's also a tram by the way which will take you to many other places as well.

Another great thing — the hop-on, hop-off bus has a stop just down the road from the hotel. If there is one city where this bus is great, it's Barcelona. Shah highly recommends taking a two-day pass to nicely explore this great city.

Now about the hotel. Well, it's a Hilton so everything is up to standard -- the service, decor, room, etc. Only thing they really need to fix is the Internet -- sooooo slow. Kids will scream coz they can't stream. Ask for a room facing the sea. There's a beach nearby but hopefully you didn't come to Barcelona to go to a beach!

Shah Rukh says: Barcelona is a safe city, but beware of pickpocketers (?) in the subways, especially in busy areas. This is a common problem.

Shah Rukh's tip: For excellent food selection, take the metro to Barceloneta station and just walk down the strip. Very good choices in paella at very reasonable prices. Avoid Las Ramblas for food, though there are many small places that are funky and reasonable in the old city.

Complimentary extra tip: For a really fantastic day trip that the kids will love, go to Montserrat. But don't fall for the tour bus thing. They take you to a big parking lot near the mountain where you have to take the funicular. It's very easy to just take the train from Espanya station right to Montserrat and hop on the same funicular. Cheaper and more fun. Monterserrat is amazing, but Shah is too tired to type more ...",4,2015,04,21
36,Great location lovely staff,"Thoroughly enjoyed visiting this hotel. Staff were so friendly, they couldn't do enough for you. The food also in the hotels restaurants and bars were delicious, with friendly waiters happy to change/deviate from the menu and making suggestions. I intend to revisit this time with my family as I was on business. Thank you for a great trip",5,2015,04,20
36,Very good hotel,"This hotel is not unique or terrific - it's simply very good and that's enough for any trip and especially a business one. it is close to the convention center.
Location is a bit far from the city center but there is a metro 5 minutes walk.
Breakfast is great and Wi-Fi very fast.
Rooms are good sized and clean.
High floors give beautiful view.
Staff very helpful.
It's very close to the DIAGONAL shopping center and in it you will find Primark which is a very famous store for good quality and good priced clothes.",5,2015,04,19
36,Excellent service but badly underwhelmed by staff standards.,"Being a diamond Hilton member will make me head to these hotels by default - for the most part, one tends to be recognised as such and offered the privileges of diamond membership, on the other side, there's the..standards. 
I've stayed at all the Hilton properties in Barcelona, and to be quite honest the Diagonal Mar stands out as the one closest to what I would define as impeccable service... Their staff DO try, but they also are not able to go far enough to accommodate exceptional circumstances. As one of them in a full lobby put it ""look around you, we have more choices in customers than you have hotels"" 
...Sadly, this is the standard one does have to contend with these days. Acknowledging a mistake by laundry for example, is like extracting a tooth - includes but is not limited to - a visit by the housekeeping manager to tell you simply ""no, sorry, your shirt was damaged BEFORE you gave it to us "" and if you don't like it, jump into the sea and drink it all up!  ... Well, if you ever made a point of packing damaged clothes to fly across continents so that you can blame some laundromat for the sake of it .... You know what to do now! 
With that being said, I have to be fair in my review and tell you that the service is, generally, VERY good at this hotel - if your expectations and theirs match the same levels. For most travellers, this will be the case. 
Checkin for example is quite good. The reception desks are quite large and will absorb any incoming large groups fluidly and with ease, they have four gigantic elevators in the building and I don't recall having to wait for an elevator, even during peak traffic movement through the building. They also have a very big parking lot as well as very good Valet service (I recommend you use it, it is worthwhile but beware, parking is NOT free) - they did not fail to take good care of our cars during our stay there, plus they will meet you outside the hotel door to help you with your luggage, and take your car into the parking. It is worth it if you have travelled a long distance before arriving at this hotel. 
The diagonal mar area is a very clean and organised area. As most other visitors will tell you there's a large conference center nearby so most visitors to the local hotels will be attendees of conferences there. What this means is that the hotel service will excel in areas geared up towards such situations - large lunches ? no problem ! mass transit ? no problem ! large meeting areas ? check ! huge after-conference party ? certainly ! and if you're planning to go there for the numbers - yes it is definitely the right place to go. 
The individuality of the service there is lacking, and to get it you really do have to get the attention of one member of staff and stick with it, otherwise you will get lost in the flow of hundreds of other people flowing in and out of this hotel. For instance, we want to offer a very special thank you to concierge Jordi in that hotel for going well beyond the call of duty not only to recommend awesome restaurants as per our requests - not only to book us there, call us a taxi to take us there, but to also call us during our visit to those places to make sure they were taking good care of us... A very big thank you Jordi ! We only wish they had more people like you, because... whenever we asked their other colleagues for help, we got blank stares like we had just fallen out of the 10th floor .... 
The rooms are also very clean, and well organised, but while the furniture is a bit dated, it is quite comfortable and very easy to use. I really have to thank their maintenance for the quick response to the water leak in the bathroom - it was fixed in under 15 minutes and rechecked twice after... Again the efforts of individuals ! So thank you again for that... 
...On the other hand, as is the situation in many large buildings, the air quality in the lower floors leaves a bit to be desired. We had to ask a number of times for the windows to be opened to the point which we had to get a room move because the air was just getting too wheezy - our room move was accommodated - for this we thank you, but we hope that the air system gets recycled some more... It would help. 
Of particular note - room service. What can I say ? WOW - I've never eaten better or juicier burgers or better prepared risotto or soups - they are very good ! prepared by the staff wonderfully ! 
Interestingly, despite its size, catering to the rooms was extremely consistent, we were there during one of the busiest seasons of the year and the food always arrived in under the time stipulated by the staff (when you talk to them they will tell you it will arrive in 20 minutes and by 15 minutes you get the knock telling you your dinner is ready)... Very interesting indeed :) 
The restaurants are very good, the staff interactive but the menus are kind of small. I do recommend their custom dishes and they excel in catalan cuisine - so, if you've ever wanted to taste their catalan cream or fish dishes - ask them ! they'll make it quite well :) 
A very nice touch was the catalan sweets placed in the room as a welcome present - and the friendliness of the front office manager when resolving our complaints regarding air quality. Thank you so much for that guys. 
I do recommend this hotel, very highly to anyone looking to come to Barcelona. The spaciousness is very well utilised and the sea view rooms are well worth the rate. Once the individuality comes back - I'll definitely be there more ! 
So, thanks for all your good work guys.",4,2015,04,18
36,Great business hotel,"Stayed here for a convention and it was really great.  Hotel service was excellent, very helpful, everyone spoke English.  menu in restaurant was very diverse.  Right across for a shopping mall so if you forget anything they have everything.  Many restaurants near by and the beach",5,2015,04,17
36,Brand consistency ,Stayed here recently for a conference. Modern well appointed hotel. Room was clean and spacious but needed a little maintenance. Excellent breakfast. Wifi in public areas. The area is a bit out of town and directly across the road from a large shopping centre with a wide range of shops. Unfortunately the area itself is not the most attractive. So perfect for business but maybe not the place to explore Barcelona from. However I would definitely return which to me is a positive review ! ,3,2015,04,17
36,A good confererence hotel,"A modern, typical Hilton hotel next to the Convention Centre and really good for the business travellers attending company meetings and conventions.
Having said that, there were many holiday guests as well.
It is situated on the very northern edge of the city, about 200m from the beach. A long way from the city's attractions. You can walk into town - a good 30-40 minute walk. Along the seafront is wonderful. You can also take the tram - about 15 minutes. The on/off tourist buses stop near the hotel ( the furthest out they come and only from March to October) and is also an interesting way to get into and around the city.
It is a large hotel , comfortable and extremely well maintained. Breakfast was average serving a full range of options.
One flaw for me was the television channels. For English speakers, there is virutally no choice. Other than news channels and national geographic. No sports or entertainment. German speakers have 2 entertainment channels.",3,2015,04,14
36,Holiday at Hilton,"Had visited Barcelona just after christmas day , we were booked in Hilton for three days. The hotel was very inviting, polite and helpful staff .the rooms very comfortable and excellent service.
Not much for the view, ours was the city view.
But the location was very convinient , right next to the Mall. We had a superb stay!",4,2015,04,14
36,Excellent Hotel,"We satyed here for 3 night, staff were extremly helpful and friendly and I am not really sure why some people giving them a bad rating.Excellent service by the bell man, when we got to the room, the lugages were already in the room while we were checking in. We stayed on the 20th floor and had access to the executive lounge.Our room was spacious enough for 3 of us. Staff at the executive lounge were so friendly and helpful specially Lea who helped us to book 2 days tour and Lorena who was so caring and frriendly. Beautiful view at the executive loung, good breakfast and Happy hour at the executive lounge.
The only thing that made us disappointed was the tapas were not enough through out the happy hour. Usually no snacks and tapas After 8:00 pm although the lounge was open until 10:00pm.",5,2015,04,12
36,Eperience,As everything has been mentioned earlier in the survey quite adequately I find this requirement of having to write 200 words very unnecessary and irritating. I really feel like leaving the survey incomplete and not submit it at all. Most of the joy of the stay and filling in the previous sections of the survey has been totally destroyed by this compulsion to write against my will.,5,2015,04,08
36,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona,"Beautiful facility, worst customer service experience I've received by a Hilton thus far. I've received better customer service at Motel 6 than at this facility. Outside the facility smelled like a sewer. Trying to leave the parking garage was a constant headache. Really not much as far as sight seeing to do nearby. Taxi's to go anywhere from the facility are ridiculous expensive. Would have much rather spent another day in Paris or Rome instead of wasting my time trying to enjoy Barcelona in a facility that treats Hilton Honors Gold members with such low standards. I am so disappointed in the quality of service especially since it was such a beautiful facility.",2,2015,04,08
36,Great View & Great Lounge!,"This Hilton features a magnificent view of the Mediterranean Sea.  Too bad it was too cold to swim there now.  Food and drinks at the executive lounge were great.  When I return,  I'll definitely use the outside pool!",4,2015,04,07
36,Amazing,"Stayed here for two nights. This is an amazing hotel. The room was spacious and very beautiful. The view from my room was stunning. Bed was very comfy. Breakfast was excellent. Staff are very good. Immaculately clean hotel. A/c was very efficient. This hotel is opposite a very big mall so shopping was easy. The stunning view of the sea was mesmerising.
Would return with family.",5,2015,04,07
36,"Hilton Gold Member, Honest Review","I loved this part of Barcelona, we 8 train tickets (journey) at the airport 8 euros and this is the total we paid return for 2 of us, we got the Renfe train for 20 mins then changed to the yellow line for a further 20 mins, easy. On leaving the station you walk through the huge shopping Centre and you cant miss the Hilton. Its next to immaculate beaches and fantastic restaurants, 6 euros for a litre of wine or Sangria, 10 euro for a lovely meal, you cant go wrong. Its a 20 minute walk to the fantastic Olympic marina, it was just perfect, also the Barcelona sight seeing tour bus goes from outside the hotel.

The Hotel - Well its lovely modern, similar to Manchester Deansgate, lovely executive lounge with outdoor seating area, rooms are very clean with modern bathrooms. The Customer service is fantastic, it has to be noted, my partner was ill with a cold and they allowed us to keep the room on for a few hours for the late flight, it was no problem at all.

I only have 2 issues, 1 The Swimming pool was closed, although the website says seasonal pool it was really disappointing, we would never have booked a hotel without a pool. The guy on reception said even the Marriot pool next door was closed, however when we walked in the Marriot pool was open (we felt a bit cheated) - Check the pool is open!

2. The Breakfast Buffet - It resembles something like an all inclusive free for all with lack of staff, the food is lovely with plenty of choice but be prepared, you are not shown to the table, we had to wait 10 mins for a coffee, we had dirty tables sat next to us for the entire breakfast, the guy making eggs and omletes has a bad system, we waited 30 minutes for them , the pancakes were burnt black and disguised in icing sugar... Be prepared! Its organised Chaos!

The bar is lovely in the hotel but completely lacks atmosphere, we never seen anyone in it, I presume this is Hiltons prices.

The hotel is lovely, the staff are lovely, it does have some issues which the Management need address, this was Easter weekend.

Well worth the trip, will go back",4,2015,04,07
36,Good,Met expectations of Hilton brand. Gym and Swimming pool small. A little bit further from where tourist action area. Breakfast was good but repeated every morning. Some variety would have been good. English newspapers would have been helpful,4,2015,04,06
36,Comfortable,"Cozy hotel, spacious room and oh so comfy bed :) Well appointed bathroom. Staff were helpful. Breakfast was good. Hotel wifi was disappointing. I had to go to their business office just to check out emails, the speed was really terrible.",4,2015,04,06
36,Great Barcelona Hotel,"Very professional staff, extremely helpful, clean hotel, right next to largest shopping center and very accessible to Bus and Trolley stops.  This is one of the best Hiltons I've stayed at, mainly because of the great staff.",5,2015,04,05
36,Good hotel in Barcelona,"A OK standard Hilton just outside Barcelona down town. A part from the awful perfume system in the corridors, a good experience. Still charging for Wifi. Good business center in lobby area with free wifi.",4,2015,04,04
36,Lovely Hilton Hotel in Barcelona,"We chose this hotel as the hotels at the main shopping area were full due to the football Match of the year on 22 March. This hotel was situated next to the Mediterranean sea, but somehow it's the residential part of the beach, you get to enjoy the beach without much crowd. 
It's a standard business class hotel with all the efficiency of Hilton hotel. Breakfast at the club floor was excellent and a great view ! 

Nearby shopping was easy with a giant mall and plenty of cafes and restaurants. You can hop onto the city tour open  top bus to town for more shopping and sight seeing.",4,2015,04,03
36,Great conference facility,"I hosted a global conference at this hotel and was extremely satisfied.  The conference and facilities staff was helpful, friendly, and well organized.  They truly went out of their way to ensure a good experience for my team and my attendees.  Would highly recommend this hotel for a conference.",5,2015,04,03
36,Great Business Hotel,"Wonderful hotel for a business trip will all the key amenities, comfortable rooms and helpful staff.  Easy access to the metro.  Right across the street from a huge mall with tons of choices for dinner and a chance to buy a quick souvenier.",4,2015,03,31
36,Not sure what to say......,"Not sure what to say........but could say Wow, or didn't expect that or that's brilliant. 

3rd time in the Diagonal Mar, special visit this time and made even more special by the kindness of the staff at the Diagonal Mar, just arrived to be met by a personalised cake along with some Fizz. Very nice, this is what counts, thank you so much.",5,2015,03,31
36,A marvelous holiday destination,"My wife and me wanted to take a holiday here again to celebrate our wedding anniversary.  (Previously we had tried self catering and found www.lugaris.com excellent but we wanted an easier holiday this time without shopping and cooking this time so we went back to the Hilton which was more relaxing). We had stayed here before and were reassured on checking with Yollanda Llorca that the hotel still supported a gluten free special diet. (see my earlier review here: http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d559387-r143748713-Hilton_Diagonal_Mar_Barcelona-Barcelona_Catalonia.html). Yollanda made the arrangements for us....special thanks to her.
The hotel exceeded our expectations. We had booked an executive room with sea view. We found it was on floor 21 and presented a marvellous panoramic view over much of the city, (including the iconic Sagrada Famalia). So beautiful to behold in daytime but also spectacular when lit up by night. There is also a fabulous view from the complimentary executive lounge balcony where Tapas were provided - even including special gluten free Tapas, freshly made. Fresh fruit and fruit juices were also always available. 

Staff were highly attentive and very friendly; At our complimentary breakfast..Maria, Rosa and Giovanni Vaccaro took time to chat with us and were dietary knowledgeable. We saw how the hotel was constantly improving in support of special diets; an example is each of the multitude of hot and cold buffet dishes had clear, adjacent labels stating 'gluten free' or 'contains gluten'. ( this was a nice idea since it meant you do not have to ask the chef about each dish..which is otherwise a little embarrassing). Warmed gluten free bread was provided in a sealed package which reassured that no cross contamination could have happened. Clear measures like this were in place to prevent dietary cross contamination and staff were trained in a culture of continual improvement.
We were overjoyed that on learning of our wedding anniversary the staff had created some lovely surprises for us. ( I will not reveal what these were here in case I spoil Your surprises ;o) ).
I have written about the location before - its just great. Its about 25 minutes from the airport by taxi. We chose a private booking with Resorthoppa.com, which was highly competitive and no nonsense. I would recommend them; The price you agree online is the price you pay, irrespective of if the journey takes longer for whatever reason.
Out of the hotel we also discovered a superb gluten free restaurant a pleasant 20 minutes stroll away (see www.ElsPescadores.com.)
In summary, we enjoyed a wonderful time. Thanks go to all the staff who, with discretion, really care about any dietary concerns and the overall happiness of customers. This is what makes The Hilton Diagonal Mar so special to us. We hope this review helps you...",5,2015,03,27
36,Fantastic,"We stayed here for 5 nights in March. We had a beautiful room on the 22nd floor. Fantastic view of The city and the Mediterranean Sea. Housekeeping was excellent, breakfast included with room was very good. Front desk staff very helpful. Shopping mall across the street with many shops & restaurants . Tram line runs in front of mall, very convenient. We ate dinner in the restaurant, very pricey. Bar also pricey, 6 euros for a Coke. Wifi in room horrible , kept dropping, Ok in lobby. Overall a fabulous hotel .",5,2015,03,26
36,Best location in Barcelona,"The location of this hotel is unique , you can go anywhere from there by Taxi or Metro including down town and Night life area. CLDC is recommended and Shoko was average in atmosphere but very good food.

In additional to the above , in front of the Hotel there is nice shopping mall where there is lot of restaurants and shops.

The breakfast and service were Ok , Housekeeping needs attention and some Bellmen have attitude problem.",4,2015,03,26
36,Wow,"I've been here 2 weeks ago for a meeting.
Great position in the east of the city (you can reach the center in about 15min). 
Just in front of the hotel there is an enormous shopping center.
P.s. From my room (24th floor) I saw a beautiful sunset  with a great view of the entire city.",5,2015,03,25
36,Great hotel for business!,"I recently had attended a conference at this hotel and stayed 3 nights.  

Good service, room was clean.   If you plan to sightsee, this hotel is quite a distance from the top sights. Great for business.  Also very quiet hotel with great buffet breakfast included with your stay.",4,2015,03,20
36,"Nice modern, spacious rooms ","It is a great hotel- modern , spacious and the staff is really friendly and service-oriented. The location is also good - a big commercial centre is right across the street which offers plenty of eating options and there are a few other hotels of reputed brands nearby. But still it's a quiet area with a residential feel to it. 
It makes sense especially to choose this hotel in summers because a really nice beach is just 2 minutes away. Having seen the main barcelonetta beach - this beach is better in many ways. It's not very close to the old gothic and las Rablas area but it's not difficult to get to those areas.The metro station is close by - about 2 minutes away - behind the diagonal mar mall but we took a hop-on-hop-off tour. The fare to Sagrada familia was under 10 euros. In all I would recommend this hotel. It's all what you would expect from a Hilton property.",4,2015,03,19
36,High Class Hilton,"Fabulous few days spent here at the Hilton in comfort with great style. A warm welcome awaits on check in which was efficient and swift. My standard double room was comfortable with all usual facilities. Outdoor pool was not open until May but there is a well equipped gym. The hotel is situated close to the conference centre and walking distance of the harbour.  Breakfast was varied to suit all tastes and in plentiful supply. Roving waiters efficiently top up coffee/tea. 
Great base to exploe the beautiful city that Barcelona is!",5,2015,03,17
36,Nice stay,Clean and calm hilton. Really nice stuff and access to hilton lounge for gold members. Location bit far from the coty center but metro station is close.. peacefull hotel for business travellers and families. View to see was really nice.. at summer there is big pool and pool bar.,5,2015,03,15
36,Ok but not more,"Previously, when attending a conference, iatayed at Ace. That was a modern hotel with very small rooms. Now at the hilton, the rooms are more spacious, internet works better but the hotel is old and requires face lifting. Good for the business person, less so for his traveling companion.",3,2015,03,13
36,A COMFORTABLE PLACE TO STAY AT COMPETITIVE PRICING,"As a Hilton Honours member, free breakfast and evening tapas in the executive lounge are free. The Lounge is comfortable place to stoke up on food and drink, do emails and relax with excellent hostesses to answer questions and help us book tours. We are here for 6 nights and the taxi fare to the town centre varies with the time of day from about 9 euros to 16 euros.
We were upgrade to a corner room with a great view of the beach and the city. The room was clean and the ambiance is good. Free wifi is available in the Honours Lounge",5,2015,03,12
36,jewel in barcelona,"Overall

I constantly travel for work and am in hotels 4-5 nights a week clocking up over 200 room nights last year. My wife booked us into the La Mola hotel which didn’t work out so we moved here for 10 nights.  Booking direct through Hilton.com I thought this would be a busman’s holiday after the La Mola.  

The hotel itself is further out of Barcelona but no need for a car.  There is a subway stop below the shopping centre it is next to and this is perfectly fine.  We had a car from our stay at the previous hotel and we were offered discounted parking by booking a weekly rate.
If I stay in Barcelona again, I am staying here.  The hotel is a triangular shape and has pool up on the 2nd floor with sun loungers and outside bar and restaurant.  For the sun worshipers, you will need to move around as the 2 office blocks behind the hotel mask the sun for the hottest 4 hours of the day.

The hotel is right by the beach and across from a shopping centre.
On arrival we were greeted and given exec lounge access with my Diamond HH membership.  Staff couldn’t have been more helpful.  We eventually changed rooms as there was a group of oriental tourists who were really noisy on the exec floor level so we were moved upwards.  The views are great out over the ocean and the room is quite large but well appointed.

For the middle part of the stay there was a large hen party who “descended” on the hotel and exec lounge.  They were not all on the exec floor or given access but somehow they all got in.  At evening time the staff put out some nibbles and free drink.  If you ever watch nature programmes when seagulls circle a fishing trawler, this is what its like.  No sooner had they food left the exit of the kitchen and the hen party plus to be fair most of the other lounge guests mobbed the plates and the food was gone in about 2-5 minutes.  When we asked if there was any more the answer was no as they only get a certain amount sent up.  I felt really sorry for the lady running the lounge as this group were just loud – she told them off several times but to no avail. They all went outside onto the deck, took all the chairs and most of the lounge drinks with them.  The remainder were all smokers so we had to sit inside or be bombarded with shrill noise and smoke.  Once they left the place became much more civilised.  
Breakfast in the lounge was great – there was a good choice.

Service
The service  was great and not because I am a diamond HH.

Value
more than other hotels in the area but worth it given you have pool and outdoor bar access all day..

Sleep Quality
great. 

Cleanliness
Very clean  

Location
great.

Rooms
as expected.

General
Very nice clean hotel with good service",5,2015,03,12
36,Calm and Peaceful,"The hotel is a bit far from the center. Just across from the Diagnal Mar mall. A rather quiet and peaceful place with minimum activity. Clean and Comfortable rooms, free wifi is only available in the public areas of the hotel which was not very  helpful. ",4,2015,03,11
36,Love that hotel,"Stayed over the weekend. Great location by sea side, so had a chance to relax at the beach every day in the morning. Totally recharged my batteries after long working week. Also on direct metro line to reach city center no more then 15 mins.  
Had very good sleep - I think Hilton brand has the best beds. I would love to have same one at my home. Beautiful sunny rooms, had executive lounge access - team members there are great professionals, always ready to help with any question or inquiry. Good breakfast selection even in lounge. Would definitely stay in this hotel again and recommending.",5,2015,03,11
36,"Great hotel, near the subway and bus to airport","Stayed at the Hilton on the Diagonal Mar.... a block and a half from the subway, with easy transfers to Los Ramblas and the Harbor area. Also, lots of shopping around the hotel, within walking distance. Diamond membership with Hilton gets you on the Concierge floor, with free breakfast included. This was truly an outstanding hotel!!",5,2015,03,03
36,Great location with a view to sea and city. Excellent staff,"This hotel is in the outskirts of the city, which ensures a good night sleep without street noise. Very close to Metro station that brings you to the heart of the city within 10 minutes. Big Shoppingcenter across the street and the sea at the other direction that can be reached within 3 min walk. Fantastic friendly and helpful staff that really know their city and what to recommend. We enjoyed access to the executive lounge that has a good variety of free beverages, breakfast and afternoon snacks. Highly recommendable hotel.",5,2015,03,03
36,NICE AND CONVINIENT,"Very nice location if you are attaneding the congress in Congress Center next to it. Just the windows can not be opened, so it i sa pitty only to have a few on the sea but not be able to grasp some frash air inside. Staff is extremely nice and polite.",4,2015,03,01
36,Easy Going,"Went to Barcelona for the weekend with my wife (no kids!) - chose to stay at the Hilton Diagonal as part of a good offer we got through BA and for the most part we were very happy. 

The Hotel was a little further away from the tourist traps than I had thought it was going to be from my limited research, but overall it was a very nice area. Big shopping centre over the road with a variety of retail and food shops (only had coffee at Khenyan which was pretty good). Area was safe, quiet and very clean. I can imagine in summer the proximity to the beach would be a huge bonus. 

Our hotel room was on a higher floor with a pretty decent sea view. Nothing spectacular as the approach to the beach is blocked by a couple of commercial office blocks, and the surrounding area has an event space, but it was still nice to see the sun rise and watch the windsurfers in the mornings. 

The room itself was great - spacious, very clean, super comfy bed, pretty modern and well maintained. 

Breakfast was what you would expect from a Hilton. Decent variety prepared to a high standard. I'd highly recommend the omelettes over any of the pre cooked eggs though! 

Service was however exceptional. All the staff we encountered were friendly, attentive, easy going but not overbearing. Really, really good!

We had room service meals and a quick bar snack (along with a few late night cocktails!) - both of which were good, but, I'd have to say a little overpriced. Overall, I'd rate the food quality very high.

As ever, the one thing that let's the Hilton down is it's heavily over priced internet. We paid for premium access so we could Skype our children back home and 'High Speed' internet it was not. Hotels are embarrassing themselves with these ridiculous charges for a poor unreliable service, and the number of boutique and non chain hotels which offer complimentary high speed managed connectivity is a big attractor when deciding where to stay. I understand the need to restrict access to maintain bandwidth (and would happily pay for the privilege if it worked), but there are better, cheaper and easier ways to do this.  

Overall I would have no real reason not to choose to stay here again, other than perhaps looking for more central accommodation with better internet connectivity!",4,2015,02,24
36,My goto business hotel in Barcelona,"This is a typical Hilton hotel, with just enough of Catalan flair.

Rooms are spacious and comfortable, nice staff and airy bar location.

The food is excellent, I've enjoyed many a superb meal in here.

The hotel is also close to where I need to be in Barcelona, which is an obvious bonus.

I've used this hotel for the last 4 years without any issues.

**please note, I am a Hilton Gold status, so my experience may not be the same as other guests**",4,2015,02,23
36,very friendly hotel,"We were at this hotel for the valentines weekend. It was the first time at this hotel. The staff were very friendly and helpful. we had dinner one night and the service was excellent. Giovanni the floor manager and Emanuele our waiter were both so friendly and helpful. The rooms were very clean and spacious and the beach is literally just down the road.
The only complaint was the wifi was a bit poor in the rooms.",5,2015,02,22
36,Great location!,I stayed here with friends and the hotel is amazing. The rooms are very large and very nicely decorated.  I have stayed in many Hiltons around the world and it did not disappoint. It is close to the beach and there are a lot of taxis next door if you need to go anywhere.  The pool at the hotel is amazing! My only complaint would be that the wifi only works in the lobby,5,2015,02,19
36,Good business hotel,"Been to Barcelona many times on business and this is the first time I have stayed out of the centre of the city.  Great hotel, room large and comfortable, spotlessly clean, good wi-fi and restaurant tasty and efficient. Everything you need for a business trip, but slightly bland and soul-less if travelling for pleasure",4,2015,02,18
36,Tourist in Barcelona,"Wonderfull hotel. Splendid area for walking along the beach. Easy access to center of Barelona via metro. Good restaurant and Bar. Beach only 300-400 m away. We spend five days and by the way had fun with Barcelona halfmarathon, walked a lot in the city to all the usual tourist placed. We are comig back another time, lovely city",5,2015,02,18
36,Great choice!,"A loyal Hilton customer and this property did not disappoint. The service was excellent in the room and at the pool. The concierge was helpful and gave information about the city. The best thing was the tie up with Disney Cruise Line! There are representatives in the lobby prior to sail date and gave restaurant recommendations, sightseeing directions, mickey stickers to the kids and so much more!",5,2015,02,17
36,FANTASTIC HOTEL WITH ALL FACILITIES!,"Last week I visited Barcelona, first I stayed at other Hilton Barcelona. Then I came to this hotel for another stay. On my arrival welcome by friendly reception staff, well recognised as a diamond member and greeted for my loyalty to the Hilton hotels. As per my wish they allocated me a room at top floor, near to the elevator. My room number 2313 at the topmost twentythird floor, very next to the elevator. Spacious room, with fabulous views of the Mediterranean sea and below the swimming pool. (Now winter time outdoor swimming pool is closed). Floor to ceiling window, comfortable bed, bathroom with tub and bidet, all other usual amenities made my stay very much comfortable. Next to the elevator another large window with views of the city skyline including Sagrada familia is breathtaking! 
Executive lounge at fifteenth floor, with outdoor seating area with great views. But unfortunately this time of the year very cold in the afternoon and windy, I can't enjoy a drink at the outside area!
I had my breakfast and lunch at the Indigo restaurant (separate review), buffet breakfast is great, I had three course lunch, tasty but expenaive. 
To visit the City Center, taxi will costs 15 - 20 euros depends on the traffic. Easy way is the metro. Nearby station call 'Forum' about five minutes walk from the hotel. Tickets cost 2.35 euros for one journey. I bought two tickets for return journey, paid by card costs £3.33. The tickets machine don't accept 20 euros notes. 
Infront of the hotel, Barcelona's largest shopping mall Diagonal Mar situated, great for shopaholics! 
Now the odds, hotel don't have a indoor swimming pool. Outdoor swimming pool closed for winter time. To print my boarding pass I went to the executive lounge, but at the lounge, to use the computers have to pay 35 cents per minutes! Unbelievable! They instruct me to use the computers next to the reception, it's free. There are 4 computers, two Apple Mac, two Lenovos. I use one of the Apple to download my boarding pass, but unfortunately can't get a print! Then only the staff point out the Lenovos only connected to the printer! 
I booked a taxi to return the Barcelona El-Prat airport, about 30 minutes drive, costs 36 euros. 
Overall I enjoyed my stay at this hotel very well.",5,2015,02,14
36,Best for a relaxed vacation,"We spend 5 days in february here and enjoyd it much. Rooms (we had executive) but also the normal rooms are comfortable and quiet and always clean. From the lounge, the restaurant or to the help desk; everyone was friendly with a smile,helpful and do the best for the guests. We had breakfast whick offers you everything you like. From iberian food to vegan. And the quality of food is high here. Same at the lounge. I recommend this Hotel.Sure we come again.",5,2015,02,12
36,Internet in the room not free! Really....in this day and age!,"I can't believe that hotels in Europe still charge for Internet use. Hotel is fine, standard Hilton standard but to charge for Internet use in the room is unbelievable and will lose business. I was staying in Barcelona a minimum of 2 nights so changed hotels for the 2nd and subsequent nights.",3,2015,02,08
36,Great hotel - just what you expect,"I stayed at this hotel for a few nights with work. Apart from being convenient for work, the room was great, very well appointed with a view of the beech and sea.  The Bar is also a good size in the lobby, great service and ideal for meeting groups of colleagues.  Across the road is the Diagonal Mar shopping mall and restaurants which make an evening dinner easy to book. Thoroughly recommend it.",4,2015,02,08
36,My second visit - still fabulous !,"I visited the hotel in summer and had such a lovely time that I went back at the end of January

Still fabulous (but very different as it is a lot quieter) !

The hotel has a great location one block back from the beach in Diagonal Mar which is an area of Barcelona away from the tourist haunts. That's a plus as you are away from the hustle and bustle of the city but still close enough to visit

But there is something about the hotel and its location that I love.

We got a corner Executive Room 1508 on the 15th floor with magnificent views including a view from the bath-tub which was a treat !!

The level of service was (again) great with Cecilia and the other lady Exec Lounge host best being incredibly charming and helpful with everything we asked. Excellent service.

The Concierge gave us a VERY useful tip about visiting Parc Guell (instead of going to Lesseps metro go to Vallcarca instead - and you have a downhill walk to the Park rather than a steep uphill walk)

The food in the Exec Lounge was modest in range but exceptional in quality - really really good. Plus a lounge with some Haribo sweets can't really go wrong in my mind !

Its a brilliant place to visit in winter to get some winter sunshine and have a quiet break but also great in summer with its great pool and deck.

I have already booked two more trips to go back and am planning a third - I have the same issue every time I go to this hotel - I just feel happy and don't want to leave.",5,2015,02,07
36,a great one night stay,"embarked on a cruise in barcelona...the cruise line put us up in this lovely hotel for a night.  this hilton is one of the best hilton's i've stayed. from the moment we pulled up to the establishment until we left...this hotel is trendy and well appointed.  the staff was extremely, helpful from the front desk to the dinning room. our breakfast and dinner dinning expreince was exceptional...
we would definintely return to this hotel, it location was just a taxi ride away from most attraction",5,2015,01,28
36,Lovely Lovely Lovely,"My Partner and I stayed for a long weekend at The Hilton - Diagonal Mar Barcelona. The room was very quiet, very comfortable and all the staff were wonderful. Upon arrival we were given the opportunity to ""upgrade"" to a room with a view as we didn't have one, but quite honestly there does not appear to be a room without a view. Even overlooking the shopping center you can see the mountains! Absolutely beautiful, would highly recommend this hotel!",5,2015,01,28
36,Messi few days in Barcelona,"I love the buzz of this city and it's evident love for everything football (Barcelona FC). 

The hotel is located close to a large mall, but most of the traditional tourist sites are approx a 30 minute taxi ride away ie Neau Camp, Sagarda De Familia etc. 

The hotel is clean, well equipped with a beautiful terrace bar. We tended to eat out so I cannot say what the food is like. 

Given the choice again, and given the amount of time and money wasted on taxi's, I would choose a more centrally located hotel. ",4,2015,01,26
36,A wonderful experience,"It was a pleasure an an honor for me to stay at Hilton Diagonal Mar - Barcelona, Spain! Thank you for all the services that you ofer me as long as a stay at the hotel! I hope to return some day in Barcelona and I would like to  relive and share the same pleasant experience.",5,2015,01,22
36,Great Business Hotel,"I stayed here on a corporate conference and have to say it was ideal with excellent facilities and a good location for the Olympic Port & Marina.  The city centre is only a short taxi ride away as are most of the tourist landmarks.

The room was very clean and comfortable and the breakfast very good. The bar is a great place to gather in the early evening before heading out to sample the nightlife of Barcelona.

Definitely recommended for the business traveller.  My only criticism was the cost of the in-room Wi-Fi!",4,2015,01,20
36,Bruno in the Bar,"Bruno was most accommodating in recommending, making and serving wines and spirits during our Jan 11-13, 2015 stay at the Hilton Del Mar.  His sparkling personality was the highlight of a wonderful stay in Barcelona.  He speaks great English and eagerly taught us many Catalonian words and phrases!",5,2015,01,19
36,Ideal business hotel,"If you're looking for a good business hotel close to the marina (25 min walking), then this can, be your call. Big rooms, quite and very decent with a good service. Breakfast is good, various choices and it's ideally located. Only minor, sometimes the radio is playing at breakfast early in the morning ... which isn't that comfortable. But I would recommend it as a decent and good business hotel.",4,2015,01,19
36,Buisiness trip,"On a buisiness trip here, with terrible flight times and transfers, the stay here made the experience much easier.

Hotel is spotlessly clean and has great facilities for conference use.

I was treated fantastically by all staff, in particular Bruno, one of the barmen and also his manager David. Extremely pleasant and hard working people, very welcoming and professional. Bruno bent over backwards to ensure I was catered for at all times after learning of my less than favourable flight times.

If all hotels and staff were like this on buisiness trips, life would be much easier

Fully recommended.",5,2015,01,17
36,New Year Break,"Really enjoyed our stay at this Hotel, the staff were first class and made you feel very welcomed. Always had a smille and said hello to you. We were on the Execuitive Floor, it is worth paying that bit extra as the service is first class. Nice for breakfast and also nice to relax in in the evening with a drink. Lovely views from here. Thank you for a great stay.",5,2015,01,07
36,New Year 2014/15 done in style,"Returned to our second home in Barcelona to celebrate the start of another wonderful year.
So good to be back with our family and in true tradition we were spoilt so much. Upgraded to the Presidential Suite on the top floor with awesome views across the city, great to have such space to entertain our guests.
The Diagonal Mar continues to offer the very best of service to its clients and is totally focussed on customer service. Every member of staff cannot do enough to ensure that we are happy with our stay, the Make It Right policy is in place but we certainly did not have to use that service since we had total satisfaction with our stay.
Enjoyed a great Gala dinner on the 31 December, a great evening and to watch the fire works over the city from our lounge was spectacular.
Special mention to Toni for helping us sort out the problem with my sister in law in a neighbouring hotel, and for extending the Hilton hospitality to them also. Thanks also to Daniela who pours the best evening drinks just the way I like xxx
This is an exceptionally well run hotel and is a credit to the entire staff. I write this from Madrid but am happy to say we return to the great hotel in two days time.
Sincere thanks to all at our second home in BCN.",5,2015,01,05
36,Family hotel,"The hotel is in a great location next to the shopping mall Diagonal Mar, access to restaurants, shopping and very short walking distance to the beach. Taxis are also constantly available throughout the day and night in front of the hotel. Full breakfast experience with a variety of selections and staff are helpful and interactive with children.",4,2015,01,04
36,Excellent Stay!!,This property is slightly away from Plaza Catulunya but is a 5 minute walk from the Metro (Subway). Hotel is very clean and staff are friendly and efficient. Received an upgrade as a Hilton Gold member and my room had a beautiful view of the city and the Mediterranean Sea. I would DEFINITELY stay here again!,5,2015,01,03
36,Good location,"Typical business Hilton hotel. Good location, subway 10 min walk, can get buses, we walked around a lot. Clean and comfortable. Good hotel for one two nights in Barcelona. Same as most Hilton hotels. Room we booked was king, not huge but adequate for one night. Cost reasonable for major city.",4,2015,01,02
36,great stay,"we had a good time at the hotel, close to metro and breakfast was awesome so was the hotel staff.
I forgot my cash[500euros] and checked out of the hotel only to realize 2hours later about the cash, we came back and they got me my money back. it was my fault so anyone could get away with it but they were honest enough to give me back. Although we live in an uncertain world, honest people still exist out there. thank you Hilton staff  for the wonderful stay.",5,2015,01,02
36,End Of Cruise Downtime,"Short stay to wind down at end of a cruise. very modern hotel a little way out from main tourist araes but easy to get to ggod areas by cab and metro. Great location for Barcelona FC stadium. Upgraded to suite which was very good, modern style but usual Hilton excellent service. Very good executive lounge.",4,2015,01,02
36,Great stay,"My family stayed at the Hilton Diaganol Mar in December 2014 and the hotel is great, clean, modern, close to mall and metro.  The staff was great and treated us as VIP's.  Hotel is close to sea and great shopping and restaurants.

But special kudos to the entire hotel staff.  Highly recommended..",5,2014,12,31
36,"Great hotel, location may be less than optimal in winter","This is a well-run, clean, comfortable, well-appointed, professional & friendly hotel. Hilton brand means you basically know what to expect. Especially because we came into and left Barcelona via Sants train station the hotel was rather out of the way being on the other side of town. Also it may have been more fun staying in the city center. But note that our stay was in December when proximity to the beach was not a factor. On the plus side this hotel is located near the yellow line of the subway system which is convenient to many of the places a traveler would want to go, so the distance was not such a big deal. Two people can share a subway ticket so get a 10x pass and go have fun!",4,2014,12,28
36,Amazing hotel,"Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona is an amazing hotel. This hotel features spacious, contemporary rooms. The service standard is outstanding, speciously of the breakfast staff. They will make sure that you will start your day in a good mood! The cleanliness of the room is outstanding. Hotels location is superb and the view out of the room is magnificent. I will definitely return to Hilton for my next stay in Barcelona and I will recommend this property to all my friends!  ",5,2014,12,26
36,Loved it,"The hotel is located in front of the sea, and the big shopping mall. It is new, so all the rooms are fresh and nicely decorated, like a Hilton should be, bathroom with separated shower and bathtub. Excellent breakfast, large variety, fresh juices and coffee/tea a la carte.
Great hotel, would definetely return.",5,2014,12,24
36,Fabulous stay at this Hilton with fabulous staff!,"We had a club Exec suite at the Hilton Diagonal Mar.  It has beautiful views.  From the moment we arrived, I was addressed by name and every member of staff was very customer service orientated.  The staff in the Exec lounge in particular were fantastic.  I must mention Maria who went out of her way to make sure we had a great stay.  

The hotel is located a little out of the main part of the city but a 5 minute walk takes you to the Metro and you can be in the city in 15 minutes.

If I was travelling to Barcelona again, I wouldn't hesitate to stay at this hotel.

Thank you very much!",5,2014,12,22
36,"Nice big hotel, although not very central","This is my third visit here and my best experience yet, as I was recognised as a Gold hhonors member and given a room on the executive levels (15+). The Executive lounge is on the 15th floor and offers great views of the city and coastline in the distance. The breakfast and drinks and whole area of the exec lounge is very nice. There is a large lobby and bar area and the staff are all very friendly and accommodating. Rooms are a good size and fairly modern. The Diagnoal Mar shopping Mall is right across the road from the hotel with many shops and restaurants which is handy. Also convenient is a large taxi rank right outside the hotel which always has a line of cars waiting. It costs between 9 and 10 euros to get to the centre of the city, in 15-20 minutes. It is a shame that they chose to double the price of the rooms during the time when my company held a conference in the city, but overall this is a very good Hilton.",4,2014,12,21
36,Good Hotel,"My first impression was great as they upgraded me to a executive room due to my honors card. The room was sufficiently large unlike what you expect in Europe. It was well setup and the bathrooms etc were spacious and well equipped. 

The breakfast was okay. what I missed was the omelette station but on request they make it immediately. 

The WiFi was not very efficient and you lost connection frequently. In fact it went down for the whole day on the last day of my stay.

All in all a very pleasant stay. ",4,2014,12,12
36,Excellent overall,"After a long flight, this was a very nice restful place to be for 2 nights before we
went on a cruise.  The Executive Lounge is very nice with great views over the
city and the food is very good and lots of it to choose from.

Allover excellent.",4,2014,12,10
36,Business hotel with excellent location,"Diagonal Mar comes across as an average business hotel. After 5 nights in November there is little that makes it stand out in the crowd. That being said, the breakfast is good and the rooms are nice and clean as you would expect. Never tried the fitness and recreational options. The best part is the location, just adjecent to a big shopping center and a food court with plenty to pick from. All in all Hilton Diagonal Mar is probably a just as good choice for leasure as for business.",3,2014,12,10
36,Slick Business Hotel,"This is my second review of this hotel. 

The service has improved and breakfast is less chaotic. 
The hotel is clean slick and professional. What professional people want. 
Wifi is decent although for a business hotel still lagging behind other European countries in speed and price.
The reception, concierge and management was very good. I like to be greeted with a smile. I was made to feel welcome. The front desk was very helpful with printing and flight information. 
I like the Hilton brand. I would definitely recommend.",4,2014,12,07
36,No value for money,"After a recent perfect stay in the Hilton in Istanbul recently I decided to select the Hilton for my recent stay december 1-4 in Barcelona.  The room rate of Euro 315 did not even have breakfast and internet in the room ( room 721 )  included.  When checking in the comment was just ""this is standard sir"". Most annoying though was that showering neded to be done in the bathtub.  Overall the room was clean, slightly dated but absolutely no value for money at all. As a gold member of the SPG group that's the brand to stay in the future.",2,2014,12,06
36,Good hotel in quiet area,"There are two Hiltons in Barcelona, both on the long Diagonal highway. Make sue you get a reservation at Diagonal Mar, which is the most modern and has sea views. It is opposite a large shopping centre with restaurants (though mostly of the fast food variety). Since completion of the highway tunnel under the port, it's only a 20' ride from the airport. Staff were very friendly and the room clean and comfortable. Unfortunately there is no free WiFi. There is a taxi rank just outside.",4,2014,12,06
36,Poor to mediocre,"Location is good, rooms are fine but the staff and their attitude is anything but warm.  I was given a room with sea-view on special request and it was the only good gesture. Boring to say the least with empty executive lounge where you actually have to pay for a drink... Not sure why Hilton is still keeping this hotel on their portfolio. The executive lounge staff just keep sitting and not even bother to replenish and if you ask for a drink , they just point and not actually serve..really disappointing.",3,2014,12,04
36,Great service,"Nice hotel opposite Catalonia's largest shopping center, Diagonal Mar. From the room overlooking the sea. Big rooms. tasty breakfast. Taxi and metro NeXT to entry. Lobby with freindly staff. Pool area and nearby  beach",5,2014,12,03
36,Disappointing stay,"For this price, the room was rather disappointing, nothing special, furniture a bit shabby and some damage to the ceiling in the bathroom. No free Internet in the room and having to pay so much for the WiFi in the room is a joke. Being in Barcelona for an IT conference, Internet connection was kind of important for me. Very good breakfast, with good selection of warm and cold food and some local specialties. The staff was relatively helpful if asked but rather reserved and not very interested. The staff at the breakfast was in contrast very friendly and nice. I got a room connected by doors with another one and I couldn't sleep because of my noisy neighbour who was talking on the phone in the middle of the night and watching a lot of TV. I could hear everything, even when she was on the toilet. Quite awkward. The room and the bathroom were rather clean, a bit dusty (I'm allergic so it matters to me) and the cleaning people seem to have OCD (they were collecting all my cosmetics and stuff and packing them back into my makeup pouches every single time. For the next few days in Barcelona I moved to Torres Catalunya and was much more satisfied with the stay.",3,2014,11,26
36,"Good location, Good service but a bit expensive","I was on a business trip to Barcelona attending a conference, and stayed at Hilton. The staff was really helpful and supportive. I did request for a higher floor room, which I was told isn't available, however i was given a free upgrade which was really nice.

The room service staff was nice and helped me choose from the In-Room dining menu. 

The only drawback is that it was quite expensive but i guess all 5-star hotels in Barcelona are expensive.",4,2014,11,24
36,"Great hotel, Excellent people, Lots nearby ","The title says it all in a nutshell, but let me expand. Rooms are comfortable with those ending on 09-12 having wonderful views of the Mediterranean Sea and sunrises every morning. As others have noted, also ask for a high floor. The Executive Lounge is on the 15th floor, which seems a bit odd at first, but really, it affords another floor of great views. The lounge itself also has an outdoor balcony. Food was changed daily - not just the same thing everyday like I've experienced elsewhere. I became a fan of the granola bars - especially the strawberry ones. Staff there was super friendly without fail. I'd also like to recognize Alexandra at the front desk who was exceptionally helpful during my stay.

The hotel is not located downtown, but by the beach. Many people who were there for the same congress ran on the beach daily. And I should not forget to mention that the subway stop is about 2 blocks from the hotel, which makes visiting attractions super easy. 

Lastly, there is a ""standard"" shopping mall across the street. However what's not standard are the number of both fine dining and casual restaurants in the mall. I prefer to eat outside of my hotel, and chose an excellent Italian restaurant on my last night in BCN, and a casual noodle shop a few nights prior. 

Hotel is definitely recommended!",5,2014,11,22
36,Very bad Hilton,"Go here if you

- want to pay for internet in your room
- do not want any service during or after five days staying
- like broken things in your room
- like if your guests who join for breakfast are fully charged for a glass of juice only and treated like they where beggars
- want to be left alone if you need any assistance
- are looking for a very average breakfast and room service at skyhigh prices
- look for a way to throw away your money

what an awful hotel.. I consider to tear up my hhonors card, it is useless...",1,2014,11,13
36,Great water view,"The view was excellent and we found the service to be friendly and very helpful.  Although not right in the city center, the metro was nearby and provided acess to the old town and the sights we wanted to see.  The mall next door was nice and we purchased an excellent bottle of wine and snacks to enjoy before going out for dinner in the Alcampo store there.  The cabs do not take charge or foreign currency so be sure you have enough Euros to get to the hotel from the airport.  It runs about 40 Euros each way (35 cab fare plus 4 airport tarrif). If you are an experienced traceller, you can take the bus from the airport to the metro for less than 10 Euros each way but you should be able to have some conversational ability in Spanish if you try this route since English is not as universally spoken here as in many other European cities.",4,2014,11,13
36,Quiet hotel,This is my second stay on Hilton Diagonal Mar. I choose this hotel because it is situated outside the city center and close to the beach north of town. Good public transportation via Metro to down town Barcelona or you can even walk if you are fit. The hotel offers a nice view and is situated in a nice quiet area.,4,2014,11,13
36,"Bad service, bad organisation","Badly organised, badly managed, bad quality. 

The hotel is next to the convention centre so they know they will always be busy. For this reason they have obviously decided to cut back on standards because they will always make a profit. The service is appalling (rude, slow, disorganised) the food is disgusting (cold, slow, boring). At the hotel bar the barman refused to set up a tab because he said they were so badly organised they would either lose my card or it would be stolen. In indigo restaurant the waiters shouted at us, knocked my shoulder when they took the plates and forgot everyone's order.
Incredibly bad. ",2,2014,11,12
36,Great but with one huge annoyance,"Stayed 3 nights. Was upgraded to a lovely Relax room on the 14th floor. Clean, modern, very helpful staff. 
Location is in Diagonal Mar, outside the city centre but the Metro is only five minutes walk away and the service into the centre is excellent and cheap, especially if you buy a T-10 card. 
When taking a taxi from the airport be sure to stress Diagonal Mar as there is another Hilton on the other side of town, also on Diagonal!
Breakfast was good quality, fair selection, plenty of friendly staff.
The biggest plus was the bed. Everyone in my party commented on the beds. I want one. the best sleep ever.
The major irritation was €25 a day for wifi. Really? In this day and age? When you have already paid over €200 for the room? This should not be happening and I took a * off for this. Top tip - there is free wifi in the shopping centre across the road from the hotel and fast wifi, also free, at Bar Estrella on the way to the Metro station.",4,2014,11,11
36,Good hotel if you are attending a conference at the congress center,Fairly typical Hilton with a good location to the congress center within easy walking distance. No covered walkway if it should rain however. OK medium priced food choices across the street at the mall. Many cab drivers do not know where the hotel is located which can be a problem. You will need to take a cab or bus to get to any of the tourist attractions as the congress center is not centrally located.,4,2014,11,09
36,Great experience!,"Very friendly staff at the front desk - unfortunately can't remember the name of the tall young guy checking me in but he was lovely! Clean room, nice food and beverage outlets. Would definitely return when next in Barcelona. ",5,2014,11,04
36,Average hotel but good price,"The hotel is average, but if you are traveling to Barcelona you shouldn't stay in the hotel. Go out and explore.  Although I would not recommend it, we walked along the beach way and into the city. The conceige lounge is nice to visit every day. We had some nice wine and great desserts there. The cab ride into the city was not bad. We tried to take their metro rail, but there was a gang fight on it the first time so we did not use it again. The hotel staff we very nice and we did not have any issues during our stay.",3,2014,11,04
36,A Spanish Dream,"We spent two nights prior to our cruise and loved and enjoyed every moment...Wonderful, caring staff, beautiful room, great restaurant and perfect location..We would not hesitate to stay in this hotel if we return to Barcelona...Thanks for the wonderful memories...",5,2014,11,03
36,Not good for the price,"This hotel does not offer a good value for the money.
It is very good end comfortable, but equivalent hotels at a cheaper price are available in the area. 
Need to pay extra charge for Wifi!
There was a problem with supply of hot water one day. This is not acceptable in such hotel
    ",3,2014,11,01
36,Business hotel,"If you have stayed in the Hilton hotels before you will know what to expect. Very efficient service and rather bland rooms and public. All very modern, clean and functional. Reminds me of being in  Germany rather than Spain.",4,2014,10,30
36,Excellent Experience!!!,"We spent 4 nights at this hotel and absolutely Loved it.  First of all, the hotel did a great job accommodating our group of about 30 family members at the last minute. The staff was the BEST, their service was excellent, they consistently found solutions to cater to our group's needs (not just empty sorrys). Special Shout Out to Monica! She always went above and beyond. Language wasn't an issue as I believe most of the staff speak English.  

The rooms were luxurious and the views were lovely. I slept like a baby. We booked about 21 rooms/suites on different floors and not a single complain. There is a mall right across the hotel with a lot of stores and restaurants. You can practically get any type of food there. The hotel is a walking distance from the beach. In short, everything about this hotel was Awesome. I absolutely recommend it for a Quality 5-star stay.
 
From the large group often dressed in similar clothing... I want to say Gracias!!!",5,2014,10,28
36,A Warm Welcome to Barcelona,"We had a brief one night stay prior to boarding a cruise, but enjoyed every minute of our stay at this beautiful property.  Our rooms were ready in the morning after our transatlantic flight and even enjoyed breakfast in the Executive Lounge before it closed.  Room had a nice view of the city skyline, and the outdoor terrace in the Executive Lounge became our favorite spot to eat, drink and enjoy the views.  A short block walk to the beach, the Diagonal Mar Mall across the street afforded numerous eating cafe's and restaurants, and we enjoyed shopping in the grocery store to buy wine to take on board the ship.  The tram into downtown and the old town boards just across from the Mall so easy access into the city for sightseeing.  Staff were very professional and personable, all fluent in English and very helpful.  A special Thank You to Tony for his outstanding service at the Front Desk.  The hotel is located about a 30 minute drive from the El Prat Airport, and about 25 minutes from the Cruise Port.  
Rooms were clean and well equipped with amenities and furnished in typical business class style Hilton.  Quiet with no street noise although the hotel sits on a corner of 2 very busy avenues in the Diagonal Mar area.  Pool area, gym, and sauna well equipped and convenient.
A very nice property and would not hesitate to stay here again.  Thank You for a brief, but memorable stay in Barcelona.",5,2014,10,28
36,Excellent,"We spent 5 nights at on our first trip to Barcelona and loved this hotel.  The location is perfect not far away to the metro, shopping and many good restaurants and cafes.  I can't say enough about the staff, very friendly and eager to be helpful. Well done to Bruno very professional & friendly.  The breakfast buffet is great. A great place, would happily recommend or go back.",5,2014,10,26
36,great location by the beach,"Not close to Ramblas, but if you want a beach friendly location, the Diagonal Mar Hilton is great.  A five minute walk to the beach, big shopping center across the street, and close to the CCIB where many conferences are held.  Service was excellent.  Exec lounge food is not up to par, though.  Front desk staff were excellent.",5,2014,10,25
36,Good hotel and close to conference centre,This Hilton has magnificent views looking out over the ocean and back onto the city. It is comfortable and has an executive  lounge on the 15th floor with great views. The staff are really helpful and provide a great breakfast.  Sunrise is spectacular to watch. This hotel is well located for the conference centre. However it is 20-30 minutes by metro to get to the old town. If you are a tourist and just want to be in the old town and around most museums then this may be a bit to far out for you.There is a massive shopping centre opposite and metro and trams close by.,5,2014,10,24
36,Convenient to Convention Center,"Everything you could ask from a Hilton.  Excellent executive lounge; patio unusable because of nicotine addicts..  Restaurant average to above average, but pricey.  Convenient to convention center and adjacent shopping center with diverse and reasonable restaurants.",4,2014,10,24
36,Good Hilton property for business or holiday,"I stayed here during a conference. Hotel is located near ocean front and opposite Diagonal mar shopping centre, suppose to be largest mall in Barcelona. It is adjacent to convention centre. A relatively new and high rise property. Although slightly away- 4-5km from city centre it is still convenient to reach across the city. Check-in was quick and rooms are spacious and well laid. I stayed on executive floor, hence had access to executive lounge which has nice viewing deck on 15th floor.
Bar and restaurant were good. Can't fault with anything. Good property for short stay in Barcelona.",4,2014,10,23
36,"Really good, but not perfect","Well located at the beachside, not directly in the city but good subway connection and a big mall directly at the front door. Overall condition okay, but rooms could be in a better shape, e.g. parts of curtin were hanging loose. Breakfast was really good, nice variety and the service was perfect. Good english skills at the whole team!",4,2014,10,23
36,Pros and Cons,"We stayed for one night, prior to boarding a cruise, in an Executive room on the 22nd floor. Although the Executive level has its own check in you can't go up to that level without using an Executive room key in the lift - so still have to check in in the lobby which defeats the object! We arrived at 4pm when there were lots of guests checking in but only two members of staff on the desk. There was no help with luggage at this time of day although there seemed to be several bell boys around the next morning.
The room was fine with great views and the 19th floor lounge very pleasant with an outside patio area, but unfortunately even at level the smell of traffic fumes made it unpleasant for us to sit out - but many other guests did.
We had pre-booked on line a special two course dinner in the Indigo restaurant. When we went to dinner the restaurant manager had the reservation but had never heard of the special offer. We chose to sit at a table on the balcony, but afterwards realised that was a mistake as we both smelled of traffic fumes. Dinner was OK.
The restaurant manager asked me to email his boss the Food and Beverage manager about the special offer, which I did. When we returned to our room later we had been sent lots of chocolate with the managers compliments.
Buffet breakfast in the Executive lounge was just OK but limited. Its included in the executive premium price, but breakfast in the restaurant is e25 each.
Next morning we had to drag our suitcases through the lobby then a further 100 meters to where the taxi stand is on a main road.",4,2014,10,21
36,Beautiful view,"This is a typical Hilton hotel.  The hotel is very clean and modern.  It is not in the city center of Barcelona - instead it is near the convention center.  The view from my hotel room was a wonderful view of the Mediterranean Sea.  The morning and evenings were especially beautiful.

The hotel staff were very nice and friendly.  One waiter was especially note-able -- Bruno served me lunch one day and was so kind.  He shared information on Catelonia - foods that are particularly common this time of year in the region, etc.  He was very eager to make my lunch as nice as possible.

This is not the hotel to stay if you want to be close to all of the action in the city (cathedral, La Rambla, Sagrada Familia, etc).  This is really a hotel for the congress center.  There is a very nice shopping mall across the street with multiple nice restaurants (tapas, etc).",5,2014,10,20
36,"Great hotel, outstanding service from everyone","Had the pleasure of staying at the Hilton Diagonal Mar for a 4 day conference and have to say the facilities are brilliant, with all the hotel staff going out of their way to make sure your every need is attended to.  A special mention to Bruno in the Indigo Restaurant ... on our first morning at breakfast we were met by Bruno who showed us to our table and was then attentive throughout. Every morning after that he greeted us by name, showed us to our table and made us feel that we were the only ones in the restaurant,  no mean feat as the hotel was full of delegates attending the conference and he managed to take the time to speak to most of them.  The breakfast I have to say was exceptional, plenty of selection and constantly being replenished by the staff.  

Although not in the centre of Barcelona a short taxi ride/metro journey will take you to the tourist spots. There is a large shopping complex opposite the hotel that also has a large selection of restaurants.

A great hotel made even better with the brilliant staff it employs.",5,2014,10,20
36,Outstanding Service,"My wife and I stayed at the Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona for one week from October 5th to 12th.  The service from all the staff was outstanding.  Everyone, from Marlene at the reception who checked us in, to Bruno the breakfast host who always said that if there is anything he can do to make our stay just a little bit better to let him know, to Maria in the executive lounge, all the staff were exceptional.

The hotel is located just a bit away from the city center but it is an easy metro ride to the city center.  We did all the usual tourist things in the city center (museums, Gaudi attractions including Sagrada Familia, etc.) by taking the metro back and forth from the hotel.

Overall, we would strongly recommend this hotel.",5,2014,10,19
36,Weirdly annoying,"Barcelona has some very chic, interesting, beautiful neighbourhoods.  This hotel isn't near any of them.  It's a longish walk to the interesting bits of the beach and the marina, and too far to the Ramblas or the other historic bits.

There is a shopping mall across the street, but essentially if you stay here, you're going to need bus, taxi or train to get anywhere.  Taxi into the centre can take anything from about 10 minutes up to 30 plus in the rush hour and cost from about 9 euro up depending on traffic and where you are going.

 The hotel seems to derive a significant part of 1its trade from people combining a stay in Barcelona with a cruise.  This can mean that, at times, the lobby, reception and other facilities get swamped as lots of people try to do the same thing at the same time.  It's not the hotel's fault, but it did seem to be full of people who didn't seem able to operate the elevator, or for that matter the revolving door.

The front desk was inadequately staffed.  It took me 30 minutes waiting in line to check in.  Apart from that experience, there seems to be only the one front desk - no concierge - so any contact with the hotel has to go through the one overworked desk.   Some staff were pleasant, others curt - I suspect, highly stressed.

When I got there, the hotel had no record of an early check in request, although I had confirmed it directly with hilton reservations.  They did, however, manage to meet the request, which I appreciated.
 
Room - on the 14th floor was just below the executive level, but decently equipped, with a large and functional desk.  The selection on the TV, for an English speaker, was weird - no CNN, no BBC, but Russia Today and China TV's English service.  And, as far as I could tell, absolutely no movie selection.

Internet service was good.  Fast enough to stream TV, didn't drop out and seemed consistent at different times of the day.

For a big hotel, the gym was disappointing.  It's in a very small room, looking onto (and viewed by) the pool area - so while you're sweating on the treadmill, you're trying to avoid the eye of people lounging by the pool.  Possibly because of the amount of glass, it gets uncomfortably hot.

Of the two treadmills, one was out of action.  There are a few Precor weight machines and a set of free weights. If a good gym is part of your requirements for a hotel, go somewhere else.

Apparently there is s full breakfast service, but I was told that my rate only included the cut down service at the lobby bar.  For a quick snack, it's OK - cornflakes, bread (no toast) and a very limited range of pastries.  They give you coffee and orange juice.  Although you help yourself to cereal, there was no milk (I had to ask the bartender), which sort of implies they expect people to eat it dry.

So overall - it's OK, but with annoyances.  I don't know if Hilton regard this as their main Barcelona property, but it falls a little short of being a flagship.",3,2014,10,19
36,Location is fair but hotel and staff was excellent,A little far to walk into the main area of town but taxi service was always immediately available and a short ride to get to any area.  The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful with any request.  The happy hour for Hilton Honors members was exceptional.  Rooms were larger than most in Europe and ours had a great view of the sea.,5,2014,10,19
36,Great service even before my visit,"I was planning a holiday visit to the Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona, but my trip was prevented by a very unfortunate and serious road accident suffered by my daughter two days before we were due to depart from home.  When I called to request their flexibility and accommodations, the hotel staff were very understanding and acted well beyond the call of duty in order to help us in our situation.  I still haven't been to the hotel, but I look forward to my eventual visit both to enjoy their service and to thank them personally for their attentions.",5,2014,10,17
36,Great city center hotel,Excellent hotel far enough outside of the center for quiteness but close enough for day trips. Man made beach a short stroll - not real sand but nice sea for a paddle. Shopping center opposite for the kids and fast food. Free parking outside but be careful as can be towed if in wrong spot. Nice breakfast with lots of variety. Better view the higher up with less road noise. Quite windy rooftop pool although overlooked somewhat by offices so not a resort feel. Overall clean and welcoming city hotel.,4,2014,10,17
36,Wifi costs 25 euros per day!!,"Is it really 2014? Come on! If you are a business oriented hotel and charge 25 euros for wifi you should really wake up!!

Otherwise it is a standard Hilton hotel for good and bad... All depends on what you are looking for, but for a business hotel you sholud go somewhere else!",2,2014,10,16
36,Excellent address for business travelers,"Well located – on the Diagonal, close to the sea shore and a large shopping center – Hilton Diagonal Mar offers an excellent service to business travelers: nice and available personnel at the reception and for the room service, well equipped rooms with large bay windows.
One drawback: the wifi is not free of charge in the rooms.",5,2014,10,15
36,Great place to stay!,"Great place to stay just few steps from the beach and shopping center with all you might need. The staff is outstanding, rooms clean and Hilton breakfast just great! Also paying a little more for an upgrade (we had a relaxation room) is definitely worth it! 5 stars fully deserved ;-)",5,2014,10,14
36,not really up to Hilton standards,"Because of corporate agreements I spend around 40 nights per year in Hilton Hotels so I think I know them pretty well.
This was my first stay at this particular hotel and I found it below par for normal Hilton standards. The building itself is a bit jaded. Looks like a 1980s thing which could do with a good refurbishment. The bathroom sink had a huge strip of silicone across it which was really not nice. But the worst was that I was unable to check out because there was a very long queue and I would have had to wait over 30 minutes (so I left and asked them to charge my credit card). There were no facilities for Hilton Honors members either. Obviously poor planning on the part of the management.
The basic service is otherwise fine as in all Hiltons but the general experience was rather poor. 
Just one point about location. The hotel is situated inland in what taxi drivers call ""mountain side"". If you want to be near the Rambla, this is not the place as it will take you a 30 minute taxi ride to get there.",3,2014,10,12
36,"Modern hotel, nice location","Hotel is located in front of Diagonal Mar shopping mall, a bit remote from city center but it has its pluses as the place is usually quiet and peaceful. Superb sea and city views from high floors (15+).  Rooms are modern and in good enough conditions. Carpets on floors look quite dates though and have lots of stains. Elevators are rather slow so on high floors you may wait quite long.",4,2014,10,10
36,Excellent location/service could be better,"The hotel is right cross the street from the beach.  It is a very modern, clean hotel.  Very large room and great bathroom.  (Large also and very nice shower).  Beautiful pool and outdoor bar.  Their customer service could be better and they charge you extra for everything!  Even a newspaper! (3 euros).  They charge you for wifi in your room.  (I think it was 25 euros a day!) also they wouldn't let me use the minibar to keep some things cold unless I gave them a credit card and authorized a charge.  It is a shame that they charge extra for everything.  You are already paying a lot for the room. You get free wifi in your hotel room at less expensive hotels I think it is ridiculous they charge you so much at this hotel.",4,2014,10,08
36,Nice place,"The hotel is very nice.  My room (as a Diamond) was a bit lacking, I thought.  There were a few issues in the room, the main one was that the shower drain was backing up. Overall the stay (2 nights) was OK.  I found the Executive lounge a bit light on stuff.  They were closed on Sunday morning for cleaning ?  Maybe that could be done at 2 AM?  I took a soda and walked out to my room and was stopped by the authorities and told that NOTHING leaves the lounge...  Breakfast was included, either in the lounge or downstairs.  I found the downstairs choices 100 times better.  By ""Big Hilton"" standards the breakfast was just OK.  There are two Hilton Diagonal's in town.  This one is Hilton Diagonal Mar.  Be sure you know which one you are going to.  Having stayed at both, I would say the other one is the better of the two.  I can't really complain about either.",4,2014,10,06
36,Impressive,"Very lucky my company booked me into the executive floors. The room was spacious and very modern. It had everything I needed. Because of traffic, the only downside was the taxi journey each morning. Staff were really attentive. I would definitely stay here again. ",4,2014,10,05
36,Excellent hotel,"excellent base for visiting Barcelona with convenient shuttle to city centre. Clean and comfortable we we stayed overnight before joining our cruise ship. The staff were extremely helpful, giving us lots of advice on city highlights and tips on where to find the best tapas in less touristy restaurants than along La Rambla.",4,2014,10,05
36,Very average hotel,"This is the second time I have stayed here and chose it because of location which is slightly outside the city and beside the beach.  Firstly the positive, the staff are really friendly and helpful.  Rooms are clean and also a very good size and the bed is comfortable.
The reason for the average rating is all of the small but important things that are wrong.  We arrived very late at night and fell into a wonderful hot bath.  Got out, no bathrobes, so you are left standing thinking ""what now"" as I wanted to order room service which means greeting them naked or fully dressed once again, neither option being ideal.  Went to the room service menu as neither of us had eaten since lunch time and the late night options are essentially soup or a ham and cheese toasty - not good.  We just left it.
In the bathroom, no waste basket for tissues, face wipes etc, so the option is to leave them there (not really) or take them to the one waste bin in the bedroom.
Internet access in the room is 25 euros, public spaces it is free for 8 hours in any one day.  Result - leave the hotel find somewhere else and unsurprisingly - spend money.  
The competition amongst hotels worldwide is increasing and it is always the small things that win loyalty, return visits and higher average spend per guest.  
In 2014 I would have thought that the Hilton would understand this.",3,2014,10,03
36,Really nice hotel right next to the sea.,"I have stayed at the Hilton Diagonal Mar a number of time, each time the staff have gone out of their way to help, this time was for my honeymoon and they made it perfect. The rooms are comfortable and it well worth taking an executive room with sea views and use of the excellent executive lounge and patio breakfast is idyllic .",5,2014,10,02
36,Nice hotel,We stayed here before a cruise. It is a very nice hotel with large rooms.  Only bad thing is it is not within walking district of main tourist areas.  But there is a taxi stand in front if hotel. Also hop on hop off bus picks up by hotel. Not many restaurants nearby. It is an industrial area. Taxi to Las Ramblas wasn't too much money.  ,4,2014,10,01
36,3rd Stay as Good as the First,"i enjoyed another nice five night stay at this hotel. Loved the large corner room with a lovely view on the 20th floor. The Executive Lounge was nice, serving breakfast and cocktails with tapas. The balcony view in the lounge is beautiful, with outdoor tables. The convenience to the convention center next door, the large shopping mall across the street and close proximity to tourist sights (2.5 miles to Sagrada Familia) are the reasons for my return visits, as well as the superior facilities and service.",4,2014,10,01
36,"Hilton Diagonal Mar, Barcelona","A good hotel about 3.5 Kilometers from the main part of the city.  Close to the beach with a major shopping centre across the road and the convention centre very close by.  The rooms are nice - Hilton standard, and well appointed. 
There did not seem to be a concierge with travel / tourist info however when we were checking in there were courtesy desks for 2 cruise ships for the passengers who were also checking in post cruise - one of the courtesy staff provided me with maps and info. Barcelona has an excellent hop on / off bus service and one stop is right outside the door almost.",4,2014,10,01
36,Great hotel,Stayed one night with wife. No complaints. Room was good and nice. Great view from executive lounge balcony. A little bit outside from the places but there is metro station near by. Would stay next time.,5,2014,09,30
36,Adequate,"I was attending a meeting for work and this Hilton property was very close to the convention center.  The rooms were updated and clean, the beds comfortable.  Taxis were lined up outside the hotel and plentiful at nearly all hours.  The service in the hotel was average and there is no concierge to assist with arranging meals or guides.  The property is not near any important tourist sights and is a healthy walk to the nearest Metro stop.  The breakfast buffet was large but the hot options were relatively unappetizing.  There are no nearby restaurants for breakfast, so no other convenient option.  When I inquired about purchasing WiFi for the room without the breakfast, I was informed WiFi alone would cost nearly as much as the bundle, which was odd.  While in a quiet location, this hotel was essentially unremarkable and strictly adequate.  At this price, I probably wouldn't opt to stay here again unless a business function so required.",3,2014,09,28
36,Hilton Standards,"As a Diamond members, the hotel maintained what I have grown accustomed to expect. We received Excellent service. The hotel went out of their way to check us in when we arrived early. The metro was  5 min walk.",5,2014,09,28
36,Excellent executive lounge,"I returned here for a holiday after staying for a conference earlier this year. When the hotel isn't hosting such large events the rates are very reasonable and the hotel is a great choice for families. The exec rooms are on the 15th and 19th and up floors, we were on the 15th floor which was actually very good as it was close to the exec lounge and also very quiet thanks to the carpeted standard rooms above (the exec rooms however have wooden floors so might be noiser). The rooms are large and very quiet, on both visits I stayed on the city side which is stunning and even though there was an all-night music festival on at the outdoor Forum venue across the road (on the sea- side) we couldn't hear a thing.

The exec lounge was excellent and the concierge were exceptional (concierge on main reception however were non-existent). I didn't have high hopes for the continental breakfast but this was a very pleasant surprise (delicious pastries, breads, eggs, bacon, cereal, cheese, meats) and I wouldn’t recommend upgrading to a full breakfast downstairs (25 euros), especially as you can enjoy breakfast in the lounge from the outdoor terrace with panoramic views. The tapas and alcoholic drinks were of very good quality and served from 6-8pm (drinks until 10pm). I would definitely recommend paying the upgrade for these benefits.

The location is great for a holiday, close enough to the city but quiet for a good night's rest, and with a large pool. Barcelonetta is just 10 minutes away on the metro (get the 10-ticket pass for 10 euros, it's great value for money). There are plenty of restaurants in the large Forum shopping centre across the road which are fine for a quick meal but the food in the hotel was of very good quality and not a great deal more expensive. However drinks in the hotel are extortionate.

A few things which were lacking were that wi-fi is only free for 8 hours a day in public areas and is 25 euros in your room! But the shopping centre across the road as super-fast free wi-fi if needed. The rooms are also a little on the scruffy side now and could really do with a refurb but overall the hotel is a great choice for Barcelona.

If you are travelling with a baby I would bring your own cot as the one they provide is a travel-cot and the mattress did not properly fit the base which could be dangerous particularly for very small babies.",4,2014,09,26
36,Great overall hotel quality,"We stayed there for 2 nights when we were in Barcelona and couldn't reach the other hotel we had booked downtown (all the streets were closed due to Catalonia holiday), so we had to book another hotel room. This one was right next to the beach, a bit out of downtown, so much easier to reach.

We were very impressed by the overall quality of the hotel. Friendly staff, great location, good restaurant, superior quality room, everything was very nice. Room service menu was delicious, and breakfast had a lot of choices.

36,Great Location,"Stayed at this location mid August and on a Friday night thru weekend. Barcelona was fairly empty of locals but tourist activity was fairly brisk, Loved this Hilton, with great view and convienent to get to most places I needed in the city. Breakfast was included and it was very nice. Asked the desk clerk about directions and she was very helpful with both directions and things to do and places to eat. 
Ate in the lobby, which was open and airy. Never made it around to too many places in hotel. 
Otherwise, comfortable room, clean and friendly staff.",5,2014,09,24
36,"Top flight Hotel, Reasonably Priced","The hotel is at the waterfront end of the Diagonal, a major crosstown artery, in a section of the city  that was formerly industrial but recently re-developed into an area of modern high-rise hotels, apartments, a convention center, park, etc.  It has all the amenities you expect of a Hilton, plus a very open feel with a huge pool area and a large plaza facing the entrance.

We arrived early in the morning off a cruise ship and were prepared for the need to entertain ourselves for some hours before getting a room but when reserving on-line I had on a whim checked the optional ""if available"" low-cost room upgrade option, and there was one, immediately available.  That turned out to be a great plus, as we got a huge room with waterfront view on the top floor, plus access to the ""executive lounge"" offering all day nibbles and a 6 to 8 PM happy hour with open bar and heavy hors d'ovures which for us, after a day of sightseeing, substituted for a formal dinner.  

They appeared to have a very nice breakfast included but unfortunately our ""oh-dark-thirty"" departure precluded any possibility of trying it.

Absolutely no complaints on this stay; the entire staff was friendly & efficient, the facility new & spotless, and I would definitely stay again.",5,2014,09,24
36,Best hotel we have found in Barcelona,"This Hilton is situated in a very lovely part of Barcelona, very near the centre but still far away enough to be little less ‘touristy’. Service at reception was fast and helpful and the lobby is charming, light and modern. The room was excellent and very well appointed. The shower was large and almost like a ‘wet bathroom’. Plenty of space for hanging your clothes, and the usual, but much appreciated in room tea and coffee making facilities. Breakfast was good and with plenty of choices. They have their own bar in the square outside the hotel entrance, and it was a lovely spot to sit and enjoy a cocktail and watch the world go by. Highly recommended.",5,2014,09,24
36,Excellent Stay,"Hilton Diagonal Mar was my choice stay for the end of my solo Eurotrip.  The Hilton was beautiful and the rooms extremely spacious.  The staff from the cleaning crew, bartenders and pool staff to reception were all very helpful.  The pool and outdoor patio was perfect to soak up the sun. Plenty of nice restaurants right across the street. Very close to the beach and metro if you wanted to go anywhere in city. 

Taxis to the airport from this location was around 36 euros. If you pack a bit lighter and can maneuver on the metro with your luggage then there is a bus right from Plaza espana that goes to the airport for about 6 euros.

Would absolutely recommend. ",5,2014,09,22
36,Week Break,"Stayed for 6 days here. Looks like a typical Hilton hotel, rooms and bathrooms very nice. Always seemed to be long queues at the check in / out desk , need to review and have more on during busy periods.
Need to pay more attention to detail for the price, missing items from room after daily cleaning, key stopped working at points, tea and coffee not topped up in room.
The buffet in the restaurant was very average - a la carte menu was excellent.
Great location for the beach, would stay again.",4,2014,09,22
36,go straight to the Diagonal,"got there early, they let us check in right away.bell man was very helpful. the room we got had been 

occupied by a smoker(against the rules) so we were taken to a room on the 13th fl. overlooking the water. breakfast was very nice. included in the price. our tour person showed up early . we were located and informed by staff promptly. 
also we purchased ""hop on hop off ""tickets in the lobby.then lost them. the agent at the other desk  solved our problem  and made up new passes. 
no neg. experiences here.",4,2014,09,21
36,"Beach time in Barcelona, Spain","Everything was ready for us, clean, modern and updated.  (Bath didn't have a fan, but the towels were fluffy and the rainhead shower was terrific.  Polite staff - very good English. 
Hilton Honors members receive key to the great breakfast and cocktail menus with balcony and awesome view.  One can see the Sagrada Familia and the blue ocean from the same seat.  
The large Diagonal Mall and terrific shopping is just across the street.  The lobby is friendly, with large wonderful windows.   We asked for ocean side rather than city side (shopping center) view.  (Maybe August vacation is NOT the best time to travel through Europe as a tourist.)",5,2014,09,21
36,Upgrade to a suite if you can...,"Just returned from a 2 night stay with my two teenager children. Booked a Junior suite which was a corner room 1320 and had wonderful views of the beach and the streets.  We loved the executive room where free hot food snacks were served 6pm -8pm and drinks 6pm-10pm (although at times the cava and hot food quickly disappeared, it didnt take the lovely staff long to refill).  The outside lounge area of the Exective bar was also great location in the evenings.  We enjoyed an afternoon around the pool, where there was plenty of towels and free sunloungers.  Also picked up our free drinks voucher from the executive lounge (if you take breakfast before 8am week days/9am weekends) and this entitled us to a free cocktail at the pool bar so well worth it, especially as these are 13 euros each!!.",5,2014,09,21
36,"Nice hotel, outside a problem","Rooms spacious by European standards. Staff all very helpful. The breakfast in the concierge lounge is sparse, but the main dining room breakfast will keep you going. Located outside the tourist part of town, its right next to the new Barcelona Convention Centre, so its very convenient for shows held there and a Metro line stop is very close by.

The problem is that the main sewage treatment plant for Barcelona is just north of there, and it was hard to go outside due to the smell. Couldn't sit on the balcony of the Concierge Lounge either for the same reason. Not sure why, but there is a poolside bar on the 2nd floor that doesn't share the problem.",4,2014,09,21
36,Enjoyable 7 Day Stay,We stayed for a 7 night holiday In a King Executive room which was quite basic and business like compared to other Hilton's.  Other quests seemed to be either staying for a couple of days either side of a cruise or attending a conference at the International Centre next door.  We emailed the hotel in advance to ask for early check-in and our room was ready on arrival at 2p.m. so we had no issues with waiting for our room to be ready.  Housekeeping was good and toiletries replenished each day.  We used the metro L4 Forum each morning to get into the city for sightseeing and then had a couple of hours round the pool in the afternoon.  Always sunbeds available and towels provided from the pool attendant.  Executive lounge had a limited selection at breakfast - could be improved by offering different selection occasionally but the tapas in the evenings was excellent. We had hoped that our Gold Honours status would allow us to take breakfast in the main dining room on Level 1 but we were told on check in that this would incur an extra cost of 20 Euro pp per day.  The one thing that we would like to see change is the hotel's smoking policy.  Smokers next to you when eating breakfast on the terrace in the exec lounge and also by the pool is something that we are not used to and I hope that the management will look at this for the future. Otherwise a very good stay.,4,2014,09,21
36,pretty good,"It's a modern hotel somewhat out of the city centre but with most important parts of the city easily accessible by taxi. The rooms are large, clean and well equipped with excellent bathrooms. The restaurant similarly is very good (serving unusually well designed and executed dishes for a hotel eaterie) and seems under utilized. Similarly breakfasts have all the normal range of hot and cold goodies that you'd expect from a large Hilton. Just a few glitches marred my stay: Why is the pool only open 8-8? This strange rule means that it is impossible to use before going off to meetings etc, which is a disadvantage for anyone coming on business to a hotel with such a lovely pool. Why is there only a front desk? The waiting time can be anything up to 15 minutes which is really irritating if all you want to do is to sort out a simple query. And beware if you want (and pay for) a late checkout: your keycard will automatically stop working at mid-day, which means waiting for the lift, queueing and having it recoded. And one more thing: the WiFi-why so expensive when many lesser known branded hotels offer it free?",4,2014,09,20
36,Chic hotel,"By the beach, nice little mall with a buffet across the street. Overall good security and service. Rooms had wood paneling and modern design with marble bath, reminds me of a place that Christian grey type may stay.",4,2014,09,20
36,"As I write, we are staying at the Hilton Diagonal Hotel","We were here before, and liked it. The hotel itself is modern, comfortable and very good. But something has to be done to get service from the front desk. To start, this hotel does not have a concierge, so the things that a concierge would do have to be asked from the girls at the front desk. They barely speak Spanish, and some do not speak English either. I tried to ask them if they could find out on which pier did the Celebrity cruises generally leave from the Port of Barcelona and the reply was to ask the taxi. I heard there are several terminals in Barcelona!  
The second thing which is outrageous is the price of the internet. We were staying for 2 nights and had to pay a 3 night package! And it was not cheap. All the other hotels in our trip to Spain have been free, except the Hilton in Toledo and this one. 
Otherwise the service is good, they sent me a bottle of white wine and a piece of cake for my birthday, so this hotel has the makings of being a great hotel, but a concierge is essential, or else someone at the front desk who can handle requests.I am apprehensive of waiting until the last minute to start looking for the pier!
Food at the hotel should also be improved, it was good but considering the gourmet cuisine in the city, it should not be difficult to get a first rate chef.",4,2014,09,19
36,Great Breakfast! questions on woman traveling alone,"The hotel is near the beach but not close to any other action.  My colleagues took taxis to sites, mostly Gaudi projects, which cost them in the 200 euro range over 2 days.  I took the metro which was just on the other side of the shopping mall and it was super easy,  
The pool was nice and great after a day of site seeing but closed at 6:00pm.  We were there in September so it was still quite hot and well in the peak tourist season.  I suggest they just allow you to swim without a lifeguard.  

Several times I was overlooked in the bar and at breakfast.  I wondered if this was because I was a woman on her own.  Everyone else seemed to get great service.  Once I went to the bar to get a drink as the waitress was concentrating on large groups and she threw our my annotated maps and a small makeup bag.  Bar was not that busy.",3,2014,09,18
36,Hilton in Barcelona near the beach,"Few times I have visited Barcelona, but this is the first time I have stayed at Hilton Diagonal Mar. Few minutes away from Rambla or Plaza Catalunya by taxi but we have chosen this hotel because it is near the beach. There is also a commercial center nearby, so location is not bad at all.
Service is great, nothing to complain. Room is spacious and clean with a sea view. My mom and my daughter wanted to eat paella, so we had dinner at the restaurant near the pool which ended up to be a delicious serving.
We have enjoyed our stay in this hotel, I will definitely go back here.",4,2014,09,17
36,Great Hotel,"Excellent hotel which we stayed in prior to a cruise.
It is someway out of the city centre  although it is located next to a shopping mall 
Rooms bars and general service were excellent .
Check in was very efficient",5,2014,09,16
36,Hilton Diagonal Mar,"Excellent quality, cleanliness and service. Friendly, helpful staff. Conference facilities were good - although the room we had was a little small for the size of the group. The inclusion of breakfast in the room rate would have provided better value for money - as it was an additional €25 for breakfast felt expensive",5,2014,09,16
36,"Great hotel, very accommodating.","Very clean, did everything they could to help us with our rooms.  Disney uses this hotel in their package so it can be crowded on port days. We did have to wait a while for our room the first time we stayed at the beginning of our trip.",4,2014,09,15
36,"Standard hilton, super bartender!","in accordance with Hilton standard for the room, nice staff there, special thanks to David, bartender, at the pool or at the lobby, will always find the cocktail or the attention to make your stay even more pleasant!",4,2014,09,15
36,Extremely expensive room wi-fi,"25€/night per person for 3 devices for in room wi-fi! Free in lobby. This is outrageous from a chain like Hilton. We arrived from Canada at 5pm, 1 room was ready and one room was not for another hour. At  5pm? Reservation was made 4 months ago. No garbage or recycling can in room. Just small bathroom garbage can. One small soap so share from bath to wash bassin. Hilton can surely do better.",2,2014,09,15
36,Wonderful hotel in great location near shopping mall and beach,"We came for 4 day stay for our anniversary. On arrival we had a wonderful welcome and were thrilled to unexpectedly find an excellent bottle of champagne and anniversary cake in our arrival. We booked executive room which had the benefit of an excellent club room with outside terrace area. The pool, restaurant and bar was lovely. There is also an excellent gym.The hotel staff are very friendly, helpful and professional. The hotel has benefit of supplying English and other newspapers.  The Internet is free in public areas but has a steep 25 Euros daily cost for use outside these areas. Unfortunately I made mistake of assuming I needed to put in room no when on couple of occasions it logged
me out in exec lounge & at pool.
So was shocked when I got a  50 euro charge!! So will be careful in future. However did not spoil our time there and highly recommend. There are lots of taxis outside so easy to get around. Also bus stop opposite and tram stop round the corner. We will have no hesitation returning again.
Thanks to everyone at the hotel for making our anniversary such a lovely and memorable occasion.",5,2014,09,14
36,"Good stay, service needs some tweaking","We stayed two nights at the Hilton Diagonal Mar on a pre-cruise stay late August, booked through our travel agent in conjunction with a deal Disney was offering when we booked the cruise.  I checked at the time and the rate was only slightly lower than if I booked the hotel direct - it included breakfast.  The hotel itself, rooms, amenities, restaurant are all up to date, clean, well-maintained and overall the atmosphere is very pleasant.  We ate breakfast in the restaurant both days - it was very busy but the staff handled it well and there was plenty of space, some outdoor. It was buffet style, lots of selection for many cultures.  The servers at the restaurant and the bar were very courteous and service there was good.  We used the pool and the area was nice - towels available and plenty of loungers.  The attendant came around about an hour before closing time to let everyone know it would be closing.  

Overall we had a few things that prevented me from rating it an excellent and will make me think twice about a repeat stay.  1) Wifi is only free in the lobby otherwise very expensive.  2)Due to the fact that we were 4 people, we had to book 2 rooms so we had requested connecting rooms.  I knew at the time it was not guaranteed but wasn't worried since I knew we weren't arriving very late.  We arrived slightly later than planned, at 5:30 pm and were told no connecting rooms; again I need to be clear it wasn't guaranteed but I found it odd given we weren't' there at 10 pm checking in.  They then assigned us a king room and a room with two twin beds but down the hall from each other.  I explained if we didn't have connecting rooms I was not going to let my kids sleep down the hall in two twin beds several rooms away from us.  They then found us two queen rooms - the short of this is that it took a while.  And if the connecting rooms were gone, we should have been reserved rooms at least side by side where we eventually ended up.  One room had an issue with the toilet - it kept coming on which they promptly fixed, so no issue there.  
The bigger service issue came with the luggage service and our last morning there.  We had NOT arranged transportation through the hotel or the cruise yet on the morning of our cruise, despite having do not disturb signs on our doors, we were awakened by hotel staff pounding on our doors at 8:30 and asking for our luggage to take to the ""truck"".  Literally awake for 2 minutes, I explained that there must be a mistake, only to be told ""You are on my list and I need your luggage or you'll have an issue with the cruise, I can come back in 10 minutes but that's all the time I can give you"" - no offer to check or anything.  We hurried, got dressed and quickly packed a day bag plus our luggage.  After they came back I followed them downstairs and asked both the Disney representative and the front desk what was going on.  Disney blamed the hotel and the hotel blamed Disney.  I still have no idea what caused the mix up and neither the hotel or Disney did anything except shrug and say ""I'm very sorry.""  The hotel said they would send our luggage back up to our rooms and since we were awake we went to breakfast and planned to head to the beach.  Upon return to our room, we had 3 of our bags and 1 bag that was someone else's.  I called, they came, and took the foreign bag, and asked for a description of mine.  They then called the room after leaving to get a description again. 15-20 minutes later they finally found the missing bag and delivered it.
At check out I explained the issue again - the front desk said they were sorry - still no manager alerted or explanation.
I travel a lot and admittedly, I have high expectations but I think this could be an excellent property if they could improve service.  I know it's a chain, and I know with the cruise deals they are probably always full (people were pouring in for post-cruise stays as we were leaving) but I hope they take it from good to great.",4,2014,09,13
36,"Excellent hotel, however Barcelona is the PICKPOCKET capitol of the world","Hotel is picture perfect, excellent location, great staff, clean hotel.  When you check in they should say this, do not leave the hotel with your CELL PHONE, CREDIT CARDS, PURSES etc  The locals will set you up and rob you.  The police do not care, if its less then 600 Euros then it means nothing. If you want to play it safe, take taxis to and from the airport, and walk around with nothing valuable.   So in any subway they purposely will set you up being a tourist.  Its a shame such a great hotel, pristine beaches and a local government in Spain that just doesn't care.  Sad, very sad!  Safer places to visit in Europe!!!!  ",5,2014,09,12
36,Expensive and charges for wifi as extra!,"The staff were really nice and helpful, but I couldn't get over the fact that they are an expensive hotel which charge a ridiculous €25/day for wifi! Unbelieveable!

Location is nice right by the shopping mall and beach, but journey into town needs a taxi.",3,2014,09,11
36,Nicer than the other one!,"We stayed here as part of our Disney Cruise Line shore extension package. We stayed one night before our Mediterranean cruise at the other Disney recommended hotel (the Renaissance Barcelona) and one night here after the cruise before our flight home. This one was far nicer, it's across the street from an indoor mall (which sounds lame, except they have some stores we love that they don't have in the U.S., so it worked out wonderfully for us), and some areas of the hotel have a gorgeous sea view.  The restaurant was exquisite for a late lunch/early dinner, and was included in our room rate as a buffet for breakfast the next morning. The only drawback, which might be a Spain thing instead of a hotel service thing, was that one of our rooms (we had two rooms between 4 people) wasn't available for check-in until well after 5pm, and the room itself (before giving us the keys) was changed several times, because the people who were in it before us weren't sure if they were going to extend their stay or not! (In the U.S. they primarily kick you out at check-out if you haven't made prior arrangements, instead of waiting to see if they *might* decide to stay another night or not!) After all was said and done, however, the rooms were much more spacious, the bathrooms were lovely, and the beds were extremely comfortable. If you have a choice between this one and the Renaissance Barcelona, choose this one!",4,2014,09,10
36,End of cruise stay over,"Disappointed in the hotel. Over priced, especially the extras. Soulless and definitely targeted for the business traveller who doesn't necessarily look at the costs. My credit card was attempted to be charged twice more than required, which caused it to get blocked for security reasons.",3,2014,09,09
36,Nice but no free internet.,"Location is great! walking distance to the beach, and there is a very large shopping center across the street.

Friendly staff, clean rooms, nice buffet breakfast....except for the scrambled eggs...you could cut it with a knife!.

If you only speak English, you will not enjoy the TV...Unless you only watch News channels. Not much light entertainment here!!",3,2014,09,07
36,"Out of Town, Corporate Hotel","Stayed at this hotel, pre Cruise, for three days.  Hotel is impressive, minimal, but comfortable.

The hotel is located  way out of town, with one of Barcelona's roughest areas between the hotel and the main tourist areas of Barcelona.  We were advised on three occasions NOT to try to walk up the 'Diagonal' and to take Taxis. Making this an expensive base for exploring the town.  (The Red Tourist Bus does leave from just outside the hotel, but take an hour to get to the centre of town.) 

There is a beach very near by, but with no facilities (no showers/toilets/coffee bars etc...) 

Directly opposite the hotel is a huge shopping centre.  Well worth a visit when its too hot, or raining. (or both).

The hotel is very conference orientated, and there was a lot of 'disco' noise from post conference party (past 11pm) on one night.  (The party's take place out by the pool.) It kept us awake, and we were on the 16th floor.

The pool area itself is very stark and minimal, feeling very exposed and daunting.  

The rooms are on the edge of feeling tired.  (The carpets old and worn), beds are very comfortable, but SMALL ! (singles), air-conditioning is excellent and quiet.  The bathrooms are great. 

Generally the hotel is spotless.  The staff are VERY Welcoming and professional.

Food in the hotel is good. But feels overpriced compared to what is on offer in the vicinity.

Breakfasts are particularly expensive.  Buffet breakfast is €25.00 at the time of writing, making out breakfast bill for two, over three days €150 !  

The charges for internet use are also unbelievably high.  Travellers need the internet just as much as water and electricity.  But this Hilton charge €25 PER DAY  for access.  Perversely, anyone can walk in off of the street and use the free wi-fi provided in the lobby and bar areas.  (The password is freely available on the bars and reception desk) .  I think the hotel needs to re-think there internet charges  ASAP.

We enjoyed the stay, but don't think we would choose this hotel again.  It is just too corporate..",4,2014,09,06
36,Hilton Diagonal Mar....enjoyable stay,"I stayed at the HIlton Diagonal Mar for business. I was there for 7 days for a business conference. The hotel was close to the congress site,but a distance from the city center of Barcelona and most of the restaurants. It is a lovely hotel, great amenities, nice lobby with bar. Rooms were a nice size and large bathroom with separate soaking tub and shower.",4,2014,09,05
36,"Great stay, but marred by price of water!","Had a great in this hotel.  Rooms are nice and very convenient for the beach and pool.  Eating at the pool was expensive so avoid that - go over the road where you'll find some nice places to eat.

Exec lounge very good, but restricted hours (be warned) for alcohol. Hilton cost saving measures I suspect.

Pool very good - can get crowded on certain days, suspect this is when the cruises changeover.

Worst thing (which is why drop from 4* to 3*) is being charged almost €6 for a small bottle of water from the mini bar which, over the road, is approx. 47 cents.  Being a frequent Hilton stayer, and expecting that the ""first night's water"" was free is OK, but then being told that's per Hilton HHonors guest and not per room associated with the gues was outrageous (we had a separate room for the children).  Spending almost €2000 and being told that was not negotiable.  It's the principle, I half wanting to drop another star for that point alone.",3,2014,09,05
36,Highly rated hotel,"have enjoyed two stays at this hotel a one night pre cruise last year and 3 nights this year.
Great family sized room, helpful staff, nice pool area, shopping centre right opposite with a good selection of shops and places to eat.
had to wait till 4pm before our room was available.
Its about a 10 min walk to the metro station.
Would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a Barcelona stay",5,2014,09,02
36,second stay,"This was the second stay here before a cruise. We were on the corner of the 16th floor this year. The rooms are nice, beds comfortable but I knocked off 1 mark as I don't like heights but usually just stay away from the Windows - the room this year had a bath that had a window running down the side of it - and no blind (so if it's dark anyone looking up from the shopping center will get an eye full) I really like to chill in the bath but felt quite sick being that close to the window - on the positive if I were a shower fan there was a cubicle beside the bath that didn't have a view of the outside world. There was also a phone beside the loo if that's where you like to make calls.
The breakfast was very good, lots of quality food buffet style.
For coffee fans that have reviewed this hotel and said coffee is expensive there is a Starbucks in the shopping center across the road. There is also a supermarket that we got bottled water in and snacks for our cruise. There is also many restaurants. We ate in an Italian restaurant in the shopping center this year and got good food at reasonable cost.
The reception generally runs very slow, but we checked our bill was zero on our way to breakfast and could post our keys into box 'express checkout'.",4,2014,09,02
36,Isolated a bit but typical Hilton,"I have stayed at this hotel a couple of times in Barcelona. It is located near a beach but not the main one where the piers are and most restaurants are.  You have to take a taxi to find a decent restaurant to enjoy dinner at. I was attending a meeting at the Congress centre in Barcelona so it was a 25 Euro trip each way for the daily meetings. 

The in-room wi-fi did not work despite attempts by the call center in India who kindly assisted me. The hotel waived the daily 40 Euro charge for internet and breakfast. I used the wi-fi in the Lobby bar and enjoyed an evening beverage while I did work email and personal email. 

The staff make this hotel a 4 rating - they are exceptional for Spain. They are friendly, kind, courteous and multi-lingual. They took time to assist me with food ordering at the hotel restaurant and with suggesting other restaurants to eat it within the Barcelona region.

It is a good hotel for a business trip if you want to be in a quiet locale and away from the center city. You cannot walk to any restaurants or bars for music. There is a shopping mall across the street if you want to shop at an urban mall and a McDonald's with the mall if you or your kids need a hamburger or Latte.",4,2014,09,02
36,pre-cruise guests,"Ok, so I first have to disclose that I was also a pre-cruise guest (NCL) but was a bit annoyed by all the Disney cruise guests who really seemed to stress out most of the front desk staff.  We arrived early and tried to check in early and were told to come back in 2 hours, we ended up waiting at least another 2 additional hours (4 hours total).  It wasn't until my husband approached the front desk (as I had done so twice already) to inquire about the status of our room that we were finally offered access to the executive lounge on the same floor as our room.  It would have been really nice if we were offered access to the lounge as an option to wait for our room a lot earlier, as the concierge staff told us our room was ready after only a few minutes waiting in the lounge.  So, lesson learned...  if you have executive lounge access as part of your booking, ask for it up front if you have to wait for your room.  

Once all those cruisers left by the next day the place was quite again and everyone seems to breath a sign of relief.  The bar staff told us about some great local wines and the room service staff were very pleasant and professional.  

The room was an ocean view and I also enjoyed the executive lounge outdoor deck as there were great views of both the ocean and the city including sagrada familia.  

I liked the proximity to the beach and the mall across the street.  

Overall the hotel was nice and we had a good experience.  Just try to avoid Fridays and Saturdays for arrival or departure to avoid the chaos.",4,2014,09,01
36,Very nice with great service,"We found our one-night stay at this hotel a very pleasant experience.  We arrived at 9 am after an overnight flight from the US and they were able to get us one of our rooms immediately.  We had booked 2 rooms to accommodate our family of 5 and they were located together in a suite-like setting with a door that closed them off from the rest of the hallway.  It was VERY nice to have the rooms situated this way.  All of the desk staff were helpful with any type of request we had (how to use the subway, changing money, storing luggage, etc).  We loved being able to walk to the beach and we found several decently priced dining options across the street, or within a couple of blocks.  The rooms were stylish and comfortable.  The sunrise view from the rooms were beautiful!",5,2014,09,01
36,Hilton diagonal,"Beautiful hotel. We støyende for a week and enjoyed every minute. Near a lovely beach and not far from the city.  Fine Roms and the pol arena is wonderfull . Liked the area, near the shooppingcenter Diagonal Mar. We will be back.",5,2014,09,01
36,Indigo restaurant,"I had a lunch at the Indigo restaurant LEVEL 1 of this fine hotel.\Two young men Victor and Bruno served me lunch.These two young guys were extremely friendly and helpful. The quality of the food was nice but became more delicious by the hospitality of these two young men.
I recommend the travelers to try this restaurant. You won't regret. Service was really wonderful, thanks to the friendly attitude of these two bright young men.

36,Nice property close to beach and strip mal,"This property is typical Hilton style with nice rooms comfortable rooms with bath room and amminities as you can expect from Hilton. On thh seccond floor you will find the pool and fitness area which are very plesant at the same time.  I found the gym a little outdated and small, with such a property Hilton should make more out of the gym and view from the gym.  Also had accesss to lounge on the 15th floor that had a nice outside sitting area.  Especially late at night with a glas of wine you can easily forget where you are.",4,2014,09,01
36,Stylish Hotel with abit of class,"Stayed here at the end of August. Stylish hotel that is on the outskirts of Barcelona. Metro is a 15 minute walk. Food for vegetarians is good and varied .
Small pool but enough for quick splash and sun bathing area.
Sharp mini bar that charges even if you move an item so beware but reception is good at making any valid refunds",4,2014,09,01
36,Hilton like a Hilton,"I spent 2 nights at this property end of August. I got special deal, so I can say it was really a value for money for me. Room standard Hilton as you could used everywhere in Europe, which I think not bad at all. Room was well kept - clean and well stocked, although a bathrobe would have been a nice touch to use, while visiting the pool (A/C continously on everywhere in the hotel). The bed is comfy and the mirror in the bathroom had a heating, which is definitetly a positive! Also the shower curtain, finally a proper one in a hotel. Minibar did not have Red bull, which is pretty minor I know, but still a room for improvement! Pool area is great to relax & chill yourself. The bar at the pool is very easygoing with a very knowledgeable bartender, had a very delicious G&T, he played very well with the sweet, bitter, sour flavours! I think there is way more potential in the pool area - like creating a beach club atmosphere & so on...The lobby bar is a functional Hilton bar with low staffing level - which is not necessarely bad at all. The service is very friendly, timing and drinks are ok. Breakfast is usual Hilton breakfast with a local touch - I was able to find everything I need for a great start of the day. The ""service"" is very minimal - Saturday in the morning was hard to grab a clean table, but the issue was sorted out very quickly. The take away coffee cups are a very customer friendly idea, but a fitting top would be more useful!!! 
Check in & check out was pretty quick, the agents both times were very effective - no issues happened. Front of the reception you can find 4 computers to check your emails or surf on the internet, printing your boarding pass, etc. The printer did not work properly, while I was there, actually I fixed both times by myself, small thing, but once you are in a hotel, probably you would expect, that somebody else (from the hotel staff) is going to own the ""problem"" and sort it out for you. By the way Wi-fi worked very good in all areas. All in all a good hotel in a nice location, but do not really expect a special, personal touch, just stay there and enjoy the amazing and beautiful Barcelona. Would I return & offer to friends & family? Yes, I would.",4,2014,08,31
36,Now that I'm here!,"Now that I'm here and spent just one night, I can tell you that I was really intrigued by the recent reviews I've read before arriving here. 

The staff are so welcoming, helpful and nice. 

The rooms are spacious and very clean. 

The bathroom is clean with plenty of toilet paper. So it doesn't smell of pee like I've read. Thanks to the reviews I had to carry a roll of toilet paper, which looks like I don't need. 

Breakfast buffet is a vast variety and the egg making guy is there. Some reviewer complained there wasn't one!!!!

I'm on the 13th floor and elevators cannot be faster. 

The only drawbacks are: no free wifi in rooms :(
Windows aren't clean on the outside, a little bit annoying when trying to view sunrise.  

End result: trust a hilton no matter what reviews you've read!!!",5,2014,08,30
36,Always reliable,Yet again the Hilton proved reliable and an excellent choice for a recent stay in Barcelona.  Not in the center of the city but close to the cruise port and with all the amenities you need including an awesome pool and outstanding lounge overlooking the ocean.,4,2014,08,29
36,There are better places to stay,"Disappointed by recent 10 day stay at Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona.  Location is not very convenient to older and more charming parts of city.  Very few good restaurants nearby - the only one I can recommend is Raco de la Villa (about a mile from the hotel).  Rooms were clean and comfortable, but the entire hotel is serviced by only 4 elevators resulting in long waits and crowded lifts. There is a $33USD/24hr charge for WiFi (ridiculous!!). Front desk staff is rather indifferent (likely because they are used to complaints).  MAKE SURE THAT YOU REVIEW YOUR BILL AT CHECK-OUT.  We found $75USD in mini-bar charges that were never consumed.",2,2014,08,26
36,Worst Customer Service I ever experienced at a hotel,"The staff at this hotel needs to be re-trained on how to treat and talk to customers.  Locked out of my room for 8 hours with a child and no money.  In the last 2 hours (12-2 am) was offered free drinks while they fixed my door.  At the end of the night was told I had to pay for 2 of them.  Had no money or credit cards as they were locked in the safe in the room.  Rude manager.  Toilet paper is never put in the rooms.  Everyday had to call house keeping to get toilet paper.  Bathroom smelt like urine even after it was cleaned. All rooms are only for 2 people have to order a cot for 3 (if they get around to it you might get the one you ordered in your room).  Food and drinks are very expensive and not good.  Not worth the money we spent here.  Save your money and stay at the Princess just down the street from this hotel and get treated like the Princess or Prince. At the Hilton Diagonal Mar the only thing you can count on is rude staff that don't resolve any issues.  Also, had friends that stayed there with kids (with asthma) were given a smoking room.  When our friends complained about the smokey room just looking to be moved to another room the staff said they were just looking for problems.  Then my friend said if my child stays in this room tonight they will end up in the hospital.  The Hilton staff replied ""I guess you are going to the hospital tonight"".  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS HOTEL!!!",1,2014,08,26
36,"Good Hotel, Great Staff, Excellent Location","This was my second visit to this hotel and it did not disappoint. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the location made it easy to get to sites in the city as well as enjoy the beach. I highly recommend this hotel for its standards, service and value for money.",5,2014,08,26
36,Nice beach location,"Great spot to end our European vacation . Near the beach with sweeping ocean view from higher floors . Great pool area . Rooms and bathroom are large and well  furnished  . Outside the main old city area  so planing taking taxis ,  which are abundant outshine and reasonable . Also long block to the Metro line L4 ,    which we used a lot ,  Food and drink is expensive at the hotel , but  the large Diagonal Mall is right across the street . It  many restaurant and bar choices . This is where we had most meals . They have a Starbucks and a  believe it or not a Dunkin  Donuts ( first we saw in Europe )     This is a very busy hotel with lots of groups and cruise passengers , so the lobby can be congested at times . Overall was an enjoyable stay . Lounging by the pool and walking the beach was  a great respite  after sightseeing   .",5,2014,08,25
36,Brilliant!,"Went there 2weeks ago on our honeymoon, I asked for a high floor when I booked as it was our honeymoon they put us on the 17 the floor which was great and we also had a bottle of wine on ice and a lovely cheesecake on arrival of our room which was a very nice touch. Great location only 5 mins from beach which we hired a king size lounger outside the beach bar & drank cocktails. Staff very helpful and polite and the breakfast buffet amazing! Only slight downside was drinks including water expensive but all in all a great trip and would definitely go back.
P",5,2014,08,25
36,Promises so much and delivers little...,Have stayed here several times and sadly every time there has been problems with wrong room type allocation and lack of amenities in the room... even the pre-arrival orders be email offered as a service a few days before arrival... if you can't deliver don't send it!,3,2014,08,25
36,ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!,"I have never had a worse experience with a hotel! I asked where the ice machine was and was sent to a floor that guests cannot gain access to. Next I asked for extra toilet paper to be sent to my room because I was only given half a role and they came back with a half of a role! The worst part of my experience was that I left my purse in my room when I checked out and I thought I had left it in my cab. After calling the cab company and the hotel both had said they didn't see it. I called the hotel twice more and they said they checked my room and it wasn't there! It wasnt until the taxi drove all the way back to the hotel and demanded that they check the cameras did they discover that I didnt have it with me when I left the room, it was still in there. Therefore they never actually checked even though we called 3 times! I have never had a worse experience with a hotel and I will never stay with hilton again!",1,2014,08,24
36,Great hotel in great location.,"This new hotel is very modern and located in a great neighborhood. As a diamond member, i was not acknowledged, nor upgraded as usually happens in the U.S. The staff was polite, but not helpful. I was told all rooms were the same, which I was told the next day, was not true.",4,2014,08,23
36,Could be better,"I have stayed at the Hilton DM many times over the years. This year I feel that the normal standards you expect in Hilton's have  slipped somewhat at the DM. Also there was no recognition or benefits whatsoever for being HH Gold except the Wifi as an executive room was booked.

However the Hotel still has some plus points which I will start with:

Large modern rooms (some better than others) with good views of the sea or City from the higher floors.
Super fast Wifi in the room.
Friendly and mostly helpful staff and especially professional Cecelia in the Executive lounge.
Excellent exec lounge with panoramic views but very busy in the early evening especially with uncontrolled young children,  however the re-introduction of spirits was appreciated.
Perfect location in a nice area away from the multitudes and close to to the beach, the Mall and various modes of transport to the City (also nice walk along the beach to the bottom of the Las Ramblas, (avert your gaze when passing the nudist beach!)

Negative points.

The large Pagoda (built last year and totally unused during my 10 day stay) has significantly reduced the pool area for sunbathers by 60-70% and subsequently on most days there were no sun beds available after 11.00 am.
Monotonous synthesised nondescript music is continuously played excessively loud around the pool area.
The Breakfast selection in the restaurant is poor value for 25€ and not consistent with other European Hilton's mainly:
Only Chicken sausages (yuk) available for the whole of my 10 day stay.
Cold meat Ham and Turkey plastic in appearance and obviously low grade from a tin.
Fruit mostly tinned except melon and pineapple (fresh strawberries one day) and only one item of fresh whole fruit each day.
No yoghurt pots and reduced selection of cakes and pastries on a number of days.
The egg/omelette cook station was conspicuous by its absence during the whole of this stay.

To summarise, at this time of year the Hotel caters for mainly Holiday makers where as the majority of the time the clientele is business orientated and as such paying much higher room rates resulting in the possibility that overall service is being tweeked accordingly during the main Holiday period.",3,2014,08,21
36,Hilton Close to beach,Hotel is ok. Nothing special. Stayed in better Hiltons. Food is very expensive and quality not worth the price. Go outside and find some local restaurants. Same quality of food but only much cheaper. Service is good. Rooms are average. Beds are good. Nice pool. 5 min walk from the beach. Mall across the road. Nice to buy some cheese and bread. Better than lunch at hotel.,3,2014,08,20
36,Very nice hotel.,"We spent three nights at this hotel and were very pleased with our room, service and especially the executive lounge.  We travel a lot and this hotel, by far, had the best selection we have come across.  It is not located in the city center, however, there are sight seeing tour buses or the metro within walking distance.  We did the bus tour one day and it was totally worthwhile.  One of the hotel staff helped us get tickets online for the La Sagrada Familia and it saved us a few hours waiting in line without tickets!  There is so much to do in Barcelona, the beach was also very nice, lots of people trying to sell items, but did not bother you if you were not interested.",5,2014,08,19
36,Looks the part but fails to deliver,"The entrance to the hotel is very impressive but the check-in was a slow and dismal experience, no welcoming smiles just a long wait while our reservations and passports were checked from cover to cover. I am currently a Hilton diamond member and we were upgraded to a room on a high floor with a sea view - whilst we could see the sea the outlook is mainly office blocks, the motorway to the city, and the car park. I'm glad I didn't pay for the view! 
As a diamond member, we had access to the Exec Lounge. A relatively small lounge given the size of the hotel, hence it was frequently overcrowded - at peak hours there was a queue for seating.
The exec lounge breakfast was poor for a Hilton, very limited choice of hot or cold food and cheap machine coffee. It was so bad we only went a couple of times. In the evening the lounge provided FOUR hours of free drinks - although people were sensible this meant the rather sterile lounge was the busiest place in the hotel. No wonder the main bar was always empty. We had a late drink in the bar one evening$and felt sorry for David - great bar tender, welcoming, informative, great cocktails, but no customers. Why no customers - the prices - wow! The Hilton bar is three times the price of all surrounding bars, and there are many to choose from in the neighbouring streets.
The positives about the hotel - the pool and gym areas of the hotel are new and kept to a high standard. The location is probably not for everyone being at the Northern most reaches of the beach, but you can walk along the beach to the main city beaches in under an hour, The hotel is also close to PobleNou which has a great selection of bars and restaurants within walking distance of the hotel.
In summary - I don't think the hotel is worth the premium price tag. In my opinion the other Barcelona Hilton is a nicer hotel and much better value, I'd recommend staying there and getting a cab to/from the beach.",3,2014,08,19
36,Excellent location,"I stayed at this property while attending a convention.  The hotel is located right around the corner from the convention center and near a number of local restaurants.  The rooms are medium sized, large for Europe.  The bathroom was large and clean and had plenty of water pressure as well as modern amenities.  The overall hotel needs updating, but all in all it was still modern enough.  The concierge lounge, if you can get access is fantastic. Breakfast in the morning was excellent, afternoon happy hour featured wine and beer as well as light snacks.",4,2014,08,18
36,Not for every client! Disappointing stay and SERVICE,"It was our second stay in Hotel Hilton Diagonal Mar. We are Hilton Honours and we had different card status during our first stay and our second stay. First time we were Diamond and this time “only” Gold than Silver. I could not imagine such a difference of service between both! We were extremely disappointed. If I could not know how you are treated when you are “diamond” I could not have comparison. First of all, at the moment reservation we had a gold status and I was offered upgrade for free to executive room. We refused it because the executive room was smaller than deluxe room we initially booked. We were traveling with a baby so we needed a bigger room. Once in Barcelona our HH status changed again and we were silver HH. I was pregnant and we did not travel as often as before. No more upgrade proposed and paid water in the room (daily) plus colder service . We were not allow to access executive lounge, to which I could have an access if I could accept Hilton first offer of upgrade to executive room. I think HH should consider our status at the moment of reservation and not when I checked in. What if I could accept upgrade proposed at the moment of reservation? Hilton could UNDERGRADE me at the moment of check in? Very not nice surprise for regular clients such as us. As I mentioned before we were traveling with our baby (6-months). Lots of dippers in the room, so we needed our room to be refreshed every day or at least every 2 days. This never happened. We were forced to call room service everyday so they could empty trash-can. Very inconvenient. We asked for late checkout, by late I mean 1 hour late! I wanted to warm food for our baby and give him lunch peacefully not at the lobby with people making noise. This was refused in very not nice way. I understood that the hotel was fully booked and late checkout is possible upon the availabilities. However, room service is not cleaning all 200 room at the same time! Front office could make an exception of 1 hour or even 30 minutes as we proposed eventually, but no, they did not wanted to hear about anything. I gave lunch to my 6 month old son at the lobby and I changed him at the bar table. Just to check if they cleaned our room for the next client as they said they will because they needed immediately, I went upstairs to see it. And our room was closed with the card we let on the door. Congratulations for your client service!!! Another disappointment was the Front Office service. Once in the morning I asked for umbrella. I already waited in the line for several minutes. When my turn came I was told to wait because receptionist (4 of them) have to make check outs first! WOW! How long it will take them to handle me umbrella? And anyway, I’m client also too so I don’t understand why they give priority to the clients who are leaving. I DON’T UNDERSTAND because I worked for several years in Parisian Hotel as a Front Office Team Leader  and I never saw something like this. Every client, diamond, golden silver, regular or random SHOULD be treated the same way. I’m not taking about privileges but about basic front office service! Front Office is visit card of the Hotel. This is first image clients are having! Very disappointing stay. Definitely we will never come back to Hilton Diagonal Mar and we WONT advise this hotel to everyone we know and many our friends travel very often to Barcelona. We closed our eyes on many things first time and we came back. We closed our eyes second time on other things as well but this time it was too much. We were especially shocked with the comparison how different types of client are treated depending on their status! Once again not only about privileges but ESPECIALY the way Front Office is talking to you and treating you !!!! This is really SHAME! I wonder if Hilton Groupe knows about this and if they can intervene?",1,2014,08,18
36,Great service,"The rooms were very clean and comfortable, the staff were very attentive and friendly.  I didn't really use much of the hotel to comment on the other facilities.

Its more a business hotel than a family hotel. Its a short tram ride to the main hustle and bustle of Barcelona. I used taxi's a lot to get a good choice of restaurants.",4,2014,08,17
36,"Andrianna Byron ""fantastic hotel""","This hotel was class A. The rooms are spacious and lovely and clean. The breakfast is brilliant so much choice available and very good quality food. As for the staff they cannot do enough to help you they are polite, courteous and very accommodating. The pool is nice and all towels are supplied. The only thing is that the bar drinks and restaurant are very very expensive and that you need a lot of money if you choose to eat.
Locally there are good shopping facilities. Most restaurants ok but let me warn you of la casa del pescado (opp the hotel) what a load of tripe. The fish is disgusting they served whitebait which were chewy (they looked more like burnt tadpoles) the paella was horrible it was even served with closed mussels, the kalamari was served with potatoes swimming in oil and the salads were foul smelling with old recycled oil used for a dressing and served with a stinky egg and wet brocolli and cauliflower (who puts frozen veg in a salad). Anyway it was rubbish and expensive so don't go in there. 
But as for the hotel it's lovely.",5,2014,08,16
36,Surprised!,"We are currently staying in the Hilton until Wednesday. We love our room but feel a second class citizen as we are unable to have a drink in the Executive Lounge? 
When booking, we did request the upgrade, but were disappointed to find on check in that as we are a party of 3, no rooms could accommodate 3? 
As we are more than happy with the size, cleanliness and service of the Hilton, why are we barred from using all facilities? ",4,2014,08,16
36,Hilton diagonal mar Barcelona,"Arrived here for our annual summer holiday ( taxi from airport approx. 30 euro)......found out the night before I was pre upgraded to a junior suite on the 10th floor......quick check in and off to room to unpack.
Room was amazing!....separate living area with sofa and coffee table, huge tv and large work desk.....bedroom was big too, comfy bed ( super king), big windows with small table and two comfy chairs for watching the view .....bathroom was fairly big with shower, toilet and bidet ( what a great idea!).
executive lounge was nice with a great outside terrace, we spent many evenings out here with a glass of cava and the canapés were good too, the only thing the spoilt this slightly was too many screaming kids in here, im not against kids but its an exec lounge not a nursery......had breakfast in lounge every day during my four days here and it was very good...loved the bacon!...... used gym once and sauna three times both very good!......loved the pool area, great atmosphere and bar ( expensive but its a Hilton)......when it came to our 4th day and time to go I didn't want to leave.
As a diamond Hilton member I get to see a lot of Hilton hotels on my travels, I can honestly say this is one of the best ive stayed at, great service, great food and great staff.......I will return next year ....loved it!

ps- shopping mall across the road, try ""natural kebap"" for the best chicken wrap ive ever eaten!!",5,2014,08,15
36,They got everything right,"We loved staying here.  My sons and I shared a junior suite and it was a very enjoyable holiday. We wouldn't have normally opted for a suite but it was a great deal through the agent.  We had the use of the executive lounge, which was helpful for wi-fi, but also for being able to drop in for snacks and drinks.  The executive rooms really are very nice, although the suite was a little tired. It did have everything one might need though from a facilities point of view and some things that weren't needed, like an extra large, flatscreen TV. The hotel is in good order throughout, served an a very good selection for breakfast and had a very relaxed bar area. The pool set up was lovely with lots of loungers and also plenty of shades and shaded areas.  The pool bar was a nice to have and the pool side restaurant served good food. The proximity of the hotel to the beach meant you can do door to beach in 6 or 7 minutes and you're only 5 minutes away from the metro.  Across the road there's a large shopping centre and includes many places to eat.  This is very much in keeping with my expected experience of Hilton and I'd recommend it, unless you want to be at the centre of night life.",4,2014,08,15
36,Great stay overall,"Stayed here for 1 night  and it is a great hotel in a great location. The hotel is very clean, well run and offers a good range of facilities. Room are spacious with usual Hilton facilities and the bathroom is well equipped. The Executive lounge has a great balcony and is very comfortable for having breakfast and drinks, although be warned it does get busy at night and closes late morning for an hour for cleaning.

Location wise it is opposite a great shopping centre with loads of places to eat, the beach is a 5 minute walk and there are plenty of taxis around. 

All in all, great value and highly recommended.",4,2014,08,14
36,"Beautiful hotel, worst service of any Hilton.","Let me start with the good.  This hotel is beautiful and the rooms have great city and/or ocean views.  With that being said, I stay at  Hilton hotels for work several times a week, year round, and have stayed at them from Argentina to Croatia and they have all had pristine service, until I stayed at the Hilton Diagonal Mar.  I personally wouldn't ever stay here again but for some clientele that aren't using the services provided this still might be the place for you.  Upon checking in I was lauded for having the highest reward status possible but told I couldn't use any of the facilities until I was given a key.  At breakfast, the food was still out but when I went to fill up my plate I was told that I couldn't get food because breakfast had closed.  At the pool I was told I could only get one towel.  If they can figure out good service in argentina than I am sure Barcelona can do the same.  As I said before, a lot of these nuances may not affect some people but next time I am in Barcelona I will be staying somewhere else!",2,2014,08,13
36,Lovely hotel and lovely staff !,"We have just spent a lovely anniversary weekend at this hotel, I will be coming back next year with my older children we loved the location and my daughter will love the large shopping mall  over the road,the hotel was very busy wile we were there and I agree about the sunbed situation, people were placing towels down and not going on the beds till late afternoon ,this should not be allowed ,but I will say the staff are really nice and did bring in some extra beds,also in breakfast I did see a lot of people taking large amounts of food and loading bags up to take away,I really don't get this! And this is not the hotels fault ,I will be back to this hotel and would recommend to other family members .",4,2014,08,12
36,Not Worth your Money!,"1. I will never understand why a hotel such as Hilton makes you pay for internet. 25 Euros per day?!!!
2. Everything little thing in this Hotel is costly. A KitKat Bar is 5.85 Euros! Even a phone call was less expensive than that at 5 euros!
3. Staff are Professional but they lack emphaty. All behaviours are automated for maximum revenue intake. Everything you ask any member of the staff will prompt a response based on financial revenue and/or something you have to pay for.
4. I'm took an executive room but even the bed was bad. Instead of being a super king size bed it was a double single bed (less expensive to buy I guess)
5. The airconditioning was making strange noises.
6. The elevators were crowded and sometimes you had to wait more than 5 minutes to get one!
7. I have not have the opportunity to go to the reception and not have to wait for 10' to be attended. They are just too crowded despite sometimes having 4 people there.
8. The reception manager was very arogant.
9. I took a room with partial rivers views and they gave me a wrong room (apparently whne thy asked if I prefered to have city views instead I said yes!).
10. The bathroom was a little dirty.
11. One of the complimentary cakes in the executive room was eaten!",1,2014,08,12
36,Fantastic Barcelona base,"Staying here with my two children this was a truly fantastic hotel. The room was well appointed and a second extra bed was brought immediately to the room on request. The view from the room, over the Diagonal Mar centre was dramatic, and the centre itself very convenient, with many shops and a large supermarket inside. The terrace opposite the hotel with a range of restaurants was also very welcome.

Breakfast at the hotel was wonderful - a massive range of produce and drinks and incredibly attentive, helpful staff.

The pool area was well kept, clean and well staffed, and the cocktails at the pool bar (virgin and normal) were lovely. 

Will definitely return, and would note the little touches like the cleaners putting my children's bears in funny places on the made beds, and the free lollipops downstairs in the morning were all most welcome.

The location of the hotel is fabulous. Close to the beach and playparks, the Museum Blau which is incredible and the tram stop Maresme as well as metro El Maresme Forum. The shopping centre is great on your doorstep and there are taxis available outside whenever needed.

I think the only addition would be a complementary airport shuttle bus.",4,2014,08,12
36,Large well appointed hotel in good location but service suffers when busy,"The hotel is about 35€ in a taxi from the airport which takes about 20 minutes. It is about 10€ in a taxi to most location in the city and there are also bus, tram and metro stops nearby. The hotel is next to a large shopping centre with a good selection of restaurants and 5 minutes from a popular beach. The hotel is the usual Hilton large modern high rise affair but the higher floors offer great views over the sea and city. Evening drinks on the Executive terrace were a particular treat. The room was well appointed and comfortable although it is still frustrating that unlike Holiday Inn, Hilton continue to charge for WI fi in the room. The pool was very nice although it was extremely busy at times with insufficient chairs for all the guests. As the hotel got busier throughout the stay, service suffered with amenities not replaced in the room and long waits for the lifts. Overall it was a good experience during what is probably peek season.",4,2014,08,11
36,Meh,"We stayed here one night following a cruise. This was a preferred location for the cruise line.  It is nowhere near the city center, so if you're going to go touring the older parts of Barcelona, you'll need transportation.  We did not go to the beach, but it was right across the street.  In the other direction, across another street, is a mall with multiple restaurants, so we did have many opportunities to eat outside the hotel. The onsite pool was quiet, looked nice, but was a little crowded. My kids are noisy, so we didn't go.  The gym looked nice, too. The onsite restaurant had a great breakfast buffet, but they were closed for dinner until 8pm- Barcelona time!  (Most of the restaurants in the mall were closed between 4 and 8, as well, so the one place that was open that interested us got our business, and it was awful.)  We could have ordered room service, but we were tired, and it would have been nice if their restaurant was open earlier.  The main floor bar made great cappuccino and hot chocolate.  Hotel has a modern flair, but our room was lacking a little.  First of all, in the US, it certainly would have fit 2 doubles, maybe queens. Instead, this one had one king, with kind of a large empty space on the side of the bed with one chair trying to fill it.  With a family of 4, there was no option other than to rent 2 rooms, and although they were on the same floor, they were not together.  That meant mom and dad split up and each took one kid.  Not terrible, but honestly, Hilton, put two beds in the room!  There was space for them.  Even if you charged me more for 4, I'd rather that than splitting up my family, and it's not like we were a large family.  At a family of 5+, I guess you couldn't go there, without an adult for each room??  The carpet was pretty worn, and although the bathroom was very modern looking, it was not well kept-water leaked under the shower, the grout was a little black, etc.  One of our rooms was quiet, but the one I stayed in was next to the housekeeper's closet, so every few minutes for most of the day, as someone went in and out of there, it sounded as if someone was knocking on my door or trying to get in.  A little unnerving.  It was fine for what we needed it for one night, but I would probably be disappointed overall if I stayed there for longer.",3,2014,08,10
36,A Shame!,"A disappointing stay at the hotel on so many fronts. We returned to the hotel to have a relaxing break and we were disappointed from the get go. We had booked a sea view and were upgraded to a relaxation room supposedly with a sea view -perhaps if you put the bed on stilts or had a periscope then maybe a sea view could be obtained! The room was described as a relaxation room  -a spa bath which was so noisy there was nothing relaxing about it! A toilet that constantly ran when flushed and a shower door that did not close -does anyone check these rooms?? Worse was the breakfast rush -we had breakfast included and yet each morning we went through same farce -sorry you aren't on the list -are you sure it's included in your price?? Even worse was the fun each day watching some people load up their bags with food for the day. Even tupperware boxes were brought out to load with food -is this a 4* hotel???? Certainly not!! The sun bed saga was another ordeal -towels on the beds from early morning and the staff did nothing to stop the reservation of beds. In fact management was nowhere to be seen! Check out Jumeriah brand hotels to see how they deal with this type of behaviour! Eventually more beds were ordered in -cheap, plastic seats -no thanks Hilton!! Drinks  -bring your cheque book -this is a total rip off -2 G&T- the same price as 2x 1 Litre bottles at the supermarket across the road!! Yes 32 Euro!  A small bottle of water in the hotel over 5 Euro. The best piece of advice is stay clear of the hotel especially for food and drinks. Go across the road to the Diagonal Mall. It is hard to believe that in the welcoming letter in the rooms you are advised to dial 9 if the hotel does not live up to your expectations -don't bother -they don't listen. All round this hotel would encourage me to forget the Hilton Brand -loyalty to Hilton Honours does not appear to mean anything here!!!",2,2014,08,10
36,Hilton Diagonal Mar,"A traditional Hilton Hotel, be aware check in is 4pm,that's 4pm! My booking was made 3 months in advance but they took a long time to find me a room. The front desk was always busy, so asking a question, getting directions etc took ages. No one available to help get a taxi. Breakfast was great, but don't turn away from an unfinished plate in front of you as they will remove it, regardless of the position of your cutlery.",4,2014,08,10
36,My favourite Hilton...,"The Hilton Diagonal Mar is close to the beach outside of the centre of Barcelona

I loved the hotel and didn't want to leave

The staff were gracious, friendly, professional and welcoming.

We were upgraded to an Executive Room with a view of the beach with a great view and the view from all angles on all the floors were great

The Executive Lounge had great food (an excellent veal stroganoff in the evening) and a great outdoor terrace overlooking the beach

The pool is awesome with inflatable rubber chesterfield sofas, a great sun deck with lots of sun beds and soft towels

The gym was well equipped

I have already booked to go back ! and can't wait

For some bizarre reason if you go the Executive Lounge before 8am you get a voucher for a free cocktail by the pool !!!",5,2014,08,07
36,Great experience and Some quality staff.,"The location of the hilton Diagonal wasn't great but satisfactory. As stated it is in close proximity 
to a lovely beach. The staff couldn't be more helpful attending to your every need, such as Metro 
connections, locations of interest and great restaurants.
The pool area could do with a few more sun beds as there usually taken around 10am.
But on the whole its a pleasant sun trap with a beautiful pool. The cocktails at the pool bar are a must and the open air restaurant delivers quality food with a smile until late into the evening.
The main restaurant was a little disappointing, good food but lacked vibrance and a pleasant atmosphere. After visiting the restaurants in the olympic marina, which where fantastic, it became apparent something was not quiet there at the Hilton..
The rooms are spacious and tidy, a little tired around the shower area and the bathrooms could do with a little more attention when cleaned.
Try to avoid the rooms next to the service lift, as they can be be very noisy throughout the night as i found out.
On the whole a lovely experience of Barcelona via the open top bus, which pull up every 10 minutes
Directly opposite the Hilton. Five days are defiantly not long enough to see everything to offer, so its a great excuse to return to the Hilton and continue the exploration of this
Beautiful City.
Thanks to all the lovely staff for making our stay GREAT!",4,2014,08,05
36,Exceptional Hotel,"I am a diamond member with Hilton and have stayed at many of their properties.  This one is great for both business and family trips.   Just a 3 minute walk to a great beach and a 5 minute walk to a metro line.  This hotel is not in the center of town but just a 15 minute metro ride away.   It is right across from one of the biggest malls in the area, but the area feels quiet.   Great pool area as well.    The executive lounge is one of the best with free liquor from 6-10 and tapas from 6-8 which are quite tasty.  Hotel rooms are large for Europe and exceptionally clean.   Overall, a great property in a great location if you love the beach!",5,2014,08,05
36,A new level of service,"Been to this hotel four or five times. It is safe to say that this year they have taken the quality of service to another level. From the second we walked through the door until the second we walked out everything was just that little bit better than expected. We also needed some medical assistance at one point, everybody was fast, efficient, professional and kind. It's very rare to get such personal service from a large multinational hotel chaine. The only one small dent is the wifi problem.. In your room at 25 euros for 24h or 75 euros for 5 days is very expensive for non business travellers, Wifi is available in public areas for free, however it wasn't working on three or four occasions... but this didn't spoil our holiday. Well done everyone at the Hilton Diagonal Mar !",5,2014,08,05
36,A+Great Experience,"After reading some reviews not sure what to expect and after my last stay at a Hilton was starting to question Hilton as a diamond member.  The hotel is in a great location by the beach and the views from the executive lounge stunning.  We were greeted by the receptionist and received our letter.  Letter welcomed us as Diamond members and provided details to the Executive Lounge. Rooms were great.  We were on the 22nd Floor and views to the beach. Wi fi was free.  Executive Lounge breakfast was bacon, eggs and delicious croissants and good selection of pastries,fruit, orange and grapefruit juice as well as cheeses and ham etc.  Cocktail foods OK.  Staff helpful and rooms cleaned to a good standard and toiletries replaced.  Would definitely return here and felt diamond status was respected. Thank you Hilton for a great stay.",5,2014,08,04
36,Would have gotten 5 stars but...,"Let start of by saying that Hilton properties are top notch and we have not had any issues.  That being said there were a couple of things that I troublesome.  I am not a big complainer but the first one made me think twice about the how clean the room was.  My wife flew in on business one day before I arrived and when I checked in I always checkout the room.  I noticed the mini bar had some take away food in it, so I thought it was my wife's.  I was hungry and thought about eating but I was traveling with my son and we wanted to get started in Barcelona.  Good thing I did not eat it because it was not my wife's leftovers if was from a previous guest.  Now I am wondering about how well did they clean the room, such as sheets, etc.  Other then that the room was nice, we had a problem with the shower drain and they had somebody up to our room within a half hour to fix it.  The property is very nice and comfortable.  The sea is only a 5 minute walk and there is a walkway over the highway to get you there.  The staff is friendly and helpful as well.  It is a short 6 to 10 Euro taxi ride to the city center depending on traffic, or the metro is only a 5 minute walk and the tram is about 3 minutes.  The public transportation is very efficient and clean.  But watch out for the pick pockets!!  I did 2 rides on the metro and witnessed 1 attempt on another metro rider and some one following my party trying to get our stuff.  My son noticed 2 guys following me and touching my camera and scoping us out and as soon as we became aware they jumped out the metro car door before it closed.  The second one involved a older well dressed man middle aged who was getting close to 2 ladies.  There were to young traveling girls with suitcases and they started yelling at this guy who I noticed was pulling his hand out of one of the 2 women's Purse.  The metro door was opening and another man grabbed at his coat to make sure he had not taken anything and then gave him a shove out the door.  Interestingly this was our stop as well so we exited and were walking and talking about what had happened and he thought we were following him and he spit at one our party I guess trying to get us to react and then call the police, but we did not.  JUST WATCH YOUR STUFF!!  This has no reflection on the Hilton as both of these issues happened down by the city center.  I only mention what happened because I am not aware of a way to review public transportation on Tripadvisor.  If there is could somebody let me know how.  Thank you.",4,2014,08,03
36,Fantastic,"Fantastic and functional amenities, courteous staff and efficient services. Except that the check out process was usually cumbersome due to few available staff and points. The memorable experience was worth the price.",4,2014,08,01
36,Excellent Hilton,"Very clean, spacious room, nice breakfast. Close to Camp Nou and many shopping malls. Very beautiful neighborhood with an open-space bar. However hotel was rowdy with so many cabin crew at the reception and lobby area, which is non issue when you are in your room.",5,2014,07,31
36,Perfect Stay,"I cannot fault the Hilton Diagonal Mar for anything.  All our requests were met with a solution, the bedroom nice and spacious, as well as being very comfortable.  Added bonus is the beach and shopping mall are only minutes way by walking.  I will definitely come back here if I return to Barcelona.",5,2014,07,30
36,Great hotel on the waterfront,"The hotel is very close to the CCIB.  We were attending a conference there and that is why we chose it.  However, I am no very glad we did. It is by no means close to the city center, so if you are the touristy type it might be a little out of the way -- almost a 40min into town on the subway.  Taxi would be about 15mins.  There are a few good places in and around the hotel for sight-seeing.  The aquarium being one and ofcourse the famous Barcelona beaches.

The shopping and food at the Diagonal Mar shopping center across the street was very good and decently priced.  The Italian place, La Tagliatella, serves excellent food -- well prepared and very fresh ingredients.  Also, enjoyed the Natural Kebap place inside the shopping center.

As to the hotel, the staff was very friendly and attentive. The free wifi is a little tough.  Only works well in the lobby.  I did find a spot in my room where the connection was pretty good.  The pool although extremely busy is kept very clean.  Really, like the idea of a separate pool for kids. The room was a nice size and yes the AC was one of the best I have had in a hotel. Quiet and very comfortable. 

All in all a great hotel -- nice getaway.  Will visit again if I have the chance.",5,2014,07,29
36,Something wrong with the management,"I loved very much this hotel and always stayed while visiting Barcelona. Always. Because of location, shopping mall and of course sea. But this time I was not welcomed here.
As a HHonors gold member I have a privilege to use the Executive lounge and I love this place especially at Hilton Diagonal Mar, one of its best feature it is a view, it is 15th floor and you can see all the city. The gorgeous view. 
During the check in I was denied the access to Executive Lounge just because it is over-crowded. I was shocked, really. I was working for a long time at Ernst and Young and I couldn't imagine that we can deny the service to our client just because we have a lot of clients. I travel a lot, and I am always loyal to companies I use, as an example Delta lounges in Atlanta, JFK, Boston, LA are always over-crowded and I was never denied the access!!! Every company or business is always happy when the business is booming and do all effort to serve and hold loyal customers.
As a gold member I have a breakfast at the Executive lounge, not this time. I was proposed to take my Continental breakfast at the bar, ground floor. Believe me it was not continental breakfast. Couple pieces of bread, some cereal and some meat. When we tried to take a place to sit, the barman said that the place, we choosed, was reserved and the others were dirty and not cleaned. After this we just left.  
I am always loyal to Hilton, when I travel in USA or worldwide first I check the availability of Hilton hotels (or sisters) and only IF it is unavailable or there is no Hilton brand hotels I stay at IHG, SPG or ever Accor hotels. But my first choice is always Hilton.
But today my loyalty was heavily damaged. 
I like personal services and also love to receive every time welcome messages from the management, this time the receptionist opened this my personal envelope, checked what was in there and throw in the trash some piece of paper. I think this is so unprofessional and unethical because if this is for me, only me, I can decide what to put in the trash. Maybe there are some information which maybe important for me.
If I could I'd rather to stay at another hotel, but it was prepaid.
I think this is my last stay at this hotel.",2,2014,07,28
36,Not bad it could be better!!,"Señor Enrique Aranda (Manager): My husband and I recently stayed at your hotel for 3 nights. First, I have to congratulate your front desk staff Alexandra, Marc, Nuria and an Italian born young lady, (sorry can't remember her name) for their excellent customer service, they are an asset to your hotel. They were very helpful and eager to help me out when questions and concerns did arise. Also, your bell boys, Guillermo y Xavier were very helpful and friendly towards us. Gave me advise and recommendations when asked and helped us get a taxi when we needed it. But with regards to amenities provided many things could be improved. Internet connection was very slow at the majority of times, when wanted to research local places for sightseeing, tried to send emails to our family and coworkers abroad to keep them inform of our stay in Barcelona and unfortunately they didn't receive them, had to wait until I got to the airport lounge to send them! Had the pleasure to meet Martha (housekeeping staff) when she brought us an ice bucket we needed for ice, she did apologized for not having a lid for the bucket, which it was ok. It was nice to have an ice machine right there on our floor because we use ice quite a bit. The room that we were assigned at first had a strong Smoking odor, came to find out that your hotel has a non-smoking policy at the rooms. Need to monitor that it would not happen again to another guest. Had to switch rooms with other guests that were traveling with us. Special group breakfast hall sat up for our group on the 1st floor staff was really nice, although they asked both my husband and I if we were part of the group, because they thought that we were not, because we looked different (found it kind of funny). Mini bar door locked on us, had to call front desk and they send message to housekeeping I think, and eventually it did open. Should have a better system in place because it was very inconvenient for us who use the mini bar all the time. Loved the air conditioning system in the room we stayed at, superb! We lived in the midwest (USA) where it gets very cold in the winter and very hot in summer time so we like it very cold. Had trouble with TV in room and although your staff quickly send a repair man unfortunately he could not speak any English. Because I wasn't in the room at that time to be able to translate to my husband what he was saying, we had to figure it out ourselves. Otherwise, hotel seem very clean, spacious to room about even though large group of people were there. Elevators worked kind of slow. Housekeeping staff cleaned room way to fast and forgot to replace soap and other amenities needed. Need to improve in this area to avoid further problems.

36,Upscale Hilton near the waterfront in Barcelona,"Stayed here 6 nights while attending a conference in Barcelona.  Hotel is in a nice location at the end of the Diagonal street.  I booked an executive room and was put on the top floor of the hotel facing the ocean.  Lovely view and lovely room with hardwood floor.  Quiet.  The other direction looks out on the city and the Diagonal Mar shopping center across the street from the Hilton.  The one drawback to facing that direction is that the shopping center sponsors outdoor concerts in the evenings several times per week and they create some noise.  It is definitely quieter on the ocean side of the hotel.  Overall the staff throughout the property was great.  I can not say enough good things about the staff.  My biggest complaint with this hotel is that I found the public spaces too warm for my comfort level.  The executive lounge and the gym were both kept warmer than I am used to when traveling in US properties, but in Europe this can be more the norm.  In contrast the AC in my room worked excellently - it was quiet and produced a lot of cool.  I kept the room around 20C on the thermostat and it felt about that cool.  Breakfast in the lounge is pretty typical Hilton lounge breakfast.  Mostly cold stuff with one tray of scrambled eggs and one tray of bacon.  One of the high points of this property is the pool and bar area outside on the 2nd floor.  There is a restaurant next to the pool that serves up a menu similar to the Indigo restaurant only more casual.  I ate three several days in a row.  Also noteworthy is that the hotel is happy to provide gluten free bread with meals for those who have dietary restrictions.  Housekeeping seemed a little spotty to me but then the staff told me I could call up and request housekeeping at a specific time and after I started doing that I had no problems - they always showed up when I requested.  I can recommend this property if you are looking for a newer Hilton in Barcelona.  I would have given this property a 5 had they had good cooling in the gym and lounge.  Because of this I gave it a four instead of five.",4,2014,07,26
36,A great hotel in the Diagonal Mar area of Bareclona,"We stayed in this hotel for one night prior to our cruise.  The location was great for touring the city.  The Hop On Hop Off stops just across the street.  The staff was great in helping us with all our needs. 

The rooms and accommodations were very nice and we were given rooms that connected since we were a family of four but the rooms only accommodate two.",4,2014,07,26
36,Disappointed,"We booked one night as part of our anniversary before going on a cruise. 
We arrived at 11.30 pm and they offered us an upgrade.. 50 euros .. At that time at night but we accepted.
They sent up wine and choc cake so well done on that part..
The room had a jeccuzi bath but was slimy and definitely not been cleaned for ages.. We raised this in the morning and they said we should have called services.. We had one of these in our house and takes 2-3hrs to run the cleaning system..
Feel ripped off, won't be back",2,2014,07,26
36,Fantastic stay,"We stayed for 3 nights over a weekend in an Executive Room with an amazing seaview from 21st floor.  The Hotel is located in a newer area away from the town but there is a great shopping centre across the road and the metro is easily accessible around the corner and a very easy system to use.    The beach is just across the road and there is a lovely beach cafe on the second beach along for drinks and snacks.

The pool and terrace bar were amazing, we were a little disappointed with our meal in the terrace bar and only ate there once but the cocktails were amazing!  The Club Lounge is a great and the roof terrace views are not to be missed.  

Good Hilton standards, the staff were helpful and friendly with good advice about local attractions, directions and transport;  we will definitely return.",4,2014,07,23
36,Great hotel,"Hotel is not in the city center and that could be a little expensive for a tourist budget.  It has good shopping across the street, and decent restaurants, too.  Very close to the beach.  All in all we had a great stay with a very nice ocean view room.",5,2014,07,21
36,"Wonderful hotel, amenities, location with couple of bad staff.....","This hotel is pretty faultless. The hotels location is perfect with a great shopping mall opposite, wonderful restaturants nearby, beach a stones throw away with the fab Banbu Beach bar (we loved this place!) and the Exec lounge was both the highight and low point of our trip. We were a group so maybe that is why one particular small girl and one particular tall man despised us....literally! They were rude, unhelpful and made us feel very uncomfortable when we went nto the lounge talking about us in Spanish and starring at us making it very obvious we were being spoken about. I was strongly considering returning with my husband and children as the pool and the rest of the staff were wonderful but these 2 people would be the sole reason for me not returning to this hotel!!
The swimming pool was perfect. it was clean, plenty of sun loungers, waiting staff were so lovely too. 
Our room had a great view, had everything we needed and was clean - wifi in the room would have been nice but it was accesible by the pool, exec lounge and reception so maybe having a bit of peace and quiet in the room is a good thing!
We loved this hotel, it's just a shame the 2 staff members left a nasty taste in our mouth meaning I couldn't give the review 5 stars.",4,2014,07,21
36,Great service,"Arrived at the hotel around 11.30, check in was smooth and our room was ready which I wasn't expecting, this was a great start to our 3 night break. The executive room was pretty much the same as the other Hilton rooms we have stayed in and we were on the same floor as the executive lounge which offered a good selection for breakfast and some nibbles, beer wine and soft drinks in the evening (until 10pm). Computer access was free in the lounge (with the access code) along with some very nice views, We found the staff to be very helpful regarding train and bus travel and advised us to book online for Sagrada Familia to avoid lengthy queues. The hotel is in a fairly quiet location however the train station is a very short walk away to take you into the city centre and for sight seeing locations. We had a very pleasant stay and I would not hesitate to stay here again.",5,2014,07,20
36,"A ""complete"" hotel.","I stayed in the hotel for a team meeting. The hotel is close to the city center. The room I stayed was very clean and modern. the rooms have extremely nice views. the lobby bar has pretty much everything you need, including food. the restaurat is really well. One of the things I liked is that walking distance you have  a big shopping mall with restaurants included. The wifi speed was excellent. The hotel is near the sea and within 15 minutes ( taxi ) you can be in puerto olimpico. the personnel very friendly and helpful. Being a person that travels frequently, this hotel really stands out for business and also family... Additionally the rooms and air conditions are really noise-free.",5,2014,07,19
36,Outstanding service,The hotel staff provided excellent service to ensure that we could make the cruise ship during the taxi strike on July 1st.  Most hotels told their guests - tough but the Hilton arranged a bus that looped between the post and airport to make sure their guests were taken care.  The other people on our cruise ship were trying to push heavy luggage through the metro and buses....it was a nightmare.  Two thumbs up!!!,5,2014,07,19
36,Modern & slick in BCN,"Great modern facilities, amazing views & location, cool pool deck & sun space.  Service very efficient and public spaces in the hotel very nice to be in & around.  Super comfortable bed, great room facilities, quality Hilton feel.",4,2014,07,18
36,Perfect beach location,"Great beach location but an 8-10 euro taxi ride to the main tourist area, La Rambla. 

We needed to escape the busy city & heat to some relaxation, pool, breeze & beach. It's a 5 minute walk to the beach. The concierge reserved a cabana for us for 25 euros each day (no private beaches in Barcelona.) The cabanas are part of a nice relaxing beach restaurant so we stayed in our little slice of heaven all day. **have the Hilton make your reservation. They treat you so much better than walk up requests. You can lay out on your towel for no cost if you prefer.

Nice pool on the 2nd floor with a large seating area and lounge chairs. 

Our room had a beautiful view of the ocean. Hilton Honor level included breakfast, wifi, happy hour & executive lounge. Room was perfect. It was nice to have a normal size room in Europe :-) 

I loved everything about this hotel but please note this is on the beach, not in the middle of town. We stayed 3 nights in town & 2 here before heading to Madrid. Perfect combination for us.

36,"Nice hotel, easy access to mall across the street","We stayed for 3 nights in a junior suite with our 16 year old son.  This was really good and comfortable.  Nice large bathroom with a bidet.  The executive lounge was great and had a nice breakfast, snacks and drinks all the time.  The internet access was good as well.  It was really nice having the mall across the street with many restaurants (several with good vegetarian options - essential for us) and a department store and bank ATMs.  Friendly service, easy access by cab/metro to most tourist areas in Barcelona.  We had a great time overall!",4,2014,07,16
36,"modern hotel, ok services","Hotel is located at a new developed area of Barcelona, new buildings and business offices. and there is a shopping mall just front of the hotel. outside area clean and not so many people as in the center, you can feel the calm and quiet sites of Barce. I stayed in high floors, I can see the see view. Room are clean and nice. Just one small thing that when they calculate final price it went wrong. But as soon as they found out, they return money back.",3,2014,07,16
36,"Nice hotel, but a bit pricy.","Stayed for 4 nights prior to a cruise from Barcelona. Had a junior suite, which gave access to the executive lounge. Large room, actually 2 rooms, bright and well furnished. We were 3 guests, and needed the extra space. Travelling 2 together an ecexcutive room would be cheaper, by using the summer campaign it would be affordable.
The extra dollars spent for access to the executive lounge is well worth spending. The lounge served  good food, beer and drinks from 6 to 10 PM, and coffee and non alkoholic refreshments the rest of the day.
Also just across the street from Diagonal Mar shoppingsenter with multiplum restaurants. A 5 minutes walk to the beach.",4,2014,07,15
36,Everything you need to be comfortable,"Location is a bit far from the city sites, but a short walk to the beach, and a 10-15 minute cab ride to whatever you fancy. Public transit also easily accessible. I was here on business, so pretty much stayed onsite for that portion of the trip anyhow. 
Very clean and modern property. Friendly service. Comfortable beds. Great breakfast buffet (I surely gained weight). Small gym, but enough to get the job done. Beautiful rooftop pool/bar area. 
There's a shopping mall directly across the street, with numerous restaurants. So that's quite convenient for any last minute needs.",5,2014,07,13
36,Overpriced.,"I just paid 5 euros for a take-away espresso. This must be the most expensive coffee I ever drunk. Even in overpriced Starbucks you can have it for 2.5! 
I told them it is the most  expensive coffee ever and they laughed in said ""there is always a first time, it's a lesson.""

Super overpriced. ",2,2014,07,13
36,Good Hotel in Barcelona,"Stayed here for business.  Nice accomodations and staff was very pleasant.  Location is only blocks away from the beach and directly across from a shopping plaza where there are plenty of restaurants.  
Lobby lounge staff was terrific and had lots of great recomendations for food and drink.  Rooms were clean and very nice.  Internet accomodated 3 devices at no charge.  Ocean views are great, but you'll need to be on one of the top floors to take advantage (15 or above).  
Hotel is not near all the tourist area, but you can catch the tour bus just down the street. 27 Euros get's you a great day of sight seeing all across Barcelona.  Well worth the price to see one of Europe's most beautiful cities.
Travel to/from airport takes 20 minutes in light traffic and will run 30 Euros.",4,2014,07,12
36,Trip to Barcellona before cruise,"Great hotel with lot of amenities and very quiet, although it was located in a very busy part of the city. Access to many stores, shops and restaurants nearby. Wonderful buffet breakfast in the morning. Lunch and dinner in lobby bar/ restaurant were also very good.",4,2014,07,11
36,Second stay was even better,"Stayed with wife, 3 year old and 6 month old in a junior suite. The junior suites are a full two rooms - not giant, but they worked well for us. We stayed here the year before when just one child and will definitely return again when we come back to Barcelona. As others have said the executive lounge is great. There is a restaurant on the beach, which is a 5-10 minute walk (would be less if you didn't have to wait for traffic lights) with a great restaurant/cafe. We normally use Avis, but used the Sixt car rental in the lobby. It was at the end of our stay and we were leaving town, but I got the impression that if someone took a taxi to the hotel and arrange a rental to be picked up in the lobby you could go use the Sixt parking for several days for free. Could save money if you were doing day trips. Anyway, great hotel, family had lots of fun at the pool and the food is very good (a bit pricey). Will definitely be back.",5,2014,07,11
36,Pleasant Experience,"The hotel was comfortable for our first night in country awaiting a cruise.  We were given ""Relaxation"" room and it was, indeed, that. Nice bed and bath.  Wonderful buffet breakfast in the morning.  Beware, however, of the ""Executive Chef's Special"" Lobster Paella.  As advertised, it was a whole lobster; which meant that one diner got the beautiful tail that lifted right out of the shell while the other diner had to  further crack and pick his way through the claw and legs. As usual, somewhat messy.  Should have been 2 tails to be ""special"".  Had it not been our first paella in country, we would have sent it back. (not knowing any better)  Although it looked nice, it was dry, everything was overcooked and we think that the rubbery, grey lumps were probably small scallops.  Any kitchen can have a bad episode and, hopefully, that was their one and only.  However, unless you wish to wrestle with the claw and legs, you might wish to order something else.  A medium sized shopping mall (with grocery store) is  conveniently located across the street.  It was just a short taxi ride to the port.  Overall, a pleasant experience.",4,2014,07,06
36,Pre Disney cruise,"Great place to stay.  Staff was very helpful. Offered a good rate for euro exchange. Taxi right outside will take for reasonable price wherever we wanted. They really don't expect a big tip.  No issues. The area however does get busy pre-and post Disney cruise.  Get food and drink at market accross the street. Short walk to beach.

Try out to the Olympic area and try one of several great restaurants. The areas very lively. A lot to choose from.",4,2014,07,05
36,Great service,"We stayed three night there in executive room on executive floor. Its free to get breakfast in the morning. Soft drink, coffee,snack and fruit for free all day. On the evening, red wine and cava is severed for free as well. All the staff are very helpful and nice. The hotel is at great location, very easy walk to beach and shopping mall. The room is huge and clean, the pool area is beautiful ad well. It is a great hotel for nice vacation.",5,2014,07,05
36,Excellent Hotel and great Customer Service,"This hotel were very helpful, in particular a receptionist in training called Lea. She greeted us with a friendly smile and checked us in professionally, asking if we wanted to upgrade to an executive suite which we did.
I lost my phone at the other Hilton while I was there and she was very good in chasing them to see if they had found it.
When she saw me in reception, she always asked if I had received any news... Great service, great hotel, near the beach with a pool and near the beach",5,2014,07,03
36,CONSISTANTLY OUTSTANDING,"This hotel in located on the beach in a newly developed area of the city close to where the Olympics took place many years past.

It is fresh and modern with excellent staff.

The rooms are big and offer excellent INTERNET SERVICE.

The Executive Lounge is delightful with an amazingly large terrace for breakfast/sundowners all .under the control of the most pleasant and professional lady-Cecilia.

Public transport is just 4 mins walking and a large shopping mall with many restaurants is located across the road from the hotel.

If you want to stay out of the city--this location is ideal and is connected by no 7 bus from the sister hotel of Hilton downtown which i reviewed yesterday.",5,2014,07,03
36,Beautiful Hotel near the beach,"We picked this hotel as it's close and easy walking distance to the beaches. We had a room on
one of the higher levels overlooking both the city and the sea. The view of the city at night was awesome and well worth paying a bit extra to get it. The room was very modern, very clean and comfortable. The service was ok but when paying top price I expected more. Most of the staff we encountered had long faces during the 3 days we stayed, having said that the female manager in exec lounge was quite helpful, providing information about getting around town and to the airport. Our over all impression of the hotel was that the facilities are fantastic, the location is fantastic too if you want the beach, if you want the city, this hotel is quite a ways from it and requires transport to get to and from the main downtown. Public transport is very close. Some of the guest facing staff need to smile and be more welcoming and helpful to make this hotel go from a ""very good"" over all experience to a ""excellent"" one. With some extra active effort by the staff this hotel could be on my sensational list.",4,2014,07,01
36,great stay,Stayed 6 nights...wonderful hotel...friendly staff. Excellent views of city and ocean. Mall nearby was excellent local restaurants. Pool was nice setting. Awesome we will be back. Close to museum of natural history fun for kids..  And see chocolate museum too.,5,2014,06,30
36,Hilton Diagonal Mar,"This should be a 5-star hotel hands down. Great location (really close to the beach, shopping mall across the hotel), beautiful pool, great restaurant, gym, front desk people are great and friendly (Toni remembered me after my last stay, which made me feel even more welcome during this stay). The person at the front even made reservations for me when I asked about tours in Barcelona. Bar is also great, we enjoyed watching football in the bar and the drinks were perfectly made. I travel to Barcelona every month for two weeks and by far the best hotel in the city.",5,2014,06,30
36,Good hotel near the sea and congress place,"Hilton Diagonal Mar in Barcelona is a  quality hotel with HIlton standards.  The room was pretty large and the view from the higher floors was excellent.
+ Great breakfast buffet ( unfortunately not included to my room price)
+ Diagonal shopping center across the street
+ Gym ok
- Wireless network in the room was not incuded to the room price. The daily price was expensive, ca 20-25 euros.",4,2014,06,30
36,Great hotel by the sea,"Excellent contemporary hotel with the level of quality one would expect from the brand. The hotel is located close to the southern tip of Avenida Diagonal, close to the sea and across the street from a shopping mall and an underground station. The underground ride from the hotel to the main touristic attractions in the city center takes about twenty minutes. I particularly liked this location in a quiet part of the city, away from the crowds.  The lobby is large, modernly decorated with lots of natural light during the day, staff is friendly and helpful and no waiting times for the elevators. I was assigned a corner room on the top floors with wonderful sea views. The room was quite big, modern, very clean, with wooden floors and furniture in the same light brown color, and again lots of natural light in both the room and the bathroom. I also really liked the relaxed atmosphere and snacks, wine, cava provided in the executive lounge and the city and sea views from there. Overall a great hotel that I would happily return to.",5,2014,06,29
36,Barcelona Hilton Diagonal Mar,"Excellent service and great facilities. Staff is extremely helpful.  Location is near subway stop, and allows easy traasnportation anywhere in Barcelona. Rooms are quet.  Lobby internet facilities are friendly and available at all times. Breakfast facilities are very good, although a bit overpriced. Parking is excellent.",4,2014,06,25
36,Good hotel but should provide free wi-fi in rooms,"Stayed here for the final couple of days of a trip to Barcelona with some friends.   A few unstructured thoughts about my stay:

-A nice, modern hotel with big, comfortable rooms, very good standard of cleanliness and presentation.  Only a very discerning person woul;d have found fault with the quality and presentation of our rooms- I was very impressed.

-We used the hotel pool, this was very pleasant, and one friend used the gym and apparently had a reasonable workout.  As we stayed in a  suite this gave us access to the executive lounge, which was excellent, with a very good terrace with great views over the city and some small freebies (snacks/ drinks/ newspapers) available for free. 

-The buffet breakfast was pretty decent, although I have experienced better at a couple of places (one a small independent, and the otehr a medium-sized chain) -  there is some room for improvement but to make a big deal of this would be unreasonable. 

-However wi-fi is only freely available in a few public areas of the hotel and NOT in the rooms themselves.    Given that every other non-budget hotel I've stayed in lately (many of them a lot smaller and less well-resourced than Hilton) have been able to offer free wi-fi in all rooms, this is a poor show and not what I expected of a Hilton.  This seems to me like the hotel equivalent of  Emirates airline ""doing a Ryanair"" and charging extra for assigned seats, meals, hold bags etc.  It's just not what you'd expect. 

-Location is OK-ish for getting to city centre or other parts of the city- the hotel is in the Forum area to the east of the city, so to get into the centre involves a metro or tram ride of maybe 10-15 minutes.  The metro/tram stations are a block away from the hotel (<5 minutes walk) so this isnt too big a deal

-The location is better for getting to slightly quieter parts of barcelona beach, although if you want really good beaches, you need to get a tram+train up to Badalona (15 -20 minutes away)

-Staff were generally efficient and reasonable

-Given the standard of the hotel, I feel it was good value for money although the lack of wi-fi in rooms was a significant irritant.",4,2014,06,24
36,Nice hotel in good location,"The hotel and Rooms are clean. Staff have been friendly and helpfull during the times, that i have spend here (5 trips, 4weeks.). The lounge is really nice and there are tastefull snacks and beverages. The restaurant is a little bit expensive comparing to average prices in similar kind of restaurants in Barcelona.

I have been here few times and will come again, when i visit next time in Barcelona",4,2014,06,22
36,Would stay again,"I stayed at the hotel during June 2014 on a personal trip with my wife. 

Good points:
Location to a nice beach: 3-4 minutes walk to a relatively quiet beach (compared to Barceloneta beach), which has a pool side bar just on the ramp down to the beach
Very clean hotel
Rooms were a good size by European standards with separate table/chair area in one corner of the room
Rooms were air conditioned by your own in room controls
Free WiFi was available in public areas ONLY
Public WiFi was available at the pool area
Service in terms of porters, check in and out was good
Wonderful view of the beach/harbour/city from the pool area or hotel room
Buffet breakfast was really good. It had a good mix of fruits, cereals, bacon, eggs, croissants, pastries etc. 

Bad points:
Very expensive for a beer or alcoholic drinks e.g. €9.50 per pint/large beer. This price was out of sync with much of city centre Barcelona even in the tourist 'hot spots'
Room service - we asked on 3 separate occasions to have our mini bar activated and each time it didn't work or the person sent to fix it didn't arrive
No free WiFi in the rooms - there was a charge for non Hilton diamond/gold members in room
Public WiFi in the restaurant was awful and impossible to connect
Service at the pool side bar was dreadful, even though one expects service in certain Spanish hotels to be slower, this was awful by American/British standards. One person covering 20-25 people and serving drinks to others in between my drinks order.
Water was not complimentary in your room

Things to look out for:
If you want to experience Barcelona beach or La Rambla then this location is €12-15 in a taxi one way and therefore trips in and out to the city centre can add up. It can be more expensive in busier traffic times
The area is very quiet and appeared to be very business focused rather than tourist (FYI)
There are a few bars, cafe's etc. near the hotel but not many and certainly not as many as other tourist areas 
The pool area is very quiet - this can be a pro or a con depending on your requirements
It is €25-30 in a taxi (one way) from the airport
Across from the hotel is a medium sized shopping centre, which was really useful and convenient for picking up bits n pieces http://www.diagonalmarcentre.es/en/
A snack at the hotel pool bar was pricey relative to city centre Barcelona 

All in all, this hotel was exactly what we were looking for during our trip and given that we had no kids with us, this was peaceful, relaxing and what we needed.",4,2014,06,22
36,Speed of check in and Wifi services need improvement.,"I stayed in a mixture of 3 and 4 stars hotels in Madrid and Barcelona and never had a problem with wifi connection until I checked in at Hilton diagonal. All the other hotels offer free wifi in the room except for Hilton Diagonal which offers free wifi in the lobby only. That's fine as I was aware of that restriction at the point of booking. However, the connection to the free lobby wifi was very troublesome. I couldn't connect it on my own but got to seek help from the front desk who then had to call someone to help with the connection. I have to wait at the front desk for at least 10 mins to get the free lobby wifi connection sorted out.  While the front desk staff was very helpful and professional, I can't believe the staff have to put in time and work just for wifi connection.

The check in and check out to the hotel were also exceptionally slow as compared to all other hotels I had stayed. 

The redeeming points were that the hotel is located near to a nice beach and the bed was very comfortable. It's a nice hotel to stay in if you want to be near the beach. The breakfast was average with variety of food.

If you want to be near to the major attractions e.g. sagrada familia etc, there are other nice and more centrally located hotels.",3,2014,06,22
36,"Practical, easy access hotel in Barcelona","This is a practical ( easy access, well designed, well managed ) hotel in Barcelona.  It is a bit far way from downtown; which is good for the traveler looking for a place to wind down. For those just looking for a central location, this is not the place to go. It very close to the convention center near  Diagonal Mar. In fact, it is the best choice for the traveler that has business in that part of Barcelona.",4,2014,06,21
36,Modern hotel with amazing views,"Recently built hotel in a modern district. Décor is contemporary and bright. Rooms are very spacious with amazing almost panoramic windows. You will get amazing views to the sea if you room is high enough (starting from c10th floor). Comfortable bed and good soundproofing. Due to the location hotel is more oriented to business or conference guests. You have to get a taxi or car to get to the centre. You can find a shopping across the street. Restaurant (dining) was disappointing – service was slow and inattentive and dishes were below average. However breakfast was superb and with some local Spanish specialities.
*Stayed in February 2013",4,2014,06,20
36,Great stay!,"I had a great stay at the Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona. I stayed for three nights in September 2013, for business.

Check-in was easy and problem-free. I don't speak a word of Spanish and the staff were all great! The concierge was very helpful. I stayed in an executive room, which was very spacious and clean, and modern, with a great view! The internet (unlike the other Hilton in Barcelona) was fast and without problems! The executive lounge was a bit of a squeeze inside, but also had a large terrace outside, which offered wonderful views of the ocean. 

The hotel has a not very central location, so is not close to anything sight-seeing wise, but has public transport access nearby. Additionally, the hotel, despite the name, is not ""on"" the beach, but a block away, with a complicated road crossing. Nevertheless, a very, very positive experience, and I can definitely recommend the Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona anytime!",5,2014,06,19
36,Not to bad but certainly not 4 star,"Room was a good size but tired looking, bed comfortable.  Bathroom, toilet was left stained!  Breakfast had a good choice of food.  Cocktails were very expensive (£9 and £13 each) however the service in the main bar area was good.  Overall, apart from one member of staff all were excellent and very helpful.  Had great views of the city, able to see the Cathedral and very pleasant view at night.

Located close to the beach and the local incineration plant which when the wind blows the wrong way - the smell is beyond awful (certainly that isn't one of the unique selling points) as they say in the brochure.
 
A quick walk across the road from the hotel is a shopping mall, which has 3 floors including a food hall. Stays open til 9pm for shopping and 11pm for food part, great if it rains to walk a few hours away.  Also a multi-screen cinema there as well.  Just off the shopping mall is the metro/subway/tube which for an unlimited day pass gets you into the heart of Barcelona in about 15 mins.  Clean and quick service.  There is also a bus route which runs pass the hotel.

Overall it's an ok hotel.  We stayed 2 nights which was more than enough.  Would I stay there again probably not as little out the way from all the action of the heart of Barcelona.",3,2014,06,18
36,Pleasant Stay,"The hotel is easily accessible by metro or tram for not much £, not sure what previous issues were, as something called Google or the many staff at the hotel would have happily recommended these options. The executive lounge gave great views over the beach and city from the terrace, and the snacks and drinks were plentiful, no spirits on offer which was a shame!
No issues with the room however our neighbours were incredibly noisy and random intervals during the night and there was some concert nearby for the first two nights. Pool area was nice and relaxing",4,2014,06,18
36,Beautiful hotel,"This is such a beautiful hotel with such beautiful views of the ocean. The room was big and very comfortable. The front desk staff were very helpful. The executive lounge was very nice, especially Cecilia. She was very attentive and helped us out a lot. Even though they said there was continental breakfast in the executive lounge it included eggs and bacon. The only complaint I have is that the Internet does not work in the room. I am glad that we are Hilton honors members and get Internet for free, because if I had paid for the Internet that didn't work I would have been furious.",4,2014,06,17
36,Not the Hilton experience as expected,"I have stayed in Hiltons before and unfortunately this was the one where the service was not so great. The staff seemed to be very busy but not with servicing the clients. This was the case at the reception as at the poolbar. Rooms are nice, comfy beds and pillows. Close to the beach. There's a big shopping center opposite the hotel.",3,2014,06,16
36,"nice hotel, strange room attendant","We enjoy our time there, the service was good and the breakfast was excellent but we had two problems: the room had no open window as a result of some safety matter, and the room attendant knocked on our door at a very strange times such as 7:00 AM etc. It took as a little while until we learn to put the DO NOT DISTURB sign all the time. It was a bother.",4,2014,06,16
36,Surviving on a reputation,"We have stayed in a few Hilton hotels whilst holidaying, but unfortunately in my opinion, this one is surviving on the reputation of the others. Firstly, when we got to our room we discovered it had no in- room safe as all the brochures had advised so we called reception.  When we were eventually relocated to another room with a safe we had another surprise.  This time the fridge wouldn't open so another call was made to reception to have the problem rectified.  The carpets were old and smelly and desperately in need of replacement.  The décor could have also done with an upgrade as it was not to the standard of what you would expect for the cash outlay required to stay at a Hilton hotel.  The only major plus was the guy who was serving at the bar.  He was quite informative about where the best places were to dine and try the traditional foods.  Do yourself a favor and stay somewhere cheaper, cleaner and possibly closer to the centre of Barcelona.",2,2014,06,16
36,excellent stay!,"We were taking a Disney cruise the following day and this hotel was recommended by Disney...it did not disappoint!!  We had the disney bus service right in the hotel (plus a rep to check us in), and had the hop on hop off but stop right around the corner to tour the city, plus the beach right in front!  Service was impeccable, food was great and the pool area was beautiful, not to mention a corner suite and vip floor.  I would definitely stay here again!",5,2014,06,15
36,Good experience!,"Restaurant is AWESOME!!! I have been missing their Cheese flan ever since I left the hotel. Could be very pricey at peak season, so if you catch it at less than 150 euros a night, book it!!!! Great location. Very close to the beach and there's a mall across the street. Front desk service is great as well. ",4,2014,06,15
36,Horrible night,"This was one of the worst nights in a hotel. But from the start.

The start was good. A quick check-in and my junior suite (Nr.620) was already ready. Nice suite with a view to the ocean. The hotel is a little bit outside, but near the hotel is metro station. Also tram and bus. One of the hop on hop off buses stops near the hotel. I can’t tell if both bus companies have a bus stop. It’s a short drive with the metro and the tickets are cheap. The metro system is also easy to understand. 

After sightseeing I enjoyed the executive lounge. Friendly staff and a nice view to the city.  At this time I noticed the music from the beach. It was the Primavera sound festival. At this time the music was not very loud. I also hoped that the music stops something around midnight. This was a failure. 

Later the night I was back in my suite. I noticed that the music became louder. I tried to sleep, but no chance. It was getting worse! Sometimes the hotel vibrates of the heavy bass. At 3am I called the reception and ask about how long they play this night/morning. The reception could only tell that they play for some time and that they sent me earplugs. The earplugs help a little bit, but still no sleep.

At breakfast in the executive lounge I asked for a room change, but the only room was a standard room at the 6th floor. I didn’t like the Hilton standard rooms and I was not sure if the next nights were like the last night. So I had to cancel my stay and move to another hotel. 

After the stay I had e-mail correspondence with the manager. He told me that they never had complaints about noise of the festival and that it was the first time that the music was too loud. The next days the music was, according to the manager, not so loud. 

I can only recommend the hotel, if there is no festival in this area.",1,2014,06,15
36,Excellent hotel..close to beach!!,"Stayed with my family age 12 and 10..gorgeous modern hotel,brilliant buffet breakfast close to beach has a pool too ..easy to get about ...would defo go back !! Staff very friendly and helpful ! A must is open top bus tour it was a great way of seeing the city and the sights !!!The nou camp was brilliant if u love footie it's a must ,we took kids to a match we booked our tickets when we got there as it was cheaper ..wonderful trip..Barcelona truly amazing!!",5,2014,06,12
36,Great Hilton Hotel in Barcelona!!,"I stayed here with my partner earlier in February of this year while he was on a business trip.  I was left to act as the tour guide for 5 other spouses.  The hotel has great views of the city and the waterfront.  It is very conveniently close to a large mall across the street, the ocean to the west and to public transportation Rail and Tram.  The restaurant on the 2nd floor was great but was a bit too pricey for your average guest, in my opinion but as a contingent of the conference it was great.  I can easily suggest this hotel.  The bar in the lobby was awesome and the bartender every night knew how to treat our group to a night cap.",5,2014,06,10
36,Great location and service.,"Recently stayed at the Hilton Diagonal Mar in Barcelona for a few nights. Location was very convenient and felt ""safe."" I did not feel uncomfortable walking around the area at night, and the hotel is very close to the metro. Hotel was clean and comfortable, and found staff very helpful. Would highly recommend to anyone travelling to Barcelona.",4,2014,06,10
36,Stay at Hilton Diagonal Mar,"We stayed at the Hilton Diagonal Mar just prior to and after a cruise out of Barcelona the first week of June.
On the May 30th stay we stayed in a room on the water side and were kept awake due to a concert held on the beach until 2am.  When we called the front desk that came up with ear plugs, which somewhat helped. It would have been nice to have been warned ahead of time by the front desk  or offered a city side room.

On the June 7th visit, we had problems with a toilet water closet that wouldn't stop running. When we called maintenance , they were responsive although it took at hour to repair.

Otherwise, we were happy with this hotel. It is across from a shopping mall with many restaurants and stores. Bus and Metro stations are nearby and we took advantage if them, it was easy to get around the city from here.
Pool was nice, enjoyed great sangria from the poolside bar. We did kit use the restaurants in site.

We did enjoy our stay, and would recommend this hotel , Hilton usually does not disappoint.",4,2014,06,08
36,Perfect service & facilities,"My parents stayed in the Hilton Hotel Diagonal Mar in Barcelona for a couple of days. Since the start, the service was perfect! Staff was extremely friendly and the rooms 100% clean. Beds were very comfortable and they had a view on the sea! Facilities such as the hotel bar and the pool are extremely well kept and great to relax! Thanks to the perfect service and facilities the stay of my parents has been unforgettable.  Thanks, Hilton Diagonal Mar for going the extra mile!",5,2014,06,08
36,Great Hotel and Location,"I have just read a review of this hotel posted 1 week ago by Rvrman who said that the hotel was miles from the centre of town and there was nothing to do or eat in the area. This is nonsense. We have just spent 7 nights at this hotel and there is a huge shopping centre opposite the hotel where we could buy all the bottles of water we needed, plus restaurants. 300 yards takes you to the beach with numerous beach bars and restaurants. The tourist bus stops at the bottom of the street and the metro stop is only around the corner.This is fantastic Hilton with a 350degree view of the city from the Executive Lounge on the 15th floor and a beautiful outdoor pool area with lots of sun loungers and parasols.  We will definitely visit again.",5,2014,06,07
36,Great Gold Lounge,"The gold hilton member lounge at this hotel is wonderful. Great European style breakfast with homemade muesli and fresh rolls with cheese. Every evening free wine and snacks. Lovely view of the sea. While this hotel is a little far from the Barcelona sights, in problem grabbing the subway and in a few stops at any of the sights. 
Only wish is that the front desk staff were more helpful. The gold lounge staff was great though. Much prefer this Hilton in its classic warm style decor vs. the Marriott AC hotel next door that is all cement and cold decor.",4,2014,06,06
36,"Good hotel, great location","We stayed here on a 2 night break and had a thoroughly good time. The hotel was as you would expect from a Hilton, good size room, well equipped and maintained and very helpful front desk staff.

The location is excellent, a little out of the way of the main attractions (so a fair bit quieter) but easy to reach Las Ramblas and the like for a €10 cab or public transport starting with the tram right outside the front door.

The bar prices were what you would expect in a hotel of this type but there are plenty of other places to eat and drink locally. Overall, I would return.",4,2014,06,05
36,One night stay,"The hotel was very convenient as we were coming from a cruise line to stay for one night.  The facility was clean, the lobby was spacious and the services were extensive.  The room was very comfortable and clean and the bathroom was neat and well tended.  Overall, a nice place to stay.",4,2014,06,04
36,THE place to stay if you're going to a conference,"Fab location next to congress centre - rooms of the normal Hilton standard. If you can, I would definitely recommend upgrading to the Exec floor so you can use the lounge - it's fab and the view up there is great! I've already booked it for the next conference in September!",4,2014,06,04
36,Great hotel !,"Checkin was fast and efficient. Got there already at 14:00 and checkin time was 16:00 so I was happy that my room already was ready for me.

Got a corner room on the top floor. Room was in good condition and fairly spacious.

Visited the Executive lounge for appetizers in the evening. They were ok, but I noted on the positive side that all the wines they offered were organic and tasted great. Very good !

Breakfast was also in the lounge and was quite ok.

Tried the outside swimming pool located on the second floor. Plenty of sun chairs and guard on duty all the time.

Note that this hotel is not directly in the city centre. But public transportation options are available close by. If you don't want to travel to/from the city centre, choose a different hotel in the city centre instead.

There are a few dining options in the shopping centre which is just across the street.

All in all a great stay and I would definetely stay again.",4,2014,06,03
36,Hilton Diagonal Mar Stay!,"Very nice and cool hotel with wonderful views and first grade amenities all round! The Executive Lounge was particularly helpful both for light refreshments and a place to host a few guests - business or leisure, without extra cost! note that you are allowed only 1 or 2 guests only... I enjoyed my stay and would like to visit again! You should try it!",5,2014,06,03
36,Good hotel & facilities,"Standard Hilton fare, room was nice with views to sea.  
Bear in mind that this is at the end of Diagonal, so it's miles from the centre.  Trams run up diagonal and there is a metro station nearby.  
There is nothing to do, or eat for that matter in the area, unless you are at a conference or in my case photographing the Prima Vera music festival, that happens very year.  
One gripe is that in this day and age paying €25 for wi-fi is a rip off, it's free in the lobby, but not in the breakfast room, so you cannot read mails etc while having b/fast!!!  And €5.75 for a tiny bottle of water is also a joke, I expect to get at least a free bottle in the room.  Buy a bottle in the shop centre opposite.
Staff were friendly and helpful, but check out lines long.",4,2014,05,31
36,short but great visit,We stayed here for I night after travelling from Paris and before starting a road trip of Northern Spain. The location is good for both leisure and business travellers. Hotel is modern with contemporary décor and artwork in many areas. Rooms are spacious and the views from the higher floors are spectacular. All of the employees that we encountered in our brief visit were helpful and professional. This is a great place from which to explore Barcelona.,5,2014,05,29
36,Excellent Hotel for Business & Pleasure,"Even though that this hotel is not set in the heart of the city. You can access everything easy from this location wehther you use the tube, tram or taxi. The food and service is of the Hilton standard. I would definitely stay here again on buiness or with my family.",5,2014,05,28
36,Nice few days,"Stayed here on a work trip and as conferences go it was run very well. 
November is probably not the best time to fully appreciate a hotel by the beach and utilise the pool but the location was lovely to go for a stroll in the evening. Shopping centre across the road also for a bit of distraction though! It's a bit of a walk from Las Ramblas so we took a taxi in for a few Euro on the nights we were there.  The food was lovely and staff weren't imposing. 
Rooms were large beds comfortable but I think Wifi was only in the main lobby area. Bit of a drawback. 
Lovely hotel for the meeting but I'd say much more appreciated during the warmer weather.",4,2014,05,27
36,Clean and friendly,We stayed in this hotel for two nights before a cruise. The room was very clean and nice. The hotel is across the road from a large shopping complex with a food hall and some nice restaurants. The shopping centre does not open until about 10 am and there is not much else around if you are thinking of having breakfast somewhere else so having breakfast at the hotel is the best option. They will offer you a good deal at the time of booking in. The hop on hop off bus is just up the road about 100 metres so very easy to catch and then return to the hotel at the end of the day. Although it is not close to La Rambla it is a nice quiet location. I would recommend this hotel.,4,2014,05,27
36,Chill Out in Barca,"My 4th stay in Barca at Hilton. I need to admit I was rewarded as great customer and HH diamond. I was welcomed at 10 am with access at lounge, room was ready and the Suite was simply outstanding on 21st floor see view. Swimming pool is perfect to chill out and swim and recover energy ! I had the option to have a late check out. So overall perfect hotel for your stay in Barcelona. Metro is 5 min walking and you are in plaza catulana in 20 min.",4,2014,05,25
36,ok,"look the place was nice and clean but the reception  staff were not very accommodating in assisting us on the sites to see .toooo busy to offer any assistance ..  we had a nice buffet breakfast but because they had a conference it was extremely busy but the staff waiters were helpful  couldn't fault them they went out of their way to even make the toast and coffee for us. 
we were looking forward to having a spa after our long flight  but they don't have one and the pool was a bit cold for us . .. either get on the hop on hop off bus or hire a taxi to take you around Barcelona .
the shopping centre across from the hotel is great . with a nice Italian restaurant .
the gentleman  { doorman} that got some taxis for us was wonderful..",3,2014,05,25
36,An amazing hotel in an amazing city,"We recently completed a 7 night stay at the Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona not only is this an amazing hotel, but our experience staying there enhanced our vacation time in Barcelona. It was wonderful coming ""home"" to the Hilton every evening after spending the entire day out and about exploring the city, then we would head out again on most evenings.

The Hilton is conveniently located just a short walk to the metro station, so it was easy to get everywhere in Barcelona and we never had to take a taxi anywhere. The neighborhood where the hotel is located is also very nice. The streets were very well lit, everything felt very open and spacious, the ocean is nearby and it's a very walkable area. There is a very large mall literally across the street, with lots of restaurants, but we didn't come to Barcelona to eat in mall  but it's convenient for those that do.  There are also a variety of shops and cafes that you pass on the short walk to the metro, with a wonderful ""neighborhood"" bakery that seemed to be open all hours. If you are planning on doing a tour of the city, the hotel is very close to the hop on/hop off bus stop. 

 Before I get further into my comments I should state that I am a Hilton Diamond member and I realize that affords a level of benefits which were excellent and we had a wonderful room and the access to the executive lounge was great. Being vegetarians, they went out of their way to accommodate us even before our arrival getting an email from the Executive Lounge staff asking if they can do anything for us. 

 As for our room, it was phenomenal,  very spacious and clean, with great views of city.  The bathroom was wonderful and large with a great shower and separate bath.  The hallways on every floor were wood paneled and you would even feel good on your way to the room.  

If you are a Hilton Honors member, chances are you are going to consider this hotel (there is also another Hilton in the downtown area) but we made the right choice with this property.  However for those thinking about this hotel (or any other hotel) one most consider the overall property, the staff, the rooms, the ambiance, the location and the neighborhood and the context of the hotel within the city of Barcelona and on all those counts this is a great place to stay. If you are spending anytime at the hotel before heading out there is an excellent gym and a very nice outdoor pool and sundeck . We were there in early May and more than a few people were swimming, I can imagine how nice it would be in the summer months.

If you have access to the Executive Lounge, there is an outdoor area with amazing views of the city and the ocean, you can se the Sagrada off in the distance and onto the Mountains and there is a nice selection both in the mornings for breakfast and in the late afternoon.  The staff is also very helpful if you need directions or information,- everyone speaks perfect english.  There are 2 computers and a printer right across trom the front desk, both mac and pc. which we took advantage of. If you do need a taxi, they are always right outside the hotel.  

Lastly, this hotel is not in the ""tourist"" area, but that's what we liked about it the most. A short walk to the metro station and you can be anywhere in Barcelona within 30 minutes.",5,2014,05,23
36,Good place to stay,"The greatest plus was the breakfast and the personel on the breakfast- they were verz kind, efficiant and polite. Also compliments to the breakfast seletion and ambient.
The minus is-FO staff. I had an feeling thet everything is too hard for them, they were polite but it was visible that they tried to be polite. When asking for a rate fot 3rd night they did not even offer to call inhouse reservation department for us- it was easier to say thet we have to call them directly...
Big thanks to the sales representative that allowed special rate for the final night ( after we personaly contacted ofcourse). 
Compliments to the bar as well- they were great!
Room amazing with a good view, housekeeping department doing excelent job as always.
Overall- very pleasant, wish that the FO team was performing little bit better so this review but be excelent insted of very good. 
Overall",4,2014,05,22
36,"Pre-cruise stay, good experience","We stayed here prior to our Med. cruise and found this to be a very nice hotel.  We used points so our stay was free.  The staff were excellent, very friendly and helpful, spoke to us in English with no issues.  It was raining when we departed and the bell desk called a taxi over (there were many in the area, though a short walk) and escorted us with an umbrella to embark.

Having read reviews in advance, we knew that the internet was not included (except in the lobby area, and you can get the code from personnel in the bar or front desk) nor was the buffet breakfast.  Since both were at a cost of 25E each, we made due without.

We were given an accessible room which we did not need, but it did provide very spacious hallway and bathroom as a result.  I did not like that the bathroom had no North American style shower (only a large bath with spray attachment that would not extend to standing height - perhaps this was because of an accessible room, or perhaps it's just because it's more of a European style).

Location is very near the sea (we had a sea and city view from our room) and right across from a very large shopping mall with many shops and restaurants.",4,2014,05,18
36,Fantastic Hotel,"We stayed here last March and had an amazing time, put near to the top of the hotel with wonderful views, breakfast was fab, location excellent and the staff were great too.

I would return tomorrow.

Thank you team!",5,2014,05,17
36,HILTON DIAGONAL MAR BARCELONA,"It was a great experience. All team members are extraordinary, professional and friendly. Good communication near a shooping area and metro, bus. The room was perfectly.  Was a pleasure to stay in Hilton Diagonal Mar! Thank you!",5,2014,05,16
36,Dissapointed,"We booked for 5 days for business in Barcelona, for well informed travellers, one of the most overrated city in the world.. For the first time after many travels I noticed that this hotel did not had personnel to help you with your luggage. The intern at the desk was friendly and offered a upgrade for 40 Euro a day to the executive room. In the description at their site, do not get confused about the ''relax zone, ( a chair) or the'' working zone'' ( the desk). And the rooms are exactly the same then the others normal rooms. With the upgrade comes a continental breakfast, well if you do not expect much do not get disappointed, the normal breakfast was 25 euro a person, and big amount of money for this breakfast buffet I noticed. In the night we woke up several times by the noise of the water supply, apparently on the higher floors of the building the water pressure is not good. So we got another room (without any excuses or something complementary,), with front sea sight, but there is a permanent fair with until 24.00 h a lot of noise and music in front of that side of the hotel.. And of course, also this hotel has no door spring/closer
so your neighbours can slam the door in the middle of the night.
The hotel ask ( still) an incredible amount for Wi-Fi.
So no Hilton for us next time!",2,2014,05,16
36,Outstanding View,Very Nice Hotel.  Great view from the rooms on Sea Side of hotel.  Staff in the Ex lounge was the best.  Help with all requests.  Nice BK.  Staff on front desk and bell men were very good.  No problem finding someone that spoke English.  Room up to date and in very good shape.  Bathroom very clean.  Maid service better than average.  So nice that we will stay there in November 2014 again.,5,2014,05,14
36,Great hotel near the Beach,"We stayed in this Hilton for 3-nights and it was great.  This hotel was located near the beach, across the street from the mall and close to a metro station.  It was just outside the main tourist area which made it a little quiter, but just a short cab or metro ride to all the main attractions.  Would stay here again without question.",5,2014,05,08
36,Good brand and hotel but poor service,"I like hilton brand above all, and I really expected to stay here. Location was a little bit far from the center, but beautiful view made up for everything. Also hotel was close to the big shopping mall and night market, and it was very fun! One thing made us very angry was window cleaning work without any notice. I was naked for taking shower, and very surprised to see the man cleaned outside window.",3,2014,05,07
36,Worked better than I expected,"I was here on business and my client is in the same complex as the hotel, so it was not negotiable.  I wasn't sure it would work to see the city, though, since we worked until 6:30-7:30 every night.  It turned out great.  My room had a view of the sea, and was large and bright, all looked new and clean.   I could walk or run on the beach (a block away) in the mornings or evenings, and could metro to the other parts of the city in 15 minutes (El Maresme-Forum stop is a couple blocks away)  The metro is really easy to use, and affordable, and we  were comfortable walking on the streets at night.  We bought the 10 trip ticket for 4 days, and it worked great.  We only had breakfast, which was good, not awesome (stay away from the coffee carafes, coffee tastes like it's sat for days). We walked along the beacj from the hotel to Barceloneta and then over to Passeig de Gracia, really nice walk with good food at the end.  The hotel has a lovely large outdoor pool and pool deck, was too cool in the evenings when we were there to take care of it.  There are computers and a printer in the lobby to buy and print out your attraction tickets, which is nice.  The front desk was OK, didn't win awards for their enthusiasm to help, I think they assume the computer will serve as your concierge.",4,2014,05,07
36,Excellent hotel good location,"We stopped here for a week. Had a lovely room with sea view. Metro was a short walk away so was a large shopping centre (which my wife loved) and also tour bus's stopped out side hotel.

Staff and food in hotel were lovely and we had access to exec lounge which was lovely. The outside pool bar area was also  a lovely relaxed area to go to. 

Would recommend this hotel as although it's not central it's easy to get into the town but there are plenty of restaurants in the shopping centre if you don't want to eat in hotel.",5,2014,05,04
36,Excellent hotel just outside the centre of Barcelona.,"This is a light, modern hotel in the new area of Barcelona. It is about ten minutes by taxi from the centre. The rooms are modern, the staff helpful and the overall ambience very good. I would recommend it as because it is not right in the centre of Barcelona it is slightly cheaper but tis is more than made up for by the high standards from the staff. It might need some slight updating to be truly 5 start - but overall I would be very positive.",5,2014,05,01
36,Two nights of bliss!,"Stayed here for 2 nights before cruising the Med with Celebrity as part of a package with Virgin holidays.
Upgraded to a premium/corner room which was on the 17th floor and as it was on the corner had 270 degree views from the beach on our left, round through the Sagrada and onto the Mountains. The bath had a low full width window so you could bathe and admire the view from the high vantage point.
The pool facilities were excellent and the breakfast was 1st class.
The hotel is out of the old town but is near the beach (about 200m away).
It is on  the ""green route"" of the topless tour bus which is ideal as we just used a 2 day ticket on those to get around and take in all of the sights.
A very pleasant stay and an ideal start to a very special holiday.",5,2014,04,29
36,"Closed to public transport, however old furnitures and not suited for 5 star","The hotel locates near by public transportation and beach. However, the room status such as furniture is very bad condition. The light does not work properly. You cannot open the window to receive the sea breeze, unless you signed the letter of responsible. There is internet providing in the lobby area free of charge only. The amenities have to always ask, instead already providing in the room e.g. house shoes, shaving kit and bathrobes. We have to wait for two hours till the room can be check in at 16.00 o'clock.",2,2014,04,28
36,Mar-red by deposit request,"Very clean, exceptionally helpful and friendly staff. Hotel restaurant food and staff was also exceptional. Rooms are kept to a high standard. Our experience of this hotel was only marred by the request on arrival of a 150 euro deposit to cover any extras. Overall I rate this hotel as a 4 but would have happily given a five but for the deposit request. To be fair the option was given to disable the minibar and tv which we took.",4,2014,04,28
36,Please try harder,"My wife and I met some friends for a few days in Barcelona for a holiday. The siting of the hotel is good, but I have reservations about a number of features. The carpet in the corridors is very old with holes and splits that were potentially hazardous. The female concierge was not at all helpful, but the main problem was the fact that now, in 2014, internet access is not freely available except in the lobby and the Executive Lounge. TRhis in a hotel where I was paying several hundred euros a day.",3,2014,04,27
36,Great New Location,This hotel is new and located in the newly developed area of Barcelona. The Staff is very helpful and the facilities are first class. The Executive lounge staff is very helpful in facilitating any tours or assisting with reservations!,5,2014,04,26
36,Nice Hotel By The Sea,"Firstly I'd like to say to all those people who say its 25-30 euros from the airport to the hotel, no it really isn't. Unless you've all pre-booked your taxi? we paid both ways just over 40 Euros. Not cheap but we arrived just after 11pm at night.

The hotel itself is lovely. Our room was on the 8th floor and we had a great view overlooking the beach. If you were on a higher floor I expect it would be even better.

Our room was basic but good, but you're in Barcelona, you're not going to spend the whole time in your room. The hairdryer I can confirm is very good. Tea & Coffee is supplied in the room, they only leave 2 little pots of milk!!!! We ended up getting milk from our table at breakfast, as we don't have black tea or very very strong coffee. The bed was hard isn but comfortable. Bath/Shower can't fault. My husband found that he could link his phone to the tv to play what music he had on there whilst we got ready in the mornings and evenings.

Wardrobe nice and big, no complaints there. But we were only staying 4 nights, so it didn't really matter. We both loved the sign by the safe warning us about suffocation, I have no idea whose head would have fit in there, but we found it highly amusing. Always good having a safe in your room. 

Wi-fi in the hotel is restricted to the hotel lobby/bar area, for which you have to get the access code. If you want to use it in your room it's about 25 euros or something silly. Not good if you're a businessman travelling abroad, having to sit in reception to use the wi-fi! My husband always stays online when he can, so he made full use of it.

Drinks in the hotel are charged to your room. 12 euros for a beer, and for a glass of not very good white wine 8 euros. The beer was good. The wine, no! We've had better delivered from Virgin Wines. The mini bar in your room doesn't have a price list, so I dread to think what you'd pay for a bottle of water!

We bought water whilst we were out and filled our empty bottles up using the water cooler thats in the gym on the 2nd floor, its open 24 hours so we could get water whenever we wanted. 

Breakfast is served on the first floor, it's a great selection. I would advise get there early isn, as we got there on our last morning just after 9am and it was packed out. A good selection of cereals, fruit, hot stuff. The cooked breakfast things were actually quite nice. Not had that on holiday before! Danish pastries, cheese, ham, bread. Coffee and tea, plus a selection of 4 different juices. You won't go hungry.

Right opposite the hotel is the Diagonal mar shopping centre, which is filled with bars, cafes, places to eat and shop. Not that we shopped in there, but sat outside in the sun and had a few beers, a lot cheaper than the hotel!

The metro is about 5 minutes round the corner, if that to be honest. Buy a T10 card, its the cheapest and easiest way to travel.We were there for 4 days and didn't use all our trips on the card
so we gave our 2 trips on each card to the man on reception. It's about a 10 minute trip right into the heart of the town, Ramblas & The Gothic Quarter. Which is fine, as once you're there you tend to walk around anyway. 

If you are thinking of going to Park Guell, book online! We got up there, queued for our tickets, got to the stand at 1145, only to be told we couldn't go in til 230/3pm! So we said we'd go back the following day at 11am. they're really strict and only let you in at that time. We thought if we were 15 minutes early they'd let us in, but no. Sat and had a cup of tea. Beware of the seagulls and pigeons at the cafe. A lady had a muffin in her hand and a pigeon swiped it out of her hands!!! My advice, stick to drinks!

If you're a football fan as me and my husband are, try and get tickets to go and see Barcelona play. Go on their official website before you go. We were lucky we booked our tickets a week before we flew, explained that we'd be in the hotel from the thursday, they sent out tickets to the hotel the day before which was brilliant. the metro ends at midnight, so if you do go to a late match, as we did, get out of Camp Nou quickly and head to the station. It took us 45 minutes to get back to the hotel, not too bad considering its quite a way away, and how many people were also catching the metro that night!

All in all we had a great stay in Barcelona. This is a lovely hotel, it's nice to be bait far away from all the hustle and bustle, if you want that you can go into town. If you booked a hotel in town, I imagine it'd be very noisy at night. This hotel, it's nice and peaceful. Plus the beach is just over the road which is beautiful. If you're not a beach person, we used the pool area which is lovely.",4,2014,04,25
36,Nice Location,"The hotel was in a perfect location, walking distance to the sea, shopping, restaurants, and hop on, hop off tour bus.  Service was excellent, staff were friendly and approachable.  Far enough away from the hustle and bustle of the city center but very easy to reach via bus and taxi.",5,2014,04,25
36,Beautiful Barcelona Hotel,"I arrived at this hotel on Holy Thursday with a three night reservation that had me checking out on Easter Sunday. I honestly wish I could have stayed longer because of how wonderful this property was. The Hilton at Diagonal Mar is, first of all, exceptionally clean and modern. There were hardwood floors in my room, as well as a glass counter and sink in the bathroom with an anti-fog mirror directly behind them. The bathroom also had excellent amenities as far as hygiene products go, and there was a fully stocked minibar with both snacks and drinks that eagerly awaited me in the lower cabinet of the large dresser across from the comfortable bed upon which the plasma screen TV stood. The closet had double cherry wood doors, with ample hangers and a large amount of space for storing clothes or other personal items. I had a wonderful view of the beach, which is just one of the many great things located very close to this hotel. The pool also has its own large and luxurious pool, gym, and restaurant. The metro is a short walk away with only a few stops before reaching such places as La Sagrada Familia or Casa Mila. There is a very upscale shopping mall with great restaurants and stores directly across the street from the hotel. The staff members were exceptionally friendly and prompt to take care of my every need or request. As a twenty-year-old college student traveling alone, my parents gave me access to our Hilton Honors membership and account upon my check-in. I was pleasantly surprised when the receptionist took this information to upgrade me to the awesome room of which I earlier wrote, and that the hotel went on to offer me a delicious and wide variety breakfast each morning on their executive floor...all for FREE! In sum, I would highly recommend this hotel. The food, cleanliness, rooms, staff, location...everything was fantastic!",5,2014,04,21
36,Amazing Holiday!,My boyfriend and I (both 21) stayed here for 10 days for a site seeing holiday and beach holiday. When we got in the room we couldn't believe how perfect the view was! We were on floor 12 and from our window we could see the city (top of La Sagrada) and the sea. The room was spotless and was the perfect temperature. We had breakfast every morning and every type of food was available and every fruit juice and drink you could think of. There was a balcony as well which we ate our breakfast at some mornings. We had a large tv in our room and the bathroom was very big and beautifully decorated. About 200 metres away was the sea and across the road was a shopping centre which had restaurants and an american restaurant we ate at too! wonderful holiday for our first one away as a couple in seven years.,5,2014,04,21
36,Great hotel,"The hotel is very good we had an executive room which gave access to an amazing lounge with free drinks and free alcohol after 6pm. The breakfast in there is amazing and there is a great selection of fruit and pastries. The rooms are very clean and spacious and all the staff are very helpful and will do most things you ask them to. There are great travel connections from the hotel or nearby such as taxi, Tourist Bus, Bus, Metro, Tram and easy to walk to and from the centre (if you like walking!).",5,2014,04,19
36,Nice business hotel,"Nice meeting facilities, with the excellent Hilton service. For tourists, I wouldn't recommend this hotel, as the location is not so good. Not much to see or do in the neighborhood. Rooms are very spacious but not sound proof!",4,2014,04,19
36,Fantastic Hotel,"We were booked in 5 nights and arrived before our official check in time 1600hrs hoping just to drop off our bags. We were met with a warm greeting from all the staff and allocated our room straight away as it was ready. We managed to get a room on the 23 floor with a fantastic sea view, the room was spacious, very clean and very quiet, could never hear a peep during our stay, fantastic for a relaxing break. The hotel staff were so helpful with typical visitors questions and they had the answers we were looking for and all spoke excellent English. This is an ideal location with a fantastic beach 10 min walk from the hotel, it has its own clean terraced pool area with tables, chairs and sun loungers with bar facilities should you not wish to venture out any time during your stay. The Tram and Metro system is excellent and simple, it can take you into the heart of Barcelona in around 15 min. it is situated 10 min away directly behind the shopping plaza which has all the shops and eating places you may need if you don't want to go into the town. We had a great time we thought we were going out of season but the weather was great temperature well into the 20s but cooler at nights. We definitely recommend this hotel for value, Cleanliness, location and the helpfulness of all the staff.",5,2014,04,18
36,Great location and Service,"I really liked my stay .
Very close to a bus station and metro station.
Breakfast was great.
The staff was great and very helpful.
Check in - check out was very fast.
The rooms are very clean.
In front of a great mall where someone can find anything he needs.",5,2014,04,17
36,Great hotel but a bit far from city centre.,"Stayed for a weekend in beginning of April. Perfect hotel up to Hilton standards in terms of accommodation. Arrived very late at night after a long public transport journey from BCN airport. The hotel is located in the opposite side of the city, so you have to take an airport bus to get to down town and then metro to hotel Hotel is 5-7 minutes walk from the station. The whole journey from airport took around 50 minutes. Reception desk staff very polite and welcoming. The have an offer of breakfast + wifi for 30 euro a day, which is maybe worth considering. Breakfast alone is 25 euros unless included in your rate. They located me to 18th floor with partial sea view, which was very nice. Room was spacious and spotless. Great Hilton bedding and bathrobes. 
Breakfast restaurant was great in contrast with breakfast itself. Waiters are a bit careless, I had to actually chase one to get some tea. Under normal Hilton standards waiter appear at your table 5 minutes max after you are seated. Buffet choice was good, however quality of food was not so great. Pastries were old and quite tasteless actually.They should definitely work on this.",4,2014,04,16
36,Great destination,"My son and I spent a few days here over his spring break, and were totally happy with the experience.  The hotel is clean and modern, all the amenities you would expect, excellent breakfast buffet, English-speaking staff, very comfortable beds.  We had a room on a high floor with a view of both the ocean and the city. Five minute walk to metro and 15 minutes to city center; we went to city and back probably twice per day no problem.  But the hotel location is very quiet, no urban noise or congestion.  Staff was very helpful with arrangements.  Will definitely return.",5,2014,04,16
36,Totally surprised at the excellence of this place,"Great rooms, value and service. Good executive lounge with perfect view of city. Rooms very nice. Pool area looked great except closed this time of year. Very close to the ocean and easy to get a cab into city.",5,2014,04,14
36,Classy and confortable,"We went with my husband in our anniversary, the staff was amazing, they prepared our room with special gifts for the occasion and treat us like kings! We enjoyed the facilities, the room and the great view. Perfect for couples, family.",4,2014,04,13
36,Lives up to its brand name!,"Excellent choice for someone who wishes to stay a bit away from the city center. About 15-20 minutes from the airport by taxi, 5 minutes away from metro or tram, and a mall with plenty of choices for shopping and dining just across the road.
We actually used the in-room dining service twice and were quite happy with the quality of the food, although we haven’t ordered anything really fancy. Breakfast was more than adequate, room was clean, spacious and perfectly quiet. Very polite staff too, always with a smile on their faces. In a nutshell, pretty much everything you would expect from a Hilton!",5,2014,04,10
36,"Nice view, friendly staff",We stayed in Diagonal Mar for 3 nights. The location is right near to the beach. Ask for a room with a view. Taking the cab to the La Rambla district is cheap but you can also use the metro. The staff is very helpful. There is a lounge on the executive floor with a nice view.,4,2014,04,10
36,Very good hotel,"Very good hotel close to the beach, away from the busy center of Barcelona..I was there on vacation, open tour bus has a stop in front of hotel, service is very even if its a busy hotel, caters to busuness tourists groups, would recommend to anyone..",4,2014,04,10
36,Excellent beach property w/ great amenities! A great stay!,"This is an awesome property right on the beach with a great shopping mall and excellent dining literally right across the street!  Loved the services, the beach view, the executive lounge amenities, and the modern facilites!  The executive lounge served a terrific breakfast each day looking out over the sunrise on the Mediterranean Ocean and each night we enjoyed a glass of wine  and snacks while watching the sunset!!  Absolutely GORGEOUS!!  The personnel were extremely helpful with us given we did not speak spanish, helped with power converters, money exchange and directions and upgraded our room!  We had a fantastic time here (4 days), I would highly recommend it!",5,2014,04,09
36,enjoyment,We were very happy with the service in the Executive Lounge. We always look forward to this area of the hotel. It is perhaps the most important part of the hotel for us. We can relax and enjoy visiting with the fellow guests.,5,2014,04,09
36,Easily the Diamond in Hilton's Barcelona Hotels Crown.,"Just had a fantastic long weekend at the hotel with my wife staying 4 nights, on the executive floor 22.  We had a great room overlooking the sea, and full use of the executive lounge where we took breakfast everyday and usually had a pre-dinner drink before either dinning in the hotel or going to one of the many restaurants that are across the road in or around the Diagonal shopping centre.
Even though it is not in central Barcelona the transport links are close by (max 5 min walk to either the tram or the metro). And the motorway is between the hotel and beach as well although you don't get any noise from it.
We found the staff very friendly and extremely helpful and this made our stay even better.
We dinned in the Indigo Restaurant twice and were very impressed with the quality of the food and its costs which is very reasonable for a 5 star hotel such as this.
Going out of season (late March) did hold one disappointment for me which was the swimming pool was not open for use.  It will be now as the season starts in April.  
This is a most definate recommendation and we will most certainly be going back.",5,2014,04,04
36,One of the best,"I stayed there for 5 days .. The hotel is clean.. Modern.. Very nice rooms and space.. Comfortable bed and pillows.. Excellent room service.
The breakfast is normal.. 
The location is excellent.. It is just beside the convention center.. There is a shopping mall just beside the hotel with a variety of restaurants.
In order to go to Barcelona attractions.. The hotel is just beside the stop of the tourists hop on hop off bus.. The green line
I highly recommend this hotel.. 
",4,2014,04,03
36,A Must Stay In Barcelona,"The Hilton Diagonal Del Mar Barcelona is a wonderful place to stay. The location is close to the beach so the view is beautiful, and close to the Metro so getting around the city is a pleasure as there are many things to see and do. There is also the large Del Mar mall directly behind the hotel. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it as a must stay on Barcelona.",5,2014,04,02
36,Great stay,"Stayed here for a single night. The hotel is quite central and in a nice location. The staff speak good English and were polite. The breakfast was a real highlight of the stay. The room was just adequate, nothing fancy but reasonably. Will definitely stay here again.",5,2014,03,31
36,Sub-standard for a Hilton,"The room had a very nice view on the see, but the room was not at th standard level experienced in other Hilton hotels; the bathroom was disapointing and the beds were too small and not as comfortable as in other Hiltons. The biggest problem for me is the outrageous price for access to internet with in addition a louzy connection. If it would not be for the view, I would not recommned this hotel.",3,2014,03,31
36,Very nice stay and warm crew,"checked in at 11:00 pm the reception assured a quick check in and went to the room , clean room in general and good view , the bathroom was good but with shortage of some little detailes lacking of simple things like ear sticks  , room service was very helpfull and they cleaned the room everyday , the breakfast was nice for the next 6 days , the lunch was good and the cheff assured a good variety ,",4,2014,03,30
36,Barcelona? Conference? Hilton Diagonal Mar!,"First class hotel right next to the Conference centre. 3.5 kilometres from the Ramblas, a taxi will cost you 10 euros. The hotel is modern, very clean and has all the amenities you would expect from a Hilton. The rooms are a good size, ask for one on the higher floors with a sea view, beds very comfortable. I was there for three nights, to get away from the ""business"" traffic this hotel attracts I paid the fare and found a nice restaurant down the Ramblas, Paella of course and for a couple of hours tasted life as a tourist and not as a convention attendee. The public areas at the hotel are open, lacking a little in atmosphere or even a theme, the bar is open to the lobby and drinks are not cheap, a pint will put you back 9.5 euros. There are a number of hotels feeding off the conference centre traffic, by far this is the best one. In essence this is a first class business hotel, because of its location I would score it down if you want to use it as a base for visiting the city as a tourist.",4,2014,03,23
36,Poorly maintained hotel with great service staff / location,"Stayed here for 5 nights and realized that hotel needs serious renovation and maintenance. Following points in particular:
1. Elevators are noisy and their door keep on opening / closing and you get stuck. It happened three times with me in 5 days.
2. Shaving mirror / door latches are broken for quite sometime and not repaired.
3. Corridor carpets are dirty and old 

Location is good.",3,2014,03,22
36,Great experience and stay for week long visit,Very nice hotel and the executive lounge on 15th floor is awesome.   The staff in the lounge was superb.  Eric was there a few days and was extremely helpful with local list of sights to see.  I asked for 23rd floor prior to check in and when I arrived it was nice to see I had a room reserved on the 23rd floor with a view of the sea.     Beautiful hotel and very friendly staff,5,2014,03,18
36,Nice hotel.  Convenient Location,"Had a chance to visit Barcelona with my wife to celebrate our 20th Wedding Anniv.  The facility is very nice--including reasonable room size.  Thanks to Hilton status we were able to routinely visit the executive lounge to view the Mediterranean Sea from 15 floors up.  Great staff and a full on shopping mall is across the street.  Found this very helpful bc we arrived day one without luggage.  Also, there is a cab line just outside this hotel which can come in handy because you will likely need to travel into downtown to see some of the sights.  If taxis aren't your thing you can try the Metro underground rail system.  Works well after you purchase your card.  All in all a great stay.  We had a very helpful concierge who helped us purchase tickets to sites prior to attending so as to minimize the time we had to wait in line.",4,2014,03,17
36,Modern Hilton,"This is a modern hotel with large rooms and  timber floors (which I always find  noisy). It is a distance out from Plaza de Catalunya and the taxi fares vary with each driver - sometimes just trying to rip you off, but generally around 12 Euros.
The views from the high floors are good in both directions but the city view I think, is more interesting. Our room had 2 showers - a separate stall (which I am always overjoyed to see in a hotel room) and one over the bath. Our friends who had a similar room, had a bidet instead of the stall. The executive lounge was rather sparse food-wise, but generous with alcohol.",4,2014,03,16
36,good facilities and short walk to port,"I used this hotel for a conference and the facilities are good. The rooms are spacious , staff are friendly and my room ( 1421 ) was very clean and tidy. This is 2.5km from the olympic port and approx €10 in a taxi from the gothic qtr, approx €30 from the airport. The food in the hotel bar is good ( burgers ) and the staff are great - especially Daniella who is very attentive and makes mean cocktails !",4,2014,03,15
36,NICE GOOD HOTEL,"very nice place to be , good location nice friendly people , clean rooms great view , very close to the metro station , close to city centre , a great area .All was good starting with the food , the room the great view of morning sunrise over the see ....Hope i'll be back soon .",4,2014,03,14
36,Nice,"The hotel is located some miles east from the ramblas and co
But there is a metro station next to it and a mall
The rooms a good and spacious, the vue is great 
The food is above correct
The service is quite correct
I attended an argument between two waiters in the restaurant and my order got delayed because of it I finally dismissed my order cause i was late and left.

But overall it s nice hotel ",4,2014,03,09
36,Excellent hotel,"Being a frequent buisness traveller to Barcelona (every month), I had the pleasure to experience this hotel during my last stay.  An excellent location, but most of all magnificent accommodation, view and service. I honestly can not think of any negative aspect. Definitely a must for business and leisure travelers. You cannot go wrong when choosing this hotel.",5,2014,03,07
36,Weekend Stay,"Stayed last weekend with friends for 2 nights.
Close to large shopping centre, Tube round the corner & Taxi rank just outside.
Monica who checked us in & out very helpfull, chatty & friendly.
Bar area was relaxing and Daniela who was on both evenings when we were there was very friendly & helpful. Even finding a chef to make us food after the kitchens were closed.
Just need to make the projecter showing the football project a bit bigger & lower down the wall for us football fans visiting to go to the Camp Nou as the lights from the ceiling were in the way of the view.",5,2014,03,06
36,A perfect stay..,"Stayed here recently with a few friends and I think it is actually the best Hilton in which I have stayed.  Great rooms, location, price and even the breakfast was excellent.  Taxis's right outside the hotel and Metro close by.  A taxi to La Ramblas was not that expensive and also a Metro trip was only 2 Euros per journey.

In addition, a very special thank you to Daniela who worked in the evenings on the bar, who went above and beyond to look after us.  She is a credit to the Hilton group.",5,2014,03,05
36,Great Hotel,"I recently stayed at this hotel the last week of February, 2014.  The hotel was extremely clean and nice.  The staff was very helpful and willing to accommodate any request.  Upon my arrival to the hotel, I had a wonderful check-in experience with Eddie.  He was amazing.  I received a room on the 21st floor that was not that spacious and I decided to inquire about upgrades.  He found a junior suite available for me at a very reasonable upgrade price.  Definitely would recommend the Executive Lounge Floors.  The lounge staff and amenities were very nice and worth the price.  The staff set up tours for me and restaurant reservations.  They were very knowledgeable and steered me in the right direction.  The hotel is near the metro stop, but there are ample taxis near the hotel.  However, ensure your taxi driver knows where they are going.  Most of the taxis were fine, but I had two taxis that did not know where they were going and it cost me 35 Euros for a trip that should have cost 17 Euros.  Definitely would recommend this property if going to Barcelona if you don't want to be in the heavy traffic areas.  On a side note, a plus of this hotel is there is a shopping center across the street with many shopping and eating options.  If you need help with anything, definitely recommend speaking to Eddie he is very knowledgeable and willing to help.",5,2014,03,03
36,Wise Choice,"This wasn't my first Barcelona trip, but it was my first trip as a mom. Dad had a conference, so Rock Star Baby and I joined and we all spent a week here in February of this year. We had an excellent visit. The hotel is located a few miles away from downtown. Granted I'm from NY and get around easily, but please know that the public transit system in Barcelona is excellent. The train(metro), tram and busses are easily accessible to the hotel and served us well. FYI, all three are very stroller(and wheelchair) friendly. We had daily adventures, some far from the hotel (Baby Bongo class!) and it was a breeze.
Our room was spacious enough for a crib and for the baby to toddle around and play. Housekeeping were great about coming by daily despite my having to navigate around baby hours and seriously that room was spotless. I'm not a huge eater, but thankfully my kid is. We enjoyed breakfast every morning and the Indigo Restaurant staff were fantastic. They got to know us and my son was digging the hell out of the attention. All were quick to offer me tips on baby friendly spots and were just hip to my needs.

The desk staff, restaurant staff and housekeeping crew were all fantastic, and especially a staff person named Zanna. I met her while enjoying a lovely wine at the Pistaccio Lounge there in the lobby. She is friendly, helpful and fabulous. Everyone was really. 
All good.",5,2014,03,02
36,Good Hotel on the Sea front.,"Well located, fantastic view on the sea, city center is few minutes away from a cab ride.
Rooms are nice, standard.
Quite
Service is good
Excellent beds
Nice service
I recommend if you do not want to stay down town
The breakfast is perfect
Did not try the restaurant during my stay
25 minutes drive from from the Airport, easy to find. 
The discos on the sea side are close, for a week end it's really a good choice.
Take advantage of the early morning sun on the nearby beach or Marina spend the day exploring Barcelona’s world-class tourist attractions, then relax with fine wine and exquisite food at the hotel’s magnificent Indigo Restaurant & Terrace, Pistaccio Lobby Bar or Brisa Pool Bar",4,2014,02,28
36,Unacceptable internet fees,"I have been there during the GSM Congress. The lobby is very nice, the rooms are very confortable but What a surprise when you know that you have to pay 25$ a day to have internet service. In 2014, paying for internet services in 5* star hôtels does not make sense.",3,2014,02,27
36,"Great Location, Awesome Staff",The location is great.  Two blocks from the beach and right across from Diagonal Del Mar shopping mall.  Also very easy to get to the Metro and go all over the city if you don't want to pay for a cab.  Hotel is really nice and everything worked perfectly.  I think the staff were some of the friendliest most helpful I have encountered and I travel all over the world regularly.,5,2014,02,25
36,Nice Spot in BCN,"Good, clean, predictable American Brand Hotel in a city full of excellent hotel choices.  Safe and predictable...you know what to expect coming from the States...nice park around the hotel for walking outdoors.  Big Mall across the street with all the usual retail suspects for shopping which may be good but better to go into downtown and experience BCN up close; recommend walking through the shopping districts rather than doing what you always do in the USA.",4,2014,02,20
36,Hilton Diagonal Mar,"Really good service! Incredible Views and amazing Staff. Specially Eric from Reception, Alexandra and Blanca from Housekeeping. Toni from the executive Lounge who was really helpful with some questions that we had! I will come back soon.",5,2014,02,19
36,Barcelona visit & Football match,"We travelled to Barcelona to go to the Barcelona vs Rayo V match. We chose the Hilton D Mar hotel for it's location, it was very clean and the staff friendly.  Transport links are good, easy to get around the city.  Shopping sentre over the road is full of decent shops and places to eat, it also has free internet (as does the hotel lobby, need to ask for code).",5,2014,02,18
36,Modern Hotel out of city center,"It is a very good  hotel, very clean and modern. Nice location, near the sea, most of the rooms with nice views, especially upper floors, but a taxi or Metro is needed to move to city center. Metro station is not very far from the Hotel.",5,2014,02,16
36,No free wifi in 2014?,A really good hotel with excellent attentive staff. It is just unacceptable that you have to pay 14 or so euros a day for an ok internet connection even when using the conference facilities. I would select a competitor hotel nearby based on this. A real pity,3,2014,02,14
36,Average business hotel,"The hotel has a very good location for three activities-if you are a participant of the Congress, if you want to spend your time on the beach or if you are going shopping in the huge mall next door.Far from the town center, but has convenient public transport and always full taxi stand side by side sucks that you do not want to call from the reception desk.The hotel itself was modern, when they built it, perhaps for the Olympics in the eighties, but now it is rather strange and awkward, with the exception of the magnificent views of the city and the sea, depending on the view of the room.Rooms not grabbed my taste in its design, but can sleep comfortably. It is not  hardly necessary to have a DVD, stereo and a huge desk when the internet is fully paid and expensive.Plus is free in room safe, ironing accessories, minibar, large enough TV programs, writing and more. Very good working air conditioning.The bathroom is well designed, flexible like performance, but need urgent renovation.Which is the point of having a hot tub with lots of features plus a TV above it, when exactly the jacuzzi panel does not work?
The rest of the hotel is average good, clean in the common rooms, the staff tries. Breakfast and generally the food is impersonal enough worthy of every Hilton in any part of the world, that is tasteless. There is nothing in the proposed Spanish menu which make you shout for joy.",3,2014,02,13
36,Nice for business travelers,While this isn't in the heart of the main tourist areas it is an outstanding hotel for business travelers. While this isn't in the heart of the main tourist areas it is an outstanding hotel for business travelers.

36,"Big name,not helpful staff and bad food","I had spent 2 nights in this hotel in my business trip to Barcelona,first with title like hilton hotel you should expect the best in many things but actually it isn't.
Pricey with far location from down town and camp nu stadium and other touristic places.
Non cooperative reception staff at all with bad english!!!!
No free wi fi in the rooms only in the lobby.
I didn't take lunch in it as i tried it once and stopped it in the middle and getting Macdonald's from outside one in front of the hotel.
Really not recommend it and it was a bad experience except the room is clean and quite that's it.",2,2014,01,31
36,Enjoy the rare experience of paying for internet in your room,"There were no major surprises as Hilton's go. The room was comfortable, the bed great, the breakfast good and the staff courteous. I do suspect that the large glass window in the bath/shower area is actually transparent to the neighborhood. I was on the 16th floor, so it was less of an issue. You get small glimpses of the tough times in Spain e.g. the towels were old and ""flat"". The centre just over the road fed us very well when we were tired and did not feel like another trip to the Ramblas or one of the many great food venues.
The big issue is the daily € 25 charge for internet in the room. Internet is free in the lobby and dining areas, but not in the room, unless you are a gold+ member. I find this ridiculously expensive and surprising in this day and age. Fix the window, towels and the internet and we can do 4/5",3,2014,01,25
36,Over priced with not so friendly staff,"This was my 2nd stay at this hotel. I reviewed my first stay as really not so good. This time too did not see any change. Unfriendly staff, poor amenities and bottles of water too on payment basis. Sad situation especially when one pays a whopping price! Sure will not stay again here.",2,2014,01,25
36,Could be better.....,"With a hotel of this class you would expect excellent service and really value for money but nevertheless thats not the case. Long cueing during check-in, high cost for all kind of complementary services and a unpersonal approach",2,2014,01,23
36,Great hotel!,"This was a lovely hotel to stay with my friends, it was clean compared to the other hotels we stayed in the past. staff there were polite, although we wish the AC’s should have been fixed, as we was told this was going to happen on our stay.",4,2014,01,22
36,"Nice Hotel, Terrible Location","I went to this hotel for a conference.   It has great conference space and for the purposes of a large conference this hotel was great.

There was a large mall directly across the street which was helpful if you needed any amenities, however it was very far from the downtown area.   Central Barcelona was accessible by subway but it was a little daunting at times as the area around the hotel is a bit desolate as was the subway station.   

Fine for conference but not for a personal trip.",3,2014,01,20
36,"Excellent posn, staff, facilities … but why do they clean the windows at night?","We had a 5 night stay in a executive room with lounge access and view of the ocean. Excellent Winter discount rate and a great city to explore in January.

Taxi fron BCN is 38-45 euro each way taking 25-30 minutes. 
The El Maresme / Forum metro stop is 5 mins walk from the hotel through the Diagonal Mar shopping Centre. Linea 4 (yellow) takes 12-20 mins to central area stops (El Raval, Gothic, Exiample) without the need to change. 10 rise tickets are 10,30 euro each from a machine at the entrance that takes euro cash and most cards but not Amex. 

The hotel is close to many corporate headquarters including Sanofi, the Museum Blau (new natural history museum) and the beach. The Diagonal Mar shopping center has about 50 franchise chain restaurants and a couple of reasonable tapas/tipica options as well as many shops. Useful for the road warrior are the Media Markt - everything electronic - clothing shops for men and women and free WiFi. 

The bed is king sized, bathrooms adequate, floors are synthetic wooden. 
There is a large pool, sauna and there wellness facility on the 2nd floor. 
The executive lounge is on the 15th floor and does breakfast with hot scrambled eggs, bacon, cold meat and cheese, fruits, pastries and cereal with a coffee machine. There is an outside balcony area that must be popular in Summer. 
The staff at the front counter were more than helpful in terms of directions, routing advice and restaurant reservations. There are 4 computers in the lobby with free internet access and printer connected for boarding passes and printing maps with directions and online reserved tickets.  

Many pluses and a good base from which to explore Barcelona. 

Minuses: 
Its not in town (+/-) and generally this will be quieter than in Central Barcelona/El Raval - so we thought until we were awoken but mechanical noise in at around 3am on our second last night. Turns out they had decided to clean the windows with a machine at night … it happened again the following night and woke us again. 
Minor note: the computers in the exec lounge require payment for use 35c/min so print boarding passes in the lobby. 

Subtract the night moves on the windows and it approacheth the perfect.",4,2014,01,19
36,Come on Hilton: No free WiFi in the room !,"Nowadays when even the most humble hostel has free internet, you can't not get it at this very expensive hotel, claiming to offer good service. Considering the room prices, it is too much to ask 25 Euro for one day with free WiFi in your room. Likewise, I missed a free bottle of drinking water - especially because the prices in the room mini bar are offensive high.
The room, I had, was large and rather good although I could hear what they were talking about in the neighbor room, since the rooms have a (blocked) connecting door. Not a real luxury feeling and the interior appeared somewhat outdated. 
Cleaning of the room was not as good as expected.",3,2014,01,19
36,"Great Service, nice location","This is my second visit to this hotel and again I was very happy.  This time we were a family of 6 who visited for two days prior to a cruise over Xmas.  As ever, the service from all staff was wonderful, with everyone being very helpful.  We had rooms on the Exec floors with lovely views and the lounge and it's outside balcony was lovely to sit and have a drink late afternoon / early evening.  The hotel bar prices were on a par with any restaurant and the bar staff were lovely.

We ate in the hotel restaurant the first evening and for breakfast and the food was prepared as we wanted and perfectly acceptable - no complaints at all.  Again, the staff were very friendly and accommodating.

The hotel is across the road from a large shopping centre and the metro is nearby to take you across Barcelona.  I've visited Barcelona many times, staying in different areas and hotels, but I like the location of the Diagonal Mar as it mixes quietness with great access to the bustling city.  

Most important was my family loved their visit - from teenager to elderly mother - and the hotel staff contributed to this greatly.

We will return to Barcelona again this year for a short visit and we book this hotel.",5,2014,01,18
36,"Barcelona, Hilton not as expected","We stayed here back in 2008 and were eagerly awaiting the same experience as before.  We were sadly let down by this experience.   Given the chance again, I believe that we will stay at the Hilton down town next time.

We were given an executive level room with views of the Beach and Ocean, the view was amazing.
We had access to the Executive lounge, but it was NOTHING to write about, nothing out, ran out of everything, not enough seating, staff was disinterested.

our room cleaning was not on par with what I expect from Hilton, it seemed they only hit the high points and left everything else.  In the evening in my sock feet on the laminate floors, my socks turned black from the dirt on the bedroom floors.

The bathroom was dirty, stuff in the trash can, and hair in the shower.  The door to our room would not lock using the chain since the door jamb was falling apart, and the chain screws were dangling from the jamb. 

Overall left a bad impression for me.",4,2014,01,15
36,Everything you need!,"We stayed with friends in December 2013.
Check in great, we had plenty of questions and the two gents on reception were happy to help with maps and directions.
Metro is a 5 min walk through the shopping centre, no need to change tubes to get to Las Ramblas, we purchased a two day ticket at EUR13. Taxi into the centre is around EUR15.

Rooms were clean as you would expect from a Hilton, good view of the beach. Breakfast was nice and all you need before spending the day sightseeing.

Bar is slightly expensive at EUR10 per pint but again what you expect from a Hilton!

Pre wifi area a bonus in the lobby with both PC's and Mac's.",5,2014,01,15
36,Can't Complain :),"Ok, was waiting for our vacation for the very first time in BCN, I did pick the hotel through lots of analyzing TripAdvisor reviews since its becoming my main source or info and feedback b4 i pack my bags.

best value to this hotel was the Diagonal Mall right across the street < rooms are great, bathroom are well equipped, view was really nice right at the corner so you can see part of mall, streets as well as small view of the sea.

best was the housekeeping lady as well as concierge, they did a real great job and I give them 10 out of 10 ,

only issue there was when i found out that my mini fridge was out of order so second day i went to the FO and left a comment and I was expecting to be solved by the time I get back but it wasn't so next day I came down again and did the same and again nothing happened so at my 3rd complain finally someone went up and have to try 2 different fridges till one of them finally worked, also as HHonor member I left a note that my free water bottles were's provided in the room but till i checked out after 9 days nothing was provided.

taxis are right around the corner and all you have to do is tell the concierge and he will make sure to get one of the lined up taxis for you (as they mainly lining up outside for the hotel guests) 

Diagonal mall was really great for its super market and various shops as well as some playground for kids (i had my son with me so it was great for him) as well as coffee shops both on open air (best for me as I'm a smoker) as well as inside

all in all was great hotel away from those minor issues but was really great experience specially last day when i almost had my expensive camera left in the taxi who drove me to the airport and luckily that taxi was ordered by the hotel FO so in 15 min I met the taxi at the airport and took my camera and paid for his trip (approx. 40 euros)  but sure worth it as my cam worth more than 1200 $ :)

public transportation were really great specially bus #7 as you can easily walk for 5 min and get to the station cost 2.15 Euros for single ride and you don't need taxi really unless you're loaded with shopping bags out of El Corte Ingles :) like my wife did to me :) 

thanks to the GM of the Hilton Diagonal for such splendid 10 days stay and for sure this hotel will be recommended for all my friends whenever they plan on going and thanks for the lady who helped in making the calls for the taxi company to get my camera delivered to the airport

didn't try the food though as I was keen to try various breakfast at such wounder full many coffees all around Barcelona and it was good choice.",5,2014,01,13
36,Great hotel,"We stayed for a week at Hilton Diagonal Mar. Staff was helpful and the rooms nice clean and well appointed. It is away from the center of city but only $10 taxi trip away so no problem. Did not try to figure out how to muse bus or train as taxi was around the corner and was inexpensive. Breakfast Buffet was outstanding and had even churros with thick hot chocolate sauce. Yum!
There is a great mall next to the hotel with wonderful supermarket and many restaurants and fast food places.
All in all great hotel.",4,2014,01,10
36,"Excellent hotel, excellent location","Went for business. Rooms are prefect. You will be very lucky, if get the room on the high floor - there is a spectacular view. Bathroom was clean and well equipped. Breakfasts were perfect with wide assortment of food. 
But room service beefburger as well as soup were terrible. 
Wifi is not free, what is negative. We had corporate access, so I was ok. ",5,2014,01,10
36,Amazing Place to Stay...,"From where shall I start, 
Front Desk Staff more than amazing specially ''Oscar'' who was VERY Helpful..
Rooms as described in web-site.. Service were great.. Location is perfect specially that there is a big mall cross the street with cafe's and restaurants..
Highly recommend it,, and will stay in it whenever I visit Beautiful Barcelona..",5,2014,01,07
36,A lovely relaxed weekend,We really enjoyed this hotel.  It's far enough out of the centre to be quiet and relaxing but close enough to be able to get everywhere easily with a cab rank right outside.  There is a nice enough beach right in front of the hotel.  The room was lovely (get a room looking out to sea on a high floor) and the food was good.  Staff all seemed friendly and helpful enough.  We just wanted a nice relaxing time and we got it.  Very easy.  Price was about right but I think look out for any deals or cheaper weekends to get excellent value for money....,5,2014,01,05
36,Luxurious Hotel,"Enjoyed our stay. Disappointed that there wasn't free wifi in room. Across from shopping mall with lots of places to eat and supermarket.  Easy access to city. Cross the road and walk through mall onto via diagonal and take bus number 7 into city. Breakfast was amazing. Eggs can be made to order on request. Rooms are spacious and fantastic views from our 11th floor King deluxe room. Robes and slippers are provided on request.  Staff were very attentive, friendly and helpful.",5,2014,01,04
36,Disappointing for the price,"Stayed here for 5 nights, a mix of business and pleasure.   The hotel itself is nice, room size was good and overall very clean.  The hotel is too far out to be able to walk into the city centre, it is opposite a large shopping mall and it's quite easy to walk down to the beach.   For me the hotel didn't live up to it's price and I didn't rate the service, I ordered room service one evening and it turned up late and cold, I complained about this and didn't hear anything back, the meal was charged in full on my bill, plus I ordered breakfast one morning which turned up minus the toast.",2,2013,12,30
36,Lack of attention to details...,"Checked in for a biz conference – hotel is located on the south-east side of city, in high-rise construction location next to water. Good view of water, but that is about it – not much else around it (There is a 3+ story shopping mall immediately across the street – great stores and restaurants!).
The hotel is nice, well maintained, and clean. The employees are extremely friendly and accommodating. Exec flr on 15 is well appointed – breakfasts are adequate and evening tapas / wine are definitely a plus. Also, the view is really great! You can see past Sagrada Familia on a clear day (check out my other review on the Sagrada).
The location is far from city-center – requiring a ~15 Euro cab ride to Las Ramblas and related areas city center. There really isn’t much else around to walk to, but if you take a cab to the downtown and walk all day and take a cab home, it really isn’t too bad.
Some issues I had with the hotel
1)	I must’ve asked for some extra hand/face towels 5 times – never happened.  I even brought this up to the front desk on several occasions to no avail.
2)	The electrical outlet in my bath was not functional. Upon inquiring, I was told that ALL the bathroom electrical outlets do not function IN THE ENTIRE HOTEL. So you have to use the outlet over the desk to shave / dry hair / etc.,. You’d think they’d let you know either with a sign on the outlet, or at the front desk, or on the website – as that might be something you’d want to know if you have 2-3 people sharing a room….
3)	Bathroom sink was plugged – and again I inquired twice to no avail.
Per the advice of the front desk person, I sent an email to the General Manager (E. Aranda) relating my experience with the above issues. I had to wait a week, but he eventually did respond and apologized for the problem and noted that he was told by the front desk that all the issues were resolved (ah, no!….). Nevertheless, he did state he would investigate and let me know.
There is another Hilton (franchised, as this one is Corporate) on the other side of town off the main Avineda Diagonal street which is walking distance to shops, malls, restaurants, etc – may opt to check that place out if Hilton is a requirement (check out my review of that one too!). Otherwise, MANY other medium/upper tier hotels available…",3,2013,12,28
36,Overnight stay before cruise,"It was everything Hilton, no more, no less, which is just fine with me. Clean rooms, friendly staff, great location especially if you are familiar with the underground metro. I used Hilton points for this trip and had no problem.",4,2013,12,25
36,Great Staff Very Friendly,"It was my first trip to Barcelona and we stayed here because it was part of a Air travel Hotel deal from Amsterdam.
The room was modest size on the second floor; I really liked the decor.
Since we wanted to see the ususal first things in Barcelona; Ramplas Street, Gaudi Apartment,Picasso Museum and Cathedral Sagrada Familia, we needed directions.
The Front desk staff gave us the usual hotel maps and some suggestions, which, helped, but it was Arturo the bellman who was most helpfull. He, happily, directed us to the correct tram and recomended the T10 ticket that gave us ten trips on all of the public systems within the city: The ticket a monsteres 10 Euros.

The Breakfast Buffet was about 12 Euros and while very nice didn't equal our experience in Dusselldorf, see that review for discription.

I Loved Barcelona and will return again in warmer weather, perhaps, May.",4,2013,12,20
36,Worst hotel and rude staff I have ever seen,When I entered the hotel Nobody asked ne helped for my luggages I waited at desk about 15 minutes. I was there for my honeymoon but there was no special arrangements for us. When I entered the room it was missing items and the lowest floor. There was no shampoo soap body lotion cattle and slippers. The room was very dirty and the windows were also dirty.  And when I went to the reception desk to tell my complains there was a guy working at night shift. He told me that I could complain directly to the general  manager   He was so rude and not helpful. He was nor smiling and he makes me feel like he did not want to help me. His attitude was terrible !! It was totally disappointment. !!!! They gave to change all staff from front desk to housekeeping   My experience was nearly for nine month ago.,1,2013,12,19
36,"Superior service, excellent views.","Stayed before and after Med. cruise. Nice pool deck well above street level. Staff extremely helpful. Barcelona hop on, hop off bus runs right in front of property. We will return to this hotel in future!",5,2013,12,16
36,Business Trip,"The experience with the hotel was flawless.  No surprises, able to do early check in, and quick check out as I needed.   Very comfortable room, and close to the sea.   Great location and attention.  The view of the city from my room was great.",4,2013,12,16
36,"A great Hilton, within walking distance of the beach","Nice roomy hotel, not as central as the other 'Hilton Barcelona' - make sure you add the 'Diagonal Mar' part when you first come in the taxi otherwise you'll be taken to the other one!
Its a 15-20 walk to the beach - the front rooms have a sea view and even at the back you have a great view of the city if you're high enough up. Floor 15 is the Exec lounge and all rooms above this are exec rooms. There are 23 floors in total.
Some of my Gold Hhonors card holding colleagues were NOT given access to the exec lounge which was a bit unfair I thought, as the breakfast in the exec lounge is very good.
Bar area is excellent and roomy with very good service.
There is a large shopping mall right across the road from the hotel (called the Diagonal Mar of course) with large chain stores and places for food. There is also a taxi rank on the adjacent road so no need to book a hotel from reception, there are always cabs waiting.
Reception staff are very friendly and helpful and happy to recommend places to eat and drink and will print you out a google map for anywhere you want to go.
It was pricey, even for a Hilton (244 Euros/night on a corporate rate) but this is still one of the better Hiltons. Highly recommended.",5,2013,12,14
36,Fantastic Hotel,"Hotel:
Great, brilliant staff and extremely clean. The rooms are good size and I had a great sea view.

Executive Lounge:
Good size and never full (unlike some Hiltons), that said the snacks were poor.

Breakfast:
Excellent.

Location:
Okay for me as I was on business. If I was with friends of family I would have wanted to be more central.",5,2013,12,13
36,"Decent chain hotel, nothing special","My wife and I stayed here for three nights and had a mixed experience. The hotel has standard Hilton rooms, mostly what you need, and is a short walk from the metro. It's also nice to have the shopping center right across, and we got some good deals at the stores there. 

But if you're visiting Barcelona, I would think there are hotels more centrally located that give you a better feel for the city. Once inside, there's nothing about this hotel that tells you you're in Barcelona. The neighborhood is not central to the attractions. 

Also, when we checked in, we were first given a room with a handicap-accessible bathroom, where it was impossible to shower since the shower-head was positioned at the waist level. When I went to the front desk to ask, they were very confused, but eventually were able to move us to another room. It was annoying as we had already unpacked and the information about the specific room type should be easily available to front desk staff. We were also not offered any help with our luggage when we checked in.

Overall, this was an okay stay, but if it wasn't for my Hilton status and points, I'd look to stay somewhere else.",3,2013,12,08
36,Highly recommend Barcelona and this Hilton Hotel,"I booked a long weekend at this Hilton location in hopes of having a few relaxing days with a little sightseeing. I speak very little Spanish so I was a bit concerned being in a country I had not been before with a language I struggle to understand. I chose a Hilton hotel as I'm a Hilton member, they are consistent in their accommodations so I know what to expect. This location did not disappoint. The location was great, a few blocks from the beach, across from a large mall and just outside the city center so as not to be part of the hustle, yet close enough for sightseeing with easy access. The facilities were wonderful, very nice furnishings, clean, well maintained, with beautiful views, and the food at the restaurant was delicious. The complimentary breakfast was more than you could possibly eat. The staff was outstanding. They were very professional, willing to help and considerate of the fact I only spoke English. They easily spoke English with me, making me feel very welcome and comfortable. They made sure I was well taken care of, assisting me with sightseeing options, offering to book for me, securing a cab that would take credit cards... they really made it an enjoyable stay. I found Barcelona to be full of friendly, helpful people. I did not have issues with taxis as another reviewer did. The hotel said the fare from the airport would be around 38 euros and that's what it was. I recommend the Hailo app for securing taxis when there. I highly recommend Barcelona and this Hilton location. I will definitely go back, hopefully for a longer stay next time.",5,2013,12,07
36,Great hotel,"Rooms r great, the bed was just amazing and the bathroom was very nice and clean. U get an iron and a safe in your room among the other common stuff u find in hotel rooms. Service was perfect and i really liked the restaurant. If u ever go to Barcelona and need a hotel this one is worth giving a thought. Only thing i didnt like is u only get free Wi-Fi in the lobby but to have internet in your room u have to pay 19€ for 24h Wi-Fi on your mobile and even more if u want to use a lap top. Also they have a dedicated app for managing with the internet which is very cool but it only works with iPhone..",5,2013,12,07
36,Nice Location Near The Beach,"Good beds, clean, great views of the Mediterranean & the beautiful city too!

We experience a weird front desk greeting as the woman showed us a map of the city and then told us not to eat in the city center or Placa de Cataluyna (because it is touristy and very expensive) but to eat at -the best restaurants- which were in hotels and on the strip along the beach.  Mind you it is end of November now and this ""beach"" area is deserted. We hate when the staff of a hotel act as if the guests have never traveled before, eaten in restaurants or ventured to a city they no nothing about.

The hotel was practically empty and we were still not given an upgrade despite our Hilton Honors status.  Why not show off your best, when it's sitting empty anyway and hope that the guest comes back for that great room again?

The mini bar was a source of contention.  First, it was clearly not stocked from the last guest.  There were only two cans of chips, 3 bottles of water and missing candy bars.  Despite our letter stating that we could enjoy two bottles of water on our stay, we were still charged for them, among other items we didn't consume.

50 euro for Internet in the room is outrageous.  Again, when are these hotels going to stop this ridiculous charge?  Internet is everywhere.

Front desk did offer us an upgrade to the executive floor for 75/night additional!  HUH?  No thank you.

The food was passable if you are lazy and don't want to take the Metro to a decent restaurant.

Taxi to hotel is fine, just ask the price before leaving and the driver will tell you.  It's about 35 euro - that includes supplements for bags, airport, number of people.",3,2013,12,02
36,Optimal choice,"We liked this hotel. Rooms are clean and large, simple interior , no-frills. Breakfasts are excellent: choice of dishes is like in Turkey and even more! the hotel is quite far from the center but close to the beach. and... at the poolside terraces there were strange smells.",5,2013,11,26
36,Barcelona good and bad,"As this hotel was included in a cruise package it is difficult to talk about value for money but it is a first class hotel with great services. The staff are helpful, and the whole place is clean. The hotel is not in the centre of the city so be careful with the taxis, as we came from the airport and the meter said 27 euros but when I started to pay him he presented me with a receipt for 47 euros as he said all taxis applied a 20 euro surcharge from the airport. Be warned these drivers need masks as they are bandits. When I consulted the hotel about this they told me that this was normal practice. There is a great bus service from the airport to the centre of the city costing approx. 6 euros including luggage, be warned!",5,2013,11,20
36,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona,This hotel is located close to the beach and easy access to the metro and buses into the city. Shopping centre and restaurants very close by. Rooms are very comfortable and the staff very friendly and helpful. Would certainly recommend it.,4,2013,11,20
36,Hilton quality and service,"What's always comforting is that most Hilton's have exactly the same level of comfort, style and service. You know what to expect. I recently became a Gold Hhonnors member which means free upgrade and access to executive lounge. A nice perk! 
I couldn't really find the added value in the executive room either in size or comfort but the executive lounge on the 15th floor is great. 
Compared to a standard room in the hotel Arts there's no competition but it's a perfect 4 star experience!",4,2013,11,16
36,Gorgeous Property with Amazing Front Desk,"My husband and I spent a long weekend in Barcelona and stayed at the Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona.  The room was gorgeous with stunning views (even whilst lying in bed) and a large bathroom.  But, the people who work at the front desk are the aspect of this hotel that makes it a 5 star property.  For example, upon check-in, we gave our passports to the front desk person as the usual procedure.  To our surprise when we returned to our room after touring one day, there was a complimentary bottle of champagne and birthday cake, because the attentive front desk person had noted that it was my husband's birthday.  Additionally, the hotel has free WiFi in the lobby, but I needed much assistance with the logging on process.  Again the people at the front desk were amazing and helpful. But, more importantly, the front desk assisted us in booking tours and shows and were always delightful and helpful.  This was truly a lovely experience and I would highly recommend this hotel for a long weekend.",5,2013,11,15
36,Is it a 'proper' Hilton.,"A high rise modern building convenient for sight seeing but the room, especially the bathroom, was not as clean as expected, safe in room didn't work.The food was poor, first evening I ordered a steak but a third of it was uneatable fat and grizzle when I complained told that's how Spaniards like it, breakfast was adequate but disorganized.",3,2013,11,14
36,Great hotel away from the crowds,"We stayed here for a long weekend in November, deliberately choosing the location away from the centre for our 4th visit to Barcelona, so that we could do some shopping in Diagonal Mar and not be too far from Razzmatazz where we were going to see one of our favourite bands playing on the Sunday night. A really nice hotel, the room we were in had a lovely sea view and access to the executive lounge. Good selection at breakfast, plenty of choice except if you like a big cooked breakfast, which we don't, so lots of healthy choices which we were happy with. You do get scrambled eggs and bacon and toast if you want hot food. Use of the lounge throughout the day is really convenient, particularly with refreshments and snacks. Plenty of choice of places to eat at Diagonal Mar across the road, but one night we decided to stay in the hotel and eat at the Indigo restaurant, what lovely food! Not cheap but a nice treat. Fantastic staff in the restaurant and also the lounge, particularly Maria, who did a fantastic job of checking us out on the Monday morning (you have a separate check in/out with the executive lounge).  Only slight criticism: the front desk staff were less friendly than others we had experienced within the hotel, the night we went to Razzmatazz we asked if could get a taxi and were told to walk along to the taxi rank (I'm currently 8 months pregnant), ordinarily I wouldn't have been too bothered about this had I not seen hotel staff call taxis round to the front of the hotel for people attending the Gartner conference. Aside from that, a nice hotel and another great trip to Barcelona. ",5,2013,11,13
36,Barcelona trip,The hotel is 15 minutes by taxi to the center of town.  We had a very nice room on the 21st floor and given the use of a lounge on the 15th floor.  Each evening we enjoyed free wine and hot & cold snacks and every morning breakfast since my husband is a Hilton member.  Directly across the street is a very large mall called Diagonal Mar with many restaurants and shops.  One block away from the hotel there are a few Hop& Hop off buses that will take you to town.  If we have the opportunity to go back to Barcelona we would stay there again.,4,2013,11,11
36,Hotel for a bit of relaxation,Good location for folks who wants to be located a further away from the main city. Near the beach and very convenient for shopping. Hop on and off bus very near the area. Walking distance from train/tram. Less people compared to other hotel locations.,4,2013,11,06
36,The perfect end to a cruise,"Just finishing a cruise,  this was a wonderful ending.   We had not realized that you get chucked off the cruise ships so early in the morning.   We arrived at the Hilton at approximately 930 am,  fully expecting to have to wait around for our room.   Within an hour,   our room was ready and we were able to check in, well ahead of the normal check in time.   We were well taken care of,  arriving to a beach/ocean view room with beautiful amenities.  Also a big plus,  with a phone call,  you can have your window opened,  this is important for us.   The room,  service and concierge service fantastic.  A young woman,   at the concierge desk went way beyond in booking a local tour for us,  I'm sorry I don't remember her name, she was patient beyond belief.
The only negative for us,  and not the fault of the hotel, it was further from the city center than we would have liked.   It is a terrific location for conferences,  etc.  But there is a close by metro stop, and the bus tours pick up close by too.   We had more experience on the subway than we would have liked,  although it is efficient and clean.   Overall,  great experience.",5,2013,11,05
36,"Upscale hotel, amazing location","This hotel was breathtaking for those who love modern decor and facilities.  Great place to stay when preparing to embark on a cruise - only a 30 Euro cab ride to the port.  The staff was professional and helpful and the rooms were spotless and beautiful.  The location was excellent - easy walking distance to many restaurants, great shopping and the Hop on Hop Off stops.  I highly recommend a city tour.  The executive lounge did get over-crowded and needed constant restocking but it was comfortable - and the drinks in the bar are very expensive, with the mix priced separately from the alcohol unless you choose one of their signature cocktails.",5,2013,11,05
36,Fantastic!,"Excellent hotel,  good location, very large shopping mall oppsite the hotel, easy to travel into central Barcelona via the underground (2 blocks from hotel). The staff are excellent and the rooms are lovely.  Everyone is very friendly, professional, courteous and goes out of their way to help. Seaview rooms are a plus.  Executive lounge excellent with beautiful sea and city views.  Highly recommend!",5,2013,11,05
36,Such friendly service,"Just returned from a fantastic six night stay at the Barcelona  Hilton, Diagonal Mar. When I arrived the Hotel was overrun with computer professionals attending a conference so was unable to get my requested  upgrade to the Executive floor where I had stayed before.. Nevertheless my sea-view room was large  and airy. As usual I was travelling solo, but the two barmaids in the Pistachio Bar, Daniella and Joanna, were so pleasant and helpful it made all the difference to enjoying my stay.   A special mention also to David, Maitre d'hotel in the restaurant, who went out of his way in his recommendations and advice regarding wines and food. Food was good although a limited menu. The braised veal cheeks were absolutely incredible and can't wait to try them again when I return for Christmas. My only complaint is the exorbitant twenty five Euros a day for the internet. Okay, it's free in the ""Public"" areas if you don't mind the total lack of privacy.",5,2013,11,03
36,Convenient/better than most,"I only stayed one night. wish i has stayed here the rest of my trip. right on the water (no beach access) A great mall across the street that has everything, I mean everything, including a movie theater (spanish) Easy access to cabs, buses. If you are staying in the marina, bay area this is a great choice. T.V was very good, room clean, the help very friendly
$40.oo Euros to airport...",5,2013,11,02
36,executive lounge,"By taxi it was 40 Euros from the airport to the hotel. Booked a deluxe executive room on the 15 floor which had a bath and a separate shower, however our room was right next to the cleaners cupboard and we heard her going in and out with her trolley which made a bit of a racket. We thought this might disturb our sleep in the mornings as I know they start early, so we upgraded to a junior corner suite. Told there was a club junior suite at 80 Euros extra per night or standard suites at 60 Euros per night. We took the 60 Euro one on the 7 floor, although was also shown one I believe was on the 5th floor. So if you want the view, pick one that’s on the highest level. Unfortunately it only had a bath with shower hose above and a curtain, which I thought was a bit odd especially when it was an upgrade from one room to a junior suit that costs a lot more. Well I suppose you  pay for the separated room to relax in with settee, chairs, etc.
However the shower was powerful and was okay for us, each room had a large plasma television. The hotel itself is lovely, situated within a quiet area with a fantastic shopping mall directly opposite the hotel. The mall of 3 floors is the largest in Barcelona with loads of cafes, ice cream stalls, juice bars, restaurants, a very large supermarket and shops. With regard to the executive lounge, I feel it may be a little small if the hotel was fully booked in the high season, although has a good size outside balcony with table and chairs which is nice to relax and enjoy the view. The only disappointment is that the executive lounge closes at 11.00am till 12.00pm for cleaning and can you believe it, closes at 8.00pm till the next morning when its open for breakfast.  The only hot breakfast food served for the whole four days we were there was scrambled eggs, the rest being cold, slices of cheese, a meat slice and bread etc. Of course the usual tea, coffee, plus cold drinks are available along with popcorn and some other sweets for the kids. There is no afternoon tea or sandwiches, nothing  substantial at all. If you wish breakfast in the room its 25 Euros each plus 6 Euros room charge, whereas in other Hiltons when breakfast is included in your booking its only a room charge to pay.  So for us, unless you are a heavy drinker or an alcoholic the extra you pay for the executive lounge is clearly a complete waist of money . 
Okay the lounge  for  a few drinks is fine, little snack bits, however I really would of rather saved the money for  upgrading our room, i.e.; say a junior suit without paying executive rates and pop over the road and eat in the mall, where you can also buy wine snacks etc, for the room.
Barcelona is very busy and an exciting place with many things to visit, along the seafront there is miles of a wide flat pathway that takes you right along to the marina, so hire a bike from outside the hotel. We found the hotel staff very friendly and always helpful.Just one more thing to say, on Sundays many places are closed.",4,2013,10,31
36,"Great Barca hotel, but a little far out from the centre","I stayed at the Hilton Diagonal Mar in Oct 2013 as a birthday visit with friends and family.

The hotel is situated at the far end of the main road through the city (The Diagonal) and while it is possible to walk in to town, allow 30-40 minutes for what is a level walk. Taxi fares in to the city centre were typically €10, with fares to the airport costing circa €48.

The hotel is near the beach, with great views of the ocean and city, particularly at night. To make the most of the vistas ask for a room on the higher floors. The staff are very friendly, with prices in the bar in line with most european cities (around 30% more expensive than London). 

There are sightseeing bus stops near the hotel, which provide reasonable value transport around the city. The Greyline tour was the one that we opted for as this consisted of two circular routes that covered the whole city. Be aware that some providers have three routes, requiring you to change buses more often if you want to see all the points of interest.

If you decide to visit the cathedral then book tickets on line as queues start early in the day and are lengthy. If you want to visit the footbal stadium then check there is no game on that day/evening as this will prevent you from accessing the ground (although you can still get in to the shops).

In summary, a great, reasonably priced hotel a little further out from the city centre than I would have preferred.",4,2013,10,30
36,Good choice for Barcelona,"We recently spent 5 nights at this hotel and were very satisfied on almost all levels.  It was very well equipped and clean.  We appreciated the free wi-fi available in the lobby.  The location is outside of central Barcelona and that was a plus for us.  We enjoyed getting away from the city and appreciated relaxing at the pool side as well as the convenient shopping mall across the street.  If you want the convenience of being in the city, then this would not be appropriate.

The only disappointment was the lack of a concierge service.  The personnel at the reception desk served that purpose, but were not always as helpful or informed as we would have liked.",4,2013,10,29
36,"Lovely place, but not in the centre","It is a big Hilton, but modern and very comfortable. The sea view was lovely every morning.

Despite the fact that the hotel was fully booked, it was quiet and I slept so comfortably, it was a delight. The lobby is spacious with a nice bar to meet with colleagues. 

If you get a good deal, it may be a good idea to stay there for your holidays, but it is more a business hotel. The area is 15-20min away from the centre of Barcelona.",5,2013,10,29
36,Hilton near beach in Barcelona,"Stayed 2 nights with wife after returning from cruise. Happy to see the Hilton brand didn't disappoint. This is newer hotel located a block from the beach, with great ocean views. there is also a shopping mall across the street, and a subway station within walking distance. Very quiet neighborhood, great restaurants and shopping. Everything you would expect from Hilton, fitness center, executive lounge, the staff and service were excellent. would stay again and recommend to anyone. the beds were comfortable for a good night sleep.",5,2013,10,28
36,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona,"The hotel is modern and in a good location for the main conference centre, although caution should be exercised in the late evening as there is a problem of 'mugging' as the area is known for business tourists. To my knowledge, no one was mugged during my stay.

Due to my Honors loyalty membership, I was upgraded to a sea view room. The room was spacious and clean. However, the tea/coffee amenities were not refreshed on the second day and I had to call for housekeeping on the final day. Room service was a nightmare taking 20 minutes to get connected!

The Executive lounge was very poor, closing at 8pm and only offering very limited nibbles and a choice of beer, wine or cava. Spirits were chargeable. During the day it was basically tea, coffee and soft drinks with crisps.

On this experience with the poor level of overall service, not a hotel I would be willing to recommend from this usually reliable brand!",2,2013,10,27
36,Excellent but!!!!!!!,"Ok here we have it all superb but as gold VIP member what have they done to the club lounge!!!! Changed hours. Removed spirits on drinks hours. Closed at 20.00. Not open to 2200 as in the past 
Crying shame. As was perfect before 
This is my 6 time here.  I understand it's a new directorate from hilton with new brand standard since 01 July.   Well hilton Europe get a grip. This is a prime example of why tamper with a. Product that works 

The excuses of money is just not good enough when average room rates are higher for these rooms on club floors !!!  

Regards from a agitated hilton gold VIP",5,2013,10,27
36,Excellent hilton,I really like this Hilton: it is brand new and very well located. The closeness to the beach makes it so easy to go for a run along the water.  The neighborhood is fun and fast developing with a good choice of restaurants.  The hotel is very modern and has very nice and specious rooms. Really likes the executive lounge too,5,2013,10,26
36,Very nice hotel,"Well communicated, far from crowded downtown, nice food, nice neighborhood, excellent bed and pillows.... Just an important detail missing... Not enough electric plugs in room and not even one close to the bed....

I will return and recommend for sure)",4,2013,10,25
36,Great hotel,"Great hotel a few blocks away from the subway system. Bought a ten trip pass, was easy to get into the heart if downtown. Across from a mall, and near the beach (wasn't beach weather). Great lobby bar. Great breakfast on executive level. We did have trouble our last day, an employee rudely implied we shouldn't be there. One other random problem was front desk referred us to a local chain for dinner, apparently we didn't look high class. But it was a great experience besides those small bumps",4,2013,10,24
36,Very god,"Check in was fast and efficient, front of house staff were all friendly and helpful.

We were upgraded to the 23rd floor with great view of the Mediterranean Sea. The pool was closed for the season which is a bit disappointing especially as this is a business hotel, not really seasonal.

Great bar manager!  ",5,2013,10,24
36,Very Friendly for a big chain,"This was a conference visit, and the Hotel did a superb job of looking after us.
The views from my room, were of the sea. As I was at the 20th floor I could see above the near by tower blocks and so the view was great.
The food at lunch was superb, breakfast was good but not special but there was a lot of variety so perhaps I am being too picky.
It was nice to be able to walk to the sea in 5 minutes and be able to walk along the beach edge. Watch out for the nudist beach! one of our party was quite taken by some of the views. We had to threaten her with a bucket of cold water!
The views on the inland side were of the city but mostly the semi industrial suburbs, not the old town which was some distance away.",4,2013,10,23
36,Beachfront Ripoff-Why can't Hilton get it right?,"Ok, for a female traveller, what's the worst thing you can find in a hotel room?
Yep, the dreaded anchored to the wall, hold the button down with your thumb hairdrier...yeah, that one.  With a cord so short you're not even able to see your entire head in the mirror.
Beds were actually good.  And the air conditioning worked well.  
We were there for a conference.  Meetings started at 9 every morning, break at 11.  Want to guess when they refiled the toilet paper in the ladies rooms?  11:20, of course.  20 minutes after it was needed.
So typical of Hilton!  And SO easy to fix.  But they can't be bothered
      ",2,2013,10,22
36,Superb Hotel,"My first visit to Barcelona was a memorable one not just because of the city, my stay too was a pleasant one. I stayed here for 7 nights. The beach is just walkable, Diagonal Mar shopping mall just opposite and a beautiful view (as I was staying on the 23rd floor which is the top most floor).",5,2013,10,20
36,Same old high standards!,"My second time here and even before i arrived in Spain the excellent front desk had advised me about directions to my conference and sent me some info ahead. When i arrived they also had more..its in the details. I had to get to Fora conference by taxi each day which varied widely between 15 and 23 Euros but at least the taxi rank outside had cabs that took Visa or Mastercard mostly. The cold hotel pool was open from 10am, nice that it was empty bar crazy scots like me who have no fear of the cold. Similarly, the excellent gym empty in the evenings past 7pm - my friends ended up in a crummy hotel and one asked me for the nice hilton conditioner due to a frizzy hair issue, the staff gave me two bottles which was kind. Breakfast was excellent but a bit pricey at 25 Euro, if i had the family with me i would certainly be getting it included in a room rate but its just one of those things and most high end chains charge from 15 to 25. Big room, panoramic view, everthing worked, even the air con which was not loud at night - you need a few more english channels on TV please but minor gripe",5,2013,10,18
36,Barcelona,although out of the main centre of the city the Hotel is located opposite a large shopping centre with a large selection of amenities and facilities with a very selective variety of eateries and a large forefront of activities for children so is very family friendly. Good public transportation to the city and access to hop on hop off city tour buses which have 3 connecting routes that cover the main city and surrounding areas,4,2013,10,17
36,"Lovely rooms, but not centrally located","I traveled to Barcelona and enjoyed two nights at the Hilton. The hotel is not central to the city, but it is near the beach. A Disney cruise came in the same time I did and they made for a very slow check in process. The staff was not very friendly and I was not impressed with the concierge or front desk staff. As a Hilton Honors member I was on the executive floor with access to the lounge, the lounge was well stocked and had a wonderful view. I found it ironic that there is free access to computers in the lobby, but in the executive lounge there was a pay be the minute system. 
The room was very nice with a great view. The cleaning staff were very friendly.",3,2013,10,16
36,Another Great Hilton Hotel,"We have stayed at a few Hilton hotels now and they have all consistently met our expectations. This one is no exception. This hotel is very new in the newer business area of Barcelona. It is close to the beach and to the park. There is also a shopping mall across the road. The bed and bath rooms are very clean, modern, spacious and comfortable. Customer service is also very good. The only major drawback is the location. It is far from the nearest metro line and there were dodgy looking people lurking in that part of the subway at night (they followed us but backed away once we neared the hotel). Fortunately, there is also a tram that takes you to the hotel (same distance) which is a lot safer and we used this instead to get home at night for the remainder of the trip. In summary, highly recommended apart from the location and use the tram when going home late at night.",4,2013,10,16
36,Excellent Experience,"This hotel is conveniently located a couple of blocks from the beach.  It is also across the street from a shopping mall with a wide variety food court.  The hotel was very clean and comfortable.  Great views.  The desk staff were excellent and morning checkout went smoothly with a short line.  As Honors Gold member we also enjoyed access to the executive lounge, which provided a very nice evening experience with views of the sea on one side and sunset on the other.  The only negative is location that it is not in the central area of Barcelona.",5,2013,10,15
36,Loved the room and excellent staff,"We stayed here for one day prior to the 12 day Disney Magic Mediterranean cruise on July 11, 2013 and the day after the cruise ended.  Loved our room, the caring staff and the awesome shopping mall across the street from the hotel.  The front desk manager actually located my daughter's lost luggage (lost by Scandanavian Airlines) and had it delivered to the Disney ship on its sailing date.  IMPRESSIVE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!  We love this hotel and plan to come back soon:).  The tub was awesome, super hot water and relaxing.  Thank you for an excellent stay:)!!!!!!!!",5,2013,10,15
36,Hope it improves......,"I rarely write reviews whilst I'm still in a hotel but this place is getting a little strange.

All OK on check-in.  Staff seemed pleasant and they recognised I'm a Diamond HHonors member which seemed good.  Although that's when it started to appear strange.  I was given a voucher to exchange for water bottles at the bar.   Yes, that's right, instead of the hotel staff taking the effort to put water in my room - I have to head to the bar to collect them.  Is that really necessary ?

Secondly, whilst working, I realise I'm getting hungry so ring down to room service to order food, whereupon I'm answered by a gentleman sounding like he's having a nervous breakdown saying it'll be at least 45 minutes due to ""kitchen problems"".   I think about heading out then realise that I might as well order anyway - no answer.

Leave it 5 mins - still no answer so ring reception and they now say it'll take maximum 30 mins.  Food ordered and 40 mins later....................I'm still waiting.

Also, room freezing cold despite heating set to 30 degrees C

I spend a great deal of time in Hilton hotels and I'm not a fussy customer but I really hope this place improves !",3,2013,10,14
36,Excellent stay,"We have stayed in this hotel several times both on business and leisure trips. We have enjoyed our stay very much. Thanks to our Hilton HHonors Gold VIP level we had a chance to use the privilege of the Executive services.
I would like to highlight and appreciate the outstanding service of Ms Yolanda Llorca (PA to General Manager). Her professionalism, helpfulness and the excellent attention to details are exemplary to all the staff members of Hilton.Thank you.
We look forward to visiting this great property again in November.",5,2013,10,14
36,I wouldn't stay here,"Had multiple issues: access card, internet, not so clean towels and floors, no slippers or robe. There are never enough representatives behind the desk so you have to wait in a very long line to talk to someone or get something resolved.",2,2013,10,14
36,Great Hotel!,Enjoyed this hotel before our cruise.  Our room was clean and spacious and the breakfast was excellent.   The check-in process was fast and the fellow at the desk was very cordial.  Would stay here again for sure.,5,2013,10,12
36,Great location,"I stayed here with a friend for two nights in July. Great location, right on the sea front and near to the metro. The room was spacious and clean, only problem was that the shower didn't drain properly and everytime we used it the bathroom became flooded, we did mention this to reception. 
I don't understand why hotels don't provide free wifi service in the rooms, wifi only available in the lobby. Breakfast wasn't included in our booking, so I can't comment on it however, we did use the pool restaurant/ bar and the service was very attentitive - very good pina coladas!",3,2013,10,11
36,Amazing stay at Hilton Diagonal Mar,"I was traveling with my roommate and her parents this summer and we stayed at the Hilton Diagonal Mar, Barcelona. My roommate's parents are Hilton Diamond and because of this me and my roommate's room was upgraded, and given executive lounge privileges! We were just a couple floors down from the top floor, and had incredible views of the city. The bathroom was great, and the beds were very comfortable. The staff was helpful and knowledgeable about the best ways to navigate the city. I would DEFINITELY stay here again!",5,2013,10,09
36,Nice hotel and decent location.,"Check in was not a breeze, front desk said no rooms to upgrade (Gold status) but only after persistant asking for the manager then finally given an upgrade. Another weird thing was the front desk lady demanded for my kid's passport and told me that it's hotel policy to ensure I didn't ""kidnap a kid"" and stay at the hotel! Huh? She also said it's Spanish government law! NO other hotel that I've stayed in (globally) had ever asked me for my kid's passport. Weird!
Anyway, we got a corner room with view of sea and city so it was really nice, very clean and extra bed was setup immediately. Conceirge was wonderful with luggage and parking our car. 
Location of the hotel is not bad, next to the beach and mall, close walking distance to the train and short drive into the city center. Parking in the hotel was pricey but at least the guy at the front desk was smart and gave me the weekly price which ended up cheaper than daily rate for the 5 days we stayed. 
The exceutive lounge location was not bad but facility and food wise have much to be improved. During one of the breakfast, molded fruits were served and I alerted the hotel management with a picture via email. It was immediately addressed by the F/B manager so that was great customer service. Cocktail hour and breakfast food were subpar for a high catergory hotel. I hope that will be improved. One more suggestion: put a door in the lounge that can easily be pushed opened as people were going in/out with food, trying to balance everything on one hand while using the other to open the door!
The simming pool was small but it was not bad. They also have a kiddie pool so that was a plus as many hotels don't have a kiddie pool. 
Overall we were happy with the stay.",4,2013,10,09
36,More than Satisfied,"We stayed here for one night on our way back from Seville.  We actually started our trip in Barcelona, but stayed elsewhere in town.  I was well informed prior to my stay that the hotel is removed from the city, but accessible by metro, cab.  This actually met our needs as we were flying home the next day. We took a cab from the Saints station.  Fare was approximately 35 Euros.  The beach is very close as well as a mall directly across the street.  Note -  Everything is closed on Sundays. There are a few restaurants open.

Check In:
Check In was very quick and efficient.  No long queues.  The associate was very friendly and reviewed all my Diamond VIP benefits.  We had a King Sea view room booked, and informed that we were up-graded to the executive floor.  If you’re staying on the executive level floors, you do need to use the key in the elevators.  Lobby was bright and airy, several seating areas and a bar/restaurant.

Room:
King Executive Sea view, large windows with the best view of the sea. King Size bed, sitting area with small table and lounger, desk, drawer/shelving with flat screen T.V, 2 bottles of water (complimentary), tea/coffee with kettle. Bathroom was very large and spacious, ample space on vanity, bath/shower combo, toilet and bidet.  A large closet with ample hangers, bathrobes and slippers.  The hotel was kind enough to acknowledge a special occasion with a lovely bottle of Cava chilled on ice and desert waiting for us when we arrived.    We had to call the front desk to complain about the volume of the TV in the room next to us. They immediately took care of the problem without hesitation.  Our neighbor had left the volume up high, and was out for the evening.  The room completely exceeded our expectations.

Executive Lounge:
Prior to arriving, I was well aware of the recent changes to the Executive lounge offerings. I had read reviews from other members commenting on their displeasure.  The lounge is pretty large, with a great out door warp around patio.  You almost have 180 degree view of the city. Some great photo opportunities.  There is receptionist that you check in with and they will validate you have entry.  We arrived around 2:30pm.  Only soft drinks, tea/coffee, water, popcorn and crackers were available.  The fridge with beer/wine/cava was locked up until 5pm.  It wasn’t a problem for us, as we just wanted a quick cup of coffee. We returned for the evening happy hour (complimentary beer/wine/cava). I can’t recall if it was 5 or 5:30pm, but it’s only for 2 hours.  In addition, there was one hot snack, and some small sandwiches.   This is a big change from the executive lounges prior offerings, but honestly, it really met our needs.  We’re not looking to eat our dinner there.  Just to have a few glasses of a spirits  and nibbles in a nice atmosphere.  We had to leave rather early the next morning to leave for the airport.  We chose to have breakfast in the lounge.  It was more than sufficient. The typical Euro style with meats, cheese, bread and some hot items. I believe Diamonds may also elect to eat in the restaurant.

Restaurant:
We decided to have a little dinner.  Service was excellent, a good variety of food on the menu.  Kudos to David.

Check out was a breeze.  Taxis are readily available.  The bellman was very nice and quickly assisted me with my luggage despite me saying it was ok.
This hotel was perfect for us for one night.  I’m not sure I would stay here for my entire time in Barcelona.  For us, we like to me closer to the main sights and restaurants. Everyone is different.  I would have no problem returning her or recommending it to anyone.
A solid choice.",4,2013,10,09
36,All is not what it seems..,"This is indeed a Hilton Hotel, the staff you meet are gracious, helpful and thoughtful.. However the hotel might seem like a bargin, until you factor in the costs of things like 25Euro breakfast, an exorbitant daily Wifi fee, with no sniff of any free wifi in the hotel, the ""Internet"" offering is two terminals in the foyer, with a locked down kiosk offering only IE. Sure i can pop across the road to the mall for free Wifi, but isn't this supposed to be a Hilton? A Service orientated luxury brand name? Very strange as they seem to be promoting it for business users.. Then there is the executive lounge, opens at 7am, servers a continental breakfast, not to be sniffed at if you consider the alternative cost i mentioned earlier.. There is a 6 to 8pm happy hour where some light snacks are server, and you may help yourself to beer.. Once your nice and comfortable, having a chat, it's everyone out at 8pm.. Oh, and did i mention that there is no Wifi in this lounge and the 2 terminals will require your credit card number to use them..

The rooms are clean, the TV supplies the obligatory US TV channels for a Hilton (CNN World, Russian News, CNBC and Bloomberg) the bed is comfortable, and if your happy using shopping mall wifi, and maybe getting breakfast at the mall across the road, then sure, its close to the Metro (10 minute walk) and quiet.. but there isn't much else in the area if you're looking to eat out, as the mall has obviously killed all other local trade..

There are better mid range, executive deals in Barcelona, take them",3,2013,10,09
36,Rewiew Hilton Diagonal Mar,"Great location, staff very friendly, go beyond to help even when you don't ask them to. Breakfast and Diner were great. The check in was efficient,  clear, and the staff elaborated on our benefits. On top of that the room was just great. Every single member working in breakfast was happy, had a smile on their face, and nothing was too much to ask.   The dinner on Saturday was just another great experience.   I particularly want to mention David, who did everything to put us at ease and even gave recommendations for things to do without us even asking.  I feel like I really need to share this and I  want to compliment you again on your amazing job and I will certainly return.",5,2013,10,08
36,"Good hotel, although expensive extras.","Stayed here for one night before a cruise and i had a great nights sleep.
Opposite a large shopping centre with plenty of restaurants/shops and a supermarket.
Room was spacious, not the most modern but still very nice.
King bed which was comfy, bathroom was nice with lots of towels/shampoos etc
There was a lovely terrace bar and swimming pool and lots of room to relax, although i will say 9 euros was steep for a beer! So i only had the one! 
Also its a bit further away from the attractions, however there is a tube 5 minutes walk away.
All in all, a good hotel and with a chain like Hilton you always know what u are gonna get.",4,2013,10,04
36,Great hotel in Barcelona for business,"I stayed here while on company business. It's been a few years since I've been here and they seem to have developed the whole area. This hotel is ideally placed for the congress I attended. The hotel staff were polite and helpful throughout my stay. I had a nice big room with a fairly good view partly looking out to sea. 

Nearby is the Diagonal shopping mall which I really liked. It has great shops and places to eat. About a 10 minute walk is the metro which can get you into central Barcelona in about 15 minutes. ",4,2013,10,03
36,"Hilton hotel, Diagonal Mar, Barcelona","This Hilton hotel was a bit of a disappointment. Its situated in a newer part of the city with large buildings and opposite a shopping centre so the views aren't great. The biggest disappointment though was the roof top bar & pool. It closed around 6pm so although it was still hot we couldn't relax in the pool. At the roof top bar I also ordered a Spritz which normally is a fairly refreshing drink. However it was delivered in a plastic tumbler with a straw, so not impressed. The rooms were ok though & service fine.",3,2013,09,30
36,Good location close to Mediterranean,"Situated across the street from a large shopping centre, this Hilton offers lots of space in public areas. Nice pool with children's pool and poolside bar/restaurant. Rooms are normal Hilton standard. The city centre is a 10 minute taxi ride away and the airport is about 20 minutes away via the Ronda Littoral. in my view the location close to the sea more than compensates for the drive to the city. The shopping centre has a cinema and lots of cheap dining options.",4,2013,09,28
36,Hip hotel intersting architecture - a little out of the way,"Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona is located  close to the sea front, at the end of Av Diagonal. It might be a little difficult to get to the sea front, whereas the hotel pool is clean and salt rather than choline.   I stayed at the 17th floor and the view over the city and  over the sea was very interesting. It is not really in walking distance from main Barcelona attractions but the  metro  is just across the street. Breakfast was international fare and totally adequate. Free wi fi available in the reception area.",4,2013,09,28
36,Excellence in Barcelona,"Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona is located at sea front, at the end of Av Diagonal that crosses Barcelona from one side to the other. This is a trully 5* (american standards) where everything works, and service, facilities are according with this. I've stayed at the 23rd floor and the view over the city, or over the sea is amazing. Breakfast, pool, convention center are excellent. Not being walking distance from main Barcelona attractions, metro is just one block away and 15min till Passeig de Gracia - center), and if you like to walk, you can do it by the shore (5km till Barceloneta)",5,2013,09,27
36,Poor service,"Nice location near the beach but way out of town. Hotel facilities frugal, service poor at multiple levels. Capped off by cold ""cooked"" breakfast this morning! You would be better off staying in a boutique hotel in the Barcelona city centre closer to the sights!",2,2013,09,27
36,Do not choose an room upgrade,"Overall a very nice hotel, but me and my family choose to upgrade to a suite to have a bigger room. But what we were not informed about when choosing this was that we exclude ourselves from having access to the breakfast buffet (or had to pay 25 euro per person). Instead we had access to an Executive lounge with a very very poor breakfast selection.",4,2013,09,25
36,3 dressed up as a 9,"We had a lovely 4 day get away planned for Barcelona.  We chose the Hilton based on location and reviews.  What we found was slightly different.  On check in we were given a sub standard room.  We had payed for an upgrade but did not receive it.  The room was barely large enough to ""swing a cat.""  The maid service on the second day was absent and when I rang to ask for it to be done I was told they were busy.  We went out for the evening and upon our return found a pile of clean towels dumped on a pile of dirty towels in the bathroom.  Nothing else had been touched.  The next day we visited the ""business lounge"" which was part of the upgrade, with supposed free wi-fi and refreshments.  The wi-fi did not work and the refreshments were locked up until 6pm.  They were of little use at 3pm and 35°C.  
The worst is that we brought these deficiencies to the attention of management who did nothing.  I sent a second email and never heard anything from them.  This is the 4th time the great Hilton Empire has left us dissattisfied.  It won't happen again.",2,2013,09,25
36,Very nice hotel with a few minor frustrations,"I stayed here for a week during a conference at the CCIB nearby. For that reason this hotel is perfect as it's a few minutes walking distance and across the road from the mall. My room was nicely furnished but style had taken over practicality as there was hardly any storage space. 

The pool area was nice but let down by a pool that is ridiculously narrow. Why design a pool in this way?! Daft use of space. 

We held a meeting which was well supported and catered. Breakfast was nice each day too but lack of omelette/waffle station a shame.  

I was shocked by the €25 wifi cost! This is the most I have ever seen in a hotel anywhere in the world, and I travel a lot with work. It is quite frankly, disgusting. The price for drinks in the hotel was outrageous too. €9 for a medium beer in a plastic glass at the pool bar. Again, this just serves to make you feel ripped off and taken advantage of by the hotel. 

Saying all that, it was a mainly positive experience. So if you are at a conference at the CCIB then this is a fine option. I'd have given it 3.5 stars out of 5 if I could have done so.

Dan",4,2013,09,24
36,"Good facade, good location, bad service","The facilities are good, but the customer service is poor.  They don't go out of their way to make your experience better and want to return.  Food is expensive food and very simple (no taste), Wi-Fi is very expensive, too.  Careful when booking. ensure you have breakfast included and if possible WiFi.",3,2013,09,23
36,Great Hotel and Better Service,The hotel was close to everything I wanted to see and also to my meetings. The hotel was clean and my service was superb. Most of my meals were at the meetings but the meals I had there were good. Atmosphere was very friendly and informative when asking directions.,5,2013,09,22
36,"Good hotel, bad service.","Nice position, nice swimming pool floor, nice rooms, smoking areas, poolside restaurant and bar. Gorgeous.
BUT
45 min to check in (!!!!!!), rude waiters, especially the poolside ones, problems to check out, managers training new guys with huge queues to get still served.......

Nice hotel, unprofessional service.",3,2013,09,21
36,Great little European Getaway,"Stayed here for a little getaway with my family. The location was perfect for everything from shopping, restaurants, downtown and great access to the metro etc. the hotel was great , clean and the staff were wonderful warm and welcoming. The GM Frank was so hospitable - great gentleman !! I would recommend this hotel to anyone !",5,2013,09,20
36,Not worth the money look for better offers,"I have staid in this hotel several times... its standard has dropped.. it is understaffed worn rooms , its surviving on the Hotel brand while damaging the Hilton Brand,,,, executive floor facilities, food, service are poor..... avoid and look for another option.",2,2013,09,15
36,"Out of the way, but very nice place to stay.","We liked this Hilton a lot. Great executive lounge with a very nice balcony. Easy walking distance to the water. A very large mall is across the street, with some nice outdoor cafes. Staff was very courteous and were fluent in English.",5,2013,09,14
36,Barcelona Mini Break,"Hotel was very clean and well maintained making the experience a very good one. Check-In was smooth and easy, food and drink slightly high, however nice restaurants and bar over the road and within walking distance. Barcelona is an amazing city with lots to do and see would recommend 7 days to get around most attractions. Hopper bus paid for itself and is an ideal way to get around.",4,2013,09,13
36,Superb relaxing hotel near the beach,"Within a few blocks of the beach, this is a very good hotel for relaxing.  It is away from the city centre, so it is nice and quiet.   Only downside is that taxis or tourist buses are necessary to get into town or to restaurants.",5,2013,09,13
36,Diamond Review - Excellent Stay at the Barcelona Hilton,"We had an excellent stay at this Hilton; it was close enough to the city to quickly access all the sites and we really enjoyed being able to walk across the street for shopping, restaurants etc.  The Executive lounge was great, just think they need to extend the hours and the offerings each day.  Very impressed with the concierge in the Executive Lounge, very helpful and would suggest getting there early if you need assistance.  Every restaurant they recommended was a home run.

Forget the beach if you stay there....too much drama to get there and back and would not recommend this.",4,2013,09,12
36,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona,"This Hilton was fabulous and directly across from the Diagonal Mar Mall and steps from a great Mediterranean Beach. There is a food court at the Diagonal Mar Mall which features so many different types of food (especially Tapas). So, if you're staying with children, it's a little easier to please all your fellow travelers.",5,2013,09,10
36,Great experience!,"This is a very beautiful hotel with very convienent access to the beach. It is very modern with very good amenities and staff was very helpful and friendly. It's a couple miles to the Gothic area but very near a ""Hop on, hop off"" tour bus stop which we used frequently.",5,2013,09,09
36,"Great staff, nice hotel... but where is Barcelona?","Had a very nice stay at this property! Room was in good shape, and the staff was very, very helpful. But if this is your first visit to Barcelona (or if you prefer to be closer to the action) this place is kinda far from, say, La Rambla....

There is a metro station nearby, so getting to Gothic isn't tooooo bad. Cabs readily available too. Across the street is a large mall with lots of restaurant choices and shopping, but non of it has the charm of the old quarter.

Good breakfast!",4,2013,09,09
36,Beautiful Spanish Modernism,"We stayed at this hotel before and after a recent cruise. This hotel is very beautiful and very modern in style. The beds were extremely comfortable, and you just melted into the pillows. The breakfast buffet had a large selection of foods - everything tasted excellent. The location is also very convenient, being near the sea, as well as the Diagonal Mar shopping center. The only complain I could have is the waiting in the lobby for check-in/check-out, as well as the wifi service. Would like to be able to catch internet in the rooms, however you need to go to the lobby, which was usually very crowded. Would stay here again though the next time we ever go back to Barcelona.",4,2013,09,09
36,Nice Hotel,"We loved this hotel, the pool its grate and it has a very nice executive lounge :), we stayed here for three nights. There is a shopping mall in front of the hotel. The hotel its not very close to the ramblas.",5,2013,09,07
36,Very Bad service,"The hotel location is far from City center but the transportation is available either by Metro or Hip Hop. It’s far from the beach by 15 minutes walking.
The service in the hotel is very bad starting from check in where you have to wait long time your turn (No HHonors desk as the usual rules of Hilton) and few receptionists to serve everybody during high season! The Receptionist was rude and asked me to sign without question. (When I was on the Lobby during Sunday I noticed only one receptionist!).I made my booking before months to get the right room but I was surprise that it’s not available “smoking room"" In a huge hotel they cannot secure one for me!
I request to get power converter and I was surprised that they asked me to get down myself to get it as if we are not in Hilton but in a small Hostel.
Internet service available in the lobby and there is Two Computer to be used by customer that is good  but the problem no rules to used it , can you imagine  one family used both computers for the whole evening and many people are waiting without any action from Hilton team. And they neglect our request for support.
 Worst Cleaning I got in All Hilton was in this hotel, I return back to my room to find just the bed was changed. But the empty shampoo still on the shower, cups weren't cleaned, trash bin as it’s in the morning .After I made several call the operator refused to connect me to HHonors Manager or to the duty manager given many excuses. They send someone to clean my room and provide me with welcome fruit plate (all of this and both HHonors manager and Duty manager not in the hotel!).
The last surprising is no bell captain to take our bags from the room during check out, as they start @8:00 AM , I was obliged to take our bags down , all of this and we were at Hilton the international five stars Hotel!
The Hotel as design and surrounding very good and nice but the service very bad.",3,2013,09,07
36,Expected more from a Hilton,"Stayed for 2 nights before a charter cruise.  Room was O.K. and beds were comfortable, and for Europe, they also had ice, which is a plus.  Central location across from a large mall.  Was very disappointed with the free WiFi in the lobby - extremely slow, probably since hundreds of others were in the lobby doing the same.  For the price of the room at a Hilton in this day and age, they should have free WiFi in each room, rather than charge an exorbitant price for the service.",3,2013,09,07
36,pricey but nice,if i had a do-over would select a cheaper hotel closer to historic area. thank goodness for the handy metro system which was very economical and easy to use.also there was a large shopping mall with restauants right across the street.,5,2013,09,07
36,Great Service and Value,Only stayed for one day. The experience was excellent. The staff was prompt and courteous. The service was also excellent. It is right near the train station and bus stop which makes for easy access to the center of town.,5,2013,09,07
36,Great Buffet in an outstanding hotel,"We stayed at this hotel and for nights before embarking on a cruise. We took advantage of the breakfast buffet which was very well stocked with local food ( the hams and cheeses,,,) as well as a variety of food form all over the world. At night we crossed the street and visited the mall, which we saw from our window, and enjoyed one of the best paellas we have had. The view from the pool is also something to rave about, since you can see the ocean and the people walking towards the shoreline.",5,2013,09,07
36,Brand-name Hotel with average service standards,"Stayed here for several nights. I will agree with other comments that this hotel lacks quality customer service. We came off a cruise and were a few hours early for check-in and were asked to pay $110 to check-in early (for a multi-day stay). After declining they took our bags and asked us to check-in later. No offer of coffee or internet, so we took off for a couple hours wondering if this really was a Hilton. We paid $1000 for 4 nights and the only hilton standard was the breakfast buffet and the Pool/fitness facilities. We were on the 16th floor - carpets were in rough shape, housekeeping was horrible (late cleaning, missed giving us towels, left cleaning rags, did not remove all garbage, did not clean all the glasses, left water in icebuckets...everyday there was something that was missed). The Restaurant and Bar Staff were very good, but 13 euros for an ice-filled mixed drink...ouch. usually lots of Staff in the lobby servicing conference guests, it seemed like we were secondary to the conference crowd. Front desk staff not proactive. Check-out was long as they dealt with complaining customers and getting managers, while holding people in line that had flights to catch. Would have used express check-out, but there was no bill or form placed under our door the night before. I complained about a bar charge on my bill and the front desk agent would not remove the charge. Overall, good beach location, good pool and nice restaurant but significant lack of customer service and housekeeping. Wifi only works in the Lobby, There are better locations in the City, closer to the major attractions for the same price or less. Caters to a business crowd who stay for a night or attend a conference and they give lots of perks to their loyalty customers.",3,2013,09,05
36,4-Star Hotel with a 2-Star Front Desk,"This is an excellent hotel in its price class ONCE YOU GET PAST THE FRONT DESK. Compared to the average of other European hotels in this price range that we have stayed in I'm giving it a ""4"" Tripadvisor rating despite the front desk inadequacies detailed below.

The 4-star part:
The hotel facilities are modern, attractive and comfortable. It is in a good location, 5 minutes from the beach or the Metro and right across the street from a large modern shopping mall. The breakfast buffet that came with our room (not all room rates include it) was the best we have ever had anywhere; Good coffee (regular, latte, espresso, cappuccino), a variety of juices including the best fresh-squeezed orange juice on the planet, fresh fruits, breads, pastries, cheeses, cold cuts, eggs, sausages and more. For meals other than breakfast the Hotel restaurants are pricey but good (not outstanding), but there are many restaurants in the shopping mall across the street or a few minutes ride away on the Metro.

The 2-star part:
The reception area is small, understaffed and inefficiently run. I spent 45 minutes in line to check in. After about 15 minutes, I started timing the process. It averaged about 5 minutes per check-in. There were 3 desk clerks, but they weren't all available. The hotel has no Concierge and the front desk staff has to assume that function as well. While I was in line, one clerk's time was fully occupied for 30 minutes assisting a guest with elaborate travel plans. The lack of a Concierge is a double problem: you may have to wait in line a long time either to check in or to get information on transportation, local attractions, etc.",4,2013,09,04
36,Excellent hotel.,After an overnight flight from the US we arrived around 8:30 in the morning to find that our room was ready for check-in.  What a pleasant surprise.  It is a beautiful hotel with a great view of the Mediterranean.  The service was excellent the entire time we were there.  The concierge level was very nice. Although it is a bit of a distance to the downtown sites there is a hop-on/hop-off tour bus stop right across the street.  The mall across the street is another nice convenience.,5,2013,09,04
36,barcelona vacations.,"Hotel is mostly for business not for family vacations,very busy with all kinds of conventions,not enough staff,no store within hotel.
Breakfast too expensive,but there is not much choice-next door mall opens 10am,too far from city center ( if you do not have a car),
the only good thing is that beach is very close-nice walk,rooms nothing special,junior suite ( 3 people) was overpriced.",3,2013,09,04
36,Good hotel average location poor concierge service,Hotel is quiet a distance from down town Barcelona. Concierge staff are extremely slack and basically offer no service. But from check in to housekeeping to in house restaurants the poor arrival experience is almost ablated!!,4,2013,09,04
36,"A splurge for me, but I got what I paid for.","Enjoy the beautiful pool and the views of the sea.  Walk to the beach in less than ten minutes and take a dip in the Med.  Enjoy the convenience of the tram or Metro that are only two short blocks from this fine hotel and you can easily get to Sagrada Familia,  the Barri Gothic,  or if you have the time, travel all the way to Montserrat without ever leaving the rails.  More to see than I had time for, but I will be back!",5,2013,09,04
36,Great Hotel,"Excellent hotel, great staff, concierge level is outstanding.  Right next door to a large mall with a grocery store. Outstanding views of the Medeterranian sea.  tour busses stop right there as well as regular bus.  within walking distance to metro.  Taxi from airport was not a problem.  took taxi to cruise ship from hotel",5,2013,09,03
36,Too far from main attractions,"I stayed at the Hilton & found the rooms to be overpriced. Guest services tried to upsell me a room for 89 Euro & when i said no thank you, they told me check in is not for 3 hours. Guest services NEVER told me breakfast was included. Mini bar was empty upon arrival. Too far from main attractions. ",4,2013,09,03
36,Perfect,"I visit am hotel in the middle of August. I must say that the hotel is absolutely perfect. Is right next to the beach (in case you need it) and right across the street is a mall with a lot of stores and restaurants. The hotel is located about 15 minutes by car from the center of Barcelona. Near by is a metro station but you can also take the bus. If you are wondering if you should choose the breakfast, just do it! The breakfast was perfect!!
If I ever go again in Barcelona I will definately stay in Hilton hotel.",5,2013,09,03
36,"Great and new hotel, with little oversights.","The hotel is located in the Diagonal del Mar/Forum area, and is a bit far from the airport and the city center as well.
If you reach it with public transports, it's a little hard to find, as it's positioned between the mall (Diagonal del Mar shopping center) and the beach.
You'll find many other hotel around it (Princess, AC by Marriott, Vincci, ..) but it's the nearest to the beach.
If you want to visit the city, it's indeed to far to be the right place to stay where to have a basis, but if you're going to spend your days by the beach, this is a good choice.
The welcome at the ck-in time was great, and Hugo who made the ck-in was fast and polite.
We were given a 18th floor room, with a nice view to the sea.
Like in all the Hiltons, if you're not gold or diamond for HH you cannot have free wifi, but you can use a free one only in the lobby.
The room was big and clean, with tea and coffee facilities and toiletries in the bathroom.
The beds are the best part of the rooms, because they're wonderfully comfortable.
We asked to the reception for some info and they were ready, formal and skilled, and they answered properly to all our needs.
The only negative thing we experienced could be found in the hallway of the 18th floor: we found some empty boxes of cardboard (you can see like hallway surprise in my pics) which gave us an image that was the opposite of that of cleanliness of the hotel.
The following is another little lack: we were not asked at ck-in for a credit card and for this reason we had been asked for it twice in the following days.
There's noting of particularly bad, but without these little oversights this hotel could be surely better.",4,2013,09,02
36,Very helpful staff,"The staff at this hotel are extremely helpful and friendly. The location is a bit out of the way but an easy taxi ride to the old port. We enjoyed the pool and the rooftop bar. They seem to be slightly understaffed, in the bar and at the front desk . There was a line up to check in and only one or two staff at the front desk, coming and going. If they can hire a few more people as good as they have now, they would be in great shape.",4,2013,09,02
36,Very Good Stay with minor issues,"My wife and I visited the Hilton Diagonal with her sister and husband.We  booked through hot-wire and got a cracking deal. Upon check in we opted for the breakfast at a reasonable additional cost.

The size and style of the rooms were very good and both rooms looked new. Free Wifi was available from the reception via a code and there was also a business centre with computer facilities. The staff at the reception were extremely helpful with travel advice and also arranged tickets for a Barcelona football match.

The downside to the stay was the breakfast which was lacking in service and food quality. The buffet was not replenished regularly when food was finished and the variety was also not up to Hilton standard. The were many occasions when the coffee machine broke down and was not repaired immediately. 

Overall a very good hotel which needs to up the breakfast to justify the 5 star tag.",4,2013,08,31
36,Excellent apart from Front Desk,"We stayed at the Diagonal Mar for 2 nights at the beginning of August before joining a cruise from Barcelona.

Arrival at the hotel was swift and we were surprised to have our room ready even though it was not check-in time.  This was really appreciated.  The staff were welcoming and both us and our baggage were in the excellent room in no time and we were free to explore the gorgeous city of Barcelona.  We were on the 17th floor and the views were amazing.

We did ask for some additional items for the room, some of which arrived.  We did get the towels we requested as we had three people in the room and on the second day only received 2 sets initially.  We did ask for an extra glass also which did not materialise.  Hilton should set the room up for the number of occupants so with three people there really should be three glasses and cups.

We were on a bed and breakfast deal and the 1st floor breakfast was well organised with a good choice and the food plentiful. The hotel has a nice pool which we used twice and the only slight annoyance was they began to tidy the area long before pool closing which was 8pm.

The hotel itself is at the north end of Barcelona but a tourist bus stop and metro station are close by so transit to the centre is not really a problem.  It also has the excellent Diagonal Mar shopping centre opposite which if staying as a family as we were offers a wide choice of food to please all palates.  I did not try the hotel restaurant other than for breakfast so cannot comment on this area.

The bar area in the lobby is pleasant enough to watch the world go by while enjoying a drink.

Now the big downer.  Check-out.  There are no queue lines and thus you end up with people cutting in and no control over dealing with customers.  All I needed to do was pay the tourist tax and I was waiting 35 minutes to do this meaning we were later arriving for our cruise than planned.  There was clearly a long queue but no extra staff were placed on the vacant positions to deal with this and left a sour taste after a very pleasant stay.

Would we stay again, yes, we really liked the hotel and the quieter location away from the city centre bustle but I do hope they sort the front desk before we return and explore the city of Barcelona further.",4,2013,08,31
36,Very Good for Holiday,"Was a pleasant experience, friendly staf, spacious and clean rooms, tasty breakfast and all tastes, quiet and close to the beach, I recommend it for a holiday in Barcelona even if it is very close to downtown. Only negative remark is to the bartender should learn to make a better espresso and cappuccino, considering the price compared to bars in the area.",4,2013,08,30
36,Poor standards for a 5 star hotel,"Not enough staff... long delays at check in and check out, bathroom not clean, This Hilton has stopped giving spirits in the executive lounge, staff don't appear happy, food in executive lounge has dropped in recent years....... staid here 4 times before and would not return again after the last visit.",1,2013,08,28
36,Poor start but good recovery,"My family and I have just spent 9 nights at the Hilton. We had booked a family room for 2 adults, 2 children. On checking in we were informed the room we had been allocated was not big enough to hold an additional fold up bed needed for 1 of the boys and we would need to book another room or upgrade to a suite for 100 euros extra per night. 900 additional euros was not in our budget especially on day 1 after an early flight, train and metro ride in the heat! When booking check the Hiltons policy verbally about children being allowed to stay in the room using extra beds/ bedding as is advertised online.

My husband after speaking with the manager agreed to split the cost of the suite and get use for all 4 of us in the executive lounge. The lounge served us breakfast each morning and soft drinks, tea, coffee until 8pm when it closed. We could also visit 6-8pm each evening for tapas and drinks (wine, cava and beer) No alcohol was served in the executive lounge other than between 6pm - 8pm, again check this from hotel to hotel as we did speak with guest who thought this unsuitable for the additional cost.

The room we eventually got was great, our view was of the pool and sea it was clean, 2 tv's, minibar, tea/coffee try and lovely bathroom.

Chris in the executive lounge was very helpful if we needed any local info or tickets.      

The pool was small but clean with bar / food area and lifeguard on duty. Complementary towels, free wifi, chess board and sun beds. The gym was open until late and children could use equipment as long as there was adult supervision.",4,2013,08,27
36,A Good Holiday Hotel but designed more for Business Travel,"We checked in by 10am once off a cruise.  We were greeted with slight coldness and said no room is ready, until she found out we were Platinum Members. Once that was established, we had our 2 rooms immediately. The rooms were very clean and well appointed however a bit heavy feeling.  The pool area is very nice and there are lots of loungers. The pool was a good size and the water was warm. We had a nice lunch at the restaurant on the patio. The location of this hotel is directly across the street from a mall with some nice eating choices. Also, very close to the front of the hotel is the open top bus tours that can get you into the heart of the city pretty quickly.  This hotel is not near downtown Barcelona. We are going back to Barcelona for 3 nights in December/Jan and we may return but not for sure.. There is nothing wrong with this Hotel, but I am not sure if we would go back.  If you have booked here, you will have a good room and good service.",4,2013,08,26
36,Excellent hotel in an excellent position,"This hotel is not located close to La Rambla, but conveniently located close to the beach a little bit further away than Barceloneta (you cross a street and are right right by a public beach). The hotel is located across the street from the shopping centre Diagonal del Mar, one of the largest in Barcelona (we even found Primark in this mall).
During our visit of Barcelona we really wanted to be right in the middle of the city during the day but wanted to be in a calm and relaxing hotel at night. If this is what you are looking for too, then HIlton Diagonal Mar is the perfect choice.
From Passeig de Gracia (which is the centre of Barcelona) it only takes 15 minutes by subway to reach this hotel. You can also choose to reach the hotel by tram or bus. On our way back to the airport we instead went by taxi. From the hotel to terminal 2 we only paid €28.
We stayed in a corner room (#904), with an incredible view. We were two adults and a teenage girl. The extra bed was really comfortable. Bathroom really large with both shower and bathtub overlooking the city.
I can agree with some other people who wrote the check-in process was a little slow but, hey, we were on holiday, we were not in a hurry!!!!
The pool area is really nice. Perhaps we wished we had spent more time by the pool but in Barcelona there is so much to see!
Wifi: wifi is available for free in the lobby (no other places....) and you can use the hotel computers located in the lobby or on the first floor (business centre) for free. Wifi in room costs €25 per day.
You can reach the hotel directly from the airport. First you catch the airport train from T2 to Passeig de Gracia and from there you change to the yellow line to El Maresme (direction La Pau). 
We also had breakfast every morning: it was great and really well looked after even when there were a lot of people.
We stayed at Hilton Diagonal Mar for 5 nights and we will certainly go back on our next visit to Barcelona.",5,2013,08,26
36,Easy access to both the city and the beach!,"I was initially a bit concerned with the hotel's location when I booked it as the hotel was a bit far out to show up on the ""typical"" tourbook map.  My concern was again reminded when the taxi driver had to use GPS to locate this hotel after my late night arrival at Barcelona airport.  But at the end of my trip, I think it is the best location among the 2 Hilton facilities in Barcelona and I am very pleased with the hotel.

* Great executive lounge on the 15th floor of the ocean view hotel (great view of the city too!)  Breakfast offered within was fantastic. So was the afternoon snack.
* Walking distance to the each yet easy access to the city.  Orange subway line took you right into the city without the need to transfer.  This was a bonus to me as I did not want to deal with the noise and traffic in the central Barcelona near Las Ramblas.
* Staff: Very pleasant and friendly.  Though it might be under staffed at the front desk, long queue occasionally.
* Walking to the nearby shopping mall as needed.
* Room is modern and clean.

I would stay here again.",5,2013,08,25
36,Our favority corner of Barcelona,"The Hilton Diagonal Mar is in the great Diagonal Mar area of Barcelona. Easy to get there by tram or metro and of course taxi. Close to the beach. It's a little outside the city and during weekdays it can be busy with conference people, due the vicinity of a big venue next to the hotel. But again it is a more residential area, a huge shopping center across the street and don't forget the nearby butcher for the jambon Iberico. The hotel itself is business service, sometimes great, sometimes more average.",4,2013,08,24
36,A good hotel candidate!,"I booked Barcelona Airport Transfers from El-Prat Airport to Hilton Diagonal Mar ‘return’ for 135 Euro and was very pleased with the service. Both pick up times were prompt and driver was quiet but friendly. Journey took no longer than 25 minutes.

Driving towards the hotel, my family and I were pleased to see the close proximity to the beach and the short distance to the sizeable Diagonal Mar shopping complex directly opposite the hotel. There was also a convenient line of taxis parked on the side of the hotel.

A bellboy emerged and promptly took our bags. It is very clear that any negative remarks I have read on Trip advisor about the service of the concierge and front desk is determined by how busy the hotel is at any one time and Hilton Diagonal Mar can be very busy. We count ourselves lucky and waited behind 3 other guests and were seen to within 15 minutes to check-in. We were allocated 2 rooms on Floor 19 and I must warn you that lifts can take a little longer than usual to come and sometimes frequent stops on different floors.

As we were ‘executive’ guests (having booked 2 executive rooms for our family of four), we were told that breakfast is served in the executive lounge and if we wanted to change it to the main restaurant Indigo, we would have to pay 25 Euro per person extra. My interpretation of an executive lounge was better food, service and comfort.  In reality, it just means more privacy, less crowd. The breakfast is limited with only one choice of egg – runny scrambled. The exceutive lounge however is a nice place to relax in before dinner with wonderful views across Barcelona city and the beach.

Now this is where this hotel stands out above most. When we shared our disappointment with the hotel manager, Rocio she was receptive, professional and understanding.  I do believe that if a guest is reasonable and not expect anything, one might just be fortunate enough to have their problems seen to. 

Our rooms were spacious, clean and comfortable. Bathroom was fully stocked and replenished everyday. The hotel’s pool is a really good size when compared to other city hotels with sun beds aplenty:) . There is a beautician available by the poolside offering massages, manicures and pedicures. Gym equipment is limited but was perfect for a little holiday workout. 

The Pistachios Bar in the lobby is very comfortable and the bartender makes the best mojito! Just saying:)

We took a 15 minute taxi journey to La Sagrada Familia that costs us 15 Euros. On another day, we took a 10 minute taxi journey to the Musical Fountain costing 12 Euros. We also went to Port Vell (Marina, shops and restaurants) instead of Port Olympic (just restaurants) via a 10 minute taxi journey costing 10 Euros. For a family of four, it was a convenient and comfortable (if not lazy) way to travel. Not a big fan of metro although this isn’t far from the hotel either.

To summarise, Hilton Diagonal Mar is in an incredible location offering both a beach and city break. Staff were professional and friendly, contributing to a comfortable and relaxing holiday. But one must be realistic as it is a buzzing hotel with an international clientele and therefore sometimes service might be a little slower, lifts might take a bit longer, at breakfast there may be queues, pool area may be busy BUT with a little patience, Hilton Diagonal Mar can be a good home away from home.",5,2013,08,24
36,Great place to stay in Barcelona,"My wife and I just returned from a fabulous trip to Barcelona.  The Hilton staff were very helpful and we enjoyed our stay there very much.  Great view from the upper floors and the executive lounge.  The hotel is near the beach and close to main travel lines into the city, which made it a great home base for visiting throughout the city.",5,2013,08,24
36,Amazing relaxing stay,"Lovely adjoining rooms with magnificent views across the Mediterranean. Hotel staff were very friendly and could not be more helpful. Enjoyed the city bus tour from just outside the hotel - hotel can provide you with a 2 euro discount voucher.
Ate in great seafood restaurant on plaza opposite - paella and muscles were excellent.",5,2013,08,24
36,Fantastic view in a very comfortable hotel.,"My partner and I spent 2 nights here before joining a cruise.  We had a corner room on the 18th floor which had a fantastic view of the city from both the bedroom and the bathroom.  

The room was large, clean and stylish with a very large we'll equipped bathroom with separate bath and shower.  The bed was very comfortable with good quality bed covers.  

The breakfast buffet was very good with a varied selection of food which was hot and tasty.

The pool area was clean and the staff were friendly, the pool is quite large and there were plenty of sunbeds for the amount of guests.  Free wifi was available by the pool and in the main foyer although it was not as quick as our connection at home.

The hotel is within walking distance to the beach but not for the city centre, we used the hop on hop off bus as our main transport as the bus stop for the green route (summer season only) is close to the hotel.

The only complaint we had was that the view was so good at night from our room that it seemed a waste of time to sleep!",5,2013,08,23
36,Great hotel but HHonors policy needs review,City has a lot to offer the visitor. My wife and I spent 4 day in Barcelona prior to a cruise. The hotel is a bit off the main part of town but the metro and tram systems make getting to and from easy.  My issue with the hotel is I'm a gold honors member and the only perk I received was a really crummy breakfast down in the lobby bar. It was so bad my wife and I had breakfast at the Starbucks across the street.  The hotel does have a restraunt on the 1st flood that offers both full and continental breakfast but  evidentially management doesn't view our gold status sufficient to merit eating up stairs. Hotel management real should eliminate the lobby as a breakfast option. ,2,2013,08,23
36,Lovely hotel near the sea,"I've stayed here on two occasions and have enjoyed each. The hotel is away from the bustle of the city but there is a subway stop nearby that allows you to get to any part of Barcelona rather easily.

I was on the executive floor which allowed a great view of the Med. The Hilton Honors lounge was a nice touch with a free breakfast and evening canapes and wine. 

The young lady at check-in was very friendly but unfortunately, there was a bit of a wait. My room was excellent with Pergo type floors and a great bathroom. Everything was very clean. The staff at the bars and indeed everywhere was excellent.

My only complaint, and this is a big one, is that one day of Internet service is 25 Euros. This is crazy! There are two free computers in the lobby but they were always occupied by teenagers watching movies. 

Other than that, the hotel is very highly recommended and I look forward to a return visit.",5,2013,08,22
36,"1st trip to Barcelona,Hotel was GREAT!!","We really enjoyed our stay,after a 15hour day of traveling from Minnesota/USA.  We were glad to get a great night sleep! the hotel is across the street from a mall and all kinds of dining!  We took a cab dwtn which was only 11euro.  The bathroom was fantastic,the lobby & pool area were also very enjoyable.  We stayed at another hotel near the Arpt. when we departed later on our trip which was More expensive,not near as nice! I highly recommend staying here & would again!",4,2013,08,22
36,Good Hotel,"Arrived on a Thursday night.  Check in was pleasant.  Room was okay, definitely worn and a few areas needed fixing, like the door, i could see the lock mechanism, hardwood floor in entry way was a bit of an eye sore, a few dusty/dirty corners, etc.  The views were wonderful.  See pictures.  The room was spacious and comfortable and room service was alright.  Hallways were not very clean.  The executive lounge was crowded with lots of children, hence a bit chaotic and limited food, so i stayed away.  The pool was fantastic, had a pedicure at the spa.  The food and drinks at the bar we pretty good, the bar staff were excellent!  Stayed 4 nights, Barcelona is a great city!  Check out was a bit upsetting due to wifi charges i was not expecting.  Upon my return home, i was quite impressed with Ms. Fontela (Front Manager) in her efforts to help me resolve these charges.  She was a fantastic customer service professional!  I will stay here when in Barcelona, she is one of many reasons why i like the Hilton brand.",4,2013,08,20
36,Very nice hotel with rooms big enough for families,"With just about any room here, you'll get a good view of either the sea if you like water or of the hills and city if you like city lights. Modern and smart decor throughout. The beddings are very good. Plenty of lobby staff to help with luggage, cabs, directions, etc. We asked for a roll-away bed and it was promptly delivered and set up with accompanying beddings, no charge. Nice pool on an open air upper deck looking out over surrounding areas with plenty of lounge chairs and umbrellas. Breakfast buffet has a wide selection, good food, prompt wait staff. Location is on east side of the city, about 8 euro taxi ride from La Rambla or Barcelonita and 30'ish euro ride to airport. Not a central location to pedestrian tourist attractions but a very nice hotel and an easy taxi ride.",5,2013,08,20
36,"Beautiful hotel, great location","Loved this hotel, rooms were very comfortable and we were lucky enough to have a sea view.  Pool area was pleasant, good sized with plenty of seating and loungers.  Service was excellent with very courteous staff who couldn't have been more helpful.  The bar area in the lobby was luxurious and very comfortable.  The whole place had an air of tranquility which was so nice after a day sightseeing in busy Barcelona.  Location is ideal - a short walk to the beach In one direction and in the other directly opposite a large shopping mall with just about every type of shop and restaurant you would need.  We didn't eat at the hotel at all so can't comment on food or restaurant.   The hotel is in a quiet area - it takes about 25 minutes by Metro to get to the centre (ie La Rambla or port area), but we found this to be an advantage as it is much quieter and felt safer than being in the city centre.   Also recommend a trip to Camp Nou (football stadium) husband and son were lucky enough to see a match there which was a fantastic experience.   Fabulous hotel, would stay here again.",5,2013,08,19
36,Not enough Staff do carry out Work load,This hotel seem to suffer from not having enough People to carry out there jobs Properly. No Conceirge and the attitude of 1 person can do all Jobs doesn't work. After Pulling up in a taxi out the front we had to lug our own luggage up stairs into lobby with 6 people waiting simply not good enough,3,2013,08,19
36,Wonderful Experience,"What a fantastic hotel to stay with the family in a wonderful location. 

We thought that it may be a little too far our of the city but it was perfect.  8 stops on the metro gets you into the City Centre but on your return it is an oasis of calm and such a contrast from the hustle and bustle of the town. 

The rooms were large and clean and a roll away bed was easy to fit in to accommodate a child.

The pool area and terrace bar are a delight and we used this daily on our return from a day of sightseeing.

The shopping centre opposite is perfect.  There are some lovely restaurants, a supermarket to pick up drinks and snacks and for families there is a leisure area with bowling, pool, air hockey, soft play and arcade games which my children loved having an hour chill out in the evening.

Barcelona is a beautiful city and on our return we will definitely stay at the Hilton again.",5,2013,08,18
36,Really good location,"This is a nice Hilton although it seems cold. Not the temperature just the structure itself.
Right across from a mall with lots of stores, restaurants and a big grocery store.
Very close to the beach which is a fun place to hang around. Beach bars and restaurants.
Close cab ride to the Olympic pier/village area which is very nice.

All and all , we were very happy with our stay here.",4,2013,08,17
36,Was good to be back........,"I had not been back at the Hilton Barcelona Diagonal Mar for almost 2 years and I can say that is getting better and better each time I stay there. This is one top location and 1 top Hotel in Barcelona... The staff makes a huge difference from the minute you enter the hotel throughout your stay.... Really looking forward to returning to the Hilton Diagonal Mar, let it be winter, summer..... it is just the place to be and enjoy what I call a great Hotel has to offer!!!!
Special THANK YOU to Alex/Tony @ Reception (Front Desk) and Mohammed @ the Breakfast....",5,2013,08,15
36,I would go back,"Everything was very good. We were treated in a friendly manor upon arrival.
Very clean rooms. Helpful staff.
Good location.
We were here because of a Disney Cruise starting in two days. Disney actually informed us of the property. ",4,2013,08,15
36,Great place for family visit,"Would take my family (2 teens) here again. Great pool, breakfast, bar, restaurant... Very friendly staff. Close to the beach and Metro. One criticism - Wifi in the room is WAY too expensive - 25E / day. Ouch.",5,2013,08,14
36,Amazing hotel!,"Stayed in Hilton Diagonal Mar in May for Spanish GP weekend and absolutely loved it! Have no negative comments about hotel. Maybe it's not as close to the city centre, but we didn't mind walking and metro stops which were only few blocks away. Stayed in room on 17th floor which was huge and had both sea and city views. They were amazing! Staff were really friendly and I want to say thank you for Cristobal (sorry if I pronounced wrongly) who checked us in. He was really efficient and gave us all information how to get around Barcelona, and best ways to get to Circuit de Catalunya :) Thank you for a great stay!",5,2013,08,13
36,Overall very good,"We came in off a cruise ship so were there around 8am.  We were told the room was not ready, which we expected and to come back around noon to get the keys.  I would rather of just been told 2pm as it was a little frustrating just to be told ''keep checking back please''
As others have stated the front desk is understaffed and there can be a wait at peak times.  Same situation with the 4 elevators.
Lovely pool and nice deck area.  Due to buildings it doesn't get the sun until gone 10am.  Hotel bar prices were simply ridiculous.  Six euros for a soft drink?  No way.  The mall is literally across the street a 2 min walk from reception.  Really nice bars and restaurants to eat at a fraction of the price.
Room was well appointed and nicely designed.  Spacious and we had a high floor so nice view (albeit with 3 buildings in the way) of the sea.  A little bit of noise from crashing doors and noisy guests but you can get that anywhere.  Certainly not the worst I've ever had.
Breakfast was ok.  I certainly wouldn't pay 25 euros for it.  We added it to our booking at the time of booking for about £10 each which I would say is fair and would do again.
Nothing special but a good location, close to the beach and the mall with bars and restaurants.  Overall we were happy with the hotel.",4,2013,08,13
36,Needs work,Great location near the beaches north of the city.  The absolute worst part of staying here is dealing with the under staffed front desk.  Be prepared to wait in line.  The breakfast while included with my room was truly horrible.,3,2013,08,12
36,Excellent,Arrived late at night.  Excellent airconditioning in reception.  Tony checked us in fast and we were in the room within 5 minutes.  Fantastic view of the sea from our room.  Breakfast excellent with great service.  I have travelled throughout Europe and the service here is definately nearer to US standards than in many places. No complaints at all.,5,2013,08,12
36,Air-conditioned Nirvana,"A great hotel with excellent staff (particularly David in the bar).  Rooms great, breakfast superb and the location is spot-on (that's what the underground is for, after all!).  I would be more than happy to stay here again, Deo volente!",4,2013,08,10
36,Disappointed,"The q to check in was horrendous. Diamond card holder and had booked exec room on my own money. Told at check in upgraded. We weren't. Next room would have been junior suite. I am (currently sat) in a room not facing the sea that is very average. Main complaint though is about service. Simple stuff, but no water in our room. Asked ,they said as a diamond member you should have two bottles per day ( they charge quite a lot for water here) came back and reminded 4 times and no success. Finally offered it when called at 23:40 for final time. Sounds silly to moan but I spend a lot of time and money with Hilton because they are meant to look after me...",1,2013,08,10
36,Staff,"We had a very good experience at the hotel.  A great location if you want to be close to the beach, metro is close for all other matters.  Above all, Christober (executive lounge) was a huge help and made several good suggestions here.  He is typical of the staff here who have all steered us in the right direction.  Overall, the Hilton is a good value.  ",4,2013,08,10
36,july 2013 stay,"Enjoyed our stay. very experienced and helpful staff. Service was prompt and excellent. My room assignment was ready upon arrival. We went straight to our room as soon as we checked in, while others were waiting. Very professional staff.",5,2013,08,10
36,A superb visit,"I stayed here for 9 nights in a junior suite in July with my family. The hotel was excellent and we had a superb visit.

The hotel is located superbly for the beach and has a large mall and many restaurants opposite but it is in a quiet part of town so you don't suffer from traffic noise. Metro is nearby so you can get to all the tourist areas easily.

Breakfast was excellent, rooms very nice, pool area very good.  Wifi good. Housekeeping excellent.

Exec lounge could have more snacks during the day (not much to eat) but drinks were good, front desk in the hotel could be quicker, and they need more umbrellas around the pool.",5,2013,08,10
36,Very Average,"We stayed here (booked in three rooms for our family of six) for two nights before a cruise. There wasn't a bellman available to take our bags so we lugged all 8 of them up the steps ourselves. Its a 12 night cruise so no, we did not pack light! Check in took forever and then they had the room configuration wrong and so back down to check in to get that resolved. Trust me, my two teenage boys would die before having to sleep together in a bed so we HAD to get the room with two double beds which is what we had originally booked. The rooms were okay, but definitely needed some work. Scraped walls, rusting faucets, etc. the shower was almost cold during the morning when I presume everyone is taking a shower at the same time! Breakfast was very average and expensive. Internet was 25 euro or so a day which was ridiculous.",3,2013,08,08
36,First class property,"I completely agree with Judatt, this place was all you want when you aren't concerned with late night partying on Las Ramblas.  We are also Hilton Diamond and had a very nice room with a view.  It was not a one-bedroom suite, but it was a great room with a spectacular view and a wonderful bathroom.  They also put my daughter and her roommate in a nice room right next to us and gave them Executive Lounge privileges.  I think Tom K was a little harsh on the Exec Lounge.  The breakfast was excellent, and we loved the large terrace.  The snacks in the evening were good some nights but depended on what time you got there or what night it was.  We had no complaints.  There is a large mall directly across the street where you can get all kinds of food or see a movie.  We didn't try their restaurant but see the Exec Lounge as a courtesy for Hilton Honors members.  They aren't in the business of feeding us full meals each night.  The three nights we stayed there, the food in the lounge was plenty for dinner.  We had tapas during the day, so it was all we needed at night.  There is a wonderful pool and poolside restaurant/bar as well.  The staff could not have been nicer, and the cabs were always and easily accessible.  W will return to this property.",5,2013,08,07
36,Great Visit to a Great Place,Spent 2 nights at this hotel prior to boarding a Med cruise in Barcelona.  The hotel was great - being a Hilton Honors Diamond member we were upgraded to a 1 bedroom suite - very nice touch.  The lounge was very good with a good breakfast and good hors douvers in the evening.  There is a mall across the street with several good restaurants and some decent shopping.  Taxi fare to las Ramblas was very reasonable.  Would highly recommend this hotel for someone visiting Barcelona who prefers a very nice place and is not concerned with staying right on las Ramblas.,5,2013,08,07
36,"Nice, but what are they thinking with exec lounge?","Booked an exec room for a break with my wife. I have been here before and the exec lounge was amazing. One of the best I've been to. They appear to have completely diluted the offering and it's now very very average. I can't understand the reasoning behind it. Breakfast in the lounge is average too. I won't be staying here again.

The hotel itself is nice aside from this. Location a bit out but good public transport links.",3,2013,08,06
36,Excellent extended family stay,"We recently stayed at the Hilton Diagonal Mar for 3 nights with my extended family (4 rooms total) before leaving on a cruise.  Excellent staff which worked out a minor snafu in our reservation and got us our desired room configuration (connecting rooms for my family of 5 and correct room types from our other family members).  The location, while not central, is conveniently located a couple of blocks from the beach and across the street from a mall (with good fast food options and a couple of decent restaurants).  The rest of Barcelona is easily accessible via the plentiful cabs, hop on/off bus, or subway (although we did not take it).  We ate one night in the restaurant, pricey as one might expect, but good food and service.  The pool area and bar is very nice.  Would stay here again.",5,2013,08,05
36,Family vacation at the Hilton Diagonal Mar,"While this is more suited as a business hotel it was a great place for a week long family holiday. The difference here is the warm, professional staff who really went out of their way to help with some reservation problems and Hilton reservation computer system issues. The beach is two short blocks away and the full sized shopping mall is a plus.",5,2013,08,03
36,Holiday,"Wonderful hotel, would recommend to anyone going to Barcelona. It was nice to spend the day in the city then retire to what felt like a oasis of calm area. A short walk to the beach, bus stop outside the hotel to the city, shopping mall across the road, city tour bus stop 2 mins walk away. Great food, big room and a tv in the bathroom for you to watch whilst having a soak in the bath. Every thing was 100% and the staff were all amazing, the luggage arrived in our room before we did that a first for any hotel I have stayed in.",5,2013,08,03
36,Diminishing executive services,"My wife and I have stayed at the Hilton DM every year since it opened. We have always booked Executive rooms (even though I am Gold HH ) because we love the executive lounge and don't want to be disappointed if not upgraded.
However from originally offering complimentary drinks all night, over the last few years it was reduced to Happy Hour ( 1800-2000 ), but this year what a shock no spirits or liquors. Furthermore abysmal offerings of snacks at Happy Hour instead of the usual Tapas choice, no afternoon tea which was always refreshing after sunbathing or a day of retail  therapy and very limited choice for Breakfast. 
Also the pool area has been significantly reduced with the building of a large Pagoda ( obviously for the catering of the occasional corporate event or Wedding ) but resulting in all the sun beds being squeezed close together and in insufficient numbers for the sunbathers on some days.
That said our room was excellent with good views over the beach and city, the ubiquitously comfortable Hilton bed and the fastest Wifi in a Hotel room I have come across ( even faster than my home broadband ). The new TVs was also a welcome addition but very disappointing was no English news channel (where has Sky news gone ). There were a number of English speaking news channels Russian, Chinese and American, as well as about 15 non english channels from diverse parts of the world but its not the same as from your home country especially as we stayed for over a week. 
The Breakfast in the Restaurant was usual Hilton fair with added Chinese offerings and an egg cook station who's appearance was spasmodic to say the least.
The executive lounge has lost it's Identity and you have to question is it worth paying for this service which has diminished so much recently.",3,2013,08,01
36,Beachside Hilton,"We stayed here for only one night following a cruise.  Great location near beach if you are interested in Beach activities.  Not so near the rest of the city but you can catch a taxi and the Tour bus stops outside as well.  Nice hotel, Great staff and the pool is beautiful.  My only complaint was that dining was expensive - 6 Euro for a soda.",4,2013,08,01
36,Very nice,"Not in the center but easily accessible by car, tram, metro or bus. Spacious room with plenty of light and view of the Mediterranean. Breakfast with plenty of quality choices. Internet was not included in the daily rate.",4,2013,08,01
36,Amazing!,"My husband stayed at this Hotel last week and had a great time! He went there with two friends, they had two rooms booked. As the original booked rooms were not available they got an upgrade to a bigger room. One of his friends had his Birthday and when he returned to the room there was a bottle of cava and a Birthday cake in the room, this was a very lovely surprise which showed that Hilton goes the extra mile for their guests! The hotel has a nice spacious pool and a good breakfast buffet. Rooms are spacious and the staff is friendly. There is free wifi in the main area's which is fine. Thanks for making their city trip a huge success!! ",5,2013,07,31
36,Nice holidays,"I stayed here for 5 nights with my husband, brother and 2 young children in July 2013.
What we liked best :
- kids pool
- breakfast (variety of food, staff kindness)
- kids menu is free at restaurant
- staff kindness : Marlene at Front desk, Enzo at breakfast and especially a big thank you to Maria at restaurant for dinner)
What we liked least :
- swimming pool closed at 20h00 PM even in summer
- room service (too expensive for the bad quality of food) : we ordered twice during our stay and everything was cold each time (french fries, club sandwich, hilton burger, dry chicken in caesar salad)
- paying wifi in bedrooms
- not enough sun umbrella at swimming pool
Overall we had a very enjoyable holiday at Hilton Diagonal Mar, our children were delighted !!",3,2013,07,31
36,Absolutely beautiful,"I was taken here for four nights for a romantic break, WOW...Amazing staff, beautiful views, unbelievably clean, perfect location, not a bad thing to say about this place.... i loved every second. Pool, spa, sauna, gym, amazing views.. what more could you ask for??? help with your bags as soon as you get out the taxi, unbelievable.",5,2013,07,30
36,"Loved the hotel last year, mixed feelings due to cutbacks","The hotel was great last year, and had an amazing executive lounge with superb offerings.
Now they are pathetic they close the executive lounge at 20H00.

Food offerings are not even half of how great they used the be a year ago.

Drinks during happy hour? No more liquors.

Hilton stop doing these cutbacks! You will lose many people their loyalty.

I sincerely hope the management rethinks these changes.

And really, the hotel has a lounge with an amazing view. Please do not close it that early!

One thing I know for sure, unless things change I won't be back.

And btw offering gold members such a poor breakfast? You should be ashamed!",3,2013,07,30
36,Outstanding,"Barcelona was the second destination part of my honeymoon Europe trip and we checked in Hilton Diagonal mar. We were upgraded to a relaxation room and were offered strawberry and champagne ! The room was nice, comfortable, clean and had everything you could ask for in a Hilton. There is a very big mall next to Hilton where you can enjoy various types of food. The beach is only 10 mins walk away and so is the nearest metro station. The hotel has a nice pool as well. All in all, if you are in Barcelona and want to enjoy both city and beach atmosphere, then this hotel has everything you could ask for. Wholeheartedly recommended !",5,2013,07,28
36,"Nice hotel, close to beach","We were treated first class. We checked in early and checked out late. We received a nice upgrade to the 21st floor. The room was clean and a good size. The views of the water and city were nice.
The executive lounge was good with great views also. The selection of food was good for a continental breakfast. The pool is also very enjoyable. The beach is only one block away. We also took a bus into the main part of town-only 15 minutes.  Also received a bottle of champagne for our 25th wedding anniversary- what a pleasant surprise. Will stay here again!",5,2013,07,25
36,Enjoyable in new part of the city and American friendly.,"Stayed two nights prior to a Disney Cruise, family of four, and I am a Hilton Gold Member.  I did research on Trip Advisor before booking and noted the pros and cons.

Hotel arranged for a car transfer at the airport and it was very smooth.  Glad we did this.
Check in was simple and was able to get rooms at 8AM.  I did book two rooms connecting and the only complaint was while traveling from the USA I received an email saying my reservation was canceled.  They had canceled and then rebooked with two new confirmation numbers due to available room bedding options, but not being notified of this was very stressful and could have been avoided.

We wanted to see the sites before our cruise and Cristobal at the front desk was EXTREMELY helpful.  He booked us a car with a private guide.  The nice thing was he was able to coordinate them picking us up at Camp Nou so we could do the 2 hour tour on our own in the morning before starting the guided tour.  He went as far as having a map with the exact location of pickup sent to our room.  The guided tour was well worth the money as we were able to be whisked around the city and learn more in four hours than we could in four days.  We even scheduled to have the guide take us out for tapas so we could have the culinary culture explained to us at a place they would eat at.

The complimentary continental breakfast for Gold Members I give a B+ grade.  They are unusually strict about getting one of each of three food types (cereal, pastry and bread).  I did not see the big deal in just wanting two croissants as they said no, but in my mind I thought it was more of a cultural way of handling it.

The internet is free for Gold and Platinum members for up to three devices.  I read lots of complaints on this, but being in hotels frequently on business I actually prefer this.  The reason is if too many people are on, the speed is too slow.  Then everyone complains about it being free, but having poor speed.  You can get free access in the lobby, but have to ask for a code that gives you 8 hours.  Again, controlling the number of people on so the speed stays fast enough so you don’t feel like you are on a dial up connection.

The pool was nice.  The winds due pick up in the afternoon.  The attendant is not a life guard, so you have to watch your little ones in the water.

Cabs are plentiful next to the hotel.  There is a large mall across the street that has everything from McDonalds to Starbucks and a frozen yogurt shop like Orange Leaf in the USA.  The food there is in the B category, more like dining in chain restaurants.  If you want authentic, you can ask the front desk and they have business cards for restaurants you can give the cab driver and they take you right there.  They also call in advance and make a reservation for you.

I also did a small currency exchange at the hotel.  The difference to the published rate was 5%.  I thought that was reasonable versus dealing with an ATM.

The people in Spain that work in tourism I found like Americans.  Two main reasons, we tip when they normally do not receive much in gratuity and we are punctual as opposed to other cultures that are not some much.

We are scheduled to stay again after our cruise and will not cancel and rebook elsewhere as it was a GREAT experience for us.",5,2013,07,25
36,Hilton Barcelona,"Very nice hotel ......... We only stayed one night , after a cruise, on our way to Nice, but everything was great !  The executive lounge was very nice.  Close to the Flamenco show .   It was a short cab ride and was well worth seeing.   The mall was very close and so was the beach.",4,2013,07,24
36,"Somethings better, some slipping","Fourth stay at this hotel. Still a great location and great staff. The hotel is clean, bright and well kept. A huge improvementhave been wifi for free in public areas (people on holiday don't want to pay 25 euros a day for wifi to connect with Facebook !), this brings people into the lobby and gives the place more  of a buzz which is good. Two small moans, the first can't be fixed or at least I don't think so.... big hotel, lot of people and only 4 lifts, we had to wait up to 6 mins for one to arrive, on average at least 3 or 4... The second, we had access to the Exec floor, same as last time... standards have dropped off quite a bit, breakfast was a bit of a joke, it seems that the exec lounge was getting to popular and so they have down graded the standard to push people to take the main breakfast at 25euro a head. International news papers are photo copies. Drinks and snacks available are limited outside the two hours open bar. They even charge 7 euros for a beer ! The hotel is making great efforts to attract people during tough times, well done.. please don't try and cut corners, it make customers think that what seemed to be a good deal is in fact a poor deal.",4,2013,07,24
36,Great Room and Pool Efficient Staff,"Good Points
-Pool area is relaxed and quiet
-Staff in executive lounge were helpful with printing boarding passes
-Room was large and on a high floor
-Free WiFi for Hilton Golds
-Good executive lounge breakfast wide selection,
-Fantastic views from executive lounge on 15th floor
-Comfy pool loungers and towels available

Bad Points-
-As a Hilton Gold member we politely asked in advanced for an upgrade request, this was ignored at check in.
-On the final day we asked for late check out, we were first locked out of our room and then had to go back to reception to receive another key card for the executive floor which we had been prevented from getting to.
-We expected to receive a sea view from our room, instead we received a view of the city which we did not want.
-Executive lounge closed on the dot at 8pm, I had just moved out of the lounge and when I came back my drink was gone and the lounge was shut.
-Poor executive lounge food selection after breakfast, only popcorn, nuts, crisps and other strange food
-When walking into the executive lounge with another couple were trying to find the lounge, we were greeted with 'ROOM NUMBER!' We felt this was very rude considering we had a keycard to access the floor as well as previously visiting the lounge.

We would not stay here again, it was only the porters which stood out and were helpful and the executive lounge clerk who helped to print our boarding passes.",3,2013,07,23
36,"Quite pleasant, nothing special.","First room we were given smelt strongly of cigarette smoke,  to their credit they immediately changed room for another one.  Good breakfast.  A little out of the way, but didn't have to go far to catch Hop on Hop off bus.",3,2013,07,23
36,Lovely Hilton Diagonal Mar,We had booked five nights here as a post cruise stay. The Hotel is perfectly located near the beach and across the street from a shopping mall. It is easlily accessible by taxi or metro. We loved the room on the 17th floor with a great view. Would definately stay here again if we get a good deal.,5,2013,07,22
36,Nice stay for business trip,"Stayed here in Feb for a business meeting. The hotel was clean and staff was friendly. The location is a little bit boring if you stay right by the hotel, but cab rides into the city are not that expensive and the hotel staff was really helpful in pointing out locations to find good restaurants and shopping, etc.  The rooms were very comfortable and the nice thing about this location is that it's quiet and when hosting a business meeting there were not too many distractions so my attendees actually attended ;) while still being able to get into the city during free-time.  There's a shopping center/mall right across the street that was nice with good stores and decent restaurants and the beach is just on the other side of the street.  Even in Feb took a nice walk onto the beach.  It was a nice distraction from the cold NE US weather.  Breakfast buffet was good enough to fuel early sightseeing and if you stay on the club level the lounge is decently stocked.  In general, this was an enjoyable stay at a great hotel and I high recommend if you're heading into Barca for business.",4,2013,07,22
36,"Convention centre, near beach, but dull concrete area","Excellent location for nearby convention centre, a 5 minute walk to beach so worth it if you are on business trip and want a quick breakaway, pleasant pool (closed early am but nobody stopped me using it anyway).  Decent buffet breakfast, fair sized rooms, reasonable front desk and laundry service, solid all round business hotel.  Would have given it 4 stars vs 3 but the area is high rise, concrete and ugly, and the street vibe is non-existent - in a city like Barcelona these are unforgivable !",3,2013,07,21
36,Solid business hotel in Barcelona,"If you are going to Barcelona for business and visiting the city is not top of your list, you can definitely make this hotel your night HQ. 

PROS: amazing attentive service, great breakfast choice and products quality, facing the beach so perfect for an early/late swim or run along the shore, generous size rooms

CONS: paying wifi in the rooms, limited choice of amenities (I.e. no slippers & vanity set)",4,2013,07,20
36,too many rules and restrictions,"In my 10 years of being diamond HH, this hotel was my least favorite Hilton.  I suppose part of it is my own fault for not doing my research.  It was in an area of town better suited for business travelers and not a family vacation.  It is in an area of town where it takes ages to get to anywhere else. We hated the walk to the beach. (They say 3 minutes, but more like 20 until you are actual on the sand from your room.) We hated that there are no balconies to enjoy the view. Well...there is 1 in the lounge.  They close the lounge for 1 hour during the 12-1 for cleaning, only serve complimentary drinks from 6pm-8pm, and closes sharply at 8 pm.  The sun hasn't even gone down yet.  I would feel taken advantage of, if I had to pay for this amenity.  There is a mall across the street to get what you need.  The prices in the hotel are outrageously high (compared to London, Hong Kong...) and they have arrange a situation where you have no other choice.  The pool also closes at 8pm, although they start telling you to leave at 7:40.  I think I would have had a different experience as a business traveler.",3,2013,07,17
36,Helpful Staff and pleasant hotel,"Although rather out of town, this hotel has a lot of benefits. In the middle of July, the city is hot and mobbed with tourists and this is an oasis of calm, near a beach and a shopping centre with choice of reasonably priced restaurants.  I had a bit of a tussle at check in as I am a Hilton Gold member and particularly wanted to get an upgrade to executive room as I wanted access to the executive lounge for a bit of afternoon peace and quiet (I had been offered a stand-by upgrade via email but this was not mentioned at check in) I had booked two delux rooms on bed and breakfast package for five nights for a family birthday break and had emailed to let them know it was a special occasion but the hotel had some sort of conference going on and so were reluctant to part with executive rooms. They did eventually manage to find me one executive room but said they could not allow my son access to the executive lounge as they would exceed capacity for breakfast - we were allowed to take one guest in the afternoon so it was no real hassle. Our executive room was right opposite the lounge and we observed that at all times (including breakfast) it was far from capacity - but I guess the hotel has a 'policy' about such things and we had a breakfast package (for the main restaurant)  anyway. This might actually put me off using this hotel on my next planned trip to Barcelona. I stay often in central London Hilton Hotels and they seem to be able to use discretion with regard the hotel's policies. The metro station is nearby and by far the best way to get around - quick and cool. Also the tram to the centre of town runs from behind the shopping centre which is opposite. The pool area is good - although there was work going on around the adjacent terrace which was a bit noisy. The lobby bar prices were very expensive (just as well we wrangled for the exec lounge!) but this is pretty normal in hotels.  All in all a good hotel. Hilton Gold members - you may have to haggle!",4,2013,07,17
36,modern european interesting and a pleasure,I was here for a convention. the location f.or this purpose is excellent as it is also for having a relaxing walk or run outdoor after work. the hotel is perfect and really enjoyable. interesting modern architecture of external and internal details. I hope to come back.,4,2013,07,16
36,Bad attitude in staff,"Firstly the hotel and room is fine, the hotel prices are shocking as of today July 2013 a bottle of water in the mini bar is €5.50 and cola is €6. A burger in the bar is €20. Wi-fi in room is a shocking €25 for 24 hours.

The pool prices are the same as above, free wi-fi in public areas.

I'm on holiday and like a lie in as no work, anyway from early on I can here clearly banging doors shut this making me tired I decided to lie in a bit longer, at around 12.15 I leave my room at 603 and the cleaners trolley is waiting outside as is she.
I looked at her and she did a big sigh of relief and shrugged her shoulders as. If to say in body language ""at last I can clean your room finally"" I looked back and she shoke her head at me and grabbed towels from the trolley and stormed into my room.

I told reception at 4pm and Rachel abruptly said to me ""this is not my problem why are you getting on at me"". She was very rude and unpolitical and frowned her face at me when I was only suggesting she tell her cleaners not to be so rude to guests.

Now to make it clear some customers are on holiday to relax and don't expect cleaners chatting. Upside there room and banging doors trying to get you to leave there room. P.s. the sign was clearly on the door saying, do not disturb.

Having encountered the two members of rude staff I will never come back to this hotel ever again and would suggest you come as long as you leave the rooms at 10am. 

All my reviews are very honest and I rarely complain about anything.

Adam p.s. the hotel is a rip off with the prices and I have travelled the world, and Some members of staff very rude.

P.s. I asked for in advance a high top floor room, I f you book. The basic room the highest floor level for that type of accommodation is on the 6th floor and not above.",2,2013,07,13
36,Pleasant stay,"We stayed here last summer and the service was incredible. For an additional 60€ we were upgraded to the executive floor and it was an absolute delight. Stunning views, lovely decor, and the service was brilliant from the moment we walked in! Would recommend to anyone who is looking to be a few minutes away from the inner city!",5,2013,07,12
36,Nicest Hotel we've stayed at in Europe,"We booked this hotel for a post cruise 1 night stay.  We have been to many hotels throughout Europe, and none have come close to this.  Our room was on the 10th floor, and we had a beautiful view of the city.  We were well within walking distance to area malls (one being right across the street).  The staff at the front desk were very helpful.  We traveled with our young son, so we had a roll away bed in our room, which was just as comfortable as a regular bed.",4,2013,07,11
36,Great visit,"Walking distance to the beach! Across the street is a great playground for little kids and their is a skate park across the street. The kids loved having the option of pool or beach after a day of sightseeing. Great mojitos too. The only downfall is the food on the club level. Mushy eggs, and barely cooked bacon.  ",4,2013,07,09
36,Wow!  Loved it!,"I stayed here for two nights with my 10 year old son. We loved it!  The front desk was very helpful.  

It is located in a very upscale neighborhood.  There is plenty of places to shop and eat within walking distance.  It is also close to the double decker bus tour pick up (we purchased our tickets at the hotel for the bus).  We took a cab from the airport (about 20euro)

As Hilton gold, this experience was a real treat. The executive floor was impressive as was the breakfast. It was one of the best I have been to at Hilton.  It was a great value.",5,2013,07,09
36,Free wifi in the lobby area...,"I just came back yesterday from a 5 days stay. The location is great with a constant availability of taxis, a mall facing the hotel and a subway at a 5 minutes walking distance. The hotel was very comfortable however i would like to highlight some points. A paper in the room informed us that now free wifi was available in the lobby area since many guests asked for it.... A better improvement would have been to provide guests with free internet allthrough the hotel as many other well quoted hotels do. Furthermore, i stayed in an executive room (very comfortable and big enough, I would put a 5 score for it), and had access to the executive lounge which is not quite remarkable except for the nice sea view. The food choices were very limited in the afternoon compared to other hotels we have visited and again there was no free wifi there. Breakfast was convenient in the lounge and rich enough in the restaurant with a nice staff. The pool was not well exposed to the sun due to surrounding buildings unfortunately.The staff was professional. The TV was a nightmare!! All movie channels were in spanish, the rest being news channels in arabic or in english (CNN, etc) which we were not interested in at all. How come there are no international channels in english or french worth being seen by people escaping from the stress of political or stock market news or those who unfortunately do not speak spanish?? We understand that there is a Pay tv for movies on demand, but there are also so many channels available worldwide such as Foxmovies, star movies Dubai one, etc and a couple of french channels (France 2, TF1...) which would have given us a better perception of our stay. Those small details are what make us feel at home when abroad. And having enjoyed other Hilton hotels as well as other chains in different countries, I believe it is constructive to provide this feedback. I would rate my stay with an average of 4,  and would though strongly recommend it to other travelers.",4,2013,07,08
36,"Good property with some issues, especially Gold breakfast!","This property is a nice one, although probably not worth the 200E+ rates that are often on offer here.  The rooms are well appointed, with a mix of hardwood floors and carpeting.  The bed is the standard Hilton offering, as are the toiletries.  The sea views are nice, but probably not as remarkable as the city views afforded from the high floors.

The bathroom has a separate shower and bathtub, although the design isn't exactly the best one, with a window over the bathtub that cannot be blocked.

As a gold member, upgraded to a sea-view room, no lounge access, and a very mixed breakfast experience.  The first day was offered the full buffet, which was OK by European Hilton standards.  The second day was offered an extremely poor continental offering in the lobby bar, which was surrounded by flies and extremely distasteful.  It wasn't even up to the equivalent of a Holiday Inn Express or Hampton Inn breakfast!  Further, the staff was very much unsure as to what should be done, as no guest should eat their breakfast in a bar, whether it is continental or full buffet.  The seating does not property suit the setting, as one cannot properly eat in those chairs in the lobby bar.

I think it must be fair to give the property four stars, because that is what it is - a decent 4-star property.  The location is well removed from the touristic points in the city, as well as much of the business locations in the region.  It does have a fantastic location for beach goers, as well as a decent pool offering on-site.  If a decent breakfast is a requirement, I wouldn't hesitate to go to the more centrally-located Hilton over this one.  After a couple of days it was quite frustrating to take the public transportation to the centre.  There are many more affordable options under 150E/night that are of equal quality, and it is apparent that the property is taking advantage of the Hilton name to bring in additional revenue from nervous international tourists.",4,2013,07,08
36,Lovely Hotel,"This Hilton is a very Lovely hotel and the staff are very pleasant and helpful.
I arrived way before check in and the staff where very accomodating in getting me a room ready early. The room was spacious and clean. The room service was quick and the food was good quality. 
I stayed at the Hilton for business but managed to use the Gym and pool area which were both very nice.
Overall the hotel in genral along with the location and pleasant staff would make me consider staying here again.
I have no faults with this Hotel.
Also the bed was extremly comfy.",5,2013,07,08
36,"I wrote a not so nice review 5 years ago, but hotel has become very good","Five years ago I was not so positive about the hotel, but after several visits I see a great improvement in staff, breakfast. Actually this has become one of my favorite Hilton Hotels.
First the location is great, at the sea, near to attractions like harbor and zoo, and shopping center across the street. The staff is now very well trained, no complaints at all.
Breakfast now has more options than any Hilton I have been to. This hotel now is a great choice, good value for money.",4,2013,07,07
36,Nice hotel - close to beach and shopping mall,"I stayed at the Hilton Diagonal Mar after a 12 day Med cruise.  We used our points to get two connecting rooms.  The rooms were large, clean, and very nice.  They were ready when we got there after our tour at 5 pm.  I had some friends staying there that had gotten there earlier in the day, who didn't have as positive an experience.  The location is great.  Walking distance to the beach, there's a mall with lots of food options across the street.  The have a very nice pool area and the views are magnificent.",5,2013,07,02
36,Hilton Diagonal Mar,"I stayed here for 5 days while on vacation with friends. Immediately after check in the staff brought up the extra cot we requested and added the extra towels and water for the 3rd person as well. All the staff we encountered were professional and extremely nice especially Juan, one of the doormen. The food in the executive lounge was delicious. the tourist bus stops right by the hotel and the beach is a quick walk away. good food is a quick taxi away.",5,2013,07,01
36,Good location,"Good stay in this hotel. The staff is very pleasant and the hotel in general is nice. Food is excellent and very gourmet, from breakfast to lunch. The hotel is equipped with a pool that I didn't get a chance to try...! Avoid the rooms ending with ""01"" as they are just next to the room service access, quite noisy. I've asked to change and it was no problem. Rooms are quite large and well appointed, The view from the upper levels is great, city, sea ... Only bad point is that WiFi is not complementary which should be the case in this type of average room rate hotel. Overall a good stay and recommended hotel.",4,2013,06,29
36,Hotel very nice but...,"The check in line was at least 10 ahead of us and the check out line was so very long, I felt sorry for both the clerks working and the people waiting!  We checked in on June 16, 2013 about 10:30 am which we were told would not be a problem.  Our room was not ready and our luggage was taken to a luggage hold.  We then left the hotel to see some sites.  We returned to the hotel after 2:00 and again waited in line again (shorter this time) to get our room.  Our room was on the 7th floor on an angle and you could somewhat see the Med. if you looked at a certain angle.
The room was very clean and well appointed.  Our luggage was to be ""sent right up"" and needless to say almost 3 hrs later, I went downstairs to get my luggage and a bell boy helped me take it up!  The bar/lobby area very nice.  We looked at the pool but did not get to swim in it as by the time we returned fro dinner the pool was closed.  We had coke/drinks in the lobby bar; very nice staff but again very slow.  We had the breakfast buffet the next morning before checking out and it was ok.  The area of the hotel felt very safe as well.  The only negative things I can say is the check-in and luggage.  I also think Wi-Fi should be free to all Hilton Honors members in their rooms.  It is free in the lobby.",4,2013,06,27
36,Always going back,Went with a friend to celebrate a birthday and once again I think it is an excellent hotel in a great location. Love going back just to relax in the beginning of the summer. Everyone at the pool bar without exception is excellent; and amazing concierge service; they were able to provide us with the best spots and always having a care to reserve or creating a guest list for us! Back next year.,4,2013,06,27
36,a very good place to stay,"Nice place , nice people , beautiful landscape in the mornig , reastaurants are very close , subway station next street , clean , good food , free sauna , gym and pool , helpfull personal ....best place to stay - Barcelona love you forever :))) skate parc in the back of the hotel .
      ",5,2013,06,27
36,Beautiful hotel in a beautiful part of the city!,Absolutely loved our stay at the Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona. Close to shopping and beaches. Friendly knowledgeable staff members were very helpful. Our room was very clean and comfortable. Very nice lap pool and gym with dry sauna. Just wish there was a hot tub in the pool area.,5,2013,06,27
36,Expected more from Hilton,"I first noticed the Hilton when I stayed in the nearby Barcelona Princess. It appealed to me as the pool deck was enormous, in comparison to the Princess.  Unfortunately, this is the only real good thing about it. We checked in on a Monday evening and it was mainly a business crowd. We waited around 15 minutes to check in. The staff were courteous but clearly over-worked. The reception area seems too small for the size of the hotel.  Our room was on the 7th floor. When we stepped out of the elevator, the first thing that hit me was the smell. Couldn't quite put my finger on the odour - almost damp like. The room didn't smell any better, it had clearly been smoked in. The room was cleaned and the standard of the room service was excellent throughout our stay.   It's €25 a day for internet access. A bit excessive in my opinion, considering the amount of hotels that now offer it complimentary. You can access on a roaming login. You can use Boingo, iPass or AT&T.  There was an evening event for some conference people held on the pool deck. I didn't appreciate having to fight my way through 100+ people in business dress, whilst i'm in my pool gear!   Overall the Hotel was ok. Don't think i'll be staying again.",3,2013,06,25
36,"Nice location, solid","Stayed there for three nights on June 2013. Hotel was clean, good service, and I really liked that there is a clean public beach just a short stroll away. There is also a big shopping centre right next to the hotel. Not right in the centre of Barcelona, but close enough - and the area is quite peaceful. Inside just standard Hilton - so very ok.",5,2013,06,24
36,Everything Hilton should be,"Not all Hilton hotels live up to their reputation - Diagonal Mar goes further than many. Excellent service, and all the expected quality of a world class hotel. The pool deck is great and allows you to enjoy Barcelona weather without the crowds. Breakfast excellent as always. Can't fault it.",5,2013,06,21
36,hilton barcelona diagnal mar,ok hotel away from everything - not much to do at night unless you catch transport into the city- this Hotel is probably best if you need to be asleep by 9:00pm as there is absolutely nothing to do in the area,3,2013,06,21
36,"Great, if the locations right for you","Travelled here on business in Feb 2013, so didn't have any choice on where we would be located... it's not something I'd normally have gone for (I previously considered the only place worth staying for a city break was in the middle of the hustle and bustle) however I found myself pleasantly surprised.

A lovely new build area, with a fantastic little park... sure you're not going to find your traditional little tapas bar just round the corner, but it has everything on hand you could need (including a substantial mall and supermarket across the road). As a bonus you feel like you can actually go back to your hotel to relax for a few hours when it all gets too much; something you can't do quite as well when you're in the middle of it all.

As for the hotel itself, fantastic breakfast, the range of items on offer: hot, cold, and anything in between, I couldn't complain. Just one negative, on one evening the hotel put on a served dinner for the conference and it was terrible quality. Judging by all other experiences I assume it was a one off, perhaps induced by the number of people they needed to serve, and that is all that steals a star from this review.",4,2013,06,20
36,Great Hotel! Right next to a mall!,"This is a nice clean easy hotel to stay in before you head to the cruise port, you can walk to the mall, starbucks, and restaurants!! There is a stuf for smaller kids to do right across the street and if you want you can walk to the beach!",4,2013,06,19
36,Great contemporary out of town hotel,"A very pleasant contemporary Hilton, with great service and facilities. But it is a little way out of the town centre and, if you don't want the 45-minute (but lovely) walk along the promenade, taxi costs will mount.",4,2013,06,18
36,Hilton Diagonal Mar,Great Hotel and service. Early June 2013 visit. Great Location away from city center but with easy access to it through metro station which is short walk from hotel. (t-10 metro transport card for 10 Euros allows you to take the metro 10 times.  Highly recommend.) Enjoy and get to know the locals in the metro. Very friendly people. Always keep an eye on pickpockets. Mostly in crowded areas such as La Rambla. Very safe area overall. Nice Shopping center across the street from hotel. Good restaurants for everyone. Great Tapas and Paellas. Hotel staff extremely helpful with great service. One of the best Hilton Hotels . Executive Lounge highly recommended.,5,2013,06,17
36,A place to definitely stay in Barcelona!,"Lots of stays at this hotel. 
I have never had a negative experience. 
On the contrary, I have always had wonderful ones.
I must say that it’s really impressive  to have found there such REGULARITY in the EXCELLENCE.
Sincere congratulations to ALL the hotel staff for the professionalism, the attention, the sensitivity they delightly bring to their customers.
This staff is extraordinary, the hotel infrastructures and facilities are in the top end of the range.
Please, if you stay in Barcelona, go there, you won't be disapointed.",5,2013,06,16
36,Diagonal Mar Hilton Hotel,"For a 4* hotel the service was pretty poor and surprising. Staff not hugely helpful on the first day we were there and we didnt have internet access in our rooms which you would have expected from a bussiness type of hotel.. I've been in much worse hotels for sure but when you go to a 4* hotel for business your expectations are raised and this hotel did not meet them! However, the breakfast was brilliant.",2,2013,06,14
36,Gran Prix Weekend.,"This hotel is lovely as long as you dont mind not being in the middle of the city centre (it was a good hour walk to the city). We arrived at 6pm and were quickly checked by competent reception staff however as our room was not quite ready we were provided with a drink in the reception area (no charge). The room was lovely, clean and had a floor to ceiling window looking out on the shopping mall opposite that has loads of shops and places to eat. We attended our welcome meeting on the roof terrace and it was a lovely bar area with a swimming pool and sun lounges. All of the staff were pleasant and we had breakfast included which was buffet style and very very nice. All in all it is a lovely hotel, friendly staff and a great base for the Gran Prix weekend.",5,2013,06,13
36,3 star only. not recommended,"Right beside CCIB- thats good Small room, despite paying 50 E a night upgrade. Rip off internet room charges Smallest gym I've ever seen, not well equipped Pool ok- a bit small considering the space they have- only 20-25 m. Breakfast buffet unwaveringly the same with little variety( food is OK). Lobby packed at all hours with loud tourists. Seriously below expectations for a Hilton",2,2013,06,11
36,"Great location for Primavera Sound, otherwise avoid","I stayed at the Hilton Diagonal Mar at the end of May for pretty much one reason only - it's proximity to the Forum where the Primavera Sound music festival is held at this time of year.

I've been to Barcelona many times before and this isn't a part of town I would ever go to usually and I certainly wouldn't think about staying there for any other reason than the festival. It's just there's not much other reason to be in this part of town and there are so many other nicer parts of Barcelona that are more central and better for the main attractions.

As far as the Hilton itself is concerned, it's a nice enough four star hotel, if a little more faceless and corporate than I would normally choose.  Still, the staff were generally pretty friendly and the room was a generous size and fairly well decked out.

There were a few wrinkles, however, that are probably worth a mention. 

Firstly, there was the strong odor of stale cigarettes in the room when I checked in - not a nice first impression and it never really went away, so I don't know where it was coming from.  

Then there was the inflated prices - small bottles of water 5 EUR each in the mini-bar and internet in the room at 8 EUR an hour, I don't think so... but then I guess that's what you get when you stay at  'corporate' style hotel. 

Finally though, and worst of all, housekeeping got my check out day wrong and I was rudely awaken while recovering from a very late morning finish at the festival. I can tell you I was not very happy to have the housekeeper banging on my door (despite the 'do not disturb sign') and shouting at me that I had to leave the room just a few hours after having gotten to sleep. This was, as you can imagine, extremely irritating and not very professionally handled. A four star hotel really should do better than this and I'd add that I was surprised how indifferent reception was when I mentioned this checking out - they couldn't really have cared less.

Other things to mention, well the huge terrace on the second floor had a small pool for swimming lengths, an even smaller 'kids' pools, with a fair number of loungers around these as well as a separate bar and small restaurant area. This wasn't an unpleasant place to hang out, but it did feel strangely 'dead' and  the echoing bland euro-pop constantly blasting out of the outdoor speakers didn't do much to help matters.

There's a gigantic anonymous modern shopping centre opposite, complete with Starbucks, McDonalds and huge underground supermarket, not to mention hundreds of other chain shops. The beach isn't too far a walk away, maybe 10 mins or so, but it will take you another 30-40 along the beach to get to the much livelier (and central) Port Olympic and Barcelonetta areas - this is actually quite a nice walk if you have the time.

Basically I wouldn't recommend that you stay at the Hilton Diagonal Mar unless you specifically want to be somewhere very close to the Forum for some kind of event, such as Primavera Sound. You'd be crazy not stay somewhere more vibrant and central if this isn't the case. 

[I have knocked a star off of my overall rating due to the incident with housekeeping]",2,2013,06,11
36,Another great Hilton hotel,"The building looks quite modern and funky from outside. The rooms are reasonably sized (not too small, not too big). The donuts at breakfast were delicious. The staff was very helpful and happily met any special requests. We struggled a bit finding the hotel the first time as it's not on the main road when you go out of the metro station but it was quite easy after the first time. There is a good shopping centre nearby.",5,2013,06,09
36,Executive rooms were small but a great Hotel overall,"The hotel is just a 10 minute walk from Camp Nou, just perfect when one is attending the Football matches. 

We were a family and got ourselves upgraded to a Executive room hoping that we would get a larger room but it was just the same size as that of a normal room, even worse the bathroom didn't have a tub. 

Overall a great hotel in terms of room quality and service.",4,2013,06,08
36,Great Stay,"Spent three days in Barcelona for a conference and had the family join us. The property is well maintained and we were able to get a great rate on two connecting rooms for the time we were there. I should give a special mention to Hugo at the front desk for getting everything arranged as I arrived six hours before my family. 

The only thing I thought could have been better was the daytime selection of snacks in the Executive lounge. Evening and Breakfast were great but mid day is pretty weak - not a complaint, just a note. - One other thing the pool can be windy but after 1:00 or so on both days it died down considerably and was very enjoyable. Thanks again for a great stay and looking forward to the next visit.",5,2013,06,08
36,Sloppy,"Location: You will need public transport, taxi or walking more than half an hour to get to the city centre.
Efficient reception at check-in. Asking to postpone checkout for one hour was flatly denied.
Wifi: free in the lobby. A rip-off if you want it in-room.
Room: big sticky red spots on the curtains. At least they had got most of the (ketchup?) off the carpet. The clock radio could not be adjusted to show the correct time without tools, and was not fixed despite reception assurance. The most noisy minibar fridge I have ever encountered. Fortunately it shuts off the compressor at night.
Breakfast: This is clearly run very well. Buffet is kept tidy, staff is service-minded and fast, and you will hardly miss anything.
Conclusion: Unless you rely on a bonus program, better options in Barcelona can be had for less money.",3,2013,06,08
36,A classy Hilton ( at last ),"Stayed on a conference trip just overnight. Staff were very helpful at check in and out. Room was exceptionally clean and modern. Now with free Internet. At last someone is listening. 
Breakfast buffet is enormous and fresh omelettes a delight. 
Food in restaurant overall is typically Catalan and superb. Beef meltingly tender. Salmon and muscles very tasty. 
Will bring family back as near beach. Only drawback is that it is ten minutes in a cab from the main centre. ",5,2013,06,07
36,Great business stay,"Stayed here on a business trip and the loation was perfect for the conference centre and the beach. Far from town but there is a bus stop just outside where you can get the hop on hop off tour bus. Exec lounge and terrace was fantastic.....
There was a festival nearby while we were there and the noise was noticable till the early hours....take some earplugs and you will be fine. 
Lovely pool! Would definately go again.",5,2013,06,07
36,Great Hotel but Far from main attraction sites,"Overall the room and service was very nice. The staff was very helpful and speak english very well. The breakfast was good.  The bed was very comfortable. surrounded by Diagonal Mar Shopping Centre, Meseu Bleu and Llevant Beach. But it is little bit far from Rambla or Passeig Gracia as the heart of Barcelona Tourism Area.",4,2013,06,03
36,Great location and very nice rooms and staff,"This hotel is fairly new and very nice.   The staff are very helpful and speak English.   The location is only a 15 minute taxi ride from the cruise terminal.  And located a 1/2 block from one of the hop on/hop off tour bus stops.  The hotel has discount tickets available, as well.  There is a huge mall right across the street with several choices of restaurants from outdoor cafes to more upscale and also an indoor food court - something for everyone and all budgets.  Plus, of course, shopping.  We would definitely stay here again when in Barcelona.",4,2013,06,02
36,"Noisy at night, otherwise OK","Very loud rock music outside disturbed a number of my friends. Good food in the main dining room. Helpful and friendly staff. Nice room, slightly odd undersized sink with hostile plumbing but not enough to constitute a problem.
Terrific convenience for the main congress centre. I would be happy to stay here again.",4,2013,06,02
36,Great business hotel in center of shopping and business,"Had a great experience staying at this very nice Hilton property in Barcelona, Spain.
Had a fine executive lounge on the 4th floor and workout area on the 6th floor.
Nicely located near shopping, business and the Barcelona football stadium.
Nice restaurant and bar -- would highly recommend.  Nicely located only 3 blocks
from hop on, hop off tourist bus and the hotel even has discount tickets.",4,2013,06,01
36,Can't fault it......,"I've just been to Barcelona for 2 nights to escape from the kids and what a perfect place to do it in.....

The staff were friendly, knowledgeable and nothing was too much trouble for the fantastic chef who was able to rustle up magnficent gluten-free breaksfasts and evening meals. 

The breakfast buffet was deliciously and lovingly varied and to be honest I couldn't fit much else in before 3pm, I ate so well. 

The room was spotless, the mattress perfect with no hint of sagging and the only teeny gripe I could think of was a lack of hook on the back of the bathroom door. The view from the tub was of shops, mountains and sky and the view from the bedroom showed me the bluest of seas and skies. 

Free wifi, use of computers in lobby, helpful safe and storage for luggage on day of departure and a totally cool narrow but perfectly formed outside pool and terrace bar.

Opposite a shopping centre, a tourist bus stop and a five minute walk to the beach (about a 45 min stroll to the Parc Ciutadella), I came back in love with the place :-)

Will definitely return and recommend. If you book through Olotels, insist the voucher is sent while you are on the line with the sales guy!",5,2013,05,28
36,Eye watering wifi charges,"This is a comfortable enough hotel, with clean, quiet rooms, but the charge for wifi in your room is €8 per hour or €25 per day!   In my experience, most similar hotels are now offering wifi free.  Also, you can't print out a boarding pass at the 'Business Centre'.  Instead you have to use a couple of computers in reception, and the printer is wrongly aligned, so it cuts off the date on your boarding pass - something that caused one of my colleagues a lot of problems at the airport.   Come on Hilton, you can do better than this!",3,2013,05,23
36,Two years on - what a difference,"We stayed at this hotel two years ago when going to the Spanish GP and loved it, great service etc. The hotel made our trip really special.  We repeated the trip this year staying for four nights last week. They say you should never go back as you will be disappointed and we were. The hotel seems to have lost its shine.  The lobby looks tired, queues at reception and in the bar.  Room was similar to last time but bed nowhere near as comfortable for some reason, no bath robes or slippers, no water, no spoon for the tea / coffee, desk light broken, plus bathroom with bidet instead of separate shower as we had last time, pity.  Shower over the bath but the bath was quite dangerous getting in and out, could do with another handle and bath mat.  On our first day we returned to the room at 4pm and it hadn't been cleaned, rang housekeeping who said they would send someone straight away but it was over an hour later before someone did the room, we were waiting for clean towels to have a shower before dinner, not enough cleaning staff obviously.  We took early breakfasts when going to the GP but the last morning when we decided to have a leisurely breakfast before checking out it was packed and we were waiting for food to be replenished.  One of the bar staff was there from last time and he was very attentive but when he wasn't there we were waiting to be served frequently.  Drinks expensive, we ate in the bar a couple of nights, food was reasonable but for other meals we went to the restaurants opposite in the Mall.  We didn't use the mini bar in the room other than to store sandwiches for our trip to the GP but we must have touched a can of beer slightly when putting our food in and it was on the final bill.  To be fair the receptionist took it off straight away without question.  The area around the hotel looked run down compared to last time, probably down to the economic climate.  A shame but it we won't be going back for a third time.",3,2013,05,17
36,Staff take great care of you here!,"My husband and I stayed at this property before and after our cruise in April 2013.  We were so happy with our choice.  We felt well taken care of by the staff...they all spoke English and didn't mind helping us with our many questions.  The bell staff were awesome, holding our luggage for us and giving the cab drivers directions on where we needed to go.  The room itself was very nicely appointed with a beautiful bathroom....and the room was very quiet!  The hotel is across the street from a large mall with several restaurants and shops, so you walk right over for other dining options.  The ""hop on/off"" bus has a stop right down the street from the hotel as well so we found this to be an alternative option to some of the more pricey hotels along Las Ramblas.  Overall, we enjoyed our short stays here.",5,2013,05,17
36,Great Hotel,"Very much enjoyed my stay at this hotel, staff were very helpful, room was spacious and clean, and the Breakfast had an extensive selection. One negative was that drinks were slightly over priced as I felt €5 for a bottle of water was very expensive. The city centre is a 15-20 minute taxi ride or a short Metro journey, the Metro is a 7-10 minute walk from the hotel. The hotel is located near to the beach and across the road from a large shopping centre. Overall I liked the hotel and would return.",5,2013,05,16
36,Very good stay,"I stayed together with my partner and our youngest daughter for 5 nights in the beginning of May. I found the location good with a galleria and the beach nearby. Taxi or Metro will easily take you Down Town Barcelona. Remember to say Hilton Diagonal Mar to the taxi driver from the Airport as the Hilton Barcelona is also on Diagonal.

We had pleasant stay on the top floor. Good Service in the Executive lounge where the terraces really added value. Plenty of Tourists from the US and Canada in the hotel and they must be the nr 1 Tourists in the World. Always friendly!

On the negative side the pool would have needed some heating as it was in the beginning of the summer season and at the time there was a fun park down by the beach that was noisy until 1am during the weekend. As comment by many, too expensive internet unless you are a Diamond member or in the lobby zone where it is free. The Mini bar is also expensive but good with some free space for the guests in the refrigerator. Besides this a perfect stay and the Hilton Diagonal Mar will not disappoint you.",5,2013,05,15
36,"If you are going for business or beach , great hotel.","I stayed at this hotel for a day of business and a day of pleasure. It is a very good business hotel in ""New Barcelona"". Beds were comfortable. Staff was great. Large hotel will all the usual Hilton amenities. 

If you are going for pleasure then I would not recommend  since it is a bit away from the sights like the Sagrada Familia and the other Gaudi sights. ",4,2013,05,11
36,Standard Hilton - Very disappointing,"Room with a view of sea, in reality a sea view between two buildings. Rooms are standard Hilton design not worth the high price. 
Hotel is 10mins taxi to Barcelona, so not great location if site seeing. 
Food was very poor - burnt and swimming in grease. 
Wifi is charged at EUR 25 for 24hrs. No free wifi in public spaces. 

",3,2013,05,11
36,Barcelona Hilton Diagonal,"Wonderful hotel. Staff was very friendly and helpful. It is near the coast and only a short metro ride to the city center. Rooms are modern and nice. Beds are very comfortable. And the views from the rooms are amazing, especially at night. If you like to shop, there is a large mall right across the street. I would definitely stay here again.",5,2013,05,08
36,Wanted heater water swimming pool,"Unlike other hotels located in downtown, this hotel has advantage in various aspects. Very close to beach, net to the shopping mall, wider space. Everything was good except for the swimming pool. For this class of hotel, it should have heated water.",4,2013,05,07
36,Great conference facilities,"Fantastic conference facilities and 1st class accomodation, well positioned for easy access to downtown and barely 20 minutes (Euro 25) cab ride from the airport.
Bar costs pretty pricey, however local bars and restaurants are nearby.",4,2013,05,07
36,Excellent place to stay!,"I had the privilege of staying at the Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona for 12 nights, though only 6 were originally planned.

It is a beautiful hotel and the staff are all excellent. English is not a problem at all.

I stayed in room 2112, overlooking the ocean. The room was nicely appointed and had a hardwood (Pergo) floor, instead of carpet. It made it feel a lot cleaner.

The only thing I did not like about the room, is that there was no drawer space.

The bathroom was well-kitted, including a bidet, tub and shower.

The amenities were standard Hilton-fare, but did not include mouthwash.

A small ice machine could be found by the elevators, and it always worked, but after the first 3 days, housekeeping did not replace the plastic bag in the ice bucket.

Housekeeping kept the room very clean, but a few times, essential items like face cloths, were not replaced. There was only a standard of two towels in this king room. We ordered extra towels and they were promptly delivered.

Unfortunately, we had a medical emergency on the 3rd day. My partner had to be admitted to hospital for a serious illness.

We had no idea what to do, so went down to the Executive Lounge on the 15th floor, and explained our situation. Before we got to the lobby, everyone had been informed, a nearby hospital (Hospital del Mar) was suggested and a taxi was waiting (they asked if we needed an ambulance - we did not). 

I felt like I was family to these kind people. They all went above and beyond their call of duty.

As my partner was in hospital, I had to extend my reservations twice, not knowing his release date. Even though the hotel was full, I was able to keep my room and extend my stay, thanks to the wonderful Front Desk Manager.

For fellow travellers, this hotel is in a new part of Barcelona, but it is very well situated. The Diagonal Mar Mall is literally across the street and is reported to be the largest in Barcelona. There is a grocery store, many boutiques, several fast-food places and a great bowling alley and games place.

As for transportation, there is the Forum Metro station, just about 7 minutes walk from the front door.

Overall, I would highly recommend this establishment to any traveller who wants to stay in Barcelona and be close to shopping, transportation and be taken care of by the best staff.

We will definitely be returning to this place to finish off where we left off.

My partner has made a full recovery, thanks in part to the excellent health care system in Spain. Just remember to have a lot of headroom on your credit card.

Thanks everyone!

Carl",5,2013,05,04
36,"Great Staff, not in the center but still convenient","The hotel is by the beach ( no direct access there is a highway in between) it is a 12 Euro ride by taxi from the center. It is possible to walk all the way along the beach but that would take around 45 Minutes.  The rooms are up to date and big enough, No upgrade or club access offered as Hilton Gold Member even the hotel was far from full. We paid 30 Euro/night more for club access and it was worth it ( breakfast and tapas/ drink selection in the evening was very good). For a first time visit in Barcelona I would recommend to stay closer to the center, if you've already been and looking for a relaxed stay it is a great place. All the staff was really friendly and helpful. I booked a sea view room and it was indeed a nice view, there is a luna park just in front of the hotel and the music is very loud till midnight 1 am .( obviously not hotels fault but annoying without earplug)",4,2013,05,03
36,Helpful Hilton,"They were, it was, I liked it. If this review needs 200 characters then many of them work at the diagonal. A really, happy, helpful bunch that made my business stay a real pleasure. Even when faced with the usual printer meltdown they tried and tried to sort out what was technically impossible",5,2013,05,03
36,Pleasant short stay for business,"I recently stayed here for a 3 day business conference that was also being held within the hotel.  The hotel staff were all friendly, particularly the bar and restuarant staff.  The hotel was clean, tidy and quiet and it felt like it was well run.  The room was as expected in terms of the usual ammenities - everything worked and there were no suprises - which is what you need on trips like these.  The food in the main restaurant was surprisingly good considering it was buffet.  Everything was fresh, tasted great and there was a lot of variety so even after three days I wasn't bored with the cuisine.  The meeting rooms were all fine and fit for purpose.  All in all, a very pleasant stay and I would recommend it for a business traveller.",4,2013,04,29
36,Barcelona Hotel not to miss,"Fantastic hotel in a beautiful city. Very buzzing and active in a friendly atmosphere. A combination hard to find. Standards are very high and quality of service is excellent. Efficient professional staff that attend to all your needs. 
I was attending a conference with many delegates staying in the hotel. The standards never slipped down.
Highly recommended",5,2013,04,27
36,Lovely hotel sometimes ruined by the staff,"The hotel is beautiful. Great location next to the beach and not to far from the metro station. There's a massive shopping centre close to it. 

The rooms are very nice however in the first room we got put into the TV didn't work properly and the socket in the bathroom had been pulled out of the wall and was left hanging.

We got moved to another room facing the sea in the corner of the hotel which we really enjoyed. It had a shower and a bath. 

Unfortunately che check in experience wasn't great. A south american girl with curly hair was unhelpful and rude. Interrupted us while we were speaking and was unable to reccommend a decent restaurant.

Breakfast was nice and the staff was better than the ones at reception. 

Finaly found a decent local guy who explained us how to get to Camp nou and gave us some ideas as to where to eat. Shame i didn't ask for his name.

What was astonishing is that after thinking the staff was not up the hotel we were very nicely surprised. During our stay it was my parterns birthday. Even though we didn't mention it they took the details from the passport so on the day we got a complimentary bottle of cava and a little dessert sent up to the room. That was an extremely nice unexpected surprise and i'm grateful for that.",4,2013,04,22
36,Great place to stay in Barcelona,"We've just returned from a short break in Barcelona, staying at the Hilton Diagonal Mar.

A terrific hotel, well up to 5 star standards with very friendly and professional staff. Our room didn't have sea views sadly but we did have spectacular views over the city instead. The room was clean and very comfortable and we both enjoyed really good night's sleep.

On our last night we ate in the hotel restaurant and enjoyed a really nice meal together with very good service.

The hotel location meant we had only a 5 minute stroll to the beach, and the reception staff gave us great advice on travelling to the city centre by local bus and good value multi- journey tickets.

I would recommend the Diagonal Mar, and we will certainly return.",5,2013,04,20
36,Well up to Hilton 5 Star Standards,"Following some recent ill health combined with the abysmal and depressing English weather decided I needed a break. My 4 night stay at the Hilton Diagonal Mar in Barcelona was just the tonic needed.Most fortunate to be upgraded to an executive room, which was just next door to the elegant Executive Lounge. The Exec.lounge provides free breakfast, free nibbles and refreshments throughout the day and free drinks from 6 to 8.30. There is also a large open air terrace  with some great views  Staff are attentive, friendly and professional. I dined in the Indigo Restaurant most nights which has an excellent menu and comprehensive wine list, all at most reasonable prices for a five star hotel.",5,2013,04,19
36,Typical high-class business / conference hotel,"This hotel is a part of a large hotel and conference center compex located on the outskirts of the city - where Av. Diagonal meets the sea. As you can expect from Hilton chain the room was big and comfortable and the breakfast was indeed superb. The downside: I think that 25Eur  (or was it 35?) for 24h WiFi access today is simply absurd. The swimming pool is located on the 2nd floor roof and it was still closed in mid-April due to ""winter season"". I am not sure what are the requirements for a 4* hotel, but I think that an all-season swimming pool is a must(?). You must also bear in mind that this hotel is relatively far away from the city center: it's about 10 subway stops from Plz Catalunya or an hour walk on the sea-side :-) (BTW: a small advice: if you decide to take the subway to Catalunya, don't bother to change from L4 to L1 on Urquinaona station, it takes less time simply to walk to Catalunya from Urquinaona !). 

to summarize: uou will probably visit this hotel when attending a conference; when traveling simply for leisure and/or sighseeing I think a hotel with better price/performance/location can be easily found in beautiful Barcelona.",4,2013,04,14
36,Hilton never disappoints,"Centrally placed with usual Hilton features ie.tidy yet snug rooms .good service as regards room service and the servicing of rooms.comfortable beds .
Shopping mall across the street.
Close to port and very convenient for cruise ship transfers",4,2013,04,14
36,Very Good,"We stayed at this hotel over Easter.  The hotel is excellent if you are after a break from citybreaks as you can stroll into the centre of Barcelona (about an hour beachfront walk with a short stop at a beach bar) or enjoy the outstanding beach which is a stones throw from the hotel.  The housekeeping in the hotel was exceptional and we returned every evening to find all our toiletries which we had originally dumped, beautifully laid out in the bathroom.  We had a room on the Executive Level which we were upgraded to as we are Diamond Hilton Honors members and the corner room had (as previously mentioned) splendid views of both the city and beach.  A downside to the hotel was Executive Lounge opening hours which at the weekend opened until 10.30am for breakfast and didn't open again until 5.00pm and then closed promptly at 8.00pm (with happy hour from 6.00pm-8.00pm) which we found quite frustrating.  Although the TV was technologically the latest model it only provided a couple of English speaking American channels - not even BBC World News!  There was no ability to hire films or play DVDs - so take a book!  Overall it was a great hotel.",4,2013,04,12
36,"what a city, what a view, and what a hotel!","What a grand hotel!  My husband and I enjoyed it so much we cancelled a stay that we had booked at another hotel for a later trip and came back to the HIlton Diagonal Mar.  The hotel is all that one would expect - beautiful furnishings, lovely pool, deck and poolside bar, very comfortable rooms with a comfy bed and beautiful bathroom.  We were on one of the top floors with a wall of windows facing the sea - breathtaking!  We thoroughly enjoyed the nicely appointed breakfast and complimentary cocktails and hors de'orves in the afternoon.   
The hotel location couldn't be better- just a short stroll to the beach, nice restaurants and shopping across the street, and a hop/on bus stop just down the block.  The service was more than helpful and friendly.  If you are heading to Barcelona, this is the place to stay.",5,2013,04,11
36,Wonderful,"Very good location, near the sea and a wonderfull room view from 18 floor,  exelent staff very clean hotel, and near a comercial center with many different shop and restaurants...............................",5,2013,04,09
36,Ideal location to explore the city,"The Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona is very well located in a quiet area, within 5 minutes walking distance to the Metro station.  I love Barcelona and I found this hotel to be the ideal place to relax after a long day of walking through the city. Every time you stepped into the hotel, you could feel you were entering a hotel with a very high standard. Lobby is in pristine conditions, staff looks very proud to work there and they are very friendly and the room was fantastic, very modern and comfortable. I will recommend this hotel to all my friends and family who are looking for the perfect place to stay in Barcelona. Oh and Barcelona is wonderful!! :)",5,2013,04,08
36,Great hotel,"We loved it. Why? The staff in general, Cecilia in particular. At check in, we did not like the room that was first assigned to us and requested another room. Cecilia at the front desk was more than helpful and assigned us a corner room on the 22nd floor
 with stunning views of the City, we even had a view from the bathroom. The rooms are very nice  appointed and very comfy beds. We strongly recommend rooms in the executive floors even thought there more expensive, the expense is well worth it. Be aware that some lower floor rooms might have the view blocked by close by windows. The executive lounge on the 15th floor has an excellent breakfast: scrambled eggs, hash browns, bacon, sausages, cold cuts and very good espressos. In the evening : wine and hard liquor along with tapas makes it a great way to relax before dinner. Will we recommend this hotel........you bet we will.",5,2013,04,05
36,Hilton Barcelona Diagonal,Location is very good. Hotel is clean and generally well equiped.  I would not recommend to go to Barcelona over religious days ie Easter as all shopping malls / shops are mostly closed. Only bars and restaurants are open.  Also Hotel pools are closed from Sept to April.,4,2013,04,04
36,Less than Impressed,"I want to be fair as I am not one to write reviews but would like to set some expectations in regards to this Hotel. First and foremost it does offer a beautiful view of the water but is very far from the square and historic sites of Barcelona. It was referred to as the new city by the bartender and our taxi driver and indeed it is. Everything is ultramodern except the customer service.
 The reception desk was flat out rude and ignored our request to check in at the Exceutive lounge upon our arrival as instructed by emails from the hotel. We were using points plus cash rewards and were told that we would need to pay an additional fee upon our arrival for the twin bed for our daughter. Wait , are we not using points and already paying a fee ?
The hotel is across from a mall and that is the only atrraction in the area. I think they cater to a business travler and not someone there for a holiday. No turn down service or leaving the lounge with a wine glass to enjoy in your room . We were ask to place our wine in a styrafoam cup! Ok if at the Holiday Inn but not standard for a four star hotel! I would choose something closer to the square and be sure that they apprecaite those travlers redeeming well earned loyalty points. Enjoy Barcelona!",2,2013,03,31
36,"Good hotel, exceptional service, interesting location","My excellent rating for this property is mostly based on service. The property itself is also fairly good, probably deserving 4/5.

What I liked:  The staff, the staff and the staff!  Very friendly and efficient check-in and helpful staff in the executive lounge.  What was really exceptional though was the friendliness of the staff in the restaurant.  As a solo traveller, they really made sure I would not get bored and even helped me with sightseeing, providing useful tips on Barcelona and walking me through the city map - something you might expect from front desk staff, but not wait staff at the restaurant. Speaking of the restaurant, this was another highlight of this place.  Relatively speaking, it is fair value and the food extremely good.  I know you don't go to Barcelona to eat a Club Sandwich, but they had the best presented and best tasting club I have ever had.  On the 2nd night, I had a steak which was also very good and well prepared.  There is some ""local"" offering on the menu, but it mostly felt like an American-style menu and I personally like to see more local cuisine on hotel menus.  Location of the hotel is also interesting.  It is not downtown so for those in Barcelona primarily for sightseeing, you do need to hop on the tram or metro which is less than 5 minutes away from the hotel.  For those into shopping, the hotel is in front of the Diagonal Mar shopping complex which has a couple of nice shops and a lot of casual dining options. I was provided with a room on the executive floor.  the room was decent in size and everything was well maintained.  Bathroom size was also quite good.  I had a view of the ocean and the ""beach"" area nearby. As a Diamond member with Hilton, I was provided with complimentary internet, which worked fine for the duration of the stay. Very modern hotel. Nice, open lobby area

What could be improved: Not much - I found the food offering in the executive lounge to be standard and simplistic and quality could have been one notch higher.  Also, although I quite liked the room, the floors (wood-style) are starting to show some signs of aging. The room did not look nor feel dated, but it could probably use a rejuvenation program in the near future. finally, given that it was low season, I was expecting the rate to be somewhat lower.  From a value perspective, it is fair, but not great",5,2013,03,29
36,Fabulous Hotel,A huge Reccomendation for this hotel. The staff is what makes this place stand out. Everyone is super helpful and friendly and smiling. Congradulations to the management and team. A special thanks to the team in the Executive Lounge. they go the extra mile to do anything for you and make you feel very welcome. I stayed for 5 nights with our kids and they did not want to leave. Awesome views of beach from lounge. metro just across the street to city center and really nice running along the beach.  We will stay there again and again when we go back to barcelona.,5,2013,03,28
36,Excellent hotel for a Barcelona break,"We had a wonderful stay at Hilton Diagonal Mar. Warm welcome & a great place to stay. As Hilton Gold members they made it special for us. Beautiful accomodation, comfortable beds + beach & city views. We also had access to the Executive Lounge with a fantastic terrace to enjoy panoramic views. Hotel staff spoke excellent English & were so helpful especially Biagio & Filipe in the Indido Restaurant.
Diagonal Mar Shopping Centre across the road has good restaurants, shops & large supermarket to cover all needs. 
We look forward to our next stay.",5,2013,03,27
36,Beautiful Hotel,"Wonderful hotel and very friendly and inviting staff.  Everybody was friendly and seemed genuinely concerned for our comfort.

We stayed in Barcelona one night after finishing a cruise.  When we arrived at the hotel, didn't expect them to have any rooms as we checked in at 0900.  They weren't busy and immediately put us into rooms.  The rooms were exceptionally clean and spacious. 

The breakfast was mainly continental European, but there was some ""Asian"" influence to their offerings.  They had rice and a type of miso soup.

If you care to venture from the hotel, across the street is a large mall with several restaurants.  Additionally there are many activities and rides for children to enjoy. The train stop to take you to central Barcelona is about a 10-15 minute walk away. The HopON/HopOff tour bus also runs by the hotel, but only during the warm season.

We will definitely come back and stay here.",5,2013,03,26
36,Great sea views worth a stay,"Stayed for two nights whilst visiting the area.

It is out of town a little, but close to the Metro, so the city centre is easily reached.

The reception staff were excellent, especially Eric.

The rooms were very good with good amenities and facilities.

The executive lounge was good overall, but shorter opening hours at the weekend, and the presence of only pay as you use computers lwt it down for tourists.

Breakfast gave a very good selection buffet.

Would stay again, and would recommend.",4,2013,03,23
36,Clean hotel outside of city center,My wife and I stayed at the Hilton Diagonal Mar on recent holiday in Barcelona.  The hotel is located outside of city center.  You will need to take Metro or Cab into city center.  The Metro is very close to the hotel.  There is also large shopping center next to hotel with multiple restaurants.  Our room was very nice and clean.  The service was great.  The executive lounge has large outdoor patio and great food primarily at breakfast.  Very solid Hilton property that I would stay at again if I was fortunate enough to visit Barcelona.,4,2013,03,22
36,Wonderful hotel and Great staff !!,"A few weeks ago, friends asked me to join them on a short trip to Barcelona.  They were on business and would be staying a few minutes from La Ramblas area.  I booked a ticket and booked a room in their hotel.  Although when traveling to Barcelona, I stay in the hills at the La Florida hotel, I was quite impressed with this hotel!!

For starters, the taxi fare from BCN is no more than 30Euros.  The location of the hotel is nice and quiet with the underground train station just 2 blocks away. 

The hotel itself is lovely!!  The staff is amazing...very polite, friendly (as most people in Barcelona are!!), helpful and knowledgeable!!  After checking in (quite early, I must say) I proceeded to the bar area which is located in the middle of a modern, yet elegant, lobby.  Ordering a coffee and a sweet roll...the bartender was delightful...considering this was early in the morning!

The room was not what I expected for a European hotel in the heart of a city.  It was extremely spacious: Two double beds in a room with a city view.  The bed was firm, yet comfortable with a very cozy warm duvet.  The bathroom was modern and large with a rainfall shower head...absolute heaven after a long flight from JFK !!  The amenities were perfect: The usual water kettle with coffees and teas ( Considering most in-room coffee is not that tasty, this was rather pleasant); American style hairdryer; and, as my friend only needed a comb, the staff brought up a full ""amenity"" kit.

I was immediately taken with this hotel and have already booked it for a post-cruise stay with several friends in June (although the price is quite higher for that time of year!)",4,2013,03,21
36,Solid Hilton property - a few minor hiccups but overall solid,"The front desk has to reissue an Internet password to me for 3 times before it was working - however I do appreciate the flexibility they offer in allowing me to check in at 10:30am, which is consider an early check-in even as a diamond member...

The lounge has an amazing view, the hours are a little disappointing....they close for cleaning from 11 to...can't remember, maybe 12?  which is kinda odd.  The lounge close at 10pm on weekday and 8pm on weekend....which can be an inconvenience to some (including myself traveling with a baby)

Would I stay here again?  Sure - if the price is right.   Transportation is convenience: 5 to 10 minute walk to line 4 that connects you to major tourist attraction - there is a huge shopping mall with a multi floor supermarket where you can get everything you need literally right across the street.",4,2013,03,19
36,Great hotel with great service - a little far from the city centre,"This is a lovely hotel - everything you would expect from a Hilton. 

Rooms are spacious with a very comfortable bed. Amenities in the room were good; the hairdryers are proper hairdryers, not the ones that are permanently stuck to the wall which is always a nice touch! The mini bar is well stocked with a variety of snacks and drinks (soft drinks and alcoholic).

The bathroom is lovely and also very spacious with a heated mirror so you don't have to wait an age to use it after a shower. The shower is a separate section to the bath. The shower gels and shampoos are excellent here, I usually always use my own but these were lovely!

Breakfast is superb with a wide choice of cooked and continental dishes. There is also an omelette chef on hand to provide a tailor made breakfast option for you.

The staff are also really lovely, helpful and approachable. They will attempt to assist you with any of your needs and are always so polite and friendly!

The only downside is the location which most people have mentioned. It isn't in the city centre. There is a large shopping centre (Diagonal Mar) located opposite the hotel which is handy, lots of shops and restaurants here.

The Gothic District is approximately a 10 minute taxi ride away (be careful here as there are lots of pickpockets but some beautiful buildings, restaurants and bars) and the Sagrada Familia is also about the same. Taxis cost around 10-15€.

Tip if you would like to see the major tourist sites in Barcelona - use the Bus Touristic, you can buy a pass from the hotel for 4€ and then pay 20€ on the bus (adult prices for individuals, prices differ for children and groups). You can hop on and off as many times as you like during the day and there are 3 routes you can take depending on what you would like to see. Excellent way to see all the sites of this beautiful city!",5,2013,03,17
36,Suprisingly good!,"This hotel is a gem - everything is nice, from the well designed rooms, stunning view, distance from the hustle and bustle of the Rambla to the excelllent food. Staff was helpful and nice. The only real downside is the price of Wi-fi which is way too high for modern times. But then again, the lobby has free wi-fi access and while you're there reading your email you might just make new friends from the other 50 people doing the same thing at the same time as you.",4,2013,03,17
36,Magnificent facilities,"Very impressed by the executive lounge and staff.  Very attentive and great at anticipating your needs.  The front desk staff and the concierge are also very helpful.  The facilities are spotless and bright.  Great views of the mediterranean on the top floors.  Great for a relaxing escape from routine, or after a tiring trip.",5,2013,03,16
36,"Nice Hotel, bad service","This was a nice hotel, what you would expect from a Hilton.  Standard rooms, clean etc.  The bar staff were friendly.  My biggest gripe and the reason for the poor rating was that I lost a ring when I stayed there.  Luckily and amazingly, the hotel found it!  I was thrilled to be getting back a much loved piece of jewellery and anxiously waited its return.  What I didn't anticipate is that the person who sent the ring, wrote my address on a standard envelope and put the ring in - no jiffy bag, no padding, nothing to disguise the shape of the ring.  I received the envelope but unsurprisingly it was empty, there was just a hole where the ring had been removed.  There was no note inside - literally just an envelope.  I emailed the hotel and after a few days, I received an 'oops, we're sorry nothing we can do email!'  Obviously I am really disappointed that a hotel like Hilton didn't take better care and gutted that I lost my ring.",2,2013,03,15
36,Wonderful end to our trip,"My husband and I rented a car in Barcelona and travelled to Bordeaux, France where we rented an apartment for a week.  We spent the week exploring the little towns and vineyards around Bordeaux which was romantic and breathtaking.  Leaving Bordeaux, we drove through the Pyrenees on our way back to Barcelona.  Our last 2 nights were spent at the Barcelona Hilton which was an excellent end to an awesome trip.  The room had a king sized bed and plenty of room with a table and comfortable chairs.  The bedding was first class and the bathroom had plenty of amenities.  We used the executive lounge which had a full breakfast and various appetizers in the evening,  The hotel was located near the metro and also across the street from a mall.  If you have a chance, visit the sporting store, Decathon, at the mall.  We will definitely stay at the Barcelona Hilton again.",5,2013,03,14
36,Hilton the best,"..nice hotel for barcelona, the only problem is faraway from center, breakfest is very good and gives you a lot of options ,in front of diagonal mall,quiet and clean rooms,there is free wifi in the public areas.",5,2013,03,13
36,Perfect,"Stayed here is summer 2012. The hotel is in excellent condition, great executive lounge up on a high floor. Nice food served with a nice selection of drinks. The facilities are great, modern an clean. The room was in excellent condition with nice furniture and comfortable beds. Free Wi-Fi would have been nice as the daily rate was expensive. Friendly and helpful staff. Will be back on my return to Barca. Thanks.",5,2013,03,12
36,perfect,"nice hotel for barcelona,

we didnt like wifw becasu its expensive
breakfest is very good,
ailece gidilecek güzel bir otel
şehire uzak olması dezavantaj",4,2013,03,10
36,"Comfortable, convenient and practical","The first attraction to chose this hotel is the sea view and the sea itself. The hotel is very close to the beach and is ideally located for a comfortable and peaceful stay. I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights during the Mobile World Congress and found it to be extremely convenient and practical. It has sea on one side and Diagonal Mar shopping mall on the other. It is in walking distance of Metro and Tram station and well connected to the entire Barcelona via the convenient transport options. 

The rooms are well appointed and clean, although its not extra-ordinarily great. The only surprise was to see a small Gymnasium although it used to be barely frequented by guests. All in all, a convenient, practical and comfortable package.",4,2013,03,10
36,"Corporate hotel, ideal for conference centre","I stayed here recently for 3 nights whilst attending a conference at the nearby conference centre.
Positives : excellent staff, all v friendly and helpful. Superb breakfast, lots of choice. Spacious rooms, lovely toiletries.

Negatives : my non-smoking room smelt of smoke. The gym is tiny with many of the machines out of order. No free wifi in bedrooms.

I would recommend this hotel for business users but if you're on holiday I'm sure there are nicer hotels closer to the main attractions in Barcelona.",4,2013,03,08
36,Business stay during MWC,"There was a booking problem in the original hotel I was due to stay at. the Hilton was contacted and they could not have been more welcoming and efficient. The room was very clean and large. he only niggle was that there is no access to real fresh air. the air con was working but did not get the room temperature down to the level I like.

This is a better than average Hilton Hotel and is situated very close to the sea and right opposite a large underground shopping complex. So if you don't want hotel food there are more restaurants over there catering for just about every taste.

Journey into Barcelona central takes about 15 minutes by taxi. 

Although I did not have a problem, central Barcelona is rife with pickpockets, especially on La Rambla.",4,2013,03,08
36,"Beautiful hotel, a bit far from city center","Hilton Diagonal Mar is a very beautiful new hotel with a very good location on the sea. I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights along with my wife and 9 year old son. We were appointed room number 2208 which was really spacious and nice with sea view. We were in Barcelona for a vacation and to attend a football match between barca and Real Madrid . The hotel is far from city center but if you don't mind, there is a metro station nearby which you can use to reach the city center n 15-20 minutes, and if you have never used the metro in Barcelona , I can tell you it is very nice and convenient. In front of the hotel there is a big shopping mall which is a plus for the hotel. The staff are very helpful and want to do everything possible to meet your needs. Breakfast is great aith big variety of food. I will recommend this hotel for anyone likes good size rooms with luxury even if it is away from the city center.",4,2013,03,03
36,"Nice, but a bit out of the way","Myself and my husband stayed her for a few days in May 12.  On check in I wasn't happy with the room we were allocated and the front desk team were wonderful in finding us a better room.

The hotel is new, nice, and pleasant. No complaints at all about accommodation.

It was a bit far out for us, in regards to the sight seeing trail, but also near to metro and blue sightseeing bus, so not awkard to reach, just a bit far.  To be fair if the weather had of been better we may not have minded spending more time at the beach!,

My only real issue was with the food, we are vegan, but I did email weeks ahead to advise and ask if they could organize a nice meal for my husbands birthday. I even sent on a recipe for a vegan cake. I was assured this would be no problem.

So, it looks like the person who assured me was away on the week we arrived and didn't pass on the instructions., but we were told its not a problem at all.  In short the worst and most expensive meal we had in Barcelona over the entire week we were there, we did get a cake the day after and a bottle of prosecco,, which was a nice gesture, but really once the moment is gone it is gone... I did say to them if nothing was organized, please just tell me, I would have rather just gone out and had a nice meal at anyone of the 10 vegan friendly restaurants in Barcelona rather than what we had.
The only other small thing was, one of the girls on reception we spoke to, in trying to find out if the meal was organized,  gave the always great response of ... Oh.. vegan.. very difficult with a roll of the eyes... as I said.. Barcelona has no shortage of good vegan eateries.. so I am fairly confident we were not the only ones to ever go there.. and even so.. no need for the eye roll!",3,2013,02,26
36,New property well located,"The location of the property is ideal. The beach front is just next to the hotel and shopping centre across the road. Ideal for leisure stays. They have in summer the tourist busses, hop-on and off that pass nearby, allowing you to visit the city throughout on a daily or multiple-day fair.
 Useful, for mixing business with leisure a bit far from downtown- however, Taxis are reasonably priced and generally available just next to the hotel entrance). Port Olympic is not far with the casino and many quality restaurants offering local specialties...Over there black rice sea food paella highly recommended, looks odd but tastes great!",4,2013,02,25
36,Strangest Hilton Ever,"Hi
I stayed at Hilton Barcelona recently and opted for a delux category room. Few  hours later i called guest services for drinking water... and on making the request was told ""Let me See"".
When i asked the lady what she meant, she said that only 2 bottles per room are on complimentary basis. I had never said I wanted the water for free. Of course, i would have paid if that was the norm...! The hotels attitude did not end here. The mini bar had no wine glasses, just tumblers. When I called for the wine glasses (2 of them), the waiter demanded 5 Euros for the ""Service"". No receipt was given to me.... Room was poor in amenities. No bath-robes, no slippers etc. Felt as if i was staying in Ibis or similar budget hotel!
No courtesies or help was shown with my bulky baggage upon arrival in the lobby...!
But on the plus side, the breakfast indeed was fantastic.",2,2013,02,25
36,One of the best Hilton hotels,"Stayed for 4 nights and can honestly say this was one of the best Hilton hotels I have ever stayed at.  All of the staff - Reception, Restaurant, Housekeeping were extremely friendly and efficient and nothing was too much trouble.  The Executive Lounge is superb and has excellent views of the city and beach.
The location is ideal - few minutes walk from beach and although is about 50 minutes walk to city centre there is good bus and Metro service, although the walk along the beach front is to be recommended.  Diagonal Mar shopping centre across the road from the hotel is excellent and has many nice restaurants and cafes.
One small gripe - they could have more English speaking channels on the TV !!",5,2013,02,25
36,good business hotel-extortionate wifi,"nice rooms with good bed, lots of different pillows. big bathroom with shower, no tub, but that's ok. great shopping centre and restaurants across the street. only real downside is exhorbitant price of in-room wifi 25 euros for 24 hours-extortion and totally unacceptable in a business hotel. lcated about 10 mins taxi ride from city centre and 30 mins (35 euros)",4,2013,02,23
36,excellent hotel..,"Traveled with a group of 40..

An excellent property in all respects. about 25 mins drive from El Prat airport. The hotel has spacious rooms ( 31 sq mts) and exactly look like the ones profiled on the website .

Large spacious rooms and an inviting lobby set the pace and our 4 days at the hotel were very fulfilling indeed.

The only gripe was that the check in was a bit slow and this could have been faster managed but the hotel was extremely accommodating when dates had to be advanced due to visa issues with our group.

The Indigo restaurant was cozy and comfortable and the breakfast variety was plentiful though they could have varied the menu a bit since most items were repetitive .

The diagonal mar shopping centre was across the street and very handy for a quick bite or shopping with an array of excellent restaurants for Tapas, spanish, fast food.

The drive Ramblas was around 15 mins and cost approx 12 EUR so if you share with colleagues , this is a very reasonable cost. Taxis are easily available.

My only regret is that I could not try the beach which was at close proximity.

If staying bang on in city center is critical, I would recommend hotels in La Ramblas , but if this is not the case , this is indeed a very good choice .

I will return surely for personal, professional reasons ..

Muchas Gracias Hilton Diagonal Mar for an excellent stay!.",5,2013,02,23
36,Awesome views and service,"If you looking for a great upscale and modern European hotel with a touch of American amenities, then look no further. We stayed on the top Executive Level with lounge access. The service was unbelievable and the view from our room included the beach and the La Familia, along with the rest of the city. 

The location is a bit north of the ""action"" if you are looking for the central party district this hotel is not for you. It is a nice and quiet but close to the train station and is right on the sight seeing bus route. It is also right across the street from a major modern shopping mall with restaurants and shops.",5,2013,02,21
36,A wonderful place to stay in Barcelona,"The Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona is a great hotel and quite comfortable for a family as well.  Limitation on 3 per room, the spare beds are comfortable and are easily provided.  The hotel is across the street from a nice beach and a local mall.  Taxi service is easily available with a short walk to the train/cable car services.  A variety of restaurants are available at the mall within easy walking distance.
Overall a wonderful place to stay with good amenities.",4,2013,02,14
36,Great Hotel-Great Staff,"Stayed at the Hilton Diagonal Mar before and after our cruise.  Bilingual and professional staff, clean room and everything that you expect from Hilton.  I am a proud Hilton Honors member and I have not yet been dissapointed.  My husband and I celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary to complementary champagne and sweets.  The staff surprised us while we were out for a walk to Las Ramblas. Everything is close by and taxis are parked right out front.  Oscar was very helpful giving us directions and teaching us about the local customs.  Overall, an amazing experience that I will never forget. Thank you everyone! Jason and Jacqueline Hauck- USA",5,2013,02,08
36,Near beach,This hotel is near the beach but not so near La Rambla. But it´s easy to go there by the metro. The service was fantastic and executive lounge was something. From the terrace you had a magnificent view over the beach and the sea. The evening snacks were very impressive. A large selection of hot and cold foods and beverages.,4,2013,02,07
36,Comfort on the beach,"This was a great experience. All was great, especially the included breakfast at Indigo restaurant and the very kind employees. I arrived at 11:20am for breakfast one day and they brought me anything I wanted to my table - not even asking my room number. That is hospitality. ",5,2013,02,06
36,Excellent!,"One of the best hotels I have ever stayed in, everything was so comfortable, from the bed to the whole dining experience.  Staff are extremely attentive and polite.  Excellent hotel, very clean, good location, amazing views over the City. Highly recommended way above standards!",5,2013,02,05
36,"Great location, fabulous hotel","The hotel is about a 20-30 minutes from the airport (25-30 euros). The lobby is a little lop sided and the check in desk was a small area in one corner. The people were so helpful and even though they were busy making changes was ever so easy.  The room was functional and modernly decorated.  The wi-fi was fast and free for HHonors level.

The executive lounge was staffed by knowledgable and pleasant staff. The terrace had a great view over the sea was memorable. The breakfast was substantial and varied.  In the afternoon small cakes and cookies were available and the espresso was lovely.  The evening snacks were very impressive. A large selection of hot and cold foods (every day a different choice).  The drink selection was huge and drinking a glass of wine on the terrace overlooking the sea at sunset was priceless.
Th outdoor pool was cool and refreshing and a real deep blue!
The hotel was a 5minute walk from the metro and easy access to the city.  In addition, the hotel was 5 minute walk from the beautiful beach and the sea was clean and warm.
A great choice for families.",5,2013,02,03
36,"Comfortable hotel, great service","I have stayed here twice,,each time I have been given a corner, king size room, which is spacious and comfortable. The food, at a congress, is good, and the service is excellent. It is a 4 minute walk to the beach, but not close to the centre.",4,2013,02,02
36,"Great hotel, value for money and staff","This property is a great hotel in Europe with large rooms, friendly and helpful staff, great pillows and bed, excellent food and a good value for the money. It's also located across the street from a large mall and only a couple of blocks from the beach. The sangria in the bar is exceptional and huge!  Very nice breakfast buffet, too. .",4,2013,01,31
36,Lovely hotel for a weekend break,"I stayed here for 2 nights in January.  The hotel and bedroom was very clean and modern.
We had a twin room on the 18th floor with a sea view which was fantastic.
Whilst the breakfast was good and there was plenty of variety to choose from, I felt that the dining area and the lobby/bar area lacked a little atmosphere.
The staff were great, particularly Marlene who checked us in.  She was very knowledgeable about the city and gave us a map highlighting the areas to go and pointed out which Metro stations to use.
A few reviewers have mentioned the distance from the city centre - we didn't find this to be an issue at all.  The area was fairly quiet but was right across the road from a large shopping centre, the beach, and only a few minutes walk from the nearest Metro station so heading into the city was was easy (tip: buy a T10 Metro ticket for less than 10 euros and this should be enough to get you to all of the tourist attractions around the city over a weekend).
We didn't get to see all of the sites in Barcelona so we are planning to go back again in a few months and would return to this hotel.",4,2013,01,28
36,Very satisfactory stay,I stayed at the Hilton Diagonal Mar 3 nights in January for business. I had a very enjoyable stay. Everything was clean and functioning and the staff were very pleasant and helpfull. The facilities are up to date and do not look old or worn.The area is quiet although practically close to a mall and the sea.,4,2013,01,27
36,A solid 4* Hilton.,"We spent 3 nights at the hotel.
As HHonors Gold we were upgraded a category up into an Executive room with lounge access (including free WI-FI).
We were fortunate enough to have a very early check-in at 10AM.
Our room (2316 – 23rd floor, just next to the Presidential suite) was on the small side, but totally adequate for 2 persons.
The beds were quite confortable.
The bathroom was rather small with no shower (only a bath tub), a toilet and a bidet.
The bathroom amenities were by Peter Thomas Roth and were absolutely excellent.
The executive lounge was actually on a lower floor than our room and was quite nice. We had numerous soft drinks and nibbles there, plus afternoon snacks and evening bites.
The service at the front desk was adequate, at most. As in many other hotels in Spain, understaffing is common practice.
We had all our breakfasts at the hotel, and while they were a bit hectic, the food was nice (which cannot be said about the single dinner we had at the hotel, which was not good at all – see a separate review).
The hotel granted us a late checkout at 4PM and kept our bags until we returned to pick them up at 7PM and have a quick shower at the tiny gym, just prior to leaving to the airport. It was appreciated.
The location of the hotel is not optimal to say the least – it's very far from the city center, but thankfully, it's just a 5-minute walk from the El Maresme/Forum metro, which is apx. a 20-minute ride from downtown.
The area itself is a very quiet residential area without many attractions.
There's a big mall just across the street from the hotel (with free WI-FI).
Bottom line – this is a solid 4* Hilton, and as long as you don't have too many luxurious expectations you'd probably enjoy this hotel, too.",4,2013,01,25
36,Great service!,"I stayed here for one night while attending a company event. I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the staff : very professional, lots of good recommendations, really service minded. I had a room on the 8th floor (802) overlooking the shopping mall. Room and facilities were really clean, no remarks here. Bathroom really large, which is a plus. A special ""thanks"" to Davide (Bar) , we really enjoyed the level of service he provided. The hotel is located outside of the touristic area, but that is something you know when  you book, and besides it is really easy to get to the main touristic sites. The good thing is you don't get any traffic noise at night...!
Breakfast is awesome : huge choice (buffet) with here, as well , great service by the staff here as well
Clean, quiet,"" design"" hotel I would recommend to stay at !",4,2013,01,24
36,Beach and City and Shopping all in one place,"If you love the City but feel you may be missing out on the Beach then Barcelona and the Hilton Diagonal Mar is the Hotel for you.  You get City Chic Hilton Style, opposite one of the largest Shopping Malls in Barcelona where you can indulge a passion for Shoes or just find a pair that don't kill your feet while you do all the walking you can cope with in the City, that has everything, Art, Food, Culture, History, Beaches etc...
If you can, upgrade to an Executive Room because that way you will get access to the Executive Lounge and the amazing incredible Christobel!  He is your one stop shop for everything you will need to know and do in the City.  He will recommend days out, restaurants, events, things to see and do and book them for you.  He has to win Hilton Employee of the World!  Everyone loves him and nothing but nothing is too much trouble for him to organise for you.  He remembers your name and where you have been during the day and in a busy Exec Lounge that is no mean feat!  He will organise special food and snacks if you have dietary problems and he will deal with anyother concerns you may have - what a guy!
The Hotel is about a 10 minute walk from the busy beach and you have to cross a main road but as with all modern European cities it isn't difficult.  The Beach Bars are great for a snack and a drink and you can walk for miles along the city coast, if, like me, you get really bored just lying on a beach.
There is a fabulous pool at the hotel and if you find the hotel restaurant a tad on the pricey side then there are restaurants within walking distance or catch the bus that stops outside.  I would recommend getting a 3 day tourer ticket from outside the huge main fashion store in the city, all the tour buses run from there.  The Hilton Diagonal Mar (don't get confused with the other Hilton in town), is at the end of the green route and it means you can get back easily and follow the scenic route back to the hotel at the end of a hot and heavy touring day.
To get into the city you need to go out of the hotel and walk through the Shopping Mall to the underground station, it's a bit of a hike but at least you will walk off all the amazing food you will consume while you are in Barcelona.
Talking of food - do not miss the tapas by the Harbour, we ended up there most afternoons for a late lunch watching the Cruise Liners and all the other harbour activity.  The food is fantastic.  We also found the most incredible little restaurant tucked away in the old town on our last night, (unfortunately, I can't for the life of me remember the name of it!!!) in the Gothic Quarter, which opens at 08.30pm and you have to book but I have never in my life had such amazing food (even in Venice which was pretty incredible) for a pittance.  Starters 6 - 8 Euros.  The Maitre D looks at you as if you have emerged from the sewer but don't hold it against him, he runs it like a military operation and although the queues outside (those who didn't book and most won't get a table)all try and pile in everyone is served within 15 mins - truly amazing.   Food to die for and prices that seem unreal for Barcelona.
Do all the touristy things but don't miss out on the most mind blowing Food Market in the world (that includes the Far East, North Africa etc), it is off The Ramblas, if you are walking towards the Harbour area it is half way down off to the right and everyone will direct you there.  It is beyond description but take your Euros and your camera and taste, taste, taste.",4,2013,01,20
36,Enjoyable stay,"We stayed here for 6 nights the beginning of January 2013.  While the location is a bit out from the tourist areas, we found transportation by metro, tram and cab very easy.  The attention by staff was great with many good suggestions and recommendations.  Daniel  in the restaurant Indigo was great as well.  Would stay here again because the location is quiet, but close enough....",5,2013,01,17
36,Find another hotel unless you have to stay here,"I stayed here for 4 nights because of a meeting next door, at the Forum and I am an HHonor member. What a mistake. The location is awful, too far from all tourist attractions. The internet site gives an impression that the hotel is located on a beach. It is NOT, and it does not have an atmosphere of a nice beach resort. Everything surrounding the hotel is rather 'dead', e.g., a tall building next door is empty (abandoned?). The 'largest shopping center' in the city across the street reminded me of a third-tier shopping mall in a large American city, nothing special there. The service at the front desk was awful. It was always crowded and the receptionists were sometime very rude. Breakfast was OK and bed was very comfortable as they are at most other Hilton hotels are. So unless you have meetings next door at the Forum or you have to stay at a hotel that gives you 'American' atmosphere (I don't know why you want that in Spain), don't stay here. I used a credit card to pay the hotel bill and this was the only time I used this card. After I came home, I was contacted by our Bank and they told me that they are sending me a new card and canceling my old card because of a potential compromise. I am not accusing any hotel staff (after all this is a Hilton) but just reporting what happened after my stay at this hotel.",3,2013,01,15
36,Good Value but nothing spectacular,"As i live accross from this hotel, i put some family up here for three days. I did the check in and check out for them and spend some time at the hotel. 

I found staff to be very static and and unatentive. i.e. the checkin desk was unoccupied most of the time. I had to call the bartender over to order drinks and food and i found it anoying to see hotel staff just hang around in the lobby talking to each other instead of occupying their positions. I paid 130/night and got upgraded to executive floor since I'm gold member. Their lounge is pretty nice, breakfast is good, found the snacks to be average. 

Pretty good Sauna on the 2nd floor, with nice swimming pool that I think will be great when it gets warmer here. 

My family said the beds were comfortable and I thought the room was pretty nice. Even though the water ketel was missing.. 

I ordered some food when I was sitting in the lobby, and found the quality mediocere. I had a club sandwhich and the fries were limp and soaking wet. I'd expect more for 17 EUR + tax. 

The hotel is next to a shopping center which is great if you want to get some food from the supermarket etc. It's 10 min from the nearest subway station and cabs are lined up next door. 

Would put some family up here again but found it a little mediocere for Hilton standards. Good value, but nothing to write home about.",3,2013,01,15
36,Nice location away from centre,"We stayed here for 2 nights mid Dec.  I found all the staff very friendly and helpful - reception, restaurant, bar and exec lounge staff.  The room was spacious and was very clean and modern.  Bonus was it faced the sea and was on a high floor.  Had a wonderful 2 nights sleep from great beds - wish I could have taken home with me. 

Food was good, breakfast really nice (both in main restaurant and Exec lounge) and although you can eat more cheaply across the road at the large shopping mall (has a large supermarket if you also want room snacks), we were happy to eat in the hotel.

It not in the centre of Barcelona, but near to buses and the metro.  I know Barca very well, so I just walked everywhere I wanted to go.

I like this location, I really like the staff and love the room space and will return again later in the year.",5,2013,01,11
36,excellent place to stay!,"We, a family of 5 stayed in Barcelona during Christmas Eve and Christmas day in 2012.  We had a wonderful time staying at Hilton Diagonal Mars at Barcelona.  It was a bit off the tourist areas, but with the convenient excess to the Metro and buses, it's worth to stay at this location.  Across the hotel there is a shopping center and a variety of nice restaurants for dining.  The place is also close to the beach.  We traveled many countries in Europe and stayed in many hotels, I have to admit that I still prefer staying in American hotels.  Needless to say, Hilton has the American standards:  the spacious rooms (in comparison to some of the European hotels we've stayed), full amenities, cleanliness, and fluent English speaking front desk staff provided directions and travel tips really helped greatly.  In short, nice rooms and great customer service!  We would stay there again when there is another opportunity to visit Barcelona.",5,2013,01,07
36,Typical Hilton That Takes You For Granted !,"Stayed at this Hilton as part of a package the night before a cruise. 
Typical of every Hilton I have ever stayed at-  The price you pay is how you are treated. Period. 
Our room was facing about 10 floors above  a concert that went on until 1:30am, The concert featured blaring bass and drums. The front desk failed to warn us of this.

When I called the front desk at 11:30am  for a room change, I was told by the very unsympathetic and rude front desk person that I should have booked my room well in advance. I told him, we did, six months in advance! Let's say he was for a loss of words but told me there were no room changes available as the hotel was fully booked but would send up ""ear plugs""!!!!!  When we checked out the next day  I reviewed the situation with the front desk again with a very unsympathetic front desk lady, with no attention span and who really didn't care as our group was leaving and she felt she wouldn't see me again. 

Otherwise, the room was very nice and large based on what we have found in Europe but highly recommend you skip this hotel  based on our treatment, unless you are forced to stay because of a situation as mine, a prepaid group that you have no control over. 

I am sure the hotel will respond to this review and tell me this was a one time occurrence. Right!",3,2013,01,03
36,Great value.....,"is a great hotel, service is excellent... honestly I can say that Spainiars are very friendly and nice people, stay in this hotel twice in the past 3 months and both time they were great from service to cleanliness.... the only draw back is that is around 4 miles from downtown..... however, the second time in was in Spain I booked a closer to town hotel and ended up changing back to this hotel......",5,2013,01,01
36,"Well maintained, consistent service, good food, super comfortable bed.We are satisfied through-out!","We stayed 6 nights at the Hilton during our Barcelona vacation In the end of 2012 until the new year 2013. As HHonor member we were upgraded to the executive room on the high rise floor. The room and bathroom was spacious, with separate shower and bathtub. The wooden floor in the hotel room was quite a surprise as we normally seldom find it in hotel rooms.
Having traveled for business and leisure for the last 15 years, we set our standard high for great accommodation, and Hilton didn't fall short.
The hotel did a good job to make us feel welcome. There is no sight of run-down areas, the breakfast menu albeit didn't change from day to day tasted well and of good quality standard  and sufficiently cater for our appetite for 6 days without grudging from our side. The hotel personnel were friendly and accommodating.
The bed is comfortably on the hard side which I found marvelous and supported good night rest through out the vacation.
The downside perhaps is its far location from the city centre and the tourist attractions. Several metro stops away. This can be annoying if you come over during the winter season when the beach next to the hotel is as of zero value, imo.
Will recommend this hotel.",5,2013,01,01
36,Elegantly Modern High Rise With Great Ocean Views,"Simply put, this is a great Hilton property.  It is modern and clean.  Bathrooms are elegant and large.  Bed is incredibly comfortable.  Views of the ocean are great as well.  The executive lounge has good ocean views and a great terrace.  Only catch is that it is a long cab ride from downtown which is something to consider if you plan on eating in town a lot during your stay.",5,2012,12,29
36,Excellent Base for a Spanish Holiday,"We have just spent 11 days based at the Hilton Diagonal Mar while we explored Barcelona and did a couple of overnight trips to Madrid and Lisbon.
The facilities and staff at the hotel were fanatstic and the service and help we got from the Executive lounge staff was excellent. They were able to recommend places to see in Barcelona and make the required bookings for us and even arranged boarding pass printing for our flights.
On one side trip to Madrid an excellent restaurant recommendation and booking reservation was also made for us and other excellent advice was received durting our stay.
The Hotel is located in the business area of Barcelona a little out of town but with a Barcelona Metro stop only a few minutes walk away it was very easy to travel all around Barcelona at ease on the very efficient Metro system.
A major shopping centre was also directly adjacent that had EFTPOS machines that readily allowed withdrawal of 300 Euro cash at a time when needed. Security guards constatntly patrol the shopping centre and so felt at ease making withdrawals when needed.
Breakfast at the Hotel was excellent and included a special Catalan Foods section in the buffet which we always enjoyed.
The hotel was quiet as we were in off season as was the rest of Barcelona but we found the weather excellent and crowds low so made a great time to visit.
Taxi to and from the airport was very easy at only approx 40 Euros and 30 minutes each way and there is a taxi rank right outside the hotel with cabs there at all hours.
We would highly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay in Barcelona.",5,2012,12,22
36,Nice hotel,"Very handy if you have work in the area.  Nice hotel, very clean and the staff are extremely good.  Rooms are quite good, reasonably sized and everything worked that should be working.  Hotel itself was a little dull and seemed empty although that might just be the time of year. 

If you are a runner then this is a great spot with a lovely run by the beach just 200 yards away.

Enjoyed my stay.",4,2012,12,13
36,Quality and great location,"The location of this hotel is great, just by the beach, with metro and buses running all day (and night). If you are lucky enough to get a room in one of the top floors (15 and above), the views are amazing, you can almost see the whole city from up there.

There is a shopping mall just in front of the door, what is very convenient if you need to buy food or some clothes.

If you are celebrating something they have cava for you in your room.

All in all, a great choice!!!",5,2012,12,12
36,very good,"The hotel has a modern design. Lots of marble and wood. The lobby is nice but lacks a warm atmosphere. Same is true for the place where you have breakfast, it was noisy .... the hotel is so big, and when having breakfast you have the impression to have people everywhere. They should have dedicated more space for that area maybe. The bedrooms are spacious and well equipped . The internet - even if charged - worked poorly during my entire stay. The service and personnel was very king. Good infrastructure for sport and sauna. The hotel missed a little to receive in my opinion the ""outstanding"" grade.",4,2012,12,11
36,Lovely hotel- shame they feel the need to rip off business travellers,"This hotel is lovely. Large room, large bathroom, all the comforts you would expect & excellent service (the maids actually went to the trouble of lining up my make-up and folding all my clothes for me).  The breakfast selection was huge, and excellent quality. Bar staff were attentive & passionate about their drinks (allbeit expensive),

My one gripe, a fairly important one when you're travelling on business, is that despite paying €160 p/nt for the room- they still felt it necessary to charge an additional €25 per 24hrs for internet!!! Not reasonable,not acceptable, and down-right embarassing to have to put that down on your expenses......I'm now extending my stay for pleasure in a cheaper, city centre hotel (€60 p/nt) and guess what? The internet is free....",4,2012,11,30
36,lovely hotel,"went here in august 2010 and had a lovely experience. arrived on my birthday and got a lovely piece of cake and bottle of fizz complimentary to celebrate, it was a very personal touch. all staff members were lovely, very cheerfull. had dinner in the resturant a few nights, the food was great. i came with my partner and my little boy (2 year old at the time). stayed for a week. the only downside was the pool was freezing. too cold to go into unfortunatly. would reccomend this hotel for a romantic getaway rather than a family holiday. oh and also the weather in august isn't great!",4,2012,11,29
36,Good hotel let down by lots of niggles,"The hotel is of a modern design with clean lines and lots of marble and wood. The lobby is functional and efficient but lacks a warm atmosphere. Apart from the check-in area, there is an amply-sized lobby bar/seating area, access to the main ballroom but no hotel shop that I could see. The bedrooms are spacious, finished to a high standard and well equipped (including a fully-stocked mini bar). I tried the room service one evening and found the service excellent. There were several niggles that let the hotel down during my stay: (1) the internet (both in the rooms and the public areas) worked very poorly during my entire stay with many problems faced logging on and keeping logged on. I lost a lot of work time because of this; (2) during my stay it rained during one of the nights. The noise of the rain against the window and façade of my room actually woke me up. There seemed to be absolutely no noise insulation whatsoever; it was akin to placing a metal tray above your head and having someone pour water on to it. In all of the hotels I have stayed in around the world, I have never faced such a problem (3) the bar in the executive lounge was poorly maintained – on my visit there, every sparkling, white and red wine bottle was empty and not replenished  (4) the bedroom had an ironing board but no iron (5) there is no pen/notepad/stationary in the bedroom (6) the TV in the bedroom is poor, the menu structure cumbersome, reception on many channels is distorted, and the clock on the front fascia only shows when the TV is on (not much good if you want to check the time in the middle of the night!) (7) the weight scales in the bathroom did not work. Overall this is a good hotel but could be much better if they address these niggles.",3,2012,11,28
36,"Exception staff, beautiful hotel, great location","First I have to take a moment to applaud one of the front desk staff members – Eric. Earlier this month we had the pleasure of meeting this young man. Me and my husband was celebrating our recent marriage and spending a portion of our honeymoon at the Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona. We arrived very early and he was able to get us to a room, and he made sure we had a room with a great view due to our special celebration. He went out of his way to make sure we were taken care of in every way possible. He was highly knowledgeable about the city and the best routes to get us to where we wanted to go via train/bus. Even upon checkout with another staff member, he came over to greet us and ask about our stay in Barcelona. It made us feel touched and very special. We will always remember him and how he adding more memories to our honeymoon and made it that much more special. 

Additionally, the hotel itself is beautiful. Our room had a great view of the beach and the opposite mountains. It was very clean, modern, and super luxurious bathrooms – I enjoyed the jets and the TV in the tub! It is in a great location between the beach and the mountains/hills on the other side. Right beside the hotel is a large shopping center/mall – so there are plenty of selections of food outside the hotel. We did not order room service, but we were pleasantly surprised to find a complimentary bottle of champagne and dessert tray waiting for us in the evening. Overall, A+ and we would stay there if we were to travel to Barcelona again.",5,2012,11,27
36,Beautiful,"What a beautiful hotel. The staff are excellent and service levels were 100%. The Hotel although located outside the main city of Barcelona is in a great position close to a wonderful beach. The Hotel has a rooftop pool and bar area which are wonderful ! 

The rooms are spacious and bathrooms very luxurious. A gem of a find in Barcelona and I would recommend this hotel to both business and holiday travellers. 

The City Hop on Hop off Tour has a pick up point just 50 m down the road from the Hotel and it would be worth buying a 2 day travel card and using this to get into the City Centre. We did catch a taxi from the City centre back to the Hotel and this was EUR 8 so not too expensive.",5,2012,11,24
36,Ideally for business travelers,Ideally situated for Business travelers.But internet charges are a significant extra cost.The restaurant was pretty good but the space lacks atmosphere..You 're expecting something more for a HILTON..Room service times were adequate although 2 times my room were made at 15:00..Breakfast is buffet style and provides a good choice of reasonable quality.,4,2012,11,22
36,Best stay for all eurotrip,"Staff really welcoming, early check-in. Close to Beach, just 3 min walking, and close to big shopping center and 4 min walk from underground station. We got room in 18th floor with city view :) If you going to stay here, than ask for higher floor. Reception staff were knowledge about city facilities and attractions, especially their don't have any concierge desk. Only one minus was that: we book taxi to the PG Gracia station to catch train to airport, but luggage porter flag one outside and they did not tell where we going, Taxi driver didn`t speak English and we tried to explain for him which station we are going and driver bring us to the Gracia underground station which is around 10 away by another taxi. Almost miss train and flight. If you using taxi than make sure you have full address of place where you want to go. Overall: Stay was excellent.",5,2012,11,22
36,"Fine for business, far from everything except the sea for tourists","Room
…was good - spacious, comfortable and clean (though the windows were really dirty), but overall impression is “nothing special” to be honest.

We had breakfasts only. The variety and quality of food was fine.

Staff was helpful and their recommendations (f.e. regarding good nearby restaurants) were really good.

Location
40 minutes drive from the airport (45-50 Euro by taxi), 15 minutes drive to the city center (= +/-10 Euro by taxi). It’s pretty far from the city center and all the sights. Not a walking distance at all. 7 minutes walk to the sea though. Right across the street there is a shopping center Diagonal Mar, the list of shops represented there can be found here http://www.diagonalmarcentre.es/en/shopping.html 
If you are visiting Barcelona as a tourist, I would rather recommend something closer to the center, while it’s totally fine if you are going there for business.",3,2012,11,20
36,The better Hilton in Barcelona!,"Only a week after staying at the Hilton Barcelona, I spend a week at the Hilton Diagonal Mar. Ideally situated for Business travelers attending events at the CCIB (AKA Forum) which is literally around the back of the hotel. I love the grand entrance and the spacious sitting area in front of a very long stretched bar. If you're in a hurry, you may want to consider a sandwich in the shopping mall across the road, the service is very Spanish and therefore slow. My room was on the top floor (23rd) offered an incredible view. I had a standard room with a kingsized bed nothing special although comfortable and with all the necessary amenities. Of course WIFI is not free and costs €25 per 24 hours! When working long days and having little time, it is always disappointing when things don't function properly even simple things. In my case, the desk light was broken, the ironing board collapsed on me (like in the Hilton Barcelona, by the way!) and the shower basin flooded after a 10 minute shower. I also came back to the room one evening to find that the empty bottles and glasses had not been removed. Small things however, not acceptable in a quality hotel like the Hilton perceives to be. Room service times were adequate although my order came up incorrect. Breakfast was very good and having access to the executive lounge on the 15th floor meant there was always a comfortable place to sit. Out of the two Hilton's I would recommend this one although, my favorite is still the Hotel Arts!",4,2012,11,19
36,Handy for the Forum,"Have stayed here a number of times during last 6 years mainly for its convenience to the Forum.  It's not especially elegant nor stylish - more a contemporary corporate hotel.

Service has noticeably improved over the years though this visit was marred by an unhelpful concierge who directed us to a lobby computer, with chargeable internet connection, when we sought assistance with a booking for the Picasso Museum.  As indicated by other reviewers, internet charges are a significant extra cost.

Rooms are comfortable and quiet and a number have excellent views of city and/or sea, especially the more glamorous spaces at the top.  Breakfast is buffet style and provides a good choice of reasonable quality. In the evenings the restaurant serves dinner, which is OK if you want to eat in, but the space lacks atmosphere - not the best place for a Valentine's celebration for example.  A taxi downtown is quick and takes you to better dinner venues.  Alternatively, the shopping mall opposite the hotel has ""food court"" options - as well as some nice shops.

Rates at the hotel vary according to local demand - only once in 6 years have we balked at the rate quoted (€300+) and we then found a better option in the city centre.  Experience suggests that shopping around the various booking agencies is worthwhile - on this occasion we obtained a daily rate of £132 with breakfast via Olotels.",3,2012,11,18
36,great location and services,"Stayed for 3 nights and I enjoyed the services at the executive floor.They have a bar at this floor available till late in the evening.
Close to the metro and to the beach.
Great breakfast buffet with excellent taste.
 Also fitness facilities available.",4,2012,11,15
36,"Good, but over priced","At €204 per night, I was expecting - if not opulence - then at least serious luxury.  Almost everything cost extra - wifi @ €25 a day anybody (and flaky wifi at that!)?

As I was there for a conference, all I really needed was a bed, a shower and some breakfast.  All were provided, but I couldn't help but feel I was over paying for what I got.

Penultimately, the staff would come into the room a lot, and to be honest I thought for €25, the wifi would have been a bit more reliable!  Also, there was a light over my door that I couldn't turn off (apparently for safety!), and that kept me awake

Finally, I'd have to say there's nothing wrong with the Hilton, but at €815 for four nights, I would have expected more.",3,2012,11,14
36,Beautiful Hotel,"Stayed for 2 nights after a cruise, before travelling home, using HHonours points.  We were upgraded to an executive room and it was ready on our arrival at 7am!!!  Fantastic!!  The metro was a 5 minute walk away, buses and taxis are right outside and there's a mall conveniently located across the street.  The beach is a 15 minute walk away, and was less than 30 minutes to the airport in a taxi.  The room and bathroom were immaculate and very comfortable.  Breakfast was very good.  Reception staff excellent.",5,2012,11,13
36,"Ok, but it was not the hotel I thought I had booked!!!!","Went here last week for a quick trip.   I thought I had booked the Hilton on Avenue Diagonal, but no - this is a DIFFERENT one.   Still it was nice enough.  A good solid hilton.

Very nice lounge they have - one of the better ones I have come across and with a pretty amazing view from the terrace.

Room was ok - modern enough and good overall.",3,2012,11,11
36,25 Euros/day for internet access!,"The hotel is nice inside, but it is kind of far from central Barcelona. I cannot believe that they charge 25 euros/day for internet access. I would rate the hotel higher if they charged a more reasonable rate, but that charge is so excessive, it soured my whole opinion of the hotel. ",2,2012,11,11
36,"Beautifully remodeled, clean and quiet with great location for local transportation","Hilton has done a great job on this remodel.  Rooms are relatively quiet considering closeness to main drag.  The hotel employers are extremely friendly and the ruins are beautiful and functional.  Wifi works well and amenities such as climate control and water temperature work well.
Come enjoy it!",5,2012,11,09
36,"Great hotel, bit far from central Barcelona","this hotel has a very large bar and reception area - light, comfortable and impressive. The breakfast was available at a discounted rate if booked on check-in, reducing it from 22 Euro to 16 Euro per day. This was better value but still quite a lot for what most business people would eat at that time!  The room was very large - I had a corner room - with a bath/shower and a shower cubicle and an enormous bed, plenty of hanging space and free wifi.  Very impressed with it overall - the only disadvantage was the distance from the centre of town - a good 25 minutes in a taxi.",4,2012,11,09
36,Reasonable Business Hotel,"Hotel is well located for events at the CCIB conference centre, but is some way out of the city, so not recommended for tourists. The rooms are a good size and reasonably well fitted. I did have a couple of issues that were well resolved and I was provided a complementary bottle of cava, which was a nice touch. The room price was consistent with other good hotels in the area, but I was shocked by the price of the internet at 25 euros/day, as it is 5 times the price of a similar quality hotel that I am staying at in central Barcelona. Food quality was good and the staff were excellent.",4,2012,11,08
36,Good location and the quality of the hilton hotels,"this is my favourite choice when i visit barcelona:  nice room with seaview (big windows) , and lovely swimming pool with restaurant service. just 5 minutes waliking  from the sea and from the underground station (very important casue hotel  location is not very central). In front hotel a commercial center with restaurat and shopping. 10 minute wlaking from forum. i advice this hotel for leisure but also business.",5,2012,11,08
36,Simply unacceptable!,"Are you planning a visit to Barcelona?  Are you planning to stay in a “good” hotel like “Hilton Diagonal Barcelona’’?  Just to be sure, bring with you soaps, shampoo, shower gel, batonetes and slippers. Bring also a lamp so that you can see when you sit at  the desk and a cover to hide a big hole on the desk chair.",2,2012,11,07
36,"Really expensive, not too close unless working in the area","The hotel has lovely rooms that overlook the sea which are really nice.  But the location is a bit fare from tourist areas so unless working right there be careful when booking. 
The hotel is also insanely expensive.  I travel 100+ night is 4+ star hotels so I am used to high rates.  Its not so much the 275 EUR rate but the additional 25 EUR for wifi (outrageous!) and 25 EUR for breakfast
I had a lot of interaction with the staff and they were all wonderful and helpful!",3,2012,11,06
36,Good locations for the beech,"The hotel is large with a very nice ground floor bar.  Bedrooms are very nice and large. We only ate breakfast in the hotel, it was better than average. You can ask the chef to make you anything but they don't advertise this. 

Town centre is a 40min walk or €10 to €12 taxi ride. The metro is opposite the hotel. Beech is only a five minute walk away. Airport is €30 taxi ride. 

Downside, pool is closed in the winter and the gym is small but functional. Thought it was expensive but then Barcelona is not cheep.",4,2012,11,05
36,Nice hotel,"Nice hotel, rooms comfortable staff friendly and welcoming. Exec lounge is one of the better ones. Gym is about average. Restaurant very nice in the evening with good range of dishes and helpful and friendly waiters, breakfast was the widest range of foods i've ever seen at a breakfast buffet, theyve got anything you can imagine. It's about a 40 minute walk into town but quite a pleasant one along the seafront with dozens of bars and cafes to stop in. Cab back about a tenner. Recommended for couples. If you're in town on business you could do a lot worse!",4,2012,11,03
36,Excellent but a little remote,"We stayed here as a family for 3 nights and loved the hotel. As HHonors members we were upgraded to Executive rooms and enjoyed the 6-8:30pm happy hour in the lounge serving free drinks and lovely canapés / tapas. 

The rooms were comfortable with excellent views of the sea. 

The breakfast was really good too. 

Staff were attentive and helpful. I was absolutely delighted when they were able to fix tickets to FC Barcelona when I couldn't get them on the Internet. 

Just across the road there is a large shopping centre with some very good restaurants as well as some good shopping too.

The only thing preventing a full 5 strs for me was the location. Whilst handy for the beach it's a long long way to the centre. The underground is around 7 stops. The tourist bus does stop nearby, but you need to change onto another route before finding any of the main sights. 

However, if you build in a little extra time or are happy to either get an underground (10 trips less than €10) or a taxi you will love this hotel. ",4,2012,11,02
36,"Very nice Hilton, definitely Business-oriented, distant from Barcelona city centre","As a Hilton Gold Member, I am well versed in Hilton and the perks...and this Hilton had almost every single one.  As an aside, we were on holiday with our 8 year old and 10 year old and, while they were extremely well-behaved, kids who are a bit rambunctious will not be appreciated by the other clientele.  
PERKS: Executive lounge access (on the 15th floor) for Gold & Diamond members provided complimentary  tea/coffee service, happy hour, and full breakfast...very nice and posh. If your room happens to be on one of the top floors (22 total floors) of the hotel, the views are AMAZING.  The location is near the beach (about 2 blocks away), and located in an upper-end neighborhood with a mall across the street and a large park for walking, sports, etc.  The pool looked nice, but it was too cold (15 C) during our stay.  
DISADVANTAGES: Quite a distance from the Barcelona city centre; if you plan on visiting Barri Gothic, Rambla, Eixample, etc, you are going to need to take the Metro for a few stops or a 10 min taxi ride.  Not quite family-oriented; the hotel definitely caters to the business and executive classes...unless you have mature/well-behaved kids or teens.",4,2012,11,02
36,"It's a Hilton, does what it says on the tin.","I stayed at this hotel for two nights on a business trip. The check in and out at reception was quick and efficient, staff were smart, polite and spoke excellent english. The room was comfortable, spotless and well equiped as was the bathroom. The bar area in the lobby was very nice and the barman attentive. The breakfast was the usual big buffet, with hot and cold dishes of every kind, and the waiting on staff were again most courteous and helpful. I did not experience the leisure facilities so cannot comment on that. Diagonal Mar area is a busy area with bars and restaurants nearby, about 15mins in a taxi to La Rambla, about 10euro fare.
A good hotel, probably more suited to business clients than a romantic holiday.",4,2012,11,02
36,"super hotel,close to shopping and beach within walking diet.","big but very nice ,put in a bit extra and stay on the top floor,the terrace there is worth it!
flexible and helpful staff,the weather turned bad so we wanted to leave earlier ,this was no probleme ,only paid for stay not for all days booked,flexible attitude means we want to come back
breakfast in the ex.lounge was perfect,same for afternoon snacks and wine/drinks",5,2012,10,31
36,My group's lovely stay at Diagonal Mar,"This is a beautiful hotel, very modern, clean, very nicely located!  The breakfast is out of this world!  Large buffet with great choices, the rooms are very nice, some have views of the ocean and some views of the city which is also very nice.  I had a group of 57 people arriving in 6 increments and Susana Bispo and Pilar Sanchez were wonderful in arranging transfers from the airport for me for all of them!  They were so effecient and nice to work with and my people were all very happy with this hotel.  Barcelona is a great city, by the way!  So I hope to go back and I hope to stay at this hotel!",5,2012,10,29
36,holiday,"we stayed here  for one nite from our holiday in spain to visit barcelona , it is a fantastic hotel veiws excellent , we was on the 16th floor over looking the fantastic pool and beach ,plenty of bars and restaurants in the shopping centre opposite the hilton great veiew of it from the corridoor, love to stay again .....",5,2012,10,27
36,Great Hotel!,We had a wonderful stay at the Diagonal Mar Hilton.  The accommodations were great and the breakfast was very good and extensive.  The executive lounge was well stocked and added much to the overall stay.  The staff was friendly and the hotel was located very close to the metro (3 blocks from hotel) and a hop-on-hop-off tourist bus stop (1 block from hotel).,5,2012,10,27
36,Hilton Diagonal Mar - a great place and also truly coeliac ( gluten-free)aware,"We ( my wife and myself) visited this hotel for a short break 22-24 October 2012. One of our key requirements was for a coeliac ( aka, gluten intolerant, they say 'celiac' in USA) awareness. This is a real tough requirement! Not many hotels in the world truly cater for this special dietary condition, which demands gluten-free ingredients in the food and, equally important, also gluten free preparation ( seperate cooking oils and utensils to prevent cross contamination etc.). Many hotels will say they cater for 'dietary needs' but our experience is few truly deliver and then the holiday is spoiled. I want to inform you that this hotel delivered in every respect! We let the hotel know in advance of the dietary requirement and not only was the food at Indigo restaurant perfect but also the restaurant staff demonstrated a real awareness and knowledge and helped in the menu selection. 
The hotel was very clean, the staff so friendly and attentive, its ideally situated within walking distance of the quiet beach in a quiet, clean area where we felt safe. And then, just across the road is a nice shopping Mall with a food area that sells - you guessed it gluten free ( labelled ""Sin-gluten"" and ""Apta para celiacos"") foods and even beers!!  I wish I could award this hotel even 10 stars!!! Special thanks to YOLANDA LLORCA who helped arrange that our short break went so smoothly and in such comfort. We shall return for sure!",5,2012,10,26
36,Good stay.,"My wife and I cruised on Royal Caribbean Liberty of the Seas August 25th
(Sorry about not posting this sooner, no excuses)
We flew into Barcelona one day early and spent the night at the Hilton Diagonal Mar hotel. We arrived at the hotel about 10:00 AM and were greeted at the desk by a smiling Hugo who was extremely helpful in both checking us in and helping us plan our day. We knew our room would not be available until midafternoon so we wanted to take a guided tour of Barcelona. We had purposely not pre-booked because we were unsure of how we would feel after our first all night Trans-Atlantic flight.
Not to worry, Hugo found us a guide with a Mercedes Van in 30 minutes. Armando with Diagonal Mar Limousines was absolutely delightful.  He was knowledgeable, professional, experienced and friendly. Little did we know that this, like all of our “private” tours in Europe, would be a “5 star experience” Armando priced us a 4 hour private tour for 300 Euro’s but he ended up taking us for 5 hours at the same price. We saw everything we had previously scouted out on the internet and much more. A wonderful guide and a wonderful Ambassador for Barcelona!!
In addition to Hugo our Bellhops also went out of their way to accommodate our every need. The rest of the front desk staff that we had contact with could use some training in how to smile. They were not really rude, by any means, just not very friendly. In fairness though, this seemed to be a busy time and it’s possible they were just stressed. 
Being rookies in European travel we naturally did not bring electrical adaptors. Once again Hugo came through and supplied us with the necessary equipment to charge our I-phones and I-pads.
The only disappointment during our stay was a surly hostess at breakfast in the restaurant.  She insisted on seating us right next to the smoking section. My wife suffers from Asthma and Allergies so that was unacceptable. Unfortunately she seemed completely indifferent to our concerns so we left and went across the street to a Starbucks in the mall. There we had a light breakfast and free WiFi service.
No complaints regarding the room, it was clean, had a comfortable bed and was ready at the time promised.
All in all, we had a pleasant one night stay at the Hilton Diagonal Mar hotel and because of our experience with Hugo at the front desk I would recommend it.",4,2012,10,25
36,wonderful experience,Beautiful location along the near Metro stops and large shopping center.  Rooms are spaciuos and well appointed.  Our third stay over five years and we will keep coming back.  Executive lounge very good...gorgeous views of city and sea.,4,2012,10,25
36,Barcelona October 2012,"We spent 3 nights in this hotel - we found the room spacious and modern. Breakfast was buffet style but was very nicely laid out and lots of choices from full cooked breakfast to just toast and marmalade. We stayed on the 12th floor and had a sea view - was a bit obstructed with office buildings but still got to see a beautiful sunrise. Opposite the hotel is a shopping complex and there were lots of different restaurants and that is where we would eat in the evenings. Felt that the hotel is geared more towards business customers but we still loved our time spent there. Very clean and the staff were ver helpful. If staying as a tourist, the hotel is situated on the route of the tourist bus service and is only 30 minutes by taxi at rush hour which is pretty good. The toiletries in the room were lovely and robes were provided which was very handy.",5,2012,10,25
36,Great location for business meetings,"I stayed in Hilton for 2 nights in October on a business trip. Although it is away from the old city, the facility itself is great. Nice rooms and comfortable beds. There is a nice shopping area in front of the hotel which is very handy. The beach is very close with a few minutes stroll. The breakfast was good with plenty of choices. Great hotel overall.",4,2012,10,24
36,Pleasant hotel in Barcelona,"Stayed in this hotel for two days prior to joining a Mediterranean cruise.  The room was very good - quiet, clean, of a good size and well-maintained - and it's over the road from a nice shopping mall which also had several very pleasant restauraunts on the roof-top.  It is also located very close to a Hop-on/Hop-off tourist bus stop which made for quite economical touring in Barceklona itself.  Did not use much of the hotel's amenities (pool etc) but they loked to be on a par with the rest of the hotel.

A good stay.",4,2012,10,22
36,Last bit of sunshine in Barcelona,"Managed one last weekend in Barcelona before the summer weather broke and this time stayed at the Hilton.
The check-in was slightly long-winded - i have often wondered why hotels haven't progressed like airlines have with the check-in process. Waiting for 20mins to speak to someone to get a door key?! Really!?

Anyway - the staff were great and with Hilton Gold HHonors status we had our rooms upgraded to one of the Exec Floors.

Rooms themselves were more than adequate - as you would expect from a Hilton.
The Exec lounge was awesome though: serving complimentary breakfast and evening cocktails and canapes. There is a nice outdoor area to the lounge which was great for sundowners.

Be aware that if there is a concert playing in town the noise carries right to the hotel - was a bit annoying to be kept up by it.

The lovely outdoor pool shuts down for the winter from the end of september. This is a shame as it's a great pool which was looking longingly at us in the warm october sunshine! I wish they heated it and kept it open all year.

All in all a very pleasant stay.",4,2012,10,21
36,Less than expected,"We stayed at this hotel for two nights. We are a family of four and I had asked for two interconnecting rooms. When we arrived they had not honored our request, but they did offer to give us two adjacent rooms. 

The rooms were nice, but nothing spectacular and they needed some more cleaning. In one room the aircondition was not working and in the other one night table lamp either, but these were fixed. 

Both mornings we had breakfast in the hotel. The breakfast room was old fashioned and lacked day light. The staff was overwhelmed, kept running up and down, forgetting things, taking forever to bring orders and the buffet kept emptying and took forever to  refill.

All in all, I would expect much more from this hotel.",3,2012,10,17
36,Great hotel,"I transferred here for 5 nights after spending my first night at the Renaissance in the city. This hotel is located near the northern end of the beach area.  I took the subway and it was convenient. 
Check-in was a breeze.  As a diamond elite, I had access to the expansive club level lounge on  the 15th floor, which offered free breakfast and free snacks/drinks.  From 6-8:30pm, alcoholic drinks are complimentary.  In addition, free wifi for elites.  
My room was a corner exec suite (2 rooms).  It was interesting because it was separated by an ""indoor window"" that allowed you to view the main flat panel tv that was in the bedroom area.  The bath was nice, but I noticed some mildew in the tub.  The room was well layed out and worked. 
The best part of this hotel is location from the beach.  In literally 5 minutes you are walking on white sand.  I particularly enjoyed just taking a long walk along the beach and back. For me, this was a good home base for the week, although it is a little harder to get to certain tourist attractions cheaply (subway works, but takes a while - cabs are plentiful).  
Service was excellent and the club lounge attendants were very good in the morning and the afternoon.  
If you are elite or have lounge access, this is one of the best selling points. After a day of wandering around, it was nice to come back and sit outdoors and just chill out (there is a wraparound deck outside the lounge).  
Overall: I highly recommend this hotel for those focused on a fun time at the beach.",4,2012,10,16
36,Well Done,"From first arrival at the front desk the staff were very good. Comfortable bed and clean room. Breakfast selection good. Chose this hotel for the location of being by  the sea and out of town which worked well for us. The underground is 5 mins walk away and very cheap 10 trips for just over 9 euro.
Taxi's are outside if required although there does seem to be a dual meter system operating in the cabs. The ones that have red digits on the display screen charge what's on the display the other's have a blue display and seem to have an extras bit which comes to light when they press the total.
 Having walked your feet off it was great to get back for tea and cakes (we were fortunate with the weather) and have some rest in the warmth of the sunshine. Pity the pool was closed as the temperature was fine. The front desk and Christobal in the exec lounge were great for recommendations, information and booking eateries. Excellent alround service. Well done Hilton Diagonal Mar. This is how it should be.",5,2012,10,15
36,Okay but not great,"There are a few ways people judge a hotel...cleanliness, service, bed and room comfort, food availability, and location. Our room was lovely with a very comfortable bed and clean bathroom. The service was wonderful. We had a very short time to do a lot and the staff did everything they could to help us get our list of must sees done. Then there's the Food...there's where the problem starts...in the evening the hotel had wonderful tapis. There was a croquette that melted in your mouth and a jamon on focaccia that was to die for. Breakfast was a disaster! I've never seen such disgusting runny scrambled eggs! As far as location goes, we were approximately 6 Km. from Los Ramblas. I know, I walked it. But, it was a lovely walk along the beach and the Spanish people we met were very warm and friendly. Taxi service was never a problem and if we had wanted to there was a subway entrance nearby. I would stay here again. Just wouldn't have breakfast there.",4,2012,10,13
36,"Clean rooms, friendly staff. Food was very expensive and the location can be a challenge.","It's a decent hotel - close to the Mediterranean so I'm sure some rooms have an amazing view.  I could just see the water from my 6th floor (street facing) room which I thought was nice since I didn't pay for any kind of a view.  The rooms were nice, clean.  The bed was a bit hard for my liking and that interrupted my sleep the last two nights I was there.  

I was attending a conference at the Fira Grand Via and it took over an hour  (two metro changes, a Renfe train trip and a conference shuttle) to get to the hotel in the morning, and about an hour to return in the evenings so be aware of this if you need to travel daily to that part of the city. 

To go out in the evenings it was about a 20 minute (L4) metro ride to get to the center of town so that wasn't bad.

Breakfast at the hotel was expensive - 25 Euro ""at the door"" and 16 Euro if you buy breakfast tickets at check in.  It's buffet only and I thought the quality and diversity of the options was lacking and quite honestly not worth either price. There are not many other breakfast options near by so you're a bit of a hostage. It is located near a commercial center but that was still closed in the mornings by the time I had to leave the hotel. On my last day I just had a croissant and cappuccino in the hotel bar before heading to the airport.  It was 8 Euro but that seemed like a bargain.

I would probably not stay here again due to the location and lack of simple dining options close by.",3,2012,10,13
36,Nice Hotel with good amenities,"We stayed at this hotel for one night before we boarded our Holland America cruise. We had a suite and the rooms were nice and comfortable. We did not dine at the hotel, but we had breakfast which was good, but expensive. The only thing which was not up to par for this hotel was the coffee in the lounge area. We asked for a cup of coffee and although it was made from the machine, it was delivered cold. Otherwise everything else was very nice.",4,2012,10,12
36,Wonderful gem steps from everything,"The staff at this hotel was super friendly, extremely helpful and very professional.  Although there is no concierge desk per se, everyone at the front desk is an accessible source of useful information.  Don't be afraid to ask questions!
Our room had a great wooden floor.  I personally love wood floors in hotel rooms!
The bed was super comfortable with lovely bed linens.  The bathroom had a separate shower and bathtub, and was very large.  
The executive lounge had a gorgeous view and was quite large.  Breakfast offerings were very generous and varied.  
The hotel is a few steps across the street from a mall with a huge supermarket.  It was also around the corner from a metro stop that will quickly and cheaply bring you everywhere in the city.  If you feel like touring, a Hop On Hop Off tour bus stop.  Another great treat, is that the beach is less than a block away.
In short, the staff is great, the rooms are fantastic and the location is super convenient.",5,2012,10,11
36,Nice location for connecting to cruise port.,"Nice, friendly employees and clean quiet hotel.  If possible, pay for breakfast in advance...30 euros for breakfast buffet was too much per person.  Good views of the city.  30 minutes from cruise port.  Close to some attractions. ",4,2012,10,08
36,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona,"We stayed at the Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona for six nights after a cruise September 2012. The area is quiet yet near the city centre. We noted in some guides it indicates within walking distance of La Rambla but that may be okay for someone who likes long walks but not us.
However transport was available with the hop on hop off bus 100 metres away, busses outside and taxis lined up at the corner. There is a great shopping centre across the road with plenty of choices of restaurants, cinemas, and a lively open square.
The staff at the hotel are fantastic, very friendly and a great help with information about everything a tourist needs. We had bed and breakfast and were very happy with the range of food offered for breakfast.
Rooms were a generous size and the bed very comfortable.
We had a seaview but it was limited to sea views between buildings, next time I will ask for a room overlooking the Mall  which was bustling all day.
The area is far from being old, it is a new area and we felt vrey safe. I would stay there again.",4,2012,10,07
36,Only problem was the distance to La Rambla,"This is a great hotel, if you want to be close to the beach. However, to get to the inner city to see the sites, you need to take a bus or taxi.

I used Hilton Honors points for our three night stay because I just could not see myself spending $400 Euro for a night. When I made my reservation I asked for everything.....a high floor with a sea view and...access to the Club Floor. We got both!! The view from our room and the TOP floor was the Mediterrenean Sea!

The hotel staff was excellent. They were able to help us with dining suggestions near the hotel and to explain to us how to get to and from the sites.

The first day we used a one day pass on the hop on, hop off bus system. The pick up and drop off is right around the corner of our hotel...very convenient. The second day the staff convinced us that the city bus was easy and simple, plus, much less expensive than the tourist bus system.

We got to see all of the highlites of Barcelona and did not have to deal with the evening crowds and noise. The Hilton Diagonal Mar was a great way to end our vacation. It definently meets the expectations of being a Hilton property.",4,2012,10,07
36,nice hotel !!,"Stayed there for four nights , the rooms are very clean and the hotel as well . The service staff wre good. Nice little gym a, there is a metro station close by. i would definitly stay there again ! There are many little coffee place near by , so get out the hotel to eat !! Overall",4,2012,10,07
36,"Lovely room, quiet, excellent staff","On our last two nights of a three week trip through Catalonia we stayed here on points. We were given a lovely room on the 18th floor overlooking the sea (that took some extra points). The entire property is non-smoking and the beds are ridiculously comfortable. There was enough room and light (and wi-fi) to read or work in the room and the ironing board and iron were appreciated so we could look semi-presentable for the flight home! The front desk staff had excellent English and literally could not have been more helpful - including making practically heroic efforts to get me some extra pills for a prescription I had foolishly run out of! They're very close to a metro stop and a tram both of which we used easily.

I'm not sure if you can do shout-outs to great people here but if so many thanks to Nuria, Eric, Jocelyn and Francsico! They put up with a lot of questions and looked up many things for my sister and me.

As we were ending 3 weeks we were very happy to have a large shopping mall across the street. We wanted basic dumb things like Dunkin' Donuts coffee and reasonably priced meals and got both. That may not have been ""authentic"" of us but we had had enough authenticity and were more into convenience at that point!

The prices for the restaurant and the breakfast buffet (think it was 25 euros each) were too high for our depleted budgets so we didn't eat any of the food there and can't comment on it (other than those prices)!

They have an outside lap pool that we, unfortunately, didn't get an opportunity to use.

As others have said this certainly isn't in the center of town but it's easily reachable by public transportation and lovely. I would stay here again in a heartbeat.",5,2012,10,03
36,"Quiet alternative, but still close enough to everything","We arrived at Barcelona Airport (BCN) around 8:30AM after a long flight from the U.S to catch a cruise the following day. For our last visit to Barcelona, we stayed at a hotel near LaRambla, which was nice, but very loud and crowded. Wanting a little quieter experience, we chose Hilton Diagonal Mar. It is just outside the main city center, near beaches, but within 10-15 minutes to LaRambla. Plenty of transportation options to downtown and elsewhere, and hop on / hop off tourist bus just outside. It took about 35 minutes from airport to hotel, with cost around 40 euros. Hotel is clean inside, staff very nice, but were disappointed that the corner suite with wrap around glass we upgraded to had really filthy exterior windows that obviously had not been cleaned in a long, long time. So much for the beautiful view. Mall directly across has nice restaurants and shopping.",3,2012,10,02
36,"A good option - close to the beach, close to a metro stop, and a very nice hotel by itself.","We stayed here for three nights prior to a cruise.  We had been to Barcelona the year before and knew we wanted to be close to the beach if possible and close to a metro station.  This fit the bill perfectly.
     There are not any large hotels in the barcelonetta area, or that would have been our first choice.  But this hotel had a metro stop 5 minutes walk away, beach 5-10 minutes away, and a nice pool/deck area on its own.  Plus, there is a mall right across the street with free wi-fi (not provided by hotel for free unfortunately).  Some reviews have said this is in a ""rough area"" but I would disagree.  The buildings around are older, but the neighborhood did not seem dangerous at all.  This is a good option for anyone wanting to be close to the beach but also close to a metro stop.  You can easily get around to see all of Barcelona from here.",4,2012,09,30
36,"Nice hotel, though some attention to detail needed.","I stayed in this hotel the night before I was heading out on a cruise.  The check-in process itself was very easy and pleasant, though there was a wait because there were several guests checking in and out.  

The room is actually a very decent size, given that European hotel rooms can be small.  The bathroom is very large and offers a tub/shower combination, a separate shower, where the toilet is also located.  It's  possible for two people to shower at the same time, so that's quite a convenient feature.  

The only noise I heard, as with most hotels, is the slamming of doors.  I had come in from a long flight, so I needed to get a few hours rest before heading out later that evening for dinner.  The bed was very comfortable, so I was able to get a nice nap.  The curtains are the blackout curtains that effectively block out just about all light, so it was very nice and easy for me to fall asleep for a few hours.  

A nice feature of the closet is a light that automatically comes on each time one of the doors is opened.  It's a nice touch that prevents you from fumbling around for the lights switch.  The bed is modern one in which there are two very bright reading lights.  They are also a nice touch. 

Overall, the room was very clean and presentable.  However, more attention needs to be paid to the cleanliness of the bathroom.  Specifically, the shower stall clearly needed a more thorough scrubbing.  Because of that, I decided to shower in the tub/shower combination.  However, another fault is the condition of the shower curtain.  It appeared stained, and I believe it ought to be taken out of use.  The bathroom is spacious and luxurious, but the mildew-stained shower stall and the stained shower curtain in the tub/shower combination are two things that are unacceptable in a hotel of this caliber.  

The hotel is located in a very clean, quiet, and apparently safe area.  Nothin in the area made me feel uncomfortable.  There are taxis to the side of the hotel, so getting one is not difficult.  The beach is also just up the street.  

Across the street from the hotel is a large mall that houses many stores and restaurants of all types.  Thus, after having breakfast there on the day of check-out, it was easy for me to purchase water and juice that I took on the cruise.  Al Campo is a large department store in that mall, and they have a very large grocery store on the bottom floor.  

The staff was very courteous and helpful.  It was easy and quick to exchange money.  The staff was kind enough to look up and write down the address of a restaurant at which I had reservations.  They even told me the approximately cost of the taxi.  

If I were in Barcelona, I would stay at this hotel again.  However, I hope that the mildew in the shower stall and the stained shower curtain for the tub/shower were exceptions and not the norm.",4,2012,09,27
36,A Fine Hilton Hotel,"This Hilton property is representative of what you'd expect from a Hilton located in a business district.  The rooms are clean, nice size, and very comfortable for a good night's sleep.  The hotel itselt is located a little ways away from the main attractions of the city, however it's in walking distance to the beach and a short taxi/bus ride away from a host of popular sites.  There are restaurants, shopping, etc. just across the street from the hotel.   The hotel does have a nice pool area, however as it's in a business area, it's surrounded by office buildings, which takes away from the pool atmosphere.  Overall, you can't go wrong with the hotel and I would certainly recommend it to anyone looking to explore Barcelona.",4,2012,09,25
36,Great hotel!,"I arrived at 10:30 AM after a long overnight flight and was definitely exhausted.  The gentleman who checked me in allowed me to go straight to the room and even upgraded me to a sea view!  I was a bit concerned about which room I would get since I was using Hilton Honors points for the night.  Wow!  The room was fantastic!  Great views, terrific bath with two separate showers, comfy chair and the BEST mattress in a hotel I have ever slept on.  

The location was wonderful as well.  I did utilize the mall/restaurants across the street which have any item that you may have forgotten for your trip.  There is a great grocery (3 floors) in the mall that has a fabulous cheese section..........on my, I could have stayed there for days just looking at all the wonderful food items.

The hotel was quiet and peaceful........just what I needed to get a good nights sleep.  I would definitely stay there again and will advise everyone that it is one of the best hotels in Barcelona.

Thanks Hilton Diagonal Mar for exceeding my expectations!",5,2012,09,24
36,Amazing,"We stayed here for 2 nights in the end of April 2012, and it was really amazing hotel, the staff was really friendly and helpful, the breakfast was great! the only thing was the dinner resturant which we ordered a fish and it was really dry, and the supervisior there didn't want to change our dish, but other than that everything was great!
it's abit far from the center but it's near a great mall so that's making up for that!",5,2012,09,24
36,Very nice,"Visited this hotel last week for a congress. Generally good service, very good food, nice room with a view 19th floor.
Swimming pool was very good for excercise.
We had a buffet lunch in the solarium and the food was very tastefull.
Location is not perfect to go to the city centre, but beach is very close.",4,2012,09,23
36,Very good Hotel,Nice Hilton hotel with excellent service! Nice views from our room and we enjoyed the pool and breakfast. The staff is very pleasant and the hotel is full of style. I rate it with maximum points even though it is a bit far from the city center.,5,2012,09,22
36,Best executive lounge ever!,"Gold club - have access to executive lounge.  But executive rooms have access as well.  This lounge is superlative.  

My husband and I didn't have that many Hilton comparisons when we stayed there.  We blithely enjoyed the excellent concierge service, varied appetizers mid-day and at night, complimentary beer and wine and non-alcoholic selection until closing at night and the beautiful upper floor view of the Mediterranean.  We thought it quite nice.  After more experience and comparisons, we now know it was excellent and included much more than usual Hilton executive lounges.

The concierge made good recommendations for local restaurants within walking distance.  Caution:  those Barcelonians must walk a lot and at a healthy clip.  We found that the  ""10 min recommended walk"" might take us 20+ minutes.  The restaurants were totally worth it.  We simply asked for something ""within 5 min"" and planned accordingly.

How to get to downtown Barcelona?  I recommend purchasing tickets for the get on and off tour bus that stops about 2 city blocks from the hotel.  It stops operating at 8 pm so you will either pay a big taxi fee or take a couple of transfers on the subway to return to the Hilton Diagonal Mar - your choice. Barcelona itself is decentralized so it didn't bother us to be busing to what we wanted to see.

Rooms are routine Hilton quality in good repair and kept clean.  Staff was polite and helpful.

Barcelona was wonderful and we want to go back.  If staying in a Hilton, I would recommend the Diagonal Mar location as the other recently (in summer 2012) renovated Hilton isn't closer to downtown.  If you like a central convenient location, you need to select a different hotel.  The Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona is comfortable and welcoming- with the best executive lounge- but it isn't downtown.",4,2012,09,21
36,High Hilton standard,"What can you expect of Hilton? High standard of hospitality. Exept all things the five starr hotel has, I will remember a great king size bed! You can play a tennis match on it. And secondly the breakfast!! You feel sorry there that your stomach has limited capacity.",5,2012,09,20
36,Good hotel for a holidays,This is a good Hilton hotel for a couple or family.  I have come here with my wife and 20 year old daughter.  Our daughter has her own room and thinks the hotel is great.  We have been staying here for 5 nights and have made thye most of the location and swimming pool.  Diagonal Mar is a very new area of Barcelona and good for retail shopping.  Good service as expected from a Hilton hotel.,4,2012,09,19
36,What a view and great property,This is over the top for the Hilton Hotels where I have stayed. The only negative was the Mediterranean breakfast. If you didn't like that type of food you were out of luck. Check in was perfect and the staff was great for English speaking visitors.,4,2012,09,17
36,very good,"We stayed for 2 nights and found it excellent. The location is right by the Diagonal Mar shopping centre and the beach so excellent if you want to shop and sunbathe.  This means the hotel is not central but we preferred this as it was quieter and transport to the centre is easy enough. We were on the 18th floor which had amazing views.  The room was large and comfortable with a nice bathroom.  We had breakfast which was great as well, typical buffet style breakfast with local specialities included.  We found the service excellent and the staff were knowledgeable and helpful.  We ate in the Diagonal Mar food court right next to the hotel which was cheapish and had a good variety of restaurants to choose from.  The pool and terrace are very large for a city hotel and we enjoyed this too.",5,2012,09,17
36,Clearly Business - not family orientated,"It really disappoints me to have to write this review as anyone can see from my previous reviews, I like the Hitlon Group hotels. However, for this particular hotel, I would really struggle to recommend it to anyone other than business travellers. 

The hotel itself looks and feels like a Hilton hotel. However, the thing that makes a hotel stay better than the next is the service. I have to say that not all staff at this hotel appear to be trained in Hilton customer service.

We had the airport limo transfer service arranged by the hotel - this was very good and the gentleman that collected us was excellent. Very, very friendly.

The hotel room was fine - except that there were no bathroom amenties in the room. We asked for these to be placed in the room - and at the time of checking out - one day later, we were still waiting for these to be brought to the room. The receptionist even told me that what we had in the bathroom (i.e. 1 shampoo) was normal for Hilton - something that I did not, and do not agree with as I stayed in the Hilton Singapore 1 day later and the bathroom amenities were the same brand and the standard array of products given. 

We had ordered a baby cot - again, this was missing from the room when we arrived - despite checking with the staff previously and despite the hotel arranging to collect us from the airport - so they knew what time we were due to arrive. The cot was delivered to the room nearly one hour after we had checked in and had asked for it again over the telephone. It should not take nearly an hour.

The worst part of the this experience however, has to be the staff lack of responsibility. I asked reception twice to be told ""I asked house keeping"" - not good enough. I am a diamond member and have stayed in many, many Hilton group hotels and this has to be the worst example of ""I've done my job so I've passed on responsibility"" that I have experienced. The only member of staff who is worthy of a positive mention is the member of the guest relations team that we spoke to upon check out - very good.  

The only good point was the Executive Lounge - nice size, good array of things on offer.",2,2012,09,14
36,Perfect for bussiness,"Clean, comfortable, quiet, beside convention center, can sea the mediteranian, 
Swisscom for internet 9euros, but free in mall diagonal mar infront of it, which is a great mall,
Free breakfast, limited but good choices
Not for family and kids, but great if coming for a conference or in bussiness trip
Main issue is low manpower, that is so clear, despite that very efficient hard working extreemly freindly staff",4,2012,09,11
36,Good Hotel,"Stayed here for 3 nights in July, very good hotel, not in central Barcelona and very close to the beach, a quieter area which is why we chose it as you can get to the centre of Barcelona as others have said by Taxi (plenty outside the hotel) for roughly 10 euros or metro or bus.
The food and drinks at this hotel are expensive but if you walk by the shopping centre there are alot of little bars etc alot cheaper.
The hotel was fairly clean and had a lovely pool with good service.
We would stay here again on our return to Barcelona.",4,2012,09,10
36,"Great, but...","Great hotel, nice location, great people but no free wi-fi Internet, and the payed one is very expensive and just for one computer/ telephone/ tablet! Come on, we are at 21st century! Even the mall across the avenue has free Internet! That's a big drawback!",5,2012,09,09
36,Very clean hotel with good service and rock hard beds,"My wife and I spent 4 nights at the Hilton.  Here are the positives and negatives:

Positives:
1) very good service
2) locations is close to Barcelona Football Stadium
3) good shopping and restaurants close by
4) very clean
5) ask for a top floor because they have walk in showers 
6) very good business lounge

Negatives:
1) the beds are rock hard and not comfortable.  If you have a bad back do not stay here.
2) typically very full.  When we checked in they did not have our room and had to give us a room
 with two small single beds.
3) there is a long distance from the beach and major touristic sights",4,2012,09,09
36,Professional and relaxed,"We travelled as a group of 6, with four young adults aged 19-21 so booked 3 rooms at this hotel and we all agreed that the rooms were clean, well-equipped and reasonably spacious.  The staff were professional and friendly and my worries about coming back from the pool or beach a bit dishevelled were unfounded.  Whilst some people complain about this hotel being out of the city centre, this is exactly why we choose it.  With the huge shopping centre directly across the road with many indoor and outdoor restaurants, the sightseeing buses, trams, metro and beaches all within a 5 minute walk the position was fabulous and refreshingly cool compared to the city centre oppressive heat.  The metro proved difficult for us to find but if you cross over towards the shopping centre and head right all the way round it, cross over the road and then head round the cafes etc on the opposite corner it's another minute or so along that road.

We enjoyed the pool, the bars and restaurants and our only complaint would be that latecomers to breakfast seemed to be faced with the leftovers.  During our 6 visits to breakfast none of my family managed to get a fried egg and coffee was always cold.  

Rooms were well equipped with iron, ironing board, kettle, full sized hairdryer that was not wired into the bathroom, safe and minibar which we used for cooling water and after sun.  Be careful not to move the contents of minibar as there is a warning to say you'll be charged.  Also each floor of the hotel had an ice machine - heavenly.

Just one request, it is the 21st century and every hotel should be providing free wi-fi for all customers not just those with executive status.  If the mall across the road and McDonalds can do it then so should you!!!

We all agreed we'd stay again and that we would recommend it to friends and family but a couple of improvements would have earned you a fifth star from us.",4,2012,09,08
36,"Lovely hotel that works for city sightseeing, though perhaps better for beach","My husband and I recently spent about a week at the Hilton Diagonal Mar while attending a conference at the nearby CCIB and vacationing for a few days.  Check-in was efficient, and as Hilton Gold members, we were pleased to receive a room upgrade with access to the Executive Lounge.  Our king room was clean and had an ocean view.  The good sized room (larger than we typically find in Europe) had a desk and nice desk chair, fabulously comfortable easy chair, flat-screen TV, and cabinet unit with a few shelves that could be used for storage (no drawers).  The bed was comfortable.  Room lighting was good, but reading lights by the bed could have been better.  Given all the gadgets that need recharging, the room also could have used more electrical outlets, especially at the bedside.  A kettle plus tea and instant coffee were provided.  We heard very little noise from either the exterior or interior of the hotel.  The air conditioning was fine and responded quickly whenever we adjusted the thermostat. The bathroom was large with a vessel sink atop a glass counter--I’ve always loved the look of these bowl sinks, but now after using one, I’ll put aside any acquisition desires as it really wasn’t so convenient and I splashed all over the beautiful counter!  There was a combination tub/shower with plenty of hot water and adequate water pressure. 

The buffet breakfast in the main dining room was very good with a huge variety of foods.  The Executive Lounge offered tasty snacks and had a lovely terrace overlooking the ocean. It was quite busy during most of our visits.  We didn’t use the pool, but it looked clean and the surrounding terrace looked very inviting.  Staff were all courteous; some were friendlier than others.

We walked to the Forum Metro stop in a little over five minutes and from there it was about a 20-minute ride to the city center.  A tram stop was also nearby.  The Diagonal Mar mall, right across the street, had a gigantic grocery store, many restaurants, and a laundry/dry cleaner in addition to the typical retail stores.  The CCIB was adjacent to the hotel.  The beach and several parks were also within walking distance as was the more traditional Poble Nou neighborhood, which offered a nice contrast to the stark and modern area of the hotel..

The location of the hotel isn’t the best for a Barcelona sightseeing trip, but for those who don’t object to a quick Metro ride, this inconvenience may be balanced by the modern hotel facilities and proximity to the beach.  We would be very happy to return.",4,2012,09,08
36,Very impressed!,"We booked the Hilton Diagonal for a one-night stay before starting our cruise.  We used our Hilton points plus a little bit of money to book the room so I didn't expect much.  The staff at the front desk treated us like we had spent $1,000 on the room!  They couldn't have been nicer or more helpful.  The young gentleman at the front desk didn't even wait for us to ask before he pulled out a map and gave us some suggestions of what we could do in the short time while we were there.  The rooom we stayed in was great also.  Very clean and a beautiful view.  I wish we were treated this well when we visits Hiltons in the U.S.!",5,2012,09,08
36,Expected more from a Hilton,"We spent 4 nights at the Hilton. The location of the hotel was outside the main tourist places, but was good for the beach which was just a few minutes walk. Also the Diagonal Mar shopping complex was located directly opposite and this had some reasonable restaurants at reasonable prices and some good shopping. The metro El Maresme on L3 was easily located a few minutes walk away and we could get into the centre without any issues.

The Hotel room was ok ( Room 1115) with sea views and clean although did come back one day at 4pm to still find the room had not been made up yet.

Breakfast for us was the most disappointing part of our stay. For a Hilton hotel the service was not good at all. Not once during our stay were we actually offered tea of coffee after being seated, and we had to call several times before we were brought any. One morning I actually got up and walked to the waiter station and brought back a large jug of coffee. (I was told off  for that) The hot buffet was ok but the same each day.

Spent one late afternoon around the pool in the sun, service around the pool was good.

Would I stay there again? no,  it would not be my first choice for a Barcelona trip. It was not the most welcoming hotel, and have stayed at many others which have been. Expected more from a Hilton Hotel.",3,2012,09,07
36,4**** hotel,"Great hotel, bedrooms very clean and tidy and so was bathroom.  Free top range products in the bathroom.  Room cleaned everyday.  No english speaking channels on tv apart from CNN (news) and the odd other programme, not that you go to Barcelona to watch tv, but if getting ready or have children does help at little.

Breakfast had a great range to suit all needs and requirements.  Fresh fruit, cereal, fully cooked breakfast, (though hot food was the same every day).  Asked for a banana and said that they would be here tomorrow but none arrived.

Opposite a vast indoor shopping centre which is open til late into the night.  Bus stop 5 mins walk and the beach 5 mins walk.  Beach is clean and sandy.  10 min walk to tram and tube stop  The hotel is approx 20 mins from the centre of Barcelona so you do need to use public transport to get everywhere, but there are some great deals on travel cards to suit all needs..

WORD OF WARNING they ask for your credit card at reception when booking in, no different we thought from any other hotel, but BE AWARE they take 50 euros for every night you are booked in from your card and then put it back on 7 days later.  We were booked in for 4 nights, so immediately they took 200 euros, before we had even been given the key to our room.  When you check in tell them you don't have a credit card!!  This is where the hotel is so much more geared to the business traveller.",4,2012,09,05
36,"Good, but could be way better for a Hilton","Far from the center of Barcelona, but metro was a block away and easy to use.  It was close to the beach so that was a plus. Clean, spacious rooms. My issue was service.  No concierge which was crazy since we were there for a conference. The lines at the front desk were long every day, all day so it was hard to get help.  No bellhop available at check in or check out so we did all our own luggage. Breakfast was good, but they literally shut it down at 11. So when they say it is served until 11; they mean you better get there by 10:30 to sit and eat.  I was drinking tea at  11:05 and most of the food was gone!  No towels to borrow for the beach and the towel service at the pool was horrible. The 4x we were at the pool we had to walk in the cabana and just get our own. I just expected better service from a Hilton. We are well traveled and have stayed at Hilton's before and this was our worst experience. Don't pay for internet if you stay here. They have free Wi-Fi at the mall across the street and it is a 1 minute walk and the connection is so much faster than in the room.",3,2012,09,05
36,Modern & Clean - Near Beach but a Metro Ride away from Better Action,"Nice hotel for those used to Hilton comforts. Rooms were large with nice views and excellent bathrooms (typically a shower and a separate tub with awesome water pressure). The included buffet breakfast consisted of an excellent spread of breads, cheeses, fruits, cereals, salads, and hot items. Staff were professional and amenities such as the pool, gym, and location to mall/beach were excellent.

Some areas for improvement and suggestions:
The pool area closes at 8:00 pm which seems to be rather early for a city like Barcelona. The pool area has a lot of concrete and could use some additional umbrellas, trees, etc to enhance the atmosphere. I would also recommend a separate concierge desk. Although the front desk staff were very helpful, there was often a wait to speak with them given people were checking in, etc. Lastly, our room was very close to the housekeeping closet. We could hear nonstop opening and closing of doors. Made it difficult to sleep when recovering from a flight. Finally, our room (on the 5th floor) had a smell like smoke although we were assured it was non-smoking.

For those choosing a hotel in Barcelona be mindful that this hotel caters more to business travelers and is about a 20 minute metro ride to the center of the city where most tourist attractions are. That being said, the metro and cabs are always widely available and inexpensive. The hotel is across from a large mall which has a grocery store and restaurants. The metro stop is about a 5-10 minute walk away. The beach isn't the best but is close and has a nice atmosphere. The area is definitely more quiet than other parts of the city and it can be difficult to find places to eat nearby if you are looking for something other than the mall restaurants or tapas bars.",4,2012,09,03
36,Ho Hum Hilton,"My husband and I spent a week in Barcelona and selected the Hilton Diagonal Mar based on its location close to the beach.  We arrived to to a lackluster greeting by the hotel staff and a lackluster lobby with stained and worn carpet at the entrance door and in common areas of the hotel.  The room was clean and comfortable and we appreciated the proximity to the beach, Metro station, and a shopping mall.  Beware of reviews of hotel restaurant ""Indigo""  that describe it as a gem. The restaurant was an enormous disappointment , failing to deliver on the promised ocean view and offering very standard hotel faire.  This area of the city is a residential neighborhood and would benefit tremendously from a special restaurant.  We encourage the hotel to explore a relationship with one of the city's many amazing chefs following the trend of upscale hotels in other parts of the city.  The hotel was also a bit short on amenities.  We asked and were provided with a power converter and missed having outlets in the room and having to rotate use of the one outlet. Much to our disappointment wireless access was provided as part of the room charge and the daily fees were hefty and required for each device.  A laptop was set up at the front desk to accommodate printing of boarding passes and linked to a sloooowwww printer that worked intermittently.  The hotel did not have concierge assistance and was unable to assist in recommending restaurants, dinner reservations or troubleshooting when our flight home was cancelled.  The staff struggled even to help hail a cab from across the hotel lawn.",2,2012,09,03
36,Review of Diamond Member,"Dear Hilton,
              if you are reading this review, then I hope you take it very seriously, because we stayed in all Hilton hotels through Europe from category 5 to Category 7, including Paris, Berlin, Rome, Vienna, Zurich, etc. This hotel has amazing location - right on the beach and the rooms are good, but the food in this hotel is one of the worst we ever had in Hilton,even in category 5 hotels. Actually, I think category 5 had better food selection than in Barcelona. We have no complaints, except of the food, but it is very important. We love Hilton hotels and provide this review not to complain, but to get your attention to this important matter. We couldn't understand how it is possible to run out of food and breakfast was terrible. Other than that everything was good, but please do something about the food or downgrade it to Category 5 or 6, so that it's not misleading for Hilton members.

Thank you!",3,2012,09,02
36,"Great hotel, great city","Very good hotel, rooms are spacious and clean. The king size bed was very comfortable. The AC is efficient and noiseless.

Breakfast is a buffet in the first floor. Many dishes are available, even some chinese ones. Regarding the breakfast, the only ""con"" is the number of people taking the breakfast when get there around 9. That means that this is definitely not cosy but in spite of the number of table to attend to, the staff is very friendly and efficient. 

All the members of the staff I have to deal with spoke spanish, english and sometime french.

The location is very nice close to the Diagonal Mar shopping center and within walking distance of the beach. If you plan to visit Barcelona, this hotel is a little bit far from the city center.",5,2012,09,02
36,“Outstanding” Great Location & Great Service,"Great location, clean quiet and comfortable. Short walk to the metro and close to the beach. The staff are professional and very helpful specially Marlene who guided us, how and where to visit.

Stayed 14 Nights with my wife and 4 year daughter who enjoyed a lot from swimming pool and trampoline was in shopping center in front of the hotel.We were extremely happy with our stay.",5,2012,08,31
36,"Great hotel, great pool, great food, next to shopping centre, park & beach.","We stayed here for 3 nights beginning of Aug, that is myself, my Husband & our 3 year old. We had a corner king room which was very spacious with large bath & seperate shower. You could laze in the bath & look out the window! Our 3 year old had a cot which was larger than normal & she fit perfectly.
The pool was fabulous with free towels, there is a seperate kids pool. The only downfall, the price of 2 beers was 16 euros!
Got a taxi from airport which cost 30 euros, the hotel is in an ideal location, opposite a shopping centre with plenty of restaurants & a supermarket. Its next to a beautiful park & also the beach.  You can also walk to the metro & tram.
We had room service & the food was lovely.
My only negative about this hotel was there were no porters to help with the bags & the queue for check in was ridiculous even for hilton members & the price of drinks.
Would definitely stay again but purchase some wine first from the supermarket!",5,2012,08,29
36,Very comfortable,"Stayed here for a couple of nights at the end of a trip as a family of 5 - we had stayed right in the centre at the start for a contrast.  It was a special deal at a good rate (otherwise it would have been out of our price range).

It's not cosy, clearly geared towards business/conventions, but very comfortable rooms.  Reception staff were a bit plastic - very friendly until we actually asked for something.  We had two rooms on the 8th floor with lovely views over the city - the rooms were interconnecting with a mini-hallway so it was just like having our own suite.

Short walk to the beach (if you like city beaches).  We passed on breakfast (20 euros each!) and found plenty of options in the shopping center across the road.  

Pool was nice, fine for us with bigger kids but would not suit a smaller family as it is quite deep (probably aimed more at execs ploughing up and down before spending someone else's money at the bar).  Drinks not cheap here, but hey - I'm on holiday.

It's a tough call to say whether I would choose this over being right in the centre - probably comes down to personal choice, and how mush you like using Metro systems or buses.

Two gripes:

Paying for wi-fi.  This really pisses me off.

At times the lifts were really slow.  We walked down from the 8th floor on several occasions, but were not tempted to walk up.",4,2012,08,28
36,"Great Hotel close to the beach, shopping mall and great pool!","My partner and I stayed at the Hilton Diagonal for three nights and we would stay again!  We got to the hotel around 12pm and I would say we had to wait ages to check in with only two staff at the desk.  One person complained and the lady said the que is normally to the door so this was obviously normal.  I must say when we checked out we had to que again for ages which is not really on.

Once we checked in we went straight to the pool and it was a lovely area where we just sunbathed and took a swim.  We were able to go to our room at just after 2pm and it was ready.  The room was a relaxation room and was nothing spectacular for me.  The king size bed was comfortable and the bathroom had a Jacuzzi tub and a separate shower.  There was also a TV to watch from the bath which was nice.  We had a great view of the sea and the beach. The room was fine for us.

The location was perfect for us as the beach was a 10 minute walk which we did every day and there was a large shopping mall across the road with a lots of places to eat, a supermarket and lots of shops if you wanted to indulge in some retail therapy.  For dinner and drinks we would get a taxi to Port Olympia or close to the Marina which was about 10 Euros there.",4,2012,08,28
36,Great hotel on the beach,"I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel.

The hotel has a very nice executive lounge for Diamond members, and they serve great breakfasts, snacks during the day.  Diamond members also get a choice of eating breakfast in the main restaurant, which is pretty elaborate.  Of course Diamond members also receive free internet.  The hotel has a nice pool, and is a short walk from the beach.  The hotel is also across the street from a shopping center that has several restaurants.",5,2012,08,27
36,Amazing hotel,"Me and a fried stayed here for 2 nights we chose this hotel because being from England you can't really go wrong with the Hilton, the hotel was very reasonably priced. The room was bigger than expected and the bed was even bigger, the bathroom had everything we needed and the view was stunning. The staff at this hotel were very helpful pointing us in the right direction for food, metro, sights, tours and the beach. We took full advantage of the pool and deck area on both days. We had a late flight but and early check out, the staff allowed us to extend our check out time free of charge and also offered us a place to freshen up in the afternoon after our day of sight seeing, this also had a shower and again was free of charge. Even thought this hotel was 20 mins from the city centre it was definitely worth it because it was peaceful. We will definitely be coming back next year for a few more days than before. Thank you Hilton",5,2012,08,27
36,good location in Barcelona,"My husband and I stayed in this very busy hotel, it is conveniently located, if you want to spend time on the beautiful beaches it is less than a 5minute walk to the beach, and on route if you use the The Barcelona Tour bus ( which I highly recommend ).
The staff was very helpful ( and recommended great restaurants to us), hotel was clean and the breakfast was good. Although being July a very busy season, the staff was very accomodating to all your needs and the english was very good  in the hotel as well as through out Barcelona so that really was great.
Directly opposite the hotel is a tiny shopping mall and attached is some good affordable restaurants.",4,2012,08,27
36,Great hotel,"Great hotel in Barcelona. Good location near shops, restaurants and bars.
Excellent services and rooms as usual in a Hilton hotel. If you have a Hilton card you can bring friends for free drinks and snacks inside the hotel.
Diagonal avenue is very busy during the day, but calm during the night. So no noise will disturb you.",5,2012,08,26
36,Possibly the best pool in Barcelona,"We have stayed here twice now, for 2 nights last August and 1 night this August (after 6 nights at the Barcelona Princess Hotel). Last year we had a travel zoo deal and got a room for 2 nights at a good rate. The hotel is nice and clean and the staff polite and friendly, we ate in both the lobby and pool bars, both nice if not a little pricey, but as we were only there one night we thought why not!. We had breakfast for both stays and there was plenty of choice with all types of breakfasts, very enjoyable, the coffee was very weak, which was a let down for my partner.  The pool is the making of this hotel, with a nice atmosphere, plenty of space and sunbeds and shade, and the delicious cocktails are worth a mention. We only stayed one night this time as the prices to stay are extravagant to say the least, and this year in being able to compare the services and touches to another similarly rated hotel, it pains me to say overpriced. Overall a gorgeous hotel and if money was not an object...but the diagonal mar is on my list of all time favourite hotels, purely for the poolside experience. The area and location are lovely with the great supermarket in the mall opposite and beaches are within walking distance, the city centre is a 12 euro taxi ride away and the Olympic village is a 15 minute 2 euro tram ride away, with another beach and plenty of restaurants. I was excited to go back to this hotel, and certainly would recommend it.",4,2012,08,26
36,Great place for a great holiday,"I stayed here a few days and I should admit that this hotel can make you happy more than the lost of luxuries hotels all around the world. Staff is wonderful. They are very friendly and try to do their best to satisfy guests' needs. Location and all products are perfect. I am sure that whenever I visit Barcelona, Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona will be the only place where I would like to stay again in this great city.",5,2012,08,25
36,Lovely view and large rooms,"Nice, quiet, relaxing pool area. lots of lounge chairs and an outdoor large size chess set. Clean swimming pool. 

Rooms are large and well kept. The bathroom is also very nice. We were three people (a child under 10) in the room and they had provided an extra bed for the child. the website was a bit vague about the availability of extra beds for kids; they had the bed and a stack of extra towels ready when we checked in. They provided bathrobes and slippers; nice touch.  

The view is fantastic. We saw our cruise ship sale away with new passengers. 

A very short walk to the beach. Easy to find taxis to the airport. There is a mall across the street.",5,2012,08,24
36,A room with a view!,"When you have the occasion to visit Spain's capital, this is a hotel to think about. It isn't situated in the center and for that reason alone it's worth a dime... I had luck that my room was upgraded to a room with a view on the meditterian sea, situated near the top floor. The curtains never went down during my stay...",4,2012,08,24
36,Nice Hotel Customers Secondary,"Stayed 5th August for 3 nights 2 Rooms. Complimentary tea / coffee available in rooms (both), sadly no kettle in either. Asked 3 times for kettle to no avail.
Prudentail (ICIS)Conference in Hotel, as result spent Breakfasts in corridor, mass of people blocking path to buffet and similar on way back to table. Maitre D ( female american ) aware of our plight,but not concerned. Worst experience I have ever had in Hotel for Breakfast.
Lifts constantly congested, 3 times waited in excess of 20 minutes to get in only to go up and down, again mass of people.
I did contact Hotel to express my concerns including Director no response received, it would seem to be the case that Enrique only responds to positive comments.
Hotel location good but in terms of Customer Service I would suggest looking elsewhere.
Bill Trotter, 2 Rooms 4 people. I do not hide behind being anonymous.
Go to Barcelona often, but will stick to other Hotels not Hilton.",2,2012,08,21
36,Amazing hotel,"Really great hotel with helpful and friendly staff. The rooms were very well laid out and the lady who cleaned them extremely patient with us as we got up very late most days! I loved how it was a bit out of the bustle of the centre and a taxi ride was about 12 euros with taxis constantly around. I have been to Barcelona lots of times before so we were there mainly to relax, enjoy the weather, visit good restaurants and bars and this location was a perfect base for us, if you are sight seeing you may well want to be closer to the action. Pool and outside area is really beautiful and well maintained, only small criticism I'd make is that it would have been nice to have service rather than having to go up to the bar.

If the manager of the hotel is reading this please get someone who speaks English as their first language to check your bar menu before you reprint them, you have some really awful typos!!!",5,2012,08,20
36,Beautiful Property,"We stayed here for one night after a cruise, it was absolutely beautiful. The rooms were roomy and nicely decorated. You are very far removed from the tourist area, but only minutes from the beach. The pool / lounge area was very nice. The staff were very accommodating to our requests. There is a huge shopping mall right across the street that has restaurants as well, about ten minutes away is a metro stop.",5,2012,08,18
36,Great hotel with such helpful staff,"Stayed 4 nights in this wonderful hotel while meeting friends from Sydney who were celebrating their 54th wedding anniversary.  They were very spoilt with champagne and anniversary cake on their arrival.  Couldn't fault the service - staff were incredible - so helpful and courteous.  Breakfasts were awesome!  Room incredibly clean and with a great view - we were on the 22nd floor!  Drinks at the hotel, as is often the case, were expensive.

Close to the beach.  Good bus service into the city from opposite the Hotel.  Looked like a good shopping centre opposite though we're not shopaholics!

Toured the city on an open top bus and decided which attractions we wanted to return to - recommend a 2 day pass for this purpose - senior rate offered which we didn't know about.",5,2012,08,17
36,Fantastic.... Hilton as its best!,"Stayed in this hotel for 3 nights from 12th August - 15th August. 
What can I say, fantastic, Hilton hotels always seem to be perfect! 
Check in was quick and easy and we were into our room before you knew it, we were on the 12th floor, so had some magnificent views over the city, and onto the beautiful beach that Barcelona boasts. 
The room, was huge, really well cleaned, and comfortable. The bathroom had a window what you could look out of when you was in the bath, which was very relaxing! 
The staff are very kind and nothing seems to be to much trouble, they have always got a smile on their faces and are very welcoming. 
Having stayed in many hiltons in my previous years, this is one of the top... Very well done. 
There is a massive shipping centre across the road, and the beach is only a 5 minute walk away. A taxi rank sits to the left of the hotel, which is very useful! Hotel is not far from the airport, about 25 minutes cab ride. 
The pool area is beautiful, it is on the second floor and on a lovely terrace area! Loved it! 
My only two negatives are... The breakfast could do with some work, picked up a few hash browns one morning, and they were as solid as rock, not the best food for my teeth. 
And the wi-fi is quite expensive, but not ridiculous. But you get that wherever you go, Hilton or not. 
Thank you very much for furnishing us with a very comfortable stay, we hope to return in the near future! ",5,2012,08,16
36,A real Hilton,"We had a pleasant stay, me and my son, for 10 nights in august in Hilton Diagonal Mar and all I can say about this hotel it's that's nothing I can complain about. The room was spacious and clean, the same for the bathroom, big tv set on which we enjoyed every day watching the London olympics, breakfast very good with plenty of choices. The location of the hotel is excellent, close to the beach, in front of a mall where you can do your shopping and close to the subway station and tram sation. The staff at the reception desk, very helpfull, exception make the ladies working in the morning that I found a kind of moody sometimes and less efficient than the guys working in the afternoon. As about the taxi drivers you can find around the corner, it's better to negociate the price to the airport before, if not, they have a strange way to read the counter, adding some extra euros to the total amount. Or, if you don't have heavy luggages it's very easy to get to the airport by public transportation.",4,2012,08,16
36,Excellent beach hotel...,"We have just returned, from an excellent stay at the Hilton. We stayed for my wife's birthday and we were not disappointed...
Everything was 1st class as others have stated..
The metro was close and easy to use..
The only draw back was the cost of food and beverages!!
8 euros for a 400ml plastic glass of beer!! No thank you!
But still a great stay..",5,2012,08,15
36,"Excellent Hotel, Good Location","At check-in we were given a map of Barcelona and were shown all the modes of transportation available and key points of interest - which was very helpful. We decided on the ""Hop On, Hop Off"" bus which was only one block away.

The hotel was very clean and tidy, staff helpful and friendly.

The hotel is a few minutes walk from the beach and is directly across from a useful shopping centre. You can pick up anything you forgot or need here and the top floor has numerous restaurants catering to all budgets and tastes.

Along the hotel is a taxi rank where there is always a taxi available.

We used the outdoor pool more often than the beach which was perfect for the ""little one"" as there is both an adult pool and a children's pool. It can get a bit busy however. Food and drinks are also available at the pool which were quite pricey.

Breakfast was very satisfactory as it catered for everyones tastes, ie: full english, cereals, fruits, cold meats, croissants etc... Again it was quite busy. Dinner was relaxing and quiet, the food was prepared perfectly but their childrens menu lacked choice and didn't exactly seem child oriented.

The hotel is a good distance from the hustle of the city centre which makes it perfect for those who want a quiet stay - with easily access to the city centre. Will return again.",5,2012,08,15
36,Superb Location and Service,"Our stay at the Diagonal Mar confirmed why Hilton Hotels are our preferred choice worldwide and restored our confidence in the brand following recent stays at other hotels in the group when the standard of service was not up to expectation. The hotel is located across the street from a huge shopping mall that has a wonderful selection of places to eat. The hotel is spacious, has a fantastic lounge area, poolside facilities, excellent bedrooms and staff throughout who provide the Hilton service that was the companies trademark. We booked the hotel for a one night stay prior to joining a cruise from Barcelona and we will be returning for a longer stay so that we can enjoy the many attractions that are close to the hotel including the beach area and Diagonal Mar Parc.",5,2012,08,12
36,useful hotel,"Hilton diagonal mar is very useful hotel as a tourist not only for 5 star benefit available. Being a tourist look many aspects. Best of them just 5 minutes walking to Beautiful sea beach, just in front of hotel big shopping mall. In hotel rooms are very big in both side building have great view.
Overall very good hotel with all amenities.",5,2012,08,11
36,More of a Neighborhood Feel,"Had an enjoyable stay.  My room overlooked the ocean and found it very comfortable.  It was large by European standards and a had nice bathroom.  The beach is a couple of blocks away, but opted for a couple of hours at the pool instead.  There's a nice large pool deck with plenty of lounge chairs.

For HHonors Gold or higher members, you will likely be upgraded to an Executive Room.  There's a great lounge with outdoor seating that has great views of the city, water and hills.  It's a great place to start your morning with breakfast, after your siesta snack and cocktails or just a place to sit and relax after sightseeing.  There's a ton of seating and a couple of computers for guest use.  It was nice to print up maps and directions.

Getting to and from all the sights of Barcelona are easy on public transportation, but will be a 15-20 minute ride.  Instead of always taking the subway, take the streetcar which is clean, new and faster than I expected.  You'll be able to see more of the sites.  It's a nice ride.  The streetcar and subway stops are just outside the Diagonal Mar Mall which has lots of restaurants and shopping.  (I took public transportation from the airport.  It wasn't easy, but once I was at the hotel, I relied totally on public transporation.)  I hit the grocery store to make some last minute Spanish wine purchases to take home.

If you like being the heart of the action, this place wouldn't be for you.  However, I loved being able to have access to the beach, a nice pool, having a more neighborhood feel and the parklike atmosphere of the Diagonal Mar area.  There were so many tourists at all the major sights, it was nice to get away from it all.",5,2012,08,11
36,"Good Hotel, a little far from the action","I have stayed with my family in two inter-connecting rooms.  The hotel has well maintained rooms, with plenty of light in all rooms.  This is an advantage for this hotel.  The major issue is the fact that this hotel stays in a modern part of Barcelona, about 5-10 km outside the city center.  It is quite close to the beach, if you are planning to go there.  The swimming pool is also a pleasant feature, although the water is quite cold -- even for a quite warm summer day. There is also a great shopping mall across the street from the hotel, where you can grab your breakfast from major chains (starbucks, dunking donuts...) at a fraction of the price from the hotel.",4,2012,08,09
36,"Great Hotel, internet is a challenge","As so many other raving reviews of this hotel indicate, it is a great hotel at a top location.
Across the street the biggest shopping mall of Barcelona, at 5 minutes walk the beach, the beautifull Diagonal Mar Parc at 2 minutes with ponds and playgrounds set around masterpieces of modern buildings.
Taxi, metro, but, tram it's all right there and inside the hotel helpful staff, well equipped comfortable rooms and a super-size swimming pool with an extensive leisure area. Because the boulevard on the beach offers 10 km of jogging we didn't use the gym which looked great.

The challenge of our 10 night stay was the internet. I've seen that almost every other review mentions the high cost of internet (27 euros per day or 108 for a week) but if you are equipped with a notebook, a tablet and 2 smart phones then the cost can run up to 54 euros per 24 hours.
And if you pay the week-rate of 107, then you still have to pay 27 per day for the next 3 days.
We did not connect our 4 appliances - we found the cost too high. During the first week I managed to get 3 of them working on 1 username and password; when I had to renew that trick didn't work anymore - (the documentation mentions it's only for 1 connection).
Oh yeah, even if you have paid internet via your room bill in advance, you still have to re-login every day. I don't understand why.

Here is the good news and my reason to give this review 5 stars: right after my stay the hotel emailed me to do an on-line survey. I outlined my complaints about internet and the general manager mailed me back and arranged a better deal on my internet expenses. Thank you!
Nevertheless, I think that in this time of smart phones and tablets a hotel like the Hilton should give all your computers internet access for 1 reasonable price, - or better - for free like the majority of hotels do. I hope the internet-challenge will be solved next time when I come to my favorite city Barcelona.",5,2012,08,08
36,Great location,"My husband and I stayed here for one week for our honeymoon. My husband phoned prior to our arrival to let them know it was our honeymoon and when we arrived we had a complimentary bottle of cava and chocolate covered strawberries, which was lovely. The hotel is situated outside of the city centre which is ideal, it meant that it got the lovely sea breeze to keep temperatures a bit fresher. The metro station is just a few blocks away, approx a 10 minute walk. There is also a taxi park just outside the hotel, we used this a lot to get to Port Olimpic, were there ere lots of very nice restaurants, we only paid about 7 euros each way for this. There is also a tram line close by, so you are spoiled for choice as to how you explore Barcelona. The swimming pool on the roof terrace is a good size and there were always plenty of sun loungers. The room itself was a good size, but for a five star hotel I would have expected something a little more luxurious as well as a better television, it was quite old and the remote control played up which was a bit annoying. Also we felt that the films at 14 euros a go were overpriced. I know all hotels inflate their prices but we felt that the mini bar and the hotel bar were too expensive in comparison to other hotels we have stayed in. This is the same issue for the wifi, but if you go across the road to the Diagonal Mar shopping centre, you get it for free! The bedroom and bathroom was very clean and our towels replaced daily. Breakfast was really good, everything you could possibly want was on offer, however it did get very busy during the late morning which meant that sometimes things ran out and were not replaced quickly and there were not always plates ready which was a bit annoying. The concierge on the front desk could not have been more helpful in helping us explore the city, they were always friendly and very knowledgeable. In conclusion, we had a very good stay here and we would stay here again.",4,2012,08,08
36,Great Hotel,"This hotel is located so well near the beach, metro, diagonal mar shopping centre opposite the hotel which has lots of eating places. Loved the Italian on the corner of the square!.
Hotel breakfast was brilliant - the staff specially there are just so so helpful and making sure all guests are well catered for. All in all suberb hotel, staff, location, cleaniness, rooms nice and big, and cant wait to go back! Thank You",5,2012,08,08
36,"No soul, but comfortable.","Do people really go to Barcelona to be near the beach? judging by the numbers of American and European tourists we met at the Diagonal Mar, evidently, yes. We're from Miami, Florida and European beaches hold little attraction for us-- we stayed here only because our son got us three nights for free with his hilton honors points. We knew going in that this hotel was essentially a ""businessman's"" hotel, utterly lacking in the charm or any of the characteristics that would make you think you are not in the US.(Oh yes the front desk people speak Spanish but we met no Spaniards staying there--lots of northern Europeans and americans though.) It is located relatively far from  the center of town, near the beach, in what passes for a modern neighborhood devoid of any character, and certainly not terribly pedestrian friendly(meaning, that aside from the collossal  american style shopping mall across the street and the beach, there's nowhere you'd want to walk to nearby, or could because of the distances.)Our stay was one day at the start of a 12 day trip to southern France and two days at the end.On our first day we were given all the privileges and perks our son was entitled to(free food, alcohol on the exec floor , key card for our elevator floor/top floor room etc) on the second stay, we were told we werent eligible for such treatment-entirely a function of the check in clerk(our son had warned us of this-technically we weren't, but didnt care). The room s  on each stay were huge, immaculate and comfortable-the front desk staff ranged from tremendously helpful and friendly, to distant, abrupt and distinctly unhelpful.Many know little about Barcelona--the concierge is usually a better bet for information and assistance. After 10 days in small hotels in France where the owners or desk personnel took a personal interest in our well being, the contrast was palpable.This is a generally efficiently  run, comfortable hotel in a big city where a 10 euro cab ride-or less on the metro-will get you to the heart of town and the Barcelona we went for.Would we spend the 300 or so euros a night for the comforts of this place? NO, especially since you can get such luxe at other hotels closer in.But, if you have the hilton points, or prefer the big city hilton style and can afford the executive amenities, this place is fine--but expect they'll still charge you 27 euros for wi fi(we heard lots of complaints from hilton platinum types who should have had it for free but didnt get it-we went across the street to the mall where it was free) and 34 euros a day to park your car(we managed to avoid that-even though we did valet park our rental car there-email me if you want the details) and the outrageous charges for calls home(we had an emergency-and did not have our own cell phones).My 4 star rating is a reflection of our sensibilities--when we travel, we like to stay in a hotel, or b and b that has the local flavor, and that when you step outside, you know immediately that you are somewhere foreign, in a different environment.Inside and outside at the Diagonal Mar, you could be at a soul-less luxury  Hilton anywhere.But there are lovely views of Barcelona--in the distance. For comfort and amenities, it gets  5 star rating, but you can find that elsewhere at similar rates closer to the life of Barcelona-and feel like youre in a foreign country.This is not intended as a ""complaint""-we stayed for free, and cabs were cheap enough-just an explanation why in our book it gets 4 not 5 stars-your mileage, as they say, may vary.",4,2012,08,05
36,Fantastic,"This ultra-modern, sleek hotel has it all:  three blocks from the beach and four blocks from a metro station that makes the entire city easily accessible.  Staff are knowledgeable, helpful, and friendly.  Hotel is immaculate.  Executive lounge is first rate with a lovely terrace with great city views.  A first-class establishment all the way.",5,2012,08,05
36,Pay a little extra for so much more,"Our second stay in this hotel, you can see my review from last July. This time we went for an executive room, which took this hotel to a whole new level for us. Access to the lounge for breakfest, drinks and snacks.. but also help with late check out all can be done in the lounge, including check out.. saves time and hassel. Staff were fantastic.. everyday,... th only bad comment about the hotel is the stupid prices charged for the internet connection... 22 euros per hou, 27 euros for 24 hours (can't be split) or 107 euros for 7 days. Tip walk across the road to the shopping center, it's free ! 
All the rest is perfect ! well done Hilton !",5,2012,08,01
36,A fabulous stay,"Stayed in Hilton Diagonal Mar for 5 nights in July, last week. I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. The staff are exceptionally friendly & helpful. Our room was superb. We had every facility in the hotel. The terrace & pool area is fantastic as is the health & fitness area & sauna. One downfall was the lack of free wi fi. Also the location is fantastic. Give or take it's approx 10 mins outside of Barcelona city centre so you don't have that oppressive heat. The Diagonal Mar area gets a coastal breeze so it's never stifling. There's a beach approx 5  mins walk away which is that little bit quieter than the Barceloneta / town beaches. TheDiagonal Mar Shopping Mall is opposite the hotel, the largest shopping mall in Spain. Also, it might be a v simple point but the breakfasts in the hotel are amazing! Every nationality is catered for. Cannot wait until I return again!",5,2012,07,29
36,not bad but too expensive,"The hotel is very good, no doubt about it. 
But the minute you check-in you are victim of the system that is called 'milking out the customer'. Nothing wrong with making revenue of course but it's just too obvious. Everything you touch or ask for is just overpriced. More than € 20,-- for a breakfast is just too much for Spain. And € 27,-- per day for having Wifi access to your own I-pad and a laptop is just crazy. Just across the road is a shopping mall and there it's just free. The drinks in the bar, the water in the room, the snacks in the poolbar: it's all overpriced.
The Diagonal Mar mall has plenty of options for eating but only opening at 10 AM (11 on Sundays), so no good for an early breakfast. There are a few places on the beach, opening at 9.00 AM for breakfast and affordable.
Location is o.k. as a 5 minutes walk to the El Maresme metro station (yellow line) plus another 5 minutes in the train will bring you in downtown.  
The bottomline: it's not a bad choice as long as you just use it for sleeping. And enjoying the pool as it's one of the best pools in a city hotel that I've ever seen.",3,2012,07,29
36,A Beach Resort in Barcelona,"Arranged a 5 day/ 4 night stay as a surprise for my wife's 50th birthday. She had wanted a beach break and I fancied a city break - well, Diagonal Mar Hilton gives you the ability to have BOTH !!

I had sent an email to the General Manager requesting an upgrade for this special occassion. When we arrived we were advised that we had been upgraded to a ""Relaxation Room"" with a seaview on the 14th floor.

When we came to the room, the hotel had very kindly supplied a bottle of cava on ice, and a very nice tasting birthday cake with personal inscription for my wife - a very nice touch and well appreciated.

The room is decorated in ""soothing"" colours, with a large desk/ working area (not really needed on this holiday - but a nice touch). The King size bed was super comfortable and the leather lounge chair with footrest was the most comfortable chair ever - wish I could have shipped it home!

Bathroom has a jacuzzi with a TV - superb! A very nice seperate shower stall is also provided and had very good water pressure (this can be lacking in many european hotels).

As others have indicated, there are some office buildings that block your direct view of the sea - but all one has to do is turn their head an inch to the right or left - and viola - what a view !!

Very wide choice of food for breakfast - fresh Orange juice served to you at your table - and if you request, you can have proper espresso, cappuccino, etc instead of the very americanised coffee (ie weak) served. Smoke salmon was particularly nice as was the iberian ham. 

The first 2 days we just chilled out by the fabulous pool and the nearby beach - plenty of deck chairs and umbrellas - and the hotel provides towels at the pool. Even at midday no problem to do laps in the pool - its not crowded - water temp was perfection - and the view is stunning !

The beach is an easy 5 minute walk - it may not have the charm on a beach with a cove in the Algarve - but it's an extremely clean beach with fine sand. Alot less crowded than the beach near Vila Olympic and Barconaleta. There is a small cafe/bar at the beach which served as our daily lunch spot. Quite nice food, and given that it's smack on the beach - not all that dear at say EUR 10 each, including wine. We also had early evening cocktails served to us at our chairs on the beach - very enjoyable.

Our first night we ate just across the street in the outside area of the shopping mall - on the right hand side there are 3 restaurants - the middle one is called La Casa del Pescado (The Fish House). Once seated, you really dont feel like you're in a shopping zone - it was very nice and relaxing. I was very pleasingly surprised at the quality of the food - order the mussels to start - a HUGE pot of i would say 20/25 mussles in a spicy tomato based broth, followed by grilled prawns - seafood heaven !! For those not into seafood, for the ""bargain cost"" of only EUR 8, my wife had a half roast chicken which was cooked to perfection. With wine and after dinner drinks, the bill was EUR 42 - excellent value.

As others have mentioned, easy to get into Barca centre with the metro - although I did not do it myself, right outside the hotel the bus 41 will take you straight into centre. There is also a tram that stops on the Av Diagonal on the opposite side of the mall - I took this to the last stop (10 minutes) to Vila Olympic - great place to visit.

Our second night for dinner, we went to Sitges - this is the most delightful seaside town about 45 minutes by train from Barcalona. From the hotel, take a taxi (EUR 8) to Estacion de Franca (near Vila Olympic) - alot less crowded than the other 2 main stations in Barcalona and not underground - you get to station, buy ticket, and as its the 1st station, you get on board your Air con train and wait in comfort until the train leaves.

We had a lovely meal right on the seafront at Sitges - again given the position, under EUR 50 for two, including wine - quite reasonable.

Note the last train back to Barcelona is 22:25 - allow about 15 min to walk from the seafront back to the train station. Very easy to get a taxi at the station back to the hotel.

Overall we found the Hilton Diagonal Mar to be a perfect base to stay in Barcelona - great pool, 5 minutes to the beach, and when you want to ""see the sights"" of Barcelona, a quick and easy 15 min metro ride or quick taxi. In my view, a better option than staying directly in the centre of Barcelona.",5,2012,07,29
36,A great stay,"Although this hotel is a bit out of the centre, we found it easy to get into town as there are tram, bus and metro all on the doorstep in addition to the tourist bus.  The room was great, had a view to the sea and a jacuzzi bath (with confusing controls).  We arrived late due to a delayed flight but staff were friendly and helpful and went out of their way to make sure we were happy and we're knowledgeable and friendly throughout.  The shopping centre opposite was a bonus, with lots of places to eat and a great hypermarket for all those things you've forgotten to pack.",4,2012,07,28
36,July 2012 Stay,"Stayed at the Hilton Diagonal Mar earlier this month (July 8-10). Although we did not stay on the executive floor, we had access to the executive lounge by virtue of our Hilton Honors Gold membership. Arrived into Barcelona and at the hotel around 10 AM after a trans-Atlantic flight. Criseanne at check-in was most gracious and ensured our room was prepared as soon as possible, enabling us to access our room around 11:30, which helped. Rooms are well appointed. The bathrooms are quite large, especially by European standards. The best part of the hotel is it's accessibility and location. It is OFF the touristy area (read Las Ramblas, Placa Catalunya, El Born). The Hilton is located in the Forum area, across the street from a shopping center with loads of great deals, the beach (the Mediterranean Sea) is a 10 minute walk away, the Metro is 2 streets over and there is a Hop-on Hop-off (Barcelona City Tours) bus stop a few 100 yards away- a great way to see the city!
The best part of the hotel is the executive lounge- great sweeping views of the city, ample breakfast (although we ate breakfast in the main restaurant which also has a sizeable buffet), and Cava available all the time- nothing like a glass of bubbly in hand while gazing over the city from the 10th floor executive lounge's outdoor deck! The executive lounge concierge, Cristobal, is a gem who goes above and beyond in terms of customer service and professionalism.
All in all, a very enjoyable stay. We would definitely stay here again.",4,2012,07,27
36,A standard Hilton,"My room was very nice, large and full of natural light. Bathroom was also large, but the shower could be a little better and more spacious. As the hotel is big, expect to sometimes wait to use the elevator.

Big downside: no free internet. But the shopping mall across the street had free wifi.

If this is your first time in Barcelona, maybe it would be better to stay in a more central location. This property is right by a good beach but far from downtown. You can easily take the subway to get to other neighborhoods, but you're likely to spend around 15-20 minutes to get to Plaza Catalunya.",4,2012,07,25
36,AMAZING!,"We had a great stay at Hilton Diagonal Mar. The service is great, rooms are clean and tidy, and the view is spectacular! The rooms come with many ammenities, and I found it quite interesting that you can ""hear"" TV by some speakers in the bathroom! 

The hotel has an outside area, with a pool and spa. 

They charge WiFi, and the breakfast is around 25 euros each, so we crossed the street to the Diagonal Mar shopping mall where there is free wifi, and a GREAT variety of restaurants! The shopping mall is a great plus! 

In the check out, we were charged for the minibar, but we didn't use anything from there! The man just said that it is automitic! Thank god we read the bill before paying! 

The diagonal Mar area is a bit further away from the main part of Barcelona, but its totaly worth staying at the Hilton.",5,2012,07,23
36,Great service and comfortable accommodations,"Just getting back from a week in Barcelona with the family, and we were based at the Hilton Diagonal Mar.  The hotel is a beautiful high rise property, about 200 meters from the beach.  We had two adjoining rooms on the 20th floor with an amazing view out to the mediterranean.  The rooms were a decent size, comfortable beds with contemporary furnishings and nice modern bathrooms.

Our choice to stay here was primarily motivated by the Hilton Honors program, since I was using points.  Having Diamond status also helped to secure upgraded rooms and access to the Executive Lounge which was very comfortable and gave us alternate options for breakfast, snacks, beverages, etc. and sitting out on the roof deck after a long day of sight-seeing in the July heat.

We found the staff to be extremely friendly and they worked hard to address any questions or concerns.

The breakfast in the restaurant was a bit inconsistent with quality of food (i.e. some hot food was cold, fruit would run out, coffee was great on some days, other days you could not tell if it was coffee or tea).  The bread and pastries were good, fruit was good, etc.  It appeared that the staff was really trying, but just overwhelmed with the onslaught of guests at certain hours of the morning.  It was free for me, so I did not mind too much.  If I had to pay for it, I probably would not have been as forgiving.  Just not really on par with other European Hiltons I have had breakfast at.

Many have commented on the location being a bit far from the main points of interest in the city.  But this actually worked out pretty well for my family and I. The metro is only 2 blocks away, and it is extremely easy, fast and inexpensive to get to most of the tourist destinations.  Otherwise there are plenty of taxis, and you generally wont spen more than 10 euro for a taxi ride. We enjoyed coming back to the hotel to swim and relax after a busy day in the city.  The pool deck is very nice and keeps the kids entertained. Also it was sort of an oasis from the tourist crowds in the early evening. There is also a mall across the street that is convenient for shops, casual tapas or an evening ice cream treat.

All in all, this hotel really was ideal for our week in Barcelona and would recommend as a good alternative to staying in the heart of the city.",5,2012,07,23
36,Best Hilton in Barcelona,"Wauw! Very nice Hilton. Shopping mall accros the street and acces to underground. Great staff, excellent executive lounge on 15 floor with great views. Nice pool! Place to go!",5,2012,07,21
36,"Comfortable, consistent Hilton yet a bit far from the action","We stayed here for 3 nights in early July 2011 on Hilton points. Since we used points, I cannot really comment on ""value for the money"", however the hotel was comfortable and breakfast was good. We had an executive suite with access to the lounge which was very nice (worth the value if you are deciding if you should pay for access). I especially enjoyed having a glass or two of complimentary wine while sitting on the outdoor patio.

Had I not been using points, I likely would have gone for something a little more central and with more character. This is your typical, consistent Hilton which was a nice way to start the trip, however if you are one to stay in a place with a ""feel"" of the city you are in, this wouldn't be for you. There were a lot of business travelers there and I feel like that is who the hotel is more geared towards. With that said, I felt safe, comfortable, and relaxed. There is a subway stop fairly close that will take you into the city. Being that we left in the morning and were in the city for pretty much the whole day, it wasn't a big deal that this was a little further away. However, we were very surprised -- especially since we heard that everyone ate dinner late in Spain -- when the front desk told us at 9:30pm that it would be very hard to find a restaurant nearby still serving dinner.

This hotel *is* situated near the beach, however we chose to go down to the Barceloneta as the beach near this hotel was a bit of a ghost town. Upon recommendation, we took a 45 minute to one hour stroll up the beach from the Barceloneta  back towards where this hotel is located (in lieu of taking public transport). It was a nice, relaxing walk and I imagine it would be even nicer to do by bike -- just an idea.

If we were back in Barcelona, we would likely look for something more in the action and with more character; however, I would not be disappointed if I were to stay here again -- especially on points! :)",3,2012,07,20
36,Best of both worlds,"My wife and I stayed at the hotel for 3 nights back in June and really enjoyed our stay. 

We had an executive floor room with access to the lounge.  I agree with others who suggest paying a bit extra for this - it has a great outdoor terrace, very good breakfast, extensive range of drinks throughout the day and tapas in the evening.

The room was spacious with a view of the sea and back across the city. We did have a minor problem with the aircon but this was addressed when raised to their attention.

The hotel is not right in the middle of the city so if you want to step right onto Las Ramblas then the hotel isn't for you, BUT I wouldn't let that deter you:
- it is 5mins from the metro,which takes you directly to Barceloneta, Las Ramblas and Sagrada Familia  in 15 minutes. 
- we didn't get a cab but that would probably take even less time
- The beach is only 5 mins walk away, 
- the shopping centre over the road has all the shops you'd need

and I expect if you were right in the centre of town you wouldn't get a good sun deck with pool and pool bar on the roof!

We were there while a conference was going on, so the lobby was full of reps, but we hadn't planned to, and didn't, spend much time hanging around there so it wasn't a problem

All in all a very enjoyable city break, so much so we are now heading back in a few weeks with our 4yo daughter so will be able to report on the family experience too!",5,2012,07,19
36,Reasonable location,"All the necessary facilities at the hotel and next to a large shopping center
Executive lounge with balcony (nice views) and good catering",4,2012,07,19
36,Expensive and far away,"The hotel itself is not bad, but is very far away from the city center. There is a stop of the double decked tourist bus very close, and by cab is not that far, but the area of the hotel is not appealing at all (there is a shopping center right in front of it but you don't feel in Barcelona at all).  I found it too expensive for what (and where) it is, the internet charges are outrageous, it is zero convenient for sight seeing or even enjoying Barcelona and has no charm at all.
Also, management and front desk are not precisely customer oriented.",3,2012,07,18
36,Flawless,"What""s not to love? Impeccable service, beautiful rooms, and only steps away from the Mediterranean. The views from the upper floors are priceless. Location is perfect. Right across from a shopping mall, and a five minute stroll from the Metro, which whisks you to La Rambla in 15 minutes. The breakfast buffet is ample, and the pool area--including the bar--is a welcome respite from touring or business. Barcelona is my favorite city in Europe: it's convenient, charming, exciting, mysterious, and at the same time, friendly and comfortable. The Hilton is a direct extension of this.",5,2012,07,18
36,Superb Hotel - ideal for short breaks,"I arrived as part of a large group on Thursday 5th July, for a four day stay. From the moment we arrived all through to check out on the Sunday we had nothing but an outstanding experience. The location is great - a stone's from the beach and 10 mins in a taxi to the city centre or the port (for bars and clubs). Moreover the hotel is opposite a large shopping centre with cafes and restaurants. The rooms were spacious and clean and the service at the front desk and from house keeping was top notch. We were fortunate enough to have executive rooms which gave us access to the executive lounge and again the service here was impeccable. If and when I visit Barcelona again I will certainly be staying at this hotel.",5,2012,07,16
36,Basic good Hilton with some important flaws,"This was my fifth visit to Barcelona and it was an conscious dedecision to stay here, even if it was far away from the city and Eixample where I usually stay during my visits to Barcelona. I highly recommend all who make the first visit, who do not care about swimming pool and the beach to stay in Eixample. However, location was good in the way we visit the town during national holiday. You have the beach lanes just right outside the hotel and it's very fresh to get some nice mediterranean air. 

Quick and not at all expensive taxi from the airport, metro just around the corner wich is safe and very on time. The lane is directly up to the stations in both old town and Eixample so there is no needs of changes.

Room was very nice, a large corner room with nice decor and all amenities you need. However, scratches in the parquet, stains on the easy chairs and curtains - just showing it is a popular property. However, the two hair we found in the bathub was not so flattering and when we reported that the heat exchanger in the bathtub wasn't working they didn't care, because it was not fixed during our entire stay. There was both walk-in shower and bathtub, so I only got one VERY hot bath, but luckely it was some of the cold april days in Barcelona. I could of course bringed that to their attention again, but it wasn't like I felt they understand the problem even if I showed the maid once upon cleaning. Shame about bathroom, it was very nice appointed and with nice standard Hilton amenities. 

Had dinner in restaurant, very talentful service and appreciate the good food. Breakfast was a shame, hugh great buffet as all Hilton but totally disorganized. The Head Waiter was going around with guest and tried to find cleared tables, he didn't find any so guest had to wait after a five minutes walk-around by other guests - and of course - I think the ones going around with him felt very awkward. We was lucky to get tables directly.  For a vacation, we might have breakfast for over an hour, and in this hour we was placed with tables around not cleared while others waiting. Waiting for coffee in 30 minutes not good that either (if I was on abusiness trip it should be an catastrophe). Problem is it was not only one unlucky day, it was the same all three days. Requested thin pancakes, fo course no problem, but after 20 minutes the waiter came back and made us dissapointed - it was not possible anyway... So fire the Breakfast Manager, hired a new who can guest experience and know how to clear a table. It was not that they was understaffed - they was just going around like chickens and don't know how to do... 

Used the Club Lounge, it was very good with several drinks, coffees and canapee´s. Nice with terrace. Swimming pool area was good and served with an lifeguard, fitness center with sauna also there very good. Nice greetings in room as a Elite HIlton Honors member as well flexible for a late check-out. All the basics are there, but if the tried harder with cleaning and breakfast - It should get a higher rate. 

I think it is a nice hotel for families and if you are on business with appointments in the area. If you going for a romantic holiday, you get for the same rate some very nice hotels in the city center with better quality and experience. I will not return to Hilton Diagonal Mar, but to Barcelona...",3,2012,07,16
36,Great comfort,"Nice hotel with excellent facilities. Good situation next to the sea while still providing easy acces to the main attractions - albeit at a distance. Executive lounge was great, wonderful terrace where you could look out over the sea or back towards the city centre and the Holy Family Basillica while enjoyed the evening sun with a glass of decent wine!",4,2012,07,14
36,Not just for business travellers,"A good Hilton but not the best.. if you wish to experience a real Hilton with superb service i would suggest the Hilton Bangkok, yes i know its a different country.

While i agree with most of the comments in respect of location which is great, next to the beach which is great also , the superb pool  with no one fighting for loungers, superb shopping etc this Hilton is a little ragged around the edges in my opinion, if you have been lucky enough to experience other Hiltons in other countries.

A bit of constructive criticism helps the management, here goes...

Breakfast- To say hectic is a bit of an understatement, the hotel should employ extra staff to provide the service that is expected.  We had to ask for the basics such as tea, coffee, juice, bread, milk. on many occasions we were overlooked and we were left wondering why??

The room, generally good however the connecting door between rooms is only ever ok if you have a family. These doors do not provide any sort of sound insulation and you can hear everything especially young children screaming early in the morning which is definitely not needed when you are trying to relax on holiday.My suggestion to the management is that if you have connecting doors between rooms you should consider that couples who wish to relax on holiday should not be neighbours of families with young children and the management should try where possible to group similar guests with similar sleeping habits.

The pool was great, but the music was definitely not background. I like jazz but 6 hours is a bit much for anyone, but i did enjoy the fela kuti ! A suggestion,  turn the volume down for those who dont want to listen to the pool music, they can listen to their own music on their own headphones.",3,2012,07,13
36,Fantastic Hilton and super friendly staff,"Arrived at the Hotel just after 1pm and as Hilton HHonors Diamond member were told that we had been upgraded to a Junior Suite. Massive room with a large living room area and seperate bedroom with windows overlooking the Med. 10/10 for the view! The all marble bathroom was lovely and well appointed with toiletries.
The Executive Lounge is superb. Complimentary soft drinks all day with beer and wine from lunchtime to 10.30pm. Canapes and Premium Spirit drinks are served for 2 hours in the evening.
The supervised pool area is of a high standard with a lovely outlook on the the Med.
As another poster mentioned the Diagonal Mar shopping centre is directly across the street. There are 3 floors of shops and eateries and also a cinema too.
Only recommendation i would make to the hotel is that in Summer there are a large number of families staying in the hotel and a kids club or supervised activities would be welcome.",5,2012,07,13
36,Great Hotel,Definitely what you would expect from a Hilton Hotel. Clean comfortable with a very attentive staff. Location is good for the beach and The Rambla.,5,2012,07,13
36,"Excellent quality, one block from beach but far from tourist center","One of my best experiences ever with a Hilton hotel. Super friendly and helpful staff. Shopping center with grocery market (on bottom floor) conveniently across the street. Oh and did I already mention that it's one block from the beach? But we didn't even go to the beach because the pool was *awesome* - swimming with a city view. Street parking is free and relatively easy to find.

Only drawback is that it's quite distant from the tourist attractions; however, it was nice to be away from the noise.",5,2012,07,12
36,"good conference facilities, over the hill floors, bad service","stayed here for a conference, which in terms of conference facility was technically and meeting room service wise well run. Ballroom is big, good acoustics, state of the art technical set up, good break preparation, excellent break out room set up and service.

Everything else, however, is so so at best. 

Guest room floor carpets and paneling are over the hill and floor 16 has a smell.
Room had half empty beverage from previous party in it, broken coat hanger in the wardrobe, which actually was hung back into the wardrobe the next day despite the fact that I had put it on the side board. 

Front desk processes were a disaster: lines, lines, and more lines...

If you happen to be only HH Silver, you may ask for whatever you want or have whatever preference in your profile, forget it! ""this is the room I give you and now get on...""

Front desk staff is not paying any attention to keeping the business and the vacationeer crowed separated in terms of room assignments: think - one group is here to party, the other has 6 am flights!

The absolute low point of service: pool bar - I have no idea what's in the job description of those boys but if you are not female you will need to coerce any drink or service out of them... Managed to sit in the pool area two afternoons for half an hour without being offered a drink.

Thus, if you consider having a conference here, go for it, but consider putting your participants in a different hotel.",3,2012,07,12
36,Great staff super friendly and helpfull,"THE GOOD
I would stay here again 100% and in fact will be in August 
Great team here( Leo in the pool bar was very on the ball) and hotel is of a high Standard 4+ to 5 star, the rooms are large with excellent bathrooms including separate shower (power) and bath, pool area and bar, with a small gym and sauna as well.
Breakfast was very good, great selection in the buffet, but still waiting on my poached eggs. 
THE BAD
VERY annoying though, they stop breakfast at 10.30 and lift all the utensils while not telling you they are doing in (stop this)
Housekeeping needs to step up as well it is intermittent and on one day they forgot to do my room at all
Oh and uncensored Gangsta Rap music round the pool not a great idea, LOL",5,2012,07,11
36,Not worth our time,"My wife and I loved Barcelona last year staying in Hotel 1898 but this year on our annual European adventure we stayed at Hilton Del Mar because of our Diamond status , we arrived on July 5 at 3.30pm and were a little surprised they said that our room would not be ready for about an hour ,considering we had it booked for over 3 months but we bit out tongue and thought we will go to the club floor for a drink , to cut a long story short our room was not ready until 7pm and there were other people in the same situation. Considering we had to leave at 4.30 am 24 hours later we felt robbed of over 600 euro. We were cranky the whole day and a half and were put in the wrong frame of mind. We are not blaming the staff obviously the buck stops with management for not having enough cleaners for the rooms. I felt like throwing my Hilton h diamond card in the garbage and although the hotel is not a bad place we will never return because of this incident. I don't think I complain often as you will see in my other reviews but I'm still upset about this incident.",1,2012,07,11
36,Nicest hotel ever!,"My wife and I stayed here only for one night after flying in from Paris and heading onto a cruise the next day.

There happened to be a street festival with millions of visitors so most hotels were fully booked and pricey.

Got this hotel on Priceline for a great deal ! $125 a night.

It was out anniversary and they surprised us when we arrived with Cava and a chocolate cake!

The bed so super cozy and very nice bathrooms. 

Location:  OK here's where it losses a only few points - it's away from the main city centre, la rambla etc...  BUT it's first of all right across the street from a mall (can quickly grab cheap McDonalds for breakfast or other restaurants).  Also it's a 5 min walk to the subway!  Just jump on the subway and your at la rambla in 15 mins.  Or head up to la sagrada familia in 20min etc..

Everything is so close.. but since it's away from the crazy centre it's safe, peaceful and quiet.

So definitely would stay again!  Especially for a deal.",5,2012,07,10
36,Good experience,"Good
The pool and terrace was really nice.
The room was nice and had a great view.
Close to the sea and beach.
Not in the city centre, but we knew this and the metro was only 5 minutes walk away.

Room for improvement
The only real downside was the breakfast. The buffet was rich and a lot to choose from, but it was very busy and the staff could not keep up with the demands from customers. Too often, part of the buffet was empty. Had to wait 12 minutes for bread, 10 minutes for fruit etc. The staff offered to bring the food to the table (once they had found it for the buffet) but forgot.

Internet was 27 euro per day. In the centre across the street it is free.

Would recommend the hotel and come back, but be aware of the very busy breakfast room and (too) high internet prices.",4,2012,07,10
36,An average hotel away from the city centre,"Stayed for one night with  the idea of relaxing by the pool, swimming and enjoying some sunshine which has been in short supply at home this summer. We arrived early but were able to check-in and found our room to be up to the usual Hilton standards.
The pool area is spacious with plenty of sunbeds and umbrellas and we were looking forward to swimming in the pool, however it was absolutely freezing! We could only tolerate it for a few minutes, what a disappointment that such a hotel does not have the ability to heat the water. Also the sight of a baby in the pool without a nappy was off putting, most hotels have a policy which prohibits this. Considering the water was so cold I'm surprised the baby didn't turn blue!
We ordered lunch at the bar by the pool, sadly another disappointment here with slow disinterested service and very poor value.
We walked to the beach but the stretch of sand close to the hotel is scruffy, those closer to Barcelona centre appeared more attractive. With a huge choice of hotels in Barcelona we won't be rushing back to this one.",3,2012,07,09
36,OK hotel outside the city,"This is a HIlton so to an extent people know what they are getting, so I will just focus on the highlights. 

The good: 
Very nice outdoor pool 
Great service 
Close to the beach 

The bad: 
Location is not great
Sheets on my bed were not clean (I expected better from Hilton) 
Rooms could use updating (and there was a funky smell in the hallway) 

Given some of the other hotels in Barcelona I would probably not chose to come back to this Hilton.",4,2012,07,08
36,Great hotel,"We were going to Barcelona as part of our honeymoon; I had made reservations at Hilton for a junior suite; with smoking allowed; when I got there; checking in was very smooth and fast, didn't have t wait for long at all, when we were taken to our room we discovered it was a non smoking room; so I called the reception to complain about this, 5 mins later I received another call from the shift manager, apologizing for the inconvenience and upgrading me to a royal suite free of charge...
During the stay the service was great from the bell men all the way to the hotel managers, the atmosphere is very pleasant and the food is great! More importantly the rooms are very well furnished and in great condition with amazing views of the beautiful city
The hotel is located a little bit far from the center of Barcelona, more into what I thought was the business district of the city, but the easy access to taxis, metro, tram and buses made it easy... 
I would highly recommend this hotel for business trips and family trips! And for long stays!",5,2012,07,07
36,Seriously lacks the Hilton values.....,"Our experience at this hotel was very different to all other Hilton hotels we have stayed in over the years. On arrival it took over 30 minutes for our room to be allocated and the front desk staff were unable to make any decision without consulting the management.
During our stay we seemed to be constantly ""asking"" for basic amenities and when I questioned the lack of choice for vegetarians in the executive lounge I was told that the menu was ok for 90% of the customers, this hotel is not in touch with the Hilton values and does not put customers first!!!",3,2012,07,06
36,Great hotel for business travelers,"I stayed at the Hilton Diagonal for several days during a recent business trip to Barcelona. I was really pleased with the size, quality, and efficiency of my room. The staff were all friendly and helpful. The executive lounge has great views, a decent breakfast, and is a very pleasant place to have a drink and snacks in the evening before heading off for dinner. Thr location is a bit isolated from the prime tourist attractions, but they can be reached easily by taxi or the metro from the hotel. There is a metro station about 5-10 minutes walk from the hotel. The taxi ride to the airport took about 20 minutes when I departed. I will likely stay here again next time i am in Barcelona.",5,2012,07,06
36,Excellent Service,"My husband is a Diamond member for Hilton, we always get great services.  The executive lounge food was fantastic and staff were extremely nice and helpful.  Free breakfast was great too. All in all, great place.",5,2012,07,05
36,Outside of inner city but Very nice,"If you're okay with a 15 minute ride to get downtown I strongly recommend this property.  Minutes to the beach; beautiful views of the Sea, very good service.

We upgraded to executive level -- if rooms are available and you can afford the upgrade do it.  The upper floors and 15 floor balcony offer spectatular views of the city and Sea.  Enjoy complimentary topas and glass of wine or beer and sit for an hour and relax.

Staff was terrific, very helpful and spoke English well enough to help us pick locations, restuaurants and book trains.

All in all a wonderful hotel.  Clean, modern, full of energy, great swimming pool and restuarants.

Cab ride to city center ~ 6 euro; 2 euro in subway and 15 minutes on hop on; hop off bus.",5,2012,07,05
36,Another great Hilton which caters for smokers.,"This is a fine hotel next door to the International Convention Centre of Barcelona and only a few minutes walk from the sandy beach. Although it is near the edge of the city, there is a large shopping mall opposite and a Metro station is only a few minutes away, which will take you into the city centre.
I was upgraded to to one of the Executive floors, where the rooms are large and modern, with lovely views, wooden floors and almost silent air handling (a real boon).
The hotel has a pool on the second floor which is part of a large open space with decking and a bar (which serves light food). Smoking is permitted at the tables, which are under umbrella cover. Unfortunately, this nice area closes at 8pm. There is also a well-equipped gym on the second floor.
The restaurant is very good, serving international dishes with a Catalan flavour. There are outside tables, under cover, where smoking is permitted, which is a nice touch.
The lobby lounge also serves lighter dishes, again with a Catalan touch.
The staff are very helpful and cheerful. Also multilingual.
The Executive Lounge is open until 11pm. Here wine, beer and snacks (as well as soft drinks) are complementary and available all day long and cakes are served mid-afternoon. In the evening canapes are brought out, along with a selection of spirits. There is an outside area with tables with fine views, where smoking is permitted and which is well covered. 
There are currently two floors with smoking rooms, but that will change later this year, when one floor will revert to being nonsmoking.",5,2012,07,04
36,An excellent hotel,"I have stayed in this hotel for 9 days with my wife to attend conference & training so it was a mix of business trip and vacation, The hotel location was fantastic near to the beach and just next to to one of the biggest mall in Barcelona although you will feel the quietness atmosphere specially than some others like La Rambla area, room was in 22 floor with spectacular beach view, Excellent room service, Very good breakfast.

Unfortunately last 2 days was a bit noisy on the night because of an event been started on the beach (Music Festival) which is still not big deal .",5,2012,07,03
36,Beautiful Hotel and excellent location,"My family and I stayed at this hotel for five days while on a business trip to Barcelona. Service was very good and staff was very responsive. The rooms are nice and well appointed. The hotel is next door to the convention center and across the street from the Diagonal del Mar Mall. Even tough away from the center of town, we never had a problem taking a taxi to and from the hotel. The subway line is also nearby. The Hilton has a very large and beautiful pool, plus it is two blocks away from the beach.

The food was excellent, having visited the restaurants quite frequently. Breakfast was very complete, buffet style or a la carte. I would strongly recommend this hotel.",5,2012,07,01
36,Fab hotel next to the beach,"Although this hotel is away from central barcelona i.e. las ramblas it is a 5 min walk from the beach. If you just want to chill out and not necessarily do the tours the beach is great, it has plenty of beds to rent and fab beach bars. This hotel had great spacious modern rooms and a lovely roof top pool. The hotel staff are very helpful and even provided me with a tooth brush when i forgot mine. The metro is not far from the hotel so its really easy to get into the heart of Barcelona. I would definately recommend this hotel.",5,2012,07,01
36,Nice retreat away from the hustle and bustle of the city,"We stayed here for a whole week and overall were pleased with this hotel. If you don’t want to be in the center of Barcelona then this hotel is the perfect location for you. The metro is only a couple of minutes away and there is a shopping center right across the road. 

The room was nice, clean but needed little touchups here and there, but those were minor. We had a partial sea view room and the hotel is only a couple of minutes from the beach.

The food at the restaurant for dinner was very good and the staff was very friendly and accommodating. At breakfast it’s a different story, there the staff, despite their best efforts, cannot keep up with the amount of people and their requests. While there was a long line to get into the breakfast room there were many tables that needed to be cleaned and setup for the next guests. But the staff was too busy handling requests from the people who were already seated at the table that they couldn’t keep up. It would have been better to have at least 2 staff members whose only job is to clean up the tables, that way the waiting line won’t be as long and the regular wait staff can then concentrate fully on the already seated guests. The food at breakfast itself was ok, it depended on the day whether your eggs would be watery or not, and also the kitchen staff had a very hard time keeping up on the weekend with the amount of food that was being consumed. Once again it comes down to better organization.

The executive lounge was nice except for the cava and wine that were placed in a big wine cooler but there was no ice to keep it cool, only water. So the cava and white wine were actually at room temperature instead of being cool. But the staff at the lounge was very friendly and helpful with giving info about restaurants and things to see while in Barcelona.
We received a bottle of cava and a cake when we arrived, thank you for that. 

If the organizational issues I mentioned get resolved you’d have a top notch hotel.",4,2012,06,30
36,"Lovely hotel, excellent staff!","We stayed at the Hilton Diagonal Mar in Barcelona on June 16-19 before our cruise. The hotel was lovely, our room spacious with a beautiful view. This being our first visit to Barcelona, we sought advice from the concierge. He was very helpful in showing us where to go, choosing tours and restaurants, and arranging taxis, etc. The executive lounge was fabulous, as was the breakfast served in the main restaurant. Thank you for a most enjoyable stay at your lovely hotel and beautiful city.",5,2012,06,28
36,"Good hotel, but left me indifferent","I booked a reward stay at this Hilton in June 2012, versus the one downtown, because I thought it would be cool to be near the beach and still able to take a train to the city. And that is exactly what you get - walking distance to the beach, beach view from some rooms (mine had it) and the executive lounge, proximity to a subway station (Maresme Forum) - and you get a seemingly perfect combination. 
My room was on one of the executive floors and was tiny, tiny, tiny, but clean and modern. Nice bathroom with both a shower and tub, modern fixtures etc. I had two twin size beds , which looked like portable guest beds you'd wheel in when you need them. They actually were on wheels and moved around a lot. Very un-luxurious, more like a hostel. 
The executive lounge is excellent, with breakfast, drinks, finger food and desserts at different times of the day. Good view of the sea and very friendly staff. I didn't eat breakfast here, but in the main breakfast room on the 1st floor instead.
The main breakfast room is enormous and largely empty, with a fantastic buffet breakfast. Just wonderful.
Pool area is also enormous and completely void of guests at the time of my stay. The pool looks like a matchbox compared to the patio which takes what looks like half of a city block :) There is also a bar there.
What made me not feel comfortable here is the fact that the hotel is SO business oriented. I came as a casual guest and felt completely out of place. Not sure if the downtown Hilton would have been different, but I will definitely try it next time. 
Also if you are not a Gold or Diamond member, be prepared to overpay for Internet.",4,2012,06,27
36,"A good Hilton, what I expected","I liked this Hilton because it's modern, bright and airy and has excellent parking. The service is first-rate. I had booked a superior room which wasn't ready when I checked in, but the receptionist juggled things around and got me sorted out in a few minutes. I loved my room which was on a corner overlooking the city, and the huge windows gave the room a bright and airy feel. I only stayed one night but would happily have stayed for a week.
From a location point of view, my business was in that area so it suited me fine. If you're visiting the city maybe something more central would be better, however there are plenty of taxis available and of course you are beside the sea. One advantage also is that there's a shopping centre right in front of the hotel. Definitely will return.",4,2012,06,23
36,Beautiful modern hotel,"The HIlton Barcelona is close to business, beaches, parks and shopping.  Expansive rooms, impressive lobby and pool area.  A bit off the beaten track for major tourist attractions.",5,2012,06,21
36,Good hotel in the wrong place,"The hotel is shining, the lobby, the business rooms, the restaurant and more important the rooms are very clean and looks pretty new.
The breakfast was of good quality and available for anyone choice.
The prices for the restaurant are a little expansive but nothing compared to the bar .... 9,5 euro for a bear ?????
BUt the worst thing is the location.

It is close to the beach (not the most popular in Barcelona thought) but away from any touristic attraction in the city",4,2012,06,21
36,Very nice,"The hotel was nice, and we were very lucky to have a room ready for us on early arrival.  The location was very convenient to the metro, but kind of far from the attractions.  I expected free wifi, but that was not the case.  The pool area is very nice.",4,2012,06,20
36,Great hotel away from the centre of the city,"We booked this hotel for a two night stay before we departed on our cruise from Barcelona. We really liked the hotel, it was away from the noise of the city centre, close to the beach, opposite a large shopping centre with lots of resturants (so you don't have to eat in the expensive hotel resturants if you didn;t want to ) and five mins walk to the metro. The tourist bus also had a pick up stop a fw hundred yards from the hotel entrance.
However, we were told that breakfast was from 6am to 11pm at the weekends. On the first day (Saturday) we went down for breakfast fairly late - 9.45am. Although it was a buffet system the 'waiters' brought tea and coffee to the table and even thought it was not very busy it took 25 minutes to get a cup of tea. They were supposed to be serving breakfast until 11am but at 9.45 there was virtually nothing left and it was not being replenished. I was very annoyed and very disappointed. The next morning (Sunday) we went for breakfast earlier at 8.30am and things were ok, however this time they had placed coffee pots on each table but they were probably there from 6am as the coffee was tepid when we poured it out. I felt it was a very poor service on the Saturday, not what I expect from this class of hotel. 
Pool area was great, peaceful and spacious.",4,2012,06,19
36,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona,"Booked 2 rooms, and stayed one night at this hotel before cruising.  There was a TERRIBLE smell in the hallway as soon as we stepped off the elevator on the Seventh Floor. Like sewage.  The front desk and the manager could have cared less.  There was no ""customer service"".  The front desk and the manager treated us like we a real bother to them.  The front desk staff was not friendly.  What a waste of $500!

I would not recommend this hotel, nor will I stay at another Hilton hotel EVER!!!

Upon returning home, I complained to the Hilton customer service people, and they have not done anything.",1,2012,06,17

36,"Spacious, airy hotel in an isolated location. Good for business or Primavera.","This is a spacious, airy hotel, situated near the end of the avenue Diagonal. It's a business hotel in a concrete jungle, perfectly placed if you're going to the Primavera Sound festival or to the nearby Forum on business. Bad location for anything else.
There's absolutely nothing nearby, except an ugly suburban multi-story concrete shopping mall across the road. The beach was visible from the room, but we had a fifteen minute walk, past skyscrapers, across the motorway and through a carpark to get there. 
Plus side : The rooms are big and clean, there's a nice 20 meter outdoor pool on the boardwalk terrace. Staff are helpful. Big choice at breakfast. You can buy in bulk across the road.",4,2012,06,15
36,Excellent hotel,"We stayed here for 3 nights prior to our Med. cruise.  We received an upgrade to a suite which was beautiful.  It had 2 rooms, huge bathroom, and a beautiful view of the Mediterranean.  We had access to the Executive Lounge which had a beautiful view of the city.  The pool and bar had friendly staff and great drinks.  It also had a wonderful breakfast buffet.  The only drawback was the location but we used the hop on/hop off bus which was right down the street.  Highly recommend this hotel!!",5,2012,06,14
36,Excellent hotel if you are at a convention,"Our experiences at this hotel were all good. While not a great location for first time visitors to Barcelona it is a short metro ride from stations that access all the key must see places in the city. The rooms are a good size and the executive lounge is excellent - great bfst, tapas and desserts. Across the street is a mall with tacky US fast food joints, but there is also a good restaurant/tapas bar with reasonable Spanish food and good wine choices.",4,2012,06,12
36,Wonderful,A gem among the Hilton family. A great location for exploring without the crowds and a very high level of service. We stayed pre cruise and after a Mediterranean cruise and were extremely pleased.  The staff was outstanding in taking care of us and our various requests.  ,5,2012,06,11
36,Fantastic hotel with beautiful views,"Beautiful hotel, great views and fantastic bar. Only drawback its not in the centre of Barcelona but a 15min walk from the harbour area/ramblas. I would recommend .",5,2012,06,04
36,"Good Hotel, nice location","We stayed a week in this Hotel. Upon arrive we got our membership upgrade. Nice staff, good Hotel. The location is fare from the center, however, the Metro station is 5 minutes away, no problem with transport. Only the room needed some renovations, small ones but I could see them and this is should not be seen in Hilton standard, I think.",4,2012,06,01
36,Nice Hotel but location not the best,"We stayed here for a weekend before our cruise. Thought it was a nice hotel with a spacious room and a good breakfast each day. Only thing it could have done with is free wifi. Theres a large shopping centre across the road which had a Mcdonalds so we would use the free wifi there and the train station is the other side of it called El Maresme Forum. We bought a 10 journey ticket for €9.25 and thought the metro was easy enough to get around, just pick up a Barcelona map from reception. There are also plenty of taxis outside the hotel and the tourist buses pass by the hotel too. The beach is a short walk away and there was a beach bar which also served food at a reasonable price considering the location. We previously stayed close to La Rambles last time we visited Barcelona and preferred to be in the heart of things so felt this hotels location wasn't the best for us and was more for business types.",4,2012,05,31
36,A convenient business hotel,"The hotel lobbey is nice, the rooms are spacy and very clean, the front disc staff are very friendly and helpful. The hotel is near metro and bus stations and tourist bus station is very near to it, so there is no problem in transportation. The hotel is next to congress center, where the medical meeting am involved in was held. So the hotel was very convenient for me for both Business and exploring Barcelona.",4,2012,05,31
36,Perfection in Barcelona,"Fantastic location, brilliant staff!  Yes it is a business hotel but they know how to look after their non business clientele as well. From arrival to departure they could not do enough.
The front office staff were a delight, as were all the rest of the team.. The restaurant was far better than any normal hotel restaurant.. The views from our (admittedly on a high floor) room were spectacular... the room bright and spacious with everything one needed and more.
It took 10 minutes on a very safe and clean metro journey into the heart of Barcelona, and was a 5 minute taxi ride to the restaurants and night life of Port olympic and Barceloneta. Plenty of taxis outside the door... and also a great shopping centre/food court across the road with a great selection of cafes and tappas on the doorstep. The Hilton ticks all the boxes.. near enough to the hustle and bustle of Barcelona but far away enough for relaxing too.. the pool and pool bar are well equipped.. and there is always a massage in the hotel spa if you need to relax more !  Cant wait to go back... Hilton Diagonal you exceeded all expectations",5,2012,05,30
36,Hilton delivers,"Typical business hotel a bit outside of the most busy parts of Barcelona. Nice, fresch and which I much appreciate, silent rooms. I stayed in the 404 which was a corner room, kind of nice. Higher floors of course offer better views especielly towards seaside but remember that elevators can be a bit busy especially in the morning.",4,2012,05,29
36,"Great hotel, HORRIBLE LOCATION","We spent a week in Barcelona for my work. My company put us up in a hotel in Central Barcelona for my conference.  After that was done we moves to the Hilton closer to the beach. The hotel is out of this world fantastic compared to the Renaissance we spentbthe first half of our trip. The ONLY issue is that it is a long way away from the touristy places. Great if all you want to do is the beach, but be prepares to spend $15 in cab fare.
that diadem I would recommend this hotel again and to anyone who wants a nice clean/quiet hotel experience. ",5,2012,05,26
36,perfect location,"I have stayed at this hotel several times and have always had a great time
Location is perfect with a short walk along the beach to the city centre
Amenities here are what you would expect and more from this hotel brand",5,2012,05,26
36,Great hotel. Great staff,"The Diagonal Mar is a beautiful, comfortable, high-end hotel that is a convenient taxi/subway/tram ride away from the main Rambla.  Rooms are magnificent and the views breathtaking. Subway rides can be less than 1 Euro to anywhere in the city, and the area feels much safer than the congested  center of town. Staff are SUPER friendly.",5,2012,05,25
36,Great and quiet location,"This hotel is not close to any hot spot but to the Maresme (Trinitat Nova – La Pau) metro station. From the metro station you can access most of Barcelona. This is a great advantage in a metropolis since the noises of motorcycles, buses, cars and music could be pretty annoying when you want to sleep. The restaurant and bars are very good. There is a good size swimming pool. The fitness center is very small and under-equipped for a Hilton (one of the two treadmills was broken). While I was exercising I witnessed customers coming to the gym and leaving because there was no available equipment.",4,2012,05,25
36,Great hotel but more suited as 'high end' business because of location,"Great hotel, new and fresh! Specially if you are on business or anything simular. Nice spacey rooms, especially for Barcelona standards and finally a hotel bar where it's nice to stay! Mind the location though because if you are a thrillseeker for last minute departures to the airport or want to be able to 'walk' to the ramblas you will be dissappointed or loose a lot of weight.",4,2012,05,22
36,Great Hotel in Barcelona,"Just finished 4 days at the Hilton Diagonal Mar and couldn't say anything bad about this hotel. The service was top notch.  The Indigo Restaurant was outstanding with great service and a staff that made great suggestions on spanish wine pairings.  If your visiting central Barcelona this might not be the hotel for you, but there is a hop on / hop off bus stop right in front of the hotel and it takes you to all the major sites.  If you want to be close to the beach this is a great hotel as it is just a block from the beach.   Great Hotel in an amazing City.",4,2012,05,22
36,Grt if u r cruising,We stayed here a night before our cruise so it was apt for that purpose.. It's located quite far from the city centre but very close to the port and quite close to the airport... Got nice rooms... Clean and on a high floor... Views of the med sea was Grt.. I am claustrophobic so got a little sick with the closed and stuffy feel in the room.. But the reception helped relieve this after I signed a waiver which led to them opening a window.. Amenities were so-so.. Rooms have tea/coffee makers with ironing boards.. Breakfast was grt... There is an amazing mall just across the street with a huge food court... The surprise was these amazing relaxation CDs in the room that totally led me to nirvana as I sat at the window watching a gorgeous sunset over the med sea listening to these soothing tracks sipping some coffee (not wine..;)),4,2012,05,21
36,"Amazing hotel, bad location if you on vacation, great if on business","Scored this hotel through Expedia.com.  In all the hotels I stayed at during my Europe trip, this was by far the highest class hotel.  Spacious room, great view, good fitness centre, basically great everything on the inside. However, if your like me and prefer to only sleep inside your hotel when on vacation and spend the rest of your time and money outside exploring and discovering everything, then this hotel just doesn't cut it. It is located far away from all the major attractions that Barcelona has to offer.  Granted the metro is located just a block away, but still quite a ride to the centre and then you have to go all the way back. After just one night, and taking advantage of an amazing bed and shower, I decided to switch hotels to one much less expensive and in the middle all the excitement that Barcelona has to offer.",4,2012,05,20
36,Top notch Hilton,"Thanks to others, I also highly recommend. Flew in from Atlanta and limo took us to this fine Hilton at about 9:30 AM and front desk had upgraded us to an executive room ( they checked us right in !)on the 22nd floor facing the MedIterranean ......beautiful. Rooms have wood flooring and are very spacious, very comfortable beds. Very well appointed. Executive lounge on the 15th floor is one of the best of the many I have been . Liquor, wine, beer and very tasty and well done tapas !!!   Service was extremely good and courteous. I am a gold HHonors member and was recognonized. It was an easy taxi ( about 25 Euros ) to Barcelona city center. Dined off property but had drinks in the lobby lounge after dinner each night and was very satisfied with service. Breakfast was very very good  . Great selections and did the executive lounge had a great continental we did day 2 . We did this as a two night prestay to a Med cruise and would definitely return. A great Hilton ! Will return!!!",5,2012,05,19
36,Excellent Hotel - but not central,"This is an excellent hotel in Barcelona. We spent a weekend with the family in May. The swimming pool on the roof of the 2nd floor (main building has 17 floors) is nicely made to spend time with children and to get some sun even early in the year. The water was not warm, but nice to cool down. The rooms and the hotel standard are a real 5* hotel, all is as it should be. Staff was friendly and helped, rooms were perfect.
The hotel is not centrally located, a taxi is 8-10€ to get to the city, less than 10 minutes dependent where you want to go. Dependent on the rate you can get for the hotel it is a perfect choice: You may be a little bit outside, but you have beach + pool and you're really fast in the city. The trip to the airport is 30€ plus 1€ for each suitcase and takes 25-30 minutes on the weekend, expect 45-60 minutes during the week on peak times in the evening or morning.
Even with the not-central location we could book the hotel again - teh standard you're getting is much higher than in any of the direct down-town hotels, and the big advantage are taxis in Barcelona: Independnet where you are in the city it needs less than a minute and a free taxi arrives. This means after a drink or after sightseeing it is 8-10€ and 10 minutes and you're back in the hotel - this was especially with children perfect. 
Opposite of the hotel is kind of a shopping area with lots of restaurants, sitting inside and outside dependent on temperatures. You find there real good Spanish Tapas at reasonable rate (we paid 15€ per person and ordered too much) as well as all other kind of food like Italien, Japonese etc. So, you can also do sightseeing, spending time at the pool and have some nice Dinner without going anywhere.
Summary: A very good hotel, not central, but perfect located for family and couples, if you accept the taxi rides.",5,2012,05,18
36,"Awesome hotel, but not central for tourists.","The Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona was a welcome respite after the noisy, small Best Western in Madrid. We took the AVE from Madrid and transferred over and took the El Maresme Forum exit off the yellow L4 towards La Pau. Walk behind the mall, or go through it towards the beach side (if you're in the mall), exit where Ben and Jerry's is and the hotel you'll see directly across the plaza is the Hilton. You can't see the hotel name on the building from when you exit the station. So lame. 

Pool is on second floor, executive lounge is on the 15th floor with breakfast served beginning at 7am and snacks throughout the day. The view from there is awesome. We were in room 2102 with a city view and that was pretty beautiful in the day and at night. Room and bathrooms are large, with great water pressure. English is spoken by everyone at the hotel. They can mail postcards for you for 1 euro. There is a Carreros (post office) in the first floor of the shopping center across e street, but they don't sell stamps if you're a collector like me. They will stamp it and mail it for you. .85 for the USA. 

The pool at the hotel is not heated but there's a huge deck with plenty of umbrellas. The beach (nude, although not everyone is) is right across the street and over to the right of the hotel about a 5 minute walk. Water is brisk in May but offers a nice contrast to the blazing sun.  It has bathrooms, showers for rinsing off and food places. 

Beds in hotel are comfortable and there are plenty of outlets for your electronics. You need to get a code generated by front desk, which is included if you are executive level, and one code is good for 24 hours for two devices. Elevators are a tad slow but otherwise everything about this hotel is pretty awesome. I kind of feel like I'm in Miami. It's about a 20 minute ride to the sites, but it's not bad at all with trains running like every two minutes during the day.",5,2012,05,13
36,Disappointing this time round,"We have stayed here on several previous occasions and have had a most enjoyable stay - hence the rebooking! Check in was ok, allocated room 622 - average room, we have stayed in better ones but this room served a purpose!
Breakfast on the Saturday can only be described as 'Organised Chaos'! We were shown to our table and hubby went for 'Full English' at 9.40am you would think that all items for hot 
'Full English' were available - not so! no fried eggs and no baked beans, so he came back and patiently waited, some 25 minutes later still no eggs or beans, we 'collared' the Duty Manager and politely explained the situation, he duly went to the kitchen and brought out said beans and eggs.
Sunday again was not very flowing with regards to services at breakfast, I was seated at around 9.45am and it took a member of staff 20 minutes to ask if I would like tea or Coffee!
On checking out we settled the bill, the young man on reception did not ask us how are stay was or if indeed we had had a good visit just checked us out and took our cards.
We spent the last few hours before our departure at the poolside - initially the morning started cloudy but we were determined to get full benefit of the day, hubby wanted to order drinks by the pool - no staff were to be found on duty - a trip to reception to explain and someone was then promptly sent up to poolside bar! Not the service you would expect from the Hilton!
I think next time we visit Barcelona we shall be staying at another hotel.",3,2012,05,08
36,Should be better,"I went to this hotel in a bussiness trip for 3 days, and to be honest I didnt spent many time there. 
The room was huge, and I had good views to the city because the room was placed in the corner of the building. The staff was really nice in reception and also in the breakfast.
But is missing something to give a higher vote... It was a deception discouver that I need to pay 27eur for 24h internet in a Hilton...",4,2012,05,06
36,The big 50 continues in the true Hilton style,"Returning to one of our favourite Hiltons The Diagonal Mar. On check in all the club executive suites were occupied so we were allocated a lovely room on the 23 floor...non less than the guest bedroom of the Presidential suite ! An amazing view from this corner room across the city and the beach and even better from the huge jacuzzi bath.
Our usual suite became available and the hotel wanted us to move, I was reluctant to leave the amazing bathroom behind but our usual suite is also just as amazing and actually suited the occasion much better as we were to be entertaining guests in our lounge/dining room for my big 50. I have to say the hotel gets full markes again, our move was effortless on our behalf, all done by the staff and nothing done by ourselves. 
The attention to detail at this hotel remains as high as ever, nothing is left to chance and the whole team are amazing ( especially Cristobel and Cecelia in the exec lounge ). Since I was celebrating my big 50 the management permitted me to entertain my guests on the exec terrace which has the most amazing views however on the night of my party I chose to order Cava and canapés to be delivered to our suite. This was duly done, and what a banquet was laid before us in our dining room...simply amazing. I signed the bill, our guests duly arrived and then the phone call from the Executive Lounge ..oh Mr Mitchell, big mistake, you should not have signed anything...happy 50th from the Hilton Diagonal Mar...such generosity, and also this amazing suite....think Ignacio (GM) has been up to his old tricks !!  I had the best ever birthday big big thank you to all.
We were very lucky with the weather, and while we were there the hotel was about to open the outside area for the summer. Again top marks to this hotel, although not actually open the staff were great and organised a bottle of our favourite..just shows you how they look after their regulars...our seventh visit in just two years and already planning our eighth !
Unfortunately Ignacio is moving on and is leaving the Digonal Mar, off to Hilton Lyon, so we shall miss him so much as I am sure will his present team, however this hotel runs like clock work and will no doubt continue to do so. ( I will let you know after our eighth visit!) we wish you Ignacio all the best in your new post.
Word of warning when travelling...always check your luggage for your name. When collecting our luggage from the airport I took our two cases to find out later that my case was my case but wrong contents...yes a replica case, size weight etc, but a ladies...and unfortunately I was not up for wearing ladies clothes in an establishment where everyone knew me Ha Ha ! Let that be a lesson to me ...80euro later and a very late night in bed!!",5,2012,05,04
36,Life Saver!,"After a very bad experience in Barcelona because of ""Apartments Visit Barcelona"", we had to  spend our last 2 nights in good conditions so we decided to moved to Hilton Diagonal Mar. 
The hotel was wonderful, the breakfast was good. Too close to ""El Maresme Forum"" metro station. A very big shopping mal across the hotel. 
The only problem was the wi-fi, because it was 9€/day. But after the bug-filled house, we paid 9€ with no complaints.",5,2012,05,03
36,Barcelona,Quiet hotel located near the Hop on Hop off bus tours. They upgraded us to an executive suite and we got free internet and free breakfast with an evening reception (which included free beer and wine). The front desk couldnt have been nicer. We loved the hotels dining room also the staff was great and the food and wine was also.,5,2012,05,01
36,Average Hotel - Has potential,"I had great expectations since its a Hilton but was surprised at the unfriendly attitude of the reception staff especially during check out

The hotel is very well situated, has great sea and city views, close to a small shopping mall, stone throw away from the convention center. So on the whole has great location

The rooms are simple but well appointed. The bathroom is nice and modern.  

I had a corner room with a small view of the sea and mostly the road in front. The check in was fine. Room service not bad. Food average. 

The check out though was rough. Since I am silver card holder I requested for a late check out but was told I had to check out at 12 noon sharp and I had just 5 mts to 12. I requested them stating that I had a meeting going on n the same hotel and it would be kind if I could check out by 3PM. This is the first time I had staff asking me to leave ASAP o they would have to charge me for the second day. After a lot of discussion and convincing I needed some time to pack  I was  told I could get another half an hour. What was of interest was that one receptionist said it was possible till 6PM and then turned to his senior colleague who turned this down. I cannot understand how one person says yes and the other says no. 

I put my bag at the concierge and finally left the hotel at 5 on the evening after sitting in the lobby from 2 to 5 PM

What really bothered me was the complete apathy of the hotel reception staff.  I am a silver card member, closing towards a gold status  and the hotel could care less. I also wondered how  other guests would get treated if this is how regulars got treated. 

This hotel has potential if the staff are sufficiently groomed especially to handle requests politely and diplomatically",3,2012,04,30
36,COULD BE BETTER!,This nice and modern hotel is situated in a new area in Barcelona very modern right by the beach.. It is a very nice and new hotel.. big and typical Hilton style.. It could be excellent but it isnt because of its location.. way too far from the city center.. and the surronding area which is not very nice (if not for the shopping center right in front).. The rooms are nice.. The beds are confortable.. Breakfast is typical Hilton.. Just no free wifi.. Its payable everywhere in the hotel and quite expensive.. Ideal only for business men who just need a confty hotel to sleep and dont care about visiting Barcelona really!,4,2012,04,29
36,Not worth the money!!!,"Service below Hilton standards, don't ask for any extras, it is a no. Amenities are of the poorest choice. Food was bad to the point where we headed to the burger king facing the hotel. Overall, it is a three stars hotel at best. We were here for a business conference and most ppl complained continuesly the five days stay. it ruins the charm of Barcelona. ",1,2012,04,27
36,"Nice place, almost new, but not the center of action","Rooms are larger than typical European hotels, quieter as well. As you can see on a map, it's right next to the ocean, and 15 minutes from the action or the airport",4,2012,04,07
36,Near shopping centre and the beach,"Nice hotel with friendly staff. It´s easy to go to the beach, and even though the hotel isn´t close to the city centre it´s easy to go there by metro. However the breakfast is disappointing and can´t be recommended.",3,2012,04,06
36,Exactly what you expect the Hilton to be!,"Stay her in May 2011 as part of the technological conference / exhibition by Checkpoint. Some how i managed to get a room on very top floor, and let me tell you the view was wonderful. The hotel is built at an angle you either get a view of the sea, or the main part of Barcelona city of the Northern eastern part of the city (again all great views).

The room was typical Hilton, clean,, comfortable, layout was good and everything you would every need at hand. The bathroom was excellent and even had speakers linked from the TV in the bathroom.

The staff was start were professional and very helpful - i can not praise the staff they were great.  

I only had breakfast at the Hilton as i eat mostly in town, that being said breakfast was a mind blowing of choice - again still to very high standards. 

overall great hotel, with great service.",5,2012,04,02
36,A fine Hilton,"We stayed for three nights while visiting Barcelona.  

The Pros
Very clean and modern building
staff friendly and very helpful
rooms are spacious and tastefully done
beds are comfy and ocean views are nice
lifesize chess board near the pool (really cool)
they treat diamonds really well

Cons
It is aways out of Barcelona which could be a pro
it is a walk from the metro

Overall we would recommend this property.  Just keep in mind that it is out of town aways.",4,2012,04,01
36,Hotel offered way more than expected,"Impressed from the start. The check-in was really smooth and efficient with a really friendly and professional staff member. The discovery of the room was a real pleasure with this amazing space and view on one side over Barcelona and on the other on the sea. The room was very spacious, clean, modern and the plus of the jacuzzi was certainly not expected. We did have a good night sleep. The breakfast was varied and good between sweet and savory. All in all, an excellent start for the holiday! Fantastic value for money. Although this hotel is away from the city centre, they are still a range of shops, restaurants and amenities nearby.",5,2012,03,20
36,Perfect From Start To Finish,"We arrived early at 1100 Hrs and the lady at reception told us our allocated room wasn't ready but looked through the available rooms and checked us in straight away ..... Good start !

The room was very clean and modern on the 15th floor with sea view .

All the staff in executive lounge where really friendly and helpful on places to go etc 

The gym was small but had the basic machines you require .

We had an evening meal in the Indigo restaurant which was excellent but a little on the expensive side. Breakfast was very good with vast selection of different foods on offer.

We didn't come across a single member of staff who was rude or miserable and the whole experience was relaxing and a perfect break. Thank you Hilton !",5,2012,03,14
36,Nice location both for private and business affairs,"The hotel is easily reachable from the airport taking the bus (about 5 Euro) until Plaza Catalunia (25 min) and than the subway (2 Euro each ticket, yellow line): El Maresme stop (20 min). It's very close to the seaside and in a very quite location. The lobby is simple, not really sophisticated but looks good anyway. People at the desk and entrance is immediately ready to assist you with baggages and they speak a good English. I got an executive room and it was large enough, good furnitures, very clean and the view was good. Everything was working well. The executive lounge is at 15th floor and the view is on the seaside, very nice. It's a quite good looking lounge, not very elegant, the yoffer you some snack and cookies during and drinks and during lunhc and dinnes time something to eat but nothing special. I experienced better lounges in my Hilton experience than this one. The are is safe and during evening you're quite close to Barceloneta and Ciutdella Villa Olimpica where people go to have fun during the evening, it's 10 min by subway which is located 5 min away from the hotel by foot. Generally speaking a good experience, even if I visited higher level Hilton.",4,2012,03,12
36,Awesome Hotel,We were in Barcelona two days and stayed here our second day. The hotel and rooms were very upscale.  Roof top pool and Honors Club were exceptional.  One block off of the beach and very close to the subway which is very easy to navigate and get to all of the best attractions.  Check in and check out a snap!  Would definitely return to this hotel.,5,2012,03,03
36,Very Good Business Hotel,"Very interesting location in Barcelona, if this is your first time to the city and unfamiliar with the Metro/Aero bus you should take a taxi, about 40 euros. If you are familiar to the Metro get off at the Maresme Forum stop on L4 line and walk to the other side of the mall.
The hotel is not located in a popular tourist area but an area for conventions, there is a very large mall across the street with a lot of shopping and restaurants.
This hotel treats HH Diamonds very well as they offer full breakfast in the lounge or the restaurant and will give upgrades.
The hotel is rather new but the rooms are kind of plain, if you get the ocean view side it is a nice view. Executive lounge does not serve any hot items during breakfast or the evenings, wines and beers are available all day with the hard stuff out at 6:00pm. Also a great balcony outside the Executive lounge.
Pictures posted.",4,2012,02,21
36,Great business and leisure location - Top marks!,"Yes, I know I said great but note on caution on the airport taxis, they added 20 euros to our fare of 25 euros as compensation for waiting around the airport for next fare which was not explained and thankfully we could expense it. 

That said the Hilton itself was only 20 drive away from airport and is in a business area which has some upmarket restaurants (ask for the local fish place, can't recall name but everyone knows it behind the reception) - if you walk out the front door there is a taxi rank and a big shopping mall with cinema and plenty places to eat reasonably cheap.

Cirque du soleil are walking distance as is the beach and lots of walkways...

Hilton was predictable excellent and professional with big rooms, well cleaned and turned out and the room service was some of the best ever - the pizza, steaks and anything with chicken are V.good. Cruz campo beer is excellent. Hotel gym is a bit warm even in February so hopefully they can sort out the air con soon, and the outside pool was closed due to severe cold weather which was not a problem - it is not heated.

To save 4 euros the reception can give you vouchers for the excellent bus tour of barcelona which is 24 euros each (20 with voucher) and other money vouchers...best to pay for 2 days for not much more and you get free travel round most of the city for 2 days for 30 euros

Wi fi is silly price with Swiss com in the hotel so go to the mall and get free at a cafe for a short while at least...overall though another great stay at hilton, gracias!",5,2012,02,19
36,Nice stay,"We were able to stay at the Hilton as part of a cruise deal with Royal Carribbean. It fitted in nicely as before the cruise it gave us a couple of days in Barcelona. Although it is on the outskirts of the city we had no problem getting around as the undergound was close and cheap and taxis were also available just outside. We stayed in May and the weather was lovely so as it was out of season the rooftop pool was very relaxing. Our room was clean and fairly spacious with terrific views of the city. The bathroom had a small window beside the bath which was quite novel to watch the world below whilst having a bath.
We found the staff very friendly and always had time for a little chat if you wanted. We didn't eat in the evening as we wanted to explore Barcelona but breakfast was nice enough. Overall a pleasant and relaxing stay in a very modern hotel.",4,2012,02,13
36,Awesome pre and post cruise getaway,"We stayed here one night before and two nights after our 12 night Med cruise which sailed out of Barcelona.  The hotel is top notch in every way and is located in a nice residential-type sea-side area, and is a short walk to the convention center.  The beach and boardwalk are just down the street,  and there is a modern shopping mall across the street from the hotel.  (This came in handy as my luggage was damaged on the flight over.)   

As a Diamond member we were upgraded to a high floor with concierge lounge privileges.  The concierge lounge was very nice and offered spectacular views of the water and city from the wrap around balcony.  Sitting outside in the evening having a drink and snack was wonderful!  The concierge (and all of the hotel staff) were very friendly and helpful with my questions and sightseeing requests.  (First was luggage, and second and third were restaurants, port arrangements etc.)

As we were tired the first night from the flight, the Concierge suggested the mall across the street, which was a perfect choice for us (and several others we saw there as well from the hotel).  There are several restaurants there, including a couple casual outdoor tapas bars we went to which really hit the spot.  We liked it so much we went again on our return visit after the cruise.  The room itself was very comfortable, and well furnished.

The lounge has complimentary beer, wine, spirits, and soft drinks, along with some nice appetizers.  We also had breakfast here as well.  It was nice socializing with the other guests in the evening as well.  On a weekend night we were there in May, a band was playing outside, beach-side down from the hotel.  We could hear the music lightly up on the balcony and watch the crowds gather for the concert; quite enjoyable and relaxing after a day touring around.

The Hop on Hop off bus (actually there are two different companies) stops near the hotel, and we used that to sightsee all over town, although the subway and trams are close by as well.

The walk along the beachside is most pleasant, and as the hotel is so tall, you don't have to worry about getting loss.  Although we didn't use it because were busy sightseeing, we did walk down to the pool area one evening, and found it to be very attractive and inviting.

I would highly recommend this hotel for either business, or as we did for a pre/post cruise stay.",5,2012,02,08
36,It's Just Perfect Vacation,"This my first trip to Spain/Barcelona and indeed its' value for money holidays.Pulbic transportantion is excellent so even its bit far from city center it's easily reach by underground or tram.A beautiful view of the beach and city.Breakfast is just superb choice just its not being refill fast enough so we need to wait bit longer.Room are spacious and so does the bathroom .I love much the lazy chair to lay back after a long day on tour in the City.
Barcelona have everything to offer from history,seaside,hills,sports,shopping and incredible food.This hotel is just in front of Diagonal Mar Mall and its everything you need.There a stop for Hop on Hop Off bus just 5 mins walk away and i bought a two days ticket.Come back in afternoon for a rest and hop on again for the next round with easy.
I did went for a jogging at the beach front till Olympic City and such a modern and excellent jogging track at the water front.Lots of waterfront restaurants and huge marina there.
I really glad i choose Hilton Diagonal Mar and this is the retreat i have been been looking for a long time in Europe without paying through the nose.",5,2012,02,04
36,"Very nice choice, great executive lounge","My husband and I just stayed for 4 nights at the Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona.  We had a very enjoyable stay there.  We booked an executive room and were given a lovely corner room and could not have been happier. The location was very convenient to the Metro and there is a big shopping area across the street with some nice restaurants. 
The executive lounge was very nice and being Hilton Diamond I can tell you it was one of the better ones. The people were very informative and helpful.
One thing I would like to mention.  If you book the AAA rate, be sure to bring your card!  I only had my card on an iPhone app and it did not show my name........They did accept it though.  
When we left the hotel it was 6:45 am and there was no bellman on duty and no place to get coffee or breakfast (there is some sort of coffee in the room). Everything opens at 7am. The desk clerk got our taxi and helped us depart.  
I would definitely stay at this property again..............great views and service",5,2012,02,01
36,The perfect place to go for business or plesure,"I went there during a cancer conference from business side it is perfect as it is 5 min walk to the convention center , plesure side it is a happy hotel were you feel so happy from the ambience and the hospitality and the great service from the team there 
It is highly recommended.... If you can find a place as it was completely booked during this period as I had to book 6 month before the event , I would defenetly invite my guests again their",5,2012,01,31
36,You must go!!,I went to stay at this hotel for my 40th birthday! It was an amazing place. The rooms were very clean and the  maid service was second to none. It was out of the main centre of Barcelona but the subway was close by. It suited us as it was in a quieter area but close to the hustle and bustle if you wnated it. Near by was an amazing shopping centre - like England's main shopping centres. Restaurants near by were also fab. It has a swimming pool and it is very close to the beach so also ideal if you want to relax too. I would go back and stay at the hilton again. xxxxx,5,2012,01,29
36,Very nice hotel!  Excellent staff.,"We stayed here for a few days, post cruise, and it is another great Hilton hotel.  The room was perfect and the executive lounge was comfortable with a nice assortment of drinks and snacks.  The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful and the breakfast was very good too.  The location away from the city center was not really a problem because of the close proximity to the underground subway.  It was so nice to come back to this hotel after a long busy day of touring the beautiful city of Barcelona.",5,2012,01,23
36,A Pleasent Stay,"Had a very good stay for couple of days. The hotel has a nice sea view with a wide window view. I liked the location of the hotel being close to the conference I was attending and also close to the shopping mall. The staff are very much customer friendly, the only drawback was the food and room service wasn't that good. There is some room for improvement. ",5,2012,01,22
36,Awesome Room,"Stayed up here for a week on business. The room I stayed in was on the 18th floor with a view across the med. While it is a little out of the way from the centre of BCN, it still is a lovely hotel, although a little overpriced food wise. Opposite there is a large mall with some nice restaurants as well as the usual chains such as McDonalds.",4,2012,01,22
36,Unresponsive management,"Arrived early and had room booked on executive level.  Room was not ready, and management refused to allow us in the Lounge while we waited as we might nibble food.  Had to camp out for 2 hours in the lobby.  We reported at check-in and daily thereafter for four days about the horrible signal on the TV.  We wanted to see CNN, but just got a fuzzy picture.  After hours of dealing unsuccessfully with the problem, the general manager gave us a big 10% discount after check-out for the inconvenience.  BFD.  We spent hours waiting for tech staff and managers daily to ""review"" the problem, and they had lots of explanations like wind, but they never fixed it.  What happened to the customer satisfaction guarantee?  Or is that Holiday Inn?   On the good side, the executive club staff, especially Cristobal, were Great!",1,2012,01,22
36,Modern Barcelona,"Lovely modern hotel in the newest area of Barcelona. We upgraded to the largest suite but, unfortunately, the suite was made for business and not leisure travel. The largest part of the room was a big conference table (strange). They should sell this type of suite for a business traveler that will have meetings in their room. We made it work, somewhat, but it was not a good set up for a family. The rest of the hotel was lovely. The pool area nice but the pool water was COLD. I am a Hilton club member so we had the club room for breakfast and snacks. This is probably the best Hilton Club room I have ever been in as it offered a great variety of food and drinks. I BIG NEGATIVE is that Hilton has not adopted the no-smoking policy that some other American chains have. This meant smoke in our faces at breakfast and at the pool and restaurant areas.",4,2012,01,22
36,Decent Hilton but a little off loaction wise,Good hotel on Via Diagonal.....if you know Barcelona and want a good business style hotel - this could be it. Lounge is good and the service and helpfullness of staff noteworthy. As a HHD I would go there again when next in Barcelona.....even if waiting for a nice Conrad or Waldorf in that great city,4,2012,01,08
36,Great room but very disappointing service,"I went with my boyfriend who is a Hilton Diamond member. We have stayed in several Hiltons and are always treated very well because of his status.

Let me start with the pros: 
-Lovely executive room, spacious and airy.
-Executive lounge had a lovely seafront view
-Metro is a 10min walk away

Cons: 
-No doorman, greeter at door or porter to help with bags
-Front desk does not greet us when we enter the hotel, even if we are the only ones in the lobby
-Housekeeping once cleared our dirty towels and didn't replace them with new bath towels
-Minibar snacks were never replenished in the 4 days that we were there
-Free Internet access was limited to only one device and staff did not relent and give us any additional accesses

A five star hotel with 2 star service. Disappointing.",3,2012,01,05
36,"Luxurious hotel, all the amenities.","We stayed a night at the Diagonal Mar Hilton before sailing out on a cruise from Barcelona - it was suggested by friends who always use Hilton hotels, and what can I say - I might be a convert.

Reception was friendly and helpful - and instantly bi-lingual, without us having to use our poor pigeon spanish to be understood.

The room was comfortable and well equipped, we had a great night's sleep, and the shower was lovely and powerful - something that I have had mixed luck with in tall hotels. 

We ate breakfast and generally relaxed in the premium lounge, which was available for an 80 Euro supplement - sounds like a lot as a supplement, but it's hard to stress just how nice the place was. I suspect we got our money's worth!",5,2012,01,01
36,Excellent Place to Enjoy the Beach,"We wrapped up our Spanish vacation with four days at the Hilton Diagonal Del Mar.  It turned out to be the perfect place to relax and enjoy the beach. Only a short train ride from the tourist areas of Barcelona, it had a relaxed, suburban feel.  The hotel itself is contemporary and luxurious.  The rooms are spacious and spotless with large modern bathrooms.  The staff could not have been more accommodating, always pleasant and willing to answer questions.  It is situated a short two block walk from the beaches.  We had been told that the  city beaches were not as nice as those further up the coast but we found them quite comfortable, clean and perfectly adequate for unwinding after two weeks of ambitious sight-seeing.  The beaches and the water were both clean.  There were chairs and umbrellas readily available for rental and numerous places directly on the beach where you could enjoy food and beverages.   Restrooms and  showers are also situated at convenient intervals along the beach.  Families should be aware that topless sunbathing is common on these beaches.  
Across the street from the hotel is a large shopping mall which we enjoyed visiting.  There are numerous places in the mall to eat and we found it to be a huge advantage.  As we were in the relaxation mode, we stayed at the beach until 8 PM and wandered over to the mall for dinner at 9. We enjoyed several tapas restaurants that were quite good and reasonable for a family of four. There is also a large Supermarket in the mall which is interesting just for the array of foods and wines offered.  It was also a great place to pick up some beverages and snacks for the beach.
All in all, if you are looking for a comfortable place to relax and enjoy the sunshine for a few days, I would recommend this hotel.",5,2011,12,22
36,10 out of 10,"Fantastic 4 day break, given to me by my wife as part of my big 50 celebrations. Not pre-arranged or ordered by my wife, however on the first evening, chocolate cake and bottle of champagne delivered to the room - nice touch. Staff could not have been more helpful. We had a junior suite, which had wonderful views over the beach - and just as importantly, we had access to the executive lounge. The qulaity of food and drink was impressive and it was a great way to start off your eveing relaxing in the lounge. Location of the hotel I think is very good. You have a nearby underground station - 10 min walk - which takes about 15 mins into the centre. We bought a T10 ticket - ie 10 trips - for €8.25: excellent value! Trains ran frequenlty and the whole system was easy to use. Opposite the hotel, you also have a great shopping mall: if you want to buy children's clothes, there are some very good shops inside. Plus there is a huge hypermarket. Take a walk along the beach and after 10 mins you will come across a superb restaurant, Boo's - definitely worth a visit. All in all, definitely recommend the hotel - upgrade to an executive room as well.",5,2011,12,19
36,business hotel - right next to the convention centre,"stayed here during world architecture festival for business.  Perfect as right next door to the convention centre. also next to a shopping centre.  I was upgraded to a so called 'sea view' really a view across a car park and into an office block with a side view of grotty concrete walkway next to the sea.  Not pretty!

Rooms are very functiional and would recommend - spacious with a comfortable bed and good bathroom (shower over bath though).

not romantic or cool or an architectural masterpiece, but perfectly adequate for a business trip with great location if you a working at a convention.",3,2011,12,16
36,Very average 4 star hotel,"I have stayed before in Barcelona but in other, more central located hotels but because of Hilton December sale, I wanted to try the Hilton Diagonal Del Mar in Barcelona.

I landed around 15.00 in the afternoon in Barcelona El Prat airport, after a quick walk I took a taxi to the hotel. The hotel is about 25-30 minutes by taxi away from the airport and will cost around 30 euro one way, on a normal working day. I arrived on a public holiday so the price was around 45 euro one way.

The taxi arrived around 15.45 at the hotel but nobody came to help me with my luggage. Once I entered the hotel, finally someone helped me with my bags. The lobby area was empty and I proceeded to the Hhonors check in where I checked in with a lady. She wore a light brown dress but no name tag or something on her. The lady, called Raquel was unfortunately not friendly at all and the check in was very short and all without a smile. She asked my id card and that’s all. I was more a number in the line who had to check in. The stay was booked under Hhonors gold card but she refused to give me anything of the benefits. No club lounge access, no internet, no room upgrade or even no breakfast. I was very unsatisfied and wanted to speak with her supervisor. Mr. Javier came to me but he just told me he could not do anything. I then asked for the duty manager to call me when I would be in my room.

I so left the reception with a very, very bad first impression of the hotel and its staff members. I went to my room on the 16th floor. My room was at the end of the short corridor, number 1619.

The room was typical Hilton and when I entered on my right side was a bathroom with a sink, bath, shower and toilet. There were new Hilton bath products, clean towels but there was no soap at all. The bathroom was clean but the shower was leaking and the showerhead was not fixed properly.

Then the bedroom, there was a kettle with tea bags, a TV, desk, two rather small Twin beds, closet with safe and a small seating area.

My room had partially City and also a bit sea view and also not to forget on the terrace of the executive lounge one floor beneath me.

There was no welcome letter, no welcome drink, no fruit or not even a complimentary bottle of water in the room. Not even for Gold members and it was the first time ever we did not get any welcome in the room. 
A few minutes later, the duty manager Mr. Domenico called me and I explained the situation and the inconveniences at check in. He first of all apologized for it and he could not confirm any of my benefits as there were hardly staff members in the hotel who could decide about this. He was apparently the Food and Beverage manager so he invited me for complimentary breakfast during my stay in the main restaurant on the first floor.

It was the first time at any Hilton I got problems like these. I went to the reception and asked another lady, not the unfriendly Ms. Raquel, for some directions to the city center. From her accent I think she was German. She explained me the way to the metro, highlights in Barcelona and gave me some maps. I left the hotel and after a 10 minute walk I arrived at the closest metro station : Forum. Line 4 passes there and it are 7 stops before the city center. I got off at Jaume I and I walked a bit around.

Next morning I proceeded to the main restaurant to have breakfast. I was friendly greeted by Mr. Giovanni who brought me to a table and offered me some fresh orange juice and asked me if I wanted to drink something. He was extremely friendly and helpful too. After a few minutes Mr. Pablo brought me a hot chocolate. The hot chocolate was slightly cold and was just a mix of powder and milk. Mr. Pablo was also very friendly .

Buffet is extensive and there is a wide choice of charcuterie like fresh smoked salmon, jamon and there was even a tasty Spanish corner with typical things like fuet. Buffet was extremely good and had higher standards than most Hilton hotels. Service was excellent and everything was filled regularly.

After breakfast I called Mr. Domenico back and first of all said that breakfast was escellent but I also asked if he already heard something. He told me he had to ask it to the general manager, Mr. Rodriguez but or he could not reach him or he was in a meeting or he had lunch. During my stay I never got a reply on my questions of the benefits and so never got them.

I spend a whole day in the city and in the evening my room was cleaned properly but the tea bags were not refilled. Some people contacted me by phone but on all hotel phones I had a lot of noise and I could hardly hear the other side. Also when I took a bath, there was hardly hot water and I had to put it on 50-60 degrees Celsius before even some hot water came.

Next morning again breakfast but unfortunately it was not as good as the day before. As nobody came to greet me I just took a table and waited before someone came. Mr. Giovanni was not in the restaurant and Mr. Pablo was very busy. After 10 minutes Mr. Pablo saw me and gave me some orange juice and my hot chocolate. Service was too slow that day and the bottles of water and juices were empty for a long time. Then after a while Mr. Giovanni came and things were better then. Fruit that day was excellent and the fuet was very tasty and one of my favorites at the buffet.

I went to the reception and asked if I could print my boarding cards somewhere. Ms. Laurine, who was in training told me I could use the hotels paid computer for it. I was a bit amazed as most 4 and 5 star hotels provide this service complimentary. Then Mr. Oscar came and I asked it again for the boarding cards. He told me I could use the designated laptop free of charge for boarding card on the left of the reception. Mr. Oscar was very friendly and I asked him also if I could have a late check out for next day. My flight was around 20.15 and I got a very late check out at 17.30 free of charge from the friendly Mr. Oscar.

I went to the laptop to print my boarding card but the keyboard was not working at all so I asked Ms. Iona for help. She was too very friendly and fixed the problem after a few minutes.

I headed back to my room and very strangely on my floor, all room doors were open and the locks were drilled out. It was a ghost floor but only my room was still intact. The work men closed a door in front of my door but my room key did not work on that one so I had to go back downstairs and I asked Ms. Veronica for recoding the key. She did and also sent Mr. Alexander with me to check if the door worked now, and yes it did.

During that day I had a lot of noise disturbance and it was not easy to ignore the sounds so I left the hotel but before that I asked to Mr. Edgar for some information about my next hotel in Madrid, also a Hilton. He checked for me the hours of the shuttle bus there and helped me with some directions.

I asked some directions again to Ms. Raquel, now with name tag on. She spoke very loud and she was explaining some bars to have drink but in fact she lead us to the more disco area of Barcelona.

I arrived back in the hotel in the later evening and it was deserted, reception closed and nobody in the hotel but the door was luckily open.

Next morning last breakfast and I was greeted by Mr. Pablo who gave me a hand and asked if everything was fine. No hot chocolate for me anymore and breakfast was again very good. Mr. Giovanni said goodbye to me and I went back to my room and headed to the Sagrada Familia.

In the afternoon I was back and they were still working at the doors next to me. I checked later in the afternoon out with Mr. Oscar and left the hotel by taxi.

Taxis are plentiful in front of the hotel and metro stations is 10 minutes away.

Overall a very average impression from a zero percent goodwill hotel and with somewhat mixed staff. The one is extremely friendly, the other one not. The hotel had 4 stars and the rate is at the high side for the quality and service you get. The location is out of the city center but is reachable in 30 minutes by metro or 15 minutes by taxi. I do not think I will ever return here, if I would it will be for the excellent breakfast !",3,2011,12,15
36,"Nice Hilton, worth the detour.","Large spacious rooms, excellent service, excellent benefits for HH members, very nice lounge.  The location is not the best, requires public transportation or taxi to downtown and most touristic sights.  However, the quality of accommodation and service makes it worthwhile.  Taxi fares are very reasonable (around 10 EU to most places of interest).  Just across the road is a shopping mall with a good reasonably priced fish restaurant (ask concierge for directions).
We had a very good time.",4,2011,12,10
36,"Ultra nice comtemporary hotel..pricy but worth it! close to the beach, mall and metro","This is a very nice Hilton hotel in which they trat you like royalty!
But is expensive ...I can recommend this hotel for a honey moon!
And definately book it if you are a GOLD or Diamond on hilton brand...lots of extra goodies!!
Close close close to the beach!!",4,2011,12,08
36,Nothing in life is free...,"And certainly not at this hotel.

Sandwiched between a rather large shopping mall and the sea, this is a Hilton in every way, likely catering to a rather upscale crowd interested in shopping.  The rooms are spacious, the bathrooms large (by European standards), equipped with both a bathtub and a separate shower. The environs are indistinguishable from any other modern city, so the classical, folkloric attractions require a taxi ride. The airport is far away, but accessible by motorway/freeway.

The hotel is not cheap to begin with. but in addition to the nightly rate, breakfast costs 24 Euros, Internet is 12 Euros for 1 hour, or 27 Euros per day - everywhere in the hotel, including the rooms.

My take is, unless you absolutely must have the Hilton experience, there are less expensive places that provide comparable accomodations.",3,2011,12,06
36,Brilliant,"I havr stayed many times at the Hilton Diagonal Mar in Barcelona and I love it   - nice staff, great rooms, pool, large terrace, breakfast is excellent - overall very nice!",5,2011,12,04
36,Tennessee Traveller,"Great sea view and sunrise views from  my room on the 20th floor. A bit far from the center of the city, but metro (train) stop is 5 min. from hotel and it is the quickest way to travel around the city. Mini bar items and local telephone calls are very expensive. Also, internet is not free. Staff is friendly, decor is pleasing and contemporary, and rooms have great hardwood floors. Executive floor offers delicious items for continental breakfast, snacks, drinks, cocktails, etc. City views from the upper floors are also wonderful.",4,2011,11,28
36,Nice spot,"This is a very good location.  We had a nice view of the Mediterranean and the beach - which is 2-3 blocks away.  On the other side is a large modern mall with a lot of options foe eating and shopping.  There is even a super market in the mall.  The front desk and the doormen were very helpful - especially with getting a taxi and explaining to the driver where you wanted to go.
The included breakfast was very impressive with just about anything you might want - we did find everything to be not more than luke-warm.",4,2011,11,28
36,Very pleased with this hotel but far away from the old city center,"We were on the executive floor with a great full Mediterranean Sea view. We liked that the room had wood floors which we think are easier to keep clean than carpet hotel rooms. Also, the room safe was sufficiently large for our computer. The staff were attentive and very helpful.  We frequently used the metro. The L4 yellow line metro stop is not visible from the hotel. You have a short walk of maybe 10 minutes and it is located behind a square redbrick apartment complex. We felt safe and secure walking to it. Make sure you click on the English icon to activate the ticket machine for English. We used the “T-10” metro ticket which cost 8.50 euros. It is good for 10 rides and we shared it. It is about 8 stops on L4 to the Gothic section. You can figure about 2 minutes per stop. Add more time if you make a transfer. BEWARE—upon leaving a very crowded car, I discovered that one of the pockets on my multi-zipper backpack had been opened. That section contained nothing and I was lucky. Thereafter, I held the backpack in my hands on the metro.",4,2011,11,23
36,Great executive level rooms,If you are attending an event at the congress centre then this is a good choice. Beware the minbar and also the hotelbar prices are unreasonable considering the value and quality as alternatives in Barcelona. Wi-fi is also expensive considering that each hotel in Barcelona during my last 3 visits in Barcelona offered free wi-fi. So hidden costs can add up! I did not see the room rates as this was pre-paid but on check-out it took them a long time to find my original invoices for the hotel bar which I needed for my expense claims. So probably there is a potential from improvement,3,2011,11,23
36,Excellent Value - Very out of the way location,"We enjoyed our stay here last May prior to embarking on a cruise.  The hotel is directly across from a large shopping center.  You do not get any of the feel for the city of Barcelona when you stay here.  We took a bus to the center of town.  This was about a 45 minute ride.  The hotel itself was lovely but it feels like you are staying in the U.S. with none of the ambiance of Spain.  Our room was lovely and the service was great.  However, if your aim is a business trip or you just need a place to stay until your cruise leaves, then this hotel is a great value.",4,2011,11,19
36,Quiet Stay with Killer View,"Traveled en famille and on points just this past weekend. Upgraded to corner room on 21st floor. View to die for. Nicely appointed room; very spacious for the three of us. Bathroom was large, sep. shower and bath and bidet. I enjoyed taking a bath with views of the Med from the window. Lounge was wonderful as was service. Breakfast was more than filling with great variety. Tea time had an equally nice spread. We drove so we used the hotel garage. Ate in town off Ramblas (Taller de Tapas--great!!) one evening and across from hotel at Let's Wok (wow! talk about a seafood nirvana!). We drove around town with no problem; Indeed, I found hotel fairly well located. Metro and bus directly across street. Someone cut our tire on the first evening in hopes of ensnaring us in the Barcelona two-step scam of helping you only to charge you highway robbery or take your car off of you. Luckily we were only 2 blocks from hotel. Having French plates made us easy marks. Still love Barcelona and Gaudi. And the Hilton staff were incredibly helpful during this stressful time.",5,2011,11,15
36,could be much better!,"family vacation, 4 nights 2 rooms, 

I actually called the hotel and made reservations over the phone (inter call) to make sure that I get two rooms on high floor. I called way ahead of time and paid for 4 nights. This will be my first stay in Barcelona and wanted it to be perfect. 

It was anything but perfect! I arrived after a 6 hour flight and had to carry my bags all the way to the front desk. there was no help at the door. Then, to my surprise, I was told that no rooms are available (I arrived at 3 pm) and had to wait until 7 pm. For any one who did an international travel with kids will understand how tough that is. The receiptionest, who was very rude and unhelpful, told me the wait is ineeded because I asked for  two connecting rooms on high floors. 

After all the wait and pain, I ended up receiving the 3rd floor rooms with very bad views. No apology for delay, etc. After 2 nights, It was very painful to stay any longer in this super boring hotel. 

 The hotel is good for business, but, for vacations, it is horrible. 

the swiming pool was small, and the  beach was a long walk, and the hotel doesn't realize there is a beach near by that perhaps should help the customers go to it!

I ended up leaving after two nights, and moved to another hotel, for much less cost and tripple the fun. I finly felt the true taste of Barchelona

I will never stay here again. 

If you are in business, and have a ton of points or its is paid for by your company, then fine, however, if you want to have fun, get closer to town and don't waste your money in a pure business hotel that is so boring and doesn't have the Barcelona taste. then stay away from this overrated hotel.

I wish I have the name of that rude receptionist, however, I don't believe management cares.",2,2011,11,10
36,It's a Hilton it's what you expect :),"I think in general when you're staying in a Hilton you know what you're going to get. It doesn't disappoint but it generally costs a bit as well. The location is good within 5 minutes walking distance of the metro and a largish supermarket. Few ok restaurants around as well.

I was there on business so maybe things would have been different if I'd been with my partner who knows maybe next time.

Staff on the front desk speak English so there's no issues there either as you'd expect.

The hotel I don't feel however gives any feel for the city but if you like a bit of luxury while you're staying there then it's as good as place as any :)",5,2011,11,10
36,Great Location,"Stayed at this hotel for a conference being held at the CCIB which is right next door.  You DO have to walk outside to get from the hotel to the conference center but even in the rain it was not bad as the two are really close to each other.  Had room service once for dinner and it was great.  I did have to dial the room service folks 4 times before someone answered the phone.  I had breakfast in the concierge room on the 15th floor a few times and also in the regular restaurant on premise.  Both were free.  The amount of breakfast choices in the restaurant was terrific.  The concierge breakfast was not bad, much smaller room and less selection but very quiet compared to the restaurant.  Everything in my room worked fine and the bed was comfortable.  I used the business center and it was fine.  I need to send a package back home to the US and the lady working there was very helpful.  I had a few times when some of the elevator doors would not close all the way and you had to open and close them a number of times and sometimes use your hands to force them to go together so the elevator would move.  I also had to use a key card to access my floor and sometimes had to put it in numerous times to get it to go to my floor.  There is a mall across the street from the hotel and it had a lot of choices.  Unfortunately I only had a little time to explore it.  The food court looked quite extensive.  I would definitely come back to this hotel again if I were in this area for business.",5,2011,11,09
36,"Very good hotel, enjoyed my stay thoroughly","I arrived one Sunday night tired from my flight and in need of some relaxation.  I was greeted with a warm smile by reception on the ground floor who checked me in quickly and I was headed up to my room on the 23rd floor in just minutes.  The lady at reception didn’t mention that I could have checked in on the 15th floor in the executive lounge but then I did receive a complimentary upgrade to the executive floor and so I wasn’t really that fussed.

The room was a corner room and very nicely appointed.  The bathroom had a separate bath and shower, a bidet, a toilet and a glass bowl for the sink which was funky.  All the usuals were on offer, too – oversized toiletries from Crabtree & Evelyn, soft bath robes, slippers and fluffy towels, and there was a small but stylish window over the bath tub which afforded great views of the Sagrada Familial cathedral once you were in the tub itself – which I just had to try out and nice it was, too.

Returning to the bedroom, the bed was comfortable and complete with soft and hard pillows.  The TV was a flat screen variety and came with multiple channels so I could switch between MTV, CNN, BBC World, CNBC as well as numerous Spanish, Italian, French and German channels.  Great to catch up on some of the programs I used to watch when I lived abroad.  Complimentary internet was offered given my status, which was great, though had I not been offered the vouchers, I would have been incensed with the prices the Swisscom Wi-Fi command.  Basically, it costs 27 Euros for 24 hours access which I believe is too much and it is with constant amazement that I wonder why the Hilton Corporation continues to do business with Swisscom when there must be better and cheaper deals out there for the end-user.  So just beware, if you don’t get given a voucher and you want to go online, you will have to stump up 27 Euros per day for the privilege.

I stayed 3 nights in total and headed each morning to the executive lounge on the 15th floor.  Beware that you will to insert your key card into the elevator slot to make it stop on the executive floors.  Breakfast – despite the continental description – was sumptuous and complete with local specialities and great coffee.  I particularly liked the freshly squeezed orange juice and the local queso.  In the afternoon, the lounge serves a great afternoon tea complete with cakes and cookies and then come the evening, the liquor is brought out and folks descend on the lounge to enjoy cocktails with nibbles, which are rather delicious.  Internet access in the lounge is the same as in the rooms, so if you don’t have a voucher, you will need to stump up again.  And even the two computer terminals (offered again by rip-off merchant Swisscom) in the lounge charge you for internet access.

One nice feature of the lounge is the outside terrace area where there is ample seating and from where you have a great view of the Mediterranean sea.  It’s a great place to have drinks, your breakfast or indeed afternoon tea, as long as it is warm enough.

I had room service one evening in my room and thought it was a little overpriced.  I had a chicken salad and a glass of wine – the bill came to €31.  I was shocked.  Sure, the hotel has overheads and costs, but 42 USD is tough to swallow when it is hardly fine dining.  

Other features of the hotel that I enjoyed were the gym.  A little on the small side, it has all the main equipment including treadmills, bikes, rowing machines, cross trainers and weights.  There is a sauna too though I did not have time to use it.  There is also a great outdoor pool and bar which in the summer months must get packed, but I visited the hotel in November and there was no-one outside at the pool at the time.

In total, I enjoyed the hotel immensely.  Sure, there are a few niggles )overpriced internet access and room service), but don’t let these put you off.  The service, smiles and hospitality afforded to you by reception, the lounge staff and the chambermaids make up for it all.  

I have also stayed at the other Hilton in Barcelona on the other side of town and enjoyed that one, too.  It would seem that the Hiltons in this Catalan city can be justifiably proud of the service and comfort that they offer.  I hope to return to the fun city soon.",5,2011,11,09
36,Good Place to Stay,"We stayed two nights at the Hilton Diagonal Mar after deciding to stay a few extra days in Barcelona.  As a Diamond member we had access to a great room with a sea view, and the Executive floor. Room was very comfortable and quiet.  Breakfast on the executive floor was not up to Hilton usual standards, but was ok.  Coffee from machine was bad.  Staff was not very helpful, asked for help with figuring out a train reservation and was told to go to the station. Other hotels we stayed at in Spain helped us figure out schedules etc.  Staff also took a long time to find my reservation.

Location is out of the way, but the metro is only two blocks away and blue line takes you into town.  There are restruants within walking distance near the old Olympic village which give you a local flavor.  We skipped the fast food places across the street, heard nothing but bad about those. Did not eat at the hotel, as there was a huge Citrix convention going on, and everything was crowded.  

Overall, good stay and nice room. If only the coffee was better....",4,2011,11,07
36,"Wonderful service, better than most other Hiltons","I stayed at the Hilton Diagonal Mar for the second time in October 2011 and was even more impressed than last year. I made Hilton Honors gold membership this year, and was immediately treated to a room upgrade to the executive floor, complementary wife (I believe €20 per day otherwise) and access to the executive lounge. The lounge is fabulous, with a great sunny roof terrace overlooking the ocean and town centre. The continental buffet breakfast has everything you could wish for apart from the cooked items. Afternoon tea features 4 or 5 different kinds of sweets, followed by a few hours of tappas and drinks in the early evening. Staff in the lounge were very helpful with travel tips and dinner reservations, printing off maps for you to make sure you knew where you were going. I will definately return to this Hilton on my next visit to Barcelona. A big thumbs up to all the staff that work here.",5,2011,11,05
36,Wonderful place to stay to explore Barcelona,"This was the first stop on our two-week honeymoon in Spain. It was my first trip overseas. We arrived at the hotel after an overnight flight from DC. Even though we were early, the staff (who spoke English) got us into our room right away. They also made sure we had maps of the city, and gave us a very comprehensive, quick, overview of the city. 

Our room, on the executive floor, was wonderful. The view of the Mediterranean was stunning, and the whole room was light, airy, clean, and contemporary. The bathroom included a bathtub and a separate shower. The features, especially the bathroom fixtures and closet/mirrors, were very modern and attractive. The bed was the softest we encountered in Spain. We got very good rest, and were ready to tackle the city the next day.

The hotel is in an area of Barcelona away from downtown. It's an area that's recently been developed and renovated, so there's some food and shopping, though nothing special. Others have noted that it's about a €15 or €20 cab ride to the major downtown attractions. This is true. However, it's also totally unnecessary. The hotel is about a five-minute walk from a metro station. We got a pass for ten metro trips for €7.50 (two people can use the same pass). Two ten-trip passes kept us busy for our entire three-day stay and allowed us to eat at wonderful restaurants, and see the fountains, the cathedrals, and most of the main attractions. We always felt safe walking back to the hotel at night. The metro is very easy to navigate. 

We never made it to the executive lounge for breakfast, but we did enjoy taking breaks to enjoy refreshments out on the balcony. It offers a wonderful view of the city and the sea, and is a perfect place to plan your next foray.",4,2011,11,03
36,Fantastic,"We stayed here 4 nights in July and I'm sorry that I'm only posting now because the hotel was fabulous.  Having stayed at other hotels in Barcelona city center (reviews to come), I much prefer staying at this hotel and commuting in.  

Rooms:  Wonderful plush beds and fantastic down pillows.  Satellite tv with a good number of English channels.  Only complaint is reception was a bit fuzzy.  Bose stereo system is a bonus. 

Bathrooms:  Excellent.  Separate showers and soaking spa tubs equipped with TV.  Full size hair dryers and a wide range of toiletries, including conditioner.

Pool: Again top notch with tons of loungers on the deck, friendly staff and full bar/restaurant facilities.

Gym:  Small given that this hotel is geared towards conference goers.

Wifi:  Overpriced and a shame, thankfully my company has a service where I can access it gratis.

Downside:  There really are no restaurants in this area but the short trip in still makes it worthwhile; and if you're in need of some snacks head to the basement at Alcampo and stock up on wine, cava, olives and jamon.

We got a fantastic deal on priceline and extended it because we were so pleased.  So many other hotels that we stayed at in Barcelona had thin walls, hard beds and were overpriced. Overall the size and quality of the rooms coupled with the amenities of a Hilton make this a perfect hotel",5,2011,11,02
36,"Good location, new and modern","The hotel was located a 10 min train ride from the center of the city with a metro station nearby. It was nice not stay in the hussle and bussle of the CBD, however I felt that the hotel lacked atmosphere. It is more of a Corporate / Conference hotel - however the facilities were great. The staff in the Exec Lounge were very friendly and helpful.",4,2011,11,02
36,Nice Blend of Service and Facilities,"Although we only stayed here one night before our cruise (and arrived around 8:30 pm) the hotel staff treated us like we were staying for a month. We had a great corner room on a high floor with a terrific view of the city and sea. The room was more than adequate, nicely furnished with a bathroom large enough for two. The staff was courteous at check-in and checking out the next morning.",5,2011,10,31
36,Superb!,"Late May of this year we stayed for the first half of our honeymoon at the Hilton Diagonal Mar.  It had everything we looked for and more! Upon arrival we had a bottle of champagne and tiramisú waiting for us at the room.  Both were exquisite.  We stayed in room 1818, which had a mixed view of both, the Mediterranean and the city of Barcelona.  Breakfast was fantastic!  The Diagonal Mar shopping mall is right across the street where there is also a Bus Turístic stop.  There are taxis lined up 24/7 so you can catch one any time you like.  Even when it may be kinda pricey and a bit far from the city center, I would definitely recommend it.  Thumbs up, Hilton!",5,2011,10,31
36,Great pre cruise stay,"We chose this Hilton hotel as a Hilton member and due to a good discount in one of the Hilton flash sales.
The hotel is a 15min drive from la ramblas but to be honest we did quite like the fact that we werent bang smack in the centre where it's very noisy and quiet. We were very close to the beach and also across the road from a large shopping mall where you can get everything you need.
We chose an upgraded junior suite which was a fab corner room with amazing views over the beach/pool area and it had a lovely swimming pool.  It wasn't an exec room so we didn't have access to the exec floor but this wasn't a concern.  Our room wasn't ready when we arrived but the staff offered us free drinks whilst we waited.
The breakfast was lovely and had a lot of choice although it was very busy and fairly noisy with lots of families using the hotel as a pre cruise hotel.
I would recommend the hotel but if you wish to spend a lot of time in central Barcelona city you need to budget for cab journeys.  About €15 per journey to las ramblas or Plaza de catalunya. 
Pool and bar area outside was very nice in the baking heat and we did enjoy a few hours sunbathing.
Perfect pre cruise hotel and would return.",4,2011,10,31
36,Wonderful time in Barcelona,"We were guests at the Barcelona Hilton Diagonal Mar for a week and a half in October, 2011.  We had a wonderful time throughout our stay.  Vacationers seem to be mostly aware that this is a business hotel primarily, so rooms are not designed for lengthy stays.  Room decor is very modern and comfortable, but there are no drawers for storage. The design is not handy for unpacking our clothes, but we made do with the shelves provided.  The hotel staff from the valets to front desk staff to executive lounge staff to housekeeping to restaurant staff were all very gracious and helpful to us at all times.  Since a previous reviewer noted issues with the valet service, we would like to report that we were met by a valet at the taxi for our fairly early morning arrival, with our luggage taken care of until we were able to check into our room.  On departure, we again had excellent valet service with his helping deposit our luggage into the cab and arranging our method of payment with the not-quite-fluent, although very friendly, cab driver.  My husband is a Hilton diamond member so we were able to use the executive lounge.  We had hoped to be upgraded to a better room as some reviewers have reported, but the hotel was almost continuously booked with conferences and this was not possible.  Our room on the twenty-first floor had a good view of the Mediterranean, although there is a street with businesses between the hotel and ocean, as one would expect in a business district.  The food provided in the lounge was delicious and plentiful for breakfast and dinner (tapas) with desserts provided at tea-time.  The staff manning the desk in the executive lounge were helpful with our tourist questions, and the servers were very good natured and non-obtrusive in keeping tables cleared, food and drinks readily available, and the patrons happy during our extended stay.   How could our stay have been perfect?  A guest laundry would have been nice, since the laundry service prices are prohibitive to folks like us on vacation.  However, we were able to locate a very nice laundromat on 41 Carrer del Clot, riding the lovely new tram located very near the hotel - La Farinera station, just a short walk from there.   We toted our dirty clothes in our rolling suitcase and were able to find the laundromat easily on this picturesque street.  When we had difficulty figuring out how to work the machines, a couple of manicurists from the spa across the street who were also doing laundry eagerly assisted us - although neither of us spoke the other's language.  We would have also appreciated a gift shop in or near the hotel.  Although there is a large shopping center across the street, it is fairly generic and could easily be in our own towns at home - with the exception of some local restaurants.  Since we are procrastinators and had delayed finding gifts for our family and friends at home, we could find nothing in the area that was uniquely Barcelona or Spain.  We were told by the helpful lady at the front desk that local arts and crafts items could only be obtained uptown.  One would think even conference attendees in such a beautiful city would appreciate having quality local items to take home to their loved ones.  Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed this hotel and our stay in beautiful Barcelona.  We hope to return one day.",5,2011,10,31
36,Be careful where you go.,"We showed the taxi driver our reservation with name and address on it. After unloading our luggage we were told we were at the wrong Hilton Hotel/ That's after a 30 Euro cab ride. Back in the cab and another 25 Euro cab ride and we are in the correct place. Taxi's can't go to the main door. They have to stay on the street even though there is a huge open area in front of the hotel. No assistance with out barrage at all from the hotel. No help inside either. We were loaded because this was a 11 day trip with cruise. 
The building is nice and the rooms are clean and bright. I got a major savings by going with Hotel.com instead of Hilton directly. So much for my Hilton Honors membership.",4,2011,10,28
36,Very good Hotel,"Well, this may be not the best hotel in the world, but it sure is a very good hotel. In my opinion it is between 4 and 5 stars. The hotel has officially 4 stars, so yes they don't bring your suitecase to your room, but he if this is a 4 star Hilton, I sure want to see a 5 star Hilton, it must be amazing.

My room is on the top floor (23) with great view on the sea. The room is realy nice and very clean. The room has everyting you need. Good bed, very quiet room, so a good night sleep. 

Staff is very nice. 

Nice gym and sauna. Only outsite pool, that is the only downsite of the hotel, no indoor pool. Pool is closed in winter. 

Breakfast is amazing, they have everything you need and very good quality.

Internet access is free of charge (offered by Citrix). I read normaly the charge you quite a lot euro's per night for internet access, if this is true it is a real ripoff internet in a hotel should be free of charge. In my case, it was free of charge and it worked realy good. 

Everything in this hotel (food, drinks) are realy expensive. 

The Hotel is located near the CCIB congress centre. Good for business but not so good location for a City Trip.",5,2011,10,27
36,Great Place to stay,"As Hilton Diamond members, we were upgraded to an executive room overlooking the sea which is only a 5 minute stroll away. The room was large, well lit, and brightly decorated. There is sufficient storage space, a comfortable bed, and a relaxing chair. The bathroom is quite large but the sink, although it looks wonderful, it is too small and causes splashes.
The executive lounge has an adequate continental breakfast and various foods during the day with an array of nibbles in the evening. Beer, wine, and soft drinks are available with spirits available in the evening. It has an indoor and outdoor area and is a quiet retreat for some reading. The only drawback is that there is a small charge for the use of the computer but wifi is available throughout the hotel (free for Diamond members).     
The buffet breakfast in the restaurant is extensive and can set you up for the day.
There is a good shopping mall directly across the road with many shops and eateries.
Although the hotel is out of the city centre, the metro station is only a few minutes walk away and the Barcelona tour buses stop across the street. The metro pass allows travel on the metro, tram, and local buses and is execellent value as it also gives free access to many attractions.
All-in-all this hotel is well worth a visit.",5,2011,10,26
36,Great Pre-Cruise Stay,"Our group booked this hotel during a Hilton Promotion.  The rate included one of the best buffet breakfast that I have tasted.  The reservation staff and the events coordinator, Tamara provided us with a wealth of information, made lunch reservations and arranged transports for us from the airport and to the port. Every staff member that we encountered on our first trip to Barcelona or Europe was friendly and helpful.

If you have the opportunity to upgrade your room to  Club Level, do so.  The views of the sea and the Tapas and beverages offered each evening was a great way to spend the evening with many other English -speaking guest, who were there for a cruise.  The views from the lounge were breathtaking.

The rooms were clean and comfortable.  Ask for a high floor to avoid the noise or concerts in the area.  The rooms have a shower and tub. There's limited choices if you need three or four for a room.  The twins are twin beds.

We had the best  18 euros hamburger in the lounge that I have ever tasted.  We had an early flight so we ordered a continental breakfast from  room service.  That was 20 euros per person.  The food and drinks are expensive in the hotel, but there's a shopping mall across the street with a food and wine shop and restaurants.  We ate lunch at The Crazy Crab because we wanted to taste the Paella.  It was a little different that the Paella that we were used to, but the views  of the beach and sea took my breath away.  After taking a taxi and walking to the restaurant , we were all thirsty and felt that the water offered was the best that we've tried.  Beware we were charged  26 euros for water!

Some of my group caught the tour bus in front of the hotel to see Barcelona.  Half of the group contracted Barcelona Day Tours for a four hour Gaudi private tour.  The private tour was great if you have a limited time to see the sights.  If you book a private tour, pay the full amount online and request to tour the inside of  La Sagra Familia.  Balances must be paid in euros when they pick you up and the guide had very little change.

The pool area is beautiful, but closed in October.

If you want a quiet , clean, elegant,hotel, away from the city, Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona
is a great choice.  I plan to stay here again when I return to Barcelona.  Thank you Tamara and all of staff that assisted my group.  We loved the hotel and Barcelona!",5,2011,10,24
36,Nice stay,"I spent two nights at the Hilton (mix of business and leisure trip). The location of the hotel is a bit out of town but all parts of town are easily accessible via the underground which is very near. 

As many people mentioned there is a big shopping mall opposite the hotel. Don't go on Saturdays - it is too crowded and noisy. You have a good selection of shops. 

We got a room with sea view which is nice. Overall the room was ok; not fantastic but good. We had some problems with our TV and bathroom washing basin. Everything was fixed within the hour we called reception.

Breakfast was ok. Again not fantastic but you could find a good selection of fruit, bread, etc...

Overall a fine hotel. A shame internet/wifi in the rooms is not free of charge...

Try not to book directly with the hotel - via booking.com, etc... rates are more interesting.

Cheers, Sara",4,2011,10,24
36,good,"It's relatively new and its Hilton. So, pretty good hotel. 
Swimming pool. Not heated, so only during Summer. We used it middle of October and... it was on the edge (and this October it was very hot!). Decent gym. 
Area is nice and relatively quiet. Big shopping mall with all kinds of basic food just across. The hotel's bar is a ripp off. 3.5 Euro for a coffee is not normal for Barcelona. Go to the shopping mall and get one for 1/3. All in all good. I would return.",4,2011,10,23
36,Triathlon friendly hotel!,"Stayed for three nights to attend the Garmin triathlon. The official hotel was one block away and this Hilton was even closer to the venue. Staff were very attentive during the whole stay. We travelled with two massive bike bags and all our kit. Room was large enough to assemble and keep both bikes in the room without getting in the way. Requested a late checkout and they allowed a 3pm checkout without further charge. Very convenient for the Shopping mall and cinemas just across the road. Gym, sauna and pool are very convenient, the pool should have been closed at this time of the year, but due to very hot weather they kept it open. Only let down was not having free wireless internet, but this seems to be the norm with all Hiltons I have visited.",5,2011,10,22
36,pre-cruise stop in a nice hotel,"We stayed here in late August 2011 for a 3 night stop before a med cruise.

We caught a taxi from the airport to the hotel which cost approx 30 Euros. The hotel is well maintained and the roof top pool is very nice.

We found the mall across the street to be a great additon, and there are a selection of restaurants, as well as fast food places there, which was great as we knew we could get food on the doorstep if we wanted it. The breakfast buffet is excellent, with lots of choice.

The reception staff were fast and although didnt give the an overwelling welcome- i have no complaints. We did ask the reception staff on two seperte occasions for local information and transport links, and they were VERY helpful (thank you)

the Tram is a short walk through the mall and the door staff are very helpful in finding taxis should you need them. Whilst this hotel isnt right in the centre of the city, it's nice and quiet and public transport makes it easy to access Barcelona.",4,2011,10,16
36,Big Disappointment,"After arriving from a flight from London, My husband and I checked into this hotel for one night since we had a flight home the next day. We stayed at the Hotel Arts a few days prior, but thought we would stay here for a night since we booked with a voucher from Expedia.com. Big mistake! When you arrive the staff does not help you with your luggage or show you to your room, they just stand and point to where you should go. There is a shopping mall across the street, but it's crowded and filled with mainly fast food restaurants which are not good. Also there is a foul odor that is in front of the hotel that smells like sewage.  A previous guest stated the wifi was free, it's not. The wifi was 22.00 euros for 24 hours for one device. The cost is extra for more than one device.

 If you're looking for a hotel that's close to the metro and the center of the city, this is NOT it. This hotel seems to be more for business, not a romantic getaway. If you're used to a five star level hotel, pay a little more and go with the Hotel Arts instead.",2,2011,10,15
36,An Executive Room with a Sea View a Must!!,"Our stay at this Hilton was AMAZING!! Yes, it is a little outside the main city sights, but the hotel...in particular the Executive Lounge and the sea views, made the stay completely worth it. First off, the hotel is not that far from the sights and there are many ways to get there easily. There is a subway stop no more than a 3-5 minute walk from the hotel and will get you to all parts of Barcelona within 10 minutes. You can also take a taxi, which is what we did in the evenings when we went out to dinner, which is very easy and inexpensive. There is a mall across the street with a grocery store, shops, department store, quickie food restaurants, etc, which is nice should you need to pick something up. The hotel itself has very nice rooms, but what makes a stay here is access to the Executive Lounge and a room with a sea view. The executive floors are 15 and 19-23 and the Executive Lounge is on the 15th floor. We stayed in Room 2215....have a look at the pictures. The Executive Lounge has a view of the sea and an inside; as well as, outside area to sit at. It is so nice to have breakfast up there in the mornings and drinks and apps in the evening before heading out to a restaurant for dinner. There is a cold breakfast (shame on Hilton for not having any hot food selections at all---some scrambled eggs would suffice) there in the morning, finger foods in the eary evening, and free beer, wine, and liquor all day long. There is a nice gym in the hotel and a really nice outdoor pool and pool bar should you choose to lounge for a bit. There is a beach about a 5 walk from the hotel which is very nice if you want to lay out or take a walk on. As far as restaurants go in Barcelona, we found the best restaurants to be in the Eixample area. Our most favorite tapas restaurant...we ate there twice...was Catalana. It is a fun, trendy restaurant with really good (and strong) Sangria, great tapas, and great prices. You will most likely have to wait when you go for dinner, but it is totally worth it. We did go to the Olympic Port restaurant area on the beach for drinks and possibly dinner, but ended up skipping it because the restaurants were kind of pricey and not too crowded. The restaurants there like Bestial and Shoko are very trendy and turn into dance clubs at night. I would think that if you went there later at night, say around 11pm, that it would be very crowded and full of people. So bottom line, my recommendation is to stay at this hotel and pay for an executive room floor with a sea view. If you cannot afford an executive room, than I do really like this hotel and would stay here again due to the fact the hotel has very nice and spacious hotel rooms that you would expect from a Hilton. Hint: There is an amazing hot and cold breakfast buffet in the restaurant downstairs should you choose that over the lousy cold breakfast in the executive lounge.",5,2011,10,14
36,Close to the beach & easy transportation,"Very helpful staff...they give everyone individual attention, which frustrates some who don't like to wait, but worth it! Can walk to the beach a couple blocks away, or easily scoot to the sites via the subway or other public tranportation. Large mall is directly across the street with good shopping and food options after a long day of sightseeing. Since we were there in early September when it's still quite warm, we also found the pool area a great way to enjoy a midday break. Only real complaint was the charge for the wi-fi access (12 Euros for 60 minutes, 25 Euros for 24 hours). This was by far the highest priced internet access we experienced on our trip, including Italy and France.",4,2011,10,14
36,Perfect pre cruise stay,"We stayed here for 2 nights prior to our cruise as part of the cruise package. We wondered whether it would be a little too far out of the city, but it was fine, the hop on hop off bus stops just across the street and there is a handy metro stop nearby. We had a room on the 10th floor overlooking the pool and with a sea view. From what we could see from the lift lobby, the city views are spectacular also. Room was as you would expect for a 5 star,very comfortable bed, large bathroom with deep bath and powerful shower. Breakfast was buffet style and plenty of choice. We did not eat dinner in the hotel,rather expensive, but there are restaurants in the mall across the road. Also a supermarket which was handy for wine, water etc.
Overall a very pleasant stay in a lovely city.",4,2011,10,13
36,Fantastic Stay!,"Lovely, luxurious hotel. Clean rooms, includes Crabtree and Evelyn toiletries, A/C, good pillows, TV with many English channels, fairly quiet and good location. Service is excellent, staff work very hard to make your stay pleasant. The restaurant has outstanding food but on the expensive side. Try the sea bream! Would stay here again.",5,2011,10,09
36,This hotel was awesome!,My husband are staying at this hotel for the weekend before we go on our cruise!  We love the hotel.  It is right next to the largest mall in Barcelona and it is also close to a stop on the Barcelona Bus Turistic tour which is a must as well. The room is decorated very nice with a modern style bathroom.  The buffet breakfast is great and they have many choices for you to eat. You will not leave hungry. The staff is very friendly and helpful when we had a question or needed something for our room. The city and sea views are spectucular from the hotel.  It is not too far from the city center and you can get there by taxi for about 11 Euros. We rare so glad we picked this hotel.,5,2011,10,08
36,What a lovely birthday trip,"After I had booked this hotel through one of the Last Minute.Com secret hotels I immediately searched for reviews.  I found a few not very complimentary so I was a little apprehensive about going there.  I need not have worried the hotel was wonderful.  The rooms were perfect, large comfortable bed, everything you need in there including tea and coffee making faciliies (which after a long day walking about the city was very much appreciated).  We did not eat or drink in the hotel so cannot comment on cost of meals or drinks but any hotel will be expensive when it is 5*, we have been in good hotels all over the world and not found a 5* cheap!  It was just across the road from a shopping centre which was convenient if you forgot to take something.  Although a little way out of the city centre there is a stop for the hop on-hop off buses nearby, also a public transport bus stop and the metro is within easy walking distance. I much prefer a good hotel a little way out than a poor hotel in the city centre.  All in all it was a lovely birthday trip.  The hotel was well up to standard and I would definitely visit there again - especially at the price we got it for as a Last Minute.com secret hotel.  Thank you HIlton Diagonal Mar.",5,2011,10,08
36,Good value for the basics,"Overall this is a great hotel, very spacious, friendly staff and nice and modern.
It is not central but only €10 taxi from town so not a big deal.  Across the road is a mall and  square with several restaruants offering open air eating (Tapas far right is nice).  Inside the hotel the rooms are standard affair modern hilton, the hotel is 1 block away from the beach.

This is a business hotel rather than a tourist one.  They do have a pool which is rarely used.  They have parking underground at a cost.   Unless you are hiltonhhonors gold you will need to pay for wifi.  It is very expensive so if you need that cater €20 or so into the daily costs.  

bar is nice, table service, decent choice.  not cheap but it is a hotel bar ;)  Never eaten lunch/dinner there but do eat their breakfasts which are very good.

I think it is very well priced.   Free wi-fi & a slightly cheaper bar would have given it a 5th star from me.  Irrespective of this I do choose to go back.",4,2011,10,05
36,Consider myself a regular guest,"We stayed for a week in August as we have done the last 6 years. The weather was like it usually is this time of year, sunny in the afternoon after some clouds in the morning. Perfect for a little shopping or sight seeing until lunchtime. After lunchbrake and a glass of wine, it was time to relax on a sunbed by the pool. They had a new childrens pool this year, but with teenagers only we kept a little distance to read our books in peace and quietness.

Still love the members of staff doing everything to serve us and make our stay the best ever.

We will return.",5,2011,10,04
36,Nice Hotel - expensive wifi!,"The hotel is fine. Our room was nice and met my expectations of a Hilton. We got a great deal on Tripadvise and knew we'd be far from the city centre but this was a stopover for us before a flight home so were fine with that as we've been to Barcelona before. The convenience of the large shopping mall across the street was great as you could find everything you could possibly need or want. There are a number of small cafeterias, bars and restaurants nearby. Only complaint was the price of various amenities - the mini bar costs were ridiculously high (€5.50 for a can of coke) and because the mini bar is one of those automatic charge ones, you couldn't store drinks in there to keep them cold (there are convenient ice machines near the elevator though). The €27/day charge for wifi is ridiculous but there is a MacDonalds across the street in the mall that has free, unlimited wifi so we went there and had a drink while surfing the net instead of paying the fee for it in the hotel. They also have a transfer service to the airport that costs €60 (not sure if that was per person or not), a taxi is under €40 and convenient. 
I probably wouldn't stay here again but only because there was nothing to make it stand out ahead of any other hotels in Barcelona but it was fine for what we were looking for.",4,2011,10,03
36,Disappointing Hilton at Sunny Barcelona,"I guess I've been spoilt in Asia. Hotel staff in Asia are generally very courteous, proactive, helpful and always with a smile. Hilton Diagonal Mar staff often look busy, not smiley but will do the task if you ask them. We stay at the club floor where the club lounge has no free wifi (shocking), there's no turn down service each night. Club lounge is packed at most times with loud Americans - 3 nights in a row (different groups) want the whole world to know their life story. 

Great location if you love outdoors and shopping. Jog at the beach which goes a long way. 
Opposite the hotel is a shopping mall. 

To come back here again? Maybe not. Will choose somewhere closer to the city next time!",3,2011,10,02
36,Great experience,"We stayed at this hotel to sightsee after finishing a cruise.  Although it is not in the typical tourist area, we found it very convenient.  It is two blocks from the subway and 1 block to the stops for the hop on-hop off tours.   We were able to purchase discount packages to one of these tours at the hotel which did save us money.  It is across from a nice mall with a great grocery, handy for water & snacks.   Our room was gorgeous with beautiful city views (the water views on the other side are amazing).  The executive floor was well worth it as they had newspapers, delicious breakfasts, and and tapas and drinks overlooking the Mediterranean sea.  Staff was helpful with directions and advice.  We loved this property!",5,2011,10,02
36,Very Smart Hotel,"we stayed at the Hilton Diagonal Mar for 3 days prior to our cruise.  The location ofthe hotel is about 2 miles from the city centre, but easy access via the bus or metro, we chose to use the merto which gave us great access around the city to the various locations we planned to visit.  The hotel staff were very friendly and pleasant.  The hotel was just what you would expect from the Hilton, very clean and smart.  As the hotel was away from the hussle of the tourist areas, it was used by many people on business.  There is a nice shopping mall just across the road with some good restaurants.  (A taxi from the hotel to the port was about 18 euro)",5,2011,10,02
36,Not typical Barcelona,"Stayed at the hotel for a few days attending a conference. Modern hotel, nice rooms, steps from the beach but away from the regular tourist attractions. Great view and breakfast at the executive floor. Avoid the bar - a glass of beer EUR 10 (most expensive glass of beer I recall ever having), campari and soda EUR 13.",4,2011,10,01
36,Quietly Away From The Tourist Areas,"My husband I and stayed here at the conclusion of a cruise.  We wanted a couple of days to regroup and to see Barcelona before heading home.  Diagonal Mar is in a very quiet area of Barcelona, and tends to be more of a ""business"" hotel as there are many high rise office buildings and a convention center nearby.  As luck would have it, there were no conventions going on at the time we were there so the hotel wasn't very crowded.  In addition to the convenient metro, there is an ""on-off"" bus stop a block away which made it convenient to do a city tour.  Our room was a mini-suite on the executive floor (level 22) and had beautiful views of the ocean.  It was clean and very comfortable.  My only complaint was that Hilton asked us twice if we wanted any extras with our room.  We requested foam pillows and never got them.  Service in the executive lounge was rather spotty.  We planned to use the lounge for a drink before dinner.  Some evenings the liquor was put out at 5PM, sometimes not till after 7PM.  The ice bucket on the counter was empty and I had to ask the hostess twice to fill it.  The swimming pool, located on the second floor of the hotel, was very nice and there was an abundance of seats available, as well as a very attentive server from the bar.  The shopping mall across the street wasn't very interesting, however, it did have a large selection of restaurants.",4,2011,09,23
36,"Nice hotel, perhaps more business than tourist focussed","Being part of the Hilton empire, I had expected this hotel to cater for the business traveller and those who are able to pay the extra to get access to the executive lounge and rooms on the levels 19-23 but we as a group of 3 at times felt a little like the poor relation.

In a hotel of this quality I would have expected satellite television to be the norm and not just available to those who had paid for higher quality rooms.  Televisons that only provide world service news channels and the national geographic channel in English become a little tiresome very quickly. We had a sea view but as mentioned in other reviews it is restricted by office buildings. Air conditioning was excellent.  The weather was extremely hot, but the rooms were lovely.

Breakfast is a help yourself service and the choice was good.  A word of warning though, between 8.30 and 9 am on busy days they were struggling to keep up with the volume and we had used plates piling up on our table and the buffet was wiped out.  

Barcelona is not a cheap destination so bring plenty of cash with you! There are some nice places to eat in the locality, but the portions arent large, but the cost of them is.

To summarise - nice hotel, put we paid quite a lot (in my opinion) to stay here and would expect just a little more to be provided for what we paid.",4,2011,09,18
36,"Lovely hotel, but not the best location for tourist adventures","The hotel is lovely, bright rooms and the pool area is fantastic. Across the road is a big shopping centre with plenty of places to eat and entertain yourselves. The metro is about a 5 to 10 min walk away and the line goes right into town. I can see that this hotel would be perfect for business travellers close to the convention centre, but not the best base for tourists wanting to be in the centre of town. We booked this as a mystery deal on Expedia with the the area being central Barcelona which I wouldn't exactly agree with. The parking was also for corporate rates at 32 euros per day I believe. There were limited free parking options close to 10mins walking distance away.",4,2011,09,18
36,Great modern hotel near beaches of Barcelona,"We just returned from a 4 night stay (mother and adult daughter) and really enjoyed our stay here. The hotel is located within about a 5 minutes walk to the beach and directly across the street from a major shopping mall. We chose a water view room and were assigned to the 23rd floor. The room was nice, not sure the water view was the best choice however, as the beach was a few blocks away and the view was mainly the backs of other high rises. I would recommend the city view, as we noticed the pretty city views from the elevator areas and realized we might have made a mistake in our choice. Not a problem though, as we were gone most of the day exploring beautiful Barcelona! A couple of evenings however we also had the pleasure of relaxing on the beach sea side-so while the hotel may not be in the center of the city, it's location to the water was an advantage from our perspective. The room was extremely comfortable and clean. Wooden floors, white linens, comfortable mattress. We also had wireless internet access-which we were assigned log ins at check in-my recollection is that this was complimentary due to my Hilton Diamond status. We also gained access to the executive lounge on the 15th floor-which was very helpful, as we were able to eat a light breakfast (cereals, pastries, fruit, cheese, etc) each morning for free. We really appreciated this after we got to Madrid and didn't have this perk a few days later. The room is also open for light food in the early evening and for drinks and light snacks until closing. We went every evening for snacks, sodas, and wine to plan our day and mingle with the other guests. It was really nice. The room also has a balcony with tables and great views of the city and/or ocean. The front desk was very accomodating to our needs. My daughter exchanged some american dollars there w/no problems. We explored Barcelona from the nearby metro, walk right from the hotel, left at the end of the block at the traffic light, and a few steps beyond. Or you can walk through the mall to the other side of the street and save a few steps-a walk but very convenient. We left to go the train station before day light and felt very safe walking to the metro at 6:30 am. I appreciated the 4 award nights and always know that Hilton will provide good comfortable accomodations-I seldom use my award nights anywhere but Europe because the dollar/euro comparison really gives you more value for your points. I would definitely enjoy stayin ghere again and would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting beautiful Barcelona!",5,2011,09,17
36,"Beautiful hotel, great stay","I booked a quick weekend trip to Barcelona and chose the Hilton Diagonal Mar based on the website photos, which did not disappoint.  I received an upgrade to the Executive Floor, which was nicely appointed and offered private registration and checkout.  The daily refreshment presentations were well done, with a good selection but not too heavy.
The guestrooms were well laid out and modern, with wooden floors and gorgeous views of the ocean.  The bathroom was nicely done and the lighting possibly a bit too bright.  Room service, front desk and housekeeping were all efficient and prompt.
My only complaint?  The elevators seemed very slow, even with four units. Also, the ice machine offered styrofoam buckets to take ice to your room - a bit cheap and out of place, and not an environmentally friendly option.",4,2011,09,14
36,Best hotel overall I've ever stayed in.,We arrived at the hotel exhausted from travel and minus my daughters luggage ...we were given a beautiful room and the front desk manager personally made it her mission to find the luggage.  She dealt with the airlines and we had our bag the next day.  The service throughout the hotel was outstanding.   Bravo Hilton!,5,2011,09,12
36,Excellent Choice for Barcelona,"We stayed here for 2 nights prior to a cruise out of Barcelona. It is outside of the city but is near the Beach and a modern shopping mall across the street. Above and beyond public transport that is near the hotel, in the summer the open top hop-on-hop-off tourist bus that is popular in most cities has a stop nearby, so access to the city is easy. Its a modern, clean hotel and we got, connecting rooms with a view of the ocean at a great rate with a real breakfast. For a European hotel given the prices and room sizes that you often see, we could not have asked for more. Staff was great too, one of whom gave us a great tip for dinner at a small local restaurant.",4,2011,09,12
36,Average Hilton,"My husband and I stayed here on the 2nd leg of our honeymoon/vacation to Spain. The reception at check-in was lukewarm. The room was ok. There was mold on the shower head and water damage in the bathroom. The back on the remote control was broke and was taped on with dirty tape. I cleaned it with a handy-wipe and wrapped a hair band around it to keep the back on. We had loud neighbors and could hear all of their conversations when they came back from a late night of partying. The upside of the hotel was the location, directly across from a mall. The downside to the location is it is far away from all of the attractions from Barcelona. I would probably look for another hotel if I ever return to Barcelona.",3,2011,09,12
36,Loved our stay and would highly recommend!,"This hotel has all the amenities- an Executive Lounge with beautiful views and staffed very well, which was great for us.  (It is open all day and evenings till 11 pm) There's also a very open and large pool area and bar, and the beautiful sea  is about a 10 minute walk away.  The rooms were very clean and comfortable.  The staff at the hotel was always helpful and courteous.  Although it is located outside the city center, it is such an easy busride to get there.  Bus # 41 is right across the street, and is an easy and inexpensive way to get the the main Square at Catalunya.  It is easier than going to the Metro, which is a 10-15 minute walk from the hotel.  Overall, I would say this Hilton is one of the nicer Hilton properties we have been to in Europe and offers its Diamond Members a wide array of upgrades. I look forward to reurning again soon.",5,2011,09,11
36,Excellent hotel with friendly staff,"We loved everything about the is hotel, we were using Hilton points and were upgraded to an executive room with free Internet and use of the executive club facitities so cannot comment on what it would be like to stay without these benefits but we thought it was wonderful. We have stayed in other Hiltons and this one compared very well. I have read that other people thought the staff unfriendly,everybody we dealt with was very friendly and coudn't have been more helpful, one of the receptionists offered to take my postcards over to the post office for me. The beds are the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in, I normally look forward to going home to my own bed after a holiday but not after staying in a Hilton bed. We found the food at breakfast was just fine you donget told that they are closing at 10.30 sharp but that is fair enough if not people would be coming in alll morning. The location will not suit people who want to be in the centre of the action but is is nice to come back and be away from the hustle and bustle of the city centre,the transport links are very good and we found the metro was ideal to get to most places, the trains are very punctual, have air conditioning and you can use your phone,they certainly put the London underground to shame. We never felt unsafe and used them even late at night. The tourist bus routes are great and the green route runs past the hotel with a  stop just down the road.we would come back without tomorrow if we could.",5,2011,09,11
36,Loved it,"great hotel - way above par for European hotels. Clean, beautiful furnishings, comfortable bed. Pool area was great. Only criticism was that at breakfast on the weekend there were lots of uncleared tables and lots of people waiting, but it was very busy with cruise guests. 

Would certainly go back - best hotel I've staying in in Europe.",5,2011,09,11
36,Perfect service,"Nice hotel, big rooms vieuw on the beach and with a good swimming pool. Great executive lounge area and overall services.",5,2011,09,10
36,Great hotel in good location,Tthis is a good hotel for a short stay in Barcelona. Metro station 10 minutes walk from hotel with city centre 20 minutes away. Hotel has excellant facilities. Rooms are spacious and clean. Great breakfast. Would stay there again.,4,2011,09,09
36,"Very Nice Hotel, Excellent staff",It was the first stay on our European trip and it was the perfect start. Javier took care of our reservation and Oscar helped us in with a very smooth check-in. Got a room on the 20th Floor with access to Executive Lounge. The view was fantastic and the room was very good. Super quiet with all that is expected of a Hilton property.,5,2011,09,05
36,Add on costs were prohibitive,"The hotel's physical plant and service deserve a very good rating although the property is somewhat without charm and is not located for tourism.  However, the ""extras"" and hotel charges were so obscene that a ""poor"" rating was obligatory.  Internet is EUR 27 per DAY ($38.50).  A local draft beer in the lobby bar is EUR 9.50 ($13.50).  Small water from the minibar is EUR4.10 ($5.84).  I was charged over EUR 19 ($27) to send a THREE page fax to California.  Any computer access in the business center involved paying not only for time on the PC's but also per page printed.  A typical ""open a five page doc, print it, ask for a scan"" was in the region of EUR 20 ($28.50).  To be fair the staff were embarrassed and sheepishly asked me to ""take it up with management as it is indeed too expensive.""",2,2011,09,03
36,Hilton was better than I expected,"We are gold members but reading the mixed reviews made me apprehensive about staying because of what was said about service and location (regardless of membership).  
Background:  US Airways lost our luggage for 2 1/2 days.  
Good points:  Upgrade to  2 executive suites (sea views).  The executive lounge staff was excellent and very accommodating.  The reception staff gave us some useful information to recover our luggage and sometimes called on our behalf to inquire about our luggage.  One drawback:  we tried to ask for supplies at the reception but was referred to housekeeping (who was not answering phones).
We also got our wi-fi free for 3 days.
Not so Good :  On arrival (after losing luggage) a ""not so pleasant"" staff member came over and told us we could not park in front of the hotel.  My husband who speaks perfect Spanish told him we are checking at the hotel and if he could direct us to where to park we'll be happy to comply, but  he kept rudely telling us he doesn't know but ""not where we are parked"" and this kept going on and on for a while.  I did not see that staff member again so I was unable to get his name.
The place is far from the main city but the hop-on/hop off bus solved that for us.  The beach is walking distance and the mall is close.  
Tip:  You pay parking when you remove your car from the lot (you have to pre-pay before you can get out), not the actual days you stay in the lot.
Over all not a bad stay.",4,2011,09,03
36,"Superb, relaxing",My hotel stay was very relaxing. The pool deck was very relaxing and the breakfast very good (although very busy in Saturday whilst the Disney cruise passengers where staying the night before boarding).,5,2011,08,31
36,Very nice and well appointed Hotel !,We visited the Hilton Diagonal on a short week-end break from 25-28 August. On arrival we were greeted by friendly staff and shown to our room . This was on the 8th floor and had a partial view of the sea andbeach which was some 300 mtrs away. Inside the beds were very comfy ( twins ) and the main area was of reasonable size. Bathroom was a decent size and contained bath and seperate shower with good quality products to boot ( Crabtree & Evelyn ). It also has a pool and bar on the 2nd floor which were fine and we were looked after by excellent attentive staff. The other bonuses of the Diagonal were that the tour bus stopped right outside the hotel which took one to the city centre and a metro was also close. Opposite were a large number of reasonably priced restaurants and a huge shopping mall for the ladies ! All in all we had a very good experience staying here and would certainly go back.,4,2011,08,31
36,Absolutely perfect in every way,"Some of the comments regarding this hotel really surprise me, I stay with the Hilton brand on a regular basis and this hotel was absolutely perfect in every way. On arrival at the hotel we had been upgraded to a larger room due to it being my partner's birthday whilst we were away, the room was on the sixteenth floor and absolutely blew us away with one of the most stunning views I have ever had the pleasure to see.

The view looked out over all of Barcelona and I mean all of the city with no obstructions you had a perfect view of the city from every angle possible, whilst we also had a view of the beach and coastline.

The room itsself was to a very high standard with a fantastic bed in both size and comfort, a well sized corridor and plenty of storage room with a clean and well presented bathroom containing both bath and seperate shower. 

Whilst on the day of my partner's birthday a complimentary bottle of champagne and birthday cake was delivered to our room by cheerful room service staff. This little touch really helped to make her birthday a day to remember.

The rest of the hotel was of typical hilton fair, we had breakfast every morning which was well presented and of high quality with plenty of attentive staff although do be warned obviously a hotel of this size is often busy but we didn't encounter any issues.

We also dined at the restaurant on our second night and received excellent service and wonderful mediterranean quisine, of course the prices are high but what do you expect this is a Hilton and the prices are standard across this and many similar hotels to this quality.

We spent a few days sat around the pool top bar enjoying the views of the city alongside the undoubted comfortable surroundings. 

In terms of the area the Hilton Diaganol is loacated outside of the city centre but with easy transport connections such as the new tram system and the metro within walking distance whilst taxi's are cheap and plentiful. Although it is out of the city centre the views that are available from the hotel and the location next Barcelona's beaches make this a good choice if you're looking for a break out of the city centre but with it still in easy reach.

All of the staff we encountered were polite, friendly and approachable some of the previous comments regarding this hotel certainly don't match with the experience we encountered. This was a perfect stay in a high quality hotel and I wouldn't hesitate to come back and am indeed planning to in the near future.

Comments regarding the attitude of staff are false in my opinion, every staff member spoke numerous languagaes perfectly including catalan, spanish, english, german. Far better than I speak any of those language and I think its important a previous poster remembers that they are in Spain, not England. 

A wonderful stay and I can't wait to return.",5,2011,08,30
36,Good hotel,"I stayed at the Hilton for two nights in Aug. 2011 for vacation. It's a modern and very nice hotel. As a Hilton Gold member I was upgraded to an Executive floor. The room was very nice and quiet and had a nice view. The pool is large and very nice. 

Only two negatives to the hotel. The service was mixed; some staff were friendly and helpful and some were neither. For instance, one of the staff in the Executive Lounge was informing me of times for a train to a certain location, but she failed to tell me that I could pick up the train at a station closer than the station of origination. I ended up missing my train and having to change my plans. 

The other negative is the hotel is a bit of a distance from the center of things, requiring taking the metro or expensive taxis to get to the center of town or to other touristy sites. But to stay more centrally located would cost more and might be less quiet, so it's a tradeoff.

Overall, the positives outweigh the negatives and the rate I got was good so I recommend the hotel.",4,2011,08,29
36,Not up to satndard for Hilton,"On our arrival, there was no staff to help with our luggage, the websites boats multilingual staff but the boy on reception  had to refer us to his colleague. The rooms are clean and nice. The staff aren't friendly and only seem to work when they have to. Food and drink prices are extremely high, the Hilton obviously want to encourage people to eat elsewhere. Good location shopping centre just across the road beach a five minute walk.  I would stay there again, but the service and atmosphere is not what you'd expect from the Hilton. More a Travelodge with a pool.",3,2011,08,29
36,Nice hotel,"We stayed here for one night upon return from Malaga.
Hotel is located about 2blocks from the beach about 5 minute walk. There is a shooping mall across the road with some resturants. 
The hotel has roof top pool with lounge chairs, bar/grill; gym (did not use).
Metro is close by. 
The hotel staff were freindly and helpful. Breakfast was a variey of food from cold cereal to bacon and eggs.
Rooms a large and very clean. 
Internet servces for a fee(did not use)
The only dissapointment I had with the hotel is they do not offer transportation to and from the airport. Any other Hilton I have stayed they have a had a stuttle bus to get you to the airport.
Overall I would stay here again.",4,2011,08,28
36,"Nice hotel,no free wireless anywhere inhotel","Would give better review except for 22. Euros wireless and37euros parking

Starbucks basically on premises so you can buy coffee and do wireless there. When r thet going to realize they lose money being so greedy? 
Room clean,nice. Hotel staff great",5,2011,08,27
36,Hope we will be back!!!!!!!,"ask for upper floor , executive if you can , the view is breathtaken!",5,2011,08,22
36,Good Family Hotel,"We had been to Barcelona before. We wanted to take our kids someplace that they would enjoy (beach, pool) and we could enjoy (great architecture and art).  We used points (there was a miscommunication between the hotel and Hilton, which customer service in the US was able to fix with our room, which the hotel and customer service Hilton Spain could not--and would have charged us for the kids. The customer service in the US was great.)  The hotel is great for kids.  There are two pools --  a big one and a kids pool that was perfect for our two year old.  There are a ton of lounge chairs by the pool (and away from the pool if you want it quieter) and a chess board on the ground. There is also a massage area and bar/snack bar area that we didn't use.  The gym is great. There are three treadmills, three bikes, and three cross training machines.  There is a tv in the room and lots of weight machines and free weights.  The beach is only two blocks away--so easy.  There is a playground right there (which we didn't use).  Across the street is a shopping mall...not the best stores but it has a grocery store, Starbucks, and some kid games out front. The rooms are very nice -- there are some English language tv stations.  One point is that the hotel is not in the middle of things. But, the metro is very close (3 blocks away) and super easy. You can take the yellow line almost anywhere. We transferred a couple of times but generally it took us everywhere we wanted to go.  You can actually go to the Sagrada Familia by not going through the downtown (going to the other end of the yellow line and transferring). We didn't take the ride on and off bus but met people that took and liked it.  We went to the breakfast once -- it was very big and had tons of food.  We used points and it was easy to stay there.  If you want to be in the middle of things and have a pool -- you certainly can do that. But it is a good family hotel and not too difficult to get to the sites with the great metro (not worth taking a cab).  It's a big city and you just have to decide what you want to get out of your trip such as the sites, beach, etc.",4,2011,08,21
36,Good location for City/Beach holiday,"If you are looking to combine city tours of Barcelona with some beach and sea then this hotel is well located - one block from the beach, two blocks away from the metro.  Although I have to say the beach nearest this hotel is not the greatest as it has a huge parking lot and gets rather crowded - Bogatell a 20 min walk along the promenade is nicer.

Across the street is a shopping center which is not very fancy but very practical with nice stores and has a huge food court on the top level. It is also Air Conditioned so remember that when you are sweltering is the packed down town shopping area of La Rambla!

Unfortunately the down side of the location of this Hilton is that it is right next to the Forum center which can have loud music.  Like other posts here I too was disturbed in my room by loud music at night coming from outside. And I could hear the telephone conversation through the walls of the neighboring guest, so be careful if you are making a private call!!

Don't forget to visit the pool and out side terrace - spacious, very relaxing with a good grill menu. It was one of the main reasons I picked this hotel as many Barcelona city hotel have little or no outside seating area and I was very pleased -  The photos on the web site of this hotel are very accurate to what you will find - they are not photo shopped.  The sea views are some what obstructed by neighboring buildings but the city views are equally as nice especially at night. 

Food, service, well equipped room, cleanliness (and price) well all up to scratch for a 4* hotel although I personally could not find the concierge desk which was advertised on the website and I don't like to bother other staff with 'tourist' questions but they were always polite with the answer.  Additionally the cooked food at the breakfast was not to my taste and always cold but plenty of other variety of fresh fruit, breads, cheese and so on. 

All in all you won't be dissapointed.",4,2011,08,20
36,peaceful,"We booked this hotel at the end of a cruise and it was just what we needed after a hectic european crusie. Even though this hotel is very big you didnt hear any noise. It was peaceful and relaxing.  I simply loved it.  My family was very pleased.  There was a shopping mall right across the street.  
We took the bus to Las ramblas with ease. It about fifteen min away by bus. The hotel was clean and comfy,  The front desk personell was very helpful and accommidating. i would stay there again.",5,2011,08,18
36,Absolutely great hotel.,"One of the best hotels I've ever stayed in. Far away from the hustle and buster of the touristy attractions but close enough to hop on the train, tram or bus",5,2011,08,16
36,Good location for quiet weekend stay.,"Stayed here at the end of holiday in north of Spain. Stayed for 4 nights. Hotel located at 'other' side of shopping centre from metro. It's on the sightseeing bus route. Thought the food was over priced so ate in the many restaurants in the shopping centre. Hotel was lovely and clean, stayed in the 16th floor - great night time views. ",4,2011,08,15
36,Save up to stay at the Arts!  Hilton not up to standard.,"Stayed here on a medical business trip in the Spring - the meeting was also held there.
Not a great start when I arrived fairly late - 23.30 (maybe not so late by Barcelona standards!), and only two receptionists were to be found.  Stood in a 'queue' of three in front of one of the girls - sadly, when my turn came, she 'shut up shop' and wandered off without saying a word. I duly joined the other queue - by then necessitating a 15 minute wait to check in - and expressed my displeasure.  No apology forthcoming - girl seemed largely oblivious to the nature of the problem (not a language issue - I speak Spanish and
 she English).
Went up to my room subsequently - a hot shower would have been just the ticket.  Sadly, no proper hot water on offer.  Very sophisticated and trendy-looking 'mixer' tap - only problem being that it produced a dribble (at best) of luke warm water.  Complained to management obviously, but el fontanero seemed to be de  vacaciones unfortunately - so nothing was done to fix the problem over the next two days.  Room otherwise not bad - but so it should be for the price.
Things not much better on the 'corporate/business' front either:  restaurant could not cope with the predictable 08.30 influx of 200 hungry euro-doctors next day - nowhere to sit and three requests needed to procure any coffee.  IT did not work properly in the meeting either!
All in all  una excursión catastrófica.  
Hilton really do need to up their game in Europe - not my first bad experience.",2,2011,08,11
36,Would Not Return,"The hotel was nice, but the service was not good. The people behind the desk were not friendly at all. We called down to the desk the night before to ask for a car that would fit 5 people to take us to the airport the next morning.  We noticed that taxis only fit 4. When we checked the next morning, the arrangements had not been made. We asked again if they would call and make the arrangements for 8am. When we came back down to the lobby we asked where we should wait and the woman behind the desk snapped at us that it was not 8 am yet. After about 15 minutes a man came to tell us that there was only one car that would fit 5 people and that it would be least 20 minutes later than we wanted. At this point it was already 8am and he asked if we still wanted it. This did not make our experience very good. I have never been to a Hilton that could not handle transportation requests. If we had not checked, we would have been late for our flight. This hotel is not really close to anything except a shopping center. I would stay closer to town the next time I visit Barcelona.",3,2011,08,08
36,Nice hotel!,"My family stayed at the Hilton Diagonal Mar for two nights in July prior to our cruise on the Disney Magic.  When we arrived at the hotel around 10:00 A. M., the front desk clerk told me that they could not accommodate our family of three in one room, so they were offering us two rooms (at no additional charge) instead.  Another wonderful surprise is that the rooms were ready!  Since we'd just flown in on a red-eye flight, we were grateful that we could freshen up in our rooms immediately.

The hotel is not in the center of the activity in Barcelona, and that was fine with us.  We liked the location, and we took the hop-on, hop-off tourist bus (which has a stop across the street) to access much of the city.  The shopping center across from the hotel is nothing particularly special, but it is a convenient place to eat dinner or to pick up last-minute necessities.

My one complaint with the hotel is the excessive charge for Internet access.  I did not use my computer while we were there, simply because I refused to pay for what I considered exorbitant rates.  I am a big believer that major hotels should offer free wifi.

The hotel is clean, and the staff were friendly and helpful. The daily breakfast was one of the most amazing buffets I've ever seen!  We're still talking about how good it was (especially the fresh-squeezed orange juice). I would recommend the Hilton Diagonal Mar.",4,2011,08,05
36,"loved it, hope to return","Our room overlooked the sea, and was extremely comfortable. The breakfast is one of the best we have ever had, from the fabulous fresh orange juice to top notch ham and bacon to excellent baked goods. It's outside the tourist center, the better for sleeping! The metro is a quarter-mile walk at most, and got us everywhere fast. A bus to Plaza Catalan is right outside the hotel's front door, but slower than the metro. Our stay was during Holy Week, so there were no business conventions going on and we got a great deal on a rate including breakfast.",5,2011,08,04
36,Ok location but poorly managed and not up to Hilton or Barcelona level.,This Hilton is located close to Diagonal Mar shopping center and beach which is nice. However the hotel is not managed as well as you would expect from Hilton. When we checked in our minibar was half empty and the room was dirty. The room was also missing all info on available services. On few occasions we received faulty number of towels and needed to ask for more (the old ones were taken away but new ones were missing). The staff did try to help but there was always too few on duty and too many customers... so we waited and waited...  and NEVER-EVER take the twin beds: They move more than your average car and they are noisy and very bad even for sleeping.,2,2011,08,03
36,If it wasn't for a change to a quiet room...,"We stayed a total of three nights at this hotel in June.   After almost 24 hours of travel we just wanted a light meal and sleep.   Check in (as well as check out) was quick and efficient, and our bags were delivered immediately by the bellman.  No wait for the elevators as others have said in their reviews.

Other members of our party had arrived earlier and had lunch at the hotel and while good, was very expensive.  We ate dinner at one of the tapas restaurants across from the hotel, ok food and it was expensive.  

Service in the executive lounge was great.  Plenty of room to sit inside or out.  Just wish they offered free Wi-Fi.

About 3am our first night we woke up to loud music.   We just wanted sleep after a full day of travel and didn't get it.  We figured it was a party for one of the corporate events in the hotel.   

The next morning we took a quick cab ride to Las Ramblas and enjoyed shopping and catching the Hop On and Off Bus for a tour of the city.  We had some great meals while there.   

Tired again from lack of sleep the prior two nights and again….woke up to loud music.   About 4am (actually the clocks were off in our room) called the front desk.  Apparently the music was coming from beach parties that started around 1am and generally end around 5am.   The hotel has no control over the parties or the music, just happened to occur during our stay.   

We discovered that the buffet breakfast was part of our room deal the second day of our stay (check in person forgot to mention it to us).  The breakfast buffet area was packed, understaffed, coffee service was slow, basically no one clearing the tables in a timely manner.

After talking with a supervisor about not being able to sleep due to the music/noise, we received an upgrade to a beautiful room high up with gorgeous views for our last night’s stay.  Very quiet and we got a good amount of sleep, thank you so much to the customer service manager.  Realizing noise issue was not the fault of the hotel, they really went out of their way to make our last night stay very enjoyable.",4,2011,08,03
36,Most luxurious stay ever.,"Everything about the hotel, especially  the staff were amazing. I only wish I could afford to stay in an executive room every time I travelled. The lounge with all its perks was such a treat. You are very close to a pleasant beach and beside a fabulous shopping centre. The city is very easily accessible via taxi, bus or tourist bus and it is indeed a city worth visiting.",5,2011,08,03
36,Great family accomdations in Barcelona,"We had a morning arrival in Barcelona. The cab to the hotel cost 30 euros. The hotel is along the coast, away from the city center. We arrived very jet lagged and the Hilton was very accommodating and let us have the room at 10AM. The room was very nice. 110V current adapters we available for free from the desk . There was limited TV in English. The lobby bar was bland. The breakfast buffet is excellent. The pool area was nice but the pool is not heated. There is topless nudity at the pool. The beach is a 200 yard walk from the hotel and very nice. There is a new but unremarkable shopping mall across the street. It is easy to catch bus 41 into the city center from in front of the hotel. The hotel has offers on transportation but it is no deal. We bought Barcelona cards prior to arrival and they worked perfectly. Dining in the hotel is very expensive. We ran across the street to the mall to the Acampo store and bought Spanish wine and beer for one third of the cost in the hotel. The front desk speaks English and is very helpful.",5,2011,08,01
36,Modern Hotel with great service and location,"My wife and I stayed there for 2 nights before we took a cruise.  It was the perfect location for us because it was close to the ports and close enough to the city,  The hotel is a 5 minute walk to the bus and metro stop that can take you anywhere in the city.  Its a super modern hotel, with a big room, fancy bathroom, great pool area, workout facilities and great service.

When we arrived check in was super quick, it was wife's birthday and the bar sang her happy birthday and gave her a candle to blow out, they were great!  The only thing they need to improve was checkout, I had to wait in 30 minute line to check out, come on guys everyone else does this automatically for you.  Also they charge 28 Euro's per day for wifi, everyone else free.  But besides those two things, the hotel was fantastic!",5,2011,07,31
36,Awesome Week!,"A really nice, beautiful and friendly hotel and staff. 
We stayed there for one week, and had the chance to ""test"" everything.
5 things which had to be announced for its fantastic service are:

- Breakfast & Service Staff (The waitress who our son loved so much)
- Pistaccio Bar & Staff (David - fantastic service)
- Housekeeping
- The Entrance Staff (Ramiro & Russel - AWESOME)
- Reception and its services

There is only one thing that was really disappointing and that was the missing service at the Brisa Pool Bar. Unfortunately I had to come to the bar for my own a couple of times to do my order or pay the bill. 

But too see it in a complete package: Best hotel I have ever been in Barcelona (and I have been in a lot of Hotels there)",5,2011,07,30
36,"Nice place to be on a business trip, when you don't have time to check out the city anyway.","A very good 5-star hotel. The location could have been much better though. It's far away from down town and even though it's near to the seaside, it's not very attractive to take walks there.",4,2011,07,30
36,Great hotel,"I and my wife stayed in this hotel for a week. It was our first trip to Barcelona and we were wondering if the location was to far away from the center but we were happy to have chosen this hotel because it was good to be away from the crowd in the center. The transport in Metro to the center is quick and easy. The hotel is located next to a Diagonal Mall so it is comfortable to go there and shop. Only criticism that I can say about this hotel is that they do not offer free internet I notified this opinion to the hotel manager but it would be nice to have ""hot spot"" in the lobby.",4,2011,07,29
36,Very good!,"I was there in a Business trip. 
There is a big, easy parking under the hotel, the check in was superfast which I really appreciate after a long journey, the rooms are clean as expected, functional, big, with great views of the city (in my case). The Executive Lounge in floor 15 was great, a place to work, relax and have a little snack.
Bed very comfortable.
Overall, a perfect hotel for being on business trips.

The location is superb also.",5,2011,07,29
36,Our new favorite hotel,"The HIlton Diagonal Mar in Barcelona is located a few blocks from the beach and in a modern area of town. A large shopping mall is across the street and the metro stop is two blocks away.  Door-to-door, it was only 40 minutes on two metro trains to meet up with friends who were staying at a hotel near Las Ramblas.   
The hotel is modern and the rooms are large, well decorated, spotlessly clean and large windows for a panoramic view.  We would definitely stay here again.",5,2011,07,28
36,Great Service; well run hotel,"Everything about this hotel is excellent other than it's location.  It is at the far end of Barcelona and to get in to the city center you are spending 25 minutes walking to  and traveling on the Metro or spending 15 - 20 euros on taxis.  The staff is very well trained and helpful in every way.  The rooms are large and spacious and very clean.  The breakfast buffet is Great!!  There is a large pool deck area with a neat bar adjoining the pool.  The hotel is a 10 minute walk to the beach, but the beach is at the far end of Barcelona proper.  If I were to go back to Barcelona, I would stay in a hotel in city center, despite all of the positive things I just wrote about the Hilton.",5,2011,07,24
36,Good Hilton property - Outside of downtown area.,Upside is hotel is along a quite beach area close to metro and trolley stops. (downtown can be noisy). I would describe staff as cold and inflexible. Room was very nice and surrounding area was great; lots of places to eat. Metro into town is only a five or ten minute ride. ,4,2011,07,24
36,mediocre at best,"This hotel is quite a long distance from Barcelona's best dining, shopping, and tourist attractions.  It's several blocks to the nearest Metro stations, as they're on the opposite side of a large shopping mall.  You must change lines to get to most of the city center.  

It's also very heavy on the fanny pack-clad, point-and-yell cruise ship crowd, which makes it seem quite a bit less sophisticated than the pictures of the facility might lead you to believe.

Check-in was chaos, there was no bell service for bags, and the hotel staff is not knowledgeable about the top restaurants in the city.  Also, be sure NOT to book an Executive Floor room in order to gain lounge access.  The lounge is tiny, and it's constantly mobbed with people piling their plates full of free appetizers.  

I stayed here on Hilton points, as I speculate many other guests do, and, even though it was essentially ""free,"" I wish i would have paid out of pocket for a higher-caliber hotel closer to restaurants and attractions.",2,2011,07,24
36,"No soul, Hilton 4 star prices, for a 3 star property, and 5 star staff.","Just back from 4 nights / 5 days in Barcelone - Spain. 
First of all the location was great for us. Situated just 300m from the beach, 300m from the underground system and across the road from a huge shopping center. 
It all depends what you are looking for. 
The area around the hotel isn't quite finished, you can feel that the Spanish down turn has hit the devolpement of the area. But the place is safe and quiet. 
The hotel it self lacks the ""Bling Bling"" of the hilton brand. It seems to be used mainly as a ""Hub"" for cruise ships, who dump bus loads of guests for an over night stay, or request people stay before boarding. This seems to take the soul out of the place. It dosen't have the ""Wow"" factor of many Hilton hotels. 
First tip, if you come by car, don't use the hotel car park, at 26 euros a night, drive on past the hotel, just 300 m first right then right again and you come to the forum car park, 35 euros for 5 days !. The money we saved on the car park we took un upgrade to a relaxing room. Second tip, if you want a relaxing room, don't book it to start off with on the web site, wait until you confirm your booking and they will offer you an upgrade, take it at this point and it will save you 16 euors a night on the standard relaxing room rate. 
The room itself (Relaxing room with see view) was fine, a bit small 31 sq m, and a little worse for ware. The Bose sound system wasn't working and 1 cd was missing. (you should have 2 relaxing cd's tolisten to in the room).the toilet had a small leak and some of the wood has come off the wall. 
The view wasn't of the sea, but three huge office blocks built between the hotel and the sea, you can see the sea on either side, but 75% of the view is officies.As the windows aren't tinted, you have to keep the curtins closed, if not people working can see all that is going on in the room. Not nice. 
As a couple, we wanted a quiet room, being in a relaxing room kept us away from the cruise ship customers (and their kids ) its your best bet.
Breakfast was great, good selection. 
We didn't use the pool, didn't like the fact that the 3 office blocks over look the pool area. And we prefer the beach anyway.
Staff were fantastic everywhere in the hotel.
The fact that the shopping center is just across the road with a very large selection of good food and bars, much cheaper than at the hotel, means that the hotel lounge doesn't have many clients.. and the hotel doesn't do anthing to keep people in the lounge to give the impression there is life in the hotel. 
They could give free wifi for example, this would keep poeple there, instead they chose to charge a staggering 27 euros for 24 hours !!! Stupid prices.. 
Yes we will be back, overall a good experence, and a good place to have a great break.
That said, they do charge Hilton 4 star prices, for what I would say is only a 3 star property, and 5 star staff.",4,2011,07,24
36,love this hotel and love Barcelona!,"checked in quite late on Friday evening, requested a sea room and was given an upgrade to tranquil room with Sea View! Good Start to the weekend :-)
Room very modern, spacious, bathroom again had all the facilites you would expect plus a tv mounted in the wall of the bath?!
Buffett breakfast the next day was swift and efficient, plenty of choices but we did go down to breakfast on the Sunday an hour later and I guess so did most other people because alot of the food had ran out and my husband had to wait for things to be replenished.
Great staff in reception. 
Taxi costs around 10 euros to go to Port Olympic - some great restaurants there.
15 euros or thereabouts gets you to Las Ramblas.
The hotel is opposite a large shopping Mall - I bought some coke zeros for 78cents per bottle and water at 19 cents each and put them in our fridge (there is a space for your own items in the fridge which i think is good)
Decent coffees and lunch can be purchased by the poolside - again staff very attentive and efficient.
This hotel is great and I wouldn't hesitate staying here again.",5,2011,07,23
36,Great Stay,Stayed one pre-cruise night and found it to be very nice. Great location for everything. There is a mall right across the street with some good places to eat and shop. This hotel is close to the pier and you can hop on one of the double deck open top site seeing buses about a block away. You can buy a pass that allows you to get off and on all day. Keep in mind they stop running around 8:00 PM.  Our room was very clean and comfortable.   Very good breakfast buffet. Hotel was very busy but the staff  handled it very well. They took the time to make sure everyone was well taken care of and happy. To sum it up...great place to stay.  Would do it again.,5,2011,07,20
36,Excellent beach hotel,"Everything that has been said about this great hotel is true but  some improvement is needed at Indigo restaurant. 
At breakfast time the restaurant is understaffed. They can barely cope with clearing away table for incomers and there is no one to clear your plate between helpings to the buffet. On one occasion we were even told to seat wherever we wanted but all tables were occupied or not ready. 
The staff also struggles to replenish the buffet which for guests translate to multiple trips to check the offerings  
The food is not hot, especially scrambled eggs and there is no eggs station (cook to order). I believe that it can be ordered from the kitchen but realized this on the last day as no one told me. 
On a more positive note, the pool is gorgeous (23 meters) with a huge terrace for sun loungers. 
Also the room is perfect for sleeping, comfortable beds, silent A/C, sound and light proof. 
Beware of the long lines if you’re checking out on a Sunday 
Bambu restaurant (the closest on the beach ) provides good food and drinks with sunloungers and umbrellas (5 euros each per day or for free after 6pm)",4,2011,07,20
36,Good location and facilities,"Stayed here at the end of our anniversary cruise. Its a modern hotel with all the facilities you would expect from a newish Hilton Hotel. The staff were very helpful.  The reception was crowded with departing cruise people when we arrived so being Diamond members we went to the executive lounge to avoid the long check in queues, you need a card for the lift to get there (15th floor) but a porter helpfully obliged. The lounge was actually closed for cleaning (11-12 every day) but the receptionist appeared and did check us in whilst we had a drink on the patio. Being a diamond member and as it was our silver wedding anniversary we were upgraded to the Presidential Suite which had its own entrance from the corridor. The room had terrific views across the city and down the beach. The bathroom was huge, had a jacuzzi bath, TV on the wall and lots of Crabtree & Evelyn toiletries. The executive lounge was excellent with Champagne available and an outdoor patio with great views. The hotel is a bit out of the centre but getting around is easy, the hop on/off buses stop very close by and there is a large shopping centre and restaurants across the road. It is a short taxi drive to Port Olympic to sample good restaurants and the vibrant nightlife. The main drawbacks were the waits for the lifts which were always busy and the breakfast was disappointing, a more limited choice than i expected of a hotel of this standard and slow service (the room was packed and there were queues for a table), the breakfast was not a patch on the Hilton Barcelona we had stayed in before our cruise. Overall this a very nice hotel and we will stay here again",4,2011,07,19
36,Great hotel - very relaxing,"This is a large hotel located just outside Barcelona center although within easy reach to the city center and the beach. The hotel has great facilities and a very nice pool with pool bar and plenty of seats to relax and enjoy the sun. The room was very spacious and the service in the executive lounge was great. The executive lounge has a balcony with great views over the beach and into the city Centre. The room type was not available as requested when we checked in, we took another room with plans to swap rooms later in the evening when we returned after having dinner in town, we returned to find that the room was still not available and was told it would be available the day after, this was most annoying and the staff did not really seem to care which was disappointing when you spend a considerable amount of money to stay at this hotel. Either way I would return and did enjoy the overall stay.",4,2011,07,17
36,Helpful staff,"Stayed for a few nights after a cruise. Room was good and spacious and staff in restaurant and front desk very friendly and helpful.

We would have liked to swim as the weather was hot but the pool had not opened - assume it is date rather than weather dependent.

A modern shopping centre with several restaurants is opposite the hotel which was convenient. The ""hop-on, hop-off"" buses stop close to the hotel and we used these but found Barcelona so crowded that we seemed to spend our time queueing for buses rather than sight seeing - not the hotel's fault .......",4,2011,07,09
36,Wonderful location and terrific facilities,"This hotel is 2 blocks from the beach, and across from a big mall and a park. I felt very safe walking in the area, even at night. Very generous space by the pool with lots of chaises and umbrellas and a lovely outdoor seating area on the other side of the bar. The room was nice, the bed comfortable, strange assortment of tv channels in English (cartoon network, natl geographic and fox). We were not told that the room came with breakfast for me (my husband was at a conference at hotel), so I missed out on breakfast for 3 mornings. The restaurant staff do not seem familiar with decaf coffee, twice when I ordered it, i got served a decaf espresso. The mall across the street has lots of outdoor dining options for lunch and dinner, and a 2 story store similar to a supertarget, with groceries on the bottom floor. there is also a movie theater in the mall, but I assume the films would be in spanish. I tried to use Starbucks wireless, free for  45 mn but could not sign on. Could have been operator error, but with the language barrier, it was not too be. Internet at hotel was 27 eu per day, ouch.",4,2011,07,08
36,"""We loved it and will return""","Great location!  The subway is very close.  The hotel has a beautiful view overlooking the Mediterranean Sea.  We were on the concierge floor and only had to eat lunch outside  the hotel.  Nice breakfast and refreshments at night at the hotel.  The rooms are big and the beds comfortable.  The only thing I had to ask for were washcloths.  The staff was very accommodating. I kept watching the price online, and close to the time we were leaving they offered a B&B rate which was much lower than their pay in advance non-refundable rate.",5,2011,07,08
36,"City hotel with nice lobby and pool, and a great exective level lounge.","We had a a couple of hiccups upon arrival that were taken care of promptly.  I even received and email from the hotel manager after I had returned home.  We had a junior suite, I believe room 512.  As big as a full suite in most hotels it had a separate living room.  The bathroom was super modern - full of granite and tile. Cool feature was a pointy window with lounge chairs that afforded views around 75% of the hotel.  Views of the sea and city. The executive floor was very nice.  It indoor and outdoor seating.  Located on a high floor it had spectacular views.  The happy hour food and drink was good quality.  I suggest going down to the main restaurant for breakfast as it has a much larger selection at no additional charge to executive level guests. We ordered room service one night and it was not good.  We ordered hamburgers which might have been a mistake.  They looked and tasted awful.  The dinner was removed from the bill with many apologies.",5,2011,07,01
36,A Very Nice Hotel,"This hotel is a few blocks from the beach, directly across from a shopping center and has lots of restaurants within walking distance.  The room was very clean and spacious.  Will definitely stay there again if we are ever in Barcelona!",4,2011,06,21
36,Amazing hotel with Perfect Service,"After a disappointing start that we had been sent to another hotel for the night before we left on a Mediterranean cruise, the Hilton Diagonal Del Mar staff exceeded all expectations for service upon on return to Barcelona.  We had an amazing suite with an incredible view of the city. The staff was fantastic in providing ideas for our brief stay in Barcelona and the hotel is a quick cab ride from the port and most major attractions.  The outside pool is perfect for families with kids and we would highly recommend this hotel for anyone visiting Barcelona.",5,2011,06,18
36,Excellent Hotel,"Really enjoyed this hotel.  We are long standing Hilton Honors members and have been to Hiltons all over the world.  We really enjoyed our stay here.  Rooms were clean and spacious(especially for Europe).  Hilton executive level on the 15th floor - one of the best that I have ever been to.  Staff at the hotel are very friendly and helpful.  Hotel is not in the heart of the city, but i think, i enjoyed that better.  Subway is amazingly clean and close, not a big deal to get around.  Restaurants across the street were good.  Shopping center across the way was interesting and nice to see.",5,2011,06,15
36,Excellent but a bit pricy,"We stayed here for the Spanish Grand Prix.  Arrived Wednesday with two days sightseeing in Barcelona and then the weekend at the Grand Prix.  Hotel was very comfortable, room good.  Beware of the mini bar as there was no price list and everything was tagged so if you picked it up you would be charged.  Drinks are pricy €30 for 2 G&Ts and meals in both the restaurant and bar are expensive.  However this was a ""bucket list"" trip and so we didn't really care.  Staff extremely pleasant and very helpful.  Great supermarket in the shopping complex opposite where you could buy almost anything.  Barcelona is a wonderful city.  We had heard so much negative feedback about pickpockets and scams so we came well prepared with clothes with inside pockets etc.  We loved the place and had a lovely time sightseeing. We used the open top bus tour recommended by the hotel staff (blue buses).  It was fine with three routes but the main route would seem to be very busy at times with long queues.  Would recommend a trip to Montjuic and Sagrada Familia although the queues to get in are long.",5,2011,06,14
36,"A bit far from CBD, but worth it","Got a great price on a three night stay here. I don't normally choose american hotels, but having diamond status with Hilton meant a very nice upgrade and lounge access. It was nice being a bit removed from the central city-- had no trouble getting to and from the city center at all hours.",5,2011,06,13
36,We wanted to stay there forever,"Second time to Barcelona, second time staying here, the hotel is not located near the city center, it takes about 25 minutes on the Metro to get there, but it is located 1 block from the beach, so it is all worth it. Plus the area is not “heavily touristy,” so you can blend in easily. The hotel is great; our room was very spacious, with all the standard amenities of the Hiltons. We faced the Mediterranean which was just simply great. The executive lounge has a wonderful breakfast that includes Cava, and it has a terrace from where you can see the pretty much the whole cite and the ocean. The view itself is worth the stay. During the day the lounge has snack and drinks, so it is a great place to relax and enjoy the view. The hotel also has a pool and a gym, the pool area is quite large so if you get a chair on the back you can quietly take a nap.
The staff could not have been more accommodating, we changed our departure date 3 times, and they worked with us every time. We just did not want to leave, and could have stay there forever. Since I have been to Barcelona before, I wanted to explore more of “local spots” and the front desk staff was simply great at giving us tips and describing places.
The hotel is a cross the street from a mall that has a grocery store, several restaurants with outdoor seating and a movie theater, so it is perfect.",5,2011,06,13
36,"Super clean and convenient, but not in Plaza Catalunya!","Everything - or almost everything apart from a loose showerhead and a scuffed door - looks and works like brand-new in this smart, clean and attractive hotel.  It's full-on Hilton standard which means power showers, jacuzzi baths with a television IN the bathroom, BOSE sound systems and stereo TV if you can work out the controls in the bedroom.

No dimmable lighting was a bit of a surprise, and they don't provide wash-cloths - but lots of fluffy towels, robes, slippers, safe and everything you'd want or need in a hotel room.  Our rooms looked towards the city which was perfectly nice - the sea's a bit distant even if you get a room on that side.  Try to buy a rate which includes breakfast, which is generous and exceptionally good and the staff in the restaurant are charming - but if you have to pay extra for it, there's a great shopping centre literally across the street which has a huge Alcampo supermarket, and lots of cafes and restaurants if you want something lighter or cheaper.  It seemed to be open till almost midnight, at least on Saturday evening when we passed through coming back from the metro.

The metro is just the other side of the shopping complex - station is El Maresme I Forum on the yellow L3 line and in 15-20 minutes will take you painlessly to Jaume I or Passeig de Gracia and the centre of everything.  A 10-journey metro ticket (which can be shared between more than one person) cost 7.85 Euros, and the service is fast, clean, air-conditioned and seems to run every three or four minutes.   

We appreciated being out of the tourist/pickpocket centre of Barca at night, and enjoyed the sea breeze - although it CAN smell appalling if the wind is in the wrong direction, but you don't get it inside the air-conditioned hotel - and the short stroll from the station back to the hotel.  Two brands of 'hop on hop off' sightseeing buses also stop directly outside, charging 23 Euros for a one-day or 30 Euros for a two-day pass which is reasonable value for the serious sightseer.

If you want to be in the centre, this is not the hotel for you, and another compromise might be in Barceloneta where you're near the water but closer to the town, but if you can get a deal for double rooms including breakfast at around a hundred UK pounds as we did, it felt like a bargain.

There were a lot of American passengers from low-rent mass-market ships like NCL and Carnival using the hotel for pre- or post- cruise touring which made the atmosphere in the lobby a bit like a polyester convention in Cleveland, but not for long. 

Hotel staff were very helpful and knowledgeable, some even anticipating needs or questions before being asked, and noting my birth date only from my passport/registration, the hotel delivered cava and chocolate cake to the room.

Be aware that ANYthing outside your 'package' will be expensive - a simple room service burger will set you back 40 Euros once you've included tray charge, tax and tip, a coke from the minibar runs to about 6 Euros.  Wi-Fi is NOT included anywhere in the hotel, a serious omission for a 'business' place like this one, and costs 27 Euros a day plus service/tax. Use the shopping centre for your non-inclusive needs.",4,2011,06,13
36,BEWARE – REFUSED TO HONOR PAID RESERVATION,"Pre-cruisers be forewarned, booking early and getting a good rate may spell trouble ahead. We made advance reservations and prepaid for 2 rooms at this hotel to secure a May 27 pre-cruise stay. We were cruising on the Disney Magic and also paid Disney extra for the convenience of transferring our luggage from this hotel to the port, especially since one member of our party was my 84 year old mother.   
             We had enjoyed 2 previous stays here and my husband is Hilton Honors Gold. When we reached the check in counter, we were pulled aside and told that due to a “system error”, the hotel would not be able to accommodate our reservations. Despite dealing with the embarrassment of speaking with both the asst. and gen. manager in a public lobby, we were told the best they could do was put us up in a nearby “beachfront 4 star hotel”.  
             The ""beachfront 4 star"" hotel turned out to be a Spanish economy hotel on a busy street, a couple of blocks from the ocean. Our rooms were tiny, no view, no bellman, no coffee maker, etc. To add to our frustration, we saw others checking into the Diagonal Mar both before and after we were turned away. The manager offered to buy us dinner at the hotel as compensation; we declined because in our opinion, returning to the hotel after this experience would only add to our humiliation.",1,2011,06,12
36,Nice hotel - TERRIBLE location,"This hotel is WAY further out of town then I originally thought! It is literally 15 minutes from EVERYTHING you want to see/do. The hotel itself is very nice and filled w/ American tourists and all your modern American needs (which makes it in my opinion, too boring of a hotel in Europe)! 
Thank goodness we did the hop-on hop-off bus which stopped a block down from this hotel and was on the route saving us a lot in cab fare, but the bus was still SLOW SLOW SLOW and was also not that great of an experience as we could've walked faster everywhere then taking that thing.. 
Our room was very large and nice. Had a lovely tv which was interactive which was nice, but had only 10 or so channels in English.  The bathroom was definitely one of the nicest I've ever had in Europe as it was large and spacious and had nice plush robes, slippers and a hair dryer. 
PROS: bathroom, large room, dining, front desk staff, safe, robes, slippers, breakfast buffet
CONS: Way outside of downtown (in financial/business district), super $$$$ internet fee(go across street to McDonalds for free wi-fi), super-SLOW elevators and only 4 (for this HUGE hotel), far 20-25 minutes from the airport!",3,2011,06,07
36,great service but small rooms,"hotel has a good location. food is good, polite staff..but room size is very small. the hotel is old too. not great view too. but if its a business trip then its worth the money. convention hall is great.",3,2011,06,03
36,Fantastic Hotel and Location,"Spent 6 nights here as part of a retirement present and can only reiterate the sentiments expressed in other reviews.  Although not in the centre of Barcelona - the hotel is a 15 minute ride on the metro from the centre - this is in fact an advantage.  The area is a lot quieter although there is plenty to do with the beach and a shopping centre within easy walking distance.

The hotel itself is definitely one of the best Hilton's that I've stayed at and the staff enjoy working there. This makes for a great atmosphere where no request is considered too much!

The outside pool on the second floor is a good size and is well supported by a bar providing whatever refreshments you may require.  This was a definite highlight of our stay as the staff working at the pool were particularly friendly and helful .

Next time we visit Barcelona we'll definitely stay at the Diagonal Mar again",5,2011,05,31
36,"Nice hotel, but not quite as nice as I was expecting","This is certainly a nice and comfortable hotel, with a pleasant staff and good service. Everything was sort of a level down from what I expected though - the rooms were large and clean, but the windows were all locked ""for security reasons."" This would have been less of an annoyance had they kept the windows clean, but they were quite dirty on the outside and had fingerprint smudges all over the inside, making the view of the ocean a lot less enjoyable than it could have been. This is obviously nit-picky, but in a beach resort style hotel that bills itself as a luxury place, I think it's worth mentioning. Also, the hotel is about a block or two from the beach, and they don't provide chairs or towels for the beach (in fact they have someone at the exit of the hotel preventing you from bringing a hotel towel outside, so if you want a towel on the beach you need to bring your own). You should also know that the hotel is a bit out of the way geographically, and there isn't really anything to do or anyplace interesting to eat or drink in the immediate area. All told though, this hotel was perfectly fine - it just failed to impress as a beach resort.",3,2011,05,30
36,Wonderful hotel,"This is definitely one of the nicest hilton hotels that I've stayed in.  Although the location is not in the center of Barcelona but the train station is 5 minutes walk away from the hotel, and the airport is a 30 minute cab ride away.  When I was searching for hotels in Barcelona, I read a lot of reviews about noises and poor sleep quality in a lot of the hotels in city center.  Sleep quality at the hilton was awesome.  We were away from everything and it was quiet, I couldn't ask for a better place to be after a long day of touring.  We are also hilton gold members and had access to the executive lounge.  views from the EL is awesome, you can have a drink or breakfast with a beautiful view of the beaches of Barcelona.  I highly recommend this hotel to anyone who is staying in Barcelona.",4,2011,05,24
36,Enjoyable and comfortable stay,"We were greeted by very friendly front desk person, Oscar, who spent a full 15 minutes orientating us to our location and advising on public transport and what to do, when he found out it was our first time in Spain.
The lady at the executive lounge also spent another 15 miutes advising us on the sights and what not to spend our money on etc She advised not to get the day travel pass but get the T-10 (ten trip ticket that can be shared by more than one person) as many attractions in Barcelona are within walking distance of each other. The location near beach in a quieter part of town was ideal for me. After a busy day in the city centre it was nice to get back to the hotel to relax. Not into night life so it suited me fine to be away from the hustle bustle at night. Executive floor with lounge access was worth the money with almost free flow alcohol till 10pm. Not a drinker myself, I nevertheless enjoyed a glass of cava every day , free flow soft drinks and the afternoon tea (very good chocolate cake!). Snacks served in the evening were good for a light dinner or a prelude to a late night dinner as is normal in Spain.
Swimming pool and beach still a bit cold for swimming but I imagine perfect in the hotter months.
Taxis easily available outside hotel and the area around was safe enough for an evening walk.
We walked about 20 minutes to a very nice restaurant recommended by hotel - El Pescador
Topless sunbathers at the beach just a block away from the hotel if that is your thing! Rental bicycles also easily available in Barcelona and unlike Melbourne, no helmets required.
Shopping centre across the road made it easy to get supplies. Hotel bar fridge had a thougtful small space for you to put in personal items. Ice machine on every floor and containers provided as well. Tea and coffee in room.
We were given a beautiful corner room with bath tub at the window and great view of the Mediterranean sea.
We really enjoyed our stay and would go back again to the Hilton at Diagonal Mar.",4,2011,05,24
36,Great hotel but away from city center,"Excellent service and room. We called ahead to request a crib and it was available for us. The room was clean, ample, and bed was very comfortable. I agree with the other review that hotel is away from city center but metro stop is very close. You can get to city center easily within 15 min. The shopping center in front of hotel is great and you can enjoy the tapas in the terrace. I would stay here again. Be aware that wifi is not free and I thought it was a bit expensive compared with other hotels.",4,2011,05,23
36,extremely disappointed with desk service,Word of Warning...... We just went to Barcelona. We had a lovely time except.... Hilton Diagonal Mar. We have always had great experiences at many other Hiltons but not this one. They totally tried to put our family out on the streets at 10pm at night. It took us 2hours to get our room which made it midnight. They tried to charge us a crazy additional amount just because we had a second child. Even though kids are suppose to stay free at Hiltons and kept saying it was a law in Spain. It all started when they looked at us when we walked up with jeans and backpacks and not suits or dress. It got worse when they found we were Americans. The next night they were giving other Americans trouble! We have never felt discriminated against until this hotel. We didn't have any other problems in the area except with that hotel. I still can not believe they didn't want to give us a room and tried to turn us away at 10pm with two kids. I was extremely disappointed with their desk service. I feel that they tried to take advantage of us and just wanted money. It was all about getting more money. I did not feel like they cared about our family in the least.,1,2011,05,23
36,"Good hotel, away from city center","The hotel itself was very nice and everything you would expect from the Hilton brand.  The only drawback is that it is far from city center.  However, it's not a deal killer since the metro is only a 5 minute walk away and you can get to center center in about 15 minutes total travel time.  There is a very nice and sizable mall directly across the hotel so shopping is good.  I recommend this hotel if you don't mind the small inconvenience.",4,2011,05,20
36,Great hotel and amenities,"We arrived on a Monday morning after a 25 minute trip from the airport by taxi.  Our room was ready at this time and we received excellent service from the bellman and the front desk.  The room was clean and very comfortable and with a great view of the sea.  We did need to ask for an adapter for our chargers which was gladly given.  As Hilton Honor Gold members we were on the Executive Floor and had use to the Lounge.  My goodness, it was awesome.  We only used the facility in the morning for breakfast but it supplied all that you would need and more.  The free wifi in the room was great!  The location is across the street from the mall (many great restaurant choices) and easy access to the tram and metro.  We did not feel that this location being outside of the city center was at all an inconvenience to the sites since the metro is so easy to use and learn.  Highly recommend!",5,2011,05,17
36,"Big Hotel, but it feels small!!!","Me and 4 friends stayed for 4 nights. The service held the same level all the way. From the friendly staff at the restaurant to the spotless cleaningladies.
The rooms were good. Beds were good. The isolation of the walls must been something extra, because we did not here anyone else, although the hotel was full booked at that time. The breakfast was good, something for everyone. The weather did not allow us to try the pool. The shopping Mall across the street had all supplies we needed. You can allways find a taxi outside of the hotell. I cant find any negative to say about this hotel. I totally recommend it.",4,2011,05,16
36,One of the nicest Hiltons we have ever stayed in anywhere!!!,"We have been blessed to stay in Hiltons from Huntington Beach, CA and Beverly Hills, CA to Key West, FL, Times Square, NY, and many in between. The one in Barcelona was a nice surprise and far exceeded our expectations. Food and service was Superior as well as the physical hotel. Location was great, right across the street from the largest Mall in Barcelona. A big Plus was that we could see the Mediterranean Sea from our balcony.",5,2011,05,16
36,It's a Hilton.... but far from the centre of Barcelona!,"We had a great deal for 4 nights (121 euro per night including breakfast!) so didn't hesitate to book this hotel earlier in the year. Unfortunately it was some way out from the city centre and with hindsight would rather have paid more for a hotel in the city centre itself. However we used the metro a lot and it is really cheap and efficient.( The nearest metro station is about 7 or 8 mins walk away). We didn't discover anything in the immediate area to grab me - there is a large shopping mall, with the associated eateries  just across the road from the hotel.
The hotel itself is a large and modern, probably great for business conferences but not a great leisure hotel, although it has a large terrace and swimming pool. The breakfasts were very good and the staff kept you glass filled with orange juice. There are views  to the sea and beach, which are about 5 minutes walk away. From the other side of the hotel you have excellent views, including the towers of the Sagrada Familia (a must visit!). The bedroom was fine and clean and have no complaints on the service. So in summary if you like the Hilton type of hotel and don't mind being some distance from the centre of Barcelona you probably won't be disappointed",4,2011,05,11
36,So nice!,"Clean, clean, clean -- everything we saw was spotless. Spent two nights here in May. Room was spacious and comfortable. View of the city was as stunning as the view of the sea. Executive lounge had stunning views, great drink selection and comfortable chairs. Restaurant was OK, but the restaurant staff was fantastic. Desk and bell staff were polite and helpful. My only regret is staying too early in the year to be able to take advantage of the pool and beach. 
We took the double-decker tourist buses to get to and around the city. Shopping mall across the street from the hotel had many places to get a bite to eat.",4,2011,05,10
36,Premium quality - again again,"Were there with a friend to watch Barca. Stayed 3 nights. Excellent service - excellent breakfast, improvements made since our last stay.
Only one bad mark. HILTON WHERE IS YOUR FREE WIFI. COME ON ITS 2011. 2 stars hotels offer it now!!",5,2011,05,09
36,Wonderful  hotel,"This was our second stay at this hotel.  Due to construction on our floor management asked us to change our room.   We were staying for 11 nights and were surprised that when the room was assigned, the fact that construction was going to occur midway through our stay was not considered.  Because of the inconvenience we were moved to a wonderful corner room with a view of the city and the ocean.  

The service was wonderful, the staff was helpful and friendly. This  Hilton is outside of downtown Barcelona,  however the metro is within walking distance and the prices on the metro are reasonable. Finding one's way around Barcelona is easy.  The maps on the metro are well marked. The walk back at night from the Metro did not feel threatening in the least.   

 There is a mall across the street with restaurants, a movie theater and a mega store that is a best described as a super Walmart.   You can buy water and snacks for reasonable prices at the grocery store, which is huge.  The selection of olive oils and the low prices were awesome.

We like to walk. The beach is two blocks away from the hotel, and offers some small restaurants for drinks and tapas. We walked from the hotel down Barceloneta.  The walk took about 45 minutes and was enjoyable.  

It was not warm enough to use the pool, however if  the weather had been more cooperative,  I would not hesitate the next time we are in Barcelona to make some time for laying by the pool.

We left this Hilton wishing that we received the same quality of service at Hilton  Hotels in the states.  My one complaint is the high rate for parking.  I was shocked by the price of 37 euros per night to park a rental car.  

If we return to Barcelona we will not hesitate to stay at this Hilton again.",4,2011,05,08
36,Great Hotel,"We stayed in this hotel during a business trip to Barcelona. We had actually stayed at another hotel closer to the main section of town for a few nights as well, but this hotel was like a palace compared to the other hotel choices with tiny rooms. The ocean view is quite nice and the accommodations are huge. A nice large bathroom and comfortable bedding, very clean! It is a bit far from attractions (Las Rablas and others), so you must taxi to these locations, but it is worth it to stay in such a nice place. The staff is very efficient, food for breakfast was very good. There is a wonderful shopping mall directly across the street. A good choice.",5,2011,05,06
36,"Unbelievable hotel, location, and executive lounge","We stayed two nights before a cruise.  Very easy to get to from the airport, about 35 Euros.  Our room, a junior suite was already ready upon arrival around 10 am.  A beautiful corner room overlooking the Mediterannean.  We were worried that the location was a little isolated - no worries!  Right across the street is a shopping mall, it has many stores including a Targeta (Target) with a large grocery store on the first level with a huge wine selection (most cruise lines let you take wine on board) at higher quality and far lower prices than on the ships.  Nice restaurants across the street.  Just outside the hotel doors is a stop for the Hop-On Hop-Off Tour Bus that will take you to all the sights in Barcelona.  You must get an upgrade to the executive lounge.  Unbelievable.  Great breakfast with eggs, breads, meats, cheeses, fruits.  Even better evening with open bar, wine, beer, even hard liquor (although rarely partaken of by Europeans), and excellent food - have a big lunch in town and make your dinner here for free.  This lounge blows anything in the US Hiltons away.  I would stay here again in a heartbeat.  The staff was friendly and very helpful.  Several local ATM's on the block to get Euro's.  Metro stop just on the other side of the mall, Barcelona has a clean, efficient metro, one of the best in Europe.",5,2011,05,06
36,"Very good hotel, friendly staff","Located close to shopping centre , beach and metro . A friendly and attractive hotel with nice rooms",4,2011,05,02
36,Awesome hotel huge room,we were in a corner room that gave us excellent vies of the city as well as the sea. The room was huge even with a pull out sofa bed for my daughter. Breakfast was included and was excellent. Wifi has to be paid for as this seems to be the norm for Hilton's across Europe. Even the staff suggested that we go across to the huge shopping mall directly across from the hotel for free wifi access. This hotel is not near the city center But was easily accessibly by cab or tour bus. All in all this was a great place to stay and we would definitely stay there again.,5,2011,05,01
36,Excellent Hotel nothing but praise,"We chose this Hotel as it was outside of the city and near the beach.  We were not disapointed.  Really fab Hotel, staff always willing to go the extra mile.  Our room on the executive floor was perfect view of beach and sea.  Very clean and well maintained.  The food was really good.  Breakfast was great never having to wait for a table and the choice was amazing.  There is a large shopping centre opposite the Hotel which has some nice little eateries, a fair selection of shops and is clean and pleasant to shop in.  We used the hop on hop off bus tours which I have to say were brilliant. Excellent value and we certainly saw a whole lot more than we would have done otherwise.  Back to the Hotel, excellent location, there is a fab restaurante nearby which was receommned by Hotel, it was really really nice.  Go stay at this Hotel you will not be disapointed you will be amazed.  The Manager must do a fantastic job as all and I mean all staff were excellent.",5,2011,04,29
36,not as bad as everyone says!,"Great location, good service and nice breakfast.  I actually found the bed very comfortable!  Had some great sleeps in it, and I'm a bad sleeper.  I'd like to shout out to MARC on reception.  He was extremely helpful in helping us find somewhere nice to eat (Da Greco).

Don't pick up any of the mini bar food or drink if you don't intend to eat  or drink it!  It is sense monitored so after five seconds of picking it up got get charged for it.

Only complaint we had was the walls were very thin.  We could hear next doors' TV as if it was our own.  Plus, we had a snorer next to us which the people above could hear too.  We knew this because they thought it was us, and proceeded to bang on their floor (our ceiling) during the night.  Not nice.  

Also, we were lead to believe that we'd be able to use the wi-fi the hotel advertises.  We got there and learned it was 17 euros a day to use!  Extortionate.  My partner was going to bring the laptop to use this service, but I took my iphone instead, luckily.  Imagine if he'd brought it all the way to Spain only to find out it cost so much to use it!  

All in all, we had a very pleasant stay in the Hilton.  Just be warned, take earplugs with you!",3,2011,04,27
36,"Wonderful Hotel, great location","Fantastic hotel, everything very new, rooms had amazing city and sea views, very quiet, safe area, huge range of hot/cold breakfast buffet, all the staff were wonderful (especially Russell!) great base to see Barcelona as the open top tourist buses stop on the opposite side of the road, theres also a big shopping centre opposite complete with cafes/restaurants, taxi ride to/from airport came in at 27/36 euros,weekday/holiday weekend  not cheap but split 4 ways as cheap at Metro/Airport bus, beach 2 mins walk away with decent cafes/restaurants, 40 min walk along seafront into central Barcelona (more with moaning teenagers) Decathlon outdoors shop at Port Forum a revelation with loads of nice quality outdoor stuff, ski stuff very cheap, Ginos pasta restaurant across road was good but not cheap, would stay there again without hesitation",5,2011,04,23
36,"Great Hotel , a bit far from the main sites","Stayed there two nights . Asked and got a room with a view of the sea. Very helpful and smiling staff . Clean, lovely, spacious room . Touristic bus just across the street and also a regular bus into the city. Metro 5 minutes away . Just opposite a shopping mall for last minute shopping. If you don't mind a 20 minute ride into the city to see the attractions then a perfect Hotel.",4,2011,04,23
36,Nice hotel - location a downside,"I stayed at this hotel for a conference with work and found it to be fairly average Hilton hotel.  Main disappointment was that the rooms are not very soundproof which is surprising for a Hilton hotel.  I was on the Executive floor and constantly heard a lot of noise from other rooms/staff/guests coming in late at night. 
The rooms are nice and breakfast is fantastic with plenty of choice.  I found it strange there was no concierge at the hotel but I suppose they mainly use this hotel for business.  The hotel staff on the reception desk were not very friendly or welcoming when I checked in and then called me the next morning at 7am to double check my reservation! which again I found surprising considering it was Hilton hotel.  
I did have 1 day to tour round Barcelona and although the hop on/hop off tour bus is just around the corner from the hotel (5 minutes walk if that) you have to stay on the bus and change buses to get on the 'red' route to take you to most the sites.  Not a big deal but can waste time if you are waiting for buses or buses are full!  You can take the metro into town but as I was travelling alone I used the tourist bus (which I can highly recommend).
The beach is a 5 minutes walk from the hotel and is quite empty most the time as most the people go to the beach on the Port Olympic side which is around a 40-45 minutes walk from the hotel.  I wouldn't suggest walking to Las Ramblas from this hotel as I think it's quite a distance.
The hotel was nice, but there was no atmosphere to be honest and staff were not very helpful. Taxis are readily available at the taxi rank right outside the hotel which is useful but make sure you have cash on you for the taxis as most of them do not take credit cards.
There is a swimming pool and deck area at the hotel but it doesn't look like anyone uses it much and is always empty.  I didn't try out these facilities so can't comment apart from the fact the pool looked quite small.
Stayed here on a business trip and the conference rooms/facilities were great and staff very helpful and nice at the business centre, however, I wouldn't really recommend this hotel for a holiday stay - there are far more hotels much closer to the centre or Port Olympic area which are only a 10 minute walk into town.
Hope this helps!",4,2011,04,20
36,Great hotel next to the beach.,"Stayed for 2 nights in a relaxation room with a sea view. Front desk staff extremely friendly and welcoming - made us feel right at home. Rooms are beginning to date a little but still well equipped and clean. We had breakfast on both mornings - great choice and constantly being restocked. Breakfast staff very helpful and friendly - just what you need in the mornings. 

The hotel is next to the beach and across from the Diagonal Mar shopping centre(this has lots of eating places too) The metro is a 5 minute walk and gets you onto the yellow line. About 15 minutes to Passeig de Gracia.  We had already spent a week in Eixample and did most of our sightseeing then, so the location suited us fine for relaxing and chilling on beach. 

Overall I would recommend this hotel if you want good service and don't need to be in the centre of the city.",4,2011,04,16
36,"Good hotel, great staff, location is a long way from city centre.","Staff were v friendly and helpful, especially when we arrived after having just been pick pocketed on the metro. Hotel was lovely - v clean, great breakfast. Unfortunately the swimming pool was closed (open only from May - Sept) but it's so close to the beach that our daughter didn't mind. Beach is really nice. Surrounding area is a bit dull - lots of chain restaurants so you have to go into town to get any interesting food. Close to the metro, which is good. My only criticism is why do Hilton hotels still charge for use of Wifi when most places don't ? (It was an alarming 22 Euro a day!) . All in all the Hilton Diaganol is a really nice hotel, and the staff are excellent.",4,2011,04,14
36,A lovely hotel with excellent service and a great breakfast,"Away from the centre, but only a short taxi ride away (with taxi rank right outside), not far from the Metro, and also on the hop-on, hop-off bus route.  The front desk, porter service and restaurant staff all very helpful and friendly.  Can't fault the rooms, and very little noise from the corridor which can sometimes be a problem.  Only wish I'd known that the pool and poolside bar didn't open unitl May before I booked, as we were looking forward to that, and the temperature was in the mid-20s.  But we had plenty to do, so may not have had time to use it anyway!  All in all, a very comfortable stay.",4,2011,04,13
36,A true home from home with fantastic service,"Our six visit to the Diagonal Mar in less than two years, that must say something !!
The Diagonal Mar Barcelona..."" Par Excellence ""... We have just returned from a six night stay at one of our favourite hotels and as always have had the most fantastic time. Although the GM Ignacio Rodriguez was absent (attending GM conference) the hotel ran like clock work. His team are amazing at every level and make their guests feel totally at home, looking after their every need to the highest of standards.
As a regular client and a Diamond HH member we were upgraded to a lovely Junior Suite on the 14 Floor (also celebrating my 49th birthday) so we had full use of the Executive Lounge. Well worth also upgrading too as this is one of the best lounges we have visited to date. Marta, Cecilia and Maria run a very tight ship, a truly relaxing atmosphere, fantastic service and the most wonderful outside terrace with the best views in Barcelona. (even better at night with a cool glass of Cava !!)
This is truly a Hilton you must visit if going to Barcelona. Some say the location is a little far from the centre, I do not agree, you are in the centre within 15mins by the no 41 bus and even quicker by metro (Forum ) the jouney is well worth it to have the luxury of being able to stay in a true home from home.
Keep the good work up, already looking forward to a seventh visit!!",5,2011,04,11
36,Good but away from the city centre,"This is a typical Hilton hotel. When you book into a Hilton you expect a certain standard and this hotel does not dissapoint.
The only negative point about this hotel is its location which is away from the city centre.
Internet access is expensive but this is the norm for hotels in Barcelona or Madrid.",4,2011,03,31
36,Exceptional Service from all at Hilton Diagonal Mar--Barcelona,"As a Diamond honors member with Hilton, I am pleased to let anyone planning a trip to Barcelona to book your stay with this specific Hilton! The manager, Ignacio Rodriquez, and all of his excellent staff were outstanding in providing service to my family (and our friends who also join us) during our recent stay and vacation at the Hilton Diagonal Mar--Barcelona.",5,2011,03,26
36,Enjoyed our stay at this beautiful hotel,"My husband and I spent 6 nights at this hotel in March 2011.  We stayed in an executive floor room which allowed us to have access to the executive lounge.  The lounge was great.  They had breakfast, tea snacks and another service of snacks before dinner.  There were many drinks to choose from in the lounge from coffee to alcoholic drinks.  We were also given a choice of eating our breakfast in the restaurant on the 1st floor.  We did enjoy the beautiful buffet breakfast each morning.  The buffet had everything you could want for breakfast!  The room was spotless and very quiet.   The hotel staff really went out of their way to make sure we were happy.  Everyone was so friendly and pleasant.  The hotel sits across the street from a shopping center where you can shop for most anything and there are some places to eat as well.  The metro station is just a short walk from the hotel and it is very easy to get to the more tourist areas of Barcelona.  The only negative thing about the hotel would be the cost of the internet, it was so expensive that we did without. Barcelona is a beautiful city and we never felt unsafe.  You just have to be smart and aware of your surroundings.  Enjoy!",5,2011,03,23
36,Excellent Hotel - Would Stay Here Again,"Stayed in Hilton Diagonal Mar in Barcelona, Spain in December 2010.  This was a very nice hotel, nice rooms, friendly service, very helpful and great breakfast on the morning of departure.  You have a great view of Barcelona and the ocean from the upper floors.  In addition, this hotel is directly across the street from a shopping mall.",5,2011,03,22
36,Good Stay,"We stayed for a night in March.  The hotel was a great base to see the city (although it's a little way out of the centre).  It's also close to the beach where we enjoyed some bracing walks in the rain!  There's a shopping centre directly opposite which is worth a visit.  All the staff we met in the hotel were welcoming and efficient.  The room was a good size, perhaps just on the edge of becoming a little dated furniture-wise, but everything was to a very good standard.  The Exec Lounge was fine although the breakfast and other service offerings there were not as generous as some other Hiltons we've stayed at.",4,2011,03,18
36,Excellent base for Barcelona,"I took a a party of fifty people to this hotel for a sports trip and the service given was excellent and staff were really helpful and polite.

I have downgraded the location, not for the fact that it is bad, but because it is not a central hotel within Barcelona. However, the city centre is a short tram or metro ride away. It is near the beach and has a shopping centre directly opposite which offers restaurants and bars as well as shops.

The rooms are spacious with comfortable beds and large bathrooms and some have a sea view which in March was not that great but would be better during the hotter months. They are well equipped with robes, slippers, mini bar and coffee and tea facilities. They appear to be equipped for all business needs. Included in our rates was an excellent breakfast in a well run restaurant.

The bar prices were a little on the excessive side hence the 4 star value rating. Plenty of cheaper options elsewhere and the staff were more than happy to assist in guiding you to the better ones on offer in the area.

All in all more of a business hotel but would highly recommend for a short stay in Barcelona just for a city break.",5,2011,03,09
36,A biit of luxury in a quiet area with the city centre still easily accessible,"We got this hotel on a special offer - and what a great bargain! It is on the outskirts of Barcelona but this was no problem - the metro is a 5 minute walk away and it takes 15 minutes to get to the town centre.  Our room was great - slippers and dressing gowns included, tea and coffee making facilities (toppped up daily) and a really comfortable bed with a quilt and feather pillows. Our room was on the 8th floor.  At first we were disappointed we didnt have a sea view, but I dont think any of the lower, non-executive rooms would have one as there is another tall building n the way.  Instead we had views of the city and mountains.  At night, lit up through the massive windows, this was awesome. There was a full mini bar but we didnt use it because the prices were outrageous - 5 euros for a can of coke and 4 euros for a small bottle of mineral water (although I have to say, if you eat or drink on the Ramblas you will pay the same price) Likewise, a continental breakfast cost 20 euros each.  However, if you are on a budget like us, there is a massive shopping centre opposite (a spanish equivalent of Westfields for all you Londoners!) which had loads of eating places including mcdonalds and starbucks. The hotel was supposed to be quite full, but you would never have guessed it - it was lovely and quiet.  Having such a nice hotel to come back to after a long days sightseeing really made the holiday special for us.",5,2011,02,27
36,"Comfortable modern hotel, terrific breakfast","Very  nice room, comfortable bed.  Somewhat far from downtown, but next to the beach.

The breakfast buffet was lovely - cut fruit, iberian ham and other meat, yogurt, pastries, and 8-10 chafing dishes of your normal breakfast foot - eggs, bacon, potatoes, etc.

They woudl even make you a espresso rather than plain coffee.",3,2011,02,24
36,Excellent business hotel,"After a terrible experience in the Hilton Barcelona (the other Hilton), I checked out after one night and moved to the Hilton Diagonal Mar.  What a difference !

I arrived early in the morning after check out in the other Hilton.  Check in was very efficient and my room was ready.  I had a wonderful corner room (2110) on the 21st floor with view on the sea and the city.  Very specious, modern and clean.  The way you expect a Hilton hotel room to be.

The service is great : check in, check out, the bar, the exec lounge.  Everywhere, the staff is very professional and friendly.

Also the gym is great and open 24 hours a day.  

Only positive memories !",5,2011,02,05
36,nice hotel to explore barcelona from,"i stayed in hilton diagonal mar in july 2010 with my daughter for a business/leisure trip. the hotel is in the new section of barcelona-forum far from the las ramplas- which was a plus for us, our room was meticulous-lots of space and the hotel was very efficient-from check in to check out, breakfast and pool side services- we used the pool which was great. amist- high rises in the area but we were also 5 minutes from the beach and we also spent time on the beach-nicer part of the barcelona beach as the ones close to las ramplas were very crowded and did not really look safe. i did not take anything to the beach except some small amount of cash and our hotel room key-
the sight seeing bus was in front of the hotel- which we used and also taxis in front of hotel 24 hours-transportation was a breeze- another plus for us was the shopping mall across the street with lots of places to eat and shop. our stay was very pleasant. the hotel also arranged tickets for us for theme parks and flamenco shows-which we enjoyed.  We also had a great view from the room-the beach and sagradia familia. i attach a picture-i would definitely stay again",5,2011,01,21
36,Best Hilton ever - not a touristclass hotel,"Have seen many Hiltons. This almost brand new hotel at the end of the Diagonal is in a class of its own. Topservice, poolarea so classy. Poolrestaurant very vey good.
Fitnesscenter good. Breakfast super. Cant find anything to complain. Not even close to.
Stayed one week with children aged 6 and 8.

WIFI too pricy - but thats hilton!",5,2011,01,11
36,impressive hotel outside of the center,"This very new hotel is located on the opposite side of town compared to its sister hotel the Hilton, only a block away from the seaside. There are public buses right outside, and a subway station underneath the very large shopping mall across the street, which is also home to many reasonably priced eateries.
The hotel is an impressive, airy structure that lets in plenty of light. The rooms are spacious, upscale, obviously very modern, very quiet, with very large bathrooms.
Service was very polished throughout.
I strongly recommend this hotel unless being within walking distance of central Barcelona is a priority.",5,2010,11,27
36,Exceeded my expectations,"My partner and I stayed at this property at the beginning of November.  To say the least, we were very impressed.  Below is a  recap of our experience in Barcelona:

Airport experience:  Barcelona has a wonderful airport.  It is beautiful and easy to get around.

Taxi:  The taxi area is clearly marked and it was very easy to get a taxi.  The fare is around 35 Euro to get to the hotel (it is metered so this will depend on traffic).

Check-in:  We arrived at 9:30 am at the hotel and were able to check in promptly with no additional charges as others indicated (it may be because we were Diamond HH members).  The front desk was very helpful in answering any questions we had.

Room:  The room was very modern (which we loved).  Our room was on the 23rd floor and overlooked the Med Sea.  We could not have asked for a better view.  The only complaint was the bed ""on wheels"".  It felt each thing we tried to lay up against the back of the bed, the bed would move away from the wall.

Executive lounge - This hotel has one of the best executive lounges we have every been to.  It is open all day and has wonderful offerings.  The view is great and it has an outstanding outdoor space that you can view both the city and the sea.

Location:  As everyone has already said, this hotel is not central to the city, but it is close to the metro line (which is very reasonably priced for a big city).

Added bonus:  Cirque Du Soleil's Varekai is being performed just a couple of blocks away from the hotel.  We attend the show and it added to our wonderful stay in Barcelona.

The city - Barcelona is a beautiful city.  Our only wish is that we would have spent more time in Barcelona.  The city is well maintained, has lots of attractions and is easy to navigate.  We did a lot of traveling on foot including a walk from Las Ramblas back to the hotel (would not recommend if you are not physcially fit).  We stop at the casino and a had dinner on our way back.  We cannot wait to go back and experience more of what Barcelona has to offer.

Overall, the city and this hotel is 5 stars all the way.",5,2010,11,20
36,"Nice, but location a bit deserted and minibar prices outraegous","Hotel was nice, rooms clean and spacious, but a bit noisy. It is also a bit deserted.

Checkin was a bit lengthy and prices of minibar a scandal. 4 EUR for a kit kat or bottl of water. We were served a buffet lunch (convention), which was really really boring.

Even Wifi crazy - a mere 27 EUR/24 hours",4,2010,11,08
36,A real gem in the Hilton family,"I stay in a lot of Hiltons and the Hilton Diagonal Mar ranks in my top 2 or 3 worldwide.  We stayed 5 nights on a mix of business and pleasure.

Rooms: super clean, very comfortable beds, not as much hallway noise as many of the other Hiltons get, nice bright furnishings.  Our view from the 23rd floor was stunning as we were facing the Sea.  Didn't want to ever close the blinds :)

Service:  desk staff is extremely helpful, as is the concierge. They also speak English, Spanish and Catalan, among others; no matter what you speak, you will find someone at this hotel who speaks it.  

Bar service: keep in mind you are not in America any more. This is not a ding at the hotel at all. They do it different in Spain than we do in the States. Do not go expecting American-style service.  If you sit in the bar area, someone will serve you, and they will be polite and helpful, but it won't be as fast or overly-bubbly as you're used to in the US.

Food and beverage choices: you're in Barcelona. Go eat somewhere else. The menu is 80% the same Hilton menu you will find all over the world, and the same quality. There is nothing wrong with it. But if you're in one ofthe great food cities in the world, go explore and try something you've never had before. 

The 15th Floor Executive Lounge is well worth the upgrade charge if you don't get it free from your Hilton status. It has a very large wrap-around deck which is great for cocktail hour if it's not too windy; self-serve bar after 5pm or so; smoking is allowed on the deck AND it's windy enough that if you're a non-smoker, your smoking neighbors won't bother you; very nice selection of snacks during cocktail hour and great breakfast.

Definitely recommend this hotel!",5,2010,11,07
36,Worst Hilton experience ever - do not recommend,"We stayed twice at the Hilton Diagonal Mar - for three days before our cruise and five days after our cruise. The room was booked by my boyfriend's father using his HHonors points. My boyfriend was on leave from Afghanistan so we were very excited about this trip and I was very hopeful after reading the positive reviews. 

Before I get to the negative - a tip for people who want wifi. They charge 35 euro (or 39? something ridiculous) for wifi access. I found a cheaper option as the hotel is also a Boingo wireless hotspot. You can login at boingo.com and it is only $19.95 /day which is not free, but beats the 35 euro you would pay for the same service from Swisscom. The mall across the street also has free wifi for 30 min.

I have to say that the some of the front desk staff can be very rude and inefficient. We extended our stay by one night for the first stay and somehow it didn't register in their computers. We were locked out of our room so we went to the front desk. We spoke to a nice (albeit completely hopeless) gentleman and showed him on my iphone the confirmation with confirmation number and other details. We said we can print this out, but he said ""the business center is closed"" (it is only open mon-fri) and didn't tell us we could print it out on a public computer in the lobby. So I used up more of my data plan sending him the email confirmation. He said it would take ""awhile"" for the email to go through (not sure what email system they are using, but okay) so he would let us wait in our hotel room. We had plans that night and figured the wait would be short. We were wrong. An hour later he called and said we would have to pay for the room. I asked him about the confirmation I sent about the change and he said they couldn't figure it out. I told him he would have to speak to my boyfriend who was in the shower at the time and he said he would call back. 15 minutes later her called back to say everything was worked out and we would not have to re-pay for that night. I can't imagine why they took an hour and a half to find our reservation after we sent them and showed them the confirmation number, but of course no apologies. It seems they are used to complaints.

The second time we stayed there we had a different room facing another building. Our first room was lovely and faced the ocean. Our second room, 706, was missing the kettle part of the hot water kettle, the bathroom door kept getting jammed closed and the electrical socket in the bathroom was loose. The towel rack in the shower was falling off and hanging at a precarious angle. 

We ordered room service the first day and it was awful. The burger looked like a frozen one that had been microwaved, not the juicy Hilton burger on the pictures. The lasagna was frozen in the center. It ended up being about 80 euro total. They also (inexplicably) charged us the for the two calls we made to room service. We also ate once in the hotel restaurant for breakfast and it was 40 euro a person for the mediocre continental breakfast. Definitely go across the street for food instead.

The maid service was also ... not great. Sometimes they would leave the box of tea and coffee, sometimes they would take it away, sometimes they would replace the dirty coffee mugs with clean ones, sometimes not. One day we decided to spend at day at the hotel relaxing and put up the do not disturb sign. Housekeeping called us to say we had the do not disturb sign up, when would we be leaving so they could clean our room? We told them not to worry about it, but I wonder if they call every person who has the do not disturb sign up. It kind of defeats the purpose of putting up the sign. 

The hotel has a lovely view and we found riding the metro to downtown easy. This does not overcome the overall bad attitude of the front desk and schizophrenic housekeeping.",1,2010,11,01
36,"Really Modern Hotel, Great Breakfast, Great Pool Area - Bit Far Out!","* The decor was modern and up to date with all modcons in rooms

* Lovely Crabtree & Evelyn toiletries in the bathroom

* Really nice terrace with lots of sunbeds

* Pool was lovely but not ideal for Children as there was no shallow area or fun slides

* Breakfast buffet was absolutely fantastic

* The hotel is quite far out, probably a 45 minute walk to the Ramblas, but you can get the underground which is really cheap, quick and regular. The underground is only a 5 minute walk from the hotel.

* There is a large shopping complex over the road with lots of restaurants and good shops - Zara/H&M/Primark etc...this was handy on a rainy day!!",4,2010,10,31
36,AWESOME,"Husband, daughter, son-in-law and I arrived mid-morning from Atlanta on overnight flight and were given our rooms within 45 minutes!  Upgraded as HHonors to have breakfast included + evening reception with complimentary beer, wine and tapas!  Wonderful food at breakfast and evening reception with magnifient views of sea and Barcelona.  Very friendly staff.  Rooms were clean and well appointed. Ten minutes via bus to city centre.  Close to cruise terminals.  If I would visit Barcelona again, I would definitely book the Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona.",5,2010,10,26
36,Very Nice Hotel,"We stayed there one night before a cruise leaving from the Barcelona port and had a total of 3 rooms (if staying there before a cruise, I would recommend at least 2 nights there so you can have time to enjoy the city).   The staff was very helpful and the hotel is very nice.  It is not in the center of town, but you can reach the downtown area easily by bus or Taxi.   The hop on hop off bus stops a half block down from the hotel and is a great value at 22 euros per adult.  There is also a large mall directly accross the street from the hotel where you can find just about anything you may be looking for.  There is also a supermarket there for anything  you may have forgotten.  
The hotel itself is clean, comfortable,  and well maintained.   We found breakfast to be rather expensive at almost 25 euros per person and is not worth it.  We had sandwiches and burger at the bar area in the lobby and enjoyed them, but they were also on the expensive side.   However, it is our experience that prices in Europe tend to be high particularly with the current exchange rate to dollars so this is to be expected.   
Taxis were readily available at the hotel and airport and are metered.   
Barcelon is a great city. 
Overall great hotel.   We would deffinetly return.",5,2010,10,26
36,Great Meeting Hotel,"I don't have one negative thing to say about this property... excellent service, nice size rooms and very comfortable, Staff are very friendly and accommodating. Great location, ten minute ride to Las Ramblas on the metro, shopping center across the street, two blocks from beach.",5,2010,10,25
36,Great Hotel- Location could be better,"We stayed at Hilton for free (points) so it was a great value.  Also, got upgraded to the Executive Floor so the access to the lounge was a great value.  We got snacks and wine for free which helped with the Spanish eating schedule.  The hotel is NOT near anything of interest to tourist.  That being said, it is across the street (through a huge mall) from the subway and light rail which is very easy to use and a 15 min ride to all the sites.  The hotel is huge and caters to cruises so very active.  The quality is very nice.  The staff is great and the bar is good for a quick drink (but expensive like most hotels).  The mall across the street has everything you might need and there is even a famous tapas placed called Sagurdad(?)-- famous cider house in old section-- authentic.  Views from hotel are great and the pool looked great although it was too cold to use.",4,2010,10,25
36,great and amazing hilton by the sea,"a bit far from city center (about 6 subway stations from the ramblas) right in front of the mall, room shaped stylish, staff very nice and welcoming, great view!",5,2010,10,20
36,Nice quiet rest with excellent hospitality,I stayed here for a business trip and it was a nice experience. The hotel's location is not in the center but everything in barcelona is 15 min. by car so we had no problem. The staff is super helpful and went out of their way to assist us in everything. The breakfast is great and the separate corner for elevators up the room gives it a nice touch of privacy (we were there when conferences were held and all we need was hop on the elevators and be away from the noise). The view isn't bad either. Will definitely go back again.,5,2010,10,19
36,"Mixed feeling- good rooms and fantastic view, excellent location, hospitality could be better",The location of the hotel is very good. There is the bus and taxi convinently available right outside. The tam and metro station is also nearby. Then the beach is just walking distance away. Also there is the diagonal mar commercial centre( shopping mall) right outside the hotel.  The resturant food was quite average and the staff not too hospitable.,3,2010,10,14
36,"Modern, comfortable hotel...a little outside the action","My husband and I arrived here after 5 nights in much smaller hotels with compact rooms all over Switzerland.  So when we walked into our huge room at the Hilton, it seemed extremely luxurious.  I was thrilled to get this hotel on Hotwire for $125/night since the regular rates were around $400 for our dates.  I knew it was on the outskirts of the city, but that was fine with me because it was still close to public transport.

We arrived at Barcelona airport and took a cab to the hotel, which costed 28 euros.  Check in was easy and the staff gave us a map and showed us where most of the main attractions were.  The room was very spacious, modern and clean.  The bed was a little on the hard side, which isn't my preference, but I had no trouble sleeping during the stay.  The bathroom was also large with a great tub and robes to use during our stay.  There is a great pool and patio area downstairs, which we enjoyed.  There is also a small gym next to the pool area.

The location is not in the center of the city, but it is very easy to access any other area.  The subway is a couple blocks away, about a 10 minute walk.  We used the subway frequently during our stay and had no problems getting around the city and no problems with pickpockets, which I read about before the trip.  There is also a mall across the street from the hotel, which was convenient for food and snacks if you don't want to take the subway downtown.  If you enjoy gelato, try Giovanni's in the mall on the top floor.  The gelato was delicous and I went there almost every day.

The staff at this hotel was extremely helpful.  I hadn't done too much research before going to Barcelona, so we consulted the staff daily for restaurant recommendations and directions.  They were very nice and gave us good recommendations for different types of food around the city.  Our favorite area to eat was the beach at Port Olimpic.  I can't remember the name of the restaurant where we ate, but there are a bunch of restaurants right on the beach, which were really nice and reasonably priced.

Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel.  The only drawback for some would be the location, which wasn't a problem for me.  For the price paid, I was very pleased with the Hilton and would be happy to return to this hotel if I am in Barcelona again.",5,2010,10,13
36,Good hotel but could use a touch up,"The hotel staff was great at this hotel, and it's about 2 city blocks away from the train station.  However, the rooms were definitely in need of a paint job and slight touch ups.  For the price though, I really can't complain.

Note though that if you are looking to be next to the Gothic area or downtown, this is not the place to stay.  The other Hilton Barcelona is closer to downtown.

Overall, it's a good and inexpensive hotel to stay in for the reasonable price.

Gym: has it's basics but nothing fancy
Restaurants near by: there are a few within 1 block of the hotel.  There's also a mall next door that has a food court if you're into that
Grocery store: at the bottom of the mall; great if you need to drop in for snacks or want to see what the locals eat!",3,2010,10,12
36,This is my third stay at this hotel...,"This is my third stay at this hotel.  Very convenient to convention center.  Clean, modern, efficient and helpful.  Much better than Barcelona Princess or AC Barcelona  the other trip close hotels.  Highly recommended for business travelers.  If just touting stay closer to the city center.",4,2010,10,10
36,"Impeccable service, Ultra Modern, and a Memorable visit","We stayed here for 3 days prior to our cruise out of Barcelona.  The hotel upgraded our room with our HIlton points, which included access to the executive lounge,  Breakfast every morning ( included), drinks & appies in the late afternoon/ evening.  The perfect place to do business, or holiday! From the lounge, you can sit inside or out on the patio area.  You can see for miles up and down the coast, and the sunrise/sunsets were wonderful.   Short walk to the metro that takes you right to Las Ramblas.  Service was impeccable, everyone was very friendly and welcoming.  The rooms were ultra modern in furniture design, simple but you knew you were being treated WELL!  The bed was superb.  Very comfortable, and big! We will stay here again!",5,2010,10,08
36,Expensive  place to saty,"Since it was a stay for business , the tariff was accepted. 
Otherwise the services including the breakfast even is an expensive proposition.
Staff is not very smart and helping as is seen generally in other Hilton Hotels

Rooms are cozy and amenities / facilities are good.
Hotel is not so centrally located",4,2010,09,30
36,Awesome! Simply awesome!,"This was my 2nd Hotel in Barcelona and I loved it. We had access to the club level which is stocked full of all the goodies, the room was nice and comfy the location across the street from the mall and tons of restaurants and close to the beach was absolutely perfect. Staff was great and very helpful at all times. For the money this hotel makes the most sense while visiting Barcelona.",5,2010,09,17
36,The hotel had plenty of exorbitant hidden charges and poor service.,"I stayed here with a large group (9 people for 6 nights).  The internet charges were exorbitant - €27 per 24 hours.  When settling one bill, for a guest who had stayed 6 nights, there were charges amounting to €216 for internet.  They halved it after spending nearly 10 minutes on the phone to 'swisscom'.  Another guest in my party had to check out a day earlier than planned and despite giving the hotel more than 24 hours notice I was still charged full rate for the room, even though I heard them tell another enquirer that the hotel was full so they obviously re-sold it.  Another guest in my party was arriving early off a long flight from the States, and I asked for 11am check in, I was charged full room rate for that too.  Parking is €36 per day.  The staff around the hotel are pleasant enough, but those on the front desk and in the business centre seemed used to dealing with complaints and had a toughened air about them. On the plus side the hotel was clean and modern, the room was large and it was close to the beach.  
I appreciate transparency up front  and I would not stay at this hotel again due to the difficulty in budgeting for the extras.  As a frequent business traveller I will avoid Hilton Hotels wherever possible based on this experience.",2,2010,09,17
36,Still the best,"My wife and I stayed for ten days in an executive room on the 15th floor at the end of August at this fantastic Hotel. Perfect location for the beach, mall and with easy access to the more touristy areas if you want it. Breakfast in the restaurant was excellent as were the all day refreshments in the executive lounge. The staff are so professional and helpful especially Yasmine in the Executive lounge and Edgar in Reception. Can’t wait to return next year.",5,2010,09,09
36,Nearly perfect,"I would recommend this Hotel except for its extremely high Internet connection charges € 27 per day. After I complained to the management they offered me a reduced rate of €11 which I declined. Telephone charges are equally ridiculously high starting at € 5 per minute.

The toilet is in the bathroom and does not have separate ventilation, only air-condition. Bad smells persist for a long time. Did not except that from a 5 star hotel.

The Hotel is 200 meters from the beach and very close to a metro station. Trip to the center takes 15 minutes. Pool is very nice. Did not eat at the hotel or consume any other services.",4,2010,08,27
36,Best Hilton Hotel I've ever stayed at....,"Myself and my wife recently spent a delightful week at The Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona. This hotel is the best Hilton Hotel we have ever stayed at. The food and drink may have been a little on the expensive side but we believe you get what you pay for. The service in this hotel was superb. The staff, from the top management to the housekeepers, could not be faulted. The general manager Ignacio Rodriguez was always on hand and the most visible hotel manager we have ever met. He insisted we call him 'Nacho'. On one occasion we even saw him fixing the umbrellas around the pool area. It was obvious that he also has a very good working relationship with his staff. From conversations with various staff members they all liked him also. We found Russell (who's from England) was very helpful at the concierge from suggesting restuarants to the best way to get in and out of the city. He suggested we get a T10 card which allows 10 trips on all the various transport systems. We used the bus system to get into the city, the bus stop across the road from the hotel (route 41) will take you into Placa De Catuluna. Our bedroom although just a standard room on the 13th floor was very bright and airy with a nice seaview. The kingsize bed was very comfortable.Our bed linen was changed daily and the bedroom and bathroom thoroughly cleaned. The swimming pool area was excellent. All the bar staff were so friendly and helpful and the service was superb. The freshly cooked food at the pool was also excellent. An added bonus was the new shopping mall which is directly across the street from the hotel. Although the hotel is located a little outside the city centre we found this to be an advantage. The beach is just a short walk away. Also within a short walk in the local area you will find local bars and restuarants which are all very reasonably priced. In general we found this hotel to be exceptional in every way. We will definitely be returning again when the football season starts to attend a game at Camp Nou.",5,2010,08,07
36,"Nice hotel, horrible service","Stayed at the hotel for a conference. Lovely location next to the beach and a big shopping mall.
Hotel is has nice modern rooms and nice swimming pool area.
The service at the swimming pool bar/restaurant is horrible. It took 30 minutes to get our drinks, 40 for the food and it didnt taste good..... Dry hamburger, which supposed to be; Hilton juicy burger....
We heard 5 other tables which complained as well. (Getting the wrong food and drinks, taking to long for the food, and could not split a bill in 2...)
Breakfast was just ok. The lunch was with no extra, first day, just a piece of beef the second day just a slice of beef.... Not up to a 5 star hotel standard.
Overall, nice rooms, nice location, dont eat here...",3,2010,08,05
36,Terrific,"My wife and I stayed there with our five year old son.  We booked an executive room through booking.com, which gave us access to the executive lounge, which had lots of great snacks and drinks and a terrific 15th floor terrace and was well worth the added price.  The hotel was immaculate.  The staff were terrific.  The breakfast is excellent, with a huge variety of foods.  The pool was on the second floor, with a beautiful patio area.  There is a shopping center next door with lots of food options, including a mcdonald's which our 5-year-old appreciated.  The beach is a 5 minute walk away.  We loved it.  There is no question that I would stay there again.

The internet is overpriced.  Walk across the street to the diagonal mar shopping center.  Any purchase, even a coffee, gets you a free 30 minute wifi card.",5,2010,08,04
36,Executive Level makes it a great place to stay,"conference center where I attended a conference is just down the street, so very convenient; 
across the street is a major mall, which is also quite convenient;
beach is also walkable;
staff very friendly and eager to help; 
executive level very nice, so would highly recommend; 
only downside is not really walkable to city center, but bus to city just across the street, and subway stop just a couple of blocks away; also, Internet quite expensive and not free on Executive Floor;",5,2010,08,03
36,amazing staff,The Hilton in Barcelona was geat.  the rooms were spacious and had everything one could need The conciere floor has an amazing view. Get a room facing some beach.  The staff  was very friendly and knowledgable. In a quiet part of Barcelona with an indoor mall and many restaurants next door.  Just remember you need to take a taxi to get to the tour sites!,5,2010,07,31
36,Nice location for a conferene-beach trip,"The hotel was clean. Our room was on the 5th floor, which smelled bad but we did not complain as the hotel was full and front desk always busy. The breakfast was really nice and the staff were very helpful compared to average European hotel. The pool was small but nice, but I need to mention a verry important disadvanatge in this hotel, the internet was a true rip off. 25 euros/day was too expensive for 21st century, where average hotels around the planet offer free access. Hilton, can yo hear me? Your internet was resiculuosly expensive. Location was A++.",4,2010,07,29
36,This is the best rate to book,"I haven't actually been to this hotel yet, but wanted to let you all know the best rate I found was hidden on the Hilton site. Log in as a Hilton Honours member (you can easily sign up for free on their site), go to Offers & Packages, select the Search Offers tab and type in Barcelona. This will give you several package options. The best one I found was the Discover Barcelona package, which was cheaper than any other advance pay rate (€107.50 pn), and includes breakfast, a bottle of Champagne, Barcelona City card (free public transport) and 1,000 extra points. Not sure how long this rate will be available, but found it only was available when going in as described above, it was not shown when booking it the normal way on the Hilton site.
Hope this helps, I will post a full review once I've returned.",5,2010,07,28
36,Depends upon your needs,"If seeing the major sights is your goal, book elsewhere.  We spent 5 days in the city before relocating here for 3 days prior to picking up our rental car and heading north.  We had seen all the sights and we were ready for some 'down"" time.  Check-in was smooth and my preference for free internet access as a Gold Hilton Honors member had been noted.  As an aside, many reviews ago there was a rant about a failure to provide an upgrade to a Hilton Honors member.  One has to be Gold to be upgraded.  I purposely changed my preference to free internet access and it has been honored.

As I write this review,I am sitting in room 1612 overlooking the pool deck with obstructed view of the sea due to 3 buidlings immediately in front of the hotel.  This morning we walked the beach promenade.  Beach access is less than a two block walk.  The promenade stretches for several miles south to the port.  There are walkers, runners and bikers galore. One can rent beach chairs and umbrellas from the concession stands along the beach.  The locals flock to this beach on the weekends.  Be advsied that one section of the beach is a nude beach.  Love the Europeans!  We spent the aftenoon on the hotel pool deck, which is quite large.  Towels are provided and there is a bar and outdoor dining. There is a large number of chaises.  Finding one is not a problem. Unlike many US and Mexican operations, food and beverage are not delivered outside the dining/bar area.  The pool is OK.  It is not interesting or particularly large;  a simple, tiled rectangle with a maximum depth of 1.55 meters.  Outdoor showers are located at each end of the pool.  We had lunch at the poolside dining area.  A chef grills on site.  The large hamburger seemed to be a favorite.  We had their club sandwich with a Catalonian flair.  It was very good and freshly made.  This is our only dining experience in the hotel.

A word about the hypermarket, Alcampos, in the mall across the street.  On the lowest level  of the mall is the supermarket portion of the store.  A  level above is the housewares, lawn, garden, ie. center of the store.  Each has a separate entrance.  If you need to buy a corkscrew after purchasing wine, you must leave the supermarket, enter the mall, go up a flight and enter on the second floor.  Odd to say the least.  The supermarket is gigantic.  Many guests from the hotel cross the street to buy breakfast items, bottles of water, etc.  One last piece of info.  The store accepts Visa and MasterCard only.  Carry your passport as they demand it and a copy is not accepted.  From my experience, the staff do not speak English.

The rooms are a good size.  We have a king bed, plenty of storage space and a large closet.  The bath room is decent with a separate WC that includes a bidet.  Typical for Europe, the shower is a tub shower.  I have yet to learn why the soaking tubs are so narrow here.  The selection of English speaking TV channels is very good,but the TV is a very small; flat screen.",4,2010,07,25
36,great hotel but not near tourist attractions,"This is my 2nd stay in Barcelona. Barcelona is a city where there are limited rooms on the weekends so if you are planning a trip with children I suggest that you book your family rooms well in advance. I stayed here 1 night with my extended family of 10 -children ages 7-10 prior to a cruise and really enjoyed our stay. However, this hotel is not near the main tourist attractions so you have to take the bus or metro. 
This is a lovely hotel not far from the beach and right across from one of the nicest malls in Barcelona. There is a metro & bus service 2 blocks away along the Diagonal Avenue. The beach is close enough to walk to and there are several interesting parks along the way.  This entire area is being developed and seems to be the ""new Barcelona"".  We used Hitlon rewards points and were able to upgrade to larger rooms which included the business lounge and free snacks & breakfast. Otherwise breakfast was quite expensive and if I had to pay for breakfast, I'd go across the street to the mall which had several nice restaurants & a grocery store (lower level).  The rooms were clean and beds comfortable. Check in and out was fast and the employees were very friendly and helpful. The staff in fact was exceptional. This is not the cheapest hotel in the area but probably one of the nicest. I would stay here again. 
bbeerbower",4,2010,07,23
36,Nice hotel but too far from the action,"I stayed for one night at this hotel on my way out of the city - I flew in and had to fly back out the next morning.  I previously stayed in Barcelona twice but had some hotel points to burn and figured for one night it would be fine.  It was - staff was lovely - room was great, nice views, nice pool, not too far from the Metro but not close to the heart of Barcelona where you would want to be.  If you have unlimited taxi fare and want a nice hotel this might work for you.  Otherwise I'd stayed closer to the Barri Gothic if you can.",4,2010,07,22
36,Great hotel if you want to be away from the crowds,"We stayed 3 nights on an award stay and upgraded to a junior suite. After a long vacation throughout the Mediterranean we wanted a hotel to decompress before heading home. This worked well for us. The hotel is in good shape, the service was good, and the pool was a nice place to relax in the afternoons. As mentioned elsewhere, this is not in the center of Barcelona so a taxi or metro ride is needed to get to the sights. This was how we wanted it, but if you want to do sight-seeing or hit restaurants within walking distance of a hotel, this will not work for you. The only thing nearby is a shopping mall with some ok restaurants.",5,2010,07,20
36,Not the place to stay if you want to experience Barcelona.,"Typical Hilton; nicely appointed, expensive food, lots of business travelers.  If you hope to enjoy the excitement and lifestyle of Barcelona, this is not the place to stay.  Very removed from all the splendor of the city.",4,2010,07,11
36,"Lovely hotel, typical of Hilton chain","Spent 5 nights here with my teenage daughter. Good executive lounge but not as good as the Sorrento Palace. Spacious room with extemely comfortable beds. Loved the Diagonal Mar shopping centre accross the road. Lots of places to eat, and a supermarket. Fantastic discounts in all the shops so got some bargains, always good!  Metro very easy to get about the city, and good value with T10 ticket. Would also recommend the Tourist bus - Green route passes hotel. Get the two day ticket as there is too much to see in just one day.",5,2010,07,10
36,very nice hotel,"We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights during out trip to Barcelona. We were upgraded to executive floor and the room was very nicely furnished and good size. Maybe it was the best hilton hotels room that i have ever stayed so far. The executive lounge was very nice as well. The employees were very friendly and helpful. The location is not exactly the best if you are tourist but we knew that when we booked the hotel and the metro is 5-10 mins walk. The only negative thing was that the internet was very expensive and you have to pay for the computer even in the executive lounge. on the other hand - the hotel is right next to the shopping mall and there is a wifi for free. 
When we came home i got an email from somebody from a hotel that they hope i enjoyed stayed and they will see me back soon - very sweet.",5,2010,07,10
36,good but not central,"i've spent a week in spain and few different hotels during that week. Hilton Diagonal Mar, was in means of property, one of the best. personal opinion it is not ideally located if you are looking for a central location or places on your footstep however it is not far as well. a taxi will take you anywhere within 15 minutes. hotel itself is beautiful, spacious and the service is excellent. 
when i go back, i'll be happy to spend few days there with stunning sea view and the pool terrace,",5,2010,06,30
36,Good for conference & events,usual Hilton service. Nothing new in the service. The meeting rooms and service are good.,4,2010,06,19
36,Excellent Hotel,"We stayed at this hotel pre cruise and for a few days post cruise. What a beautiful property. The pool was gorgeous. The surrounding pool area was huge and relaxing. This might be my favorite. It wasn't closed in like many hotel pools with people sitting around looking at each other. If you wanted privacy or had loud kids (me) you could get away. The rooms were beautiful and spacious. The beds were heavenly!! That was some of the best sleep I've had in a hotel. What a bed!! The staff was very helpful. I even went to the pool grill to order a meal and the guy behind the bar said they were closing in 5 minutes but he would have the cook stay late and make something for myself and my  three kids. The guy ended up staying about 1/2 hour later. The girl at check in was also helpful. The staff in the main restaurant where we ate for breakfast were so nice and really helped me with my Spanish. The location is okay. The mall across the way makes up for it but next time it would be nice to be near all the action. However, for cruises it was a good option as it was close to the peir. We had a great time and loved this hotel and for some reason I really loved that pool area!!",5,2010,06,19
36,Fabulous hotel with A/C that will satisfy the most discriminating American traveler,"This was our second stay at the Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona (2008 and 2010).  What can I say, this is the most beautiful hotel with a staff that is top notch!  We stayed in room #1920.  It was difficult to sleep at night because I wanted to sit by the huge picture window that had a fantastic view of La Sagrada Familia!  We could also see the sparkling Mediterranean Sea as well.  Each guest room has its own A/C system that can be set to your comfort level.  The bathroom was equally as gorgeous as the room.

This hotel is across the street from a great shopping mall.  It is not located in the Old Town, but who cares?  The metro station is a few short blocks away.  Barcelona's subway system is fabulous and this hotel is WONDERFUL!!!!!

This Hilton hotel is the BEST Hilton in Barcelona.  There is NO comparison between the 2 hotels.  Trust me, we stayed at both hotels on this trip.",5,2010,06,17
36,A great team of people!,"An excellent facility made better by the team of people staffing the hotel. We made it a point to reach out to the hotel staff prior to arrival to introduce ourselves and describe the purpose of our trip. As a result of seeking to engage the staff we found a warm welcoming attitude reflected back to us. We suggest you take a similar initiative and make a point of ""listening to learn"" from what the staff has to offer to enrich your visit to Barcelona. Keep in mind the hotel is located 10 minutes by subway away from the main tourists areas. However, the facility is directly across from a shopping mall and a very short walk to the beach. The hotel is well maintained and all services were promptly provided. The staff is a mix of nationalities; all who welcomed the opportunity to discuss their homelands and also what they have learned during their stay in Barcelona. By taking advantage of the staff's knowledge we were lead to several places which normally would not have been considered. Take the time to appreciate their work (this means saying ""Gracias!"" not just tipping), be welcoming and ask for their help; as this is a group of people who are lead by a gentleman intent upon helping everyone have an enjoyable experience.",5,2010,06,13
36,High standards,"This hotel is recent enough to still feel new, but already has very well trained staff, and is an excellent example of the new breed of upscale Hiltons.

I was given a stylish and spacious sea view executive room, with the well thought-out details (e.g. closet lighting which illuminates the entire inside of the safe)  which are one advantage of belonging to a large hotel chain. Excellent, expansive bathroom as well.

The executive lounge is roomy and offers some very tasty tapas in the evening.

The hotel's location is not very central, but the large shopping mall across the street has everything one could need, and public transportation is nearby. Beware the advice posted on various sites about taking the train to/from the airport, as ongoing construction work has the routing changing frequently, and causes unannounced delays.

Prices for this hotel vary widely depending on season and occupancy. In the off-season, this is a great deal, with a price-quality ratio superior to its more central competition.",5,2010,06,09
36,"Nice hotel, average location, poor service","This Hilton is quite a nice property with a nice outdoor pool, excellent gym, and a view of the ocean.  It is unfortunately quite far from everything being outside the city centre and we found taxis were the only real option.  One day we walked along the beaches into the centre of Barcelona which was a pleasant walk but took a long time.

The Internet in this hotel is an absolute disgrace, plain and simple.  €25 per night for a bandwidth-throttled connection?  We ended up paying more for the Business Connection which was allegedly unlimited.  At almost €30 per night this is really shocking.  Provided by Swisscom I believe, so if you can arrange a roaming agreement with them before you travel I'd advise this.  There is absolutely no free internet anywhere we could find, including in the Executive Lounge.  There are 2 PCs in the lounge but again you have to pay to use these - shockingly.

The canapés in the lounge in the evening were poor.  There was 1 white wine, 1 red, some cava and beers and soft drinks.  The minibar was of course obscenely priced and we didn't order from room service.  There is a mall across the road with a very large supermarket where you can buy drinks etc.

Service again lets a hotel down.  In the case of this hotel I got the impression from staff that they were incredulous that we dared to ask any questions or requests and would often laugh when we asked questions on check-in etc.  The concierge was no real use - having requested she book us a restaurant by the water, with good food being more important than price, we were sent to La Gavina (I have also reviewed) which was the worst restaurant we've been to in years.  I can only assume they have an arrangement which overrides any need to care for customers' needs.

The breakfast was 'just ok'.  The restaurant was not busy at all (3 tables) and had no atmosphere.  The staff however seemed pressured and unfriendly.  We are entitled to breakfast as we are Diamond VIP HHonors members, and were told we could have it in the Executive Lounge.  In every other Hilton we've had the right to choose whether you want to eat here or in the restaurant, but in this property we actually had to fight to be able to choose which just was not good customer service.

Another benefit of HHonors status is the upgrade at check-in.  Even although the hotel was very empty, we were given the bare minimum upgrade to a standard room on the Executive Floor.  When we asked if there were Superior Rooms available we were told we'd have to pay €25 extra per night for that.  Again, this sort of attitude isn't going to leave a good impression on valued customers and I've never seen this attitude in other Hiltons.  Not a great property for upgrades!

If you can get a room cheaply and don't want to pay for any extras, and don't mind being way out of the city, then this is a nice hotel.",3,2010,05,28
36,Out of the Way but Worth It,"There are two Hiltons in Barcelona.  The Diagonal Mar is further out from all the action, but so close to the Mediterranean that I booked it hoping for an upgrade due to our Gold status iwth Hilton.  Bless them, they came through- a room on the 21st floor with a view of the sea, and Executive Lounge access.  This was on a reward stay too, which is typical of how well the European Hiltons treat their HHonors members.

The hotel is in a district with a large convention center and a giant mall.  The mall across the street from the hotel, is actually a very good feature- it even has a grocery store (Al Campo) with a full liquor selection, a lot of franchises if you want quick but not distinguished food (Starbucks and McD's are good for free Wi-Fi to circumvent Hilton's exorbitant Internet charges) as well as some better restaurants.  I even bought some Majorca pearl earrings at an Internet kiosk in the mall, figuring the place was likely to be reputable if not the cheapest around.  It's a short walk to a beach on the Mediterranean, a walk I took every day while my husband got some rest.

Our room was clean, comfortable and a good size and the view was heavenly.  We didn't try the bar, restaurant or Fitness Center.  Nor did I try the outdoor pool, although it looked beautiful and was huge.  This was mid-May and too cold for a swim.  I somehow forgot to get a picture of the actual room; I hope you can get an idea of the room size/layout from other reviews.

The lounge provided a good selection of food at breakfast and from 6 to 8:30 PM, as well as afternoon tea.  We were never there for the latter, but thoroughly enjoyed the lounge.  Both breakfast and evening snacks were substantial and varied enough to constitute a light meal.

My only complaint is the Internet rates, as usual.  I was traveling with a Blackberry and an iPod Touch and like to get a full-size keyboard once in awhile.  (The Blackberry also has limited access to some sites since my employer supplied it.)  Free Wi-Fi was not available at all- not in the lobby or the lounge.  The best they could do was the computers in the lounge, which were 35 Euro cents per minute, and we wouldn't have had that option if we hadn't had lounge access.  So, I did run up a bill of about 40 Euros for Internet service during our stay but spent most of my on-line time at Starbucks across the street with the iPod, or on the Blackberry.  Having just come from a hotel in Madrid that cost less and included Free Wi-Fi, I don't see why Hilton has to use such an expensive service and pass it on to the customers.

Overall, though, we loved this hotel.  In our case, even though we needed to use the subway to get where we were going for sightseeing, we loved the seaside location.",5,2010,05,22
36,"Modern, Smart, Great","This has been the second time i have stayed at the Hilton Diagonal Mar and it was simply great.
Barcelona is a great city with hundres of people walking around, cars... and it is a pleasure to find some places like this hotel where you can relax, enjoy the facilities and be still in the city just a few metro stops away from the city centre.
The building is very modern, rooms are spacious and restaurant for breakfast was good.
This time weather was great so we had the chance to use the simming pool, actually the part of the hotel. We really enjoyed drinking and getting tanned by the pool with the nice staff taking care of us. They gave us flip flops, they were quick in delivering what we ordered... and always with a big smile. By the way, amazing music down there, it puts you in a really good mood!
We got nice tips from Reception stuff regarding restaurants. Finally a hotel sends people to local restaurants and not the places they get commission from.
I will definately go back next time. I loved the place.",5,2010,05,20
36,Disgrace to Hilton Brand,"Walked into a room that was a mess (oops, staff did not clean it yet) - got moved to another room.
In room # 2 TV set did not work (half of the screen is blacked out), after 1hour of waiting for 
hotel technician to show up to fix it - we got moved to yet another room. 
In room # 3 - snack items are missing in the mini bar under TV set. 
After talking to a manager about mini-bar being not refilled after previous guest and overall disappointment , manager says : ""Don't worry about it.And we are Sorry- this is all I can do.""
Internet service is listed as included in advertisement @ Hilton site, but if you want to use internet in room - be ready to shell out 24 Euros per day. 
Even the ""V.I.P."" lounge on 15th floor offers internet access ONLY if I'd allow them to bill my room at 0.34 Euro PER MINUTE ! 
And the room we stayed in was 500 Euros per night, 21st floor.
C'mon people, even McDonalds offers internet free of charge these days !
I would look into this particular operation if I was HILTON exec. 
Disgrace to Hilton Brand.

Hilton  Diagonal Mar Barcelona (Barcelona, Spain)",1,2010,05,19
36,Not the best location for a fabulous hotel,"We stayed at the Hilton Diagonal Mar 2 nights pre-cruise using time-share exchange points.  We knew in advance that it wasn't close to all the ""action"", but planned accordingly.

Access: we opted for taking the Renfe train from the airport to Passeig de Gracia, then transferring to the Yellow Metro line 3 to the Maresme Forum stop.  The Hilton is located just across the street from the largest shopping mall in Barcelona at this stop.  We purchased a T-10 ticket that covered our transit here plus exploring the city for only 7.85 Euro.  The ticket can be shared between any number of people for a total of 10 trips.

Rooms: FANTASTIC!  One of the nicest places we've ever stayed.  We got a corner room on the 13th floor with views overlooking the mall, amusement part and the Mediterranean.  Comfortable beds, good lighting, very chic bathroom, stylish decor.

Value:  Wouldn't dream of staying here if we had to actually pay the going nightly rate.  The hotel offered a breakfast buffet for 24.5 Euro/person - ridiculous!  It took some searching to find a staff member who was willing to suggest an alternate restaurant in the vicinity, but we found ""Man-go"" just a block away for a delightful breakfast for just 10.5 Euros for the 2 of us.

As it was raining on the morning of our departure, we took a cab to the cruise port for a total cost of 15 Euro, including our luggage.",4,2010,05,17
36,Nothing to get excited about in this most exciting of cities.,"We had three nights in this hotel- all taken care of by the organisers of our conference.  Barcelona is such an amazing city.  Vibrant.  It has a feel so distinct, it's sharper than even more beautiful cities like say, Paris.  But to stay in this hotel, you feel nothing.  A complete lack of soul and charm are common to both the property and the area it is located in.  Luckily it was my second trip to Barcelona so after our three complimentary nights we moved to the much, much cheaper and incomparable Lloret Hotel on the top end of the Ramblas.  (Also reviewed, twice in three and a half years!)  That is what you  go to Barcelona for.  Atmosphere.  And you will not get it at the Hilton.  
That said we were very comfortable here.  The staff is politely efficient and the breakfast was excellent.  This is a business hotel, you can't holiday here in the real sense of the word.  The Mercedes and Renault F1 teams were staying here since it was over the GP weekend.  Even that didn't spice it up for us!!",3,2010,05,16
36,Beautiful hotel in Barcelona,"Beautiful, well appointed Hilton hotel.  Although the hotel was quite busy with an ongoing convention, the English-speaking staff was readily available and very helpful for our first (and very wet) visit to the city.  An upgrade for HHonors VIP (Diamond)  to the executive floor provided access to the beautiful executive lounge on the 15th floor.  From the lounge balcony you stare out to the beautiful Mediterranean Sea or tour the city with binoculars.",5,2010,05,13
36,Great hotel in a great tourist city,"A new modern hotel in a growing area about 3½ miles from the tourist areas, but easily accessible by the #4 Metro line about 1/4 mile from the hotel.  Very nice, modern hotel with a great lounge and a nice, albeit expensive, restaurant.  Got a good rate by booking 3 months in advance on a pre-paid rate. Have Hilton Honors elite privileges, so upgraded to a nice ocean view room (although there was a lot of construction on the beach area by the hotel).  Great city view from the lounge.  Upscale amenities in room.  Good concierge service.  Only nearby restaurants are in the Diagonal Mar shopping mall across the street; they are nice, but not upscale, and also have the usual American fast-food joints.  Beach is close, but it was too cold to go there in April.",5,2010,05,05
36,Luxury hotel but out of town,"We had a wonderful stay in May in this luxury Hilton hotel. It's right by Mar Bella beach and opposite Diagonal shopping mall (useful for supermarket supplies and cheap restaurants) and a 5 min walk to the metro. 

As Diamond members we got upgraded to a 21st floor seaview executive room which was lovely, with all mod cons and a nice style about it. The executive lounge offered a nice breakfast and good views, with computers for use and concierge services. Very good. Would also recommend their limo service to the airport for 50 euros, only 12 more than the standard cab fare, with a booked collection time, smart driver and a nice Mercedes. 

Hotel had a very luxurious feel, we didn't get to use the pool because the weather was awful, but it sat in a beautifully landscaped area

Only drawback I think is location - a 20-30 minute metro ride from downtown, but if you want a luxury hotel it's around 60% of the price of the des Arts or W more in the city centre, and in a nice local area without the tourist hoardes of Las Ramblas, but with the sandy beaches. Would recommend.",5,2010,05,05
36,A wonderful hotel!,"We stayed in this hotel in December of 2008. It is truly a wonderful hotel. The location is very convenient 7 minute walk to the metro, and across the street from a mall -- convenient if you have kids. The staff was very friendly and very helpful.
Will stay there again in a heartbeat!",5,2010,05,04
36,paradise of gaudi,"perfect executive lounge service...perfect spot in the city...but when you take a taxi in front of it drivers charge you with night shift rate whether it is night or day...and when you try to warn them they say ""take it or leave it""..  :-/",4,2010,05,01
36,fantastic hotel,"Chris from Hornchurch.

Although a little way out from the mainstream,its a quiet location and a lovely beachside walk to the marina and restaurants.Tourist bus stop is 200 metres away,Shopping mall over the road.Staff are so friendly and helpful,breakfast is very good and the pool terrace
is the place to chill out after a long walk.Rooms were very comfortable we had a sea view,There is building work being carried out nearby , but could not hear any noise once in the rooms. great hotel ,would love to go back.",5,2010,04,26
36,excellent!,"Even though this location is not right in the tourist area, we liked it very much!..Right on the beaches and you can walk all along  to the main port and Barcelonetta.  Great shopping center across the street for snacks and internet.  Metro there, too.
Staff was exceptional.  Fine , warm welcoming and we got little treats throughout our stay that made us feel cared for and about.  Wonderful terrrance by the pool.  So friendly, yet professional.  Rooms are great with all the comforts.  Do ask to have your window opened.  Just sign a waiver form and the maids will make sure that it stays open.  We can't stand hotel rooms that don't have windows that open.  The food is suprisingly good here,too.  The front desk staff takes time to answer any questions.  Take the upgrade to the exec., level and you are in for a real treat and I think it is good value.  Breakfast, cakes, and fine tapas in the eve. with drinks availiable all day....and that can save a bundle if you are paying for that.  The view from the exec. lounge is awesome!

We haven't stayed at a hotel for a very long time that was so welcoming, so caring and fun!  We were there during the Iceland volcano eruption and the staff handled the stranded guests with true grace, professionalism and care.
Cute little fitness room...I do wish that they would turn the cardio machines to face the windows and not the mirrors!  Gee, that's about my only complaint!",5,2010,04,22
36,"Although far from center, the hotel was wonderful","We stayed at this hotel last summer. 

The negatives:
 We had requested a no smoking room.  The original room they gave us was a  lovely corner room but it smelled like smoke.  When we went down to see if we could switch  they offered us another room but it wasn't as nice.  So we stayed in our original room and asked them to open our windows and we let the room air out for the day. It made a difference and for the next 6 nights we were extremely comfortable.  

The hotel is not in the center and after a full day of sightseeing, it can be tiring to resort to the very hot subway or expensive to take cabs everywhere.

Internet access was very expensive.

The positives:
There is a big shopping center across the street with a suburban supermarket.   It was fun buying groceries in another country.  We had breakfast in our room every morning and stockpiled bottled water.  We were able to save a lot of money this way.

Also, there was a cafe in the mall and McDonalds which had free wifi if you bought something.  We never went to McDonalds but the cafe inside the mall was nice.
Only a few blocks from the sea and close to all the seaside restaurants which was a lot of fun to go to.
The hotel has a very nice outdoor pool which was relaxing after sightseeing.
The reception/concierge people were extremely nice and very helpful.  
The bathroom was clean and the bed was comfortable.  
There is a subway stop nearby.

Something you may not know:    Remember to check your bill!  If you move something in the refridgerator there is a sensor and it thinks you are eating it so it will show up on your bill.  Just let the front desk know and they will take care of it.  

We really did enjoy our stay this hotel.  :-)

Suggestions:
Enforce no smoking
Keep the pool open an hour later.  Dinner is so late in Barcelona and the few times we went to the pool  we had to plan it because of how early it closed.  (The first time we tried but it was closed)  It would have been amazing if we had that extra hour.

As far as value goes, we used Hilton Honor Points so we were extremely satisfied.
As far as check marks below, I would have checked tasteful and comfortable but they weren't options.",4,2010,04,21
36,Definitely Recommend,"Just back from Barcelona, and whilst the weather was not great, our stay at the Hilton Diagonal Mar was a definite highlight of the trip. Staff friendly and competent. Room (just a standard one with a sea view) was lovely, very good size and all amenities. Breakfast excellent (in the regular, not executive level), the shopping centre across the road a definite plus. The tram and metro are a short walk away and bring you right into the centre or to the ports. If you like to be at the heart of things, then Diagonal Mar is probably not for you as there is not much nightlife around. But if you like a relaxing, easy, no hassle stay in elegant and very pretty and clean surroundings close to the sea then it is. Completely second the internet rates, absolutely disgracefully expensive. Although it did mean I got a complete break from work...",5,2010,04,09
36,Great Hotel!  Almost Perfect!,"We stayed at the Barcelona Diagonal Mar Hilton for 5 nights.  It's a great hotel.  Here are the highlights:

+ Great friendly staff that speaks English well and eager to help.
+ The room is a nice size for European standards and is modern and clean
+ The bathroom is great with a seperate shower from the bathtub and is modern and clean.
+ Although some have reviewed that the location is not great- I disagree.  It's 2 miles from the city center but still feels much a like its in the city.  The city center is a quick subway ride away.  It is one block away from the beach.
+ The mall across the street is convenient as it has a nice grocery store and a few decent restaurants.

I just have a  few suggestions that would have made this hotel stay perfect.  They are:
+ The Internet is way too expensive.  They charge 27 euros ($40 USD) a day!  I have never paid so much for internet in NYC, Hong Kong, Paris, London, etc!  Internet should be free but if you do charge- it should be $10 to $15.  It's shockingly expensive!
+ The pool beautiful but it is ICE cold.  I like cold pools- but it is so cold, you can not swim.  I suggest they heat it during the non-summer months
+ Also- since they advertise the hotel as being next to the beach- I think the hotel should offer beach towels to their guests.  That would be a really nice extra.",5,2010,04,08
36,Nice hotel but a distance from the centre,This hotel is nice but very far out from the centre of things - When originally booking it - It didn't seem too far out on the maps and I liked the idea of being by the sea but if I were to return I would definitely stay in town - would only recommend if you are travelling on business,3,2010,03,31
36,Great hotel with excellent service!,"We have spent a weekend at Hilton Diagonal Mar in Barcelona and found the hotel absolutely excellent. The hotel is like 15-20 minutes away from the city center (there is an underground station nearby),in a brand new,very modern style district,one block away from the Mediterranean,one can see some pretty nice and interestingly shaped high rises around. 

We got one of the junior suites with fantastic sea view,separated seating and working area,huge bathroom,all the necessary amenities expected from Hilton and - it is quite important - comfortable beds. We found the hotel very calm and peaceful - well,in the summer high season it may be less so but still a pretty decently organized one. 

The hotel staff are very helpful,polite,always on hand,when the guest needs an advice or has any kind of request. 

The breakfast is very extensive,with some local choices included,everything was absolutely fresh and had very good taste.  If You stay on executive floors or have a Hilton Honors gold or diamond card,You also get access to the beautiful lounge,they offer breakfast,pastries and cookies for tea time and canapes,snacks and sandwiches in the evening. You can sample here some very good Spanish (or Catalan) wine,Cava,along with spirits,soft drinks  and tea,coffee. The lounge has a pretty restful feeling,we liked to be there even just to look around. It has a great round-going balcony too,in summer one can enjoy the sea breeze. 

I really would suggest everyone to stay at the Hilton Diagonal Mar,while in Barcelona!",5,2010,03,28
36,Very poorly trained staff,"I was accompanying my mother who attended a medical conference hosted by Hilton. We had two unfortunate incidents which completely ruined the whole impression of our stay in the hotel. First of all, the conference medical documents were stolen from my mother. When she returned from the conference to her room and tried to open the door, the key card was not working. So she left the pack of documents under the door and rushed to the reception to check the key card. When she was back in five-ten minutes, the documents were gone. With the cleaning staff being on duty at the corridor at that time, still no one admitted seeing anything. When we contacted the reception regarding this, the hotel staff said that they would check, but indicated outright that there was very little they could do about it. As a result, the documents were left missing and the hotel staff was not able to assist us effectively in this situation. Secondly and very surprisingly for a hotel of the level like this, the hotel staff was reluctant to return the security deposit. The hotel employs a policy of taking a security deposit in cash at the check-in which is supposed to be returned to the guest at the check-out. We were checking out at 4 a.m. and my mother handed over the key cards to the reception. After checking the use of extras, the reception staff simply wished us a good flight back home and did not say a word about the security deposit. We were about to board the bus for the airport, when we remembered about the security deposit and I returned to the hotel reception. Upon my demand, I was returned the security deposit. It is hard to believe that the hotel system does not automatically indicate that the security deposit was taken and needs to be returned. We were tremendously disappointed with the way we had to remind and demand the return of the security deposit. The staff is very poorly trained in this hotel.",2,2010,03,23
36,If you want to see the city - don't stay here!,"I have been to Barcelona 10+ times (mainly for work) & I don't even like staying at this hotel for work.  If room quality is all you care about then it is a good pick (Hilton Barcelona has much smaller rooms - although closer to town & yes near another large mall) -- If you like chains I would recommend the Sofitel first (near everything you want to see) or even the W (which is on the port a little past town) --- Barcelona is full of great boutique hotels too, so this is definitely a place to consider expanding your horizons past the Hilton.",3,2010,03,17
36,"High on looks, less on function","Upgraded to a top floor room, with access to the executive floor.  The bathroom looked great, but the shower door leaked so after a shower you stepped into a large puddle of water.  And the first morning there was no hot water, so no shower or shaving - did not expect that at all!  The bed was comfortable, and we did get one complimentary water bottle each day; lighting in the room was good.  Views of the waterfront were great, and the hotel location for us was fine; enjoyed the tram and metro close by to get you anywhere quickly, and the mall with the foodcourt across the street.  Didn't use their internet; way too expensive and the mall across the street offers it for free.  Executive floor was good offering breakfast, and then small snacks, fresh fruit, and drinks throughout the day.  Overall the stay there was very good; but it seems they put more effort into making the room look good in a photo, and place less effort on functionality.  They did try to overcharge me handsomely at check-out, but they were very pleasant about correcting the billing issue.",4,2010,03,16
36,Way overpriced and poorly located,"This hotel is located on the edge of Barcelona beside a very large modern shopping mall - not what you would travel to Spain for. To get anywhere to see the sites you need to take transportation. The Metro is within walking distance.

The hotel seems to have its hands in your pockets for everything you might want. Internet runs up to 27 euros for 24 hours. The breakfast buffet  is quite comprehensive but very expensive if not included in your hotel price.

The rooms are large and well furnished but our door frame was significantly scratched up as were others on our floors. It looked like there had been some past break-ins or attempts with no effort to fix the damage done.

If you are on an expense account and required to stay here then so be it. If you want to see Barcelona and are paying your own way this is NOT the place to be.",1,2010,03,03
36,"5+ star hotel, great hotel in Barcelona","I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights.  they gave us a room at 19th floor.  The view was amazing.  The staffs were very nice.  I am a Hilton Gold member,so I am a picky traveler.  this hotel was one of the best Hilton I stayed.  In fact, I stayed 4 Hilton hotels (Madird, Barcelona, Toledo, and Valencia) in Spain, and they are all nice (5 star).  I would recommend this hotle to anyone.  the parking is a bit expensive, but you can park outside for free and they are safe.  In any case, this was so nice that we wanted to stay longer.  Great hotel.",5,2010,02,22
36,Great Hotel With A Few Warts,"The Hilton is rated five stars, but our ""Upgraded"" room was looking a bit small and weathered. We had electrical plugs falling out of the wall at the desk. 

We also found its prices to be stratospheric. The $35/Day price for internet kind of pushed us over the top (we found about half the hotel each night across the street at McDonalds using its free internet). The beds are very comfortable. The rooms were quiet. The excutive lounge is very nice. It is nowhere near the sightseeing area, so you need to take the Metro, which is close by. You do have walk through some dodgy housing to get to it. The mall across the street saves the day for quick budget priced meals.

I'm sure it is very nice in summer with the beach so close by.",4,2010,02,19

This money machine of a hotel charges 27 Euros for daily internet and there was no free zone anywhere in the hotel.

36,lovely hotel and friendly staff. location is FANTASTIC,"we went on a cruise last april and this was the nearest hotel to the port.
it's an amazing hotel. just beautiful.
our room was clean, large and comfortable.
the bathroom was lovely as well.
right across the road is a HUGE mall that has a MASSIVE supermarket and loads of shops (extremely reasonable prices). the supermarket was brilliant. we stocked up on drinks and food instead of paying the high prices in the hotel.
the staff were very friendly. 
if we ever visit barcelona again, we'll definitely stay in this hotel. the location is superb and perfect. 
there's also a beach near by but it looked fairly industrial from my son's room. but it was raining at the time and we only saw a tiny part of the beach. we didn't bother to check it (due to the weather obviously).

i'd recommend going for the full breakfast! it's FANTASTIC! the best i've seen.
waffles, hashbrowns, beans, toast (that you toast yourself. variety of bread to choose from), fruit (brilliant fruit bar), vegetables, eggs, freshly squeezed juice, cereals, everything.
fantastic quality. i'm a vegetarian and couldn't decide what to choose! It was that good! went back for seconds! it was the perfect way to kick start the day!
quiet as well. 

we asked the staff to book us a taxi suitable for our large family. 
the brilliant thing was we were given a people carrier. the negative, the driver charged us a fortune (apparently for our luggage?).
so i'd recommend asking the staff roughly how much it would cost to get to your destination before getting in a taxi. 
then you can always threaten the driver you'll take his number plate and report him to the police. we would have done the same if we knew 100% we were being scammed.",5,2010,02,04
36,Little overpriced and oddly shaped rooms,"The room I had on the 4. floor was very oddly shaped so much of the space was just an empty hall area and the room itself not that big. The bathroom was very big with separate showerstall and bathtub. The shower stall had a design flaw so when you used the shower, you could not avoid leaving a pool of water outside the stall.
The breakfast was OK but not compared to the price of the room (€240) not particularily interesting.
The restaurant had good food and very good service.",3,2010,02,03

Service in the Pistachio Bar was beyond superb, the bartender was quite obviously looking for tips, but he looked after us supremely well.

36,Lovely Staff Comfortable Bedroom Excellent Hotel,"Hilton Diagona Mar - Barcelona 21st December 2009

We booked this hotel using our Hilton Points as a stay prior to a Christmas and New Year cruise from Barcelona. By the time we arrived at the hotel, it was around 7.30pm, there were no porters available, so we brought our luggage up ourselves to reception. Check in was smooth and we were allocated an upgraded room on the 26th floor. The room was light and airy with a king bed and nice furnishings. Shortly after we booked, we were contacted by the hotel to advise that their executive lounge would be closed for refurbishment, however they were happy to offer us free internet use and vouchers for free drinks at the lounge bar. We were advised that our luggage would be brought up to our room shortly. Indeed about 10 minutes later the porter arrived with our luggage. He apologised that he was not outside to meet us as he had taken a short break. It was nice of him to apologise. Once settled, we went downstairs for a drink and met an American couple who were also taking a cruise the next day, although on a different ship from us. We were given a couple of drinks vouchers when we checked in and I offered these to the barman when I went to the bar. He said that he would take care of that later and that he would brink our drinks over. This is how the evening continued. We sat with the American couple chatting for a very pleasant couple of hours during which time the barman kept bringing over drinks. About 11pm we decided to go to bed, I gave the barman 10 Euro and asked if he wanted our vouchers, he thanked me for the tip and said, he would take care of everything. We let the vouchers on the table and went to bed very happy. We had a great nights sleep, the bed was comfortable and the a/c worked fine. Breakfast was very good indeed. Staff were very friendly and efficient and the choice of food was excellent, all the usual items were there, along with several Spanish dishes. After breakfast, we went back to our room and packed as were were booked for one more night in another hotel before our cruise on 23rd Dec. We called down for a porter and one arrived quickly and took our luggage to the lobby. We went down and chcked out. Again everything went smoothly. The porter called us a cab and loaded our luggage into the boot for us, I gave hime something  his trouble and we went on our way. We enjoyed our short stay at this hotel and we are looking forward to going back in May 2010 for 2 nights. 10/10
There is a lovely shopping mall across the road from the Hotel You have loads of restaurants bars shops etc",4,2010,01,15
36,"Great hotel, friendly service, nice rooms","The hotel is very modern. Booked a Discover Barcelona package (room, breakfast, barcelona card and one bottle of champagne) in a standard king room at the rate of 154 Euro per night. The room is 30 sqm approx. which is a nice size, quite modern furnishings but warm colors. Had a sea view which was nice, even if hotel overlooks very modern buildings. Bed is very confortable. In addition to the bed there's a nice armchair with a small table, desk with office chair, flat tv, coffee e tea machine, safe. Bathroom is really good too, single sink but separate shower and bathtub. Bathrobes are provided as well.
Service at the hotel is very friendly, they really make the best to let you feel welcomed and we really appreciated that.
The only minor thing is location: it takes approx. 15 minutes by subway to get to the city center, which for me is acceptable anyway.
Directly opposite the hotel there's a very big shopping mall with a good selection of restaurants: nothing fancy but had good dinners both at Sagardi and Casa del Pescado.
There's also a plethora of cafes including Starbucks and Mc Cafe (with free wi-fi!), so if you don't have breakfast included you can just have it there, though I would recommend having breakfast at the hotel since the breafast buffet had practically everything.
All considered I would definitely return to this hotel. The hotel has all facilities of a 5 star hotel and the service is professional but still friendly and not pretentious at all.
I would rate it 4 1/2.",4,2010,01,06
36,Excellent Location,"The Hilton was great!  Only about a two block walk to the beach and right across the street from a mall so we could pick up milk, cereal, etc. for our young son.  Very helpful and friendly staff as well.  Decent pool.  Good restaurant with nice wine options.",5,2009,12,29
36,Extra mile-- repeatedly,"Lovely, bright, fresh conference hotel near convention center-- but a 8 - 10 euro cab ride from sights and town center-- whose staff repeatedly went beyond the call of duty.  MAde the trip all the better and enjoyable",5,2009,12,18
36,We Reccomend this hotel!,"Even though I seen one very negative review, we were glad to have stayed here.  While out in the newer surburbs, we liked the location as it afforded a look at a greater part of the city than if we had stayed in the center city.  A very nice tram line stopped at the big mall across the street from the hotel and connected to the Metro.  Also there was a Metro stop about 1/2 block the other side of the tram stop.  Don't be shy about using the Metro (look into day or multi day tickets) the public transport is safe, fast and excellent!  We traveled all the way from the airport via train and the Metro to the hotel.  A word of caution - be prepared to do some walking and carrying luggage up and down stairways as the central Metro stations have very few elevators or escalators!  Back to the hotel -- we found the staff very helpful and friendly.  The hotel rooms are modern in style, quite nice, and the seaside rooms offer wonderful views -- the weather was too cool to attempt to go to the beaches, and we didn't learn if there are any bathing beaches in the vicinity -- the hotel is some 3 or so blocks from the sea.",5,2009,12,08
36,We loved it here,"I actually choose this hotel as NCL suggested it and trip adviser had good reviews. I was not disappointed at all. Being jet lagged when we arrived, it was so nice to have help with our luggage and in our room within a very short time. We stayed on the 19th floor and were given access to the 15th floor ""executive"" room because we were gold members for hilton. PS join hilton honors, I don't travel that much but I became a gold member on my second stay, so worth it. Anyway the executive room had food/beverages throughout the day and a large balcony with many table and chairs to sit and enjoy the view of Barcelona.

Our room was great, very modern and the bathroom was large with seperate shower, tub. My tub had an ocean view too. Every thing was so clean and comfortable. The bed was a little hard for me but I think that's just a person preference.

THe staff were so friendly and always made you feel welcome. It was very refreshing to see.

I liked the location, very near to the ocean, hugh shopping mall across the street, once we got the hang of the subway train, very simple to get to the ""downtown"" area of Barcelona. I will note too, I always felt safe in this area and in Barcelona downtown itself. Sometimes you never know in big cities but I noticed there were seniors walking around or families, even later into the evening. We often saw security guards or police. Barcelona just seems to want to keep things safe.",5,2009,12,06
36,Wonderful view of beach and lavish hotel,"We LOVED this hotel!  I will say that our experience is as a 'gold member' of the Hilton Honors levels, so we were able to stay on the executive lounge level.  That level includes breakfast, lunch, tea service, pre-dinner drinks/snacks and after-dinner service.  The rooms were large and had views of the water from the top floors.

We were there off-season, so the pool area was closed - but it would be perfect in the summer.  Walking distance to the beach and metro stations.",5,2009,11,24
36,"Five star service, four star facility, a long way from tourist district","The staff at this hotel are super friendly and helpful. They approach you and anticipate your needs. They develop options quickly to help you at the hotel and in planning outside activities. The concierge level has a fantastic panoramic view of the city.

The rooms are bigger than typical European rooms. Without asking the staff set up an extra bed for our child. They also brought (without being asked) extra towels, aoap, etc. 

The hotel has nice views of the beach/waterfront, but it's abaut two blocks away with office buildings in front. This is not a seaside beach resort. It's more like a business/convention hotel. It's about a 10 minute cab ride to Las Ramblas (about 12 Euros). 

BTW, wifi is an extra charge even for HHonors members. it's about Euros 27 a day.

if you want a high quality hotel with bigger rooms and excellent staff that's away from the chaos of Las Ramblas, this place is for you.",4,2009,11,22
36,great location near conference centre,"I stayed 4nights at the hilton diagonal mar. the hotel is conveniently located just in front of the convention center, in front of the sea and 10 minutes walking distance from the metro station (takes about 15minutes to reach downtown). the rooms are spacious and confortable with a choice of sea or town view. Buffet breakfast was very good. NIce outdoor swimming pool but closed (the trip was in october).",4,2009,11,13
36,very disappointed,"This is a soulless hotel.  Might be suitable for a business stay if attending the adjoining conference centre but totally unsuitable for a family.  The pool was closed.  They did not tell us in advance, we were very disappointed by this.  We had paid in advance for a weeks stay, the room was also very disappointing for a supposed 5 star.  Poor bathrooms. The rooms are not much better than an average motel.  No balconies and no opening windows.  Very claustrophobic.  This is clearly a room factory to facilitate the adjoining conference centre.  I would have moved my family out, if I had not been so stupid to pay in advance.  Very generic place and too far away from the centre of attraction of the city.  Don't expect anything extra thrown in, like upgrades or late check outs, they seem to be expert in resisting complaints, which makes me think they must get a lot.  Hilton in Europe does not equate to Hilton in the USA, so do not expect it.  Hilton are firmly off my hotel list for Europe now.",2,2009,11,11
36,I love this hotel!,"I've stayed at the Hilton Diagonal Mar twice and had a wonderful experience both times. I've stayed there in December and in May. The pool area is lovely - very relaxing with great service - but our December stay was so pleasant I didn't miss the pool at all. Note: my husband is a Hilton Diamond member and we get access to the Executive Lounge. The Executive Lounge is one of my favorite features of this hotel. Breakfast is fantastic - traditional Catalonian meats and cheeses, along with wonderful pastries. The staff was always excellent and friendly - front desk, Executive Lounge, housekeeping and even maintenance.

The Executive Floor rooms are spacious and modern with very nice bathrooms. As a previous reviewer said, the beds can roll on the wooden floors a bit which was kind of weird, but it wasn't a real problem. It certainly wouldn't keep me from staying at the hotel. 

The shopping mall across the street is great. There's a Mango and a Zara, as well as  a Calzedonia - an awesome store that sells tights, hosiery, socks, etc. - and tons of other stores. There is also a large store that is comparable to a Kmart in the US and it turned out to be very convenient.

One drawback about the hotel - the restaurant is not terribly impressive. With all the fantastic food in Barcelona, don't bother with the hotel restaurant.

I can't wait to go back!",5,2009,11,05
36,Lovely,"This is a lovely hotel, the location is away from all the hoopla in Las Rambles, but the subway is a five minute walk, very clean high standards and everyone was simply wonderful. There is a huge mall across the street with numerous eating establishments and some very good.",5,2009,11,03
36,Wonderful hotel experience!,The staff at this hotel was extremely friendly and helpful.  From the moment my wife and I checked in we truly felt welcome.  The location near the beach was also a plus.  We booked a rate that included breakfast.  Everything on the breakfast buffet was tasty and presented in a very well-arranged manner.  When we return to Barcelona we will definitely stay at this hotel again.,5,2009,10,26
36,Good Hotel for Business and Convention visitors,"I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights whilst attending a Business Convention. The hotel is situated directly at the side of the Barcelona Convention Centre, so it is the perfect location if you are attending a conference or other event at the Convention centre. I booked an Executive room, on arrival I was allocated a room on the 21st Floor which had a great view of the sea, however, when i entered the bathroom, the floor was flooded with water, the executive lounge concierge staff quickly allocated me another room on the 15th floor, this floor is where the executive lounge is located so it is very convenient for getting access to the lounge. The room was a good size, great bathroom and comfortable bed, however, due to the room having wood floors the bed easily moved from its base, the tv in the room had only one english tv channel which was bbc world news. The executive lounge was excellent, as were the staff, it had a great outdoor terrace with fantastic see and city views. The hotel is very suited for Business travellers but not particularly for leisure travellers. One bad point is the internet charges, they charge a huge 27 euros per 24hrs for wifi access, this way over the top, I decided to contact the hotel before i arrived and complained in advance about their internet charges and I informed them that i was seriously considering changing my reservation to the adjacent AC Barcelona Hotel which only charges 10 euros per day for wifi access, the hotel duty manager then handled my call and agreed that I could have a ""special guest"" internet rate of 10 euros, try this approach and it might work for you. I would probably stay at this hotel again on business, but only in an executive room. Also, you should note that the swimming pool area is only open from May to Sept, it is closed all other months.",4,2009,10,10
36,Wonderful Hotel...Good Location,We really enjoyed the Hilton Diagonal Mar in Barcelona.  It was very close to the metro and to the hop on hop off bus stop.  We liked it even more that it was not in the middle of Las Ramblas where all of the noise was.  Our room was very spacious and clean and the staff was very helpful with our requests.  We would stay here again.,4,2009,10,09
36,Great hotel!,"I loved this place. We spent five nights early August, and it hit all the right buttons. 
The rooms:
We has two interconnecting rooms, with good views, up to date, very contemporary decor - even one of the bathrooms has a view! TV channels had a good selection of non pay English channels, which is useful when you travel with young children.

Food.
Breakfast was spot on, non hurried, friendly, helpful service. Food was perfect, and room service and lunch by the pool all good - an excellect waiter at pool side restaurant, I think that he was from the Algarve. (or madrid:) 

Pulic spaces. Well, it was that pool that brought us there, and it was worth it. There's an outdoor chess board that went down well with our chess whizz, and the lobby and staff throughout were great.

Location. The location by the sea suited us, and as the hop on / hop off bus service stops close to the hotel, you reallly have the best of both world. A tip - the hotel offers the 'red' bus service, although the 'green' is on the same side of the street as the hotel and has a more frequent service.

The shopping mall across the street is a great resource (water and other provisions in the basement of the mall, the's ice back at the hotel) and there's a decent selection of restaurants nearby.

There are options to go to the Barcelona's theme parks from the concierge also.

We will go back!",5,2009,10,05
36,I would stay here again. They have the best breakfast!,"I booked this hotel on the recommendation of TripAdviser and I was not disappointed.  I also managed to get a good deal through a special that was on the Hilton website.  Overall, it represented excellent value.  The hotel is not difficult to get to on the metro, though it took a while to figure the metro out.  You can catch a metro from the airport straight to the hotel.  It takes about an hour in total.

The hotel service and amenities were excellent.  We received very good service from reception staff.  The hotel room was just beautiful.  Everything you expect from a business hotel.  Our rate also included breakfast buffet each morning.  An excellent spread of food.  The hotel is located next to a large shopping centre, with supermarket and excellent restaurants.  Great to pick up extra bottles of water, and an easy dining option in the evening  It was such a convenient location.

A trip into Barcelona itself takes about 20 to 30 minutes, depending on where you are going.  It's not dififcult at all.  Barcelona was very hot whilst we were there and we were very glad to return to the hotel with its airconditioning and wonderful swimming pool.  There is also spa facilities available.  The public beach within 15 minutes walk is also veyr good.

An excellent hotel from which to base yourself from.",5,2009,09,29
36,Nice Hotel,This hotel was very nice.  Rooms a bit small.  I requested a room with 2 beds and we got 2 twin beds. Not that close to the downtown area but the metro is very close to the hotel.  Train ride is about 10 minutes. Great mall and restaraunts across the street.  The beach is also very close to the hotel.  Overall I would say this is a good choice if you do not want to be right in the middle of the city.,4,2009,09,21
36,Excellant as expected!,"They stay at the hotel was lovely. Staff were excellant, rooms were immaculate, food was excellant, beds were comfy.....I could go on. I always receive 100% customer service at Hilton, the staff here excelled themselves! It made it such a lovely stay at this hotel and would love to go back....Well done Hilton!",5,2009,09,20
36,"Great hotel, would stay here again!","We stayed at the Hilton Diagonal Mar for 5 nights with our 2 teenage boys.  We had requested connecting or adjoining rooms and were given 2 separate rooms, however even though each room had it's own door there was still one additional door outside of the 2 room's entrance.  It was great because we could close that door and still be able to enter each other's rooms with privacy.  The rooms (one with a king bed and the other with 2 double beds) were very spacious and extremely clean.  The bathrooms were HUGE with a separate tub and shower.  Above the tub was a long window overlooking the city that was beautiful!  The rooms also had big fluffy bath robes and slippers :)  The mini fridge was stocked - but watch out...expensive!  We were given 2 complimentary bottles of water daily.  Look over your bill carefully when checking out...we were charged for mini-fridge items everyday when none were ever used.  Apparently if you move an item in the fridge it registers that it was removed.
The pool area was very nice.  Good sized pool and never a problem to find a lounger, plenty of towels provided as well.  The bar and grill area at the pool looked very nice, however after seeing that 1 glass (!) of Sangria cost 10 euro's we decided to go to the gigantic supermarket in the mall across the street to purchase our own drinks and snacks to have at the pool and in the room.
The gym was also nice, modern, clean, and with a good selection of equipment.  
The mall across the street has plenty of places to have something like a croissant and coffee for breakfast, and enough different restaurant choices to have lunch.  It is MUCH less expensive than dining at the hotel!!!
We found it very convenient that the Metro station was less than a 5 min. walk and only a few stops to downtown.  It is easy to purchase tickets from the vending machine (in english as well) and we normally purchased the T-10 tickets.
The beach is a 5 min. walk from the hotel and was clean and the water was nice and clear as well.
The only negative that I could find with this hotel is that I wanted to use the internet in the lobby and it was often down.  When it was up and running I was unable to use the ""charge to room"" feature and would have had to use a credit card.  The hotel's internet is EXTREMELY expensive!!!  If you have a laptop you can go right across the street to the McDonald's in the mall and use internet for free.  I think the hotel was charging something like 40 euro's per hour!",5,2009,09,16
36,Nice but a bit expensive,"Nice hotel, very near the beach (ten mins) Hilton breakfast, as always delicious and lots of choice. Rooms were spacious and clean. The pool is very nice, although 2 bottle of beer 18 Euros! What a rip off! The bars everywhere were quite expensive, but of course the rubbish euro rate at the moment. There is a shopping centre opposite. Allot of high street shops but they were about 20% more expensive than London! So don’t bother with shopping. Not while we have such a rubbish exchange rate. There are 2 tapas restaurants in the shopping centre, which you can see from the hotel. Very nice and very reasonably priced.  The cost of taxis is pretty expensive too so we got the train from the airport which saved as a fortune. 

Personally we love Barcelona and this Hilton is pretty good too but only if you get a discounted price.",4,2009,09,10
36,Pre-cruise- 2 night stay @ Hilton Diagonal;,"Just returned a few days ago from an 11 night family European Vacation. We stayed at the Hilton Diagonal Mar for 3 days/2 nights and then boarded a cruise ship for a Western Med 7 night cruise. 
We are a family of 4 (53,50,19 and 17). We booked 2 rooms, one a king and the other a twin room for the girls. We got a terrific price on a January sale thru the Hilton Website and was able to get these rooms w/ full Hilton breakfasts for everyone for $499 American Dollars for the 2 nights(and average of $125/per room/per night including full breakfast and VAT) BTW, the Hilton breakfast costs 24 Euros pp if bought separately.
The Hilton looks to be a pretty new hotel. Nice entrance and modern lobby. One of our rooms was available immediately while the other became available at about 2pm. We quickly stored our luggage in the room, washed up, rested a bit after a long flight from New York and headed to the Beach which was about 200 yards from the Hotel.
The Hilton is a bit away from the action but you had several easy options. One you can take the HOHO bus located across the street. You can also take the metro which was on the other side of the mall which was directly across the street. Or, you can do what we did, which was get a cab to take us to the center of the action and attractions. 
First of all, the Taxi from the airport for a party of 4 with lots of luggage came to 35 Euros. The taxi to and from La Rambla was approximately 10 Euros. You can eat, shop and go to the movies (if you want) at the mall across the street. There were a few authenic Spanish restuarants as well as fast food places.
After the beach we took a cab to La Rambla, returned early evening and swam in the pool at the hotel. Nice pool, great water temperature, food and drinks available. Plenty of loungers. The next day we took the Gaudi bus tour and visited the Picasso museum.
The rooms were quite nice. We were given 2 rooms that a private entrance. You go thru one door and then it opens up to 2 separate hotel rooms. The twin room was nice sized with marble bathroom and an oceanview. Our king room was huge with tub and separate shower. Only problem we had was keys hardly ever worked and we forced to exchange keys often.
When we checked in we asked if we could have access to executive lounge since we were celebrating our 25th anniversary. Woman behind desk said we could but for an additional 80 Euros. We declined but they did offer us a complimentary bottle of wine.
All in all we had a very nice stay.
Orbitz, Travelocity and Expedia rate this hotel 5 stars. I would rate it 4 stars due to it's lack of a concierge, no free internet and slow elevators. 
But if you don't have to be right in the middle of the action and you can get a good deal, I would highly recommend this hotel.",4,2009,09,06
36,"Outstanding hotel, if you don't mind the location","I have been to Barcelona a dozen times, and have stayed in most of the top-end hotels.  This is possibly the best, as long as you don't mind the location, far away from the Gothic Quarter and most tourist sights.

Stayed 5 nights in a jr. suite.  Spacious, great views over both the city and the sea.  Extremely comfortable beds, chairs, desks.  Good bathrooms with nice toiletries.  Good pool, with a nice bar.  Small gym, but I prefer running outdoors anyway.  The main restaurant offers an outstanding buffet breakfast.  Service overall is US-standard, and far superior to standard Spanish hotel service standards.

The Executive Lounge on the 15th floor has an amazing terrace; watching the sun rise over the sea was a sight to behold.  Also offers complimentary continental breakfast, and some decent tapas in the afternoon.",5,2009,09,02
36,"Fairly mediocre, not value for money.","We had a reasonable time at this hotel.  The staff were, with some notable exceptions, attentive, friendly and helpful.  We often felt though, that the staff on the reception were going through the motions, rather than genuinely caring. 

The rooms were of a reasonable size with excellent views of the sea and city.  We all had very large, comfortable beds and large bathrooms, with good showers.  The rooms were really rather basic though.  A bit like Travelodge rooms really.  Great to have tea and coffee making equipment in the rooms, often not present in Spanish hotels.  Disappointed that the large picture windows were not clean and remained dirty on the inside, throughout our stay.  

Excellent air conditioning in our rooms and throughout the hotel.  

The breakfasts were very good indeed.  Lots of fresh fruit, juices, cereals and a variety of cooked items.   The restaurant, however, had the air of a canteen about it, very noisy and like a cafe bar. 

The pool was good and we enjoyed relaxing by it some of the time.  The hotel is well placed as it is near to lovely beaches, the Metro is nearby as is a good shopping mall and food court.  There is a taxi rank opposite.  It is nice to be out of the really busy city centre yet close to everything.

The hotel is far too expensive for what it offers.  It is branded as a luxury upmarket hotel which it most certainly is not.",3,2009,08,31
36,Like our home away from home,"It was our seventh stay at this fabulous hotel in Barcelona. And it really feels a kind of home. It's a fantastic hotel to visit as a guest, but I think it is a good hotel to work in also. Because we meet many of the same nice members of staff year after year. They do their job with a smile and provides exellent service.

It doesn't matter to us that the Diagonal Mar Hilton is located outside of the center of Barcelona. We can go outside the door and take the 41 bus into Placa Catalunya or the metro around the shopping mal to Urquinaona or another central stop. And a taxi back to the hotel is only 10€. We love the quiet area and the surroundings of the hotel with green parks and the beach.

The poolarea makes the hotel a little more like a resort, and we love to have lunch in Brisa poolbar where the barbecuechef makes brochettes of seafood or chicken. Our favourite though is the iberian cured ham on tomatobread and icecold Chardonnay.

Hilton Diagonal Mar has got all we need from the fantastic breakfast buffet until the nightcup glas of wine in Pistaccio lobby bar.We can't wait to go back.",5,2009,08,30
36,Trully Magnificent Hotel - the Best in Barcelona,"I stayed at Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona in late July to early August 2009 (a week long break) and had an amazing 8 days!  I have been to Barcelona on several occasions previously and have done all of the tourist stuff.  I now use Barcelona as a city to visit for relaxation, especially when there is pretty much guaranteed sun during July and August and temperatures in excess of 30 degrees.

The best part of the break was the hospitality received at Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona – it really is a magnificent hotel. – and less than 5 minutes walk to the beach – and a 30 minute walk to the Olympic Port. 

The entire stay at the hotel is a real pleasure.  The breakfast is second to none with an amazing selection of fresh fruit, meats, bread, cheeses, cakes, yoghurts, juices and cooked breakfast – and of course a good coffee!  The food overall was exceptional, with a pool bar serving excellent lunchtime dishes.

The guest rooms are extremely spacious with very large king size beds, wide screen tv’s and either a view of the beach and sea, or the mountains and the city – an excellent view in the evening when the sun is setting.  The rooms also have great sized bathrooms.

We spent most of the afternoon each day by the swimming pool on the roof of the lower part of the hotel.  It was the perfect place to relax and read a good book as well as drink a range of refreshing drinks.

We had access to the Executive Lounge and this really was an excellent benefit from this stay at the hotel.  Throughout the day a number of fresh snacks, cakes and nibbles were served, and we chose from a wide range of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks.
Other facilities and areas in the hotel are a large lobby, lobby lounge and bar, expansive meeting facilities, gym, spa treatments, swimming pool, restaurant.

The level of service from the staff was of the highest standard and this really is something that to me makes this by far the best hotel in Barcelona.",5,2009,08,28
36,Fabulous Hotel,"My family of four recently stayed at this hotel for three nights before taking a cruise.  Our rooms were located on the 22nd floor overlooking the sea and I couldn't have been happier with it.  I loved the decor and layout of my room and found it very relaxing.  I also enjoyed the executive lounge and it's outdoor terrace.  The lounge was beautifully set up but the food was a little disappointing, compared to what we had eaten in other Hilton lounges, on this trip to Europe.  This was the only lounge that we were in that didn't serve any hot food.

I'm not sure if I loved the location or not.  On the one hand, it was nice to be away from the chaos of the city and the location was beautiful but, on the other hand, I felt a bit removed from Barcelona and everything it has to offer.

This was my first visit to Barcelona but I hope to come back again and I would definitely consider staying at this hotel.",5,2009,08,26
36,The best Hotel I have stayed at in Europe!,"I have stayed in just less than 100 hotels in Europe, and Hilton Diagonal Mar in Barcelona has to be the best hotel I have stayed at in Europe!  Not only for the look, comfort, facilities, food, but also the excellent location and weather!  The beach is 2 minutes walk, and a very pleasant 30 minute walk to the Olympic port!  If you like night clubs, the Olympic port is a good choice with some night clubs right on the beach - and this is just a 5 minute taxi ride!

If you don't fancy the beach, you have the very exclusive looking swimming pool and sun deck area.  It is extremely spacious with relaxing music, ice cold face towels, as well as an excellent range of freshly made food, soft drinks, and alcoholic beverages.  It was lunchtime one day and I fancied something not on the menu...I asked them if it was okay for them to make me this dish, and it was no problem at all.  The chef and bar staff were excellent!

I have since recommended this hotel to all of my friends and associates all over the world, showed them the pictures and told them about the service.  They all plan to visit Barcelona and Hilton's Diagonal Mar Barcelona hotel!

I had access to the Executive lounge in the hotel.  This really is a great feature of Hilton hotels.  It allows you to enjoy a complimentary drink, newspaper, snacks, cakes, seafood, and freshly made sandwiches

The host in the Executive lounge during my stay would often be a gentleman named Edgar.  He was excellent with his knowledge about Barcelona as well as the seafood restaurants he would recommend!  Thank you Edgar!

Breakfast in the restaurant was excellent! Everything could ever want for breakfast is there for you!  And if you can't find it, the friendly staff will do all they can to get it for you!

Rooms are spacious and quiet.  You have a huge television with a great selection of channels.  Complementary water.  There is an Iron and ironing board in every room.  Bathrooms are modern and very clean with complimentary toiletries!  Each floor is also equipped with an ice machine and ice buckets.

Depending on the side of the hotel your room is on, you can see the sun rise over the Mediterranean sea and the moon at night...or on the other side you will see the sun set over the beautiful city!

The staff make your stay personal and pleasurable!

I am now looking to book a conference at the hotel next year in their extensive business and meeting facilities...it really is a perfect hotel for leisure and business.

I travel a lot with work and have been to many top hotels hotels across the world.  This is one of the best I have been to!  And certainly the best I have ever been to in my many trips to Barcelona and Europe on a whole!",5,2009,08,25
36,Great chain hotel out of city centre,"This hotel was typical of what you would expect of the Hilton.  The room was beautiful with a view of the beach and pool.  Luxurious bathroom with Crabtree & Evelyn toiletries.  

I didn't have breakfast at the hotel as it was not included in my package.  However, there is a large shopping centre directly opposite the hotel which had plentiful options for meals, including a Starbucks.  There was a large supermarket in the shopping centre which I would recommend for stocking up on water and fruit, rather than paying the hotel prices.  Also lots of designer and high street shops e.g. Desigual in the shopping centre, plus a cinema.

I didn't have a chance to use the 24-hour gym or pool at this hotel, so if you do book, make sure you are able to make use of the facilities, else why pay for them.

It is true what other reviewers have said about the internet access - it is too expensive.  However, a tip: go to the nearby AC Barcelona hotel where there are computers you can use just past the lobby to the left, and wireless.  Just look like you belong there, or buy a drink at the bar...

If you want an authentic, Barcelona city experience, you won't get it at this hotel.  However, it is an easy journey via the metro into central Barcelona.  This hotel is also on the major tourist bus route which for 21 euros per day, 27 euros for 2 days, will take you on an opentop bus round all the sights.  It's easy to use, hop-on, hop-off and I'd recommend it if you don't know the city well.",5,2009,08,24
36,Too bad,"all the Hilton's aren't like this one. Impeccable service, accomodations and cleanliness, along with breathtaking views.  It's not really a beach location, even though there is water nearby. You're removed from the hustle and bustle of the Las Ramblas city center but there's plenty of transportation to get there, quickly and easily.  Taxis are waiting at your door step.  If you enjoy a sense of pampering in between pounding the pavement while you travel, you will find it here.",5,2009,08,23
36,Perfect and friendly! A Happy Vistor :),"Upon arrival we were greeted with champagne and dessert in celebration of our honeymoon! The staff spoke English well and were eager to please. The hotel was booked by travelocity/AAA, so we got a bargain! The hotel was spotless, the breakfast was included in our stay and was our favorite meal; very hearty. My husband and I stayed on the 16th floor and our room overlooked the sea. We witnessed a breathtaking sunrise. Overall I could not have been more pleased with my choice. The inner city was very easy to get to by metro (Line 4, yellow) a short walk away, and the Bus Turistic was across the street which takes you everywhere (get a 2 day pass). Also, the Diagonal Mar shopping center is across the street which has the best gifts and a variety of food. The staff will help you with any questions. I would not recommend staying in the inner city because it all looked loud and crowded. If you are looking for a relaxing get away by the sea with very easy access to everywhere else, then this hotel is for you. I am a very happy visitor; you will be too!",5,2009,08,18
36,Great hotel for your second visit to Barcelona,"The hotel definitely merits its 5* grading.  We arrived after a cruise and found our room ready for us to check into before 1000.  It was a deluxe room on the 13th floor and had views of both the city and the sea.  It was plenty big enough for my wife and I, with a large clean and high quality bathroom, a very, very comfortable bed and a sofa, desk and entertainment area in front of the window.  We heard no-one else once we were in our room.  They also provided us with a 1400 checkout and the opportunity to use the fitness suite after our last afternoon of sun worship at no cost.
The breakfast was well cooked and the service was great.  The variety was impressive.  The pool has a decking area around it which fills up rather early in August but is surrounded by a much larger paved area which is great for those who only want a sunbed.  There are 6 outdoor showers to provide essential cooling whilst tanning.
Outside is a shopping mall with at least 25 different food outlets.  There is a range of other shops on the three floors there.  The official tour bus stops outside the hotel and allows you to access any other part of this sprawling city. €21 gets you a full day pass, but if you buy from the Hilton you get a discount.  La  Rambla can be a €10-15 taxi ride away, but if you want to go there and pay 50% more for everything, you would probably be better staying in a hotel right in the city centre.",5,2009,08,16
36,Excellent stay.,"We had an excellent stay at the Hilton Diagonal Mar.   We stayed for 6 days total in August 2009.  The staff was attentive.  The rooms and amenities were great.   We even ate one night at the restaurant, which was quite good.

You need to know what you are getting.   If you want an old school hotel in the middle of the action or the Old City, this is not the place.   If you want a modern American style hotel with great service, great rooms, a pool and close to the beach, this is your place.   Traveling with kids, we found it a nice respite to get some space from the pace of the city, but still be very close to everything.   You are not in the heart of Barcelona.   You are six metro stops away from the City Center-- a 12 to 15 minute Metro ride.   The  Metro is an easy 5 minutes from the hotel and runs every 4 to 6 minutes.   Or if you prefer, all attractions are a 10 to 12 euro cab fare.  The beach is 2 blocks-- the closest you will get in Barcelona.   It is not the most popular, central or trendy beach in Barcelona, but it is a nice beach.   BTW, the picture is not of the beach; it is of the pool.  The fitness center was small, but adequate.

This hotel was great for a longer visit to the City if you want some down time, a pool and proximity to the beach.   The staff is helpful.   The modern mall across the street is great for families with kids who sometimes want comfort food or experiences.  However, I would still stay here if traveling just as a couple because the accommodations were that good.  It is even better if you are upgraded as an Hilton Honors member.

We also found a real concierge at the hotel who was knowledgeable, but the rest of the staff was very helpful as well.   

We would definitely stay again.",5,2009,08,12
36,very comfortable stay,"Just spent the week (first week of Aug) in the hilton diagonal mar.  Okay the hotel is a bit away from anything so be aware you will have to use some form of transportation to get out and about.  This was not a problem for us as the metro is near by and easy to use,its also nice to come back to a calm area after spending time in the outstanding but hectic Ramblas or Olympic port areas.  The hotel was great, the pool area was nice and peaceful and the staff were very friendly.  Everything is as is normal with hiltons incredibily over-priced at the hotel bar and restaurant so be aware if you are planning to eat or drink in.  There is a nice shopping centre over the road which does have a restaurant terrace facing the hotel, these restaurants are adequate and loads cheaper than the hilton but lack any atmosphere and the staff all look miserable in these places so we tried it then moved on.  There are some nice places to eat at the olympic port (La Fonda) and also some nice places in and around Ramblas, just look around and explore I think.  Had no problem with safety at all, just kept my wits about me at all times and was sensible when in busy places like the fountain show and ramblas.  Must just recant this story from the hotel in the off-chance the people involved are reading and can clear it up.  Whilst around the hotel pool became aware of a young brit couple having an argument near-by.  He was unhappy about her going topless so he flopped his bits out stating that it was staying out until she covered up and he was serious, couldnt believe what we were hearing and unfortunetely seeing. The argument progressed between them and they eventually stormed off their seperate ways after letting several of us in on the state of their marrage for about an hour.  From the argument we couldnt help but hear that they were actually on honeymoon, wow.  I am now interigued about the outcome as it was like an afternoon soap opera.  Anyway I digress I now have a little knowledge of Barcelona and would be happy to try and share if people want to get in touch and ask, I may know some of the basics.  Please confirm with your wives before you go as to her state of play with regard to topless sunbathing is my initial stab at advice. just ask!",4,2009,08,12
36,Ok hotel.  Not overly impressed.,"First, the profile pic looks nothing like the hotel. It is not that close to the beach and the beach is not that clean. 

Secondly, they charge too much for internet.  The cheapest daily plan is 22 euros per day.  Ridiculous considering other four and five star hotels offer it for free in Barcelona. 

They are located across the street from a decent mall but no major attractions nearby. You have to take cab or metro to see the sites. 

The breakfast was good with decent variety.  The rooms were clean and spacious. 

Found it hard to believe they didn't have washclothes but neither did any of the other two hotels I stayed at in Spain.  The staff was friendly but they were overworked.  I think they worked like 12 hour shifts!!  Far too much for such a busy hotel.  They did the best they could but that Hilton could/should hire more staff. At the very least, they should hire a concierge (a real one) who knows the city instead of having the bell boys offer city suggestions when needed.",2,2009,08,10
36,Excellent hotel and location,"This was our fourth stay for 7 nights on the executive floor. Overall cannot fault this hotel (although the spirits were not as free flowing in the executive lounge this year) It has a fantastic location for Mall, Metro and beach A big thank you to Edgar and Yasmin for their help and professionalism especially when my wife needed emergency treatment at an eye hospital. Looking forward to our return next year already.",5,2009,08,06
36,Most attentive employee staff I've ever Encountered!,"The attention to detail, overall courteousness, and a genuine sense of caring for guests was evident throughout our stay.  After a couple of days, many staff members even went out of their way to remember or name and greeted us accordingly.  Hotel management was always present , including the General Manager, to greet guests to ask whether anything was needed.  We really felt at home!

The rooms were comfortable, clean and freshly appointed.  All amenities, such as hairdryer, coffee service, iron were available.  Ice machines were on every floor and readily available.  Public areas were spotlessly kept clean and odorless.  Cable TV gave you a wide selection of choices, including CNN, CNBC, BBC, etc. 

I would highly recommend this hotel to all who plan on visiting Barcelona!",5,2009,07,27
36,"Cold hard staff, least friendly Hilton in Europe","Nice modern rooms with large baths. Stayed three nights.
Mall just across the street with decent dining.
Pool area is nice but towel and sunbed attendant is overzealous and gruff.
Front desk staff cold.
Least friendly Hilton Hotel in Europe on our trip.
Used points from my husbands diamond member account but because of
illness he was not with us...hence no upgrade or executive floor privledges.
""We do not make any exceptions to our policy"" 
(which is why we used points to stay at this hotel) ""
I book his hotel business stays so I'll keep this in mind when booking Hilton in
the future...way to tick off the booking agent  :)",2,2009,07,26
36,Nice pool area,"My friends and I met up here for a work conference. I stayed in a standard twin single room with my friend. The bed are ""singles"" so don't try to fit two couples in a room you Americans! 

The hotel was nice and modern, it took about 20-25 mins by taxi to the hotel from the airport. Check-in staff were very friendly and spoke excellent English. 

I had a problem with the lock on my door and because they were rather full, a check-in staff was always ready to accompany me to ensure I wouldn't be locked out of my room. 

I did not partake in breakfast but I heard the buffet was amazing. 

The pool area is really big and you can get massages (prebook with concierge) in the beautiful white tents next to the pool. This it not really a kid-friendly pool, I would look elsewhere for a pool holiday for a family. More of a lap/chill out pool. The pool bar was fun and a great place to be outside. They do serve good. 

This pool area could easily have a large cocktail party for an event/conference if you were looking for something of this nature. 

We had a bath and separate shower which was really nice and I loved the nice hairdryer. 

Kind of far away from tourist attractions - I have been to Bareclone before so for me the hotel was more about being close to the beach and in the sun. This would suit cruise travelers as its nearby the port. 

All in all good hotel - would recommend it.",3,2009,07,22
36,Best Hilton I've ever stayed at,"I'm a hilton Diamond member, I've stayed in dozens of hiltons all around the world. THis one was my favorite. The staff was so friendly to us, and after travelling so far to get there through the multiple airports and train stations - this hotel was a true reward for the haul. I stayed on the executive floor with my status/points, and the room was a gem. A huge view of Barcelona from a corner room with windowed walls on both corners, a great room, and the finest hotel bathroom I've ever seen. It had independent showers, and a window from the shower to see the city below. Wow! The executive lounge has a stunning view, and fine food. When I looked next to me at breakfast, I was sitting next to a formula 1 driver who was in town after the big race. The breakfast and drinks at the lounge rank among the top 3 I've ever had the pleasure of attending. 

The beach shouldn't be a consideration if you are staying here before June, and the attractions in Barcelona can be seen by getting on a tour bus stop nearby, or by just getting on the subway.",5,2009,07,15
36,Used points and was pleasantly surprised.,"My wife and I started off a two week trip to Spain at this hotel using Hilton points for a free stay.    If I was paying I would not stay here again simply due to the location.  The hotel was perfectly fine it is just away from the action and you will spend 20 minutes each day commuting to the real attractions.
With that being said there is very little I can add that other reviews have not already mentioned, but I will try.   The hotel is sort of a hybrid business hotel.  It does have an incredible pool area which gives it the hybrid feel.
The lobby, staff, room service were all terrific.  The room was kind of minimalist, almost on the no personality end.   It was clean and comfortable.  We were on the 13th floor and had a view of the sea that was nice, however I think I would have prefered a view of Barcelona.   The beach is not the kind of beach you'd want to walk to and definately not a reason to stay here.  There is a fitness center and it was mediocre.
The location is in a suburb but there is a metro station about 2 blocks away.   It is the Forum stop on the Yellow line (for all those people that like to figure out what they are doing ahead of time).  Using the metro was VERY convenient and was totally comfortable and inexpensive.  Barcelona's metro is the most user friendly of all the subway's I've used.   Buy a T10 ticket from the touch screen vending machine in the subway entrance.  It is good for 10 trips and can be shared by as many people until it is used up.
The mall across from the hotel was convenient.  There was a massive heat wave that hit the city during our visit and I was able to go to the mall and buy nice sandals and shorts on the spot.  By the way, my wife is very fashion conscious and she dropped a few penny's in some of the unique designer boutiques in the mall.  The mall has several places to eat that were frequented by locals but all of them had the chain feel.  Like a TGI Fridays...When you are exhausted from exploring its a better option than eating at the hotel.  In the basement of the mall there is also a grocery store in case you need anything.  Also..There is a Starbucks in the mall on the second floor on the edge of the food court but it doesn't open until 10AM.
If you have Hilton points to use, this is a great place, but if you are looking for a Spanish vacation and have a limited time in each city this is not the place for you.",4,2009,07,11
36,Loved it!!,"My friend and I recently returned from a 2 night stay at the Hilton Diagonal Mar and we absolutely loved it!  From the moment we entered the hotel, we knew we were in for a treat!  The lobby itself was modern and beautifully decorated and the front desk staff couldn't have been more helpful.  They were extremely friendly and informative and the check in process took just a few minutes.  
  Our room was of a great size by any standards and the facilities were more than adequate.  The bathroom was both modern and clean and also a great size - we were impressed with the separate bath tub and shower too!
The pool/sunbathing area is gorgeous and is bigger than in the photos.  The lifeguards/pool staff were extremely friendly and chatty and made every effort to say hello the minute we entered the pool area.  We had a lovely view from our room looking out to the sea and and beach was only a couple of minutes walk.  Breakfast was fabulous.  
There is a metro stop not far from the hotel and a huge shopping centre opposite the hotel with indoor/outdoor cafes and restaurants as well as an oversized supermarket!
Overall, our stay in the Hilton couldn't have been better and the staff there are amongst the friendliest we've ever experienced and has definitely encouraged us to return. 
I would definitely reccommend this hotel to anyone who is after a relaxing holiday due to the hotel's location, however the centre of Barcelona is only a few stops away on the metro or not far by taxi.  I know i'll be back!!",5,2009,07,09
36,Fantastic hotel and staff,"We stayed at the Hilton Diagonal Mar June 9-12.  We absolutely loved it. The room and bathroom were modern and quite large. The view of the Mediterranean  from every window including the one that ran alongside the bathtub and shower  was absolutely gorgeous. The metro station was easy walking distance from the hotel. We were about 20 minutes away from any attraction that we wanted to see. We did all of the typical things like walking the Ramblas/Bari Gotic, La Boqueria,  Montjuic, Picasso Museum, Sagrada Familia, beach, etc.  We were quite comfortable on the metro even at night.. Hilton's Executive Lounge was a  treat that we had not expected. The staff (Jordi, Ramiro and Maribel)  took very good care of us. The mall across the street was a great alternative for dining when you wanted something close by. This quiet location was a welcome retreat after a busy day/night being a tourist.",5,2009,06,27
36,Great Stay in Barcelona,Got off a cruise ship in Barcelona and had a cold-got right to the hotel for about 18 euros it was 8 o'clock in the morning-I am a gold member of Hilton Honors-so the stay was free and they upgraded us to a suite with a beautiful view and let us in our room early so I could crawl into bed and sleep which I really appreciated since I was feeling poorly.  They also sent some books home for me so I wouldn't have to pay extra charges for my luggage being overweight.  They helped us figure out the metro system too. It is a little far away from Las Ramblas but we took the metro and hop on bus tour no problem to get anywhere and there was a mall across the street with some nice places to eat and shop.,5,2009,06,14
36,My best Hilton stay ever,"I am a Hilton Honors Gold member and this was an award stay, paid with my points. But even if I had paid with my precious money I would still agree this is my best Hilton stay ever.

Our (upgraded executive level) room was very clean and maintained that way the whole week we spent here. All staff members were very helpful, friendly and always with a positive ""can do""-attitude!

Complimentary breakfast and other executive lounge services/snacks/drinks were very generous. The only down sides with this hotel are the location (which is a little far outside the city center - on the other side is that the views of the mediterrainan are stunning) and the outrageous selfparking fee of 36 euros/day inside the garage. However the rental car company let us use one of their spots in the garage for free. Both thumbs up for SIXT Car rental which has a counter inside the lobby! Regarding the location can also be said that the subway is only 1-2 blocks away but that service ends at midnight.

We will certainly stay here again when we return to Barcelona.",5,2009,06,11
36,Beautiful Hotel - Very Happy,"After a Mediterranean cruise, hubby and I used points to stay in this hotel for 3d/2n.  I couldn't be more impressed with the facilities!  The lobby is very clean, modern and comfortable, and has free newspapers (I read El Pais as I know Spanish). The front desk was very pleasant, international, and spoke English perfectly.  We were blown away by the size and furnishings of the room and bathroom!  Very beautiful and state of the art!  Many local and international TV channels, free coffee/tea and chocolates and water kettle in room, robes and slippers, etc.  We had a view of the sea from the room (we were there on a public holiday and the beach 2 blocks away was packed - a fun experience as we walked along the shore), and the elevator lobbies faced the city/mountains, so we had the best of both worlds watching the sun set over the city and Montserrat.

The largest shopping mall in Barcelona is directly across the street from the hotel.  There is a great restaurant called Free Way on the outdoor terrace where there is a 14 euro/pp dinner buffet with salad bar, tapas (jamon serrano, cheeses, olives), desserts, and best of all, truly fresh meats and seafoods you order to be grilled for you.  The shrimp and salmon were so fresh and delicious!  There were other types of fish, crayfish, cuttlefish, squid and other local sea things to be grilled along with beef, chicken, pork sausages, etc. with chimicurri and churrasco sauces, etc.

On the other side of the mall is the Metro station.  Underground there is a Metro train and aboveground there is a tram.  It is cheap and easy to get to anywhere you want to go in the city.  Yes, it is not in downtown, but the area is clean, the mall gives you shopping and dining options, and you can sunbathe and swim on the walking-distance beach.

The hotel bar and restaurant are attractive (but expensive, as in most all hotels).  The fitness center was decent sized and had great equipment, the pool deck  had plenty of chair and the pool itself was quite attractive.  There is even a human-sized chess set on the pool deck.  There is a floor of conference/meeting rooms, and a large convention center a block away.  So I could see that this is primarily a business hotel, but it worked great for me as a tourist. 

I couldn't have been happier with this hotel!",5,2009,06,08
36,Very relaxing stay. Would definitely reccommend!,"I stayed at this hotel for 5 nights, and very glad that I did. Hotel was nice and clean. We stayed in the Relaxation room on the 14th floor with amazing views of the city. We found that the Rexlaxation room had a Bose system which is hooked up to the TV so you can play DVD's and CD's (a few relaxing CD's/DVD's are provided. The room is quite spacious with an Ottoman chair in the corner as well as a working area. The Hotel was very clean and bed sheets were changed everyday. 

The bathroom is of decent size. There is a jet bath with a tv in the wall (although you can't really hear it if you have the jets on as it's VERY loud. There is a separate shower too. Design of the room is very calming with nice calming colours.

The hotel is directly opposite a shopping centre with a variety of restaurants and shops. A Primark was opening there on 8th June 2009. The shopping centre is open daily from 10am to 10pm although not too sure about Sunday. Inside the centre is also an Alcampo shop where you can get any type of groceries or household goods.

I did not eat in the restaurant so cannot comment on their food although everything was VERY pricey. A bottle of water costs EURO 4 for 500ml and EURO 7 for a bottle of beer. They did provide 2 complimentary bottles of water everyday which was good.

We spent most of the days by the pool which was nice. Beach towels are provided. There are a number of sunbed by the pool (on the 2nd floor) and also other beds away from the pool. I spent mos mornings in the gym. The gym isn't the biggest but I found that there was never anymore than 4 people in it at any one time. There are 3 running machines, 3 crosstrainers and 2 rowers. There are also quite a few machines and a lot of free weights too. 

We got to the hotel by train. As mentioned by other reviewers, you should get a T10 ticket which can be used by any number of people but with a total number of 10 times. It takes up to 1 hr and 30 mins to get from airport to the hotel. The RENFE from the airport to Passeig De Gracia takes approx 25 mins and then you have to walk to the metro station L4 (yellow line) which is about 10 mins. Then it's 9 stops to El Maresme Forum and then about 5 mins walk to the hotel. It is quite hard work if you have lots of bags as there are lots of stairs. If you have quite a few bags I'd definitely reccommend getting a Taxi.

Overall had a really nice relaxing time at the hotel and would definitely reccommend this hotel.",4,2009,06,08
36,Great hotel,"I don't know we could have afforded this hotel if we did not use points for our stay, but we did enjoy this luxurious hotel. It is the kind of place you walk in to and just turn around in a circle to try to take it all in. Great location as well. Breakfast was abundant and delicious. Our room ran out of hot water the first night but we didn't have any trouble after that. We would stay here again if we save enough points but to book on our own it would very expensive.",5,2009,06,02
36,Fantastic Hotel!!!,"I stayed here with my Fiance for 4 nights in May. The taxi from the airport to the hotel was about 40euros as they charge for your bags aswell. We were due to check in to our room at 2pm but arrived about 11am and could go staight to our room. The staff were really helpful and came outside to take our suitcases straightaway, they also gave us a really good map of the area. 

Our room was really clean and quite big for just 2 people, we had massive window with a view of the hotel pool and the sea. The bathroom was quite big and had a bath and shower, we also had a minibar and a safe in the room. The room was cleaned everyday.
In the rest of the hotel there is a swimming pool (which we tried and it was really really cold), there's also a gym, sauna and restaurant but we didn't use these.

The hotel isn't in the centre but the nearest metro station is about a 5/10 minute walk and the beach is only 5 mins away. There is a shopping centre right opposite the hotel with loads of shops like H&M, Zara and there was even a Primark which hadn't opened yet, there's also a supermarket, restaurants and a starbucks. 
The main street the rambla is really busy and easy to get pickpocketed so we were really carefull with any bags and cameras and were ok. There are also loads of souvinere shops here. 

On our last day we ordered breakfast in bed (cost about 44 euros but was worth it) there was loads of food for 2 people and it was all really nice. You can choose from a menu but we got crossants, toast, bread rolls, fruit, cereal, meats, hot choc with cream and apple juice. Overall, we both thought the hotel was great and have no complaints. Would definately go back.",5,2009,05,24
36,Before cruise,"We certainly made a good choice.  Room was ready when we arrived around noon, which is always a plus after a long flight.  Although it may not be ""downtown"", excellent location.  Just hop on the underground and go wherever you want. It's easy to use and you don't have to speak Spainish/Catalan. Great shopping close by, an excellent Tapa bar next door to the hotel that is reasonable for brekkie or whenever.  We could leave our luggage when checked out, until we were ready to collect it later in the day.  Helpful staff.",5,2009,05,22
36,Faultless Hotel,"Stayed one night before cruise and one night after cruise due to flight timings.  Don't believe I could have made a better choice. Upgraded both stays as Gold Honors member and have to say the Executive lounge was superb. Service all over hotel first rate, and would like to single out Galin in reception area as a very pleasant and helpful member of staff.",5,2009,05,14
36,Barcelona at its Best,"Loved the Hilton Diagonal Mar.  Got a nice deal on Booking.com with breakfast buffet included for 3 nights.  Excellent large rooms with posh bathrooms and very clean all around.  Hard beds, but that is a problem everywhere is Spain.  Best thing about this hotel is its location if you want get some sleep at night and relax, which is just what you can do - it's not near the Ramblas but in the northeastern end of town a couple blocks from the beach.  Just a few blocks from the El Maresme Forum metro station and the no. 7  bus line goes right from the hotel to Placa de Catalunya.  Very easy to get to all the sights in town.  Helpful hint: don't attempt to drag your luggage through the Barcelona metro system especially if you have a lot of it as there are few escalators and lifts, and you'll be lugging it up and down endless stairs and transfer tunnels.  

Hilton hotel staff reminded us of the actors on the BBC Hotel Babylon series: they were great fun and very helpful with directions, and quite obviously crazy in their off hours; as this was low season, they had a lot of free time on their hands to go wild behind closed doors, and they did!  We speak Spanish and because of this one of the breakfast servers explained to us how to get tickets to the Sunday evening bullfights held at the Barcelona bull ring, which was awesome.  The hotel is only 2 years old, has an outdoor pool (although too cold to swim in April), nice gym, locker rooms, and saunas.  It's located across from a big indoor shopping mall with everything in it, including a huge Alcampo store for anything you would need: toiletries, food, drinks, wine, you name it.  One night we did a picnic and bought fois gras, cooked shrimp, french bread, olives, and wine from the Alcampo all for about 10 Euros.  The hotel breakfast was American-oriented with eggs, sausage, and a large cold buffet with lots of choices.  

Barcelona has a rough side and we avoided the narrow dark alleys around the Ramblas at night as pickpocketing and muggings are common.  If you stay to the lighted areas it is ok.  Barcelona is also very transient, with lots of folks from all over Europe, Africa, and the Middle East.  The metro was always packed with scummy, partied-out 20-somethings, and if you brushed up against them you'd want to take a shower afterward to prevent catching any number of skin or other diseases or bugs.  One drawback about the Hilton is the far too expensive internet access, which is typical of European hotels.   We punted on this and found a mujahideen internet cafe about 3 blocks from the hotel that cost 1 Euro an hour.  

If you get to Barcelona go see Montserrat, which is about an hour out of town by commuter train. It's magnificent.  The Hilton Diagonal Mar is a great choice for a hotel and I would definitely stay there again and recommend to friends.  It's one of the best in Barcelona and up there with the Ritz-Carlton Hotel Arts, which has become a bit shabby in the last few years anyway, at twice the cost of the Hilton.",5,2009,05,06
36,Happy Hilton.,"Great hotel,modern, spacious rooms, well equipped with the usual from Hilton.
A little out of town but easy transport system to connect to the city.
Staff were friendly, and very informative, and bureux de change were better rates than in the city.
Breakfast was plentiful and very varied, couldn't ask for better.
Would definetly stay again and recommend.",5,2009,05,05
36,Liked the Hotel,"We made a trip in the month of December to Hilton. The best thing abt the hotel is its location. The beach is on a walking distance, there is a mall right across the road, and a metro station also on a walking distance. 

The hotel rooms are spacious and the rooms facing towards the beach have a beautiful view and when in the morning sunlight comes, it makes the place look more beautiful.

The hotel staff is a English speaking and really helpful.",5,2009,05,02
36,Excellent Hotel,"My husband and I spent four days in Barcelona prior to departing on a  Mediterranean cruise.  My concerns regarding the location were unfounded.  Barcelona's subway system the Metro was across the street from the hotel.   The hotel staff were most accommodating and provided excellent service throughout our stay.
The bar was quite expensive and we did not eat at the hotel.
Andrea M",5,2009,03,31
36,Enjoyed this different part of Barcelona,"Stayed here for 2 nights on points, received an upgrade as a Hilton Gold VIP..

I have stayed in Barcelona many times and stayed here to be near to a friend nearby. Really enjoyed the different location and proximity to the sea. Still near enough to the centre via the Metro. There are so many interesting areas in Barcelona if you want to see them you travel wherever you are based.

Loved the room and beds and the bathroom was good too.

We had a sea view, the beach really isnt too far or that difficult to get too.

The area is mainly residential and shopping with some restaurants but not as many per km. as in the centre.

The staff dealt kindly with me when my wallett went ""missing"". I found it but they were genuinely concerned and helpful.

Would happily stay here again or indeed live round here!",4,2009,03,26
36,"Great hotel, a bit off the beat","I thought: ""Can't go wrong with the Hilton, in particular when it's at the beach"". Well, it was not quite at the beach (Barcelona decided to build their highway right on the beach), needed to cross the highway to get to the sand. But, it was a great hotel. Good breakfast buffet, large room, modern interior, very friendly and international staff. I felt really comfortable in the room.
The metro is about a 5 minute walk (crossing through the shopping mall across the street). Felt safe. Shopping mall had a Starbucks and Ben&Jerry's stand, various different style restaurants and shops. 
The metro takes about 8 stops to the centre (old town). 
All in all, it was a pleasurable stay at the hotel.",4,2009,01,30
36,Hilton Diagonal Mar,"Nestled in the heart of the new business district, across the street from one of Barcelona’s largest malls and a block away from the beach sits the lovely new Hilton Diagonal Mar. The rooms have incredible views of the city, ocean and even some of the arty pool area. There is a cozy gym with saunas and even some equipment on the patio area for outdoor exercise. The staff is friendly and multi-lingual. The lobby bar serves the best Sangria I had on the trip! The bartender filled it with exotic fruits and things….what a treat! Historical areas  and attractions surround you at this hotel. I wasn’t more than a 10 minute cab ride from the places I wanted to go. One could take a bus, train, cab or foot to get where you need to go from here and it wouldn’t take long. The Cordobes Flamenco show was good and the food was alright. The concierge at the hotel can book your tickets for shows you’d like to see and restaurants you’d like to visit.",4,2009,01,25
36,"Good hotel, would recommend","We stayed at the Diagonal Mar in September. Very friendly staff, clean and comfortable room. We ate in the main restaurant on our first night due to late arrival and although staff were friendly and the food was fine, I wouldn't recommend it as it was standard hotel buffet style and very little atmosphere. The hotel is some way out of town but cabs are easy to find as its on a main road. The Barcelona tourist bus also stops  200m down the road from the hotel. The main reason I chose this hotel over others was the pool. The pool area is nice with huge sun plaza and nice pool bar/cafe. The pool itself is pretty small but there were very few people about so we had it to ourselves most of the time. Would definitely recommend this hotel for a short break.",4,2009,01,07
36,Great hotel in Barcelona,"We were Barcelona in July 2008 for a week, with our 8 and 12 years old sons. We stayed at Hilton Diagonal Mar. We had 2 rooms on the executive floor.The rooms were little bit on the small side, but very comfortable with modern furniture. As a matter of fact the Hilton Honors agent alerted us that's why we booked two rooms. Normally in U.S we can still fit in a two double bed room with our boys. The hotel was located in the Diagonal Mar district, which is a newly developing area on the northern side of the city along the water. There's an access to the beach couple blocks away from the hotel if you walk over the bridge/ walkway crossing the highway. We used the executive lounge for our breakfasts and evening drinks and tapas before going out to dinner. The staff was extremely polite and helpful.They were almost apologetic to warn us for the closing times.Just across the street from the hotel is the last stop for the Bus Touristic. It is the best way  to see the city and get oriented. We took it 2days in a row. We saw almost all the important neighborhoods and touristic highlights being on the bus, and hopping on and off and listening to audio tour. My kids learned so much about the architecture and history of Barcelona they started their own trivia game. There's also a big mall just across the street that you can find some Spanish brands and shop for necessities.There are couple generic restaurants on the patio of the mall too. You can have a bite if you have to. The best feature was the swimming pool. We were getting tired after visiting couple attractions or museums, we were spending the afternoons lounging by the pool and soaking the mediterranean sun. We had a very relaxing vacation and left Barcelona with a very good feeling.",5,2009,01,03
36,Great hotel,"I stayed at the Hilton with my family. The only problem we had was that we booked two adjoining rooms but we were given two  separate ones on the same floor because the hotel was booked. We stay on one of the concierge floors which gives you access to the concierge lounge. The lounge offers complementary traditional spanish breakfast in the morning and snacks throughout the day. Also bottled water, soda, and Spanish beers were complementary. The lounge has a large patio which has a gorgeous view of Barcelona. The rooms were very clean; the hotel seemed very new. The pool was clean and modern and I believe there may have been a lifeguard.",5,2008,12,14
36,Wonderful Stay for our Honeymoon!,"I utilized my Hilton Honors points to stay at the Diagonal Mar for my honeymoon in May 2008. As a diamond member, the hotel provided me with a room on one of the executive levels. My wife and I were VERY happy with the executive lounge. We had a continental breakfast every morning and the lounge was open for cocktails and light appetizers in the evening. The lounge has a great view of the city. 

The rooms were not very large, but they were clean and well appointed in a modern style. We were greated by the Hilton with desserts and champagne in recognition of our honeymoon stay. 

The hotel is located just two blocks from the metro station. We just walked straight through the adjacent mall to get there. We felt safe walking there during all hours of the day and night. Although the hotel isn't located in the heart of the city, we didn't find it an inconvenience as the metro is fast and very easy to navigate. It didn't take long at all to get to our desired locations. 

It took me a year to acquire the points needed to stay there and it was well worth it for me. We were able to take a cruise right out of the Barcelona port.",4,2008,12,10
36,very quiet but very nice,"stayed for two nights metro station 5 minutes walk ,beech 5 minutes walk for me a nice location ,hotel quite large stayed on exec floor very good value drinks food ect the rest of the hotel is very quiet ,staff very good all in all i would return no problem",5,2008,11,24
36,Hidden Charges; No free wi-fi,"While the room looked well I was extremely disappointed to discover internet access was not included.  This was exacerbated by the fact the room description said, ""high speed internet"".  When I pointed this out to the staff they said something to the effect that it says you have a tv, but that you still have to pay for movies.  It cost an extra €120 to have internet access the 5 nights I was there.

In addition, there is no tea or coffee making service in the room.  Newspaper is not delivered to the door.  A minibar beer is €8.  A roomservice hamburger is €15.

For me I don't care about the fancy sink or a wood paneling.  I found the extra charges I was paying atop a premium rate annoying.  Having stayed in many business hotels, I would not recommend this hotel as they do not cater for you.  If you are a tourist, find somewhere closer to downtown unless you plan to eat in the food court every night or can afford €15 burgers.",1,2008,11,17
36,Enjoyed My Stay,"Stayed here for 5 nights in November as I was attending a conference next door at the CCIB.
If you are to ever stay at a Hilton, join the HHonours club as it is free and you get little upgrades which are handy.
The check-in was quick and easy. The chap who booked us in spoke excellent English and was very polite. He even turned someone away who pushed infront of us! I liked that :)

The room I had was very nice on the 12th floor. It had two single beds (fine as I was a lone traveller) and flat screen TV and a view of the port / sea. Don't be fooled by the photographs on the Hilton website - the hotel is a fair few metres form the beach...there is a big road to get past first!
The bathroom was big and clean with nice towels, two dressing gowns and slippers. One thing that did put me off was someone had graffitied the word DEATH on the architrave in the bathroom. This kind of shocked me when I noticed it at 1 in the morning after a few beers! Hilton - please sort this!!!!
On one day the hotel lost all water / water pressure, which meant I had an awkward shower! The hotel did apologise with a letter and box of chocolates which as ok
Worst thing about the hotel is the prices. 24 Euro for breakfast is a con, 27 Euro for internet access (which was rubbish) and 7 Euro for a beer. Extortion! 
The shopping center across the road is really good, loads of restaurants and shops - enough to please everyone.
All in all a good hotel - I'd definitely come back, but not to pay for breakfast or use the internet!",4,2008,11,15
36,Excellent for Family with Small Children,"We would highly reccomend this hotel for families with small children.  One of the reasons we booked the hotel was for its pool which we confirmed was open in late October.  However, when we arrived we were told it was already closed for the year.  The manager personally contacted us, look for alternatives nearby and upgraded us to the executive lounge, gave us free breakfest, etc.  I was very satisfied with the management response.  

The beach is located very nearby and less than a 5 minutes walk.  We enjoyed the beach very much.  Easy 10 minute metro ride to all sites in the city.

The staff was excellent and very nice to our two young children.  Great reccomendations from staff on where to eat.

Breakfest was very good and one of the better hilton breakfests we have been at in Europe.",5,2008,11,09
36,It was okay,"We stayed for 6 nights on an award stay in early October.  Something was just missing.  I stayed at the Conrad Dublin in the recent past and it beat this hotel by a MILLION times.  Anyway, the staff seemed generally nice but very mediocre and not necessarily competent.  We were ""upgraded"" to one of the executive floors as a Diamond Hilton member.  You don't get a better room for that...you just get access to the lounge.  The lounge was a good deal b/c there was a pretty good supply of alcohol but the food (breakfast and evening tapas got old quick -- and if that previous poster is correct that they seriously cut back on these in the past two weeks, this is a total bust).  The hotel room was nice but small.  I liked the hardwood floors and the modern look.  Some of the minuses:  Front desk refused to break change for two 50EU bills we had (only asked for 20's and 10's) b/c there were two NBA teams coming in later that night!!! Wow, thanks a bunch for your customer service.  Whatever.  I also didn't like coming in at night and not seeing ANYONE working in the lobby (they were somewhere in the back) and they also turn off almost all of the lights!!!  Heck, doesn't Motel 6 leave the light on?  So much for security.  Of course they left the lights on the night the NBA teams showed up.   Hmpf.  There was no free internet access, which I would think they would at least provide for Hilton Honors members (Conrad Dublin does it for EVERYONE!).  Luckily, I planned most of the trip beforehand, so I didnt need to find info. on the net.  Anyway, the hotel was okay but something was just missing.  I wouldn't spend the $ they ask for, and I'd even reconsider spending the Hilton points I used for this hotel.  It really is a 3 1/2 star hotel.",2,2008,11,07
36,"Diagonal Mar, beyond par!","Great Hotel -not exactly near the beach, as there are buildings and a main road in front, but great sea views from hotel
We went for a long weekend - found staff to be excellent and very friendly, room [executive] comfortable, very clean and high standard  -robe and slippers etc provided-and the executive floor extras were wonderful- we dined well with full english breakfast, and local delicacies. and could have been permanently drunk and full to bursting with what they provided all day included in the price!!  It is difficult to drag yourself away from the place -it is very relaxing.
Restaurants in Hotel lovely, and across the road, shopping mall with lots of eating places too -only draw back was it was a way out from the centre, so we used readily available taxis quite a lot to get to las ramblas area.
Went to see Barcelona play- very enjoyable.
Barcelona is a lovely place to visit -you should go, and I would highly recommend a top class stay at the Hilton Diagonal mar!",4,2008,11,04
36,"Wonderful service ,Nice Hotel","I was worried as the hotel was out of the main city but the it only took a few minutes to reach the center of town on the metro (which was frequent and easy to use ) the only reason it took so long to get into town was that we couldnt help looking at the shops in the wonderful shopping center we had to walk through on the way to the station .
The service was wonderful .Russel the concierge was very friendly and full of useful information .The front desk were helpful and made you feel welcome 
 The breakfast was very good nothing missing ,it all looked very appetising , they do not advertise but you can order omlettes etc from the kitchen if you want and the tables are being cleaned  all the time and all the staff were smiling and friendly 
 We didnt eat in the hotel as you have so many restaurants to choose from over the road and some days we stayed in town 
 Even when we went to check out and there had been a misunderstanding on our booking (from the front desk )and we were locked out of our room and when they opened it the room had not been done for our last night every one was so nice we didnt complain .
 I would recommend this hotel to friends and family",4,2008,11,04
36,A1. And lovely walk into town along beach front. Barcelona for grown ups,"Booked this as wanted relaxing city break. Last visit stayed at Hotel D'Arts - and this was as nice. Had an executive room - which I think was worth the extra money. Had access to lounge and terrace - overlooking sea with free rein on drinks and snacks. If you want a 'chill-out' weekend for rest and relaxation - where you can walk into Barcelona (about 40 -50 mins walk along sea front) at your leisure - this hotel is for you. We spent the daytime in the centre of Barcelona doing standard tourist activities, but didnt want to party the nights away. Highly recommend . Staff on front desk were excellent. Room (corner room - so views on 2 sides of room) was excellent. Sat in the bath and could see the sea. Gym is smallish and the hotel pool was chilly. But lovely clean beach - less than 5 min walk. If you fancy a chuckle - nudist beach short walk from hotel (you pass it if you walk on the beach itself into town). Visited at end of Sept 08 and had total sunshine all weekend. I want to work for Sanofi - see pic - what great office location.",5,2008,11,01
36,"Executive Lounge bad now under ""New Policy""","Diagonal Mar used to be nice hotel with good service quality and nice Executive Lounge...  I stayed there recently during private trip, at Executive room Oct.25-30, 2008. Room was pre-paid using AmEx Gold card. One of main reasons for me to choose this hotel was my own good experience during my stay there in August, 2008, and good reports from other travellers. Unfortunately things have changed dramatically during last few days of October, 2008 and seems that good times at Diagonal are over forever.

Hilton Diagonal had nice Executive Lounge policy regarding beverages - a good choice of different drinks were available during most part of the day in the lounge, from noon until 11pm. BEWARE! this unfortunately has changed as of October 29, 2008, without any previous warning even for current guests. They still offer some drinks free in Executive Lounge but now only during 6pm - 8:30pm and the choice has significantly decreased. 

Food quality in the lounge has also deteriorated. Breakfest quality has become almost non-existant now - not a single hot item anymore, no bacon, no eggs, no sausages, nothing. That's in Executive Lounge, folks! It costs some real money! Even simple bread and butter were in short supply Oct.30, 2008 in the morning. Thanks God it was my last ""breakfest"" at Diagonal.

I was told by Manager Merche Aragones that this is their ""new policy"". Seemed to me that she was not capable (or not willing) to understand that sudden cancellation or significant worsening of pre-paid services is A Bad Thing.",2,2008,10,31
36,wonderful Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona,"I stayed six nights on vacation. New hotel, very chic, lovely spacious room.  Helpful staff, plenty that speak English. Hotel breakfast was great, mainly buffet but with loads of hot and cold food. The hotel has a pool and sun deck, the beach is one block away and across a road. The city centre is an easy bus, metro or tram ride. Area felt safe and fairly quiet. If you want to eat outside of the hotel, there is a choice of restaurants across the road (inside and outside eateries) in very pleasant shopping mall. The mall has all types of shops, a cinema and a supermarket.",5,2008,10,23
36,Deceitful Hilton in Barcelona from Front Desk up to Hotel Manager,"On arrival, we were informed that someone had changed our reservation in their system from a King Executive with breakfast to Standard Room and that the best they could do was give us a smoking King Executive. Well, I am 7 months pregnant! Informed them that this substitution was unacceptable. After 20 minutes of discussion, they finally offered us an ""upgrade"" to a Relaxation Room which is 50 Euros less per night relative to the King Executive Room. The front desk initally refused to print out a statement showing no additional charges and room type they provided us. After escalating the matter, I was finally given a print out. Lucky me, because upon return I contacted Expedia for a refund on the price difference and Hilton customer service in the US and hotel management at Diagonal Mar (front desk to hotel Manager, Ignacio Rodriguez) insisted that we were given the King Executive room. Without evidence that the staff at Diagonal Mar had been less than honest, Expedia would have refused to pursue our claim and informed me as much. Actually, I am not thrilled with either Expedia or Hilton and expect better service from both. On the positive side, the room was comfortable and had a nice view.",2,2008,10,21
36,Very Luxurious,"I stayed here for two days and wished I could have stolen more than just a pair of slippers. The bed was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. I'm still longing for that bed. The executive lounge on the 15th floor was fantastic, with an open bar practically all day. I could have used a little more variety in the afternoon snacks, however - it was all desserts. 

Internet access is atrociously expensive but I found that to be true at every European hotel I stayed at. I guess I'm just used to it being free in U.S. hotels. The staff was very polite and the location is okay - right across the street from a huge mall and about a five minute walk from a Metro stop. 

All amenities were great. Very comfortable, very relaxing atmosphere.",5,2008,10,15
36,"Solid business class hotel, okay for tourists","I stayed at this hotel on business including use of one of the meeting rooms.  The service was excellent, consistent with what one would expect from a first class busiess hotel.  The rooms are modern and cofortable, many with a view of the Mediteranean.  Consistent with most European hotels WiFi internet access is available but expensive.
The hotel offers a very nice buffet breakfast and the restaurant has a small outside balcoy.
The hotel is less than a block from the beach, with a major road in between.  Beach access is an easy 5 minute walk.
A large shopping mall is directly across the street and metro and streetcar access is just over a block away.  
Barcelona has an extensive metro which provides convenient access to most tourist sites.  The fare is 1.30e for one ticket or a ten use ticket, which can be used for several people, is 6.70e.",4,2008,09,27
36,Beautiful hotel,"This is a very lovely hotel in Barcelona.  It was truly one of the nicest hotel rooms I have ever stayed in, and I have traveled all over the world.  The room was spotlessly clean with beautiful hardwood floors and very contemporary, modern furniture including flat screen tv's etc.  This is not some outdated hotel.  My husband is a Hilton rewards member so we were able to go to the executive lounge for drinks, tapas, snacks and it was delicious and well presented.  We did not eat in the restaurant there, choosing to go to a restaurant across the street in the mall so I cannot comment on the food served other than in the executive lounge.  We did have drinks in the lobby bar and that was great.  Everyone we spoke to were very nice and helpful and spoke great English which was helpful.  We only stayed 1 night as we were on layover from a cruise, so we didn't have a chance to explore much of Barcelona, but I could tell this was a little off the beaten track, not right in the heart of things, but there was a nice mall right across the street with several restaurants that was nice.  I would love to return to Barcelona someday and explore it further, and I would not hesitate to stay at this wonderful hotel.",5,2008,09,23
36,Loved this hotel,"We stayed in this Hotel for 6 nights mid August.  We had a lovely
spacious room and were delighted to discover, on our arrival, that our rate included breakfast.
We had our 7 year old son with us so the roof top pool was great.
The hotel is a little outside of the City but the metro is so close by.
The tram just down the road takes you right outside the entrance to the zoo (last stop).  
We went by train to Sitges for the day - a beautiful seaside town which we really enjoyed.
Across the road from the Hotel is a very large Shopping Centre.
Top floor dedicated to Restaurants with something for everyone.
Hotel staff very helpful and friendly.  We had a lovely time here and will be back.",4,2008,09,21
36,Great Hilton in a great location,"We stayed here for 3 nights early on in our 2 week Spain trip.  The hotel is very much business oriented so it is situated next to the convention center and shopping mall, close to the water but a little off the beaten path.  There are several metro stops nearby and the tourist bus stops just across the street.  The hotel is really modern and the staff is extremely helpful.  Parking is onsite but is $36 euro per day (their website says $36 USD per day so check it when you check in).  We had a room on the executive level which was key.  We had access to the executive level lounge on the 15th floor where you could have breakfast (with eggs, meats, pastries, coffee, juices), snacks and drinks during the day and tapas, wine or liquor at night.  We saved a lot of money not having to purchase breakfast every day.  The room was spacious with plenty of closet space, a large bathroom with tub and separate shower, and comfortable bed and pillows.  My fiance went to the gym most nights and said it was fairly large with multiple machines and weights.  The pool area was gorgeous and very secluded with a pool bar.  We didn't eat at the restaurant in the hotel, choosing to explore the various areas in Barcelona.  The convenience of having the shopping mall across the street was also nice as my fiance broke his sunglasses on our 2nd day in Spain.  He was able to find a replacement easily.  Plus, the mall had several tapas bars and restaurants in it for an easy lunch or snack.  I would definitely go back!",4,2008,09,21
36,Not Bad but nothing special,"The hotel is located in the Avenida Diagonal at approximately 3 km from the city center but and they do not have a shuttle service.
The closest underground station is at 1 km from the hotel.
As I said overall the hotel has nothing special, rooms are a bit old but cleaned as the hotel in general. Hilton Breakfast is very good. The Hotel Staff is not particularly warm and do not smile often.",3,2008,09,16
36,Great Hotel,"Spent 5 nights at this hotel 24th to 29th August. All staff very friendly and welcoming. Room on 11th floor spacious and comfortable and you get a dressing gown each. Hadnt thought we got breakfast in the deal we got but on arrival found we did and this was definitely a highlight! Lots to choose from and kept you full up all day.
On arrival at the Airport  bought a T10 ticket which gives you 10 journeys and can be used by 2 people, you dont need one each! Caught the overground train to Estacia de Franco where the line finishes anyway. A short walk round the corner from the station takes you to the Metro and you can then get a single tube train to El Maresme Forum which is about a 400m walk from the Hilton Hotel.Trains very clean and very efficient.
We bought a two day ticket for the open top bus tour at 26 euros each.This was a great way to see all the sights.There are 3 different bus routes so you have to get off the bus to change routes but there werent huge queues.
The Hotel is close to the beach and in the mornings we jogged along the beach front with many other joggers and it takes you all the way along the 5 seperated beaches.
Hotel pool area and gym very nice indeed
Hotel was full of both tourists and also quite a lot of business people on some bonding team event but this meant the pool area during the daytime was quiet and relaxing.
All in all a lovely stay, being outside the main hustle and bustle of the town centre was ideal.",5,2008,09,07
36,Fantastic for Families,"We adored this hotel. Stayed here in August 2008 for a week with my husband and four children. The hotel is beautiful and the staff were really helpful. We booked two rooms one for us and the baby (20 months) and the other for the our three other kids (13,11 and 4). The rooms were adjacent with an outer door you could lock so in effect it was like a little apartment. Best of all the kids room was half price so the cost compared very favourably with cheaper hotels which were charging the same price for each room.  

The hotel pool on the roof of the 1st floor is great, with a pool bar (quite expensive) and sun terrace. The rooms were spacious, spotless and really comfortable.

The location of the hotel is great. Its a bit out from the main tourist area but the metro is very close by and has a lift to the platform - great for us as we had two kids in buggies. We were easily able to get to all the sites quickly and cheaply.

The area around the hotel is lovely, modern and clean. It feels very safe and friendly even at night.

There is a lovely beach just a few blocks away which the kids loved.  
Right across from the hotel is a fantasitic shopping centre with 3 floors. The top floor is all restaurants so there is something for everyone, from MacDonalds and Subway, to Spanish tapas and a great fish restaurant. It even has a great games arcade, which our kids loved, 10 pin bowling, a cinema and an adventure play area. 

All in all I would totally recommend this hotel for a family holiday as it offers a beach holiday with the city on your door step. We will definately be going back.",5,2008,09,06
36,wonderful stay at the Hilton Diagonal Mar,"We arrived at the Hilton the day before our cruise. Unfortunately, our luggage didn't make our connecting flight. The Hilton staff couldn't have been more helpful with phoning the luggage delivery service, the port and guiding us to stores where we could purchase some supplies in case our luggage was missing for the week. The large, and beautiful mall across the street had the everything we needed and the hotel even called a sports store there to check to see if they had an item our 16 year old son needed. The service was just phenomenal.

The hotel is just a long block or so to the beach. Beautiful place to relax. There is also a wonderful park just up the street with art work and a pond. 

The hotel itself was modern and in good shape. We arrived on the early side and they gave us a complimentary drink until our room was ready. Our deluxe room was well-sized and had great views of the sea and the city. There was plenty of room for the 3 of us. Only complaint was that the carpeting looked a little frayed where it met the hardwood floor entrance. No big deal but I suppose I should complain about something.

In the morning we wanted coffee and a light breakfast. We ended up in the Breakfast room which served a hefty and pricey breakfast. (The dollar couldn't have been lower compared to the Euro.) I explained that I only wanted coffee and we would have our son eat. The manager insisted that we all eat and he would only charge for 2. In the end the Manager waived all costs. They were so nice and my son and husband loved their breakfasts!

All-in-all we'd stay there again in a heartbeat.",5,2008,09,04
36,One of the best hotels I have stayed in,"I tend not to stay more than one or two nights in any one hotel. I only use hotels if I am on the move or staying for a short break.  Otherise I prefer self-catering.  So if the hotel has a flaw - noisy, bad beds, not clean - I don't have to put up with it for too long. 

On this occasion I stayed five nights at the Hilton Diagonal Mar and loved every minute of it.  I have stayed at a number of Hiltons, many of which are not of great standard, but the standard of this hotel is very high indeed.

Rooms - big, clean, with silent air-conditioning.  The hotel goes up to 23 floors, but mercifully our room was on the 9th with a lovely sea view.  

Staff - As befits the hotel chain of the english-speaking peoples, all the staff spoke english. Everyone was very pleasant and efficient.

Restaurant - We ate in the restaurant one night on the terrace and it was a good experience, although the portions are pretentiously small.  The crema catalana is recommended.  As always, the food and drink in the Hilton hotel is overpriced, but there is plenty of choice round about.

Pool - the pool area is wonderful.  The pool is not large, but there were never many people in it so it did not feel crowded.  Plenty of comfortable loungers and seating and good bar facilities.  

Location - despite the fact that it is out of the centre, I liked the location.  It is quiet and well laid out.  There is a very large shopping centre directly across the road with a whole level devoted to eating so plenty of choice for meals - including McDonalds for those with difficult to please children.  There are also some smaller restaurants, bars and cafes in the surrounding area.  The shopping centre has a large supermarket downstairs, which is handy to know.  The beach is only a few minutes walk away.  The metro is easily reached and takes only about 15 minutes to reach Passeig de Gracia.  Also plenty of taxis available outside the hotel all day long.  We took a taxi to Park Guell for about 8 euros.

Another great feature of the hotel was the other guests.  A really great mix of considerate, friendly and (dare I say it) unrowdy people, including many families with amazingly well-behaved children.  This all contributed to making the experience so enjoyable.

The only complaint is that there is not tea or coffee making facilities - but when I asked for a kettle one was brought rightaway.",4,2008,08,26
36,Very enjoyable stay,"Just returned from a very enjoyable 5 day (4 nights) break at the Hilton Diagonal Mar with my partner and her 18 year old daughter

Efficient and very friendly service, very comfortable inter-connecting rooms on the 7th floor – excellent gym and pool area – returning to the pool each evening after a day walking around the city was very enjoyable. 

Good location out on the fringe of the city – the area is well served by bus, metro or tram all within a short walk of the hotel – there is also a taxi rank directly opposite the hotel.

Very large shopping complex across the road with an assortment of cafes and bars – most of the eateries here though are very average (and the service desultory at best) apart from the pescado which we found to be quite good.

We particularly enjoyed returning to the hotel lobby late at night for a pot of tea and a nightcap or two before hauling ourselves off to bed – they must have had only one teapot in the lobby bar with no lid although they did do their best (much to our amusement) to improvise using drink coasters, saucers etc – on our fourth and final night the barman rummaged around and triumphantly found the missing lid (rather spoiling our fun).

Late check out was arranged for us at no extra charge – all of the staff without exception seemed to take a pride in creating a welcoming and friendly atmosphere.

One word of warning (and something the concierge mentioned to us) – be careful when out and about – we caught a pick-pocket brazenly plying his trade in the check in queues at the airport – although Barcelona is a great city to wander around you do need to exercise a bit of street sense and be careful with your wallet, passport, phone, camera etc",5,2008,08,26
36,Excellent experience,"This is a new Hilton, at the east end of the Diagonal (there is an older Hilton at the west end).
It is near the sea, just in front of the large shopping center ""Diagonal Mar"" (many restaurants, cinemas etc.).
The hotel is a modern tower (23 floors).
Well, it is a modern Hilton and everything is expected to be up to the name of the chain.
I was particularly lucky to be in a corner room on an executive floor (21st).
Since the hotel is at the east end of diagonal and I had the view to the town, I really could overview the whole city, see the Agbar tower, the Sagrada Familia,  the Mapfre and Arts towers, the sea etc.

Anyway the room was very large, with a large bathroom.

Everything perfect.

There is underground parking with direct access via elevator to the lobby.

There are taxis just in front of the hotel and they take just a few euros for any destination in the town.",5,2008,08,21
36,You won't be disappointed!,"From the minute I arrived until the minute I left I received superior service from the staff at this hotel.  I travel 80% of the time for business, stay at any number of Hilton and Hilton family hotels every year, and can honestly say this is the best I have ever been treated at any hotel.

My stay was booked on hotel points, and like other reviewers I was given the upgrade to the Executive floor.  As a veteran of many Executive lounges in the US I can tell you that my expectations weren't set too high, but they were easily exceeded and then some.  Breakfast, drinks & tapas certainly helped to make this a very affordable stop on my tour of Spain!  The staff were friendly and courteous, and genuinely helpful with directions and advice on how to get the most out of my stay.

Imagine rounding the corner from the elevator to an enthusiastic personal greeting from Patrick, your concierge, and being directed to take your pick of any table and oh yes - what's your drink of choice?  If it's not too hot head outside to enjoy the view of both sea & city, and wait for Patrick to do all the work checking you in!

Once you can tear yourself away, head to your room to revel in it's modern appointments - if you need it and it's not already there just pick up the phone and I'm sure they'll get it for you.

The housekeeping was respectful and attentive - I especially enjoyed the turn down service & little card with the next day's weather forcast - a nice touch!  On my last day I left my luggage at the hotel while touring around before a late flight out, and when I arrived back at the hotel wilted from the summer heat I headed to the fitness center to freshen up.  The housekeeper working in that area set me up to have a shower & change with as much comfort as possible in the somewhat cramped locker room - it was clear she just wanted me to be happy!

I enjoyed the pool & lounge area - including an ice-cold towel at the exact moment when I thought I could not stand the heat for another second - how did they do that?!  I didn't take advantage of the spa services, although they were certainly tempting.  

Although initially concerned that the location was a bit out of the way, it was no problem at all thanks to the bus touristic and metro across the street.  It was great to be able to amble over to the beach as easily as hop on a train to the center of the action - love having a choice!  The shopping center across the street offers good options to the somewhat pricey on-site dining options, if you can't be bothered to venture into the heart of town for some turly divine cuisine.

I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at this property and would happily recommend it as a nice little refuge from the hustle & bustle of Barcelona!  If you're booking your stay on points you will receive much more bang for your buck, so to speak, than using the same number of points at properties in the US.  Enjoy!",5,2008,08,19
36,Amazing Hotel,"Stayed 4 nights in August 2008 and had a really good experience.  Got a really good rate direct which was less than half the rack rate and although it said it did not include breakfast I was told that it did when we arrived.  The rooms are very large and come as they are shown on the website.  Request a high floor as we stayed on the 18th floor and the view was amazing.  The hotel is less than 3 years old and so everything is still new and is much better than the other Hilton in Barcelona which is much older.  The front desk were very helpful and as you would expect all spoke perfect English.  They were happy to help and no request was too much trouble. The gym is small but well equipped and the pool is very nice to relax in.

The location is away from the main centre of the city but this is very much in its favour as Barcelona is not too big and there is a metro station (El Maresme Forum) 5 mins away through the large shopping centre opposite the hotel.  It is also on the tram route. There is also a nice beach nearby and the location is very peaceful and safe.  I have not stayed in the centre but from going round there at night it is probably very busy.

There is a large supermarket in the shopping centre which is very convenient as drinks are very pricey in the Hilton although they do supply you with 2 bottles of free water everyday.

The open topped tourist buses also stop opposite the hotel and they are worth the 20 euros for a day ticket.  They are a good way to get your bearings of were the sights are and we actually got to use a lot of the vouchers they give you with your ticket.  So it is better to use this bus early in your stay.  The Hotel is on the green route which is the shortest of the tourist bus routes but you can switch to the red and blue routes which cover all the sights.  It is worth going on all three routes in one day then going back to the sights you really want to spend time at.  You'll definitely want to visit the Sagrada Familia, try to get there reasonably early as it does get busy and definitely go up in the lift the views you get of Barcelona and the details of the building are easily worth the money.  The spiral stair case on the way down is a sight to behold but you can get the lift if you are scared of heights.  After this Gaudi's Casa Batillo on the Passieg de Garcia was the most memorable sight we visited and well worth putting aside an afternoon for.

There are lots of places to eat in Barcelona just be aware some close in August and most will close either Sunday or Monday as well.

I would recommend Can Paxiano, Carrer de la Reina Cristina, if you need a snack and are near Barceloneta.  There is no sign and it is surrounded by electronic stores but the atmosphere is busy and always full of tourists an locals alike.  Just fight your way to the bar and order two glasses of the rose cava and a bocadilllo or tapas and that will keep you going for a while, the pork, ham and liver pate bocadillo was amazing (lomo, foie y york) worth the trip alone.

Barcelona was an amazing place and probably needs a full week to do it justice and we would definitely go back and stay at the Hilton Diagonal Mar.",5,2008,08,15
36,Decent Hotel,"Very nice hotel.

Modern and comfortable, sits at the end of Avenida Diagonal on the Barcelona seafront 5 minutes walk away from the beach (not the best beach in the Med but its ok). Also opposite a 3 floor shopping centre that seem's to cater for most shopping need's (a bit upscale - none of the usual cheap Spanish leather goods).

Its done out in the usual Hilton style, comfortable beds, a bit minimalist but it all works ok. Nice pool, albeit with plenty of kids running round (one of them was mine) which I know can be annoying if you're on business. Also the pool gets shaded by some surrounding office blocks early in the morning. There's a gym and a business centre and a nice lounge as well.

Food and bars are expensive as you would expect in a 5 star hotel in Europe - watch out especially for the bottled water - I think I spent circa 60 euro's on it in four days!

Very good staff, I couldn't fault them, all well turned out, friendly and efficient.

The hotel tends to cater more for our German ""friends"" as does most of Spain so expect the TV channel's to be dominated by German programmes (a bit annoying watching the Olympics with a German commentator) but its just a minor point - but get to those sunbeds early!

The only very slight negative is the surrounding area which has some rather uninspiring office blocks and somehow manages to look a bit downbeat when actually its all fairly decent. Maybe they need a new architect in this part of town.

Getting around is very easy - Taxis are cheap and there's a rank next to the hotel.

Al in all a very good hotel.",4,2008,08,14
36,Jaw dropping excellence,"We booked through Priceline and got an already amazing deal ($100/night), but when we checked in the young lady at the counter (Juana) offered us a very smart upgrade. For an extra 63 Euro ($103) we not only moved up to an executive suite, but it granted us entry to the executive lounge. That wasn't a fancy name to make us feel better about spending the extra money it was actually quite the cost savings. Everyday we were served breakfast and tapas that easily worked as lunch and dinner. Not to mention a full open bar, and plenty of teas and coffees. My friend and I were blown away. We would still go out later in the evening to either Las Ramblas or Port Olympico and have something to eat so we had tasted the local paella and other dishes, but saving the money on most of our food and drinks was just perfect. 

The views were breathtaking, the beds were all consuming comfortable, the bathroom came with robes and slippers, the maids had to have come in 4 or 5 times a day. If we ate the chocolate on our pillows, they came in and replaced them! It's like they knew when we were in and when we were out. 

I only got to spend one afternoon by the pool, but it was amazing. From masseurs walking around offering 5 minute massages and a bar 10 steps away, I couldn't have been happier. The hotel was close to the underground station as well as a Hop on Hop off Bus point so public transportation was great. There was also a bank right across the street for pulling out Euro and shops all around.

Honestly, I don't know what their normal rates are, but for what I paid I was more than spoiled and couldn't imagine staying anywhere else whenever I'm in Barcelona.",5,2008,08,03
36,"Great rooms, poor desk staff, poor breakfast","There is nothing wrong with the ""hardware"" of this hotel. The rooms are great, location also, across large shopping mall, near sea, great for families. It is the staff that may spoil your stay.
At the desk, while you are helped, they answer questions from newly arrived people, walk away, pick up the phone and talk endlessly, and the seem not interested at all to help you.
Simple questions like directions are answered with great reluctance if at all. They do not seem to listen well. I asked for a direction to a village that was 10 min drive away, and they printed me a direction of 165 km, without a correcting response to our remark that it was really a 10 min drive. We ended looking up the directions ourself at a paid computer. 
Breakfast for the more expensive rooms on the 15 floor was terrible esp in the weekends: crowded space, not enough choices, not enough food, and you had to ask for glasses and plates, as they did not put enough out.  And all this for 400 euro per night!
Waste of money, and i will never return.",2,2008,08,01
36,Great hotel to end a Europe trip!,"This was the last stop on a 10 day Europe trip with my 17 year old daughter, and the Hilton Diagonal mar Barcelona was a great hotel to end the trip with.  We were staying on points, but since I'm a HHonors Diamond member they upgraded us anyway!  I found the staff to be friendly.  Executive rooms are roomy and the bed was one of the most comfortable I've slept on - anywhere!  The club lounge has a great view and is open all day.  We didn't spend any time at the pool, but the pool area and pool bar looked like a great place to hang out for an afternoon.  The hotel is a 5 min walk to the east end of the beach. 

If taking a cab from the airport to the hotel, be very clear to your taxi driver that you're going to the Hilton Diagonal mar Barcelona.  Give him the exact address.  This property is not located on Avenue Diagonal, but the other Hilton property is - only it's 10km or so to the northwest of where you really want to be.  Unfortunately we were dropped first at the wrong property, then had to cab it down Avenue Diagonal to the correct hotel.  It was a nice tour but another €20 that I would have preferred not to have spent.  I learned later that the tram runs all the way down Avenue Diagonal and would have been much less expensive than the taxi fare.

The hotel is near a nice mall, but is a ways from La Rambla and the port.  I was somewhat concerned about the location when I booked the room, but given the wonderful and varied modes of public transportation available in Barcelona it worked out to be a perfect place to stay!  The Bus Toursitic and Metro stops are very close by.

I would recommend this property and would stay here again.",5,2008,07,27
36,Contemporary and Spacious,"A clean, modern and convenient new hotel.

I checked in for three nights at the diagonal mar barcelona, only a stones throw from the beaches, and in the heart of a shopping/leisure area.  

The hotel is impressive with a chic and cavernous lobby.  The service was good.  The hotel is a tall building with great views of the city, however be aware that a sea view involves looking at the sea in between a couple of very large, close office blocks behind the hotel.  

The bedroom was contemporary and clean whith a very stylish bathroom.  Space was not a problem anywhere in this hotel, if anything, they had too much of it (July is a quiet time for business hotels such as this one) and it felt a bit empty.  

We tried the bar after dinner one night, and though it was dissapointingly empty, we braved the high prices and tried out the cocktails - great friendly service, though watch out for the upselling.

The pool and decking area were fantastic, and once we got over the feeling we were sandwiched between tower blocks, we enjoyed both swimming and food at the poolside bar.  

We glanced at the restaurant menu and decided to give its extortionate prices a wide berth (30 euros for one main course, a two course meal for two with a drink would have cost over 100 euros).  There are plenty of average restaurants out on the shopping centre complex next door, though I highly recommend wandering around the old streets of Barri Gotic at around 9pm when all the local Catalan restaurants come to life.

We enjoyed good service at all times during our stay at diagonal mar.  The hotel was built for the exhibition/conference customer rather than the tourist, however with good transport links and such a great beach near by, I would recommend it to all.",4,2008,07,25
36,Amazing Hotel,"Stay here for our last 2 nights of our multi-city tour of Spain.  I am so happy we ended at such a great hotel.  During our trip we stayed at hotels that ranged from below average to above average.  We definitely needed to end on a positive note.  Nothing bad to say about the hotel.  Any amenity you need is provided.  Hotel staff was way above par.  Room was very, very comfortable.  And bathroom was clean and spacious.  We also had a great view from of the Mediterranean Sea.  Probably one of the nicest hotels I have ever stayed in, and definitely the best service I have ever received.",5,2008,07,22
36,Brilliant Barcelona,"Fantastic hotel, staff could not do enough for you, probably the best hotel I have ever been too.",5,2008,07,03
36,Another solid overseas Hilton,"As you would expect from an international Hilton, the hotel was in good shape with nice rooms and nice amenities.  As I've also come to expect, after you add in parking and internet service and various other charges, expect to pay another $100/day.

The hotel itself is located a 5-6k outside of the center of Barcelona, but is across from a decent mall and a short walk to the beach.  

Not a lot of interesting attractions or restaurants in the area, so I wouldn't recommend it if you're not going to a conference there--which appears to be one of its specialties",3,2008,06,16
36,Gorgeous hotel!,"We had a great stay at the Hilton! The room was a standard, non-club floor room on the 13th floor. We had a great view that overlooked the Mediterranean Sea and the hotel pool. Our room was spacious and clean, with a large modern bathroom. I really liked the power shower in the bathroom.

The hotel itself is modern and clean. The staff is friendly and helpful, and nothing is too much trouble. The Indigo Restaurant serves great food and wine, and has excellent service. The hotel pool and sundeck opened while we were there - we spent some great time out there enjoying the beautiful weather. The food and drinks from the pool bar were expensive but very good. I highly commend the staff of this hotel.

The only negative is that the hotel itself is a long distance from Barcelona attractions such as La Rambla, although there is a Metro station very close by. I did like that there was a mall right across the street, for all those little things you might have forgotten.

All in all, I would go back in a heartbeat.",5,2008,05,06
36,Reception Staff should all be fired!,"Very nice hotel except for the useless, unfriendly, arguementative and slow reception staff.  
Russell, the porters and the bar staff were excellent!

The reception staff ruined my stay in Barcelona therefore I would recommend NOT to stay in this hotel!",1,2008,04,30
36,Lovely Hotel,"We have just returned from a family city break to Barcelona, 2 adults and 1 child age 13. This is our second visit to the city and this time as we had our son with us we chose to stay at the Hilton, Diagonal Mar. Although slightly out of the way of the main part of the town, instead of being a burden it was actually a joy!. We had an executive room on the 3rd floor which was amply big enough for the 3 of us. Our rate included breakfast which is one of the best I have had, I would defy anyone not to find something to eat and if its not there I am sure they would find it for you!

The hotel is very modern and during the week caters more for the business market than the tourist market, but the staff were fantastic, especially Russell the Concierge who advised us on where to eat and how to travel around on the metro, he went out of his way to help us and make us feel very welcome. Having said that all of the staff were very friendly and nothing was too much trouble.

The easiest, quickest and cheapest method of getting around Barcelona is by the metro the stop closest to the hotel is a 5 minute walk away and takes you straight into the heart of old Barcelona, in the main we alighted at Barceloneta as this was easy access to Las Rambla. If in Barcelona for more than 1 day purchase a T10 ticket costs 7 euros 20 cents, and gives you 10 trips anywhere on the metro.

With a child we visited the Zoo which is well laid out and the Aquarium which is also worth seeing. In the evenings we ate at Can Majo in the Barceloneta area, a long standing seafood restaurant which was excellent especially if you like mussels. We also ate at the Hard Rock and Russell even managed to book us a table so that we didnt have to wait around which has very handy as it was very busy. On the last night we ate at Patagonia an excellent steak restaurant.

Although the weather at this time of year was not hot enough to spend time around the pool it was just right for walking around a city and sitting in the sunshine watching the world go by.

Would definitely return to both the hotel and Barcelona, nearly forgot to mention an excellent massive shopping centre right across the road from the hotel, any of you into Zara and Mango prices seemed to be slightly cheaper and different clothes to those at home.

Fantastic break all round !",5,2008,04,12
36,"dirty, dirty, dirty","Bad working ventilation and airco, dirty carpets !! They needed to remove the dirty carpets from the rooms (exec ut. rooms !!)
The beds are on wheels.  You'll arrive in the morning on the other side of your room.  Windows never cleaned. etc... Never again.  For the same price you have unexpected luxury in hotel Arts.",1,2008,03,27
36,Wonderful stay!,"My stay at the hotel was wonderful!  The rooms were very clean, well equiped, and most of all, the service was excellent!  The employees there were so friendly and accomodating even when we arrived early at 8am the day of check in, they accomdodated us w/in the hour!  If this hotel is within your price range, I would definitely recommend it!",5,2008,03,20
36,Very Good But With A Few Niggles,"Almost any discerning traveller would enjoy staying at this clean and modern hotel with friendly, helpful staff and impeccable service.  However, it is not cheap and while you get what you pay for, there were a number of issues, admittedly minor, which we felt fell short of our expectations and indeed of  the hotels own aspirations.
On two separate occasions housekeeping staff entered our bedroom without knocking.  This appeared to be more a case of bad manners rather than any institutional lack of training.  The tea/coffee pack in the bedroom provides only powder milk.  Surely a hotel of this standard could provide some form of liquid milk.  Equally, amongst all the American, European and Asian newspapers provided free in the lobby, a British paper would not be too much to ask.  Both computers installed in the lobby were out of order and although staff were aware of this, nothing seemed to be done about it.  The plug in the bathroom sink would not stay down and the heavy blind on the bedroom window needs a pelmet type arrangement to keep out the early morning light.  Hilton have a good product here but they really need to improve on these basic matters if they are to maintain their superior hospitality crown.",4,2008,03,16

36,First Class Hotel,"As a Manager in the industry, I know how challenging it can be deliver excelelnt service.  It also makes me very fussy when staying in other Hotels.

This Hotel is just First Class in every sense.  The Hotel is modern, clean and very comfortable.  The Bedrooms are spacious and have great views of the sea.

The staff are simply brilliant and go out of there way to make you comfortable.

Brekafast is also something else, with a huge choice.

Yes, the Hotel is slightly out of the City centre, but it is no big effort to make the 15 min trip by Metro.

One of the best Hotels I have stayed in for some time.",5,2008,03,01
36,Marvelous Hotel,"My husband and I stayed at the Hilton Diagonal Mar for a short weekend getaway in February.  This was not our first time in Barcelona and we decided we'd like to stay closer to the sea (even in February).  

Our room seemed larger than a typical european room, it had full-length windows along 2 walls of our room and had a great view of the sea.  Hardwood floors, desk, lounge chair, bath and stand-up shower.  Complimentary bottles of water in the room were a definite bonus.

The staff were also great and friendly.  They suggested some wonderful restaurants for lunch and dinner.  The exec lounge was one of the nicer lounges we have been in.  They offer cards and some board games if you want to relax outside of your room.  It also has a large balcony where you can enjoy your breakfast, afternoon tea or even cocktail.  They even offer blankets if the weather is a bit chilly and you want to stay outside!

The beach was in walking distance.  You can easily walk along the path to Port Olímpic where there are lovely restaurants, etc.  Across from the hotel is a large mall with movie theater, restaurants and many shops.  The metro stop is also easily accessible from the hotel (we liked cutting through the mall) and will take you directly to Las Ramblas.

We would definitely stay at this Hilton again and can't wait to go back during the summer months when we can spend more time on the beach!!",5,2008,02,21
36,"Nice Hotel, Nice Staff","If you want to be in the center of the city, this hotel is not for you.   The location is great for business travellers and cruisers.  If you desire the center city main attractions i.e. La Ramblas, Placa de Catalunya, Sangunde de Familia you are only a few minutes away by taxi - approximately 15 minutes.  I found the hotel to be very clean and modern.  The only disappointment was the shower could use recaulking.  The bathroom is very spacious - separate shower, separate bath.  The bed is very comfortable.  The cable in the room is quite nice.  When you have travelled all over Europe you expect only CNN.  There were at least 7 channels in English including FOX.  The hotel's bar is very nice.  We encountered one of the best bartender's in Europe, Christina.  She makes the best Sangria!  Julian's Sangria's are a delicious treat too!",4,2008,02,19
36,Excellent Barcelona Hotel,"We stayed here on our trip over the New Year's.  This was an excellent hotel.  The beds were comfortable, the bathroom was spacious, and the rooms were very quiet.  We had an ocean-view room of the mediterranean sea.  The Diagonal Mar Mall is directly across the street and it came in handy when I lost my contact lens case.  They have a great food court there if you get hungry.  It is about a 10 min walk to get to the nearest metro stop and the hotel is about 20 mins outside the old town of barcelona.  The chocolate con churros in Barcelona is the best!",5,2008,01,12

Staff very nice. Executive Lounge excellent and room had great views.",5,2007,12,29
36,Fantastic hotel on the Med,"We booked this hotel from comments and ratings on tripadvisor. We flew into Barcelona November 30th, a day before our cruise for the Brilliance of the Seas transatlantic. This hotel is on the Med and not too far from the port. It is a distance from the Las Ramblas, but a short taxi ride will take you there. The hotel is spectacular in appearance. It is very modern. The staff is fantastic and gave us a great room overlooking the Med. The room was very modern. Had a flat screen TV, great bedding, wonderful shower and lots of ammenities. There was a shopping mall across the street. It had lots of restaurants inside and out, both sit down and fast food. There was a large grocery store on the lower level where we stocked up on bottled water for the ship. We had breakfast the next day which was included in our stay. There were plenty of choices. The service there was wonderful. Everything was fresh and clean. Overall, one of the best European hotels we have stayed in. Wished we could've stayed there longer. Highly recommend.",5,2007,12,20
36,An excellent hotel!,"We stayed at Hilton Diagonal Mar in March 2007 and had a fantastic stay, the room was very modern and beautifully furnished, the bathroom was spotless with a jacuzzi bath-tub with a built-in TV in the wall and a seperate shower, everything was really modern, and the hygeane products were top noch. The staff was excellent, this was everything one can expect from a 5-star hotel. I recommend it whole-heartedly.",5,2007,11,28
36,"Wonderful Hotel, Wonderful Staff","We loved the Hilton Diagonal Mar.  We were in Barcelona to attend a business conference and chose the Hilton over the conference hotel, Hotel Arts, based largely on Hilton points and the high price of the Arts.  We were glad we did.  Staff at the Hilton was welcoming and efficient.  We had requested no feather bedding in the room and on arrival found the room ready and waiting.  That's important after 24 hours in transist.  The room was uncluttered and comfortable.  The bathroom was spottlessly clean and well stocked with all the things one needs.  The only change I would like is better light for reading.  We booked an executive room rate to get access to the lounge where they serve breakfast and snacks.  This is good value, when breakfast for two in the hotel runs 40 euro or more.  Staff in the lounge were helpful in planning our sightseeing, plus the source of advice on using public transist.  When we found we had forgotten a prescription medicine  they contacted the local pharmacy and helped us get the pills we needed.  The first morning we woke to a gorgeous sunrise over the Mediterranean, it was the icing on the cake.",5,2007,11,27
36,Great Hotel,"Stayed at hotel on a girls weekend away - 5 of us.  Very comfortable rooms, lots of space in the bathroom for our toiletries.  Good wardobes!!.

Had a very lazy afternoon around pool area, which has good amount of loungers and also excellent chic seating area.

Would go back.",5,2007,10,15
36,A Great Hotel,"I stayed here In May for four days. The staff was really nice and efficient (even though most of were trainees), the room was beautiful with an awesome view to the sea. We had a plasma tv, the breakfast buffet was huge and the staff really friendly.
The only thing I could say as negative is the location, since it's a bit away from the center of the city. But that's not too bad actually. There's a shopping center across the street, and they offer a lot of different restaurants to choose from.
It was a great stay.",5,2007,10,01
36,Modern and good for families,"My husband and I stayed here with our two sons and grandkids in early September. From the moment we walked in the door until we left, the service was friendly and helpful.  The hotel is modern, the rooms comfortable, and the parks around the hotel are imaginative and fun for kids. The hotel is located in a new conference complex about 15 minutes outside of the city center.  So if you want to walk out your door to La Rambla, you should stay elsewhere. However, if you want all the modern conveniences, a little peace and quiet, access to a great shopping mall , parks, metro and beach, this might be the place for you! We appreciated the way the staff helped us with the grandkids, seeming to never mind the crumbs they left behind or the shrieks of joy at the gifts of crayons from the front desk! And because the times that the Spaniards eat are not the times children from the U.S. eat, it was really great to be able to cross the street, get some fast food or shop in the supermarket to accommodate the change in time zones and local eating times. As others have mentioned, the pool was quite cool, but lots of people were swimming in it, so apparently not too much of a problem.   The Executive Lounge was not very crowded when we were there, and the food was excellent, both for breakfast, afternoon snacks and evening tapas. They were very strict about taking food out of the lounge, which is not our experience with other Hiltons, but other than that, the Lounge was a great addition.  We found it easy to get into and out of down town via helpful taxi drivers who were always willing to talk to us about what we were seeing or comment strongly on American politics!  One night we took a lovely stroll along the beach to a beachside cafe, which was lively and fun.",5,2007,09,28
36,Review for families with young children,"Stayed here with my family (wife, 2.5 year old and 7 month old boys) and so I would like to address this to people who might consider staying here with young children. We thought it was great!  

1. Hotel staff.  Staff were friendly and helpful, especially with the children. They greeted them warmly, helped with the stroller, brought them toys and so on....

2. Hotel facilities for children. We asked for and got 2 child cots which worked well.  Child menu at restaurant with spaghetti, etc at a reasonable hotel cost.  Pool is for adults and was a bit cold, but our 2 year old enjoyed it.  

3. Places to Play . There's a couple of parks in the area. Behind the conference center is a little park with slide, swings and some other little surprises. On weekends, they set up a little fair with blow up play things (our child calls them jump jumps), a little train, a track with peddle cars and a little bungee jump thing.  To the side of the hotel and mall there is another park with a little playground with some wooden playthings and some pieces the kids can jump on that make sound (different tones). There's also a little play area in the mall and you can pay 2 Euro to push your kid around in a shopping cart/car.  All in all, I thought it worked well.

4. Places to eat for kids.  There aren't a whole lot of restaurants in the area, but if your kids are used to eating earlier (like ours are), nothing is open anyway. We were happy to have the mall across the street b/c we could get food for the kids.  There are several decent restaurants where you can sit outside and enjoy a meal and a pitcher of Sangria. Not the best of Spain, but kids can run around and nobody is disturbed. While we were there, they had a pool set up with kayaks and a track with tricycles and peddle cars.  

5. Getting to sights.  There's a metro in walking distance (we didn't try it), taxis in front of the hotel, and a tourist bus that stops a half block down the road.  We took the tourist bus one day and liked it for the overview of the city, but it was not so convenient with kids. We had to change buses several times and in the more popular areas, wait in long lines.  After we did this one day, we took taxis after that.  It's a bit more expensive and it takes a bit more time to get places, but it wasn't a problem for us. Zoo and Acquarium/IMAX were close by (5-10 minutes).  Some of the bigger taxis (vans) have fold down child booster car seats built in (for toddlers only).

6. Shopping. there are several kids related stores (toys-r-us, imaginarium, etc.) in the mall and a big supermarket.  We liked this b/c we needed to do some shopping for the kids.  

7. Laundry. Found a local place down the street (directly across from the hotel, past the mall) that does laundry at 3 euro a Kilo.  Compared to the hotel, a steal and laundry was done next day and done well. Friendly staff, too.

That's about it. Feel free to contact me if you have specific questions.",5,2007,09,28
36,Great hotel but sleepless in Barcelona,"This modern hotel is close to the new Convention Centre and opposite a large shopping and cinema complex. There is a lot of building work in progress so this is definitely an area that is on the up. As has been said before the hotel is only a short stroll from the Metro and the journey to the Ramblas district is only a few stops  and this is certainly the easiest way to get around the area.
We found that the restaurants outside the shopping centre were disappointing and quite expensive but we did find an excellent place called Man Go which is just a block away from the hotel near the rear of the shopping centre. There is a great selection of meals and tapas at reasonable prices and a good selections of wines. The spinach with honey and raisins was superb and the paella was great value and extremely tasty.
As frequent guests at Hiltons we were upgraded to an Executive room on the 23rd floor and we checked in at the Executive Lounge. The room was not particularly big but had everything we needed for a weekend stay. We were provided with complimentary water and some pastries as well as other usual amenities.
The Lounge is of a decent size and has a balcony if you want to enjoy the sunshine but the lounge can get very crowded at peak times. At times the staff were rushed off their feet but they were all very friendly and helpful. On our first night the lounge was full of people who had just finished a cruise and it was so crowded that we only stayed for one drink. There is a good selection of food and drinks in the evening although there can be a crush around the food at times. The breakfast selection is good but the hot selection is pretty poor. Biggest complaint is that there is only coffee machine and there can be a long queue at times. A second machine would certainly reduce the waiting time which was sometimes ten minutes.
The rooftop pool is a great feature of the hotel and there is plenty of seating as well as a poolside restaurant and bar. The pool was a little chilly but certainly invigorating!
On our second night we returned to our room to find a note advising us that a Dance Festival would be in progress from 6PM until 6AM that evening. Despite being on the top floor we had a completely sleepless night and we heard many people complaining about the noise the following morning.
On returning home we had already received an email from Guest Relations thanking us for our stay. I replied that the hotel was very good but  our relaxing weekend had been ruined by the sleepless Saturday night. I really didn’t expect any response but a couple of days later I received a mail from the GM apologising for our inconvenience and offering us a complimentary weekend so that they could look after us properly! Excellent customer service in these days when customers are largely ignored, so we’ll be going back in January to give it another try.",4,2007,09,26
36,Mediocre at best for what you pay for,"If you are not forced to stay at this hotel by your job because of a conference...stay away by all means. At 235 euro per room, it's a mediocre attempt to provide luxury, with unfriendly staff, not above average amenities, ok rooms but with no touch of class.  And if you are visiting Barcelona you most likely want to see the magnificent sights in the center, this hotel is at least a 30min drive from the center. It's in a non residential new area of the town, near the harbor that after 7pm you rarely see anybody go by.  All in all...wouldn't stay there again
",2,2007,09,23
36,OK-ish,"The hotel is OK if you are lucky enough to book it on a below 100 euro rate per night including breakfast. 

The rooms are OK, comfortable bed, too bad they didn't change the linen for 7 days. Housekeeping service was average, my DND on the door was ignored 3 times as someone tried to enter the room while we were resting. Plus, the comment card in our room had been filled out by a guest 3 weeks before us and was still there when we left!!!

If you're a lady and like to blow-dry your hair you should consider bringing your own hair dryer, the one in the room is just awful!

Reception and restaurant staff were friendly but service is inconsistant. The omlette we ordered for breakfast came back as we asked for 2 out of 5 times (that's bad!) Still, there's plenty of nice items on the bufffet (we recommend the gauffres and the mini-croissants with vanilla cream!!!)

Location wise, I think that it's just great - quiet, 5 minutes to the beach, just across the street from a shopping centre and the bus 41 which takes you to Plaza Catalunya.

Talking about the beach, it's perfect if you like it clean and quiet. If you like it crowded and noisy and nudy then go to Sitges (40 km away from Barcelona).

36,"Luxury, and near the beach.","Stayed here for 2 nights when attending the Summercase music festival. Would highly recommend to anyone attending this or any of the other music festivals at Diagonal Parc- you can stagger back to yoiur room minutes after leaving the festival. Also many of the artists stay here- in 5 minutes i shared a lift with Kele from Bloc Party, met Jarvis Cocker and saw members of Sissor sisters and Kaiser Chiefs!
 The hotel is great- a nice pool and patio area, very comfortable rooms, quite large in size, a comfortable bed with nice linen, a modern style bathroom with lots of free toiletries and a wonderfull power shower. Also a very quiet and efficient air-con system- a must in Barcelona at any time of year.
 Only downside is the price- room rates, restaurants and minibar all much more than i usually like to pay. Hotel seems primarily aimed at buisiness account travellers attending the conference next door. However the nearby hotels increase their prices hugely when the music festivals take place (Princess, AC Barcelona- both very good- i've stayed at these in previous years)
  Location wise, don't stay here if you want to be in the centre of Barcelona- it's a 15 minute subway ride away. There are also good bus links too.
 However the main plus to the Diagonal Mar area is being 2 minutes from a number of good beaches- great after a days sight seeing to spend a few hours on the beach. There is also a massive shopping complex opposite the hotel, with a big outside food terrace with a wide range of restaurants.
  I would recommend staying here on a city break, if you like a mixture of relaxing on the beach as well as seeing all of the sights. Effectively 2 holidays in one! As long as you are confident using the subway.
",5,2007,08,10
36,A Little More to Add...,"I wholeheartedly agree with edleo's July 16 review about this hotel and just want to add a few comments rather than repeat what he said.  If you want to go to the beach, do not go across the street as the water there is dirty.  Instead, walk across to the Diagonal Mar Mall and rent a car from Hertz (on the first floor).  An hour's drive on the main highway up the coast will put you in the Costa Brava area.  There you will find some of the most beautiful beaches you have ever seen.  We left the hotel at 7AM and spent the entire day swimming in the Med, arriving back at the hotel 12 hours later.   While also a Diamond member, we were pleasantly surprised to find that this Hilton also gave military discounts and this reduced our rate for a first class room to one normally found for a budget hotel.  Congratulations, Hilton Diagonal Mar, keep up the good work!!
",5,2007,07,30
36,"Good starting point ruined; - lack of service, staff training and communication","This is a five star hotel, and the Hilton chain itself considers it a six star hotel. 

The hotel building and all its facilities were wonderful, and fully up to the standard of a five star hotel. We especially loved the outdoor pool and lounge area. The room was spacious, and the only negative about it was the mattress, which was way too firm, so if you're very skinny, it will be uncomfortable. Also, internet access is only included if you bring your own laptop, so if you have to use the one in the lobby or the ones in the business center, there's a hefty per minute charge, which I found tacky. 

Why did I not rate this hotel higher? Because the people who work there are not up to the task of running a five star hotel. 
- We asked for turn down service, they forgot. 
- Another day I asked them to clean the bathroom floor, and came back to find that they hadn't done it.
- Housekeeping kept rearranging the makeup in my beauty bag.
- I asked for a hardboiled egg for breakfast; one day they forgot, another day, several different people brought me a total of four eggs. 
- The maitre d' claimed on the third day of our five day stay that breakfast was not included in our rate (which it was). We politely told him that it was, and asked him to please confirm with the front desk. He started a discussion! Can you believe it? In a five star hotel? He wanted us to sign a blank check, which we refused, and in the end we were allowed to have our included breakfast. After breakfast, he told us that we had been right all along, that breakfast was indeed included in our rate. We asked him to make sure to make a note of it so we wouldn't run into the same problem later. 
- Next day, new maitre d', we're told breakfast is not included in our rate... Same story all over again. 
- At check out, the receptionist presents us with a bill for two days of breakfast, because, as it turns out, the maitre d' has billed us for breakfast for the two days they messed up and the maitre d' has signed the check himself. We're appalled, but politely explain the situation, and what does the receptionist do? He starts another discussion, and he starts calling a bunch of people from the phone right in front of us. When he finally gets off the phone, he says that he will ""give us"" the breakfasts, as if he's doing us a favor, seeing as he seems to think that it is perfectly normal to book a five day stay with included breakfast on only three of the five days. I have never experienced a longer check out.

I truly hope that someone high up in the Hilton chain reads this, and does something about this. The hotel itself is beautiful, it's certainly a five or six star on paper, but it's not even a one star in terms of service and staff training and communication. We only encountered one staff member that we thought did a good job, unfortunately I don't remember her name, but it was a female receptionist. Everyone else needs A LOT more training. Because of that, this is a hotel that people stay at once, and never return to. That's unfortunate; I don't know of any other place with such a good starting point that accomplishes to ruin everything so completely.
",2,2007,07,22
36,A 5 star treat,"Just back from a week's break at one of Barcelona's newest 5 star hotels. Selected the hotel on the strength of past reviews and as a Hilton Hhonor's member was aware of the benefits of booking one of their Executive Rooms.

Although the hotel is large, 400+ rooms, it doesn't feel it and the hotel still has a newness about it. The rooms and public areas are spotlessly clean and the staff are extremely friendly and helpful.

Other plusses are the excellent outdoor pool - one of the largest that I know of for a city centre hotel. Maybe not that suitable for young children but ideal for someone who wants to swim rather than splash - it makes a change!

As with past reviewers, the location could be an issue for anyone wanting to be close to the action but the excellent, and cheap Metro gives you easy access to all the city sites. Having stayed in the city on more than one occasion before, the quiet location suited us perfectly; and for a city location the hotel is very, very quiet. Taxis are also plentiful, and cheap. A mid-day, midweek trip back to the airport in fairly heavy traffic was just £20 ($40).

Just one minor niggle though. The Executive Lounge was very busy, so much so that breakfast was a bit of a zoo. The Lounge is not that large and services about 6 large floors of Exec rooms. On a couple of occasions, and with no tables available we took ourselves down to the main Indigo Restaurant, where remarkably it was quiet, the food was great and it was an altogether more relaxing experience. During the rest of the day, the lounge (with open air terrace) was a great bonus - complimentary afternoon tea and pre-dinner drinks and snacks are a nice touch and it's also open 'til 10.30pm. A great place to relax and unwind.

If they can sort out the breakfast ritual, certainly when the hotel's near capacity (staff acknowledged there had been some minor problems but said these were being addressed), then the Diagonal Mar's pretty much faultless. Overall: Highly Recommended.
",5,2007,07,19
36,Very nice hotel,"We stayed at the Hilton for 3 nights earlier this month.  As previous reviews have said, the hotel is far away from the center of Barcelona and the sights.  We had already stayed at Le Meridien just off of Las Ramblas for several nights, so we had seen what we wanted to see of the city, and this was meant to be the pool/beach portion of our Barcelona vacation. For that purpose, it was perfect.
The hotel is new and clean.  Nice pool area, although the pool itself is a little small.  The beach is about 2 blocks away so that was very nice.  Rooms were crisp and clean- flat screen TV, large closet space with safe, hairdryer, overall very nice.  Not too much of a Spanish-feel, but it is a Hilton, so what can you expect.
Food is surprisingly good at breakfast and the restaurant for dinner, although absurdly priced.  The hotel is across the street from a shopping mall with many food-court restaurants, which was nice when you did not want to spend a fortune for a simple sandwich. 
Overall, I would highly recommend the hotel, but only for those looking for R&R or attending a convention.  Not for those wanting to go out and about in Barcelona.
",5,2007,07,11
36,Very good hotel.,"I stayed there for 3 days in June 2007. This is a very modern hotel, nicely decorated, with well trained staff. The lounges, bars and restaurants are very nice, and the food, of course, is excellent. My room was on the 17th floor, with breathtaking view of the sea and city. It was very nice,  clean, and spacious. The swimming pool was small but nice, but the entire pool area as well as the pool bar and restaurant were spacious with good view of the city and sea (on the 2nd floor). The hotel is situated outside the city centre, so you need a taxi to go there. One bad thing is that there is not a smoking area inside, except in the smoking rooms. They say that the law prohibits smoking in all the public spaces, including hotels etc, but in Barcelona there are many public spaces such as restaurants, bars etc where smoking is permited.
",4,2007,07,10
36,Great American style hotel in Barcelona,"My wife and I just returned from a 2 night stay at the Hilton Barcelona Diagonal Mar.  Our stay was strictly for pleasure.  We picked this hotel because it’s newly constructed and we generally prefer American style hotel rooms when traveling in Europe.  Overall, we had a great stay at this hotel.

Rooms: As I am a Hilton Honors member with Diamond status, we were upgraded to a corner room on one of the executive floors (5 of them in total).  Rooms facing south and on high floors have a stellar view of the Mediterranean – those on the other side have a beautiful view of the city.  Furnishings in room were first rate: 27” (approx.) flat screen TV, wood floors, nice easy chair with ottoman, etc.  Bathroom was also very nice with separate shower and bathtub.  My wife appreciated the high powered hair dryer.  I liked the big closet with safe.  On our first night, the hotel provided a lovely welcome gift – a single-serving bottle of cognac and a small plate of desserts.  Turn down service was provided on both nights. 

Executive Lounge: Probably the best executive lounge I’ve ever been in.  As the other reviews note, premium alcoholic beverages are provided from lunchtime until closing.  Breakfast was fairly standard, but snack options in the afternoon and evening were GREAT.  This usually included 2-3 hot items (i.e. potsickers with dipping sauce), 4-5 cold items (usually a couple of sweets, gourmet sandwiches, etc.), and a nice selection of typical finger foods (i.e. nuts and crackers).  And we aren’t talking freezer section stuff here – this is stuff that their kitchen was clearly preparing strictly for the lounge.  Rarely do I consider the lounge something worth paying extra for but in this case, I would have gladly shelled out the additional amount for this privilege.  If a little wind doesn’t both you, the balcony area of the lounge has million dollar views of both the Mediterranean and the city.

Transportation: If this hotel was in the States, you’d say it was in the suburbs.  Realistically, it’s about 25-30 via public transit from Sants/Airport/La Rambla. Currently, line L4 of the subway is closed (until mid-August of ’07) from Bogatell to La Pau.  There are a couple of options to get around this.  First, the Tram (route T4) runs from Ciutadella/Villa Olimpica (easier transfer to/from the L4) to Estació de Sant Adrià.  The El Maresme stop is 5 minutes from the hotel (just on the other side of the mall – there’s a ticket machine on the platform – the tickets are interchangeable with the subway.)  Your other option is to use the special bus service that runs between Bogatell to La Pau (there’s a million signs for this – very easy to use even for English speakers).  We found the tram to be a little faster, plus it has a very convenient connection with subway line L1 at Glories that will take you to Catalunya.  

General Area: As noted above and in other reviews, the hotel is in the suburbs and at the beach…sort of.  There’s a beach 3-4 blocks away however it appears that most of the natives prefer the beaches a little closer to the city (try the L4 stop at Barceloneta and follow the crowd).  The hotel also has a nice pool area with lots of lounge chairs.  Directly across the street from the hotel is the very fancy Diagonal Mar mall.  Alcampo is the Wal-Mart equivalent.  The mall also has MANY eating options including some that stay open late.  If you don’t want to pay the high prices at the Hilton for food, Diagonal Mar is a great option.  We felt very safe walking around the area near the hotel – even late at night.  There were always people around.  For extra safety, you can walk through the mall.  

Knocks: 2.  Realistically, this hotel caters to the convention crowd.  Don’t stay here if you have an aversion to a bunch of people walking around with name tags.  Secondly, the hotel won’t win any awards for its proximity to the main sights (i.e. Ramblas, Picasso, Sagrada Familia).  We actually considered the latter to be a slight plus.  After a long day fighting tourist crowd, we enjoyed hopping off the tram in a residential area, smelling the sea breeze, and being able to leisurely walk back to our hotel.

In summary, we loved the Hilton Barcelona Diagonal Mar.  It’s encompasses just about everything you expect from a Hilton.  If you are looking for a hotel with a lot of local flavor, this probably isn’t the hotel for you.  However if you are looking for a typical high-end American style hotel, this place is absolutely perfect for you.

36,"Very nice new hotel, clean rooms","Stayed here for a night in June.  The location is a little far from the traditional sights of Barcelona, but the hotel is very clean, owing to its newness.  Service was very helpful in getting information from my airline about lost luggage.  Proximity to the Diagonal Mar shopping area made finding replacement clothes a breeze and I was able to update myself in the latest Spanish fashions.

36,Very nice!,"Got a great price via Hotwire, and knew what I was getting beforehand - this is the only 5-star hotel listed in the sub-area on Hotwire. Great location, good service, comfortable, modern rooms. Not much of a view, but you can make out just a hint of the sea. If you have a high room facing the sea, probably get a much better view.

36,Clean new hotel,"Thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Hilton Diagonal Mar in Barcelona during the LNG 15 conference 24th 27th April 2007. I was booked into a club room and had access to the club lounge where the selection of food was average but the service was excellent, not to mention the breakfasts on the first floor that was absolutely fabulous.

The bedroom were nice, spacy and spotlessly clean. The bed was large and comfortable. 

The staff at the front were very helpful, friendly and patient.

The downside was the location, although good for attending the conference it was 15 minutes away from the centre of town and the nightlife areas. The hotel was also about a 10 minute walk to the nearest subway station. 

Also, the hotel was a tad overpriced.

It is too far out for tourists but great for people attending conferences and exhibitions next door.

36,Lovely Hotel,"Very nice Hilton hotel. Although out of the way, provided very nice modern rooms with amazing views of the city. Excellent Executive lounge and rooms. Complimentary breakfasts and snacks of high standard. Soft drinks and alcohol also available. Rooms immaculate with high standard of housekeeping. 

Only two criticisim, the pool needs to be heated. It was too cold to use even though daily temperatures were mid 20's. Also only English speaking channels on TV were Sky News, BBC World and CNN or pay to view movies. Fine if not spending time in room but when travelling with 7 year old need occassional entertainment. Hotel was great with son and though not billed as a family hotel, children do not present a problem and are warmly welcomed.

If you are on the executive floors you have access to the executive lounge which offers snacks and drinks during the day.  A full bar is available free of charge which is really nice if you are relaxing before going out.  The location is a little out of the way from the center of the city, but public transporation and rentals are easily acquired.

The hotel offers very good service (second room cleaning, bed preparation for the night), the rooms are as they should be for a five star hotel, including flat TV. The hotel's interior is very modern and stylish. With a pool in the first floor overlooking the surrounding mall, this is a very luxurious stay.

36,Fantastic Hotel,"Stayed here over the Easter Weekend, with my fiancee.
This is an excellent new hotel (opened Late 2005).
Being a Gold VIP member, we received an upgrade to the executive lounge and an executive room on the 21st floor (23 total). (The complimentary bar is not 24 hours - alchoholic drinks are from midday to 22.30 - not as said in an earlier review!)
Public areas and rooms are spotlessly clean.
Outstanding views from our room and the executive lounge - we could see all of Barcelona from the kingsized bed!
Rooms have a 26inch Plasma TV - only the usual news channels in english though! (apart from pay per view)
Location is of course the best or worst thing about this hotel. Some may love the peace away from the hustle of the city centre, others may want to be nearer it!
It takes 30 minutes by metro to the central areas (the trains seem slower here than London or Paris??) The actual metro station Maresem Forum is actually through the shopping centre over the road and then through a slightly dubious looking apartment block area. It is a ten minute walk - maybe longer with a bag!
The shopping centre is huge with the many shops and fast food outlets. There is a good chinese buffect located on the outside part of the centre - right under the hotel! Only 9 euros for all you can eat!
A word of warning to tourists - some shops want your passport when paying by credit card, and as ever, beware of pickpockets - especially on the metro!
It may be on the coast, but there is not really a beach scene directly by the hotel - it was a building site for a zoo when we were there! The main beaches are further down by the marina.
Taxis maybe fairly cheap, but we seem to have got overcharged on our return trip to the airport! It was 25 Euros from and 31 Euros to the airport! The only thing I can think of it was slightly longer due to one-way streets.
Hotel overall though, fantastic - no problems, except we had to leave!

Via Hilton Honors had a complimentary upgrade to executive floors, they were so good my colleague paid out of his own pocket 60 euros to do the same, complimentary breakfast tip top, the sun balcony does not get much better, and of course 24hr complimentary drinks - alcoholic - unlike the USA and non alcoholic.

10-12 Euros to Le Rambles in a taxi, 15 minute walk to Port Olympic and casino etc - great restaurants, bars and clubs - would say a great spot for stag/hen weekends or a couples getaway.

Pool area nice and the room very nice!  Very easy to get to the tourist areas using the tourista bus (hop on/off tourist bus).  Beach about 10 min walk.  Great mall with good resturants.  Good tapas.  I would recommend this hotel to anybody who does not mind  not being near the tourist areas.
",5,2007,01,07
36,Gracious Staff & High Standards,"This hotel provides a high professional standard of hospitality - one  you pay dearly for with money.  The staff is incredibly accomodating and welcoming.  Many of the staff members speak four languages (plus), are extremely gracious, and are probably  more worldly than most of the guests.  Rooms are cush and serene (in a West Elm meets Crate and Barrel kind of way).  I enjoyed this hotel, but felt separated from the essence of Spanish culture and vivacity upon entering  the gargantuan Diagonal Mar compound which includes an enormous mall across the street (mass consumption at its finest)...I would recommend staying here as a departure or arrival point, but not as a way of gaining much insight into the heart of Barcelona.  This is a great hotel for corporate people, families with children who need time to recharge before international flights and those seeking pampered travel experiences.
",4,2006,12,01
36,Great hotel just outside the city centre,"My husband was going to attend a conference and the Hilton is one of the nearest hotels to the conference centre. We decided to both go to Barcelona a few days before the start of the conference and I left on the day it started.

The hotel is on the outskirts of Barcelona (beyond Port Olympic) but the centre can be easily reached either via the underground or trams (we did not try the buses). 

There is a large shopping mall just across the road with plenty of shops and restaurants to keep yourself occupied without having to go to the centre of Barcelona. There is a beach nearby but I would not recommend it for any leisure activities as there is a huge building site but this does mean that you can have a room with a sea view as we did. We had a relaxation room with a jacuzzi bath. There was also a few books about yoga and some relaxation CDs.  Bose CD player and a DVD player were available. Very comfortable bed. 

The pool was closed by the time we went there but it looks lovely. 

Breakfast had the usual array of Hilton breakfast foods - anything you could wish for was there. Staff were all very friendly.

Overall, I would recommend this hotel but not if you want to be at the heart of it all.

36,Lovely Accommodations,"We stayed in this hotel for just one night before a cruise.  Lovely room, attentive staff, fantastic breakfast which was included in our rate.    Very good value for the price.
",4,2006,11,07
36,Conference Hotel Plus,"Like a lot of people I stayed at this hotel because I attended a conference in the congress hall which is right next door. Covering this bit first I would say that if you are using the local congress centre this is the best place in the area to stay.
It is also a good place to stay if you are on holiday as you are far enough out of town to relax but close enough when you want to go there. Meanwhile there is a great shopping and eating plaza across the road and plenty of small tapas bars too.
The hotel is not exactly full of character however everything is clean, new looking and friendly. the rooms are light ans the air conditioning effective. The beds are excelent and, for the business traveller there is good work space and high speed internet links.
Only gripe at all was the hotel bar bills were a bit steep so watch out. Mind you try a Mohana (delicious drink with fresh mint) and you probably won't care!

It's a little further away from the centre, in a area which is developing at the moment.
The staff were really nice, breakfast was great, very similar to the other hilton in that way.
But the difference was the room which was a lot larger, the bathroom was just great. The view is fantastic from this hotel. Seaview or city view. This hotel also has a swimming pool with a gym. Overall left very happy.

36,Top Notch Hotel,"This was our first hotel during a trip to Europe this summer.  Nicest hotel by far!  It is new, so no maintenance issues.  Great pool with view of beaches.  The room was clean with modern decor.  Hotel staff was helpful and gracious.  It is in a newer area of Barcelona, with a mall across the street.  Access into the city center is easy and inexpensive via taxi, transit, or tour bus.  The double-decker tour bus stops just down the street- a good way to see the city (buy a two-day pass).
",5,2006,09,29
36,"Perfect in every way, except location","We went to the Hilton Diagonal Mar after spending a couple of nights at the Le Meridien on Ramblas. The difference was night and day. 

This Hilton is rated as a Category 6, HHonors' highest category. For a hotel, I felt it was truly deserving of this rating. The hotel itself is very new and modern, which fits well with Barcelona. 

As a HHonors Gold member, I went to the Executive lounge for check-in and received a room on the 19th floor. The room was large and had a great view of the Mediterranean. No, it's not on the beach but I would say it's maybe a few minutes walk at most. The bed was firm and similar to the newer beds found in N American Hiltons. The bathroom had the modern style sinks which I always find looks great aesthetically but, practically, doesn't work that well. 

The Executive lounge is superb. There is the main area for seating and a large outdoor patio area as well. The food for both breakfast and evening h'ors d'oeurves was top notch. Outside of those hours, there are complimentary drinks and snacks. 

The service received from all staff was exceptional. Every request was acted on quickly and I have absolutely no complaints. Just across the street is the Diagonal Mar shopping mall, which was extremely convenient and had quite a few restaurants. The closest metro was El Maresme Forum which was a little hard to find, at first. You have to walk around the mall and the Princess hotel, before you see the Hilton. It was a very easy 5-7 minute walk and you could get to any other place in Barcelona from there.

I was much more pleased with this hotel than the Meridien (you can read my review on that too). Yes, the location of the Meridien is better. But for an overall hotel experience, the Hilton was truly 5 star.

36,Good business hotel...,"We wanted to burn a few points in Barcelona when visiting friends and we had the choice between two Hilton in Barcelona. My wife wanted a swimming pool. So the choice was easy: Diagonal Mar and not the more central one. We booked 3 nights with our HHonors points with 2 kids.

We were upgraded to Executive floor and checked in in the Executive lounge by friendly staff. We had a corner room (slightly more spacious than standard executive) and asked for an additional bed for our kid. Free of charge and very good quality and length (could even accomodate an adult).

The room are very nice with flat screen

Location
Not in the city center but in a quiet area (no noisy construction very close)
Near the sandy beach (easily accessible with a 10 min walk) where you can find a fresh water shower. Beach OK. 

Parking
If you have a car, instead of using the overpriced hotel car park, park it free of charge in the street parallel to the hotel.

Executive lounge OK but a little bit cramped and small with the usual choice of beverages and good snacks from 6pm to 8:30pm. We had our breakfast (good without a very large choice)  there on the terrace having a view on the city and sea, very nice when you can get a table in the shade.

We did not eat in the hotel as you have everything you need from sandwich to full fledged restaurant and tapas bar in front of the hotel. You do not need to pay overpriced meal in trhe hotel.

The pictures on Internet are misleading as they make the sea appear a little closer than it is actually and it seems as if there was a grass garden near the pool which is on the second floor but the grass we see is next to the street.
Swimming OK but a little cold (even in August). Ample free towels and lounge chairs.
As already said, easy connections to the city center with tram, tube, bus and taxi (8 EUR).

Overall a good new hotel without atmosphere.

36,Love affair at the Hilton,"After reading several bad reviews, I was a little sceptic I must admit. I am a spoiled traveler, and always stay at top class hotels. The Hilton Diagonal Mar was great! A really, really nice guy at reception made sure we felt very welcome, and the room was gorgeous, big bath and bright room with a huge minibar and lots of amenities. We had sea view and windows in the bathroom which was great:) Really comfy bed, and staff always very helpful. The pool is not that big, but works out just fine, it all looks really good. Breakfast is good and very attentive staff. Next dood there is a shopping mall and some restaurants, and just two minutes away is the metro that takes you to the city center. NO problem at all! the only drawback of staying a little out of the center is getting a taxi home at night..I always got a private car though..it took too long for the taxis to become avaliable:)
It's close to the beach, just three minute walk and the area is really nice. The place is kind of the new business center in barcelona, so it's expanding all the time. No construction work anymore, so no problem there.
If you prefer to stay closer to the city center, yet close to the beach, hilton diagonal mar might be a little out for you, but for us it was great, we didn't mind spending a little more time on transport. The location is the drawback-the hotel is great!
I would def. go back!

36,Sunny & Spectacular!,"My new husband and I chose the Hilton for a one-night stay prior to our honeymoon cruise.  I'm so happy that we did!  I emailed the hotel ahead of time and they put us in a gorgeous 12th floor room facing the beach and pool.  If you go, request room 1209.  The room was very sunny and spacious and the bed extremely cozy!  I loved the modern bathroom and I don't know about the other reviewers but both of our showers (there were two) were extremely powerful.  The Villeroy & Boch sink was a nice touch and the Crabtree & Evelyn toiletries appreciated!  

While my husband took a nap from being jetlagged, I went to the pool which was a good size and very clean.  There were plenty of chairs and a nice bar and dining area.  Their lunches were a bit overpriced (18,00 E for an overcooked tuna caesar salad) but the sangria was delicious!   

Breakfast was included in our package but was just okay.  They seemed to have tried to cater to all nationalities so maybe being used to American breakfasts, it wasn't all that good to us.  Next time, I'll probably just book the room and go across the street to the mall--which, by the way, was really nice to see as we had to wait a few hours to check in.  They had a McDonald's, Starbucks, H&M and plenty of other places to eat and shop.  

The drinks in the lobby bar were delicious but the scene was very quiet--just a few people watching t.v.  The Hilton, overall, is a quiet place to stay so if you are seeking the action, you probably want to stay closer to the action (see my review of the Hotel Jazz).  There was, however, some excitement next door as we faintly heard the sounds of a nightclub in the wee early hours.  It wasn't disturbing enough to keep one awake but was audible.

The metro is located a few blocks away (it's located on the other side of the mall--you can walk down to the Princess Hotel and cross--you'll see it a few blocks up) which we took to the Port Olympic area.  Definitely a must-see.  We ate dinner at Agua which was very good but you must make reservations early if you want to sit outside.  It's located next to the Hotel Arts on the beachfront.  And I found there to be no fear of theft--I carried my small purse around with me everywhere and didn't see any muggings.  I didn't feel extremely safe in the Olympic area at night, however (probably because of things I read online prior to our trip), so we went back to the hotel prior to midnight.  The metro was very cheap (1,20 E) and as good, if not better, than the NY subway system.

Being that it was our first time in Europe, I was worried about language barriers.  However, we found the staff to speak very good English and were helpful and not rude at all.  I resent the other reviewer's statement about their youth--that has no impact on one's ability to interact with guests and visitors.  They showed us where to go for the buffet, stored our bags safely, rushed a room for us prior to the standard check-in time (we checked in at 11 a.m. versus the standard 3 p.m.) and were happy to call a taxi for us and tell the driver where to go.  

I would definitely recommend the Hilton Diagonal Mar to any traveler!
",5,2006,08,02
36,Comfortable stay,"The Diagonal Mar Barcelona was very nice.. beautiful rooms, great views of the city. Our room was very nice and huge, almost like a small apartment. However, as others have said, it is not on the beach as it appears to be from the pictures. It is right on the Meditarranean, but no beaches. If you have the money to spend and want a comfortable, upscale place to enjoy your privacy, this would be great. The area it is in is pretty new. There is a nice shopping center right across the street, but you'll have to find some form of transportation to get to the city center and major attractions, as it is too far to walk.
",3,2006,07,12
36,"Too little, too late, too young! ","The photo's of this hotel as seen on the Hilton web site is deceiving.  Its proximity to the beach is not as close as it looks.  It is NOT close to the city center and the area is too new to have any significant activity, unless you're there for business and using the convention center.  The building is 9 mo. new, but too open, (visually) cold public spaces.  The bar stock is mediocre.  Problems with the rooms (eg.- Lights burned out at the desk and hallway, low water pressure in the bathroom, no safety bars near the tub, shower door not closing) which were reported the first day were never repaired during a four day stay, with no replacement room offered.  The entire staff is VERY YOUNG AND INEXPERIENCED, sometimes nonresponsive and rude.  People make a place worthwhile, this place has a long way to go before they deserve their top rated prices!
",2,2006,05,29
36,"Nice business hotel, but watch out for the Internet fees","I recently checked into this Hilton for a few days for a business meeting and had a very pleasant stay.  The room was clean and modern, with a flat screen TV, high-speed (Ethernet) Internet access, a comfy reading chair, and a sleek bathroom.  It had two twin beds (note -- this is what you get if you request a ""double room"").  My room was on an executive floor so I also had access to the club which was good for free breakfasts and drinks and snacks throughout the day.  The hotel has an exercise room which was smallish but well-equipped with cardio and weight machines.  The hotel's location near the shoreline also provides easy access to good walking/running/biking paths.  

My one beef with this Hilton was that the Internet access was too expensive -- it was 27 euro per day which works out to $35 US dollars.  Yikes!  Why is it that so many hotel chains are able to provide Internet access (wireless even) for free while others charge an arm and a leg?  Maybe because they get so many business travelers they feel they can get away with it.  Anyway, after my meeting was over, I wanted to stay an extra day on my own so I moved to the Barcelona Princess just down the block which was also very nice, less expensive ... and provided free Internet.

36,Loved our stay at the Hilton,"We just returned from 4 nights at the Diagonal Mar and had  a great time.  We went with our two daughters and another family of four.  We had two adjoining rooms, one with a king bed and another with two doubles.  The hotel was clean and the rooms very modern.  We were on the upper floors looking toward the sea.  The city views were also nice and I think on the lower floors the city view may be desirable as there is a very tall building on the sea side so floors lower then 20 are mostly obstructed by the tall building.  The city view was less obstructed.  The beds were a little hard for a new hotel and not nearly as soft as the heavenly bed at the westin.  The bathroom was nice but only had a single sink.  Our room included breakfast which was American style with omelets, waffles, fresh fruit, lox, cheese and almost everything else.  It was included in our rate but would have been 20 euros per person.  Very nice if included in the price.  The location was  a little out of the way in a very new area with lots of construction surrounding it.  The mall next to the hotel was very convenient.  There were many places to eat and an inexpensive grocery store which also sold wine similar to a Wal Mart.  It was very nice to pick up snacks and wine to enjoy in the room.  Our kids also liked shopping in the mall.  It wasn't a real high end mall but had several stores similar to Abbecrombie and the gap.  The subway was next to the mall and a very short walk to the hotel.  It took about 10 minutes to get to the center of the city from the hotel by train and about 6-7 euro by cab.  We were a little worried about being so far removed from the city center when we booked this hotel but it was actually quite nice to escape to the quite of this hotel in the evening.  The staff was very friendly and always helpful.  The pool did not open until April so we could not use it.  On the negative side, when we checked in we were given a smoking room even though we requested non-smoking and could not be moved until the next day.  After we were moved we were very happy with our stay.  Another negative is that there is alot of construction in the area.  The hotel is few blocks from the sea and the area of the sea near the hotel is being worked on by very heavy machinary so don't expect to be right on the beach.  It is a long walk to the beach area.  All in all we would definately stay at this hotel again.  The place is almost brand new and very modern.  The rate was quite reasonable given the amenities.  We paid 185 euro a night for the first room and 92.50 per night for the kids room.  This included breakfast each day.   Barcelona is a great city to visit and I would highly recommend visiting this exciting city.

36,"Excellent staff, beautiful hotel","We recently spent a week in Barcelona, visiting our daughter.  We selected the Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona based on reviews and used Hilton Honors points toward our stay. The location was conviently located near the tram and metro, allowing us to travel to the gothic quarter in 15 minutes. The airline lost our luggage in route to Barcelona.  The staff worked daily with Iberia to locate our bags, which was great as we don't speak Catalan and seem to have difficulty having our English and Spanish understood.  Each day as we returned to the hotel the employees at the front desk would greet us and provide updates.  They made what could have been a less than happy visit to the city, very pleasant.  The hotel was spotless and the king room very comfortable.  The beautiful shopping mall next door was very handy for replenishing our wardrobe until our bags were finally delivered.
",5,2006,03,19
36,Great hotel in newer part of Barcelona,"This is a great hotel, new rooms, good sizes, nice firm beds. Get an excutive room, and you get a bath with a view! You actually sit in the bath with a sliver of a window, just enough for you to look out (at the sea if you're at the right side), but don't worry, nobody can look in! Modern looks all around, no quaint charm, if you're looking for that, go elsewhere. Ask for a high floor seaview, cityview you can see from the wait area at the elevators, you can really see the whole city from here.

The lifts (elevators) are quite slow for a 23 storey building, but there are 4 to choose, so you'll never have to wait too long. 

If you want to use the pool, you'll have to arrive between April and Oktober, as it is an outdoor pool, and temperature can drop in the winter to near freezing, so seems fair enough.

Staff seemed friendly enough. But then I didn't encounter many of them. 

The location is quite good, next to a big shopping mall, and more or less across from the beach. BUT, if you want to get into the tourist areas by public transport, you'll have to change subways, or take a bus. Really cheap transport, take a T10 card, whitch gives you 10 rides for under 7 euro (about USD 8,50) and you can share the card with multiple people. 

Walking into town is really NOT an option, its more than 1 hours walk into the old town.

Then again, the taxi's are more than reasonable, hotel to towncentre is 7,50 euro. To the airport is about 30 euro, and takes about half an hour depending on traffic. More than enough taxis around. Take your hotel adress (on your keycardslip) with you, and show it to the driver, as you might end up at the other Hilton, or just say Diagonal  MAR, stress the MAR part as that is the area you need to go to. 

Still some building works around, but pleasant enough area. Have a lunch at the Marina, just down the coast, 5-10 mins by cab. (High speed highway next to the hotel, its underground so no noise!) And continue into the town from there. 

Great city, great hotel, go, now!",4,2006,03,13
36,A perfect Ending,"My last destination in Spain was barcelona and our family chose the Hilton when it had just recently opned. Everything was brand new. The people there were very freindly and the rooms are very comfrtoble. The buffets had an excellent selection and the waiters were very helpful. I would say it is one of the best hotels I have stayed in for a while.
",5,2006,01,19
36,Make sure you choose the right Hilton....,"There are two Hiltons in Barcelona. The still-shiny-new Diagonal Mar, one block from the sea and the decrepit one on the Avenida Diagonal, more towards the city centre.
We, sadly, opted for the old decrepit one. Despite booking a room on the recently renovated Executive Floor (such good value), we realised when we opened the door to our tiny room with its ""Queen-size"" bed that not much else of the hotel had been touched apart from the common areas. It looked like a dark and dingy B&B in a northern seaside town.
After deciding to move to the new Hilton - the Diagonal Mar - things improved. While they're not the most beautiful of hotels in the world, they are incredible functional, and this new-build's modern glass design is certainly impressive.
Service is generally quite good. The Executive Floor offers free food and drink all day (to be consumed in the lounge area - boo!), and over New Year's the guests certainly made the most of it. They forgot our speedy check-out option, but hey, it was New Year's Day, and the staff are very sweet.
Food-wise, room service was edible - nothing mindblowing, but OK. However, the views from the rooms and from the lobbies certainly make up for it, with stunning views out across this beautiful city and the Med.
A good, affordable, modern option if your budget doesn't stretch to Hotel Omm or Hotel Arts.

36,Excellent value for the price,"We stayed at the Hilton Diagonal Mar for 4 days in Mid December 2005. 
We had a nice Deluxe room (we were upgraded) in the 16th floor with a great view of Barcelona. 
Because we got a special oppening price, we paid less than 450 Euros for three nights for two persons.
Service and hotel staff were very friendly and attentive.
The room was spacious and everything was okay. Breakfast was Hilton like which means very good quality and a good choice of food.

Transportation with public transportation Metro L4 (Station Maresme Forum) or Bus nr. 41 is very good and we found it very safe and comfortable.

So, if you can get a good price then this hotel is worth the money.

36,Disappointing,"I am a Hilton Gold Card member and I was very disappointed with the new Hilton Diagonal.  The staff was unfriendly and seemed put-out by any requests - they forgot to give us towels one evening and took 20 min to bring some up even though we told them it was a rush (my sister was IN the shower when she noticed the lack of towels).

The breakfast buffet was tasteless.  Most of the food was dry or overcooked.

Also, the location is not good for sightseeing - you must hop on the metro about three blocks away and ride for 20 min to get to the good areas.
",2,2005,12,19
36,Very Nice Hilton,"This hotel was very nice, beautiful decor and friendly staff. I am a HiltonHonors Gold member and have learned to be very cautious of the Hilton brand -basically a Hilton can be very nice or a crap-hole, one never knows. 

The Hilton Diagonal Mar in Barcelona is a great place to stay if you are traveling for business - it is next door to the convention center as well. 

One thing that was a bit odd was how long it took to do anything with the front desk (call cabs/check-in/ask a question/check out/etc...) I was there on business for 4 days and the hotel was packed so my experience may differ from most.
",4,2005,11,29
36,Nice Place to stay,"We stayed at the Hilton Diagonal Mar both before and after a cruise. The Hotel has only been open about three months but the service and accomodations seemed to be those of a well polished machine open for much longer.

We were upgraded to the Executive level on both stays and the lounge was very nice. Great food and beverages and a professional staff. 

The rools are modern and well equipped including a plasma  screen TV. the first stay was in corner room that had both a separate shower and bath while the second stay we had a room with just a bath/shower combo.

The staff were excellent and very helpful. Everyone spoke excellent english and quick to offer assisstance and advice when asked.

Across the street is a new shopping center with stores such as Zara, H&M and FNAC. The center also has many coffee bars that are usually full of Catalunyans enjoying the start of the evening.

The Metro is about a 10 minute walk and offers quick access to downtown, about 15 minutes away. Cabs are readily available and reasonable, about 25 Euros to the Airport or 30 Euros to the Cruise Terminal.

Even though the Hotel is removed from the downtown area, it is an excellent base of operations or to relax before or after a cruise.",4,2005,11,17

36,"Nice, beautiful hotel but staff attitude needs work","Stayed here for two nights - ""introductory rate"" but still pricey compared to other hotels.  Location is away from tourist center but transportation options are available, including subway and tram stops nearby.  Hotel was nearly brand-new at the time of stay, having been open since Aug 2005.  There is a nice mall across the street that has restaurants and a grocery store.

The good: Everything was new, clean, and modern.  Excellent water pressure in shower, bathroom fixtures were nice, bath towels are HUGE!  Plasma TV is a nice touch and the fitness center is impressive yet on the small side.

The bad: Customer service could have been a lot better, esp since this is supposed to be a top end hotel.  As a Hilton HHonors elite, I was denied benefits that are standard for Gold VIPs.  Breakfast in the restaurant was average but service was rushed.  Our roomkeys needed to be replaced every night, due to some glitch with the door lock.   Housekeeping staff were very intrusive.  

Overall, I liked this property but unless the rate was good, I would hesitate to stay there again.

36,Decepción,"Tengo una lesión cervical y solicite poder disponer de una almohada tipo tempur o similar. Envié mail 5 días antes 
No les constaba y no tenían carta de almohadas. Me sorprendió de una cadena de este nivel y en una ciudad como Barcelona

A parte la red wifi no funcionaba (al menos en mi habitación)

El dispensador de champú estuvo vacío dos días (los que yo estuve)

No había ni agua de cortesía.",3,2022,09,12
36,Totalmente desilusionado del hotel en general,"Es la segunda vez que vengo a este hotel y me quedan dos días más aquí. El servicio en la piscina es mediocre… muy poco espacio para uno si desea pasar un momento agradable y disfrutar del ambiente. Todo es ya reservado, la gente no tiene buen servicio al cliente en general.. tienen un tono de voz malcriado y de poca educación. Existen muchas opciones para estar en Barcelona de todo el tiempo que estuvimos aquí ni un día pudimos disfrutar de la piscina. Además el servicio de bartenders deja mucho que desear … uno pide un trago y parece que fuera que pidiéramos un favor. Creo que este hotel es un negocio y debe tener un mejor servicio al cliente.  Es nuestra segunda vez pero no creo is regresemos y no quiero que nadie de mis amigos de los Estados Unidos vengan aquí. I",1,2022,08,13
36,Wir hatten keine gute Zeit dort,"Für Urlaub machen ist es nicht zu empfehlen . Beim Essen am Frühstück ändert sich nichts immer

36,"Il peggiore Hilton del mondo , EVITATELO","Cari amici se mai un giorno pensaste di andare a Barcellona , città bellissima che vi consiglio , non fate il mio stesso errore , prenotare in questo pessimo albergo. Solitamente dormo scelgo sempre Hilton nel mondo perché è sinonimo di garanzia e qualità. Ma questo no. Personale poco qualificato , totalmente indisposto a risolvere le problematiche dei clienti , create dalla loro incompetenza. Non bastasse questo anche maleducati e aggressivi. Le camere mediocri. Ho chiesto di prenotarmi un ristorante ebbene mi hanno dato un tavolo vicino alle scale del bagno. Quindi sono andato via e non ho cenato vista l’ora tarda. Insomma una marea di incompetenti tutto insieme non lo avevo mai visti. Non vi fate ingannare dalle foto della piscina , che hanno dato in gestione e il week end poiché fanno entrare anche gli esterni all’hotel diventa un carnaio, inoltre è a pagamento ennesima presa in giro. Per concludere state lontani da questo hotel , vi consiglio senza ombra di dubbi di scegliere nella catena Marriott e sono certo che non avrete le mie sorprese. Non rovinandovi il soggiorno come è stato nel mio caso",1,2022,07,17
36,Als Pauschaltourist eine Enttäuschung,"Zunächst das positve: Das Hotel ist sauber, das Personal hilfsbereit und freundlich.
Das Frühstück ist sehr gut. Im Zimmer gibt es Safe, Sicherheit ist gut, man kann nur mit Karte in die oberen Etagen fahren. Der Meerblick im 13sten Stock findet zwischen 2 vorgelagerten Hochhäusen statt. Den Pool ,obwohl mit gebucht kann man, wenn überhaupt nur nutzen wenn man sich morgens in eine Warteschlange einreiht vor 11 Uhr. Ansonsten kosten Poolplätze  von 25-90 €. Mit Wartezeit. Beim Frühstück werden die Teller so schnell abgeräumt (immer wieder) das man das Essen teilweise noch im Mund hat, wenn der Teller weggezogen wird.Außerdem ist es dort laut. 

Ein Dose Cola kostet im Hotel 6€ gegenüber im Einkaufszentrum 87cent. Eine kleine Flasche Wasser schlägt mit 4,50€ zu Buche. Es gibt auf den Zimmern keine Toilettenbürsten, Toilettenpapier 1-lagig. Handtücher sind zwar ausreichend vorhanden, werden aber nicht immer ersetzt. Die Betten sind hart, ich hatte jeden Tag Rückenschmerzen, meine Frau jedoch nicht. .Da ich öfter mal in Deutschland in Hotels der 4 Sterne Kategorie bin, würde ich hier eher 3,5 Sterne vergeben.

Was noch: Taxi vom Flughafen kostet 42 Euro, mit dem Bus geht das für 15 Euro bei 2 Leuten. Wer das Taxi im Hilton bestellt wird wohl auch schon mal 90 € los.

Was das Essen angeht, im Zentrum Digaonal Mar gegenüber dem Hotel, gibt es einen sehr guten Italiener, la Tagiatelle. Sauber , gutes Essen  für 2 ca 35-40€ sehr gutes Restaurant. Die kleinen Essensläden im Zentrum sind nicht zu empfehlen, keine gute Qualität . Ansonsten gibt auch MC Donalds und Co und viele Geschäfte zum bummeln.",3,2022,04,23

36,"No recomendable por muy ruidoso, molesto para el entorno y no sostenible.","Tienen un bar-piscina al aire libre en el segundo piso del hotel con música discotequera a todo volumen. Parece ser que esencial para su negocio tener la música a tope porque cuando se pide que la bajen nunca lo hacen.

Il personale mi è sembrato un po’ spazientito, forse dall’elevato numero di clienti presenti, ma in linea di massima cordiale e disponibile. Servizio piscina con lettini/divani/puff buono se non per il fatto che possono entrare anche persone non clienti dell’albergo creando confusione e non garantendo sempre ai clienti la possibilità di usufruire di lettini/divani/puff.

36,Ganz o.k.,"Ich war zum ersten mal in diesem Hilton in Barcelona - für eine Nacht. Die Lage ist ganz o.k. - nicht allzu weit vom Strand entfernt / gleich nebenan ein Einkaufszentrum mit Restaurants. Das Hotel selbst sauber, modern ausgestattet - Zimmer geräumig. Zu beanstanden gibt es nur die lange Wartezeit beim Check-In - das bin ich als Gold Card-Besitzer eigentlich nicht gewohnt. Dass die Pool-Bar um 21.30 Uhr schließt finde ich auch o.k. - das man aber um 21.00 Uhr dort nichts mehr bekommt fand ich auch ziemlich schwach.",4,2021,06,14
36,Hay que mejorar algunos detalles,"El trato del personal excepcional, la habitación muy bien, el cuarto de baño deberían reformarlo o al menos cambiar la bañera que tiene varios agujeros tapados con masilla... por el precio de la noche esos detalles cuentan.

36,Grandioser Blick von der Executive Lounge,"Für uns war es nicht das erste Mal in Barcelona, aber unsere Premiere im Hilton Diagonal Mar. 

Das Hotel ist etwas abseits der Innenstadt gelegen, dennoch erreicht man diese in wenigen Minuten von der nahe gelegenen Metro-Station.

Die Zimmer - wir hatten ein Eckzimmer in der Executive-Kategorie - sind modern und geschmackvoll eingerichtet. Sowohl Business- als auch Privatreisende sollten sich hier wohlfühlen.

Besonders erwähnenswert ist die Lage der Gästen in der entsprechenden Zimmerkategorie oder Hilton Honors Diamond Mitgliedern vorbehaltenen Executive Lounge. Diese befindet sich auf der obersten Etage und verfügt als Highlight über eine Terrasse mit einem grandiosen Blick über die Stadt und zum Meer.

Wir würden das Hilton Honors Diagonal Mar jederzeit wieder besuchen.",5,2020,09,18

36,Einfach Barcelona ,"Wir haben uns für dieses Hilton entschieden da es am Strand liegt und man hier wunderbar joggen kann. Das Hotel selbst hat schöne Saubere Zimmer. Gegenüber ist ein Shoppingcenter mit typisch spanischen Marken. In der Nähe ist die gelbe Metroline. Zu den diversen Touristenattraktionen braucht man im Schnitt ungefähr 30 Minuten. Da geht eigentlich Zuviel Zeit verloren, wir würden uns das nächste mal für eine Hotel entscheiden, dass zentral liegt.

36,Posizione ottima e staff poliglotta.,"Siamo stati qui per capodanno e che dire... Posizione fantastica a due metri dalla metro, al mare e ad un centro commerciale fornito di tutto.
Staff gentilissimo e alla mano, praticamente tutti riuscivano (chi più chi meno) a parlare e a capire l'italiano.
Della struttura in se neanche mi soffermo, con il nome che porta andate sul sicuro, naturalmente il prezzo non è dei più bassi ma neanche così esagerato, consigliatissimo.",5,2020,01,23

36,Unser Hotel in BCN,"Das HiltonDiagonalMar ist mit dem eigenen Auto sehr gut und einfach zu erreichen. Ausreichend Tiefgaragenparkplätze im Hotel vorhanden. 
Wir kommen schon seit vielen Jahren ins Diagonal Mar und wurden noch nie enttäuscht. 
Bei Verfügbarkeit ist Hilton Diagonal immer sehr grosszügig und gibt gerne auch ab und an Zimmer-Upgrades.
Die Zimmer sind gross und schön. 
Wir hatten diesesmal z.B. ein Zimmer mit Meerblick in der 23. Etage und konnten jeden Morgen einen traumhaften Sonnenaufgang geniessen.
Badezimmer sind gross mit Badewanne UND separater Dusche. Das findet man nicht oft.
Schlafkomfort ist super. 
Frühstücksbuffet verdient eine 5 Sterne plus Bewertung. Qualität und Quantität und Auswahl und Auswahl ist schon fast einzigartig zu nennen. 

In 2-3 Minuten erreicht man die Strandpromenade und kann von dort in ca 1,5 Stunden ohne Unterbrechung, bis ins Zentrum laufen. Immer wieder ein Genuss. 

Über die Straße ist ein großes Einkaufszentrum: Diagonal Mar. 
Tram und Metro fussläufig vom Hotel in wenigen Minuten zu erreichen.

Das gesamte Personal ist äusserst hilfsbereit, professionell und freundlich. 
Insbesondere auch Frau Cecilia Lopez hat immer ein offenes Ohr für die Anliegen und Wünsche ihrer Gäste. Immer freundlich und Immer professionell. Sie gibt ihren Gästen das Gefühl im Diagonal Mar immer willkommen zu sein. Sie ist 1 Grund, dass wir immer wieder hierher kommen. 
Wir fühlen uns wohl hier. Es ist für uns immer wieder wie ein „nach Hause kommen“. Wir hoffen dass dies noch viele Jahre so bleibt. 
Kompliment Hilton Diagonal Mar.",5,2020,01,02
36,"Hardware gut, aber Executive Lounge unterirdisch!!!","Nachdem wir vor 3 Jahren unsere "" Erfahrungen"" im Hilton Madrid Airport machen durften, nun der neuste Bericht zum Diagonal Mar- fangen wir mit dem positiven an. Lage direkt gegenüber des größten EKZ von Barcelona, man kann super shoppen, und diverse Restaurationen und ein Supermarkt stehen auch zur Verfügung. In die Innenstadt geht man zu Fuss gute 40 Minuten, oder man nutzt die Bahn ( 3 Minuten vom Hotel entfernt), dann fährt man 10 Minuten ( Easy). Als Diamond erhält man bei Check IN üblicherweise ein Upgrade ( bei Verfügbarkeit)- und es waren Zimmer verfügbar ( kann man ja leicht mit dem Smartphone checken), aber wir bekamen keins, weil in unserem Zimmer für unsere Tochter ein Rollaway Bed im Zimmer bereitstand : auf gut Deutsch, man war zu faul, dieses Bett ( dauert 1 Minute!!), in ein Upgrade Zimmer zu rollen. Somit hatten wir ein Zimmer auf der 4. Etage ( Hotel hat 23), mit Blick auf den McDonalds erhalten- schlechter geht es kaum!!!. Von der Größe her war das Zimmer gut, das Bett auch, aber einen Samsung Smart TV zu verbauen, der nur VOX und Eurosport hat als deutsche Sender hat, ist vorsintflutlich. Das Bad war geräumig mit separater Dusche, Kaffee/Tee waren vorhanden. Die Lounge liegt auf Etage 15 mit schöner Terrasse. Alle Mitarbeiter waren dort freundlich, aber freundlich heisst nicht Kompetent!!. Halbe Croissants oder Kiwischeiben vom Obstsalat am Boden wurde dezent vom Personal übersehen ( Sicher ist das primär die Aufgabe des Gastes, der es fallen lässt aber auch hier waren in der Lounge vom Benehmen und vom Outfit her Gäste anzutreffen, wo man sich nur fragt, wie kommen die in die Lounge- nun Gut), und nicht entfernt- geht gar nicht. Das Frühstück in der Lounge ist klein, übersichtlich, jedoch NICHT fein- besser unten frühstücken, dort ist die Auswahl groß , aber es ist nicht der idyllischste Ort ( Laut und hektisch). Mittags besteht das Angebot in der Lounge aus Chips, Nüssen und Müsliriegeln- das wars- bis 18:00!- Dank wird das Buffet "" aufgefahren"", und so etwas habe ich bisher wirklich noch nie gesehen. Meine beiden Bilder zeigen wirklich alles, was es gab- es gibt nichts weiteres, kein Salat, kein Brot, keine Butter, keine Rohkost Sticks, Dips, Geschweige denn Nachtisch, NICHTS !! Nicht die elementarsten Sachen waren vorhanden.Und lecker war es auch noch nicht mal besonders. Eingig akzeptabel war das Wein/Sektangebot. Aber auch hier gilt: die Mitarbeiter haben Null Fingerspitzengefühl: am 31.12. war die Stimmung in der Lounge wirklich gut, und es war viel los, da könnte man ja mal die Lounge, anstatt bis 20:00 ein Stündchen länger auflassen- Nein, 20: ist Ende, keine Minute Länger( an Sylvester wohlbemerkt). Da fehlen so was von die Soft Skills!!!.",3,2020,01,02

36,Mangelhaft in manchen Dingen,"Mein Aufenthalt fand um Rahmen eines Kongressbesuchs im benachbarten Kongresszentrum statt- wahrscheinlich der Hauptgrund, warum man besseren Service nicht notwendig hat.

Zimmer sauber, Roomservice OK, eine stylische Bar sind sehr positiv zu erwähnen.
Negativ fällt der verlegene Blick zu Boden des Personals auf, als ich meine Koffer vom Taxi über einige Stufen zur Rezeption schleppe.

Die Aufzüge stellen die Geduld auf eine schwere Probe. Einige in der Reisegruppe hatten ebenso Diskussionen über Minibarabrechnungen, Kreditkartenabrechnungen etc., was ebenfalls einen nicht allzu professionellen Eindruck hinterließ.

Man kann als Kongressbesucher gleichpreisig besser wohnen. Jedoch nicht näher...",2,2019,11,08

36,Aufmerksames Hotel mit spitzen Mitarbeiter,"Wir sind spät angekommen, doch wir wurden unglaublich freundlich und sehr aufmerksam aufgenommen. Die Mitarbeiter Gabriele und Erica waren unfassbar schnell im System, ziemlich zuverlässig und sehr freundlich, wie selten.  Er hat schnell wahr genommen und realisiert, dass ich eine Ideen für die Stadt brauche. Nachdem ich meine Vorstellungen nannte, hatte er sofort einiges an Vorschlägen anbieten können. Endlich einer, der Bescheid weiß und versteht. Hier war ich mehr als beeindruckt! Erika hat dafür im Hotel alles ganz fix gemanagt und mehr als kompetent alle Fragen beantwortet. Aus dem Grund haben wir auch Ihre Anfrage mit Amex zu zahlen gerne positiv beantwortet. Sie ist mit Gabriel am Empfang für uns ein riesen Highlight, weil sie sehr positiv auf uns gewirkt haben. Wir sind hier direkt gut aufgenommen worden und das endlich mal von Mitarbeitern , die ihr Fach verstehen. Man merkt schnell, dass diese ihren Job mehr als nur ihren Job ansehen. Für meinen Teil bin ich endlich wieder positiv überrascht.  Vielen Dank an die beiden Mitarbeiter, so jung und so kompetent! Respekt!!
Des Weiteren ist uns der farbige junge Mitarbeiter aus dem Puro Beach als ein unglaublich aufmerksamer Mitarbeiter aufgefallen, der sehr gerne und sofort dabei war, wenn es um Fragen und Hilfe ging. Zudem hat er ein sehr gutes Gedächtnis seine Gäste wieder zuerkennen.  So etwas schätzen wir sehr.",5,2019,09,30

36,Könnte besser sein,"Die Zimmer sind ausreichend groß, gut ausgestattet und sauber. Der Geruch auf dem Gang teilweise unerträglich.

Muss jeder selbst entscheiden wie er das findet.",3,2019,09,04
36,Atemberaubender Blick!,"Mein Mann und ich haben hier im Dezember für 5 Nächte geschlafen. Das Hotel liegt etwas ausserhalb, hat aber eine super Anbindung an die Stadt nur wenige Gehminuten entfernt. Direkt gegenüber des Hotels befindet sich ein Einkaufszentrum mit mehreren Restaurants. Wir hatten ein Eckzimmer mit Zugang zur Executive -Lounge. Diese war gut ausgestattet und  bietet einen atemberaubenden Blick über Barcelona bei Tag und Nacht, einfach wundervoll! Das Zimmer war sauber und mit allem Notwendigen ausgestattet. Der Strand ist ebenfalls nur einige Minuten zu Fuss entfernt. Das Frühstück bietet eine gute Auswahl. Der Kaffee war für uns allerdings ungeniessbar. Wir haben das Restaurant in der Lobby einige Male besucht. Besonders lecker und absolut zu empfehlen war der Caesar Salad, einer der Besten, die wir je in einem Hilton gegessen haben! Das Personal war (ausser in der Lounge) etwas kühl und distanziert. Daran könnte man noch arbeiten. Wir kommen bei unserem nächsten Barcelona- Besuch gern wieder. ",5,2019,08,21
36,Bueno,"El hotel muy lindo la gente super amable y la ubicacion es muy comoda lejos del centro pero hay de todo cerca. Lo patetico es la piscina que te cobran las reposeras y te dan libre jn cubo donde tomar sol como adentro de una caja super incomodo y las reposeras son carisimas 
Otro tema importante el servicio de limpieZa durante 4 dias no nos saco los vasos sucios del dormitorio. El desayuno podria ser
Mejor eso si la vista es increible ",4,2019,08,18
36,"Alles da, aber sehr kommerziell und unpersönlich","Postiv hervorzuheben ist: 
Die Zimmer waren schön, sauber und gut ausgestattet (ordentlicher Föhn, Bügeleisen, Kühlschrank, Badewanne, ...). Das Frühstück war umfangreich und man bekommt alles von Brot über Müsli, Rührei, Baked Beans und frisch gepressten Säften.

Negativ aufgefallen ist: 
Die Geruchskulisse im Hotel war teilweise wirklich furchtbar. Die Eingangshalle war penetrant parfümiert und am Gang zum Zimmer roch es nach Urin.
Am Pool waren nur bestimmte Plätze gratis. Diese waren mit Glas abgetrennt und überdacht. Daher stand die Luft dort und es war sehr heiß. Die Getränkepreise am Pool waren ein Witz, satte 16€ zahlte man dort für einen ganz normalen Cocktail. Zusätzlich spielte dort laute Musik - also eher nichts zum entspannten Dösen.
Das Hotel dürfte gut gebucht gewesen sein aber das bekam man als Gast auch sehr zu spüren: Wartezeiten beim Einchecken, Anstehen beim Frühstück, Lärm im Frühstücksbereich, Warten auf den Lift, ausgelastetes Personal.

Fazit: insgesamt war alles Nötige da aber es war recht laut und überfüllt. Die Gemütlichkeit fehlte einfach.",3,2019,08,08
36,Mala experiencia,Me ofrecieron un departamento para 4 personas y me dieron una habitación con un sofá cama. Si sos huésped del hotel en la pileta no podes acceder a las sillas bajo el sol tenes que ir a unas que están bajo un techo o pagar 30 euros por persona. El parking me dijeron que era sin cargo y dos veces quisieron cobrármelo. Mucho que mejorar por el precio que tiene.,2,2019,08,03

36,"Nur als Kongresshotel ok, sonst enttäuschend","Anlässlich einer Tagung im nahegelegenen Kongresscenter (3min zufuss) waren wir 3 Nächte hier und nicht übermässig begeistert. Die Hoteleinrichtung Businessstandard, die Bar speziell, eher ein Barspace, die Zimmer sauber, normal gross. Unser Zusatzbett für die kleine Tochter wurde trotz Nachfrage vergessen, so dass wir nach dem Abendessen das gegen 23 Uhr nochmal reklamieren mussten. Der Frühstücksraum eng und sehr laut, die Auswahl ok, das Omelett sehr gut. Aber dass man vergessen hatte, genug Butter zu bestellen, ist für ein HiltonHotel fast undenkbar. Das Personal an der Rezeption ebenso wechselhaft.  2 junge Katalanen waren supernett und hilfreich (vor allem bei Restaurantempfehlungen), die anderen (deutsch?) etwas überfordert, aber stets bemüht.
Der Swimmingpool mit Beachathmossphäre und Spa zwar schön, aber Speisen/Getränke unverschämt teuer (Bier 10.-€, Glas Wein 12.-€, normaler Hamburger mit kleiner Pommes 22.-€) und die Musik so übertrieben laut, so dass man sich kaum unterhalten konnte. Erholen konnte man sich da nicht. Wir hatten dann nach einem etwas abgelegeneren Daybed gefragt und hätten dafür 500.-€/Tag zahlen sollen. Der Swimmingpool übrigens nicht geheizt und das Wasser eiskalt.

U Bahn und Bus ein paar Meter entfernt und man ist mit ÖPV in 20 Minuten im Zentrum.
2018 fand ich die Lobby und Bar nicht schön; komisch abgetrenntes Restaurant/ jetzt super schick renoviert und umgebaut; offene Küche mit Tischen „in“ der Küche und der Barbereich ist sehr gut geworden- ",4,2019,03,08

36,Nichts Besonderes,"Wir waren über Silvester in diesem Hotel für 3 Nächte. Das Hotel würden wir nicht mehr buchen, da die Zimmer zum Teil sehr abgewohnt sind und bei Ankunft nicht richtig sauber waren. 

Wie überall auf der Welt, sind in den Hiltonhotels überall Asiaten. Es ist sehr anstrengend, da sie sehr laut sind und auch keinen Anstand haben.

36,Immer wieder gerne!!!,"Hallo Leute, ich bin ziemlich überzeugt. Viele finden es nicht in Ordnung, dass das Hotel nicht im Zentrum liegt... die Lage des Hotels hat mir am meisten gefallen. Ja, man fährt mit dem Bus und U-Bahn etc. wie ein Tourist. Aber nach einem lautem Tag herrscht im Hotel Ruhe.
Gut ausgestattete Zimmer, super Matratze, fabelhafte Aussicht. Frühstück ist optimal. Personal an der Rezeption ist sehr professionell. Danke für alles!
Nächstes mal werde ich wieder im Hilton buchen.

36,Confort!,"Tras la reforma, es un gran hotel. Habitaciones amplias y con muchas comodidades (enchufes usb y en la mesilla, camas muy amplias, baño y ducha, toallas de tocador). El desayuno es de gran calidad (buena fruta fresca por ejemplo), con detalles como una vajilla bonita. 
El executive lounge tiene una vistas y una terraza espectaculares, y el desayuno que sirven aqui es variado aun siendo mas pequeño.
Justo frente al hotel hay un centro comercial por si no te queda otra que cenar en la zona.
La ubicacion es perfecta para salir a correr, por la linea de la costa, y tiene un gimnasio bastante completo.
Muy a gusto y lo volveria a escoger.

In der grossen Badewanne kann man gemütlich entspannen.

36,Hotel para reuniones y negocios.,"Hotel un poco impersonal, como los de negocios, cerca del palacio congresos y muy alejado de la zona comercial y neurálgica del centro ( personalmente , prefiero alojamiento más céntrico). Entiendo que se priorice zona de trabajo.",4,2018,11,25
36,Così cosi,"500 Mt dalla spiaggia, 300 Mt dal centro congressi. Barrio front marítim del poblenou. Il classico business hotel della catena Hilton, arredato con stile e colori che rendono l ambiente  impersonale. Suite spaziosa,letto cómodo, bel bagno, belle le tv, bella la vista ai piani alti. 
Per qualche strana ragione il divano letto del salotto lo abbiamo trovato aperto come se ci dovesse dormire qualcuno (eravamo in 2) e così è rimasto per l intero soggiorno. In dotazione c'è la macchinetta per il caffè ma abbiamo trovato una sola cialda e solo il primo giorno.
Le vetrate sono molto belle ma personalmente  non poter aprire le finestre mi crea problemi.
Non amo per nulla la profumazione delle camere, ero proprio infastidita.
Colazione all'8 piano abbastanza fornita. 
Avevamo a disposizione l accesso alla lounge bar del 15 piano ma non ne abbiamo mai usufruito.
Insomma, non lo consiglierei per  trascorrere una vacanza però  se si è in città per affari  qualche giorno ci si può stare.

36,Alojados alli por error de otro hotel,"Nos mandaron alli porque nuestro hotel tuvo un problema en la central de reservas y bueno en principio ellos lo gestionaron bien y con amabilidad.La estancia era de fin de semana ya que ibamos a un festival que se hace en la playa de alli mismo.La habitacion es una pasada y estaba limpia pero la puntuacion se basa en todo y la verdad q dejaron que desear en muchas cosas.
Nos comentaron en recepcion que por el error cometido en las gestiones de reserva teniamos pagados los desayunos y las tasas de alojarse en barcelona ( esto ultimo nos parecio raro pero bueno) y cuando llegamos a desayunar el sabado tuvimos q estar en la recepcion del comedor pasando verguenza porque nadie sabia nada y si no me llego a fijar en el nombre de la persona q nos atendio nos kedamos alli pasando verguenza y sin desyunar.Segun ellos no apreciamos en el sistema por ninguna lado.
Por otro lado, subimos a la terraza de la piscina a tomar una copa y si , pagas un riñon porque estas en el hilton pero tambien te tienes que comer ver una pelea en la que estan involucrados camareros y clientes...no sabiamos donde meternos
Y por ultimo por supuesto, al dejar la habitacion obviamente tuvimos que pagar las tasas de dormir en barcelona como nosoros suponiamos",2,2018,10,17
36,Nie mehr Clubzimmer buchen.,"Wir waren 3 Nächte in einem gebuchten Clubzimmer untergebracht.
Jeden Abend war Rambazamba in diesem Club.Kleine Kinder ranten schreiend umher und eine Gruppe Männer gesetzten Alters brachten ihre eigene Soundbox in die Clublounge mit und höhrten in einer überlauten Stärke den alten Hits zu und alle mussten diese Musik mithören.Auch war nach einer Stunde der gesamte Bestand an Sparklingwein aufgebraucht und der Club hatte keine Flaschen mehr und niemand brachte neunen.
Am ersten Abend haben wir uns dann beim Clubpersonal beschwert und das hatte aber so gar nichts gebracht, da es am zweiten Abend genaus so wieder war.

36,Hilton: una garanzia,"Che dire, la fama di questa catena viene confermata quando usufruisci dei loro alberghi. A me è capitato di passare una notte in questo hotel di Barcellona in zona abbastanza centrale (3 km dalle Ramblas) e comunque vicino a stazioni del metró e ben servito. Camere ampie, luminose e molto confortevoli. Colazione molto ben fornita con proposte dolci e salate per tutti i gusti.

No lo veo nada higiénico si después tienen que estar manipulando bebidas y comidas. Sus superiores tendrían que dar la vuelta al hotel y verían de lo que hablo, porque no es que estén en un callejón, están en la zona de paso para las oficinas, el Centro de Congresos y el edificio de oficinas de la Generalitat",1,2018,10,10

36,Fantastico! ,"Nulla da dire, é stato tutto perfetto nonostante il soggiorno di una sola notte. 
Le camere sono bellissime, il bagno é provvisto di bidet (per un italiano trovarlo fuori dall’Italia é più unico che raro), pulite e confortevoli. 
Il personale é sempre stato cordiale, sorridente e disponibile. 
Abbiamo usufruito della colazione e la scelta e la qualità hanno superato le aspettative! 
Chiaramente non é tra gli hotel più economici ma ne vale davvero la pena!

36,Muy mala calidad precio,"Relación calidad precio muy mala. Para nada los servicios van acordes a la calidad general del hotel. Y tanto el minibar como el bar y el restaurante e incluso el servicio de Internet de pago son muy caros en relación a la calidad del hotel.

36,Altamente recomendado,"La verdad que fue una experiencia excelente hospedarse en Hilton.Todo lo que uno espera del hotel, lo tenes en este hotel. Limpieza, servicio, comidas, ubicacion, amenities.

Cuando yo fui habia salmon ahumado espectacular.Lo recomiendo 100% en todas las areas.",5,2018,09,26

Para lo que cobraron por una habitación superior, no era para tirar cohetes, pero buenos, es aceptable. Pero no puede ser que esté 4 semanas esperando una factura, que la reclame y no se me haga caso. Soy miembro de Hilton Honors.. si esto sigue asi, que no me esperen mas¡¡",2,2018,09,20
36,Würde ich auch privat gerne besuchen!,"Vom Flughafen aus ist das Hotel ohne Transfer mit einem Zwischenstopp innerhalb von 45 min. zu erreichen.

Das Hotel hat eine relativ knappe Entfernung zum Strand und liegt trotzdem sehr zentral, was in Barcelona ja nicht oft üblich ist.

Frühstück war mehr als ausreichend! Es gab ein Riesen Buffett und man kann sich aufjedenfall dran satt essen. 

Die Zimmer waren sauber und sehr modern. Genau wie es die Produktbeschreibung verspricht.

Ich empfehle den Gästen aufjedenfall ein Zimmer in der höheren Etage, man hat von dort aus einen wunderschönen Blick auf den Pool und aufs Meer. In anderen Zimmern hat man einen Blick auf das Diagonal Mar Shopping-Center.

Da ich nur geschäftlich eine Nacht dort war, konnte ich leider nicht ganz so viele Eindrücke sammeln. Ich würde trotzdem aufjedenfall privat hier wieder buchen!

36,"Muy buen hotel, perfectamente localizado y con un personal amable y muy profesional.","Hotel de muy buena calidad, habitaciones amplias y muy cómodas. Personal muy eficiente, atento y profesional. Muy buen desayuno. El único punto ""negro"" unos precios abusivos en el PuroBeach, 16 euros por un vaso de sangría, es excesivo.",4,2018,09,11
36,schönes Hotel - KEIN Kundenservice!,"Das Hotel selbst ist wunderschön und sauber, aber leider macht der fehlende Kundenservice alles kaputt! Beim Check-in wurden wir gefragt, ob wir ein großes Bett oder zwei separate Betten haben möchten. Haben uns für seperate Betten entschieden. Im Zimmer angekommen, es war ein großes Bett! Eigentlich war es uns eh egal, aber wozu wird man eigentlich gefragt?! An unserem letzten Tag fragten wir nach einem Late Check-out. Die Dame an der Rezeption meinte, dass das nicht möglich wäre, weil das Hotel ausgebucht sei. Als ich dann sagte, dass wir auch dafür zahlen, war es auf einmal doch möglich! Aber 74€ für DREI Stunden?! Außerdem wollten wir Karten bei der Rezeption zum verschicken abgeben, was bis jetzt in keinem anderen Hotel ein Problem war, aber 2€ PRO KARTE zu verlangen ist schon sehr frech! 
Ansonsten: Frühstück war wirklich gut und wir hatten dann auch noch ein paar sehr entspannte Tage am Puro Beach.",3,2018,09,11

Zu Fuß zum Strand in 5 gemütlichen Minuten, mit toller Infrastruktur (Hotelgast mit Rollstuhl konnte fast bis zum Wasser fahren, Toiletten, Duschen etc.).  Tolles Frühstück, unbedingt beim peruanischen Eierkoch vorbeischauen, seine Omeletts sind Klasse!",5,2018,09,09
36,No defrauda,"La cadena Hilton suele ser una apuesta segura, y en el caso de este hotel no defrauda. Cumple con las expectativas. Las habitaciones son amplias y cómodas, con todos los servicios y facilidades. Si además se tiene la suerte de estar en las plantas superiores, las vistas son increíbles, tanto del mar como de la ciudad. 
El gimnasio y la piscina también están muy bien, para complementar la estancia al hotel. El desayuno muy completo y con mucha variedad. Como en todos los bufets, encuentras lo mismo cada día, pero al haber tanta variedad se puede ir cambiando según el día.
Estuve alojada por un meeting de trabajo y los salones también son cómodos. A decir que hacía un poco de frío, suelen pasarse con los aires acondicionados. El bufet de la comida y los coffee break un poco repetitivos, sobretodo el bufet de la comida. Pero para 2 días se sobrevive. 
Para el que quiera hacer turismo, está un poco lejos del centro, pero bien comunicado con metro y autobuses con toda Barcelona.",5,2018,09,08
36,Ruido infernal en la terraza,"Vivo a unos 100 metros del Hilton Diagonal Mar de Barcelona y no puedo recomendarlo a compañeros de trabajo y amigos que vienen muy a menudo de Madrid, a pesar de que me gusta, porque tienen una terraza en la que ponen música (de pésimo gusto, aunque eso es personal) a un volumen que supera, y con mucho, los decibelios permitidos.
Hemos llamado muchas veces varios vecinos de mi comunidad para quejarnos porque tenemos que estar con las puertas de la terraza cerradas para no oír tal estruendo, pero no hacen caso. Lo que no entiendo es como lo permiten los clientes de dicho hotel, que se supone que es de alto standing y las habitaciones no son precisamente baratas.
Me parece intolerable que no cuiden el descanso de sus clientes y de paso nos priven del silencio deseado y al que tenemos derecho a todos los que vivimos alrededor.",1,2018,08,29
36,Vacanza a Barcellona,"Hotel bello ci sono già stato anni fa. Ora più comodo in quanto che è raggiungibile con i mezzi pubblici metro e tram anche dall’aeroporto El Prat. L’hotel ha un piscisa gradevole fino ad anni fa... ora pretendono che uno paghi 20€ per poter stare vicino la piscina, chiamata puro beach! assolutamente ridicolo inaccettabile! Un ospite dell’hotel ha già pagato nel soggiorno l’accesso e uso della struttura alberghiera. Se non si vuole pagare, si viene indirizzati e confinati in una vasta area di “seconda classe” coperta da un enorme pergolato, dove le travi di legno ovviamente proiettano la loro ombra d non consente di prendere il sole agevolmente. La mia camera come segnalato imnediamente aveva uno strano odore così anche in parte il corridoio fuori. Sicuramente dovuto alla moquette sporca/umida in precedenza. Non sono riuscito a cambiare camera... la scusa era che era al completo. In 8 giorni hanno passato l’aspirapolvere non oh di 3 volte! Ho atteso 3 giorni per far regolare correttamente l’orario della radiosveglia. Alcuni soggetti delfront desk contattati hanno dato informazioni sbagliate sull’orario di chiusura del servizio della linea gialla della metro fermata fucina hotel El Maresme Forum, trovando chiuso l’accesso perché tardi. Colazione ottima, e ottima la scelta di tutti i cibi. Personale di sala molto gentile e simpatico. Unica pecca è la velocità con cui ritirano piatti posate ecc. anche con il contenuto da finire😂. Se per caso ti alzi a prendere qualcosa al buffet tornando indietro spesso era stato portato via. L’holte recentemeteristrutturato presenta alcuni difetti progettuali nel bagno. Lavandino troppo piccolo e basso posto su un banco e di vetro, rubinetto troppo altro. Risultato a causa dell’ata Pressione dell’ac Ogni volta che si apre schizza ovunque, specchio, pavimento sul banco di vetro e su se stessi sui vestiti. Non hanno pensato di separe con una porta scorrevole la zona WC e Bidet. Hanno posto un supporto per porre la salvietta del Bidet ad un’altezza di circa 1,30 sulla parete laterale dietro le spalle.... la parete in vetro posta sul bordo della vasca per far in modo che possa essere utilizzata come doccia è troppo corta, risultato ad ongni doccia corrisponde un inondazione del bagno. Per asciugare si utilizzano i candidati grandi asciugamani, aumentando oltre ai costi, risorse dell’hotel stesso, ma che inquinamento, e tempi del personale per rifare camere. Posizione tranquilla anche se un po’ periferica fuori dalle orde e dal caos turistico. Spiaggia vicina raggiungibile a piedi. Inoltre difronte hanno aperto un centro commerciali dove trova di tutto.",4,2018,08,26
36,DECEPCIÓN,"No daba crédito a todos los comentarios malos que daban del hotel, pero se han confirmado, la música de la piscina se escuchaba hasta la 8 planta, las tuberías hacían mucho ruido, la moqueta pese a estar limpia no era apta para alérgicos, la moqueta de los pasillos tenía un olor desagradable, 4 ascensores para tantas plantas provoca horas puntas donde la espera es muy larga. En aspectos positivos la cama era muy grande y cómoda y el desayuno bufet estaba bastante completo, aunque sólo habían dos maquinas de café muy lentas y no daban la temperatura que se espera de un café recién hecho. El córner de las tortillas muy completo, el personal atento y con una sonrisa.",3,2018,08,24

36,increíble....,"No es la primera vez que me pasa en un hotel en Barcelona. Y es que aquí siempre somos más papistas que el papa. Explico el tema: solicito una reserva. La hago en catalán, corta y sencilla, de buen entender. Respuesta en inglés...Ni una palabra en español... Considero que ni ha habido profesionalidad (si la persona es extranjera lo primero que debe de aprender, en un cargo de atención, es el idioma local, catalán o español) ni cortesía ni interés (hay mecanismos de traducción fáciles de utilizar). Y en un hotel de estas categoría lo considero inadmisible e irrespetuoso.",1,2018,08,22
36,Fantastico ,"Struttura moderna situati a pochi km dalla barceloneta. Le camere sono spaziose e pulite, dotate di tutti i confort. All ultimo piano vi è una sala ristoro sempre a disposizione dei clienti. Il personale è educato e preparato. Sicuramente uno dei migliori hotel in zona.",5,2018,08,20
36,Empeñados en Atender,"Estuve con mi familia 4 noches. Hotel lleno y sin embargo el empeño en atender fue muy bueno. Especial reconocimiento al equipo que trató de los desayunos.

36,"Bella la struttura, servizio mediocre","La struttura è molto bella, le stanze pulite e arredate con pezzi di design, la vista sulla città meravigliosa. Ma andiamo oltre. Prendendo in considerazione che si parla di un hotel Hilton, mi aspettavo un servizio adeguato. La colazione un caos totale, troppi ospiti per lo spazio a disposizione. Camerieri che corrono a destra e sinistra, gente che urla. Per altro non credo che il prezzo sia adeguato all'offerta. L'hotel è dotato di una bellissima piscina su terrazza e di una palestra attrezzata. Personale alla reception e nel Lounge al 15 piano, disponibile e gentile. ",3,2018,08,17

Trato cordial, muy buena relación precio y calidad.
En el piso 15 se encuentra el Executive lounge, en el cual  dan servicio durante el día de comidas y bebidas.
La atención fue excelente de todo el staff.
Hotel cerca de las playas, frente al centro comercial Diagonal Mar , ubicado en zona de tranquilidad aunque sea lugar vacacional por la temporada.
Excelente y cordial atención en todos los sectores del Hotel.

36,Leider nur ein Ok,"Wir hatten zu 10 dort zwei Tage übernachten wollen. Die Lage des Hotels ist nahe am Strand gelegen und somit super. Mit dem Taxi kommt man schnell ins Zentrum oder zu den Party Locations ( Carpe Diem, W-Tower). Haben ca. 10€ für das Taxi gezahlt. Neben dem Hotel ist das Diagonal Mar, ein Einkaufszentrum. Das Frühstück für ca. 21€ haben wir dankend abgelehnt (meiner Meinung überteuert) und sind dann an den Strand zur Beach bar oder ins Einkaufszentrum für ein kleines Frühstück gegangen. Im zweiten OG auf dem Tag ist das Purobeach eine coole Poolanlage. Ebenso hat es ein Fitnessstudio. Zimmer waren sauber doch wir hatten massiv Probleme beim Check in. 3 Leute hatten eine Suite gebucht und wurden kurz nah 16 Uhr auch vertröstet dass die “Suite” nicht fertig sei obwohl ein Check in ab 16 Uhr möglich sei. Am Ende war es ein Zweibettzimmer in dem man ein simples drittes Bett ( einfaches Gestell plus Matratze) in die Ecke geschoben hat. Und für den Preis denke ich kein Hiltonanspruch. Check in hat auch sehr lange gedauert. Vielleicht haben wir hier nur einen schlechten Tag erwischt. ",3,2018,08,12
36,"Kongresshotel, aber auch perfekt für einzeln Reisende","Wer ein grosses professionelles Hotel sucht, ist hier richtig. Es liegt etwas ausserhalb des Zentrums je nach Destination  5 -10 Stationen entfernt. Wir waren schon viele Male hier und wurden auch diesmal nicht enttäuscht.  

Die Zimmer sind schön und sauber, teilweise mit Blick auf das Meer. Einige Zimmer wurden gerade eben geschmackvoll renoviert. Moderne und trotzdem gemütlich. 

Das Frühstücksbuffet ist genau so, wie man es von Hilton erwartet. Sehr gute Auswahl und guter Service. Der Speisesaal ist meist ziemlich überfüllt und deshalb zu den Stosszeiten etwas lärmig. 

Schöner Pool-Bereich (Puro Beach). Dieser hat aber auch seinen Preis. 

Wer ein Executive Zimmer hat kann auch die schöne Lounge benützen. Die Apéro-Zeiten wurden etwas eingeschränkt. Dafür wurde die Qualität des Essens verbessert. Die Lounge wurde renoviert und vergrössert. Es hat jetzt mehr Platz, dafür war es vorher gemütlicher. Wir lieben die schöne Dachterrasse. Es gibt kein Empfangspersonal mehr, was schade ist und alles unpersönlich wirken lässt. 

Wir kommen immer wieder gerne zurück und schätzen es sehr, vom aufmerksamen Personal als wiederkehrende Gäste erkannt zu werden. ",5,2018,08,11
36,"Tolles Hotel, miserabler Service","Ich war vor kurzem in diesem Hotel Gast einer mehrtägigen Konferenz. Ein Teil der Gäste dieser Konferenz war auch in diesem Hotel untergebracht, ich gehörte zu einer Gruppe die in einem anderen nahegelegenen Hotel untergebracht war. Am letzten Tag - ich hatte in den anderen Hotel bereits ausgecheckt - fragte ich nach ob man mein Gepäck aufbewahren könne, was man mir verneinte, da ich kein Zimmer in dem Hotel hätte. Auch ein Verweis auf die Konferenz brachte keine Änderung, so das am letzten Tag mit mir etliche Teilnehmer mit ihrem Gepäck im Ballsaal saßen.",2,2018,08,10
36,Pésimo,"El estado de conservacion de las habitaciones da pena. La primera noche no tuvimos agua caliente y nos la arreglaron al dia siguiente, pero aun no funciono del todo. Nos hospedamos en una executice room y los de recepcion no sabian ni que horario hacia el executive lounge. No hay ni agua gratuita en las habitaciones executive. La piscina no es del hotel y tienes que pagar para usar las tumbonas.  Desorganizacion como nunc he visto para hacer el checkout. Etc etc etc. No volveremos y recomiendo que nadie lo haga. Hay hoteles mucho mejores justo al lado.",1,2018,08,08
36,Hotel con buena ubicacion y servicios,"El hotel esta en una ubicacion muy buena si lo que buscas es relajarte, a un paso de la playa, junto a un centro comercial para comer y comprar, cerca de la estacion de metro y a pocos minutos del puerto deportivo de barcelona.

La habitación del hotel esta muy bien, cama amplia y buenos detalles en la habitación, ademas de un buen servicio de habitaciones. Las vistas de la piscina desde la habitación son muy agradables. 

El servicio por parte de los trabajadores es excelente y el desayuno del hotel es muy bueno. La piscina esta muy bien estilo modernos con hamacas y musica del club pure beach. La unica pega son las hamacas de la piscina, si quieres estar en primera fila de la piscina tendras que pagar por ello, ya que las primeras hamacas ( y mejores) son para los socios del club ”Pure Beach” o previo pago de 20€, sino te corresponden las hamacas que estan mas al final.

En general un gran hotel para relajarte y desconectar.",5,2018,08,07
36,POCO PROFESIONALES,"Poco profesionales en el bar del hotel.Fuimos cuato personas a tomar una copa y pedimos cuatro gin tonics MARTIN MILLER.Nos trajeron cuatro copas, que no eran las globo donde se sirven habitualmente.Lo peor fue cuando ya no trajeron la botella ,sino que ya venian con la ginebra puesta...No sabemos si es la que pedimos....Es la primera vez que nos ocurre esto.Lo que venia en botella son las tonicas.
La carta no se corresponde con lo que luego nos cobraron.Un desastre.Nos cobraron por las cuatro copas, 74 euros",1,2018,08,05

Las habitaciones son más pequeñas que lo que suelen ser en los Hilton, aunque es entendible siendo que en Europa en general las habitaciones son más pequeñas. En términos generales estuvo bien.",4,2018,07,22
36,Era todo perfecto hasta q....,"Una semana de estadía. Hice upgrade de habitación. Disfruté del executive lounge. Ideal x la distancia al CCIB donde asistí a un congreso y con el shopping enfrente. Personal amable. Excelente desayuno. El último día antes del check out voy a la piscina, me acomodo alrededor de la misma y al rato una señorita viene a echarme xq el purobeach es un club privado, con las mejores ubicaciones y sillones para sus socios y NO para los pasajeros del hotel. A esos un rincón de 4 reposeras alejadas de la piscina. Me escoltaron hacia afuera como una delincuente delante del resto.

36,Tutto perfetto,"Ho soggiornato per 5 notti in questo splendido albergo, nulla da dire, tutte le aspettative sono state rispettate.
Camera pulita, personale cordiale.
Fantastica la piscina al secondo piano dove si possono ordinare dei cocktail veramente buoni.
Ci tornerò sicuramente ",5,2018,06,29
36,Sehr schönes Hotel mit schlechtem Service!,"Ich war Geschäftlich mit Kunden in diesem Hotel und wurde zuerst mit höflichkeit beim Check-In überrascht und mein Zimmerwunsch wurde berücksichtigt. Der erste Schock kam im Purobeach Club, als ich ein Bier bestellt habe. Ich bekam ein 3dl Bier und verrechnet wurde mir ein 5dl Bier für satte 10€. Als ich an der Bar recklamierte, wurde mir gesagt, dass es 0.48 dl Bier waren. Tischreservationen für 30 Leute im Purobeach Club für das WM Spiel wurde in der Lobby vorbereitet und nicht auf der Terrasse im Purobeach. Gruppenmenue wurde nicht verrechnet wie abgesprochen, sondern um einige hundert € erhöht. Sieht für mich aus wie gezielte Abzocke. Hotel hat eine super Lage und schöne Zimmer, der Service vor Ort im Purobeach Club eine Katastrophe.",3,2018,06,26
36,Excelente Hotel!,"El hotel es realmente increíble! 
Nos asignaron una habitación con vista al mar, súper amplia, silenciosa y cómoda.
La piscina y toda él área de puro beach es increíble, con música y atención para no dejar de disfrutar.

36,Noche de bodas,"Para nuestra boda, mi marido se hizo la sesion de fotos con su familia en el hotel. Y fue de maravilla. Con globos, champan y tarta incluida. Pasamos la noche de bodas ahi y al dia siguiente en la piscina con desayuno, comida y en la balinesa. Todo expectacular. Un servicio increible. Lo recomiendo al 100%.",5,2018,06,16
36,hotel  per affari,Ero in questa città per un congresso ed ho deciso di prenotare l'albergo in cui si svolgeva il congresso. La camera era spaziosa e ben arredata. Il centro congressi è organizzato bene e il personale era gentile. I prezzi sono molto alti rispetto alla qualità in generale che viene offerto.,4,2018,06,10
36,Tolles Hotel,Das Hotel liegt neben dem Forum(Festival u. Messegelände) und gegenüber einer schönen und großen Shopping Mall. Sehr freundlicher Service. Die Zimmer sehr schon und sauber. Lärmdichte Fenster. Das Frühstück im 1. Stock sehr großzügig und bietet allen etwas. Die Lounge modern und schön gestaltet. Essen dort gut(mehr abwechslung wäre gut(weniger Nudelgerichte)). Die Terasse lädt zum sonnen und drausen sitzen ein mit tollem Ausblick. Flotter freundlicher Service. Zum (eher für Einheimische) Strand läuft man 2 Minuten. Tolle Prominade zum Laufen und Sport machen.,5,2018,06,01
36,"MUY DECEPCIONANTE ,","Habitación con ruido constante de tuberías , avisado el servicio técnico me dice el señor que no pueden pedir a todas las plantas que dejen de usar el inodoro¡¡¡ que por tanto no se puede hacer nada.Parece increíble que un hotel pueda permitirse el lujo de tener estas instalaciones produciendo semejante sonido de catarata continuo y no haber insonorizado al menos las tuberías, pues no, se encuentran detrás de una puerta con cerradura que a mi juicio aumenta el sonido .. En fin no es el primer año que vengo y nunca había tenido problemas así que ojo habitaciones que hacen esquina , con numero 04 al final.
No lo recomiendo en absoluto es un sorteo que acabes durmiendo bien o con tremendo dolor de cabeza.",2,2018,05,31
36,Weekend a Barcellona,"Come Struttura in sè non c'è che dire, pulita accogliente, confortevole, cambiano ogni giorno gli asciugamani e i prodotti per il bagno! Bella vista la camera dall'alto! C'è anche una palestra! Colazione a buffet abbondante con tante varietà, unica pecca le marmellate che sono più che confetture frutta schiacciata - senza zucchero. Un'altra cosa da dire è la distanza dell'Hotel dal centro, ci si impiega un po' soprattutto con la metro, forse conviene di più spostarsi con il bus. Per il resto  è vicino ad un centro commerciale con diversi negozi per fare shopping.",4,2018,05,28
36,Buen hotel para congresos,"Al lado del Centro de Convenciones y Congresos (100 metros) en la misma acera, en Poblenou, barrio alejado del centro, aunque en la misma costa y a 300 metros de la playa.
Edificio moderno, agradable, personal atento y rápido, habitaciones muy cómodas y limpias. 
Grandes vistas.

36,Bello pulito comodo,Ho alloggiato qui con la mia famiglia per una vacanza di 4 giorni. L’hotel non è in centro ma é comodissimo. Vicino c’é la metropolitana e la fermata di 2 bus turistici uno dei quali fa proprio il centro. Davanti c’é un enorme centro commerciale aperto dal lunedi al sabato fino alle 21. Il piano superiore é pieno di bar e ristoranti. All’interno l’hotel è bello e pulito. La zona piscina é molto carina. C’è una palestra. Le camere sono nuove e spaziose. Bagno grande con vasca e doccia. Lo consiglio vivamente. Ps fatevi prenotare le biciclette. La ciclabile parte da qui e procede per tutta Barcellona. Inoltre la notte la bici si puó lasciare in garage.,4,2018,05,04
36,Una experiencia increíble!,"Estuvimos sólo dos días, pero no podrían haber sido mejores.. la calidad del hotel, todos y cada uno de los servicios. La comida del restaurante estaba deliciosa y el desayuno buffet uno de los mejores que he tenido! Y para mí sin duda alguna lo mejor de la estancia fue el trato que tuvimos gracias A Dalila la cual tuvo unos detalles maravillosos con nosotras. 
La localización es perfecta, cerca de todo pero más aún de la playa! No podríamos haber elegido un hotel mejor.",5,2018,04,22

36,Sehr schön gelegenes Hotel.,Wir kamen mit einer Gruppe von ca. 50 Personen am späten Nachmittag im Hotel an. Es wurden sofort noch 2 Mitarbeiter an die Rezeption beordert. Frühstücksbuffet sehr vielfältig. Der Blick aus dem 17. Stock über Barcelona hinweg ist atemberaubend.,4,2018,03,04
36,"Più business che tourism, ma ok","Premessa: se volete un hotel romantico nel cuore della Barcellona storia, questo non fa per voi. Qui siamo nella parte moderna, tra un centro commerciale e il mare, con una bella spiaggia davanti, ma relativamente lontani dalle Ramblas & co. Che può essere anche un pregio, sotto il profilo della tranquillità. Ciò detto, l'albergo offre camere un po' anonime ma confortevoli, servizi ineccepibili, una colazione di grande livello (cara, se non è compresa nella tariffa). Mi sembra ottimo per chi viaggia per affari: oltretutto, è vicino all'uscita dalla città in direzione della Francia (meno comodo per l'aeroporto). Ho provato anche il ristorante al pian terreno: discreto, servizio corretto, qualche tapas, carne, salmone, piatti standard internazionali e paella, ma minimo per due persone.",4,2018,03,04
36,Big Event in Big Hotel,"Ich war aufgrund einer Tagung 2 Tage in diesem Hotel und kann nur positives berichten. Die Lobby mit den großen Glaswänden machte den Raum lichtdurchflutet, obwohl wir eigentlich schlechtes Wetter an dem Tag hatten. Das Zimmer war schön und mit Meerblick. Frühstück üppig, wenn auch der Kaffee zu wünschen übrig ließ. Dafür haben sie mit dem Mittagessen aufgeholt.",5,2018,03,03

36,Rasenta la perfezione,"Che dire, rasenta la perfezione. Personale gentilissimo, Inglese impeccabile (e spesso capiscono l'Italiano), camere modernissime, dotate di tutti i comfort, pulite ed enormi. Insonorizzazione perfetta. Offerta di locali per convegni invidiabile. Ristorante e colazione da ...""campioni""....bar fornitissimo...faccio veramente fatica a trovare un difetto. Se proprio devo, l'unica nota stonata è la fretta del personale di sala nel ritirare i piatti.
Per il resto tutto ottimo, ci tornerei anche domani.",5,2018,02,03
36,Fantástica atención de todo el personal ,"Estuve alojado en el Hilton Diagonal Mar de Barcelona por motivos de negocios y es un hotel excelente en Barcelona, personal atento y amable, genial recibimiento y habitaciones totalmente renovadas.

36,mucho mejor que el  otro en barcelona比巴塞罗那另外一家希尔顿好太多了,"Recomendaría este hotel que el otro Hilton Barcelona, tanto en el servicio como en la habitación. Llegamos muy temprano por la mañana al hotel, pero nos recibieron muy cordialmente y nos hicieron checkin, y ungrade la habitación con vista al mar. Después de pasar una noche en este hotel, nos alojamos en el otro Hilton Barcelona dos noches, que nos desesperó en comparación con este hotel.",5,2018,01,04
36,"Hotel bellissimo, ma personale freddo e problemi con i pagamenti","Questo hotel è veramente bellissimo.
Vicinissimo alla spiaggia, di fronte ad un grande centro commerciale, a pochi passi dalla metro e da una fermata del tram.
Noi avevamo trovato un'offerta su booking ed eravamo nella camera King Premium(stanza da sogno), corrispondente alla descrizione.
Vista mozza fiato, stanza pulitissima, ampia, accogliente.
Peccato però per i rumori che arrivavano dal corridoio e dalle altre camere.
Il personale è un po' freddo o forse noi siamo stati sfortunati perché all'arrivo abbiamo avuto qualche problemino.
Loro non avevano controllato bene e volevano farci pagare di nuovo la stanza. Poi ci hanno chiesto la carta di credito per bloccare 150 euro per tre notti, in caso di spese extra o danni, informandoci comunque che al check out ce li avrebbero ricaricati , se non avessimo usufruito di servizi a pagamento. 
Il loro sistema non leggeva la nostra carta, hanno provato due volte ad effettuare l'operazione e ci hanno detto che era un problema della nostra carta(ma così non era perché l'abbiamo utilizzata tranquillamente, senza alcun problema, in altri posti).
Per fortuna ne avevamo un'altra.
Se non fosse stato per questi disguidi la mia valutazione sarebbe stata molto superiore.",3,2018,01,04
36,Traumhaft,"Barcelona ist immer toll. Das Hilton liegt fast direkt am Meer und hat auch noch den Puro Beach Club als high light. Lohnt sich für Hotelgäste, da Liegen umsonst, zwar nicht direkt am Pool, aber das braucht man auch nicht unbedingt  . Es gibt auf jeden Fall viel zu sehen. Das Hotel ist kinderfreundlich, Zimmer amerikanischer Standard mit zwei Doppelbetten oder großem Kingsize. Frühstück gut, aber nur nehmen, wenn Angebot mit drin. Man kann am Strand besser und billiger essen und gegenüber ist das Shopping center Diagonal Mar mit großem Supermarkt und Bars, fast food und Restaurants.",5,2017,12,17

Consigliato anche se per raggiungere il centro ci vogliono una decina di minuti.",5,2017,11,26
36,Calidad Hilton un poco alejado del cebtro,"Es muy práctico si se tiene un evento en el Forum porque está a 2 min de distancia pero si se viene a hacer turismo está lejos del centro y lo único cerca de ocio es un centro comercial.

36,Hotel molto buono in zona Fiera a Barcellona,"Ho soggiornato per due notti in questo hotel, che giudico comodo e confortevole,
Le stanze sono ampie, ben arredate e molto pulite.
Il letto è stato molto comodo.
Insomma la qualità molto buona che viene generalmente offerta dagli Hilton hotels.
Il personale è sempre stato disponibile e molto professionale.
Ottima la qualità della prima colazione.

Ottimo, ma d’altronde è Hilton. ",5,2017,09,21
36,Lage des Hotels zum Kongresszentrum ist sehr gut,Die Lage zu dem Kongresszentrum ist optimal. Die Zimmer sauber. Der Polobereich ansprechend. Das Frühstück ist eine Massenabfertigung und für 27 Euro absolut überteuert. Das Personal sehr nett und hilfsbereit. Dennoch habe ich das hotel lediglich wegen der Lage zum Kongresszentrum ausgewählt.,4,2017,09,08
36,De copas,"Hay una terraza en el 2o piso llamada puro beach que todo el mundo puede ir a tomar algo. La terraza es muy acogedora, con sofás, piscina, música y servicio de bar. Los precios evidentemente no son muy económico pero no desorbitantes. Un cocktail vale entre 10 y 15€.
Lo que encontré un poco feo es que las camareras solo hablaban inglés y no entendían nada de español.",4,2017,09,08
36,Bequeme Betten aber fehlende Qualität beim Essen,"Das Hotel hat eine gute Lage, nur wenige Meter bis zum Strand und direkt neben einem Einkaufszentrum wo es jede Mege Geschäfte und Restaurants gibt. In die Stadt kommt man mit der Nahe gelegenen U-Bahn oder dem Bus auch recht schnell. Für den Pool muss man als Hotelgast auch keinen Eintritt zahlen, solange man eine Liege in der hinteren Reihe nimmt, was ich persönlich sogar eher angenehmer finde.
 
Der Service war sehr langsam, sodass unser Zimmer leider erst bei der dritten Aufforderung nach über vier Stunden endlich gesäubert wurde. Das Frühstücksbuffett hatte auch mehr den Charm eines billigen Strand Hotels als eines 4-Sterne Hauses. Das Obst war schon faulich und es saßen viele Obstfliegen dran. Frischen Orangensaft gab es nur an einem von drei Tagen und auch nicht in ausreichender Menge. Die Beschriftungen fehlten an vielen Stellen komplett, sodass man nicht genau wusste, was man da eigentlich vor sich hat. Für Leute mit Allergien sehr ungeeignet. An vielen Stellen sah das Essen leider auch schon aus wie von zehn Leuten angematscht. Die Auswahl an Müsli (eine Sorte vorhanden) könnte auch besser sein. Immerhin war das Personal freundlich und zuvorkomment. 

Das Zimmer war von der Ausstattung einfach aber ausreichend. Es gab leider keine Steckdosen am Bett sondern nur am Tisch. In der Dusche waren auch schon schwarze Ränder an der Tür zu sehen. Aber es gab im Bad genug Platz um nasse Strandtücher und Badesachen aufzuhängen. 

Insgesamt war der Aufenthalt ganz ok. Für Barcelona war das Hotel preislich ok und von der Lage her wirklich sehr gut.",3,2017,08,31
36,Me robaron y abrieron unos paquetes,"Horrible, sobre todo el trato del personal. Envié un paquete, me lo abrieron y lo pusieron en la recepción que lo podía coger cualquier persona. Pero no quedó ahí la cosa. El último día pedí que me bajaran unas cajas porque pesaban mucho, lo hicieron, pero para mi sorpresa habían abierto y destrozado las cajas y se habían quedado con lo que había dentro. Tenía que ser alguien del hotel, alguien que entró a la habitación a las 7 de la mañana. Me lo devolvieron pero no me dieron explicaciones, no me dijeron quién fue ni cómo. Una auténtica vergüenza. El trato y la experiencia fueron lamentables.",1,2017,08,27
36,Guter Aufenthalt mit Eckpunkten,"Meine Freundin und ich residierten 2 Nächte im Hotel und hatten alles in allem eine guten Aufenthalt. Das Hotel verfügt über eine Pool, welcher vom PuroBeach gepachtet wird. Es gibt jedoch Gratis-Liegen für Hotelgäste (Preise für Snacks und Getränke extrem happig, auch für uns Schweizer! Bier 10€etc)
Die Angestellten vom Hotel waren freundlich. Das Hotel ist neben einem Einkaufszentrum gelegen, bei dem man sich zu Tode ""shoppen"" könnte! Zudem ist der Strand in Gehdistanz!
Nachfolgend einige Abstriche, welche nicht gerade schlimm waren, aber aufzuführen sind;
Unser Zimmetelefon läutete alle 5 Minuten, nachdem wir dies der Rezeption meldeten, kam unvermittelt ein Techniker, welcher das Problem nicht beheben konnte. Daher mussten wir ein Telefon vom Zimmer ""aufgehängt"" lassen, damit die Leitung besetzt wurde und keine Anrufe mehr empfangen werden konnten.
Die Eingangshalle ist zwar gross, aber an der Rezeption sind nur einige Arbeitsplätze vorhanden, sodass wir einige Zeit für das Einchecken warten mussten.
Wir finden zudem schade, dass ein 4-Sternhotel über keine richtigen separaten Duschen verfügt, bei welchen man sich vor dem Abflug noch ""ungestört"" frisch machen mann (1 Dusche im Fitnessraum für jedes Geschlecht, musste halt ausreichen)
Zudem roch es extrem muffig im Gang, wahrscheinlich aufgrund des alten Teppichs. Auf dieses Problem wurde schon mehrmals in den Bewertung eingegangen; etwas dasgegen gemacht wurde jedoch noch nicht.
Alles in allem allerdings ein erholsamer Urlaub, halt ein typisches USA-Hotel!",3,2017,08,26
36,Un Hilton acorde con su categoría,"No es un hotel barato, pero la limpieza y comfort de las habitaciones es excepcional. Tiene gimnasio, el buffet del desayuno es espectacular y cuenta con una estupenda piscina. Además está justo frente Diagonal Mar y se puede acceder muy bien con transporte público.",5,2017,08,22
36,ascensor lleno de gente,"Estuvimos en el Piso 22. Y tomar el ascensor era un caos. Tardaba un montón y cuando lo tomábamos estaba lleno de gente. Y teníamos que viajar así como vacas. horrible. Imagínate un lugar pequeño , lleno de gente y encima sin aire acondicionado. Un desastre Después nos paso que un día tomamos el ascensor y cuando llegamos a la habitación no nos andaba la llave. Somos una familia con 3 niños pequeños. Alli estaba la mucama junto con su jefa y vio la situación y se negó a ayudarnos. entonces tuvimos que subirnos al ascensor nuevamente para bajar a la recepción, y otra vez nos dan una llave que no anda. y otra vez a subir para luego bajar. Y la mucama seguía allí sin ayudarnos, hasta que bajamos otra vez y nos dicen que la batería de la cerradura no andaba. Pasamos por todo este caos y saben que tuvimos de compensación por todo esto? nada, ni disculpas. Pero si una clara imagen que a todos los empleados les importa nada el cliente. No existe el servicio al cliente Al siguiente día fuimos a conocer la pileta del hotel. Y cuando nos acostamos en una reposera cerca de la pileta, nos dicen que hay que pagarla, que el sector es privado, jejeje ahi nos dimos del todo cuenta que es una porquería el hotel. Y te lo digo con conocimiento de hoteles de primera línea en muchos países. Igual aclaro que la chica de la pileta dejo que nos quedáramos sin cargo esa vez, igual asi y todo en 10 minutos nos fuimos, nunca estuvimos a gusto. En cuanto al desayuno había que hacer cola para servirse de la maquina el café.",2,2017,08,16
36,"Penoso, hay mejores opciones que ésta.","La atención en la Recepción pésima, sobre todo de una chica (mas o menos mayor) de estatura media, no recuerdo su nombre, soy miembro Diamante, no atención prioritaria, hice el check-in online y tuve que hacer la cola directamente, no tiene ningún sentido. Penoso. No lo recomiendo para nada, borrachos por la noche en la puerta del hotel, no me dieron ningún upgrade, desayuno frío.",1,2017,08,14
36,Angenehmer Aufenthalt mit einigen Defiziten,"Hotel allgemein:

Das Hotel hat eine sehr gute Lage. Es liegt direkt an einem Shopping-Center mit vielen Restaurants und Einkaufsmöglichkeiten und ist nur ein paar Gehminuten vom Strand entfernt. Die Mitarbeiter des Hotels sind durchweg sehr freundlich und aufmerksam, besonders beim Frühstück. Dieses bietet eine große Auswahl, sodass für so ziemlich jeden etwas dabei ist. 
Unvorteilhaft ist, das die Flure zu den Zimmern mit Teppich ausgelegt sind. Hierdurch liegt ein etwas muffiger Geruch in der Luft der bei warmen Wetter noch verstärkt wird, da hier anscheinend keine Klimatisierung stattfindet.

Zimmer:

Unser Zimmer war sehr sauber, das Mobiliar nicht mehr unbedingt das neueste, aber vollkommen in Ordnung. Negativ aufgefallen ist die Minibar, in der noch Brot und Käse von unserem Vorgänger lagerten. Außerdem empfanden wir die Preise für Snacks (welche alle schon einen Monat abgelaufen waren) und Getränke schon etwas unverschämt. Oreo Kekse für 8€, Piccolo Champagner 32€, 5cl Whisky, Wodka oder Gin 12€, Flasche Bier 8€. Ob man nun viel Geld für wenig ausgeben möchte oder einfach die 100m zum Kaufhaus auf sich nimmt, ist natürlich jedem selbst überlassen. Das Bad war schön und sauber, jedoch war Duschen teilweise eine Katastrophe. Das Wasser wechselte ständig von kochend heiß auf eiskalt und umgekehrt, gerade morgens. Nachmittags ist es einigermaßen auszuhalten, jedoch auch nicht optimal.

Pool:

Der Poolbereich gehört anscheinend nicht direkt dem Hotel, sondern ist an “Purobeach“ vermietet. Für Liegen/Sunbeds muss man bezahlen (10€-30€) für “normal sterbliche“, sowie 500€-2500€ für “besser verdienende“. Gerade von diesen wimmelt es hier bei gutem Wetter nur so. An sich ja kein Problem, aber es passt einfach nicht zum Ambiente des Hotels. Die Sitzgelegenheiten im Purobeach waren teilweise schmutzig und die Getränkepreise so ähnlich wie in der Minibar auf dem Zimmer. Der Pool an sich war sauber, aber kein Highlight und auch relativ klein.

Fazit: 

Relativ sauberes Hotel, freundliches und aufmerksames Personal, leckeres Frühstück und ein alles in allem angenehmer Aufenthalt. Ich empfehle das Hotel weiter, man sollte sich aber über die oben genannten Defizite (teilweise auch nur meine persönliche Meinung) im klaren sein.",3,2017,08,09
36,Un hotel interesante,"La ubicación no está mal, cerca de museo y centro comercial. La atención del personal del hotel es buena, pero me decepcionó la limpieza de la habitación y el hecho de que reservará habitación con vistas al mar y me dieran vistas justo al lado contrario. Eso sí; la habitación es muy amplia y cómoda y está dotada con tabla de planchar y plancha.",3,2017,07,26
36,Barcelona y sus placeres,"Ya habia visitado antes la ciudad, estuve anos visitando sus calles, su estadio y disfrutando de su equipo de futbol soccer el FCB.
Pero es indescriptible el placer de alojarse en el Hilton Mar Barcelona. Ls calidad, la presicion del horario y el servicio de excelencia marcan la diferencia. Un lugar sin duda que recomiendo",5,2017,07,16
36,Schöner Aufenthalt,"Wir haben in unseren Sommerurlaub (Strand-Stadt-Mix) 11 Nächte im Hilton (inkl. Frühstück) in einem Standart-Zimmer verbracht und waren sehr zufrieden.

Lage:
Das Hotel liegt in Sichtweite zum Strand. Direkt ggü. ist ein Einkaufszentrum mit allen gängigen Läden, Cafés, Bistros und einem Supermarkt. Außerdem befindet sich hinter dem Center die U-Bahn Station  El Maresme Forum (L2 Gelb), die einen direkt Richtung Barceloneta, Shopping Meile etc. fährt.
Insgesamt genial, da direkt am Strand, Supermarkt nebenan, an der U-Bahn, eher ruhig gelegen, aber nicht fern ab vom Schuss.

Ausstattung / Service:
Frühstück gab es jeden Tag von 7-11 Uhr. Man konnte draußen auf dem Balkon sowie im Saal sitzen. Das Buffet bot alles was das Herz begehrt und für jede Ernährungsform (Veggie, Vegan, Gluten-free, Fitness, High-Protein, Low-Carb...) etwas an!
Man wurde am Tisch bedient, Kaffee und frische Säfte wurde gebracht, auf jegliche Sonderwünsche wird eingegangen, eine Egg/Omelett Station bereitet frische Eier-Gerichte zu und in der Küche kann man Pancakes, Muffins etc. bestellen.
Frühstück: Hervorragend

Es gibt im 2. OG eine Poollandschaft (Puro) mit Spa und Bar sowie einem Restaurant. Die Benutzung ist exklusive und für Hotelgäste ab 10€ pro Tag möglich.

Außerdem gibt es ein kleines Fitnesscenter, welches aber aufgrund seiner Größe und Ausstattung nicht überzeugen konnte.

Das Zimmer was schön eingerichtet mit Wannenbad, Minibar, Wasserkocher und gemütlichen Bett. Zimmerservice etc. hat den regulären sehr hohen Hilton Standart.

Zusammenfassung
Wir waren sehr zufrieden mit unserem Aufenthalt; insbesondere die Lage des Hotels war toll. Der Service sowie das Frühstücksangebot waren Spitze und wir können aus unserer Sicht dieses Hotel nur weiterempfehlen.",5,2017,07,16
36,Pessimo ,"Mai visto un hotel a 4 stelle senza lo scopettino del water... lo scambiatore d'aria non è regolabile e rumoroso, nessuna stanza ha la possibilità di aprire la finestra.

36,"Gutes Hotel, gewohnter Hilton Standard ","Ein gutes Hilton Hotel mit gewohntem Standard. Das Zimmer war groß, freundlich, modern und hervorragend sauber. Es war schön leise bei geschlossenem Fenster, auch die Klima hat ihre Arbeit leise und zuverlässig verrichtet. Die Mitarbeiter sind sehr freundlich, besonders hervorzuheben beim Frühstück.
Das Frühstück lässt auch sonst keine Wünsche offen, es ist alles in guter bis sehr guter Qualität vorhanden, vor allem kann man sich Eierspeisen frisch nach Wunsch zubereiten lasse.
Der Strand ist in ca. 5 Gehminuten zu erreichen, aber auch der Hauseigene Beachclub macht viel her.

Negativ: Parkgebühren von 36€ pro Tag schlagen für die Tiefgarage pro Nacht zu Buche - so teuer habe ich noch nie geparkt.

W-Lan war in unserem Tarif integriert, ob es immer kostenfrei ist, kann ich nicht sagen.

Fazit: Wer Hilton Standard haben möchte und ein sehr gutes Zimmer mit extrem bequemen Betten genießen will, ist hier bei entsprechendem Budget genau richtig.",4,2017,06,28
36,Non vale il prezzo,"Giudizio rapportato alla categoria e al prezzo dell'albergo. Arredamento vecchio, moquette logora, lontano dal centro, colazione povera per il dolce, dotazione scarsa della camera, prezzi minibar assurdi (6 euro acqua), piscina piccola e affollata.

36,"ein deutlicher Beweis, dass Sterne und ein großer Name nicht alles sind","Das Hilton Diagonal Mar in Barcelona ist ein deutlicher Beweis, dass ein großer Name und die Sterneklassifizierung absolut nichts wert sind - ganz klar: alle Standards für ein Hotel dieser Klasse werden erfüllt, mehr aber auch nicht. Einen Bademantel zur Badewanne im Zimmer gibt es nicht, stattdessen ist der Schlauch zum Duschkopf gebrochen (siehe Foto), es gibt ein uraltes Telefon neben der Toilette, aber kein kostenfreies WLAN, es gibt Tisch und Stuhl - deren zerkratzter Zustand ist aber absolut unwürdig für ein Hilton (siehe Foto), es gibt eine überteuerte Minibar (Wasser 6 Euro, Kondom 8 Euro, Schnaps 12 Euro,...), aber kein Fenster, das man öffnen könnte - stattdessen kann man durch ein versifftes Fenster (auf dem explizit auf die regelmäßige Reinigung hingewiesen wird) gen Pool blicken (siehe Foto). In Anbetracht des Meeres direkt vor der Tür empfehle ich ohnehin den Gang an den Strand... Suchen Sie nach Eis für Ihren teuren Drink? Der Automat ist nach der Staubschicht zu urteilen schon lange defekt (siehe Foto)
Wirklich schade ist, dass dieses Hotel überall stehen könnte, es gibts gar nichts, was auch nur im Ansatz für Barcelona typisch wäre. 
Hätte ich das Hotel selber zahlen müssen, wäre ich in Anbetracht des Preises sicherlich sehr enttäuscht. Die klare Empfehlung: Barcelona hatte viele spannende Hotels, suchen Sie sich ein anderes als dieses!",2,2017,05,14
36,Un grande albergo a due passi dal mare.,"La catena Hilton non ha bisogno di presentazioni e questa proposta lo conferma. Servizio ottimo sotto ogni punto di vista con una gamma di opportunità di ottimo livello, a cominciare da una piscina scoperta ideale per una pausa rinfrescante e dotata di tutti i comfort. Ideale anche per ospitare congressi ed eventi.",4,2017,05,13
36,entraron en mi habitación mientra yo dormía,"por error dieron la llave de mi habitación a otro huesped que entro en mi habitación mientras yo estaba dentro durmiendo. Tuve que insistir yo llamando 2 días después al hotel para obtener una explicación. Recibí un mail de disculpas y un ""precio especial"" sin concretar si un día me vulevo a hospedar en Hilton Diagonal. Insuficiente. Indigno",2,2017,05,10
36,Confort y buenas vistas,"Estuvimos hace unas semanas por cuestiones de negocios, es un hotel normal, quizás un poco anticuadas las habitaciones que nos tocaron, con un centro comercial al lado para poder comer o ir de compras y junto al mar.",4,2017,04,23
36,Hotel zona urbana con playas de Barcelona ciudad,"Habitación amplia, cómoda, con buenas vistas a la ciudad, muy luminosa y tranquila.
Me ha gustado la ubicación en una zona diferente a las que he estado anteriormente,
Próxima a playas, tiene un gran centro comercial con restaurantes casi todos con terrazas que da a una gran plaza, transporte en tranvía y metro muy próximos.",4,2017,04,19
36,Hilton ... Ein Mythos,"Die Kombination Hilton und Booking.com ist einfach nur miserabel. Schwierigkeiten mit dem arroganten und unfähigen Personal beim Check in setzten sich auch im Frühstücksbereich fort. Es liegt sicher nur an einigen Mitarbeitern, die unseren Aufenthalt zu einem negativen Erlebnis machten. So kenne ich das von Hilton nicht. Hinzu kam die unkorrekte Übertragung der Daten von Booking.com. Zimmer sind in die Jahre gekommen. Frühstücksraum  eher ein Bahnhof. Positiv - Poolbereich und Lage zum Strand und U-Bahn. 
Ich werde Hilton und Booking.com meiden.",2,2017,04,18
36,seltsame Geschehnisse aber soweit alles in Ordnung,"Das Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona liegt verkehrstechnisch recht gut, die nächste Strassenbahn und eine U-Bahn Station sind in 2 Min zu erreichen und damit kommt man dann wirklich schnell in die City, ca. 5km entfernt.
Das Hotel selbst ist nicht mehr 100% frisch wie am ersten Tag aber soweit ist alles sauber und ordentlich. Wir hatten etwas Diskussionen bez. dem Zugang zu der Executive Lounge aber letztendlich hat alles geklappt. Vom 16 Stock aus hat man einen schönen Überblick auf die Stadt und unser Zimmer war recht geräumig. Als wir vom Stadtbummel zurückkamen war ein Techniker in unserem Bad da im Zimmer unter uns wohl Wasser aus der Decke kam - ist etwas seltsam jemand ungefragt im Hotelzimmer anzutreffen aber war wohl in Ordnung.
Die E-Lounge ist klein, mit Terasse und bietet ab 18:00 kleine, leckere Häppchen und alkoholische Getränke wie Sekt und Bier, tagsüber gibt es Cola, Wasser usw. frei.

Der Poolbereich ist geräumig, mit vielen Liegen und Schatteninseln, im April gerade so gut zum relaxen, das Wasser war noch sehr ..frisch ;-)

Das Frühstück sollte man unten im Hauptraum einnehmen, die Lounge bietet nur eine eingeschränkte Auswahl.

Das Umfeld des Hotels besteht aus anderen Hotels, gegenüber ist ein riesiges Kaufhaus, ein Naturmuseum und ansonsten ..nicht viel. Wer etwas erleben will muss in die Stadt.",4,2017,04,16
36,Sehr zu empfehlen,"Nahe an Metro und Straßenbahn gelegen ist das Hotel ein gut gewählter Ort, um die Stadt zu erkunden. Gleichzeitig liegt ein toller Strand und das Einkaufszentrum in unmittelbarer Nähe. Für uns war das Joggen am Strand und der Pool eine tolle Ergänzung des Besichtungsprogramms!",5,2017,04,12
36,Sin sorpresas,"Hotel que cumple lo esperado sin sorpresas , nada que echar en falta y tampoco nada que te sorprenda .
Desayuno  completo, habitación amplías y cómodas (moqueta en la habitación ) . Trato del personal muy amable y profesional. Por la zona no hay mucho que ver , y se esta alejado de las zonas turísticas . Coste noche elevado, pero es Barcelona ..",4,2017,04,06
36,muy bien,"Hemos organizado una boda allí que nos facilitó todo ofreciendo todo su ayuda. Muy bien servicio. Habitación grande con vista al mar, muy bonito la vista. Muy bien la relación de calidad y precio. Y personal muy amable. ",5,2017,03,28
36,Excelente establecimiento y calidad del servicio,"Instalaciones muy modernas y todo en perfecto estado.
Desayunos buffet completísimos. 
Atención de los camareros en desayuno excelente. Pasaban cada poco tiempo a ofrecerte rellenar zumos, café, ofrecían especialidades de la zona o degustaciones.
En cena servicio muy atento a la mesa y que no faltara de nada.
El servicio en general de 10.
Volveré.",5,2017,03,26
36,Excelente calidad de servicio y de habitacion,"Viaje de negocios con excelente estancia en el hotel. Servicio impecable y muy buena atención en todo. Desayunos con productos de mucha calidad. Camareros muy atentos pasando por la mesa para rellenar zumos, ofreciéndote productos recién hechos o típicos de la zona. Cantidad mas que suficiente de todos los productos y de muy buena calidad. En la cena atención personalizada y siempre atentos a si necesitas algo. Habitación muy nueva, sin ruidos y todo en perfecto estado. volveré.",5,2017,03,26
36,Schönes Hotel mit toller Aussicht,"Wir waren über Weihnachten für eine Nacht in dem Hotel. Durch den Executive Floor hatten wir Zugang zu der Lounge im 15. Stock. Von da hat man einen atemberaubenden Ausblick auf das Meer und die Stadt. Essens- und Getränkeauswahl war normal für ein Hilton. 

Pro:
-Tolle Aussicht
-Shoppingcenter direkt neben dem Hotel
-großes Zimmer
-nettes Personal

Contra:
-Teurer Parkplatz (haben deshalb um die Ecke geparkt)
-etwas außerhalb

Ich werde dieses Hotel sicher ein weiteres Mal besuchen! Es war wirklich toll!",5,2017,03,21
36,Vacaciones ,"Este hotel es fantástico, su decoración moderna, la mejor atención al cliente y sus habitaciones son increíbles, aunque de diseño y precios diferentes. Queda cerca de la parada del metro y el tranvía. 
Se puede ir caminando a la playa y recorrer la rambla del litoral y luego ir a la plaza Cataluña, el barrio gótico y otros lugares de interés.
 
Recomiendo este hotel y espero volver algún día.",5,2017,02,18
36,EXCELENTE STAFF Y HABITACIONES MUY BONITAS,"excelente fin de semana! el staff muy amable y atento, sobretodo raquel del dto. de reserva que se preocupo de todos los detalles para garantizarnos una buena estancia. habitaciones amplias con vistas al mar. muy limpio. excelente executive lounge. Muchas gracias por todo!",5,2017,02,13
36,Hilton diagonal do mar,Viaggio di lavoro . Buona accoglienza e ottimi servizi . Sullo sfondo la bellezza e la vitalita' di Barcelona. Ottima colazione e camere accoglienti e pulite. Personale gentile e premuroso. Sala Fitness un poco piccola ,3,2017,02,12
36,tolle Tagung,"ich habe mich wohl gefühlt. DAs Meer ist direkt um die Ecke, ein Einkaufszentrum sowie die Metrovor der Tür. So ist man schnell in der Stadt. Wir haben auch 4 Tage in diesem Hotel getagt und sind in der Zeit kaum vor die Tür gekommen. Das Hotel ist großzügig angelegt,  sodass man sich dort gut aufhalten kann. Leider hatte ich keine Zeit die Fitnessangebote zu nutzen. Das Frühstück find ich mit 27€ zu teuer. Das Buffet zum Mittag- und Abendessen war gut und reichlich.",5,2017,02,06
36,Gut und zweckmässig,Für einen Businesstrip ist das Hilton unweit des Strandes von Barcelona und gleich gegenüber einer grossen Shopping-Mall sehr gut geeignet. Die Zimmer sind zweckmässig eingerichtet und sauber. Die Betten könnten etwas breiter sein und die Geräuschdämmung zum Gang bzw. an der Verbindungstür zum Nachbarzimmer noch einen Tick besser. Dafür überzeugt das umfangreiche Frühstücksbuffet und der freundliche Service.,3,2017,01,28
36,Increible Purobeach en el hotel,"Un purobeach en barcelona montado en la terraza de este fantastico hotel, en su gran terraza.
El hotel es correcto con un servicio muy bueno, las infraestructuras estan algo gastadas y le vendria bien una reformilla, pero las habitaciones son correctas.",4,2017,01,20
36,Excelente comida de Navidad,"Comimos en el restaurante del hotel y tanto la calidad como el servicio fueron excelentes. Siempre estuvieron pendientes de nosotros, la cantidad de los platos adecuada y realmente ricos para celebrar la Navidad: canelón de pato, suprema de lubina con salteado de verduras y un gran postre de chocolate. Muy recomendable!!",5,2017,01,18
36,CONVENCIÓN DE TRABAJO,"De aspecto y de nombre pensé en encontrarme un fantástico hotel, además, teniendo en cuenta su ubicación cerca de la playa en un barrio de lo mejor de Barcelona. 
El hotel en si no está mal pero creo que un poco abandonado, la habitación grande y bien distribuida pero con una horrorosa climatización, al igual que el resto del hotel. 
Comidas y desayunos bastante normales pero con bastantes posibilidades pero caótico por momentos, la primera mañana se les rompieron las cafeteras y el DESASTRE fue mayúsculo, yo pero explicaciones a un camarero y me contestó ""si quiere poner una queja baje a recepción""....
También me mandaron un paquete y tuve que ir yo a recepción a preguntar porque sino no me hubiera enterado de su llegada, lo normal es que te avisen, verdad??
Yo no volveré e intentaré que no vuelvan desde mi compañía. 
",2,2017,01,15
36,Buen descanso y comfort,"He elegido el Hotel Hilton (Diagonal 581-591). Es un hotel tipico de un Hilton, lleno de atenci´on y cuidando hasta el m´as m´inimo detalle, lo que hace que su visita sea expectacular.
Para llegar, est´a a unos 200mtrs de la estaci´on de metro Mar´ia Cristina (Linea 3). Para los que vienen en tren, est´a 3 paradas de metro de Sants Estaci´on.
En recepci´on son muy atentos. Las habitaciones muy comodas. Como podeis ver, la cama es grande y muy comoda, las almohadas muy suaves. Todo muy cuidado.
El Hotel cuenta con una piscina, gimnasio, sala de restaurante y un expectacular desayuno para todos los gustos. En el bar, os atenderan personas muy simp´aticas y atentas.
Os recomiendo que probeis ´este bonito Hotel.
  ",5,2017,01,07
36,Excelente hotel,"Pasamos la noche de fin de año yo y mi pareja con una reserva también para cenar en su restaurante,quiero expresar mi agradecimiento a todo el personal por su amabilidad y atención,tanto el personal del restaurante como staff de recepción,me habeis conseguido satisfacer.
Hice un pedido de cava y petalos de rosa y debo decir que dejaron un adorno muy bonito en la habitación.
En cuanto al precio,es muy barato para la calidad que tienen sus habitaciones,comodas,espaciosas y luminosas,en concreto la mía era la relaxation.El salon del restaurante tambieb muy cuidado y está en una zona con un centro comercial que cuenta con todo tipo de marcas.
Si quereis buscar un hotel con el que salgais bien tratados y contentos de vuestra compra,os aconsejo que vengais a hilton diagonal mar.

Gracias de nuevo!",5,2017,01,01
36,"Frente al mar, muy cerca de la playa","Situado en la zona del Forum en el norte de la ciudad, el hotel esta justo frente al mar y muy cerca de la playa, por el otro lado el centro comercial Diagonal Mar está solo al otro lado de la calle. 
Las habitaciones son muy espaciosas y cómodas, las que tienen vistas al mar cuentan con unos impresionantes ventanales que hacen que parezca que estar en un barco.
En la segunda planta del hotel está la zona de Puro Beach, con piscina, hamacas y camas balinesas (tienen coste extra), fantásticas vistas y zona de terraza y bar. En ocasiones hay fiestas y sesiones de DJ´s en directo, muy ameno y con mucho ambiente, aunque hay que tener en cuenta que no solo es para clientes del hotel, lo cual si se va buscando tranquilidad quizás no sea muy recomendable en los meses de verano.
La terraza de la planta ejecutiva tiene unas vistas impresionantes, es tranquila y el servicio es muy bueno.

36,Comentarios,"Super-Excelente ,la estancia ,estoy muy súper conforme con la atención del personal en general,además siempre tienen una sonrisa que los hace ver muy bien y que aman su trabajo,pendiente siempre con atender a las personas",5,2016,12,15
36,Si puó migliorare.,"Vengo in questo albergo 2 volte all'anno per lavoro e vi soggiorno 3/4 notti. Una a Luglio e l'altra fine novembre. Personale molto cordiale e disponibile. Le camere sono pulite ma la moquette andrebbe oramai cambiata.
La zona colazione al primo piano é spaziosa e completa di tutto quello che si puó chiedere a una colazione continentale, con la possibilità di chidere preparazioni al momento. Nel complesso, per la posizione in cui si trova, non é male, neanche per il prezzo.
La spiaggia é vicinissima. Consiglio di venirci sia per vacanza che per lavoro.",4,2016,11,28
36,Bello ma lontano,Posizione fuori dal centro. Ma con struttura eccellente per i congressi. Camere spiaziose e pulite. Personale gentile. Colazione molto ricca e buona. Distante 25' dall' aereoporto. Davanti c è il centro commerciale diagonal del mar  con cinema e negozi. Tuttavia lontanto dal centro. ,4,2016,11,21
36,Excelente hotel ,"Perfectamente situado, ofrece el entorno y servicios dignos de un Hilton en versión moderna.
Muy recomendable para eventos de negocio.
La atención del personal y la comida estupendos.
Además enfrente del centro comercial Diagonal Mar.",5,2016,11,17
36,Bella struttura (per viaggi di lavoro),Per il Symposium di Gartner è perfetto. Camere spaziose e pulite. Colazione adeguata. Un po' piccola (per la dimensione dell'hotel) la zona gym e sauna. Molto ben servito ed ha un centro commerciale piuttosto grande proprio di fronte,5,2016,11,12
36,Excelente Estadia frente al Mar Mediterraneo,Excelente estadia en un gran hotel. Lo unico es que es algo retirado por lo que tienes que depender de metro o taxi para movilivarte a los sitios populares de visita en Barcelona. En si el hotel es muy bueno y no me arrepiento de haberme hospedado en el.,5,2016,11,10
36,Tolle Hardware aber der Service ist arrogant,"Haben dieses Hotel wegen der Lage zum öffentlichen Strand gewählt und müssen sagen, dafür ist die Lage super, leider wird einem Diamond Kunden nichts geboten, kein Obst auf dem Zimmer oder ein Upgrade.",2,2016,11,10
36,Gutes Hilton mit Anbindung an U-Bahn,"Die Lage zum nahen Strand, dem Einkaufscenter Diagonal Mar als auch zur U-Bahn Station fanden wir gut. Hotel liegt aber nicht zentral - sollte man also beachten wenn es einem wichtig ist. Frühstück ist hinsichtlich Umfang und Qualität gut - es bietet aber noch Verbesserungspotenzial nach oben (Stichwort: zu eintönig bei längerem Aufenthalt). Da es eher ein Business- als Urlaubshotel ist sind die Frühstückszeiten werktags bis 10:30 Uhr für Urlauber nicht optimal. Wir waren Anfang November da und es war noch schön warm. Trotzdem war der Außenpool (mit dem man viel wirbt, Puro etc.) bereits geschlossen. Das war schade. Mittag-/Abendessen, Bar, Fitness im Hotel haben wir nicht genutzt - von daher kann hierzu keine Bewertung gegeben werden. Fahrräder leihen über das Hotel ging nicht. Dazu mussten wir in die Innnestadt fahren. Das wäre verbessungswürdig.",4,2016,11,09
36,Puro Beach,"Espectacular experiencia en el hotel y en las fiestas tanto del sábado como en la del domingo
Dirigidas por cocofullexperiece y Puro beach respectivamente 
Todo fue perfecto desde que entremos hasta nuestra salida
Mi visita fue en grupo, de despedida de soltera y estaba todo pensado al detalle 
Musica, servicio, entorno, ambiente 10!
Ganas de verano y  repetir",5,2016,11,06
36,Perfetto per viaggi d'affari - comodo al CCIB,"Hotel business, curato e pulito, Colazione eccellente. Staff cordiale e disponibile. Un po' di fila al check in. Wifi non sempre funzionante e a pagamento nelle stanze. 
Zona lobby ampia. Le sale riunioni sono perfette per meeting. Accanto al CCIB quindi perfetto se si deve lavorare al centro congressi",4,2016,11,02
36,Acierto seguro ,"Un hotel perfecto. Habitaciones espaciosas, cuidadas al más mínimo detalle y muy cómodas. La salas de reunión, en las que pasamos bastante tiempo, ya que iba por trabajo, amplias y las zonas comunes muy agradables. La comida del buffet muy buena también. Lo único que no pude probar por el mal tiempo fue la zona de la terraza. La localización es buena en caso de querer estar cerca del forum pero un poco alejado en caso de querer visitar el centro ",5,2016,10,26
36,Hotel muy bueno,"El hotel es increible, muy comodo y cerca de la zona de playas de Barcelona. El personal es muy atento y disponible. El restaurante y el bar son muy confortables y abiertos hasta tarde. Esta bastante lejos del centro de la ciudad",5,2016,10,26
36,Top Hotel mit Top Service,"Wir waren nun schon öfters in diesem Hotel und können es durchweg empfehlen. Die Lage ist direkt am Meer, das Zentrum gut zu Fuß am Strand entlang oder per Straßenbahn erreichbar, das Frühstück ist umfangreich und super und der Beach Club ist perfekt zum Entspannen. 

Das Beste war aber beim letzten Mal der Service: Unser Kind hat leider seine Lieblingspuppe (Matze :-) im Hotel verloren. Wir haben das Hotel diesbezüglich kontaktiert und die Puppe konnte leider nicht mehr wiedergefunden werden. Uns wurde daraufhin bei Amazon einfach eine neue Puppe bestellt, die zwei Tage später bei uns ankam. Danke an Mariano Lopez und Team, das ist wirklich ein hervorragender Kundenservice!",5,2016,10,26
36,Bisher bestes Hotel am Kongresszentrum,"Ich habe schon in etlichen Hotels in der Nähe des Konresszentrums gewohnt, war nie zufrieden und das Hilton hat jetzt überzeugt, hat aber auch seinen Preis. Die Lage neben dem Kongress und direkt gegenüber dem Einkaufszentrum ist ideal, U-Bahnstation sehr nahe, wenn man in die Stadt möchte.
Die Zimmer und Bad sind relativ groß, hell und freundlich, gute und ausreichende Beleuchtung, das Fenster ist etwas zu öffnen, bequemes Bett, Kaffeestation, freies schnelles WLan, sehr sauber, schöner Blick entweder auf die Stadt oder aufs Meer.
Der Service an der Rezeption sehr freundlich, effizient, flexibel und schnell. Es stand auch schon ein Zimmer vor 15h bereit.
Gestört haben mich die abgegessenen Tabletts auf dem Gang, die zu allen Zeiten während meines eintägigen Aufenthaltes irgendwo rumstanden, und wenn eingesammelt zB der Weinkübel zurückgelassen wurde und eine lockere Duschkopfhalterung sowie eine Seifenablage, durch die die Seifenfläschchen hindurchrutschen.
Erfreut als nette Geste hätte mich auch bei dem Preis eine kostenlose Wasserflasche, vielleicht nicht üblich in Barcelona, aber wenn man durstig in einem warmen Land ankommt und €6 dafür zahlen soll, wäre dies wichtiger als ein kostenloser Kaffee.
Ansonsten alles ok und gut und meine Präferenz für einen nächsten Aufenthalt.",4,2016,10,18
36,Hilton Diagonal Mar,"A pesar de que Hilton sea una cadena americana, el hotel se acopla a las expectativas de una estadía en Europa. Su ambiente, atención, ubicación y diseño son puntos claves para hacer una estadía perfecta.",5,2016,10,16
36,Standard Hilton,"Non amo molto gli Hotel Hilton. Molto americani, molto freddi, molto standardizzati e tutti uguali. Questo riassume tutte queste caratteristiche. Ma è una questione di gusti.

L'Hilton Diagonal Mar rimane un ottimo albergo 4 stelle, molto comodo se usato per attività congressuale (il centro congressi è praticamente attaccato)

Le camere sono spaziose, luminose e molto pulite. I letti sono comodi e il controllo della temperatura funziona bene.

Ho provato il ristorante solo a colazione: ottima e abbondante anche se la scelta nella zona  pasticceria sembrava un po' misera.

L'hotel dispone di palestra, centro benessere e piscina all'aperto.
Ci sono  due bar. Uno nella lobby e uno di fianco alla piscina al secondo piano, ideale per un drink all'aperto nella bella stagione

Riassumendo, la permanenza in questo albergo è stata decisamente ottima.",4,2016,10,06
36,Schönes hotel ,"Schönes Hotel sehr nahe dem Meer, allerdings etwas von der Innenstadt entfernt. Die Zimmer waren OK, wirken aber nicht mehr ganz neu. Sehr schön ist der poolbereich und die Hilton lounge im 15.stock. Am Wochenende gab es zu unserem Besuch Anfang September relativ dekadente poolparties zu denen man als Hotelgast umsonst darf. Uns hat das gefallen, wer hier die Ruhe sucht wird sie aber am pool nicht finden. Frühstück ist typisch Hilton auf ordentlichem Niveau.",4,2016,10,04
36,Ole Barcelona,"Schön nach dem Rummel in der Stadt ,hier die Ruhe genießen .Das Einzige nervige war ,dass der Zimmerschlüssel oft nicht ging. Die Lounge war ein angenehmer Aufenthalt - und Entspannungsort .Die Snacks mittelmäßig ",4,2016,09,30
36,Keine 5Sterne Hotel,"Wenn man 275 Euro pro Nacht für eine 5 Sterne Hotel zahlt, erwartet man Qualität, Edelheit,....., was in dieser Hotel fehlte. Es gab keine gute Spa, außer eine sehr kleine unbenutzte von Gästen Saunazimmer gleich gegenüber von einer Toilette.",2,2016,09,25
36,Gutes Geschäftshotel mit Wucherpreisen,"Eine Incentivereise führte mich in dieses Hotel. Empfang, Zimmer, Sauberkeit war gut und so, wie man es von so einem Hotel  erwartet.
Nicht akzeptabel sind aber die Peise der Minibar. Zwei Beispiele: Bier 8,00 €, Wasser 5,75 €. Das ist schlicht und einfach unverschämt, zumal das stark gechlorte Wasser aus der Leitung nicht genießbar ist. Mein Tip: gegenüber ist ein Einkaufszentrum, da kann man Getränke zu normalen Preisen kaufen.",4,2016,09,21
36,Sehr Schlechter Zimmer-Zustand für 4-Sterne-Hotel!,"Plus Punkte: 
gute Lage, schönes Hotel von draußen und Ihnen, WLAN ist relativ schnell, Rezeption ist freundlich und Hilfsbereit.

Minus Punkte:
- Duschkopf war kaputt, spritzt Wasser überall! nächst Tag wurde ausgetauscht, aber ohne getested zu haben... Wasser angeschaltet, dann ist es wieder kaputt! :(  zwei Tage ohne vernunftige Dusche! Das soll ein 4-Sterne-Hotel sein?

- Freundin von mir hat im Bad Haufen von fremden Haar gefunden... wie ekelhaft! 

-  schlechte Luft im Zimmer, Fenster darf nicht geöffnet werden, es stinkt nach Möbel und Teppich! 

- AUFPASSEN! Es gibt kein Zahnputzbecher und Zahnpasta! eigene Zahnpasta nicht vergessen! Das ist echt das erste mal dass es kein Zahnpaste im 4-Sterne-Hotel gibt! 

- kein Mülleimer im Zimmer, nur ein kleiner im Bad

- kein Badmantel

- keine hygienetüte für Dame im WC.

Zusammenfassung: sehr ungenügend und unprofessionelles Hotel!",1,2016,09,19
36,Rundum zufrieden ,"Top Service und top Lage mit allen was man sich wünscht. Die Zimmer sind großzügig und bieten alles was man sich wünscht, vom Bügeleisen bis zum Föhn. Leider hatte ich zwei einzelne Betten nebeneinander und nicht ein großes. Im Bad gibt es eine Badewanne aber keine separate Dusche. Restaurant, SPA und Frühstück sind top und die Exclusive Lounge im 15. Stock ist mit einer Traumhaften Dachterasse versehen.",5,2016,09,18
36,Sehr gutes Hotel mit zentraler Lage,"Es ist ein sehr gutes Hotel, mit gehobener Ausstattung und großen Zimmern. Es liegt gegenüber eines Einkaufszentrum und 5 Minuten vom Strand entfernt.
Das Frühstück bietet eine große Auswahl, wo jeder etwas findet.
Das Hotel ist ruhig, obwohl es eine gewisse Größe hat.
Personal ist höflich und hilfsbereit, manchmal etwas zu viel.
Zimmer sind auf den neuesten Stand und sehr sauber.
Gerne wieder.",4,2016,09,17

Der Sightseeing Bus hält direkt am  Hotel, besser geht nicht. 
Hotel  sehr modern und stylish, Zimmer sehr schön, wir hatten ein Zimmer auf der 15. Etage mit Zugang zur Lounge mit schöner Aussenterasse, sehr empfehlenswert, schöner Sonnenuntergang.
Ganz besonders aufgefallen ist uns im gesamten Hotel und alle Mitarbeiter super freundlich und sehr zuvorkommend.",5,2016,09,16
36,"Sehr gutes Hotel, günstige Lage","Die Lage ist sehr gut. Großes Einkaufszentrum gleich daneben. Metro in unmittelbarer Nähe, zum Strand 10 min. Sehr freundliches Personal. Das Holz bei den Türen schaut schon abgenutzt aus, aber unser Zimmer (1612) war innen ganz in Ordnung. Groß, tolle Aussicht aufs Meer, sehr sauber, großer Schrank mit genügend Kleiderbügel. Ein toller Pool mit super Atmosphäre, vor allem am Abend. ",5,2016,09,08
36,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona,"Lage: Etwas abseits vom Geschehen aber man ist schnell mit der nahegelegenen U-Bahn in der Innenstadt. Vorteil: Der Strand ist nur ein paar Meter vom Hotel entfernt. 
Gegenüber des Hotels befindet sich eine schöne Shopping Mall mit ebenfalls einigen Restaurants. 

Der Sightseeing Bus hält ebenfalls vor dem Hotel.

Hotel: Sehr modern und stylish!

Zimmer: Ich hatte aufgrund meines Gold Status ein Upgrade auf ein Executive Eck-Zimmer. Wunderschöner Ausblick von eines der obersten Stockwerken auf die Stadt.

Lounge: Das Angebot an Snacks hat mich enttäuscht... Sehr fleischlästig. Also nichts für Vegetarier. Diese müssen sich mit Chips und Nüssen zufriedengeben. Dennoch schöne Dachterrasse die zum Sundowner einlädt.

Fitnessbereich: Gut ausgestattet und sauber

Service: Nach anfänglichen Schwierigkeiten alles ok

Wer etwas Ruhe in der pulsierenden Metropole sucht und auf Design und Strandnähe nicht verzichten will ist hier richtig.",4,2016,09,08
36,Buona permanenza,"In posizione centrale, a pochi passi da esercizi commerciali e luoghi di attrazione offre camere ben organizzate e pulite
Il personale è cortese e disponibile 
Peccato la hall sia piccola poiché ora è consuetudine all'americana di utilizzare lo spazio non per divani ma per tavolini in modo da ""vendere"" altri servizi da bar...
Ottima la colazione con croissant che si trovano così buoni solo in Francia ",4,2016,09,07
36,Qulità Hilton,"Sono stato all'Hilton un giorno per un evento di lavoro. Ho apprezzato la qualità dell'hotel e la professionalità del personale nell'indirizzarmi. Buono anche il bar. L'unico neo è che forse la struttura andrebbe rinfrescata un po', da l'impressione di essere un po' vecchia.",4,2016,09,07
36,Atención inmejorable y comodidad plena,"habitaciones espaciosas. El área de la piscina está en excelentes condiciones y muy cómodo. La recepción es amplia.  El hotel cuenta con estacionamiento propio, que aunque sea caro, te da la tranquilidad que necesitas durante tu estancia.",5,2016,09,06
36,Geschäftsreise nach Barcelona,"Das einzige im Hotel gefallen hat mir die Purobeach. Am Wochenende hat es hier DJ und gute Musik. Viele Junge Leute und der Stil ist sehr gut. Das essen ist auch gut, vom Preis aber sehr teuer. Hotelgäste dürfen wenn Purobeach ist gratis rein. Externe bezahlen teuren Eintritt.
Das Hotelzimmer liess zu wünschen übrig. Teppichboden ist eher unangenehm. Ich habe nach Hausschuhe gesucht, aber auch da hatte es keine. War eher eklig auf dem Teppich barfuss zu laufen. Beim Badezimmer unter der Glasablage hat man gesehen, dass da Wasser darunter gelaufen ist und braun. Zudem war der Abzug im Badezimmer mit Klebeband an die Decke geklebt worden. Trotz dass ich die Badetücher wieder aufgehängt hatte, wurde mir immer jeden Tag ein neues gebracht. Das finde ich gar nicht Umweltbewusst.",3,2016,09,05
36,Sehr zu empfehlen,Sehr gutes Hotel. Das Personal ist sehr aufmerksam. Das Hotel liegt in Strandnähe. Parkplätze sind um die Ecke oder im Hotel selber. Die Open Air Bar ist der Hammer. Zwei Pools. Ideal um vor dem Weggehen noch was zu trinken und zu relaxen. Auf jeden Fall wieder...,5,2016,09,01
36,muy buen  hotel,"un hotel con buena atención y bien presentado, con un bufete muy bueno y restaurante de calidad.

36,Gran hotel en Barcelona,"El Hilton diagonal es un gran hotel, bien situado, a 1 minuto de un centro comercial muy completo con tiendas y restaurantes y a 2 de la playa. Paseando llegas al centro aunque mejor coger taxi. Tiene una terraza increíble con piscina y varias barras, la única pega que cierran las barras pronto y tienes que bajar al lobby a seguir tomándote algo, las copas muy caras pero es lo que tiene un hotel de esta línea. Las habitaciones son grandes y con buenas vistas, wc limpísimos y también muy grandes, el desayuno completo. Es un gran hotel.",4,2016,08,21
36,Rundum zufrieden,"Das Hotel liegt sehr nah am Meer (etwa 3 min zu Fuss), zur Metro sind es etwa 5 min. Vom Flughafen benötigt man allerdings 1 h mit den öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln, da der Airport am anderen Ende der Stadt liegt. Die Gegend ist sehr modern bebaut, ein Shopping Center ist gleich nebenan. Als HHonors member erhielt ich ein Upgrade auf ein Executive Zimmer beim Check-in. Die Lounge ist auch sehr schön mit Happy Hour und Snacks am Abend. Zum Frühstück sollte man jedoch lieber ins Restaurant wegen der grösseren Auswahl. Obwohl dort immer viel los ist, ist der Service gut organisiert und sehr freundlich. Das Zimmer ist sehr gross und modern eingerichtet. Die Liegen am Pool sind recht teuer, aber der Service sehr freundlich. Der Check-out verlief sehr schnell.",5,2016,08,15
36,Tratan de resolver los problemas,La ubicacion es ideal para ir a la playa pero en Barcelona se necesita estar mas cerca del centro. Hay metro a 3 cuadras. Las instalaciones del hotel son excelentes!! La atencion en recepcon es muy lenta.. A pesar de ser HHONORS member tuve que esperar mucho para el check in y no tuve ninguna apreciacion x ser miembro.,5,2016,08,15
36,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona,"Julio 2016
Padrísimo hotel, muy limpio, amplio, nos toco habitación con vista al mar y tienen para agregar una cama a la habitación.
La comida excelente y te incluyen el desayuno.
A una cuadra y media está la playa y cruzando la calle hay un mal con lugares para comer paella y fideua .
Excelente servicio de internet y muy amable el personal ",4,2016,08,03
36,Trato al cliente desastroso!!,"En julio celebramos la despedida de soltera de una amiga en la terraza ""PURO BEACH"" que está dentro del hotel. Eramos un grupo de 10 chicas y reservamos y pagamos esa reserva un par de meses antes. La experiencia fue un desastre, no nos atendieron con los amenities que estaban acordados, nos cobraron de más en las bebidas que pedimos estando en las hamacas, tuvieron que rectificar la factura. Teníamos una mesa reservada para la comida, que dieron a otras personas y nos hicieron esperar 50 minutos a nosotras. El maitre si es cierto que se disculpó y nos invitó a una sangría, nosotras agradecidas pensando que al menos tenian ese detalle, y cual es nuestra sorpresa que nos vuelven a traer la cuenta cobrándonos de más, cosa que ya no nos pareció una casualidad...debe ser el ""hacer"" de los camareros en el día a día. 
Lo peor vino al volver a nuestras tumbonas, la fiesta en la piscina ya había empezado y estaba lleno de gente, por lo que un camarero al ver dos hamacas nuestras (reservadas y pagadas!!) nos quiso echar diciendo que si no estábamos sentadas en ellas no nos pertenecían! Yo le contesté que las había pagado y que mis amigas tenian todo el derecho a disfrutar de la fiesta, poder levantarse e irse a bañar a la piscina. Y el camarero seguia de muy malos modos diciendo que si no consumíamos nada debíamos irnos de allí porque el tenia otros clientes que le compraban una botella y necesitaba nuestras hamacas! Fue indignante!! Creo que alguno de sus compañeros le diría que cerrara la boca, porque nosotras habíamos pagado esas hamacas hace meses y nos salió todo carísimo, como para que nos trataran así. Unos maleducados y prepotentes es todo lo que puedo decir de la gente que lo regenta.",1,2016,08,01
36,Horrible el trato en la piscina!!,"Ha sido una de las peores experiencias de mi vida, la piscina llena de borrachos para poder entrar en la piscina me han hecho un interrogatorio, dos porteros de lo peor que me he encontrado en.mi vida..... maleducados y muy poco profesionales con pinta de matones han sido super desagradables....uno de ellos parecía cubano y otro rubio con muy mala pinta ni en el peor sitio de copas te tratan de esta manera!! vergonzoso de verdad!!  una de las peores experiencias de mi vida, nunca pensé que una cadena hotelera de esta categoría tuviera ese tipo de gentuza trabajando en su hotel. 
Nunca más volveré.",1,2016,07,30

36,Ottimo hotel,"Struttura di recente costruzione, camere spaziose ed accoglienti, personale gentile e disponibile, pulizia impeccabile, molta scelta per la colazione americana un po' meno per quella europea. Nel complesso ottimo soggiorno",5,2016,07,22
36,eher unterer Hilton Standard,"Das Positive ist die nähe zum Strand und das Nahe Einkaufscenter. Das Personal ist bemüht und verkauft gerne Upgrades. Das Exekutiv Zimmer hatte zwar einen Wasserkocher aber keine Tee oder Kaffeebeutel. Die Aussicht auf das Meer ist nur in den obersten Etagen ungestört möglich. Die Poolbeschallung zwischen den Hochhäusern lässt auch keine Atmosphäre aufkommen. Im Vergleich zum Exekutiv-Bereich Frühstück ist die Auswahl und das Personal im ""normalen"" Bereich besser. Das Badezimmer mit einem umständlichen Duschvorhang und Duschkopf ist sehr veraltet. Das Hilton Diagonal Mar ist nur für einen Kurztrip zu empfehlen.",3,2016,07,22
36,Ganz schlecht,"Ganz schlechter Service, unsaubere Zimmer und Geschirr. Sie wechseln die Badetücher nicht wenn sie am Boden sind, sondern hängen wieder auf. Viele Fehler beim Check-in und Check-Out. Manchmal Doppelbooking auf eine Person!!!",1,2016,07,14
36,Pessima avventura notturna senza alcuna assistenza,"Niente da dire sulla qualità della sistemazione a parte l'avventura notturna della prima notte per cui tutto il resto è passato in secondo piano.
Attorno all'una di notte, sono stato svegliato da un ticchettio fastidioso e continuo che non ho avuto difficoltà ad identificare. Il bagno era allagato e l'acqua continuava a cadere dai faretti del controsoffitto. Dalla reception, da me allertata via telefono, mi è stato chiesto (!!!) se volevo l'intervento della manutenzione. E' intervenuto il manutentore che, smontati i faretti accesi a mani nude ed il controsoffitto da cui usciva copiosa l'acqua, non ha potuto che constatare che non era facilmente riparabile la perdita. Richiamato dalla reception mi è stato chiesto se preferivo cambiare stanza (!!!!) e in caso positivo, come ho scelto, mi è stato chiesto se preferivo fare il cambio vestiti etc. la notte stessa o l'indomani mattina. Meno male che ho deciso di fare il cambio la stessa notte perchè, aperto l'armadio confinante con il bagno, ho scoperto che anche l'armadio stesso era allagato, fortunatamente senza danni per quanto riposto all'interno. Non mi è stato inviato alcun addetto per aiutarmi, nel frattempo erano le due abbondantemente passate, ed ho dovuto fare la caccia al tesoro da solo per arrivare alla nuova stanza assegnatami. La mia permanenza era per lavoro per cui l'indomani ho lavorato ""perfettamente riposato"" e rilassato . 
Sono eventi che possono succedere, non ho idea della manutenzione ordinaria. Ciò che stigmatizzo è che nessuno, dico nessuno, dell'organizzazione ha ritenuto doveroso scusarsi per l'accaduto nè durante la mia permanenza nè successivamente nonostante io abbia portato l'accaduto a conoscenza della direzione dell'hotel.
Credo che tale comportamento sia indegno non solo di un Hotel 5 stelle quale l'Hilton e sono certo che in B&B l'attenzione al benessere del cliente sarebbe stata ben diversa.",2,2016,07,13
36,Entspricht nicht dem Hilton Standard,"Überforderte Aufzüge, abgewohnt Zimmer (Meerblick) und schlechter Service (Bademantel, Hausschuhe nur auf spezielle Auffforderung) sowie kein kostenloses Begrüßungswasser auf dem Zimmer lassen mich an Hilton zweifeln.

36,Muy bueno,"Buena piscina, cercano a la playa y excelente restorán. Salí temprano y me quedé sin desayuno. Había solo café en la recepción; a las 5 am es difícil encontrar otro lugar donde desayunar. El hotel tiene el tamaño para tener un mini restorán funcionando la 24 horas.",4,2016,06,24
36,GENIAL!,Todo ha sido perfecto!! Gracias a Susanna por su ayuda y a todo el personal por su amabilidad y servicio! Repetiremos :) El desayuno es súper variado y la zona de la piscina de lujo!! El executive Lounge sin duda es perfecto para trabajar/relajarse sin que haya mucha gente.,4,2016,06,23
36,Precios muy elevados,"Mis amigas y yo fuimos un domingo a la fiesta que se realiza en la terraza 'Pure Beach', sinceramente la terraza impresiona y tiene gran calidad para los clientes, pero considero que los precios son muy elevados para ir un día a tomarte algo, una Coronita me costó 7€ y el mojito 13€ y tampoco era un cóctel maravilla...
Mi opinión es la siguiente: si organizan fiesta para que las personas que no están hospedadas en el hotel puedan asistir, tendrían que abaratar los precios de las consumiciones o al menos si quieren mantener estos precios, para cócteles, deberían de tener un cóctelero profesional.",3,2016,06,23
36,Precio por encima de la calidad del hotel,"Hacía frío incluso desconectando el aire acondicionado
Internet no funcionaba, era lentiísimo.
El desagüe de la ducha no funcionaba.

36,"Etwas abseits,aber schön und gut erreichbar!","Schönes , neues Hotel praktisch am Strand und sehr guter Verkehrsanbindung!
Obwohl am Pfingstwochenende viel Betrieb im Hotel herrschte ( Formel 1 ),war der Service freundlich und aufmerksam. Hatten ein Zimmer mit Meerblick,alles bestens-sauber und schön, gilt auch für das Bad ( Wanne und Dusche mit Glastür ).
Frühstück hervorragend,tolle Auswahl an allem was man sich ( oder auch nicht ) vorstellen kann. Service hat nie die Nerven verloren trotzt der vielen Gästen ( vorallem eine grosse Gruppe von Chinesen war schon ""abenteuerlich"" , halt eine andere Kultur ). Schöne Lounge für HH-Gäste mit Terasse und Blick auf die Sagrada Familia in der Ferne. Gute Auswahl an Snacks und Getränken.Einzig kleiner Nachteil des Hotels:am Wochenende kann man  Dank ""Purobeach"" auch nach Mitternacht noch Musik hören.
Gegenüber vom Hotel ein grosses Einkaufszentrum ""Forum"" und Bus und U-bahn - Stationen um die Ecke,dadurch sind alle HIghlights leicht erreichbar.

Si vas con acompañante, 20 euros más. 
Check out 12 hrs, y te entregan tu habitación después de las 16:00.

Mit dem Taxi vom Flughafen etwa 20 Minuten 35 EUR. Wir hatten ein Zimmer mit partial Sea View und waren begeistert vom Ausblick. Das Frühstück im Hotel war das beste was ich seit langem gegessen habe. Die Auswahl ist der Hammer. Zimmer allgemein sehr schön und groß. Einziger Wehrmutstropfen, der Teppich sollte erneuert werden und das Bad renoviert werden. Ein Duschvorhang ist 2016 nicht mehr zeitgemäß",2,2016,05,23

La habitación, excelente, me gustó sobre todo la cama, cómoda en lo máximo. Mención aparte, la insonoridad, como en casi ningún otros sitio, perfecta. Desayuno, bien, digo solo bien no por su calidad sino porque no acostumbro a desayunar en el hotel, pero si se quiere, pues perfecto. El trato por parte de la gente que lo atiende, insuperable, incluso con detalles, entre otros el interesarse de donde debía desayunar sin haber preguntado y atenderme para solucionar el pequeño trastorno que yo ni noté. Perfecto.",5,2016,04,24
36,Bello e moderno,"Un ottimo albergo a due passi dal mare. E' ben collegato e ha una vista sulla citta', specialmente dai piani alti che toglie il fiato.

Il mio soggiorno è stato per lavoro, la camera molto ampia, pulita, con vista mare e con il bollitore e le tisane. La colazione è stata fantastica, mentre ho trovato troppo internazionale e, poco catalana, la cena a buffet servita sul terrazzo in una serata non troppo calda (7 marzo).

36,3 giornate intense...,"Sono stato per 3 notti in questo hotel per un training aziendale molto intenso, quindi ho speso la maggior parte del tempo chiuso in hotel.
l'hotel e' situato nella zona della Fiera dove tutto il quartiere e' di tipica impronta moderna e di fronte ad un centro commerciale molto grande con tantissimi negozi e vari tipi di proposte gastronomiche da quelle tipiche dei centri commerciali europei a quelle piu' di impronta locale.

23 piani e spazi molto ampi rendono piacevole la struttura; grande terrazza al secondo piano per eventi molto bella ed accogliente.

al check in mi comunicano di aver avuto l'upgrade gratuito al livello superiore e percio' la mia camera e' al 20 piano con una vista veramente notevole e la possibilita' di accedere alla lounge executive situata al 15 piano, molto comoda per la colazione.
la mia camera era ben arredata, con tutte le comodita' e spazi ben distribuiti; in bagno sia vasca che doccia separata. Veramente bella!

avendo provato diversi buffet durante i giorni di permanenza devo dire che ho sempre trovato il cibo proposto di ottima qualita'.

Devo dire che gli ascensori non davano sempre ottime prestazioni e nei momenti di punta si potevano avere tempi di attesa veramente notevoli, ma e' l'unico appunto che potrei fare a questo hotel.

Dall'hotel al mare ci si impiega non piu' di 5 min a piedi mentre per andare in centro bisogna ricorrere ad un mezzo, il taxi e' il piu' facile da reperire.

Potendo ci tornerei sicuramente!",4,2016,01,27
36,War vor dem Puro Beach besser,"Wir waren bisher schon 3x in diesem Hotel. Die Lage ist etwas ausserhalb, aber das Zentrum erreicht man gut über die öV. Den Strand erreicht man innert 5-10min und gegenüber des Hotels hat es ein riesiges Einkaufszentrum (mit unserem, hört sich komisch an, ist aber so: Lieblingsitaliener - auch hier bewertet). 

Das Frühstück ist sehr gut und die Auswahl gigantisch! 

Die Zimmer entsprechen einem 4 Sternehotel. Einziger Negativpunkt: Die Fenster lassen sich nicht öffnen. Mal kurz durchlüften kann man also vergessen. 

Der Fitnessraum ist gut und beinhaltet alles was man für ein Ausdauer- und Krafttraining braucht. 

Das Personal ist sehr freundlich, auch wenn ich mir in einer ganz offensichtlichen Situation etwas mehr Aufmerksamkeit von der Rezeption gewünscht hätte (man lässt Gäste nicht vordrängeln - sprich bei einem guten Service merkt man sich wer als Nächster an der Reihe ist). 

Das neue ""Puro Beach"" beim Pool gefiel uns weniger gut. Die Aufmachung war zwar ganz ok und erinnerte etwas an eine Poolparty in Ibiza, aber irgendwie war die Atmosphäre gezwungen und die Leute kamen mir extrem abgehoben vor. Früher konnte man sich einfach auf eine Liege legen und die Ruhe(!) am Pool geniessen. Heute läuft dort nonstop (viel zu laute) Partymusik und wenn man vorne am Pool liegen möchte, darf man (je nach Liege oder ""Bett"") bis zu 500€ Mindestkonsum bezahlen. Halt alles mehr auf Schickimicki und dementsprechend haben sich auch die Klientel verändert.

36,No me devolvieron chaqueta olvidada en mi habitación,"En mi vida me ha sucedido algo igual que lo acontecido en mi estancia del viernes 30 al sábado 31 de Octubre. Acudí para una convención médica, y me dejé olvidada chaquete beige Massimo Dutti en la habitación. No me di cuenta, pues llegué y me fui en business suit, y la chaqueta sólo la usé por la noche para salir en plan informal. 
Después de llamar al hotel, sólo me dicen que escriba a una dirección de correo detallando qué ocurrió (guest@hiltonbarcelona.com) y que ya me contestarán. Al pasar los días y no recibir respuesta, llamo hoy, dos semanas después, y finalmente me pasan con HouseKeeping. Toman nota de mis datos y me dicen que revisarían a ver si encontraban chaqueta. Me llaman más tarde para decirme que no encontraron nada en la habitación. 
Me parece inaceptable que un hotel de la categoría del Hilton, no pueda garantizar que si un huesped se olvida algo en la habitación lo pueda recuperar. Ha sido muy decepcionante, y me llevo una muy mala experiencia de esta noche en la cadena Hilton.",1,2015,11,17
36,Gran opción para viajes de negocios,"Ubicado en plena Diagonal y cerca del Forum, este hotel dispone de habitaciones amplias, lobby amplio donde puedes tener reuniones y wifi gratuitos. Dispone de una zona llamada Puro Beach donde ves el skyline de Barcelona y te da la sensación de estar en Miami. Ideal para comer o descansar en verano junto a la piscina. 
Tienes parking y enfrente el centro comercial Diagonal Mar (restaurantes, tiendas, cine)",4,2015,11,09
36,Cómodo en la incómoda zona nueva,"Hotel de nueva planta, estilo americano, en una zona bastante inhóspita, residuo de los fastos del Forum. Excelentes servicios generales. Agradable habitación, aunque le falta un sofá (elemento que distingue una verdadera habitación de hotel cómoda de una que no lo consigue). el desayuno algo por debajo de lo esperable.
En conjunto, una experiencia agradable.",4,2015,11,06
36,Esta bien,"Es un hotel bonito y bien ubicado. El desayuno es rico y variado; el personal es muy amable y capacitado.
Las habitaciones son muy bonitas, con buena vista al mar. 
Creo que el tapete de los corredores requiere mantenimiento ya que tiene mal olor.",3,2015,10,30
36,Più un 3 stelle che 4,"Sono stata ospite dell'albergo per motivi di lavoro. Il personale è molto cortese e preparato.  Ma le strutture sono un po' trascurate. Le stanze non insonorizzate e la pulizia non al top. Mi sarei aspettata molto di più,  considerando le stelle ed il nome dell'albergo ",3,2015,10,23
36,Talfahrt,"War früher mein Lieblingshotel...Mit der neuen HHonors-Politik hat sich hier auch Vieles zum Schlechten verändert. So dass mein Fazit lautet: Solider Hiltonstandard - JA, aber kein Rundum-Wohlfühl-Service für den Gast. Bei einem upgrade auf Executive sind Frühstück in der Lounge und WLAN nach wie vor inklusive. Das Personal in der Lounge ist auch wirklich hilfsbereit und unterstützt gern (anders als an der Rezeption)
Wer explizit im tollen Restaurant frühstücken möchte (mit Asiastation zum Frühstück und wirklich allem was das Herz begehrt), sollte von vornherein eine entsprechende Rate buchen. Das Hotel punktet mit der Lage der Lounge (und dem tollen Blick von hier wie aus den Zimmern auf den executive floors) sowie dem Pool. Der Rest ist eher Durchschnitt.",3,2015,10,18
36,Buen Hotel para negocios con diseño peculiar,"El hotel aúna una en su diseño una mezcla de modernidad y sobriedad. Para mi gusto no han conseguido marcar un estilo claro y distinguible. Las habitaciones tienen todo el mobiliario en madera lo que las da un aspecto antiguo y simple que no clásico o lujoso, esto difiere del estilo de la recepción que pretende ser moderno y rompedor. Para gustos los colores, a mi me parece más un hotel de negocios que un hotel para ir en pareja. El buffet desayuno es muy bueno, difícil echar algo en falta.",4,2015,10,15
36,"Un ottimo 4 stelle, leggermente lontano dal centro","Sono stato a Barcellona con mia moglie ed una coppia di amici nell'ultima settimana di settembre. Inizialmente i miei amici avevano scelto un hotel al centro, in cui avevano già soggiornato. Da vecchio cliente della catena Hilton li ho convinti ad optare per l'Hilton Diagonal Mar che, per quanto più lontano dal centro, ci avrebbe consentito un cospicuo risparmio. Così fatto, gli stessi amici mi hanno poi confermato la loro piena soddisfazione, nonostante la differenza di categoria (l'altro era un 5 stelle). Ancora una volta l'Hilton non ha deluso le mie aspettative. Bella struttura, stanze spaziose, anche se ho riscontrato qualche piccola mancanza di manutenzione alla mobilia (porte dell'armadio disassate, qualche scorticatura), palestra piccola ma ben attrezzata, piscina in buona posizione e con un gradevole ""arredamento"" (bei lettini ed ombrelloni), personale attento e cortese. Menzione speciale per la reception, dove Greta ed Eleonora, grazie alla loro simpatia ed alla conoscenza dell'italiano (sono italiane!) hanno reso la nostra permanenza più... lieve. Eccellente la colazione: una delle migliori tra le tante provate in giro per il mondo, anche se rapportate ad alberghi più stellati. In definitiva un'ottima scelta, con un rapporto qualità-prezzo assolutamente concorrenziale. Se proprio si vuole cercare il pelo nell'uovo, ho trovato gli extra un pò cari (bar alla piscina e minibar in camera) e la posizione un pò distante dal centro, con un contorno urbano non trascendentale, moderno sì, ma un tantino freddo e, come dire, desolato. Poca roba.",4,2015,10,13
36,Muy agradable,"Hotel moderno, limpio con excelente atención del personal de servicios, tiene piscina muy linda y agradable al exterior. Restaurant con desayuno buffet muy completo, bar muy agradable con personal que maneja varios idiomas",5,2015,10,02
36,Meeting,"Lage: am Stadtrand, aber nur 5 min zu Fuß zur Metro, mit Metro Ca. 25 min zum Zentrum. Dafür nur 5 min. Zu Fuß an sauberen Strand!!
Lokation: Personal unverbindlich freundlich. Zimmer im 20. Stock sehr tolle Aussicht. Groß und geräumig, aber üblicher Standard. Dusche im Zimmer Abfluss sehr schlecht, fast verstopft. Essen toll. Für Pool keine Zeit.
Kritik: w- lan Regelungen indiskutabel für ein Business Hotel mit entsprechenden Anforderungen, bzw. Profil. Freies w- lan nur an wenigen Bereichen ( Lobby), instabil,langsam. Im übrigen Hause nur für Bezahlung ( 12.95 für 1 Tag!!)    Und dann auch nicht immer funktionstüchtig. Scheinbar im ganzen Haus keine klöppelten ( Zimmer und div. Übrige Toiletten) mit entsprechenden Hinterlassenschaften. Nogo für Einrichtung dieser Kategorie. Frühstücksbüffet ok, toll waren die Süßspeisen und das viele frische Obst. Fazit: mehr auf dem Etikett als dann drin steckt. ",3,2015,09,19
36,Ausgezeichnet!,"Das Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona ist ein Top Hotel. Es bietet eine super Aussicht, guten Service und einen klasse Beachclub. Der Strand, die Mall und Taxis sind in unmittelbarer Nähe. Sehr empfehlenswert.",5,2015,09,18
36,"Exzellentes Business-Hotel, direkt am Strand","Für Städtereisende ist die Lage am Diagonal-Mar Einkaufszentrum sicherlich nicht optimal, für Geschäftsreisende gibt es kaum etwas besseres.

Das Hotel ist modern eingerichtet - die Zimmer sind typischer HIlton-Standard und bieten alles, was man für einen produktiven Kurzaufenthalt benötigt: stabiles WLAN, Schreibtischfläche mit ausreichend Steckdosen, bequeme Boxspring-Betten, Dusche mit erfrischendem Wasserdruck und Ruhe zu Schlafen. Der Service war professionell und freundlich, das Frühstück sehr gut - vor allem für spanische Verhältnisse.

Besonders hervorzuheben sind zwei Dinge: zum einen die Executive Lounge. Zutritt hat, wer bei Hilton Honors Gold- oder Diamond-Status hat oder ein entsprechendes Zimmer bucht. Zum einen ist die Lounge toll gestaltet mit großem Angebot an Snacks und Getränken und einer schönen Außenterrasse, wo man auch frühstücken kann. Zum anderen ist das Serviceteam sehr engagiert und kompetent.

Zum anderen ist die Lage direkt am Stadtstrand von Barcelona auch auf einer Geschäftsreise nicht zu unterschätzen. Nach Feierabend oder Mittags mal einfach eine Stunde Mittelmeerfeeling genießn ist ein tolles Extra, noch dazu kostenfrei.Und wer das nicht möchte - auch der Poolbereich im 1. Stock ist großzügig, modern und sauber!

Fazit: mein Lieblingshotel für kurze geschäftliche Aufenthalte in Barcelona!",4,2015,09,03
36,Pésima atención en recepción,"El servicio de Cristobal en recepción es menor que nulo, absolutamente ninguna idea de lo que se requiere para atender clientes y sus necesidades mínimas, es una lástima que la falta de actitud de una persona tire por la borda la atención e instalaciones en general.",3,2015,08,30
36,Wunderbar gelegenes Hotel für Kongresse und Sommerfeeling,"Dem Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona gelingt der perfekte Spagat zwischen Business - und Wohlfühlhotel. Die dem Hilton Standard entsprechend eingerichteten grossen Hotelzimmer verfügen über eine atemberaubende Aussicht über das Meer inclusive Sonnenaufgang am Morgen oder fast noch spannender, über die pulsierende Stadt inclusive Lichtermeer in der Nacht. Urlaubsfeeling vermittelt einem sofort die wunderbare Terrasse mit schönem Pool und angesagter Bar. Auch Lunch und Dinner sind unter freiem Himmel eine schöne Entspannung zur deutschen Schlechtwetterzeit. Die Nähe zum Meer lädt zu wunderbaren Jogging oder Radtouren ein, die Anbindung an den öffentlichen Verkehr ist durch Metro, Bus und Tram gewährleistet. Genau gegenüber des Hotels befindet sich eine Shoppingmall mit allen wünschenswerten Einrichtungen wie Kino oder einer ganzen Gastronomieetage. Einziger Wehmutstropfen für uns: der Swimmingpool öffnet morgens erst um 10 Uhr, was ein genüssliches Baden vor dem Frühstück oder nach dem Frühsport verunmöglicht.",4,2015,08,26
36,¡Me encantó!,"Es la primera vez que me hospedo en un hotel Hilton, y desde ya, me encanta la experiencia!
Reservamos la ""Relaxation room"", con vistas al mar, lindas! Sobre todo al amanecer! Desde la habitación podías ver la piscina de la terraza Purobeach, la cual invitaba a estar ahí. Lástima que nos tocó día nublado y corría mucho aire, por eso no usamos la piscina. La bañera hidromasajes de la habitación fue lo mejor, mirando la televisión dentro. Todo muy limpio y ordenado.
Cenamos en Purobeach, todo a la parrilla y nos pareció exquitisito, les recomendamos el Solomillo de Ternera y el Entrecot.
El momento del desayuno, que lo sirven de 7am a 10:30 am tiene bastante gente esperando pero avanza rápido y te ubican en tu mesa muy amablemente. Hay una variedad muy amplia de comida como por ejemplo champignones, tocino, jamón, salmón, huevos revueltos, tortilla de patata, toda clase de embutidos, café, leche, mermeladas, etc en fin, de todo para escoger y comer bien.
El personal tanto en los restaurantes como en recepción fueron muy amables. 

De todas maneras consideraré a los hotels Hilton para mi próxima estancia! :)",5,2015,08,24
36,Increible,"No pudo haber mejor servicio ni atención por parte de Bruno Alonso, un chico de Cádiz que nos atendio increiblemente, haciendonos sentir a mí y a los mios como en casa.

36,"Buen hotel, malos detalles","el hotel es de lujo, muy bueno, buen servicio, eso si el wifi es catastrofico y eso q es de pago, los ascensores te esperas un monton, creo xq activan 1 solo de los 4 q tienen y el horario del desayuno algo corto o poco flexible, ayer nos quitaron el pan y demas estando a mitad desayuno, no es correcto, cierra el comedor y aguanta un poco o cierra antes, pero deja desayunar, por lo demas muy bueno, eso si algo alejado del centro",4,2015,08,17
36,inolvidable,mi habitacion fue hermosa estuve en el piso 22 con una vista de la ciudad unica el  trato de el empleado de recepcion admirable el personal del restaurant un encanto me llevo un recuerdo lleno de admiracion ,5,2015,08,15
36,Rundum zufrieden,"es gibt keinen Grund zu klagen. Bis auf...
Purobeach ist ein Club, der den Poolbereich im zweiten Stock belegt. Bei einem Zimmer mit Meerblick kommt man dann leider in den Genuss der dort dröhnenden Musik. Irgendwann hört die Musik auf und das Hotel gehört wieder den Hotelgästen.",4,2015,08,14
36,Ist das ein Hilton?,"Insgesamt konnten wir dieses Hotel bereits ab unserem ersten Tag an als Enttäuschung bewerten. Von allen Hiltonaufenthalten war dieses Hotel bei weitem auf dem letzten Platz. 

Wir erhielten ein ""Upgrade"" welches jedoch kein ""Upgrade"" war, im Gegenteil: Angefangen bei unserem Badezimmer, welches komplett heruntergekommen ist (im wahrsten Sinne der Worte: die Deckendielen scheinen abzufallen!), der angebliche ""Relaxation Whirlpool"", der am Bedienelement und in einer Düse bräunliche ekelhafte Verfärbungen aufweist, beschädigte Fliesen, bräunliche Verfärbungen an den Dichtungen im Einstiegsbereich der Dusche, ein funktional unbrauchbarer Whirlpool-Fernseher (kaum Kanäle zu empfangen, nur ein paar), keine Klobürste, usw usf. Hinzukommt, dass sich im Zimmer die Fenster nicht öffnen lassen, so dass insbesondere nasse Bekleidungsstücke/Handtücher erhebliche Geruchsbeläsitungen verursachen können, die allenfalls (ungenügend) über die ""Heizung/Klimaanlage"" beseitig werden sollen.. Das Internet im Zimmer ist katastrophal, zum professionellem Arbeiten kaum geeignet. Das WLAN funktionierte sogar ""besser"" als der direkte Internetkabelanschluss. 

Sehr frustierend und ärgerlich waren jedoch zwei Themenbereiche: 

1. Es wird hier mit einem Außenpool geworben, jedoch darf man hier nicht unmittelbar am Pool liegen, sondern muss sich mit lieblosen 3.-Reihe-Liegen ""im Hintergrund"" begnügen. Hiltongästen wird am Anfang suggeriert ""selbstverständlich dürfen Sie am Pool liegen sofern keine Reservierungen vorliegen"", jedoch wird im Anschluss ins Blaue hinein behauptet, ""die Liegen sind reserviert"", obwohl diese stundenlang leer standen. Der Gast wird quasi dazu gezwungen jeden Tag kostenerhebliche Reservierungen am Pool vorzunehmen. So hat man uns sogar vom Liegebereich entfernt.. absolut kein Wohlfühlfaktor, sondern unglaublich frech. Für die einzelne Liege will man 25 Euro einkassieren (ein Gläschen Alkohol und ein klitzekleines Obsttellerchen mitinbegriffen). Die schönen großen Liegen werden nur bei einer Ausgabe von 500 Euro im Purobeachbar zur Verfügung gestellt (mit einem separaten Menüangebot). Das Argument ""Free WiFi"" zieht jedoch nicht, da ich vom Pool aus auch problemlos ins HHonors-WiFi Zugriff hatte.  

2. Trotz Hilton-Goldmitliedschaft wurde uns der Zutritt in den Executivebereich verwehrt. Das ist uns zum ersten Mal passiert. Anfragen an der Rezeption werden nüchtern und kalt zurückgewiesen. Eine richtige Begründung hierfür erhält man nicht. Die Reklamation bei Hilton Deutschland hat noch immer keine Antwort/Lösung bewirkt. Auch haben wir vom klassischen zwei Mineralwasser Angebot für HHonors-Mitglieder nicht profitieren können. Erst nach unserer Beschwerde konnte man am Ende des 2. Tages (wir hatten 4 Tage gebucht) ein Brief unter der Zimmertür durchschieben, in dem der Hinweis war, bedienen Sie sich bitte aus der Minibar.. das lustige ist: in der Minibar gab es kein Mineralwasser (lediglich eine kleine Portion stilles Wasser). 

Auch das Frühstücksangebot hat uns nicht zugesagt. Wir fanden die Auswahl viel zu wenig. Das ""Nachfüllen"" von begehrten Produkten hat teilweise sehr lange gedauert. 

Positiv ist allein die Nähe zum Strand. Vom Stadtkern ist man sehr weit entfernt, mit Taxi und öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln kann man es jedoch bequem und schnell erreichen. 

Da wir die gewohnte Hiltonqualität hier bei weitem nicht wiederfinden konnten, können hier als Ergebnis festhalten: für uns absolut kein Hilton!",1,2015,08,12
36,Un Hotel excelente!,"Un gran hotel, excelente atención del personal, ubicación ideal, el centro comercial de enfrente cumple con cualquier necesidad de Shopping. El espacio PuroBeach donde se encuentra la piscina está perfecto para pasar un buen rato de relax y algo de fiesta. Volvería siempre!",5,2015,08,10
36,Pésimo el internet !!!!,"Cuando se va de convención a un hotel de una cadena como Hilton se piensa que se tendrán todas las facilidades para que todo salga excelente sin embargo aquí pasa lo opuesto; el personal de recepción no es el más amable del mundo y a veces actúan como si le hicieran un  favor a la gente por atenderlos, la conexión a internet es nula la mayor parte del tiempo y en el mejor de los casos es lentisima.
Hay cosas que se pueden rescatar como la atención de meseros y capitanes de banquetes así como de bell boys la cual es formidable. 
Fuera de eso dejan mucho a desear. ",2,2015,08,06
36,Un lujo de hotel,"Estábamos de paso y sólo pasamos una noche en el hotel, pero lo disfrutamos a tope: la habitación de buen tamaño con vistas al mar, bañera al lado de la ventana para relajarse, buenas amenities, desayuno completo y riquísimo, piscina con personal amabilísimo y camas balinesas, en fin, un lujo. Aunque tiene un gran centro comercial justo en frente, está bastante lejos del centro de Barcelona. Nosotros nos movimos en coche porque en agosto la zona azul es gratuita y no hay tanto problema para aparcar. También encontramos sitio para dejar el coche por la noche en las inmediaciones sin tener que usar el parking del hotel.",5,2015,08,06
36,bueno,"lejos de todo pero cerca dl mar , atención es buena , precios caros , solo Wii fii lobby , no tiene jacuzzi, la regadera es petit, la zona de alberca esta muy augusto , un taxi del hotel a las ramblas 14 euros , no tiene batas ni pantuflas , el tamaño de los cuartos esta bien",4,2015,07,29

- Gran Ubicación, al lado de la playa y cerca de zona de restaurantes. En frente de un centro comercial donde satisfacer todas tus posibles necesidades.
- El servicio inmejorable: siempre con una sonrisa, pendientes de poder ayudarte, tanto en la recepción como en cualquier parte del hotel (desayuno, piscina, restaurante, garaje, recepción,...)
- Las habitaciones: amplias, cero ruidos, limpieza absoluta, la mejor cama posible con las almohadas más acogedoras. Los productos del baño de gama alta y generosos.
- Las vistas son impresionantes en las habitaciones superiores. 
- Gimnasio 24 horas, una piscina con un gran servicio, amacas, toallas, servicio...todo comodidad y amabilidad.

La decoración básica de este tipo de hoteles, sin extravagancias, pero bonita. La atención del personal no ha estado todo lo perfecta que se podría esperar, tanto en recepción cuanto gobernanza. Un punto por mejorar. Lejos del centro, buena opción si se estará por la zona del Forum. ",3,2015,07,16
36,Superlativo!!,"Esperienza unica e memorabile quella vissuta in questa struttura bella e dal servizio impeccabile!!
Personale molto disponibile e sopratutto attento alle esigenze dei clienti.
Un plauso in particolar modo va a Greta, Sabrina ed Eleonora, le tre ragazze italiane che lavorano all'interno dell'albergo.
Strepitosa la colazione e la possibilità di accedere alla launge room, in qualsiasi momento della giornata. 
Incantevole la vista e molto confortevoli le camere, silenziose e climatizzate.
Un posto che assieme alla città, superlativa anch'essa, ti ruba il cuore e rende il distacco veramente difficile.
Luogo anche comodo da raggiungere, lontano la giusta misura dalla movida della città. 
Decisamente bella e funzionale anche la piscina assieme all'ottimo centro benessere.

36,Mal trato al cliente,Es imposible que un cliente  llegue de  para hacer una reserva y luego  lo manden a un ordenador  que ni funciona el internet  para  que haga el check in   pudiendo   hospedarse en una suit y que luego le pidan que se retire del  despacho  con desprecio..,1,2015,07,12

36,Gusto a poco para un hotel con excelente ubicación,"Lo bueno:
- La ubicacion del hotel es muy buena (frente al shopping Diagonal y a 200 metros del área costera).
- La terraza/area de piscina está concesionada. Muy simpatico el layout y con mucho estilo ""bar lounge"". Pueden resultar un poco pesados los camareros ofreciendo bebidas y venta de servicios y haciendo rondas programadas para relevar las necesidades de los usuarios. Pero, en terminos generales esta muy bien.
- El servicio de alimentos y bebidas del desayuno es bueno PERO si se va temprano, si se llega tarde, la fruta está mustia y no llega a cumplir con expectativas medias
- Destacable la buena atencion del personal a cargo del front desk y del servicio de alimentos y bebidas del desayuno

Lo malo:
- Es INCONCEBIBLE que un hotel de esta categoria y este precio no tenga servicio de wi fi gratuito en las habitaciones. Hasta el gobierno de España tiene planes para favorecerlo!
- La ducha pierde agua y se inunda el sector del baño en la que esta ubicado (nos habia pasado lo mismo en otra ocasion, hace un par de años en otra habitación), horrible

Caro por lo que ofrecen...",3,2015,07,07

las copas bien a un precio correcto, la terraza amplia, lo recomiendo.",4,2015,07,03

Muy reocomendable.",4,2015,06,11
36,Hotel muy bueno pero en el que se paga por respirar,"El hotel es excelente en muchos sentidos. Estaba situado justo para lo que necesitábamos (en el forum). Muy amables en el trato, además nos subieron de categoria y nos pusieron en una habitación con vistas al mar aunque habíamos contratado la más barata sin vistas y por el mismo precio.

La habitación muy amplia, una cama enorme y comodísima. Lo mismo puedo decir de la almohada. Se duerme muy muy bien.
Era la semana del Primavera Sound y como estaba muy cerca, se escuchaba con la ventana cerrada pero tampoco como para no dejarte dormir, yo dormi perfectamente pues las ventanas quitaban casi todo el barullo. Las ventajas de la zona es que estaba enfrente del c.c diagonal mar que tiene muchas opciones de restauración donde elegir.

La única pega del hotel es que se paga por respirar y además es caro. El hotel es caro (Barcelona, zona bien y cerca del mar, cuatro estrellas, es normal que sea caro), el desayuno muy caro, espero que valiera la pena pero por ese precio nosotros pasamos. Acceder a la piscina o bañarse es gratis, sí, pero si lo que quieres es pasar un ratito tumbado en una hamaca y darte un baño, no. Por tumbarte en la hamaca había que pagar, y aunque te regalasen una cesta de frutas y no sé qué, lo más barato eran 50 euros (luego ya tenias que elegir entre 150 o 500, toma ya). Si quieres gratis, túmbate en el suelo, aunque alomejor no se puede. Bajamos, vimos el percal y subimos otra vez. 

En fin, el hotel de 10, pero si quieres disfrutarlo de otra manera que no sea dormir, prepara el bolsillo o espera a que te toque el euromillón.",4,2015,06,04
36,Buen hotel para ir de trabajo,"Buen hotel para ir de trabajo. El desayuno me parece excesivamente caro, 25€!!!

36,Typisch Hilton,"Ein komfortables Hotel mit großen, sauberen Zimmern und sehr guter Lage zum Strand.

Die Zimmer sind ausreichend groß und komfortabel ausgestattet. Die Betten waren bequem. Ich finde es immer gut, wenn die Kleiderschränke mehr als nur einen Bügel haben oder gleich ganz eingespart werden. Der Kleiderschrank war angenehm gross und bat ausreichend Platz.

Das Bad war ebenfalls - speziell für ein Stadthotel - geräumig und gut ausgestattet.

Die Zimmer sind für ein Stadthotel ausreichend dimensioniert (executive) und ohne negative  Überraschungen modern eingerichtet. Lediglich die Wassertemperatur der Dusche konnte sich nicht ganz zwischen heiß und kalt entscheiden.  Die bereits in anderen Berichten erwähnte Executive Lounge können wir für abends als überragend bestätigen.  Frühstück im Hauptrestaurant war perfekt.  Der Pool wurde bei unserem Besuch saniert, sodass wir diesen nicht nutzten.  Der Service allgemein war excellent professionell geschult  und authentisch  zuvorkommend,  was bei der Hilton Gruppe nicht zwingend gegeben sein muss.

En la parte positiva, personal de lo mejor que me he encontrado en mis muchos viajes y en frente hay un centro comercial con pequeños restaurantes donde destaca un italiano muy bueno. Si tiene que trabajar en Centro de Convenciones, tiene 2 hoteles mucho más cerca y que están mejor.",3,2015,05,14
36,"EL HOTEL ESTÁ MUY BIEN, PERO LAS PERSONAS QUE TRABAJAN EN EL HOTEL SON LAS QUE LO HACEN EXCELENTE","Mi opinión está basada en casi 2 años de alojamiento en este hotel, por razones de trabajo (habitualmente semanas de domingo a viernes). En mi segunda semana de estancia tuve algún problemilla (año 2013), pero apareció mi salvadora ""ELVIRA GÓMEZ"" y gracias a ella recuperé la confianza en el Hotel. Me trató tan estupendamente y de manera tan profesional y atenta que no pude negarme a darle otra oportunidad al hotel. No sé qué hizo pero desde ese momento todo el mundo me trató como el cliente más VIP haciéndome sentir como en casa. Recurrí varias veces a Elvira cuando venían jefes y compañeros y el hotel estaba full y ella sacaba habitaciones para que no tuviéramos que alojarnos en otro hotel. Elvira, una verdadera ""crack"" (si algún día me dedico al negocio hotelero la ficho como Dtor. General de la cadena).
El personal de recepción excelente (Tony, Marlene, etc. incluso otros que se fueron ya..) y el personal de sala fantástico (a destacar los Jefes de Sala David y Ticiano, que se hacen amigos de los clientes con su buen hacer y dedicación), Eligio (mezcla de sevillano y catalán tan entrañable que tiene gracia hasta para traerte la cuenta) y Daniela (otra ""crack"" detrás de la barra y en las mesas; no sabría si es más profesional que encantadora o al revés...???).

36,Tagung mit Flair,"Das Hotel verdient es allemal den Namen Hilton zu tragen. 
Service gut, Hotel sehr sauber und gemütlich. 
Der Ausblick ist phänomenal! Es lohnt sich ein Zimmer in den oberen Etagen zu buchen. Auch ein Besuch der ""Roof-Bar"" ist empfehlenswert.
Ein bisschen Kritik darf aber auch sein. Die Zimmer, insbesondere die Nasszelle könnte aufgefrischt werden. Hatte mit dem Wasserhahn so meine Mühe (das Wasser spritzte hinten raus)",4,2015,05,08

Desayuno abundante y variado.",4,2015,04,16

36,Muy bueno ,"Muy bueno. Como corresponde a un Hilton. El desayuno es escaso pero cubre lo necesario.

36,Buon hotel commerciale,"Sono stato in questo Hotel per una Covention. L'Hotel è situato vicino al centro commerciale Diagonal Mar e a soli 400 metri dalla spiaggia Nova Mar Bella.
E' una classica struttura commerciale; ha il pregio di essere abbastanza nuovo e ben tenuto, le camere sono grandi, ben arredate e pulite.
c'è anche una piscina che vista la stagione non ho visitato.
E' abbastanza distante dal centro per cui forse non è molto adatto a chi va a Barcellona per turismo.",4,2015,04,02
36,Excelente servicio personalizado y cálido,"Recomiendo altamente este hotel por todo. El servicio personalizado, la comida del restaurante, las vistas, la tranquilidad, la limpieza...

36,Fantastico,"Ho soggiornato 3 notti in questo hotel fantastico. Struttura nuova, moderna è bellissima. Stanze abbastanza grandi molto pulite e arredate con materiali anche pregiati. Bagno grande con tutti confort. Colazione abbondante e molto buona. Peccato solo che nella hall, per guardare la partita dell'Italia, avevano un proiettore che proiettava sul muro ma causa le vetrate molto grandi del hotel entrava molto sole e della partita non si vedesse quasi niente. Il centro si raggiunge velocemente con mezzi pubblici o taxi. ",5,2015,03,13

Vistas al mar. Muy cómoda y agradable. Las instalaciones del hotel son muy buenas, en especial para convenciones. Gimnasio, sauna, terraza y piscina. Precio Hilton.

La pulizia della stanza è stata ottima . La colazione della mattina era davvero eccezionale e ricca sia di cibi dolci che salati.

Consigli agissimo !!!!!!!!!",5,2015,01,26
36,muy buen hotel,No me gusto la musica a tono muy elevado en el hall del hotel. Resultaba algo molesta para hablar en el mismo. Personalmente me parece de poco gusto; mas de hotel de playa que de hotel de lujo urbano. Algo de frio en la habitacion al llegar,4,2015,01,25
36,gutes Business Hotel recht zentrale Lage und Nähe zum Meer,"war 2 Nächte dort. Vom Flughafen ca. 20-30 min, Nähe zu den Hafenrestaurants, und von dort ist alles gut erreichbar.

36,Hermosa vista al mar desde un hotel nuevo...,"Aunque está a unos 15' de la zona céntrica, en una más de empresas nuevas, eso no molesta, ya q luego se llega a descansar disfrutando de la amplia vista a sus alrededores y de la comodidad de los grandes espacios de los que dispone este hotel. 
Las habitaciones son muy cómodas, la cama y ropa de blanco muy buenas.
En el restaurante ofrecen una carta super variada y deliciosa. Todo el personal es muy correcto y predispuesto a ayudar. 
Dato: Justo enfrente, cruzando la calle, hay un shopping para quienes prefieran las compras.",5,2014,12,22
36,Bello!,"Ho soggiornato in questo hotel alcuni anni fa insieme al mio ragazzo.

36,Totalmente recomendable!,"Todo el estilo Hilton, la atención del personal excelente, las habitaciones amplias y muy luminosas. El Desayuno completisimo y todo muy fresco.

Zeugt davon das sich am Anreisetag niemand um unser Anliegen gekümmert hat.",2,2014,09,02
36,Desilucionante experiencia,"Por razones más de obligación que de placer me hospedé en el Hilton Diagonal Mar de Barcelona  justo después de haberme hospedado en el hotel vecino AC Fórum; estuve en una habitación de la misma categoría en ambos y aunque las comparaciones son odiosas, fue desilucionante encontrarme con un Hilton con tantas carencias.
Por ejemplo en los baños no existe un colga toallas cerca de la ducha, el servicio de minibar contaba con cafetera pero no suministraron el café hasta después del segundo día, la lámpara de la mesita de noche que es de latón brillante, dejó de serlo a casua del polvo que se acumuló, los vidrios de las ventanas sucias como si hubiera llovido en los últimos días, y me consta que hacía más de 2 semanas que no ha llovido, el bufet del desayuno, muy escaso en surtido, etc. En resumen, una experiencia que espero no se repita y a un precio excesivo.",3,2014,09,01
36,Wochenende vom Feinsten,"Diese Haus lässt keine Wünsche offen, nur zu empfehlen. Insbesondere wenn man WE Angebote nutzen kann.
Vom Flughafen aus ist es meiner Meinung nach sinnvoller mit dem Taxi zu fahren.
Verkehrsanbindung zur Innenstadt ist in paar gehminuten vom Hotel zu erreichen.",5,2014,09,01
36,Convention aziendale,"Il personale alla reception è molto gentile.
La posizione è comoda: vicino al mare, di fronte a un centro commerciale e alla metropolitane. 
Le stanze sono grandi, silenziose, ben curate e pulite. In stanza c'è il bollitore per tea e caffè.
Colazione buona.
L'hotel è un pò fuori dal centro, ma comunque ben servito dai mezzi (bus e metro).",4,2014,08,29
36,Pésimo servicio,"Bueno, os voy a contar un poco sobre nuestra experiencia en este hotel.
Estuvimos en agosto, 6 noches, reservamos a través del booking 2 habitaciones. 
El hotel carga a nuestra tarjeta de crédito el importe de una habitación, el mismo día por la noche, carga el doble de importe. A la llegada al hotel nos vuelven a cargar el doble del importe de la estancia. En total nos cargaron el triple del importe de la estancia
Durante 3 días, en vez de estar disfrutando de nuestras vacaciones, estuvimos solucionando los cargos que realizo el hotel. Los de contabilidad se negaban a hablar con nosotros, las chicas de recepción siempre decían lo mismo, que el sistema de cobros de Hilton es muy complicado. 
A los 3 días de discusiones, nos devolvieron uno de los importes (no todo), y el mismo día por la noche, nos cargan más dinero.
Todavía seguimos con todo este asunto sin solucionar. 
El hotel hace lo que quiere con las tarjetas de crédito, y les da igual si contabas con ese dinero para tus vacaciones.
Mi consejo es: no les deis vuestro número de tarjeta!!
Y no somos los únicos, había otra pareja que les cargaron importes de restaurante y mini bar que no eran suyos!!
Es vergonzoso! ",1,2014,08,22
36,Teilnahme am Executive Bereich,"Hotel sehr sauber und mit Hintergrund Sommerurlaub wird ein Badebereich angeboten, welcher im Vergleich zu anderen Hotels sehr angenehm groß ist. Mit Nutzung der Executive Lounge hatte man genügend Zeit, Urlaubsstimmung einzuleiten....",4,2014,08,07
36,Keine Wünsche offengelassen,"War Ende Juni geschäftlich dort. Wegen Problemen bei der Buchung bin ich gleich bei der Ankunft auf einen Executive Room upgegradet worden, im 21. Stock und mit halbem Meerblick. Der Holzboden war sehr schick genau wie das Bad. Außerdem hatte ich Zugriff auf die Executive Lounge, eine extra Terasse im 15. Stock, wo es tagsüber immer Snacks und Getränke umsonst gab. Hotellobby sehr freundlich und einladend, außerdem gibt es im 2. Stock noch einen großen Außenbereich mit Bar und Pool, wo man es auch gut aushalten konnte,  selbst wenn man wie ich arbeiten musste. An einem Wochentag findet dort immer eine AfterWork Party statt, das hab ich mir nur am Rande angeschaut, schien aber ganz nett. Frühstück war auch super - große Auswahl und frische Sachen. Personal überall sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend, sogar ihr Handy konnte meine Kollegin an der Rezeption mal ohne Probleme aufladen lassen. Nicht zuletzt die Lage ist zumondest wenn man auf dem Kongressgelände unterwegs ist, auch unschlagbar - fußläufig zum Kongress, nah am Strand und die ShoppingMall ist auch direkt gegenüber.  Alles in allem ein sehr angenehmer Aufenthalt! ",5,2014,08,06
36,Angebot verbessert,"Es ist schon viel, auch von mir, über das Hotel geschrieben worden. Da meine Frau gehbehindert ist, hatten wir uns trotz schlechter Erfahrung ausgehend vom Managment, wieder entschlossen dieses Hotel zu buchen.
Ersteinmal wieder ein großes Lob dem gesamten Team des Executive Bereichs sowie den anderen Angestellten im Servicebereich.
Wir waren sehr erstaunt, dass das Managment wieder zu den Hilton üblichen Öffnungszeiten der Executive Lounge zurückgekehrt ist. Jetzt kann man die wunderbare Terasse wieder bis 22 Uhr nutzen. Es gibt sogar bis 22 Uhr Wein, Bier und Sekt, sowie weiteren Alkoholikas.
Danke auch jenen,die sich massiv beschwert hatten. Ich dachte, das Managment unter Herrn Enrique Aranda sei Beratungsresistent.
Wir haben uns wohl gefühlt.
Einzig der aufgeplatzte, verschimmelte Holzrahmen im Badezimmer gibt Anlass zur Kritik, man hatte uns aber ein neues Zimmer angeboten, was wir jedoch ablehnten, da dieses Problem eigentlich in vielen Zimmern auftaucht.
Wir werden dieses Holtel jetzt wieder häufiger buchen.",4,2014,08,04
36,Sehr gutes 4 Sterne Hotel in Strandnähe,"Modernes Hotel in schöner, ruhiger Strandlage. Freundliches hilfsbereites, nettes Personal. Sehr gute Einkaufsmöglichkeiten. Hopp on, Hopp off Bushaltestelle in unmittelbarer Nähe. Sehr gute Restaurants in der Nähe.",4,2014,08,03
36,Sehr gutes Standard-Hotel in guter Lage - 15 Minuten von der City entfernt,"Für unseren fünftägigen Kurzurlaub in Barcelona haben wir im Juli 2014 das Hilton Diagonal Mar als Domizil ausgewählt - Junior-Suite in einer oberen Etage mit Zugang zur Executive-Lounge. 

Das Hilton Diagonal Mar befindet sich nahe der U-Bahn-Station ""El Maresme/Forum"" der Linie 4 /L4. Mit der U-Bahn ist man circa 20 Minuten unterwegs - vom Placa Catalunya (mit 1x Umsteigen) oder von der Station ""Jaume I"" (direkt). In Richtung Meer geht man von der Station durch das Einkaufscenter ""Diagonal Mar"" oder aussen herum und gelangt zu Fuß so schnell innerhalb von sieben Minuten zum Hilton (wenn man nicht eine Frau bei sich hat, die noch mal ""eben kurz"" bei Zara oder Oysho oder Sfera oder etc. reinschauen möchte). 

Bei unserer Ankunft im Hotel wurden wir professionell-freundlich empfangen. Der Check-In ging reibungslos und schnell. Unser Zimmer befand sich im 13. Stock, schon beim Aussteigen aus dem Fahrstuhl präsentiert sich Barcelona und die nahe Bergwelt mit voller Pracht. Eigentlich scheint es fast unmöglich diese Aussicht zu toppen... aber der Ausblick aus der Junior-Suite schafft es!! Einfach top. Auf der einen Seite Sagrada Familia, Mont Juic, unten die großzügige Hotel-Poollandschaft und ganz nah das Meer! Wirklich wunderbar, bei uns kam bei dieser Ankunft und diesem Ausblick sofort das Gefühl von Urlaub auf. Durch die rings um das Hotel ebenfalls recht neu entstandenen Hotel-, Büro- und Appartementgebäude und die Nähe zum Meer hat man sogar ein bisschen das Gefühl in Miami gelandet zu sein.

Das Zimmer - in diesem Fall die Junior-Suite - bestand aus einem Flur/Wohnraum der gleichzeitig gut zum Arbeiten genutzt werden könnte, des Weiteren aus einem großzügigen Schlafzimmer und einem geräumigen Badezimmer. Alles in allem war es sauber und in einem ordentlichen Zustand mit einer zu erwartenden 4-Sterne-Standard-Ausstattung - es fehlte lediglich eine Toilettenbürste im Badezimmer. 

Das Personal im Hotel war in allen Bereichen freundlich und aufmerksam. Hervorheben möchte ich zwei Service-Bedienstete im Frühstücksbereich im Restaurant, die unsere Tochter im Kleinkind-Alter mehrmals zum Lächeln gebracht haben. Leider habe ich versäumt die Namen der beiden Herren zu notieren (ih glaube einer hiess ""Carlos""), aber eigentlich waren alle Servicemitarbeiter sehr aufmerksam und absolut kinderfreundlich, bei einigen hatte man aber das Gefühl, dass sie nicht nur einen Job machen, sondern diese Arbeit lieben. Das haben wir in so einer Häufigkeit schon lange nicht mehr an einem Ort so erlebt oder empfunden. Klasse und weiter so!

Klasse ist auch die Poollandschaft, die eben neben einer guten Bar und einem 20-Meter-Schwimmbecken auch ein 35-cm-tiefes Kinderbecken enthält. Perfekt für uns mit Kleinkind! 

Ebenfalls großartig ist die Nähe zum sauberen - bei gutem Wetter aber sehr vollen - Stadtstrand.

Fazit: Wir würden wieder hier einkehren. Daher möchte und kann ich das Hilton Diagonal Mar für einen Kurztrip nach Barcelona nur empfehlen.  

Nur einen kleinen negativen Abzug in der Bewertung gibt es für die fehlerhaften zusätzlichen Minibar-Posten auf der Endabrechnung, welche aber nach Beanstandung sofort wieder rückgängig gemacht wurden.",5,2014,08,01
36,Os espero en la tumbona de la piscina,"Segunda semana de julio con los amigos de la cuadrilla en este Hotel perfecto para visitar Barcelona en Verano. 
Normalmente las segundas veces suelen ser peores que las primeras pero con este hotel me pasó lo contrario. La piscina más grande que lo que la recordaba ideal para echar unos largos y tirarte en la tumbona.
El buffet completísimo y fuera de buffet me prepararon un gofre casi al instante así como los cafés expressos. El único fallo las teteras que no calentaban mucho.
Habitaciones amplias y buenas vistas desde el piso 13. Ascensores rápidos.
Bajar con el albornoz a la piscina y tirarte en la tumbona a pasar el clavo con un Gintonic bien echo no tiene precio. (Otro fallito: no tiene Rom Pampero en el Brisa bar)
Respecto la localización está situado a 400 mts de la playa y a los que nos gusta el running tiene kilómetros de paseo marítimo tanto hacia el fórum como hacia el puerto olímpico.
Si te gusta el patinaje mejor todavía gente practicando conos en el forum y fitness en las esplanadas paralelas a ronda litoral.
Si te va el skateboard hay unos bowls increíbles al lado del estadio de canaletas y otro de agresivo a escasos 300 mts del Hotel.
Si te va el vóley playa hay redes puestas a lo largo de la playa.
Si te has pasado todo el fin de semana de juerga y no le has comprado un detallito a la novia o a la familia, tienes un gran centro comercial al lado para ser un golfo y quedar como un Rey.",5,2014,07,24
36,Como para repetir!,"Estuvimos unos amigos de Tolosa (Gipuzkoa) pasando el fin de semana del 11 de julio en Barcelona y estuvimos alojados en el Hilton Diagonal Mar. Perfecto todo: la atención, las habitaciones, el desayuno, la localización y en general, un ambiente agradable y tranquilo. Como para repetir!! Imanol",5,2014,07,22
36,Merece la pena,"Un magnífico hotel, muy bien situado para visitar Barcelona y a la vez a lado de la playa. Las instalaciones están muy bien al igual que las habitaciones.

Punto y aparte las vistas desde la terraza, sobre todo por la noche.

El único pero es que es pelín caro, por lo demás perfecto.",4,2014,07,20
36,Muy buena experiencia,"La experiencia en la estadia fue muy buena, solamente quisiera que ofrecieran internet gratis en las habitaciones. Los demás servicios ofrecidos por el hotel son muy buenos. El desayuno es muy completo y la atencion es acorde al hotel. De mi experiencia no surgen temas negativos a señalar",5,2014,07,16
36,Bonito hotel cerca de Diagonal Mar,"Es un hotel muy bonito, desayunos excelentes y con un buen ambiente en los dos bares. Muy tranquilo si vienes por negocios, y está bastante bien conectado con el centro de la ciudad y el Puerto. recomendable",4,2014,07,08
36,Buona posizione!,"L'albergo è indubbiamente un buon albergo, in una buona posizione e con stanze piccole ma pulite e confortevoli. Unico neo: le finestre non si aprivano e quindi si è costretti a vivere con l'aria condizionata. Buona la colazione e buon servizio dal personale.",3,2014,06,29
36,ATTENZIONE AI LADRI,Ho soggiornato tre notti con la famiglia per un viaggio di lavoro insieme ai colleghi di tutta Italia di una nota compagnia di Assicurazioni..... la prima sera siamo stati derubati noi della borsa di mia moglie e le altre sere altri due colleghi il tutto nella lobby dell'hotel non ci hanno supportato in nessun modo anzi cercavano in tutti i modi di coprire il malfatto davvero incredibile e pessimi.....,1,2014,06,28
36,Okay,"Executive Room war gut. Alles war sauber und hat funktioniert. Nur ein Papierkorb fehlte.
Die Sicht über die Stadt und der Meerblick sind klasse!
Pool war okay und die grosse Sonnenterrasse mit Bar war super.
Im Foyer gibt es freie Internet-Terminals mit Drucker!
Fussball-Leinwand in der Bar war nett während der WM.
Lage am Strand und Nahe eines Einkaufszentrums mit guten Restuarants und der Metro ist sehr gut.

Beim Frühstück ist uns negativ aufgefallen, dass trotz Gold Status kein Zugang zum Restaurant-Frühstück inklusive war. So mussten wir extra zahlen.",3,2014,06,26
36,Excelentes vistas al mar!,"Elegimos una habitación con vista al mar, muy lindo despertarse con semejante vista!
el desayuno muy rico y variado.
La ubicación del hotel, si bien es un poco más alejado del centro, está a media cuadra del bus turístico y enfrente cuenta con un centro comercial enorme (ojo que los domingos está cerrado), donde se puede comer en restaurantes muy lindos y no tan caros.
Se encuentra muy cerca de la playa.
El personal super atento.
Sin dudas para recomendar si no quieren estar en el lio del centro!",5,2014,06,19
36,Hotel di livello,"Abbiamo scelto questo hotel prenotando proprio all'ultimo un pacchetto su Expedia volo+hotel. La struttura è molto bella, ha anche la piscina (perfetta per l'estate), la palestra, la sauna. La nostra stanza era spaziosa, silenziosa e con un letto comodissimo.. Avevamo anche la vasca idromassaggio che dopo una giornata in giro per la città è l'ideale per rilassarsi!!
L'hotel si trova in una posizione decentrata però con neanche 5 minuti a piedi si raggiunge la fermata della metro che con circa 15 minuti porta al centro quindi alla fine il tragitto è fattibile; molto meglio stare un po' decentrati ma almeno soggiornare in un bell'hotel e dormire bene.
La colazione perfetta tutte le mattine, c'era di tutto di più dal dolce al salato e anche alimenti senza glutine. Solo l'ultima colazione, la domenica, ha lasciato un po' a desiderare perché già verso le 10 del mattino c'erano tantissime persone, pochissimo personale, le macchinette per fare caffè, cappuccino, thè, ecc. non funzionavano e i tavoli non erano apparecchiati.
Il personale gentile, disponibile (abbiamo avuto un problema con la vasca idromassaggio, comunicato la mattina e la sera al nostro rientro era tutto sistemato) e parlava bene inglese.",4,2014,06,15
36,NOrmalito,"Escogimos la habitación que tiene  vistas a la ciudad, de noche precioso lo malo es que las ventanas no se abren ni un poco y es como agobiante.
La piscina que esta en el 2do piso cierra a las 20h y esta muy bien, en ese mismo piso esta el gym y la sauna en cada uno de los baños, es decir si vas en pareja, cada una de las partes por separado (muy mal). Nosotros desayunábamos en el launch, que esta en el piso 15 y unas vistas al mar espectaculares.
La carta del servicio de habitaciones la veo muy básica y carísima, aconsejo comer/cenar fuera hay mucho mas variedad y calidad, además de tener un centro comercial enfrente. El personal atento.",4,2014,06,14
36,Ideale per lavoro,"l'hotel è ben tenuto anche se gli arredi delle camere standard non sono niente di particolare e ci si aspetterebbe qualcosa di più da un hotel di questa categoria.
i prezzi dei servizi e del minibar sono vergognosi. Consiglio a tutti l'acqua piccola a 5,75 euro. 
ma stiamo scherzando?
La posizione dell'hotel è un po' scomoda, in venti minuti a piedi si arriva al porto olimpico ma la fermata della metro è davvero vicina. 
Nel complesso buono ma per una vacanza non lo sceglierei.",4,2014,05,30
36,solito casermone ...da congressi,"per motivi di lavoro mi sono dovuta spostare da una bellissima struttura in centro città a questa molto decentrata e scomoda per raggiungere i siti da visitare, il centro si può raggiungere in 15 minuti di taxi o con la stazione della metropolitana vicino l'albergo a circa 3 minuti a piedi. Detto questo le camere sono spaziose ma molto datate come arredamento, con la moquette che detesto specialmente in un hotel, antigenica al massimo e il bagno...che dire.. c'era la vasca con la tenda ..niente accappatoio e niente ciabatte..il kit bagno essenziale..la colazione buona..niente wifi in camera se non al costo di 20/25euro circa al giorno, gratis nella hall...bella la vista mare al 16 piano della mia camera...conclusione allo stesso prezzo si può trovare di meglio..consiglio: rimodernate l'arredamento delle camere ..sono veramente brutte",3,2014,05,29
36,Un macro hotel sin personalidad pero correcto,Hotel sin encanto ni personalidad. Mejor para negocios que para placer. Correcto simplemente. La botellita de agua del minibar cuesta 6 Euros. Recomendación: ira a Alcampo enfrente del hotel y comprar un pack de 6 por 2.5 Euros. El desayuno continental mediocre. Lo mejor la cama que es cómoda y la tele.,3,2014,05,23
36,Livello eccellente,"Molto bella l'ubicazione, a poca distanza dal mare e dal Centro Congressi e comodissimo per raggiungere il centro di Barcellona; ampi gli spazi comuni e molto ben tenuti con facile accessibilità; camere molto spaziose, e pulite, dotate di tutti i comfort, bagno confortevole. Sia la colazione che il parnzo sono abbondanti, ben presentati e di qualità, anche il vino è di ottimo pregio; il personale è efficente, premuroso e servizievole. 
Unici punti dolenti sono i pochi ascensori (a volte, nei momenti di maggior affluenza, si arriva ad attese di 10-15 minuti per poter salire o scendere dai piani) e l'eccessivo costo delle consumazioni dal minibar in camera.",4,2014,05,21
36,Business perfetto!!!,"Ottimo hotel nel centro congressi di Barcellona, zona facilmente raggiungibile, veramente veloce anche il collegamento con il centro, spazi infiniti sia nella zona conferenze che nelle sale pranzo, pulizia eccellente...assolutamente da consigliare!!! Soggiorno durante un meeting di lavoro ...ah ottimo anche il Cino...dettagli da non sottovalutare!!! Personale molto cortese.",5,2014,05,19
36,ampiamente promosso,"hotel molto comodo in quanto a due passi dal mare e ad un centro commerciale in cui è possibile mangiare a qualsiasi ora. anche la fermata della metropolitana Forum è a due passi ed in 5 minuti si puo raggiungere il centro. Colazione abbondante e variegata, personale cortesissimi insomma molto consigliato!!!!!!!!!!!!!",4,2014,04,25
36,vacation,"Ein Hilton, wie man es erwartet.
Man betritt das Hotel und befindet sich in einer großzügigen Lobby, Check Inn und Bar übersichtlich, sofort im Blick.
Das Personal beim Check Inn wie beim Check Out ist kompetent, freundlich und hilfsbereit.
Mal was Neues in Spanien, eine gut fahrbare Tiefgarage.
Die Zimmer sind ausreichend groß und Wertigkeit eingerichtet.
Die ExecutiveLounge mit schöner Terrasse entspricht im Service und der Speisenqualität dem gewohnten Standard.
Wenn es ein Defizit gibt, dann die schlechte Isolierung der Zimmer zum Flur. Bei uns war es kein Problem. Wenn das Hotel voll belegt ist, kann das anders sein.
In der Summe kann das Hotel in seiner Lage und Qualität für eine Citytour empfohlen werden.",5,2014,04,22
36,Super Wochenenddestination,"Sehr freundlicher und zuvorkommender Service. Vor allem beim Frühstück wurden wir großartig umsorgt.
Zimmer sind zwar nicht neu renoviert, aber absolut zweckmäßig und sauber. Ausblick auf das Meer wunderbar.
Etwas außerhalb der Stadt aber mit guter Anbindung an die Stadt, einige schöne Restaurants in Laufnähe und Shopping Mall direkt gegenüber.
Ich würde jederzeit wieder dorthin fahren.",4,2014,04,21
36,Ottimo livello,"Camere spaziose, bagno confortevole. Colazione adeguata con personale efficiente e premuroso. Non avendo pagato personalmente non ho un'idea del rapporto qualità prezzo. Alcune piccole manchevolezze per un Hotel a 4 stelle.",4,2014,04,08
36,Hilton style,"Quando si viene ospitati all' Hilton in un executive floor è difficile potersi lamentare, servizi di eccellenza, lounge e bar disponibili, wifi efficacissimo. Lo stile è sempre lo stesso, moquettoni e lunghi corridoi. Piccola palestra. Si trova un po' decentrato ma vicino ad una fermata del metro, e comunque è molto bello passeggiar sulla diagonal se avete voglia in un' ora siete a Catalogna. Colazione ben fornita",4,2014,04,06
36,Hotel ist gut Personal freundlich,"Ich war zum 2. Mal in diesem Hotel und es war wieder sehr schön. Der Empfang sehr professionell und freundlich und das Zimmer im obersten Stock war tip top. Alles hat funktioniert und was sauber. Am Fr. Abend war eine After-work-Veranstaltung in der Halle, was ganz nett war und wohl einmal im Monat stattfindet. 

Die Executive Lounge ist schön und wenn es nicht zu stark windig ist, kann man schön auf der Terrasse sitzen und auf das Meer hinaus schauen.

Vom Angebot her ist das Frühstück sehr gut, aber am Abend eher durchschnittlich. Ich würde mir in Barcelona ein bisschen mehr Tapas wünschen und vielleicht auch einen Sherry im Angebot. Am 2. Tag war es wenigstens schon ein bisschen besser vom Angebot her, aber eben auch ohne das erwartete ....

Etwas unschön fand ich, dass ich eine Telefongebühr bezahlen muss, wenn ich eine Toll-free-Nummer wähle. Dies ist nicht sehr kundenfreundlich und passt so garnicht zum Hotel.",4,2014,03,31
36,Genial hotel,"Muy buen servicio, bien ubicado con buenas conexiones amable y acogedor lobby grandes zonas de reuniones. Destacar la amabilidad de sus empleados sobre todos de recepción. La ciudad espectacular, buena gastronomía,mucho que conocer, museos, parques y bares muy estilos os y originales destacarm el bosque de las hadas, área de raval gótico y ramblas, buenas fiestas y buen día para ir al camp nou. Los mejores días de sol en una súper ciudad y junto al mar más pedir y con mucha aceptación y gran desayuno",5,2014,03,31
36,Excelente cena Restaurante Indigo,"Fuimos a cenar con unas amigas al Restaurante Índigo, coincidiendo con la fiesta que organizan cada mes en el Pistaccio Bar. La cena inmejorable, buena calidad y servicio, cuidando todos los detalles. La fiesta perfecta, cocktails, música en vivo. Una noche genial. Repetiremos",5,2014,03,27
36,Excelencia en la calidad Hilton,El personal en general y el de conserjería en particular nos atendieron con suma amabilidad. Pedimos una cunita para nuestro bebe y fuimos complacidos extraordinariamente.  Este será sin duda nuestro hotel de referencia para aconsejar a nuestros contactos que quieran visitar Barcelona.,5,2014,03,25
36,Fiesta genial,"El pasado mes asisti a la fiesta que cada mes se celebra en el Pistaccio Bar de Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona. Muy buen amibiente con musica en directo, desfile de moda y sorteo de algunos premios. Cocktails geniales y tapas exquisitas con buena relacion calidad-precio. El servicio digno de la calidad de un Hilton. Muy recomendable!!! Y lo hacen cada mes,  muy buena idea para la zona, no hay lugares similares.",5,2014,03,24
36,Cena en el restaurante,Hace unas semanas fuimos unas amigas a cenar al restaurante del hotel y luego una copa había fiesta . Cenamos estupendamente y la relación calidad precio muy buena un ambiente genial. El servicio en el restaurante fue muy cuidadoso y amable. Seguro repetimos,5,2014,03,23
36,Hotel de calidad ¡,"Estuve con mi esposa en este Hotel invitado con un grupo de convencionistas de una Empresa en el año 2.011 en el mes de Septiembre. Muy bueno ¡ No obstante que está lejos de la zona de Paseo de Gracia y Las Ramblas, la zona en la cual está es bonita, un gran centro comercial justo enfrente cruzando la calle, vista al mar desde las habitaciones y hay transporte fácil.  Volvería si tengo oportunidad.",4,2014,02,26
36,Ausgezeichnet!!,"Meine Frau hatte mich zu meinem Geburtstag fuer eine Nacht ins Hilton Diagonal Mar eingeladen. Wir bekamen eine Junior Executive Zimmer im 8. Stock, mit traumhaften Blick aufs Meer und auf die Stadt, da das Zimmer an der Ecke des Hotels liegt, und somit 2 Fensterfronten hat.
Im Zimmer war alles in gutem Zustand und sehr sauber, gibt ein Vorzimmer mit Schreibtisch, Sofa und Sesseln zum Arbeiten und Verweilen, im Schlafzimmer ist ebenfalls eine Sitzecke vorhanden. Fernseher sind neu, und das Bett ist gross und die Matratzen sind in hervorragendem Zustand.

Zimmer berechtigt auf zum Zutritt in die Executive Lounge im 15. Stock, mit toller Terrasse, und freien Snacks und Getränken. Service war sehr gut dort, bekamen sofort erklärt, wann welche Services angeboten werden.

Frühstück ist sehr reichhaltig und gut, internationaler Standard mit einigen spanischen Gerichten angereichert.

Ein- und Auschecken verlief problemlos, Personal war jederzeit kompetent und aufmerksam.",5,2014,02,17
36,Buen gusto,"Me aloje un fin de semana con mi marido, nos encanto la habitación con vistas al mar, un desayuno súper completo ( con zumo de naranja natural) en donde se dirigen a ti con una sonrisa en todo momento y pendientes si necesitas algo.
Muy recomendable en todos los sentidos; nos fuimos encantados y volveremos sin lugar a dudas.",5,2014,02,17
36,Nel complesso ok... Ma meno di altri Hilton,"Albergo buono, un po' decentrato ma comodo come servizi. livello direi un po' più basso rispetto ad altri Hilton. Decisamente solo x lavoro, e prezzi degli extra troppo alti (25 euro al giorno il wifi e accesso gratis solo nelle aree comuni e' una follia) 
",3,2014,02,07
36,nur ein Name....,"Hotel hällt nicht, was es aufgrund des Namens und des Preises verspricht. Zimmer sind zwar geräumig und mit schöner AUssicht, jedoch teilweise ""in die Jahre"" gekommen. Aufgequollene Holzverkleidungen und verklakte Duschen sind in der Liga nicht akzeptabel. Fehlende Kleinigkeiten wie Papierkörbe/Mülleimer und Toilettenbürsten fallen störend auf. Das Hotel liegt zwar sehr nahe am Strand, jedoch recht weit entfernt vom Stadtzentrum und dem kulturellen Leben. Alles in Allem würde ich bei meinem nächsten Barcelona Aufenthalt dieses Haus nicht wieder wählen.",3,2014,02,06
36,buono,"Nel complesso buono eccetto i prezzi del minibar e del bar (una bottiglia d'acqua di un litro € 7,00). La colazione internazionale molto fornita di alimenti salati, scarsa in alimenti dolci. Caffè espresso in distributore assolutamente pessimo.",4,2014,02,03
36,Muy buen servicio,"A pesar de estar ubicado un poco lejos del centro, el hotel es muy lindo y acogedor, por lo que no nos importaron las distancias. El servicio de los chicos que atienden fue muy bueno, especial agradecimiento a Nuria por su buen trato. Recomendamos!",5,2014,02,03
36,esperienza da evitare!!!!!!!!,Abbiamo soggiornato in questo hotel a fine anno ed è stata un'esperienza negativissima!!! Da notare che spesso utilizziamo la catena hilton nel mondo ma questa volta siamo rimasti molto delusi...Poca pulizia nelle stanze...Colazione davvero penosa (basti pensare che gli yogurt erano scaduti e solidificati ed il cibo in generale scarso)...Vicino agli ascensori non venivano svuotati i cestini porta rifiuti e spesso alla reception non c'era personale...Le giustificazioni che ci sono state date in risposta alle nostre lamentele ci sono sembrate davvero irriguardose...DA EVITARE!!!!!,1,2014,02,02
36,vergogna!!!!!,"Premetto che sono un membro Hilton Honors Gold,detto questo sono a riportare la disastrosa permanenza al diagonal dal 30-12-2013 al 02-01 2014.
Iniziamo col ceck lentissimo mi viene assegnata (come previsto per i gold gratis il passaggio a una camera di categoria executive quindi anche il mio amico con suo figlio decide per questa soluzione ovviamente pagando l'up).Saliti in camera con grande stupore notiamo che la sua camera non era forse pronta per accogliere gli eventuali ospiti poichè rassettata in maniera sommaria e con molta polvere sul parquet.La mattina successiva andiamo a colazione al piano executive (dove ti aspetti di trovare ancora di più della proverbiale sontuosa colazione Hilton) invece lo sconforto prende il posto della delusione quando ci ritroviamo davanti ad un piccolo angolo con quasi il nulla!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Cercando di mettere qualcosa nello stomaco prendiamo dei cereali e dello yogurt e solo dopo averlo ingerito ci accorgiamo che era scaduto da oltre una settimanaaaaa!!!!!!Vacanza rovinata con relativi problemi intestinali...avendo fatto notare la cosa alla responsabile, vengono fatti togliere tutti gli altri vasetti anch'essi scaduti abbondantemente.Dopo l'accaduto troviamo in camera un piatto con della frutta e un specie di vino frizzante da due soldi e sorpresa delle sorprese nella frutta c'era una fragola marcia!!!!!!!!!!!!Tornati in Italia mandiamo una mail di protesta alla sede honors in Inghilterra,alla quale seguono molte telefonate da parte mia e tutto questo per sentirmi dire che quello che era accaduto ci poteva stare!!!!!!!!!!Vergognateviiiiiiiiiii!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1,2014,02,02
36,Muy buen servicio,"Un amigo nos regalaba una noche de hotel en Barcelona y como coincidía con el fin de semana de Feria de Abril (que se celebra en el Fórum, justo al lado) escogimos el Hilton Diagonal Mar para poder ir directos después de cenar y tomar algo.
La ubicación del hotel es bastante buena aunque no está pegada al centro. Prácticamente delante hay una parada de metro de la L4 que te deja en el centro (Gótico) en 10 minutos y hay también una parada de tranvía que te acerca a la Plaza de las Glorias desde donde se llega a pie a la Sagrada Familia en 10 minutos más o menos. Lo bueno que tiene es que la playa está justo al lado.
Nos dieron una habitación doble (aunque con dos camas) que no era nada del otro mundo, bastante normalita. Hay que decir que los colchones eran comodísimos y que las sábanas olían muy muy bien y eran muy suaves. La única pega de la habitación es que el baño era muy pequeño, prácticamente minúsculo, y que había pocas amenities (como para una persona, cuando en esa habitación nos alojábamos dos). Del desayuno no puedo opinar porque nos levantamos tarde y no nos dio tiempo a bajar.
Lo mejor del hotel, sin duda, es el servicio: son todos muy amables. Tuvimos un pequeño percance por la mañana porque la puerta se había atascado y no había manera de abrirla; llamamos a recepción y en menos de diez minutos ya nos habían solucionado el problema.
Si tuviera que repetir seguramente repetiría, pero no es nada del otro mundo por ser un cuatro estrellas.",3,2014,01,23
36,mai più Hilton Diagonal,Ho condiviso con mio figlio e due amici questa esperienza all'Hilton di Barcellona. Purtroppo diverse cose sono andate storte: - problemi intestinali dovuti a yogurt scaduto - pulizia camera non adeguata - colazione in ambiente non adeguato Lo sconsiglio vivamente.,2,2014,01,09
36,4 * Justito,Ubicacion ideal junto a la playa pero caro y escasos recursos respecto a la competencia y calidad de otros hoteles de la misma zona y categoria (por ejemplo en el baño no habia albornoz). Excesivamente orientado al turista extranjero. La entrada a las 16:00 horas demasiado tarde y la salida a las 12:00 horas demasiado temprano.,2,2014,01,04
36,Genial,"El hotel está situado en una zona muy buena de Barcelona, en donde puedes encontrar multitud de restaurantes, tiendas, etc. Las vistas son preciosas, tanto si te toca una habitación que da al mar, como una que da a la ciudad, ya que puedes ver desde Montjuic al Tibidabo, la Sagrada Familia, la Torre Agbar, etc. El personal de front-desk es muy agradable y simpático, al igual que el personal del restaurante o del executive lounge. El desayuno, es inmejorable!",5,2013,12,17
36,Excelente estancia,"El personal de Recepcion y es muy profesional y agradable. Conoci a la Manager, Merche, y nos trataron muy bien. Indigo, el restaurante, el desayuno es completo y el staff eficiente. Las instalaciones muy bonitas y la ubicación también. Justo al lado de uno de los centros comerciales mas grandes de Barcelona. Nos dieron planta alta y vistas al mar, que relax!! Volveré seguro!!",5,2013,11,26
36,Non offre servizi a 5 stelle...,"Cinque stelle? Ma dove stanno? L'Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona non è affatto un hotel di questa categoria. Ho soggiornato per lavoro 3 giorni in una camera doppia e non solo non ho trovato le pantofole ma il kit bagno era per 1 sola persona (1 cuffia, 1 shampoo, 1 sapone ecc.). Arredamenti vecchi, wifi solo nelle aree comuni (siamo nel 2013!) oppure in camera a prezzi proibitivi... Insomma non lo consiglierei.",2,2013,11,01
36,"Teuer, Servicemängel, unfreundliches und inflexibles Personal an der Rezeption","In diese Hotel geht man nur, wenn man zu einem Kongress eingeladen wird, sonst gibt es in Barcelona bessere, stadtnähere und vor allem preiswertere Hotels. Wir hatten einen Sonderpreis von knapp 200 (!) Euro DZ/Nacht.

Frühstück und Lunch absolute Spitze, das muss man schon sagen. Restaurantpersonal sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit, offenes Kochen nach Wunsch, sehr frisches Obst, Riesenauswahl und beste Tischwäsche.

Zimmer groß und geräumig, Badezimmer auch. Gute Ausstattung.

Was allerdings in dieser Preisklasse verwundert ist der nachlässige ZImmer-Service und die Gedankenlosigkeit des entsprechenden Personals. Wir waren zu zweit, hatten aber nur ein Wasserglas neben der Minibar. An der Kaffeemaschine lagen drei Päckchen Dosenmilch aber keine Kaffeepäckchen. Auf dem Flur vor unserem Zimmer (Belegfotos anbei) wurde über zwei Tage nicht gesaugt, ein Tablett des Nachbarzimmers vom Frühstück stand noch in der Nacht danach auf der gleichen Stelle.

Personal an der Rezeption reichlich unbeholfen und nur auf freundliche Standardauskünfte programmiert. Ich wollte meine Rechnung umschreiben lassen (Rechnung für meinen Arbeitgeber muss auf EZ lauten) aber das ging angeblich nicht. Der Leiter der Rezeption wurde obendrein auch noch pampig, als ich ihn darauf hinwies, dass das in allen Hotels der Welt gemacht würde. Mit einer frechen abweisenden Handbewegung beendete er die Unterhaltung und ließ mich einfach stehen. Bis heute ist dieses Problem nicht gelöst. Der Nachgeschmack bleibt.",2,2013,10,28
36,Non offre quello che promette,"Accoglienza scarsa, arredamento vecchio, la wifi in camera costa eccessivamente (dovrebbe essere compresa nel prezzo), kit bagno per 1 persona anche nella matrimoniale, niente pantofole. Rapporto qualità-prezzo scarso.",2,2013,10,22
36,Gut,"Das Personal war sehr freundlich und bemüht. In der Rezeption waren die Angestellten manchmal etwas überfordert aber auch sehr freundliche, etwas caotisch. Alles in allem guter Eindruck. Was sehr störend war, dass die Fenster im Zimmer nicht einmal zum Kippen sind, keine frische Luftzufuhr! Das ist nicht sehr angenehm.",4,2013,10,18
36,Solo per business a Barcellona,"Grande Hotel in cui è facile sentirsi spersonalizzato. Centinaia di camere, piani su piani. Il nome è altisonante, ma ho trovato la struttura un po' polverosa e demodè. 
L'hotel è pulito, ben collegato rispetto al centro con la metropolitana che porta alla Barcelloneta o vicino alla Ramblas... ma mi aspettavo di piu', considerando il prezzo.  Perfetto per chi viaggia per lavoro con l'azienda che paga direttamente! diversamente meglio un hostal o un bed and breakfast nel centro della città. Per la posizione decentrata va bene solo per motivi di affari. Ottima la vicinanza ad un grande centro commerciale.",3,2013,10,13
36,Comodo per affari,"Ho soggiornato 4 notti in questo albergo. Si trova in una zona della città completamente  dedicata  a chi è a Barcellona per lavoro, anche raggiungere il centro città è molto comodo con la metropolitana. L'albergo si trova sul lungo mare ed è molto piacevole passeggiare sia la mattina presto sia in tarda serata. Ottima la colazione. Tante sale riunione anche modulari. Sicuramente da consigliare per chi va a Barcellona per lavoro.",4,2013,10,05

36,"mare, ampi spazi e a volte bel panorama...","In posizione parecchio decentrata rispetto al centro e alla prima periferia di barcellona, ad 8 minuti a piedi dalla fermata della metro e con fermata dell'autobus 41 direttamente sotto l'hotel, consigliata per arrivare direttamente senza cambi a placa catalunya in 25 minuti gustandosi il panorama delle strade di barcellona. Sotto l'hotel anche la fermata del bus notturno N7 che collega con il centro di barcellona per tutta la notte.
Camere ampie, alcune con vista direttamente sulla bellissima spiaggia.
Arredi trendy, nuovi, spaziosi e confortevoli.
Alcune camere hanno la vasca idromassaggio (ma mancano di bidet).
Manca lo scopettone per il bagno, forse non molto elegante ma decisamente utile se si divide la stanza con qualcuno.
Personale molto disponibile, preparato ed elegante.
Possibile prenotare dall'hotel senza sovrapprezzo il biglietto per i principali musei ed attrazioni di barcellona (sono riuscita a prenotare i biglietti per La Pedrera quando il sito ufficiale di prenotazioni on line diceva essere tutto prenotato fino ad un paio di giorni dopo). Colazione supermega abbondante e davvero varia, superiore ad un normale 4 stelle.
Wifi non gratuito in camera, disponibile nella hall per otto ore consecutive al giorno, con traffico tuttavia molto lento per la grande quantità di persone connesse.
Piscina su una terrazza al secondo piano tuttavia senza gran panorama (grattacieli antistanti).
Disponibile anche piccola vasca idromassaggio (6 persone al massimo circa).
La zona fitness un po' angusta, con tuttavia ottimi attrezzi.
Davanti si trova il centro commerciale Diagonal Mar con tantissimi negozi anche di catene tipiche spagnole per souvenir ed abbigliamento/accessori con tantissime possibilità per mangiare/cenare sia in fast food che in ristorante.",4,2013,09,12

36,Nur Veränderungen,"Ich war erneut im Diagonal Mar und mußte erneut Änderungen in der Executive Lounge feststellen. Ich frage mich langsam, warum wird überhaubt eine Angeboten. Das Angebot ist mittlerweile der Minimum Standard, den Hilton verlangt zu einer Zimmerrate, die sich im oberen Bereich abspielt. Wie kann man innerhalb von 6 Monaten fast monatlich das Konzept ändern?
Jetzt gibt es zum Frühstück wieder Wurst, aber zur Cocktail Hour gibt es nur noch Bier, Wein und Sekt. Die tolle Popcorn Maschine dient jetzt dazu, dass auf der Außenterasse und auch im inneren Bereich nur noch Popkorn auf dem Boden liegt. Das kostenlose  Frühstück Angebot für Hilton Gold Member in der Lobby ist ein Witz. Mein Zimmer auf einer Executice Etage war im Badbereich stark renovierungsbedürftig, in der Dusche überall Schimmelflecken in den Fugen und Gummidichtungen. Zeitweise roch es auch nach Abfluss im Zimmer. Ich rate jedem ab, einen Aufpreis für den Executive Bereich zu bezahlen, das Geld kann besser investiert werden. Dem Hotel Managment empfehle ich die Sparpolitik zu überdenken und aus dem Raum und der Terasse z.B. ein Cafe zu eröffnen, in dem man im Sommer auch die Abendstunden auf der Terrasse verbringen kann. Aber solange es noch Kunden gibt, die für den Executive Bereich bezahlen, rechnet es sich vermutlich fürs Hotel. Empfehlenswert wäre auch ein Hinweis über die Öffnungszeiten der Lounge auf der Homepage, würde natürlich einige Leute wieder davon abhalten,  den Executive Bereich zu buchen, wenn ich geschäftlich unterwegs bin, bin ich seltens vor 20:00 Uhr im Hotel. Es gibt in Barcelona noch ein anderes Hilton und dort bekommt der Gast wie immer den gewohnten Standard ohne Veränderungen. Für mich ist dieses Hotel jetzt Geschichte.
Mir tut nur das motivierte, freundliche Personal leid, dass sich permanent die Beschwerden anhören muß, nur weil das Mangment versagt.",3,2013,09,06
36,vera vista mare,"Anche se non centralissimo ha la metropolitana di fronte, senza contare che i taxi in Spagna sono veramente economici.

36,Hotel Hilton de Mar in Barcelona,"wir wollten auf nummer sicher gehn und haben wir ""hilton"" hotel gebucht. allerdings war dann nicht das ""drinn"" was ""drauf"" stand ! das hotel war etwas abgewohnt und ein bisschen schnuddelig. auch die liegen beim pool (wenn man noch welche ergattern konnte) waren ziemlich am ende.  das personal war sehr freundlich und kompetent und hat vieles wieder wett gemacht. kurz und gut der gesamteindruck ""durchschnittlich"".",3,2013,08,22
36,Ottimo albergo posizione non centrale,"Gli alberghi di questa catena non si smentiscono mai e infatti anche questo di Barcellona è molto bello,camere ampie con letti comodi,una colazione che accontenta anche i più esigenti,personale cortese. Wifi disponibile gratuitamente nella hall. La posizione non è il massimo se volete girare il centro di Barcellona,ma con circa 20 minuti vi potete spostare e raggiungerlo facilmente con metro o taxi. Davanti all'albergo troverete un centro commerciale per mangiare e fare acquisti. ",4,2013,08,05
36,Noche de bodas,Ideal para pasar velada romántica en habitacion deluxe. El trato del personal del hotel fue inmejorable y la habitación deluxe con vistas al mar es un lugar idóneo para una ocasión especial como una noche de bodas.  El hotel nos dejó champan y un pastel sorpresa en la habitación.,5,2013,07,30
36,Immer wieder!!,"Ich hatte erst 1x in einem Hilton übernachtet (in Malmö), war aber so überzeugt davon, dass ich für Barcelona wieder gebucht habe. Und ich wurde nicht enttäuscht. Vor Anreise hatte ich freundlichen E-Mail Kontakt mit der Rezeption, da ich bereits deutlich vor Check-In Zeit angereist bin. Mir wurde versichert, dass sie das Beste tun werden ein Zimmer zu meiner Anreisezeit fertig zu haben oder, falls dies nicht möglich sein sollte, mein Gepäck aufzubewahren und ich sofort sämtliche Hotelausstattungen nutzen könne. Als ich um 11 Uhr ankam (überhaupt kein Problem mit der Metro - 20 Minuten von Passeig de Gràcia) war ein Zimmer fertig, der Check-In verlief reibungslos und freundlich. Das Zimmer war keine Überraschung, großzügig und sauber wie ich es bereits aus dem Hilton in Malmö kannte. Der Poolbereich sieht exakt so aus wie auf den Hotelbildern. Ausreichend Liegen vorhanden, nicht überfüllt und hilfsbereite und freundliche Lifeguards, die gleichzeitig für die Ordnung im Bereich sorgen. Cocktails an der Poolbar sind mit 13€ zwar recht teuer, aber was erwartet man von einem 4* Hotel. Man kann sich seine Getränke zur Not ja selbst mitbringen, dagegen hat jedenfalls niemand etwas gesagt. Genau gegenüber des Hotels befindet sich ein großes Einkaufszentrum mit allem was das Herz begehrt. Restaurants, Bekleidungsläden sowie einem riesig großem Supermarkt. Die Gegend ist modern, mit vielen verglasten Hochhäusern, in denen große Firmen ihren Sitz haben. Zum Strand sind es ca. 10 Minuten zu Fuß. Das Meer ist wunderschön, Glasklares Wasser. Ins Zentrum sind es gerade einmal 20 Minuten mit der Metro oder (in Sommermonaten am Besten früh Morgens oder zur Abendzeit) 45 Minuten zu Fuß am Strand entlang. 
Ich würde dieses Hotel immer wieder buchen und werde es auch definitiv tun! Ich kann es nicht erwarten wieder hierher zu kommen, ich war richtig traurig abreisen zu müssen. Einfach nur toll und empfehlenswert.",5,2013,07,19
36,Por trabajo en Barcelona,"Soy consultor,  Voy a BCN entre semana. Excelente hotel, gran desayuno, estupendas habitaciones y sobre todo gran actitud de todo el equipo. Mi hotel cuando voy a BCN y estoy en esta zona sin lugar a dudas.",5,2013,07,16
36,Nicht wieder,"Guter Eindruck von aussen, das Zimmer war alt und das Badezimmer Standard der 80er Jahre, War nur dort weil das Messezentrum gegenüber war. Die Preise an der Bar (1. kleines Bier 6€) waren sehr teuer.",3,2013,07,03
36,Hilton non smentisce,"Bello, moderno, ho soggiornato al 21 esimo piano, vista mozzafiato. Pulitissimo, colazione infinita, servizi e staff a disposizione. Ottima posizione. Di fronte al centro commerciale. Camera provvista di ogni comfort, cioccolatini deliziosi sul cuscino!",5,2013,06,28

36,Im Prinzip gut,"Modernes Hilton, nicht in der City aber akzeptabel erreichbar. Executive Zimmer in oberen Etagen mit tollem Ausblick. Ich Buche gerne Executive da die Lounge zum arbeiten im allgemeinen Tagsüber recht ruhig und gemütlich ist. Bei meinem letzten Aufenthalt musste ich feststellen das man nun am Wochenende nur noch ein paar Stunden früh und gegen Abend auf hat. Das hat mich enttäuscht, dann steht der Aufpreis in keinem Verhältnis mehr und lohnt nicht, zu mal er in Realation zum Gesamtpreis gleich geblieben ist. Ansonsten macht man nichts falsch, nette Terasse, Bar, Restaurant . Verglichen mit deutschen Hotels sind die Hiltons in Spanien teuer, vor allem die Nebenkosten (Bier 8,- Euro ist doppelt so teuer wie in Berlin .. ) ",3,2013,06,26
36,"Modernes Hotel, trotz grosser Entfernung von der Stadt gut erreichbar","Das Hilton Diagonal Mar liegt ziemlich weit ausserhalb der Innenstadt beim Forum, also direkt neben dem riesigen Kongresszentrum. Auf der anderen Strassenseite liegt ein relativ grosses Einkaufszentrum (alle üblichen Marken, aber nichts besonderes) und ein paar preiswerte Restaurants. Das Hotel ist mittels Bus, Tram oder U-Bahn, die nur wenige Gehminuten entfernt ist, aus der Stadt gut erreichbar, ausserdem sind die Taxis in Barcelona wirklich preisgünstig. Ich hatte eine schönes, modernes, grosses Zimmer (Relaxation Room) mit Wanne und Dusche, schöner Blick aufs Meer. Diesmal bin ich nicht in den Genuss eines Executive Zimmers gekommen, diese liegen in den obersten Stockwerken. Da ich im Rahmen eine Kongress-Pauschale dort war kann ich über das Restaurant nur sagen dass das Frühstück sehr reichhaltig und gut ist, allerdings wird das Restaurant bei gutem Belag des Hotels rasch voll. Das Personal ist korrekt, im Restaurant sehr freundlich. Das Hotel ist relativ teuer, halt Hilton mässig. Von den vielen Hilton Hotels die ich in den letzten 2 Monaten besucht habe war ich von diesem am meisten angetan.",4,2013,06,17
36,"Ottima struttura, un po' scomodo per visita alla città","Eccellente il servizio e la prima colazione, ottima la camera (comodissimo il letto), un po' overpriced  bar (16 € un gin tonic) e mini-bar, nel complesso buon rapporto qualità-prezzo (135€ a doppia a  notte con prima colazione faraonica). Poco pratico per visita alla città per quanto prossimo alla metro maresme forum o alla fermata del tram T4 (calcolare una mezz'ora di tragitto solo per rambla o barrio gotico). Aeroporto del prat raggiungibile in una mezz'ora senza traffico con circa 40€. Sicuramente ottimo per chi viaggia per affari, per chi è in visita alla città è da preferirsi zona più centrale.",4,2013,06,10
36,fuga con famiglia,"Hilton è comunque sinonimo di garanzia. E' vero che è un po' decentrato ma con la metro che è a circa 200mt si raggiungono le maggiori attrazioni della città in soli 10 minuti ( la fermata è: maresme-forum L4 gialla). Noi abbiamo preso un taxi dall'aeroporto e abbiamo speso 30 euro in circa mezzora eravamo in hotel. bella struttura , pulita, camere spaziose, ottima colazione, davanti all'hotel c'è un centro commerciale (diagonal) con numerose alternative culinarie, ristoranti tipici, italiani, sushi e naturalmente l'immancabile mc donald.. non abbiamo utilizzato la piscina per mancanza di tempo.. sarà per la prossima volta.",4,2013,06,09
36,fuga con famiglia,"le garanzie Hilton non deludono, camere spaziose, buona pulizia, ottima colazione... un po' distante dal centro ma la fermata della metro (maresme-forum L4 gialla) a circa 200mt vi collega direttamente con le maggiori attrazioni. difronte all'hotel c'è un centro commerciale con i ristoranti con tavoli all'esterno su una bella terrazza ... comodissimo... la scelta Hilton è sempre vincente.",4,2013,06,09
36,Excelente experiencia!,"Es un hotel moderno, nuevo y muy bonito. Está enfrente de un centro comercial y a una cuadra de la playa.  Está lejos del centro de Barcelona pero el sitio vale ka pena por lo tranquilo, abierto y bien ubicado.  Servicio muy bueno, instalaciones impecables, desayuno excelente. ",5,2013,06,08
36,Settimana di lavoro a Barcellona,"stare 5 giorni a Barcellona e non riuscire a visitarne neppure una piccola parte è pessimo..ma lavorando nell'albergo almeno mi sono fatta una buona idea..il mio giudizio sull'albergo è positivo la posizione non è centrale,ma con la metro il centro è facilmente raggiungibile. Il servizio é ottimo,le stanze ampie e luminose..l'unico problema è internet e colazione non compresi nel prezzo..ma si pagano 25€ ognuno..quindi un totale di 50€ in più per stanza.:-(..",4,2013,06,04
36,Nicht akzeptabel,"Ich bin des öfteren in diesem Hotel und auch sehr zufrieden. Jetzt mußte jetzt feststellen, dass die geänderten Öffnungszeiten der Executive Lounge am Wochenende eine Zumutung sind. Bis 10:30 morgens und von 17:00-20:00 Uhr abends! Dies wird dem Gast auch noch generelle Änderung bei Hilton Europa verkauft obwohl ich dies bisher in keinem anderen Hilton mit Lounge in Europa erlebt habe. Gerade im Sommer ist es herrlich auf der Terasse nachmittags einen Kaffee zu trinken und abends den Sonnenuntergang zu erleben. Bisher hatten Hilton Diamond Member zum Frühstück die freie Wahl zwischen Lounge und Restaurant, jetzt werden einem 25€ abverlangt obwohl bei direkter Buchung einer Zimmerrate mit bfst es nur 20€ kostet. Alles andere Stimmt in diesem Hotel, aber diese Änderungen sind nicht hinnehmbar. Also Vorsicht bei Buchung eines Wochenendaufenthalts auf der Executive Etage!",4,2013,06,02
36,Excelente opción si visitas Diagonal Mar,"Buen hotel, a la altura de la cadena Hilton, donde se sabe que se descansa delicioso, con almohadas y colchones fenomenales. 
Buen servicio, y buen desayuno, ya incluído en el precio. 
ideal si se asiste a alguna expo porque está muy cerca del Forum (centro de convenciones), y enfrente de un mall (Diagonal Mar) con muy buenas tiendas y un super. Está muy cerca de la playa, por si deseas ejercitarte corriendo al lado del mar.",5,2013,05,27

di fronte ampio centro commerciale in puro stile USA.",4,2013,05,22
36,Muy bueno,"Hotel de los mejores. El buffet de desayuno genial. La cama y habitación muy confortable con vistas al mar. Por ponerle una pega, el precio de la habitación y del bar. Aunque fui a gastos pagados pero la hamburguesa con patatas que comí no merecía valer 20 euros.",5,2013,05,19
36,Ottimo Soggiorno,"Come in tutti gli Hilton è ottimo soggiornare da loro. Camere confortevoli, vista mare, letti comodi e servizio impeccabile. Noi abbiamo avuto una camera extra al 18° piano. Bagno con vasca e doccia separate: difficili da trovare nei comuni alberghi. La cortesia e la disponibilità dei dipendenti sono stati una forza durante il nostro soggiorno. L'albergo è a due passi dal mare e dalla metropolitana che ti permette di raggiungere tutte le attrazioni di Barcellona. Di fronte è presente un centro commerciale di tre piani ben fornito di ristoranti e ""bar"" per mangiare qualora non si ha voglia di rimanere in albergo.
Ottimo anche il ristorante. Cene a base di pesce fresco ad ottima qualità. Un consiglio? Non chiedete agli spagnoli di cucinarvi una zuppa, essa sarà insipida! Noi italiani abbiamo più ""carattere"" sui sapori!
nel complesso un buon soggiorno!",4,2013,05,17
36,Simplemente para ir a disfrutar...,"La pasé estupendamente bien, el personal muy amable y atento, el hotel se caracteriza por un olor muy agradable que identificas solo al entrar... Cuando salía y volvía a entrar el olor me hacía sentir en casa todo muy limpio y en su lugar, la habitación muy cómoda y agradable. La ubicación frente al centro comercial es genial, simplemente cruzar la calle y ya estás allí. Volvería!",5,2013,04,28
36,Top-Hotel für Barcelona-Besuch,"Chices Hilton-Hotel mit toller, geschmackvoller Ausstattung und internationalem Flair - für uns das perfekte Hotel während unseres Barcelona-Aufenthaltes.

Wir hatten ein Zimmer mit King-Size-Bett und City-Blick im 10. Stock. Zimmer und Bad waren sehr gepflegt & geräumig und mit allen Annehmlichkeiten ausgestattet: bequeme Matratze, großer Flatscreen, Tee & Kaffee Facilities, Wi-Fi, sogar Bügeleisen/-brett etc. Im Bad gab es sowohl eine Badewanne als auch eine Dusche (mit 1A-Duschstrahl!). Die Mitarbeiter am Empfang waren freundlich, professionell und schnell. Sehr gutes Frühstücksbuffet (auch frische Früchte, Iberischen Schinken, Manchego-Käse, live-cooking station für Eiergerichte etc.). Pool und Fitnessbereich sind sehr schön und von der Größe für ein City-Hotel absolut ausreichend. 

Die Lage ist zwar etwas außerhalb des Zentrums aber dennoch gut denn direkt vor dem Hotel halten die Sightseeing-Busse und zur Metro sind es auch nur wenige Gehminuten. 

Wir können das Hotel uneingeschränkt empfehlen und würden es jederzeit wieder buchen.",5,2013,04,22
36,Business hotel senz'anima,Per un congresso e' una buona scelta ma per piacere anche no! Il personale e' molti gentile e preparato ma l'atmosfera e' troppo fredda. Buon cibo senza particolari degni di nota. La posizione favorisce gli amanti del jogging mattutino.,4,2013,04,19
36,"Caro y sin Internet en la habitación pero en general bien, si vas a alguna Feria al Forum, perfecto","El hotel es muy bueno... Habitación, limpieza, la gente... La cama, Mas que perfecta, enorme... El único pero es que no tienen WiFi en las habitaciones y que si no vas a trabajar a alguna feria al Forum, todo te pilla muy lejos... En general, muy buen hotel",5,2013,04,10
36,Classico stile Hilton,"L'albergo è un edificio moderno in classico ""stile Hilton"" con più di 30 piani, le camere sono accoglienti, spaziose e arredate in stile moderno, molto pulite e dotate di comfort basilari quali frigobar, tv (pochi canali italiani), guardaroba capiente con cassaforte e bagno con vasca.
La vista delle camere non è un granchè, pur essendo al 18° piano avevamo un altro edificio con uffici proprio di fronte la vetrata della stanza.
La zona seppur ben collegata alla metro poco distante dall'Hotel che in meno di 10/15 minuti ti porta nei luoghi di maggiore interesse, è un pò isolata... la mattina c'è sempre un via vai di persone in bici, sui pattini o che fanno jogging poichè a 200/300 metri c'è un parco e una spiaggia, ma la sera è frequentato solo il centro commerciale di fronte l'Hotel .

Il pezzo forte dell'Hotel è la colazione !! C'è davvero di tutto e in abbondanza e qualsiasi cosa io abbia assaggiato era davvero gustosissimo !!! Vale davvero la pena la mattina fare rifornimento di energie prima di iniziare la giornata da turisti :) 

Unica nota dolente : alla Reception appena siamo arrivati siamo stati accolti molto freddamente da una dipendente che parlava un Inglese poco comprensibile e, pur pagando subito in contanti la somma prevista per l'intero soggiorno, ci hanno fatto lasciare una ""garanzia"" di 250 euro in vista di eventuali problemi. (Lo abbiamo trovato un bel pò eccessivo..poichè se avessimo pagato con la carta non avrebbero richiesto un centesimo) .

Per quanto riguarda i giorni successivi, abbiamo evitato la dipendente altezzosa e ci siamo fatti aiutare per il nostro tour dai suoi colleghi molto più gentili e disponibili di lei.

Quando scelgo un Hotel valuto sempre 3 parametri fondamentali :
Pulizia ----per questo Hotel 9
Centralità ----per questo Hotel  6.5
Rapporto Qualità/Prezzo ---- per questo Hotel 8 (un voto in più solo per la COLAZIONE) 

Lo consiglio a chi vuole godersi una vacanza di relax in camere pulite e dotate di comfort, e a persone che non hanno problemi di spostamenti ( non è una zona centrale, seppur ben collegata.)",4,2013,04,09
36,buon rapporto qualità prezzo,"camere accoglienti e spaziose, arredate in stile moderno, ben tenute e ottima la pulizia
unico difetto l impianto di riscaldamento difficile da regolare 
a pochi passi dalla fermata della metro Maria Cristina (lontano dal centro...ma ben collegato)",4,2013,03,15
36,muss das sein??,"Im Prinzip ein gutes Hotel. Freundlicher Empfang, nettes sauberes Zimmer, alles Ok bis auf: WLan am Zimmer 25,-- pro Tag, Garage für 4 Tage 108,--, Bier Dose Minibar 8,--
Das muss ja wohl nicht sein!!! Muss dazu sagen das ich diese Annehmlichleiten nicht in Anspruch genommen habe weil ich es als Überhöht empfinde! Parken musste ich am nahe gelegenen (ca. 500Meter) Strandparkplatz. War halt immer läßtig ausladen, rauf aufs Zimmer-runter laufen, Parken fahren, und das ganze in der Früh wieder umgekehrt :-( Macht keinen Spass. 
Essen waren wir auch im Einkaufcenter gegenüber oder ein Stück weiter am Strand.",3,2013,03,11
36,una buona scelta,"Nel complesso buon Hotel, situato in un quartiere tranquillo, anche se molto frequentato e trafficato. Camera accogliente, fin troppo  spaziosa e ben arredata. Posizione fantastica a poche centinaia di metri dal mare, con possibilità di belle passeggiate e di jogging.  Alcune critiche: l' armadio è assai capiente, ma i cassetti sono piccoli e insufficienti. L'insonorizzazione  non è  all'altezza della categoria dell'Hotel; specialmente alla mattina, si sentono i rumori dei vicini di stanza.  Manca il bidet ed i prodotti da bagno sono scarsi. La presa elettrica del bagno non funzionava. La pulizia è buona ma non ottimale.
Ho trovato eccessivo il costo delle bibite e  dell'acqua minerale  del frigo-bar pur considerando  il rango dell'Hotel.",4,2013,03,10
36,Typisch Hilton,"Nettes, einfaches Zimmer. Große Fensterfront, leider nicht öffenbar. Toller Ausblick über Barcelona (Sagrada Familia) und das Meer. Essen okay. Meetingräume wie immer zu stark klimatisiert. Nettes Personal, gutes Lunchpaket.",4,2013,03,06
36,Excelente !,"Estuve en dos oportunidades, con mi esposa e hijos en Septiembre de 2010 y con mi hijo en Octubre del 2012 en ocasion del derby. En nuestra primera visita tuvimos el inconveniente que Iberia no nos entrego nuestro equipaje sino hasta al dia siguiente de nuestra llegada. Han estado fantastico en el hotel ! Se pusieron a nuestra disposicion, nos ofrecieron todo lo que tenian a mano para hacernos sentir mas comodos y se ocuparon del seguimiento del reclamo de equipaje hasta su llegada al hotel de manera meticulosa. Cuando uno esta en una situacion incomoda como esa valora especialmente este calido y personalizado trato. El hotel es moderno, muy bien mantenido, una limpieza ejemplar, ubicado en una zona muy linda de Barcelona (toda la ciudad es hermosa), el desayuno excelente. El servicio del personal en todo el hotel es excelente, muy a disposicion del pasajero con mucho respeto. Felicito al Hilton Diagonal Mar por lograr el servicio de excelencia que brindan y solo esperamos verlos pronto nuevamente para seguir disfrutando del maravilloso Barça y vuestra esplendida ciudad.",5,2013,02,20
36,Geruch,"Leider war in der Lobby, in der Bar und im Restaurant ein so starker Geruch nach etwas süßlichem, chemischem, dass mir übel wurde. Es roch ähnlich wie eine Überdosis WC-Duftspender von Lidl...Deshabl musste ich das Hotel schon nach einer Stunde verlassen.",1,2013,02,16
36,Excelente,"Lo bueno de este hotel es que las fotos de su página web no engañan, es exactamente así. La habitación era exactamente como en las fotos. No hay sorpresas que a uno lo defrauden. Moderno, de buen gusto, excelentes camas, baño impecable, limpieza, cordialidad y eficiencia. Muy buen desayuno buffet. Vistas desde la habitación inmejorables. Frente al hotel hay un gran shopping, pero lo conveniente es estar con auto porque no se encuentra cerca del centro, pero sí de la playa. El parking del hotel es caro, pero frente al hotel se puede dejar el auto sin peligros en la calle porque hay lugar disponible por la noche. No hay wifi free en la habitación lo cual es un punto en contra, sí en el lobby. Volvería y lo recomendaría sin lugar a dudas.",5,2013,02,04
36,"Non ci sono più gli ""Hilton"" di una volta ...","Ho visitato l'albergo durante una convention di lavoro.
L'hotel prende il nome ed é sito nel quartiere Diagonal di Barcellona che é comodo per l'aspetto covention center e centro commerciali annessi ,ma è ben distante dal centro ( comunque i servizi di taxi ed autobus sono ottimi ) . Il mare é molto vicino ( direi 200 metri ) e tutti gli alberghi in zona hanno un ottima vista poichè sono palazzi di 15/25 piani di abbastanza recente costruzione ( periodo dei Giochi Olimpici del 1992) . Ottimo posizione per jogging e sport all'aria aperta ( molto vicino alla porto commerciale )
L'Hilton Diagonal si presenta come una struttura imponente ( vedi foto ) essendo un palazzo di oltre 20 piani ( dal 15 , dove c'è anche un bel lobby bar , in avanti ci sono gli appartamenti e le suites ) 
Al piano primo c'è la zona colazione che presenta un ottimo breakfast ( vedi foto) 
Al secondo zona fitness center e relax ( sauna ) e la piscina esterna che però é aperta solo nel periodo estivo.
Grande delusione però per le camere che non sono all'altezza del buon nome della catena :
- nel bagno manca addirittura lo ""scopìno"" ( vedi foto ) 
- sempre nel bagno alcuno parti di arredo risultano rotte o molto rovinate.
- prodotti da bagno minimi e con scarso assortimento 
- dettagli ed ordine lasciato al caso , scarsa cura generale ( lampadine bruciate , sveglia bloccata, etc ) 
-  pulizia sommaria ( non hanno mai svuotato i cestini in due giorni e mezzo ) e piccoli rifiuti sotto al letto   
Mio voto vs confort camera :
letto/lenzuola/cuscini : discreto 
TVC/internet : pessimo ( TVC vecchia e lentissima nei comandi ) internet a pagamento ad oltre 20 euro al giorno , ed alla lobby è stato bloccato l'internet gratuito per i due giorni della Convention .... Che strano ... Quello a pagamento con addebito funzionava perfettamente ! VERGOGNA !!! ) 
Non consiglio , c'é di meglio in zona.",2,2012,12,01
36,estancia y cena de cumpleaños,"he estado alojado en varias ocasiones, y como siempre un trato exquisito y unas instalaciones espectaculares
coincidio una noche en que haciamos una fiesta de cumple sorpresa a una de nuestras amigas, casualidad en el Hilton Diagonal, aún coincidiendo con otro evento en el mismo hotel, donde habia la verdad un monton de gente, nos ubicaron en un sitio totalmente aislado, en una mesa espectacular, y con un servicio que parecia hecho exclusivamente para nosotros, no hay que opinar sobre la cena ya que parecia que estabamos cenando en casa pero con un menu de  lujo, muchas gracias a la organizacion y todo el personal del restaurante Indigo del hotel, realmente parecia que estabamos en una de nuestras casas celebrando un cumpleaños",4,2012,11,30

36,Tranquillo e confortevole,"C'ero già stata qualche anno fa, trovandomi bene. Ennesimo viaggio di lavoro. Si raggiunge, se non c'è traffico, in circa 20 minuti dall'aeroporto, in taxi. Fuori dai luoghi tipici (ramblas, mercato, case di Gaudì e Sagrada Famiglia), è in una zona moderna e commerciale. A pochi passi un bel parco con anatre nel laghetto, gradevole per una passeggiata nell'intervallo dei lavori cui partecipavo. Un po' oltre il mare, con una lunga passeggiata frequentata da ciclisti ed altri sportivi. Personale della reception mediamente gentile ed efficiente (potrebbero far meglio). Wi-fi gratuito nella Lobby. Buon buffet della colazione e simpatico lunch di lavoro con bicchierini di gazpacho dolce non male. Stanza abbastanza ampia, silenziosa, con bello spazio scrivania, letto comodo. Bagno attrezzato,anche con bidet (per gli italiani una piacevole sorpresa). Niente ciabattine, ma c'era l'idratante corpo, l'accappatoio oltre a shampoo, balsamo e delizioso docciaschiuma agrumato. Ben collegato ed in zona che mi è apparsa sicura, anche se un po' troppo asettica.
Al primo piano oltre alla sala per la colazione le sale riunioni, ben attrezzate e funzionali. Bagni vicino alle sale riunioni tenuti perfettamente puliti. Tornarci non mi dispiacerebbe.",4,2012,11,24
36,Modernes Hotel direkt am Meer,"Wir waren im Frühjahr für zwei Nächte im Hilton. 
Es ist vom Flughafen gut erreichbar per Taxi oder Metro. 
Die Zimmer sind gross, modern und wir hatten aus dem 15. Stock eine tolle Aussicht auf Meer und Strand.
Direkt gegenüber vom Hotel liegt ein großes Einkaufszentrum mit vielen Geschäften, Supermärkten und Restaurants. 
Empfehlenswert sind aber die kleinen Fischrestaurants direkt am Strand in Richtung Porto Olympico.",4,2012,11,15
36,Das ist dann super!,"Nach mehreren Nächten (geschäftlich bedingt) im Hilton Barcelona habe ich noch eine Nacht in diesem schönen Hotel verbracht. Ich wurde empfangen wir ein Fürst, bekam einen Zi.-Upgrade in den Executive Floor und Zugang zur Lounge.

Der Service in Bar und Executive Lounge ist sehr aufmerksam.
Zimmer war sauber und hatte schönen Meerblick.
Das Hotel ist bei Kongressen sehr zu empfehlen, da die Bar dort ein beliebter Treffpunkt für die Teilnehmer ist.
Für reinen Tourismus nicht so sehr geeignet , da etwas weit entfernt vom Zentrum.",4,2012,11,05
36,vicino a tutto !!,"Posizione eccellente, di fronte ad un grande centro commerciale e a pochi metri dalla spiaggia e dalla metropolitana. Personale disponibile e gentile, camera pulita e sufficientemente grande. Un capitolo a parte lo merita il buffet della colazione molto vario, decisamente per una clientela americana.",5,2012,10,14
36,Das erste Mal und das letzte Mal!,"Bin fuer drei Naechte dort gewesen. Silberfische im Bad und dreckige Bettwaesche sind nicht mein Ding. Service ist unterirdisch: dreimal darum gebeten, die Minibar wieder mit Mineralwasser aufzufuellen; Zimmer wurde am ersten Tag erst um 17:00 Uhr ""gereinigt""; zum Fruehstueck wollte ich einen Capucino - zweimal nachgefragt, er stand auf einem anderen Tisch, durfte ihn halbwarm ""geniessen"", abends an der Bar, hat die Bedienung lieber das Telefon bedient und die Nuesse ueber den Tisch gestreut; Am naechsten Tag durfte ich mein Clubsandwich mit dem Kaffee alleine auf die Dachterasse bringen - das gewuenschte Tablett blieb ein Wunsch. Bei mehr als 25 Grad war der Pool natuerlich geschlossen, dafuer hatte die Sauna eine ausreichende Temperatur.
Das Hotel liegt zu weit aus der City und zu nah am Forum. Da es durchaus ueblich ist, dass die abgehaltenen Konzerte im Forum weit nach Mitternacht - in meinem Fall bis 1:30 am morgen - gehen, wuerde man sich eine bessere Daemmung - gerne auch mittels dicken Gardienen - wie ich es tags zuvor in Grange Hotel in London (Aldgate) erlebt habe - wuenschen. Ich war dieses Jahr bereits das dritte mal in Barcelona und werde sicherlich noch oefter da sein, aber bestimmt nicht mehr in diesem Hotel!",2,2012,10,07
36,Una delusione,"Il personale della reception lento e per nulla professionale (1 ora di attesa per il check-in).
 Mi è stato addebitato l'importo del soggiorno sulla carta di credito, nonostante avessi pagato cash. 
La mia banca mi ha notificato immediatamente la transazione. Ho chiesto spiegazioni e l'impiegata insisteva dicendo che non aveva addebitato nulla sulla mia carta. Ho fatto notare che il messaggio era chiarissimo e che la transazione (da me non autorizzata) era stata effettuata. Per farla breve ho dovuto aspettare una settimana per l'annullamento della transazione. 
Le camere sporche (muri con insetti spiaccicati, caccole attaccate ai mobili, vetri sporchissimi...) -allego foto-
Ne ho cambiate due; appena preso possesso della camera ho notato: chaise longue bruciata da sigaretta, caccola attaccata al frigo (sporco!) mobili usurati...speravo che, cambiando camera.....no, pensavo male. 
Caccola a parte (della prima camera), la seconda era una king ""vista mare""; vista, che era oscurata dai vetri sordidi e perchè difronte a due condomìni. -allego foto- 
La seconda camera era identica alla prima...mobili usurati e rigati dall'incuria, sporchi, insetti spiaccicati sulle pareti; non potevo credere ai miei occhi! -allega foto- 
Solitamente lo standard dell'Hilton è eccellente.
Insonorizzazione camere inesistente; sentivo perfettamente il russare del mio vicino di camera durante la notte.
Prima colazione in camera hanno dimenticato di portare posate e cioccolata calda. Il brick del latte sporco con incrostazioni gialle. Disgustoso! -allego foto- Tazze sbeccate -allego foto-
Il filtro del bollitore sporco. Una cosa vomitevole che ho scoperto per caso, notando che nella tazza, l'acqua calda aveva qualche intrusione.....-allego foto-

Servizio concierge: ho chiamato per avere una limousine, non sono stato richiamato in 2 minuti come promesso; dopo 2 ore di attesa e 3 telefonate, mi sono dovuto recare alla reception per essere atteso! Dove un impiegato (vista la mia cortese furia), ha risolto il problema in 10 minuti. Che Dio lo benedica!
Pasticcini e brioches sono deliziosi degni delle 5 stelle dell' Hilton.
Se la direzione ha intenzione di porgere le sue scuse; si risparmi la fatica. Le scuse non risolvono i disagi subiti.
Non mi è consentito pubblicare più di tre foto. Sono disponibile ad inviare le altre a chiunque volesse prenderne visione.",1,2012,09,14
36,DECENTRATO MA TRANQUILLO E VICINO ALLA SPIAGGIA,"Ero molto indeciso sul voto complessivo da dare perchè ho purtroppo riscontrato alcune pecche in questa struttura che però, nel complesso, è molto buona. La posizione è alquanto decentrata rispetto al centro, ma per me questo non ha rappresentato un problema, anzi, ho trovato il quartiere molto tranquillo, piacevole, sicuro e a pochi metri da una spiaggia incredibilmente bella per essere la spiaggia di una metropoli. Le operazioni di check in ed out sono state molto professionali e veloci ma molto ""fredde"": capisco che un'albergo di queste dimensioni non possa riservare una accoglienza personalizzata a tutti gli ospiti, ma a volte basterebbe un sorriso o qualche parola tipo ""fatto un buon viaggio"" oppure ""le auguro un buon rientro"" per lasciare un ricordo più piacevole del front desk. La mia camera era al 18° piano e il mio giudizio complessivo è stato molto positivo sopratutto per la magnifica vista sul mare: unici piccoli difetti: ricezione dei canali tv  non proprio perfetta, arredamento un po' datato (armadio con preoccupanti cigolii) e una pulizia generale migliorabile ma comunque buona. Ottima la zona della piscina ma con un acqua incredibilmente fredda. Colazione molto completa e buona. Nel complesso giudizio positivo.",4,2012,09,04
36,Vista Espectacular,"nos hospedamos en el hotel por la cercanía que tiene al salón de convenciones vecino.  El hotel es muy grande, y la vista desde el piso 23 es fantástica.  Tuvimos la suerte de tener vista al mar, y realmente es fantástica, se ven competencias de regatas, etc.
El salón de desayuno en el nivel 15 es fantástico, a pesar de no ser muy grande, se aprovecha la vista al máximo.  
cuando llegamos nos habían asignado una habitación que a pesar de no ser de fumadores, tenía olor a cigarrillo, pero muy amablemente nos dieron otra, sólo un pequeño tiempo de espera, lastimosamente no nos dieron cama grande, sino 2 individuales.  Además el pasador de la puerta y la báscula no funcionaban.
el personal super atento, definitivamente dignos de un hotel 5 estrellas.",5,2012,08,13
36,Impresionante.....y el restaurante tambien,"Me aloje en la planta 22. Que gozada de vistas, que buena decoracion, que buena situacion....:..vaya hotelazo...y encima el menu del restaurante es excelente...No os perdais el restaurante ya que tiene menus muy bien de precio y de nivel",5,2012,07,31
36,Business Hotel in Strandlage,"War das zweite Mal in diesem Hilton. Es ist leider nicht so zentral gelegen, aber dafür direkt am Strand. Das Hotel ist normaler Hilton Standard. Geärgert hat mich dieses Mal, dass trotz Verfügbarkeit kein Upgrade gegeben wurde und dass das Frühstück für Diamonds auf dem Zimmer nicht inklusive ist!!!! Beim Check In musste ich leider auch über 30 Minuten warten, obwohl es eigentlich total leer und spät am Abend war. Service im Restaurant war sehr gut. 
Zimmer leider etwas klein.",4,2012,07,24
36,Colazione strepitosa,"Ero già stata a Barcellona ed avevo prenotato un hotel vicino a Playa Catalogna ma devo dire che La Ramblas mi ha sconvolta, ambiente squallido sporco e frequentato da delinquenti.
Sono tornata ed ho prenotato in questo hotel che si trova vicino al mare e con il taxi con unamedia di 5 euro puoi raggiungere qualsiasi località turistica e non.
L'hotel è pulito stanze ampie colazione veramente ottima.
Personale professionale e distaccato ma non mi aspettavo che in un hotel così grande fossero diversi.
Penso che se tornerò a Barcellona soggiornerò nuovamente lì.",5,2012,07,17
36,Strandnähe,"Das Hilton eignet sich außer für Geschäftsreisende für alle, die nicht nur die Stadt besuchen sondern auch den einen oder anderen Tag am Strand verbringen möchten, da dieser nur 5 Minuten Fußweg entfernt ist. In die Stadt kostet es mit dem Taxi 10 Euro, die UBahn ist auch nur ein paar Minuten entfernt.
Das Hotel selbst ist ein uncharmantes, kühles Business-Hotel, aber das Personal ist durchwegs freundlich und sehr aufmerksam. Pool und Fitneßraum sind in Ordnung, leider ist die Freiluft- Poolbar, in der man rauchen kann, abends geschlossen. Das Restaurant haben wir nicht besucht, da an unserem Ankunftsabend nur einige einsame Geschäftsleute herumsaßen und die Lokale auf der großen Terrasse des gegenübergelegenen Shoppingcenters noch geöffnet waren. Dort haben wir drei durchaus empfehlenswerte Restaurants ausgemacht, das beste unter ihnen war ein baskisches. Da wir meist sehr spät aufgestanden sind, haben wir immer dort Tapas gefrühstückt oder gleich warm zu Mittag gegessen. War auf jeden Fall billiger,schöner (und vermutlich sogar besser) als im Hotel.",4,2012,06,15
36,Solide Wahl an der Promenade,"Eigentlich gibt es nicht Negatives zu diesem Hotel zu sagen. Man bekommt was man erwartet. Praktische Lage, solide 4 Sterne Zimmer, Einrichtungen und Facilities wie erwartet. Service und Sauberkeit ebenso Top. Als Gold bekommt man ein Upgrade in ein Executive Zimmer. Sehr angenehm, die Lounge selber ist OKAY, aber nichts Besonderes.
Mein Problem ist lediglich dass man gerade in Barcelona viel günstiger in ein kleines Boutique Hotel unterkommen kann. Oft moderner, und vorallem authentischer als im Hilton.",4,2012,04,13
36,Gran hotel muy lejos del centro de Barcelona,"Magnífico edificio situado junto al Centro Internacional de Convenciones de Barcelona y a otros grandes hoteles, junto al mar y muy lejos del centro de la ciudad. Justo enfrente hay un centro comercial enorme y muy completo. El personal atentísimo. La habitación buena, en la planta 22, con unas vistas extraordinarias al mar. Habitación grande, cómoda, bien decorada y amueblada. Lamentablemente el wifi no es gratis. El desayuno bueno. Es un hotel ideal para congresos que se celebren en el CICB. Por ponerle inconvenientes, la bañera estaba desconchada y el televisor no se veía el canal nacional Teledeporte, un desastre para los que seguimos por ejemplo, el baloncesto.",4,2012,03,05
36,Hotel di lusso nella zona nuova di Barcellona,"Cercando un hotel a Barcellona vicino alla spiaggia ma comunque non troppo distante dal centro ho trovato una buona occasione all'Hilton Diagonal Mar, L'hotel è nella zona chiamata proprio Diagonal Mar (vicino al Forum dove è stato fatto qualche anno fa) e gli edifici sono tutti appena costruiti, ci sono diversi hotel di altre catene. L'hotel dispone di una piscina che col caldo torrido dell'estate è più che opportuna e comunque è a non più di 5 minuti a piedi dalla spiaggia. Le camere ai piani più alti godono di una splendida vista su Barcellona, compresa la Sagrada Familia.",5,2012,01,23
36,una certezza,"Avendo a disposizione per il progetto un budget per una volta non striminzito ho scelto di finire bene l'anno e sono andato sul sicuro.
La posizione dal luogo di lavoro è buona, mentre rispetto al centro della città è un po' decentrato: c'è però la metro vicina, oltre al mare e poi l'hilton è hilton...
L'albergo è moderno, con le tariffe online è anche non eccessivamente costoso (110 con la colazione) se si trova la data giusta. 
La camera spaziosa e funzionale per le esigenze di business e, soprattutto, pulito; è sempre fastidioso dover pagare a parte per il collegamento internet (salvo i casi di frequent traveller, in cui è incluso) ed è l'unica pecca (non esclusiva) di questa catena.
La colazione è davvero continentale e molto varia, sufficiente ad accontentare qualsiasi preferenza, dolce o salata. 
Per me poi è l'ideale, dopo la palestra del mattino. 
La gym è buona, non eccezionale, ma comunque con l'attrezzatura necessaria per chi è spesso fuori casa per lavoro e deve fare i conti coi ristoranti e i sensi di colpa :-)
A gennaio ci devo tornare e già mi sembra un buon modo per cominciare l'anno",4,2012,01,09
36,ottimo hotel....,"hotel spettacolare....curato nei minimi particolari....con camere spaziose , luminose e confortevoli!!!ottima anche la colazione con una grande scelta...sia di salato che dolce...con un buon caffe' expresso....
naturalmente risulta un pò fuori dal centro della città ma collegato benissimo con la metro...
da consigliare per una vacanza di coppia!!",5,2011,11,26
36,"Guter Hilton Standard, keine Überraschungen","Ich habe zwei Nächte im Hilton Diagonal Mar verbracht. Das Hotel ist sehr groß und entspricht voll und ganz dem gewohnt guten Hilton Standard. Besonders hervorheben möchte ich, dass in meinem Zimmer kein Teppichboden sondern Laminat verlegt war. Ich finde das sehr angenehm und hygienisch. Das Zimmer war schön groß mit einem Tollen Ausblick auf das Meer. Den Pool konnte ich leider wegen des schlechten Wetters nicht nutzen. Der Service ist sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend. Über das reguläre Frühstück kann ich leider nichts sagen, da es für unsere Gruppe ein separates Buffet gab.
Fazit: Guter Hilton Standard ohne Überraschungen.",4,2011,11,25
36,Hilton @Barcellona,"Sono stato presso l'hotel Hilton Barcelona (sulla av Diagonal) per un breve week end di coppia.,
La struttura, sebbene decentrata, è molto ben collegata ed offre una buona soluzione (considerati i prezzi della città).
Suggerisco di fare una prenotazione B&B perchè diversamente i prezzi della colazione sono un pò alti.",4,2011,11,14
36,"albergo bello ,ma lontano dal centro","l'albergo si trova in una struttura molto moderna e funzionale di fronte ad un affollato centro commerciale (per la verita' di basso livello), ma distante dal centro turistico della citta' ( per la verita' i taxi costano poco  e ci impiegan circa 15 min).
le stanze sono belle ,spaziose e funzionali ,servire da 4 ascensori veloci.
La parte wellness è veramente molto sacrificata (al mio arrivo la sauna era spenta e necessitava di 15 min per l'avviamento) palestra dotata di tutti gli attrezzi base ,ma ugualmente piccola.
il turista puo' sicuramente trovare alloggi piu' adatti alle proprie esigenze.",3,2011,11,13
36,Excelente Hotel,Recientemente hemos estado alojados 2 dias en este hotel por segunda vez este año y una vez mas el servicio y la atencion del personal ha sido de primera calidad. La habitacion en el piso 18 gozaba de unas vistas al mar impresionantes. El hotel se encuentra en una zona fantastica con un centro comercial estupendo justo en frente y tan solo 10 minutos de Plaza Cataluña en autobus lo cual es un privilegio.,5,2011,10,16
36,Upgrade in die Präsidentensuite - auch nicht schlecht!,"Das Hotel war ausgebucht, als ich ankam. Da ich HHonors Mitglied bin, haben sie mich dann ""overgraded"": In die Präsidentensuite. Die ist 135 qm groß und hat einen fantastischen Ausblick auf Strand und Meer. Obwohl die Suite ohne Zweifel ein Erlebnis ist, war ich doch überrascht festzustellen, dass die Duschen knapp bemessen sind, so dass eine übergewichtige Person sicher Probleme haben wird, zurecht zu kommen. Dafür war der Whirlpool natürlich überdimensional. Habe versucht, mein Video hochzuladen, funktioniert aber wegen der 68 Mb nicht. Tolles Bett, absolut ruhig, sehr geräumig, eigene Küche. Nur der Aufzug braucht mehrere Minuten vom 23. Stock nach unten, wenn 10 Leute zwischendurch einsteigen. Das kann nervig sein.",5,2011,10,15
36,todo perfecto,"La unica crítica es el precio diario de acceso a wi fi: 27 € día.
Considero que si hoteles mucho más económicos tienen acceso gratuito, con más razón la cadena Hilton debería tenerlo",4,2011,10,03
36,Einfach toll,"Freundlicher Check-in, habe ein Eckzimmer bekommen. Badezimmer mit Dusche und Badewanne. Von der Badewanne hat man einen herrlichen Blick auf's Meer. Zimmer sehr geräumig und freundlich. Personal bis auf eine Dame an der Rezeption, die ich um Hilfe gebeten habe, da ich den Druckauftrag der Bordkarte nicht ansteuern konnte, alle recht freundlich. Zum Frühstück kann ich nichts sagen, da ich in der Executive Lounge gefrühstückt habe mit herrlichem Blick auf's Meer beim Sonnenaufagng. Zum Meer sind es ca. 5 Minuten Fußweg, der sich praktisch bis zum anderen Ende Barcelonas zieht. Mit öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln ist man auch schnell an jedem Ende der Stadt. Pool nur im Außenbereich geöffnet von April bis September, hatte aber jetzt am 1. Oktoberwochenende geöffnet.",5,2011,10,03
36,Buon hotel ma personale scortesissimo e non al livello del nome,"Arriviamo verso le 23:30 all'hotel e facciamo il check in,tutto bene la ragazza molto gentile,chiedo se è possibile mettere la sveglia alle 9.00 più di una volta,e lei mi dice che non c'era nessun problema.Al mattino seguento non ci hanno svegliato,sono sceso per le spiegazioni e nessuno mi ha saputo rispondere e cosa ancor più grave neanche si sono scusati.Purtroppo ho perso il volo e ho dovuto pagare per il cambio d'orario.....
Dopo di ciò sono salito in camera e ho dovuto rifare la scheda per entrarci,per la 4 volta,
Sono sceso con le valigie per fare il check out nonostante fossi in ritardo e che non mi hanno svegliato a tempo,mi hanno risposto scortesemente dicendomi che devo fare la fila,premetto dopo tutto l'ho chiesto anche gentilmente se potevano farmi fare il check out prima degli altri.Ho chiesto di un responsabile e nessuno mi ha risposto,ho dovuto chiedere al portiere se c'era qualcuno con cui si poteva parlare,ma anche lui mi ha detto che non c'era nessuno,quando ho visto il direttore operativo...beh essendo della hilton io non ho mai visto un tale trattamento per un cliente..davvero penoso!
Flavia",2,2011,09,19
36,Non male..,"Hotel vicino al mare ma lontano dal centro! L'albergo è bello, le camere sono spaziose e molto luminose, la colazione è discreta (anche se il caffè, per un italiano, è tremendo), ma bisogna fare diversi cambi di metropolitana per arrivare a vedere le principali attrazioni della città (circa 30 minuti solo andata). Non ho gradito il comportamento dell'addetto alla reception al mio arrivo (poco dopo mezzogiorno): ho dovuto aspettare quasi due ore per entrare in stanza, in quanto non era ancora pronta.. L'hotel è molto grande e non credo non ci fossero altre camere già disponibili, il receptionist non ha affatto tenuto conto del mio status di hhonors, che, al momento del check-in, corrispondeva a silver e che, durante il soggiorno, è diventato gold!",3,2011,08,30
36,Lusso ma senz'anima,"L'occasione è un addio al celibato di un amico. Hilton Diagonal è sicuramente di lusso , perfetto , impeccabile , completo. La location  vicino al mare, gli spazi esterni sono ampi  ma  la zona è un po' spoglia di verde. All'interno è ...Hilton . Le camere sono ampie, ben arredate, con ampie vetrate e tutti i confort. C'è la piscina esterna, la saletta apertivi con internet point all'ultimo piano... Peccato che in tutto questa perfezione manchi ...l' ANIMA e ci si senta un po' in un'ambiente ""sterilizzato"".  Altra nota negativa il fatto che i servizi sono molto cari e che la colazione (20 euro!) non sia compresa nel prezzo della camera.",4,2011,08,20
36,Moderner Hotelturm mit toller Aussicht,"Für unsere Miniferien in Barcelona wählten wir das Hilton Diagonal Mar, das neuere der beiden Hiltons in Barcelona. Das Hotel aus dem Jahr 2004 befindet sich in der Nähe des Strandes, nicht aber im Historischen Stadtzentrum. Da Barcelona hervorragende öffentliche Verkehrsmittel hat, welche zudem sehr preiswert sind, ist man mit dem Bus oder der Metro sofort im Zentrum. 

Das Hotel ist modern eingerichtet, groszügig und hat fast schon Badeferien-Qualitäten. Alles ist sehr sauber und gepflegt. Unser Zimmer hatte eine tolle Aussicht aufs Meer. Die Klimaanlage arbeitet sehr leise und effizient. Einziger Mangel war, dass die Duschbrause nicht funktionierte.

Riesiges Plus ist die Executive Lounge für Hilton Gold Member, wo man sich jederzeit ein Mineral oder ein Bier gönnen kann, die Lounge hat einen windigen Balkon mit einer
wunderbaren Aussicht. Nachmittags kann man sich am Torten Buffet bedienen, am Abend werden Snacks serviert. 

Das Frühstücksbuffet im Restaurant Indigo lässt keine Wünsche offen, der Kaffee ist toll
und die Bedienung sehr freundlich. Grundsätzlich hat das Hotel sehr freundliches Personal.

Wer also kein Problem damit hat, dass das Hotel nicht im Zentrum ist, dem kann ich das Hotel wärmstens empfehlen!",5,2011,08,02
36,Ottimo ma non centrale,"Hotel con standard elevato. 
Dispone di tutto ciò che ci si può aspettare durante una breve vacanza. 
Ottima la prima colazione con un buffet vastissimo e fornitissimo. 
L'unico aspetto negativo per chi ama muoversi a piedi è la distanza dal centro città (l'hotel è sul lungomare) che si può raggiungere in taxi o con un servizio di Autobus (peraltro comodissimo di fronte all'hotel).",5,2011,07,29
36,Geschäftshotel am Meer in Barcelona,"Dieses einladende Hotel der Hilton Gruppe ist modern und liegt direkt am Meer. Es ist vom Flughafen in 30 Minuten zu erreichen.  Zentrale Lage auch zum Zentrum von Barcelona mit den vielen Sehenswürdigkeiten. Ein Taxistand ist direkt vor dem Hotel. Parkmöglichkeiten sind reichlich im Parkhaus oder auch auf der Straße vor dem Hotel verfügbar.
Sixt Autovermietung ermöglicht einfaches Anmieten von Mietwagen und Rückgabe und befindet sich im Hotel. Fahrtkosten mit dem Taxi zum Flughafen ca 35 Euro.
Das Hotel ist ruhig gelegen und bietet auch für nicht Geschäftsreisende viele Möglichkeiten. Stadtrundfahrten beginnen unmittelbar beim Hotel. Ein großes Einkaufszentrum ist ebenfalls gegenüber dem Hilton Hotel.",5,2011,07,24
36,lo consiglio,"Ottimo hotel, buona la pulizia e la colazione. Decentrato ma comunque molto ben collegato con il centro tramite mezzi di servizio pubbluico. Prezzi elevati per quanto riguarda il minibar in camera, il bar dell'hotel e i ristoranti, il servizio comunque è soddisfacente ed è ottima la qualita' dei prodotti. Ottime le offerte per soggiorni prepagati (almento 14 giorni prima) e con permanenza di tre notti (-40% dal listino ufficiale), collegandosi al sito ufficiale hilton.com",4,2011,07,21
36,Consigliatissimo!,"Hotel megagalattico. Moderno. Pulito. Hall enorme e ricercatissima. Ristorante e bar all'interno. Camera grande, spaziosa e con un buon arredamento. Bagno con doccia e vasca. Ottimo incontro qualita - prezzo. Ho trascorso il capodanno e prenotando qualche mese prima ho usufruito di 3 nts al prezzo di 2. Le finestre della stanza non possono aprirsi per questioni di sicurezza, in quanto ci sono stanze a piani molto alti. Davanti l'hotel c'è un grande centro commerciale con parecchi ristoranti e 1 fast food (McDonald's). Vicinissimo al mare. Stazione Selva del Mar (linea 4) a 5/10 min a piedi o fermata dei bus sotto l'Hotel. Non in centro, ma comunque facilmente raggiungibile.  Dall'aeroporto si prende l'autobus che raggiunge il centro oppure in taxi sono 45€. Hotel consigliatissimo!!!",5,2011,06,19
36,Verguenza por cobrar internet,"Es una autentica verguenza que a dia de hoy se paga en un hotel por conectarse a Internet, quede en el hall con una persona para trabajar y tuvimos que pagar 12 € por una hora de navegación (recuerdo que la tarifa de internet del area wifi es la misma independientemente de las conexions).
Fue tan bochornoso que curse una reclamación, una cosa como esta desprestigia totalmente la categoria del hotel.",2,2011,05,17
36,Noche Romántica,"El pasado 11 de Febrero, quise sorprender a mi pareja, regalándole una noche romántica en el Hotel Hilton Diagonal Mar. Las vistas de la habitación en la planta 23 eran espectaculares, el servicio maravilloso. Nos prepararon un baño con rosas y nos dejaron una botella de champagne bien, con fresitas.
Fue una velada inolvidable.",5,2011,02,25
36,Gutes Hotel mit tollen Blick,"Das Hilton Hotel liegt ca. 20 Minuten vom Flughafen entfernt direkt am Meer. Von meinem Zimmer in einem der oberen Stockwerke hatte ich einen herrlichen Blick auf das Meer, besonders die Sonnenaufgängen waren traumhaft. Ansonsten gibt es zwar eine Marina in der Nähe des Hotels, einen richtigen Strand habe ich aber nicht erblickt. Das Hotel selbst ist in einem sehr guten Zustand, Zimmer und Öffentliche Bereiche sind gepflegt. Das Zimmer war geräumig, modern und sauber. Einziges Manko waren die beiden Queen Size Betten, die auf Rollen standen, die nicht fixiert werden könnten. Das hat den Schlaf etwas gestört. 
Ansonsten war das Frühstücksbüffet im Hilton Standard gewohnt vielseitig, der Service sehr freundlich.",5,2010,12,18
36,Für ein Hilton ist es nicht gut genug,"Etliche Mängel bei Ankunft... Bett hatte einen gebrochenen Fuß, Klimaanlage hat nicht funktioniert (dh die Heizung ließ sich nicht abstellen, es war sehr heiß im Raum), Fernbedienung hat nicht funktioniert, Badewanne war nicht sauber etc. Erst nach mehrmaliger Aufforderung wurden die gröbsten Mängel am nächsten Tag behoben (musste die erste Nacht in einem anderen Zimmer schlafen), auch die Entschuldigung des Managements liess auf sich warten. 
Beim Frühstück kaum vorhandener Service- mussten auf Tee und Eier lange warten, bzw mehrmals nachfragen bis sie kamen. Bei eur 24.50 fürs Frühstück mehr als ärgerlich. 
Internet kostet extra.",3,2010,12,13
36,Excelente hotel,"Grande sorpresa conocer este hotel. Instalaciones modernas, amplias, limpias, de primera. La alberca es espectacular, con maravillosas vistas de la ciudad. Cuenta con estacionamiento techado iluminado y con vigilancia, muy confiable. El lobby es agradable aunque algo serio, algo desangelado, no con el ambiente que tiene un hotel Hilton, pero es muy lujoso y hace que el huesped se sienta bien. El servicio de front desk y ama de llaves es de lo mejor. Las habitaciones tienen buenas vistas del mar o de la ciudad y cuentan con todo tipo de ameneidades para sentirte a gusto durante tu estancia. El hotel esta lejano al centro historico de la ciudad pero tiene vias rapidas de transporte y creo que es un plus que no este entre tanto bullucio. Frente al hotel esta el centro comercial DIAGONAL DEL MAR que cuenta con todo tipo de restaurantes, bares, tiendas, farmacias, etc, En frente pasa el bus turistico de Barcelona y hace parada aqui, asi que es excelente tomar el tour aqui mismo en la puerta de tu hotel.",5,2010,11,15
36,"Gutes Hotel, gutes Hilton","Das Hotel liegt nich in der City sondern fast direkt am Strand. Die Preise erscheinen mir etwas hoch. Allerdings wurden wie in ein Executive Room upgegraded (Hhonors Gold Vip) mit dem auch ein kostenloses, sehr gutes, Frühstück einher ging. Der Strandabschnitt ist ziemlich schön, die Verbindung in die Stadt passabel. Möchte man mehr am Strand sein als in der Stadt zu empfehlen, trotz hohen Preisen.",4,2010,11,09
36,Comodidad en cada rincón,"Me alojé en este hotel una noche por motivos de trabajo y me hubiera gustado quedarme más. El personal es muy atento, incluso antes de bajarte del taxi ya vienen dispuestos a ayudarte. Y cuando entras en recepción ya te das cuenta de que es un lugar donde todo está pensado al detalle, sencillez y elegancia conviven en armonía. La habitación que escogí tenía vistas al mar, pero también se puede elegir una con vistas a la ciudad de Barcelona. Grandes ventanales iluminan la habitación, y el baño también tiene luz natural. Y lo mejor de todo: la cama. Desde el tacto de las sábanas hasta el albornoz, todo está perfectamente cuidado y pensado para un descanso agradable. Por la mañana, el desayuno muy completo. La verdad es que la única pega que se le puede sacar es el precio que es bastante elevado.",4,2010,10,31
36,Sehr gutes Hotel für Tagungen,"Das Hilton Diagonal Mar liegt in einem eher neueren Bezirk etwas außerhalb der Stadt. Mit der Metro gelangt man jedoch leicht in  die Innenstadt. Das Service ist hervorragend. Die Zimmer sind groß und gemütlich. Das Bad ist sehr geräumig. Das WC ist etwas abgetrennt. W-Lan muss man leider bezahlen. Leider weiß ich nicht mehr, wieviel es gekostet hat, aber es war teuer. 
Es gibt weiters ein Schwimmbad und ein Fitnesscenter (beides nicht ausprobiert).
Gegenüber des Hotels ist ein großes Einkaufszentrum mit einigen billigen Restaurants (falls einem das Hotel-Restaurant zu teuer sein sollte).

Ich war wegen eines Meetings in dem Hotel und dafür eignet es sich bestens.",5,2010,10,26
36,Weit ab vom Schuss aber dicht am Meer,"Schoenes Hotel mit perfektem Blick aufs Mittelmeer, es sei denn man erwischt ein Zimmer zur Stadt, dann blickt man auf ein vermeintlich modernes Einkaufs- und Vergnuegungscenter. Tram-Anschluss zur Stadtmitte vorhanden, es dauert aber lange, bis man dort ankommt. Das Hotel liegt im Suedosten der Stadt - weit ab von down town. Fruehstuecksbuffet ist fuer spanische Verhaeltnisse bestens. An der Rezeption wurde mir bei der Abreise eingeredet, ich haette fuer 36 EUR Getraenke aus der Minibar entnommen, was nicht stimmte, ich hatte nicht mal die Tuer vom Kuehlschrank angefasst. Der Rezeptionist stritt sich bis aufs Messer. Ob das Methode hat, keine Ahnung, es truebte jedenfalls meinen bis dahin guten Gesamteindruck.",3,2010,10,10
36,Viele Entschuldigungen machen es auch nicht besser,"Diese Hotel hat keinen Hilton Standard. Meine Entscheidung für dieses Hotel war unter anderem auch durch das Vorhandensein einer Sauna begründet. Genau diese konnte ich jedoch nicht nutzen. Sie war wohl kaputt. Immer wurde ich auf den nächsten Tag vertröstet. Immer wieder wurde mir dann gesagt, daß sie wieder funktioniert. Immer wieder war sie jedoch immer noch defekt. Es schien niemand zu interessieren. Beim Checkout brachte ich meine Unzufriedenheit nochmals zum Ausdruck. Man entschuldigte sich zwar wie jeden Tag, aber es interessierte immer noch niemand. Ich bin sicher sie ist auch 2 Wochen später immer noch defekt. Das einzig Gute am Hotel ist die hervoragende Aussicht und das gegenüberliegende Shopping Center. Das hat aber nichts mit dem Personal zu tun. Übrigens nach meiner Rückkehr bekam ich eine E-Mail vom Hotel in der man mir sagte, das man hofft ich wäre zufrieden gewesen. Diese Standard Mail zeigt mir jedoch nur nochmals das Desinteresse der Hotelführung.
Zwar muß man wohl in Spanien mit so einem Verhalten rechnen. Aber nicht für teures Geld in einem HILTON.",2,2010,10,02
36,"Generell ok, etwas teuer.","Lage ist nicht sehr gut da nicht zentral. Generell ein angenehmes Hotel, Preis/Leistung stimmt nicht ganz. Vor allem das Essen und Drinks an der Bar sind sehr teuer. Gym ist für so ein grosses Hotel zu klein. Frühstück ist gut. Personal und Zimmerservice sind gut. Obwohl Metrostation in der Nähe ist, benötigt man ca 30-40min ins Zentrum.",3,2010,09,08
36,"Hotel di alto livello, all'altezza della catena a cui appartiene","L'incipit della vacanza non è stato dei migliori: ""Non abbiamo più camere standard, ci dispiace"" seguito poi da ""Mi dispiace, vi daremo una executive suite"".
Camera stupenda di 70mq con accesso al lounge bar gratuito per tutto il giorno.
La struttura si dimostra all'altezza del nome Hilton sia per la qualità della stanza (una sala riunioni e due Lcd in camera), sia per la pulizia (2 volte al giorno), sia per la location (a 2 min dalla metro, di fronte ad un centro commerciale molto fornito e a due passi dalla spiaggia).
Personale ""dietro al bancone"" (barman, receptionist ecc.) molto cortese, personale attivo (inservienti, addetti alle pulizie ecc.) molto meno.
Prezzi altissimi per qualsiasi cosa non sia compreso nel ""pacchetto"" acquistato, ma con un centro commerciale e una ventina di ristoranti di tutte le categorie tra i quali scegliere non ci si può lamentare.
Hotel consigliatissimo come base per la propria visita a Barcellona.",5,2010,09,07
36,Kurzreise,"Wir waren zu einem 1-wöchigen Städte-Trip in Barcelona und waren mit dem Hotel prinzipiell sehr zufrieden. Der Service, die Reinigung sowie Lage und Ausstattung waren sehr gut, auch wenn die Organisation des Frühstück-Buffets teilweise den Ansturm der Hotelgäste nur bedingt meistern konnte. Das naheliegende Diagonal Mar Center ist empfehlenswert, ebenso der Stadtstrand.",4,2010,08,29
36,Fast wie Strandferien,"Nach einer Nacht im Hilton Barcelona beendete ich meinem Städtetrip mit einer Aufenthalt im Hilton Diagonal. Dieses Hotel fand ich noch einmal eine Klasse besser. Obwohl nicht zentral gelegen, ist die Anreise mit der U-Bahn kein Problem. Empfang war sehr freundlich. Absoluter Oberhammer die Business Lounge mit Terrasse und Aussicht auf Stadt und Meer. Zimmer auf der Executive Etage geräumig, top sauber und mit schöner Aussicht. Im ersten Stock hat es einen mittelgrossen Pool mit Bar, welcher Strandgefühl vermittelt. Dieser wäre dann auch nicht weit weg, ca. 8 Minuten. Alles in allem eine wirklich schöne Kombination zwischen Stadt/Business-Hotel und Ferien-Feeling.",5,2010,08,12
36,Direkte Nähe zum Kongresszentrum,"Das Hilton Diagonal Mar liegt etwas außerhalb der Innenstadt in direkter Nähe zum Kongresszentrum. Die Lobby und die Zimmer sind sehr modern eingerichtet und bieten viel Platz. Direkt gegenüber des Hotels kann man ein Einkaufszentrum besuchen mit vielen Geschäften und Restaurants. Besonders erwähnenswert ist der Fitnessraum und der Außenpool, von dem man einen tollen Blick auf die Stadt genießen kann. Wenn man doch mal in die Innenstadt möchte, geht das mit den öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln problemlos in wenigen Minuten. Das Personal war sehr nett und hilfsbereit. Ich komme gerne wieder.",4,2010,08,11
36,Modernes Luxushotel,"Das Hotel liegt zwar etwas abseits der Innenstadt, trotzdem ist es mit der U-Bahn oder anderen öffenlichen Verkehrsmitteln sehr gut zu erriechen. Der Strand ist ist unmittelbarer nähe zum Hotel. 
Der Ausblick aus den oberen Etagen über die Stadt ist traumhaft. Der Service is sehr gut, auch wenn es mal zu Wartezeiten beim Check in kam.",4,2010,08,10
36,Sehr guten Geschäftshotel,"Das Hilton Diagonal Mar ist ein sehr guten Hotel ein wenig ausserhalb Barcelonas, aber sehr gut angebunden mit der Strassenbahn, oder U-Bahn. Das Hotel verfügt über alle erdenklichen Extras, wie Aussenpool mit Poolbar, Restaurant sowie schöner Executive Launge im 15ten Stock mit herrlichem Ausblick auf Barcelona und das Meer. Die Preise für das Hotel sind moderat, vorallem wenn man die Hilton Prepaid Variante wählt. Das Restaurant ist sehr teuer, ich empfehle evtl. in das gegenüberliegende Einkaufszenter zu gehen, dort gibt es tolle Restaurants, eines z.B. ist ein Fisch und Meeresfrüchte Buffet Restaurant inkl. Sushi, für 10 EUR / Person, echt Klasse. Das Einkaufszentrum hat aber auch sonst viel zu bieten. Die U-Bahn / Strassenbahn erreicht man vom Hotel, indem man durch das Einkaufszentrum läuft und steht dann genau vor der Strassenbahn, die die Av. Diagonal entlang fährt. Wenn man diese Strasse noch überquert kommt man zur Metrohaltestelle.",5,2010,07,25
36,Am Strand gelegen - weg vom Trubel,"Das Hilton Diagonal ist ein tolles Business Hotel ca. 100 m vom Beach. Optimal für alle Läufer (Laufrichtung nach Rechts vom Hotel!). Es gibt ein Shopping Center direkt nebenbei, mit vielen Kettengeschäften etc. 
Ansonsten liegt das Hotel abseits von der Stadt. U-Bahn Verbindung ist gut. 
Einen Pool gibt es auf der Terrasse, die Sauna ist ziemlich klein und nicht so einladend. Ansonsten ist das Hotel durchaus gut und schön.",4,2010,07,20
36,Herrliche Zeit in Barcelona,"Das Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona ist ein sehr schönes Hotel (6-Sterne), neu und liegt genial.

Das Außenpool ist nur im Sommer geöffnet, daher konnten wir es nicht in Anspruch nehmen. Aus dem Executive Lounge können Sie einen Meerblick genießen. Es liegt auf dem 15. Stock und hat eine schöne Terasse. Es war bis jetzt das beste Exec. Lounge,  das wir erlebt haben (vollständige Verpflegung auch abends).

Das Hotel liegt 200 Meter vom Strand und 15 Minuten vom Zentrum Barcelonas entfernt gegenüber dem Kongresszentrum Barcelona International Convention Center. Die Fahrt vom Flughafen zum Hotel dauert etwa 25 Minuten. Auch mit Bahn/U-Bahn ich das Hotel leicht zu erreichen.

Man kann wunderbare Spaziergänge vom Hotel aus machen. Auch der Hop off - hop on Bus hat eine nahe Haltestelle.

Barcelona und auch das Hotel sind sehr empfehlenswert.",5,2010,07,15
36,Sehr modernes Hilton mit Konferenzmöglichkeiten,"Ein sehr schönes Hilton Hotel, direkt am Wasser im Kongressbereich von Barcelona. 

Das Personal war sehr freundlich und bemüht, vor allem auch in Hinblick auf das Hilton Honors Programm. Die Zimmer sind sehr modern, gross und sauber. Bettenqualität ist tadellos. 

Bar und Restaurants entsprechen dem üblichen Business Standard. Es gibt aber auch einige Restaurants von Tappas BAr bis Mc Donalds in der Nähe. 

Insg. ein sehr empfehlenswertes Hotel - allerdings eher im Aussenbezirk und nicht gerade auf ""la rambla"".",4,2010,07,01
36,Modernessehr gutes  am Meer gelegenes Hotel,"Hotel ist gut mit den öffentlichen Nahverkehrsmitteln (Metro) zu erreichen.
Zimmer mit Meerblick sind empfehlenswert in den oberen Stockwerken ohne Sichtbehinderung durch Nachbargebäude.
Sehr schönes grosses Outdoor Schwimmbad. Wunderschön gelegene Excecutive Lounge in Höhe des 15. Stockes mit der Möglichkeit auch aussen zu sitzen.",5,2010,06,27
36,Modern,"Etwas abseits vom Zentrum und den Ramblas gelegen ist das Hilton Diagonal. Ein neues modernes Hotel und den bekannten Hilton Annehmlichkeiten.
Zum Zentrum muss man das Taxi nehmen, was allersings nur 10 Minuten dauert.
Die Zimmer sind groß und komfortabel. Ein sehr angenehmes Wohnen.
Es gibt ein Outsoor-Schwimmbad für die warmen Tage. 
Wer es auf die Executive-Etage schafft, der hat nochmal ein paar Annehmlichkeiten mehr.",4,2010,06,09
36,Ein hervorragendes Hotel mit Meerblick 200 Meter vom Strand,"In Mai 2010 habe ich zwei Nächte in Hilton Hotel Diagonal Mar verbracht. Das Hotel liegt in der Nähe der Seeküste, aber man kann in kürzer Zeit auch in die Innerstadt fahren. In fünf Minuten erreicht man die besten Strände Barcelonas. Also das Hotel ist eine ideale Wahl, wenn man ein paar Tage an der Meeresküste verbringen möchte. Das Hotelpersonal ist sehr hilfsbereit und die Hotelzimmer haben einen wunderschönen Blick aufs Meer oder auf die Stadt.",5,2010,06,04
36,Schöne Executive Lounge,"Etwas abgelegen, dafür ruhig und trotzdem mit U-Bahn und Strassenbahn gut erreichbar. Viele Zimmer haben einen herrlichen Ausblick zum Meer. Komfortabel und modern eingerichtete Zimmer und Lobby-Bereich. 
Empfehlenswert sind Executive-Zimmer, die auf den oberen Etagen liegen. Typischer Lounge-Service mit Frühstück, Getränken, Kuchen am Nachmittag und Snacks/Cocktails am Abend, grosse Getränkeauswahl. In der Lounge sehr schöner Ausblick, Aussenbereich mit Sonnenterasse und aufmerksamen Service.
Wie so oft leider sehr teurer Internetanschluss, W-LAN für 26€/24h! Selbst in der Lounge ist an 2 Workingstations der Internetzugang kostenpflichtig.",5,2010,06,02
36,Eccezionale,"Bellisimo Hotel, e molto elegante a 10 minuti dal centro con la metro'",5,2010,01,30
36,Una perfecta elección para ir en pareja,"Aunque somos de Barcelona decidimos celebrar nuestro décimo aniversario en el Hotel. Las habitaciones son generosas, y la vista de Barcelona desde una perspectiva poco habitual es espectacular y por cierto muy romántica. El servicio, extremadamente atento, procuró que todos los momentos de nuestra celebración fueran perfectos. Recomendamos especialmente en la planta ejecutiva (piso 15), donde se pueden tomar copas en la terraza con vistas a la ciudad y todo el litoral. La zona (Diagonal Mar) es ideal para ir de compras y pasear junto al mar. En definitiva, una perfecta elección para un fin de semana en pareja.",5,2009,12,26
36,"Splendido Hilton, ma decentrato!","Ad inizio ottobre abbiamo soggiornato presso l'HOTEL HILTON DIAGONAL MAR, che è a Barceloneta, direttamente in spiaggia. Eravamo al 16° piano. L'hotel è poco distante dal centro, ma certo non è comodo, ecco.
C'è una vista splendida, la camera è gigante, il bagno ha il bidet ed anche la bilancia pesapersone... quando si vola con Ryanair e si fanno acquisti va più che bene sapere il peso della valigia!
Gli interni sono tutti in legno chiaro, il lettone è più grande del normale (credo sia un king) e la colazione ottima ed abbondante.
Ovvio che qui il prezzo è alto, è un 6*, ma ci siamo andati per un congresso, per cui... la scelta non è stata nostra!",3,2009,11,22
36,buen rollo,"el servicio de habitaciones podria mejorar pero en general todo muy bien,limpio y gente muy simpatica",4,2009,10,18
36,Una atención espléndida,"El hotel es un 4 estrellas pero claramente tirando a 5, bueno estamos hablando de un Hilton... Nos quedamos en la planta 15 (Ejecutiva) del hotel, demás está decir que la atención fue espléndida, no importa cuan pesada se pueda ser, ellos siempre tienen una sonrisa en la cara para atender a todas tus necesidades. Las habitaciones geniales, con vistas al mar, mini-bar, tele por cable, asistentas que pasan 2 veces al día a subirte el A/A en la mañana y a bajarlo en la noche para que no te congeles mientras duermes, todos los productos de belleza de una marca británica, porque no se permiten nada de cutreces; las toallas son enormes como para darte dos vueltas, gruesas y hasta pesadas, de excelente calidad, así como los albornoces, las pantuflas y todo el menaje que viene con la habitación. 

Frente al hotel está el centro comercial Diagonal Mar donde se pueden llenar muchas horas de ocio, y en la parte de atrás la playa del Maresme a sólo 200mts. La experiencia realmente fue genial, si no hubiese tenido que la obligación de ir a conocer la ciudad, no me hubiese salido un solo minuto del hotel.

Si debo decir algo negativo del hotel es la ubicación, es que está lejos del centro de la ciudad y la oferta de actividad nocturna de la zona es muy pobre. AH y que la piscina pudiera ser más grande.",4,2009,08,28
36,"Soñado, Bellisimo...","El Hotel es hermoso, muy comodo, las habitaciones son grandes y luminosas. Esta frente al mar. El desayuno es excelente y por una diferencia de precio muy baja, existe la posiblidad de un sistema de pension casi completa para comer en el hotel. el personal es muy agradable y correcto. Laubicación es buena, frente a un shopping gigante pero un poco alejado del centro. Esta a unos cuatros cuadras del metro.",5,2009,08,12
36,"Nett, aber viel zu teuer","Am Hotel war eigentlich nichts wirklich aussergewöhnlich, ausser dem Preis.  
Das Frühstück war nicht schlecht, aber auch nichts besonderes.  
27 EUR/24h für Internet-Nutzung ist eine Frechheit (vor allem, wenn der Zimmerpreis eh schon so hoch ist).
Im Zimmer ging erstmal der Strom nicht, und dann ging der Fernseher nicht - wurde schnell behoben, ist bei dem Preis aber inakzeptabel.
Das Bett war gut, das Bad war sauber, das Wasser heiss - soweit also erfreulich.",2,2009,02,02
