240,Great Service,Luis went far and beyond making sure we relaxed.We arrived early for our reservation and Luis took our bags and told us a place to eat and unwind while our room was being made up. He went the extra mile and brought our luggage up and the keys to us.,5,2024,10,05
240,Outstanding as usual,"As excellent as usual - such a nice place to stay. Excellent comfortable room, new menu at Broyage Bistro - most enjoyable food. The best part of this hotel is its convenient location and wonderful staff. Special thanks to Luis (night manager). He was so kind and showed such warm, genuine hospitality as I checked out around 0700 on a Monday morning. He thanked me for my Hilton loyalty, hoped I slept well and was so caring and genuinely interested in his guests. After completing the check out he went to the trouble of ensuring (without even asking) that I had a nice coffee to start my day off before a drive. Judit in reservations always goes so far beyond the call of duty to look after me - the hotel is great and these two special, outstanding, team members deserve recognition for doing such a great job! Their genuine interest in guests would inspire any guest to be loyal to Hilton. Thanks for the hospitality! Look forward to returning before too long! ",5,2023,07,26
240,Minhue @ breakfast was amazing :) amazing lady,I had the breakfast buffet and the lady working was named Minhue. She is lovely! So friendly and caring towards her guests. I think the hotel would benefit HUGELY if she had more responsibility in different areas other than breakfast buffet.,5,2024,10,03
240,First Stop in Ireland,"We were looking for a location in Dublin, Ireland that would give us great access to city‚Äôs old and new while providing us with world-class accommodation and services - we found it.  The staff were so friendly and helpful from Miramar in the restaurant and housekeeping to front desk were just outstanding!",5,2024,09,29
240,Disappointing,"Was honestly a bit disappointing. Was upgraded but issues with the room.  Hotel was unable to find two non-feather pillows on the first night of our stay which was not helpful given allergies.  They said they would replace all the pillows the following day but never bothered.

Coffee at breakfast was pretty dire.  Breakfast was overall ok.  Even though I am a Diamond member we chose to have breakfast elsewhere.",3,2024,09,24
240,"Great hotel, same room categories vary.","We arrived at the end of August and stayed 2 nights and then for one night in September.  Our first room, face the Killmainham Jail.  It was a large room with a king size bed.  The bathroom had both a tub and a separate shower.  The location was great and the hotel was very quiet.  Blink 182 was playing a concert across from the hotel.  We didn't hear any of the crowd on the street from our room when the concert was done. The breakfast was amazing.  Ask for a voucher at the front desk.  This saves you about 6 Euro off the price.

My only issue is that when we arrived for our one night stay in September, our room was considerably different.  I double checked that when we booked, our room category was the same for both August stay and September stay.  It was.  Our September room was 222.  Don't stay in this room.  The AC barely blew, we had someone come to look at it.  She put her hand up to it, said it was cold and that was that.  The bathroom had only a shower and was considerably smaller that our August room.  Also, my side of our king size bed was horrible.  It slanted inward towards my husband.  The difference in height of the two mattresses was so significant, that I had to put a pillow between my husband and I so I wouldn't roll over to him all night.  It wasn't a pleasant sleep at all.  I'm not sure why we had such a great room the first stay and a crappy room for the second stay, especially when we had the same room category for both.",4,2024,09,20
240,Great hotel!,"Great hotel located a short walk from the Guinness brewery, friendly staff (everyone was smiling!), and amazing breakfast! Thank you for your hospitality, we have really enjoyed our stay here, hopefully we will be able to come back sometime in the future.",5,2024,09,18
240,Family Celebrations üíêüéÇüçæ,"Celebrating my wife and my granddaughter Birthday and it was amazing experience, dinner and the breakfast was superb, friendly and accommodating staff, food was excellent above beyond expectations. Rooms very Clean and Spacious, well doneüëèüëèüëè",5,2024,09,13
240,Birthday Stay,"We stayed here in suite 410 from the seventh to ninth of September. I telephoned the hotel the day before as being Hilton Gold members the hotel can at their discretion upgrade gold or diamond members upto seventy-two hours prior to arrival. It was my birthday on the sixth, and I know that one shouldn‚Äôt ask, but wait to be offered. Upon telephoning I spoke with Filipe, and explained that we were seeing Dublin as part of my sixty-fourth birthday. Filipe was polite, courteous and graciously offered to immediately up grade us. This hotel is at the higher end of the brand, and is expensive, but therefore attracts the more discerning guests who appreciate the refinement of such an establishment and the exceptional standard of service that Filipe and his team provide. From the moment we arrived, to the moment we left, we were made to feel extremely welcome. The hotel has a lovely outdoor dining area, comfortable lounge and a breakfast that is one of the most superior in any Hilton we have ever stayed. Believe me we have stayed in loads, it takes a lot of stays to get to Gold and loads more to get to Diamond. The hotel has its own car park at an extra fee and a lovely pool and spa. The bed was huge, firm, and amazingly comfortable. Being a king sized bed the pillows were equally massive and extremely sink your head in, fall asleep immediately comfortable. Blackout curtains kept the room nice and dark, otherwise there is a strange blue light that lights up the room. The balcony is lovely, and privately screened from other guests while we took a pre breakfast tea or coffee from the pod machine in our suite. There is also room service for a delicious meal to be served on the balcony if one wishes. The room was huge and immaculately presented. The room service staff were all very friendly and polite and all spoke when passing, a polite good morning or whatever time of day it was, all were very generous with those little pots of milk, I have four of those in tea. Highly recommend this establishment for that little bit of extra luxury from Filipe and his amazing team..",5,2024,09,10
240,"Excellent hotel, well worth visiting","Gorgeous hotel & an easy walk to the luas. Staff are really friendly, food in the bar is gorgeous & breakfast was really lovely with an excellent selection. 
The only negative I have to say is there is only one coffee machine for everyone in the breakfast room so at peak times the queues are very long & there is no option to have pots of tea/coffee brought to the table",5,2024,08,27
240,A good hotel,"Our stay at this hotel was largely enjoyable with several standout features, though there were a few areas for improvement.

The hotel was very clean throughout, and the spacious room and bathroom added to our comfort. The bed was comfortable, though it was a bit bouncy when your partner turned over, which might affect light sleepers.

A nice touch was the placement of the shower controls away from the actual shower heads, allowing us to adjust the water to the perfect temperature before stepping in. Additionally, the large print on the toiletries was especially useful, making it easier to read while in the shower.

The staff were friendly and attentive, and the good wifi connectivity was a bonus for staying connected.

Breakfast was plentiful, but the quality left something to be desired. For instance, the fresh cucumber was slimy and the cherry tomatoes were squashy, which detracted from the overall experience.

Dinner at the restaurant, specifically the Greek salad, was a bit of a letdown. It didn‚Äôt resemble a traditional Greek salad, which was disappointing. However, the restaurant staff were attentive and helpful, providing good service throughout our meal.

Overall, while the hotel excels in cleanliness, comfort, and staff friendliness, there are a few areas that could be improved to enhance the overall guest experience.",4,2024,08,13
240,Always a favorite,"I‚Äôve stayed here in the past and enjoyed it. For some odd reason , the last few years I‚Äôve tried other accommodations in Dublin and after this last visit, have decided that THIS hotel is my ‚Äúgo to‚Äù while visiting Dublin. Not bogged down in the too touristy areas, but close enough to enjoy everything. Clean rooms, friendly staff and a nice restaurant with outside seating. Highly recommend",5,2024,08,07
240,Appreciation of a great hotel.,"This Hilton hotel is without doubt the best Hilton property in Dublin for the following reasons;
All of the Hilton Team make you feel welcome, valued and always go the extra mile for their Customers regardless of whom they are or the status they carry such as Diamond Member which really sets this Team/Hotel apart from everyone else.
A special mention must go to Felipe Ovalhe Bueno who is the Front Office Manager at the hotel who is simply wonderful as he always goes above and beyond to ensure that all hotel guests are made feel special & welcome, his attitude, professionalism & Customer Service is exceptional.",5,2024,08,05
240,Top notch hotel with amazing breakfast,"Exceptional hotel, worth every penny. 
Felipe on reception really made every effort to make sure we were comfortable and happy. 
The gym and pool/sauna/jazuzzi are well maintained and staff were very pleasant. 
Breakfast was amazing and staff helpful. 
Rooms were very comfortable. 
You wouldn't get a better hotel in Dublin. ",5,2024,08,04
240,"Great Staff, Great Stay","We stayed for 2 nights (13 & 14 July). The staff were very attentive and friendly. Barbara (Reception), Abbie (Breakfast), Jin and Lennox (Bar/Restaurant) all deserve a mention. All are an asset to the Hilton Brand. Well done Hilton Kilmainham, we look forward to returning soon. Irwin Edgar",5,2024,07,19
240,"A very comfortable room, a restful night, an excellent staff, a top-notch stay","My daughters and I greatly appreciated our stay at the Hilton Dublin Kilmainham.
Maria warmly greeted us at the front desk.  She graciously helped us with an early check-in, kindly confirming that I had called ahead to pre-arrange with the reservation director, Fernando. They each played an integral part in our excellent stay.  Maria also watched our luggage while we enjoyed a delicious, late brunch right there and while finishing touches were completed in our room. Our room was very comfortable. We had an enjoyable, restful night. Thank you, Maria and Fernando for your gracious, professional accommodation of our special request. I highly recommend the Hilton Dublin Kilmainham. 
Helpful tip: The Kilmainham Gaol Tour across the street was one of our favorites in Dublin.",5,2024,07,13
240,Awesome well deserved 5 stars üåü üåüüåüüåüüåü,"I am not normally inclined to write reviews while I am still here but as it's a longer stay I will write it now .  Location a little outside but taxis easily accessible , reception can help but be prepared for up to ‚Ç¨20 to the city . 
Lovey park around . 
Booking simple through Hilton
Communication with my many changing and varied needs easy by email with rapid responses 
Thank you 

The stars are the staff , helpful and supportive . I am sorry I can't remember all the names but all helpful with my needs in a difficult time . 
 
I will certainly be returning 
Thank you",5,2024,07,02
240,Paula and Mihke‚Äôs Hospitality is like a warm hug!!,"This hotel has got a staff that is worth staying for!! From Paula and Mihke in dining to the front desk staff at check-in, we felt like we were embraced and cared for every step of the way. You‚Äôre treated like royalty in this lovely Hilton that happens to be so nicely located to Gaol Museum and so many parks! I‚Äôd come back here for Paula and Mihke‚Äôs hospitality alone! Bravo, your friends in Long Beach, NY",5,2024,07,01
240,Dublin holiday,"My sister and i stayed from the 27/5/24 for 5 nights, its a lovely hotel very clean, comfortable beds, there is so much choice at breakfast i couldn't wait to get down on the first morning for my white pudding.  we were shown to a table with a reserved sign on which we didn't thing anything of as a cousin was joining us but shortly after my Daughter and Niece surprised us we had no idea they were coming. we would like to say Thank you very much to Mihae who helped them with the surprise such a lovely lady she asked us later if we had got over the shock and on our last morning she said she hoped we had a lovely stay and would be back. The staff are friendly and helpful. The hotel is only a short bus ride from the centre of Dublin, across the road from Kilmainham Gaol which we visited and enjoyed, Phoenix park is just up the road spent many a happy time there as a child and went again.",5,2024,06,08
240,Very poor service,It was a disaster from start to finish we went for a rod stewert concert which was held in royal hospital  we were left waiting on drinks everytime for over half hour there was a chinese large man behind the bar who was extremely rude to everyone they knew this concert was on and had no organisation whats so ever people were leaving in there drones to which they lost business but the staff didnt seem to care we were going to have food but it took so long to get drinks we didnt bother i hope they  learn from what happend yesterday and nobody eles suffers the frustration we did.,1,2024,05,27
240,Fabulous Hotel- Great Staff,"My son and I visited Ireland for the first time. We stayed at this hotel, and I must tell you it was wonderful! The room I had was clean and spotless.

Restaurant and Bar Staff were so kind and accommodating.

But the person that was the kindest and helpful to me was Felipe  Buono- He was a gentleman and so informative. 

Many times when traveling the person at the front desk is certainly not as nice as Felipe was and I thank him for that and welcoming me to Ireland.

240,Great place!,"This hotel is clean and in an excellent area. It has all of the things I look forward to make me comfortable, including air condition, a refrigerator, and a cozy bed. The customer service is impeccable. Lewis helped us and he was EXCELLENT. Can‚Äôt say enough!",5,2024,05,08
240,"Nice staff, but hotel underdelivers","I will remember this hotel best for an unusually wide gap between price charged and value delivered in return. My objections started with being told on check-in that there was no executive lounge and that they instead gave guests who would have had lounge access drink vouchers (no food, of course, as that would actually cost them money). Though on this occasion someone else in my party used them, I normally throw drink vouchers right into the garbage, as I only need water and am not interested in going to the hotel bar to get water when the tap will do fine. Drink vouchers are clearly just a cheap out for the hotel. Then there was the room. I had apparently reserved two twins. Here, that turned out to mean beds of the smallest possible size, i.e. the sort one doesn't even normally find in better hotels. My upgrade (I have Diamond status) consisted of a room with only one really small bed and, instead of a second one, a full-size bed. There was no couch and no easy chair, just one office chair and in general not all that much space in the room. The bathroom was also small, with a little bathtub and no separate shower stall. The set-up guaranteed water on the floor after every shower. Moreover, it would have been nice to have some ventilation for the steam, but although a ventilation unit was visible, there was no way to turn it on. Consistent with this hotel's obvious effort at giving as little as possible, there were absolutely no toiletries unless specifically requested, with the shampoo and such in dispensers and not even bar soap to be seen. That for me was a new low, since in my experience, every other hotel that has gone over to dispensers at least provides bar soap. Not this stingy place. Even internet access wasn't quite like elsewhere - my phone never connected automatically after brief interruptions due to being on flight mode, in the elevator or outside, and on both my phone and my laptop access was only granted for 24 hours at a time, so three times across three nights I had to log in anew from the start. The gym could have been the saving grace, but they managed to limit the benefit from that, too. The facility is not very large to begin with, and the machines, the selection of which is small, are crammed in. There is almost no space between the treadmills, while the bench for bench press is up against the wall so close that a spotter is impossible. Worse, it is open to non-guests, and that being the case, was often overcrowded throughout my three days here. Even this serious flaw could have conceivably been overcome, had the gym been open at night at least to guests, but unfortunately, it closes before I would normally want to use it. This hotel also squandered the opportunity of breakfast to stand out positively. It wasn't a terrible breakfast, just clearly a bit less than one would expect. No egg station, no lox, no fried mushrooms, no vegan or vegetarian sausages even on request, no strawberries or bueberries, nothing not completely standard and in general zero variation from one day to the next. Finally, and this may be hard to believe, check-out is at 11:00 here, a clear departure from the norm and entirely to the detriment of guests, of course. We were able to get a ""late"" checkout - at 12:30 (no joke, unfortunately). As staff was quite nice and helpful throughout (Gamze stood out particularly positively), I have to assume this is just that built-in tendency of the company to underdeliver. I suppose the combination of Hilton, a hotel chain that never tires of asking itself where it can get away with providing less value to guests, and Ireland, a country the hallmark of whose hospitality industry is astronomically high prices, invites disappointment.",2,2024,05,07
240,Highly recommended,"Great hotel in a wonderful location. The Modern Art Museum and the Gaol were right outside the door and there were some nice places to eat as well. Perfect place to stay if you don‚Äôt want to be in the city center and prefer some greenery and quiet.

But the real star of the place was the front desk staff. Specifically Felipe. He was one of a kind. Many thanks to him and his kind and warm personality. Highly recommended.",5,2024,05,05
240,My faultless stay,"I have kept this short & sweet. Otherwise I would be typing pages on how perfect this hotel is. 

The room was immaculate! 

The bed, pillows, & duvet are the most comfortable I have ever experienced. I genuinely wanted to buy them & import them back to  England. 

The breakfast was amazing! Everything was cooked to perfection. 

I would like to give a special mention to Sabina.  You made my stay extra special with your perfect attention to detail. 

A genuine 5 star review! - you are doing everything to perfection.",5,2024,05,03
240,Great stay at the Hilton,Had a great stay at the Hilton Kilmainham! The staff were awesome and Sabina on the front desk was super helpful in helping us find parking for our oversize vehicle. The facilities are perfect to relax and take it easy. Would definitely stay again.,5,2024,04,19
240,Excellent Service,We had an excellent stay at the Hilton Kilmainham in Dublin. Staff was excellent and the dining rooms had very good meals and service. Mihae was working the breakfast dining room both mornings and she provided us excellent customer service. We would stay here again. The room was lovely and very clean. Highly recommend.,5,2024,04,17
240,"Average hotel, facilities are not fabulous","The room we were in was rather shabby although clean and the beds were comfortable 
The facilities were not great, there was a steam room and a jacuzzi, with a small unswimable pool which you could not swim even slightly in due to length and depth, but you could just stand or sit in it if you wanted to. It was freezing also.
The gym was small with limited equipment but it had the basics and was fine for a few days
The breakfast was good, although I found it strange we were told we could have hot cooked food upon request, but when I asked for a menu they did not have one. So when I asked for a number of items I was told they did not make that, so was left confused as to how I was supposed to know what they made without a menu. The buffet did include a full English and cold meats, cheeses, breads, smoothies, cereals etc which had things for everyone 
The location is on the outskirts of the city center and I was happy about that when I booked, although didn‚Äôt anticipate the cost of taxis, I think if I‚Äôd have known I would have hired a car. The large majority of my money was spent on taxis. Of course dependant on one‚Äôs stay the location may or may not be an issue. 
All in all the hotel was average, not luxurious but clean and comfortable.",3,2024,04,04
240,what a great stay!!!,"My mom and dad had a great stay there!!!
I thank the kindness of the staff, specially to Mr Sachin and Mr. Felipe, you are amazing!!!

Breakfast and dinner were absolutely good.

This hotel, in addition to be easy to reach, deserves a lot higher rating!!!

240,Super comfortable and well worth the money,"I checked in quite late due to my delayed train but the young lady that was doing the evening shift on the 22.3 was very good and helpful to me, as I arrived so late the hotel had stopped serving food but she gave me recommended places to eat in the area, it turned out to be the best Chinese I have ever had.
The gentleman in the morning 23.3 also very nice!
The room itself was great! Bed was super comfortable and spacious, bathroom was great also. I like the little touch of both still and sparkling waters in the cooler :) very good hotel. Would like to come back for leisure next time as this was a business trip.",5,2024,03,23
240,Such a fiasco!!!,"I can't believe it because they took the time schedule for check-in from me as 4 am and I also saw that in the e-mail sent to me, the check in is 4 pm! When I call, what they told me is what time you write there is it, they say that we can't promise if we don't have a room for that hour. It's like I'm begging you for room! I gave money and I request the right room within the day I am entitled to, the website and page where you did not write a statement and caused victimization will be considered as legal evidence. And they tell me that if I wanted to enter at that hour, I had to pay 200 euros in excess. Just yesterday, I called and talked, because I will come at this hour, moreover, I have a meeting at 8 a.m. I went to many places and I have never seen such a fiasco. I will come for 4 hours. In addition, this is not legally correct, if the time limits are after 12am, the new day begins. Even if you are receiving an arrival time and check-in time, you cannot give the check-in time 12 hours after the arrival time. I will sue you. If I didn't double check, I would have a big problem.",1,2024,03,22
240,"Nice hotel, friendly. Good access to some points.","Nice Hotel, directly across from the prison.  Accommodating staff and good full service breakfast for purchase.  The tram is about a half mile walk.  Pretty good gym at the hotel to use.  Irish War Memorial Park is nearby for a good safe run with no traffic.  Heuston train station about 12-15 minute walk",4,2024,03,06
240,Excellent Stay,"Stayed here for four nights earlier this month while on holiday in Ireland.

The hotel was fully booked during our stay (it was Six Nations Rugby that weekend) so no upgrades were available but we had a nice room on the 4th floor.  We found the bed a little hard for our liking but apart from that we couldn't fault the bedroom.  It was nicely appointed as well as being spotlessly clean.

As Diamond members we got drinks vouchers for the bar which makes up (somewhat) for the lack of an Executive Lounge at the hotel.  

Staff were very friendly, except for the bartender who always looked miserable as sin.

Breakfast was always good.  A decent selection of hot and cold offerings.  We had the omelette a couple of times and it was really outstanding.  We also ate in the bar twice in the evenings and food was consistently good.

The hotel is well placed for the Kilmainham Gaol (literally right across the street from the front door), and the IMMA and the Guinness Storehouse are within walking distance.  We really enjoyed staying away from the city centre and would have no hesitation in staying here again.  It's a 25 - 30 minute taxi ride from the airport and taxis were plentiful.

Overall I'd say this is probably one of the best Hilton hotels I've stayed in.",5,2024,02,26
240,Fabulous hotel,"Upon arrival the young children were presented with a small teddy they were delighted also the pancakes the children loved them 
We went in the pool /sauna and steam room you will receive towels when you go in 
The staff we polite kind and very friendly at all times we  it was 20 mins from the airport 
I had a cocktail which was reasonably priced delicious 
We will be back we loved it and the breakfast all you could want and more 
Perfect",5,2024,02,11
240,Not a good night's sleep,"Booked this hotel to be close to the hospital. Minimal parking. Pleasant staff on arrival. Lovely food in the bar for lunch and staff were attentive. However, our room was awful. Old and outdated, the bed was on wheels and moved at the slightest touch (not great for changing a newborn's diaper). The mattress was ancient, and full of noisy springs that actually woke the baby - both my husband and I woke up with back pain. The bedding we were given was all feather/down which I am allergic to. I called housekeeping who were able to change it, but the new duvet was too small for the bed, and the pillows were ridiculously lumpy and uncomfortable. They also couldn't get pre-authorisation to work on my card which was an inconvenience, albeit minor. We discussed all this with the staff at the front desk and they offered a neasly ‚Ç¨12 refund on some drinks we had had, but that has not come through yet so I wonder.
Really disappointed by a Hilton which should have better standards. Will not be returning, and would think twice about booking any Hilton hotel in the future.",2,2024,02,11
240,"Good service, great staff",Hotel is not exactly in the city center but the service is good and staff is lovely. The hotel has a very rich breakfast in the morning. Definitely the breakfast is recommended. Mihae is also great for her being so helpful and having a smile in her face üôÇ,5,2024,02,09
240,Amazing Pleasant Stay,"I had the most amazing stay at Hilton Dublin! The front desk staff, Tatiana, Paola, and Bartender Clement and Patrick went above and beyond to make me feel welcome from the moment I arrived. Their warm smiles and friendly demeanor made me feel right at home.

Tatiana was incredibly helpful and efficient thru out my entire stay ensuring that I had everything I needed for a comfortable stay always caring about my wellbeing making my visit to Dublin even more memorable.

Paola, another member of the front desk staff, was always available to assist with any inquiries or requests I had during my stay. Her attention to detail and genuine concern for my satisfaction truly stood out.

I must also mention the exceptional service provided by Clement and Patrick, the bartender & Server at the hotel's bar. Not only did they create the most delicious cocktails, but they also took the time to chat and make me feel like a valued guest. Both mixology skills and friendly personality added an extra level of enjoyment to my evenings at the hotel.

Overall, my stay at Hilton Dublin was made exceptional by the outstanding service provided by Tatiana, Paola, Clement, and Patrick. Their dedication, warmth, and attention to detail truly made me feel like a valued guest. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Dublin and looking for a memorable stay with exceptional staff.",5,2024,01,24
240,An excellent stay - as always!,We enjoyed yet another wonderful stay in the Hilton Kilmainham last night. I had arranged the booking via Sachin in Reservations who is always super efficient at doing so - as are Judit and Sara! Check-in with Gamze was straightforward and we received a genuine warm welcome. Our room was super cosy and we are always delighted because the staff go above and beyond to make our stay as comfortable as possible - for that I am so grateful. The beds and pillows are super comfortable and we had a room on the fourth floor with great views. We had breakfast in the room this morning which arrived exactly as requested. It was really good. Check-out with Sara was super efficient. Thank you to Phil and all the team - as always. You are superstars!,5,2024,01,24
240,Group Booking for Weekend,"Pleasant start to finish - all staff were incredibly accommodating and went out of their way to make our stay wonderful. It was a group booking over the weekend with a few last minute changes but everything went so smoothly.

Hotel was immaculate and smelled amazing",5,2024,01,24
240,Consistently Excellence,"From start to finish the stay was excellent (as always).
Hilton Kilmainham is my 'go to' hotel whenever staying in Dublin. Yes - it's not that central - but this is a major positive for the hotel. The secure parking gives you peace of mind, and the level of service and room fit-out is far superior to any of the 'Dublin central' hotel options I've tried.
We were staying as a few freinds were attending the Leinster vs Munster match in the Aviva.
The location is ideal and we easily used Uber to and from the venue - after the match we were able to leave the hustle and bustle and return to the hotel bar for a nightcap or 2!
As a Hilton Honors member I was upgraded to a King Room on the ground floor. They have been fitted out to a very high standard, due to the hotel's location - even a ground floor room is nice and quiet.
Bar service was good on our return, breakfast is well presented with a wide variety of options and again service was very good.
Shout-out to the reception team led by Felipe - a warm welcome is always received and the team deal with all requests in a professional and efficient manner.",5,2023,12,14
240,Wish we booked this Hilton the entire vacation! ,"Our Hilton concierge, Sara, was excellent! She made our entire stay so enjoyable and special. We are Hilton lifetime Diamond VIP members and have stayed at numerous Hilton properties but she went far and beyond to make our vacation extra special. We arrived at noon and our room wasn't quite ready so she took our bags while we explored. Our luggage was in our room when we got back and 
we were upgraded to a Junior Suite instead of our Standard room which overlooked the Kilmainham Gaol and mountains. The suite had the largest Hilton property balcony we've seen and king size bed. There was a lovely assortment of chocolates, champagne,  mousse cake and ice cold bottled water awaiting us.
On our last sight seeing day Sara arranged a tour for us with Wild Rover tours which was the highlight of our trip. We couldn't be happier and will definitely be back to Dublin, Ireland and this Hilton!",5,2023,12,13
240,Just Perfect ,"I stay regularly in the Hilton Kilmainham but of late my stays have been even more enjoyable. Before you arrive, Judith in reservations has any little request organised. At check-in Philippe, Sara, Maria, Barbara and their colleagues extend a really warm, genuine welcome as if you were popping in to their house for a cup of tea. Marvellous. The new menu in the Broyage restaurant is top notch with a great selection for all types of diners and excellent value for money. The rooms are spotless, the bed linen crisp and the bed itself so so comfy. Breakfast with Paula & Co. is delightful with a huge range and choice of freshly prepared food. 
The area surrounding the hotel has improved immensely in recent years with easy access to the city centre using bus, taxi or Luas, all readily available. I have been staying in the Hilton Kilmainham for over 15 years and it is wonderful to see standards that have not only being maintained but also surpassed on every visit. Stay here and you will see for yourself.",5,2023,12,09
240,Perfect place to stay if you are visiting ireland,The best rooms i have ever stayed in. Amazing views and perfect location in the city! The staff are very kind and helpful. The food is so good and well varried. I highly recommend hilton in Kilmainham! ,5,2023,12,05
240,Good sleep,"Very comfortable room, great night sleep . Pleasant staff . The food in the bar has improved immensely since the last time I was there . Always a great stay, just one gripe, parking should be free . But that‚Äôs probably not a big deal. It‚Äôs a bit of a walk to luas ‚Ä¶.",4,2023,12,04
240,"The Kindest Staff, Great Food, and a Beautiful Property","My husband and I had stayed at the Hilton Dublin Kilmainham for our honeymoon years ago. We were finally getting to return to Dublin for our sixth wedding anniversary and wanted to stay there again. I wondered if it would be as good as we remembered it, as time had passed and things changed. We were delighted to discover the hotel was even better than we remembered it being last time. While the rooms were nicely appointed and the food on site (whether downstairs in the restaurants or room service) was excellent, what really set our stay apart was the service. My husband caught a cold during our stay and was stuck in our room resting. Everyone at the hotel, Ray and Paula especially, went out of their way to make sure we were taken care of. I have never felt so cared for at a hotel, and everything everyone at the hotel did for us made sure it was the best stay it could possibly be.

Aside from everything I mentioned above, the hotel is also well located: it is easy to catch a bus or taxi to wherever you're looking to go in Dublin. Again, couldn't recommend it enough.",5,2023,11,05
240,Thanks Fernando,"Excellent hotel in a quiet neighborhood of Dublin not far from the centre. Spacious, beautiful and well-equipped rooms and bathroom, extremely comfortable beds and all facilities. Perfect cleaning too.
We also enjoyed the meals in the restaurant. In addition to the wide variety of dishes, the portions are very generous and our orders arrived quickly.
A major highlight is the very attentive service provided by the entire team (reception, restaurant, room service and housekeeping, especially Fernando (housekeeping) who was very helpful and kind.",5,2023,11,04
240,Treated like royalty ,"I cannot recommend the Hilton Kilmainham enough. We are so impressed by the level of service and attention to detail from the staff. We always receive a warm and friendly welcome when we stay. 
We travel to Dublin often and we always stay there because we are so well treated. 
If you are lucky enough to meet Felipe when you check in you will be greeted by the most professional hotel reception manager you could meet. 
I can‚Äôt wait for my next stay. ",5,2023,10,28
240,Excellent Hotel,"The hotel is located about a 15 minute walk from Heuston train station in a pleasant suburban area. It has an up market ambience. All the staff were excellent. We had lunch in the bar area which was very good and we enjoyed sitting out on the terrace on a warm day. I enjoyed the swimming pool and leisure facilities.
We really enjoyed our stay, definitely a good choice in Dublin, with, sadly, Dublin hotel prices.",5,2023,10,22
240,Beautiful hotel ,"This is such a beautiful hotel. Spotlessly clean and so friendly and helpful. The room was beautiful, looking out over the front of the hotel. The beds are very comfy and the breakfast is gorgeous. The food in the restaurant was delicious and the pool was lovely. There was a Lviv gym too that we didn‚Äôt use. But looked amazing. ",5,2023,10,06
240,Lovely weekend!,"Came for the weekend for our baby moon! 
Great location, we spent lots of time walking around and it was super easy to get to places from here. super comfy bed! 
Food was beautiful. 
I can‚Äôt remember the receptionists name, but our flight was quicker than expected and we arrived an hour before check in. 
They noticed I was 6 months pregnant and allowed us a room instantly! 
So super grateful.

The staff were extra friendly, would return üôÇ",5,2023,09,29
240,A modern Hilton  - nothing more and nothing less,"This Hilton is modern four-star (maybe 4.5 star?) hotel and does exactly what it says on the box. It is exactly what you would expect of a suburban Hilton  - functional and generic. Certainly nothing to complain about; but nothing to get excited over either. 

The location is a bit odd at Kilmainham. It's not a great neighbourhood but worked for us as it was a short walk from the car rental return and we wanted to visit the Kilmainham gaol which was just across the street.  It is a 40 minute (almost flat) walk to the downtown Temple Bar district of Dublin or alternatively about 11-14 Euro in taxi back to the hotel at night depending on where you're picked up.

The room was functional and comfortable. The restaurant was OK for a snack and drink. Again, exactly what you would expect. There is access to the Livingwell gym which we had high expectations of having visited other Livingwell gyms around the world but was a bit disappointed by it as it was a bit small. It still did the job and was much better than most hotel gyms.

We thought it was pretty expensive for what it was considering the location however considering the price of other hotels in Dublin I can understand it.",4,2023,09,22
240,"Comfortable, clean, with amazing breakfast","Terrific location next to the Heuston train station.  The breakfast was amazing, one of the two best that we've had in Europe.  Excellent service, super comfortable and clean;   everything about this hotel was just great.  Highly recommend. ",5,2023,09,04
240,The perfect place to stay in Dublin with a dog,We spent 3 nights at the Hilton Kilmainham and had a great time. It‚Äôs perfect when travelling with a dog and the staff is really nice and very pet-friendly. Moreover the park across the street is the perfect place for walks. A special thanks goes to Maria from reception for the warm welcome and the surprise for our dog. One more special thanks goes to Fernando from F&B for his cheerful hospitality.,5,2023,08,29
240,Fantastic Hotel within Walking Distance of Guinness Brewery & Lovely Phoenix Park,"Really enjoyed my two night stay here in early August as a Hilton Diamond Member.  Maria at the front desk was wonderful, answered all my questions, and set up a taxi for me to depart early for airport.  Room and bathroom were both well appointed and super clean.  Had a problem with my air conditioning and television.  Management came up quickly and fixed both problems perfectly.  

Hotel is in a safe area with a beautiful stroll to the incredible Phoenix Park just down the street or to the Guinness Brewery.  Really enjoyed their huge fitness center both nights, as well as their lovely breakfast buffet each morning.  All staff members in hotel and restaurants treated me kindly and professionally throughout my stay.  They even walked me out to my taxi to say goodbye, and to make sure it was the right one to take me to the airport early in the morning.  Recommend this property highly.",5,2023,08,26
240,Amazing hotel and staff,I find it hard to describe how good this dog friendly hotel is.It‚Äôs amazingly comfortable but it‚Äôs the staff from Sara and Felipe on the front desk to all employees that made my visit special. The team around events and conferences ( Fernando and co) are professional and helpful. The bar and restaurant staff ( special mention for Paula) are all excellent. The leisure staff(special thanks to Paul) are great. All under the management of Phil and Kevin. The Hilton brand is safe in their hands.,5,2023,08,26
240,Poor poor for Hilton,"Couldn‚Äôt fault the rooms, clean and fantastic complimentary toiletries included.

However, bar & restaurant staff looked miserable‚Ä¶ took an eternity to get served a drink (which took 3people to order a drink!). The food was huge portions which is great for those with BIG appetites. Worryingly the breakfast bar displayed a sign ‚Äòif you‚Äôd like your breakfast hotter please speak to a member of staff‚Äô!! Surely this should be standard practice to service a hot cooked breakfast? Nope that was cold! The next day I did order a poached egg on toast‚Ä¶. Took 15 minutes and was over cooked and tasted of vinegar! ü§Æ didn‚Äôt even ask me what bread I‚Äôd liked toasted‚Ä¶ cheap sliced white bread! Gave up trying to have our evening meal there and went across the road to the pub. 

Overall very disappointed given the price and the reputation of the Hilton. Don‚Äôt go there! ",1,2023,08,16
240,Comfortable room and helpful staff.,"Staff were very friendly and helpful across the hotel. Rooms were spacious and very comfortable, with all the amenities. Breakfast was great quality with plenty of options. Great location close to Heiston Station with easy transport links. We had a really comfortable stay that made our visit.",5,2023,08,01
240,Great staff member,"Christian, staff from the gym, was very welcoming and helpful upon arrival each day. Running into Christian at the front desk, especially after a long day at work, was often motivation enough for a great workout. His smile and attitude reflected well on the overall gym environment at the hotel.",5,2023,07,25
240,Will return,We really loved our stay here. The car park is very small for the hotel which is the only issue I have to raise. The staff here were so pleasant and the room was big. We would definitely return! Staff in the bar were pleasant however they finished up around 11pm and left you there in the bar!,5,2023,07,23
240,AMAZING EXPERIENCE,"THIS IS THE BEST HOTEL EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE! The hotel is very nice, but the staff are just so incredible that our time here is something we will never forget! We had some issues during our trip, not pertaining to the hotel, but the hotel front desk attendant and the manager came to our rescue in a BIG WAY!  We cannot be more thankful or impressed.",5,2023,07,22
240,Balcony room with a view ,"We stayed in a deluxe room with a large private balcony overlooking Kilmainham Jail and Richmond Tower. Room was large, well equipped,  comfy bed. Balcony was great for sitting out and watching the world go by with a coffee in the morning. Reception staff were really friendly and helpful while checking in and out. Breakfast was great with plenty choice. Hotel is about 5 minutes from Heuston train station and the Luas tram into Dublin City centre. Also a short walk to Pheonix park and Dublin Zoo..",5,2023,07,22
240,RAMS on Tour,"we the RAMS had a lovely experience in the Hilton Hotel, after or visit to Kilmainham Gaol. the Hotel is just across the road from the jail, and so easy accessible. we had pre-booked lunch for 26 members, and it was so easy to walk across the road, and to be greeted by the reception, and shown to the restaurant. Although we arrived 30 mins early, there was no issues in have our lovely lunch served.
the light lunch was very well presented, no skimp on the sandwiches, great service by some lovely young staff.
it was a very leisurely lunch, no fuss, and a treat to our men.
Some of our member's were coeliacs,  and they too were well looked after.
the light lunch consisted of soup/variety of sandwiches/ French fried potatoes/ coffee, tea. the price was very good for a luxury hotel. so many thanks to all the staff for making our experience so good. ",5,2023,07,14
240,Dublin treat,"Great way to finish our trip to Ireland.Reception ladies were terrific and our dogs loved their doggy bags. The room balcony had a fabulous view of Dublin.The Museum of Modern Art across the road had a great park to walk the dogs.

240,Highly recommend,"Excellent customer service; a true Hilton experience; comfortable beds; beautiful expansive view; breakfast staff were so friendly and responsive ! Great experience!
It‚Äôs hard to know what you will find when booking a hotel, particularly in another country. This stay was very comfortable with excellent service!",5,2023,06,26
240,Great stay in Dublin,Great staff at the reception. Special thank you to Felipe. The Hotel is near amazing parks perfect to walk or jogging and outside the busy city center. Breakfast was good and the rooms  were very clean.,5,2023,06,21
240,A treat after a trip to the dentist.,"Lovely surroundings, lovely staff, lovely food, but the portions were a little small. We were not waiting too long to get our food, and it was piping hot when we got it. Coffee was just perfect and the little biscuit on the side was a nice treat. ",5,2023,06,20
240,Great Staff made the trip memorable,"hotel superb location beside Parks and walks and green spaces as well as the Nation museum and the Kilmainham Gaol.
The hotel is close to bus routes and the Luas which is great for getting in and around Dublin .
The hotel was even more memorable with a number of staff. Check in and out was great with Philippe and his  colleagues (a lovely blonde lady who looked after our bags and had then taken to the room since we arrived early and the room wasn't quite ready.
Our Meals including Breakfast where enhanced with a lady MeHay who made everyone feel special and went out of her way to make sure your stay was perfect. As well asher friendly smile and chat she was excellent as a travel guide and was prepared to recommend some local attractions and how to get there.
Overall I can recommend this as a great venue to stay in Dublin. 
Steve.

240,Good comfy place,The staff were very helpful with my sister and me as we use walkers. Our accessible room had two twin beds which was great . The buffet was very good and had fried eggs as well as scrambled. This is a great place to stay. We needed a room so this was not planned but it was really great,5,2023,05,27
240,"We really enjoyed our weekend stay here, the room was impressive and the staff were friendly and inviting.","We had a great experience at this hotel. The staff were wonderful, so inviting, warm and friendly, especially Sara on reception who was so accommodating to us and a lovely girl with glasses who was so attentive to us during breakfast. The room was really nice, spotless clean and the bed was very spacious and so comfortable. The pillows and linen were of high quality, we slept very well. The view from our balcony was great. The location is very central to many tourist attractions and is only a short journey to Dublin city. I was happy to see that they are environmentally conscious by using dispensers for shampoo etc. The breakfast room was really nice and had a lot of choice, on the first day we were offered tea and coffee and it was on the table when we returned with our breakfast. if I were to be a little picky the second morning we were not offered tea w had to ask and it got forgotten and the choice of food was not as great as the first day even though it was around the same time but we still really enjoyed our breakfast there. Its a lovely hotel.",5,2023,05,16
240,"Lovely hotel, NOT centrally located ","Trip with my adult son to see Bruce Springsteen in Dublin!!

Pros:
Very professional and attentive staff especially in the bar and the dining room at breakfast!! Amazing selection for buffet, delicious Irish breakfast, wonderful pool and hot tub, sauna, etc although it is a public gym.   Room windows have chains across them, I guess to convey that Kilmainham Jail experience although that detracts from the view, free water bottles, nice amenities in room, comfy beds

Cons
Location, location, location!   This place was a 20‚Ç¨ + taxi anywhere everytime.  Public transport is not so handy although there are buses.   I spent a fortune on Ubers tbh.   Had I known, I would have booked elsewhere.",4,2023,05,08
240,Pleasant experience,"Hilton Kilmainham was an absolute joy to stay at. I was very pleased with the accommodations, restaurant, and location. The restaurant offered high quality options, which my team took advantage of after long work days, rather than having to search for restaurants off location. The location of the hotel was excellent - just a quick taxi or tram ride to downtown Dublin. ",5,2023,05,02
240,First class dog friendly hotel,I just stayed at this hotel with my little chihuahuas as we were attending ac2 day dog festival.  On arrival the reception staff gave us a very warm welcome and had goodie bags waiting for the dogs.  The king size room was spacious with a lovely view. It was clean and well equipped.  The bed was extremely comfortable. I got room service and the food was served quickly and was delicious and reasonably priced.  Again the staff who brought the room service were fantastic with my dogs. I was also very happy with the secure parking facilities.  All in all a fantastic hotel with excellent customer service.  Will definitely stay again and highly recommend it whether travelling with dogs or not.,5,2023,04,25
240,Worst hotel I‚Äôve ever stayed in,"We stayed for 2 nights fri and sat,  first off the staff were great very helpful and courteous that‚Äôs where the good part finished you‚Äôve to pay for parking there‚Äôs no residents bar if you want food or drink after 12 you‚Äôve to get room service , the only food is margarita pizza or ham and cheese sandwich, no bathrobe in the room if you use the pool they give you a small towel and only one, no teaspoons at breakfast only wooden sticks all this for ‚Ç¨265 a night never again will I or any of my family stay here",1,2023,04,10
240,Bad Customer Service,"I flew over to Dublin for a friends event which was hosted at this hotel. The event was good and the restaurant staff were great. The reception staff were the complete opposite. Checking in wasn't pleasant with the lack of interest, customer service an they looked like they would rather be anywhere else. I was given my key and sent on my way - no direction was to what floor i was on or where i needed to go until i asked. I also wanted to see the room service menu but couldn't see it in my room, i called down to reception to ask where i could find the menu and i was advised there was a QR code on the mirror, to which there wasn't. I went down to reception to ask for the room service menu and I was told again the QR is on the mirror. I advise no there isn't one and the receptionist said sternly 'yes there is on in every room' When i corrected her again she asked me what room i was in and said we will point it out for you tomorrow. There wasn't a QR code on that mirror. I also had issues with my room key not working, which is fine, I just went down to reception to sort out the issues, when I mentioned it's not working, i heard a snigger from the other receptionist at the other desk, then when i walk away i turned back to see both receptionist looking at me with a smirk on their face. It was just really unpleasant and not a nice environment. I wouldn't recommend.",2,2023,04,05
240,Best hotel we stayed in while traveling Europe,"I don‚Äôt usually call out people by name in my reviews but the GM needs to know.  While every employee at this hotel showed great customer service, there are three that stood out. At check in we were greeted by Jan ( Italian woman with long brown hair). Every time we passed by the front desk she greeted us with a smile and hello.  Then there were Axel in the restaurant & Phillipe at the front desk. Both were also outstanding in their field of work.

As for the hotel, the GM keeps it working in tip top fashion.  There wasn‚Äôt a thing out of place, carpets looked fresh and clean, and like clock work you knew exactly when the tiles in the lobby were being polished daily.

Now if I had to knit pick, everyone at the bar was super friendly and nice.  But‚Ä¶ you don‚Äôt put Blanco Sweet Vermouth in a dry martini. I asked for an olive and got a lemon twist.  The bartender was super nice about it and tried again but in the end, I had a Guinness.  When in Rome, do as the Romans do‚Ä¶

But overall I would definitely stay here again and recommend it.  Great job!",5,2023,04,01
240,Great location with parking and good links into Dublin City Centre,"Great location with parking and good links into Dublin City Centre. 

First class Reception Staff and Deputy Manager who sorted a problem with the TV very promptly. 

The Tempura Fish and Chips in the Cinnamon Restaurant were probably the best I had in a long while. 

As a Gold member the drinks vouchers were a very welcome surprise.

When visiting Dublin again would definitely check in here again.

240,Excellent welcome,"The leisure centre in the basement has a gym, pool, hot tub, sauna and steam room. So handy to rejuvenate after a long flight. Breakfast was delicious, full Irish, with lots of healthy options added, fruit, yoghurt,  good variety of bakery and bread products..  ",5,2023,02,05
240,Avoid if you want a good nights sleep,"This was a very disappointing stay at the Hilton, Dublin. I booked a superior king room and couldn‚Äôt sleep. The amenities in the room were basic and not worth the room rate. There was scaffolding by the side of the room which made loud noises during the night and as it rained hard, it sounded like pans clashing outside of the room. I couldn‚Äôt get to sleep until 1.30am. To add to further disruptions, a false fire alarm woke many people at 4.30am. Superior king rooms are located by the road right besides heavy traffic which is again noisy. A very poor nights sleep overall which effected my concentration during my business meetings due to lack of sleep. The same was experienced by my 2 colleagues who stayed at the same hotel. When we complained on check-out there was no apology by the front desk staff and no acknowledgement of my complaint. 

Upon exiting the carpark the gates were locked and my colleagues and I had to make a phone call to reception to ask them to open this, connecting to the reception took 10mins and delayed our journey to our business meetings. Again no acknowledgement or pre warning from the hotel reception desk. 

My colleagues and I had dinner in the broyage bar and bistro. The calamari was greasy and the chicken supreme was tasteless and dry. A disappointing dinner. 

Considering we selected this hotel due to convenience of location for our important business meetings, we were left angry and frustrated as a result of the lack of sleep and hospitality.

Please note my colleagues and I are all Hilton honours members and frequent Dublin often for business. We will not be staying at the Hilton‚Äôs in Dublin again for any personal or business purposes. ",2,2023,01,26
240,Best Customer Service in the City,"I arrived in Dublin late in the evening after visiting several cities across Canada and the UK. When I arrived at the Hilton Dublin Kilmainham I was exhausted and overwhelmed. The front desk staff were extraordinarily friendly and welcoming and went above and beyond to ensure that I was quickly checked in and could settle in my room. In particular, Felipe, who I believe is a manager at this location, was absolutely wonderful. We enjoyed our stay so much that when we returned to Dublin twelve days later to fly out, we booked here again despite having already made plans to stay a bit closer to the airport.

This hotel has wonderful amenities, is perfectly located, and has the best hospitality in the city of Dublin--quite the accomplishment for a city so well known for its hospitality! I would book at the Hilton Dublin Kilmainham again in a heartbeat. Thanks to all who made our stay so memorable!",5,2023,01,19

240,A really great hotel for regular stays in Dublin,"Having stayed in this hotel almost on a monthly basis since October 2021, I almost feel compelled to write this end-of-year review for this great hotel and its wonderful staff. From the very beginning, I have only ever booked directly with the Reservations staff and Judit, Sara and Laura have always been so helpful! No matter when I needed to book a room, they would arrange it as efficiently as possible. Check-in and check-out are always quick and no fuss - and no matter which staff are on duty, they are always so welcoming, professional and efficient (Felipe and Sabrina, in particular). Phil (the Deputy General Manager) is also so welcoming, polite and helpful. Jack in the restaurant also deserves a shout-out. Thank you and Happy New Year to you all! ",5,2023,01,05
240,Decent spot,This was our second time staying .. having stayed last Christmas time also. I felt this time it just didn‚Äôt quite hit the mark as prior. As a Hilton gold member last time we arrived we got a little gift on arrival which was a lovely touch and also our parking charge was waived‚Ä¶ as a thank you for being gold. No such nice touches this time around. The food was good in the bar area .. no complaints there. Breakfast was also very good. Thought the pool was a bit tired this time around in particular the changing area was a bit rub down and grubby. All in all it was a good stay but just lacked the little touches from the first visit,3,2022,12,31
240,Hilton Kilmainham,"Exceptional location, beautiful hotel, friendly helpful staff, safe clean rooms, delicious food. Overall a diamond very close to the centre. The views from the deluxe room are amazing. The food was scrumptious, we got room service and the breakfast was something else, fruit, cereals, pastries, juice, coffee and an Irish fry.",5,2022,12,24

240,average stay,No bathrobes for the spa. The spa was also not operational the weekend we were there which is why we initially booked this hotel. The service in the restaurant was so incredibly slow. We were left waiting for a considerable time before anyone would serve us or take our drinks order. There was a huge fight on our second night which woke us up.,3,2022,12,06

240,Hilton Hotel Kilmainham,"The Hilton in Kilmainham was the best hotel we stayed in. The staff went out of their way to help us sever times. I can not praise them enough especially, Feilpe who is one in a million, he organised flower & chocolate for my mothers birthday  , Ray who brought pancakes to our kids in the morning & the bar staff who specially made unusual food orders at 12.00 pm last night. We will definitely be back !!!!!!",5,2022,12,03

240,One night at the Hilton,"Arrived early at the Hilton, was greeted by a lovely receptionist.  Our room wasnt ready so we went into the bar.  She arrived shortly after with a key for the 5th floor.  Went up to the room but got panicy as it had floor to ceiling window.  Lovely for someone who likes heights.  Had to go back to reception and no problem got a room on the 1st floor.  The staff in this hotel were helpful and friendly.  We had food in the bar and it was lovely.  We werent sure about getting to places and enquired at reception and the staff were very helpful.  Arriving in our room after dining we discovered TV had only one chanel.  Immediately the manager came up - TV wouldnt tune in so he went off and got a new one.  
Great buffet for breakfast lots of variety.  Surprised to see people had dogs in the hotel but they didnt bother us - so ideal if you want to bring doggie along.  The rooms were spotless and comfortable and staff were lovely - highly recommend.",5,2022,11,16
240,A great Hilton dublin experience,"Very good Hilton hotel. Clean, nice staff and very helpful desk staff. Restaurant is good enough for the price and breakfast buffet is excellent.  Parking is in the underground garage with a separate area for hotel guests away from the public/ living well parking lot.  Overnight rate is ‚Ç¨14 euros which can be added to you bill at reception 
Free EV charging point available at back of the car park - be careful as spaces are very tight.  Speed is only 3kw so slow but it is free - hopefully in the future they‚Äôll add 7kw points and in several bays - would be very useful and I‚Äôd be willing to pay for the convenience as I‚Äôm sure would many of the electric car drivers I saw parked in the garage.
Overall a great experience, we‚Äôd hope to be back",5,2022,11,13
240,Hilton Kilmainham grows on you..,"This was my fourth visit this year. Every visit was one to remember. Reception staff was great (Thanks Felipe, Maria, Barbera), friendly, helpful and always smiling. The bar staff was just as awesome! Service was great, drinks were served with a big smile and a story here and there. It felt like we were in our own living room. Breakfast offered enough choice. Parking spots were always available. Will return soon hopefully",5,2022,11,09
240,Overpriced and not very high standard,Not a very great experience booked for partners birthday and paid additional for balloons and prosseco and chocolates what a waste of money and service wasn‚Äôt very good for the cost wouldn‚Äôt return based on this experience ,1,2022,11,08
240,Look no further,"Everything is a hit and the Hotel Kilmainhman. From check-in, with an efficient yet friendly front desk person, to the bar, where they knew how to make cocktails (Negronis and gin&tonics), everyone at the restaurant to the people who made our room ‚Äî everyone executed perfectly and made our experience in Dublin something to literally write home about. They did not seem to have a concierge, like most 5-star business hotels, but the did not need one: the super-nice people at the front desk knew everything and happily gave detailed directions.",5,2022,11,08
240,Silver anniversary break.,"Superb Hotel. Wouldn‚Äôt stay anywhere else if we visit again!
From start to finish the staff couldn‚Äôt be more helpful and friendly. 
Excellent room, clean, modern with all facilities needed and branded toiletries. Our room cleaned everyday with fresh linen supplied. The bed was the comfiest I‚Äôve slept on in a very long time and the breakfast was really good. 
A very happy customer and the hotel complimented our Silver anniversary brilliantly. 
Thank you very much everyone!",5,2022,11,06
240,Definitely will not disappoint!,"Excellent hotel. From the rooms to the staff to the facilties, this hotel has yet to disappoint and it was our 4th trip back there. It is easy to access, has parking and is 10 mins walk from the luas or 25 min walk into the centre passing the Guinness Brewery among other places to see. Walking distance to Phoenix Park and the zoo. Across from the IMMA and Bully's Acre as well as Kilmainham Gaol so loads to do. The staff cannot be complimented enough from running to get the door for us to bring in a buggy to getting us baby bowls to our room for our smallie. The pool facilities are second to none and easily accessed. We look forward to returning again next year! ",5,2022,10,31
240,Excellent stay!,"Excellent hotel in a great location with underground parking available. Our room was spacious, very comfortable and spotlessly clean. 
On entering the reception area of the hotel, we were greeted by a huge warm and welcoming smile from Felipe. Throughout our 3 night stay, Felipe was so polite, friendly and very knowledgable and informative. He answered all our questions without any apprehension. 
Another member of staff who provided a very professional, friendly and overall excellent service was Catherine in the restaurant. Like Felipe, she was very welcoming and helpful at all times, even when it was extremely busy at breakfast time. The choice of both hot and cold food at breakfast was excellent. 
We ate in the bar twice, where staff were very helpful and friendly also. There was a good and varied choice of food on the menu and our personal choice of dishes were delicious. 
We enjoyed all aspects of our stay so much that we have already planned another stay at the hotel!!",5,2022,10,28
240,"Fabulous service, lovely hotel.","We have just returned from a stay at the Hilton Kilmainham, travelling as a couple, from the 21//10 - 24/10. 
Our flight was a very early morning one, and therefore we arrived at the hotel at around 10.30am. To my surprise they had our room ready for us on arrival, ( I wasn't expecting a room until maybe 2 o clock, the typical check in time)
The lady on the front desk ( I didn't get her name, but she had long dark hair) was very polite and helpful. She checked whether I was a Hilton honors member, I thought I might have been as I am a travel agent and have stayed in a few Hiltons. I wasn't, so she set me up for discounts for future travel. She was very informative in telling us when breakfast was, and also about the hotels gym / swimming pool facilities. 
We went up to our room and found it to be immaculately clean, and were impressed with the fact you get full size toiletries in the bathroom, good tea and coffee making facilities, nice towels etc. The room is well laid out and has everything you would need, only small gripe is that you only have a few tv channels to choose from on the Tv, we probably should have brought an Ipad. The beds are sooo comfortable, and has THE best pillows, mine at home now seem awful!!
We used the pool one evening, it was easy to book a slot, and although its not a huge pool, it was a nice chill out after a long day. Also used the Sauna and steam room too which were nice. 
The room was cleaned both Saturday and Sunday, and was done really well, sheets changed, fresh towels and spotless. Front desk were always happy to help, we called though one evening whilst out and asked to order some drinks on our return and that was no trouble, they also booked us taxis and held our luggage the last day whilst we went for some lunch.
The hotel is well located and although it is a little out of the centre, we quite liked that. We used the Dublin bikes and cycled in each day, they are only 3 euros 50 for the day, and no charge at all if you use them for under half hour at a time. The ride in was only 15 mins and you can cut through the park opposite the hotel which is really pretty. Theres a pub opposite too, which I believe has an Italian restaurant, although we didn't visit it. There's a spa just down the road, which was handy too, and a restaurant in the other direction which we ate at twice and really enjoyed the food. 
We can't speak for the food in the hotel as we didn't eat there, but the menu looked good. Would also recommend visiting the jail opposite the hotel, we couldn't get a tour as they were full but did the museum and it was really interesting!
Overall, I would definitely stay again!",5,2022,10,27
240,"Excellent hotel, great location","Excellent hotel, great location excellent service the staff was really welcoming and very helpful. Taxis were on time and friendly.
stores are nearby restaurants are nearby excellent excellent location. It‚Äôs in front of the Kilmainham jail Museum, close to city Cente Close to temple bar area. Safe safe location",5,2022,10,14
240,Will return,"The hotel is in a great location. Close to train station and easy walk in to the city.
Rooms were very comfortable and spacious. 
All staff I met were so friendly and helpful. Good food, with nice menu selection.
Would love to come and stay here again with family.",5,2022,10,07
240,Very very pleasantly surprised!,"We (Wife, 1 year old and I) visited as a short city break. The hotel itself was much better than I expected (the photos don‚Äôt do it justice) and the front desk team (Felipe et al) were a real point of note. From the moment we checked in - they were hugely accommodating and helpful. Could not have asked for more from them and next time we plan on visiting they will be a real pull factor! Rooms were great, facilities good, pool was excellent. Only point for improvement would be the restaurant which was a let down; both quality and service below what you would expect given the price point. The breakfast was great however. Rating 5/5 on the assumption that the restaurant for dinner is a separate franchise, otherwise that would have been one bad mark on an otherwise perfect scorecard!",5,2022,10,05
240,Best location in Dublin,"Great hotel right next to Kilmainham prison and walking distance to Guinness! Taxi ride to airport or library was easy!  Pool in the hotel, along with steam room and hot tub was awesome! Breakfast was awesome as well!",5,2022,10,01
240,Best Hilton experience ever,"We stayed for 11 nights at the Hilton. Every single staff person from maid to front desk and in between is so nice. The breakfast is either hot or cold, from eggs/sausages to cold cuts to breads to cold cereal, plus you can order 3 other hot things from the kitchen. We had drinks from the bar every night. There is an outdoor open-air area or an indoor area for food and drink in the evening. There is parking available but there is charge to park. The location of this property is perfect if you want to see historic type things in Dublin. We really didn't realize that when we made the reservation, but it was a perfect location to get to a lot of the attractions. You can either take a cab (and they will call one for you) or you can walk about 4 blocks to an above ground train (streetcar) to the main area of attractions. There are also several restaurants in the area. If I ever come back to Dublin, I will stay here. And I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2022,10,01
240,Average,"Mixed review here. I‚Äôll start with the good- staff were nice and friendly, room was nice little bit outdated but ok.  Didn‚Äôt eat here but drinks reasonable. Easy bus route into city.
Couple of issues.  Be careful with booking website. Our price per night was quoted in euro so when we checked out the cost was ¬£30 more than expected due to the exchange rate.  There is a small pool/ steam/ sauna area. You have to book. The first morning we booked for 9am then told we couldn‚Äôt go in the pool as the babies were having a swimming class.  The second morning went down at 10 and the pool was rammed with kids so couldn‚Äôt get in. ¬£520 for 2 nights so paid for the location really and nothing special about this hotel.",3,2022,09,29
240,Lovely hotel,This hotel is in a quieter area across from the Kilmainham Geol. The room was lovely and beds were wonderful. The staff was helpful in explaining how to catch a bus for the city centre. Breakfast was a good selection.,5,2022,09,21
240,Felipe - best front desk person on the planet. Will always pick this hotel when visiting Dublin,"Scrambling to make a funeral in Dublin, I totally messed up our reservation. On arrival, Felipe greeted us, recognized the issues and sorted them out in minutes. Since we were exhausted from our overnight BOS-DUB flignt he arranged an early check-in and was a font of local information and support throughout our stay. Felipe was the total package - professional, friendly, efficient, and kind. Sara, also at front desk, was very helpful as well. The breakfast (and dining room staff) were first class.
This is a hotel operating at the top standard of Hiltons I've stayed in over the years, will always be a top pick for Dublin visits in the future",5,2022,09,05
240,Disappointing,"The hotel lobby and restaurant are nice but I booked the room with points and I didn't feel like I was treated very well.  When I arrived, I realized I failed to request handicap accommodations for my wife who has difficulty with her balance. They put us in a room that was not renovated and has a bath tub.  They said they could not move us so I asked for a shower chair.  They simply ignored my request and didn't even call to say they didn't have anything that could help.  The couple we came with had a very nice and newly renovated room that had a shower that was safe for my wife so she had to use their shower.   If we return we will not stay at this hotel.",2,2022,08,28
240,Excellent Hotel Choice for Dublin,"Just a 10 minute taxi ride or 20 minute walk to the Temple Bar area and central Dublin, this hotel has all the modern amenities, a good restaurant with outdoor seating and a nice draught beer selection.  My room was very clean, quite large with a very comfortable bed, A/C, fridge and view of the Kilmainham Jail museum and entrance to the military park located immediately outside the hotel.  Staff are very friendly and helpful as are most people in Ireland",5,2022,08,23
240,Great alternative location,"We usually stay in the centre of Dublin, but thought we‚Äôd try something different this trip. Very pleased with the alternative - well appointed, light spacious room (310) overlooking the park and a good breakfast offering. The staff were very friendly and helpful staff, and taxis were readily available, although several sights (including Kilmainham Gail, IMMA and the beautiful Memorial Garden) are within easy walking distance. Well worth booking a session in the hotel pool with its spa jets and steam room, only don‚Äôt take any valuables as the lockers need padlocks  - also swimming hats are required even for short hair - nylon ones are available from the gym reception at a nominal price - not required for the folic-ally challenged!",4,2022,08,15
240,Wonderful stay,"The staff at the hotel were so welcoming and friendly. On check-in they gave our 2 year old a gift box which he was thrilled with! Our room was 234, it was spacious and bright with a great view of the city. We also really appreciated having a shower and a bathtub.  The highlight was the breakfast! So much food to choose from and all great. Highly recommend the overnight oats - delish!
The loss of star comes from disappointment with the pool. It's very small and cold, even the hot tub had cold spots. The sauna was also out of order.",4,2022,08,09
240,Perfect post zoo hotel,"I stayed here with my wife and two year old daughter after visiting Dublin zoo. Staff, Bedroom, Breakfast, Pool and Parking were all excellent. I have no negative points to make and will be returning after my next trip to the zoo",5,2022,08,07
240,"Very comfortable stay, friendly staff","Had very good stay. Only for a night. Check in and check out we‚Äôre smooth. Staff members were friendly and very helpful. Room was spacious and comfortable. Bed was comfortable and had a very good nights sleep. Only issue was that there were a few hairs on the floor and in the bathroom. So, cleanliness needs to improve.",4,2022,08,07
240,Needs to up its game,"I‚Äôm writing this on the terrace and I can hardly think for the super loud, thumping disco music that seems totally inappropriate for this hotel. After a hard days work this is the last thing my head needs and I can‚Äôt get away from it because it is inside too. 

My welcome to the hotel was far from friendly - no welcome smile. I was just asked for my name. And when my room key stopped working - twice - there was no apology, simply an accusation that I must have been carrying it next to my phone. 

My room is very clean and smart with a very comfy bed. But the air conditioning has been set at 19 degrees each day which actually makes it very chilly. Not great for climate change and it meant I was cold in bed under a very thin duvet. 

The hotel also loses stars for me because it is still using small plastic shampoo and conditioner bottles. Come on Hilton, buck up your environmental credentials!  

I also had a problem when I tried to put my meal bill on the room and was quite rudely told by a grumpy barman that there wasn‚Äôt a credit card against my room. There was. I had previously paid for drinks that way but he was having none of it!  I have to say though that the other staff were all very friendly and helpful. 

This could be a great hotel but it is the little things that matter.",3,2022,08,04
240,"A perfectly good stay, in a decent hotel, but a little far out of the city centre.","Nice enough hotel, but a 15 Euro taxi ride from the city centre. However, it is opposite Kimainhaim Gaol, which is worth a visit and not too far from the Guinness factory, which I would definitely recommend!

As a HH Diamond member, I was upgraded to a king superior room, which was spacious, comfortable and nicely appointed. I was also given two drinks vouchers for each night of my stay, which I used to sample several of the draught beers in the bar! Unusually for a hotel bar/restaurant, there was a really good, large selection of cask and draught beer and the bar tenders were very knowledgeable and accommodating in describing said libations and offering a sample of each before purchasing. Top marks! The food was also really good, with a large selection, cooked fresh, decent portion sizes and good, fast service. Breakfast was also ample and the usual Hilton fare, as expected.
Overall, I wouldn't have second thoughts about staying again and would recommend as long as you don't mind being in a non central location.

240,Excelente op√ß√£o em Dublin,"Excellent hotel in a quiet neighborhood of Dublin not far from the centre. Spacious and well-equipped rooms and bathroom, extremely comfortable beds and all facilities. Perfect cleaning too.
We also enjoyed the meals offered on the room service menu. In addition to the wide variety of dishes, the portions are very generous and our orders arrived quickly.
A major highlight is the very attentive service provided by the entire team (reception, restaurant, room service and maids), especially Alan and Vini, who were very helpful and kind.

My only suggestion would be for a little more variety in the breakfast buffet. Would go back again for sure!",5,2022,07,26
240,Great stay in a wonderful hotel,"Had a great stay recently at this hotel . What a wonderful pool area and Jacuzzi which used plenty of times during my 10 nights stay.  You will need to wear a swimming cap whilst using the pool area. Great cleaning from the cleaning staff . Located nearby to Dublin zoo and the kilmainham goal jail and with the Imma irish Museum of Morden of art across the road . Not too far of a walk for to get the bus into the city centre bus 40 and 13 . Great pizza üçï takeaway called four star ‚≠êÔ∏è pizza . With two restaurants in walking distance from the hotel called urban 8 and la dolce vita and italian above the patriots inn pub . Also two pubs with in walking distance the patriots inn which also does food and also the olde Royal Oak . Also a shopping area with a lovely natural bakery and a euro spa too which is a great shop and also if walk other way there‚Äôs another spa a much smaller one then the euro spa . 

The euro spa even has a post office in it too . And the imma has a lovely downstairs cafe called the flying dog .
Which is a lovely little cafe .",4,2022,07,26
240,Excellent hotel on do many levels,"Can't write enough about the Hilton in Dublin. Clean, excellent service, courteous and helpful staff. Quality and variety breakfast buffet. Close to everything. Highly recommend for safe and enjoyable stay ",5,2022,07,22
240,It was good,"Our King room was compact and a little cramped with furniture but beautifully decorated.  The bathrooms were also very small, but again beautifully decorated..

The pool is a fantastic but it circle shaped so don't expect to be doing lengths.  The sauna and steam room were great as well.  I didn't like the showers at LivingWell though... they are push button showers that automatically turn off after about 5 seconds so you constantly have to push the button to keep the water flowing.

The breakfast was standard hotel fayre and was very  tasty.  Worth the ‚Ç¨16 per person that we paid.

For dinner we went to the bar and both had the fish and chips which was lovely.  Dessert was amazing.  They also have alcohol-free beer on draught which is hard to come by in Ireland.  I loved it.

Finally all the staff were lovely.",3,2022,07,22
240,Dublin Hilton Kilmainham,Nice hotel just outside of city center.  Very clean and comfortable room.  Polite and courteous staff.  Nice onsite restaurant with quality Irish menu and an above average breakfast offering.  Right across the street from Kilmainham Gaol and just down the road from the Guiness factory.  Easy taxi service to and from.  Quiet area.,4,2022,07,12
240,Fantastic Family function in the Hilton Dublin Kilmainham,"We celebrated a family birthday and anniversary with an extended group in the Hilton Kilmainham on July 2nd.

The assistance in the organising the event in advance was excellent.

On the night the hospitality and service provided by the Hilton Team and the quality of the meal served were both absolutely fantastic and I would thoroughly recommend this venue to anybody considering a location for a simiiar event.",5,2022,07,06
240,Great hotel in a convenient location,Wonderful and comfortable stay in a great part of Dublin. The rooms are a really good size with all the amenities you would expect from a leading hotel chain. The beds are extremely comfortable and the bathrooms are functional in size. The restaurant is pretty good too!,4,2022,06,30
240,Wonderful Stay at Hilton Dublin Kilmainham,"My recent stay at Hilton Dublin Kilmainham with my wife Mahajabin in June 2022 was enjoyable as I celebrated Mahajabin's birthday on 19-June honored by the hotel management. My heartfelt thanks and appreciation to the management team for their excellent service, hospitality and warm welcoming. 
I take the privilege to express my gratitude to both Dora and Barbara, the front office staff for their warm welcoming as well as nicely upgrading our room to suite room that has a nice view and other international facilities. My special thanks to them for their good understanding about Hilton honors profile (particularly I being a Diamond member) and professionalism with their good intent of due diligence and hospitality towards guests. Dora was keen in giving us an overview on places of interest in Dublin and shared worthwhile information about most touristic historical and cultural sites to visit while Barbara is extremely familiar and has good knowledge about brand shopping places, particularly Brown Thomas Center. Both staffs are very humble, enthusiastic with positivity. They deserve my deepest appreciation.
The hotel restaurant is in cozy place, we liked it. The dinner was good. Breakfast facility in the restaurant has been nice. There was not enough choice for us to eat such as chicken/beef sausages, boiled eggs or hot omelets except pork sausages those we do not eat. However, I must appreciate that the restaurant staff, were so keen and generous in serving fried chicken with Spanish egg omelets instead of pork sausages that was a nice gesture. 
Importantly, the hotel lacks an appropriate luxury lobby place with good sitting sofas, couches and tables. Any guest can easily notice insufficient space for a lobby and will not like it as we did. Frankly, the present lobby does not meet Hilton international standard. The management should seriously think for its improvement and modernization.  
In fine, our stay at this property was enjoyable. We will certainly come again in Dublin and stay more at this hotel.

240,Another Fantastic stay,"This is our ""go to"" hotel in Dublin.  While it away from the business area, it is quiet and has a fantastic staff.  Many flights from the US are at night and ours was no exception.  We arrived at the hotel at7:00 am local time and we were grateful that a room as available!  We noticed other sleepy Americans having the same luck.  The staff was very friendly and super helpful.  We had many great tips as to how to get around and good recommendations.  The hotel was spotless, the beds very comfortable and the bathroom as very clean.  Meals were great and the breakfast buffet was varied and tasty.  Just another great stay at a great value.  Wi-Fi was fast and free.  We will definitely stay here again on our next trip to Dublin",5,2022,06,17
240,Amazing hotel,"We were blown away with the level of service and cleanliness of the hotel.  Everything was of such a high standard.  Front desk staff were extremely helpful.  The best breakfast I've have at a hotel EVER!  Rooms were very clean and comfortable.  Everyone is friendly.  10 min drive to the city centre- cabs are a nightmare though.  Perfect location for sightseeing if you dont mind a little walk.  20 mins to the Guinness factory, 20 mins to the zoo and 10 to the train station. Quite pricy but you get what you pay for.  Lovely spa/ hydro pool.  Those with long hair need a swim hat.  These are provided at the pool. ",5,2022,06,07
240,Thank you Felipe,"Felipe was amazing during our stay at Hilton Dublin Kilmainham in May 2022. I can‚Äôt say enough good about him. He is so friendly, helpful and professional. Thank you for an incredible customer experience. He is a real asset to Hilton Hotels.",5,2022,05,26
240,Awful restaurant service,"Restaurant Times on Hilton website say 11.30pm. However we arrived at 10pm and were told the kitchen was closed and that the bar would stop serving drinks at 1030!! And staff could not advise of any where close by to get food. 

Hotel room wise - not worth the price you‚Äôre paying. Just under 400/night for a mediocre room with the bathroom door wood peeling off‚Ä¶",1,2022,05,22

They are pure magic!",5,2022,05,07
240,Could have been excellent but ....,"Had a drink here when we visited Kilmainham Gaol in 2018 and liked the location away from the crowds in the city centre

Check-in was first class and we had an excellent suite so it was a pity that the service was so slovenly when we had a drink in the afternoon. This was repeated when we arrived for dinner and a young man indicated that we could sit anywhere we liked and couldn't be bothered to show us to our table. Sadly, he made a less than professional impression. It was also a pity that the kitchen didn't seem to be familiar with the concept of ""flash frying"" which meant that a steak sandwich had to be sent back as it was inedible. The person who dealt with this unfortunate hiccup was very professional and the rest of our stay was fine",4,2022,05,01

240,Stunning hotel,"First impressions count and that being said Maria and Sara wow you girls are fantastic. I have stayed in many 5* hotels before and you both were up there with the best welcome I've ever received. The rooms were immaculate and large with stunning views over the museum. I couldn't fault the hotel in anyway shape or form. 
Those that are saying its to far out of town, its really not you can hop on tye tram and be in town within 10 minutes or enjoy a walk through the museum ground and be in town in 15 minutes. What you get what other hotels don't offer is quiet, quality hotel which if was smack in the middle of town wouldn't be able to offer what it does. 
The only criticism I have and I hope you use this as constructive was that the bar staff could have been more attentative when ordering drinks and food. Apart from that it really is a stunning hotel and I would stay there again in a heartbeat.

P.S I hoped you enjoyed the doughnuts.",5,2022,04,23
240,Excellent staff,"I stayed at this hotel for several months while working in Dublin and the staff made my stay perfect. Felipe and his colleagues on reception welcomed me back each week with genuine  warmth and friendliness, it was a pleasure to stay there for that alone.",5,2022,04,21
240,Overall stay was decent.,"Overall the stay was good. The bed was comfortable. The room was clean. 
We did find the half shower door in the bathroom strange and it caused a lot of water to get on the floor while showering. 
The breakfast was average. For someone who doesn‚Äôt eat eggs (me) there weren‚Äôt any options other then bread and pastries. 
The restaurant was good. It has a very small menu. 
My biggest complaint was that I was overcharged. I discovered it in checking my credit card the night before we left. I questioned it that night and was given an explanation and told someone new was working and did the overcharge. The next morning when we checked out I did speak with a manager who explained everything and gave me an itemized bill. They did give us some drink vouchers for the bar the night I discovered the issue as well as covering my parking for my stay. 
Overall it was decent although a bit further from downtown then we initially thought.",4,2022,04,19
240,Nice stay,The hotel is clean and has very nice staff. The breakfast was delicious. The location is quiet but not too far from the center of Dublin. The tram (Luas) is within 10min walking distance. For there it's another 10min ride to the center of Dublin. ,5,2022,04,17
240,Expected more from a Hilton,"Hilton may want to rebrand this one as one of their lesser hotels.  While the rooms were everything you would expect from the Hilton brand, the staff were very dour.  We were half heartedly greeted.  When asked for directions, restaurant recommendations or any other information none was provided. The restaurant servers were just ok. No one was overly friendly or went one inch out of their way to make your stay extra special.",3,2022,04,16

Food at the Bar could be improved, brother had salmon but they forgot the mussels, you could tell it was then reheated and mussels added.
Breakfast buffet , you could order eggs,asked for a small omelette, huge one came , waitress said it‚Äôs all one size! What a waste! Why no fish option?
Yes I would return!",4,2022,04,15

240,Very good Hotel,This is a very good and quiet hotel although it is located in a very busy road. The location is not very close to the city center but it is also not far. The staff is very welcoming and helpful. The food quality is also very good but need more variety for the breakfast buffet and dinner. ,4,2022,03,28
240,Great hotel,"We came to stay here for the st Patrick‚Äôs day celebrations and I could not fault the hotel. It was clean, nicely decorated and the staff were very helpful and friendly. We were about a 20 minute walk into temple bar and it was nice to be a bit further away for the loud nightlife. The breakfast was nice and so was the bar at the hotel. It is opposite the old kilmainham gaol as well so definitely worth a visit.",5,2022,03,22
240,Excellent,"A very enjoyable stay at this hotel . General manager Kevin and his team do a great job  , special thanks to Felipe for first class service.
Location is good for Dublin and local attractions , eg museum of modern art .

Food at Broyage restaurant in the hotel was great and there‚Äôs a lot of variety in the menu to choose from. 
Front desk staff are amazing. Jos√©, Desiree and Felipe looked after us very well during all our stay and Felipe even sorted a small issue with our billing in the nicest way possible. 
Nice to have a pool in the hotel to relax and a gym available too. Highly recommended. Thank you!",5,2022,03,02
240,Fabulous Hotel,"Fabulous stay at the Hilton Kilmainham the service was supreme We had an fantastic stay. Great location, all food was fantastic, and staff were all so friendly. Our room was very clean and well maintained.",5,2022,02,14
240,Highest class staff!,"I am a local and had to hold my exams somewhere away from my home in silence. I am so happy my husband chose this hotel, I was given a really quiet room and they accommodated me holding a second part of the exam when I already have checked out. 

I worked in hospitality for 12 years and I can tell you one thing - all of the staff are top class. Nowadays, it‚Äôs hard to find good service since covid happened, many staff around town wouldn‚Äôt be trained enough, but in Hilton everyone seemed to be knowing exactly what they are doing, wether is waiting staff, reception or the room service staff. 

Love it. Room was super clean, really nice hot water (I love really hot baths) breakfast was nice and fresh, same with bar menu, it‚Äôs much bigger than the one you can find online. 

I especially would like to thank Sara and Felipe and other receptionists for such warm welcoming and helping me to get the best solution to of my situation. 

If I ever need to stay in Dublin again, I won‚Äôt think twice.",5,2022,02,05
240,Family stay,"The hotel was very clean, rooms spotless. Great location for visiting Dublin, with parking a bonus. Our son enjoyed the pool, but the female changing room was freezing. Dinner in the bistro was nice with lovely attentive staff. At breakfast we had to move one chair as we were placed at a table with that chair on the tiles near the breakfast buffet. The room was actually mostly empty at that time. Spanish reception staff were lovely, and helped up with request about public transport. The IMMA gardens just at the door are beautiful for a post breakfast stroll. ",4,2022,01,24
240,Lovely hotel...skip the restaurant!,"The hotel is lovely....Great decor, lovely rooms. Excellent check in experience from Josh!
The restaurant is mayhem....will not go into a litany of complaints. The staff are disorganised, untrained and careless. The organisation of breakfast is much better. All food pleasant except the pancakes, which were nit freshly made. Lovely service at breakfast from Paula!",4,2022,01,18
240,Great dog friendly hotel on edge of city centre,"We stayed for 3 nights with our dog, the hotel was excellent. The room was comfortable, large and clean. The service in the hotel was great, particularly Raj and Megan in the bar. We also liked the hydrotherapy pool.",5,2022,01,09
240,Abound and beyond.,"This is my second stay at this hotel in as many months. I‚Äôve found my go to hotel for trips to Dublin. Desiree on reception worth a special mention for going above and beyond the call of duty.  Thanks for taking the time to watch my car. 
This is a great hotel with great staff. Too class.",5,2022,01,06
240,Delightful family stay,"We booked an overnight stay for 2 adults and 2 children. We were attending the Wildlights at Dublin Zoo so wanted somewhere close to hand. At check in we were greeted  by a lovely guy called Felipe who checked us in and asked us how our journey was and if we had a good Christmas. He even took time to talk with the kids. We had interconnecting rooms on the 2nd floor with a fabulous view overlooking Kilmainham Gaol. Room was spacious, well decorated and beds were very comfortable. I would definitely recommend interconnecting rooms for a family, just gives you more space plus the kids loved having their own TV and bathroom. Dinner and Breakfast was lovely. Kids enjoyed the pool. Overall a beautiful hotel with friendly and welcoming staff. We we wouldn't hesitate to return here.",5,2022,01,03
240,Winter Stay,"Had a lovely night in the hotel, very friendly and helpful staff at reception and in the bar throughout the day and night. Fantastic spacious rooms with views. We had breakfast and used the pool and had parking on site too which was great to have. Will be back again in the future!",5,2022,01,03
240,Fantastic Hotel,"We stayed in the Hilton Kilmainham on the 2nd of January, we were travelling as a family, Grandmother, daughter & two strapping grandsons. From the moment we entered the hotel until we left we were treated with the utmost courtesy & friendliness!! We had two rooms which were a godsend, the rooms were massive & the beds so comfortable! We had dinner in Broyage & it was absolutely delicious. The pool is amazing too.  Huge thanks to Felix & all the staff for making our stay so memorable, we will be back!!‚Äô",5,2022,01,03
240,Card only,"Disappointed not to be given the choice to pay by cash.
They say it‚Äôs because of covid but I‚Äôve a feeling it will be permanent.
In Dublin often and stayed here twice in the second half of 2021 and would probably stay elsewhere in future because of this issue.",2,2021,12,31
240,Very Nice Hotel,"The hotel was very nice. We ate in the restaurant that night and it was delicious as well as the full Irish breakfast the next am.
A big plus is walking directly across the street to tour the Kilmainham prison. Then across the opposite street is a lovely walk though a big park.",5,2021,12,28
240,Darren kinsella,Fantastic hotel staff very polite especially felipe on the front desk cant thank him enough for looking after me got the king suite best room iv ever been in booked for my sister for next week felipe helped me with that thanks again,5,2021,12,28
240,Another Welcoming & Safe Stay,"Third time staying here at Kilmainham and it has not let us down yet. The hotel is ideally located for closeness to Dublin City Centre as well as the main arterial roads. 
From the moment we arrived we felt the welcome with Fileppe on reception who went out of his way to assist and set us up for an enjoyable stay. 
The Hotel is just a few minutes walk to the Pheonix Park which houses the Presidents residenece and the Dublin Zoo. 
We hosted friends and family there and the staff were very attentive, checking covid vaccines, providing good space and matching this with friendly service. 
There is access to the pool and car parking too.",5,2021,12,26

240,Fantastic,Really fantastic hotel! From arrival this was just what we needed. Fillipe on front desk could not have been more helpful. Lovely touch on the kids boxes checking in. Also the room was very clean and modern with lovely view over to the gaol. Felt extremely safe as covid certs checked at bar and breakfast. Food in bar was very good and again great for kids as they were given little colouring packs which was much appreciated. The breakfast was fantastic and loved that everything wrapped in these pandemic times‚Ä¶. Also there was a lot of choice . We did the leisure centre too and the pool was great for family and socially distanced! Great proximity to Dublin zoo. We walked there and the staff helped us with the route. We will definitely be back here! Staff fantastic and so friendly!!! Can‚Äôt wait to return. Thanks again to all for a fantastic pre Christmas trip,5,2021,12,19

240,Brilliant stay in my favourite city. ,"Absolutely brilliant from check in to check out. Front office staff on arrival were so friendly and were spot on with all the Covid protocols. We didn't eat in the hotel(Dublin has so many nice restaurants) but the bar was lovely and staff very good, again all protocols followed to a tee. Brandon was my waiter brilliant service fast and effecient. The walk into town is nice through the IMMA which is directly facing it and past the Guinness factory. If its dry its well worth it to get your bearings. Our room was large and looked directly out onto the main road but it was very quiet. Also the underground car park was so handy at 20 euro PN well worth it. Thanks again for a lovely stay. ",5,2021,12,12
240,Nice stay amazing staffs !,"Myself and my partner stayed in the Hilton kilmainham last Sunday, 5th December. Felipe looked after us at arrival and we received complimentary drinks. The view from our room was beautiful and we could also see kilmainham goal. The view at nighttime was really beautiful too. Eoin the bartender looked after us during our stay, he was so nice to us, very friendly. Myself and my partner enjoyed our stay so much that we decided to stay an extra night.

We‚Äôll definitely come back !",5,2021,12,11
240,New reception design - excellent staff! Nice to return,"Return visit to Hilton Kilmainham after 15 months (due to Covid situation). Nice modern new look in Reception - very different design since renovation and makes excellent use of space. 

Felt very safe / secure. Hotel in an excellent location. So easy to access from M50 by car and lots of good, useful, public transport options nearby. 

Had meal and drinks in the bar. Padraig still working at hotel and gave me a very warm welcome back, noting I hadn't stayed at the hotel in some time. Excellent service from new recruit, Justin. He is doing such a good job and looked after us so well. Very attentive service and delivered so well. 

Room was so comfortable and excellent Covid precautions in place. 

It was so good to make a return visit. Look forward to returning many times in the future. Staff are so good and well trained at this hotel. Keep up the good work!",5,2021,12,04
240,A weekend away with my son.,"The staff at the Hilton were absolutely fantastic very attentive and helped us out in so many ways, especially Lilly at the front of house, The Guinness Brewery was fully booked until Tuesday and lily managed to do her magic and get us in anyway along with also printing off our entry tickets for us, organised taxis as well, The swimming pool is really good the food was amazing, The hotel was absolutely spotless and all the other staff were great as well, definitely coming back again ‚òòÔ∏èüáÆüá™",5,2021,11,21
240,Visiting hotel,"I visited the Hilton in November , we arrived early so we sat in the bar and we was served by the server Jessica! What an amazing helpful person! She was so helpful and made our stay even better! What a lovely young girl who knows her job!  Thank you so much, will definitely stay here again!",5,2021,11,13
240,Would recommend,"Recently spent 3 nights at the Hilton Kilmainham, we arrived late in the evening so we were looking forward to a fast check-in and something to eat in the bar, we were met in reception by a very friendly receptionist who checked us in efficiently and with minimum fuss, our son and our dog(it‚Äôs pet friendly!) were both given welcome packs which was a very nice touch. Our room was ideal,  2 beds ,one single and one which must have been 7 feet wide! But most importantly they were really comfortable, bathroom had a very good shower and a separate bath, the TV had a good selection of channels also, 
Downstairs in the bar was a little more disappointing, we were waiting quite a while for some service, when our drinks eventually arrived the beer was unfortunately not up to scratch, I had to return 1 drink and watched as the barman simply just topped up the head and the same pint was returned to me! Putting a bit of froth on it did nothing to improve the taste!! 
The food was pretty good but the selection wasn‚Äôt great(beef burger &chips, chicken burger &chips, steak & chips, fish & chips) we ate in there on 2 nights and the ‚Äúchef‚Äôs special‚Äù was the same both nights, breakfast was ok and the staff there were very good, 
The location is excellent, the car park is ideal, the rooms are great, staff are very good, 
Having poor beer and a limited menu are not huge issues and are the only negatives I can say, 
I would stay again but I probably wouldn‚Äôt eat or drink there next time, hopefully they can look at the standard of beer they are serving and maybe add a few dishes to the menu.",4,2021,10,29
240,Disappointing  unfortunately,"Had such high expectations before going here after reading the wonderful reviews prior to our trip.  On arrival our room wasn‚Äôt ready even though it was nearly  3.30pm (check in from 3pm) however we were given complimentary drinks voucher when room was finally ready which was nice gesture. 
Check in was a bit rushed/abrupt at one stage they couldn‚Äôt find our booking which made me feel uneasy. Front of house were  friendly enough , but other reviews had mentioned how extremely friendly they were I personally didn‚Äôt get that feeling. 
Rooms are immaculate, beds super comfy bathroom spotless also . But no clean towels for next day unfortunately even though we staying 2 nights..
Bar is cosy and very clean only downside would be the service . Extremely slow. Waited at least 15 minutes per every drink ordered... even when we watched our drinks being poured  and sat at bar the bar staff just kept looking at them and walking on by even though wasn‚Äôt busy ... I was really confused by this .. couple of times we had to go to reception to let them know our key card wasn‚Äôt working in the door or lifts which was abit of a pain also.. All in all the only real up to this short trip which was well needed was the fact that Kilmainham gaol was literally a stones throw away from hotel which was main reason for visiting.",3,2021,10,27
240,Fantastic staff in a lovely hotel,"We stayed here a couple of weeks ago. We were checked in by Josh who was super efficient and pleasant. Josh also arranged a taxi booking for the following morning for an onward destination whilst I was able to leave my car in the secure hotel underground car park which was reassuring. As we were a late check-in, food service had stopped for the evening; however, many thanks to Jack in Room Service who sorted us with tastiest toasties for our supper. The room was super clean and modern with really good water pressure in the shower. The staff on breakfast (including Jack) were super efficient and friendly and there was a good selection on the menu. However, I must say that out of all the hotels I have stayed in anywhere, this hotel serves the best porridge! It's amazing how some places can get a simple dish like porridge so wrong but that is definitely not the case at the Hilton - I even mentioned to the server to pass on my regards to the chef. Check-out was super efficient and we were served by Felipe. Our stay was so good that we have chosen the Hilton Hotel Kilmainham for our next stay in Dublin again this week and look forward to returning.",5,2021,10,25
240,Outstanding stay !!,"Spent 6 nights here and have to say this is an excellent hotel -run efficiently and top marks on staff, food and cleanliness.
So my stand out was Felipe on reception .
He is a true professional and showed kindness, efficiency and care every time I dealt with him .
He is exactly the type of person you hope to meet 
when staying in a hotel.
He is a credit and massive asset to this hotel.
The food was amazing; I would go so far to say the best breakfast I have ever had consistently.
The dinner was just as delicious.
The rooms were spotless and cleaned to a really high standard throughout the stay.
Complimentary water during stay in room was a nice touch.
Gym was sufficient with all the equipment needed during stay ( didn‚Äôt use pool but looked tranquil and inviting).
All in all this is an excellent hotel and really central to city centre.
It is clear this hotel is run really well;  well done  to management.
NB Think Felipe could be the face of Hilton hotels üòä",5,2021,10,23
240,"Excellent location, friendly staff and comfy beds",The staff were friendly and helpful throughout our stay. The room and beds were comfy and quiet so we got great sleep. The food was delicious. The hotel is well located with Kilmainham Gaol and IMMA just across the road and regular buses to get to the city centre quickly. And the pool went down really well with the kids. We‚Äôll be back!,5,2021,10,22
240,"Falsely advertised, dirty, misleading, unsafe, party hotel with thieving staff","We stayed this last weekend, they was a noisy tram outside the window, faeces in the bed, dirty carpets with chunks of mud across them, no bath as was advertised when purchased, people in the next room who weren‚Äôt suppose to be staying in the hotel and also having an orgy and party, had to call down to reception twice and it still continued, night time staff no care for security and to top it all off, I left my charger and thought they would be honest and allow me to pay for this returning home however they are basically calling me a liar and stating nothing was left behind so clearly have thieves amongst the staff which makes me question the security of possessions in the hotel rooms. Currently trying to get my money back as overall experience has been pretty appalling and not worth the money we paid for two rooms. Just because it‚Äôs called ‚ÄòHilton‚Äô doesn‚Äôt mean it had any class, it‚Äôs practically a posh brothel. Would rate zero if I could.",1,2021,10,20
240,Saturday Staycation,"We stayed one night in The Hilton Kilmainham. Got a fantastic deal to begin with, excellent value for money. The hotel is spotlessly clean, the food in the bistro was fantastic. We had a really lovely room overlooking Kilmainham jail and the view of the Dublin mountains was excellent. Overall very happy with our stay, would definetly return.",5,2021,10,17
240,The Hilton kilmainham is a lovely hotel.,"I stay at the Hilton kilmainham several times a year. It is very relaxing, lovely food & service. Tranquil pool to enjoy. Felipe & Anna at reception are always so helpful and welcoming especially if I just drop in for a coffee with Friends.  Ann Harvey",5,2021,10,08
240,Perfect!,It's perfect if you want to stay in Dublin but not be stuck in the busy city centre. The room was spacious and spotless. Right beside the hotel is a huge garden with a beautiful walk. The breakfast was very nice and the staff throughout our stay were friendly and helpful. 10 out of 10.,5,2021,10,07
240,I had such a great stay!,"From the moment I walked in and was helped by Felipe (who was incredible) at the front desk, to the time I left, I had the best experience. I had stayed at multiple hotels during my stay in Ireland and by far this was the best one. The accommodations, the staff, and the regulations they took for COVID were all exceptional. I would definitely recommend it.",5,2021,10,06
240,"Great hotel, top notch staff",Spent five days in Hilton Killmainham could not be more pleased with this hotel.  The hotel was exceptionally clean and the staff could not have been more helpful.  Felipe and the entire front desk staff went out of their way to be helpful and accommodating.  The restaurant staff was also friendly and prompt.  It is not in central Dublin city which made it quieter but most places we went did require a taxi or bus.,5,2021,09,29
240,City Break,Excellent stay all round from start to finish Felipe was amazing so welcoming. All the team a real credit to the General Manager as we have stayed at sister hotels this is by far the best.The food in the bar and restaurant had brilliant choices available. We will definitely revisit again.,5,2021,09,28
240,Fantastic!,"Had a wonderful stay for a work trip. All the staff were incredibly friendly, helpful and welcoming, especially Felix who always had such a bright smile and remembered me when I returned a week later. Always accommodating when I needed some printing or a meeting room. Lovely spacious rooms, extremely clean and very comfortable.",5,2021,09,25
240,Amazing food,"Went for dinner at the Broyage, outdoor sitting area, service was excellent, staff really helpful and kind, shout out to the staff Jack that gave us the best service, receptionist had welcomed us in the best way, food was 100% worth it, really recommended!!!",5,2021,09,21
240,Night away,"Great hotel easy to get to and parking(which to our surprise was complimentary)
Staff really friendly check in was good also managed to get a slot in the pool when checking in.
Stayed on the kilmainham nights package really great value the evening meal which was included in our package was really good my hubby had the steak (no extra to pay either)I had the beef medallions.
Drinks were reasonably priced especially for a city hotel.
Dessert was Devine had the chocolate mousse.
Hotel in a great area only about half hour walk into the city, kilmainham jail right opposite and museum of modern art. 
There is also a nice pub opposite ",5,2021,09,12
240,Fantastic hotel with easy access to Dublin rail,"I‚Äôve stayed here on 2 trips now and can‚Äôt recommend it enough. It is a little difficult to navigate traffic, but once here it is a relatively short walk to the rail which services the city center area well. It is a very comfortable hotel with several food options nearby including on the hotel property. ",5,2021,09,07
240,Last minute break,"Everything from check in to check out was excellent. Our compliments to you on all of your team members - everyone had a welcoming smile and wanted to go above and beyond with any request before we even had to ask. Dinner was stunning, the steak and brownie were exquisite. Guestroom was clean, with a bed to die for! Thank you!",5,2021,09,05
240,Lovely stay,2 night stay recently with my daughter and our dog. Check-in we received a treat bag for the dog with a toy and some chew sticks which was a lovely gesture! We stayed in a king room which  was very spacious. Had dinner in the outside dining area one of the evenings and it was v tasty. Restaurant waiting staff were great and v friendly and professional. My only criticism would be that our room wasn't freshened up on the 2nd day and I had to request more towels where used ones weren't removed/replaced. it would also be nice to have replenished bottles of water. All in all a lovely stay - and just a 10min walk through the museum grounds to reach the Luas stop.,4,2021,09,01
240,Manager of this hotel is very ppor,"Terrible attitude from the manager, we were visiting kilmaainham Jail and decided to eat in the Hilton restaurant. One of the children could not eat from the menu and we asked the staff if we could buy from another establishment and bring it  to the outside tables. They said of course and not a bother. The rest of the restaurant was empty. Inside and outside. We ordered our food and my sons food arrived from the other establishment. However the Manager came out and told us off demanding that we leave the restaurant area as he could be responsible if we got sick from the food we brought on the premises. We had to split the group and take the other food onto the street outside the Hilton. My son left the restaurant area in tears. Never felt so embarrassed in all my time. Even being a Hilton Honors member for twenty years I have never been treated like that before. I will not be back near the Hilton again for business or pleasure",1,2021,08,30
240,Great guest services,Coming from US on an early flight they were very accommodating with an early check in. Very friendly staff. Great location and restaurant with very good food. Can walk to Phoenix park and Memorial park. Coffee and convenient store very close by. ,5,2021,08,20
240,Perfect stay,Stayed here on Sat night.  From the start the  very professional joy explaining the protocols.and everything around covid. Coming from the hospitality industry I tend to critique everything but the service I received from Ray is one to behold..I would of happily poached him only im a nice guy üòÑ But an absolute star and has a big future in the industry and hope he gets the recognition and training provided for him to move up in the industry. The breakfast was also fantastic the overnight chocolate and orange oats were unbelievable I could of easily filled my bag with the lot of them..Top marks chef. Was also very refreshing seen the Chef checking and refreshing the Buffet.. I was watching everything ü§™ well done guys top marks,5,2021,08,20
240,Excellent hotel within walking distance to the Zoo,"I will definitely book here again when staying in Dublin. The hotel is excellent and child friendly as well.  The rooms are beautiful and staff at the reception desk could not have been more pleasant and were very helpful.  We used the pool as well, which had to be booked under Covid restrictions so if you want to use it book early as the time slots go very fast.   We had breakfast in the hotel which was delicious and we also had a couple of meals in the hotel bar area.  Again excellent, tasty and reasonable prices for a hotel.  My only negative comment would be that bar service could be a bit quicker but other than that I would highly recommend this hotel.",4,2021,08,18
240,Excellent hotel,"I was impressed with the service, hygiene, quality of food and friendliness. To be honest there is plenty of staff and noting is a problem for them I was particularly impressed with Felipe at reception, his professional manner, helpfulness and the absolutely no problem attitude made us feel welcome and relaxed. The room was spacious and comfortable and spotless.
We had two young kids and they enjoyed themselves as we used the hotel as we came and went on our day trips around Dublin. 

Well done Hilton Hotel good job.",5,2021,08,18
240,Hilton Dublin Kilmainham,"The staff, services, amenities, facilities, and location were excellent. The cleanliness was outstanding. Staff was friendly and always helpful.

240,"Pleasant staff, nice rooms, tasty food!","My friends and I enjoyed a one night stay at this hotel for a short visit to Dublin. 
If you are driving, this hotel offers an underground car park for ‚Ç¨12 per night which we availed of.
We were welcomed with a smile by reception and although I had checked in online, they still arranged for our 2 rooms to be beside each other which we appreciated.

I would like to mention Chloe and Judit from reservations who were so efficient in assisting me with queries via email prior to the stay. 
We enjoyed a meal in the hotel‚Äôs Broyage Bar. Tasty food and cocktails enjoyed by all with excellent service. 
The same can be said for breakfast - thank you to the breakfast supervisor in particular or personally ensuring our group was well looked after! The buffet selection was great and you can also order your choice of eggs and omelettes. 

The rooms were also comfortable, with no complaints. 

A lovely hotel with pleasant staff - I recommend if you are visiting Dublin, only a short walk away from the popular Guinness Storehouse attraction too. 
Thank you - we will be back!",5,2021,08,16
240,Weekend stay,"The service  was absolutely lovely! Great customer service from filipe, I couldn‚Äôt fault anything ! I will come back! Felt like home ! I was worried about traveling , the hotel ensured we booked slots for swimming pool and everyone asked to wear masks !",5,2021,08,09
240,Great stay,Stayed here with my wife and toddler son for one night when visiting the nearby Dublin Zoo.  We had an excellent stay.  We used the pool as a family which was very clean and well staffed.  Please note you will need a padlock for the lockers if using them.  Otherwise they cost ‚Ç¨7.50 at from reception.  Any staff we encountered in the hotel were really friendly and helpful.  We found the hotel to be very child friendly.  Our son was giving a kid‚Äôs pack on arrival and all the waitresses smiled and waved at him which helps his mood!  We had dinner in the hotel restaurant which was very good also.  Good service and good food.  We were seated under an air con unit and I found it quite cold but the waiter had it turned off on request.  The hotel breakfast is not included in the price and costs ‚Ç¨16.  I thought this was good value as there was a lot of choice both cooked and continental.

240,Wonderful experience,"We stayed here with our 2 boys aged 4 and 1 this week. From the min we stepped foot in reception we had a wonderful experience. Customer service was fantastic. When we gave our booking details before proceeding with our booking the reception manager came out from behind the desk and gave our boys a little welcome activity pack, great idea which kept them entertained while we checked in.
We had a family room for our stay, lovely room, very clean and plenty room for us 4. They even had cot in the room for the baby as opposed to a travel cot, this was great for him and made it more homely.
Food was fantastic, we ate dinner in the hotel on both nights, the staff here were also great with the kids, really helps put you at ease dining out with smallies. I was also very impressed with the kids menu available, not just your typical burger/nuggets and chips which was great. There was salmon with potatoes and veg, ravioli and an option to get kids portion of adults special of the day which on one night was a chicken noodle stir fry, to name but a few options. We were very impressed.
Fab pool at the hotel also, very clean and comfortable. Has a kids pool and a deeper pool which was great for us.
Very pleasurable experience and couldn't fault a thing, will definitely be back again.",5,2021,08,08
240,Wonderful trip away!,"We travelled from Belfast for 2 nights to celebrate my boyfriends 30th Birthday. From the moment we arrived at the hotel, we were impressed. The reception staff were very welcoming and even gave my partner a birthday gift, which was a lovely touch. We arrived earlier than check in time but the room was ready and waiting for us. We had booked our swims and breakfast prior to arrival. The room was very clean and had a lovely view of the gaol. It also had a mini fridge which kept snacks cool.

Hotel is in an excellent location, facing the gaol, across the road from the Irish museum of modern arts. About a 5 min drive to pheonix park/zoo where we seen wild deer. One was so close, my daughter got a photo with it. 

Facilities in the hotel were very good and easy to use  although The pool area was restricted in terms of what was available to use but that's due to Covid.  The parking is great and is only ‚Ç¨12 a night and you can validate your ticket each time you leave the car park.

We ate dinner in the restaurant on both nights and the food and staff were lovely! The same guy served us both nights. His name was Ray, his service was excellent! He was very friendly and bubbly. Breakfast was also lovely. Good selection and attentive staff.

The only thing I would mention is that the pillows in the bedrooms were very uncomfortable. Apart from this we would definitely return and recommend to our family and friends. 

Thankyou for a memorable stay.",5,2021,08,03
240,5 stars,"I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.  My husband,  I and my son stayed here at weekend for three nights and it was a wonderful experience. Felipe at reception gave us such a lovely warm welcome,  he was so accommodating and kind. He deserves such recognition for his professionalism and the level at which he does his job. All staff were friendly,  warm and welcoming. The hotel itself is spotless, room was immaculate
 They provided a very cosy cot for our son, I was expecting a travel cot but instead received a cosy wooden proper cot. The food was delicious and service very efficient. The pool was a lovely warm temperature with a nice water feature, would highly recommend for children. The hotel is ideally located too, less than a 10 min walk to luas. A 15 min walk from zoo and phoenix park and kilmainham gaol is directly across the road. We will definitely be back!",5,2021,08,03
240,Amazing customer service,"Felipe on reception went over & above to assist my husband & I this morning even though we were not even guests staying at the hotel!  He should be commended for his friendly professional attitude & as a front- facing member of staff, Felipe could not have done more to help.  If Felipe is representative of this hotel I would highly recommend a stay here.  Amazing customer service ethic & so rare to find such welcoming hospitality.  Great job Felipe, you deserve acknowledgment for your attitude & warmth. Thank you üôèüèª",5,2021,08,02
240,Review,"Stayed with friend for 2 night,the idea was too go to leisure center,use sauna swimming pool and treat ourselves.Absolutely horrible experience ever,no water in jacuzzi,sauna and steam room not working,in a woman changing room broken sealing and looks very poor and cheap.Definitely not 4 star hotel experience.The staff is rude and unfriendly,both bar workers and ladies who serve breakfast all 3 of them,with a sad faces.reception only smiling and nice but still not able to explain what‚Äôs going on in a hotel swimming pool,why it‚Äôs not working and why it not show on the website that it‚Äôs not working,we would definitely book a different place then.Anyways never again to Hilton and highly would not recommend to anyone!!",1,2021,08,02
240,Excellent Hotel 5 stars,"Highly recommend the Hilton as a place to stay. The room was extremely clean.  The bed was so comfortable The hotel provided a very cosy cot for our son. I expected a travel cot but it was a proper wooden cot. The food was delicious. The staff were extremely friendly and accommodating especially Felipe,  he was extremely kind. We swam in the hotel pool while we stayed and it was a lovely warm pool with really nice water feature,  very child friendly.  It's very central, luas stop a ten min walk. The zoo and phoenix park a 15 min walk. Kilmainham Gaol is directly across from hotel too",5,2021,08,02
240,Fantastic hotel & professional service,"Stayed here recently for work. Hotel is well situated, secure underground car park (a welcome change for a city centre hotel).
Hotel is undergoing works - but didn‚Äôt impact stay in any way. 
Reception staff were excellent both on arrival and checkout.
Food service was friendly and efficient, food for both evening meal and breakfast was top quality with a good selection.
Rooms are well appointed, clean and very comfortable. Very comfortable beds and a good powerful shower.
Highly recommend and look forward to my next stay.",5,2021,08,02
240,"EXCELLENT LOCATION,  CLEANLINESS & SERVICE!","We stayed at the Hilton for 2xnights over the weekend with friends.  What a delightful experience.  We were able to visit the city centre,  without trouble or need to drive. The museum of modern art is just across the road, for beautiful early walks. The hotel overall is clean,  staff very attentive and lovely swimming pool.  
The outdoors seating area was like being in Spain somewhere,  our two afternoon evenings were spent having drinks outside and enjoying bistro food. I do recommend the chicken wings and chicken burger!
DEFINITELY return soon for a quick break !!",5,2021,07,30
240,Great over night stay,"We stayed in the Hilton Kilmainham recently so that we could do a visit to Dublin zoo. I have passed it loads of time and it was just an obvious choice for our trip to the zoo. We got a train to heuston and the hotel was only a 10 minute walk from there. The zoo was a 15 minute walk so the location for us was just brilliant. We left the car at home and were lovely and relaxed when we arrived. The outdoor area was perfect for us to relax and have some lunch even in the rain were well covered. We ate lunch and dinner in broyage bistro and it was lovely and tasty both times.
The hotel was immaculate and we could not fault the room. The staff were helpful and friendly. We went to the pool the next morning and it was lovely and was even heated. The whole experience was great from start to finish. I would definitely stay here again.",5,2021,07,30
240,Excellent,"Myself and my wife stay for three nights and our friends two nights. What amazing experience, from the moment you arrived the staff cannot do enough for you.
Check in was so efficient with all members of staff highly trained. The cleanliness of the bedroom and the size was just amazing. The crisp linen and the pillows you could die for.We had to book a time for breakfast, and again what can I say food was excellent and a great choice.
We dined two nights out of the three. The food and service was amazing .
All members of staff that we dealt with during our stay were so professional.
I have stayed in a lot of hotels over the years and all I can say this is one of the best . This is our second visit to the Hotel and we will definitely be back.",5,2021,07,29
240,Great hotel but never book reservations through phone..,"Stayed with my wife and baby. We had a great stay. All the staff were nice and friendly. Rooms were perfect and we love the cot they provided.  We also enjoyed the pool. We stayed on a weekend and it was busy during dinner. We were waiting for almost an hour for food and had to go back to the room as our baby was getting restless, food arrived in the room but after maybe an hour or 2 a guy came knocking to our room, he had the same food we ordered and was asking us to pay. We had to explain that we already got our food and it was paid for already, we were already getting ready for bed at this time and our baby was already asleep as well. Something similar also happened during our lunch where we got 2 appetizers when we only ordered 1. I guess this was because they were busy, the main issue for us was making the booking. As we were staying with a baby, we rang instead of booking on the website to get a cot set up. The first time we rang it was a guy we were taking to, told him that we need a room for 2 adults and a baby who is 11 months old, I asked him for a cot for the baby as well, he then was quoting us a rate for  2 adults and a child and was giving us a family room with a double and single bed, knowing that babies are not supposed to be charged I asked him why he was charging for our baby. The guy sounded like he didnt know what he was doing, i asked if we can just get a cot for the baby and we didnt need a room with 2 beds. He was so confused and asked what a cot was. I tried to explain it to him but he doesnt seem to know what it was at all or understand what it is. In between this conversation we were put on hold a few times already. After asking for a cot the line got disconnected. Rang again this time my wife tried, they were giving us a much more expensive rate than what was published on the website. We had to tell them the rate code just sobthey can give us the right room and price, we finally manage to book our room and the cot, rang again to book for the pool, the lady I spoke to was questioning me if I was ringing the right hotel and was saying they dont have a pool in the hotel. She was asking me where did i found out they had a pool and she even sounded like she was giggling on the phone as if i didnt know what i was talking about, i told her that it was on their website. She even asked me what website it was. She was putting me on hold a few times as well during the call. In the end she realised that there was a pool in the hotel, she then transferred the call and i think it got transferred directly to the hotel this time and we finally manage to book for the pool. This was a very shocking experience that we wouldnt think of experiencing specially with a popular hotel such as hilton. The people who we spoke to on the phone badly needs training. I work in the hospitality industry myself for almost 10 years now but this was the first time I encountered something as bad as this when it comes to reservations over the phone. It was so stressful. That being said. We would still be coming back to stay but would avoid ringing them for anything ever again.",4,2021,07,24
240,Trip to Dublin,"Lovely dog friendly hotel with excellent staff. Great location near the luas and loads of parks if you want to walk the dog. Lovely dog welcome pack. Staff were more than friendly, especially Felipe he was very welcoming. Would definitely recommend and visit again",5,2021,07,23
240,Great family break.,"Breakfast is very good. Hotel clean and felt safe (covid). Great pool - my boys loved this. Large, comfortable rooms. 1 issue- rude member of bar staff -telling us to ‚Äòkeep it down‚Äô. Didn‚Äôt make us feel welcome. Service slow at times - hotel waking up after lockdown - staff need to work on communication - but would definitely recommend for short, family break. ",4,2021,07,11

240,Fantastic Hotel! Extraordinary experience!,"This Hotel offers everything you need to stay peacefully.
The car park is underground, if it rains (often in Ireland) you don't get wet and you can comfortably unload your suitcases from the car, the lift takes you from the underground car park directly to the reception or if you prefer directly to the floor of your room (obviously you will have to insert the card ).
The reception staff kindly welcomes you and makes you feel as if you were at home, they are really helpful and have fulfilled my every request.
My room was very spacious, the cleanliness was impeccable!
Fantastic smart TV and very fast wifi.
Breakfast at your convenience served in your room at your preferred time.
The Bar offers genuine dishes with nice recipes.
This hotel deserves 5 stars!
I highly recommend this hotel both for business reasons but also for relaxing a weekend with the family.
I want to thank all the staff for their professionalism, also the cleaning staff, all the very nice reception girls and in particular I thank the Reception Manager Mr. Alberto who with his professional and empathic skills has helped to transform my week hard work in a pleasant stay.
I will return to this hotel without a doubt!",5,2021,05,09
240,"Great, relaxing stay","had a lovely time here, the staff were beyond helpful, esp on the front desk. The rooms were spacious, clean and the hotel itself is easy to get to with the tram service. Overall can'r recommend it enough",5,2021,03,19
240,Excellent Service - love this hotel!,"Staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming, rooms are clean and very comfortable. The area is perfect, so close to Phoenix park! Would highly recommend. Their restaurant is amazing but also lots of food & drink options in the area. Very walkable. Non-feather pillows available and room was ready before check-in was done.",5,2021,03,18
240,Love this place! Best all rounder hotel in Dublin!,"The Hilton Kilmainham has been my choice of second home for the last year and I‚Äôve been meaning to write this since my first stay! I travel for work (essential worker!) on a weekly basis and stay at least one night a week away. 

The hotel is warm and inviting from the minute you step out of the lift and only pales slightly in comparison to the staff who are just fabulous. I am always greeted by a friendly smile and the warmest of welcomes not to mention the fact that they are super professional, helpful and efficient. 

The rooms are all large airy and extremely comfortable, I love the huge windows with great views across the city, some have a grill in front but it doesn‚Äôt take away any of the light or view. I would recommend the king room with view though they are slightly bigger and have the best views. The suites with the balconies are fab for some extra space and the balcony is a nice spot to have breakfast.

Cleanliness is always high on any hotels agenda and even more so now. The Hilton has a fantastic policy for looking after guests during the covid pandemic, the whole place is spotless and they take great care in ensuring guests are kept safe.
. 
The food is great but menu is limited at the moment
 which is understandable, I have a tendency to be a loner and order room service which always arrives on time is hot and tasty, I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôve had most things on the menu but the wings and burgers are favorites when I‚Äôm not trying to be good! So is the brownie!! 

The bar here is great, really spacious and a very chill space to relax, there‚Äôs also a lovely heated patio area which is gorgeous when we have the weather. I 
can attest to the fact that this is a great spot for food and drinks, back when we were allowed to socialize I often had dinner and drinks here, the sharing platters are the best!.

I feel I should mention the gym...there is one, I‚Äôm inherently lazy and have not yet visited but it has all the bits you‚Äôd need to get a good workout in plus a fabulous pool/spa area which is far more my scene. Once the restrictions lift again I may very well break a sweat and try it out! 

All in all this hotel has everything you‚Äôd need for a stay in Dublin, clean, great rooms, comfy beds, nice location, secure underground parking that won‚Äôt cost an arm and a leg(hard found in Dublin), nice bar, good wine, gym/pool and a service you won‚Äôt get anywhere else. 
The staff here make this place the best. They know how to provide a personal touch with professional service in a time when travel can be met with worry and fear. I can‚Äôt recommend the Hilton Kilmainham enough, if you‚Äôre reading this then book it!",5,2021,03,09
240,Great,"The hotel is not only very clean, but very pretty to look at. The room was smaller than anticipated but had wall-to-wall glass windows so that definitely made up for it! The food was good. Lots of things are within walking distance, however it is a bit of a walk/taxi ride to a lot of the tourist destinations. It was pretty easy to access from the airport too, which is always a plus. (Trip was in March 2019)",5,2021,03,05
240,J.P,"Anxious about going anywhere due to covid, but needed a break to recharge.Rooms are sealed so you know have been disinfected. Very clean, ridiculously comfortable, gorgeous food and super staff. Thx x",5,2021,01,09

240,Thank you!,"I had such a great stay at the Hilton, Kilmainham. I told the receptionist it was my birthday and they went the extra mile to make it a special stay. The staff are so helpful and genuinely friendly. It's in a great location to experience lots of the best experiences Dublin had to offer. It felt very Covid safe too. Highly recommended.",5,2020,12,16
240,Fantastic Stay,"Booked the Hilton for a last minute staycation to celebrate. We had the most amazing stay. The reception team are so helpful and friendly. I called to confirm our reservation for the pool and it was brilliant to be able to speak with one person to confirm pool, dinner and breakfast booking. 

Great value for money. The room was so nice and we were given chocolates in the room as it was a special occasions. We had a 2 course meal included in our package and the menu was really good value and so tasty lots of options.. the staff were slightly under pressure and some delays with Starters but we didn‚Äôt mind at all as you could see they were busy but handled the service really well. Very enjoyable evening. 

Breakfast the next morning was also fantastic. I was really impressed overall by the our visit. We will definitely book again.",5,2020,10,12
240,Great Stay in Clean and Friendly Hotel,"Prior to travel the hotel sent an email which outlined the current COVID level for Dublin and effect it would have on our stay. I was able to reply and book a Dinner reservation and a slot for the  pool. The checkIn experience was flawless. I was greeted by a friendly host who kept the process efficient. The parking charge was also explained (12 Euro PN) which i was aware off.  We stayed in room 426, this was described as a double room with King bed. The room itself was very clean, spacious and had Iron, Mini Fridge, Hairdryer, basic toiletries. The view was fine but was compromised by a wire grid that runs down that side of the hotel. The shower in the room had poor pressure which is a pet hate of mine but not bad enough to be an issue. In the pool the Jacuzzi, Sauna and Steam-room were closed  due to COVID but again i was made aware of this on booking. The pool itself  has various areas which include jacuzzi and jets. Changing facilities clean with towels made available. You must wear a swim cap.  The Bistro menu was bar food orientated with an extensive drinks list. Bistro staff were attentive, helpful and service was efficient. COVID precautions were being taken seriously with hand sanitiser throughout the hotel and very clear signage. The public bathrooms were extremely clean. Upon check out  the lady on the desk was also able to help with directions to some sights we wished to see such as the National War Memorial.. She also offered an umbrella  which was a nice touch.",5,2020,10,06
240,Amazing stay,"The whole stay was absolutely fantastic! We loved every minute and we will be definitely back!
The only minus was that ladies changing rooms in the leasure centre were absolutely freezing which was pity as the swimming pool was nice and warm. I wanted to go there again but the fact that it felt like a freezer put me off. Other than that the hotel was absolutely amazing and my boyfriend and me can't wait for our next visit.",5,2020,10,02
240,Really beautiful hotel,"I stayed in this really beautiful  hotel on 22nd Sept 2020, it was an essential  trip as my husband was in St James's hospital  which is close by. It was very luxurious,  beautiful  clean room,  comfy bed etc.
I would like to thank the very efficient , thoughtful, helpful and extremely  kind receptionist called Anna , who made my stay stress free. She is a wonderful asset to this hotel and I hope she is well appreciated. 
I would definitely stay here again. Thank you to all the staff.",5,2020,10,02
240,Great Room,"I had a room on the top floor looking South. The views were fantastic, which made for a delightful breakfast in the room. The hotel was clean and crisp. Parking on site was also a real bonus. Only minor issue was that the face masks policy could be enforced more, a lot of guests seemed to be ignoring their requirement.",4,2020,09,15
240,Lovely staff and great hotel,"We stayed in this hotel a few weeks ago with family (2 adults, 2 kids and a baby) and we had a great time. 

The staff were very friendly and very helpful. The hotel is clean and feels very new and modern. 

There are some restrictions due to covid (such as pre booking breakfast and the swimming pool) but this didn‚Äôt spoil our enjoyment and we never felt rushed or pressurised. 

If you don‚Äôt book dinner in the bar, there is a nice seating area outside for a drink and the swimming pool is great for the kids. (We has this to ourselves for an hour!)

I would thoroughly recommend this hotel. ",5,2020,09,09
240,Great stay,"We had lovely stay at Hilton Dublin Kilmainham.. Room spotless and spacious, meal in restaurant delicious and service great.. Handy location to zoo.. Parking convenient... Would definitely return for another stay! ",5,2020,09,07
240,One night stay,The staff again is super friendly and always willing to help. Food is great but definitely the cleanliness is second to none. Will be back and have stayed there a couple of times now. Highly recommended to stay here.,5,2020,09,07
240,Really Safe Hotel for COVID - our stay was a 5 star experience!,"From the moment we checked in with the receptionist Anna until our departure with Eryck our stay with the Hilton Kilmainham was a 5 star experience! 

In terms of location and COVID it is just right. With easy access to MMA museum and park, along with the jail directly across the road while Phoenix park, Collins barracks, Dublin Zoo, the Guiness store house are 20 mins and if you want to travel into the city its easy to hop on Luas also near by.

In terms of the room. We were celebrating our anniversary and given a corner room on thr 5th floor. It was without doubt one of the nicest most comfortable hotel rooms I have ever stay in. The bed and pillow offer a 5 star sleeping experience. The bath and shower are also top class. Extra shelves and shaving mirror in the loo make shaving that bit easier. Hygiene in the room was spotless as throughout the entire hotel. The Hilton and its staff are taking COVID seriously, making you feel safe; there are automatic hand sanitizers everywhere and staff and you have to wear mask.

What separates this Hilton from others we have stayed in is the staff. They will go the extra bit and out of their way to help you! On the 2nd morning when heading out for the day I asked in reception for clean towels and also let them know there was a small problem with the remote. The staff member on reception said he would take care of it and also suggested that they service the room. When we returned in the evening our room was fresh and spotless. The level of cleaning in this hotel is like everything else that they provide to you ; 5 star!!   

We ate in the hotel bar on the 2nd night. Chicken wings again were top class. Burger was also good although not homemade if you are used to making your own. Coffees and drinks also really good. Table service also 5 star from Raja; just the right balance of friendly and professionalism that you tend to get with Hilton; and with COVID the staff here are trying ever harder to make your dining experience enjoyable.

Car park is also really safe, secure and with direct access from the basement to your room via lifts. We left our car for the two nights.  We stayed for 2 nights. In short it was one of the most enjoyable hotel experiences we have ever had, the best out of all the Hiltons we have tried globally and if you are visiting Dublin we highly recommend this Hilton Hotel.",5,2020,09,07
240,Dublin City Family Stacation,"After a gruelling day at Tayto Park we checked in to The Hilton Kilmainham. Interconnecting family rooms. Accomodation generous and pleasing. Welcome gifts for kids were lovely but sparce. Great puzzle box but a single Maltezers bar and 5 crayons looked sad inside. Please add a pack of popcorn to fill the box. Pool exccellent. Local takeaway ""Tonis Pizza"" great. Chocolate Milk & Cookies nice touch for the kids. Breakfast for the price was superb. Kids loved the American Pancakes with Nutella, Dad loved freshly poached eggs and bacon. OPW Kilmainham Gaol tour is excellent. Hadn't done it since 2nd Class School Trip 40 years ago. I paid much more attention this time. The 8 year old recoginsed it all from ""Paddington 2"" and was entralled. Did neighbouring IMMA as well. Nice outdoor coffee truck but bit limited and nothing for kids. Back to Hilton for coffee and hot chocolate. Great stay. Great service. Wonderful staff. I think they compt the parking but not sure. Either way good option . Enjoy historic Dublin. Educate the kids and be secure in a truely Irish sense at The Hilton Kilmainham.  Great Family Stacation.",5,2020,08,21
240,Excellent midweek Family break ,"Stayed here for 2 nights for a family break - absolutely fantastic stay. The team at Hilton Kilmainham have done a phenomenal job to make guests feel welcome whilst assuring guests that they have followed the guidelines to ensure a safe stay,  the hotel is spotless, guest rooms are spacious and the bar and restaurant areas practice safe social distancing. Great pool area where you can book a slot to attend, same for dinner and breakfast. Whilst the facilities are superb, the greatest asset has to be the staff across the whole hotel, from front of house to food & beverage and fitness centre/pool areas. Can‚Äôt wait to head back again. ",5,2020,08,21
240,Amazing!,"I was there with my daughter (13) and my nice (16) for 3 days.
Our stay was AMAZING.
The hotel was really clean the size of the room was perfect for three with wall to wall window with front view with lots of space for clothes and with a lovely bathroom.
We had breakfasts in the mornings it was excellent. We could have Irish breakfast, toast bread, cereals, croissant, scones,  fruit pots, drinks of your chooses and that jummy fresh orange juice AND FRESH PANCAKE.
We had dinner in the bar the food was sooo nice, plenty and not expensive at all so just perfect.
We could use the pool the girls started and finished their day In the pool. The water was warm and the girls were so happy.
The hotel has a perfect area.
We travelled by train and the hotel is around 15 minutes walk from.the station. The city center is around 30-40 minutes walk from the hotel. There are lots of things to do and see.
And my niece had her birthday there and the staffs surprised her with a fresh pancake with chocolate strawberry beside and they sang the birthday song too. It was so nice.
Thank you very much for the staffs of the Hotel Dublin Kilmainham.
We will be back.
Highly recommended!

240,Family and friends Staycation,"What amazing Hotel with very friendly and highly trained staff.
Our check in was excellent with a very experienced receptionist.
We were told everything about the hotel and also about the local attractions.
When we arrived to our room we were shocked how beautiful it was and the balcony and the views over Dublin and the Dublin mountains. We dined at the Bistro and the food and service was excellent.
You have to book for breakfast which we did and everything again was just wonderful. After breakfast we went to the Guinness Store House which was a great experience.
I would like to thank Kevin Brennan ( General Manager) and his dedicated team for looking after us.
We never got to use the pool this time, but on our return visit we will.
Thank you all team Hilton.",5,2020,08,08
240,‚ÄòStaycation‚Äô,"Stayed in the Hotel last week and was reassured if not delighted with Hilton‚Äôs approach to the new challenges of this Covid era. You will need to book dinner on arrival and breakfast too to avoid some queueing at peak times , same with the pool but then 45 minutes is all yours in the lovely pool. The product was excellent as usual but now with a visibly enhanced level of safety and security(that‚Äôs not in your face, some places are like a hospital)that only enhanced my appreciation of a job well done. It was clear that my families welfare was top of the agenda. Hope to see you again soon.

Our family suite was a great size with views of Kilmainham jail and the mountains beyond. Each room seemed to have a door seal and information about the clean stay policy in place which was very reassuring.

Booked time in the pool which was very clean, staff were very welcoming and polite in reminding us when our time was up.

We had dinner in the Broyage bistro which we all enjoyed. Great portion size for the kids meals and the menu had a good selction of mains and snacks. There was a lively buzz in the bar area and a nicely designed outdoor space too.

Breakfast the next day was good with a full table service on offer.

Overall we were delighted with the stay and would highly recommend it to our friends.",5,2020,07,22
240,food,"wow had food an drinks here this evening food was absolutely fantastic and the service from the staff Hugo,ben and Katherina,the service was amazing and the service was very quick yet very relaxing if you get a chance take 90mins an enjoy the great food service an the staff",5,2020,07,18
240,Good place,"Stayed there 3 nights. The rooms were good size and nice. The food, drinks and club were excellent and good way to end the day. The staff was pleasant and helpful. Located close enough to the old parts of town where you could walk if you chose to. It was a good ending to a very busy trip. I will probably stay there when we go back in the future. ",5,2020,04,01
240,Best customer service ever!!!,"My fianc√© and I have traveled to Dublin for the first time and decided to stay at Hilton Kilmainham because it was conveniently located near the Kilmainham Jail, Pheonix Park, Guinness factory and many other attractions we wanted to visit. From the moment we checked in we felt like the most important people in the world, the warm welcome from the reception staff and help with sightseeing thorough the stay (cannot remember his name unfortunately), to breakfast team each morning and spotlessly clean room. There is also a jacuzzi but unfortunately we didn‚Äôt have time to use it. I am mostly impressed with this hotel is because of their customer service: due to coronavirus borders started to close and we were nervous to not being able to return home so we decided to cut our stay 2 days short, our reservation was pre-paid and usually non refundable by the policy but the team went above and beyond to refund the last two nights and they were so understanding and compassionate. Thank you Hilton Kilmainham, we will be back!! ",5,2020,03,27
240,"Great value, extensive facilities on property","I have stayed at the hotel two times in the past 2 months and I had great service on both occasions. One person to highlight was Alberto at reception, very courteous and efficient both times. 
Rooms were comfortable, spacious and quiet. Something I really appreciated were the facilities, the pool, sauna and gym, quite hard to come by in Dublin. Great for a relaxing stay and for unwinding after work. 
Would recommend the property!",5,2020,03,26
240,Fantastic stay!,"Thank you to the team at Hilton Kilmainham for a fantastic stay! From check in to bedroom cleanliness, dinner and breakfast service, everything was flawless!! Loved the health club as well, a real plus. ",5,2020,03,26
240,Great stay at this Hilton!,Stayed at this hotel for a total of 7 nights and it did not disappoint. The location was convenient to get around Dublin and the old Kilmainham Gaol was across the street. The jail was established in 1796 and made for a very interesting tour. The entire staff from the front desk to the bartenders to the wait staff were very accommodating and a pleasure to deal with. Our room was comfortable and clean. I would definitely stay here again. Also great breakfast buffet!,5,2020,03,25
240,Outstanding service & Fabulous Food,"We have stayed at this hotel a few times now, and find this hotel to be amazingly welcoming and comfortable.  We not only appreciate the attentiveness of the staff, but the great menu and service at the restaurant, as well as the breakfast buffet with amazing offerings.  During breakfast, staff are quick to offer to bring a pot of coffee or tea to your table while you select your breakfast items at the buffet.  The choices are plentiful, with hot food, fresh fruit, Irish oatmeal and a variety of breads and pastries.  This hotel consistently delivers.  The staff are warm and friendly, and are very responsive to any requests you have.  This hotel feels like home away from home for us and we wouldn't stay anywhere else when visiting Dublin.   It is also conveniently located on tourist bus lines and taxis are easy to find.  It has beautiful views of Kilmainham Gaol from many rooms. And they make the best Bailey's & Coffee in all of Dubin!",5,2020,03,18
240,"Great hotel, great staff","Stayed here passing through Dublin for the early ferry to the UK. I have stayed before and it was great to be remembered on check in and welcomed back.
Checked in online using the Hilton app which really speeds checking in up.
The underground parking was helpful with the bad weather outside. There is a lift right to reception from the car park.
Will stay again when in Dublin.",5,2020,03,14
240,Poor quality service from a hotel that is Fawlty Towers run by Mr Bean,"Myself and my family popped into the Hilton hotel Kilmainham for lunch to celebrate a mile stone event with our son upon arrival we asked the waitress were we could sit she promptly told us any where except for the tables that are set up and reserved which was no problem then another waitress (Laura S) stepped up and abruptly told us to move to another area she then made a big deal of moving the furniture to accommodate a group of 4 adults and 2 nearly teenage children. She seemed very put out at our arrival as walk in diners even though it was quiet for our entire visit.

Then when ordering a manager who wasn‚Äôt even serving our table saw fit as heard what was being ordered to pass comment on the order while prancing about the bar. 

We ordered a light lunch as we‚Äôre having a family meal tonight the food arrived and was basically terrible the chicken in the club sandwich was like rubber and the toasted bread for the sandwich was soggy. 

The second ( Laura S) waitress then just put all the cutlery for the group in the middle of the table and didn‚Äôt even attempt to set places as is the protocol in other establishments I dine in at lunch and evening meals. 

I‚Äôve a background in Food and Beverage and I‚Äôd be very embarrassed and ashamed if I saw staff carry on like this. 
500048 check closed at 14:13 the management can reopen the check to verify my visit.  
I didn‚Äôt raise a complaint as we didn‚Äôt want to ruin our sons day and to be honest I don‚Äôt think  having seen the staff carry on and managers comments  there is anyone capable of dealing with a complaint",1,2020,03,12
240,I'll go back!,"Really good hotel, but for me what I really love was the restaurant and breakfast with an amazing food and good staff, Juliana Alves gave to me and my friend a excellent treatment, really helpful and kind.",5,2020,03,09
240,The most amazing Staff üôå,"Stayed here for a quick one day trip with a friend I hadn't seen in ages! This place has us in awe. 

We were treated like VIPs every step of the way. Right from check in to lunch in the bar, to drinks later on. 

Loved every part of it.  

We were served by this incredible girl named Juliana, who could not stop smiling and laughing. She was so chirpy and deserves kudos. She is amazing. 

Nikita and Alberto in the front desk are assets to the team and working in front desk myself, I would love to have them on my team. 

Padraig and Sunil also made me feel really important and made me look good in front of my friend. As someone who works in hospitality, it feels so nice to be on the receiving end and these guys here make you feel very special. 

The hotel also has a very nice pool, jacuzzi area. Perfect for a bit of relaxation. It's not a lap pool and for lazy people like me, it was the perfect relaxation needed. 

Thank you guys, I will come back every time I get a chance. üôå

240,I could not sleep,"Hilton Brand is a premium brand. I prefer to stay in Hilton hotels on my business trips. Good sleep quality is essential after busy working day. If you want to sleep in a hotel, please don't choose this hotel. A/C system is extremely noisy. ",1,2020,03,02
240,Excellent hotel with outstanding staff! Highly recommend,"I have stayed here a few times (business trips). Every time I am really impressed by the very warm welcome and genuine hospitality at the hotel. Three of the team members at reception (Alberto, Pawel and Ionut) recognised me from previous stays and gave a really genuine ""welcome back"" when I arrived at hotel. Thanks for your hospitality - gives a very good feeling and makes guests feel valued. Definitely some of the best receptionists I have ever come across at Hilton portfolio! Well done!

Hotel is modern. Rooms comfortable. Always slept well. Housekeeping excellent - always found room to be meticulously clean. 

Really good breakfast, wide range of food available and always provides a good start to the day. Staff very warm and hospitable / kind. Novak stands out for his warm and friendly manner - nothing is a trouble to him. Please pass on my gratitude. 

Keep up the excellent work! I look forward to returning many times in the future to an excellent hotel!",5,2020,03,01
240,Will be back,Great hotel. Spotless clean. Staff were excellent inc maid service who took the time to tuck in our little persons teddy. Such a lovely gesture and added touch. Great food in the restaurant and breakfast was plentiful and varied,5,2020,02,24
240,I had a great 2 week stay at this property!,"This place is highly recommended when you‚Äôre in Dublin for business, it‚Äôs relatively near from the city centre, I just walk on my 1st day and enjoyed the view along the road! I love my room as well!!!",5,2020,02,23
240,Good example of Hilton hospitality,"Got to the hotel early and checked in right away. First room 101 had a faulty tv and lack of hot water in sink and shower. However...my room was changed next morning early when I realized the issues.  Too jet lagged first night to notice. 
Breakfast was buffet and very good.
When I changed rooms I forgot the charging cable,and the cleaning staff member tracked me to the new room to give it to me.
Yes the hotel is not in city Center, but it‚Äôs an easy bus ride on 40 or 13 buses to the Center.
Overall it‚Äôs the staff... front desk and cleaning staff that make this a good hotel option for visitors.",5,2020,02,15
240,Mr G Holmes,"Came to this hotel with my wife and parents. On check In we were greeted with a very warm welcome by Nikita and told us everything in the area to see and do, she was also on breakfast and was very helpful. Due to the stormy weather the spa was closed which was the main reason why we chose this hotel, Alberto on reception throughout our stay went above and beyond to assist us with issues that came up regarding our stay. All other staff we came into contact with were pleasant and helpful. The best part of out stay was the breakfast and the staff.",4,2020,02,10
240,Awesome hotel,"Well it would be tough to write a negative review after getting upgraded to a top floor room overlooking Dublin, but loyalty to the SPG / Bonvoy program has its perks!

Honestly though, the hotel was awesome. The room was very clean and beautiful, nice sized bathroom as well.

Breakfast was a great buffet with an large selection of different stuff, I enjoyed the large honeycomb cross section! I didn‚Äôt use the facilities but I was offer a bathing cap just in case I was to go swimming, that was a first!

Not exactly walking distance to the tourist attractions but taxi‚Äôs are always waiting down stairs!

Overall, a great stay and nice staff at the Hilton!",5,2020,01,26
240,"Service, what service? ","Have eaten in the bar on numerous occasions over the last few years, the menu & food as always was very good and the area comfortable. 
Unfortunately, once again the service was poor, I had to ask for the bread that accompanied my starter and then ask for the butter. We had to ask for our water & wine when the starters arrived. The waiter who delivered our main courses was pleasant and efficient. I asked for more water following our main course and it was not served. ",3,2020,01,26
240,Historic location with modern convenience,"Just across the street from historic Kilmainham Gaol and the entrance park for the Irish Museum of Modern Art. Freshly renovated large rooms with comfortable bed, good lighting, excellent internet, large towels and shower/bath.Shower tended to run hot and then tepid was the only drawback. Delicious meals in the restaurant.",4,2020,01,14
240,Shocking honeymoon visit ,"We stayed at this hotel back in October, for the first night of our Honeymoon. My husband (admittedly silly of him) left his wedding ring on the bedside table. A couple of hours after checking out, he realised he had left it and we called the hotel. The hotel said housekeeping would have a look for it and they‚Äôd ring me back. I did not receive a call back so rang the hotel again. After numerous phonecalls and promises to get back to me, they kept fobbing me off despite us being 100% sure it was there. The last I heard they were going to check with the external company who clean the bedding. I was assured, yet again, that they would call me back. They didn‚Äôt. We can only assume a member of staff has pocketed the ring as we realised we‚Äôd left it before anybody else had the opportunity to check in. Obviously, the wedding ring has huge sentimental value and I‚Äôm upset at the extremely poor customer service we received. ",1,2019,12,28
240,Overnight stay,"Just returned from an overnight stay at this hotel. We were extremely satisfied with the room and more particularly with the staff.  There was a minor issue with our booking, which was done with a voucher through a third party consolidator.  The hotel was not at all responsible for the issue, but unlike the consolidator they undertook to  upgrade our stay.  There customer service was for me, a revelation for a chain/group hotel.  I would be delighted to stay here again and have no hesitation in recommending the hotel to others",5,2019,12,22
240,Comfortable and good for value,"I found the location suitable ad it was close to the major motorway and the outer ring and fairly close to city center. The hotel decor and amenities are dated but good for Europe and Ireland standards. The breakfast quality and variety is very good for ‚Ç¨16. The restaurant on site has very tasty food and bartenders worked hard to serve. I liked my room as it was spacious for one, I had 3 twin beds!!!! Not necessary but it was in a large size room with a bath tub and a shower in the bathroom. ",4,2019,12,21
240,Great Hotel,"My wife and I stayed at Hilton Kilmainham for a week.  The staff are so nice and hospitable.  Rooms very comfortable.  Just a wonderful place to stay when visiting Dublin. Right across the street from the Kilmainham Gaol.  Quiet, safe neighborhood with easy access to City Center.  Highly Recommend.  ",5,2019,12,18
240,Food and service hit and miss,There seems to be high staff turnover. I‚Äôve had both okay and very bad dining experiences here. It has improved in the last 6 months but it‚Äôs inconsistent. They cater well for all options nice mixed menu.,4,2019,12,15
240,Great service,I stayed for business reasons and my experience was really great. Breakfast good and with variety. I didn't use the express check out and it was really show because of the queue. Next time I'll use the express service.,4,2019,12,05
240,6-star service,We travelled with our 2-year old twins and got all assistance needed from very helpful staff. We adults enjoyed the clean and cosy hotel. Will certainly return! Also well located with good transport connections.,5,2019,12,04
240,Wonderful Dublin Hotel,"During our travels, we stayed at the Hilton next to Kilmainham Gael twice.  The staff was fabulous, including Nikita and the fellow with glasses at the front desk, the restaurant staff and the bartenders.  They put out a lavish buffet breakfast.  The rooms were well appointed, immaculate and comfortable.

Our favorite view was facing south, overlooking the historic Gael (jail).",5,2019,11,15
240,Nice visit ,"Nice and clean.  Staff are friendly.  We didn't do much in the hotel accept sleep so I can't speak to the other amenities. 

Its a bit of a walk to downtown. Quiet area. A few nice pubs and restaurants close by. 

Would stay again. ",4,2019,11,13
240,Great stay!,"Pros:
- The hotel was very clean and efficient in every endeavor.
- Hotel staff excellent - available all day!
- Quiet and comfy!

Con:
Only 2 restaurants around the location. 
City center is about 40 min walk. ",4,2019,11,11
240,Excellent Dublin City Marathon Weekend Experience,"I stayed in the Hilton Dublin Kilmainham over the weekend of the Dublin City Marathon 2019 (in fact the route passes directly outside the front door!). It was an excellent decision to stay there! The hotel is easy to get to from the LUAS tram line (6 mins walk) and is located in a pleasant tree-lined area along with the Irish Museum of Modern Art and the famous Kilmainham Gaol. The hotel itself was clean, modern, sylish, and well equipped. Staff were excellent - helpful on services and Dublin itself - polite and friendly. I used the bar for food and the breakfast offered. Both were excellent. The breakfast in particular was great - room was spacious, buffet extensive and well laid out. My bedroom was excellent too - large, spacious, well equipped with coffee, tea, biscuits! The large number of power outlets made working from the room easy too as I waited for the marathon. I saw other marathon runners staying there too (we all finished); some local; many from abroad. All were delighted with the hotel helping make this a great weekend for all of us.",5,2019,11,10
240,Vacation in Dublin,A great hotel clean. Great customer service. Breakfast buffet is great to. But cannot give it 5 star because it is not around anything. It is at least 2 miles to anything.  There is 2 restaurants and both are not that good. Hotel is great bad location  for vacationers.,4,2019,11,09
240,Ist stop on a weeks break,"Loved this hotel.  Were catching the train to cork next morning so wanted to start our hols relaxed.  Arrived at hotel at 1. Room wouldn't be ready until 3.  Not a problem.  Had something to eat in the bar, was very busy at that time.  Got our room at 3 only to find to single beds.  After 40 years of marriage, that didn't go down too well, so I rang the front desk.  Within 10 mins the matter was solved and were upgraded to a balcony room which was both spacious airy and bright.  We went to sit in the lobby and felt relaxed, people watching.

We had breakfast next morning which was very nice.  Could be a bit hotter.

On leaving the hotel, the receptionist said goodbye and said sorry for the issue the previous day.   The hotel was very busy, so she did well to remember me.  That was a nice touch",5,2019,11,06
240,Great Friendly Staff!,"We Went here to spend our Anniversary and we were treated so pleasantly from the moment we walked in.
This is a great establishment with a very friendly staff, we will most likely stay here again in the future. ",5,2019,10,21
240,Great hotel - slightly outside City Center,"Great Hotel, a little on the pricey side for being outside the city, but the spa, gym, wet-areas (pool, sauna, steam room, etc) were amazing.  One good restaurant- and the rooms were generously sized.  my only complaint is that its about a 10-15EUR ride to the city each way, and finding a taxi takes some time. Even calling for a taxi service you have to wait 20 min MINIMUM. No there is no Uber so I wish they had a shuttle service to the airport/city center. ",4,2019,10,16
240,"Brilliant time, will return again!","We stayed here for two nights as we were going to the Brad Paisley concert at the 3 arena! We had a lovely time, the hotel is beautiful and our room was so spacious & comfortable! We had two great nights sleep! The staff were so friendly & helpful! Thank you! 

Breakfast was excellent, brilliant selection of food available and also eggs/ pancakes were cooked to order off the menu - nice touch! 

We are in the Broyage bar one night during our stay, food & service were excellent. Thoroughly enjoyed our mains, and had some cheeky desert afterwards! Prices very reasonable! 

The car parking was a great bonus, so easy to avail of. We drove into Dublin City centre one day, quick easy drive. There was a bus stop around the corner from the hotel and the luas was a close 5 minute walk. So easy to get around. Close to attractions such as gaol, museum of modern art & the Guinness factory! 

Only downside was the spa facilities, we were disappointed by the mandatory use of swim caps & the cleanliness of changing rooms. 

Other than that we would definitely return again! 

",4,2019,10,14
240,Very Good Stay,"Stayed for 1 night prior to conference in Croke Park. Check in was friendly. Room was lovely and very quiet. Had a really good sleep. The pool area was excellent. Breakfast was missing a few things, no natural yogurt, bacon sitting in the tray a long time. Hotel was not cheap, more than ‚Ç¨220 for one night",4,2019,10,07
240,Visit to Hilton Dublin Kilmainham,"We spent one night at the Kilmainham Hilton in Dublin. The hotel is first class with excellent service, immaculate rooms and a very convenient location. We were right across the street from the Gaol and from some great eating establishments. I highly recommend it and would definitely stay again.",5,2019,10,06
240,Best hotel experience,"Cannot beat experience at Hilton Kilmainham. Honestly, you are perfectly situated with the most courteous, efficient, respectful, good humored staff. Everybody will go out of their way to make sure you are satisfied. ",5,2019,10,03
240,Top of the line!,"This place is amazing!! Employees are friendly, professional and attentive. Room was spotless. Had a room with a balcony and what a view of Dublin and the hills behind it....perfect! Food in the restaurant Broyage was delicious!! This hotel is in the best location for navigating Dublin as it sits across the street from one of the stopping points on the Do Dublin - Hop off, Hop On line. Perfectly convenient! We considered numerous hotels and so happy we chose this one. I would recommend it to anyone. Oh, and there are markets including an organic food store just down the street for anyone wanting fresh fruit and veggies on your trip. And lastly, there's a pub across the street, Kilmainham prison and the museum of modern art. Can't go wrong.",5,2019,10,03
240,As hotels should be!,"I cant say enough good things about this hotel..  The staff are professional and  very pleasant and the room was spotless.  Lovely walk in shower with some lovely complimentary toiletries.  The best was out of this world, I wanted to take it home along with the pillows,  I didn't have to do my normal "" pillow shuffle"".  Apart from everything else the breakfast sell it, so much variety, caters for everyone and so fresh.  A lovely touch was the honey Combe, straight from the hive. It may be slightly of the beaten track but dont let that put you off,  its a ten minute walk to the Luas or it cost us 15 euro's in a taxi, straight to the city centre.  It was my third stay and it wont be my last.",5,2019,09,25
240,Very nice ,"Comfortable room, great staffs and it's right across from Kilmainham prison. Great piece of history. Also Hop on Hop off bus stop is right across from the hotel as well. Very convenient. Not too far walk to the Guinness Store house. ",4,2019,09,23
240,Sleepless in Dublin,"Despite being wheelchair accessible, I would not stay at this hotel agIn.  The beds were small and the mattresses very hard.  Room service does not seem to know how to set a tray with utensils needed for the meal being served.",2,2019,09,20
240,Nice hotel with excellent staff,"The hotel was a typical Hilton, comfortable with nice amenities, very good breakfast and a spa. What really made my stay special was the very helpful staff. I would especially like to note Dave from the dining room who went out of his way to buy soy milk for me when they ran out one morning. The hotel is a bit far from the center but we still managed to walk it and it is very close to the luas (Tram) which is easy to use. It is right across the street from the gaol and the modern art museum and a few minutes from the War Memorial Gardens and Phoenix Park.",5,2019,09,18
240,Not for swimmers.,The hotel was nice but we stayed  here because of the pool which turned out to be a big jacuzzi.  The rest of the health club was nice.  Our room was large with a king sized bed and a view.   Rooms and staff very nice.  Sabrina at the front desk was great.  It's a bit of a trip to central Dublin.  We ended up spending a lot of money on cabs.  A/C was good here.  ,4,2019,09,17
240,Expensive but pleasant,"Hotel is a typical Hilton has nice rooms and great beds general high standard ,However I believe at 283 euros per double room breakfast should be complimentary,It is located just beside Kilmainham Jail and IMMA 15-20 euro taxi ride from Dublin City Center  ",3,2019,09,16
240,A nice Hilton Hotel near the city center,"A ""small version"" of Hilton without executive lounge.  Breakfast really good.  Onsite restaurant/bar quite good too.  Room in good size, but single beds really smaller -- and uncomfortable.  Gym quite impressive.  Staffs everywhere, including front desk, restaurant, breakfast area etc. ALL very nice/professional.  A good choice.",4,2019,09,16
240,"Attentive Staff, Professional, Would Recommend","Stayed at the end of our Ireland trip for one night.
PROS: 
Check in was a breeze - they allowed us to drop our bags early to hold as we had a set tour at the gaol across the street.  When we returned our room was ready and staff retrieved our bags which were well cared for as they had pottery in them.  They went out of their way to put them in a separate location and marked ""Fragile"". 
Restaurant was good - We had a full day and returned late and had a late night dinner in restaurant on premise.  Dinner was very tasty and they made an excellent Irish coffee! 
Proactive and Professional staff - Room was clean and tidy and the front desk actually was right behind us to double check that the room was up to snuff because their system didn't say it had been double checked after cleaned (it was just perfect).  That was nice that they didn't want to wait to hear IF they got a call from us complaining - they were proactive.
CONS:  None for me!  They were effusively concerned that we were well acquainted with the premises.  We actually declined their offer to really show us around the hotel grounds and its amenities as we were leaving early the next day.",5,2019,09,16
240,Good location,"Stay three nights and had a wonderful  time. The staff was friendly and helpful. The breakfast was good and the was always willing to help. 
The location was good with the hop on bus stop across the street. When you stay here make sure to take a tour of the jail across the street",5,2019,09,15
240,Fantastic,"Extremely friendly Staff and very clean rooms . 
Conveniently located to everywhere you want to go in Dublin .
Also the dinner place has a very nice selection and very good food . We had a great time in the facility.",5,2019,09,14
240,Really nice hotel,"Very helpful and friendly staff. Sparkling clean rooms.Location is a bit further away from city center than most other hotels, but across the street from Museum of Modern Art, Phoenix Park and a few others. Plus, city center is just a short ride away on LUAS or a bus. Food in their restaurant is also very good.",5,2019,09,08
240,Highly Exceptional Property!,"This property is exceptional in appointments and staff!  The hotel is very well appointed with clean, modern baths and new case goods.  My daughter said, this is the nicest hotel we have stayed at over the past 10 days.  This says it all coming from someone who is as critical as she is!  Ha! ",5,2019,09,08
240,Excellent,"Very quiet comfortable rooms...clean, large, multifunctional bathroom. The check-in was expeditious, friendly. Many pubs nearby, public transport at the door. The hotel also offers a dining room, indoor-outdoor bar and multitude of tours offered.",5,2019,09,08
240,Mr &Mrs Duffy,"kkkkkkk
Very pleased with everything the hotel had to offer. All the staff were very friendly and helpful. Food was excellent and our room was very comfortable. The restaurant and bar facilities were first class.

",5,2019,09,07
240,Hilton - another great hotel in this group,"Great hotel in excellent position for visit to Kilmainham and not too far from Guinness Brewery .  Staff were friendly and helpful.  Would definitely recommend this hotel.  Only negative point was table at breakfast not laid very well - had to go looking for a couple of items but breakfast was lovely.

",5,2019,09,07
240,Totally wonderful.....!!!,"Stayed here during August 2019 bus tour.  Excellent location.....very clean, quiet, comfortable room.  Enjoyed walking to shops and pubs in very close proximity. All staff was pleasant, kind and very accomodating.  Would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2019,09,05
240,Lovely stay,"Great rooms and location. Across the street from the Gaol which is steeped in history and round the corner from an easy quick bus connection into the Temple Bar. 
Staff were very friendly. Room was clean and comfortable. 
Went for breakfast for my HH perk, but we didn‚Äôt make it unfortunately!",5,2019,09,04
240,Wonderful hotel with great location and unbelievable staff,"We stayed for 2 nights before our tour started and couldn‚Äôt have been happier. Was up to Hilton standards and a great front desk agent, Ana, was so wonderful to help us get into a room early since we traveled overnight and we were exhausted. She did everything she could to help my kids and me get situated quickly 
Great location, across from the Kilmainham jail and walking distance to Phoenix Park, Ireland Museum of Modern Art and Ireland War Memorial Gardens. A very safe neighborhood location. 
We also did walk to and from downtown Dublin which was a great walk. A little far if you have issues waking but no problem for us. There is also transportation easily accessible right in front to the hotel 
Rooms were wonderful and the bar/restaurant is an added bonus to have in the hotel with a nice little patio area as well. 
Will definitely stay there again when I go back!",5,2019,09,01
240,Cleanest washroom ever!....,"I travel internationally throughout Europe and Asia 5 or 6 times a month and the Hilton Dublin Kilmainham has the cleanest rooms by far that I've ever stayed in. When I walked into the bathroom it actually took me back for a moment to see how clean the bathroom actually was. Lots of reflective surfaces and there wasn't so much as a fingerprint in the entire room. It was so clean that I had to reach out to the hotel to find out who had cleaned the room. Hats off to Ramona! Exceptional job! When you're in as many hotel rooms as I am, it takes an exceptional job for me to notice. I usually notice what isn't there or what isn't done. This is the first time in a long time that the cleanliness made me stop and notice. Clearly they are doing something right in choosing the right people and managing them properly. As well, the front dest staff is very helpful and extremely friendly. A pleasure to be greeted after a long international flight. Well done and compliments to all!

Cheers!",5,2019,08,31
240,Initial day stay from Globus Tour,This was the first night of our Globus tour of Ireland. We selected to have an additional day at the hotel before the tour started. Accommodations and ambiance were first rate including breakfast and lunch we had there.,5,2019,08,29
240,"Excellent staff, excellent pool.","We stayed here for a one day stopover in Dublin. The parking is reasonable at ‚Ç¨12 just make sure you chat with staff prior to paying the machine.

The pool is great. It's fun for kids to play in. Not a lap pool but family friendly. We were in it for hours.

Balcony was lovely and the room was huge.

We didn't sample the food.",5,2019,08,29
240,Dublin holiday,Loved the fact that it was away from the hustle & bustle. Very quiet. Easy walk to Dublin center. Rooms were nice& modern. Beds comfortable. Only issue was controlling the water temperature in shower.,5,2019,08,24
240,Very nice hotel!,"Very nice hotel! Rooms are well appointed, modern design, great fitness and pool area. The restaurant was typical Hilton fare and very good. Quiet neighborhood with a few very good local restaurants. The staff is most accommodating (tours , transport and advice)

We recommend!!!",5,2019,08,22
240,Wonderful rooms,"I choose this places based on reviews and I wanted a place with a pool and hot tub. First the location is farther from town then I thought. Its 25 min walk to Guinness storehouse and in an area that feels  unsafe when walking to the storehouse. Since traditional uber is not  there but taxis that are metered a simple ride to mid town is between $15 to $20 euro. The public bus only accepts coin. I would definitely suggest the green hop on and off as the big bus one tends to miss this stop. Also there a few restaurants  but not much. The Italian place La Dolce Vita super good.  Check in was quick but the receptionist  had an attitude  about her that was offputting but that's ok. 
The elevator was a good size and you need to swipe your card for it to work. Now the  room  we were close to the elevators and heard nothing which was great. This room was huge not ur traditional european room. I liked having a usb port close to bed and the fridge was great.  Now this was my first hilton and they surprised my spouse with an awesome treat for his birthday day. I truly appericate it. The room was very clean, bed super comfortable. The bathroom was nice but I wish they had a shower curtain as the little glass piece did not protect water from spilling everywhere and actually felt unsafe. Now The view from the room would be nice but there are bars over the windows so you cant really tell.  My reason for choosing this place was the pool the receptionist told me they close at 6pm but its actually sat and sun 8:30pm mon thru friday 9:30pm. The pool is not a traditional pool its  a hydrotherapy  pool and they are very serious that you have to wear a swim cap. Remember this is a club for locals so your not just with hotel patrons so it can get  crowded  this is why I didnt use the gym..The pool area does not have any place to sit down and you can't bring stuff in the pool area. The pool wasnt open my last morning so that was a bummer. Jordan in the fitness pool area was super nice and helpful explaining  everything. So definitely  say hi to jordan he is wonderful. Check out was super easy and quick I didnt get her name but super nice. Overall nice place. Would stay again prepared. ",4,2019,08,22
240,Another excellent Hilton experience!,"Wonderful, clean hotel with an option for a family suite (1 king bed + 1 single bed) which was great for our family of 3 with a teenager. Staff were super helpful and friendly. Self parking was convenient and easy to navigate. Great location next to Kilmainham Gaol and IMMA. ",5,2019,08,16
240,Best near a jail hotel,"This hotel is convenient, clean, and safe. A bit overpriced for what you‚Äôre getting but it was tourist season. It‚Äôs on the tour bus line and bear some major attractions but not a lot of choice for meals nearby",4,2019,08,11
240,LOVED LOVED This Hotel,"My two teens and I had room 306 which is a family room with one king and one single bed.  We took a taxi here from the airport, and picked up keys because I had used their app for online check-in (you can view floor plans and choose your room!)  This room was very quiet and perfect for us.  We walked across the street to see the jail, and had dinner at the Italian restaurant across the street on the corner.  We then made use of the spa area, and LOVED this!  We were exhausted from not sleeping for about 24 hours so we fell into a deep and comfortable and quiet night's sleep.  We had the breakfast buffet in the morning which was one of the best I've ever had at a hotel.  I sure wish we had more than one night here, but we were picking up a car to travel the country.  We didn't stay here upon returning to Dublin because it was a little far from the city center, but I missed it because our other hotel was not nearly as good.  I would return here in a second - highly recommend!",5,2019,08,09
240,Great hotel!,I stayed here with my family and really enjoyed my stay. The rooms were nice and comfortable. The staff were very friendly and David in particular was very helpful. It is a good location too if you plan on traveling in and out of the city centre as it is very nearby. Would recommend staying here!,5,2019,08,09
240,North American style hotel in Dublin,"I am a Hilton Honors Gold Member. Stayed with my wife for 4 nights over a weekend while visiting family in Dublin. First time staying at this hotel. Hotel appears to have been recently renovated and has the feel of a North American property. Rooms nicely appointed. Floor to ceiling windows with very thick glass. Could not hear the road noise below  from a very busy street. Thick drapes when closed darkened the room. Central air and heating, so again very quiet. The only negative about the guest room was the very awkward and what I consider to be a dangerous bathtub/shower. The bathtub is very narrow in width and is elevated on a platform which makes getting in and out of it for showering most difficult. It has a hinged glass panel (half the length of the tub) that acts as a baffle when using the shower. It does not function well as water goes everywhere. I had to help my wife out of the shower every morning as she could not manage on her own. This issue was the only reason that I did not rate this property a 5. The front staff were very kind and accommodating. The buffet breakfast every  morning had a large variety of quality and tasty hot and cold items. We ate in the hotel‚Äôs bar many times and rated in on a separate review. Despite the bathtub issue, would recommend this hotel. It‚Äôs located in a very historic area just outside of the downtown core and walking distance to a variety of restaurants and tourist attractions. Hop on hop off bus stop is just across the street.",4,2019,08,07
240,Fantastic for business travelers,We had a great stay here as business travelers with lots of gear. The hotel staff were quite helpful. Our rooms were very large with incredible floor-to-ceiling picture windows (pro tip: floors four and five are the best) and large desks and bathrooms. I'm very sound sensitive and was never stomped awake by guests overhead or in the hallways. A great breakfast buffet and an evening bar service was also available. Reliable lifts. Sometimes you want the charm of a quaint hotel. Other times you want reliable working conditions. This was both--a top-functioning hotel near museums with a beautiful view of the city from its magnificent windows.,5,2019,08,05
240,Great stay,"Except for a slight snafu in the parking lot on the way in (my fault), the hotel was great.  Staff seemed genuinely interested in our happiness with the entire facility.  In you are on the fence, stay here you will not regret it.",5,2019,08,05
240,Excellent stay!,"This was the best hotel we stayed at during our vacation. It has modern amenities, nice big rooms with comfortable beds, great food,  and a perfect location. We were so happy to choose Hilton Dublin Kilmainham.",5,2019,08,03
240,Great stay,"I liked the following
The room, meeting facilities, breakfast, gym.

The staff was kind, and we had a great whiskey tasting lead by Phil

all in all it was a great stay. Also right next to a park, where it was good to relax during meetings",5,2019,08,02
240,Corporate Event,"We had a group of about 50 people come from the US. Normally, this is very difficult to coordinate everything. But Phil Joung did a fantastic job and went above and beyond for us. The hotel was clean, accommodating, and always willing to help when last minute issues arose. I can not recommend more for events. The location is away from the noise of the city but close enough to walk or take a short taxi. The jail is across the street and makes for excellent group tours. The staff was all very friendly and helpful. This is my second time staying at the hotel, and I will continue to use this location on future trips to this beautiful country!",5,2019,08,01
240,Great stay at Hilton Dublin Kilmainham,"Our visit to Dublin for a research meeting as well as some sight seeing.  The staff in the hotel and for meeting services (especially Phil Joung who was our main contact) was amazing, and the food was excellent.  The location is excellent for walking adventures, riding the bus, and easy access to the city. Would highly recommend staying here!",5,2019,08,01
240,Great Experience,"This was one of my favorite hotel stays.  Great location, extremely friendly staff and great food.  There is a great pub across the street and two museums.  The prison museum is a must visit.  The hotel staff are very attentive to your needs. ",5,2019,07,31
240,"Great hotel, great staff, great experience. A great place to stay..and host a meeting","We hosted a meeting at this hotel, and had an opportunity to experience all this hotel offers from the meeting services, to the meals, to the bar, to the rooms, etc. I've hosted this meeting for 20 years, and can honestly say this was one of if not the best experience working with a hotel. The meeting & event coordinator Phil Joung was fantastic, as was the rest of the staff at the hotel. I can't say enough about how nice and helpful everyone was to make our guests feel comfortable for the meeting and their stay in Dublin. The hotel is a little outside the city, but that makes it nice and quiet, and right across from the top attraction, the Kilmainham Jail (get your tickets early). It's very convenient to access the city; it's a 40 minute walk, or a quick taxi or even hop on hop off bus ride. Guiness Storehouse and the Zoo (Both highly recommended) are minutes walking away as well. There is a brand new gym and swimming pool in the basement of the hotel. The food was great, as was the beer selection at the bar. The breakfast buffet was also great. We hosted several meals there, and can honestly say they were the best meals we had in Dublin. And right across the street is a great italian place called La Dolche Vita...great pizza and pasta! I highly recommend this property and will definitely stay there again when I go back to Dublin. Thank you to everyone at Hilton Kilmainham!",5,2019,07,31
240,Great stay at Kilmainham,"We had another great stay at the Hilton Kilmainham. It's a terrific property in a wonderful neighbourhood of Dublin and the hotel is well run. The staff always appears happy to be working at the hotel, another indication that it's well run. I especially appreciate the great pool/spa by the gym, the quality of the restaurant food, and the absolute quiet of the rooms at night to allow for good sleep. I strongly urge visitors to Dublin to consider this neighbourhood and this hotel, as they are enjoyable in themselves but also well-located to visit other parts of Dublin. Great place.",5,2019,07,29
240,Beautiful Hotel,"Oh my - it was such a fabulous hotel. We had a view of the goal, and it was so cool to sit near the window and imagine life 100 years ago. The rooms were very comfortable, beds were terrific, and the staff super helpful. I am diamond status, so we enjoyed a delish breakfast at the hotel. We also had drinks in the bar one night, and had a really good experience (even with two kiddos). The location is much quieter, however it is a longish walk or cab ride to Temple Bar. We were heading out via train, and the station was in walking distance  - only about a 15 minute walk (it would probably be less for those of you not with a 5 year old who complains about walking after 3 minutes).",5,2019,07,27
240,Adaquate hotel,"Being a frequent Hilton traveller then I decided to choose a Hilton hotel near to where I was having meetings; as a Hilton Honours Diamond member I was disappointed that I wasn't offered any upgrade and had a standard room.. which was ok but nothing special. To be honest I don't think Hilton hotels being franchises care about  HHonours and finding it a waste of time (but that's another subject!). I was offered 2 free drinks but being on business via expenses doesn't mean much but nice gesture! 
The room was ok as mentioned, the aircon was great and I was on 5th floor so nice and quiet. Some oddities like USB sockets next to bed didn't work, TV when switched on only went to channel 30 which wasn't tuned channel so I had to change ‚Ä¶ and the safe .. it worked first time but when I took something out then even after following the instructions it wouldn't work. I did ask for help - they ""fixed"" and all it meant was first time it worked second time it didn't do anything... 
Breakfast was interesting as well .. The person greeting me didn't actually show me to my table but asked me if I wanted coffee .. but then couldn't find me because I went for food... and then when I went back for more food, cleared away table .. bit chaotic and the hotel wasn't full.
I had dinner in the evening and it was ok. Nice tables outside although it is also smoking area. In UK then eating / smoking wouldn't be allowed in same area ‚Ä¶ but I know this isn't the UK.
I did take a walk to the Guinness Storehouse - I didn't go in as too late.. pleasant walk until near the end when it got a bit rougher area and although day time was ok, I wouldn't like to walk around that part of town in the dark (certainly by myself).
Overall nice area for hotel and I would stay again. But certainly nothing to blow me away!!",3,2019,07,25
240,Good Hotel,The hotel is good and is located near the Jamieson Whiskey and Beer company with 9000 year lease.  The rooms are good.  The breakfast is great. The only problem is that it is not in city center which makes it difficult to travel.,3,2019,07,21
240,Very nice hotel across the street from Kilmainham Gaol,"We spent two nights at this hotel and found it to be very attractive and comfortable. Check in was easy and our room was ready. Our room was large enough and was on the 4th floor facing the gaol, and we heard no street noise. The A/C did a fine job and we enjoyed our dinner that we had on the patio in front of the hotel. The front desk advised us on when we needed to leave for the airport and booked us a taxi. Checkout was prompt and friendly. Besides the gaol there is the Irish Museum of Modern Art with a nice walking path across the street. Down a couple blocks is the Royal Oak Pub which we found to be quite nice. The Patriot Pub and La Dolce Vita Restaurant are across the street and LimeTree Cafe is less than a block away.",5,2019,07,18
240,No sleep due to excessive noise,"I fly from Canada to Ireland most weeks and have spent two nights in the Hilton Hotel in Kilmainham, but I am recommending that we don't stay here again.  The excessive noise of taxi men shouting and car using their horns early morning, afternoon was awful.  People shouting and giving out due to taxis parking illegally and blocking the road.  I had to sleep and got none due to the awful noise from the front of the hotel.
Felt so sick after with no sleep.",2,2019,07,16
240,Nice hotel - terrible check-in and ability to rectify the problems,"We arrived for our three-night stay and everything went completely wrong when first they couldn't find our reservation then realized there were two in my name. We were told we'd have to check out the next day and check back in and we couldn't stay in the same room. It was a nightmare. The next day, we packed everything up (including wet bathing suits) to store in a ""safe locked room."" We were told when we ""checked out"" that housekeeping would move our things to our new room and we could check back in after 3. We arrived back around 3 to get our new room and we were told we'd be able to stay in our original room and our stuff was still there... this was aggravating to say the least because we had spent time packing our things, but we were happy to stay in the original room because it had a sofa bed for our 4 year old instead of the single bed which she could fall out of. We went to the room to find it empty. Our things were not in the room. My husband went back downstairs to figure out what was going on - they told us that they didn't know what happened to our things. After some time, they figured it out and told us we actually were moving. They could offer the original room for one more night, but not the two we had left. This was super frustrating - almost 1.5 hours were wasted trying to find our things and relocate us to the ""new"" room with a single bed and ""a view."" We didn't care about the view and honestly didn't care at that point about the single bed - we decided to shove it next to the king bed so my 4-year old wouldn't fall off. My husband was so frustrated he went to talk to a manager who offered us dinner at the restaurant. We weren't looking for dinner and honestly just wanted to forget the whole thing, but the damage was done. We wasted a lot of time packing, repacking and unpacking then losing our things. Hilton could have done a lot better communicating and fixing this problem. They easily could have found us a room (upgraded or not) to keep us in for the three nights, but they didn't. They blamed the fact that there were two reservations - but they could have seen this well before we arrived and solved this problem. Overall, I think they were a good hotel, but need to figure out issues like this before people arrive. Its an expensive hotel with a good reputation that left a very sour taste in my mouth.  ",3,2019,07,16
240,Nice hotel,"This is a very clean and nice hotel near all the great spots. The jail is about 5 steps away, great pub on opposite corner. Staff is friendly, location is ideal. The pool is lovely after a long day. (Need a pool cap- which can be purchased there for a couple of bucks). Highly recommend it! Lives up to the Hilton name.",4,2019,07,12
240,Hilton Review - Dublin,"Enjoyed my stay at the Hilton Dublin Kilmainham Hotel. Close walking distance to so many things! 
Employees were friendly, helpful, and professional. Hotel was clean and neat. I was very comfortable. 
My only critique would be that the furniture in the lobby could be updated and there could be better accessibility to the building (did not see a ramp for wheelchairs from the street, only steps). The wheelchair access appeared to be off to the side and not easy to get to from a cab (I don't recall but it may have been near the entry to the parking structure). Our group was able to walk to the Guinness Storehouse for a tour but it was a bit of a distance. In all, a terrific hotel in a great part of Dublin and I'm hopeful to return.  ",5,2019,07,12
240,Excellent Hotel,"Staff at reception are always helpful and try their best to accommodate. Any housekeeping staff I encountered were friendly and always said a hello with a smile. Rooms are always cleaned to a high standard, and beds are comfortable. Bathrooms have good storage space and mirrors, along with plenty of toiletries which are replenished daily.
I'm always delighted with this hotel as I never hear any other guests while there, and get a good nights sleep. The car park is very convenient, and it's good value at ‚Ç¨12 per night. Taxis right outside are also great, or it's only a short walk to the nearest Luas stop. I can't comment on the food as I don't take the breakfast as I think it's a little pricey, that's the only slight negative I have with this hotel. Any problems are always sorted quickly, and I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Dublin. Can't wait for my next stay at the weekend.",5,2019,07,04
240,"Very disappointed, very very noisy","One good thing is that the food in the restaurant was very nice and I would go there again for lunch.  

I would NOT stay in a room in this hotel ever again due to the amount of noise from the front of the building.  The hotel has lay by that guests use to get taxis which is directly across from the jail.  Everyday 30 or 40 minutes cars are beeping their horns due to the taxis parking in a restricted area and stopping access into the hotel car park.  I stayed here for 4 days and the noise of people shouting at the taxi drivers and blowing their horns constantly throughout the day was very distressing.

I complained to the staff and they told why it was happening and why it was so noisy but they said it was not their problem.  Unfortunately it is the hotels problem as I met other guests in the hotel who could not sleep either due to the noise of cars blowing horns and people arguing with the taxi drivers late into the evenings and the early mornings and throughout the day.

I felt that no one seemed to be bothered by my issues and they just brushed it off.  If you are bothered by loud noise of cars beeping and people shouting I would not stay here.",2,2019,07,02
240,Lovely hotel,"The Hilton Kilmainham is a lovely place to stay. It s location is a very short taxi ride or
About 20 min walk from the centre. Rooms are spacious and well appointed. The staff is attentive, breakfast was good and the gym was great. Recommended.",4,2019,06,29
240,Good hotel away from the centre,"Good hotel located away from the centre but convenient for our business meeting nearby.
Friendly and efficient check in staff, nice room, however it was a twin rather than a double :-(
Bar food was good, but service very slow (and it wasn't that busy)
Breakfast good",4,2019,06,28
240,First Stay in Dublin,The hotel overall was very nice. The room was decent size and very clean and decorated nicely. Their bar/restaurant was also nice. The bar staff was very helpful. We only went into have couple of drinks to end our night. Only thing I wish they would have is better loading & unloading area which was covered. We were soaked and so was our baggage when we arrived. But overall great hotel to stay at. ,4,2019,06,27
240,Ireland experience,Wonderful experience. Very clean and comfortable. The staff is supper nice and offers hi quality customer service. It added that much more to the already great experience of traveling Ireland. I would most likely return and highly recommend Hilton.   ,5,2019,06,27
240,Have kids? Perfect.,"This hotel is the perfect size, not too big, not too small, for travelers with kids. Excellent spa/pool. Kids are free for buffet breakfast. Literally across the street from Kilmainham Gaol, which is informative and also makes your skin crawl. Perfect sneaky educational activity for kids. Quick bus ride to downtown. ",4,2019,06,26
240,Excellent hotel - superb staff,"Really enjoyed my stay here. Outstanding welcome and hospitality. Staff very well trained and very competent. Friendly and did job really well. A true reflection of Hilton standards of hospitality. Lifetime Diamond member. Excellent upgrade from standard room to a high floor room with a balcony. Very impressed with the cleanliness and comfort of the room. Slept very well. Lovely hand - written welcome card from Front Desk staff thanking me for my loyalty. Made me feel very welcome and valued as a very welcome Hilton guest. Breakfast excellent. Well stocked and good range of food. I found LUAS nearby (7 minute's walk to Suir Road) was very convenient. My work was at Tallaght Hospital so superb to be able to use public transport. Also used Luas to central Dublin to meet friends for dinner. This hotel is really comfortable and in a good location. Its main asset is the wonderful people who work there. Thanks for your kindness. I was so pleased with my single night Sunday stay that I have moved 7 nights at another place to stay here as it is easy to get to work! I look forward to my return visits. Hilton can be proud of your service, hospitality and standards.",5,2019,06,19
240,Excellent hotel with very good connection to public transport,"The breakfast buffet was very good, the room had an excellent overview over Kilmainham Gaol and vincity. The gym was excellent only disappointing was that on weekends it only opens at 8 am.
The room in general was spacy and the bath was as well very good.",5,2019,06,17
240,Consistently the Best!!!,"Third visit to this hotel and it is consistently the best. Every trip has been wonderful. The service provided by Ana at the front desk has been outstanding every time! She makes us never want to try another hotel when in Dublin. Great location and easy parking. Very comfortable rooms with views of the city. Nice bar and restaurant.
You cannot go wrong here. ",5,2019,06,16
240,Best hotel experience,"This hotel is the one that I always insist upon staying when I am in Dublin. The staff and the amenities are by far the best I have experience in Ireland and the UK. I feel less like a guest there and more like family. Conveniently located on the outskirts of city center (15 minute walk to city) and easily accessible to all highways. Also, in historic Kilmainham right across the street from the Kilmainham Jail. ",5,2019,06,13
240,Lovely stay at Hilton Kilmainham,I stayed at the Hilton Kilmainham for a long weekend with my nan and mum. The room/ hotel was spotlessly clean (cleaner was lovely!) The beds were so comfortable and the room was quiet despite a festival taking place at the park opposite. There was so much variety at breakfast and the food quality was excellent. We chose this hotel because it has a pool as a special treat for ourselves and we were indulged with the luxury of it. The extra touches to make our stay more special were really appreciated. Location was spot on for exploring Dublin. We would definitely stay again :),5,2019,06,07
240,Great hotel,"Spa was out of service and very limited late night foods, otherwise it was an amazing place to stay. About a mile or more walk into downtown Dublin but with nice weather it‚Äôs very enjoyable! Taxis are easily accessible as well. Service was great, everyone was very nice and helpful. ",4,2019,06,03
240,a wonderful staff ... Excellent service and help by Ana at the front desk.,"Room was great.  Everything there that I needed.  Bed was very comfortable. Staff  was helpful and polite.  Breakfast was included and was awesome.  Great buffet.
Location was near the museum , just a short walk.",5,2019,06,02

240,Great,"Hotel was great, when close to a busy road traffic was hardly noticeable, hotel staff friendly, food was plenty especially at breakfast. Spa facilities good could have done with some chairs or loungers to relax on. 
A bit out the way of the city but if you like walking, Then a great place to stay. ",5,2019,05,25
240,Lovely hotel,"Perfect location, short drive from busy centre. We had a room with a view and it was stunning. Staff were accommodating friendly kind approachable, nothing was trouble.  We ran out of teabags, and we asked for a couple more, within minutes we had lots of teabags, sugar, hot chocolate! Bed was soo comfortable, all very clean. Breakfast was Devine with fresh honey you can watch drip down out of the honeycomb. It was a beautiful stay there. We went for a run in the morning along the canal which is close to the hotel and stunning. All staff were friendly helping us with local area. We used the gym which wasn‚Äôt too big so just right for me (not a regular user of gyms) we loved it so much we wish every hotel we stay in would be that one. ",4,2019,05,24
240,Wonderful Introduction to Ireland,"A very fortunate choice, with an excellent, very helpful staff. The lobby is welcoming, and the staff immediately made us feel comfortable. We arrived very early in the morning from our flight, and they graciously stored our luggage and provided helpful information about what we might see and do for the first day, including the Kilmainham Gaol across the street, which proved a site vital to understanding contemporary Irish history. The restaurants in the hotel were exceptional, with a delicious, wide-ranging breakfast buffet, as well as a charming bar area with outstanding dinner choices. We were introduced to Red Breast Irish whiskey, which has remained a favorite. Daniel was particularly helpful here, and is to be commended for both first rate hospitality and knowledgeable assistance. Hop On/Hop Off bus right outside takes you to all main attractions. Highly recommend.",5,2019,05,24
240,Wonderful room and excellent service,"My family of 6 (2 adults, 2 kids and 2 grandparents) stayed for a week.  The rooms were comfortable and the front desk was very helpful in getting us information. Nikita, in the restaurant was amazing!! She talked with us each morning to ensure we were all having a good time and made sure we knew where to go for our day‚Äôs activities. My children enjoyed seeing her each morning - she made our stay perfect! ",4,2019,05,23

240,Lovely rooms and great food,"i only stayed one night, but would definitely stay there again when next in Dublin.  I was on an upper floor with a balcony and fantastic view.  The avocado toast for breakfast was one of my favorite versions ever.  Staff was pleasant and professional.",5,2019,05,21
240,Killmainham Hilton,A wonderful hotel. Close to city. Most courteous knowledgeable staff. Great hotel restaurant. Across the street from the infamous Killmainham Jail. Beautiful pool and amenities. Wonderful sitting on the patio.  ,5,2019,05,21
240,One Of the Best Hilton‚Äôs !,We were fortunate enough to have had the good fortune of staying at the Hilton in Dublin Kilmainham pre and post our Celebrity Reflection cruise.  The hotel is conveniently located and well appointed.  They included breakfast and a $50 food and beverage credit daily which was by far one of the best deals and the food and service was excellent.  Their Concierge Ana was extremely in guiding us towards our tour guide Chaperone VIP Private Tours and he turned out to be Simply the Best Tour guide ever.  The hotel is extremely clean and the staff here is outstanding.  If you ever find yourself in Dublin it is the go to place to stay!  Thank you Ana and your staff for a job well done !,5,2019,05,20
240,Nice hotel.,"We only stayed one night here before we took off on a tour of Ireland, but it was a great place to stay.  It was close to the Heuston Rail Station, where our tour left from.  We arrived pretty early in the morning so didn't really expect to be able to get into a room right away.  They said we could drop the luggage off though.  When we showed up about 9:00 am to do so, one of our three rooms was ready so we able to freshen up a bit before heading out for the day.  A couple of our group had a meal in the restaurant and said it was quite good.  ",5,2019,05,18
240,Perfect location,Hilton Kilmainham is in the perfect spot for business or pleasure. Rooms are spacious clean & comfortable. Bar and restaurant lovely space to chill and ear. You can sit out side & see the historical Kilmainham jail or wander across the road for a stroll in the gardens of modern museum.i would highly recommend it for all types of stays.,5,2019,05,15
240,Good hotel at right price,"Location is good for taxi and tourist bus route. City center in easy reach.
Staff very helpful and rooms are comfortable. Lower floor parking. 
I would stay there again. I had difficulty with my online booking but the online help sorted it for me. Very happy with our stay. ",4,2019,05,15
240,Perfect location for sightseeing in Dublin plus relaxation,"We stayed here for a conference. My son and I took two days to sightsee in Dublin, and I think this Hilton has an excellent location.  You can pick up the Hop On Hop Off right outside the hotel by the Gaol and quickly by on your touristy way. After hours or a day in the traffic and crowds of Dublin city, we would get off the bus at Phoenix Park and have some outdoor time before walking back to the hotel (an easy, beautiful walk). For kids it's a great way to relax and unwind before dinner. (okay, for adults, too). 

Sometimes hotels seem not so excited about kids.  I did NOT experience that here. 

Their breakfast and restaurant are excellent. A shout out to their kids meal options--more options than we're used to with healthy dishes like fruit plates. When traveling, to be able to get something on a kid's menu besides fries/chips is SO welcome. All the servers and employees were amazingly helpful any time we had a question. 

And of course, the room was spacious, well-appointed, clean and comfortable. With so much walking I didn't take advantage of their fitness center but it looked good :)",5,2019,05,10
240,LivingWell Health Club Kilmainham,"Eight months ago i wanted to make a change in my life and i started with LivingWell club. I was delighted how gym personnel are kind, helpful and honest. 
Through 8 months of working-out there i was able to lose 7 kg, and i had big help from Cristian Dutoiu who is personal trainer and fitness coach there. 
With his advice on how to track my daily intake of calories, I learned about calories and healthy eating, also my exercise plan was great and helpful towards achieving my goal.  
I highly recommend LivingWell club!",5,2019,05,07
240,Best Hilton Around,We stayed in Dublin 4 days prior to our cruise and this hotel is by far one of the best Hilton‚Äôs we have stayed in.  It is clean and very well appointed and a very comfortable hotel while traveling.  The breakfast buffet is outstanding and the restaurant and bar is equally as excellent with 5 star service all the way.  Ana the concierge is extremely helpful and will assist you with whatever your needs are whether it be touring or shopping etc.  she recommended Eamonn at Chaperone VIP Tours to us and he was the best guide ever and because of his expertise we were fortunate to see the very best of Ireland like the locals do.  A definite place to return on our next visit to Dublin‚ù§Ô∏è,5,2019,05,05
240,Relaxing and convenient ,"We enjoyed our visit here. The rooms are clean and comfortable, with a small refrigerator, the maid service bring water daily. There is a hot water pot for tea and coffee in your room which is replenished daily.  They have a gym onsite and indoor poor, it was great. The hotel has a bar/lounge with ample seating. Also a breakfast in the morning. The hotel has a lunch and dinner menu as well. We ate at the hotel a couple of times and it was good. They have a couple of options for picky eaters like me and my son. ",4,2019,04,27

240,Well positioned on the edge of the city,The price was good on the night I was looking to book a room and I had a meeting on that side of town in the morning. The hotel is very pleasant and the staff extremely efficient and friendly. The sleep quality was good and the noise levels very low. I would stay here again,4,2019,04,15
240,Good enough,"I enjoyed my stay - the room was big enough, the bed was comfortable. In general is it very standard Hilton. I also liked their restaurant - it was probably the best place to eat in the evening  despite the fact we visited several other expensive restaurants. What I didn't like - the quality of food which was served to us during the breaks at the meetings we've had in the hotel - it was mainly sandwiches and the bread was fresh only at day 1 of the meeting. 3 next days the bread was far from being fresh and thus the whole sandwich was ugly. Further the staff always forgot to bring something with the food - either folks or napkins etc. Hotel breakfast although was nice.",4,2019,04,14
240,Incredible Dublin,"The staff was so friendly and accommodating. Complimentary drinks, delicious salmon burgers, prompt service and concierge calls for transport. The room was clean, bed comfy and just an all around great experience‚Äî central enough to get to all of the locations I wanted to visit and cool walking experience.",4,2019,04,13
240,Hilton wrapping up the Hotel market in Dublin!,"Hotels can be really hit and miss in Dublin. Even those with good reviews sometimes have different grades of rooms or allow standards to drop in busy periods. Hilton appears to be the exception from this norm offering consistently excellent service and rooms in convenient locations.

The Kilmainham hotel is a moderate walk to the city center, or a short taxi ride. It's convenient for Phoenix Park for a very pleasant run (weather permitting) and the in-house restaurant is pretty good too. The hotel boasts a gym (which is large by hotel standards) that is also available to non-guests. There is also a spa area with pool, jacuzzi, steam and sauna which was good to have, but perhaps in need of a little TLC.

Rooms are of a good size and clean as one would expect from this brand. 

On the whole a very pleasant stay.",5,2019,04,13
240,Excellent Customer Service by Front Desk Staff,"I arrived to the hotel and Aer Lingus had lost our luggage. We were having a bit of an off day with losing our luggage and the front desk staff was very welcoming. She quickly advised us that once the luggage did arrive the front desk would advise. She quickly opened a map of the city and explained the top places that we should visit. I asked her where all the ‚Äú Penney‚Äôs‚Äù were at and she was very knowledgeable about the top places to shop. I was very surprised and she turned our day from negative to positive. 
The room was clean and the food from in room dining was delicious. I am only disappointed at how far from the city center it is but the the hop on/off stop is right In front of the hotel.",5,2019,04,10
240,Lunch trips,"I've come here to eat for family events, to catch up with friends and as a quick pit stop with the baby under my arm when I've needed to refuel, and I have never been dissatisfied. The food is top notch. The staff are friendly. They accommodate my 1 year old every time he's with me. The prices are reasonable and the location is fabulous. I'd recommend the chicken wings if your going to go for anything. They are to die for!",5,2019,04,10
240,Dublin Work Visit,"Hotel was very clean and tidy, room was great enough space and good quality.  Nice bar just off entrance/reception area.  A couple of nice restaurants just across the road within walking distance Dolce Vita and Union 8 if you fancy something different to eating in the Hotel restaurant.  Handy location just outside the main city centre.",5,2019,04,09

240,"Outstanding Room, Great Hotel, Unfortunately a Poor Sleep","I stayed here for one night by myself in March 2019 on business - although I paid for this hotel and chose it by myself, as I am a Hilton Honors Silver member. It was not my first time in Dublin of course, but my first time in this Hilton property - infact my first time in any Hilton property in my native Ireland. I needed to be out in Damastown on business the next morning and having taken the train up from Cork to Dublin Heuston station, I also chose this hotel as a sort of location compromise between the station and Damastown. I saw it was not far at all from Heuston station, and Google Maps made it look like a not too long or difficult taxi drive out to the M50, and to Damastown from there. In reality, the taxi drive from Heuston when I arrived in Dublin took less than 5 minutes (you could walk it in 10-15 minutes), and the taxi to Damastown took about 30-40 minutes - the driver took a different route through the Phoenix Park rather than straight out to the M50, because it was a car park that morning. Of course, it appears to be that way every morning I'm told.
The room type I booked and got was ""King Deluxe Room"". As I mentioned, I'm a Hilton Honours Silver member, so I was able to check-in online the day before I arrived on my phone using the Hilton Honors app, and chose my room using the floor plan map. I chose a room with an East facing view on the 4th floor, which was one floor down from the top if I recall correctly. When I got to the hotel, I proceeded to the check-in desk to get my key. The receptionist was very friendly and professional. This check-in experience took a few minutes despite having checked-in online - I used a Visa Debit card for the booking, and because of this, I was told I would need to pay the full room rate with the card then and there. I consented to this of course, to save time in the morning because I had an early start. The woman checking in next to me had to do the same also because I overheard she booked with a Visa Debit card as well. I also asked while I was checking in, if they could order me a taxi for the next morning to Damastown, for 8.30am. I needed to be there for 9.15am. She did this for me, and told me the taxi driver would come into reception in the morning for me. That was all great - with everything completed, I got my keys, and went up to my room.

Room: As I mentioned in the Introduction, my room type was ""King Deluxe Room"". I was thoroughly impressed with the room from the moment I walked in - very big and spacious, with a private balcony as well. The hotel is quite new, and the room had an airy, bright, modern, and clean feel to it straight away. There was a small entrance hallway that contained the wardrobes/cupboards with a safe, tea/coffee making facilities, bathrobes with slippers, hairdryer, and an ironing-board and iron. There's a foldaway luggage stand in the hallway as well, along with the entrance into the bathroom. The main room then itself is essentially divided in two - on the one side, a big king bed, and on the other, a lounge seating/work area with armchairs, coffee table, and work-desk. Dividing them up in the middle is an extended part of the work desk which contained a flatscreen TV, facing in the direction of the bed. On each side of the bed, there are bedside tables with a phone on one side, and alarm-clock on the other. Each side contained electrical plugs in the wall, and even separate USB ports for charging portable devices - really convenient indeed. Over in the work area, on-top of the desk there is a coffee-pod machine with some sample pods from Bewleys, as well as two bottles of complimentary water - one still and one sparking, and glasses of course. In the cupboards/drawers of the work desk, there are wine glasses and an ice bucket (however, I could find no ice-machine, nor did the hotel guide mention how to get ice), an Ethernet cable, and a minibar. The minibar was just an empty fridge though, not stocked with anything. Everything spotlessly clean.
The bathroom was also excellent. It featured separate bathtub (with showerhead) and a rainfall shower. Towels and washcloths (facecloths) were provided. In an unusual but welcome change from most Hilton hotels where the bathroom amenities are from the Peter Thomas Roth range, the amenities here were from Crabtree & Evelyn, and included the usual shampoo, conditioner, bath/shower gel, soap bar, etc. The bathroom, like the room, was spotlessly clean.
The entire hotel including the rooms included fast, free Wi-Fi, that did not require a password. There was a full room-service menu available as well - the all-day menu is available from 12.00 - 10.30pm, with some items being available 24-hours. There was functioning air conditioning as well, which I didn't feel was making the room as warm as I was setting it to be (it was very cold weather outside at the time so the room was a bit cool), but it did work. It featured one major annoyance hat seriously disturbed my sleep which I will mention shortly.
The room as I mentioned also featured a private balcony. This was pretty cool with some great views. It featured a small table and two chairs. Artificial hedges blocked the view into the neighbouring balconies. 
There was one aspect of the room which I did not like, which I hinted at was the air conditioning. As it was cold, I had the air conditioning on all evening when I was in the room. As it turns out though, it turns itself off after about an hour, so I could not leave it on to keep the room warm during the night for when I woke up in the morning. That was not the only problem however‚Ä¶ I eventually did turn it off as I was going to bed, since I knew from earlier it would not stay on anyway. What it did do though, at various times during the night, I daresay at least once or twice each half an hour, was make a lot of noise, as if it was turning itself on at a high speed setting, and then go off again after about 5-10 minutes. This actually kept me awake until at least 2am, and was quite distracting I must say, and I woke several times throughout the night as a result.
The other event that happened around 6.30am, was that I thought, but was not sure at the time, was that the fire alarm went off, literally for around a second, maybe two at most. It was so brief and I was half-alsleep/half-awake (due to the air conditioning), that I thought my mind was playing tricks on me. Only after I got up and went out of my room to go down for breakfast did I realise that all the fire doors in the corridor outside the rooms going down to the lifts, had all shut - I actually opened those in my path back properly to their open position, where they had ball been open when I went into my room for the night. When I came back up from breakfast, all doors had been fully opened again. So from this I assume it was not a mind trick at all, and the fire alarm did indeed go off. There was no notice at reception or anything to say what had happened, as I have seen in other hotels I have stayed in when the fire alarms went off. This was a distressing event because I did not know if there was a real emergency, and should I have got up out of bed and left, or what was doing on.
Overall, outstanding room and bathroom, and really comfortable bed. Just a great shame about the air conditioning during the night, and the alarm, which led to a not-so-great sleep at all.
Pictures of the room and bathroom are attached to this review.

Dining: Lunch and dinner is served in the hotel at the Broyage Bar & Bistro. I dined here for dinner on the evening I arrived. You can just walk in, no reservation required, and take a seat anywhere. There was a good dining menu with a lot of choice. As a starter, I had the ""Chef's Soup of the Day, with Bread Selection"". The soup was winter vegetable, and was delicious, I finished it all. More of a watery soup than a thick one. For the main course, I had ""Seasme Crusted Fillet Of Salmon, with roasted asparagus, baby, potatoes, and herb butter"". I got a side order of ""Home Cut Fries"" with this as well. This was a very nice fish indeed, nicely presented. I didn't have any dessert. The service was friendly, and relatively fast, which was good because it was getting late.
Breakfast is served in another dining room, called ""Cinnamon Restaurant"". I was a bit confused because on the website it says it is only open for breakfast, and group dinners. However, on my way back to my room from my dinner at Broyage, it looked indeed as if it was open, and I could smell food coming out of there. At any rate, for breakfast, which is served from 7am onwards, they have the usual buffet selections of cereals, cold fruits and meats, breads/pastries, and help-yourself hot food selection. I think the waitress said to me on the way in I could order hot eggs or something from them directly to be prepared fresh, but there were no menus on the tables for anything like that. I just stuck to a cereal, toast, and yogurts that were on offer.
Pictures of my dinner in Broyage are attached to this review.
 
Service: I have to say that everyone I encountered in the hotel was very friendly and professional. I generally had no issues at all with the service, apart from two things which I mention here for completeness.
First of all, I ordered a large bottle of water to be delivered to my room at 10pm, using the Hilton Honors app, the day before I arrived, just so I could have some cold water aside from the complimentary water I assumed would be sitting in the room and not chilled. It said on the app that this would be added to my bill. The bottle of water never did arrive. I thought of ringing down for it. Then of course, I remembered that I had paid my rate in full upon arrival at reception. I had been handed my receipt in an envelope, which I had not looked at so far. I decided to open the envelope then to see had I been charged for the water or not, and it turns out, I had not. There was no mention of the water on the receipt. On this basis I said, fair enough, I had already paid the room rate, and had not been charged for the water, so rather than ordering it and having to spend time paying for it at check-out in the morning, I just wouldn't bother with it. The mystery of where that request for the bottle of water ended up from the app continues to this day‚Ä¶.
The other issue I had was with the taxi that I described in the Introduction that I had ordered at reception when I arrived. I had been told that the driver would come down into the lobby to collect me. I was there 10-minutes before my scheduled pick-up time of 8.30am, and saw many taxi-drivers come in to pick up taxi orders. Nobody came for me. Several came in, and I actually asked them were they for me, and none of them were, they had other room numbers. At about 8.40, I went up to reception, and asked the receptionist could they check on the status of my taxi. She rang the company the hotel uses, and it turns out they my driver took someone else instead, and they would send another one, who would be there in 5 minutes. I could not understand how that could be, since I saw everyone who came in and out the door from the taxis, as they pulled up outside the door. After about 10-15 minutes, nobody came, and then that same receptionist came over to me at the door, and told me the driver was stuck in traffic, and would be another 5 minutes. He did then arrive in 5 minutes this time, and came in for me. It's interesting because when I came down first at 8.20am, there were a few free taxis outside the door for hire, but I chose to wait since I had reserved one with the hotel. By 8.30am, all the free taxis were gone, and not another one came by into the taxi rank the entire time I was waiting. I made my meeting at 9.30am just as they were closing the door to start, when they had actually wanted us there in the room at 9.15am. I was happy that he receptionist looked after me, but it was a good job I went over in the first place and enquired about it, otherwise how would I have known that my taxi driver took someone else in my place.

Location: As I mentioned in the Introduction, the hotel is less than 5-minute drive from Heuston station (or a 10-15 minute walk straight up the road from the station). The LUAS trams can be caught from the station as well to take you into the city centre. I wouldn't be walking into the College Green or O'Connell street area from there though. It is an excellent location though all the same, just across the road from the Kilmainham Gaol, and the gardens of the Royal Hospital.

Overall: Thoroughly impressed with the hotel overall, the room was truly fantastic, and service excellent. The Broyage Bar and Bistro I thought was also great. Given the short distance from Heuston station, it is ideal for me the next time I have business in Damastown. Just a real shame about the air-conditioning (I assume it just had to be a fault but I'm not sure...) and alarm, because aside from that and the taxi, my stay would have been perfect. I would have no trouble recommending the hotel, I'm sure I'll be returning - I'd certainly be willing to give it another chance just to see was the air-conditioning noise in my room a fluke. I thought about giving this a three star rating instead of four, but that would not be fair I think given the high quality of everything else for this short stay.",4,2019,04,02
240,Awesome Stay,We stayed several nights at the Hilton Dublin Kilmainham.  The front staff was wonderful and very helpful.  They have a restaurant/bar on site which was very convenient.  The room was very clean and cozy.  The hotel is on the outskirts of Dublin which was perfect for us.  We would definitely stay there again.  ,5,2019,04,01
240,Excellent,"Everything was excellent, location was nice,  not the ideal city center, but still very close and much quieter than the noisy and bustling city center full of pubs.I would recommend to anyone. Staff is also very  helpful and ready to assist. ",5,2019,04,01
240,Nice Hotel but beds are too hard to sleep on,"While the hotel is very nice, the beds were very, very hard and felt like you were TRYING to sleep on springs.  Got very little sleep.  Also the A/C seemed to go off during the night and the room got very uncomfortable.  That is the worst of it - the hotel is centrally located.  We took a bus to the shopping district and it was very convenient.  The breakfast was very good and the one dinner we had at the hotel was great.",4,2019,03,31
240,Overnight.,Stayed just one night. Very pleasant decor.  Staff helpful courteous and polite. The room was spacious. Very high standard.  I like fresh air. No window I could open. Plus it overlooked a very busy road anyway. Car parking was an issue. I packed on street a fair bit away. Couldnt park on street close to hotel. The dinner at night was excellent. However the room was very noisey.  A good nights sleep. Breakfast was super (and quiet). Wide choice. All in all a good stay. Maybe a bit pricey for me.,4,2019,03,29
240,All was good,The hotel staff and service were excellent. The hotel is not in the cneter of Dublin if yopu are looking for the Temple Bar districk or nightlife but it is only a 10 euro cab fare. Tne hotel is located right across the street from the Hop On-Hop Off bus stop and also the Kilmainham Jail tour. the jail tour is excellent and well worth it. The only thing I would do is tour the GPO (Post office tour) first as that tour gives the history and background of the revolution and the rebels who were executed at the jail.,5,2019,03,28
240,i stayed recently,"i stayed here recently i had a fantastic experience , the food was lovely and Olivia was my waitress and she was fantastic , i would definitely recommend , its in a prime location and the gym is nice also",5,2019,03,28
240,Amazing Staff!,I ate here at the Hilton and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised! The waitress Olivia was absolutely fantastic. She went totally above and beyond to us. She was already really busy because it seemed as though it may have been short staffed but she took time out of her already busy day to tell us about the best spots in the city and drew us a quick map of how to get there easier. The food was second to none with plenty of choice for different dietary needs. Was really impressed with the Hilton Kilmainham and thank you to you Olivia!,5,2019,03,27
240,Great Stay!,"I strongly recommend this hotel for visiting Dublin. It is easy to get to the city center by bus. The hotel staff were friendly and very helpful. We were upgraded to a deluxe room on 4th floor with a large balcony. The breakfast is definitely worth the money if you book the breakfast included rate. It has great selection of both cold and hot food. The cooked-to-order pancake (crepes) and omelet are also fantastic. 

The bathroom has both standing shower and bathtub (seperately!) Overall very clean and cozy room. ",5,2019,03,27
240,Fab hotel!,"Just got back from staying here for two nights.

Location is a bit far out from the airport so we got a taxi - looking at around 40 euros for a taxi, quite expensive but who can be bothered getting the bus when it only takes about 25 mins in a car.

Reception is stunning and our room was on the fourth floor right at the very end, was cleaned beautifully. The cleaner did actually come to check if everything was ok with the room which was cute! We had a massive double bed and a single bed in the room too.

Coffee tray had lotus biscuits on, love them! Glass bottled water which was a nice touch, tv fully working with all English channels. Beds were comfy and the pillows were big and fluffy. 

Shower was powerful and there was lovely toiletries to use. Hairdryer was powerful and decent not like those rubbish travel sized hairdryers usually in hotels.

One thing I would say is the room was quite cold.. because the aircon/heating was a nightmare to work and didn‚Äôt get hot at all, the symbols on the instructions don‚Äôt match the right heating setting on the thermostat? So no idea what you do there.

No fault with the hotel but our neighbour couldn‚Äôt stop sneezing at 4am and it was soooo loud, like the walls were paper thin or she was in the room with us. Only thing that bothered me really and that‚Äôs nothing.

We didn‚Äôt go for breakfast because ‚Ç¨16 is a bit excessive!

We visited the spa, it‚Äôs lovely! Hydrotherapy pool was very nice and warm, sauna and steam room perfect temperature.

Reception has orange and lemon water that tastes lovely and kept cold.

Check in and check out was fast and easy, staff all nice and friendly and can give you advice on where to travel etc.

Didn‚Äôt get any food at the hotel but we went to the Italian 2mins walk and the pizza was decent from there and they do take card!!

It‚Äôs a nice location really, bit of a walk to the city centre around 40 mins if you‚Äôre speedy but it is quite a nice walk, you can see the Guinness storehouse on the walk to town.

Kilmainham jail is close to the hotel, as is the Irish modern arts museum which is quite worth going to see!

Lovely stay and I would actually visit again, nice that they have a spa. We booked because it was close to st James hospital for my boyfriends course but it was a great stay and fab location overall, thank you! ",5,2019,03,24
240,Lovely hotel in peaceful location,"I had noticed this hotel when I visited Kilmainham Gaol in the past and made up my mind to stay here next time. It's a bit out of the centre, but with the Google Maps app it was no problem getting buses and the tram into the centre. The room was lovely especially the King Size Bed and I liked having an empty fridge. Nice bathroom with Crabtree and Evelyn toiletries. The hotel was near to the Musuem of Modern Art and also the Irish War Memorial which is situated in a beautiful spot near the River Liffey. Staff were helpful.",5,2019,03,23
240,Great location,This Hilton is in a good location Southwest of downtown but in a good location across the street from the Dublin Gaol and Royal Hospital.  Great pub across the street call The Patriot. We walked less than 1 mile to the Guinness Storehouse. ,5,2019,03,23
240,Location!!,"This hotel is in a great location with tons to see within walking distance. Restaurants, pubs and attractions. The rooms are a bit tight, but we didn't spend much time in the room. Bathrooms were modern and clean. Most importantly, the staff was very friendly and accommodating. Highly recommend this hotel! ",5,2019,03,22
240,The Hilton never disappoints,"We stayed here on the 16/03/19 for two nights for the St.Patrick‚Äôs Day weekend. The price was extremely reasonable for the weekend. The room was spacious, bright and very clean. 

We opted to include breakfast and were not disappointed. There was plenty of variety, cereals, fruit, hot foods, cheese and meats etc, plenty of hot and cold drinks. I believe there was an option to order things such as eggs any way you like and pancakes. Really enjoyed the breakfast.

Location was opposite Kilmainham Gaol which is a great option to visit. There‚Äôs a lovely pub across the road called the Patriot‚Äôs Inn which we also visited.

We visited the Guinness Storehouse and the Jameson‚Äôs Distillery which we were able to walk to about (15 min walk) or else you could have gotten a taxi. Slightly further from Temple Bar, option of walking or taxi. 

We never ate in the hotel restaurant/ bar although it did look lovely and was busy any night we were there.

There is an option of car parking at ‚Ç¨12 per night which we availed of. Our car was in a secure car park.

The gym and pool facilities were both great too.",5,2019,03,19
240,Glowing Irish hospitality,"Warm and welcoming hospitality at this property. The rooms are large and well appointed. Comfortable beds and lovely bathroom amenities.Housekeeping keeps everything immaculate....even the stairways are swept and vacuumed. The fitness centre and pool are not large, but it is just what you need. The bar/restaurant has a good menu, quality food and the breakfast buffet in the morning sets you up for the day!
Location is excellent. The hotel is directly across from Kilmainham Jail--a must see historic site, and close to the Museum of Modern Art. The two hop-on-hop-off buses stop directly outside the hotel. Public transport is a block away (buses to downtown), and the Luas (light rapid transit) is a very short walk. Heuston train station is also close by, and the Airbus to/from the airport drops you there. You can also walk into Dublin city centre in 30 minutes.",5,2019,03,18
240,St Patrick's weekend,"Very friendly hotel but a little lacking in local knowledge when the trams weren't running. Reception staff had no knowledge of which bus to catch into the city centre. Took nearly 2 days to find out where nearest tram stop was.... Got talking to someone in the spa area. Returned to room at gone 16:00 only to find it hadn't been serviced due to the young lady being "" very busy"" ( her words) felt obliged to go downstairs into bar and wait for it to be done. Bar staff extremely friendly and helpful. Spa area a must but don't forget your swim hats they are a mandatory requirement in the hotel. 
Nearest stop for the tram is suir road... NOT JAMES'S.",4,2019,03,18
240,excellent,"nothing much to tell but great, they even took care of great weather when I was there. :)

240,Excellent hotel with excellent location!,"Hotel was part of a Globus tour so we didn't know what to expect.  The hotel was lovely and the staff was wonderful.  Front end staff was friendly and accommodating.Room was spacious and well-appointed. (See photos).  It was a little out of the city but there was a cab stand right in front with about a 12 euro charge to get into the city.  Right across from the Kilmainham Gaol and caddy corner from the walkway to the Musuem of Modern Art and a lovely park.  The buffet breakfast was excellent and served nicely.  We could not have asked for a better start to our vacation.  In a lovely residential type area and across the street from a pub.  We had a room for 3 and we had plenty of room to walk around and store our ""stuff.""  We arrived early and they hed out bags until check in.  No ATM but one at the gas station across the street.  We had no car, but there was a parking garage on the premises. Hotel had a beautiful pool and exercise room which we did not use, but did see. There is also a small restaurand coffee shop in the hotel itself.   Would highly recommend!",5,2019,03,07
240,Impeccable service,"High quality, amazing personnel, reasonable cost. Great experience!

In the first day I had a minor noise problem coming form the A/C unit (I am very sensitive with sleep) and the reception lady made sure that I would change in a new, very quiet and very comfortable room.

Great facilities too.",5,2019,03,05
240,In Dublin's Fair City,Great stay in hotel directly opposite Kilmainham Gaol. We arrived early but the receptionist allowed us to check in straight away. Room was clean and bright with proper wooden coathangers. The en suite had both a shower and bath. Breakfast was served until 10am and there was a massive choice of options. Anne was very helpful when we had an issue at breakfast on the firat day. Alan on reception was also helpful when we needed to arrange a late check out. There is an indoor pool and gym but we did not use these facilities. Would certainly stay here again.,5,2019,03,04
240,Amazing Time,"Booked a weekend away for my Husband's birthday, and im so glad of the choice i made. The hotel is lovely modern and very clean. Reception staff were friendly and efficient, we arrived to an upgraded room with a balcony and complimentary chocolates, hilton teddy and card for his birthday.  Its the little things that mean alot.
The restaurant food was amazing the butternut squash soup was so creamy and tasty the bread was so light and fresh, the steaks were cooked to our liking with very little fat and the chocolate brownie was delicious.
Breakfast was equally as good with a hot and cold buffet included in our hotel deal. Restaurant staff were also very friendly and helpful nothing was a bother.  
The jacuzzi was lovely and hot and the hydrotherapy pool was a first for us. Thank you to all staff for making our weekend at the Hilton so wonderful. We will be back.",5,2019,02,24
240,Comfortable,"Myself & my partner stayed here for a night away in the city. It‚Äôs a little further out so taxis are required to get into the city. No big deal! Rooms are clean and modern. Staff we met were very friendly, not much to complain only that I don‚Äôt think as a resident you should have to pay for parking at the hotel. Takes a little bit of the luxury off.",3,2019,02,24
240,Family Visit to Dublin,"The hotel is modern and very well appointed, it is located within the Docklands area of Dublin. Although further from the city centre than I would normally like to be it is close to the Luas which gives easy access to the city centre and other transport links. Parking is a little expensive Euro 18 and there is a difference of opinion between the carpark and the hotel as how to pay. My advice is pay as you leave it is still Euro 18 per 24 hours.9",4,2019,02,21
240,Work trip ,"I stayed here for 3 nights , hotel is modern , clean , breakfast buffet is the best I‚Äôve seen , reception is prompt and friendly , nighttime food in bar is only ok , I would stay here again , room has everything you would need . ",4,2019,02,19
240,Model Hilton experience,This hotel is the ideal hotel if you are traveling to Dublin on business or vacation (and you prefer to stay conveniently adjacent to the city). The staff are consummate professionals and will never make you feel like you are a burden (priceless for business travels). They make me personally feel like family every time I go and like I am not living out of a suitcase. Anna and Ionnut have been my personal al favorites and they run a well oiled machine. ,5,2019,02,15
240,As always a good hotel to stay in,"Very consistent, high quality hotel, great location (as I work right beside it. Always enjoy staying there. Rooms are clean but the only downside is the breakfast, I just feel is ok (not bad but not wonderful). Would stay again.",4,2019,02,06
240,Service above and beyound,"I was on crutches with a broken foot.  The hotel staff went out of their way to help me.  They were all so incredibly kind.  From checking in to checking out, they were great - above and beyound. The rooms were quiet, very very nice and the restaurant was great. ",5,2019,02,05
240,Thur/Fri Night Getaway,"Have stayed in quite a few Hilton hotels and this one is pretty much the same as in first class service, handy location and friendly staff.

Handy to get to from Dublin airport just get the 747 bus (‚Ç¨7 on way) and this takes you to Heuston station, then it‚Äôs either a 2min taxi ride (didn‚Äôt use) or if you walk it about a 15min walk from hotel.

Arrived late on the Thursday evening so tried out room service with a couple of sandwiches and beer. NOTE there is a room service charge ON-TOP of your order.
These went down a treat for two famished weary people!

On top of that the room which we had a king bed was quite spacious and bed was super comfy. 
Once my head hit the pillow I was out like a light.

Breakfast in the morning is a help yourself buffet with all the usual things included (pictures attached)

After a full and hearty breakfast we then ventured into town. Took the Luas from Heuston Station again which made getting about very easy.

After our day in town back we came and decided to try the bar.

Again very attractive staff and we also sampled the burgers on offer. We had the beef burger & chicken burger separately to try them both out.
Could not fault these at all and then thought we‚Äôd try the dessert too, as we where going out that night to the 3 Arena to see Ben Howard.
I had the Baked Apple stuffed with nuts,dried fruits & demerera sugar. Served with vanilla ice-cream, and friend has the Lime & Elderflower cheesecake.
Again fantastic desserts and flawless.

Breakfast the next morning again was flawless and just the thing after a night out.

In all a great two nights just a pity we didn‚Äôt get the time to try out the leisure facilities but maybe next time.",5,2019,02,05
240,Comfortable stay in Dublin,"Check-in was quick & smooth , and as requested earlier , we got 2 rooms next to each other . Both the rooms were big & comfortable , and made our 3 nights stay in Dublin a pleasant one.
The only flaw was that our mobile phones barely got any network signal in the rooms allotted to us , and we have had to rush down to the lobby to attend important calls. This was quite a bummer.
Would gladly stay here again though.",4,2019,02,03
240,Standard Hilton,"Modern hotel, standard decoration (if left in your room, you would never guess where in the world you are). Efficient reception. Comfortable bed, good bath, a bit noisy in front rooms. Very good choice for breakfast, average quality.  Cleanliness of room and restaurant quite below average.",4,2019,02,03
240,Great location and service!,My husband and I stay for 4 days celebrating our 15th Anniversary. Hotel was in a great location! It sits between the IMMA and the Gaol. The hotel staff was helpful and friendly. We greatly enjoyed the breakfast and the rooms were clean and comfortable. We would definitely stay here again! ,5,2019,01,30
240,Overall the Kilmainham Hilton Hotel in Dublin is an excellent hotel to stay in Dublin it is centrally located and has a,It has excellent facilities and is in an excellent location it is across the road from Kilmainham gaol it has a pool and a gym and an excellent restaurant the staff are always friendly and helpful and as hotels go in Dublin the hotel rates are average ,5,2019,01,30
240,Good Hotel,We stayed 2 nights at this hotel. Room was nothing special. Breakfast was very good. Great selections of for everyone to start a day. Staff was friendly. No lounge  for elite members. Nothing special about Restaurant and lounge. Nothing special was offered to elite members. ,3,2019,01,24
240,Great hotel,"It was the nicest hotel that we stayed in during our trip to Ireland. Very clean and the food in the restaurant was very good, especially the breakfast. Breakfast in Ireland was not that good except for this place. A larger and better selection than any other place we stayed at.",5,2019,01,24
240,Am I VIP?  Feels good.,"Our trip to Dublin was made a step better because all the staff at this hotel made us feel most important. Such a great stay and the rooms were very nice, clean and quiet. Been to this location twice now. Reliable quality!",5,2019,01,24
240,Irish Mog,"Check in was prompt and welcoming. Room was very comfortable, with excellent shower. Room thermostat was a bit difficult to adjust, and slow to react. Breakfast taken was continental which had an excellent selection of cereals and fruit. Will stay again.",4,2019,01,24
240,Pleasant surprise,"Stayed in Hiltons before and generally offer good standard. This was excellent! Really well placed for tourist attractions, open top bus tour stops outside and the Kilmainham Gaol across the road and worth a visit. Staff were very helpful, great reception and rooms were spacious and well provided for. Spent New Year here and  would certainly recommend.",5,2019,01,16
240,Good Location ,Modern decor with very clean and spacious bedrooms. Staff very efficient and helpful. Only issue is paying ‚Ç¨12 for parking. Didn‚Äôt stay for breakfast at ‚Ç¨16 per head. Bar was quiet with few customers. Hotel Close to city center by either bus or taxi. ,4,2019,01,15
240,Surprised tbh,"I really wasn‚Äôt expecting much from a well known corporate branded hotel, but was pleasantly surprised. Arrived quite late to a friendly and helpful welcome. I was given a room on second floor (234) and to be fair the corridor outside is a little jaded, so I was pleasantly surprised that the room was big, modern and well equipped. Surprised tbh. Very comfortable. Highly recommended hotel. Nice stay, thank you!",4,2019,01,15
240,Outstanding Service,"We stayed for 2 nights starting December 30.
We had 2 rooms, one for our children.
I reached out to the hotel via Email prior to visit and received extremely helpful assistance from Ana Haidau.
We had great rooms and service during our stay.",5,2019,01,14
240,Great Spot for one night before traveling to Galway,"We choose this hotel after flying in from Amsterdam, we were only planning on staying one night before taking the train to Galway.   Kilmainham Goal was one place we wanted to see, so it made perfect sense to stay here, tour across the street in the morning, before our afternoon Train.

Once again, both our rooms were upgraded to Deluxe rooms, one having a large Balcony overlooking the park.

Everyone at the desk was very helpful, and the drink tickets were an added touch before heading off to dinner at the italian restaurant across the street.

Breakfast was wonderful, including the most delicious crescents of the trip.

For Touring the rest of the City it was a bit far out, but that was not our intention while staying here, as we planned to return to Dublin for a few nights at the end of our trip.",5,2019,01,10
240,Couldn't fault it,"I visited here for a long weekend as a surprise Christmas present for my boyfriend. We arrived early (noon) expecting them to tell us to come back at 3pm but instead they were able to accommodate us right away and even found a room for us overlooking the jail.

It's a great location, right opposite the jail and a short walk from the Guinness Storehouse and Dublin Zoo so we weren't short of entertainment! There were a few takeaways and pubs/restaurants nearby as well as a restaurant downstairs so there was plenty available. It was around a 15 minute drive from Temple Bar and there were always cabs available outside.

The breakfast was great - you can help yourself to a hot buffet, cold meats/cheeses, cereal, coffee and a selection of pastries. We even ordered pancakes which were cooked and bought out to us within 5 minutes. The ONE problem I had with breakfast was the price at 16 euros a person! I definitely think this should be lowered as it put us off and we only paid for it one morning.

The room was spacious and very nice. When we ran out of teas and coffees we could ring hospitality and they would bring them to us late in the evening.

The gym was great for a hotel gym (as it's paid membership as well) and there is a hot hydrotherapy pool downstairs.

We had a great stay in Dublin and really recommend the hotel. I highly recommend it!!",5,2019,01,09
240,Irish new year,"Well located on Dublin pass bus route, across from Gail and near Royal Oak bar. Breakfast buffet was absolutely outstanding. Great location for driving to 3 ‚Äúdistillery ‚Äú tours on west side of Dublin on Pass",5,2019,01,08
240,Wonderful Stay!,I recently stayed here for 4 nights over the New Year period and it was a wonderful stay from start to finish.  I had emailed the hotel and was sent a comprehensive set of instructions on how to get from the airport to the hotel and was guaranteed a room upgrade.....great start!  Ana checked us in and gave us a full run-down on the facilities at the hotel and what could be found in the local area.  The room was large and had a great balcony overlooking the park.  The bar and restaurant are modern and have a great selection of food and drinks.  We loved the hotel and would thoroughly recommend this hotel for a stay in Dublin!,5,2019,01,03
240,Perfect base to explore Dublin,"I had a short stay in the hotel with my 5yr old son over Christmas. Firstly the location was ideal, within walking distance to the Phoenix Park, Dublin Zoo, War Memorial Garden and directly across the road from Kilmainham Gaol and the Irish Museum of Modern Art. All of which are worth a visit! The hotel has a lovely pool (which is rare in Dublin) great car parking facilities (also rare in Dublin) and excellent wi-fi (10Mb/10Mb). Our room was exceptionally clean and thankfully it was very quiet at night. The bar/restaurant setting is lovely, modern and spacious. The breakfast selection was also quite good and all of the staff were very polite and helpful. Overall we had a fantastic stay, I would definitely stay here again on either a business or family trip!",5,2019,01,02
240,Perfect for Kilmainham Jail,"Kilmainham Jail is a must visit. This hotel is directly opposite the jail, 30 seconds walk to the front door. You cannot get much closer unless cells were being rented by the jail, but I would not recommend the rooms.

If I come back to Dublin I will use this hotel again. Having stayed in the centre of Dublin previously the rooms are certainly bigger than you typically find there and this is a nice, fresh and modern hotel.

It is not central. About 15 minutes walk from Heuston station but well served by buses. I did get a Mytaxi from St Stephen Sq and the fare was just under 12 euro.

They have a good buffet breakfast and a nice bar area serving food. I used the gym and hydrotherapy pools and steam room/sauna. It is a seperate Living Well fitness brand run gym. The gym was well equipped. The hydrotherapy pool had 3 or 4 of the water jets broken. You'll need to take or buy (2.50 euro) a stretchy cloth swimming cap to use the pool.

I big downer, the rooms have few power sockets and don't expect to find a USB port. Only complaint to be honest.",5,2018,12,31
240,"Excellent hotel, off the beaten trail.","We've now stayed twice on our trip around Ireland, including other properties in Dublin. After beginning our trip here, we chose to end it here as well. Staff is friendly, attentive, and helpful. The on-premise food options are also very good here. This is the closest hotel to Kilmainham Gaol, which was among our must-do items while here. If you didn't pre-plan tickets, you can simply walk across the street from the hotel and get on their list of available tickets for that day. 

Someone had criticized the rooms in a prior review, though we found them to be very clean, very current and everything in working order (surprising that other higher ranked hotels aren't as well maintained). Also, this hotel is not in the cultural center of the city but on the outskirts, meaning that dining options and transit options in the neighborhood are more limited. It's a walk to the nearest transit lines, a couple of bus routes pass the hotel, and the Hop-On-Hop-Off Tours include this on their routes every 20 minutes or so. Taxis are plentiful.

All said, it's comfortable, very current, good food options, and great amenities. We've enjoyed now our second stay at the property and recommend it.",5,2018,12,27
240,Best location if you are visiting the Kilmainham Gaol,This hotel is just across the street from the Kilmainham Gaol. When tour tickets are sold out you can go standby. We were able to easily get in for the first tour of the day by just walking across the street.,5,2018,12,24
240,Working Stay,Hotel is definitely Hilton standard! Staff are true professionals and extremely helpful and courteous. From the minute I picked up the phone to Fiona to book i was at ease and everything was taken care of. The rooms are very well appointed and spacious. I was attending a course there the following day and the business centre is also top class. Food in the bar is well above my experience of hotel bar food it really is top class. My only issue is the breakfast buffet it was my second time having it and its a bit disappointing. The cooked meats don't seem fresh and become soggy under the cloches. Other than that top class and will definitely be back.,4,2018,12,21
240,Gym,"I‚Äôm a long term member of the leisure center and have been 100% impressed by the high standards by all the staff and it‚Äôs ongoing it has very high standards of cleanliness and the staff are always friendly and helpful and very professional well done to Sveta, Emma, Lilian cristian and Paul.",5,2018,12,19
240,Wow. A Must Stay Hilton,"I am a diamond member of Hilton Honours and get to stay in many Hilton properties around the globe. This one ranks way up there with the best that I have visited. Upon check-in, I was immediately recognised as a member and was upgraded to a beautiful balcony room on the fifth floor that also matched my account profile needs for a roll-in shower. Perfect. Anna at the front desk was polite and super efficient, always with a smile. I then met Padraig, the F&B manager who could not have done more for me, even allowing for me to order food to my room that wasn't even on the menu. No fuss, no hassle, just done. Super chap, as are all the servers and bar staff. They are attentive and even when busy make time to make sure that you are being looked after. Dani, my number one barman is a joy to meet and always has a welcome. Breakfast can be busy but I let the groups go first and then enjoy the service and food quality which is always consistently excellent. Checkout is a breeze with my awaiting taxi always on time. Not sure how they do it but the teams in every department excel in their duties. Can't wait to go back. When in Dublin, don't stay anywhere else if you like old fashioned good customer service. A gem.",5,2018,12,18
240,Too far out of city,"We stayed here as part of a tour group so we had the expected standard room. These rooms are large and kept very clean by wonderful housekeeping staff. However, they are very dated and tired.
Breakfast buffet was very good, no long ques and helpful staff.
We wouldn‚Äôt stay here again as found it to be too far out of the city and we spent lots of $$ on taxis",3,2018,12,18
240,Quick Business Visit.,"Recently stayed here for just one night.
Found car park very useful.
Room was very clean and though close to traffic was well insulated and pretty much noise free.
The reception and bar area are more functional rather than attractive but work fine. Would stay here again.",4,2018,12,12
240,LivingWell Health Club,"I use the LivingWell gym regularly. The facilities are great - all kinds of equipment to cater for any kind of workout and the changing rooms and showers are immaculate. The staff are a lovely, welcoming, friendly bunch and are really passionate about what they do. Events are organised regularly and this really adds to the feeling of community and makes it more than just a gym! Well done to Emma, Cris, Paul, Svetlana and Lillian for providing a great service",5,2018,12,11
240,great hotel experience,The accommodations were excellent and the staff extremely helpful.  We needed 2 converters because we had purchased the wrong ones.  The staff graciously provided them for the duration of our stay.  They helped with directions and suggestions on transportation.  The bus only takes exact change and the desk was quick to help us.  ,5,2018,12,04
240,Overnight ,"This hotel situated on the old rowntree factory site has great access to the city and also has a national attraction across the road.  
Parking & WiFi excellent along with well facilitated rooms.  
Check in is excellent and attentive along with good food and service in the bar area. 

Well worth a stay. ",4,2018,12,04
240,"Expensive, average service","Expensive room for what you get, location is great but service in the restauarant unforunately needs to be improved, food is great, especially veggie breakfast , few reastaurants near by and buss stop is 3 minutes away.",2,2018,12,04
240,LivingWell Health Club,"Cant speak for the rooms but can speak for the Gym staff and facilities. The staff go that extra mile to give you a real personal and welcoming experience. They take the time to remember your name and always at hand to offer advice and tips. 
Recently did a personal training program with Christian, a program very specific to me working towards my goals and he's always on hand to offer encouragement, little insights and tips. 
Would highly recommend.",5,2018,11,28
240,"Away from the hustle and bustle, but still close enough to enjoy it","Another Hilton Property, another great experience.  From check in, to room service, to breakfast, this property didnt disappoint. The fitness center is one of the best I have seen at any hotel property, and the pool/spa area is very nice.  The hotel is a little off the beaten path, but all areas of Dublin are within walking distance. We did the big tourist things like Guiness, Jamison, Book of Kells, and walked everywhere with a 1 year old no issue.",5,2018,11,26
240,Amenities were missing/poor,"We booked 3 rooms for ourselves and our 4 adult children over the Thanksgiving weekend. Our comments relate solely to our room.
Our disappointments were:
- no anti-slip rubber bathmat was provided for the bathtub/shower
- no bathrobes were provided in our bedroom making a visit to the spa two floor below inconvenient
- On Sunday morning, we removed the ""Do Not Disturb"" hanging door sign from our door at about 11:30am. When we returned at about 4:00pm in the afternoon, our room had not been cleaned
- On Saturday evening, several TV stations including CNN were not available
We acknowledge that with the exception of the TV station availability we did not contact the front desk to complain but we felt that the basic services should have been available without having to make special requests.",3,2018,11,26
240,Very good GM,Visited in September. There was an issue at the restaurant that was resolved by the GM. She was also kind enough to send me some personal items I had left in the room. The gym in the hotel was not open which was a bit of a disappointment. Rooms are fine. ,4,2018,11,21
240,Lovely stay,"We have just returned from a mini break and stayed at the hotel. It was a lovely hotel, the reception staff were friendly, helpful and informative. The lady on Sunday morning even managed to check us in early even though we wasn't expecting that. The room was spotless and had everything we needed. 

The only fault I had with the hotel was the amount of fruit flies at breakfast. They seemed to be around the tables, rather than the food.

Would use this hotel again if visiting Dublin.",4,2018,11,20
240,Mr & Mrs Masterson,"Stopped in to watch the rugby and have some grub with my beautiful girlfriend. The food was fantastic, are server Sabina was excellent and Ireland beat the all blacks. 5 star rating for 5 star service.",5,2018,11,17
240,nice quiet hotel,"the hotel is outside the city center which was perfect for us. kilmainham goal is directly across from the hotel. only takes 10 mins to get into the city by taxi. 
the food is good and a good selection of options. 
staff are friendly and check in and out was simple as making rice crispy cakes",5,2018,11,15
240,Faultless stay will be back! ,We got an upgrade which was much welcomed - our room was spotless with a very large comfortable bed - we also had a balcony with nice views of Dublin. We enjoyed excellent service in the bar on our first night with very good food too. Menu varied and not too expensive. Taxis regularly available from outside as its a bit of a walk from town. An excellent stay with the Hilton. ,5,2018,11,14
240,"Great stay, clean rooms and attentive staff","Had a great 3 night stay in mid-October.  Room was good size, modern and very clean.  I just read a review someone else recently posted about their room being old and dated...that was definitely not the case with the room I stayed in.  Quite the opposite.  

My only complaint is the location.  It isn't really walkable to very much and to get to downtown, touristy area, public transit wasn't really an option.  The Houston train station is about a 20 minute walk.  I wound up using MyTaxi quite a bit (their equivalent of Uber).  Immediate area around the hotel is safe, but a block or 2 over is definitely not an area to wander around in after dark.  

Hotel restaurant and bar was good.",5,2018,11,13
240,Great stay !!!!,"Just returned from a two night stay at the Hilton Kilmainham and loved every minute of it. From the early check in, staff couldn't have been any more helpful. We got a room overlooking the jail at the corner of the hotel and we were  expecting some noise but none of the sort!!! Beds were so comfortable and the room was spotless.Tried the food in the bar was also excellent and very reasonably priced. Totally recommend a stay.",5,2018,11,10
240,"Old school Hilton, not great","Visited one night while passing through on a work trip. Front desk staff were friendly but as is the case in much of Europe, they don‚Äôt care if you are Diamond Status or an Expedia customer - no special treatment.

On the positive, the bar is not a bad place to have a night cap, friendly staff and good options. Generally the property is nice outside the guest rooms and you are steps from the super efficient and amazing public trolley that will get you in any direction around town fast.

On the other hand, the hotel rooms are super dated. Super worn down and tired. My room was basic yet comfortable and quiet but it seems like I was not in Hilton because the fixtures were so off. The bathroom and shower were really basic, super low water pressure. The carpets were dirty and had not been cleaned in a long time. 

So all in all, if your desperate and in Dublin for a night, this works. But not for a longer business trip.",3,2018,11,05
240,family hotel,"We choose this because it was a hilton, and also have stayed here in the past.  It was great with having 2 rooms, with the second half off for the children.  We were very comfortable, and the car park underneath the hotel made it easy.  The rooms are very nice and I believe have been upgraded since our last visit.  It is very well located next to the old jail, and on the hop on and hop off bus tour.  Not good location if you want to go to temple bar, but we walked to guiness and it was a nice 15-20 min walk.  You will be limited on your stay because you are not downtown, but if you want to visit dublin and take the hop on bus to see the sights and then have a good rest then this is the place.  However, if you want to be able to walk to downtown at night, then I suggest a different hotel since it is an expensive cab ride back.",5,2018,11,03
240,Lovely anniversary surprise,"We stayed in Hilton kilmainham for our anniversary. We were pleasantly surprised with tasty selection of chocolate and hand written card from the stuff, wishing us a happy anniversary. It was  nice and very special touch. The hotel was great over all. The food in the lobby was quickly and tasty served and prepared, as well as drinks. Would definitely stay again. The area is great and Phoenix park just around the corner.",5,2018,11,02
240,Perfect Location,I spent three nights in Dublin at this hotel and LOVED it!  The staff was especially nice and helpful.  Making taxi and food arrangements for us as we were doing crack of dawn tours.  The restaurant has great food and again really great service.  On our last night Sabina was our server and she went above and beyond.  I will definitely stay here again on my next visit.,5,2018,11,01
240,The best gym,"In first of all I want to thank you to Christian from the gym the best coach,he showed me a lot of things to do in future to keep my body fit.Thank you to all from the gym every day smiling and helpful. 
The best of the best keep it up üëç",5,2018,11,01
240,Fab hotel,"Came to Dublin on a two night break as a 50th birthday gift. Got 747 bus from airport ‚Ç¨7 each and about 30 mins and a 15 min walk. Checkin was seamless and the receptionist was just wonderful.  Such a pleasant cheerful lady. Room was ready early. Lovely room with huge comfortable bed. Kilmainham Gaol just across the road. We did a tour which was well worth it. On returning to our room I was so suprised to find a scrumptious plate of delicious cakes with a message of ""happy birthday 50th"" in icing on the plate.  A perfect touch! Hotel pool was 'cooler' than expected but the sauna was lovely. Breakfast was amazing on both days.  So much choice and if that's not enough you can order freshly made omelettes and pancakes. Staff as so friendly and are a credit to the hotel.  Prefect place to stay if exploring Dublin. Would highly recommend and look forward to staying at another Hilton in another City. Thank you for making my trip to Dublin a special memory. ",5,2018,10,31
240,Dublin Marathon Stay,"3rd year in a row travelling to Dublin to run the Marathon and 3rd stay in this Hilton. Must say that I, and my family, really like this hotel. 
All the staff are extremely helpful and friendly, the rooms are spacious and clean  ( again the ability to select your room beforehand in the app is excellent), my son loves the swimming pool, and food at breakfast (spoilt for choice) and in the bar/ restaurant were all delicious. 
I‚Äôve already booked my 2019 stay for Dublin Marathon 2019. 
",4,2018,10,30
240,"Avoid if possible , would not recommend or return.",We booked into the hotel for one night. First impressions were good at reception with the staff members. We then proceeded to the room which was freezing cold the heating is very slow/old. Still this wasn‚Äôt a big issue then we went down to the bar/restaurant which was full with more staff than customers. After 10 minutes of sitting down and nobody coming over with menus or to order our drinks I went looking to get them myself. One girl staff member in the bar then stopped me on my way to my seat and said she needed these menus for another table and would get me 2 new ones ‚Äúin a minute ‚Äú. One manager in the bar was standing around laughing and joking with another staff member about going for drinks after work in the patriot pub while we were still left sitting there. We were then overcharged for our food which was just another bump to our stay. There is nothing near the hotel except the kilmainham gaol so not worth staying unless you really have to. And finally the ‚Äúleisure facilities‚Äù. The pool is tiny compared to the photos advertised and the staff were rude at the leisure centre. I was whistled at by one on reception to tell me the jacuzzi was out of order. Changing rooms filthy and freezing cold no heating on even though it‚Äôs almost November. Plenty of better cheaper hotels with things to do. Don‚Äôt let the Hilton name fool you. Would not recommend and definitely will not be returning.,2,2018,10,29
240,Short stay,"Me and my wife stayed on the way back from our honeymoon. The night before she had sent an email explaining that this would be our last night before we went home and if there was anything special that could be done for us it would be greatly appreciated. When we checked in the they had kindly given us a room with a great view and when we got to the room we found a box of chocolates with a lovely note.
All the staff couldn't do enough for us, a very nice stay.",5,2018,10,18
240,A solid stay,"Had to rotate around Dublin due to the need for ""family rooms"" and so we got to experience 3 different hilton properties during our visit.  This ranks 2nd on our list of the 3.  The property is a small walk from the luas but in a very nice location overlooking Kilmainham.  Upon arrival we received vouchers for free drinks but only sparkling water in our room (the other HI properties didn't give us vouchers, but did give us both sparkling and still water).  The lounge was good, as was service.  The beds were firm but there are no outlets near the beds.  The water temperature in the shower fluctuated between hot and cold quite often.  We were allowed an early check in and a late check out which was wonderful!  The front desk might need to communicate with the maid staff as we were awoken early to service the room when we were supposed to have a late check out.  Breakfast was delish with plenty of choices!",4,2018,10,17
240,Absolutely horrible!!!!,"There is more they get wrong than right.  Customer service is atrocious.  The bed in our room feels like you‚Äôre lying on a concrete floor.  I actually checked to see if there was a piece of wood under the sheets because it feels so hard and has no give.  They advertise panoramic views but don‚Äôt mention the windows aren‚Äôt soundproofed AT ALL so on the fourth floor we hear every siren from the nearby Garda station, every ambulance, every honked horn, even pedestrians yelling at each other on the street.  Room service calls go unanswered for multiple calls and then when someone answers they‚Äôll say meal service for breakfast is over (but had they answered my first five calls it wouldn‚Äôt be closed). The hotel information is also very misleading if not completely fraudulent ‚Äî when we booked our prepaid non refundable stay, their gym and pool were under construction but meant to be completed a week before our visit.  When we got here there were signs that they were closed for construction for another week.  We saw NO construction happening at all. I think they just keep changing the dates to mislead people.  This is truly one of the worst hotels I‚Äôve ever had to mispleasure at which to stay.   It‚Äôs definitely the noisiest and hands down the MOST UNCOMFORTABLE bed I‚Äôve ever encountered ever in my life.  I wake up with pains I didn‚Äôt have the night before.  Stay somewhere else in Dublin ‚Äî this is far from the city center as well.  Something else misleading in their advertising of this property online.",1,2018,10,17
240,Gorgeous hotel,"Beautiful hotel with really lovely bedrooms. Excellent beds and large bathroom with both shower and bath - loved the Crabtree & Evelyn toiletries. Very pleasant desk staff. We had dinner in Broyage - food was tasty, good portions, and the waiters especially Carl were charming. Perhaps a little disorganised at times - took a while to get enough cutlery!- but we enjoyed our night immensely. A pity the gym was closed but the hotel is near the Park so handy for a run. Nice fresh breakfast - good coffee and the toaster was the best I've come across in a hotel. Not super-cheap at ‚Ç¨209 for a night without breakfast but really a very very good hotel.",5,2018,10,14
240,Nice hotel ,"We stayed here for 1 night before we flew home to the US.  we had 5 people and 3 rooms so this hotel was a good overall savings vs the Hilton near the airport.  Staff attentive and pleasant.  Accommodations were nice and very clean.  Beds very comfortable and the shower good.  We had a free breakfast in the morning because we were traveling with a Hilton Diamond member.  Breakfast OUTSTANDING and just what we needed after a long day of driving travel the night before and a big day of plane travel ahead of us back to the US.  The hotel staff arranged our taxi for 5 back to the airport (I wish I could remember how many ‚Ç¨ that was, but I don‚Äôt).  I would definitely stay here again as it was walking distance to some points of interest and pubs, although we didn‚Äôt have time to do that.

",5,2018,10,08
240,Great place to stay in Dublin,"I stayed there for a night and it was a pretty nice experience. The hotel is well located, a bit outside of the city center but from walking distance to a few main attractions (Guinness Brewery for instance). Their continental breakfast is also pretty good.",5,2018,10,07
240,Very nice accommodations.,"Not in the center of town, but a good area.  The restaurant food was very tasty!  Good option of Irish Whiskey on the menu along with many other spirits.  Beds were comfortable and the staff was very friendly and helpful.",4,2018,10,07
240,Good place to stay,"If you are Dublin, on work or leisure and don't want to stay at the bustling heart of the city( say, near O'Connell Street), Hilton , Kilmainham is a good place to stay. It is right opposite the Old Goal( which is now a museum), relatively quiet place.Rooms are good with modern amenities. Restaurant is good and so is the Coffee Shop & Bar. There is an old pub( Patriot's Pub) which is worth a visit.There are enough places of historical interest within walking distance. It is on bus route and cabs are available all the time.",4,2018,10,07
240,Top notch hotel,"The room was wonderful with a few out to the Wicklow mountains and overlooking the Kilmainham Gaol (which is a fabulous tour, by the way).
The handicapped room was accessible and exactly as requested.
The staff was very helpful - in particular, Anna on the front desk, who helped me in MANY ways including putting an app on my phone so that I could easily get a cab when out and about (My Taxi).  She was very caring and certainly represents Hilton well.
The hotel is right at a Hop on Hop Off bus stop.
It is not in the heart of town but just a few minutes away.",5,2018,10,06
240,Meeting Friends,"My 4 friends and I decided to go to this hotel as it was built on the grounds of the Rowntree Mackintosh factory in Inchicore where we had all worked in the late 60‚Äôs.
 
I arrived at 3pm but my friends were late arriving as there was a protest in O‚ÄôConnell street and all the buses coming to Kilmainham were delayed . 

I had never been to this hotel before so I sat with my complimentary paper in the reception area. Just watching and taking note of the comings and goings of the numerous people checking in. There were many different nationalities but the group were mainly arriving by coaches.

Wow what a busy hotel. People were checking in and getting information on tours around Dublin. Very efficient staff and pleasant.

My friends arrived and we moved in to the bar. Drinks were quite reasonable prices, pints were ‚Ç¨5.50 and my usual a glass of wine was ‚Ç¨6.90.

There were a few momentum‚Äôs of Rowntree Mackintosh products.  Some such items were pictures of Smartie boxes and Fruit Pastilles hanging on the wall in the bar. 

Later on in the evening we ordered food which was excellent.

Definitely would recommend this hotel with such close proximity to Kilmainham Jail and The Guinness brewery just down the road. Plenty of taxies available. ",5,2018,10,02
240,Fantastic spot with a lot to visit locally and good connections to town,"Visited here with some relatives over from america, it was a great location to visit some of their must see locations for their visit to Dublin.

Kilmainham gaol is just across the road, and the modern art museum just a little further.  And then only 15 minute walk to the Guinness storehouse all the spots they wanted to visit were so close.

We also traveled to and from the city center by bus ( about 10 minutes), there are a number of lines which pass within a block so it is really easy get to temple bar etc.

The hotel itself was great, indoor parking ( at a reasonable fee) & very easy to get to from the M50.  The bar is good with a reasonable selection of beers and friendly staff.  Breakfast was great with proper espresso machines and a great selection of both hot and cold food.  

Our room was very nice, larger than most, with a balcony with great views over that part of the city, it was a clear day so you could see all the way to the Dublin hills.

All in all a great spot to visit dublin.",5,2018,10,01
240,Nice overnight stay,"Stayed at Hilton Dublin overnight, room was spacious and clean.  Breakfast was good and choice were great.  Nice, polite, attentive staff.  May I suggest to have a weighing scale at the front desk, it will be of great help to us travellers as we pack our things going back home.  Overall, it was a very pleasant stay in your hotel.  We will definitely come back when in Dublin.",4,2018,09,29
240,Good option for Dublin,"We stayed at this Hilton twice and although were pleased with it, the type of  room certainly makes a difference.

On our first stay, we were only going to be at the hotel for one night before embarking on a 4 day tour of Northern Ireland. Therefore, we booked a standard King room. And we received what we booked, a very ""standard"" king overlooking an apartment complex and daycare play area (Room 311). Basic in every sense. In fairness to the Hilton, we did arrive VERY early in the morning after an overnight flight from the States and they checked us in to our room at 11am. Super kudos for that! Furthermore, there was an adorable springer spaniel that lived in the apartment directly across from our view, so we enjoyed watching his (or her) antics in the window.

Our second stay was 5 days later for two nights, booked a Deluxe king with a balcony. Stephanie checked us in and we were delighted with Room 406 overlooking the grounds of the Royal Kilmainham Hospital. There was very little street noise and the room (and bathroom) was more spacious than the previous stay.

Granted, Kilmainham is not in the city center of Dublin, but we were quite happy with the location. Tour the Gaol and visit the Art Museum at the old Royal Hospital (especially the lovely gardens.) Also, would recommend Patriots Inn for a quick pub lunch and Union 8 down the street for a great dinner.",4,2018,09,29
240,We expect more from a Hilton,"Staff was exceptional. Room was fine except for a very dirt bench at the foot of the bed, which was also a trip hazard. Room also lacked electrical outlets and, more importantly, USB charging ports. Easy things to fix. ",3,2018,09,29
240,Nice food,"I've been to the Hilton a few times now and on each occasion the staff and facilities have been excellent. 

The staff are always friendly and willing to have a bit of craic. The food is absolutely lovely with a really good range. There's something for everyone. ",4,2018,09,26
240,Good Room,Room was roomy with a nice size bed.  Bed were firmer than I like so sleep was difficult.  All other aspects were as expected. Typical high tub with shower which makes it difficult for older people to get in and out of.,4,2018,09,25
240,Family experience to visit our ancesters home country.,"We truly enjoyed our visit to Ireland!  The hotel, the people, the vibrant city of Dublin and the country were wonderful!  So many lovely sights, charming villages and towns and incredible history!  We could feel the connection to this land where our great grandparents were born.",5,2018,09,24
240,Great location to Kilmainham Gaol,Location was great for touring art museum and Gaol but not many restaurants nearby. The Italian place across the street looked good and was recommended by staff but it didn‚Äôt take credit cards. Cash only? Hotel restaurant was okay. Service was pretty good and food was good. Nothing outstanding but typical. ,5,2018,09,24
240,Great Choice for visiting attractions in Kilmainham area,"This hotel is perfect choice if you are planning to visit Kilmainham Gaol or Museum of Modern Art; both are literally across the street.  If you're not intimated by a little walking, there are good food options within walking distance; some, very close.  The Heuston train station is also not far - walkable on a nice day.  As for the hotel, it's very nice and will provide the quality you'd expect of a good Hilton hotel.  If you're not interested in being in the middle of the Dublin downtown hustle and bustle, this is also a good option to consider.",4,2018,09,22
240,"Great Hotel, Great Location","During a recent vacation we had occasion to spend two nights at the Hilton Dublin Kilmainham. The hotel is very clean, centrally located and staffed with professionals who know exactly what they are doing. We highly recommend this facility to anyone travelling to Dublinm",5,2018,09,22
240,"Good Food, Good Service","Stopped in for breakfast.  Food was good as well as the service and dinning room is attractive.  My only complaint was the watered down OJ.  Breakfast is a buffet, serve yourself and ran between $12.00 and $18.00.",3,2018,09,21
240,I wish we‚Äôd never have to leave. ,"Arrived at the hotel at 10am Monday morning. We were expecting to have to store our luggage until the afternoon since our arrival was so early. But a wonderful young woman named Ana was working when we arrived. She made a couple of phone calls & got us into a room!! We were overjoyed. After dropping off our luggage in our room we wanted to see as much of Dublin as we could. She made some great suggestions so we took her advice.  Our housekeeper has been outstanding! She did a superior job cleaning our room daily. The bathroom towels are huge, soft & thirsty. The toiletries are from Evelyn  &. Crabtree which I absolutely adored. I thought they were wonderful.  The bed had perfect firmness & was super comfortable The big breakfast was delicious which is pretty normal in Europe. So between the wonderful upbeat staff members, clean rooms & decent food I. A great location, I will definitely stay her again. ",5,2018,09,20
240,Very recommended hotel,"It was easy to find the hotel. From the nearest tram station on Davitt Road, it took me 15-20 mins walking. I love the waiting lounge on the receptionist area, they provide computer that can be used freely by guests. The room was also decent with well-worked bathroom. Also the restaurant had nice menus and the staffs were very helpful on serving. One day, we needed to depart early from hotel and they provided us with to-go breakfast: tasty pastries and fruits. Amazing service, really.",5,2018,09,20
240,Excellent stay in Dublin!,"Nice quiet location. Clean friendly hotel. Comfortable bed, clean room and bathroom. Excellent experience. Easy to get a taxi. On the route of the ""hop-on/hop-off"" tour bus and across from the Kilmainham Gaol. Would definitely recommend and return here!",5,2018,09,18
240,"Great hotel, lovely staff","Great service, great food, our waitress Sabina was the best, very helpful and friendly,always with a smile on her face, recommended us where to go and what to see on our Dublin quest üòÅ. We will definitely come back!",5,2018,09,18
240,Very Good Dublin Hotel,"We stayed two nights at this Hilton with a tour group and were very satisfied with the room.  Location and restaurant staff left some to be desired.  

The hotel room is large clean and comfortable.  Extra towels in the room, a couple bottles of water and a fridge were appreciated.  Air con, TV and wifi were excellent.  Check in was with a tour group and many of the keys did not work on the first try, needed to run down and get new ones which was a pain considering it was busy.  Location is about three kilometres from downtown sites, it's a long walk but taxis and buses are an option of course.  Bath had lots of water pressure and hot water was good.  Bedding was excellent.  It was quite quiet each night so sleep quality was good.

We enjoyed two very good buffet breakfasts.  Lounge and patio service was very poor on three different occasions.  No use waiting outside for service as there was one server for the whole patio.  After 15 mins I went inside and service was just as poor.  Quite disappointing really considering the rest of the property was very good.",4,2018,09,17
240,Wonderful stay,This property was a great addition to our vacation and we will return. Rooms were clean and the staff was helpful. This will be a property I will recommend to all my friends and business travelers. Breakfast was a highlight every morning.,5,2018,09,17
240,Visit to Ireland,"Our first night in Ireland staying in town. Sabina was terrific, great service, friendly, and recommendations about where to go and what to see. 

Good location with easy access to public transportation and local sites of interest.",5,2018,09,14
240,Very nice! Best coffee there!,"Very clean. VERY GOOD people, helpful and polite. Breakfast - yummyyyyyy, they have best coffee of all hotels I have been - and you can take it away after breakfast. Nice location to visit Dublin (nice walk to center of city).",5,2018,09,11
240,Hilton Dublin Kilmainham - not the best Hilton,The early check in experience was disappointing. Did not feel welcomed at this Hilton location. The staff members were not knowledgeable about the surroundings. Also the hotel location is a bit far from the city center.,2,2018,09,09
240,Distance,"Very nice hotel as you expect from a Hilton. Nice clean room, friendly staff. Only problem, the distance to the city center is minimum 30 minutes walking. That‚Äôs a bit too far. But, breakfast is superb! Self service, fresh and real orange juice. ",4,2018,09,08
240,A truly relaxing short break.,"The Hilton Kilmainham is just a short walk away from Heuston station where the 747 bus will drop you off from Dublin Airport ( 7euro one way or 12 return). On reaching the hotel we were greeted by smiley, cheerful staff who quickly and efficiently explained all we needed to know and gave us the key to our fourth floor room.

The room was beautiful, large and airy. It overlooked Kilmainham Goal and had a beautiful view over part of the city. There were the usual tea and coffee making facilities and free bottles of water. The king size bed was massive! However, the best thing was that not only was there a separate shower stall, there was also a hand held shower head over the bath, choices, choices!!

Breakfast in the restaurant was a choice of hot full Irish or continental. Both are well worth the ‚Ç¨15 cost. Fresh, delicious and plentiful,  my diet went straight out of the window. The restaurant staff were really nice and friendly, made you feel really welcome.

A final perk? The tour buses stop at the bus stop just across the road from the hotel.

Would we stay there again? Without a doubt. Would we recommend the hotel to others? Every time! If we could give it more than five stars we would.",5,2018,09,07
240,Terrific Hilton,After a lengthy taxi-ride from the Dublin Airport (the hotel was cordoned off because the Pope was across the street in the park) we finally arrived after only a 3 minute walk (thanks to our born and raised Dublin taxi driver who knew all the back ways).  We were very warmly greeted by reception and our luggage was held by them as it was before check-in.  Our rooms were very large as was the bathroom and everything was immaculately clean and the king beds were really comfortable.  Although the hotel is not close to the center of Dublin our goal was to be near the Heuston railway station which is right down the hill from the hotel as we were going to Cork and the Blarney Stone the next day so it was perfect for us.  We did manage to negotiate the bus system when we finally got downtown and the stop was right around the corner from the hotel.  There is a bar in the hotel that was pretty busy but very efficient.  We would return to the Hilton if we come back to Dublin again (for a 3rd visit!).,5,2018,09,06
240,Great stay with Hilton,"Vivian in the Restaurant was fabulous every morning we had breakfast and Velia was super helpful and friendly at checkin. Breakfast buffet was very good. Just wish they had waffles, but they do make pancakes and crepes to order. The only down side was the restaurant. We arrived late and chose to eat in the restaurant and this is where Hilton fell short. The waiter was not very friendly and did not move with any purpose, he just seemed to take his time with everything and just shuffled around. No energy and not very friendly. I even asked him if it was a very busy night and he told me ""not really"". It is a bit from center of town but there is transport. For walking it is about an hour away. The Prison Kilmainham is right across the street. Make sure you make online reservations before you arrive though.",4,2018,09,06
240,Trusted Hilton Name,"Chose to stay here for my first time out of the US because of the Hilton name.  The location itself is a little outside of the City Center, which can be good and bad.  We were right across the street from the Killingham Gaol, which was incredible.  There is also a hop on-hop off bus location right there.  In terms of being within walking distance from anything, you really aren‚Äôt.  So that is the pay off with the brand name.  But we liked it enough that we spent two nights there at the beginning of our trip and decided to spend our very last night there as well.  The hotel itself is nice.  Rooms are nice.  Air conditioned, which yes is a big deal in Ireland!  The pool area was very pretty.  But if you intend to get in the pool itself, you need a swimming cap for your hair - male or female.  They do allow you in the hot tub without a cap.  They also have parking beneath the hotel.  It is very tight in their garage and it helps to get an understanding of how to get out from the hotel staff so that you do it correctly with paying, etc.  We also would recommend the daily breakfast buffet.  I didn‚Äôt know if we would use it, so I didn‚Äôt purchase that type of package, but it was the best one of our trip.",5,2018,09,03
240,B.J. From London,"Thoroughly enjoyed my meal in the hotels restaurant! Top class attention to detail and really friendly service! A shout out to Laura, on the waiting staff, whom looked after me! A credit to herself and her team! Really looking forward to staying again!",5,2018,08,31
240,The place to stay in Dublin.,We had a marvelous stay at the Hilton Kilmainham. It is right across the street from the jail which is one of the top attractions in Dublin and a Hop on Hop off bus stop. Not far from Guinness and their main park (where the Pope did a Mass). We only had 4 days but the hotel helped us work around that by booking trips and getting taxis. Every employee went out of their way to help. They even packed us breakfast e abuse we left for our trips before the official breakfast. The first time a hotel has ever offered that. It was so helpful. The restaurant and breakfast were wonderful. Awesome food. Breakfast is included. Please give them a try. You won‚Äôt be disappointed. Can‚Äôt find the names of the front desk people but everyone was wonderful.,5,2018,08,28
240,Delicious!,We had the cod-stuffed salmon over potatoes. Tasty and beautifully presented. Service by Sabina was first-rate even though the restaurant was ‚Äúslammed‚Äù by customers who had come to the city to see the Pope. We recommend highly this restaurant. ,5,2018,08,26
240,Recent stay,"We were booked in to stay at their hotel for 3 days. Unfortunately Expedia contacted us to say that the hotel pool facilities and gym were closed. This was not good for us so we switched hotels and stayed only on the first night. The room we stayed in was really lovely and finished to a high standard. The bed was extremely comfortable and the room was spotlessly clean. It's a shame that we had such late notice of the pool closure which caused us to them move hotels to somewhere where the rooms are no where near as nice. I would stay on the hotel again. The reception staff were very welcoming. The restaurant staff in the evening were variable in their efficiency, but they were friendly and the breakfast staff were very attentive.",4,2018,08,22
240,Loved it ,"We was positively surprised from the room.
The view was beautiful and the room clean and very high standard. We loved it. When we come back to Dublin we will be staying here again.
Its definitely a good choice. ",5,2018,08,19
240,Great Hotel Experience in Dublin,"The staff at the Hilton Dublin Kilmainham really made my stay.  I had booked early and paid in advance to get a discount.  I then subsequently realized that I needed to book two nights and had only booked one.  So I made a reservation for the second night separately.  When I got to the hotel I explained this to Velia.  She told me it would be no problem, but then noticed that I had been upgraded for the first night.  The same level room was not available the second night, so she offered me a Junior Suite for the second night, but I would have to change rooms.  I told her I really didn't want to change rooms, so just go ahead and give me the room I had reserved.  It was too early and the room wasn't ready.  I told her that was no problem since I needed to go to Trinity College to pick up my packet for the race I was in the next day.  She gave me directions to get there on the bus and made sure I had exact change for the bus, both ways.  I thought she was great then.  However, when I got back to the hotel she told me that I had the upgraded room for both nights.  She said she and Shawna, her colleague had worked some magic.

The room was beautiful, with a balcony over looking the Kilmainham Gaol and a great view of the back gate of the Royal Kilmainham Hospital, which was where my race started and ended.  It was perfect.  This hotel is also walking distance to the Guiness Storehouse and Jameson.  Really Dublin is a very easy city to walk around, even the day after a Half Marathon.

We also ate in the restaurant several times.  The food was great and the service was exceptional.  We especially appreciated the cheerful wit of Sabina.  This was the perfect hotel for our stay in Dublin.  We will stay here again if we come back.",5,2018,08,19
240,Two night stay,"Stayed for 2 nights last week. Was pretty much what i would expect from the Hilton chain. It is in a fairly quiet area of the city, opposite the kilmainham goal, and approx 20 mins walk into the Temple bar area.There is a bar and restaurant opposite which is ideal after a long day out . I thought the breakfast was very good but the staff could have taken our plates away rather quicker, the cereal bowl and toast plate were still on the table whilst we sampled the cooked option . I know that seems petty but the table looked a complete mess , as did others around us .Just a little attention to detail that could easily be remedied .The hotel will keep your bags after checkout which is useful.Overall it was a pleasant hotel base for a busy weekend but thought we might have had a price reduction as the pool and gym was out of use .",4,2018,08,19
240,Lovely Stay,"Stayed here for one night after attending a wedding near by. Lovely hotel, spotlessly clean and very comfortable. Rooms had all amenities you would expect and also had air conditioning which was quiet and affective. No noise from hallway.
All staff we came into contact with were very pleasant.
We had brunch in adjoining restaurant after we checked out which was lovely, excellent quality and good value. 
We will certainly return and would not hesitate in recommending to friends and family.",5,2018,08,19
240,Mr Ferguson,"Kilmainham Hilton Dublin. Rooms clean and functional, restaurant is good food good and service exceptional ,especially by our waitress Sabina. Was looking forward to spa and pool but was closed due to technical fault.",3,2018,08,18
240,Great service- under par rooms,Front desk staff is amazing!! Hotel needs and update. The value is not worth the Roomate. My room smelled.  Shauna was so helpful and offering me suggestions of the local area. Location is very ideal but hotel really needs a remodel. Wasn‚Äôt up to the Hilton standards.,3,2018,08,17
240,Not impressed ,"While it‚Äôs on the outskirts of the city, I personally enjoyed the location as it was quieter than being in the center of the city.  Front desk service was good but I wasn‚Äôt thrilled with the room.  The room was a decent size but some of the pillows had a lot of hair on them.  Not sure if they were from the housekeeper, dried on from the dryer, or just that the pillowcases were just not cleaned which is gross.  The breakfast buffet was ok.  The tables in the dining area weren‚Äôt that clean. ",3,2018,08,16
240,Family stay before Airport,Very friendly and great customer service. The breakfast and dinner was excellent and Sabina was really friendly and helpful. The bedrooms were really clean and immaculate which made the stay with Hilton Kilmainham more comfortable. I will definitely be back and will recommend it to everyone.,4,2018,08,16
240,Quick Dublin stay,"One night stay in Dublin, wanted to stay fairly close to airport.  Perfect location, quick cab ride to city.  Able to walk around all day then head back to hotel for a quick bite before heading out.  The usual Hilton service and cleanliness!",5,2018,08,15
240,A fantastic staff- lovely facilities and staff!,"We stayed overnight in the hotel when in the city for a graduation ceremony. We picked the hotel because of its location to the Goal (we had an early morning visit booked). It was incredibly conveniently located for the hop on- hop off bus, which was fab and saved a lot of money traveling, as it is a bit of a distance out of the city. We arrived early in the day (around 10am) and the staff let us check in early which was fab. We ate in the restaurant and, although it was quite pricey, the food was great and the service excellent. I am really pleased we booked breakfast in the morning as this was excellent- fantastic choice and delicious food. We had a few problems with our key card deactivating, but the staff were brilliant and quick at getting this sorted. Really impressed overall. Thanks for a great stay.",5,2018,08,15
240,Great two night stay,Nice hotel off the beaten path.  Super friendly rooms with a friendly staff.  Breakfast was quite good.  We had dinner one night the Lamb Shank was excellent!  They have a nice bar .  About a fifteen minute walk from the Temple Bar district.  ,5,2018,08,14
240,Fantastic stay with extras,"Perfect location for the Rock and Roll half marathon-didn't realize the finish line was literally outside the front door. The room was spotless, and morning breakfast was great. I am a slower runner and knew that making a noon checkout would be tough, I inquired about a late checkout and was given 2:00. Our room key did not work around 12:20, and the front desk told us to stay another 3 hours if needed. We also asked to have some HOHO bus passes printed, that was no problem either. It's the little things that make a good hotel great, this one surpassed our expectation. 

The only negatives would be the restaurant seemed rather pricey. The gym/pool was closed for maintenance-I normally stretch out in a gym the night before a race, but was unable to do so here. 

We would return to the hotel during future visits.",5,2018,08,14
240,Great food and staff.,Visited the restaurant for lunch after touring Kilmainham Gaol last week and was surprised by how good the food was. We ordered salads which were excellent and the desserts were even better - would recommend the sticky toffee pudding in particular. Our waiter Lorcan was attentive and helpful and gave us great recommendations for other sites to see in the area. Would definitely go back.,5,2018,08,13
240,Great Hotel: Staff Took Excellent Care of Us!,"This is a beautiful modern hotel located well east of the main tourist area.  I had planned to stay in a more central hotel, but there were so many major events going on that this was not possible.  We arrived for a two night stay in a family room (king plus single) and were checked in by Gabriela very efficiently.  Upon going to our room, we found that it was reeking of cigarette smoke.  This is not the fault of the hotel as it is a no smoking hotel and this is posted everywhere.  This was a no go for my wife.  We called back to Gabriela and she went to work on this issue for us.  This was no small task as the hotel was full.  She ultimately got us a regular room with a rollaway bed.  This was perfectly fine with us.  She told us she would try and get us another family room when she could.  The following day we headed out to tour Dublin and failed to tell the staff we were perfectly happy in the room with the rollaway.  This was completely my fault.  When we returned around 4PM, Gabriela and staff had moved us back into a family room in a corner suite with great views.  I felt like a chump for putting them to this extra effort, but thank you so much!
As I said, this hotel is east of the main tourist area, which I liked and was very happy with, but may not suit your needs.  The hotel is across the street from the Kilmainham Gaol Museum and the Irish Museum of Modern Art.  Two excellent places to visit.  All three hop on/hop off buses stop directly across from the front doors of the hotel.  The hop on/hop off buses are a great way to get an overview of Dublin.  Super convenient for hotel guests.  I would love to come back to the Hilton Kilmainham for a longer stay!",5,2018,08,12
240,Restaurant,"I live locally came for brunch with my parents, who came to visit from Kerry.  Great service from our waitress Sabina. Who was both friendly and tentative. Food was good too.  Will be making a return visit.",5,2018,08,12
240,Excellent brunch in the city ,"Great tasty brunch close to the city. Sabina was a great host, lovely atmosphere. Nice and chilled. Would definitely recommend a trip .............town and heuston station only a short walk away .....get here eat here

",5,2018,08,12
240,Wonderful hotel,"Would not hesitate to stay here again. Fabulous stay. We stayed one night - the room was spacious and comfort with a balcony. We had room service dinner as it was late. Food was delivered quickly and was delicious. Breakfast next morning was huge, plenty of choice and everything fresh. Staff were friendly and efficient.",5,2018,08,09
240,Comfortable with good location,Across from Kilmainham Jail which was an outstanding exhibit. Staff were helpful and professional. Room was clean and bed was really comfy after a day of touring. Outdoor seating for bar/restaurant was very relaxing. Breakfast choices included an array of food for buffet and made to order options. Quiet location. Across from hop on hop off buses. Also about .5 mile from train station- easy walk. About 1.9 miles from city center. Again easy walk. Loved location as it was not crowded. Lovely hotel. ,5,2018,08,07
240,Best hotel in Dublin üçÄüçÄ,"As a frequent hotel guest, I cannot say enough great things about the Hilton Kilmainham!
The rooms are comfortable, clean and cool..... perfect for a good night‚Äôs sleep !
The staff is outstanding....... Shauna, Renata, and Ana always greet you with a big smile, always have time to answer any questions, and give amazing advice to help plan your stay. AND, the next morning, they love to hear all about your tour or sites you have visited !
Nathalie is a wonderful server in the restaurant making each meal extra special !
All in all, this hotel is the perfect place to stay while visiting this amazing city !",5,2018,08,07
240,Beautiful hotel,"We arrived and was amazing from start to finish the room was lovely, the food was excellent and staff really friendly. Location is excellent it‚Äôs right facing the goal would highly recommend for romantic getaway",5,2018,08,07
240,Great little holtel,"We loved the Kilmainham Hilton - very convenient to the Kilmainham Jail tour, several parks, etc.  Bus to downtown is close by, and the people were great!   And as Hilton Honors member, they upgraded us to a spectacular balcony room at no cost!",5,2018,08,06
240,Overnight stay,Stayed just one night here recently. The location is very good and the room was comfortable and very clean. All staff we dealt with were very friendly and helpful. We had dinner in the restaurant which was ok but nothing special.The breakfast buffet was very good with an extensive choice and a cooked to order menu.However I felt that 15euros per person for breakfast was a bit steep but perhaps that is the standard price for a hotel in Dublin. Overall it is a very good hotel and I would stay again.,4,2018,08,05
240,Close to the jail,"We stayed just the one night having attended a function at the jail - just across the road and enjoyed our visit. Room very comfortable with all facilities including the pool, sauna and restaurant at which we ate late evening. Not usual for us to stay at a hotel but on this occasion very convenient and restful.",5,2018,08,04
240,Great Property,Stayed here in June. Convenient to Hop on Hop off lines & bus stops. Fantastic breakfast offered with wide assortment of great food.  Staff was very friendly and helpful with dining tips and directions.,5,2018,08,01
240,Wonderful Stay,Stayed here for my birthday at the beginning of July and I immensely enjoyed my stay. A birthday card and chocolates were left in my room which was a beautiful touch. Rooms were spacious and beds very comfortable. The restaurant had a great selection on the menu for food as well as beverages. Great location and the hydro pool is beautiful.,4,2018,08,01
240,Clean comfortable and convenient,"The hotel was very comfortable and clean.  The staff was very helpful and friendly.  The hotel was across the street from the Jail, which was a great tour, and gardens and museums.  it was a short walk, even with luggage, to the train station.  Overall a great experience.",5,2018,07,31
240,Waitress,"Had the most amazing breakfast last weekend, the biggest breakfast selection I have seen in a very long time, from the fresh cut fruits to the special orders of pancakes and omelettes, also to the very enthusiastic waitress Nikita who couldn't of done enough for us with great tips for local tourist attractions and a great attitude, she is an credit to your business. They also have an amazing spa facilities. ",5,2018,07,30
240,Lovely hotel room and staff,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. It was the final day of our trip and The ten days had been hectic and busy. This Hilton was calm and cool with large air
Conditioned rooms. We had already toured Dublin so we weren‚Äôt looking to be in the thick of Things again so location was fine for us. If you‚Äôre looking to visit kilmainham Gaol and the Guinness factory you‚Äôre in the right area. Other sights are a long way away however. Good access to the airport without having to drive deep into Dublin‚Äôs inner area. The staff at the front desk were brilliant and ready to help. We felt at home. ",5,2018,07,30
240,Modern clean tidy hotel,"Modern clean tidy hotel, excellent rooms, comfortable bed, good breakfast, helpful polite staff, just outside the city centre in a safe and attractive suburb of Dublin. Will definitely be back when we next visit Dublin ",5,2018,07,30
240,Last 2 days of a 2-week holiday in Wales and Ireland,Hilton Dublin Kilmainham was our last hotel / B&B accommodation at the end of a two-week holiday traveling around Wales and Ireland. It was a perfect place to end our trip. We were tired; we wanted convenience and service; and good location. We got it all. ,5,2018,07,30
240,Traveling from America,Hotel was nice. It was on the far side of town and not too much around other than the gaol. Pre book the gaol. We were unable to go as it was full. First or last tour since you won't likely be around the hotel during the day.,5,2018,07,30
240,Great hotel. ,Really nice hotel. Good location. Great hydrotherapy pool. Great food. Bar and restaurant is lovely. Breakfast options in the morning are plentiful and tasty. Great staff. Rooms excellent. Pillows uncomfortable but that‚Äôs my only complaint. ,4,2018,07,28
240,Great spa pool,"We  stayed here on our last night in Dublin. The area isn't convenient to anywhere except the zoo and Gaol. actually it was pretty far from the city center. We loved the hotel, the staff, the great breakfast, room, bed, business center and most of all, the spa and fitness center. They have a hydrotherapy pool, sauna, and jaccuzi. everything was perfect.  There is a hop on and hop off bus, other city buses, but we took a taxi everywhere. It's a 5 star experience.",5,2018,07,24
240,Well appointed hotel,"Stayed here for 5 nights during our last trip to Dublin.  We booked an accessible room and the desk staff went out of their way to have our room ready as soon as possible as we arrived after an early arriving flight. Any staff we ran into thereafter remembered our name and room number.
The location, while a bit out of the way from the city center, was very convenient because the hotel is directly across the street from the Kilmainham Gaol ( a very popular tourist attraction). There is a taxi stand in front of the hotel which is in use while the Gaol is open so transportation was never a problem.
The only issue which had nothing to do with the hotel was due to it's location, if you are looking for other dining options there are very few options without traveling.
The accessible room was the best we have been in. Large, with a very well thought out bathroom. Very clean.
We would definitely stay here again.",5,2018,07,22
240,Beautiful room - great staff!,"We stayed at this same Hilton five years - and decided to come back to celebrate our anniversary.  Fantastic staff!  David C (breakfast mgr) heard that our flight out on Sunday was at 7 am and offered to have two brown bag breakfasts ready for us at check-out.  Note:  our cab picked us up at 4:45 am.  What a nice touch!   One of the bartenders, Dani, went above and beyond as well.  Those personal touches helped make our stay a delight.",5,2018,07,22
240,Great hotel in a good spot,Parking underneath for 12 e a day.  Rooms big and good. Three chairs and desk. Power point above desk. Good breakfast. Lunch and dinner not so good. But nice ambience. Yellow hop on hop off bus stop across the road.  Opposite jail and museum of modern art.  So great spot.  We went across the road to la dolce vita for dinner.  Great service and food. A bit loud and hot. ,4,2018,07,22
240,Great for Brunch/Lunch,The Hilton Kilmainham is a great spot for a bite to eat. There is a great selection to choose from and staff are really helpful and friendly. Gluten free options are available and the Bar is wheelchair accessible.,5,2018,07,19
240,Great Hotel,"Stayed here for one night our last night in Ireland. The hotel has guest parking underneath hotel for a fee, which is a nice feature for a city hotel. Our room was spacious, clean and comfortable and we had a view of Kilmainham Gaol which is directly across the street. There were several restaurants and pubs within a block of the hotel. We enjoyed the breakfast, and there were many self serve items or you can request hot items as well. We left by 7:30 am midweek for the airport and the drive took approximately 35 minutes to get to rental car return. I‚Äôm a loyal Hilton Honors member, and this hotel represents Hilton well, with great room, a friendly staff and a wonderful breakfast. ",5,2018,07,15
240,"Good facilities, less good position","Of three Dublin HIltons that I have experienced, this one has the least favourable position for travel, shops and attractions (Except, obviously, for Kilmainham jail which is literally across the street), but the rooms, restaurant, and staff are all very good.  The hotel has a good bar/restaurant but it is a hotel facility and therefore both expensive and not a 'local attraction'.  There is a terrible bar (Patriot Inn) across the street but otherwise shops are about a mile away and Heuston station and the LUAS tram service are both about a mile walk away. That may not matter to younger guests who might like the walk but older visitors will need to consider their balances of desires for a hotel.  This one is high end and very pleasant to stay in, but not as convenient as a base for seeing Dublin.",4,2018,07,14
240,"Great Hotel, Great Location!","The best stay of four hotels during our seven day vacation!  Tremendous location by the ""Hop-On, Hop-Off"", across from the Old Prison and Museum; Cordial staff, super room, great A/C!  Our favorite of dozens of Hiltons worldwide.",5,2018,07,13
240,Not impressed,"Very ordinary hotel, definitely in need of an update. Breakfast was just OK. Staff were friendly all round though. Best thing we thought was the proximity to Kilmainham Gaol - which was literally just across the road as well as being very close to the Irish Museum of Modern Art. As this was the beginning of our driving trip around Ireland we chose this hotel because it was 10 minutes walk away from Avis Car Hire.",3,2018,07,13
240,Nice!,"Room was beautiful, with view of square, hotel patio, busy Dublin streets. Very spacious and quiet. Comfy beds with great pillows. Cleaning staff professional. Overall, a great stay! I would not recommend the breakfast buffet---too much food that was not up to usually high standards across most of Ireland. No other breakfast options were available. Hotel staff very friendly & helpful with ideas for tourism. Nice for the price.",5,2018,07,11
240,"Nice, clean, and comfortable, but not the closest to the city","Stayed here for 4 nights in January. Not one complaint about this hotel! Staff were very nice, room was clean and comfortable, and the restaurants were very good! The only downside is that it is not so close to the main city, but there is a hop on hop off bus stop right across the street that you can take to get all over the city and right into the main area.",5,2018,07,08
240,Great Hotel!,"The place to stay in Kilmainham! Beautiful rooms, helpful staff & a nice breakfast. Had a wonderful time. Hotel location is close to the hop-on-hop-off bus tour and there are some nice local restaurants close to the hotel. Nice to be away from the hubbub of dowmtown Dublin.",5,2018,07,06
240,Amazing stay,"My mom and I spent three nights here while visiting Dublin. The only negative is that it isn't close to the city center, but the hotel is clean and nice, service was fantastic, and the food was great. Restaurant service is spotty throughout Europe and breakfast doesn't really offer 
full service as it is a buffet, but the food was great. We did a hop on hop off bus for 2 days of our stay, which was super convenient for transportation since it stops out front at the jail. We really loved our stay and highly recommend this property. ",5,2018,07,05
240,"Great food, poor management and customer service ","We had breakfast here and the food was really nice , very disappointed with the lack of attention, we sat outside, took about 15 minutes for someone to notice us, another 10 minutes to order, breakfast portions comes with Coffee or tea , we asked if we could get a cappuccino instead and we were told NO, than we order a cappuccino and we had to go inside after 10 minutes and ask for it because they forgot about it ,so we got the first order (coffee and water )after 35 of siting outside , finally the food arrived, breakfast was tasty and huge , no manager checked of us with the food, nothing, every single time we wanted something we had to go inside and ask for it . Maybe if the management will do more training with their staff ,service will be better, that‚Äôs just my opinion. Overall food was very nice but service was very poor. Will be back here again? Maybe , just for food . ",2,2018,07,04
240,Amazing hotel,"I want to review this hotel as a local! I frequently visit the hotel (once a week at least). Sometimes to use the pool and sometimes to have food on the beautiful terrace. The staff are incredibly friendly, welcoming and genuinely helpful. We have a toddler who loves the flavoured  water at reception. She is always warmly welcomed and staff never seem bothered by her frequent trips to the water dispenser! Indeed on our most recent trip, the receptionist gave our little girl a Teddy bear. She has named it 'Hilton'!! The staff at the leisure centre are even better! Sveltana runs a great ship and is most personable. Paul, Emma and Marco are just fantastic too. We are thinking of moving house and one of the things holding us back is that we would no longer be walking distance to this great hotel. If you're visiting Dublin, it's a great spot facing a recently renovated plaza. The number of locals eating in Broyage is testament to the consistency of food quality and service. Go raibh m√≠le maith agaibh. ",5,2018,07,04
240,"Great hotel, nice location, clean, modern, excellent facilities and with fab service","We stayed here for 2 nights while travelling over to see Jim Gaffigan in concert.  I chose this place, as the location wasn't right in the centre but close enough to jump a cab in or drive into town.  Also, in my experience, I've never stayed at a bad Hilton (whether it;s a higher end one or a Garden Inn) and we were not disappointed with our choice.

There is secure parking on site at 12 euros a day for guests (which is really good value) and is easy to locate as you turn onto the one way street where the hotel frontage is located.  You can come in and out as much as you like, but need to get your ticket validated each time you do, so that the machine doesn't think you need to pay for your parking at each exit.  There were plenty of spaces although there is a height restriction due to the low ceilings in the parking garage.

Our check in was smooth and quick (as we use the Hilton Honors app to check in before arriving) and the receptionist was nice, polite, friendly and professional (which I have to say was exactly the same for every single person we interacted with - we couldn't find a bad word to say about any staff member!)  You have to insert a room card into the elevator to reach the actual room floors, but can get from the parking floors below up to reception without (a nice security feature).

The hotel is large, with a lovely restaurant/bar and a great breakfast area.  All areas are spotless and well appointed feeling modern yet comfortable.  The corridors are light and airy, and the hotel has a total of 5 floors of rooms.  We unfortunately never got chance to try out the spa or hydrotherapy pool (which looked fab) - maybe next time!).

We had booked a suite with balcony (as wanted a little splurge as a treat) and it was excellent!  Plenty of space, a large wardrobe, nice seating area, massive bed and a nice bathroom - not to mention the huge balcony with nice views across the city (we were facing south onto Inchicore Road and the historic Kilmainham Gaol, and so we got the sun all day long and it felt positively Mediterranean as we visited during a heatwave!)  We made the most of the room and balcony during our stay and would definitely choose this room again if not sticking to a budget.  There is a nice little coffee machine, a fridge, wine glasses and bottle opener in the desk area (and a tea tray with kettle tucked away in the wardrobe).  The comfy armchairs are great for having a cuppa in the morning once you get out of the large comfy bed!  Just one thing (and this was only probably due to the excessive temperatures that we were getting which are pretty unusual for the UK & Ireland) was that the AC unit wasn't as robust as most we have experienced in lots of US hotels, but then as I say, those hotels in super hot areas such as Utah, Arizona, Nevada etc need to have AC blasting to battle the standard heat.  It would've been welcome though if we could've just kicked it up a bit more and got the air a bit cooler but it wasn't uncomfortable, just not icy like I enjoy it!  lol!

We decided to opt for room service on our first evening, as were tired from travelling (with an early start and a short but delayed flight from the UK), and were so pleased with the quality of the food, that we ended up having an early dinner the next night (before our concert) as it was so convenient and excellent quality at a decent price.  We had a couple of burgers the first night, which were served with fabulous home cooked chips and some nice condiments (and I was so busy enjoying them, I never even stopped to snap some pics!) and then the second night had a steak sandwich and a chicken burger - again both with nice sides and were both fresh, tasty, hot and delivered quickly. We even opted for having our breakfast delivered up on our second morning (we had selected for a bed and breakfast package and so only had to pay a supplemental tray fee for delivery to the room).  

The breakfast was fabulous too!  There was lots to choose from in the buffet downstairs (along with some 'to order; items like omelettes etc) including cooked full-Irish items, a great continental selection, plus fresh fruit, oatmeal, smoothies, yogurts and juices etc.  We are always satisfied with the Hilton breakfasts wherever we travel and this was one of the best we have had.  Even when delivered up as room service next morning, it was fresh and perfectly cooked - the scrambled eggs were to die for!

The bathroom is well laid out and ours had both a freestanding shower cubicle, plus a bath which has a shower head on too, and a nice sink/vanity area.  There are a couple of nice waffle robes and slippers included for folks to use.  The only improvement I would suggest (for 'hand-luggage only' travellers like us, would be a small tube of toothpaste to go along with the usual toiletries, but I know this isn't something most hotels provide so can't really complain).

There is a Eurospar convenience store a block down the main road for any things you may have forgotten and taxis right outside for getting into town, and the hotel is well placed for getting out and about.  We wouldn't hesitate to stay here again, or recommend this place to our friends and family should they be visiting Dublin.  An excellent experience all round!!",5,2018,07,01
240,Dispappointing,We have stayed at this hotel before and been very pleased. This time there were deficiencies. Our shower ran hot and cold and the maximum heat was not very hot. The bath drain plug was permanently closed and we were not given enough bars of soap. The reception service was quite formal and not particularly friendly and the quality of the breakfast buffet had declined. The keyed elevator security system caused us no end of frustration trying to get to our floor.,3,2018,07,01
240,Wonderful Place to Stay,"The staff at Kilmainham made the trip to Dublin for my family and I wonderful.  We arrived well before the check in time and they graciously accommodated our luggage so we could go explore the city.  Furthermore, they worked tirelessly to get our accommodations prepared and we checked in about 2 hours before the allotted time.  Additionally, the hotel was very clean and the front desk staff helped us to explore what they knew of the city, book hop on, hop off bus, etc.  Highly recommended place to stay if you are ever in Dublin.",5,2018,06,30
240,"Picky Traveler, Way Better than Expected! ","This hotel was absolutely a surprise! I was upgraded to a large beautiful room with large balcony and views.  The weather has been unseasonably warm, and the air conditioning was ice cold (adjustable with thermostat) which was much appreciated.  Unfortunately, the night before, at the Hilton I had checked out of in Leiden, the Netherlands had poor airco, hence little sleep.  I had tickets to the Gaol tour at 4pm, which was really great.  If you know, or can read up on Irish history in 1910s-20s prior to taking the tour, it will be even more informative.  Then enjoyed some passable food at lovely outdoor terrace restaurant - the draw is the outdoors and the lovely environment and relaxed vibe.  Warning - service can be slow, but fine if you are just on holiday.  Across the street is a lovely park for walking, and very pretty gardens surrounding the historic hospital, which now houses IMMA (Irish Museum of Modern Art.) Overall, a great stay and I would return for sure! I would highly recommend for the weary traveler who enjoys a bit of nature, a bit of history, and a bit of fun all within  (very) short walking distance. ",5,2018,06,30
240,Dated,"This hotel needs to be updated. Staff was great and friendly! The location not good
kind of far from town.The bar in hotel needs more help.The coffee in room is instant,
no coffee pot just hot water kettle:(",4,2018,06,26
240,Two nights in Dublin,"This is a nice newer hotel just outside the main city of Dublin. I stayed there two nights as part of a guided tour. The staff was friendly and the room was comfortable. I would have preferred being a little closer to the heart of the city, but this is a great hotel.",4,2018,06,26
240,excellent location and great staff,"My thanks to Fiona and Ana for sorting out my room needs before I arrived. Hotel is across the street from the Kilmainham jail (goal) and the Modern Arts museum and formal garden, and close to Phoenix park. The front desk staff Gabriel, Renata and Velia (and another woman with a name beginning with S, forgive my poor memory) were friendly, professional and helpful. Breakfast buffet opens at 7 am was Euro 15, bacon and eggs at Lime Tree cafe euro 7 (opens at 8 am). The Patriot pub across the street provides pub food until 5 pm then Italian food. I had a very good lamb shank dinner at the Hilton one night. Buy a LEAP card at the garage a block from the hotel and recharge it for tram/ local bus. Arthur's Pub (great Irish stew) is a short bus ride away (bus 13 or 40) and is right beside the Guinness factory. Take the Historical Walking Tour downtown and Kilmainham jail tour for an 'Irish History 101' mini course. Michael Fox and his Boyne Valley tour is wonderful. (Trip Advisor Day Tours Dublin).",5,2018,06,25
240,Perfect for Us,"We stayed at Hilton Dublin Kilmainhan at start of 10 day multi city Ireland Vacation.  When we arrived at about 11 am after an overnight flight, our room was ready, which allowed us to start our vacation more time effectively.  We asked for a quiet room location, which is probably overkill since hotel in a quiet area.  Beds were very comfortable.  We had Kilmainham Goal timed tickets on day of arrival, so headed there first.  Also used Green hop on hop off bus for first 24 hours.  Since bus does not stop at Kilmainham Goal early (9;45 am first pick up?) we ended taking a taxi to main part of city on following morning. We really liked the Green Hop on/Off due to driver commentary.  Great way to learn about a city new to us. There is a lovely/fast breakfast spot a few doors away from hotel.  Breakfast was not included in our room rate, which ended up working to our advantage.  We did pick up our rental vehicle at arrival into Dublin, which saved us a lot of hassle when we departed Dublin two days later.  The Hilton location on outskirts of city allowed us to feel safe driving to after overnight flight (no narrow city streets).  We then left the car in Hotel lot at $12 Euro a day.  Maybe not most economic way to go, but was nice to get into car, go to hotel, then leave city early on first day of road trip. This hotel is away from the city center, if the buzz of city downtown is what you are looking for, then this hotel is not for you.  if you are looking for a quiet, comfortable location away from the city center this will nicely meet your needs.  Staff very courteous and accommodating.",5,2018,06,24
240,Business meeting,"Excellent hotel in Dublin not quite central Dublin but not far out in a bus route of 10 mins to city center.  
Reception was pleasant and rooms were spotless with brilliant WiFi. 
Food was good with very pleasant staff. 
Well recommend ",4,2018,06,21
240,"Fabulous hotel, friendly staff!","We recently stayed here as part of our anniversary trip to Europe. We loved this hotel, the room was clean and comfortable and every member of the staff that we came into contact with was polite and friendly. We enjoyed the breakfast buffet in the morning that came with our Hilton Honors benefits. We had emailed ahead of time to ask for a particular type of room and the manager was very responsive. We loved the location, very close to the city bus stops and a nice park across the street. Shout out to the amazing bartender Kalen, (if I‚Äôm spelling his name correctly). We have stayed in many Hiltons  across the United States and this one in Ireland is our favorite! We loved it our stay!",5,2018,06,18
240,"Nicer Newer Hotel Near Prison, Heuston Train","This place has a newer vibe, although I'm not sure how long it's actually been around.  The rooms are very nice, clean, well appointed.  The junior family suite is basically a large room with a single bed right next to a larger queen, rather than a room with two somewhat separate sleeping areas (I think this is more common to Europe than the States).  We were up early to catch the Airlink bus to the airport, so I can't comment on the breakfast.

The location is great for those interested in touring the Kilmainham Gaol which is right across the street.  We didn't have time for that, but chose the hotel because it's also a very quick cab ride from Heuston Train Station which is where our evening train from Galway arrived.  The next morning, there was a cab waiting at the cab stand out front for our ride back to the station where we were able to catch the Airlink bus to the airport on its first stop (a much better bet than trying to catch it later on the route when it fills up and becomes harder to board).  The hotel front desk was happy to call us a cab had there not been one waiting.

We were able to print out our boarding passes for our flight for free, but had to order them up on our phone and then email them to the front desk for printing, rather than just using a hotel computer/printer on our own.  

Honestly, it feels like hotels are phasing out the hotel computer idea.  I had a Marriott recently try to charge me to use their computer --- until it didn't work right!   Not sure this system was really all that unreasonable.  Do make sure you're connected to the hotel wifi before you email the desk, though.  This initially caused a problem when I wasn't connected.  Being a Hilton Honors member, the wifi is free, of course.  

A nice hotel overall, though, and convenient to several locations you may be interested in.",5,2018,06,18
240,Great Location,"A great location for a stay, a quick cab to the Temple bar area but what makes this location so nice is it is QUIET at night. Our cousins stayed next to the Temple Bar area in Dublin and said the partying never stopped, very noisy at night. Not for us, quick cab and totally quiet for a good night sleep before hitting Dublin the next day!",5,2018,06,17
240,Comfortable and Clean,"Spent 3 nights at this nice hotel right across the street from the Kilmainham Gaol museum. Our room had a view of a park and there were a few places to eat nearby. Service was great and we had a nice dinner in the hotel on our last night. The room was comfortable, clean, and quiet.",5,2018,06,16
240,Surprised at the standard of the room,"I decided to try this hotel as the place that I normally stay was full.
I was allocated a beautiful room overlooking the Gaol.  The view is amazing.  I was so pleasantly surprised by the room. Great bed/ bathroom/ super desk and study area which I need for my stay. A great find overall!

One flaw . . . as I was preparing for a work event, I decided to eat in - in the bar thinking that it would be fast. Well - this was the worst experience that I ever had...
Honestly, I waited and waited and waited and .....
It was a total disaster - when the food eventually came, it was awful - no flavour.
I was surprised by this and ask the manager about the situation and he told me that 2 of their chefs had called in sick - so.... that explained that.

Breakfast on the other hand was super! - great variety / plenty of everything and a good room. Definitely, this is a place for B&B - if a special occasion, eat out!!",5,2018,06,15
240,Excellent stay!,My sister and I enjoyed 8 nights at this hotel. Renate and her staff members were so welcoming and made every effort to have our room ready early after our long overnight flight.  The rooms were spotless and beds comfy.  Getting to and from the downtown areas of Dublin was easy on the numbers 13 or 40 busses using a Leap card. The gas station down the road has them and they can be topped up there too. The Kilmainham Gaol is right across the street so you can begin sightseeing there. We didn't book in advance but got in on a tour.  The hotel patio is a great place to relax and enjoy drinks and eats. The food is excellent as was the service. We would highly recommend staying here!,5,2018,06,15
240,GREAT LOCATION CLOSE TO HEUSTON TRAIN STATION,"We stayed here for one night only before the start of our tour the next day.  It's close to the train station where the tour started from; and you can walk - about 20 minutes or enjoy a 5 minute taxi ride. Great location and the pub across the street had a great food. We are grateful for the Hilton brand - since we know what to expect. The air-conditioned room was a huge plus - it was unusually warm in Dublin. Most local hotels do not have air-conditioned rooms.  There is also a hop-on, hop-off bus stop, right across. Love the location.",5,2018,06,12
240,Very nice property near Kilmainham Gaol tourist site,"Stayed two nights as part of a tour group. This is one of the nicest hotels we used in our two week tour of Ireland. This property has the usual high standards of a Hilton. Large, clean and well-appointed room, but the strange architectural screen on the outside of the building (over the windows) blocked any possible view of the park across the street. Breakfast was good, but staff a bit overworked. You have to speak up to get some coffee poured! Unremarkable breakfast room without any views out the windows. For those who need it, there is a laundromat 3 minutes walk away, and a Spar grocery in the same direction. While this is not very close to Dublin city sites (45 minute walk), it is a nice residential-type area with nearby parks, including the Kilmainham Gaol across the street.",4,2018,06,12
240,Hotel #8 Globus Emerald Isle tour,This was our final hotel of our Globus Emerald Isle 9 Day Bus tour.  We were here 1 night but it felt very brief.  We arrived from our day of touring at about 4 pm.  Checked into room.  Showered and went out to The bus excursion to Guiness Factory for dinner at 6 pm.  We arrived back about 8:30ish pm then went across the street for cocktails at Patriots Pub. Later just went to room to sleep.  Woke up after 10 am.  Went to breakfast.  Checked out and flew home.  Everything that we briefly saw seemed very nice.  Beds were very comfortable.  Breakfast was very good.,4,2018,06,12
240,Homely,"4 of us stayed at the Hilton for a Ed Sheeran concert in May. It was a lovely homely hotel, with very clean rooms and comfortable beds. Restaurant however, wasn‚Äôt great. Very slow at bringing our dinner to us, we waited up to 30 minutes and a few things were missing once it arrived. The hotel is situated in a lovely area, across the road from a shop, pizza place and Kilmainham Gaol itself. 
It also had a great seating area outside and customer parking underground.",4,2018,06,11
240,Its a Hilton,"This property definitely screams Hilton. Close your eyes and this could have been anywhere in the world It is common and clean. I am not sure what I missed after reading all the glowing reviews. The staff was friendly and it very much had a small town feel. The restaurant and bar area were ok. The shower was not great. It only had a partial glass wall and water goes everywhere. The sinks also had a bad drain design and you had to use to your hands. The location is more on the outskirts of the city so unless you want to be near the historic prison, not sure it is a top pick,",3,2018,06,10
240,New property - good rooms!,Brand new property. Car park is a bit difficult to navigate and the location is about 25 mins walk / 15 mins taxi away from the city centre --- the tourist map is not to scale! Overall pleasant stay. Room is good and above average for Dublin (see photos).,4,2018,06,09
240,Spectacular hotel,"If you are looking for top notch quality, look no further.  The hotel and staff are extremely impressive, and will not disappoint.  The location gives you terrific access to the Dublin Gaol (Jail), a must see attraction in Dublin.  The restaurant on site is outstanding, and if you go...Be sure to ask for Jane, a young lady who is absolutely a talent at her profession.  We were made to feel as though we were the only table eating in the facility.  Great hotel, highly recommend it!",5,2018,06,09
240,Exceeded Expectations!,"Had a fantastic stay at the Hilton Kilmainham.  Staff was outstanding (especially Ana) and they worked very closely with us to extend our stay a night even though the Hotel was sold out that evening.  The rooms were very quiet, beds were comfortable, downtown was about a 20 minute walk and Guinness Storehouse was about a 15 minute walk so location worked well.  Breakfast buffet was good and got a space right away in the underground parking lot so no issues there.  All in all a very solid Hilton experience.",5,2018,06,07
240,Ireland,The staff at Hilton Kilmainham was amazing they provided excellent Customer Service during our holiday in Ireland. Mrs. Ana and her partner at the front desk were very accommodating and attentive. They were also very knowledgeable about the area and things to do with my family. Thank You All!,5,2018,06,01
240,Wonderful stay!,"My room was beautiful, quiet, and comfortable. The entire hotel was clean and the staff was excellent. My view looked over a busy but beautiful intersection. I was on a tour and only stayed here my first night. All of the other hotels I stayed at were slightly disappointing after this location. If I visit Dublin again, I have no doubt I would stay here again.",5,2018,05,29
240,Lack of in room dining options,My only complaint about the hotel is there is hardly any food to choose for late night in room dining. I was told there was just sandwiches and paninis. It's unfortunate there wasn't much to choose from.,2,2018,05,27
240,"Upgrades needed, stale smell","As a Hilton Honors Members for many years I expect more for my loyalty. I booked this hotel using points and was disappointed. Upon entering the hotel has an old smell, not pleasant. A change of carpet and furniture is necessary. The hotel check in staff were not able to make recommendations on restaurants outside of the hotel and we‚Äôre hesitant after I gave names of places and insisted on us eating in the hotel (the smell cause us to say no!). Room smelled stale upon entering. The Twin beds were not stationary and rolled around, however the beds slept comfortably. The face towels were all smelly and very thin. The carpet was old, dirty looking and worn. The bathroom had older appliances. We had to manually open the sink to drain. No views; Express Airport type hotel. Very basic not extra
Paid with points unsure how much per night but I think $125 or
Less is reasonable however it‚Äôs by the Kilmainham jail so I‚Äôm sure they are charging more. I would give 2.5 
Stars. We stayed at the Intercontinental when we arrived prior to our departure for a side trip. This was a second leg of our trip. I would not recommend this hotel.",2,2018,05,26
240,Great hotel,"Just returned from the Hilton Kilmainham, and I had a wonderful long stay, 10 days.  As a single female for the first half (my husband joined me halfway through), I felt very safe coming and going from this hotel, which was my main concern as I had not travelled solo before.  The front desk staff were helpful, with lots of great advice on how to get around the city.  The breakfast was wonderful, so nicely presented, a lively bright room, never had to wait in a lineup or anything.  It was my main meal of the day.  The staff who ran it were quick to offer help.

It was an easy base to see lots of Ireland from.  Did a couple bus tours (Wicklow & Kilkenny, and Howth on another day). Also just minutes from Heuston station (took the train to Galway).  

Also, there were almost always taxis queued outside, and a bus stop about 5 minutes away, which go right into the city centre.  The hotel is a bit outside city centre, but this made it very accessible.  Also, the red hop on hop off bus stops right by the hotel. I loved the location.

There is also a great little pub on the same corner as the Hilton called the Patriot which had really good food.  Just a short walk up the road was a cute little bakery and a coffee shop, as well as a small grocery store, which was great as there are no vending machines in the hotel.  

Was really happy with my stay.  Thank you, Hilton.",4,2018,05,24
240,Normal Hilton,"The hotel is a bit outside the center. Rooms are comfortable. Beds sleep well. Bathroom has a bath.  Fitness area has enough equipment, but felt a a bit dirty. Breakfast is good, but nothing special. Staff is friendly.",3,2018,05,21
240,Pot of Gold at the end of a rainbow,"Arrived early with hubby in tow after flight from Newark New Jersey. Celebrating our 40th wedding anniversary but stuck in our ways enough to book on our Hilton account. We were both really dragging, we did not sleep at all on the plane so to say we were tired and cranky and wanted to go home was an understatement. Ana at the front desk was our first fairy sighting. With the aid of the notes from Fiona, she typed in my name, looked up and smiled and said "" welcome, I know why you are here!  I almost cried when she handed us our room keys immediately with a lovely gift. The room was SPOTLESS! The bathroom was SPOTLESS! The shower pressure was hot and like a fire hose- and we care about good shower pressure . The bed is Queen size - based on American standards with four large fluffy pillows. I was so tired I can't say if it was comfortable because I was asleep within two seconds of putting my head on the pillow. Many many thanks to Ava at the front desk and Fiona for the email correspondence in advance.",5,2018,05,20
240,Worked very well for us!,"This hotel provided us with a good location base to tour Dublin.  It is on the outskirts which provides you with a cheaper, quieter option to stay at.  We had a 72 hr. DoDublin bus pass that made it easy to get around from here.  The hotel was clean, the staff helpful - stored our luggage & took it up to our room when our room became available after we arrived before check in time so that we could get out and tour Dublin, had a kettle, tea/coffee in room, Hair dryer, Iron.  No fridge.  Bathroom was large & had a tub which I loved after a day of walking.  Right across the street from the Old Kilmainham Gaol which is worthwhile to visit. Had one meal in the restaurant which was ok.  Found the limetree cafe 2 minutes away that fit our needs well.  Do Dublin bus stop out front, local buses that we took downtown were a short 5 minute walk away as well as Union 8 restaurant - very good, The Natural Bakery and Cafe and a convenience store where I picked up fresh oranges for snacks. We also rented a car from Avis which is about a 10 minute walk from the hotel that provided great service.",4,2018,05,17
240,Very Nice Hotel,This Hotel is lovely and has a great location. The only problem is that if the weather is nice the terrace gets busy and there is not enough staff to deal with it. I was there last week and although the food was very good the service was very slow and there was dirty glasses left on tables that were not cleared for the evening. If they get this right then the hotel would be very enjoyable. ,4,2018,05,17
240,Never Again! Horrible Customer Service,"We booked months in advance on the recommendation of a family member. I contacted Hilton Rewards to see if we could get an early check in as we were arriving at 7am in the morning. No problem, they said. You can check in at 9am. This was confirmed twice on the phone and with an email confirmation.

We arrived at 12 noon (delayed flight) and they wouldn‚Äôt let us check in. The front desk employee (Ionut) was a complete jerk. Said we would have to come back at 3:00pm for check in. He said they never approved an early check in. They also told me they had two reservations in my name. For some reason, Hilton booked it twice. He at first told me I would be charged for the second reservation also‚Ä¶..until I told him I would fight it with my credit card.

We left with instructions to come back at 3:00pm and the room still wasn‚Äôt ready. It was at this point, past check in time and still no room. We waited till about 3:30 and finally got a room with the air conditioning broken. Went back to the very unkind and unprofessional Ionut at the front desk to get a new room. We hurriedly changed rooms because we were now late for our appointed time at Kilmainham Gaol. 

While we were at the Gaol, I contacted Hilton Rewards to tell them what had happened in detail. They assuredly told me it was unexceptable to be treated that way.  Hilton did put 50,000 points in my account but it wasn‚Äôt enough compared to the very unwelcome behavior and treatment by their front desk staff.

The room was good, however the safe was broken and they couldn‚Äôt fix it. 

I would never recommended this hotel due to the front desk staff.",1,2018,05,14
240,"Clean hotel, nice room, just not very friendly","The hotel was clean and the room was nice. The hotel is slightly out of town, which we appreciated. It was nice that the hop-on/hop-off buses pick up right outside. The breakfast was very good but pricey if not included in the room fee. We found the staff to not be very friendly or helpful, but they were professional. I would recommend the hotel and stay again.",4,2018,05,13
240,"Nice Room, Nice Bed","Stayed here last night before we flew back to States.  Room was very nice, reasonably priced, and clean.  Nice firm bed.  Room had very high ceilings which was unusual but nice.  Wifi was free and speedy.  Close to west side attractions, but a bit of a hike from the Temple Bar area.  Somewhat convenient to Heuston Train Station and Airport Bus stop, about a 15 minute walk.",5,2018,05,12
240,Great hotel,"Nice new hotel, room large and clean and a pretty nice view of Belfast.  Offsite parking was the only dissatisfaction although understandable in an urban city. Breakfast was lovely and better then most I have had in Ireland.",5,2018,05,07
240,THIS is where you wanna be!,"Poured over reviews for days. Wanting to be in budget and close to sights..like Guinness Brewery n Brazen Pub..walkable when weather was decent. PERFECT quiet location for rooms. GREAT beds- nice outdoor patio-- easy walk and short taxi rides to mid town. YOU wont regret being a few miles out of town. Also great food and Pubs walkable.  PS..I am a Travel Agent..so when I research for myself or client travel..it is extensive..,for I am beyond picky! loved it..perfect!!",5,2018,05,06
240,Great Staff! Close to the jail and easy transport to city center.,"This hotel is close the the jail (right across the street). The hop on/hop off bus also stops across the street. In addition public transportation to city center is within walking distance. I would like to have had some additional dining options in walking distance. There is just a few and they are just ok. There is a small grocery down the block and a gas station for quick snacks. Staff is great, but hotel could use some updating.",4,2018,05,05
240,This was the best hotel of the entire tour,"This was our first stop in Ireland during a tour of the country. Everything was wonderful.
Ana was very attentive and even assisted us with mailing postcards to the grandkids. 
None of the other hotels on our tour were willing to assist in this, I might add.
The hotels location to some of the interesting sights was great. We were able to walk back from the Guiness Storehouse easily.
Our experience in the restaurant was equally great. I was not too interested in the egg options available for breakfast, but they did make a nice omelet for me.
We will definitely be back to Ireland and will make a point of staying here again.
Thanks,
Kim and Leo Palmer",5,2018,05,02
240,Location is everything!,We chose this HIlton because it was within easy walking distance to so much and close to recommended sites and restaurants.   It wasn't the closest to the airport but was very easy to access the airport.  Front desk service from checkin  to check out was wonderful.   The beds were cozy and the breakfast HUGE.    We'd definately stay here again.   ,4,2018,05,01
240,Stayed there for my Stag Weekend,"The rooms were expensive 145 euros per night, Breakfast was an additional 15 euros, but provided everything fruit, cereal, full english, coffee toast etc. 
The hotel like all Hiltons was clean, the rooms were perfectly adequate with tv, iron and board, hairdryer, and tea coffee facilities - but no fridge.
The hotel had swimming pool, sauna etc and the staff were efficient and helpful.
Due to the expense of the room our party shared rooms to reduce the cost and the hotel provided twin beds in the rooms. This hotel was close to the Dublin attractions.",4,2018,05,01
240,Great location/excellent service,Definitely would recommend this hotel - it has parking (not complimentary though)- the breakfast was very well served and the staff very attentive- we also had drinks and dessert at the bar one day and dinner the last night in Ireland ,5,2018,04,29
240,Nice property and service,"This hotel is not in the middle of the action but close enough to. Across the street from a lovely park and the former jail, historical landmark. The front desk staff was very helpful with directions and overall welcoming. The gym was decent. I would stay there again to enjoy Dublin without being in the middle of the action.",4,2018,04,28
240,Pleasant hotel on the outskirts of Dublin,"We enjoyed our stay here. Everything about the hotel was excellent including the spa. Our room was spacious, well appointed and comfortable. WiFi was free. 
On Saturday I complained about the state of the outside eating area - litter and food all over the floor. I wish to commend waitress Jane who responded to my complaint and quickly cleaned the area. She even pulled in a manager to help her.
We purchased a 72 hr Leap visitor travel card at the airport. This allowed us to travel around the city and coast using the Dart, Luas (tram) and buses rather than the Hop on Hop off buses.",4,2018,04,23
240,Great hotel right next to kilmainham.,"The breakfast was amazing, the beds were comfortable, and the location is great. There's a giant park right next door and the patriot in across the street is a great local spot . The kilmainham gaol is also right next store which makes for an easy tour.",5,2018,04,23
240,Forgettabel,"Dinner experience and Management interaction was truly something to forget.
Outside of this: location / cleanliness / rooms / breakfast were as you would expect from a centrally located Hilton. 1st ever time I felt the need to post a review on Tripadvisor",1,2018,04,22
240,Great spot,Across from Kilmainham Gaol. The art museum is across the street. The hotel has onsite parking. A patio lounge for great weather.  Breakfast. And a bistro bar. The rooms were clean and well appointed.  The front desk staff was accommodating and assisted with scheduling taxis and recommended local sites ,5,2018,04,20
240,Good stay,"We had a very enjoyable 2 night stay in a family room, the room was great very clean, staff at the hotel are excellent very friendly and helpful. The pool is excellent. The only reason I did not give 5stars is the fact that the restaurant is so overpriced, there really is no need to to charge so much for food and drink it certainly made us not drink as much!",4,2018,04,19
240,Business Training Event,"I have used Hilton Kilmainham several times as a venue for business training programmes.  All the staff are very attentive and provide great service. In particular I would like to commend and acknowledge Stefan who has been my regular point of contact with regard to room set up, facilities etc. He is extremely professional in his role, prompt with regard to attention, ensures that the small items are not overlooked and as a result the training day always run smoothly.  For me he is the face of the Hilton and he does a superb job!",5,2018,04,14
240,Very Good Breakfast,"I usually don't write reviews however this time I thought it necessary. My family and I were going to the Jail museum so we arrived very early thinking we could have a family breakfast to the restaurant around the area but we quickly realized it was some sort of a holiday and they were all closed.we managed to come across this hotel and we saw the brunch menu with full Irish breakfast.the host told us they were not serving brunch until 11.00 am and it was only 9.30 am we were starving.the host told us the price  was ‚Ç¨18.95 each and walked away.while we stood there lost and upset a waitress approached us and asked to assist.cut story short she went out of her way to accommodate us with the full Irish breakfast and served us the whole time.sold us about the Hilton hotel and we wished we were staying here.she was very professional,friendly and knowledgeable.her name was Velia truly a gem couldn't thank her enough.",5,2018,04,13
240,"Lovely Night, Comfy Room, Excellent Staff","The Hilton Kilmainham is an oasis in Dublin. (Solid 4-star Hotel.) We checked in mid-afternoon to a beautiful and comfortable room, with a walk-out balcony. What really stood out was Ana, who IMO, may be the best Hilton front manager, ever. She was so very helpful and pleasant (and thank you for the chocolate salted caramels!) Hotel is directly across from the Gaol, and places you on-the-spot for pick up by the Green DoDublin Hop-On-Hop-Off (the best hoho) Hotel is across from the Museum of Modern Art, with beautiful grounds to explore. 

We had dinner at the hotel: Delicious Fish & Chips, with generous drinks. The breakfast buffet in the morning was expansive, tasty and filling.

The location is a 10-minute walk to Hueston Station, where you can hop on the Luas light rail into town, and return to quiet evening away from the busy city center. From Hueston, the Airlink 747 to the airport. (Hueston is the first stop, so you board an empty coach, which will fill rapidly en route.)

Wish we had more time to enjoy the Hilton Kilmainham this visit (had an early flight.) We will be back and look forward to another fabulous stay. And next visit, with plans for the pool and spa.",5,2018,04,09
240,Mrs Bernadette Farrell,"I have to share my experience at this hotel , sadly my mother in law passed away last week .My family and I stayed for 3 nights and we also had the the funeral lunch at the Hilton.
From the moment we arrived the staff could not have done enough to help us at this very sad time .The food was fantastic , all of the staff were truly amazing .
The rooms were spacious and very clean .
The events staff Maeva , David the restaurant manager , Shauna and Anna at Reception Nikki and Jane serving breakfast drinks etc a very big thanks for making us very comfortable .
We honestly could not have asked for better service .
I have travelled a lot and can honestly say I have never met such dedicated lovely staff , nothing was too much trouble for any of them .I look forward to visiting again in the future under happier circumstances.Thank you to all at the Hilton in Kilmainham for a truly wonderful experience .",5,2018,04,07
240,Mr Aidan Farrell ,"Just a quick note to thank all the staff for looking after my family and siblings this week. Every single person in the hotel went completely out of their way in order to please and accommodate our whole group including the lunch in the restaurant for over 90 people after the funeral of my mum. You were a absolutely amazing so thank you! In addition the hotel is fabulous, rooms amazing and people working there the hardest working and kindest staff I have ever come across in any hotel in all my travels 
Thank you once again

240,Stay at the Hilton Kilmainham,"I am diamond member for life and have lived in hotel for about 20 years.   The management went out their way to accomadate us.   Every day we had tours,they would book the cab and fix us a sack breakfast. All details were ready at 6:15 am .   I was astounded.   The sack breakfast was a freshly made sandwich, fruit, yogurt and water.  Sometime we left early and they would go to the kitchen and get us coffee.   I enjoyed my stay there.  I will be writing a letter to management and believe me this is rare.   We were here for a week.",5,2018,04,06
240,Great stay in Dublin,"The Hilton Dublin Kilmainham is in a terrific location for both seeing some of the popular sights in Dublin and for renting a car close to the edge of the city to get out of town without having to drive in the Dublin traffic. The rooms are very nice (attractive, clean, and spacious) and the breakfast was excellent. The one disadvantage is that there are no family rooms, so 2 adults and 2 children have to book two rooms, but the second adjoining room is offered at 50% the price of the first room, so that helps.",5,2018,04,05
240,A fabulous stay in a very comfortable and modern hotel,"This is one of the best hotels we've stayed in and is probably the most affordable 4 star hotel around Dublin, and it really is a 4 star experience. The bed was massive, very comfy and in a huge room that could easily accommodate its size. The room was very comfortable, even for college work we had to get done, at an ample desk for study. We ordered room service on a few occasions which wasn't cheap but delicious and worth the cost. The TV was massive. The shower pressure was very powerful and the toiletries were so nice. The pool was lovely, beautiful lighting and a nice place to relax. The gym was very well equipped. The staff were fantastic, so accommodating and flexible, front desk, manager of the bar, room service, gym, cleaning staff etc. The hotel should be very proud of them! There is good security in the lifts, requiring a key card validation. It is a bit out of the way but the area is close to Heuston and the Luas and cheaper than city centre hotels so you really can't complain. It is a safe area, we were happy to have a midnight stroll to get some air. Which brings me to my only complaint. The room didn't have a window. And after our night out the first night we would have loved some air!! But all in all it was a fabulous stay and I would definitely stay again.",5,2018,04,03
240,A Real Treat,"First of all you need to know that this hotel is some way from the city centre, however it is within walking distance of two of Dublin's main attractions. Kilmainham Gaol is right across the road and the Guiness Storehouse is a 15-20 minute stroll away. Also there is a stop for the Hop on/Hop off bus right outside the Gaol and a regular service bus stop is about 5 minutes away. As for the hotel itself, it's very comfortable with a gym and pool and spa. The staff are very friendly and Jose at the front desk and Nikita in the Broyage Bar, in particular, were both very helpful. The food and drinks were excellent. We had a very tasty lunch on arrival in the Broyage Bar and breakfast and dinner couldn't be faulted either. We certainly felt very looked after during our stay.",5,2018,04,02
240,Bit out of the way but great stay,"We (group of 3) stayed at the Hilton Dublin Kilmainham over St. Patrick's Day weekend in a family room. The room was spacious and had a nice view, and all the staff we interacted with were very friendly. Only bad experience was that the hot tub was closed for maintenance when we tried to use it on Sunday evening, otherwise it was a great stay.

There wasn't too much immediately close to the hotel other than a pub and the Kilmainham Gaol, but it wasn't too bad to get into the city center from several bus routes nearby via Google Maps. There is a gas station about a 3 minute walk away from the hotel where you can buy or reload a fare card for the Dublin bus system.",5,2018,03,31
240,"Nice hotel, but avoid the bar","The hotel is well kempt, the staff are super friendly & helpful, and the location is good (if a little far from the centre); it‚Äôs right next to Kilmainham prison (well worth visiting) and it‚Äôs on the red route of the hop-on-hop-off tour bus (a great way to get an overview of the city).

We arrived quite late and there was a problem with the room, so we were offered meal and drinks vouchers for the bar while we waited. We were somewhat hungry and didn‚Äôt have any plans so this seemed like a bit of good fortune, as other TripAdvisor reviews held high praise! 

Unfortunately, the highest praise we can give was that we were happy we didn‚Äôt have to pay for the meal. The starters were rather large, which left little room for the mains. The food was generally bland and uninspired; we‚Äôve honestly had better at Harvester (a UK pub chain, and not a very good one). And the drinks were... poor.

We didn‚Äôt get chance to try the pool, but it did look amazing. We‚Äôd happily stay here again, but we‚Äôd avoid the bar. Even if it was free again.",4,2018,03,31
240,Great meal at Broyage bar and bistro,Had a fantastic dinner and a few drinks at Broyage at Hilton Kilmainham. Special thanks to Stephanie for great service. Us is so much Stephanie. We will be back soon to sample some more tasty food. Good pint of creamy Guinness too. ,5,2018,03,31
240,What a lovely place,"I would recommend the hotel to anyone.... the accommodation is first class with exceptional service throughout.  All staff are friendly and especially the breakfast staff. In particular Nikitita, Paula and Veala were all lovely and very chatty.  They couldn't do enough for you.  The rooms were very spacious with lovely big beds.  This was my first stay and my partners third and I would not book anywhere else.
The spa was beautiful and the whole hotel was very clean throughout.  It has easy access to public transport with lovely local areas to walk and see without the hassle and bustle of being in the central area.  Should be a 5 star hotel with the first class service.  We will always come back to this hotel from now on.",5,2018,03,28
240,great,Great location.  Great place to work nice view and close to the city.  The Bar area is great spacious and comfortable.  Nikita looked after us very well and was very attentive.  The food is good and has a relaxing ambience.,5,2018,03,26
240,Excellent customer service,This hotel is my go to place to meet friends and relax. I visit the bar area for coffee and relaxation. I always find the staff to be very helpful and friendly. One staff (Dawid) in particular is very helpful and knows exactly what I order in advance.,5,2018,03,25
240,Perfect little weekend escape ,"Would highly recommend this hotel. We close to the city centre and lots of popular attractions including the Phoenix Park, Kilmainham jail and the Museum of Modern Art. The staff were so professional and attentive. Special mention to Padraig Higgins who went out of his way to make our stay special. We had a very spacious room on the 5th floor and breakfast was a delight, very fresh and served in a v relaxed setting ",5,2018,03,25
240,Lovely pleasant stay,Staff fantastic..... Room comfortable..... Food in the restaurant outstanding.... We visited Dublin for the St Patrick‚Äôs day weekend. It was brilliant. Guinness factory well worth a visit. I would say the hotel is around 20mins ish from the centre(walking). To be honest we never attempted it there were plenty of taxis outside the hotel and the drivers were all friendly and knowledgeable of where to go. Food in the restaurant was outstanding would definitely recommend. Staff in reception and bar very welcoming and helpful,5,2018,03,22
240,Best hotel in Dublin,We had a wonderful two-week stay.  Right across the street from Kilmainham Gaol. The hotel staff are delightful and very accommodating.   Room are spacious and clean.  Restaurant and fitness center is first class.  ,5,2018,03,21
240,Fantastic Hotel with Awesome Amenities,"My mother and I took a trip to Dublin and stayed in multiple Hilton properties while abroad. The Hilton Dublin Kilmainham was one of my favorites! They had a great restaurant / bar where I was able to enjoy a pint of Guinness. And their fitness center and pool were by far the best I have ever seen in a Hilton hotel! Also, their is a beautiful park across the street that you can walk through on a nice day. Room was also very spacious for a European Hotel. Would love to stay at this property the next time I am in Dublin. 

Lastly, I do want to thank the woman who checked me in, super informative and was able to accommodate early check in!",5,2018,03,20
240,Our Trip To Dublin,This hotel has it all. The parking garage was a huge plus. Also absolutely try out the pool area. It was so nice just to relax in the pool & then hang out in the hot tub for a spell. I would recommend this Hotel to anyone on business or with family. It has it all.,5,2018,03,19
240,Metal screen facade totally destroys the views,"I came in on St. Patty's Day weekend, and since I booked late, this hotel, a little removed from the City Centre was one of few available. Given that, the value was ok, and if you can use the buses, it's a 20 minute ride to town. 
The pros: Good size room for Europe. Very clean, and restaurant reasonably priced.
The cons: My main gripe was the huge metal screen on the park side of the building. Gave me the feeling of being in a prison, and also ruining the view of a lovely park across the street. The room once contained a minibar, but instead of replacing it with a fridge, they sealed the cabinet shut! The bathtub is an older design, steep narrow sides, no shower curtain, and tall. If I has less mobile, it would have been impossible to use. Also the glass plate still didn't keep water from getting all over the bathroom floor.",3,2018,03,18
240,Nice hotel,"This hotel was our first stop and meeting point for a globus tour. We arrived at 6am from our overseas flight. The overnight desk man told us they were fully booked and no availability for an early check in. He offered to store our luggage so we could walk around. Being still dark we decided to wait in the lobby. A young lady started at 7am saw us and asked if we wanted to check in. Saying of course, we quickly went to our room for a nap. Dinner at the hotel was very good. Sights and stores within walking distance. 
The hotel is very nice , clean and we had an overall pleasant experience there.",5,2018,03,17
240,Courteous and professional staff,"Stayed overnight for a special occasion. Check in was quick and efficient; perhaps could have been friendlier. However our room was very nice. On the fifth floor with views over Dublin. Had lunch in the bar. Food very tasty and served by a very courteous and professional waiter. We were very impressed with all the waiting staff in the hotel from the bar to the restaurant. They were a credit to the hotel. We liked the location, with Kilmainham jail and the Museum of Modern art right on the doorstep.
Checkout was again quick and efficient. We usually stay in a Hilton when we travel and this hotel compares very favourably with others we have been to. Will definitely pay a return visit.
",4,2018,03,15
240,Fulfilled my expectations,"I can say that this hotel fulfilled my expectations, more than enough. Some say location isn't good but I wouldn't agree. Well-mannered staff in all occasions, and rooms which are really stylish - breakfast complete and nicely served. My only regret is that I haven't had the chance (time) to visit the spa area",5,2018,03,14
240,Very comfortable stay,"Very comfy and quiet room.  Breakfast great - lots of choice and good quality.  All staff very friendly.  25 mins from airport, 15-20 mins in taxi to central Dublin.  Gaol, museum of arts and a great Irish pub right on the doorstep. ",4,2018,03,14
240,Comfortable stay,"Had two rooms on a busy Saturday night. Check in was efficient with buffet breakfast. Didn‚Äôt get a chance to use any other facilities as it was a quick visit. Check out was busier but still very courteous. Nice hotel with modern look. Like all hotels in Dublin, Saturday night is very expensive for families.",4,2018,03,13
240,Very friendly staff and great environment,I have been visiting this place weekly for almost a year now. Staff are always very friendly and helpful - especially Dawid. They recognize me and know what coffee I always get. The environment is great.,5,2018,03,11
240,Great for business traveleres,"Spent three nights at the Dublin Kilmainham. While it is close to a couple of attractions like the Kilmainham Gaol and it's about a 20 minute walk to the Guinness Storehouse, it is not as conveniently located to experience all of Dublin has to offer near city center if you want to only walk.

 That said for my purposes (traveling there for business) it was a great location. The rooms were well appointed and the bed was very comfortable. The breakfast buffet had good variety although there was no change in the menu day by day so after a couple of times it became a bit too much of the same. One of the big perks of staying here is the use of the Living Well sports club complete with sauna, steam, and pool. There are only a couple of restaurants within walking distance so ended up eating at the Broyage bistro inside the hotel a couple of times, and overall the food was good.

Service was excellent. Our group was there during the recent ""Beast from the East"" winter storm so unfortunately our plans had to change and we needed to depart early. Staff was very helpful in allowing us to check out past the cancellation window and also helping us with getting a taxi to the airport when most of Dublin had shut down. 
For business trips this is highly recommended. If you find a good rate it's definitely a good option for tourists.",5,2018,03,07
240,Great base for lovely weekend stay,"We could not fault our stay in this hotel the staff were very polite, friendly and nothing was too much trouble for them.

 It is located opposite Kilmainham Gaol (pre-book the tour. recommended) and overlooks the Gardens at the Royal Hospital Kilmainham Hospital. The Guiness Store house is close by (a 1.7km 20 mins walk). It is a about 30 to 40 minute walk to Temple bar area but the bus route and stops are close by. We used the tram to the city center (recomended) the nearest stop is a 7 minute walk from the Hotel. The staff at reception were happy to give you information and a free tourist street map.  

We flew in on an early Friday morning flight with Ryanair and used their taxi transfer (32Euro pre-booked) to the hotel. We arrived at the Hilton Kilmainham about 10am expecting only to to be able to drop our bags off to be told that if we were prepared to change our room choice they would be able to check us in early. We relaxed in the lounge area of the foyer for a while and were given updates on when our room would be ready. We could see after we arrived they got very busy with a couple of large parties also checking in early. We retired to the Broyage Bar & Bistro where one of the staff kindly rustled us up some brunch even though they were not actually open. The receptionist kindly delivered our room keys to us in the bar. 

We were given a free upgrade to a large room on the 4th floor with a balcony  overlooking the Hospital Gardens across the road. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom had a separate bath and shower. All the amenities and extras you would expect in a suite were there (robes, coffee machine, decent size TV).  Also in the room was a complimentary bottle of wine, box of chocolates and a Birthday card for my wife from the hotel.

We had breakfast (plenty of choice) in the hotel on one occasion and brunch in the Bistro bar twice. My only criticism was the bland tasteless sausages served in the breakfast room but the staff were great and did their best to cater for all tastes.

There is a well equipped Gym, sauna, steam room, and jaccuzzi. The pool is more of a spa and not big or deep enough for any serious exercise swimming but is a pleasant area to relax in after a workout in the gym. 

We had a lovely 3 day 2 night stay with an early check in and late check out (subject to availability) taking in all the major tourist sites as a birthday treat for my wife. The Hotel and the staff did not disappoint and made it a very memorable stay.
  
Overall if you want a first rate hotel away from some of the more lively areas of the city center but close enough to some of the major attractions then this is the place for you. If we visited Dublin again we would definitely stay here.",5,2018,03,06
240,Great stay,Lovely hotel.  Rooms are excellent with floor to ceiling windows giving nice views.  Bar food and breakfast very good with very helpful friendly staff.  Walking distance to Phoenix Park and zoo and right beside Goal.  Even though it is a little outside Dublin it is definitely worth staying at the Hilton.  Very enjoyable stay.,5,2018,03,03
240,Stayed for Wales vs Ireland 6 nations rugby,"After a long wait to check in (caused by failure of an on-line booking company failing to pass on details of our reservation made 10 months before), we were finally allocated our rooms at the same rate as reserved with breakfast included. 
One of our rooms had a fantastic view the other was at the back. The rooms were in excellent condition and cleanliness was superb. Tea and coffee facilities were good but the mini fridge had been removed. (Not a problem in winter but would be better if replaced.)
We did not test out the spa area as we were limited for time. The breakfast was very extensive with plenty of choice and waiter served options from the menu, only gripe was that the beautiful back bacon was overcooked and that made good bacon almost in-edible.
All the staff were very friendly and helpful and the hotels position near an Irish pub to watch other matches and eat in the evening. All together we enjoyed our stay and would definitely return.",5,2018,03,01
240,"Pleasant hotel, convenient location, expensive parking","A good hotel outside Dublin city centre (about 30 minutes walk to the cathedrals). Service was extremely friendly (especially at Reception) and the food was pretty good, too (although I'm not convinced that the organge juice served at breakfast was fresh). I particularly liked the warm ambience of the bar and the range of ales on draught.  The spa is OK but small.12 euros per night for parking in the undergound car park seems a bit steep to me (there isn't an alternative, so they've got you cornered) and our bill was incorrect when first presented (this was swiftly rectified when questioned but you need to spot it, of course). The hotel is next to the Kilmainham Jail which is well worth a visit if you have the time (and is free to English Heritage members).",4,2018,02,24
240,Great Location,"The hotel was clean and comfortable.  What stands out is the location and the ""free"" breakfast.  The hotel is on the Dublin Tour Bus route and right across the street from the Gaol (a must see attraction.). It is also across the street from the Patriot's Inn--a wonderful pub.

I'd stay here again if in Dublin.

We so appreciate the GF options for breakfast.",4,2018,02,23
240,modern hotel,"nice clean modern hotel room, big tv, every thing worked. 
 just off the main drag / away from the town center. but handy for the Guinness brewery (did not get there is this) . in & out on a bussiness trip . 

just needed usb chage points in the room at it would be perfect",4,2018,02,22
240,Fantastic experience,"The staff from top to bottom are always awesome and take a lot of pride in their work. You really do like family there. I stay there often and will continue to do so. Business travel can feel long sometimes, but they make it worth it. ",5,2018,02,21
240,Best experience I've ever had!,"5 star treatment! And definately abobe most 4 stars I have ever been to. Location nice and quite, 10 minute walk from train station perhaps wouldn't advise in the dark alone but perfect for our times. I booked the King room, not deluxe etc yet we were given a room beyond words. 124. The bathroom and everywhere tastefully drsigned, spotless clean, duck feathered duvet anf pillows, materess fantastic, excellent tea/coffee and facilities for business and little perks such as ballygown water still and aparkling. Room service more swift than 30mins we were told! ‚Ç¨5.50 I much peregered eating and drinking in the room (we had fantastic cocktails downstairs but room next time), a girl was cleaning and joking qith ither staff members and counting the tips from bags on the counter and calling out to lets count tips to the others, about 11.45pm but still it took from the professionalism and truly the staff on reception and food delievery were so friendly and thorough! Amazing! The spa and pool was to die for and fresh clean towels, nice body lotions and power showers the list goes on this hitel is just simply brilliant! I could say more but I would be up all night. Amazing experience will return and usually I like to experience more but why fix whats not broken!",5,2018,02,19
240,Trip for 30th birthday,"I emailed ahead of our visit to inform them we were coming for my partners 30th birthday and asked if there was anything they could do to mark the occasion. Ana emailed back and arranged a complimentary room upgrade as well as coupons for the bar, birthday card and chocolate. This was an amazing start to the stay. Ana and the reception team were attentive, polite and friendly. Nothing was too much for them. They allowed us to check in early and gave great tips about things to do during the stay. Our room was an executive suite, slightly dated however very large and with great views and a balcony. The shower temperatures varied which was slightly annoying but we used the spa showers mostly. The was a leak in our shower but only small. The spa itself was nice, mostly clean and with a sauna and steam room. The jacuzzi wasn't working on one of the days we visited but it was being repaired as we were there. Would also have benefitted from swimsuit dryers in the changing rooms. 
The bar was really smart and drinks were reasonably priced. Breakfast was delicious with so much choice, all really clean and good quality. We didn't need lunch as we ate so much at breakfast- saving us money!! 
The location is slightly out of town but with unlimited bus travel with the DoDublin card and bus stops nearby this wasn't an issue. 
I had read somewhere that the Hilton Garden Inn offers a shuttle between the hotel and airport which I feel this hotel could benefit from but I am not 100% sure that is the case. However it would be really helpful as we had to ask how to get to the hotel, luckily I don't mind asking for directions!
Overall an amazing stay with brilliant staff and good amenities. Would definitely stay again!",4,2018,02,18
240,Yummy lunch,"Had a business meeting here yesterday. Lovely food, coronation chicken in a bun with greens and a popadum. However we were due to get chips and the waitress apologised and gave up two coffees on the house. Great meeting place and good food.",5,2018,02,10
240,Weekend Trip to Irleand,"Stayed here for 3 nights. Picked a Hilton for reputation only. Bar staff were rude and bar closed at 12 am. Could not get food or drinks after that time. Restaurant did not open on time, could not get coffee or tea for free during the day. Front desk staff very helpful and polite. Would not stay here again.",3,2018,02,07
240,Very friendly,Very comfortable stay in this hotel that is a little outside of the centre but within easy reach of all the main attractions. We were made to feel very welcome by the staff and enjoyed a very relaxing 4 nights. To add to the relaxation is a very smart hydrotherapy pool with a sauna and steam room.,5,2018,02,06
240,Booked for the low price - stayed for the lush spa!,"Visiting Dublin just for the day, I was hoping for a peaceful hotel to come back to after a busy day and Hilton Kilmainham did not disappoint. Staff were very helpful and speedy on arrival, and the room itself was very large and bright with a lovely view over the park. We had a kingsize room and the bed itself was one of the comfiest I've slept in for a long while - as were the pillows - so we slept like babies. Breakfast was also very tasty and lots of options.
But the spa was a real winner for me. At the same price as this hotel, we could have stayed slightly closer to the city but no chance anywhere else has such a nice peaceful spa on offer for the cost - we used it twice in 24 hours and was a really relaxing way to end/begin the day! Only downside was you had to wear a swimming cap which was not mentioned before booking or at check-in - they sell them for ‚Ç¨2 but of course we didn't have that with us when we popped down from the room!",5,2018,01,31
240,We had a lovely stay,"We were in Dublin for a long weekend and we really liked the property. The staff is professional, smiling, always willing to give advice and to help. The bedroom is large, clean, and the bed (matress) is ultra comfortable. We had the breakfast there, it offers a large variety of cereals, fruits, vegetables, etc. and you can order poched eggs, omelettes or/and pancakes which are all included in the price. We also had dinner at the restaurant ""Broyage"" and we particularly loved the burger which is huge and really good. They have a swimming pool, steam bath and sauna which is free for the guests. I would definitely recommend this hotel for family or couple though it is a bit far from the city centre of Dublin (40 min walking - 15 min taxi)",5,2018,01,31
240,Lovely stay,"Room - I tended to steer clear of Hilton‚Äôs as in the past I found the rooms to be quite small, not the case with Hilton Kilmainham. The Room was large and well appointed, the bathroom was adequate. Our room 417 was on the 4th floor but unfortunately the view was across to other buildings. The room was quiet and the bed comfortable.
Amenities- Iron and ironing board and a hairdryer. Fridge available however it was not stocked. Whilst we didn‚Äôt use the gym or pool (as we ran out of time) we took a look and it was well organised and being well used by other hotel guests.
Location- While the hotel is located about 10 mins out from the city there are busses and trams nearby to take you wherever you need to go and taxis pass by regularly. The hotel is located directly opposite the Kilmainham Gaol which is a must see. 
Food - Plenty of delicious choices for breakfast in addition to the buffet there is a made to order service available serving pancakes, poached eggs omelette etc. we also tried the bistro for a late dinner and the food was fresh, tasty and well priced. Staff - All the staff we came into contact with were friendly, efficient and helpful. Renate at reception was excellent she helped us to organise tours, maps etc and made some excellent suggestions for while we were in Dublin. 
",4,2018,01,26
240,Top Notch,"The location is great, the rooms are big and spacious, the staff is helpful and friendly. You really get your money's worth and you absolutely cannot beat the location. Everything is within walking distance.",4,2018,01,25
240,Great stay,"I stayed here during a business trip for over 2 weeks. It was really a great experience, great service great rooms and really good breakfast and restaurant. The Hotel is not directly in the city center located but quiet near to the Guiness brewery and Kilmainham jail. Nevertheless the city center is reachable in less than 10 min via taxi. Overall great hotel definitely I will book it again. ",5,2018,01,23
240,Enjoyed our stay,"Spacious, bright, modern room. Lovely, big, cosy bed. Tv in room had a good selection of channels. Free wifi was good. Would recommend the Italian restaurant across the road called dolce vita above the Patriots pub. Food in the pub is really good too! Restaurant in the Hilton is a bit pricey but very good. ",4,2018,01,22
240,Very clean and comfortable hotel,"Stayed in this hotel with our teem kids pre Christmas. Very comfortable and clean rooms. No noise to disturb us at night. Wonderful breakfast with a vast choice of food. Very convenient location for the Kilmainham gaol and museum of modern art. Too far to walk into the town centre and temple bar district, but just a 10min walk to the tram stop and the tram took us into town.",5,2018,01,22
240,Nice hotel outside main tourist area,"The Hilton is directly across the street from the Kilmainham Gaol (a major tourist attraction) and the modern art museum (in a former hospital). The hotel was modern and clean, and the bar was great. The staff were friendly and helpful. Highly recommended.",5,2018,01,21
240,Really Lovely Stay,We stayed here for 2 nights and thoroughly enjoyed it. The service really is exceptional and 'real' without being intrusive. The hotel itself is in very good order and finished to a high standard with all areas nicely furnished and decorated. Check in and check out was effcient. The breakfast was of high quality with plenty of choice. I would definitely usebthis hotel again when staying in Dublin.,5,2018,01,21
240,Perfect stay,"We spent three nights there. The staff is friendly and helpful. The breakfast was good -  perfect Hilton breakfast. The location was good, near the famous prison. The only sightseeng which we didn't have time to go to see. Easy to get to the airport. Highly recommended.",5,2018,01,19
240,Great Expereience,"My wife and I stayed at the Hilton Dublin Kilmainham in mid-January and had a fantastic experience.  From check-in to check-out the hotel personnel were fabulous to deal with.  The hotel was clean, convenient to public transportation, and quiet at night.  The breakfast was delicious and had a tremendous number of options from which to choose.  We would definitely stay here again!",5,2018,01,18
240,Terrible customer service!!!!!,"Stayed in this hotel on Saturday 9th December with my partner and 4 month old son. As we stayed here once in the past we thought we would stay again for our first holiday as a family which was highly anticipated since we booked it. 

Checked in Saturday everything was smooth, good spacious room on 4/5 floor and provided our requests which was fantastic for our first holiday together. 

Now for the downfall, after paying a lot of money for one night stay, on Sunday morning my partner was feeding the baby (expressing herself) around 10am after breakfast and a member of accommodation staff decided to walk into our room without knocking our gaining our attention in any way. She quickly left the room when she realised the mistake she had made.

 From this moment on we were appalled and made a complaint on checkout with the  manager on shift. The manager notified us 'he will have a chat with them' and didn't seem to take the complaint with any seriousness.

For a Hilton hotel to deal with such a serious complaint in a terrible way and with no reply, token of good will to our complaint is pathetic. I would highly recommend management to reassess their complaints procedure!

We had hoped to associate the Hilton hotel as a place we could return with our Son in years to come has be knocked. I would highly recommend people to avoid Hilton hotels at all cost so you wont leave disappointed like we did!

Only pro are the breakfast staff are lovely and took time out to interact with us and our son.

Please feel free to contact me by email ptryanoconnor24@gmail.com.

Ryan",1,2018,01,17
240,Relax,"We stayed for a night, the room was very spacious and clean ,3 floor,at the reception we meet Renata ( thank you) very professional and helpful. We had a great experience at the bar with Sunil the manager, was closing time and he did stayed to prepare himself the drinks for us ! Many thanks and I totally recommend this hotel for a day to relax at the swimming pool, jacuzzi, steam room and sauna. ",5,2018,01,13
240,Pleasant stay,Professional staff. Clean hotel. Friendly atmosphere. Decent food. Good sized room on floor 5. Impressed that when we arrived on an early morning flight well before check in time a room was immediately made available. Reception efficient and welcoming. Bar area relaxing and spacious.,5,2018,01,11
240,Lovely break,"First time at the Hilton, Kilmainham, and it is a lovely hotel. All the staff I met were really friendly and professional.
The breakfast selection was very good and very well presented.
Loved the detox water at reception.
The leisure area is so relaxing and at a perfect temperature.
Bathroom a little small and paying for parking the only downside.
A visit to Kilmainham Jail next door is a must.",4,2018,01,10
240,Great Location.... Great Accomodations,"We spent New year's eve in Dublin and stayed at Hilton Kilmainham. It was a good experience. The Hotel is across the Street from Dublin's Gaul (one of the city's historical highlights) with very good accommodations, garage, etc. A good Experience",5,2018,01,09
240,Unexpectedly great location,Really reliably good accommodation outside of city centre.  Across the road from Kilmainham Gaol which should be on everyone's list of must see historical sites.  Rooms really clean and comfortable.  Parking available and convenient.  Breakfast is great and staff friendly.  Thoroughly enjoyed staying here.  About 10 mins bus public bus ride from city centre.  Plenty of buses.  Would have scored a 5 if the shower had been better.  Shower over bath too narrow.  Would be better to just have a shower stall as bathrooms fairly small.    But still it was fine...,4,2018,01,07
240,My go-to hotel in Dublin,I love this hotel and location. Set off a bit from the busy streets in Dublin but right next to key points of interest. There is even a hop-on hop-off point right outside ( great way to inexpensively get around Dublin). Has always met Hilton standards on each stay ( 6 at this point). Clean and well maintained. Comfortable beds. Staff is great and always helpful. Nice choices for breakfast. ,5,2018,01,06
240,Great stay again!,We had a lovely stay again this time we took my daughter for her 21st birthday. Staff made sure it was special for her. We love the breakfast and the pool was fab with our youngest. We will be back  üòä,5,2018,01,05
240,Very Nice,"The hotel is very nice and the staff is very friendly and helpful.  The room was very clean and comfortable. The elevator had a very large dead bug that had been stepped on.  It was there for at least an hour.  The hall way had a musty smell but overall, I would definitely stay there again.",4,2018,01,05
240,Hilton Kilmainham,Stayed at this hotel as part of a wedding package - an excellent stay in every way from arrival to departure.  Breakfast was excellent and the full Irish and the level of service what you would expect from a Hilton at this price point.  Highly recommended.,5,2018,01,05
240,"Very good, but things get lackadaisical at night","Can't recall my room number but I think we were third floor, around to the left after going up stairs/elevator. Rooms were quiet and we got very good rest. We planned a daunting trip of daily flights to Scotland, England and Italy so we were back late each night and up early each morning. First things first:

Bus is fairly convenient, leaving every hour for the airport (and half hour for the hotel). But ... he will leave 5 minutes early once in a blue moon and leave you stranded if you're not down their early. It happened to us on the last day and I was a little perturbed. As a consequence, we took a taxi which was also very expedient and actually cheaper. ***So the bus isn't as convenient as it might seem. Note: the hotel's bus system is to give you a little ticket in the morning for the trip and/or return and you have to hold onto that tiny ticket all day. Pretty archaic system and one of our days I lost the ticket in the pile of receipts that I had amassed. 

As I already mentioned, we returned late each night, eager to lay our heads. The staff locks the turnstyle door and the only entrance is from a side exit. When we returned one night, the staff was nowhere to be found so we spent a few minutes banging/ringing, trying to get in before a few guys came walking from around the back side of the bar. Don't know what they were doing, but they definitely weren't watching for guests who needed to enter while it was 30 degrees and raining.",4,2018,01,03
240,Great start to the New Year ,"Have just returned from a 2 night stay and enjoyed every minute of it - beautiful hotel in great location.  Booked in April 2016 for an extra Christmas present for my girls and decided to book for New Year‚Äôs Eve to make it a bit special.  Staff are great and very accommodating.   Rang  in 2018 in the bar with complimentary drink which was lovely and spent New Year‚Äôs Day at the Zoo which was a 10 minute walk away and returned to the hotel to make use of the swimming pool, jacuzzi, steam room and sauna.  Room was very comfortable with a massive bed and the breakfast catered for everyone.  I would recommend this hotel to others will definitely return for another stay.  ",5,2018,01,02
240,great stay!,"Wonderful stay- albeit too short- at this hotel just on the outskirts of the city central. Easy walk from the main bus station. Staff was superb, from the welcoming front desk staff to the bartenders and restaurant staff. We arrived hours early for check-in and were quickly accomodated and made to feel most welcome, even offered help in making change for the bus into the city center. Comfortable beds, great water pressure in showers. Breakfast on Christmas Eve morning was teriffic and far superior to most hotel food ( my family is still raving about it!). We look forward to our return! ",5,2017,12,31
240,Top notch!,"Excellent customer service with professional staff. I have stayed at other hotels around Dublin and this one is the best so far. 
The whole hotel was clean from the entrance to the room and restaurant!",5,2017,12,25
240,"Amazing Stay, Amazing people,  Amazing Place","After a long journey I got greeted by the front desk. The staff was very friendly, from the reception to restaurant/breakfast, housekeeping and spa. I felt valued as a Gold Member from the Hhonors program.
The room was very nice and bed very comfortable.
Wifi was working perfectly and the spa facilities was what I needed after a long day discovering Dublin. 
Will definitely be back",5,2017,12,24
240,Great hotel,The staff were able to facilitate my stay at short notice. Central location and top quality wi-fi meant I was able to conduct all my business.Great work by Ana and the team. Would definitely recommend.,5,2017,12,22
240,So accommodating to US arrivals,"We arrived at 8am after a long US flight - and asked if they had early check in - she asked for about 15 minutes and we were in - we got breakfast and then off to bed ...what amazing customer service. 
We had some drinks at the bar after lunch - and met Nikita - who charmed us.
Next morning we overslept - still struggling with time change - and came down with three minutes to spare for breakfast - Nikita was there and welcomed us as if we were hours early .... delayed clearing the buffet even though it was their Christmas lunch setup.
Such unbelievable customer service is rare and from the friendly and welcoming receptionist to the gentlemen who helped us with bags to the lovely Nikita - we were extremely impressed.  Both local management and Hilton should be so proud!",5,2017,12,21
240,Jill,"Had a great time. Hilton is always great   It was a bit out of town but on the bus route for the green tour. The room was fab and the food was also good ..There was also a little Italian restaurant across the road and a bar 
",5,2017,12,20
240,Not convenient for tourists,The hotel was nice and the staff wonderful.  The room was quiet and the beds comfortable. This would be a five star review except for one issue:  the location. We were in Dublin for two nights and I would not recommend this hotel if you are a tourist. It is about a 20 minute walk to Guinness and everything else is much further away. The cab fare to the airport was double what was advertised. I am baffled by some of the other reviews that say ‚Äúgreat location‚Äù because we had the opposite experience. ,4,2017,12,13
240,Amazing ,"Our second visit to this wonderful hotel and yet again it did not disappoint. My partner just proposed the morning of our arrival and we were greeted at reception by the wonderful Claudia. Claudia was genuinely delighted for us both and upgraded our room, and was so kind to bring a bottle of prosecco and a beautiful card to our room. This gesture made our weekend so much more special. So thank you Claudia and management at Hilton Kilmainham, we truly had a wonderful weekend. ",5,2017,12,10
240,Very enjoyable experience ,My husband and I stayed one night in this hotel - staff very friendly & helpful. I have a particular dislike for deep fat fried sausages for breakfast and asked if possible to have a grilled sausage- this was not a problem and we were given three beautifully grilled sausages each . Breakfast had excellent choice and well worth extra 15 euro ,4,2017,12,10
240,My business stay in Dublin,"Good location, quite place, not so far from center city, ideal for morning morning jogging, friendly staff, possibily to car parking, rich breakfast, pleasant evening seating, the opportunity to visit a nearby park and historic building serving as a jail, not far from the Welington Memorial",4,2017,12,10
240,Great Hotel close to Dublin City centre,"Stayed in an interconnecting room with family in Dec 17.  Hotel is lovely, staff are all friendly and v helpful.  We only ate breakfast in the hotel but it was really good with some breakfast items made to order.  Beds are very comfy, we had interconnecting rooms with twin beds in one room and a generous double in the other.  Rooms are clean and well decorated.  Parking available at hotel for E12 per night.",4,2017,12,10
240,Good business visitor hotel,"Booked this hotel because it was hard to get accommodation in centre of Dublin. Nice location and easy to get there. Easy to get into centre by taxi
Hard to get taxi at hotel by ordering though. We gave up and hailed one outside. Breakfast fine. Rooms clean and comfortable. ",5,2017,12,06
240,"Great location, friendly staff- highly recommend ","When i fly in and out of Dublin regularly, i generally stay out at the airport because it‚Äôs handy. I would consider changing that just to have the opportunity to stay in this hotel every now and again as a treat to myself! The rooms are great, spotless, super comfy beds , lovely showers. 
Facilities available are top. A fully fitted gym with everything you could possibly need and it‚Äôs not packed or super busy. Laundry service ( i used to have a dress ironed for a wedding- very efficient) Breakfast is really good. Full irish fry and everything else you could want . If it‚Äôs not there the staff will organise it.
The staff are so helpful and friendly all round from reception to housekeeping to the restaurant.
I had dinner both nights in the restaurant / bar. Despite christmas parties and business booming the service was great, food excellent , cocktails top class.. I spent the weekend in the hotel as part of a wedding party. It was brilliant. I will be back . ",5,2017,12,05
240,Visiting Dublin to celebrate an early Christmas with family.,We arrived late in the evening and were checked in efficiently.  Our trip happened to coincide with my son‚Äôs 14th birthday. Upon entering our room he found a chocolate brownie with a birthday greeting just for him. The room had a wonderful city view both night and day.  The beds were comfortable and the room itself was spotless as was the bathroom. ,5,2017,12,04
240,Nice location and friendly staff,"Good location near the Guinness factory and canal and to the M50 motorway.
Great members of staff, very friendly, welcoming and speak a multitude of languages.
The food is also normally good, breakfast is also good and of course so is the Guinness!",5,2017,12,02
240,Decent Hotel in a Superb Location ,"I stayed at the hotel for two nights on business. The rooms and amenities are decent - nothing spectacular - but they are clean, spacious and comfortable. 

The WiFi is very strong and available all over the hotel. The breakfast 15 Euros and is a really nice buffet (it's worth the cost). There is instant coffee and tea available in the room, as well as a clothes iron and a hairdryer. 

The location is superb. The Modern Art Museum and Gaol are right across the street. There is a hop-on / hop-off bus tour stop right across from the hotel as well. This makes sightseeing and getting downtown very easy and convenient.  

Overall, I had a nice stay and would stay here again. ",4,2017,12,01
240,Bad experience at Broyard Bistro; hotel room keys constantly dysfunctional,"This is a Hilton, so generally there were no good or bad surprises. But every time we have tried to return to our room, the electronic keys have gone bad. They were not in my pocket next to my phone, just in my wallet (where I always keep such keys; and I travel a lot). But apparently there is something wrong with the Hilton's equipment and even keeping the key in a wallet renders it unusable. Today I'll store the key in my shirt pocket to see if that works, but this is inconvenient and the Hilton management should figure out what their problem is and fix it.

We had a very disappointing meal at the Broyard Bistro in the lobby.  The kitchen was very slow, and the simple meal took nearly an hour to arrive. I ordered a burger, rare, and the waitress didn't tell me that in Ireland it is not legal to serve any burger except if it is cooked to ""well done."" I suppose they have trouble assuring the safety of ground beef here. In any case, for me the overcooked burger was barely edible (obviously it is the last one I'll have in Ireland). To his credit, the manager took 50% off the price (fair, I guess since I could only manage to eat half the unappetizing burger), but we won't bother with this restaurant again--there are other good choices nearby. I would have put this review on the bistro page, but I couldn't find one.",2,2017,11,29
240,Very enjoyable stay,"I really enjoyed my stay at the Hilton in Kilmainham in Dublin. The staff were very friendly. The bedroom had a lovely view onto the grounds of Kilmainham Hospital. The beds were very comfortable and the room spotless! The hotel is very well situated , beside KIlmainham jail and within easy reach of the city by bus.",5,2017,11,28
240,Good location and pool facilities but  spoiled by noise.,"We had an otherwise excellent King room on 5th floor  near elevator and what seemed the extraction system for the kitchen ( ?)  . Constant low  frequency noise, which we initially were told was from kitchen and would stop at 10pm but did not. A second manager was supposed to call us back but never did.
Rather spoilt the excellent location for Kilmainham, War memorial, Phoenix Park and Luas Red line.
 A nice jacuzzi. sauna and small pool with 'bubbles' was excellent and bar and staff very friendly.
On check out, our parking was validated by means of compensation, which was satisfactory.",3,2017,11,27
240,Things I Wish I Knew...,"Things I wish I knew before I stayed at Hilton Dublin Kilmainham. 1. It is next door to the Kilmainham Gaol. Being from the States I did not understand the importance of this jail until we checked in, but by the the tours were full. 2. It is next door to the Irish Museum of Modern Art. Plus it is within a 10 minute walk of a lot of parks and memorials. 3. Because of its location, both of the main Hop On Hop Off tours stop right across the street from the hotel. We took a 15 euro cab downtown to catch on of these buses - imagine our surprise when it stopped next to our hotel. It did save us a cab trip back. Typical Hilton quality with a great location. Just wish I had done a little more homework before I visited - that was my bad. ",5,2017,11,27
240,Simply very helpful,"I will declare up from I‚Äôve not actually slept in this hotel, however I was visiting the Kilmainham Gaol and needed coffee - the Hilton did a couple of takeaway cups (good tip there).

More helpful - I needed to print off some bus tickets and the staff obliged.

Very grateful - good people. ",4,2017,11,25
240,"Not your average ""chain"" hotel","When my husband chose this hotel after plotting our stay in Dublin (the Gaol was to be our last stop before departing for the airport, and it's right across the street), I was prepared to be disappointed. I was hoping for a charming period hotel or B&B, but the Hilton Kilmainham turned out to be a great base for us. We spent one day in Dublin, then left for Kerry; after one night and a day in Kerry, we returned to the Hilton. Storing our luggage? No problem.
The rooms aren't huge, but they are comfortable, modern, and clean with a comfy bed and luxurious bath. We were on the third floor, but had no problem with noise.
What's priceless about this hotel is its service and staff. Staff were able to direct us to the city bus (although if you want the hop on/off tour buses, three lines stop right across the street), a short walk away, and provide change. They also helped us with suggestions on places to visit and eat, as well as the closest location to pick up snacks for the room.
We were worried that we wouldn't make it to the airport without a LONG walk with luggage as the Dublin Marathon was on our last day (and ran right past the hotel), but Ana was able to arrange a cab close to the hotel at the exact time we needed to leave. This wasn't an easy feat given all the street closures and rerouting for the marathon.

All in all, a good place to stay if you don't want to be right in the center of the city and closer to the Gaol and Guinness Storehouse.",4,2017,11,24
240,All you can ask for in Dublin,"The hotel is an excellent place to stay for seeing Dublin.  Parking is right there, the hop-on hop-off bus is right outside the lobby and it's a walk to the Guiness Storehouse.  The staff are excellent and the amenities are exactly as expected from Hilton.  It's a great place in every respect.",5,2017,11,21
240,My last stay in Dublin,A welcoming place where even a week end of work becomes a pleasure. To consider when visiting dublin! I was there for a business meeting but I could appreciate the warm and professional service. Just a problema: jym open 8AM on sundays: too late!,5,2017,11,19
240,Issues resolved professionally,"My husband and I stayed for just one night, room only, to attend a wedding in Dublin. The room was comfortable, spacious and spotless, everything I expect from a Hilton. We did have an issue with noise in our room during the night. This was investigated thoroughly but unfortunately could not be resolved - however, the next morning our complaint was handled in a superbly professional manner by the manager and we left extremely happy with the outcome. Despite the problem I would absolutely stay here again - probably one of the most comfortable beds I‚Äôve ever slept in! ",4,2017,11,18
240,Stay in Dublin,"This Hilton in Dublin is a clean & new hotel, close to the Kilmainham museum. Staff are very friendly & helpful. I have stayed there many times in the past. Not close to city centre but situated in Dublin 8 area. Good pool & fitness centre but made to purchase a hat to use the pool, which I had never heard of before.",4,2017,11,16
240,a real surprise,"this is a great hotel. Really modern, rooms are great, lobby, bar are great. the buffet breakfast is really fantastic and made better with really friendly cheery staff. A real surprise and a great surprise. I would highly recommend it",5,2017,11,14
240,:),"Very nice stay, cozy room with a nice view. Bus stop 4 minutes on foot from the hotel, and you‚Äôre in town in 15 minutes. Across the hotel there are many sightseeing points such as Kilmainham Gaol and the Modern Art museum. We had dinner in bar and service was amazing. Renata at front desk very helpful with recommendations. 
We will come back again!",5,2017,11,14
240,Very happy customer!!!,From pre-Arrival correspondence to my departure I was not made to feel like just another booking. The level of listening and making sure your request is addressed was truly impressive. I would highly recommend the Hotel.,5,2017,11,12
240,Great hotel!,"Very comfortable room in a very nice, modern hotel.  Location is a bit removed from central Dublin, but the prices reflect this.  There are several bus routes to central Dublin within a 5- minute walk if the hotel, and service is frequent.  The Temple Bar area takes 15-20 minutes to reach by bus.  There's a great convenience store in a petrol station just a 2-minute walk from the lobby that seems to sell everything.

Hotel bar area is very nice and serves good food.  The restaurant's breakfast buffet is very good.

All hotel staff were excellent.  I'd recommend the hotel highly.",5,2017,11,12
240,"Quieter and very comfortable alternative to inner Dublin, yet close enough to the city","Fastest and most reliable highspeed wifi I've ever encountered in any hotel.  Standard room was spacious with windows that open partially.  Very comfortable beds, excellent housekeeping, prompt and helpful staff for checkin, cabs and wake up calls & checkout.  Will return in Spring 2018 to this hotel.  Heuston station is a 22-minute walk through the adjacent Royal Hospital grounds and (left) north along Military Rd., when open - as the grounds gates are closed each evening and Sunday until noon.  Otherwise, or in rain, a cab is advisable to Heuston for EU6-9. 
The 40 or 13 bus is available along Emmet Rd to inner Dublin.  I alighted the No. 40 at Lord Edward stop just east of Christ Church Cathedral for a sightseeing day.",5,2017,11,11
240,First time in dublin ,"Me and my husband stayed in dublin for 3 nights and it was amazing. We stayed at the Hilton which is about 10 min walk from suir road tram. We arrived at 8.30 in the morning. I emailed the hotel a couple of nights before to see of they could get us a room earlier than 3pm. They gave us a room straight away so we could have nap and get over a early flight.  Our first night we stayed in room 116 but we had a few issues with the hairdryer and hot water. We spoke to Claudia on reception and she was lovely she moved us room to 420 as the hot water was broken and it was just running hot water and no cold water. She upgraded our room to business suite free of charge and gave us some free drink vouchers for the bar. Claudia has really good customer service and she was brilliant. We had breakfast in the hotel every morning it was buffet with a lovely spread of food. We also had dinner in the cinnamon bar it was great the specials were lovely. The staff were very helpful and friendly. The hotel has a swimming pool which had a hydrotheeapy pool, Jacuzzi, steam room and sauna. The only downside was in the pool we had to wear swimming caps. Thank you for a lovely stay ",5,2017,11,06
240,Excellent hotel ,"Highly recommend this hotel, quiet enough without being too far from city centre. 
Attentive staff, great spa, comfy beds, powerful showers and one of the best hotel breakfasts I've had. 
Only snagging point is couldn't access the wifi. ",5,2017,11,06
240,Great Hilton Hotel,"No complaints at all. Whilst I normally use Hilton for business trips, this time I was travelling with my wife and young son. Everyone was very friendly and helpful, making a special fuss over the kid (especially at breakfast). The hotel is a little way out of town, but it is easy to reach the centre by bus (15 minutes). Directly across the road from the Irish Museum of Modern Art and close by to other attractions. I recommend this hotel.",5,2017,11,02
240,"Great stay , again!!","Our second stay in this hotel ( for the Dublin Marathon), again this year the Hilton didn‚Äôt fail to deliver!!
Good location ( just a short walk to Dublin centre / ample bus & taxi services ) good facilities (my son enjoyed the pool , so did I after the race) , good eats ( enough on menu to please everyone) and  great staff. 
Will be back!
",4,2017,11,02
240,Clean and Modern,"Great hotel for my recent stay in Dublin. The staff was professional. There was a slight problem with my room, and they went above and beyond to correct it and apologize. It's located across the street from Kilmainham Jail and an on/off bus stop. I would definitely stay there again.",4,2017,10,31
240,Hilton Kilmainham,"upon arrival we were greeted very friendly and helful  . Amazing spot, the food was nothing short of Excellent.  We ate in the bar the first nite and could not fault it al all. Breakfast teh folowing morning was one of the best breakfast's that we have had, choice was excellent, service amazing and the food itself was out of this world.  First class.",5,2017,10,31
240,Fantastic hotel,"Our son was in Maynooth studying abroad so we decided to visit. We chose the Hilton because it‚Äôs only 30 min to his College. The check in was fast, the room clean and the food is amazing! The bottom floor has a hydro pool, hot tub, steam room and sauna. Perfect after a long day of exploring. If you are able, have the breast every morning. Delicious! We were able to check in early. Coffee and water are in the room. Huge windows, comfortable bed. If we go back, we‚Äôre staying at the Hilton again",5,2017,10,29
240,Welcoming hotel," The staff in this hotel was fabulous  very welcoming. The hotel breakfast was amazing so much choice very fresh  and the hot food was hot ! The breakfast staff were organised & attentive . The pool was great  very clean, no nasty chlorine smell.  The beds were comfortable and very clean .",5,2017,10,28
240,Customer service,"Check in experience was not good at all. Two customers were served before me and no information was given on facilities in hotel. Booked for one adult and one child, toiletries placed in room for one and no bottled water either. The main computer in reception area was not working either. ",3,2017,10,27
240,Hilton Dublin Kilmainham,A great hotel in a good location. Room was fantastic  the food in the restaurant was also great. We travelled to all the main places in the green open top bus. The boys liked the gym and the hydrotherapy pool ,5,2017,10,27
240,Dublin stay,"We had a great experience at the Hilton Kilmainham.  The staff was helpful, the hotel was clean and the breakfast buffet was great! The location was directly across the street from the jail to sightseeing.  Taxis were easy to get right outside the door.",5,2017,10,25
240,Great hotel.,"Would highly recommend. Short trip from airport and downtown area via taxi. Close to Hueston train station, Guinness tour and Jameson tour. Hop on hop off buses drive by here hourly. Kilmainham jail is right across street. Hotel bar and restaurant were excellent. Not a lot of food options with in 5 minutes walking but tons of taxis outside hotel.",5,2017,10,24
240,Great stay,"Great stay with almost perfect location with good access to the city centre, clean rooms with comfy beds and great service and well presented breakfast with various option to choose from...can highly recommend ",5,2017,10,24
240,Honeymoon to Ireland!,"My husband and i stayed here for the first few nights of our honeymoon. It is located on the outside of Dublin, but close to Guiness Factory and a quick short ride or moderate walk to city center (i suggest a cab via mytaxi for 13-14 euros). The hotel has a very clean pool/hottub, as well as steam and dry saunas that are free for hotel guests. Please keep in mind that you need a swim cap to go into the pool -- they are 2 euros each. The hotel has a restaurant on site -- very good! and a pub across the street. There is a pizza place a block down called four star -- its most like 2 star. Its the equivalent to a really bad dominos order in the US. The staff was courtesy, the room was perfect, and parking is on-site. The gaol is across the street -- literally. and the museum is through the park on the other side -- highly suggest visiting both! We loved this hotel and it was the perfect start to our perfect irish honeymoon!",5,2017,10,23
240,Nice option at a good price just outside the city centre,"I am a Hilton gold member so I have stayed at many Hilton brand hotels over the years.  This hotel is good but not great.  The rooms are pretty basic but a good size.  The mattress was hard as a rock, but the linens were ok.  The value compared to city centre hotels is the reason I bumped it up to a 4 star rating.  You really cannot walk to the city centre, but the hop on hop off bus lines stop right in front of the hotel for the old jail which is a very popular tourist attraction.  A cab is about 15 euro and 10 mins to the city centre so not the most convenient, but still a pretty good location.",4,2017,10,23
240,Great Hotel,Stayed at this hotel before and again a great stay . Staff were fantastic and rooms are great . Had the good nights sleep. Good value for money for location and for Dublin will always stay here when in Dublin ,5,2017,10,22
240,A lovely hotel and the staff are brilliant,"I stay at the Hilton Kilmainham with work all the time. The hotel is well located and gives me all I need from a work perspective. The rooms are nice and the gym is really good. The thing that differentiates it the quality of its people. All very helpful, supportive and can't do enough for you.  Couldn't recommend this hotel more highly.",5,2017,10,21
240,Hilton Kilmainham,"Due to storm oplhilea  extra strain was put on staff as restaurant was only one in area open staff were friendly professional and could not do enough to make every one satisfied,willing to find out any information that was required straight away and ensured taxi requirments were fully met",5,2017,10,20
240,Quality sleep,"Short stay at the Hilton hotel and it lived up to the brand expectations. Upgraded room to top floor, which included a large balcony - fine in summer, but alas not in the driving rain!

Breakfast (15euro when pre-paid at check-in) was good, with an excellent full Irish breakfast - good sausages, plenty of good bacon, black pudding etc. Also god continental brekkie too. Waiter service good and efficient in bringing coffee etc.

Bar/Bistro does reasonably priced fare. Good burger, but I'd have had the batter on the fish n chips a bit more crispy given the choice. Alternatively there is a reasonable pub across the road.

Bed big and comfy, bathroom well appointed, good towels etc, and configured as a wet-room style shower. 

If travelling from the airport go the city centre route (26euro) rather than the motorway (40euro).",4,2017,10,19
240,Wonderful bartender ,"Kalem makes the best and smoothest martini! He was attentive, personable and efficient. 

The manager Hugo was also behind the bar helping and also was friendly and professional. Will definitely visit again!

Thanks Hilton! I ",5,2017,10,19
240,Recommended for a visit to Dublin.,"City Detective here, and am pleased to recommend the Hilton Dublin Kilmainham to any visitors to the city of Dublin looking for excellent and comfortable accommodation.

This was Jane and and I last City break for 2017 and after much research and reading of reviews of fellow Travellers booked this hotel.

We were not disappointed in any respect.
On arrival on the Friday evening, check in was smooth and the front desk team were helpful and knowledgeable explaining everything from what bus and where to get it to travel into town, the facilities of the hotel etc.
As previous reviewers have said the hotel is on the outskirts of the town centre, but the hop on hop off bus stop is right outside the hotel, the local bus service stop is also nearby and the buses are regular and only take 20 minutes into the centre.  There are also taxis nearby.

The location of the hotel ensures you get a great quite nights sleep which as you know from reading my reviews is essential for the ageing City Detective.

The hotel is also next door to the Kilmainham Gaol and Irish Museum of Morden Art which are two attractions Jane and I visited.

We were on the first floor of the hotel with a spacious comfortable room, air conditioning, and everything necessary for a great weekend.

Breakfast was excellent with something to meet everybody's palate and Jane highly commended the coffee at breakfast which always gives a hotel the thumbs up from her.

All the staff we met were friendly and helpful.

We dinned in on our last evening and the evening menu was also good and the selections very tasty.

We have no hesitation in recommending this hotel and staff for your visit to Dublin.

That's my travels finished for this year, so keep on travelling readers and remember the world is there for you to see.

",5,2017,10,17
240,Lunch in Hilton,"A large group arrived for lunch today in the Hilton and they catered for us at short notice.

We had a choice of either beef or chicken burgers or fish and chips.  All options were delicious.  They offered lovely fresh bread/butter/pesto to start with and lots of dips such as mayo with mustard, salsa coleslaw with our burgers.  Would recommend it.  Staff were very attentive and friendly.  Lunch was ‚Ç¨15.95 and we had coffee afterwards.",5,2017,10,15
240,Hilton?,"Pro: Early check in. Nice house keeping staff. Nice gym. Clean room. Cabs always waiting in front. 
Con: No heat! Unwelcoming breakfast staff-make sure breakfast is pre paid, or be prepared to be treated like an intruder. Do not book hop on/off from machine in the lobby! It doesn't run. Ripped us off for ‚Ç¨30. Be careful asking front desk to book a different hop on/off bus. Incompetent at best. Do your own research, and book online. For some reason room service does not answer the phone(?). Average food, but I will allow that we were new to overseas food, coming from Arizona. 
Overall, not like other Hiltons we've stayed in. ",3,2017,10,13
240,"Nice, modern Hiltion, a little off the beaten track","I have only positive things to say about the Hilton Dublin Kilmainham.  The facility is modern and my room was large.  It even had a small patio (which was hard to use because of the rain, though I really liked having it!).  The room had enough space for a bed, the desk area, and a couple of small chairs.  I was traveling alone, but the room would have been plenty spacious for two people.  The bathroom was also on the large side.

The location might be a bit of a problem for tourists seeking to wander around Dublin.  Walking to the major tourist attractions would certainly be possible, but it might be a long walk for some.  On the other hand, it is right across the street from the Kilmainham Goal; I had a view from my room.",5,2017,10,13
240,Broyage Bar,"I have visited frequently bar lately and I would like to recommend all staff member and especially nice and helpful girl named Nikita. I do highly recommend the hotel and all of the staff, do not avoid to order food also as it is great as the service.",5,2017,10,12
240,Great Hilton,"Having stayed in many Hilton's in Europe this is one of the better ones. large modern rooms clean throughout, Great Pool and Bar area. staff friendly and helpful. and breakfast was one of the best Hotel breakfast's I have ever had.

Hotel is not central to city but there are buses that stop outside that will have you n the city in no time.",5,2017,10,10
240,Wedding Guest,The stay at the Hilton Kilmainham was a very happy experience and would stay here again without hesitation the staff were friendly and helpful at all times. The bar staff were especially patient as we were quite the group.,5,2017,10,10
240,Lovely hotel and the staff were smashing,"Lovely hotel and the staff were smashing. A couple of things we were a little disappointing with on Saturday when the service was very slow in the bar, but I think overall they looked after our family very well.  Great location.",4,2017,10,10
240,Customer Service,"Great service from their staff, particularly Mr David Lidwa, who served me. Amazing coffee served with a pleasant personality in a very efficient manner. Would totally come back for coffee!! Thanks ;)",4,2017,10,09
240,Great Waitress - Jamie,"Had a fantastic experience when I brought my daugther and baby to the Hilton for a meal last week.  Jamie, was our waitress and provided the best service not just serving great food and drinks quickly but in engaging with my kids, providing a kids colouring pack and more.  Food was awesome and service best in class.",5,2017,10,09
240,Great stay,Really enjoyed our stay at this hotel. Location is great if you want to be away from the busy city centre. Right opposite the historic Kilmainham Gaol which is definitely worth a visit. Car park is underground with direct access from the hotel lift. Fantastic breakfast and staff very friendly and helpful.,5,2017,10,09
240,Great,"Great stay.  Room was perfect size and was impeccably clean.  The services the hotel provides ie. Leisure centre are highly underrated as is the hotel as a whole- it really is a wonderful hotel.  Good food,  breakfast and also Ionut at reception who's an absolute gent. Looking forward to the next visit. ",5,2017,10,08
240,Great experience,"The staff at this hotel are always exceptional. Close walk to transit, comfortable rooms nicely located by the park. Already booked return for my next stay in Ireland. Thank you for being so welcoming ",5,2017,10,06
240,Great room and delicious restaurant!,"After staying in literally one of the worst places in London, this hotel was a godsend! The rooms are spacious and clean, the beds are wicked comfy, even the towels were excellent. The front desk staff is very friendly and helpful, helped us confirm our tours and made some recommendations for things to do in Dublin. 

Great location - right across the street from Kilmainham Jail, which sadly we didn't have time to tour although it's one of the top things to do in Dublin. Walking distance from Phoenix Park where there are hundreds of deer you can get up close and personal with. sadly, we didn't have time to do that either, but i hope you make the time to check it out!

Best part for me was their restaurant, Broyage. We did 2 full day tours and were out around Ireland for 13-15 hrs a day, so by the time the tour was over we were hungry but wanted to go to bed, and Broyage was an excellent option to eat close to home. all the food was delicious, we ate there every night and i think between the two of us we tried the whole menu. I honestly think it may have been a better option than many we would have found in downtown Dublin. Definitely try the Eton Mess and the Baileys hot chocolate <3 <3 

overall, would definitely recommend and would love to stay here again on my next trip to Ireland!!",5,2017,10,04
240,A fine hotel in Dublin!,"We often stay at Hiltons, but this one was one of the best we have ever stayed at. The amenities were excellent and the staff was very attentive. There is a great breakfast available as well.This is a great hotel for those visiitng Dublin.",5,2017,10,04
240,Comfortable Stay,"We used points to stay here and although it's not in the middle of everything, it was a good stay. Took a cab from the airport and the cabbie gave us some history while he drove us. They were doing construction in the hotel at the time so we didn't experience all it had to offer. But the room was nice and the breakfast was good. Very modern and spacious room. Good service from the staff. Location wise it is a bit out of the way. We walked to the Guinness factory from there but then grabbed the bus the following day to see downtown. It's across the street from Kilmainham Gaol and the Irish Museum of Modern Art. ",4,2017,10,02
240,Off the beaten path (in a good way),"This is a wonderful Hilton property that is located in a quiet part of Dublin while still being very convenient to several attractions (Guinness, the Gaol) and to some lovely pubs/restaurants.  The breakfast area for Hilton members is quite lovely and the service is very good. Rooms were spacious and we had a lovely patio.",4,2017,10,02
240,Spotless,"Very friendly and polite staff at the reception, breakfast restaurant, bistro & bar, fitness center. The hotel is modern and in an excellent condition. Spotlessly clean. Generous breakfast buffet. Nothing wrong at all. I would certainly stay again even though it is not located in the strict city center but it's 10 minutes away by taxi or bus.",5,2017,10,02
240,Hilton Kilmainham,"This hotel was the perfect location for our family trip!  Located just outside of City Centre, near Phoenix Park and the Zoo, and Kilmainham Gaol with super easy access to bus stops/transportation, yet far enough away from the late night revelers.",5,2017,10,02
240,Class,Definitely 5 star good location in the quieter part of the city great transport facilities outside front entrance lovely walking park 50 mtrs away Kilmainham jail tourist attraction 50 mtrs away fabulous decor fast check in/out friendly efficient staff throughout this Hotel breakfast one of the best i have seen room excellent warm clean fabulous bed bathroom wow brunch in the bar delicious well done Management &Staff excellent Hotel will stay again (Highley Rated),5,2017,10,01
240,Visit Dublin,This hotel was a good value and location was good.  Bus tour stops right in front of the hotel.  The bus Tour is a hop on hope off which allows you to see Dublin and all of it's sights. If you want to get off to visit a sight just hope off and when you are ready just hope on the next bus.,5,2017,09,30
240,Good Location,Great location. Hop on hop off bus stopped right in front. Good places to eat close and a gas station market. Excellent breakfast for Gold members. Helpful staff. Away from city center so quieter. Try not to get a room on the busy street side.,4,2017,09,29
240,Nice quiet location - right across from Jail,"We spent 3 nights here on our visit to Dublin. 

We had room 238 which had 2 beds and faced the Kilmainham Jail which is across the street. The room had plenty of space and was very comfortable. 

The bathroom had a full bath tub as well as a separate shower.

We had breakfast each morning and thought they did a terrific job. They had a buffet as well as made to order dishes.

The location is terrific with a bus stop right in front of the hotel for the hop on hop off buses and well as city buses number 69 and 79. A block away was another bus stop for bus number 13 and 40 which we used every day to go into the city center (15 minutes).

The biggest bonus for us was that the area is very quiet at night which let us have a chance to get a good night's rest.

Taking a cab from here to the airport took only 20 minutes since it is on the edge of the city center and the taxi can use the highway to go to the airport (‚Ç¨37).

Friendly service.",5,2017,09,28
240,Great Hilton near the city centre,"This Hilton is a great example of when a chain gets it right. The staff were faultlessly polite, helpful and engaging, the property is well designed and maintained. The rooms are comfy, wifi works very well throughout the property and the bathroom is properly equipped and well stocked with toiletries.  Breakfast is very much the standard Hilton fare, but that's what you expect. The bar area is comfortable for working in the day and relaxing in the evening, again staffed by engaging and helpful people.  All in all a very good property.",5,2017,09,28
240,Excellent service and staff,"My overall experience here was fantastic. Great location heart of the city.The hotel is quiet and has a wonderful breakfast. Great facilities  including gym , wonderful staff especially Lilian that never stoped smiling creating a great atmosphere and assisting me with a spare lock ,towel  and fine instructions on how to use the premises. Well done I highly recommend the hotel and will be back .",5,2017,09,27
240,Nice location but nothing special about the hotel,"Hotel is very close to Irish Museum of Modern Art park. Location was very convenient for me as I was with business but is far from downtown (about 3.5 KM). Area is quiet but there is not much to see or visit around. The pool is just for relax, no for swim. Staff was polite and helpful. Some rooms do not have minibar/fridge. Breakfast is good but I've seen better on other Hilton hotels.",3,2017,09,26
240,Great Location Great Service,The overall experience here was fantastic. Great location to visit some of Dublin's famous land marks including Kilmainham Gaol. The hotel is very modern and has all the amenities you would expect from the brand. The rooms are spacious bright and well apportioned. No negatives with this hotel.,5,2017,09,26
240,Directly across the street from the Gaol,"We choose this for our first day and night in Ireland before heading off west.  This is a convenient location with plenty of sights in easy walking distance, especially the Gaol directly across the street.  Very clean, very quiet, and the front desk staff was top notch.",5,2017,09,24
240,"Spacious rooms, although out of the city a little","Spacious room & bathroom, good beds, good breakfast, close to red bus hop on hop off tour stop, out of the city a little & on opposite side of the city to the airport. Good view from room. Close to Avis hire car pick up point.",4,2017,09,22
240,Kilmainham Hilton,"The hotel is directly across the street from the Kilmainham Gaol.  The breakfast served is very good with omelets and pancakes on order and a large selection at the breakfast buffet.  I ate dinner there and had drinks in the bar area.  The food was very good.  The staff is very nice.  This hotel in on the hop on hop off route as well as within a block of a bus stop.  We used the hop on hop off bus one day to see all of Dublin.  The hotel is outside of the city center, but if you want to tour the Kilmainham Gaol, it is the perfect location.  It is in a quiet area.",4,2017,09,20
240,"Pleasant stay, great staff ","Wife and I spent a very pleasant 7 day stay here. Staff is friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable about location and attractions. Had breakfast lunch or dinner here several times including room service which is nice after returning from day trips. The hop on/off bus stop is just across the street at the kilmainham  gaol which is very handy when sightseeing in the city. Highly recommend.",5,2017,09,20
240,Kilmainham Hilton,"A bit further than the city centre than I realised but frequent buses and walk through park meant it wasn't a problem. The hotel is as you would expect from the Hilton brand. Nice rooms, good breakfast, sauna, steam room and pool were very clean.",4,2017,09,19
240,Nice hotel across from the gaol,"Spent a couple of nights here with the family. The hotel is literally across the street from the gaol, which makes it convenient when planning a trip to see the place.
No lounge is a disappointment. But the hotel is well kept, upto Hilton standards and feels very comfortable.
Restaurant is excellent, and so is the breakfast spread. We had lunch, dinner and breakfast and found it very good. Staff is well.
Keep in mind, that this is not right in the city center so you may have to cab it there, but cabs are plentiful and inexpensive.
Enjoyed our stay. Recommended.",4,2017,09,16
240,Enjoyable,"The six of us took a maxi taxi from airport for 50 euros. 
This hotel is far away from the city center. It probably takes 45 mins walk if you don't mind. My standard room was spacious and seems to be renovated not long ago but furniture were still quite old. Bathroom was big with quality amenities. Had lunch at the restaurant with good food. Service was good in general except they did not have porter. The reception staff did help us with the luggage when asked. ",3,2017,09,16
240,Great modern hotel and well located,First time to stay in this hotel. Would strongly recommend especially if you need parking. Ample underground parking available. Customer service across the hotel is excellent from reception desk to breakfast room. Rooms are modern and clean with some very good views. Overall very impressed. Only suggestion is to turn down (or change) the pop music in the breakfast room. ,5,2017,09,16
240,Great location near hop on hop off bus and goal,Convenient location for the hop on hop off bus and Kilmainham jail. Room was clean and comfortable.  Front desk was very helpful with information regarding the surrounding area. Everything was wonderful and we had no complaints.,5,2017,09,15
240,You Will Enjoy,"This is a gem ... from friendly staff, to location across from the former Dublin Prison (Gaol), to well appointed rooms with great bedding and plenty of space, to great food including the ""Full Irish Breakfast"".   Also close to public transportation stops and DODUBLIN stop.",4,2017,09,15
240,Friggin awsome,"Had a lovely night . Well looked after . Room was spot on üëçüëç
Had a great nights sleep , would highly recommend to anyone wanting to stay in Dublin . 
Breakfast was a little on the expensive side , but that's Dublin for yee . ",5,2017,09,15
240,Nice stay,"The breakfast was fantastic in this hotel. 
We booked this hotel as it had a pool so were slightly disappointed on arrival to find that it was not large enough to swim lengths in. 
The hotel is about a 15 min walk from the train station and is a good bus ride from the centre so not for you if you want to be right in the centre of things but it was quiet in the evenings.",4,2017,09,14
240,Best Hotel in Dublin,"Look no further if you want a great hotel with friendly staff. Our room was perfect, and not far from the city centre. Our breakfast experience was great catering for everyone's taste. We dined in the Broyage Bar & Bistro where the service and food were excellent. Thank You to all of the staff for making our stay in Dublin extra special.",5,2017,09,13
240,Great Hotel in wonderful location,"This lovely hotel sits directly accross the street from Kilmainham Gail. The food is great for breakfast , lunch , and dinner. One evening I had dinner at a restaurant down the street called Union. This was also very good. Quiet room and comfortable bed. I would highly recommend ",5,2017,09,11
240,Loved it!!!,"Very friendly and helpful staff. Breakfast buffet was the best I've seen or had in all my travels, food was great.  Staff was quick and responsive to any request we had, ""lost key"" they were at our room within minutes letting us in. ",5,2017,09,11
240,Very convenient to everything!,"We stayed here for two nights.  Staff was super friendly and helpful. Location is great.
Rooms were comfortable and nice.  Coffee, not so great. In fact, I had to skip down the street to buy decent brew at the Lemon Tree Cafe,  Also, they need more computers in the lobby area. I had to wait half an hour to use one, as it was being used, and then the printer didn't work properly.  Other than that, no complaints about the hotel.",4,2017,09,10
240,"So comfortable, it felt just like home.","Large roomy accommodations.  Emaculately clean.  Free coffee every morning, even lattes.  2 miles outside of the city.  Parking garage available.  Staff very kind, friendly.  Water with lemon or orange available in the lobby at all times.   Irish Independent newspaper available for no charge in the lobby each am.   This was our last stop on a two week trip through Scotland and Ireland.  It was so comforting.",5,2017,09,10
240,"A So-So hotel, not worth the price","The Hilton Dublin Kilmainham could be so much more than a 3-star property. Let's break down my recent experience:

Pros:
+ A typical Hilton in terms of quality of the rooms, restaurant/bar etc. (And it's a good thing when I say ""typical"" because it meets the name standard).
+ If you are going to the Kilmainham Gaol, you literally can walk across the street.
+ Quiet location.

Cons:
- Very mediocre service. The property was full when I arrived, and I had reserved a room with one bed, instead of two. They didn't have any so I was stuck with two beds. Not a big deal, but I expect the hotel to at least apologize. Nope, nothing.
- At the bar, we asked whether they had any nuts, which I had a craving for. The waitress says ""yes"" and then walks off. She doesn't come back. I have no clue where she disappeared to, but no nuts appeared.
- What kind of a property this size has ONE business center computer? What is this - a Holiday Inn? I needed to do some work one night, and the WiFi was not working great. I went downstairs and had to wait for a family to check their emails, and then check Facebook etc. before I could do any work.
- You are in the suburbs, and are charging a premium for parking. Not cool.

For the price you pay at this hotel, I certainly expected better.",3,2017,09,10
240,Wonderful stay in Dublin,Travelled to Ireland for a family wedding and a quick stop in Dublin. Hotel is very modern and well maintained. Staff very friendly and courteous. Great location and had a morning walk whichever took in the sites around the hotel.,5,2017,09,10
240,Super clean hotel,"This hotel was super nice. The staff made my stay extremely pleasant and anytime I had questions they were more Got Andrew, Coming Home!!! Happy to help. Front desk staff offered multiple suggestions for day trips and places to visit ",5,2017,09,08
240,Very nice hotel!,"The Hotel is very nice, clean, comfortable, close to the centre of Dublin. Professional and helpful staff. I have to mention great delicious breakfast with irish rice mash and black pudding:-) Highly recommended!",5,2017,09,08
240,Just visited for lunch,"Just visited for lunch, didn't actually stay in the hotel. Have to say as far as burgers n chips goes. Doesn't get much better. Really good and luv the few sauces that came with it. Staff v good. The menu itself is very bulky, but that just being picky. Well worth the stop off. ",5,2017,09,07
240,"Very Americanized, we were so happy to be here!","After a wonderful North Ireland tour and staying at many local hotels that were HOT sweat boxes at night...all that was available for offer was a plug in fan(August 2017) this Americanized hotel was an absolute delight. Air conditioning, a pool, huge bed, desk, great bathroom, lounge bar and breakfast. 

Sometimes its good & wonderfully reliable to count on the consistent of an American brand. What can I say? Im an American lady who after 12 days in Ireland likes some USA comfort :)",5,2017,09,06
240,"Clean, quiet and well done","Great hotel near but not in the centre city of Dublin. Local bus is near by, good food in the neighbourhood. Would go back in a flash. Check out the breakfast buffet....extensive and good value for money. Scrambled eggs to die for.",5,2017,09,06
240,Great hotel and staff,"We started this trip at Hilton Dublin Kilmainham and we were not disappointed.  It was a perfect start to our stay in Ireland.  Our flight from the US was in an hour early. We were prepared to drop our bags at hotel and head out in search of breakfast until our rooms were ready.  Instead we were greeted by the amazing Ana ... the friendliest, most helpful and professional front desk personnel we have ever encountered. Her first question to us at 7:30 am after a trans atlantic flight was ""Are you okay with me switching your reservation to a room that is ready now?""  Not just one room ... but two ... ready for us at 7:30 am.  I wanted to hug here.  Then she gave us a tip about the tour of Kilmainham Goal which is directly across the street from the hotel  ... they always put a handful of tickets to the side for walk ins and she recommended we head over after we check in to see what they had available.  We were able to pick up a tour that very day at 11:30.   Our rooms were perfect, beds very comfy and hotel in a very good location.  You can purchase
tickets right in the lobby for many attractions, including Guinness Storehouse (a must do). Purchase your tickets in advance and sale past the line and right in.  Hop on Hop off bus begins in the front of the hotel ... super convenient.  Big and very sincere thanks to Ana for starting our trip off perfectly!!",5,2017,09,05
240,Wonderful Hilton stay!,Just the usual Hilton 5 star service as expected!  Breakfast was really terrific!  Location was close to many wonderful museums and family attractions!  You couldn't find a nice place to stay in Dublin!  Highly recommed!,5,2017,09,04
240,Dublin,"Love this hotel 
But they must train staff a little better so they all have the same rules
Lack of communication in staff big time between each other 
Lovely rooms 
Safe
Ask for help
Careful of theft as there is a lot of theft 
My case went missing 
",5,2017,09,03
240,"a perfect place for a rest, for play and for visiting Dublin","from the moment we stepped into the room and plunked our weary bodies on the beds we loved the Hilton Kilmainham..the beds were just what we needed... the service staff were very good, leaning ladies were great ....food... ummmmm so-so....fish undercooked fries could have been cooked more....front desk staff helped us greatly with info about getting around and great stops to see...loved the hotel",5,2017,09,03
240,Business hotel in easily accessible Dublin location,"An efficiently run, clean and smart hotel which is perfect for conferences as avoids the inner city traffic congestion and is close to Heuston train station, and the main motorways.I have used it several times and have not been disappointed",4,2017,09,03
240,Wonderful property,"We are currently staying and half way through our 4 night stay.  The hotel location for bus stops, and Kilmainham Gaol is perfect. We booked months ago and are paying a great rate.  We bought breakfast one morning for 15 euros. Great value, with lots of delicious choices on the buffet table. Down the street at Limetree is a lovely little cafe, and the cafe in the hotel is good value too. The Patriot Inn across the street is perfect for a quiet pint. Try the Ginger Beard beer.  Delicious.

My only item is there is a card, as in most hotels, encouraging me to save water and reduce  soap usage  by reusing my towels and linens.  I have followed the directions and yet my towels have been replaced daily. This annoys me. Lots of hotels do this, not just this one. Please let me reuse my towels and linens! 

The room is spotless, as is the whole property. I would happily recommend this proprty and stay here again. Really a great experience with staff and our room. Thank you for letting me vent about my towels being replaced too much. üòä",5,2017,09,02
240,Hilton Kilmainham - lovely hotel,"I stayed here for business, and despite checking in very late thanks to a late flight, the reception staff were superb & got me checked in very quickly. The room was great, the breakfast had something for everyone - even a full gluten free section. I gave 10/10 for my stay - love this place!",5,2017,09,02
240,Good hotel,Very good hotel with all facilities that we need. We have been there for 3 nights and enjoyed. Wifi was very good and wellness has everything that we need. Brekfast was very rich with a lots of very nice food for every tast. We will cam back for sure.,4,2017,09,02
240,Lovely spot for an evening drink,"I can't rate the hotel as I've never stayed there but i have started heading down to the outside terrace for an evening glass of wine or two this summer. The selection of wines is great and the atmosphere with the outdoor terrace is a little oasis in Kilmainham. Our waitress Lorna in particular makes you feel so welcome and is part of the reason we keep coming back. Everyone needs a local like this with great food, great wine and great staff.",5,2017,09,01
240,Nice modern hotel with good facilities,"Overall there isn't much to fault about the hotel, excellent breakfast, good facilities and comfortable rooms and reception area. Staff generally helpful and in some cases very helpful and we appreciated the breakfast bags for a long day trip. We liked the location-easy access to bus routes, some tourist attractions nearby and tram route but  more of a flavour of real Dublin and a residential neighbourhood nearby. We liked the local pubs with friendly staff. Note that at least three hop on hop off bus tours start outside the hotel.

Airlink Express takes you from Heuston station to airport, the station is about a 15 minute walk or a taxi ride to the hotel.

Thank you to all the staff including Christian for helping make our stay enjoyable and relaxing. Jani-Lee was especially friendly at breakfast.

 Only one minor negative was late night noise from the room next to us-we didn't have time to ask this to be addressed but it may have come from the interconnecting door-we were a little suprised too that the rooms were advertised as soundproofed as we could hear some late night traffic from the road and noise from room next to us. We stayed in room 238.

I would stay there again but for a short relaxing stay would have preferred a quieter room without a interconnecting door.

Thanks to Ana for her help with a taxi to the airport.

We would recommend the hotel for a stay near some tourist attractions but also away from the busiest areas of Dublin therefore in a part of the city.",4,2017,09,01
240,Great hotel with friendly staff!,"I greatly enjoyed my stay at this hotel. The staff was great and responsive. My room was clean and very comfortable. The hotel bar was excellent and I always enjoyed my meals at the onsite restaurant, Broyage. The hotel location was also ideal ‚Äì  far away enough from the city center to be quiet, but close to the trains and other tourist sites. There were several bus stops, both public or Hop-on/Hop-off right near the hotel and the DART station was a short walk away. In addition, being right across from the Kilmainham Goal and near the Royal Hospital made the experience even more memorable. I highly recommend this hotel and would stay again in the future.",5,2017,08,30
240,Last night in Ireland üáÆüá™,"After traveling about Northern Ireland and Ireland we spent our final nights here. What a nice room with a fun view of the world going by looking out over the Wicklow Mountains.  Our front desk staff was accommodating. Since we were too early to go to our room they held our belongings offering to deliver them to our room.  Rooms are so cozy and spacious and nice and new and clean... no signs of wear or mildew in the baths and beds are very comfortable with duvet.  Well appointed upscale features like the wardrobe.  Loved the hydrotherapy pool, soothing light, sauna, exercise equipment, etc but I loved the pool the most.   It even had jet so you could swim against a current.   The breakfast, which we added to our room price was amazing in its variety and the wait staff was very good.  Dinner at same was very very good and relaxed atomosphere.  I think it is a very good value.",5,2017,08,29
240,Best hotel ever!,"Stayed here for the first time with my fiance. What a lovely stay! The staff were all really lovely, welcoming, happy and helpful. The room was beautiful, spacious and cosey. And the pool was amazing with a hydrotherapy pool perfect for me who was heavily pregnant üòÅ We had breakfast before leaving and the selection was amazing ive never been to a hotel with so much selection to suit any person. I was amazed by the board of honeycomb WOW! I would highly recommend this hotel and i would return for sure üòÅ",5,2017,08,28

240,A fine Business Hotel,"Stayed at this hotel as I was in Dublin for a business meeting. Can't fault anything about it . The members of staff were great, my room was fine, free wi-fi was excellent. We took the bus from near the hotel to the centre which is about 15 minutes away. Taxi back was 10 Euros.
Great Breakfast, huge choice of everything. In all recommend this hotel whole heartedly",5,2017,08,23
240,Nice spot!,"We spent three nights at this hotel.  Though it is not walking to distance to the highlights of Dublin, it was perfect for us! We loved being across from the jail (especially since we didn't get advanced tickets and had to go over and try and get some of the day of reserve tickets!).  It was also on the route of the Rock n Roll run, which was amazing when I was about to be picked up by the pace bus!  Beautiful grounds of the Museum of Modern Art is across the street.  Breakfast was awesome with a buffet and ordering choices and a gluten-free zone, with its own toaster (my sister-in-law has celiacs).  The pool was awesome- one of my son's favorite parts! The restaurant for lunch/dinner was a bit slow service, but the outside eating was a nice atmosphere for lunch.  Rooms were clean and comfy! The hop on/hop off bus picks up right across the street!
Definitely go have dinner across the street at Dolve Vita.  The cheese on their pizza was so fresh and they had a myriad of gluten free pasta choices!",5,2017,08,19
240,Ideal Location,"The hotel is located just by Pheonix Park and is ideally situated to explore the city.  The hop on and off bus goes past and it is only a short walk to the Luas tram.  The car park is underground and there is a charge of 12 Euros per night which is not bad for city parking.  Our room was large and comfortable with the shower over the bath.  The bedding is automatically feathers so if you want hypoallergenic it is best to request it before you arrive, however they changed mine really quickly when I asked.  Maps of Dublin are available from reception if you ask.  Soya milk is available in the bar and restaurant if you ask. Disabled access is good.  We had evening meal in the bar and I had salmon which was delicious.  Water for the table is available if you ask.  Breakfast was a disappointment.  The cooked breakfast was only warm and some of the food was stuck together.  Our poached eggs took 20 mins to arrive............  I think it is best to book through the hotel website rather than through a third party.",4,2017,08,16
240,Great experience,"Two seniors and grandchild.  Outstanding hotel in a fun city.  It's not in the center of town but a nice location anyway. The staff was super at every turn; helpful, professional.  They made the stay easy and fun, for all three of us.",5,2017,08,16
240,outskirt city accomadation,"location for this hotel is within 15 to 20 minutes to city centre .Hop on hop off service is adjacent to hotel and is a cheap way to travel throughout the city within specific times.
Hotel itself is nice rooms are well decorated and well serviced.Staff are helpful and friendly .Front terrace is a nice open air space.The bar in this hotel has no atmosphere and is aimed at food service .Dont expect any irish craic or banter here.Kids are catered for in this hotel though kids menu was too sophisticated when simpler food would be more suitable.Over all nice stay .",4,2017,08,15
240,Cead mile failte - a hundred thousand welcomes!,"What I loved about the Hilton Dublin Kilmainham: location was superb; staff was extremely thoughtful; room was large and very clean; the bed was extremely comfortable (very important especially to an international traveler); there were three chairs in the generously-sized room and one chair in particular was so very comfortable; two phones were provided in the room; room safe; ample closet space;
loved the work area to stretch out and write; loved the abundant lighting in the room; what I truly appreciated was the design of the hotel: the elevators were separated by doors and this makes it very quiet as I did not hear the elevators from the room. Additionally the elevators featured a pleasant and soft chime.
I found this hotel to be very thoughtfully reinvented from its origin as a chocolate factory, a solid, sound, quiet building.
What a restful respite to my introduction to Ireland. 
Thank you Alex and the entire staff at Hilton Dublin Kilmainham: well done, well done!",5,2017,08,14
240,Amazing Service,"I stayed at the Hilton in early July. We checked in with ease and the ladies at reception were quite helpful.
My room was on the third floor and was quite comfortable. Bed was large and room was quiet.
We ate at the bistro that night and Lorna was a treasure. She was full of smiles and jokes. Our food was delayed and she was full of apologies and made sure the rest of our evening ran smooth.
Have to say one of the easiest stays I've had.",5,2017,08,14
240,Summer stay i Dublin,"We had a big and silent room, The beds were comfort and nice,big restroom. The room was very well cleaned. Very helpfull staff and the breakfast was great! The Luas was only 5 minutes walk away and took 10 minutes to city center.",5,2017,08,10
240,Business Trip Dublin,"Hotel very clean , very convinent for Dublin centre , nice bar lovely breakfast, big rooms , nice staff , car park below which they charged 12 euros for , would stay again no problem , no bad words for this hotel ",4,2017,08,09
240,Hilton quality!,"Loved this hotel from the beginning, its location which needs a little bit of public transport to get into the city center but it was quite good experience, LOVED the breakfast which was great in price/value, great selection with good quality items - well worth the price.

Only hiccup was that I got a stained (with brown something...) towel one day, I did not withdraw points because the maid could not see it before she put it there.

Most definitely I recommend this hotel, its staff is proficient, effective, polite, kind, informative.",5,2017,08,08
240,What a Gem of a Hotel ,"I stayed at this hotel for one night and absolutely loved it! Great location just 15 mins from central Dublin. Fabulous rooms, restaurants and bars and really lovely staff. The bedrooms are huge and very comfortable, I loved having a separate Bath and shower. Well done to the Hilton team for maintaining such high standards. ",4,2017,08,03
240,Excellent Stay,Although we only stayed one night the standard of service was excellent. From the moment we arrived we were looked after by very attentive staff who went out of the way to ensure everything was up to expectations,5,2017,08,03
240,Wonderful Hotel,I took my wife for a short stopover on the way home from the UK. The hotel was wonderful. Beautiful rooms and excellent staff. Ana at the front desk was amazing. She knew the best places to go and the best places to eat.,5,2017,08,03
240,Wonderful stay!  Super!!,"Reception staff:  Always predisposed and very friendly. The best!
Concerning location & amenities, were very good.
The neighborhood is very quiet to walk, also means of transport nearby that lead to different points of the city.
",5,2017,08,02
240,"Helpful staff, nice facility","Had a lovely visit.  Room had a large bed for us and twin for our 13 yo son.  Worked very well for us: slept there and not much else.

Front desk was outstanding, went way beyond expectations to help us with a lost bag courtesy of Aer Lingus. Shauna was a delight, even calling the airport baggage people and waiting on hold form an hour trying to help.  Followed with a handwritten note that evening.  The morning clerk felt so bad for us that they comp'd us a full and outstanding breakfast on our last morning.  Nice location and attractive facility.  Best Hilton experience I've had.",5,2017,08,02
240,Family time!,"Hotel is fabulous and well placed for the Dublin Gaol, Guinness Factory, MMA, Phoenix Park&Dublin zoo. Tour bus bus stops opposite the hotel front and taxis always available too. Hotel staff were wonderful and informative. It has all amenities available, rooms are fabulous and if you want breakfast but haven't already paid or booked it..then make sure you do...gorgeous food with so much choice x",5,2017,08,02
240,I LOVE HILTON DUBLIN KILMAINHAM!,"Excellent staff and venue! Hotel Management was very helpful when I was victim of theft in another country and had to cancel my return reservation. Room, food and service, WORLD CLASS! I will be making my return to this hotel in the near future.",5,2017,08,01
240,Excellent Room Service,"I stayed at Hilton for 3 days during my travels around Ireland, room was comfortable and very clean. Very close to City Centre and Kilmainham Gaol is just opposite of the hotel. Room Service was excellent and right on time when i requested the time. Young lady calls Paula was cheerful and very helpful when my partner wasn't well is because i asked her if she can get more water but she did came back again. Excellent stay and room was fabulous along with breakfast and lunch at the bar especially the chicken wings.

Will be back one day!",5,2017,07,31
240,"""Dublin Hilton""","Nice hotel away from the downtown crowds. We enjoyed an excellent dinner at a restaurant only a block from the hotel (Union 8) after touring the historic Kilmainham Gaol, which is just across the street.

Our stay used HHonors points, a nice perk.",4,2017,07,29
240,The good & the bad,"We have been here a few times for a drink & loved it , it's quiet relaxing comfortably  & lovely to sit outside on a nice day.We came back to have a meal & it was a bit disappointing, although there is a lot of staff shoving menus at you & constantly asking if everything is okay the service is not great. It's not possible to change anything even slightly on the menu, if anything is forgotten (steak knife, butter etc.you may get it yourself)Very pricey, especially steak that had nothing much to accompany it, & cold Irish coffee.We will stick to just having a drink in future.",3,2017,07,29
240,Fabulous Hotel in Fabulous City,Stayed here recently when I was visiting home and I have nothing bad to say about the place. It has a perfect location and the hotel had everything we needed from parking to nice clean room. The breakfast was very nice and our stay in Dublin was extremely enjoyable ,5,2017,07,28
240,Excellent Location and Staff,"Excellent location and wonderful staff, especially Emma at the front desk.  She was very helpful and knowledgeable.  Location is great.  Across the street from hop on hop off.  Would recommend the red line instead of the green line.  The red line has buses more frequently.  The hotel is quiet and  has a wonderful  breakfast.  The staff is very helpful and willing to assist with any needs you may have.  Highly recommend if you are staying in Dublin .",5,2017,07,28
240,Ideal for Runners!,"Our plan to start from this hotel on a week of exploring Ireland was solid! Remembering how to drive on the left was a small challenge but the 30 minute drive was easy. If I had a do over, I would've requested a smaller car but that's on me.

Front desk staff was up to the task and we got our room early. The room was quiet, clean and comfortable (bed was great)!

There is a fitness center and it was well appointed. However, as a runner, going outside was the clear choice!

There are parks and paths along the river that are ideal! chose going down the hill toward Phoenix Park (about 3 minutes away) but before I got to it, I went left into the War Memorial Garden. By going through a gate, I picked up a single track oath to the right that led to another gate next to the river (opposite shore had rowing clubs) and found a bike/ ped path that heading directly toward a village. At the far end I went through another gate and into the edge of the town. Running in the town early in the morning was ideal since no one was out and about. Turning around after five minutes and retracing my route back to the Hilton gave me a clean 4 miles.

If I stayed more than one night i could've had different routes in three different locations with decent distances.

The Italian restaurant diagonally across the street on the second floor was simple and had great fare for low cost.

The jail tour across the street was fascinating and worth the price!",5,2017,07,28
240,Secret gen in Dublin," I have stayed at this property numerous times service was excellent the room was excellent location just outside of the edge of town perfect away from the hustle and bustle of the big city secret place in the heart of Dublin ",5,2017,07,27
240,Decent hotel,"This hotel is not located in the fun and busy area of Dublin.  However, it is near the Kilmainham Jail and on the hop-on/hop-off bus line.  It's a decent hotel with a great breakfast and good customer service.",4,2017,07,26
240,Dublin Vacation,"We arrived very early on a weekday morning (5:45 a.m) and the front desk staff was very apologetic about not having our room ready (normal check-in is well after noon).  They suggested a number of things to do in the very local area until our room was ready.  We followed their suggestions, returned about 9:00 am and had breakfast in the hotel.  when we were done our room was ready!  this was about 10:15 or so.  Such wonderful service!  the location across the stree from Kilmainham Gaol was convenient to bus service as well as some wonderful places like Guinness Store House.  The staff was so helpful in finding bus routes and planning trips.  The hotel is modern and has all the conveniences that one would expect with a Hilton property.  Super Staff!  Super Stay!  Thanks!",5,2017,07,26
240,place to stay in Dublin,"close to city centre but surroundings are relaxing and away from it all. Great staff,lovely food, great breakfast love the honeycomb, good bar to relax and unwind. great hydro pool, pool a little small for swimming but very relaxing. Close to guniness brewery, hop on hop off bus a must for ease of travel and value for money stops right outside hotel and major attraction sites",5,2017,07,26
240,Dublin Hilton,"Great location and helpful staff. We stayed here at the end of a week tour of Ireland. It was easy to get around the city and the hotel was clean, quiet and comfortable. We were not able to use the restaurant due to a large corporate private party.",4,2017,07,26
240,Great hotel away from busy city centre,"We chose this hotel because it was away from the city centre but very handy for the tram, the stop five or so minutes walk away. Lovely room, big comfy bed. Breakfast selection was extensive, lots of choice if hot and cold. Staff very friendly and helpful. We would definately come back to this hotel again.
",5,2017,07,26
240,Hilton quality in Dublin...,"A nice hotel, but a bit far from central sites.  The Hilton is right across the street from Kilmainham Goal and the park with the Museum of Modern Art; apart from that, it's not really near any of the more popular sites.  We did walk from here to ""Central"" Dublin, but it is a long walk with not really a whole lot in between.  We were on a bus tour of Ireland and this is where they put us up.  The staff, the service, and the rooms were excellent, of course it is a Hilton, so expectations are high.  If you want to be away from the bustle, then you can trust the Hilton name and this hotel would certainly and easily fit the bill.",4,2017,07,25
240,Wonderful hotel and convenient location,Beautiful hotel with lots of amenities. Very convenient location that was close to the action in Dublin but far enough away to feel private. Hotel room was large enough for our family of four and clean/bright. Enjoyed our stay!,5,2017,07,25
240,As Expected ,"I travel a lot for work and I almost always stay at a Hilton location, as it's the Hilton you expect the best quality and you get it so it's not a surprise, good linens, powerful hot showers, however the breakfast left something to be desired, but again, it's a hotel breakfast. 

This location has a good gym and I love the  way the pool area is built, it's certainly very special in that regard. 

",5,2017,07,25
240,A room with a view,"Stayed in accessible room on 4th floor, which was well designed for a wheelchair user, comfortable beds and the floor to ceiling windows afforded a superb view over the local picturesque area and onwards to the distant mountains. Staff were helpful, professional and friendly. First visit to the hotel but not the last.",5,2017,07,24
240,Gerry Donnelly ,"Brilliant Hotel very clean and efficient staff. Would Definitely Book again. I got a lot of local advise from a young lady who worked in the dinning room, she was very friendly professional and pleasant. Thanks Jamielee.",5,2017,07,23
240,A nice break as an American,"If you enjoy traveling the UK and staying in the local quaint locations but long for a small touch of a US full service hotel, this is it.  We loved all of the little villas and B&B's we stayed in but after awhile I longed for a good old taste of home and this was it.  Nice staff and breakfast and the room was just what we needed.",5,2017,07,21
240,"Great Location, Outstanding service","We arrived in Ireland and stayed at this Hilton for the first 2 nights.  I was pleased beyond measure at the level of service and kindness of the staff.  The hotel is beautiful and exceptionally comfortable and hospitable. I also can't say enough about the breakfast spread, everyone was happy including the kids and me with my special diet.
There is an old prison right across the street that you can tour, worth the visit but get your tickets right away as they sell out fast.  Very interested living conditions in that prison back in the day.
I lost my wallet during our time in Dublin.  I gave up hope, but grateful that my passports were somewhere else. We got back to the states and we got a phone call that my wallet was recovered in the hotel room and they will be shipping it to me with a tracking number.  My wallet arrived and everything is in tact.  My heart is singing! I want to thank the staff member that found my wallet, and Ms. Haidau for shipping it!",5,2017,07,20
240,Best Hotel of our Holidays,"The Hotel is modern and elegant. Our room was really big and quite, although the hotel is situated next to a moderately busy street. The installations are all very clean and the staff at the reception were really kind and helpful, especially Alex, who gave us a lot of tips...It is situated directly next to the Kilmainham Gaol Museum, by the way, and a little far from downtown. But 5 minutes from the hotel there were several buses which take you directly downtown in 15 minutes. We will undoubtedly recommend this hotel if you happen to travel to Dublin.",5,2017,07,20
240,A Fine Family Stay,"Brilliant breakfasts. Fun neighborhood. Cool pool under the hotel. Respectful and polite staff and importantly for a family (and business travelers), this is a quiet hotel in a low-key Dublin neighborhood. 

The Hilton Dublin Kilmainham served our family superbly on our recent stay in Dublin. Its location is close to downtown action and tourist spots. It's a 15-minute cab ride to Ha'Penny Bridge (heart of city), a 10-minute drive to the Guinness Factory, and, if you get a sunny day, it's a really fine hike on foot to downtown. It's also a 15-minute direct drive to SBG gym, the martial arts gym where our kids trained while in Dublin. It's also across the street from the Kilmainham Jail, a must-visit historical location, and also across the street from the Irish Museum of Modern Art.

The neighborhood itself is pleasant, close to Phoenix Park and the zoo, with all essential shops a few minutes walk, plus a really nice restaurant, Union 8, just down the street. The hotel also has on site, underground parking if you've rented a car. We had dinner as a family in the pub across the street and though they wouldn't let us eat in the pub with our kids, the restaurant upstairs, while drably decorated, actually served really good food. The hotel food is quite good, too, as well, both for breakfast and at the hotel bistro. 

Not only are all aspects of the hotel, in service and in material condition, really exemplary, but the location of the hotel in a quiet part of town really served us well. It's perched perfectly for good trips in all directions. We came to see the place as an oasis of calm on our frenetic days in the city, and looked forward to returning each night--and some time in the future again.",5,2017,07,19
240,Always great,"Stayed here for one night while on business in Dublin. Easy to get to from the airport and to/from city centre.
Room was comfortable, immaculately clean and very relaxing. Service was excellent - as always.
My favourite hotel in Dublin ",5,2017,07,19
240,Incredible Stay! Loved every aspect of the hotel.,"We had a most memorable stay here as we celebrated our 20th anniversary as well as my husband's birthday! From the moment you arrive, you feel like you are in a sanctuary, yet, you are not far away from many of the city's delightful attractions.

Our check in was a breeze as we were assisted by Sebastian, who was helpful and knowledgeable. We dropped off our stuff and headed down to have a delicious dinner at the hotel restaurant. The wait staff at the restaurant was excellent! We also had breakfast included which was a big plus. There are SO many incredible options, and the juices in particular are divine. We were assisted by Monica who is simply a gem! 

There is a cute little place just steps away from the hotel  to grab a bite, or lunch, as they close early...it's called The Lime Tree Cafe; delicious food and great service too.

Last, but definitely not least, I would like to thank Ana, who I think is probably the sunshine of the entire hotel. She is friendly, personable, knowledgeable and extremely helpful.  My husband had called and asked her about everything and anything and she was glad to help and offer suggestions. She went above and beyond to make sure our stay was an incredible one. The hotel is lucky to have her, for sure.

Needless to stay, this will be our place to stay at anytime we return to Dublin.",5,2017,07,18
240,Excellent service ,"We ate in the hotel restaurant and the food was lovely. Our waitress was Cody, who was super friendly and is the perfect example of excellent service. We will be back. This hotel is in excellent location to Kilmainham jail ",5,2017,07,18
240,Excellent Service,"I attended the Hilton Dublin Kilmainham Restaurant where Cody Smith served me. Cody was extremely helpful, efficient and very friendly. She provided me with excellent customer service which made my meal even more enjoyable. An amazing experience because of an amazing server. Thanks again Cody!!",5,2017,07,17
240,Great stay,"an up and cumming part of the cit, worth a stay for the zoo and cit jail tour, reasonable walk or cab over to Temple Bar area. We liked the new location vs St Stevens Green, where we spent time in the past.",4,2017,07,16
240,Great food. Great value and service,"Many thanks to Lorna (mind of information) for looking after our family after a visit to kilmainham jail. Great to relax and unwind in comfort before we headed on our way. Will call by again. In the middle of memorial gardens, jail, kilmainham hospital, Guinness storehouse Collins barracks and much more",4,2017,07,12
240,Nice Hotel with Nice Amenities,"My husband, my 18-yr old daughter & niece, and I stayed at the Hilton Dublin Kilmainham for 3 nights in June.  My husband and I stayed in a King Studio Suite (#532) and the girls stayed in a Twin Ensuite room (#319).  Both our rooms were clean, spacious, and nicely appointed.  Both rooms came with WiFi, a 42"" plasma TV, and complimentary water.  I REALLY appreciate the complimentary water since I drink a lot of water and have to have one by my bed every night. I didn't have to worry about where to buy water on my vacation and carrying it back to the hotel since many hotels overcharge for bottled water.  They even offered us a choice between still and sparkling water. As for the WiFi, we all used the WiFi and had no problems with it.

Our King Studio Suite had a balcony with chairs overlooking the River Liffey. There was a metro that went over the river, but it was quiet and didn't bother us. The bed was very comfortable, but needed a separate sheet.  They enclosed the ""sheet"" around the comforter, which was too hot for me even with the air conditioning.  I would frequently wake up in the middle of the night to throw off the comforter and then put it back on after I cooled off. It would have been nicer to have a separate sheet and a lighter comforter. The bathroom had a separate shower and tub with amenities that included shampoo, conditioner, lotion, shower cap, tissues, and make-up mirror.  The water pressure was very good, which I really liked since I have long hair.

The Twin Ensuite Room also had comfortable beds.  The twin room had a combination shower and tub with the same bathroom amenities as our King Suite.

We ate breakfast at the hotel every morning.  It cost 12 euro/person and was very good with a nice selection of fruits, yogurts, cold cereals, oatmeal, scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, juices, coffee, and tea. You can also order an omelet.  I had an omelet and saut√©ed mushrooms one morning and they were very good.  I believe you can also order other breakfast items like pancakes and waffles. 

Other items worth mentioning are parking and transportation into Dublin city center.  Parking at this Hilton is 12 euro/night, which I thought was a little pricey since The Morrison Doubletree by Hilton also charges 12 euro/night and they're basically in the city center.  To get into the city center from the Hilton Dublin Kilmainham, we took an easy 15 min walk to the Heuston Rail Station (almost 1 km) to ride the red line of the Luas Tram.  Depending on where we got off, it was only about a 5 - 10 min ride on the tram. The Suir Road tram stop is only about a 5 min walk from the Hilton, but you're going to pay to travel through 2 zones instead of just one from the Heuston Station.  Alternately, you can walk 5 mins to the nearest bus stop, which will then take you about 25 mins to get into the city.  So, it's about the same amount of time to get into the city anyway you choose.

So, bottom line:  very nice hotel, but you will have to calculate additional time in your schedule to get into and out of Dublin.",4,2017,07,12
240,Nice Hotel in Nice Neighborhood,"The Kilmainham Hilton is a little Dublin oasis. It's outside the main shopping/tourist part of town, but nearby several interesting places to visit--the Kilmainham jail and the Museum of Modern Art. There are a handful of good restaurants and coffeeshop/bakeries nearby, and the hotel's breakfast buffet is very good and very filling. The hotel maintains high Hilton standards, and gives a tired tourist an comfy retreat. I splurged a little to book a room with a balcony (two chairs and a table), which I made good use of and recommend if you want a private space to relax with a drink. I was here for two nights, and this clean and comfortable hotel helped get rid of my jet lag.",4,2017,07,12
240,Good location but limited service,"We stayed here for 9 days and one night we got an incident that I got food poison. I got very sick. My head was spinning and I threw up in the sink. It made the sink clogged. The front desk told us ignorantly that I shouldn't have done that (obviously I knew but I couldn't control myself at that time.) They said they didn't have to key to the maintenance room and there was nothing they could do until 8 AM the next day because it was bank holiday. Seriously, we picked to stay at Hilton because we thought it would meet a high standard hotel. At least they should have the key to the maintenance room. We had to complaint again and again until the front desk fed up and let us stay in another room for a night until the sink was unclogged. I emailed Hilton customer service and they said that the management at Hilton Kilmainham would get back to us but we never heard anything from them. It was a good place to stay and in the perfect location...until something happened and they couldn't do anything for you. ",2,2017,07,12
240,Lovely Hotel let down by staff,This hotel is in a great location for the Royal Hospital Kilmainham venue but it is considerably let down by the staff who are anything but attentive. We tried to eat in the bar but it was very busy due to the concert in the vicinity and after standing for about 10 minutes trying to get staff members attention and asking what was the wait for a table whilst being largely ignored we decided to order room service however we were told that would be over one hour due to how busy the bar was. The following day when we did manage to have lunch in the bar we had to keep calling staff over to get served otherwise we would still be sitting there -their customer service is quite poor. Given the prices they charge per room only stay I would expect better.,3,2017,07,12
240,Excellent hotel,"Great hotel and amazing staff.
Brilliant location.
Great food. 
Highly recommend this hotel.
I would definitely stay again.
Kilmainham gaol is just across the street and was a great informative experience. The Kilmainham hospital grounds and museum was also a beautiful relaxing experience.",4,2017,07,10
240,Hilton stay,I always choose the Hilton when visiting Dublin. Consistently excellent standard and friendly staff.its a very central location with good parking. I was made to feel welcome. The staff were attentive throughout my stay,5,2017,07,10
240,Stay in Dublin,"Excellent but small Hilton off the beaten path but near enough to walk to most areas of Dublin on the south side of the river. Wonderful staff, very friendly and helpful. Very close to historic Kilmainham Jail (for an interesting tour), Patriots Pub and Kilmainham Hospital (Currently the Dublin Museum for Modern Art).",5,2017,07,09
240,Start of our Family Vacation,"We started our two week family vacation,13 of us, at the hotel. Everyone there from the time we were greeted at the front desk on our arrival until we left were great. The rooms were very nice & comfortable & the breakfast was a great way to start the day. Many thanks to the entire staff for starting  our family vacation off with a bang.",5,2017,07,08
240,Lovely Stay,Thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Very convenient for our wedding. Short wslk to phoenix park/zoo. Good wifi & fab breakfast! Helpful staff. Slightly disappointed with the pool facility but only a minor thing. Overall a great experience  ,5,2017,07,07
240,"Great place to stay in Dublin.Quite neighborhood. Very clean, very comfortable beds. Breakfast in Cinnamon was great.","Great place to stay in Dublin. Quite neighborhood. Very clean property, housekeeping does a great job. Very comfortable beds. Breakfast in Cinnamon is great. In room dining service is very good as well.",4,2017,07,07
240,Fab lunch,"While visiting family and friends in Dublin we went into this hotel for lunch with our two young kids.  Served by an extremely friendly and very helpful girl called Lorna.  Not only was she very helpful with taking our lunch order Lorna was brilliant with the kids, she kept the kids entertained while we could look over the menu without the usually from the kids.  Would definitely recommend the hotel for lunch to my friends with kids and will be back again.  Thank you, especially to Lorna.",5,2017,07,07
240,Got us out of a pickle,My friend and I didn't actually stay at the hotel on the night in question but based on our experience we would be very happy to in the future. We had a gig in Kilmainham and had travelled from Donegal to get there so we had a small suitcase with us. Now we had planned to leave it in the lockers at Busaras but found out on arrival that they close at 11pm so that was of no use to us. We tried several places around the city but to no avail. As you can't take luggage into the venue we were starting to panick by the time we arrived there. We sheepishly asked a lovely man called Sebastian at reception if there was anything we could do and he proceeded to give us a ticket and took the case off our hands for the evening. We were so grateful we decided to have quite a few drinks in the hotel bar so we feel it was a win win for everyone in question! Thanks so much Sebastian and the rest of the lovely staff in the Hilton.,5,2017,07,06
240,"Great hotel, good location","We stayed at this hotel prior to the start of, as well as part of, a group bus tour. The hotel staff is very friendly and helpful. The rooms we had were spacious and comfortable. It is exactly what you would expect from a Hilton hotel. The onsite restaurant has good food at a decent price.

The hotel is a little far from the center of town, but there is a bus stop on the main east-west line into the city center within a five minute walk from the hotel. The ride to the city center is about 10 minutes.",5,2017,07,06
240,Good location and service but short of expectations overall,Service was good. Breakfast every morning was nice and good options. Location was decent. Not down in central tourist area but we had a car so good for us. The rooms were a little tired and in need of upgrade to maintain the standard for a Hilton. At least for what I'm used to having stayed at Hiltons around the world. ,4,2017,07,04
240,Excellent,"Excellent hotel, very friendly staff, beautiful rooms, clean to a very high standard, very comfy mattress and bedding. Nice location, close to heuston, you can hop on the Luas from there. Taxis outside the door. ",5,2017,07,02
240,Ideal Location,"our short stay in Dublin was at this hotel
excellent service from all the staff
our room was at the rear of the hotel and although we didn't have an exciting view it turned out to be perfect as it was peaceful and we didn't have to watch traffic, as the front rooms at the hotel has,
we only had bed and breakfast option, but I must say you couldn't wish for a more wide selection of food,
we ate in the bistro in the foyer, which was very good and we also had a few hot drinks too, 
on the whole we would stay there again as it was perfect location to reach all the various places of interest,
one last note it isn't to far from the airport too.",5,2017,07,02
240,Great location but a little short of expectations,Handy location for our two night stay. Have stayed at other Hilton associated hotels which were presented and operated at a much higher standard than Kilmainham. Rooms are comfortable but a little tired. Had unresolved  issues getting sufficient hot water to the shower.,3,2017,07,01
240,Excellent hotel,"The hotel was very well located with a bus stand right opposite.The reception did an excellent job, as reception as well as concierge.( Specially Ionout) .
The mattresses and pillows were too good...we had an excellent sleep on all days.( If you happen to read the review, please email the company and specs of mattresses n pillows)
The breakfast was very good..specially the muffins.",5,2017,07,01
240,Great stay!,"Very nice hotel near many cultural activities and small shopping area - and a short cab ride (about $15-20) to the city center or a 30 minute 2-miles walk.  Spotlessly clean room and bathroom, and I mean REALLY clean. VERY comfortable bed and pillows. Internet worked very well. Food offerings were very good and better than most hotels. Extremely helpful front desk staff.  Very quiet rooms even though we faced the street, which is busy. No issues at all, this was an excellent stay and I would return.",5,2017,06,30
240,Great accommodations Excelent staff,"We spent our first night in Ireland at this hotel.  The staff was amazing in terms of offering advice and information on locations, public transport options, and sights to see, as well as a good steer to try the ice cream in Bray.  Beds were very comfortable for us but might be a little soft for some.  The breakfast in the morning was also very nice.  Would definitely stay here again.",5,2017,06,30
240,"Wonderful Accommodations, staff COULD be a touch friendlier...","My husband and I just returned from a two week vacation across the UK and Ireland. We are Hilton Diamond members, so we generally only stay at Hilton's. The Hilton Dublin Kilmainham was our best hotel out of the ones we stayed at when travelling. The rooms were spacious, the beds very comfortable and the breakfast delicious! It's also well located, with only a short taxi ride away from the City Centre. 

My one and only small complaint, was that I did think the staff could be a bit friendlier. Both my husband and I agreed that out of the Hilton's we stayed at on our trip, though the physical hotel at this location was the best, the staff was the least friendly of the ones we'd stayed at. Upon arriving in Dublin, only 1 out of 3 of our bags made it, so you can imagine my husband and I weren't very happy and a bit stressed. Upon checking in, I made a point to let the hotel know, in case the airline called to deliver the bags (as they said they would). My husband I were both having issues with our phones on the journey, so it was nice to have a backup contact, and the airline had asked for our hotel. Each time we returned, we inquired on if the hotel had heard anything about the bags, and each time the front desk person we'd asked seemed annoyed at us and gave us a short ""the airline will contact you"" response. Well yes, I know they will. However, since not all always goes according to plan (case and point with our bags being lost by the airline in the first place), and since my husband and I were having issues with our phones, you can better believe that on the off chance the airline did not contact us and just called the hotel, I am going to check in each and every time I return for the day. No need to act annoyed with us for asking, I promise you that we were more annoyed to be without clean clothes for two days. 

Other than that, the stay was quite nice.",4,2017,06,29
240,Great place to stay,"I come to Dublin every week, I have for over 2yrs now. This is my favourite hotel...why?

- I've tried many Dublin hotels. This is the best for my budget.

- bigger and better rooms than the city centre. Great beds and the room is always clean, I've never had an issue.

- quieter than the city centre. Rooms in the heart of the city can be very noisy from all the bars etc.

- 10 mins by taxi from the city centre

- Kilmainham is a great area of Dublin

- staff are great, genuinely care and always with a smile. No attitude here.

- the hotel food is good with a lovely bar.

",5,2017,06,27
240,Drinks at Hilton,"Was in this hotel for drinks the other day and I have to say, seen as my first time was very impressed with the place itself and the service. I was served by a girl called Lorna who was extremely friendly and helpful esp when I was quizzing her about sights to see in Dublin. She was so pleasant - I will be back",5,2017,06,27
240,Dinner,Come here for dinner with my family a few times and I could never fault it ! The food is absolutely gorgeous. The hotel itself is lovely. Lorna has been our waitress for the last few times we have ate her and she is absolutely amazing. Very lovely girl. All in all this hotel is lovely and great staff and service.,4,2017,06,26
240,"Clean, comfortable and a great restaurant","This hotel was so much nicer than other ""4star"" hotels we stayed in during our visit to Ireland.  Room was quiet and cool.  A/C and Extremely comfortable bed and pillows. Nice bathroom with good lighting. Good water pressure in shower. Helpful and friendly staff.
Only 20 minutes to commute to airport.  Best night's sleep in the last 2 weeks!  Also, room was a nice size.",4,2017,06,26
240,Nice family room with amazing breakfast!,"We enjoyed our stay very much. Walking distance to city center (not a short walk, but manageable for our kids). Family room has king bed plus a twin. Clean and comfortable. Lovely bathroom with tub and separate shower. Did not hear any noise from our neighbors. 
Complimentary breakfast selection  is outstanding and staff is professional and welcoming. ",5,2017,06,26
240,Nice Hotel - Good Location,"Me and my sister stayed at the Hilton Dublin Kilmainham last week during our short vacation.

Hotel is in a good location being very close to Dublin Heuston Train and Luas station. Hence transportation was easy

Hotel staff is very nice and helpful.

Rooms were clean and comfortable. Its like a normal business hotel with basic amenities in the room. Please do not mistake it for a 5 Star.",4,2017,06,26
240,Nice Hotel,"The hotel was nice.  I did not really like the location but the inside was pleasant.  I am a Hilton Honors member but did not get treated as one.  Not that I was treated poorly, but usually I am thanked for being a Hilton Honors member and given a cookie or something at the check-in.",4,2017,06,26
240,A week at the Hilton,"We were greeted at reception Ionut. He explained everything in detail.  Our breakfast waitress was Monica and it was a pleasure being looked after by her... She was so helpful and friendly. Raja was our evening waiter and he,s was very pleasant to deal with.. Padraig was food and beverage manager he was so nice and took the time to get to know us...Rooms were very clean and spacious, bathroom had separate  shower and  provided all the necessities. Breakfast had good variety and choice. Loved the orange juice.. Food in general was quiet good.  Seating outside was comfortable. I will be back",4,2017,06,25
240,Do not stay here .. scalding shower,The shower temperature cycled between tepid to scalding. We managed. At one stage I recoiled from the scalding water and nearly fell .. I did not fall but if I had I would not be typing this.  Pressure control valve in the water stem needs to be fixed.,2,2017,06,25
240,Local Food?,The hotel was great for me in the sense that it is right off the highway and I could access the park without too much trouble in the morning.   The bed is incredibly comfortable and I loved the bath tub in the room.   The food left a lot to be desired. It was my worst meal at a restaurant in Ireland. Ireland is filled with locally sourced and organic food and I did not see anything of the kind on your menu.,4,2017,06,25
240,Ana (check in) and Monika (server) were excellent!,"Ana was Incredible and accommodating with suggestions to see the island. Also, Monika helped with attending to our needs as my girlfriend wasn't feeling well. I would definitely stay here again. Check out the hydrotherapy pool. ",5,2017,06,24
240,Hilton Kilmainham,"Excellent hotel, large room with king bed. Good size bathroom and shower en-suite.  Stayed there twice - 6 nights and then 3 nights and both rooms were excellent. If you are used to ""American"" Hiltons this is pretty similar and very different from the standard European hotels which tend to be small and cramped.  Large bar with good food (selection, quality and price) and a perfect way to get a nice night-cap after a hard day vacationing.  Prices seem pretty reasonable for Dublin but the luxury and comfort is worth it.  One of the best hotels I stayed at in Dublin.

Situated in Kilmainham makes it fairly handy for most activities. There is ample public transportation - Luas , Bus and Taxi.  While not City Center the location is good. Car park under hotel if you are driving. Nice coffee shops, bakeries and stores in area for breakfast if you don't want to eat at hotel.  About 40 euro taxi ride from Airport (40-50 minutes) or 6 Euro on Airport bus which only goes to Heuston Station and take a good 60-80 minutes as it stops at all the hotels on the way.  Heuston Station is a good 15-20 minute walk to hotel or you could get a Luis from Heuston to Suir Road for a 6-10 minute walk.

If this hotel is in your price range I would have no hesitation in recommending it.
",5,2017,06,21
240,Hilton Dublin,"Very basic hotel, on par with a budget hotel. Rooms were very outdated. Breakfast was okay, but staff was less than helpful. All other staff seemed to be attentive. Hotel was clean, and lobby seemed to have been updated. Rooms very small. Bathroom lacked shower curtain, thus spraying water all over. Overall it was okay for two nights. Spent the days sightseeing.",3,2017,06,20
240,Great Hotel at convenient location,"Overall great place to stay with hop on hop off bus outside door and museum across street. Clean rooms, great restaurant and friendly staff. Also a nice outside patio near restaurant to sit and have a drink before or after traveling around Dublin. ",5,2017,06,20
240,Hard to mark it down really,"Struggled to do anything but have positive things to say about this hotel. Given it's location I find it hard to give it a 5 based on its sister hotel the Morrison being better in that regard.
Food good
Staff. Professional and nice 
Room. Spotless and quiet. Great view actually 
Iron in room
Wi-Fi handled my corporate vpn just fine
Bar was nice too.
I'd recommend a d will stay here again when I need to be near the train station. It is also a tiny stroll across the road to the modern art museum..",4,2017,06,19
240,Very good off-centre accomodation,"Perfect location for a visit to the Kilmainham Prison or the Museum of Modern Art, not so perfect for a city crawl in downtown Dublin (15 Eur taxi or 20 min bus needed). Nice rooms with very good beds, nice staff, very good braakfast.  Bar personell were so-so, some were attentive and gave a quick service, others hopelessly unattentive (we spent almost 30 minutes waiting for the waiter outside on the terrace, having to go inside to actually order). Also, one bar tender didn‚Äôt know what grappa is (!).",4,2017,06,19
240,Excellent,"One of the best Hilton's I have stayed in, very helpful staff, top class service. We were treated very well. You are 10 min away if you take a taxi from city centre. Is our favorite hotel in Dublin...",5,2017,06,18
240,Fair for business,"Overall more a tourist hotel
Staff are fantastic but get overwhelmed at breakfast which seemed to be more coach party than business

The hotel is 30 mins max walking to the city centre or a short taxi ride

240,Review," Looked after a very large group very well. Beautiful hotel! Lovely and cosy:) Great hospitality from Alan our waiter. Delicious food, reasonable pricing, presented very well, and enjoyed my visit :) Will definitely be back again!",5,2017,06,15
240,"stay at Hilton HOTEL,Kilmainham,Dublin","We stayed at this hotel for a nearby wedding, despite living in Dublin. We had been advised by the groom that other guests from various countries would be staying there.    It is easily accessible to many Dublin tourist sites, including Guinness Brewery, the Phoenix Park, and IMMA - Modern Art Museum, also, very close to the city, and within walking distance of a major train station.",5,2017,06,13
240,Short Dublin stay,"Stayed 2 nights, found the room to be terrific. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Good knowledge of area and things to do. Walking time into central Dublin was about 25 minutes. Close to Phoenix Park, a magnificent city park which was a great place to visit. Would recommend staying here.",5,2017,06,12
240,"Great Hotel, Great Staff","Hotel was very modern. The rooms were very comfortable and well maintained. However, the staff was the highlight of our stay here, they were VERY accommodating in every way. I would recommend this hotel very highly",5,2017,06,12
240,Kilmainham Hilton is great!,"The hotel is modern, comfortable and very clean.  The hotel staff was very friendly, attentive and provide great service.  I would highly recommend it if you are visiting Dublin.  The location is near several sites of interest if you are a tourist, yet appeared to be a favorite with business types.",5,2017,06,11
240,Excellent hotel,"The Hilton hotel at Kilmainham is very very good in all aspects, service, food, rooms and staff are faultless. Just had 3 nights there couldn't have chosen better.We were well looked after and it was nice and handy for sight seeing and taking in tours of interesting places.A big THANKS to all at the Hilton.",5,2017,06,11
240,Short stay,"We had a really good time Tuesday to Friday.The room was very comfortable and clean.Staff very helpful and friendly.The food was very good,varied and plenty of it.On a Hop-off Hop-on bus route.There was other facilities available,alas we never used them,not enough time.",5,2017,06,10
240,Fantastic Hotel,"We were delighted with our stay in Hilton Dublin Kilmainham. Check in was efficient, room was spacious, well appointed and clean. Breakfast was delicious with a wide selection to choose from. Location is great with a Dublin bike stop located outside also. We will definitely return. ",5,2017,06,10
240,Great Hotel in Dublin,"One of the best in Ireland, although a little off the beating path. Food in both the dining room and for breakfast were exceptional. All the hotel staff and servers went out of their way to provide service. The room was clean and comfortable.",5,2017,06,06
240,"Hilton Hotel Kilmainham, Dublin","Very pleasant stay, nice room, good breakfast, nice pool area.  Bus to city can be caught nearby. The area around the hotel is very pleasant . Kilmainham jail is just across the road. It is a short walk to the Phoenix Park. Guinness Brewery isn't so far away.",5,2017,06,05
240,Very good! I would stay in again.,"It was only a three nights stay but it was great. It's a easy location, not far from Heuston Station, from were you can get a Airlink bus for the airport, and also trains (LUAS) to cross some places in Dublin. If you want, you can go walking for almost all the main turistic places in Dublin. The hotel is very well organized and clean, staff is kind and helpful. Just one night, when I went to the bar to have dinner, it took some time for my order to be taken, but it was the only point to be improved. :) So, it would be great to stay here again!",4,2017,06,05
240,Excellent Trip,Great location for the Kilmainham prison and Guinness factory and easy to get into town. Service at the hotel was excellent and the facilities are lovely - would highly recommend this hotel! I am also an events coordinator and the meeting facilities great for smaller meetings. ,5,2017,06,05
240,Walking distance to many attractions,"We found this hotel to be just right for us.  We used the hop on hop off bus to get around Dublin and the stop was right outside the front door.  We were able to walk to the Guiness Storehouse, we walked home from Phoenix Park, and Kilmainham jail was right outside the front door as well.  The staff were very approachable, friendly and genuinely interested in having a conversation with us.   We ate at the restaurant in the hotel, and the meal was delicious. The hot tub was just what we needed after our long flight from Canada.  You need a bathing cap for the pool, we decided not to use the pool.  There were a few stores withing walking distance to pick up snacks or wine.  We also ate at the pub/pizza restaurant across the road and the pizza was really good.  When it was time to leave we went through to the highway with no trouble to head south to start our driving tour of Ireland.",5,2017,06,04
240,"Clean, comfortable hotel in quiet neighborhood","Overall, our family enjoyed our stay at the Hilton Dublin Kilmainham.  The rooms were clean and comfortable and the staff warm, welcoming.  The neighborhood where the hotel is located is relatively quiet making it easy to get a decent night's sleep.  

It's a dash across the street to tour the Art museum and the Kilmainham jail.  And, there's an excellent restaurant, Union 8, just two blocks away.  That said, it's more than an easy stroll to see other city sights--keep this in mind when planning your vacation budget because you will need cab money.  Grabbing a cab is easy though and almost every cab driver we came in contact with was super friendly and happy to have a conversation or to make a recommendation.

The restaurant's breakfast has an excellent buffet selection though it was a bit overpriced in our opinion.  The bistro didn't appear to stay open past 10pm but, room service was available 24 hours.

Should we return to Dublin, I would consider booking this hotel again.",4,2017,06,03
240,Clean Stay in a Quiet area of Dublin,"We enjoyed our stay at the Hilton Kilmainham in Dublin.  The staff was warm and inviting and the rooms clean and comfortable.  It's important to know that you will need to have a cab budget when staying here.  Several miles from Temple bar and City center is a bit outside of walking distance.  That said, cabs were fairly easy to hail just outside of the hotel.  We liked that it was in a quiet neighborhood away from the bustle.",4,2017,06,03
240,"Nice hotel, just needs more central location","Hotel is nice...service, amenities, great beds. Would have preferred to be more centrally located in the heart of the city. Hotel is directly across the street from Kilmainham Gaol Museum, a main tourist attraction. Yet, it is not near an ATM, shopping. Breakfast is full service buffet and excellent.",3,2017,06,02
240,First Dublin visit,"Used the 3 day Green line Hop on Hop off bus pass. Very easy to navigate on. From the airport went to the end of the line, the train station. Didn't have a lot of luggage so we walked to the hotel from there, 10 minutes. Hotel has restaurants, pubs and bus stops nearby.  Had a great stay, a little spendy. ",5,2017,05,31
240,Excellent 3-night stay,"Two-person front desk welcomes you. All very professional, and the staff are helpful with any questions you may have.
If flying into Dublin, from airport, use Airlink 747 bus to Heuston Rail Station, then take a twenty minute walk to hotel, or use a taxi from outside rail station.
Hilton Kilmainham is a quiet hotel away from the hussle and bustle of Dublin city centre, but with a bus stop less than five minutes walk and each number 13 or 40 bus just 10-20 minutes apart, access to O'Connell Street/Temple Bar/city centre is easy.
Breakfast was self service hot and cold meals, all laid out well in a nice and large restaurant room.
We ate at the hotel for two evenings in the Broyage bar and bistro. Chicken Tikka Masala (‚Ç¨14.95, see photo) was tasty and piping hot.
Kilmainham Gaol is across the road, which was convenient, and there is a Hop on/hop off bus stop outside too for access to the main tours.
Irish National War Memorial Gardens are just down the road, and are such a peaceful and quiet place.",5,2017,05,29
240,Pleasant hotel stay,"The hotel location is very convenient and allows for a lot of sight seeing without the use of a car. The staff was friendly and very accommodating.  Rooms are neat and welcoming. Would definitely use Hilton Kilmainham should I return to Dublin, whether on business or personal travel. 
",5,2017,05,29
240,Some of the best staff I've seen.,"Really enjoyed our stay here.  The staff was SO helpful, friendly, and seemed to jump at every chance to go the extra mile.  Location is in a great neighborhood at what I'd consider the ""western end"" of the main attractions. Easy to take the bus to the eastern end (Trinity College) and walk back towards the hotel to hit just about every major spot. Highly recommended. ",5,2017,05,29
240,Marvelous trip in May,"Extremely helpful and accommodating staff. Lots of gluten free options at breakfast. Lovely property and comfy beds. My husband and I lost track of days and accidentally went down to breakfast too late one day and they help us out anyway. Provided us with a plate of pastries, fruit, yogurt and juice. So kind!",5,2017,05,26
240,Very accommodating,"We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel. It is not in the main city, however everything imaginable is just a short walk. We will definitely return for our next visit. The Kilmainham Jail tour across the street is a must. The staff is very welcoming and helpful. They recommended a tour of Belfast to us that we could not have enjoyed anymore. ",5,2017,05,25
240,A Taste Of Ireland,"If you are like me and have always wanted to visit Ireland and experience Irish culture, Dublin is the place to go. You will stay in Old Town across the street from a historical jail. The view is magnificent, the people are unbelievably nice, and one of the best restaurants is located at your feet, on the first floor. Hilton Dublin's staff is superior in their work and the biggest thank you goes to Fiona Morrissey (Reservation Coordinator) who truly made this stay magical!",5,2017,05,24
240,Great service and great hotel!,"A bit far to get to the city. Buses and trains not so easy to find (bad signing) But fantastic hotel staff, especially by the reception. We were on our one year wedding anniversary, and were given a larger room than ordered and surprised by a nice gift and sweet words from the staff. Recommendable!",5,2017,05,23
240,Fantastic stay .. Will def return.  Ideal situ right beside hop on n off bus stops.  Lovely outside seating area.,Amazing place with fabulous staff. Cleanliness perfect.  Great quiet room.  Spacious upgrade. Good amazing. Location next to the hop on n off bus stop very handy.  Pub opposite brill for real Irish Craic. Loved our stay 10/10.,5,2017,05,22
240,Two nights at the Hilton Kilmainham,"The hotel staff were very welcoming, from the booking stage on, and during my stay. The breakfasts were excellent, with good food choices. My room was reasonably sized, with a comfortable king-size bed. ",5,2017,05,22
240,Nice Hotel / Convenient Location,"Visited the Hilton in Kilmainham for two days. Arrived in Dublin early on a Saturday morning. Sebastian at check in was kind enough to find an available room for early check in and gave us several suggestions for things to do around the area and directions in how to get there. His kindness was greatly appreciated after a long overnight flight!  The hotel is located within easy walking distance to the Guinness Storehouse and is right across the street from the Kilmainham Gaol museum. Also, just a short walk (about 5-10 min) to Luas Red Line with frequent trains heading into downtown Dublin. 

The hotel was about a 25 Euro taxi ride from the airport. Rooms were on the small side, but very quiet, comfortable, and nicely furnished. Right across the street from the Patriot Inn (nice pub) and about 2-3 blocks straight down the street to a wonderful bakery and coffee shop. 

Will stay here again on the next visit to Dublin for the location, convenience, and customer service!",5,2017,05,20
240,Outstanding!,"Outstanding all around, food, service, fitness, area of hotel, room- all excellent! Breakfast was very good with lots of options. Loved the steam room and fitness center. Front desk was very helpful. Will definitely stay here again.",5,2017,05,20
240,Oasis of comfort in Dublin,"We came straight from the airport and spent the rest of the day relaxing. We managed only to venture out for dinner later.

The room was very comfortable and had the usual Hilton amenities. The Staff was super helpful and gave us some good recommendations for taxi and dining support. In particular we'd like to give Shauna at the front desk a big shout out.

The food in the hotel was outstanding. Some the best scrambled eggs I've had in many a long year.

One caution- the tub/shower is a death trap if you are a large person-as I am. It is very narrow at the bottom and you can easily lose your balance turning as you shower. Be careful!

It also has a nice SPA.",5,2017,05,19
240,Solid service in a great Kilmainham location,"My organization held a meeting at the Hilton Dublin Kilmainham and found the property to be small, well situated across from the Old Kilmainham Gaol and the Irish Museum of Modern Art, and staffed with very attentive and helpful employees.  The breakfast buffet featured items for a full Irish breakfast, rotated often and prepared well.  In the afternoon and evening the cafe and bar did a brisk business with good food.  Rooms were clean and spacious, with some tremendous views on the upper floors.  The front desk staff was very knowledgeable about the area and were on top of any requests.  Sales staff and banquets staff worked well together on our meeting, though the banquet food was average rather than a knockout.  For tourists, the Hop-on Hop-off bus companies all had a stop directly across the street in front of the Gaol.  Overall, a good choice for travel to Dublin for business or pleasure.  The property itself would be enough, but the excellent staff takes it that one step further.",4,2017,05,17
240,Friendly Staff Nice Hotel,We arrived before checkin. Staff was friendly and stored our bags no problem.  They also recommended the tour bus that picks up right outside.  Hotel is also a short walk from the Guinness Factory.  Room was clean and had a good view of the street.  Elevator goes right into parking garage.  Restaurant onsite.  Offered a nice breakfast.   ,5,2017,05,17
240,Amazing hospitality from an up market chain,"We stayed at this hotel for two nights - one at the start of a weeks holiday in Ireland & the other on the way back home. Hilton hotels by the mere nature of their size will get mixed reviews but we had a great time here on both occasions. The rooms are more than adequate & extremely comfortable & well appointed. The reception was as warm a welcome as you would find any where enhanced of course by the Irish desire to ensure your stay is as memorable as they can make it!

The food both in the restaurant & room service at breakfast & dinner was outstanding & is comparable to any five star eatery that we have visited over the years - well done people keep up the good work!

The location is ideal - put your car in the underground car park & jump on the ""hop on hop off "" bus service that stops just accross the road outside the jail!

All in all an excellent location for a stop off prior to exploring Ireland & a great idean for an extra night befor the 14.30 ferry back home!",5,2017,05,15
240,Vacation in Ireland,What a great place to stay. A beautiful hotel with a fantastic staff. Be sure to bring your own bathing cap! You will want to go to the pool. The restaurant was also a wonderful experience and the breakfast was exceptional - did I mention they had honey comb? Plan to stay here and have a great time.,5,2017,05,15
240,Super room with a great view.,"I stayed there for a conference, what an amazing location right across the road from the famous Kilmainham Gaol and Hospital. Staff were very professional and a polished service was experienced. Breakfast was good and a buffet was served as part of the conference which was very good.",5,2017,05,14
240,Birthday present to boyfriend ,"I booked a three night stay in Dublin for my boyfriend and I, his birthday choice. The hotel had mixed reviews so open mind required and we were both more than happy with hotel. Old Kilmainham is out of Dublin city but no hassle to travel in and out, taxi ride right outside hotel. Hope and off buses across the road, cheap tickets and down the road round the corner is every day bus stop also cheap. We were on second floor and the room big enough for two. Was clean bit marked here and there but nothing to worry about and I have o c d. Breakfast is help your self buffet, hot and cold, no complaints. I had omelette twice, fresh and hot. Unlimited tea and coffee. We also had evening dinner twice, again all fresh cooked and hot. Bottle of wine expensive but Dublin prices so don't pay it you don't want to. Air con in room didn't work, staff offered to move us but I wasn't bothered, they put a fan in room which worked for me at night blowing cool air around. I should have said was boyfriend fifty birthday might have been upgraded, but I didn't. We were given drinks vouchers for air con and we used them in bar. Chocolate present delivered to room for boyfriend which he enjoyed. We would stay here again, it's a really good hotel and staff very helpful.  This morning we got a taxi to airport but use the buses as on door step.  ",5,2017,05,14
240,Outstanding,"This hotel has fantastic staff, it is comfortable, uplifting, friendly, clean, bar was great, food was great, great choices for different meals, price was right. Excellent ! This was a terrific experience and highly recommended.",5,2017,05,13
240,Excellent Hilton ,"We spent one night here after arriving in Ireland. I chose the hotel so we would be close to Heustin Station for an early morning train. It is an easy 20 minute walk to the station. All of the staff members we met were extremely helpful and friendly. A special thank you to Ana for moving us to a room with a balcony so we could enjoy the pleasant weather and view of the park. Our room was clean, spacious and comfortable with nice travel amenities. I highly recommend this Hilton. ",5,2017,05,13
240,Excellent,Great location as situated right beside kilmainham gaol which we were doing a tour of. Also a short 20 minute walk to the city centre. Staff are friendly and helpful. The breakfast was good and the buffet style is very convenient with plenty of choices.,5,2017,05,11
240,Irish world dance,The hotel was awesome! Friendly stuff went out of there way for us!!! The breakfast was great!! We had dinner about 3 nights at the hotel and it was wonderful and our waiters were great!! I would recommend this hotel!!!,5,2017,05,10
240,Sunny evening in Kilmainham,We were acknowledged by Renata immediately we arrived using the car park lift. Lovely room overlooking the city. Comfortable bed. Lovely touch to have face cloths in bathroom. Limited selection for evening meal. Selection Very convenient location. Short walk to Luas. Fantastic self service breakfast with vast variety of food available. Didn't use the leisure centre.,5,2017,05,10
240,great place,"We booked a deluxe room and stayed 3 nights.  Bed very comfortable.  Staff all very good and friendly.  Taxis arrived in minutes, so getting into town very quick.

Room service was excellent and all food arrived hot and was very nice indeed!  

Room had an office area with seating and a balcony.  Road noise can be an issue but that's most places in Dublin - traffic is heavy all the time.

Situated right across from a lovely park and a short walk to a museum.

One of our best hotel stays.",5,2017,05,09
240,Work ,"Cody at the restaurant was excellent! Front desk ppl very helpful and comfortable rooms! Try to stay on 4th floor. Breakfasts are delicious and homemade omelettes! Gym is okay doesn't open until 6:30a which was a little annoying.
Location is fantastic!",5,2017,05,07
240,"Good, but other Hiltons are better","I was offered a family room, hence 3 beds, I do not believe I booked that, hence I believe it was what was available and indeed this room may not get used too often, since a few things did not work right, which is not to the Hilton standard I know. Having said that it is a very nice place, good service and good food. The breakfast room is quite dark on a cloudy morning with its curtains drawn, it would be easy to improve that.
I may come back here, I hope things will work better next time.",4,2017,05,07
240,Relaxing and Great Breakfast,I enjoyed my stay at the  Hilton Kilmainham. The location is near tourism spots and hop on/off bus is across the street. The breakfast was outstanding and customer service was excellent with providing a map for touring around the city and complementary breakfast as an early arrival. My room was prepared and ready by 10:30am. I ordered room service my last night and my order wasn't correct but the chef and management rectified the situation promptly and comp'ed my dessert.,4,2017,05,07
240,Great Hotel,"Great Hotel across from the infamous Jail! The front desk staff, Emma and , manager Fiona, cannot do enough to help you with anything in the hotel or tour or restaurant advice. In the restaurant, Hugo the manager, Monica and Cody our server are first rate , pleasant and make you feel as if you've known them long time! At night ice is from the bar and the bar tenders cheerfully fill your bucket or glasses with ice. The breakfast buffet is quite good, dinner or lunch little Hilton pricey.
Easy to walk a few blocks for bus or light rail service, the Jail and on/off bus stops across the street. The neighborhood is very nice with a small bakery, coffee shop, cleaners and pharmacy as well as pizza less than a 5 minute walk.

A taxi to the Molly Malone statue downtown early in the day is about 12-15 Euros to meet a tour bus, be on time they leave exactly as they tell you. We had no issues.",5,2017,05,07
240,Great spot for a visit to Dublin ,"Had a great visit to Dublin staying in the Hilton. 

Check in was quick and friendly. The room was great, very quite with nothing to prevent a good nights sleep. 

There are quite a few things to visit very close to the hotel, the modern art museum, Kilmainham gaol across the road, and the Guinness store house within walking distance. 

Buses and the Luas are available for easy access to town. And Houston station is within walking distance. 

The hotel itself has a nice casual restaurant, with the staff in the very decent bar friendly and professional. 

There was a good spread at breakfast everything nicely cooked with good coffee available. 

All in all a great hotel choice in Dublin. ",5,2017,05,06
240,Good business hotel,The location is a bit outside the city. I will take a 10-15 minutes cab ride to the downtown locations. The guiness brewery and the nearby business locations like the digital hub can also be reached in a 10 minutes walk.,4,2017,05,03
240,Great Hotel,The staff was great and friendly.  Breakfast tons of options.  The only issue I had was the hot hot water for the shower.  Rooms were clean and comfortable.  Definitely would stay again.  Not in the city center but not far away.,5,2017,05,02
240,Made our anniversary special,We were thrilled to have champagne and chocolates delivered to our door with an anniversary card from the staff. We were made to feel very special during our stay. The buffet breakfast was superb. Hot tub and sauna were very relaxing.,5,2017,05,02
240,Part of Dublin Stay,"Good location, quite close to city centre. What pleases is the parking available under the hotel premises, even though at little higher side on price for parking ¬£12 per night. Rooms are nice & clean. Big rooms, with big beds, nicely taken care of.

Big low point...we stayed for 4 nights god the breakfast was same every morning...No whatsoever effort to have little change :-))
Staff were average helpful. They would assist only to the level of their comfort, nothing going out of the way to make you feel that they are super helpful.
At the pool I was asked to wear swim cap which I had to buy for ¬£2, where I noticed no one else was imposed to wear one. I was the only one who paid & wore a swim cap..I dont know may be the guy at swimming pool didnt like my Indian skin colour :-))",3,2017,05,01
240,Nice hotel friendly staff parking charge ‚Ç¨20!!,"The one thing for sure is the staff in all departments were very friendly and extremely helpful. A credit. Food really nice. Room standard hotel room. Comfortable. The one letdown, a ‚Ç¨20 parking charge. This is double the charge of a neighbouring hotel and not advertised! A shame.",4,2017,04,29
240,Great quiet place for Dublin visit,"This hotel is a perfect quiet retreat,  with easy access to the heart of Dublin. The Guinness Storehouse is within walking distance as is some nice pubs and local restaurants. The staff was great, room was perfect and breakfast was a good start to the day.  We used the yellow Hop-on/Hop-Off as our transport around Dublin. The red bus seemed to have more buses but you can buy the yellow bus tickets in the hotel lobby. The staff was very helpful and friendly. 

Union 8 (just out  the front door and down the street) was a great place for a nice dinner with great food and drinks. They had a jazz guitar duo playing on a Sunday night which really made the place come alive but yet conversation was still possible. Best meal in Dublin",5,2017,04,28
240,Excellent Hilton in Dublin,"Compared to the Hilton hotel in Dublin centre, this Hilton hotel in Kilmainham is a much better option. The hotel is clean, has nicely renovated rooms with a nice view and a well equipped gym+leisure centre. 

Staff in this hotel is friendly and the atmosphere is great. The newly renovated bar is nice and I appreciated a lot the free upgrade the hotel gave me as a Gold HHonors member. I look forward to come back next month and would recommend this Hilton to those who want to make a trip to Dublin a nice one.",5,2017,04,28
240,Birthday break,"Stayed for two nights while in Dublin for my birthday. Found the location of the hotel good as we didn't want to be right in the centre of Dublin. On arrival the reception manager (Ana I think?) was so welcoming and provided us with lots of helpful information including best transport options etc to get to a concert that night. As it was my birthday I received complimentary chocolates at check in which was a nice touch. 
Our room 208 was perfect! The bed was large and very comfortable and I loved that the maid's had put our towels into shapes of swans, nice touch! Only one problem I had with the room is that the iron was useless, it really needs replaced! 
Even though room itself was good, both mornings we where unable to sleep past 7am due to the loud banging etc in the corridor by house keeping staff. Part of coming away to relax is being able to lie in. On check out I informed the receptionist about the disturbed sleep, he could not care less that our stay was impacted by this and made no effort to apologise or anything! 

We opted for breakfast at ‚Ç¨15 each per day, selection was good. It was good to see they had a gluten free cereal etc but they didn't offer any gluten free sausages etc which most other 4*do. No soy milk out so had to ask for it each morning then wait 10mins+ for it to arrive, they also had no dairy free spread which was disappointing. 

Dined in the Bar bistro both nights and the food was brilliant! I had steak both nights which was cooked to perfection! We did have a bit of a wait on our food, but because of the quality you understood the wait! On good Friday during the dinner I had asked for one glass of wine (we had been informed on check in that as residents we could have a drink with our meal) other tables had been served no problem bottles of wine etc but I then felt interrogated by the waiter when I asked for it, he was very unpleasant and made us feel so uncomfortable, I informed him of our room number but he continued to question us about when we where checking out etc which was not relevant!

Overall amenities are good including the pool but the overall service we received was not that of a 4* hotel and unfortunately we will not return.",3,2017,04,26
240,Quiet location,"Really quiet hotel, no outside noise despite being near a main road. Kilmainham prison was a great visit, plus the local park area. Food was great, and the cocktails! Taxi prices varied tho, which is really annoying as we felt we were being conned as tourists. Same trip into to town cost our local friends 10 Euro, but we paid 15!",5,2017,04,25
240,Good location and nice breakfast,"It is not in the city centre but it only takes about 10 minutes walk to the Heuston Station. I stayed for the Placebo 20 years tour at the 3Arena in Dec 2016. I couldn't find any good hotels available at that time. Hilton Dublin Kilmainham was the best choice since I could take the Luas from the venue back to the hotel after the gig. The breakfast was very good with a variety of food and drinks.
By the way, the Irish Museum of Modern Art is worth visiting and the park is also very beautiful.",5,2017,04,23
240,"Great location, with superb service, lovely spa and excellent rooms","Was very pleased with the excellent location.  It was about a 10 minute walk from Heuston Station.  Directly across from the historic Kilmainham Jail Musuem,  and IMA art Museum.  

The staff was very friendly and helpful.  The breakfast was excellent, with lots of local choices.

The pool, steam room and sauna felt great after  touring around in the cold weather.  

The rooms were spacious, clean, well maintained and very comfortable.",5,2017,04,22
240,Short stay,Great quite location hop on hop off bus stopped right outside hotel. Food expensive but nice so was the cocktails.  Hotel quiet and even though on main road heard no traffic in room. Would stay again if in the area. ,4,2017,04,21
240,First Class,Stayed for one night in one of the suites - I cannot comment on the price as it was paid by 'air miles'.  Reception staff were very efficient and even though we were early a room was available. The room was large with a balcony with views over the jail and city. The bed very comfortable The bedroom and bathroom were spotless. We ate in the bar/bistro in the evening and was served by a great Italian waitress who  was friendly and efficient.  Breakfast the next morning was very good with a good range of hot and cold food.  Set a way outside the city centre it is served by buses and benefits from being quiet in the evenings away from the bustle of the centre.,5,2017,04,21
240,Very Nice,"Great hotel and a lovely location - easy access to transportation hubs.  We walked from Heuston Train Station the first time, then took cabs/Uber after that.  We also walked to the Suir train for access to other parts of Dublin.  The breakfast is wonderful and the rooms are comfortable and very clean.",5,2017,04,19
240,Conference Venue,"Hosted a large conference here. At every stage, from before the conference to the day of the event, all the staff were very helpful. They often went out of their way to help and catered for our ever changing needs.

Conference delegates also commented on how good the pastries / biscuits were.
Venue had free wifi.",5,2017,04,17
240,Great location near city,Location of the hotel was outside the city centre but conveniently located for easy access with hop on/off busess right across street and Kilmainhan Gaol right nearby. Quiet morning activity outside of hotel. Excellent staff and room was clean and spacious.,5,2017,04,17
240,Wonderful hotel!,"We just returned from Dublin. We chose this hotel because we wanted to be in the quieter part of Dublin, and Kilmainham neighborhood fit the bill perfectly. There are so many beautiful spots within 15-20 minutes walk, and yet the downtown is not far at all. The staff are incredibly helpful and flexible and went out of their way to accommodate us. Service is prompt and thorough. Hydrotherapy pool, sauna and steam room were greatly appreciated after a day full of walking or hiking. Breakfast was just superb - our kids were raving about made-to-order cr√™pes every morning. I can't think of anything that wasn't a good experience. We would always go back.",5,2017,04,17
240,"nice hotel, good location depending on what your requirements are","I choose this hotel because a lot of the reviews of the city centre hotels complained about the noise. With this being a short distance from the city centre I thought the noise would be less at night. I was correct it was lovely and peaceful in the area. One of the best things about this hotels location is the proximity to Kilmainham Gaol. In the morning there is a limited amount of tickets sold in the morning on a first come first serve basis. We could watch from the window and monitor the queue. At 08.45 we joined the start of a small queue of around 10 people. 15-20 minutes later the queue was around 50-60 people. 

Breakfast was lovely and we ate dinner one night in the restaurant/bar and it was also really good. We made use of the spa facilities which was really welcomed after the moderately long walk into the city centre and back! It takes around 45 minutes to walk to the city centre. Lots of interesting things to see on the way. A taxi cost around ¬£10 euro to the city centre. 

Apart from a problem with the water shutting off the stay was perfect.",4,2017,04,17
240,Great Hotel and helpful staff,Nice hotel with very helpful staff. Good location and facilities. Restaurant is reasonably priced and good quality. Pool and gym are nice but it's not really for swimming but it is a nice place to relax.,5,2017,04,15
240,Night to attend concert,Fabulous hotel. Staff extremely friendly and helpful. We arrived early and were given a free drink while we waited for room. Bar and restaurant great. Cocktails lovely and food excellent. Room was spacious and very comfortable.  I'm definitely going to buy Hilton hotel pillows.great nights sleep. Pool was relaxing. Breakfast very good.  Would definitely recommend this hotel.,5,2017,04,15
240,Very nice Hotel in Downtown Dublin!,"Close to major destinations. Very CLEAN location! Awesome view! Nice, Modern, and a very relaxing accommodations. Close to public transportation and has parking garage attached to the hotel, for a nominal fee.",5,2017,04,14
240,Great stay in a lovely hotel,"I stayed here for two nights and really enjoyed the stay.  All the staff are very friendly and professional.  The front office staff deserve particular recognition, at check in and every time we went to enquire about something they took time to talk to us, give information and to provide highly personalized service. The room was spacious and comfortable with just a bit of traffic noise from the road outside, but this did not interfere with sleep. At breakfast we ordered coffee, which never came. We also wanted to order some food items from the menu but couldn't attract the attention of the service staff so gave up in the end. But apart from this minor problem the food was delicious and well cooked. The location of the hotel is fine being right next to Kilmainham jail and a few other tourist sights. If I were to return to Dublin I would definitely stay again.",5,2017,04,14
240,Great Modern Hotel,"I loved this hotel, the location right next to the Gaol Kilmainham and the Guinness Storehouse and a short walk to the main shopping district made this the perfect hotel to experience Dublin.  The service was great and our room was very nice.",5,2017,04,13
240,Another comfortable break,"This is the seventh time I have stayed at this hotel, which speaks volumes in itself.   It is very well located as I took part in the Great Ireland run in P{hedonic park which is a 15 minute walk from the hotel. The park also is the location for the Dublin Zoo. Also located nearby is the Kilmainham Gaol and a 10 minute walk to the Luas stop at Suir Road.  The rooms are, as you would expect clean and very well presented. The hotel allows you to select your room prior to arrival so there are no surprises.  There is a gym and pool attached to the hotel accessed by the lifts which is a great facility and free to residents.  The bar is a welcoming place and serves excellent food at any time of day.  I would recommend this hotel without a doubt. It is supported by friendly staff where no job is too small.",5,2017,04,13
240,awesome hotel,we enjoyed our stay at the Kilmainhim I wish I would have booked 2 nights instead of just 1. Perfect location close enough to town for 12 euro taxi to center of dublin. far enough away quiet. convenient to airport and parking. definitely coming back. nice pool/spa. great food.,5,2017,04,12
240,resteraunt,the service n food where excellent the staff where helpful n very friendly very family friendly even thought there was ten in our number all where served at the same time cant praise them enough food was delicious,5,2017,04,11
240,Nice location,"Excellent location, beside the IMMA, Phoenix park, Kilmainham Jail. Also close to a nice restaurant Union 8.

They have done up the bar since I was last there and really helps the atmosphere. 
Staff are really friendly and helpful. All in all a really nice hotel for both business and pleasure.",4,2017,04,11
240,really nice,staff were lovely. Room was clean and comfortable. Bed was huge. Breakfast selection was extensive. Far enough out of town to be quiet yet close enough to get into the city easily. Would recommend happily.,5,2017,04,11
240,Awesome stay,The location of this hotel makes sight seeing in the areas easy. But the hotel staff and rooms are all awesome. They have a make it right policy there that they strive to ensure that you are well taken care of on your trip. Well worth the money would plan to stay there again.,5,2017,04,10
240,My favourite Hilton,"This Hilton is one of the best around, if not the best.  The rooms are exceptionally well finished and comfortable, the bathroom is huge and the staff really friendly and helpful. To top it all the choice at breakfast is outstanding with many thoughtful touches.  Parking is easy in the hotel's underground car park and great for transport as all the hop on/hop off buses stop at Kilmainham Gaol directly opposite the front door.  The closest Luas tram stop is just 10 minutes walk away, so you can be in the city centre in no time. ",5,2017,04,09
240,Nice hotel but noise unacceptable ,"Stayed 2 nights at the Hilton Kilmainham. Found it a nice hotel in general. Room was on top floor (5). The noise from the fans on the roof sounded like a helicopter was landing for most of the night making it difficult to sleep . The staff seemed to be aware of this when we mentioned it but offered no solution.
Breakfast was good. Bar food average.",2,2017,04,09
240,Short break with Family ,"Stayed at the Hilton Kilmainham for 2 nights with the family. Arrived a little early so had to sit at the bar till our room was ready for us. The service at this point wasn't great and had to approach a waiter to be served. Not sure whether they were short staffed but our drinks took 30 minutes to arrive and this was after continuously staring at the waiter who didn't bother to apologise for the delay.
After an hour I returned to the receptionist who stated she was just about to come for us ... and I started to worry about our short break...
We were checked into a room on the 3rd floor but both keys didn't work the 1st time round so had to return back to reception to get them to work.....
The room and bathroom was clean and the king bed was comfortable but the sofa bed my daughter slept on sunk in ... soon as she sat on it.
The fridge had 2 small bottles of complimentary water.. one still and the other carbonated even though we were a family of 4. Also had to request for more bath towels which was not an issue at this point.
We decided to go out for dinner as I didn't feel we would get a good service after the experience we just had. 
Breakfast next morning was fantastic. We were seated and served by a waiter called Monika. Very cautious and pleasant and interacted well with the kids! They need more of her kind. 
The next evening we decided to sit at the bar for a while before bedtime. Service was okay as it was also busy. I decided to request at the reception if we could have more drinking water in the room and was told to request at the bar and state that the receptionist had sent me. Not sure if this was the right thing to do.... after speaking to one of the waiters.. I was made to feel like I made it all up. He stated I needed to sign for it and it would be charged to the room. I then asked to speak to someone else but the waiter shook his head implying that I may be having issues... So I asked him to follow me to the reception and confirm what I was saying... he did... and I got 1 big bottle of WATER!
I had never experienced this kind of treatment in the many places I have been to so my partner had to put in a complaint to the manager....

We did also use their facilities.. there's a gym, hydrotherapy pool and a jacuzzi. The kids enjoyed the hydrotherapy pool more but a swimming hat is required and can be purchased for ‚Ç¨2. Towels are also provided for use at the pool.

There is underground parking for ‚Ç¨12 a day which is why we chose the hotel in the first place.. There is a tour bus stop just outside the hotel and the Kilmainham jail is only a few minutes walk and so us the Guinness factory.. Dublin Zoo is a 10 minute drive and you can get a ‚Ç¨2 off complimentary card for the zoo at the reception... this came very handy..

Not sure if u would stay here again 
After my experience but would definitely recommend the buffet breakfast.

",3,2017,04,09
240,"Amazing place, amazing people","What was supposed to be a simple relaxing trip became a fun and inspiring roller coaster of fun and exploration throughout Dublin. And I have to thank the Kilmainham Hilton staff, especially Sebastian, who gave me precious tidbits on how to live my Irish experience to the fullest.

I must confess I was worried about the local cuisine, but the Broyage bar had great food (and drinks) and was a welcomed sight when I came ""home"" after a day of sightseeing.",5,2017,04,08
240,Excellent place,"Really good place to stay. I mean excellent. The staff are all really friendly and very helpful from checking in, directions, cool places to go see, and even checking out of the hotel was easy. Also it's not far from Guinness brewery. ",5,2017,04,06
240,"A welcoming, friendly hotel",The Hilton Killmainham is a friendly and welcoming hotel. The staff are always open and helpful and ready to provide all that any guest might require. The rooms are clean and well presented and well equipped. Wifi is avaialble and complementary.  Food is great and location very handy for 2 local parks and the ancient goal.,5,2017,04,04
240,Very pleased,"I stayed in Hilton, Kilmainham, Dublin on Thursday the 30th of March. It's my first time staying in this hotel in over 18 months and I was very pleased with my stay. The staff were very helpful when I arrived even though I was 3hrs later than my planned arrival time. The bar/bistro has been changed, much nicer and not at cold and clinical as before. Food was good and service was very good. Room was as you'd expect in a Hilton, very clean, spacious and comfortable. All in all and very pleasant stay. I'll be back soon",5,2017,04,03
240,Couldn't fault a thing,"Having worked in hospitality for years, I was very impressed with the Hilton Kilmainham. Problem-free check in, incredible room with all the facilities you could need. Huge selection of food for breakfast, and other meals I had were also great. The only drawbacks were the prices for bar food, it really is very expensive for a simple evening meal. The pool is also more of a relaxation facility than an exercise one; you can't swim a proper length. Good to know that in advance. But other than that, everything was flawless about my stay, including all of the facilities on offer for the meetings and workshops I was attending. In particular, the housekeeping and breakfast staff deserve a mention. I was in the first floor and my room faced the main road, but I couldn't hear a thing. Loved it!",5,2017,04,03
240,Excellent,"Beautiful hotel. Close to luas line. Kilmainham jail on the doorstep. Food fab and very helpful staff. Lovely little Italian restaurant across the street too. Was lovely, cosy and lovely staff there too",5,2017,03,28
240,Excellent stay,The hotel staff were extremely friendly. The hotel itself was comfortable and close to so much. Food and service was 100. Definitely I will stay here again on another visit to Dublin which I plan soon,5,2017,03,27
240,"Excellent hotel ,super staff","We spent a night in the hotel last week.Everything was as expected: friendly and efficient check in,comfortable bedroom which was spotlessly clean , comfortable bed and a first class breakfast. The staff were all pleasant but a special mention for Cordelia from the household staff who went out of her way to help with a request .We would highly recommend this hotel",5,2017,03,26
240,Ireland v England rugby weekend,"A wonderful weekend in a great hotel, where staff went out of their way to provide us with a wonderful experience. WE received a room upgrade to cater for 3 girls in one room, which we felt was a very generous gesture. We received free drinks vouchers. Overall we felt that we were really well looked after and made to feel very welcome.",5,2017,03,24
240,Excellent Stay,We stayed there for two days during a visit to Ireland.  The hotel is located right next to the Kilmainham Jail which has a great tour.  It is within a twenty minute or so walk to Guinness Brewery and the shopping and food area along the river.  They have a great bar and breakfast. The rooms were clean and the staff could not have been nicer or more helpful.  Two thumbs up.,5,2017,03,23
240,Excellent as home away from home,"I spent multiple weeks in the hotel - it is very easy and comfortable. With weather in Dublin, it is great to have a relaxed restaurant with great food and service, health club with pool and well equipped large rooms, and fast efficient room service when you don't even want to leave the room. Can feel like home. Very nice warm welcome at front desk and all staff friendly and accommodating. The hotel is an easy walk to Heuston station and Luas, via a nice park around the modern art museum complete with outdoor art by Julien Opie. The hotel is across the road from the Kilmainham Gaol, which I did not have a chance to visit. Short walk to Guinness and I walked downtown and back a number of times e.g. Grafton St., Spire, Molly Malone. Taxis are also very good and usually available right away at the hotel. All in all a great experience staying here (I ""tried"" about 5 different rooms all very nice with great beds, fridge and a coffee machine). The breakfast buffet cannot be beat. ",5,2017,03,22
240,Excelent stay!!!,"From the begining until the end our stay was amazing. Very easy and fast check-in with Sebastian, who explained us everything that we needed to know. Look for Bruno when you are in Broyage Bistro, he gave us very good recommendations for the dinner. Room was very big, nice and clean with a private balcony.
We will be back for sure!!!",5,2017,03,20
240,Good choice,A bit west of the main part of Dublin but very easy to get to City Center on the 13 or 40 bus line (15 minutes).  Staff is EXTREMELY friendly and helpful.  Pool was a nice perk for our 10-year old but be sure to bring a swimming cap or be prepared to pay 2 Euros for one.  Restaurant/bar was just fine with a good selection of beer (even schwag like Bud and Coors Light but please don't go to Dublin to drink American macro-swill!).  Only warning is that the shower seems to have a mind of its own and will go from extremely hot to extremely cold and back again with little warning.,5,2017,03,19
240,Nice hotel quiet location ,"Nice hotel. Great staff. The rooms are comfortable. Great beds. There is Hair dryer in the room. 
The location is not near the city center of action but it is located right across the street from the Gaul prison tour and gardens. there is a hop on hop off bus stop nearby. There are some restaurants and pubs within walking distances. There is not an airport shuttle . Depending on traffic, The Dublin airport is about a twenty min car ride. 
We ate at the hotel restaurant and the food was  good and the service was attentive.",4,2017,03,19
240,The best and easiest check in process ,"We just check in and I was so amazed with check in that I decided to write a comment. Very easy, fast and with all the details that you need for your stay. Thank you Sebastian on your warm welcome.

Very good start. We hope that the rest of our stay will be as good as the check in! :)
",5,2017,03,19
240,Fantastic staff,"Had a short break in Dublin and stayed at this hotel, from the moment we arrived until we left the staff could not do enough for us.
Rooms were are a good size, very clean and had tea and coffee facilities in the room, along with a safe and free wifi throughout the hotel.
Breakfasts were excellent with a wide variety to choose from (buffet service)  .
I could not fault the hotel one bit, however the location was not the best as it was 3.2km to temple bar area of the city, however the hop on and off bus did stop outside, but finished running around 5.30pm",5,2017,03,18
240,Good hotel & solid breakfast,Wonderful hotel!   This location is not in the center of town but lots of neat stuff is nearby.  The breakfast is great.  The pool is kind of dark & unusual but I guess that's what you get in Dublin.  If you can buy a family all-train/bus pass you can really get around town from this location.,4,2017,03,13
240,Perfect stay for a Dublin visit,"Located opposite of kilmainham goal and the museum of modern arts at a not to crowded crossing. The connection to city centre via bus is fast and reliable (5 minutes walk, 15 min ride, 2,70‚Ç¨, approx. 11‚Ç¨ by cab)
The house is perfectly clean, well equipped. Great breakfast. 
The missing fifth star is due too the overall a little dated interior - nevertheless the beds are fantastic ",4,2017,03,12
240,Simply Amazing!,I'm a massive fan of excellent customer service. This is probably the most important factor for me when booking hotels. The Hilton Dublin Kilmainham ALWAYS exceed my expectations. I have stayed there 3 times already and will be back soon.,5,2017,03,12
240,"Brilliant hotel, lovely staff - will be back!","I booked the hotel for 2 nights in March (9th and 10th). We were going to the c2c festival on the Friday at the three arena but we were also there for a relaxing break for my husband's 30th birthday. We arrived very early and had hoped to leave our bags at reception and then do some sightseeing but the lady on reception checked if our room was ready and gave us our key more than 3 hours early!she was very helpful (sorry, don't know her name). The room was a king room, 426 and very nice and clean too. The only issue we had was a loud bang every 10 or so minutes the first night. In hindsight we should have called reception but did advise on checkout and we were satisfied with the outcome (again, same lady who checked us in) so have not removed a star for this. The pool is nice, quiet and relaxing. You need to buy a swim hat to use the pool but it's not expensive! We had breakfast both days and it's a buffet with plenty of selection. It's very easy to get around, the luas (tram) is nearby and the tour buses stop outside the hotel. I'd recommend the yellow cityscape bus. To get to the hotel we got the 747 bus from the airport to Heuston station and then walked but you can actually get a taxi, the luas or a tour bus if you prefer. Staff are very friendly and helpful at the hotel. Would definitely recommend the hotel and will be back. Thanks for a great stay!",5,2017,03,12
240,Stunning hotel,"Absolutely Love this hotel, one of best hotels I've ever stayed! Everything awas amazing staff, rooms , breakfast and dinner. I honestly could not fault anything! Will definitely be staying here for further trips to Dublin!!! ",5,2017,03,10
240,Consistent Excellence,"A quick return visit for a one night stay, instead of the previous week long visit.  Staff were warm and welcoming.  Room on the balcony level offered a spectacular view and was spacious and immaculate.  Breakfast offered a variety of choices and was done to perfection.  No better location for a visit to Kilmainham Gaol or the Irish Museum of Modern Art (I highly recommend visiting their Freud exhibit).  Close to public transportation to all the rest of Dublin.",5,2017,03,06
240,Relaxing stay,"We stayed for two nights to do a bit of sightseeing in Dublin. We chose this hotel as it was away from the noise of the city and next to the Kilmainham Jail. 
The rooms were very nice, clean, quiet and the beds were good enough for a great nights sleep. The spa facilities were also a nice addition for when you have been on your feet all day in the city!
It is a bit far from attractions, so expensive taxis are often the only option. We did walk to Heuston station when it wasn`t raining to get a tram into town, which is a good 10-15 minutes walk, but a pleasant walk if you go through the gardens of the art museum over the road.
We would definitely recommend this hotel if you are not too bothered about being far from town like we were",5,2017,03,06
240,One night stop over,"Stayed here for one night . Great area to stay . Hotel was fantastic with parking included was super as Dublin can be pricey on parking . Room was lovely , food was great and would be happy to stay here again ",5,2017,03,05
240,Brilliant hotel,"We stayed in the Kilmainham for 2 nights in April 2016.
The hotel was beautiful with the room being spacious and it also boasted a wall size window. The spa facilities were great.
The restaurant was excellent. Would definitely stay again.",5,2017,03,05
240,Great stay,"Really good service, excellent room and good quality breakfast. The location is a real positive so you get a quiet night. Check in was quick and efficient- staff remembered my name and did everything they could to make my stay good.",5,2017,03,03
240,One night stay,"Booking in with family for one night. Picked the hotel due to the location is near to an early morning appointment. Quick and easy check in, friendly staff. Room was nice and there was a good choice of food to choose from on the bar menu. Would definitely stay here again.",4,2017,02,25
240,Very Good Hotel close to St Jame's Hospital,"My wife has to make occasional trips to the hospital and we find this hotel very good, helpful and convenient. Over several trips the staff have been exceptionally helpful and considerate,so much so, that I keep the business card of one of the receptionists in my wallet.",5,2017,02,24
240,Great hotel and area,"Stayed here for three nights in February, we had a great experience there.  It is a little out of the downtown area but it's super easy to take the bus into to town, as well the hop on hop off bus is right on the same street.  The Kilmainham Gaol is across the road and was a highlight for us, as well the modern art museum is across the road and has nice grounds to walk around.  The staff were always really helpful, and the size of the room Is great for Europe.  I would stay here again for sure!",5,2017,02,24
240,Noise from Airconditioning,Everything was very good except the noise from the air conditioning and bathroom fan. Kept us awake most of the night. Good atmosphere in the bar and the food looked good. The pool area was lovely too.,2,2017,02,23
240,"Just outside the centre, but well worth considering","This is a modern Hilton located around 3.5km from the centre of the city, and 2km from the Guiness storehouse. Well worth considering as only a quick hop by taxi and the difference in price of the rooms will cover that several times over.  Facilities are good as you would expect in a modern Hilton, and I found the staff to be friendly and helpful.  Unlike some other reviewers i found the breakfast excellent and certainly a lot better than that at the Jury's Inn nearby where I have stayed several times.",5,2017,02,22
240,Best breakfast of any hotel,"Overall a great hotel in all respects but the thing that sets it apart is the breakfast. Well worth the extra 12 euro for fruit, honeycomb with yogurt, full Irish fry up with eggs done any way you want.",5,2017,02,21
240,"Great Room, Terrible Breakfast","When you think of the Hilton, your first thought is of the excellent breakfast buffet they offer worldwide. This was not the case with the Hilton Dublin Kilmainham.

A small selection of hot food and instead of their usual very tasty hash browns and waffles, we were greeted with roast potatoes......for breakfast! No croissants but instead there was sliced bread....",3,2017,02,21
240,Perfect stay for gluten-free vegetarian,"We stayed for 3 nights. The first day was rainy and we spent it inside the hotels restaurant.  The international stuff made this time to something special.  Fast,  obliging,  chatty and full with wonderful recommendations for gluten-free vegetarian snacks. 

The room was clean and the bed really comfy. 

Breakfast offered a wide range of gluten-free vegetarian food. 
",5,2017,02,20
240,Lovely experience ,"My family and I stayed at the Hilton in Kilmainham and we were. It disappointed our rooms were spotless with lovely comfy beds and the kids loved the large screen tv in their room. The staff were very pleasant and helpful with any of our little requests for the kids and we had a ball in the leisure centre to top off our stay, I'll certainly be staying again when in Dublin ",5,2017,02,20
240,Satisfactory for a one-night stay,"The Good:

- The hotel is clean, modern and well furnished. The room that we stayed in was spacious, spotless and very comfortable. 
- Underground car park is handy and secure. At ‚Ç¨12 for overnight parking it was most reasonable. 
- For those wanting to sightsee around Dublin, the major open-top bus tour companies (red, green and yellow buses) all stop right outside the front of the hotel at Kilmainham Gaol. If you buy an all-day hop-on-hop-off bus ticket, this is an interesting and cheap enough way to get around the city and back to the hotel again during the day.
- Reception staff are excellent and well-informed. We were looked after by Emma upon check-in and departure and she was fantastic.
- Prices in the hotel bar are very reasonable and the bar staff were excellent.

The Bad:

- The bath/shower wasn't great. The plug needed to be manually held open to allow the water to drain out of the tub - and as the shower was in the bathtub, this quickly turned a quick shower into an unwanted bath experience.

The Ugly:

- Breakfast was an absolute disgrace to Hilton standards. I'm more than happy to pay the price of a Hilton, hot breakfast, knowing that I'm getting an excellent buffet with a range of different options. What we got at Kilmainham Hilton excelled both in its limitations and blandness. I don't eat meat - but even I could feel the discontent amongst other guests at the shortage of bacon at the hot breakfast buffet. Other Hiltons that I have stayed at offer a vegetarian hot buffet, with veggie sausages, etc. I could accept that this one didn't offer the same options, but I can't accept the congealed baked beans, the lack of cooked mushrooms and the pre-prepared, roast (bizarre?) potatoes in place of the expected hash browns. It's like they got their order sheet wrong during the week and had to nick some of the previous night's dinner ingredients to make up for the lack of breakfast options. 
Fine, I thought. I'll skip out on the hot food and just carb it out for breakfast. Over to the bread section... Croissants? No. Rolls? Of course not. But if you want some good old, sliced, white bread (the type you'd grab on the way home from work - not freshly baked) then eat your heart out. Perhaps it was because it was a Sunday - the staff were as attentive as the food selection - but for Hilton I just don't think that's a valid excuse. Disappointed to say the least. Save the money and eat out for breakfast if you're staying over the weekend.",3,2017,02,19
240,"Very good hotel, especially the restaurant",Excellent hotel. The staff were helpful and friendly. The hotel was clean and well presented. The restaurant for evening meal (Burger) was excellent. The breakfast was not included in the rate as standard and was average. The room was very nice and well appointed although the plug sockets near the bed were both awkward and occupied with hotel lamps and clocks. There was a very loud generator (or similar) on the roof above my room though that ran all night causing interupted sleep. All in all very nice and I would stay again even if the location isn't ideal for tourism.,5,2017,02,18
240,Great Stay!!,"This is a very modern, clean and comfortable hotel with top shelve service. it has a very good fitness centre and swimming pool which is nice. There is a nice bar/lounge area and the food in the restaurant tasty. Couldn't fault the hotel in any way but the location is a little far removed the city centre, which in my opinion is a plus.",5,2017,02,18
240,Great Stay,"Great hotel. Exactly what you would expect from a Hilton. 
Located slightly outside the city, which means its nice and quiet away from the craziness. However you can walk it 20-30mins and its a pleasant walk, although id recommend a taxi or even a bus. If your sightseeing these is the hop-on hop-off tourist bus that stops right outside the hotel (as the kilmainham prison is across the road - now a very interesting museum!). Use the bus to go in and return from the centre! :)",5,2017,02,16
240,Great stay!,"Just visited Dublin's Hilton Kilmainham. What an excellent hotel. We were there for a romantic weekend break after getting married and very much enjoyed every moment. The hotel was well equipped with all amenities you'd want and expect of a Hilton. The staff were very friendly, in particular Ana on reception. She was exceptionally helpful and accommodating and made our stay even better- thank you Ana! We would certainly visit this hotel again and recommend to anyone who is looking to stay in Dublin. It's a fair walk from the centre - about 45mins- but is an enjoyable one with plenty to see along the way. We certainly got our steps in and was a great way to see more of the city.",5,2017,02,16
240,Nothing short of Spectacular!,"Where do I begin! The staff, the rooms, the food. Such an incredible and welcoming atmosphere. Cozy and quaint and was taken well care of. Very attentive staff, I cannot praise them enough for such a wonderful experience. Having stayed at many Hilton's around the globe this was by far the best one.  Clean, fresh, professional and friendly. Location, a nice brisk walk into town or easily hop in a cab or transit. Many options to get around, but, this hotel will be my only option for future stays. Well done!",5,2017,02,14
240,Highly recommend,"I recently stayed in a hotel in Dublin which I will not name and the first I said to my girlfriend ""wish I had of booked the Hilton again"". I tend to stay in Dublin a few times a year and I will book the Hilton as the rooms are very spaces, easy to get till your room, excellent service, very clean, lovely food and bar and is located perfect for tourist attractions. 
I will most defiantly be back again",5,2017,02,14
240,Great Local Hotel!,"As a local to the area my girlfriend and I are here quite regularly so its about time I posted a review! We go there to eat alot or sometimes just to chill out over a glass of wine. The food is always great, I particularly love the club sandwich and sometimes get a craving to run down especially for one! What is best about it though, its a big brand name hotel, yet the bar area with the couches is extremely comfortable and the staff are very friendly. It feels like a local at times as opposed to a big hotel. Raja , one of the waiters contributes greatly to this, always working with a smile on his face and taking time to chat to myself and my girlfriend. Its this unique blend of local friendliness and international hotel vibe  that makes the Hilton a really nice local spot to frequent.",5,2017,02,14
240,Lovely,Lovely hotel friendly staff food is gorgeous rooms are nice and clean and comfortable beds it's a quiet hotel and not to far from the city centre and the transport is very reliable and and is quick to collect you,5,2017,02,14
240,A review from a local,"As the subject says, I am a local to the area and therefore have been here many times in the bar and restaurant area. I have to say if I was reviewing this 6 months ago it would be a one star.. There have been marked improvements in the last two visits but there is still a long way to go. Staff for the most part are nice and friendly... but it can be an achievement in itself to get their attention in the first place. A couple of grumpy bar men don't add to the atmosphere. The bar has recently been refurbished and is very comfortable. The new bar menu is a bit hit and miss. We shared the dips as a starter and they really were not good. Tasted shop bought and the tortilla with them was very greasy. I had the prawn skewer after that and it was tough to eat and very little meat. Himself had the fish and chips and it was lovely and very substantial. We had asked for mimosa's.. was told they only do what is on the menu.. so we ordered Prosecco and orange juice and made our own! ",3,2017,02,13
240,A great Hilton stay,"As you would expect, this is a modern, clean, very comfortable hotel with great service. As a nice bonus it has a very well-equipped, large fitness centre and swimming pool.  Room service was prompt and the food very good. There is a nice bar and restaurant serving excellent pub food.",5,2017,02,12
240,Very clean hotel with a super helpful staff,"Just stayed here for three nights. While it's not right downtown, there's lots to see, and the Hop on, Hop off tour bus stops right across the street if you want to go sightseeing...or a cab ride is fairly reasonably priced to get to the centre of Dublin. Things that I loved about this hotel: quiet, super clean, very comfortable beds, and really nice, helpful staff. They went out of their way to help us during our stay. I highly recommend it if you're going to go to beautiful Dublin!",5,2017,02,09
240,Perfect,"Well located (10 min from the city center by bus 13 or 40)
Good facilities (Gym Sauna jacuzzi ham man) without extra charge 
Welcoming and helpful people
Restaurant of the hotel very good 
Breakfast with lots of option (including GF) 
Good price for value
Will definitively come back to this hotel if I come back to Dublin 

",5,2017,02,09
240,Excellent care,This was our first trip to Ireland taken in Sept of 2016.  The country was beautiful and in general the people were amazing.  Renata at the Hilton Dublin Kilmainham took excellent care of us during our stay.  She made sure we had a wonderful room away from the elevator a fan for better sleeping chocolates and a card to celebrate our wedding anniversary which was the reason for the trip.  She upgraded us to have breakfast in the morning and took care of our parking fee.  We stayed at this Hilton on our last night in Ireland and it was a wonderful experience to end our amazing trip to this country.  I highly recommend this establishment and the people there went above and beyond to ensure our satisfaction.  It further solidified that we will visit again and when we do we will stay at this hotel!,5,2017,02,08
240,Great staff service and clean hotel,"In Dublin for work and decided to stay a few days extra.  Selected this hotel based on price and location.  Not in the ""city center"" but also not to far away.  Can get a taxi to the center for 10 to 12 Euro depending on traffic.  Right across from the Kilmainham Jail which is one of the best attractions in Dublin.  Limited pubs/restaurants near by so you will have to travel.",4,2017,02,06
240,Mr. Salvatore Conti,"Really nice hotel, beautiful, clean and staff very kind. Not really close to the centre but there are a lot of way to go there. Room really clean and large, bathroom was shining, bedroom brilliant, no dusty at all. Brilliant view and room attendant very carefully about cleaning.",5,2017,02,06
240,"Lovely, had a grand time","Room was huge, comfortable bed, stayed with as a family an teenage son slept well. Wifi good, had dinner and breakfast on hotel, all good. Value for money when you reflect on how expensive dublin prices are. For dinner, 3 mains 3 drinks, (1 alcoholic), 50 euro. Yes we did feel full as we didn't want pudding. Alcholic drinks are expensive about 6.60 euro for a drambuie. Breakfast in morning 12 euro each. Sounds expensive but we were stuffed and good selection and didnt eat again till dinner time, hence skipped lunch due to quality of breakfast. Swimming pool is more like a wide puddle very small, so if you want to swim lengths, forget it. Overall yeah I liked the hotel and would go back. We got the airlink bus (747) that terminates at Heuston train station then walked to hotel. Takes about a 10-15 minute walk. Yes it is a wee bit out of the main strip of dublin but i like quite at night and the bus no 13, 40 takes you into the city centre for 2.70 euro (exact fair and no notes)., one way.",5,2017,02,05
240,Superb Service,"I stayed one night in the hotel and the service was great and dinner was tasty in the restaurant. I went back the next day for a lunch meeting and was served by Monika and Gerda who went above and beyond to ensure I was able to order what I felt like.
Will be back..soon!",4,2017,02,03
240,Clean and Friendly,"Great property, clean and staff went above and beyond to be friendly. Renata at reception was incredibly lovely to deal with especially after travelling since early morning.   The breakfast items were of really high quality.   I was even able to check in ahead of time which was great.   The location was very convenient for meetings in Kilmainham.  Parking was good value for money and was uncomplicated.",5,2017,02,03
240,Pleasant stay,"Haven't been at this hotel in a while but it still delivers on customer service.  Very pleasant, welcoming staff and comfortable room.  The breakfast is really good too....lovely selection of good Irish produce.  Keep it up!",4,2017,02,03
240,Mother of the Groom,As a wedding party we stayed in the Kilmainham HIlton for a wedding in the Royal Hospital Kilmainham.  The location was perfect.  We could walk into the venue.  It is also perfect for the Luas and Heuston Station.  The staff were very helpful and the rooms were perfect.  They organised a family dinner for us and everyone enjoyed the whole experience. ,5,2017,02,01
240,"Hilton Hotel, Dublin",Well worth the stay. Everything bout our stay was brilliant. Staff were both very friendly and helpful. Room was very satisfying and bed was very comfortable. Would highly recommend it to anyone wishing to stay in Dublin.,5,2017,01,30
240,Lovely stay,"Only a short stay but was made very welcome, staff are amazing, breakfast was lovely, would def like to return.
Short walk to bus route into city centre, bit further for tram route but not too far at all",5,2017,01,30
240,Decent place,"Does not accept Discover.
Clean rooms, but a bit far from downtown for the expense.
Beds were a 40/100 on my softness scale.
Showers use a half-bath glass covering instead of a curtain, so anyone pooping while you shower might get wet.",4,2017,01,30
240,Out of Town,"I chose this hotel because I thought we'd spend all day in traffic - I'd not taken into account the size of Dublin, so traffic is a relative concept.

Check in was fine, our room was on the 3rd floor, overlooking the office next door, with Phoenix Park to the far right if you leaned out the window.  Nice room, good size, clean.   Water replaced daily.

Very quiet location; good bus links into town.  Either pay 2.70 euros per trip, or buy an all day pass - but you can only get this once you get into Dublin.  Not a lot in the surrounding area - a good Italian about a 20 minutes walk, or a fairly traditional pub just across the road.  

Bar area can be noisy, service is hit and miss.  If they like your face, you're fine.  Otherwise it can be a very dry experience.  And expect to wait ages for the cheque.

Breakfast is good, with a variety of carbohydrates, and proteins, and eggs.  Cereals get put out the night before, so may not be as crispy as you'd hope for.

Probably wont stay here again, would go closer to the city.",3,2017,01,26
240,Love this hotel,"Love this hotel. We have been a few times and will definitely return. The pool is brilliant. Only negative was we paid for the upgrade and got a really lovely room with a balcony but the bathroom was a bit disappointing. I think kitted out for special access but it felt like a changing room in a leisure centre rather than a nice hotel bathroom. 
",5,2017,01,25
240,Super stay,We loved everything about this hotel but what makes it are the amazing staff!The guy in the leisure centre made us feel very welcome with our 11 week old baby even though it was 7 in the evening.Will defo be back!,5,2017,01,25
240,5 stars every time,"Excellent attitude and costumer service. 
I run events. It's important for me to be able to get assistance from the hotel staff where we stay. Hilton Kilmainham go out of their way for me every time!! Best looking Hilton hotel I've stayed at. Can't wait to go run out next event there later in 2017.",5,2017,01,25
240,Night away for anniversary ,"The hotel is lovely, clean , comfortable, styled as you would expect a 4 star to be, staff were all really nice people, very sincerely friendly , helpful, informative and professional. We were away for one night from the kids, so a phone call to our room waking us at 8am for a taxi which was a mistake was not appreciated, however we were given complimentary breakfast and parking as a result, can not fault the hotel or staff for this. We used the hydrotherapy pool and sauna and enjoyed it, very relaxing atmosphere, changing rooms very clean and plenty space . The location was great as you are beside  Kilmainham  court and jail, and you are in town, yet away from the noise and bustle of the centre which suits if it's a sleep you need on a night away! I would recommend this hotel highly. Lovely place . ",5,2017,01,24
240,Fantastic,This hotel is exceptional and extremely clean and comfortable. Location is perfect and near the city center. Absolutely nothing negative to say. Thank you and I look forward to returning in the future. ,5,2017,01,23
240,Better than I expected ,"I stayed for one night with my Wife and Son.
I was concerned as I have stayed in the Airport Hilton before and it was quiet a poor experience.  The hotel is very close to the railway station, Kilmainham Gail and the Guinness Store House. (15 min walk) 
We checked in without a hitch staff were friendly and efficient. 
Went to the restaurant which is really a lovely design with navy with gold pinstripe it feels really warm. 
The staff at lunch time were young and so it took a while to get noticed even though it was not busy. The food was magic and I can recommend the mushroom tagliatelle it is one of the best I have eaten. We also dined in the evening and the staff were better trained and more efficient. 
The pool is small but has a jet resistance feature for swimming. The jacuzzi, steam room and sauna were brilliant. The place was spotless and the changing rooms were lovely and warm but not stuffy. 
Would highly recommend this hotel for a stay.",5,2017,01,22
240,Excellent,A great example of the Hilton quality. Well connected to local attractions and a 10 minute walk from Heuston station connecting to the airport or Luas. I will be staying here again at my next opportunity ,5,2017,01,22
240,Great Hotel good location,The Hilton D.K. is a good example of service and reliability of the Hilton brand. The staff was more than accommodating for a family of six checking close to midnight. The location of the hotel is across the street from a premier tourist attraction and about a 20-minute walk from the Guinness storehouse. If you've never had an Irish breakfast and would like to experience it then this is a top notch choice. The rooms were modern and clean. The room service was great and operated well past midnight. Though the price isn't exactly budget it is well worth it as the quality and assortment are amazing. The hop on hop off tour bus stop is right in front of the hotel making this an easy point to start your Ireland sight-seeing. I would definitely recommend this Hilton for future stays.,4,2017,01,22
240,Not a very friendly hotel,"The hotel is clean, the room itself was lovely but the staff lets the hotel down as they are not very friendly. Service at breakfast was very slow although the food was of good quality. It is a buffet breakfast although you can order certain items of the menu I would advise that you don't bother. The wait to get any food of the menu is slow. I ordered poached eggs which I had to wait over 35mins for. We had lunch in the bar again the service was very slow and the staff weren't friendly but the food itself was lovely. this hotel is much more suited for business than leisure",3,2017,01,18
240,Lovely Hotel but gluten free food needs work,"Receptionist greeted me so pleasantly and couldn't do enough to help, bar / food staff were un-organised and scatty and gluten free options were slim to none. For such a prestigious hotel name I expected much more ",3,2017,01,17
240,new year's eve at the Hilton Kilmainham Dublin,"we had a wonderful time at this modern Hilton during new year's eve. Staff was exceptionally warm and attentive, accomodations were up to the brand's standard but I'd like to point out everything seems shiny and new so it gave our stay a little extra. As the weather at night was quite rainy we used the restaurant quite frequently, also for our NY's eve dinner (thay had a live music venue so we actually spent a very nice time) and their service and food were very good indeed. Gym, pool and other facilities were running on a reduced time schedule but they were great anyway. Breakfast was also very good, again up to Hilton's usual standards but worth mentioning.
Location may not be a favorite for everyone but in our case was perfect as it was outside the busy areas but close enough not to be a nuisance. The Kilmainham Gaol and the Irish Museum of Modern Art are just across the street, there is a HopOn-HopOff bus stop as well ... in fact, we used this as our transportation around town as it is cheaper than taking taxis with the added value of getting to know more about Dublin and Ireland's history and facts!",5,2017,01,17
240,Great Irish Service,"Ive been staying here for a few weeks now and have a few remaining but wanted to commend all of the hotel staff we have come into contact with. Front desk very welcoming; restaurant and bar staff very attentive. Every where you go, they remember your name and offer a ready smile.

Rooms are a very reasonable size

Gym is well equipped

Food is a broad variety and is always served promptly",4,2017,01,13
240,24 hours of bliss!,"Spent 1 night here and it was bliss. The pool area is stunning and so relaxing. The rooms are spacious, modern and spotless. The staff are so friendly and helpful. The hotel feels quiet even when its busy!",5,2017,01,09
240,great business facilities,"I had a 3 day stay for business here and found it to be a great venue. Staff were so helpful and polite. They acted promptly when we needed anything and were always professional. I would even consider going back for pleasure. The reception satff suggested restaurants for us to visit and were spot on with their ideas. One night I felt particularly cold in the room and the staff immediately bought me an additional heater. Great venue, great staff. Highly recommended",5,2017,01,09
240,great short break,"lovely immaculate hotel with great facilities- reasonably close to city centre - taxi rank outside hotel, train station 20 minutes gentle walk, or buses within a 5 minute walk get you all over - opposite Kilmainhaim Gaol which is well worth a few hours visit. Lovely spa and pool - clean and spacious rooms - most comfy bed i have slept in",5,2017,01,09
240,Wonderful Stay,"The front desk staff were wonderful.  The rooms were very clean, spacious and nice.  We were in the family room which had two double beds. The on/off bus stop is right across the street.  All the staff we encountered were very nice and helpful.  The price of the room was excellent.  The bar food was great and reasonable priced.  The room had a refrigerator which we appreciated.",5,2017,01,04
240,Good hotel in a quiet neighborhood,"The hotel is modern, clean and walkably close to many Dublin attractions such as the Gaol,  Phoenix Park, the Ireland Museum of Modern Art and the Leffy river. Dublin tour busses and city busses stop close to the hotel, making taxis unnecessary in many less hurried situations.",4,2017,01,04
240,Great rooms,"Stayed here for three nights after a four week spell in nearby St. James Hospital. We were allocated an end of corridor spacious room. #206. Great typical Hilton room fit out. Great beds and housekeeping standards. Good Room Service menu and Bar Food downstairs in the main Hotel. Loads of Staff on duty. Breakfast Service good but hot buffet food only warm. Good service though.
I would have given a full five stars for our stay except for recurring problems with our key cards leading to repeat failures in the lift and repeat treks back to Reception to reset the cards. Very annoying. 
Great Hotel, well located, attentive Staff, and great facilities.",4,2016,12,30
240,top class,"I have on occasion left negative feedback for this hotel , I live very near and use the restaurant and bar facilities and I believe in giving honest reviews good or bad.
I visited the Hilton kilmainham on 28/12/16 for a meal and drinks with friends, the whole bar area has been turned into a bistro like restaurant, a really nice job was done on it, the service and food were excellent the seating is comfortable and with great views of the gaol and richmond tower it really is a place worth visiting ,well done Hilton for listening to your customers.",5,2016,12,29
240,Pre holiday stay,"Excellent stay for me and my family.  The staff went out of their way at every turn to ensure our vacation was excellent, from recommending restaurants, to booking shows, to finding my son's lost plush toy.",5,2016,12,27
240,Super Modern and nice!,"This hotel had lovely restaurants. There was a more expensive one for formal dining, and a more inexpensive version in the bar/lounge area. They had wonderful prices, options, and delicious food choices.  I had a salad and a wrap and my friend had burgers and fries.
Great place!",5,2016,12,23
240,Family visit,"Great hotel. Quiet. Comfortable rooms and beds. Large bathroom with separate shower - great. Advertised as in the heart of Dublin but it is not. You need transport to get to the heart of the city. Taxis were always fast to arrive. You will not find a more helpful, professional and friendly staff. The restaurant serves excellent food and the chef specials were wonderful.",5,2016,12,23
240,Corporate dublin at an affordable price ,"I stayed in this Dublin City center property last week, I regularly stay in Dublin and move about as I find that it's a bit less boring this way. 
There is a large poster when you enter through the car park advertising its meeting facilities and this is understandable given its close vicinity to The train station it would be a location of choice !!! 
The car park is good value at 12 ‚Ç¨ / night, other city hotels that have their own car park ( many don't) charge 18 to 20 ‚Ç¨!
The reception team were helpful on check-in an although this hotel is corporate, check-in was personalised and friendly!
My only negative is that I book hotels with a pool as when I'm away I swim for fitness, the ""pool"" in this hotel is a hydrothermal pool with jets and is divided into two parts, it is not suitable for swimming lengths so the ""indoor pool"" description on Booking.com left me disappointed as was misleading to say the least.

Would I stay again? Definitely but I'd bring my runners and still avail of the sauna and steam room.",4,2016,12,19
240,Clean and modern hotel with a few areas for improvement ,"Had a 7 night stay at the Hilton Kilmainham. Overall impressions of the hotel were good and the interiors were clean and modern. The rooms were spacious and the beds comfortable. In terms of location, the hotel is about a 40 minute walk from the centre although this can be shortened by getting the tram part of the way.

Only a couple of small niggles over the week the most notable being with the air conditioning; despite three reports to reception of it not cooling the room it was never fixed. On the one occasion when they did come and ""fix"" it they left it set on 28 degrees! 

Other than that the staff were friendly and helpful and it was a pleasant stay.",4,2016,12,18
240,"Clean, friendly hotel. Great Location.","I have stayed at the Hilton Kilmainham on many occasions. It is a clean, quiet hotel with friendly staff and good service. It is located between the Kilmainham Gaol and The Royal Hospital Kilmainham / IMMA...a very beautiful area of old Dublin with good transport connections and easy access to local shops and restaurants. It takes about 25 minutes to walk to the centre of Dublin...a very pleasant ind interesting walk through the areas of Rialto, St James and Christ Church. This hotel is very handy for families who have loved ones in any of the local hospitals (St James and St Patricks are very nearby). The breakfast and bar /restaurant menus are fine - nothing inspiring - but well prepared food and a good variety of choices. A very good all rounder.",4,2016,12,15
240,The staff are great.  The rooms seriously too hot,"Stayed here on business for a couple of nights and probably slept less than 4 hours in total.  The room had no windows that can open and the air conditioning only goes down to 17 degrees.  Coupled with a duvet that could definitely keep you warm in an arctic winter...  Perfect recipe for no sleep. 

I have asked for a room with a window I can open for next time and they were  able to oblige.  The reason I am writing this is that I feel strongly that the overall waste of energy in overheating this whole hotel is an environmental disgrace.  It should not feel hot in shirt sleeves in the winter!

Please Hilton think about optimal use of energy and realise that you need to be cool to sleep well!! ",2,2016,12,14
240,Good solid Hilton Hotel,"I was here for 7 days on a training course and have only positive feedback for every aspect. Rooms, Food, location it was all great. I especially enjoyed the evening meals as they were extremely delicious at a reasonable price(considering it's a Hilton) and the quality of the food was great. Wifi is free and of good quality, same as the Gym area. 
Staff were all extremely polite and professional. Really a great stay, highly recommended.",5,2016,12,12
240,Double stay,"Excellent hotel and staff that are always warm, friendly, polite and helpful. The location is excellent as it's close to downtown but in an adylkic neighbourhood with a lot of local charm and places to eat and drink. Definitely a must stay. ",5,2016,12,11
240,Would definately stay here! again,"The staff was very accommodating from answering our questions to arranging for taxi's each morning.  the rooms were very pleasant, clean, and welcoming after each day of touring.  We would certainly recommend a stay.",5,2016,12,07
240,Excellent!,"The room is clean and tidy. The staffs are very friendly and helpful... 
You'll get to the city very easy. Just 5 minutes walk is the bus stop and it'll take you to the city center. 
The staffs at the restaurant are also very friendly and nice. The breakfast was great!!! ",5,2016,12,07
240,Great Stay,Overall excellent property. Stay was very friendly and helpful and awesome service all around. We used the bus system to get around Dublin and there are a few stops very close to the hotel. Highly recommend it.,5,2016,12,07
240,Dublin Stay,"I couldn't say enough about the entire staff during my ""extended"" stay here. Reception Staff was Excellent; Restaurant Staff was Excellent (as well as the food); Housekeeping Staff was excellent (room always clean and fresh) and the Living Well Gym Staff including Svetlana, Debbie, Rachel, Lilian, Anthony, Marko and Warren treated me like family. A world Class facility with World Class treatment. Any return trips to Dublin will have me checking in at Hilton Kilmainham.

The ONLY downfall is the Channel selection on TV...need more US channels, especially sports!",5,2016,12,06
240,Excellent example of great service,"We arrived at 11 am on the Saturday and left at 4 pm on Sunday and experienced, lunch, breakfast and dinner at this hotel.  The food was delicious and very well presented.  Breakfast was fantastic.  We were all very impressed with all the staff at this hotel.  The group were all happy with rooms, cleanliness and quietness despite the fact it is in a busy area right across from Kilmainham gaol.  The bus stops for a bus into the city centre are just down the road and ‚Ç¨2.70 is the fare for one way.  We also got a taxi in once and it was ‚Ç¨20 for a 7 seater.  

All in all it was a lovely place to stay and we wouldn't hesitate in returning.  ",5,2016,12,06
240,Glamours hotel/ comfortable bed,"Friendly reception staff, very modern decorated and we loved the room, very spacious with the most confortable bed ever. The location is also great, very easy to ascess the M50/M6 and so on, for those who needs a place to sleep and an easy ascess back to the main roads. ",5,2016,12,05
240,Best in Class Service,"First of all we got a room upgrade.  Although that's tough to beat, Hilton Kilmainham delivered amazing support and service to help us during the trying times when we lost our passport in the City Centre during our trip.  Shauna & Team at Hilton Kilmainham, you guys rock!! Hope to see you soon!",5,2016,12,04
240,enos,"I had a nice and beautiful experience , the staffs was really good. Front desk staff when we arrived was lovely, I think Sebastian was his name. Our house keeper, the lady that cleaned the room, was very nice. In the whole experience, I will say out of the world  ",5,2016,12,04
240,Dublin Vacation,"Very helpful staff at the front desk.  The food in the restaurant, Broyage, was EXCELLENT!  We had dinner there several times.  The wait staff were very considerate and did a good job.  Again, the food was great.  I would recommend that the hotel change out their pillows..the feather pillows do not support the head/neck very good and it was hard to get comfortable with them.",5,2016,12,03
240,AMAZING ROOM SERVICE BREAKFAST,"Being now retired my wife and myself normally treat ourselves to room service breakfast, and a leisurely read of the morning newspaper when staying overnight in a hotel.Earlier today I had what was the finest breakfast I have ever had on such occasions.The quality and quantity of the full breakfast served  hot was little short of being extraordinary .I am know to have a good appetite for such an occasional treat but I struggled to finish it, having to leave a little on the plate.My compliments to the chef and to the management of the hotel.",4,2016,12,02
240,perfect location,"Perfect location, friendly staff, great hotel. Everything from booking to check in and check out went smooth, rooms were clean and staff were brilliant. I am looking forward to my next stay at this hotel ",5,2016,12,02
240,Ireland trip,"Very nice hotel, updated, employees very pleasant, knowledgeable and helpful.
I would stay there again if I were ever in Dublin. Rooms very comfortable and spacious.  Nice bar and restraunt and breakfast was very good.",5,2016,11,30
240,Excellent service,"Very nice modern hotel with large rooms and a big bed ,right opposite kilmaenon gaol if this is on your sightseeing tour ,excellent breakfast plenty of choice free internet which was good nice residents bar the tour bus stops right outside well worth buying a ticket to ride around the city .",5,2016,11,29
240,Hilton Hotel,Very pleased overall. Experience was marred by poor administration and a result that left me with no choice but to take my dinner guests elsewhere. Generally the service was very good to excellent however this one area forces me to put 'average' as it caused me embarrassment.,4,2016,11,29
240,Enjoyable Stay!,Best stay so far at the Hilton Kilmainham arriving on a Sunday for one night after arriving by rail at the nearby train station. Enjoyed the stroll through the park to the hotel from the station and managed a quick and early check in with the friendly receptionist Jonut. King room was comfortable and a view out front to the adjacent historic jail - settled in for the afternoon with sports on the flat screen tv followed by dinner in the very good refurbished Broyage Bar and Bistro. Good nights sleep and no noise intrusion from the main road outside where the remodelling work is now finished. Bathroom as before quite small but well lit and manageable for one night with shower over the tub. Also managed to control the room heating and the Wi Fi was very good strength. Did not take breakfast which was not included in the very good rate I got for the room.,5,2016,11,29
240,Lovely hotel!,Would defiantly recommend this hotel! Only 10 minuets from the city centre! Staff all very helpful when checking in! One thing I will say is that the food is very limited and there is little choice to choose from!,4,2016,11,28
240,hilton dublin,"excellent hotel and staff clean rooms good food nothing not to like, excellent location good parking facilities and good nights sleep with free room upgrade  would recommend staying at this hotel cant fault it",4,2016,11,28
240,Standard box hotel,Room is okay with firm twin beds.  Wifi works but slow. Shower is weak but does job.  Heat control did not work but it was not overly cold. TV did not work but engineer showed up and fixed. Breakfast is standard Irish but you can fill up. Parking garage costs 12 Euros and has the usual small slots.  City center is only 2 miles away but if walking you pass by some depressed areas.  Felt like a budget hotel. ,3,2016,11,27
240,ok needs a bit of a shine up,Considering its a big chain of hotels some staff need to up skill their customer focus.the rooms were clean but basic on one of the days the housemaid came in to clean our room after we arrived back at 4 pm. dinning room was closed for Dinner so food was only served at the bar in the evening although it was open for breakfast there should have been a note on the webpage to let people know as it was a bit of an inconvenience as you need to go into town as this hotel is further away from the city however a fabulous Italian  accros the road.,3,2016,11,26
240,"Great Restaurant, very good service and food","We had a dinner here with eight people, we were served by Asif, a very helpful waiter, the food was fabulous with an amazing atmosphere. We would highly recommend if you were visiting the country or hosting a party. Should definitely visit this restaurant, and you would be greeted with very helpful and polite staff like we were on the day.",5,2016,11,26
240,Shabby & staff with no sparkle,"I am tired of being put in a shabby room, just because I arrive late to check-in. This time, no aircon, and a tatty electric heater in the room (certainly not mentioned by the reception staff). 

Then, for breakfast, I didn't get what I ordered. No apple juice and a 'dump and run' approach to room service. 

Come on Hilton. Know your regular travellers and raise the game. ",2,2016,11,25
240,Great value for money!,"We were pleasantly surprised at the price of the hotel, we had never stayed in a Hilton hotel before and this really did live up to expectation! When we arrived check in wasn't until 3, the receptionist really did go above and beyond to have our room ready, she was very apologetic when this wasn't possible, even though we were quite happy to just leave our bags. It is a quieter hotel which is out of the city centre which in all honesty adds a touch of class! We enjoyed walking into the city in the day time which took about 30-40 mins and spent most of the day in the city. We would return early evening to freshen up to return to the city at night in a taxi which ranged from about ‚Ç¨10-15. On the Saturday night we dined in the hotel restaurant and I can honestly say It was the best steak I have ever tasted! The rooms were spacious and beds were comfy with shower and bath facilities. The only critic would be not enough sockets in the room (this could be down to being two girls with multiple stylers and phone chargers though!) and the thin walls we could occasionally hear next doors television. Highly recommend this hotel if you are looking for somewhere classy and comfortable and you don't mind a walk! :) ",4,2016,11,23
240,Good location with full amenities.,"This hotel is older, but updated nicely. Smallish rooms by US standards, but adequate for a short stay. Good bar and excellent dining room. The breakfast buffet is not to be missed. Well presented, good assortment and fresh food. Wait staff are excellent. On site parking is a plus.",4,2016,11,23
240,Superb,I stayed here with my wife as a present for my birthday. The hotel is amazing we had a room with a balcony and champagne in our room. The only problem about the room is the bed is very hard and pillows are flatter than pancakes. Only bad thing to say about the hotel. The breakfast in the morning was unreal everything was so fresh and cooked to perfection. I would defo come back and stay here the staff are very helpful and friendly and does a wicked pint of Guinness. ,4,2016,11,23
240,Thanks Monika and colleagues,Group of 7 with limited time for lunch due to an appointment in Kilmainham Gaol.  Monika expertly talked us through the quick options and lunch was on the table within 5 mins.  And we made our timing!  Many thanks Monika.,5,2016,11,23
240,I still dream about this room!,"Had a one night stay, room was superb. Did not want to leave the bed, so comfy. Super location, right across the road from Kilmainham Gaol which is not to be missed. Will be back as soon as I have an excuse to!",5,2016,11,21
240,"Friendly, Helpful Staff in a Great City!","Our room was spacious, comfortable and very clean and nice.  All great toiletries, nice linens, etc.  This hotel is not in the center of things, a cab will be required for most trips to the city center, but the cabs are not expensive and the drivers were so informative and friendly!  Do not buy the room rate that includes breakfast if you're an early riser.  We did not know breakfast doesn't start until 7 a.m., and we had made plans for tours that started at the same time so we paid for breakfast for 3 days that we never were able to eat.  That was the ONLY downside to our visit, and something I should have investigated better.  I'd never heard of breakfast in a business type hotel starting that late, but now I know!  :)  The staff was VERY helpful and friendly, and I would not hesitate to stay here again!",4,2016,11,21
240,Excellent hotel,One of the best hotels I have stayed in .. room was fantastic and had a shower and separate bath ... breakfast could have been better .. not a fan of buffet breakfast.. overall a fantastic stay at the hotel ,5,2016,11,20
240,A really nice place to stay,"It's a good place to stay located not far from the Guiness Storehouse. If you want to save some money, don't take a taxi though. If you do, it will cost you ‚Ç¨35, which you might spend in a nicer way :) The staff is very helpful :)",5,2016,11,16
240,Holiday,"We recently visited Dublin and stayed at the Hilton Kilmainham. This is a great hotel with wonderful staff. They are very kind and helpful. The hotel itself is immaculate and beautiful. Our room was very clean and comfortable. The hotel is right across the street from Kilmainham Jail. Not realizing the significance of this location, once we toured the jail, we soon realized that it can be related to ""Ireland's Alamo"". (I trust thats not disrespectful. Not meant to be). Its a sobering visit as you learn the history of this location and its tales of sorrow.
The hotel itself is within walking distance to Centre City, but it would be a healthy walk. 3-4 miles. Due to construction of the trams in Centre City, the streets are a mess there and it pushes the traffic back in an unbelievable way. Not realizing these things, we took a taxi our first morning there to catch a day trip bus. It took us nearly 50 minutes to get there! We learned to ride the city bus route which is just a 2-3 minute walk from the hotel to Centre City. It costs E2.70 and catch bus 13 or 40. It takes you right through the heart of Dublin and then you can walk wherever. Temple Bar, Grafton St, St. Stephens Park, Henry St., etc.  You must have cash to ride unless you purchase a card to use for a longer time. 
We also did a day tour to Glendalauch Valley, Wicklow Mountain and Kilkenny. We chose this trip for it fit our time frame. You leave about 9am and return about 5:30-6pm. Beautiful trip despite the fact that it rained all day. 
Even though the Hilton Kilmainham is not in Centre CIty, it is still a wonderful place to stay. Great place!",5,2016,11,15
240,Fantastic Stay,"Stayed for one night (Saturday) due to location of hotel.  Easily accessed from/to town - bus stop a couple of minutes walk away and took approx 15 mins.  Beds incredibly comfortable.  Room and bathroom immaculately clean and had everything you might need - good wifi, big flatscreen tv, hairdryer, tea/coffee, etc, iron, safe, alarm clock, desk and comfy chair, mineral and sparkling water, mini fridge, nice toiletries, trouser press, etc. Breakfast selection fabulous.  All staff we had dealings with (reception, bar, breakfast) could not have been more professional, helpful or pleasant.  Would have no hesitation staying in this hotel again and will be recommending to friends.",5,2016,11,15
240,Perfect stay ,"Overall are stay was perfect, the staff were lovely, the room was a great size, and although the hotel abut out of the way it was in a fantastic positioning for the hop on-hop off bus, and also opposite one of Dublin's greatest attractions-the kilmainham Gaol(the prison). Would highly recommend this hotel, as it was comfortable and the service was pleasing. ",5,2016,11,13
240,Outstanding Hotel!,"My partner and I stayed at the hotel recently for two nights. We found the whole experience lovely! The staff were more than happy to help and were pleasant friendly and professional. 
We paid for breakfast and on both mornings the staff were brilliant in attending to anything that we needed, nothing seemed too much trouble. The food was beautiful and there was a wide variety to eat. 
The room was exceptionally clean and well presented along with the rest of the hotel and we both slept comfortably. The hotel is a distance from the centre of the city however a bus stop is very close by and walking took around 30/40 minutes. The Hilton Hotel is highly recommended and we wouldn't hesitate to stay again.",5,2016,11,13
240,Weekend stay for Marathon ,"Stay here with my wife when I ran the Dublin marathon this year. 
Great, modern hotel, the leisure facilities (with pool) are very good, friendly staff and the bar food was excellent. 
Will be back next year. ",5,2016,11,13
240,Lovely stay!,"Spent two nights here recently. Location is good if you're happy to walk or hop on the luas. I'd mentioned at booking we were there for a birthday and we were upgraded and given complimentary chocolates. Lovely touch, much appreciated. We ate in the hotel one evening and it's pretty standard fare but fresh and tasty. Lovely coffee. We also enjoyed the hydrotherapy pool after a day of sightseeing.  Staff were all very friendly and attentive but sadly nobody Irish. ",5,2016,11,12
240,Over priced and underwhelmed,"We stayed 1 night at Hilton Kilmainham at the end of a week spent travelling around Ireland staying in several hotels. Sad that we should end our stay at this hotel as it was by far the most expensive (¬£180 for 1 night, not including breakfast) and by far the worst experience.

Room: Very basic. Not the usual Hilton standard. Small. Unpleasant. Particular issue with the shower not working properly and a bed so hard that I was in pain the following day.

Facilities: Useful underground parking (fee paid locally). Had a drink in the restaurant (dingy and unpleasant) and was disgusted at the amount of small flies hovering around the bar area, most likely attracted by the open bin behind the bar. Did not eat at the hotel. Did not use the gym.

Location: Handy to visit Kilmainham jail (directly opposite).  Great for the City Sightseeing buses which stop outside the jail. Beyond that, the area is dreadful. Very little to do at night.  My partner and I like to explore so took a 30 min walk towards and beyond the Guinness Brewery to a popular pub called Arthurs for dinner (highly recommend). On the return walk at 9pm I felt incredibly unsafe. The area is run down with gangs of youths or drunks on the streets.

The hotel was under renovation during our stay and we were woken by drilling / hammering at 8am on a SATURDAY morning showing no consideration to guests.

As a Hilton Honors member I was massively disappointed. Reception staff waivered parking charges in response to my complaint.

I'm sure there are worse hotels in Dublin but unless I had no alternative option, I would NOT stay here again or recommend.",2,2016,11,12
240,Looking forward to come back,"I stayed with a friend at this Hilton hotel, at a nice location in Dublin, close to tourist attractions and Phoenix Park. The rooms were nicely renovated and the service of the hotel up to par. 

During our stay we experienced some inconveniences because of renovation works, but the management of this hotel took care of our concerns. 

The restaurant serves nice food, but some of the staff might improve their customer service skills. Breakfast was very good, leisure centre well equipped.",4,2016,11,10
240,Solid hotel in Dublin,The hotel is nice and clean. The free breakfast is good. The pool and gym are very nice.  The location is directly across from the Kilmainham Gaol. The staff at the front desk needs some work.  They will answer your questions but it seems like you are bothering them even though there is no one else in the lobby.,4,2016,11,08
240,A lovely stay with the family!,"Checked in by yonut, a man with an amazing personality making us feel welcomed right away! A trainee? I don't think so! Great understanding of the HHonors benefits satisfying our upgrade request right away! Another thumbs up to Sebastian who also interacted with us and my brother s baby during the check in process. 
The service was so great I booked a second room for my second brother the next evening. Late check in not requested but fully accepted. Yonut st check on ully understanding my brother need of a good breakfast before flying out of Dublin and starting work in Switzerland right away, he suggested a slightly more consistent breakfast for him. My brother, an ex-hospitality professional was impressed and happy!l with his breakfast. 

Thumbs up to these two team members and thanks for making our stay confortable and memorable! ",5,2016,11,08
240,Lovely hotel,"Great hotel staff were so friendly & helpful will stay again. Stayed while doing Dublin marathon, staff arranfed taxi for morning off run, staff let me use the gym facility to have a shower after run. Will be back again ",5,2016,11,07
240,Not up to 4* standards ,"Despite having booked a superior room, I was a bit disappointed overall. Yes, the hotel is nicely located. Yes, the reception desk personnel were polite and smiling, however they were unable to resolve my problem despite several calls (the wifi NEVER worked), plus check-out was really slow. Yes the room design was modern and recent but the temperature control system of the tub did not work and I could not get warm enough water. Yes the fitness room is well equipped, the steam room and the sauna are nice... but forget about the pool if you intend to swim, as it has surprinsingly not been designed for that purpose.
Good breakfast though.",3,2016,11,07
240,Breakfast of champions .... HARDLY,"Not a bad hotel, but the worst cooked breakfast you could imagine!  It may be ok at 7am, but by 9:45, everything was cold; the bacon has been sitting that long, it had hardened and the beans were congealed. So when I was charged ‚Ç¨18:95 for one piece of bacon, one slice of white pudding, 2 sausages and a fried egg, I was shocked to say the least. When I expressed my surprise, I was simply told that was the price for a ""walk in"" breakfast. 
I've attended a few meetings here in the past, but in the future, I'll be suggesting to my colleagues that we book another venue - one that doesn't charge an extortionate price for a less than sub standard breakfast.",2,2016,11,06
240,Fantastic,"We stayed for 2 nights with my husband and 2 children aged 13 and 8.  The hotel was walking distance to most of the places we wanted to visit.   From the moment we walked in the door the staff of the Hilton could not have been more helpful or welcoming. 

The breakfast was amazing along with an amazing buffet, my children had crepes each morning.  We also dined in the Cinnamon restaurant.  The food absolutely beautiful.  The childrens menu was excellent   My 13 was hesitant to order from the childrens menu on the first night but after tasting her brothers meal all hesitation very quickly abated.  

We had interconnecting rooms, which were extremely comfortable.  We all slept very well.  The tea tray was very well kitted out.  

We loved every part of our stay at the Hilton.",5,2016,11,05
240,Great hotel - bit out of the way,"This hotel is amazing and across the street from Kilmingham Goal, so very convienient to a MUST SEE attraction in Dublin.  It is a bit farther away from the city center, and no real restaurants or pubs to walk to except the one directly across the street.  Other than that, the restuarant was refinished as we were there and got to be one of the first people at the new bar, rooms are great (we even got one with a balcony) and staff is amazing!",5,2016,11,02
240,40th birthday,"Great place friendly people, would highly recommend this hotel and cant wait to go back again. Nice suprises of prossecco and chocolates from the staff and a lovely card wishing my wife a great birthday.",5,2016,11,02
240,I,"Excellent stay from checking in to checking out.  We stayed here as a family for one night to celebrate my husband's 40th birthday and him doing his first ever marathon the next day.  I must say it supercedes  my expectation.  

We were welcome by lovely staff in reception area on our arrival. There was birthday greeting card and a box of chocolate in the room which surprised us (big thanks who did it). The room is so clean, spotless and it is a very good size room for a family of four.  

We had the most lovely evening and lunch meal in Broyage Restaurant.  We had a couple of friends who had joined us for evening meal  and the menu we ordered were served in no time.  All  of us find the food so delicious and satisfying.  Great and friendly staff.

Breakfast served was great too.  There were a lot of variety to pick from irish breakfast, cereal,  bread, variety of croissant, cheese and fruits. Of course a massive honey comb with honey came as a bonus.

We did not really used the gym but I must say it was well equipped.  
The children had fun swimming in the pool.

The hotel location suited us very well as it was the route for the marathon event.  It is near Dublin City.  I have been to different hotels but after Hilton experienced it was the simply the best of excellent. 

Thank you so much Hilton  Kilmainham for making our stay a memorable one!!",5,2016,11,01
240,Hilton Dublin Kilmainham,"Good location, cozy room, the hop-on hop-off bus just catch opposite the hotel, opposite kilmainham gaol. TV program channels not much coverage on sports channels. Walking distance to Guinness Storehouse, Phoenix park, Dublin Zoo, etc..",4,2016,10,31
240,Excellent hotel - can't fault it,Stayed here for 2 nights. In arrival there was a lot of noise from workmen who were upgrading the bar but thankfully they were finishing up. Reception staff were lovely - when they noted that it was my wife's birthday they upgraded us to a balcony room which overlooked Kilmainham jail and had magnificent views of the Wicklow mountains. The buffet breakfast was excellent with lots of variety to suit all tastes. All in all we had a fantastic experience and will certainly come back here again.,5,2016,10,30
240,Do not stay here. Inexperienced staff.,"I've stayed at 10+ Hilton hotels across the world. This is the worst I've ever been to.

The staff feel extremely inexperienced. The waiters at the restaurant are clueless. They dont bring you menus, cutlery or napkins, unless you ask. So you'll order a meal and be unable to eat it, until you ask for utensils. Want your bill so you can leave? You'll have to get up and ask for that too. The whole point of hospitality is to make you feel welcome. You will not feel welcome here. You'll just feel like you are passing through. They also put us on a floor with nonstop construction for the first 3-4 days, and did not mention that when we checked in. Common courtesy would be to at least say ""we are undergoing maintenance, just so you know.""

If you're coming to Dublin, stay somewhere else and avoid this Hilton. They have a long way to go before they earn ""Hilton"" status. It feels more like a holiday inn express.",2,2016,10,30
240,Felt like we were in the US,"Our room was lovely but it faced the street with construction and traffic.  I had asked for a quiet room in the back.  I was told we did not get breakfast because I was using HH points.  I had been told that a full Irish breakfast was included.  We received nothing for being  long standing HH members.  The staff was efficient but cold and not friendly like all the other places we visited in Ireland.  It was too far from the train station to walk and there was no airport shuttle.  The maids were lovely.  There was nothing to make it special.  The TV and channels were superb and I enjoyed the handicapped shower that I had requested.   There was absolutely no charm.  The only thing that was special was the carpet in the lobby.  If you're going to go to Ireland stay in an Irish hotel, otherwise you will feel as if you are in Chicago.",4,2016,10,28
240,Excellent stay and service,Was referred to this Hotel by a friend who had previously stayed here and was definitely worth the recommendation.  Rooms were very clean as well as the rest of the hotel.  Also is very centrally located to many of the sites and/or short bus or taxi ride.  Also a plus the hotel is one of the stops on the Hop on Hop off tours which made travel around the city very helpful.  The staff was also great as they helped with recommendations for things to do around Dublin.  Price rate was also very reasonable.,5,2016,10,27
240,A mixed bag.  Would rate it good.,"- very convenient if arriving/departing from Heuston Train Station (a short 5-10 min taxi ride to the hotel). Stayed 2 nights, 3rd floor.
- hotel is located a fair distance from central Dublin
- taxis always seemed to be avail @ front of hotel as the Kilmainham Jail (a very busy major tourist attraction) is right across the street. The Hop-on Hop-off buses stop there too (I hopped on a Yellow Cityscape bus across the st, paid 10.00 Euro to the driver, hopped off 2x during tour, then back on to return to hotel). Very convenient!
- req'd early check-in but rm not ready even @ 3:00 usual time
- desk clerk indifferent, he was very slow and just short of rude  
- another desk clerk was extremely nice & helpful. She recommended the Cityscape bus (turned out to be great) & helped me w/ other tourist info & fast track tickets 
- booked a King room (huge as a/ king & single bed in it) 
- modern, clean room, could have used a paint job as a bit scuffed up. A bit noisy fr the road traffic, but not too bad. Had nice sliding glass doors on closet, bar fridge, large desk and a safe.
- clean modern bathroom, comb shower/tub (shower was good)
- 1st night dinner @ 4 Corners at hotel - busy, noisy, slow service
  - 2nd night @ La Dolce Vita (above pub on the corner) excellent
- hotel's buffet breakfast was great. Large comfortable room, good selection. Good food, juice & coffee. Would also cook eggs to order. Specialty coffee machine where you could make your own to go. Very friendly and efficient service.
- * The good points outweighed the bad. I'm rating service average as some very good/some very bad.
- * I can't rate the location. It was good for me, but depends where you want to be.
- * The room was clean, the bed comfortable & the breakfast good so I would stay again if I wanted to be in that area of Dublin.    
If you stay, I recommend you take time to look at ""The Proclamation Sculpture"" located nearby the front of the hotel. The same sculptor created ""The Famine Sculpture"" by the Liffy which is also worth seeing.",4,2016,10,25
240,Great location,The only complaint is the waiter at the restaurant was rather slow despite the fact that there were only two other tables with guests.  He seemed more interested in flirting with other wait staff than tending to tables.,5,2016,10,25
240,Very nice!,"Staff was very friendly and helpful. Hotel was nice and clean. Pool/spa area, very nice. Nice location, although a little off the beaten path, but easy to get a cab or on the hop-on hop-off bus. View from our top floor room/ veranda.... amazing!",5,2016,10,25
240,The amazing service At hilton in dublin,"The service was awesome. The customer service is magnificent. The room, reception and hotel in general is emaculate. Just a small remarks with the replenishment of the amenities. If the customer/client left the room and left a note to a door to clean, the toiletries (soap,shampoo etc) should MUST always be checked and added. However everything is amazingly and i guess almost perfectly presented! I enjoyed my stay! Highly recommended hotel to anyone traveling to Dublin. ",4,2016,10,24
240,Great experience at the Hilton,"We spent four nights at the Hilton Kilmainham hotel on the first stop of a three week trip. We were thrilled with our stay! Although we arrived before 11 am, the front desk staff found us a room and we settled in. I had mentioned it was our anniversary, and they surprised us with a gift of wine and chocolates to help us celebrate! The hotel is directly across the street from Kilmainham Gaol, a top tourist attraction in Dublin. It also is right in front of the Irish Museum of Modern Art, with its picturesque arched entry. The only drawback of the hotel's location is that it is a little out of the main tourist areas, but there is public transportation very close by. Our room was spacious and clean, breakfast was filling and the coffee was great, and we had a delicious dinner of roasted salmon with creamed potatoes and pur√©ed peas (surprisingly tasty!) at the restaurant. Oh, and guests have access to a top notch exercise center downstairs with a fabulous pool, whirlpool bath, and steam room. Definitely worth a look, even if you don't use it!",5,2016,10,24
240,Very comfortable hotel,"I booked one night's stay here last minute and I was very pleased with my stay. The room was extremely comfortable for a basic room. It had a clean and luxurious bathroom with both tub and separate shower options. The location was a little further out from the main city centre then I would have preferred, but sill near many tourist attractions. I wish I could have stayed longer - would definitely consider booking again on my next trip to Dublin.",5,2016,10,23
240,Average ,"Below what you expect for Hilton

Not well maintained hotel 

Rooms are big but outdated 
Had a problem in a previous stay with a window 

Restaurant service normal not to nuch offer 

Room service is limited to availability and watch out if you're arriving late

Needs to improve and won't stay again if i get a better experience in other dublin hotel ",3,2016,10,23
240,Wish I Had Known,"Wish I had known how far out of the city center this hotel actually is.  And even more, I wish I had known that there was no easy way to get to this hotel short of walking a whole lot or taking a taxi (an option that we did not want to do).  I have fairly significant Hilton Honors points, and this hotel never seemed to care about that or not.  We were treated only slightly better than anyone coming in off the street with no connection to HiltonHonors. The food, bar, and basic service was only so/so and nothing beyond what you would expect if you were checking in to a random hotel with no reservations (ours were made a month or more in advance).  This was a total disappointment.  The only thing I got from this experience was some more points and a lot of irritation.",2,2016,10,23
240,Great experience,"Friendly staff, professional yet down to earth and really cares. Got at hotel early and staff was very attentive even thou room was not ready. She gave us a coffee coupon since we missed breakfast. She was very thougful and kind. Staff came and got me and advised when room became available .",5,2016,10,22
240,Nice hotel in a decent location,"Nice rooms, good location - right across the road from the Kilmainham Gaol, within walking distance of the Guinness Storehouse and Teeling Distillery.  Buffet breakfast was excellent, with a wide variety of choices (full Irish, pastries, oatmeal, meats & cheeses, good fresh fruit and whole honeycomb!).  The diggest downside was that the bar area was under reconstruction, which was very noisy, and the temporary bar - which was set up in the restaurant, was not very good.",4,2016,10,21
240,Not impressed at all and below what I would expect,"In short words:
Breakfast OK
Lunch (company meeting) rather poor with very little space, many damaged glasses
Room - hard to control the temp when colder, problems with hot water supply on 5th floor in the morning.... almost burned myself as it was switching from freezing cold to hot in secs
Not all power sockets were working
Meeting room- problems with aircon again which was very noisy
And finally.... could not get an invoice when checking out the night before so asked for bringing this to the room.... forgotten
Fixed price taxi rate which I was told by reception while booking was 27 euro... forget... 
generally i am very disappointed and do not consider to visit again
",3,2016,10,21
240,Lovely Hotel apart from renovations,"Lovely hotel, very clean, friendly and helpful staff. Construction noise due to renovation of bar area and temporary bar/dining area was not acceptable. I should have been made aware of the construction work when booking as I booked direct with the hotel",4,2016,10,17
240,Wonderful hotel!,"Had a fab time this weekend at this hotel! Clean and spacious rooms, delicious breakfast with plenty of choices, very friendly and helpful staff and amazing facilities including a pool and jacuzzi! Would highly recommend for all ages! Location is good too as its on the hop on hop off bus route! ",5,2016,10,17
240,Modern hotel in a good location,"Stayed for one night and it was very handy to Heuston Station and it's a nice location in Dublin with the benefit of the lovely former Royal Hospital and Kilmainham Gaol beside it. My room was at the front of the hotel and overlooked the Gaol which was very nice.

It's a pricey hotel but it's modern and well-finished. If I needed to stay again in this location I would opt for the Hilton. Staff were pleasant and the room was clean and comfortable.",4,2016,10,12
240,Price and Value?,"Considering the location of the hotel, the room charge should be better. Althought the charge and the content of the breakfast was satisfactory, the room quality is also okay, but the price of the room is not",3,2016,10,11
240,Great Choice,"Stayed here for two nights during our very brief Dublin visit and was extremely happy with the choice.  It is a bit removed from downtown, but that made it quiet and easily accessible.  Kilmainham Jail is literally across the street and happens to be on the three main hop-on hop-off stops.  Guinness Storehouse is an easy walk.

The staff were all exceptionally professional, polite and very helpful.  To get the day started on the right foot, I would highly recommend the buffet breakfast.  The food was outstanding with a wide selection sure to please everyone (thanks Fiona).",5,2016,10,10
240,Dublin - Hotel Kilmainham,"My family and I enjoyed our stay at this hotel. The staff was friendly and professional. We adored the bar staff especial Goran, and Robert for listening to our brand of crazy! This location is  walking distance to two attractions. The Hop on Hop off bus stop is across the street. You can walk to the grocery store, a bakery, coffee shop, two restaurants, pizza place, Chinese and Thai take out. Oh there is a nail salon, laundromat and pharmacy. If you feel up to it you can also walk to the Guinness Storehouse from the Hotel.",4,2016,10,09
240,Overall good value,I would visit again enjoyed my stay would have liked a dressing gown in my room.location very convenient to Hueston station.could breakfast start @ 06.30?hotel departure staff were very helpful and could not do enough for me.,4,2016,10,07
240,A Little Bit of Luxury,"Absolutely lovely hotel in a lovely location. Prices are a little high, but nice if you want to spoil yourself or someone special! The immediate area includes some great tourist attractions including Kilmainham Gaol, and also the National Museum of Modern Art and it's gardens, which are well worth a walk through!",4,2016,10,07
240,Nice Hotel; nice staff,"My wife and I were recently in Dublin for 3 nights for a special occasion and enjoyed staying  at the hotel.  Special thanks and shout outs to Shauna and Emma at the front desk who were both friendly and helpful.  The hotel is a bit out of town and about a 20-30 minute easy walk to the city center (or you can catch a cab for about 12 euros or it is a 5-10 minute walk  to the Dart station - take change with you for the DART ticket).  We have been to Dublin several times but we wanted something quiet and out of the hectic city center.  Some local attractions close to the hotel which we had not seen before but which are worth a visit are Phoenix Park, the Kilmainham Jail and the contemporary art museum.
.
We had dinner and drinks in the bar most nights and the food was good.  We had breakfast included in the package and the morning buffet while a bit pricey has a good selection of items including a fresh honey comb.  They will also make you whatever you want.  The majority of rooms have a/c but a few do not, so make sure you specify if traveling in the warmer months.

I don't typically write reviews but enjoyed staying there so wanted to give some positive feedback.",5,2016,10,07
240,First stop in our tour of Ireland,"It was a great first stop, we were able to exchange our $ into ‚Ç¨. Good clean rooms, good concierge service. Didn't get a chance to check out the cafe or pools though. 

Good location, you'll want a taxi to get back at night but during the day it's a nice walk in to town, or there is a bike rental stop nearby. 

",5,2016,10,06
240,Comfortable and modern with a nice spa and gym,"We got a modern, large, and comfortable room with a king-size bed, a separate couch, as well as a reading chair. The bathroom was spacious with both a bathtub and a separate shower. We especially enjoyed the spa- and gym area downstairs, with sauna, steam-room, Jacuzzi, and two pools. The breakfast was very nice, with a good selection of bread, cold- and hot dishes, and cereal. We ended up having dinner in the hotel restaurant two nights in a row, which was a pleasant experience. On the not so positive side, we felt that the hotel was a bit too far from the city center for our taste, with a walking-distance of around 40 minutes. Also, despite the technician having tried to fix it, the water pressure in the shower was so ridiculously poor that it was almost impossible to wash the hair. Finally, travelling with a baby and having booked a family room, the procedure for something as simple as heating baby food was unnecessarily complicated. It would have been great if they could just have a microwave somewhere close to the reception.",4,2016,10,03
240,HILTON DUBLIN KILHEIMAN,"A wonderful clean hotel with a great location to the prison kelheiman tour and arts museum.  Awesome restaurants close by.  City buses, drop on/off buses and taxis right outside the door.  If you don't want to be right down town with all the hustle and bustle this is an awesome hotel with friendly staff.",5,2016,10,03
240,It doesn't get much better than this,"Beautiful hotel with fantastic location.  The staff was very attentive, rooms were clean, very modern and well appointed, with comfortable beds. We ate in the restaurant for dinner and breakfast.  Both were delicious. The Hilton Kilmainham is located directly across the street from Kilmainham Gaol, which we toured.  It is also a 35-40 minute walk to Trinity College and Temple Bar.  I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,10,02
240,Place to Stay in Dublin,Keeps you walking the entire time you are in Dublin - and walking is the way to go traffic in the city is a pain..... This hotel is located right outside of the city center and gives you a perfect distance to all the attractions of the city Guinness house and all....,5,2016,10,02
240,Great stay!,"This was our first night in Ireland after a very long flight.  We couldn't have made a better choice.  The hotel was clean, comfortable, and the staff most accommodating.  Highly recommend and we will be back.",5,2016,10,01
240,Good Food,Four of us had dinner here at 3pm Saturday. Had just done kilmainham Gaol tour. Hotel Hilton directly across the road. Different meal for each of us. All were excellent. Choice of two mains for vegetarian. No space for dessert. Would go back again. Underground parking handy too. ,4,2016,10,01
240,Comfort Plus,Having stayed in multiple location through out our vacation the room and staff were excellent. Very close to the several of the sites we wanted to visit. The four corners restaurant was equally up to our food expectations.,5,2016,10,01
240,A very good night's sleep.,"This hotel is a little way out of Dublin centre but is perfect if you're looking to visit Phoenix Park or utilise Heuston Railway Station. It is also handy for other attractions to the west of the centre such as the Guinness Brewery. Transport links are very good. As you would expect from Hilton, check-in was quick and easy, staff very helpful and efficient, and the rooms spacious and very comfortable. Though I didn't have time to make use of them, facilities include a basement gym and pool. 
Dinner was served in the expansive corner bar which overlooks the street/main road and the food, value for money and service were very good.
Being slightly away from the hustle and bustle meant I had a lovely, peaceful night's sleep even with windows open - something I have found to be a rare thing in Dublin on previous visits. Recommended.",4,2016,10,01
240,Nice Treat,"Handy location and lovely decor. Room was large spacious and clean. Underground car parking was handy and staff were helpful and attentive.

All you would expect and more from doubletree. Rarely have issues with them and if you do they bend over backwards to accommodate you. Great chain. ",4,2016,09,30
240,Great stay,Room was very nice and very quiet. The food was really good. I really enjoyed my stay. The room was very clean and the bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was very nice and modern looking. I would come back here if I'm back in Dublin. ,5,2016,09,30
240,Do not bring your family,"We choose this hotel partly because of the great looking pool on the website.  However, when we went to use the pool, my wife, myself and our 10 year old son have to pay 6 Euros ($10.00 cdn) for 3 swim caps.  We thought this odd as several others were not wearing them in the pool and one person had a long beard.  But if that is a rule, then so be it.  The next night, after a long day of sightseeing, my son and I went for a swim, with our newly purchased swim caps, and were told that kids were not welcome after 7:00 p.m.  I explained that we were allowed in the pool the night before and that was why we bought their expensive swim caps.  I was rudely told that it was a mistake and kids are not welcome at night.  I went to the front desk to alert them to the issue and was told that a manager would contact me about it.  No one contacted me.  When we checked out, I again raised this issue and was told that they were aware of it and that a manager would contact me.  No one has.   I believe that the website should clearly state that the hotel and pool is NOT kid friendly and that families wishing to use the advertised amenities should go to another hotel.",2,2016,09,30
240,ONLY HAD LUNCH,"Although we only had lunch at the Hilton Kilmainham, it was a lovely experience.  The food was delicious and the service, although a bit slow, was very good.  The panna cotta for desert was excellent.  Also appreciated was the parking validation for the underground car park.",4,2016,09,29
240,Excellent Hotel,"This hotel - Hilton Kilmainham is an excellent hotel. Very well situated, very friendly and efficient staff - made me feel really welcome during my stay. Would highly recommend it to fellow travellers as a convenient base in Dublin.",5,2016,09,29
240,Very Comfortable & Pleasant Stay,"Staff were very friendly &helpful & the rooms clean & welcoming.  The bar was bright but the bar tender was dividing his attention between making coffees & serving at the bar, so service was sometimes slow.  Breakfast was very good",5,2016,09,29
240,Good Hotel. Great staff.,We had a really stay with two other couples. Enjoyed the sauna and spa as well. Dinner menu could have included more gluten free options. Besides that breakfast was very good. The hotel is not in the center but within reasonable walking distance.,4,2016,09,29
240,Nice hotel,The Hilton is a very nicely appointed hotel as you would expect from Hilton. The rooms are clean spacious and well equipped.  We stayed here after a week of touring Ireland and the whirlpool/pool area was a great way to relax.  This hotel is on the edge of town not really walking distance to any sites however there is a pub/restaurant across the street. ,4,2016,09,28
240,Well-looked after by lovely staff,Dublin hotels seem to be very expensive and this one was (relatively) good value. Nice quiet location by canal and right next to tram stop. We found nice restaurants within 10 minute walk along canal. Hotel was fine but nothing special but the staff were lovely and really went out of their way to make a fuss of my mum on this weekend forty celebrate her 90th birthday.,4,2016,09,27
240,Great place to stay!,Really enjoyed our stay.  Staff is very friendly and accommodating.  Breakfast was great. Close to Luas tram system. Across from Kilmainham Gaol.  Close to downtown but away from all the traffic and congestion.  Hop on hop off tourist buses stop in front of hotel.  Just perfect!,5,2016,09,25
240,"So-so Hilton, a bit far from everything","We stayed here for 2 nights recently.  The decor is a bit austere and a little dated, and both our rooms were quite small.  The staff was very accommodating, though, and the breakfast buffet was outstanding.  You are about 2 miles from the city center, and as was said earlier, the neighborhood is not very good at night.  We ate at an ""Irish/Italian"" restaurant nearby which was terrible.  We stayed here because we had accumulated Hilton points and the hotel is a good value for a Hilton, but I can't think of a reason you would stay here other than that.  Dublin has so many nicer and better located hotels to offer.  Oh, and one of the elevators kept breaking while we were on it trapping us inside.  We finally chose to walk up and down 3 flights of stairs rather than risk it for our last day there.",3,2016,09,24
240,High Priced Hotel with Average to Low Service,"The purpose of our stay was to have a business workshop in the Hilton. The hotel is about 2 miles away from downtown. The rooms were clean but could get a renewal. The breakfast and food was very good. However, the preparation of the meeting rooms and the checkout process was seriously bad. It seemed as we were forgotten and they started to prepare the room around 8:30 when the first participants entered. The conference phone was not working for the first hour and they brought 3 different projectors until one worked while the cables were scattered across the room and partly had to organize things on our own. Also the other equipment was poor: Just one flipchart and one board marker. The situation improved on the second day but overall it didn't seem to be professionally organized. In total, you can charge this high amount of money but then the customer can also expect to get a great & professional  service.",3,2016,09,23
240,Made us feel at home,"This hotel went out of their way to make us feel at home.  Pleasant and helpful front desk personnel, beautiful room & convenient location (right next to bus stop) made this a wonderful choice.  We'll be back!",5,2016,09,23
240,Not the best nor the worst Hilton,"Stayed here two nights during a Dublin visit. Advantages: convenient to Killmainham Gaol (must-see historic attraction) and hop-on-hop-off tourist busses. Also, nice staff. Disadvantages:  hotel a bit ""tired""/run down by Hilton standards. Neighborhood dies at 5 pm, except for slightly-dodgy pub across the street. Found two decent places to eat nearby, but was grateful we weren't staying a third night. ",4,2016,09,22
240,Special Event,"The room provided was excellent with nice views over museum gardens. The breakfasts were first class as was the evening meals taken in the Corner Bar. The staff were all very attentive, and helpful. The hotel amenities were good. Only one item concerning the room , and that was only one easy chair provided for a double occupancy. However, the veranda had a nice table and twin chair set, nice to sit out and have a coffee looking over the park.",5,2016,09,22
240,"Excellent stay, in the middle of everything","Loved our stay completely. In the middle of many main attractions. Ana at the front desk was a superb help when deciding what to do, we used a majority of her suggestions! Especially her recommendations for places to eat in town. She treated us like a King and Queen!",5,2016,09,20
240,"Very comfortable, conveniently located lodging!","Easy, safe walking distance to Guinness Storehouse.  Simple parking, warm staff and a very comfortable room! One of the more complete buffet breakfasts I have enjoyed.  An easy drive from Dublin airport, and a convenient location to pick up Dublin guided tour bus!",5,2016,09,19
240,Kilmainham,"Very nice hotel.  Expensive on the weekends.  Across from Kilmainham prision and art museum, so good for tours of both. About 10 minute bus or taxi ride to downtown Dublin, so quiet area.  Would stay here again.",5,2016,09,18
240,Excellent hotel,We stayed here for our wedding anniversary. Upon arrival Anna greeted us she was very welcoming and friendly. She suprised us with a free upgrade to king suite with balcony. She was excellent helped us with sight seeing and all other enquires. We then went to our room and was suprised with lovely bottle of prossecco and chocalates with a personlised anniversary card. Hotel was very clean very nice rooms and breakfast was lovely alot of selection for everyone. Close to tour bus routes and local tourist attractions . Would highly recommend and i will be staying here again when i come back to Dublin ‚òò,5,2016,09,18
240,Great Stay Again,Enjoyed my return trip of 5 nights at the Hilton Kilmainham.  Front desk staff were excellent and helped answer all questions.  The location is nice; near many attractions yet a bit away from the hustle of city center.  I highly recommend this hotel and the great staff for a stay in beautiful Dublin,5,2016,09,18
240,Quality as expected,"There were three of us in the room, which was enormous with a view of Kilmainham Gaol - Ireland's #1 ranked tourist attraction. Across the road there is a lovely quaint pub on the corner; I would recommend stopping for Guinness Pie. 

The hotel was immaculate, particularly the bar, and our rooms were tidied daily. The staff are polite and happy to help you at any time. 

The taxis into the centre of Dublin can be quite expensive but this is the case for all taxis around the city.",5,2016,09,15
240,Amazing,Renata was amazing. She was extremely helpful and very professional. She provided us with a map of Dublin and told us all the cool spots to go to. Her male coworker was also great. He assisted with printing the jail tickets across the street. ,5,2016,09,14
240,great hotel and excellent stay.,"Wonderful and helpful staff, great breakfast buffet with fresh foods and made to order as well, large room with two American queen size beds... slept 3 adults comfortably, very clean.... and very quiet",5,2016,09,13
240,Happy Surprise All the Way Around!,"We were treated to a first rate hotel experience from the time of arrival until departure.  The hotel is supremely clean, fresh, and in a great location for seeing the city though not amid the most chaotic and noisy tourist sections of Dublin - which is a plus after two weeks of travel.  The dinner and breakfast offerings were delicious and better than most other Hiltons.  Staff were exceptional compared to other Hilton locations we stayed in Ireland and Northern Ireland... this was our favorite Hilton hotel stay among many world-wide!! ",5,2016,09,13
240,Excellent stay!,"The best experience! Ana was a terrific help, she suggested places to go, to eat. We did it all! The rooms were excellent! The breakfast is excellent! We had a great experience! Thank you Ana, if we ever come back, we will come here!",5,2016,09,12
240,Very goodqualityplace,Very goods comparison and services. Great because near the Phoenix park. Half way between outskirts Of Dublin for work and city center. Great location of you want to exercise in the morning as the park is just one km away,5,2016,09,11
240,Excellent service,From front desk to restaurant service I would rate this Hilton hotel the best. Staff are very courteous and offer assistance to your needs. Monika who served us at the restaurant provided excellent service with a smile. She's definitely an asset to the hotel. We were also assisted by Emma with our hotel accommodations. She did her made it possible to switch 2 rooms for our families to stay on one floor instead of different floors. Very stressful especially if the rooms were already assigned. Excellent staff and service. When we visit Dublin again we will definitely stay at Hilton Dublin Kilmainham again. Thank you!!!!,5,2016,09,08
240,Vacation,"Over all the hotel experience was great,all the staff was very courteous and helpful ,friendly and wiling to offer to make stay pleasant, the dinning room staff especially Monika was extra nice to start a long day,location close to everything, few distance to the tram and buses, we are  ...  walker . we don't mind.
Just a friendly comment I pulled my muscles on my side arm torso cause it was heavy to carry our luggage so to the. lobby,.the taxi driver disembarked us at the side street,we could not find a way to carry our luggages, upon arrival no sign ramp at the other side of the building,.being seniors a by stander helped us carry our staff up the stairs then to the lobby,",4,2016,09,08
240,lovely overnight stay in town,stayed on the 27th August.From our check in to departure we could not have had better service. Before I booked I spoke to Cate in reservations and she was very helpful and organised a stunning room for us. the chocolates left in the room for my husbands birthday was a welcome surprise. Breakfast was tasty and hot. Ana on reception was so helpful and pleasant. I look forward to returning.,5,2016,09,07
240,Clean,Stayed here for a festival close by at Royal Hospital Kilmainham (Forbidden Fruit). Decent stay and room as expected. Did not eat so no comments. Good underground parking area. Would stay again if I was in this area of Dublin. ,4,2016,09,07
240,Very nice hotel,This was a very nice hotel with large comfortable rooms.  The indoor pool was fantastic.  The breakfast was great and very reasonably priced.  I would stay again.  The location was on the hop-on-hop-off buses route and across from a famous museum and jail.,4,2016,09,06
240,Very Nice,"Traveled to Dublin for a college football game.  We stayed at the Hilton across from the Kilmainham Gaol.  The rooms are very nice and clean.  The air conditioning in the room works which was nice compared to the rooms we had in other parts of Europe.  There is a nice breakfast buffet that is well worth the ‚Ç¨12.  The ONLY reason I did not rate this as a 5 is because of location and it is not conveniently located near the heart of the city.  If that doesn't matter to you, then you should love this place.",4,2016,09,04
240,Nice Hotel - off the beaten path,"We were at this hotel with a large group, but found it very convenient as a site to visit the Gaol and the Guinness Brewery.  There are a couple of very good neighborhood restaurants near by.  The hotel was modern with a good breakfast buffet.",4,2016,09,01
240,Stay in Dublin,This Hilton location was great! Great service all around. The front desk suggested several fun things to do including the Celtic Nights Dinner and Music. Restaurant and bar were convenient. Good food and drinks!,5,2016,09,01
240,Nice spot beside the gaol,"Assigned a very nice room on the 5th with a balcony overlooking the Gaol and art museum.
Room was modern and well equipped. Staff very helpful and friendly with advice on restaurants.
Close to Guinness storehouse as well and the zoo. 
Breakfast buffet in the morning was great.
On site bar was fine with a patio. 

",4,2016,08,31
240,Great services,"If you do not want to feel the vibe of the inner city, but have an easy access to down town and a short walk distance to Guinness Storehouse, that is the place. Not cheap, but very good quality. The stuff was very helpful, Monika the Hungarian waitress was very supportive and also recpommended great family programs.",5,2016,08,31
240,Nice place to stay. ,"Went on holiday. We had a good stay. Place is clean, restaurants are good. Front desk people not all very knowledgeable or wanting to help.  I recommend this place for people that are Hilton members or not mind staying far from the noise of downtown.  ",4,2016,08,31
240,Great Experience,"Very friendly staff, clean rooms, great breakfast buffet, and fairly cheap parking (compared to some downtown Dublin parking). Only 30 min drive to airport and 5 min drive (2 km) from downtown Dublin. Definitely walk-able in nice weather.",5,2016,08,31
240,Hilton quality at a reasonable price (for Dublin),"We choose this Hilton in Dublin for the following reasons: to stay far from the traffic, to have easy access and parking for our car, to stay in a quite area (and close to friends and the Guinness Storehouse) and to pay a decent price for good quality.

I think I can honestly said we have achieved all of the above by staying at Hilton Kilmainham.

Everything was up to Hilton standard, from service to the room in general. Dublin is very expensive and to stay belove 200‚Ç¨ per night we had to find a good offer for this hotel, but I'm pretty sure it's not easy to find this quality at this price.

It is not really at walking distance from city center (could take about 45 minutes walk), but in 10-15 minutes I can get to the Guinness Storehouse which is a must for a visit in Dublin. Best option for city center is taxi, which is about 12‚Ç¨ for a 10 minutes ride... so not that bad!

Worth to be considered if it's ok for you if the location is not a problem.",4,2016,08,31
240,Very average ,"Fine big rooms, comfortable & clean. Welcome at reception was warm & efficient.  Location is great, just outside city centre but quite accessible. Good base for exploring the city. Hop On Hop Off tourist bus stops directly across the road.

I would however query the 4 star rating. I ate outside as it was a warm evening. I had to go back inside to request a menu, no staff Ian sight. It took an age before someone came to clear down the table & take an order. The food arrived promptly but was very mediocre. Chicken wings were overflowing in a flavourless sauce and the lamb shank was tough & tasteless. The breakfast was ok, nothing wonderful. I visited the thermal suite, claustrophobic changing area and half the water jets were not operating. Not even close to 4*.",3,2016,08,31
240,Family room,"We stayed here during a visit to Dublin Zoo and Tayto Park. 

Upon arrival we were checked in quickly and the receptionist was very helpful. He presented our 2 children with a little goodie bag which they loved.

Our room was big enough for us all and was clean and equipped with everything we could need including a fridge.

Dinner was lovely, and service was good. The o let thing I would suggest is children friendly cutlery and glassware.

This hotel is places well for Dublin zoo (approx 2 mines away) and Tayto Park (30 mins away).

We will definitely come back.
",5,2016,08,30
240,Perfect for visiting jail or IMMA,"The hotel room was thoroughly appreciated after 2 weeks of staying at small, local Inns.  Having a mini fridge, lots of towels, a roll away bed, king sized bed, and all the toiletries was like coming home again.  So, it's not big on local charm but it is on comfort.  The pool was wonderful - my daughter and husband really enjoyed it - but be sure to wear flip flops.  Staff was less than well-informed though.  When I asked for a robe at the fitness center, they sent me to the main desk.  At the main desk, they sent me to the fitness center.  Both employees said they were new there.  Same type of thing int he Pub.  Excellent food, but service was slow and both servers were a bit bewildered by the menu.  They need to train and keep their employees to make this a more personal and welcoming experience.  I felt like I had to tell them what we were supposed to get at Honors members.",4,2016,08,30
240,Nice Hotel and nice staff,"We started our holidays there and finished too. We were treated very well and loved breakfast and spa. Good location, well connected. Located a little out of noisy downtown, we found the hotel staff to be friendly and helpful, the rooms and beds to be very comfortable.",4,2016,08,30
240,So so hotel that has potential of so much more,"The hotel is right across from the Kilmainham Gaol and less than a mile from Guinness and .5 miles from a beautiful to walk or run park.  Buss to the center city is also pretty simple.  Staff was not very helpful for many requests that would be easily managed by most hotels. This, I think is reflective of current management and hopefully will be remedied.",3,2016,08,29
240,Great value from big brand hotel,"Located a little out of noisy downtown, we found the hotel staff to be friendly and helpful, the rooms and beds to be very comfortable, and the restaurant food to be of great quality, if not adventurous. We will book there again for next trip. ",4,2016,08,25
240,Meetings ,"Stayed here for business meeting. 
Reception very attentive and pleasant on arrival. Wifi excellent through Out hotel. Rooms very clean and tidy with excellent facilities. Television choices were fantastic best of come across. 
Bar and food was good but menu very limited. Food itself was very good. 
Well recommend a visit ",4,2016,08,25
240,Great vacation stay in Dublin,"My family stayed at the Hilton Kilmainham Hotel in Dublin on our recent vacation.  We were very pleased with the quality of the hotel and the professionalism of the staff.  We arrived at 8:30 am from the airport, and we were provided a secure area for our luggage since our room was not ready. We had a great Irish breakfast before leaving on our Tour of Dublin.  We like that the hotel was away from the center of Dublin--it was quieter with less traffic.  A taxi was readily available in front of the hotel.  We would definitely stay here again when in Dublin.",5,2016,08,25
240,A bit far from town,"Hotel lookover Kilmainham prison. Taxi cost around 12‚Ç¨ to go to temple bar or around there. 28‚Ç¨ to go to Dublin airport. Room is clean as a hilton standard. Check in abit slow also hotel didnt provide fast checkout service. Got very good gym and indoor swimming pool under hotel basement. Overall is good as 4stars hilton standard.
Ps. If they clean aircon i might gave 5stars",4,2016,08,25
240,"Great stay, beautiful hotel!","Great stay! I was only here for one night and that's too bad. Hotel was either new or newly remodeled. Rooms were large. Location was good but you were all the way down one end of Dublin. We liked walking so it was ok but just know where you are staying. Staff was friendly. I didn't eat breakfast but my mother did and she's not always the easiest to please and she told me it was ""beautiful"". That means it was great! My 16 year old niece went to the pool and loved it. I didn't see it buy my mother said there was a guard there and she felt my niece was safe alone. Wish I had two nights there. Really had a nice stay. Thanks to the team!",5,2016,08,23
240,Unfortunately let down due to adjoining room,"The hotel is clean and the staff were friendly. Breakfast was reasonable. The location for us was ideal (concert next door), though for many of the city attractions it would be far out.

It was however let down by the room allocated. We had an adjoining room (door between ours and the next room) which offered no privacy and for soundproofing may as well not have had  a door at all. We could hear everything said, every noise of the tv, them brushing their teeth, opening a can of drink, as if it were in our own room. Of course the reverse would be true for them of us. It was impossible to sleep before they decided also to. As a smaller secondary thing. You will not be allowed in the pool without a hair net / swim cap. No other pool I have ever been to in the world has asked for this, and you are not told anywhere in advance. The pool also holds classes in the already small pool which does not leave you much pportunity to use the facilities. Be aware.

I want to note that although this is largely an unfortunately negative review, we did not express this at the time to staff and therefore gave them no chance to rectify the problem. It is very possible that they may have been able to swap rooms, or that we may just have been unfortunate. I would however strongly recommend you request not to have  and do not settle for an adjoining room if you wish to have any privacy or sleep.",2,2016,08,23
240,Great Hotel to Visit Dublin,"We stayed for the weekend recently & it was a great base to visit Dublin from.

It's a good walk into town (25-30mins) but do-able ok if you like walking, which we did. We got a cab back one day and it cost ‚Ç¨12. There's a nice pub opposite as well & the gym/spa was a nice bonus. 

All the staff were polite, professional & friendly and I would definitely return there when next going back to Dublin. ",5,2016,08,23
240,Nice and quiet place,"This is one of the best hilton hotel I stayed with my family. 

Lot of attractions within a walking distance. Main train and bus stops are just a 10 minutes walk away.
Very nice staff and keep hilton standard. 

Nice breakfast and had a dinner in a near by Italian restaurant which is excellent and cheap.",4,2016,08,23
240,"Great Location, Great Beds, Great Pool!","We spent our last 2 nights in Ireland at this hotel and so happy we chose Hilton. Very clean, comfy beds, relaxing heated pool and hot tub. All the employees were fantastic and always ready with a smile to answer any of our questions. Highly recommend this hotel...easy access to bus or taxi, just across street from Kilmainham Gaol.",5,2016,08,21
240,Well managed hotel,It's a shame this hotel isn't a little more centrally located. This Hilton is very well run with helpful staff and great rooms.  Front desk staff can't do enough to help. I didn't get the chance to try the food so can't comment. Taxi into the city centre was ‚Ç¨13,4,2016,08,21

Have recently returned from a 4 night stay at the Hilton Hotel in Kilmainham, Dublin -
have never felt motivated to write a review before but this stay has prompted my first 
ramblings.... so here goes.
First off, the hotel is situated in a lovely part of Dublin, opposite the Kilmainham 
Hospital, which used to be a hospital for recovering service men and women but is 
now a conference and events centre and also the Irish Museum of Modern Art. It is 
also opposite Kilmainham Jail, which is now a museum.
There is also a great little pub and restaurant directly opposite the hotel called the 
Patriot where the food in the restaurant is superb and reasonably priced.
You are about a 2 minute walk from the bus stop which takes you directly into Dublin 
and about a 6-8 minute walk from the tram that also takes you into Dublin and for us 
took us directly to the train station in Connelly Street to catch a connection to a little 
fishing village called Howth (well worth a visit especially the Bloody Stream Pub buy 
the railway station and apparently Crabby's Jo is recommended by the hotel staff but
we couldn't get in on the day.) Public transport in Dublin is really cheap, it's also 
regular, efficient and clean.
As to the hotel itself, mixed reviews really. Firstly it is not cheap (at the time it was 
177 Euros per room per night - this was a discounted rate as we were there as part 
of a wedding party) but we knew the cost before we got there so that is not an issue.
The room itself was spacious, clean and comfortable - all you could ask for really so 
no complaints there. One small issue was there was only one towel per person so if 
you want more you have to ask - personally I like two but again no real big issue.
Breakfast was okay if not spectacular but plenty of choice although some of the 
products were on the cheap end of the scale.
The service from reception was excellent with really good advice about public 
transport and how best to get to various destinations. Requests for a fan or room 
service were prompt and efficient with staff utmost polite but not cheesily so!!!
There were two main issues that let the hotel down. 
Firstly the service in the bar was shocking. Service from the all the staff, except the 
bar manager, was slow in as much as it took anything between 10 and 20 minutes to
be served - now bearing in mind that we were there for 4 nights and five days as part
of a large wedding party, the numbers of staff were sufficient and even on the 
Sunday when the majority of the wedding party had gone, service was still slow and 
sporadic. Orders were regularly wrong, whilst offering cocktails they very rarely 
wanted to produce them - not sure they could be bothered rather than they didn‚Äôt 
have the ingredients. The only saving grace was the bar manager himself who was 
efficient polite and accommodating.
The second issue is a company issue I suppose. We decided to stay an extra night 
at the end of the planned stay so went to reception to enquire about room availability.
We were given a price of 199 Euros including breakfast so we said we would think 

about it as we had a hotel booked elsewhere. My wife went on line and immediately 
found it on the hotel website at 155 Euros!!! So we booked it, stayed in the same 
room and then went home. I emailed the hotel just to enquire why we couldn‚Äôt have 
been given that price at reception and the reply was linked to systems, non 
transferable rates etc but I just didn't see the logic to this as we were standing in 
front of them trying to extend our stay yet were given a non competitive rate. There 
website provides a price guarantee but that appears to not extend to the staff on 
reception (I am not blaming the staff here but merely pointing an illogical system). 
Ironically we also able to get a cheaper rate than the bride and groom had managed 
to get when they were guaranteeing a fairly sizeable contingent of guests for a 3 
night stay!!! 
Anyway as I said a fairly mixed review - would I recommend it to others - not sure to 
be honest but hopefully the information is helpful in helping you decide your choice in
the future.
PS If you go to Dublin town centre - personal view is to stay away from the Temple 
Bar pub - complete rip off in my humble opinion and full of people wandering round 
taking pictures!!!",3,2016,08,21
240,Very good hotel,"Reception staff very helpful, we upgraded our room which was an excellent choice. We were on the 5th floor at the front of the hotel and the view was excellent.

Ate in the bar on the two nights we stayed. Food was excellent on both occasions Chef to be complimented. Service the first night was great however on the second night it was really awful, could not get anyone's attention for almost half an hour to have our order taken, mustard requested never came etc., really poor.

Breakfast was excellent on both mornings and the staff at breakfast were also excellent. 

Hop on/off bus has a stop just accross the road which is really handy.",4,2016,08,20
240,Dublin Gaol,"Great place from which to discover the delights of the Irish economy and culture; friendly welcome, good surroundings and walking distance to get a connecting tram into the centre. Lovely leisure facilities; pool spa sauna gym etc. and useful opening times.",4,2016,08,19
240,This was a great hotel to stay.,"We had family that stayed in down town Dublin. My wife and I got to know the bus system very well over a weeks time, all within a block of the hotel. Hotel staff was very helpful. Great stay, hope to come back one day.",5,2016,08,18
240,Very nice,Hotel was very nice. Rooms were excellent and majority of staff very helpful and nice. Saya I believe her name was from the bar was excellent and couldn't of been anymore helpful. Major upset was that I ordered two bottles of water (1.5 litres) to my room which was not only an hour late but also cost 17 Euro. But overall a very good experience.,4,2016,08,18
240,Leisure ,Stayed here wit my friend we really enjoyed are stay everyone was so nice and polite. I would highly recommend this hotel and it's in a great location . And also has a pool üòâ plus a complimentary upgrade in arrival. The front desk staff are a credit to the hotel ,5,2016,08,18
240,Happy Kids + Excellent Breakfast,"We've just returned from our second stay at the hotel (this time with our 4 and 1 year old) and were very impressed.  Rooms are well appointed, spacious, with modern facilities and extremely comforable beds - even as a family of four in a room, we did not feel one bit cramped.  Breakfast is excellent; options ranges from a traditional irish cooked breakfast, to a range of delicious pastries, cold meat cuts, cheeses and fruit.  Poached eggs were delicious.  The kids especially enjoyed the pool area, and I have to mention the excellent staff in the leisure centre who provided our four year old with floats and a ball to play with - it really is the small things that leave a great impression.  We will be back!",5,2016,08,17
240,Wedding trip,In Dublin for my sons wedding. Hotel in great situation. Staff were great. Rooms lovely.food excellent. Would strongly recommend to anyone visiting Dublin. Will certainly be back as much to see in the area,5,2016,08,16
240,Great stay,We enjoyed our stay at this hotel. I liked the location because it was not directly in the middle of the crowded tourist area.  The hotel was modern and had numerous amenities that we enjoyed.  The staff was helpful and friendly. ,5,2016,08,16
240,Good Training/conference venue,"Attended a training course held at this hotel. Training Room and facilities excellent and comfortable. Projection facilities etc where good. Good coffee and refreshments. Lunch was excellent. 

Parking available under hotel. 

Easily accessible from the motorway. ",5,2016,08,16
240,mc kenna family reunion,"Wonderful location . Close to  Kilmainham Jail , and Museum . Also the  Royal Hospital and The War Memorial Gardens.  Could not fault the hotel . Food very good and staff very friendly and helpful.
Lovely old Dublin   Pub opposite,  The Patriot. Great pint of Guinness. 
Very central and close to City Centre on Bus route. Excellent Leisure Club and Spa.   Italian Restaurant  overhead very good.",4,2016,08,15
240,Superb service and attention to detail.,"An excellent experience. Every business need met and when my daughter flew to meet me for an extended stay/vacation, they were completely accommodating, going to the trouble of getting her breakfast on a day she slept in past the buffet time. Lovely staff, good food, incredibly clean. Thanks for a GREAT Dublin stay. ",5,2016,08,15
240,A fantastic stay,"Stayed here for a second time, had a great stay again, children loved the pool.
Hotel staff were the best, nothing was too much trouble. Breakfast was excellent, great choice of food.
Had a great time and will be going back again.",5,2016,08,14
240,Cracking Hotel,"Lovely hotel... and the little Canadian waitress was lovely, very very pleasant girl! When j next travel to Dublin I will be sure to stay in the same place. The food was absolutely fantastic, burgers are difficult to get spot on but you nailed it!",5,2016,08,12
240,Excellent staff and great location,"Stayed at the hotel while attending Once the Musical in the Olympia(excellent show). 
The hotel is in an ideal location, very close to a Luas stop which leaves it easily accessible. 
Having stayed at many hotels in Dublin, the Hilton is definitely above standard. The hotel itself was especially clean and the bed so comfortable. 
We were lucky to get a room with lovely views aswell. Breakfast was lovely, bakery selection particularly good.
Upon entering the hotel, it was clear that the staff really made this hotel. From a friendly welcome from both the manager on duty,Alan,and the receptionist(apologies cant remember her name) It was nice to meet staff who appeared to like and be proud of their jobs. It is really nice to meet housekeeping staff who go out of their way to say good morning. These are minor details but ones which really put this hotel ahead of the rest! Will definitely return.",5,2016,08,12
240,Not in the centre and a bit dated,"The hotel is not in the city centre but there are buses or you can walk ca 40 minuted to get to e.g. St Patrick cathedral. Transport for the airport can be expensive as no train, metro connection. Taxi cost was ca 40 EUR. The hotel is a bit dated already, but rooms are big, as gold HH I was up-graded to deluxe room, got 1 voucher for a drink in the bar and offered breakfast. Breakfast is plentiful, full English option, lots of cold cuts, and usual cereals, yoghurt and fruits with quick and efficient service.
Hotel is located opposite Kilmainham jail and Museum of Modern Arts with beautiful gardens, both worth visiting.",3,2016,08,11
240,"Clean, quiet and very helpful staff","This is a great hotel outside of city centre but still close enough to Heuston Station (and IMMA and Kilmainham Jail). The staff was very helpful and the rooms were comfortable. The only gripe is that our two twin beds were on wheels and with the slightest movement slid away from the wall. Great gym, pool, sauna and steam room. I'd stay here again!",5,2016,08,09
240,Quick Overnight,"Accommodations were great.  Comfortable bed, nice box of chocolates  waiting in room. But it was the very nice and helpful staff that made this quick overnight a great stay. Front desk, bar staff and breakfast staff were helpful and friendly.  ",5,2016,08,09
240,Brilliant in Dublin,"Food was great, service was top notch, room was clean and spacious, front desk staff was attentive, location was close to the action including the Guiness Brewery, needless to say our stay was without a hitch",5,2016,08,08
240,"Staff friendly, clean room and convenient location.",Staff helped getting us a more suitable room for a young family. Clean room's and great facilities. Close to tour bus routes so easy to get around. Breakfast was great with plenty of options. Parking rate is ‚Ç¨12 per night so could leave our car and use public transport.,5,2016,08,08
240,Nice Stay,"Very Clean, Great Breakfast & Event rooms. A little out of way of Dublin ,Walk to Tram Ok. Good and Quiet.Had a Family Reunion Worked well.We used Event rooms on two nights & Staff was Great. Would Stay Again.",4,2016,08,08
240,Really lovely hotel,"Fantastic staff, lovely bar, great breakfast and fabulous location make for a great stay. This hotel is around a 15 minute walk to both the Guinness Storehouse and Dublin Zoo. It sits opposite the Gaol, and there is a great bar and Italian restaurant over the road. There are multiple close bus stops - both local buses and the sightseeing tour buses.",5,2016,08,08
240,If you want Irish Hospitality Stay at B&B instead ,This is not a 4 star worthy hotel. 4 walls and a bed it gets the job done but nothing special. Most of the staff are not native to Ireland and its just another corporate hotel so you don't get the hospitality you do from other places. They change your card $50 euro a night in case you make charges that doesn't get refunded to up to 7 days after you check out. Also the food was not very good in my opinion. Also not the best location.,3,2016,08,06
240,Highly recommended - Thank you Sorin & team.,"I would like to personally thank Monika, Elisa, & Sorin for their excellent hospitality during our visit to Dublin this week. I proposed to my partner on the grounds of Kilmainham goal on Weds. and after I popped the question we headed straight across the street to the Hilton because my partner (whoops, fiancee now!) needed a drink & was obviously in a state of shock. Monika made us feel right at home & Sorin presented us with celebratory prosecco & strawberries on the house. We stayed for several hours and really enjoyed the food in the restaurant later that day.",5,2016,08,06
240,Will book again !,"Great hotel with lovely helpful staff, very quiet & comfortable rooms, breakfast, plenty of choice and offered verious ways of cooked egg to order.  Convenient to City and train station, my colleague and l walked into town, so not far.",5,2016,08,05
240,"Lovely Hotel, Excelent Staff & Great Loation","From the time we checked in, until we left, the staff were very efficient, friendly and helpful.

Our room was on the 4th floor, overlooking Kilmainham Gaol and with a ovely view of the Dublin Mountains. The room was a good size, with a large window area (great light & views), a very confortable bed and spotlessly clean.

We had a lovely evening meal, in the very pleasant bar area - the food and choices were very good and the service was excellent.

There is also a nice seating area in the reception and with floor to ceiling windows, you can relax with a coffee or a drink and watch the world go by. If the weather pernits there is also some nice seating outside the hotel on the Kilmainham Gaol side.

The location is great, with Kilmainham Gaol just across the street. The hop on, hop off Dublin Tour Buses stop there.

The Phoenix Park (Aras an Uachtaran, Popes Cross, Dublin Zoo, etc.) is also close by.

We found a lovely old Dublin pub (The Patriot) just across fron the hotel and it has a great pint of Guiness!!

So all in all, we are looking forward to our next stay in the Hilton Kilmainham!",5,2016,08,05
240,modern,I recently stayed here with friends and had a very enjoyable stay. The room was lovely and as there was three of us we had 3 single beds which were very comfortable but one of my friends bed had a leg missing and had to prop it up with her book!!! .The book was still under it when we arrived back on our second night even though the room had been clened . A bit disappointing but otherwise we enjoyed the food in restaurant and the bar and the bar staff were very friendly,5,2016,08,04
240,Post wedding BBQ,We had our post wedding BBQ and over night stay at the Kilmainham Hilton. The staff  were friendly and very helpful and the food was excellent. The rooms were spacious and comfortable with great views of the IMMA and Kilmainham Gaol and Anna at reception was very helpful and made you feel very welcome. ,5,2016,08,04
240,"Excellent surrounding, very helpful staffs, good bed, very clean furnishings, good breakfast service","For breakfast I only care if coffee is  ""right""   I don't like machine-made instant coffee.  But they made freshly brewed coffee for me personally.
Taxi fee to city shopping and entertaining center is 10-13 Euro, which is reasonable. Bus service also available.
",4,2016,08,03
240,Reasonable Hotel compared to the 4*,The hotel is situated just at the edge of the centre and down town can be reached easily. My room was to the back of the building so relatively quite other than that one morning the truck driver picking up the dirty laundry kept his lorry running for 20 minutes (at 05:30) and the hotel did not stop him. Breakfast buffet is reasonably good. I was missing a mini bar and the staff could have been a bit more friendly.,3,2016,08,03
240,Hilton Kilmainham Dublin City,"I organised a family gathering for 100 family members, the Hotel gave amazing assistance. The help and care shown by staff made the event very successful and made all the participants feel very welcome.",5,2016,08,02
240,city break,Great hotel very pleasant stay lovely breakfast good location and comfortable bed for a good nights sleep what more could you ask for can't wait for the next city break staying in a Hilton hotel staff very friendly..,4,2016,08,02
240,"Great location, nice rooms .... but don't pay full price!","We stay here regularly due to it's location within walking or Luas (depending on how fit you are) to the city centre. It is perfect for visiting the zoo, Modern art museum and Kilmainham jail. The rooms are very nice, great beds, clean ... particularly the family rooms. Breakfast is fabulous with a wide array of cooked breakfasts and pastries. If you book online they sometimes appear not to have a room for 4 (2 adults+2kids), but if you phone them they can arrange the room for you (usually). However, it has gotten very expensive in the past few years and I have started to stay else where.",4,2016,08,02
240,Dublin trip,"overall very enjoyable stay at this hotel.
only concern was that the gym equipment could do with a good service as some of it is worn and damaged.
would not pay to use or join .
staff very good and helpful.

",4,2016,08,01
240,Epically Amazing!,"This hotel was the icing on a spectacular trip. It had very clean rooms and top notch service. Ana, a concierge, was completely amazing and very helpful at helping us navigate the sites we wanted to see. About 25 minutes from the airport, and ten minutes from the main center of town, it's also right across the street from Kilmainham Gaol, which was both amazing and heartbreaking at the same time. The breakfast was also incredible, with so many different food options available. I will definitely stay here again, and would recommend anybody visiting Dublin to stay here as well. ",5,2016,07,31
240,You don't get what you pay for - very disappointing,"My husband and I stayed in Dublin for 2 nights. The hotel has seen better days - it's clean , but tatty. The breakfast was appalling - cheap food in a hot dull room with miserable staff.
The only good thing about the hotel was the bed - it was extremely comfy.
Our friends were staying at The Ashling which is cheaper but far better in every way. ",3,2016,07,31
240,Excellent example of the Hilton Brand,"From the front desk getting us a room before noon to the really nice meal outside  the bar on the patio it was one of our better stays. Very large room for a hotel in europe. All the stuff you expect from the brand and everyone we interacted with was helpful and friendly. Breakfast buffet is really good, well worth the money. Pool is quite nice and gym is far better than most.

Only drawback is that it is a bit tricky to get to using public transportation. It can be done, and all the tour busses stop right in front of the hotel, but not as close to the 747 Airlink as the bus info makes it out to be. The location is nice as it is across the street from 2 attractions and a very nice pub. There is a small grocery store a couple of blocks away so in all a good location. Also very quiet in the evening and good beds make it very restful.",5,2016,07,30
240,Perfect for visiting the zoo,This is the 2nd time I have stayed at the Hilton with my daughter for visiting Dublin Zoo. The staff were lovely and helpful and the room was a good size and clean. My daughter enjoyed swimming in the pool and there was a children's menu for dinner in the bar. Breakfast was good too and the hotel is within walking distance of the zoo (although we took a taxi). I would recommend staying there to anyone visiting the zoo or the sights in Dublin. ,5,2016,07,30
240,Lovely stay,"Booked this for my mum on her recent trip to Dublin,  its slightly out of the centre but close enough to walk (20 mins or so)

the hotel has a nice relaxed vibe and is next to Kilmainham jail a must visit in coming to Dublin",5,2016,07,30
240,Hilton standard,"Nice clean rooms, parking and good location. Although the beds should be more comfortable. Service and staff very good. Breakfast was also good Maybe more fresh fruits will be fine. Gym downstairs maybe need modernize a bit.",4,2016,07,30
240,Great rooms and pool,Clean comfortable rooms and the pool was excellent. Friendly staff at the gym who were great and accommodating with the kids! The food was excellent in the evening and at breakfast. I highly recommend the lamb shank!,5,2016,07,30
240,Great! but ugly situation!,"The hotel is fine, clean and good location. Staff is friendly. I was here to do business the location is great because by night you can go to Temple bar by bus (13 or 40 # in 15-20 minutes) and to go industrial area you can take M50 and M4 quickly. The only thing is: When my mate arrived to the hotel at 9 a.m. from U.S the hotel didn't give him any room to change clothes or take a shower. He had to use the shower of the gym. This kind of the thing for this kind of the hotel is not fair from my point of view.",4,2016,07,29
240,GREAT PLACE!!!,"Only stayed here because Dublin Hilton Airport fooled up our booking and couldn't accommodate us.  Got here at around 2:00 - 2:30 in the morning.  Gentleman at front desk on July 13 (sorry didn't get his name) could not do enough for us.  He was one of the nicest people I met in Dublin during our stay.  Of both the Hiltons, would definitely go back to this one in the future.  Even bartender was so nice.  To accommodate us at this time of the morning and to be so nice was certainly a breath of fresh air after the treatment we received at the by the Dublin Hilton Airport.",4,2016,07,28
240,Fantastic hotel!,"The Hilton Dublin Kilmainham is a fantastic hotel. Great service, friendly staff, and located just outside the city center meaning less noise but still close enough to easily take a bus, tram, cab, or walk to points of interest!",5,2016,07,28
240,A Great Hilton in the Heart of Dublin,"We stayed at the Killmainham Hilton in Dublin for 3 days. There is a lot of history in Dublin and this is a good central point for your time in Dublin. We enjoyed having some time in a hotel in the middle of trip to Ireland. While it is likely to change in the future - the bar doubles as a dining room - and the food was excellent. The rooms were perfect, and the beds were very luxurious.  The staff were all very professional and went to exceptional lengths to make sure we were satisfied. They provided pointers to seeing the sites, and also helped us decide which Hop-On Hop-Off tour bus to use. We will definitely stay here when we go back to Dublin.",5,2016,07,27
240,Birthday treat,Family treated myself and my husband to a stay at the Hilton for my birthday. Overall experience was great. Disappointed with the breakfast buffet as we felt it lacked the personal touch. Staff friendly and helpful but service inconsistent in the bar area.,4,2016,07,26
240,Convenient Hotel With Friendly Staff,"This hotel is convenient to the Kilmainham Goal, a major attraction of Dublinand the history for Irish independence..  The hotel is located on the hop on hop off bus line with a bus stop directly across the street from the hotel.
The staff at the hotel are very friendly and accommodating.  You will not go wrong staying here.",5,2016,07,26
240,Truly lovely weeklong stay,"Located next to the historic Kilmainham jail, to which every Ireland visitor should make a pilgrimage (best done after just a bit of reading up on, or watching the PBS series on the 1916 revolution).  Also, very close to the Guinness factory, a fun filled pilgrimage of another sort. Easy, short, and cheap transportation to the heart of the city (especially with a LEAP pass, which they will happily tell you how to acquire at the hotel). The hotel staff was terrific, most especially the amazing Anna (I hope I am spelling your name correctly), rooms comfortable, updated and clean, and the Irish breakfast spot on, every single day!

We definitely look forward to a return!  Thanks so very much for your hospitality!",5,2016,07,25
240,Comfort and style,"This hotel is close to Kilmainham Goal and 2 beatiful parks. 2 different City Tour buses operate from close by and Heuston rail Station is nearby. The quality of this hotel is excellent, facilities are good and staff are helpful. I was with a conference group and facilities provided were excellent.  I have stayed here now on 3 separate occasions all of which have been good.  Thank you Hilton KIlmainham.",4,2016,07,25
240,"Bad service, no air, bad breakfast!","Our room was stifling hot when we arrived, and air did not work. The food in bar (we arrived too late for restaurant) was terrible, service was dismal in part because they were understaffed, this hotel is in a very secluded area with little to do--far from downtown and far from airport. Bathrooms were not very clean, and room was lackluster. 
When we tried to leave, the parking garage terminal was broken and we were trapped in parking garage for 30 minutes. No one ever came to assist us--finally tore down a plastic cone barrier to get out!!! Ugh...",1,2016,07,25
240,Lovely spot!,"Fabulous location - so close to everything we wanted to do.  Staff was so helpful and informative about local transportation options.  And best of all, the hotel had air conditioning, comfortable bed and a lovely bath.",5,2016,07,24
240,No complaints,"I‚Äôm fussy when it comes to hotels, but our one-night stay at the Hilton Dublin Kilmainham left me with nothing significant to complain about. The amenities are first rate, the service is impeccable, and our room (349) was the all-around best we had during our stay in Ireland. I‚Äôm sold on this hotel and would be happy to stay here again.",5,2016,07,24
240,Always a great place to sya,"If you are in Dublin on business then I would highly recommend this hotel. A little bit out of the centre but this get you great service, a great room and amazing views.  You can walk into the centre in 30 minutes or get a bus, take the LUAS or even a taxi.

Do not consider anywhere else",5,2016,07,23
240,Better than other hiltons!,"One of the most pleasant stays in Dublin. You won't be disappointed! Great rooms, kind and helpful staff and great facility. New hotel with many amenities and good area. I would suggest this hotel over others-esp the Dublin Hilton! ",5,2016,07,22
240,Quick stay,"The hotel was in a perfect location for our first nights stay, not too far from the train station we needed to following day.  Hotel was clean and the desk staff was excellent.  Proper recommendations for good ""Irish"" meal within a respectable walking distance.  The rooms were clean and the bedding made for a good nights rest for the entire family.",5,2016,07,21
240,Very good review,Both me and my partner were very happy with our stay! Everything was up to standard and the room made us feel special! The room allowed us to relax to the max and I would definitely return as soon as possible!,5,2016,07,20
240,"Comfortable Hotel, great service!","I stayed at this hotel on a recent business trip. Staff were friendly and room was very comfortable.  Restaurant food was generally very good (especially the lamb shank) and the bar staff were very friendly.  Hotel is not that centrally located, though an very easy walk to the train/tram station, or an easy straight walk to center town (~40 mins).  I would definitely stay again.",4,2016,07,19
240,Loved it!,"Beautiful property, super comfortable beds, spacious rooms, quiet nights, decent restaurant on premises and a fantastic health club and hydrotherapy pool. Highly recommend! Liked the location outside the very busy City Centre area, easily accessible by bus, Uber or cab.",5,2016,07,16
240,Please cook the vegetables,"I had a meal here on Saturday with a sizeable group of people and had a buffet lunch.  Meat, fish, potatoes, Yorkshire puds all delicious but the vegetables were virtually raw.  None of us could cut the cauliflower, brocolli or peas.  I know this great idea of Al Dente is raging throughout hotels and restaurants but please cook the vegetables.  All the plates went back with hacked up veg...does no-one note that everyone was unable to eat it. I was still hungry after the meal.",2,2016,07,12
240,Excellent Hotel,"Everything is good except the shower.  It is too narrow and the water temperature is difficult to set.  Otherwise, the hotel is in an excellent location and the staff is very helpful.  Dublin is a fun city for both music and nightlife.  I am happy to recommend it.",5,2016,07,10
240,Amazing hotel,"One of the best hotels that I have ever stayed.
Excellent service.
Comfortable beds
Clean rooms
Quite rooms
Excellent breakfast
The hotel has pool, hamam and sauna.
It is free for the guests.
Very good wifi internet connection.",5,2016,07,07
240,Solid Near the Airport Hotel,"Well designed rooms.  Large bed.  Decent gym, nice pool design and good sauna / steam (locker room could be cleaner).  Surprisingly good food.  Better than expected.  Trip advisor says i need more characters.  OK. the Fish and Chips were average.",3,2016,07,06
240,Great hotel in a quieter part of Dublin,"Clean, modern hotel well sited for visits to Phoenix Park, Guiness Storehouse and Kilmainham - all are within walking distance in fact Kilmainham Jail is across the road.  Nice rooms, good food and friendly staff.",4,2016,07,05
240,Clean and well appointed but staff less than friendly,"The check in and check out process were easy enough and the staff at the front desk was very helpful.  I wouldn't recommend the hotel's restaurant - the service was slow and though our waitresses were lovely (we gave them a try twice), some of the staff was far less than friendly. The room was clean and quiet and for that reason, I might consider staying at this Hilton again.",4,2016,07,01
240,Hilton Kilmainham Dublin,"Staff was excellent.  Kind, Courteous, helpful and a joy to talk with, also a smile on their face.  The manager took time to sit with us and walk us through the map of Dublin and how to get around town.  Entire staff did a great job!",5,2016,07,01
240,Perfect location to everything!,"Great staff, easy to access sites, and on a corner with a pub, a prison, and a museum!
Breakfast buffet had many options.  Double decker hop and go bus stops right outside.
Liked the low key bar in evening.",5,2016,06,30
240,Great place to stay for overnight with kids,"We stayed here for one night in April before taking a morning flight. Ideally placed to get to airport the next morning but also easy to get into the centre of town. We had changed our plans last minute to overnight in Dublin, arrived midday on Sunday, but found the desk staff really helpful. We got the tour bus from right opposite the hotel, really cheap for the three of us. Got off in the centre of Dublin, wandered, then hopped back on the bus back to the hotel. Great way to see Dublin particularly if short on time. We just got a taste of the city but it made us want to  revisit. So much to see and do.  We got the last tourist bus back at about 7pm (on a Sunday). that was fine for us but if you wanted to stay where the action is this hotel may be a bit out. I'm sure there are plenty of other buses/ taxis.
The pool in the hotel is lovely, not huge but good for a soak and our daughter enjoyed. We used HHonour points so it was great value for us.",5,2016,06,30
240,Lovely location away from city center.,"A bit of a distance from the city center but the bus stop is at the front door. The Royal Hospital (now the Museum of Modern Art), the Kilmainham Gaol, and a delightful pub are across the street. The desk staff was very sympathetic to our exhaustion after an overnight flight and worked diligently to accommodate my request for early check in. ",5,2016,06,28
240,Meets Hilton standards,"This is a typical Hilton, there is the Museum of Ireland and a pub right across the street and one of the oldest prisons to take tours of (equal to Alcatraz). It is clean and up to date with air conditioning. I did not eat here so I cannot review the food but overall impression is that this is a popular stay.",5,2016,06,27
240,One night stop for Sigur Ros gig.,"Straight across road from venue so ideal . Shana on reception lovely and very helpful .Rooms quiet and well maintained ,functional.
One flaw the bar staff were unpleasant and it was a tense experience even ordering a drink .Another gentleman agreed it felt as though we were waiting outside the Principal's office when ordering a drink.Im guessing their is low morale amongs bar staff for some reason.
All other facilities were fine .Kilmainham Gaol well worth a visit ,best to book your tickets online before ,though we were there early and didn't have to wait and see if room on next tour .",4,2016,06,27
240,Highly Recommended!,"My husband & I recently stayed in the Hilton for a special birthday.  We got an excellent deal on the price by prepaying with HHonours.  The hotel was beautiful & spotlessly clean.  The room was spacious, very comfortable - amazing bed - and very clean.  The temperature of the room was the best I've experienced yet.  My husband was presented with chocolates & a card for his birthday, which was a lovely touch.  Breakfast was delicious.  If I had to have a gripe, it would just be that the staff at reception could be a bit warmer.  We were checked in by somebody who rhymed off the check in instructions and most of them were incomprehensible.  We were checked out by a trainee who practically dismissed us.  It wasn't very impressive for a service business, but overall, this didn't spoil our stay at all.  The young man in the bar on the night we stayed was very nice.",5,2016,06,27
240,Hilton..never again,"I've booked 2 rooms for 4 days in dublin. Staff don't have a clue what they're doing.. Rooms clean but updates needed badly. Next time I prefer to pay an extra 50-100‚Ç¨ but be satisfied eg. Marker, Spencer",2,2016,06,27
240,Wishtrip,"The hotel was amazing...beautiful views from balcony!Rooms were spacious and lovely,and the breakfast was great.The staff were courteous,and the manager quite helpful.Our teens loved the pool, and had a great time visiting the jail across the street, as well as nearby gardens.",4,2016,06,26
240,Perfect for short break to Dublin,"We've just returned from a 3 night stay at this hotel and we were very pleased with it.  The staff were all very friendly and nothing was too much bother for them. The hotel was clean, we had a huge room and the breakfast was of a good standard with loads of options.
The hotel is a little way from the centre of town so we used taxis quite a lot, but they were reasonably priced, so this wasn't an issue for us.
The Gaol/museum is right on the doorstep and so is the stop for the hop on/hop off bus tour which was really good.
I would definitely recommend this hotel for a short stay and would use again.",4,2016,06,26
240,Dublin Stay on Business,"Enjoyed the usual high standards of a Hilton hotel, with the added enjoyment of an extremely courteous, generous and helpful staff!  I will definitely stay here again and would recommend it to all!  As well, the central location was excellent!",4,2016,06,24
240,"High quality hotel, helpful staff","Our experience with this hotel was very positive. We had three rooms for our group, and all of us were pleased with the size of the bedrooms, the bathrooms, and the nice decor. We each had lovely views overlooking the Museum of Modern Art and the Kilmainham Jail. The staff prepared us a takeaway breakfast for our day trip to Northern Ireland, which was much appreciated. We had breakfast in the dining room on the second morning, and were surprised and delighted that they had a honeycomb as part of the breakfast fare. Good breakfast selection overall. The location of the hotel is good if you're touring that section of town but it is not in walking distance of the city centre.",5,2016,06,23
240,Hilton quality,I was here on a business trip.  The location is near the famous prison (now museum) but not really walking distance to the downtown area (shops/bars).  The tour buses do stop at the prison and taxis are not expensive.  The rooms were clean and comfortable.  The breakfast had a lot of variety.  Hotel staff were friendly and helpful.,5,2016,06,21
240,clean hotel,"The hotel is clean.  Nice and quiet area.  Rooms are clean, no smell.  The water tap needs repair.  Only hot water coming out, no cold water.  Needs some repair work, but afterall, it is a nice hotel.  Breakfast only average.",4,2016,06,19
240,Convenient for tourists,Front desk staff very friendly and helpful. Room is ok. No minibar. Bed is a liitle firm for my taste. Located near 2 highly rated tourist attractions. The Gaol is directly across the street so you can easily pick up a sightseeing bus. Eating options nearby are limited but Union8 was tasty. 40 euro taxi ride to airport.,3,2016,06,18
240,Average and Cleaness Worry,"Hi,  I stayed here for multiple times as part of my work trip but was extremely disappointed by the poor levels and standards around the entire hotel. As a diamond member I was given an awful room for the course of my stays and the rooms have carpets which were stained and smelt poorly. (This is a health hazard in my view)  Also the I made us of the gym, sauna and steam facilities but did not make the same mistake of using them ever again as the floor, showers and general walkways were very filthy and not maintained. This despite the hotel informing me that they had undergone a recent refurbishment of the  pool/sauna and steam area.  They have 2 computer stations one PC is always broken and printer had issues as well.  I would avoid booking this hotel as the level of service even to diamond guests was very poor. Also there are hardly any food places nearby the hotel so you have to eat at the hotel which I would not recommend",2,2016,06,18
240,air conditioner,The cooling system in this room did not work. The staff was unable to fix it and unable to move us to another room. The weather was warm and without a cooling system the room was hot and stuffy. We did not sleep.,2,2016,06,18
240,Comfortable hotel in a quiet part of town,"This was a short business trip and the hotel suited me well. WiFi was very good, the shower was powerful and the room was very comfortable. Bar prices are a bit pricey, but no more than most other hotels. The main restaurant was closed whilst I was there for some reason but the bar menu sufficed.",4,2016,06,15
240,Pleasant Bar but Staff need to move themselves,Had a bar lunch here in very pleasant surroundings.  What a pity the staff are so unprofessional.  Lots of them standing around like statues.  They never give a glance around the bar to see if a customer is trying to get their attention.  We had to go to the bar counter on two occasions for our drinks.  Food was good.,3,2016,06,14
240,"Excellent Hotel, Poor Customer Service","The Good:
- Excellent room, comfy bed & pillows, immaculate
- Quiet location away from the noise of the centre but close enough to travel in
- Excellent choice/quality of the breakfast.

The Bad:
- 2 plug sockets didn't work in the room
- No biscuits in the room
- No acknowledgement of my finances birthday
- Request not met for a higher floor room
- 1st morning at breakfast the gentleman greeting us was rude, He accused us of not having booked breakfast when this was pre paid. He didn't show us to a table & we were not offered tea or coffee. When I asked for a pot of tea I still never got any! The gentleman never came back over to assure us everything was ok & did not apologise.
- Had to wait over 10 minutes to get milk
- After breakfast I went back up to the room and made my own cup of tea & called down to the hotel reception to check we would not have the same problem the next day. The next morning the service was excellent, shown to our table, offered tea or coffee, asked if we would like anything made to order by the chef, and the experience was excellent.
- On arrival at the hotel we were told the spa was shut due to maintenance. I booked this hotel due to the facilities & good reviews, as this was also for an occasion I was not impressed. The least the hotel could do is offer a complimentary drink at the bar, & email guests before arrival advising it is out of order.
- Staff generally quite rude, poor customer service (with the exception of Emma on reception who was fantastic & is a credit to the hotel, she was very helpful, friendly and welcoming on every occasion).
On the whole, excellent hotel, the service lets it down. I would still return to the hotel in the future despite the bad, I hope this feedback is taken on board and fed back because the hotel is a gem. Not what you expect from a Hilton hotel - the customer services should be world class & facilities in working order - when you pay a top price  you expect better!",3,2016,06,13
240,"Fantastic service, great location","We stayed at the Hilton Kilmainham the weekend of Forbidden Fruit festival and had an absolutely wonderful stay. Everything from the staff to the hotel and surrounding area itself was perfect. The hotel is directly across the road from Kilmainham Gaol - one of Dublins most popular tourist attractions, the Modern Art museum and just down the road from the Royal Hospital Kilmainham grounds where Forbiddem Fruit festival was held. One staff member in particular was absolutely fantastic at facilitating us throughout our stay and I wish I got her name so she could be properly credited for her fantastic provision of customer service!! She had brown hair and a fringe and was working both Saturday and Sunday... She's an absolute credit to your hotel! So welcoming and friendly, she started our trip off with a good start and ended it likewise. We would most definitely return again.",5,2016,06,12
240,Pretty in the City ,"One of my favourite Hilton hotels! The receptionist started our stay off to a great start by being so helpful and kind with some complimentary goodies and just a genuine helpful manner. Hotel is 10 minutes in a taxi to the city centre with a car parking facility too. Room was gorgeous and bright and spacious. Bed was super comfy!! We booked it last minute and had a lovely view at the front of the hotel. Breakfast had a huge selection for everyone's needs. Coffee machine ran out of coffee (DISASTER) but staff were straight away out within seconds with more and happy to help. Cannot fault the hotel in any way, fabulous as per usual ! ",5,2016,06,12
240,One night stay,"Would recommend this hotel. This was my first time to stay in this hotel.  The staff were very friendly, efficient and helpful.  The room was bright, clean and tidy with complimentary tea/coffee and wifi.  I didn't get to use the poo//spa on this occasion but will return and hope to avail during next stay",5,2016,06,10
240,Lovely hotel with amazing staff,"Loved staying here! Breakfast was amazing with lots of variety. Staff were extremely nice, especially emma on reception who couldn't do enough for us! Room with balcony was really nice! Pool facilities were beautiful! Really loved the whole experience.",5,2016,06,09
240,In Dublin on business,Great place to stay for business travel. The staff was very helpful and friendly. Rooms were quiet and wi-fi worked well. Fitness center had a nice selection of cardio equipment and weights. Room services was very good. Great location for getting in a walk about the city too!,5,2016,06,09
240,Excellent in all Respects!,"Clean, modern, comfortable, great restaurant, and excellent staff. And the breakfast is great!  The hotel is not d'town but the LOUS (LRT) is an 8 min walk away and from there d'town is a 15 min ride.  Or for other travels, you can get off at the Heuston Station (a 5 min ride) - it's a central train station. You can also catch the 747 express bus from there to the Airport (that's the cheapest way, and it's fast!).  Special thanks to Ana Haidau, Reception Manager, for her efforts and kind hospitality in shipping to my home an item I had left behind in the Hotel's restaurant!",5,2016,06,08
240,Excellent quality and comfort across from Kilmainham Gaol,"Recently stayed here to start a vacation in Ireland, and it was a great experience! The price was fair for the time of year, and the staff were helpful and friendly. Clean and well-designed hotel with high quality rooms and amenities.   Only 2 (very minor) nitpicks about the hotel. First, the room was warm the entire time we were there. The air conditioning seemed to work intermittently, but Dublin was in a heat wave, so this is understandable and just a minor concern for me (I like the cold).   Second, for those unaware of how Dublin is laid out, note that the hotel is NOT near downtown Dublin. If you don't have a car, or don't want to rely on cabs, it can be a challenge to get downtown. The hotel's website claims that it's an easy walk downtown but I didn't find that to be the case -- it's just too far, especially if the weather is unusually warm or rainy.   Huge bonus that the Kilmainham Gaol is across the street, and the modern art museum is within walking distance. Access to rail (Heuston Station) is a bit of a wak, but manageable especially without luggage. Just a short cab or bus ride away.   If you take a hop-on hop-off tour bus that stops at the Gaol, then this location can be a great base of operations for starting/ending a day touring! If you don't want to be in the middle of the city, this is a very elegant and relaxing option for a stay in Dublin!",5,2016,06,08
240,Great Customer Service,"Went on girls trip for birthday to Ireland. Love... Love the Hilton. Anna gave us exceptional service. Breakfast was great. We had buffet but gave kids pancakes & French toast to order. Little out of way for sites,but highly recommend. There are several hop on & hop off bus stops across street from hotel. ",5,2016,06,07
240,A good hotel,"I really expected more. A minibar, a better option for food (room service), more variety on the breakfast and more courteous service, specially when we arrived. 
The Internet was good, the room had a good size. The bed was comfortable, but the pillows don't. The air conditioner was turned off at midnight, this made the room hot and was difficult to sleep.",4,2016,06,06
240,Nice place to stay. Close to Center Square,We really enjoyed our stay. It was nice to be able to walk to dinner and to Guinness Tour then we road a horse and carriage back to the hotel. We spent our first night in Ireland here and glad we did.,4,2016,06,06
240,"Beautiful property, great service","We stayed here for the first night of our honeymoon. Checked in early morning, had to wait about an hour for our room to be prepared. For checking in at 8 AM without warning, I am pretty pleased with that. Told them it was our honeymoon, they upgraded us to a top-floor suite and gave us free wine and chocolate! (I am also a Diamond Hilton member so that may have affected it). We had free breakfast because of Diamond status and it was delicious, a great selection. The hotel is beautiful, great view from the to floor, cool that it's near Kilmainham Gaol. The hotel is not close to the city though, so you have to take a taxi or bus into town. So if you want somewhere quiet, this is a good location. If you want to be in the thick of the action, this isn't the best location. Other than location though, this place was wonderful. $12 parking I think. They sold me a US-Irish power adapter for $5.",5,2016,06,03
240,Business Trip,"As expected for Hilton's high standards. Stayed on business so due to time /meetings I didn't use the Pool of facilities.

The room was clean, comfortable for a night.

You will need to get a taxi for the restaurants etc.

Breakfast was lovely a good selection, from continental, cooked and cereals with lots of lovely looking pastries. 

Would stay and use the facilities when next in Dublin.",4,2016,06,03
240,Girls weekend ,"Myself & 2 friends stayed here for a girlie weekend. Checked in online on the Hilton Honours App & selected our room from a choice of several. Room was large, spacious & clean. Bathroom was large with a bath & a separate shower cubicle. Hairdryer, iron & ironing board in the room along with tea & coffee facilities & toiletries included. Fantastic view out of the floor to ceiling window, comfortable bed & plenty of pillows. Breakfast was plentiful & of a very good standard & the food in the restaurant was tasty & a good price. Between ‚Ç¨9-12 each way in a taxi to Temple Bar area. Would definitely stay here again in the future. ",5,2016,06,02
240,Mini break,"Booked this hotel as it had a pool. Really looking forward to it as our 12 year old loves swimming. On arrival we was told the pool was closed to maintenance. We was offered complementary breakfast as we was room only and a taxi to a local complex if we wanted to swim. 
The room we had lovely. Really comfy beds. Bathroom was spacious. The rooms are lovely and clean. The breakfast was plentiful lots too choose from and really tasty. The bar snacks were nice. Lots to choose from. Little over priced but to be expected. Drinks were pricey too but on a par with in Dublin itself. 
Only downside was where the hotel is situated its out of town and nothing much near by to eat or drink but transport is on the doorstep into Dublin town centre. 
We would definitely stay in this hotel again   ",5,2016,06,02
240,Memorable,"Lovely hotel, lovely location and a good location if you want to get into centre of town or other attractions, very friendly and welcoming staff.  Bus service near by. Breakfast could be hotter but there was a great choice of everything so this was a pity really that it wasn't warmer. Would return again but maybe if I got a better rate as it was a bit expensive for one night only bed and breakfast.",5,2016,06,02
240,"Nice hotel, nice location","This hotel is among the nicest that I've stayed at in Dublin. It was a far better value than other central locations. The room was spacious and comfortable, and near Kilmainham Gaol and the art museum. Easy to get into city center too.",4,2016,06,02
240,Excellent hotel,Stayed for a long weekend. The hotel was excellent. Huge bedroom & balcony. Cleaned daily to a very high standard. A wide range of breakfast items. All staff helpful & polite. 10 min walk to tram which will take you into the city centre in 15 mins. Small but adequate gym. Can't comment on spa & pool as they were out of action due to repairs ,5,2016,06,02
240,"Poor communication from the hotel, check the facilities availability prior to book","We booked this hotel to use the spa facilities but when we went to the hotel the facilities not available but hotel did not inform us prior to arrive. The notice was displayed on the booking screen with the date facilities available after renovation and I have then plan to arrive a few days after that day, unfortunately the hotel changed the notice to another day just a day before I travel from London.
Totally disappointed.

This may be an one off incident otherwise I love Hilton standard.

240,Be careful of this one,"I was very disappointed with this experience. Had made arrangements on May 28- May 30th online through the Hilton website to stay at this hotel. I have always loved staying at Hilton because you know the quality you are going to get at this type of hotel establishment. I had literally booked this hotel for a wedding to be close to the wedding party since their hotel (non hilton) was sold out. Having made my reservation a long time ago, I thought it would be ready on my arrival on the May 28th. I had not had the time to shower from leaving from my previous hotel. I decided to just pack up all my stuff and head over to the hotel to shower and change to sight see. When I got there, I didn't get a welcome like I was expecting one would get in America. It felt like the customer service agents at this hotel were there to make money not to provide that excellence in service that I am use to when I stay at a HIlton. I would describe their attitudes as cold and unwelcoming. If I had the chance I would have chosen to stay at the Ashling Hotel longer and for much cheaper for this wedding weekend. I was greeted and they took the time to get to know me and everything. They also thanked me for traveling so far and choosing to stay at that hotel.  Getting back to the story, when I checked in my room was not ready which I found very ridcioulous. As a guest, one expects to show up and have the room ready. I was told that it would take 15 mins for my room to be ready and to check in with the counter at that time being 12:15pm. I proceeded to come back to the desk only to be told that it would be another 30 minutes. At this point, I was highly considering cancelling this hotel reservation and disputing this transaction for the stay (still considering that as an option). I was not pleased and the agents, kept checking other guests in which really pissed me off with no form of an apology whatsoever. I proceeded to come back to the check in counter at 12:45pm to once again be told that it was going to take another 15 mins or so for my room to be clean. Possibly another 20-25 mins. This was cutting into my experience as a world traveler to go see and tour Dublin and Ireland. I had plan to get lunch with friends and literally missed the experience because I was waiting for a room that should have been ready way before I arrived at your hotel. I have no doubt that I missed many opportunities to explore more of Ireland and check out the sights around the hotel. Literally wasted almost an 2 hours before checking in. This was definitely one of the lowest points for me staying at a Hilton Hotel, this would have never happened in a US establishment. For someone that had paid a price to come tour Ireland for a few days I could have done a Hostel for nearly a 1/10 of the cost and probably a better experience. If I am ever to return to a Hilton in Ireland, it will certainly not be this one, from the customer service to having the ability to check in, to needing to clean up and wanting to explore the country a little more, the service was terrible. I felt like a mere peasant waiting to check in as I saw everyone else getting a room and no concern for my reservation. It was also very embarrassing that my friends I had told that I be ready met me on time at the hotel and I literally told them to go on without me due to not being able to check into my room. Not only did I loose out on time, but I lost out on the experience to explore more of Dublin and Ireland itself. For me, that is priceless and you can never get back lost time. What I should have done is cancelled that stay and disputed it after with my credit card company (which I will do next). This stay felt like a circus and I was not pleased.",3,2016,06,01
240,Excellent Hilton Experience,"The hotel is wonderful, clean and all that you would expect from a Hilton. We like its location- walking distance to the train station. It was also right at a stop for the hop-on hop-off bus. We were able to get a tour of the city, see some sigths and then end up at the hotel. One draw back is the lack of eating places nearby. we had a nice dinner at the bar, but there were not any other options.",5,2016,05,31
240,Excellent hotel with a very warm welcome,"This hotel is bright, clean, well-located and has a very well trained staff. Emma, the receptionist is probably the most welcoming and efficient receptionist I have seen in a long time. Nothing was too much trouble for her and she knew exactly what advice we needed, even before we asked her.",5,2016,05,31
240,Great Location,"Excellent location.  Near Guiness, Jamesons, Croke Park and right across the street from the Kilmainham prison.  Trains and buses nearby. Parking in and out privileges.  Nice fitness center, pool and sauna. ",5,2016,05,30
240,Above and Beyond Service!,"From the moment I attempted an extremely early check-in (10:30 AM), to the moment I checked out, I felt welcomed and part of the Hilton family. I travel weekly for work in the US and have experienced many different Hilton properties. The staff at the Hilton Dublin Kilmainham were wonderful! Stacey not only ensured our bags made it to our room much earlier than expected, she also spent close to ten minutes recommending activities, dining locations, and transportation options. Her colleagues at the front, Renata and Ana, carried on where Stacey left off. I have told many friends and colleagues that this Hilton property is top notch-not just as a Hilton, but as a hotel in general. I recommend this location without hesitation and with sincerity.",5,2016,05,30
240,Best to Avoid,"I stayed here for a few days on vacation from the U.S. When I arrived, the staff was very friendly. It was only when I came back for the night I started to realize the problems with the hotel.

I hear Police/Ambulance sirens about 10-15 times a day, including into the night, and that's only spending about 2 hours here a day, plus sleeping. This woke me up several times each night. Not the hotels' fault directly, but a fault in location.

The bathroom gets large pools of water/borderline floods every time you take a shower. This is because there is no curtain or divider for the shower, just a pivoting piece of glass(that itself leaks at the base) that only covers about 1/3 of the shower. Even standing as close to the shower head as possible, my floor gets soaked every time.

I tried ordering room service a little late in the night, but before Midnight, as the menu says they provide this service 24/7. When we called, they told as they didn't have multiple items prepared, so we couldn't order them, despite all of the items being marked as being available to order 24 hours a day.",2,2016,05,28
240,Nice but far away from old town,"Nice hotel. Too far to walk from main attraction area. Hotel does not provide transportation but there are buses that stop across the street. Also, not many places to eat nearby. The two we attempted to get into were fully booked. Ended up getting food at the petrol station around the corner.",3,2016,05,27
240,"Quiet, but a wee bit noisy too","This is away from the hustle and bustle of O'Connell Street, but the street outside can be a bit noisy.  We paid for a room upgrade to one with a balcony - it was nice to take the air while enjoying a cocktail or morning tea.  This hotel is located right on the famous hop on-hop off tour bus routes, so getting ""downtown"" isn't difficult.

The room and the bed was very comfortable.  The shower had a lovely rainhead shower head that was a wonderful treat at the end of the day.  

The onsite restaurant served a wonderful breakfast buffet (which was included in lieu of more Hilton Honors points), so it was a great way to start the day.

The staff was warm and welcoming.  We enjoyed out stay, and would not hesitate to stay here again.",5,2016,05,26
240,Not Impressed,"During check-in, the computer system went down the staff was apathetic at best. The wifi through the hotel was inconsistent and weak. For a business traveler, it was impossible to try be productive. I would not recommend this hotel to any business traveler who has a need to stay in Dublin.",2,2016,05,26
240,Dublin visit May,"Wonderful hotel let down by restaurant staff. The restaurant was not busy, a manager was conducting a meeting with the staff in view of the customers and the staff were not available to serve the customers. Individual guests had to eat in the reception area bar.",3,2016,05,26
240,Simply the best,The best of everything here. From breakfast to bed you can't fault this hotel. We love staying here. It is close to the city and the hop on hop off sightseeing bus stops outside the hotel. Would recommend it  ,5,2016,05,25
240,it's what you'd expect from a Hilton,"This property is located outside of Dublin's historic downtown, but a nearby bus line (#13 or #40) takes you there in about 10 minutes. Also, the three hop-on hop-off tourist bus lines that circle around the city all make a stop in front of the hotel.

And the nice thing about the location is that the Kilmainham Gaol is right across the street, and the Dublin train station is just 10 minutes walk away.

The hotel itself is fairly new and modern. It's got a nice restaurant, business facilities, and a gym. The free wifi signal was strong, and that's truly a plus.

Our room was large, clean, quiet and comfortable. It came with all the conveniences you'd need and expect. And yes, the price was what you'd expect at a Hilton, but not prohibitively too high.

No complaints at all, and I'd easily stay again.",4,2016,05,24
240,Luxury in Dublin,Travelled here on business and was upgraded to a gorgeous room overlooking the old gaol. Quite a way from the centre but worth it for a taxi ride. On site parking for a reasonable charge. Super Irish breakfat,5,2016,05,24
240,Great location! Comfortable bed!,Stayed here for a quick weekend break and found it on the Hilton Honors website. Location was perfect so we could walk to temple bar and see the surrounding city.  Hotel team were welcoming and very helpful!  The warm cookies at check in are heavenly!,5,2016,05,24
240,Excellent Hotel in Dublin,Despite some issues on the first night which were rectified we enjoyed a very nice break at this hotel. It was very convenient in its location opposite Kilmainham Gaol for access to the Hop-on/Hop-off Tourist buses. This allowed great flexibility in getting into the centre of Dublin and also to various attractions. Weel recommended location,4,2016,05,23
240,Good location for Irish travellers,"Stayed here for one night.  
Went to the bar for a quick sandwich and a pot of tea when I arrived (Friday at 4.30ish) and was back in my room within 30 minutes having enjoyed same.
The staff are friendly - one of the bar staff made me a sandwich late in the evening when I returned to the hotel.
Room was spacious and clean with an extra large tv.  Bathroom had a bath and a separate shower.
Great location if you're coming from the South or West of the country as the hotel is easy to get to",4,2016,05,23
240,Clean comfortable,"Clean comfortable hotel and 10 mins from Heuston station by taxi. 

Room was a decent size which was good to work from. Staff were friendly on check unnamed check out. I Didn't try the gym as the pool was being refurbished. 

Handy for kilmainham jail which is a tourist attraction. ",4,2016,05,22
240,Typical 4 star hotel,"We had an overnight stay here after a trip around Ireland. Room was large and clean, the beds were very comfortable. The bathroom was well equipped and spacious. I would recommend you eat elsewhere as the food in the bar was not above average, however the service was good.

It's a great place to stay if one is just looking for somewhere to stop over in Dublin.",4,2016,05,21
240,First time visit to Dublin,This hotel is in an excellent location. Convenient to public (and affordable) transportation. The staff was excellent all the way from the front desk to the housekeeping personnel. The restaurant and bar staff were also very attentive and helpful when needed.,5,2016,05,20
240,Great experience,First trip to Ireland. Stayed at this hotel as it was close to several attractions we wanted to see.  Hotel staff was extremely helpful with any of our needs especially directions. Room was very spacious and clean.  Breakfast food was very good.  A great experience.  Traveled with another couple and they also commented on how nice everything was at this hotel.  I'd definitely stay again if I get back there.,5,2016,05,19
240,Excellent,"Had a fab time. Defo recommend this lovely hotel. Its central to all main attractions and the staff made our stay very special. As it was our 1st wedding anniversary and expecting a baby we were greeted with a warm welcome, a room upgrade, free drink at the bar and a box of chocolates and congratulations card sent to the room. Was very impressed and thankful. Will defo be back",5,2016,05,19
240,Nice hotel,"This is a nice Hilton in Dublin, right off the hop-on/hop-off bus route. It's close to many attractions and restaurants, and the hotel staff are kind and helpful whenever necessary. We would highly recommend staying here while in Dublin, and I would stay here again myself. ",4,2016,05,18
240,Short trip to Dublin,"This was a fantastic hotel breakfast was excellent the room was brilliant the staff you couldn't have asked for better one in particular is Elisa very helpful , happy in her job and just a awesome person!! 

I will be returning to stay at this hotel again I recommend it .",5,2016,05,18
240,Rather disappointing,"I don't expect to have to pay a daily upgrade in order to use a hotel bathrobe when I book a kingsize double bed and room with especially good view in a four-star hotel with indoor swimming pool; this Hilton does required it. Sorry, won't be returning here.",3,2016,05,18
240,"Great staff, comfortable room.  Hard to find, though.","I'd gotten directions from the airport, and got off the airport shuttle bus at the appropriate train station.  The walk from there was a bit confusing, though.  Fortunately, we asked someone who kindly directed us to go straight through the park at the Irish Museum of Modern Art, and we easily found the hotel after that.  This is a pretty typical Hilton -- the room was clean, comfortable, and fairly spacious, with glorious pillows.  The included breakfast is quite expansive and well prepared, if a little short on fruit and vegetable options.  The front desk staff is very friendly, helpful, and enthusiastic.  To get to downtown Dublin, it's a 3-minute walk to the bus, and a 10-minute bus ride (about a 25 minute walk), so it's out of the hustle and bustle of downtown, and nice and quiet, but still convenient -- and significantly less expensive than hotels in the middle of downtown.  If you're renting a car after visiting Dublin, use Avis -- it's a 2-minute walk from the hotel to a small Avis office on Kilmainham Road.",4,2016,05,17
240,Great Sightseeing Stop,"We had a quick overnight at this hotel while on a visit to Ireland. Although a bit out of the city center, it is very conveniently located to many tourist spots, and it is extremely easy to access the city transportation (buses, light rail) to travel to other tourist spots. It's a lovely hotel with nice amenities, and we enjoyed our stay very much. The rooms are much larger than most European hotels in big cities.",5,2016,05,17
240,Great stay,"Perfect location, friendly staff, lovely room, great nights sleep and delicious breakfast in the morning. Would definitely recommend the French toast. Very accommodating to families with small children. ",5,2016,05,17
240,Lovely hotel in Dublin,"This is a great place to stay! Away from the crowds yet close enough to access all Dublin has to offer. Just steps away from Kilmainham Gaol which I highly recommend visiting. Clean rooms, friendly service, nice bar and restaurant- definitely made our time in Dublin enjoyable.",5,2016,05,17
240,"Hilton Kilmainham, nothing out of the ordinary","I recently stayed here for 2 nights as a small get away with my girlfriend. The hotel was very clean, check in was a little rushed, but the receptionist was still very polite. Of the time we spent in the hotel mostly we visited the bar/restaurant, we could tell immediately that some of the staff were lacking in experience, and one waiter was walking around as if he had been insulted some how (did not make the prospect of interacting with him a pleasant one). Aside from that, F+B manager Hugo (?) was extremely nice, and has a solid work ethic, rolling up his sleeves to help out the inexperienced barman who was struggling to serve a bar of 5 people. Shauna (?) was another extremely polite professional and pleasant young lady.  Food was tasty, and not too expensive, the drinks were a little pricey but we were happy to pay. 

Overall nothing strange to report nothing unusual, just a nice hotel, with nice comfortable beds, and its very clean.",4,2016,05,16
240,Good solid choice for Dublin visit,"The location near the jail (which was a great place to tour) and a couple of surprisingly wonderful restaurants and pubs worked out great for our last night in Dublin. The room was clean, and well appointed and the beds and bathroom were good. The breakfast left something to be desired, and the fact that we had no hot water for the morning was a problem. Moreover, when we came down to the front desk to check out they didn't mention the lack of hot water and waited to see if we would complain. When we did bring it up, they offered a free breakfast and told us that the entire hotel was without hot water that morning. It was bad enough that there was no hot shower, but worse yet, that the front desk was going to just try to get by without offering any sort of apology or alternatives until we mentioned the problem.",2,2016,05,14
240,"Excellent hotel, good location","Very accommodating staff, good bar food, near WW1 War Memorial Gardens, and the lovely gardens of the Old Kilmainham hospital, now also the location of the Irish Modern Art Museum. Easy 15 minute walk to a few great historic pubs on Parkgate Street.",5,2016,05,14
240,Fantastic hotel,"We stayed in one of the very modern rooms 412 it was extremely clean and looked like new. This was a big room with lovely outdoor terrace and seating area looking over Phoneix park / the goal.
This hotel had great facilities lovely spa and gym food in restaurant was good, I can vouch for the steak! ",5,2016,05,12
240,Excellent stay,Stayed for 2 nights & enjoyed the experience. This was our first time in a hilton hotel & we weren't disappointed.  The room was clean & comfortable &breakfast offered everything you could ever wish for. The only downside was it was a good half an hour walk from the city but the hop on hop off buses all stop outside the hotel!,5,2016,05,10
240,A Happy Return,We have used this hotel before and as we would expect of the Hilton chain it delivers the best service for a good price. We ate breakfast lunch and dinner all were of a high standard. We picked this hotel because of its easy walk down to the train station for our onward journey to Galway.,5,2016,05,10
240,Leisure trip to Dublin,"Booked via Superbreak. B&B stay for 3 nights. Hotel is situated a little on the outskirts, close to Heuston Station, Dublin Zoo, Modern Art Museum and Kilmairnham Gaol. Room was modern, clean and comfortable. Bar was a little expensive. Excellent breakfast. We didn't eat dinner in the hotel but 2 courses was 19.50 Euros which was competitive and if breakfast was anything to go by it would have been a very good standard. Nice restaurant 5 minutes walk - Union 8. Upmarket but standard of food was excellent. We'd definitely stay at this hotel again and would recommend it.",5,2016,05,09
240,Close to Kilmainham...would stay here again,"I'm an HHonors member, and I try to stay at Hilton properties when the price is reasonable, or the hotel is conveniently located.  In this case, I wanted to be near Kilmainham Gaol, having a relative who died in the Rising, and was being commemorated.  This hotel was satisfactory.  We were able to access public transport, as well as city sightseeing buses, and leave the driving to someone else for a change!  We found the bar service (dinner options available til around 9 pm) quite good, whereas breakfast service was sloppy.  (Long wait to get our coffee, etc. -- although the food offerings were good, and not just the ""full Irish breakfast"" you find in so many places).  Our room was quite satisfactory for the price -- good firm king-sized bed.  Just as we like it.  We kept hearing a thudding sound in our room (fire doors banging?  people using free weights in the fitness room and dropping them?  something with the elevators?) which was quite irritating.  Front desk staff couldn't tell us what it was.  Thank goodness, it was quiet during sleep hours, but during the early evening, it was more than a little irritating.  This was really the only problem we had with our stay.  I would stay at this hotel again.",4,2016,05,09
240,10.50 for a glass of wine!,"I visited this hotel today and I was horrified when the bill arrived with a 10.50 euro charge on a glass of rose! Firstly we were told that the glasses we ordered were large ones, when no member of staff advised us that there was an option of small / medium /large glasses. Secondly, had a staff member advised us that this was the price of one glass., we would of definitely ordered a bottle instead.

I found the customer service very poor over all and as a Dubliner I
Am mortified that our tourists are visiting Dublin and being charged these prices - is it just because the hotel is located opposite kilmainham jail now and management have decided to increase the price of everything. It's disgraceful and I will not return here again. ",2,2016,05,08
240,Modern property a little away from downtown Dublin,"This is a very modern property.  It is located away from the downtown crowd. However, downtown can be accessed by public transportation.  There are some tourist attractions just across the street.  The property has a contemporary look with modern decor and furnishings.  We stayed for one night as part of a group.  The rooms are spacious and airy with floor to ceiling glass windows with good views and look clean.  Our room had a very comfortable king bed, 40 inch flat TV with a number free channels including CNN, a mini fridge (no merchandise), hair dryer and a mini safe.  The room has air conditioning and temperature control. Our stay included free wi-fi.  The staff were friendly and helpful.  The hotel has a small swimming pool and a gym as well.  The buffet breakfast has a good variety.  Overall a very good place to stay in Dublin.",5,2016,05,07
240,A great venue to stay at for Al and Sue.,"My wife and I took a short break to Dublin and stayed at the Dublin Hilton which is right opposite Kilmainham Jail, a must see attraction and on the route of tourist buses.
The rooms are of a very good standard. Good backup from the staff.
The reception staff were exellent.
My wife and I had two evening meals there. On one occasion I had the fish and chips which was one of the best I have ever tasted whilst my wife the steak which she really enjoyed. The service in the breakfast room was first class in the morning with exellent service from all the staff, especially Elisa, one of the waitresses who was absolutely superb. I would definately recommend this hotel as a place to stay. So relaxing and I would definately go back.",5,2016,05,07
240,"Great hotel, great service, great location!","Stayed in this hotel together with my fiance in April. It was our first visit to Dublin. We could not have chosen a better hotel. Great rooms, good breakfast and the location was superb. Close to the Houston Station, which was really easy to reach from the airport. From the hotel you can take 2 busses into the city centre. Both on walking distance. But also around the hotel there is plenty to do. 

This all together with a Hilton Service made it a stay to remember. We were welcome by Renate who was really friendly and accommodating. We had some request before we arrived and send an e-mail. Stacey, at reservations, kindly helped us out and made sure we were all set!

So the next time we will return to Dublin, we will definitely stay here again. Thank you!",5,2016,05,06
240,Short Break,"Restaurant shut and noise from building works awful as trying to get away from that.  Apparently kitchen works going on.  Restaurant apparently shut of a night as menu change but open in morning???   Fill this part up now as required.  Hotel OK lot of places booked up 100 year celebration.  Hop on and off bus with 48 hour ticket and guiness priority tour good,",2,2016,05,06
240,This is a great hotel!,"A very pleasant, light and airy hotel. Very modern and well appointed clean room and bathroom, very comfortable beds. Breakfast was very good but could have been hotter (in my experience, always a challenge with buffet breakfast) Offered fresh honey from a honeycombe - a unique experience. Very wide choice of food too. A little way out from the city centre - approx.30 minute walk but with bus stops close by as well or a 17 Euro taxi fare. Staff very friendly and helpful too. Will definitely use the hotel again on our next visit to Dublin.",5,2016,05,05
240,Jonathan McFely,"Jonathan McFely is the best representative of Irish hospitality I have encountered.  He made our stay pleasant and enjoyable.  I would highly recommend the Hilton Dublin Kilmainham and its staff.  The rooms are attractive,spacious and clean.  The hotel location is perfect, walking distance from major attractions and the railroad station. Breakfast is tasty and complete.  ",5,2016,05,04
240,a warm and welcome stay,"great sized room very pleasant. we had access to the Living Well facilities and found these to be very good too. the pool and sauna were quiet so no stress. we had breakfast and found it to be very good with lots of choice. the room was very good, with view of kilmainham goal. buses stopped right outside so we could just jump on with our hop on hop off pass whenever we wanted. wifi was available but couldnt get it to work on our phones very well, although we did have access to the computers in the business section if we needed. all in all a great weekend",4,2016,05,04
240,May bank holiday weekend,"Felt that our two night stay was way over priced. While we have always enjoyed staying wiyh you , we felt on this occasion that your organisation showed very little regard for us as clients considering the price we were charged. your location is ideal the staff are friendly ,hotel is great but its just after leaving the real world when it comes to what ye charged last weekend.",4,2016,05,04
240,"Nice hotel, upper floors are quieter","I frequently use this hotel for business overnight stays, and it's good, clean and generally quiet. There is some traffic noise when you stay on the east side lower rooms, but it's not ridiculous. The breakfast is expensive, although it's of reasonably high quality. There is a cafe a few doors along (Lime Tree Cafe) which offers more affordable breakfast choices.",4,2016,05,01
240,Excellent 4 star Hotel in Dublin,"Great size room for Europe. Excellent price, for what you get. Very clean. 
Breakfast was very poor but then again it was very cheap. The hotel is a little far away from the attractions but is a short bus ride away (10 mins) from them.
Staff were very friendly and helpful.
Overall I was very impressed with what I got for my money and would go back again.",5,2016,05,01
240,Very pleasant stay ,"We booked this hotel for an overnight after a concert as it's location was practical. As it happened the concert was cancelled at short notice. We nonetheless had a very enjoyable stay.  The food in the bar was delicious as was the breakfast.  The personnel friendly and helpful, especially Sarah Rose in Reception, Kalman and Agne in the restaurant
The room and facilities were as expected, very good.",4,2016,04,30
240,Not great,Stayed as part of a group family wedding. Not enough staff to help behind the bar or at breakfast time. Never stayed in a hotel of this rating and had self service buffet breakfast and tea served in a mug! Should be cup & saucer! Felt more like a travelodge but much more expensive (no disrespect to Travelodge intended),2,2016,04,29
240,Nice hotel ,"The hotel has a decent number of pluses.  First it is right across the street from the jail which offers great views.  I however, despite being a diamond member didn't get a view of that side.  The lobby is nice. The bar area is nice.  The breakfast was very good. The staff was helpful is arranging taxis and on checking in.  It is within walking distance of the zoo. The drawback is that it is outside the city center so I ended up paying a lot for taxi rides back and forth. ",4,2016,04,29
240,Nice hotel,"This is a very nice hotel and the staff were very friendly. It's located right across from the famous jail (warning tickets sell out fast for the jail, so order ahead). The hotel is also within walking distance of Phoenix Park and Dublin Zoo, which was really nice. The city center is a taxi ride away though. Room was spacious and comfy. Would stay again. ",4,2016,04,29
240,Weekend in Dublin,"Brilliant location for the wedding at the Royal Hospital. Nice arrival space but reception staff were difficult to understand and became annoying when we asked for a repeat of the arrival procedure. The room was good, generous and had a beautiful view of the Hospital grounds. 
We went down to the bar to have a drink and await our friends...what a bad experience that was. A rude and disinterested barman who did not want to serve us. Every time we went to the bar all male staff were like this one poor young woman was trying her best to cope. They really need to sort out the staffing. ",3,2016,04,28
240,Business break two days,"Franchise Hilton
Staff very good
Sinead - bar manager in particular
Was very good at dealing with a few bugling issues and completely turned them around to completely satisfy me in my stay
Breakfast was good
Had room service in the evenings 
Room was clean and spacious and the view from the fourth floor was good
About 4km outside city centre but easily accessible 
Opposite the historic jail which is definitely worth a visit
I will be coming back in two weeks and three further times in the next two months and once again would like to thank Sinead the GM and her team, but especially once again - Sinead BM for an enjoyable business break
Also a good shout out to the in-house reservations team who were both friendly and responsive ...well done guys",4,2016,04,27
240,Clean and Friendly Hotel - Great Location,"I had an extended and very pleasant stay at the Hilton Kilmainham while a family member was in St James Hospital. The staff were efficient, kind, friendly and made me feel at home. Access to the hotel and its high quality facilities were a tremendous help in getting through a challenging time. The general area area around Kilmainham provides many places of interest and many beautiful walks. It was a very quick hop into Dublin City Centre on the LUAS and it only took 25 minutes or so on foot. A great all rounder.",4,2016,04,27
240,Great place to stay.,"This hotel was excellent. A little out of the centre but that's what is good as you can escape the busy city.The city centre however, is easily accessible. The hotel itself is a reasonable price,spotlessly clean,the rooms are a good size and comfortable. The staff couldn't do enough for you and all are very friendly. I would definitely recommend staying here.",5,2016,04,25
240,Avoid if possible,"I live locally so I attend the Hilton for food and drinks regularly. The service is one of the worst in Dublin. I will give you money if you find worse. If you ask for something expect a face that looks like you just woke them up from a nap at home and asked them to explain quantum computing while doing jumping jacks. Customers feel like an inconvenience and awkward. 
The waiters, correction, the men walking around dressed in black are forgetful, rude, absent minded and all round terrible at their jobs. I asked one lad working in the lounge for a high chair for my 15 month old after he just came from getting one for another couple and he asked me where I was sitting. I replied outside and pointed to where we were. He aggressively replied ""Ask my colleague. He's working outside."" I thought that was strange, but OK. I went outside to his colleague for a high chair. He replied ""ask at the bar inside."" Eventually got the high chair.
We ordered. They brought one dish for my wife - forgot about mine. 20-25 mins later got my food. 
The table next to us were ignored for about 30 mins so when they finally got the attention of the waiter to order food he told them he wasn't taking any more orders as the area was reserved. They complained to manager and got free food but this had already spoiled their afternoon. 

I've never had to bring a pint back anywhere else and have had to bring back 3 pints on separate occasions there.",2,2016,04,25
240,Top tier service,"Great hotel for Dublin stay. Recommend taking Cityscape's tour bus to get to center city. Lovely, historic neighborhood, walkable to Guinness storehouse. Don't miss Kilmainham Jail across the street! Breakfast is full buffet with many healthy options, including fresh honey.",5,2016,04,25
240,Great Customer Values,"Surprised my husband for his birthday to a weekend to Ireland, We had a great time in this Hotel despite a problem with the water (caused by the local authorities). 

I would like to write this review as a positive experience of how a problem should be dealt with as the Staff at the Kilmainham Hilton did with ease. 

We were generously compensated for this problem and the Manager took ownership with keeping us informed every step of attempting to resolve this. 

We would stay here again as this is very beautiful and we were treated with inportance and care.

Thank you for our pleasent stay at the hotel, we will be back.

240,Very poor,"Ate at the bar on a Sunday afternoon (probably should have known better) Experienced really slow service: and felt that staff were annoyed if you asked them for something. The food was very, very average for the price. Had wings that were in a sauce that was just ketchup and water... What a joke. Steak sandwich was overcooked but partner's burger was just ok. 

Don't go here for food. ",2,2016,04,24
240,Out of centre but easy to find,"This Hilton is one of the modern ones, it's has good size beds and the rooms are well decorated, the lobby floor has the restaurant and bar which for Dublin are not that expensive really

The trip I had was a overnight stop on way to the states and didn't fancy an airport hotel. The air bus runs near by and taxis to airport are not too expensive either.

The hotel is located next to the kilmainham jail and museum and a stone throw from the Guinness factory",4,2016,04,22
240,"Comfortable, convenient and good value","I selected the hotel for a group of us who were attending a seminar. I didn't know anyone who had stayed there, but the location had proximity to the seminar venue and the name of the the hotel had familiarity for the international travellers. It turned out to be a much better hotel experience than I anticipated. Generously sized room, large kingsize bed, and very clean room and en suite. Loved the in-house amenities coffee/bar area, with large outside seating area. Across the road is Kilmainham gaol which unfortunately was booked up, but we crossed the road in the other direction and enjoyed a tranquil walk through landscaped gardens to the Irish Museum of Modern Art, and walked on down to St James Gate for the Guiness tour. Great to have the close access to enjoy some downtime. A small couple of criticisms, the tissue container by the sink in the en suite was empty, the salt cellar on the table for breakfast was empty. Otherwise great value for money and a very comfortable stay. I will book again",4,2016,04,21
240,Nice Hotel Friendly staff,Great location with Luas 10 mins walk. Hotel very clean and pleasant staff. good food. Dodgy heating/AC controls. If you are planning on using a prepaid voucher make sure you check the small print before booking.,4,2016,04,21
240,Exceptional Staff & Service,"We arrived a bit early but were relieved when the staff were accommodating. Staff were friendly, welcoming, attentive and unbelievably helpful! The hotel is located in a great area across the street from hop on hop off buses and transportation. Will be returning! ",5,2016,04,21
240,Couldn't ask for more,"This hotel is in a perfect location, a short walk from Houston station, Guinness factory and across the road from the kilmainham gaol. We actually took a local bus to temple bar area which was straight forward enough and the tour buses all stop right at the hotel which is the very last stop. 

The hotel itself is what you would expect from a Hilton, spotless room, quiet, comfortable beds. Beautiful leisure facilities and breakfast with everything except potato scones!! 

Would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,04,20
240,Fantastic hotel ,"We stayed for a long weekend in April. We loved the hotel very comfortable and clean, beautiful breakfasts. Location is further out of Dublin centre but you are right opposite Kilmainham Gaol and there is a hop on/ hop off bus stop right there too. Centre is walkable in about 45 mins but is an easy straight walk, Guiness storehouse, museum of modern art, Heuston station and Phoenix park are all near by. Would stay again. ",4,2016,04,20
240,"Great room overlooking one of Dublin's best attractions, Staff and services wonderful","My wife and I recently took a long planned trip to Ireland.  We began in Dublin then worked our way down to Killarny, then Sneem, and closed out our trip in Galway.  Have to say we really enjoyed our time in Dublin (despite the torrential rain...).  And this is in large part due to our stay at the Hilton.  The location is very conenient - make sure to take the tour of the Kilmainham Gaol, fascinating part of Ireland's history.  You're also walking distance to the Guinness Storehouse which their head chef jokingly told me it's against Irish law to visit Dublin and not do the tour.  :^)  

As far as the rooms go they were fabulous.  Very spacious, and decor made it ""homey"".  Service however is where the Hilton shines in my opinion.  They seemed to go out of their way to make sure there was no queue at the reception.  Even when it meant fielding my frequent asks, including borrowing one of the staff's chargers because mine broke.  And the food quality and selection was excellent.

Anyhow, I would have no problems recommending this hotel to anyone visiting the Dublin area.",5,2016,04,19
240,Nice reasonably priced hotel,A lovely hotel away from the City Centre but easy to travel into.  It was clean and tidy with staff that were both helpful and friendly.  Nothing was too much trouble for them.  The only downside was that the bar ran out of Bailey's so we were unable to have our favourite nightcap!,5,2016,04,18
240,"Great hotel, what you'd expect from a Hilton ","Hotel is ideally located away from Dublin centre but easy enough to travel into. Hotel was clean, tidy & well looked after. Bar & restaurant staff were great. Reception staff were helpful. Hotel ideally located to visit kilmainham gaol & to use hop on hop off sight seen big tours. Plus only 5 mins in the car from Waterstown parkrun 
",4,2016,04,17
240,"Poor facilities, poor service","I was booked into this hotel by a client , principally because of its location. It was a mistake.

It's difficult to think how a hotel could be less interested in the experience of its guests than the Kilmainham Hilton. The list of deficiencies is extensive but includes:

Nothing in the mini bar,
No film channel on the TV,
Supposedly ""high speed WiFi"" which took two minutes to load a page and on which catch up TV was impossible to view,
No bathroom products beyond soap and shampoo,
Room not cleaned until 3.30pm in the afternoon,
20 minute wait for a sticking plaster to cover a bleeding cut,
Room service questioning how I was going to pay for a meal and whether my credit card guarantee was sufficient,
No half bottles of wine on room service,
Basic and uninspiring food menu,
Bar staff who didn't understand basic English.

On the flip side breakfast was good and the restaurant staff were friendly but this doesn't make up for the fact this hotel is trying to accommodate guests on the cheap by cutting back on facilities and service.
",2,2016,04,14
240,So relaxing and top quality,"This is the sixth time I have stayed at this hotel. It is ideally placed and has easy access to all modes of transport to get around the city to all the venues.  It is situated opposite the Kilmainham Gaol which unfortunately for me had gone hi tech on the day we wanted to visit, and due to the short notice we were unable to get any tickets online for the visit.  The Hotel is superb, and has the use of the fitness suite which includes a pool, sauna and steam room. A great way to relax after a long day sightseeing and to start the night time activities.  I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,04,13
240,Great hotel,"As a Hilton diamond member I try stay at Hilton chains when possible. This was a top-notch hotel very clean rooms, roomy and great pool area. Also right across the street from the killer Kilmainham  jail. would definitely recommend visiting it and also the buses are right across hotel as well",5,2016,04,11
240,Great hotel for kids & adults alike,"I stayed here this week with my 4yr old son. The hotel is great and the pool was amazing! My son loved it, both pools are perfect fit children as are very warm and not to big or deep. 
We ate at the hotel one night which was lovely, nice food and relaxed atmosphere in the bar. The other night we are at the Italian across the road which was also lovely. 
Our room was spacious and clean plus it had a balcony so we could sit out and admire the views. 
We walked to the zoo from the hotel in about 20 mins and caught the tourist bus into town and then back to the hotel which my son loved. We had some nice sunny weather so could sit on the top open deck, great fun!
We also visited the IMMA, not an immediate first choice for kids as the exhibitions are small and the theme when we were there was 'adult' but the cafe was great and had loads of toys etc. the grounds and gardens are also brilliant for kids. We spent 3 hours there without my son being bored which surprised me!",5,2016,04,09
240,hotel stay in dublin,"Great hotel - within a ten minute taxi ride of the city centre.  Clean room, very comfortable bed and friendly staff. A good restaurant within a couple of minutes walk from hotel and very handy to visit IMMA - just across the road.",4,2016,04,05
240,First Class,The hotel is well sited and the staff were lovely.  The rooms were very clean and the bed was superb. The food was top quality and a lovely warm experience overall on a wet and windy weekend. We will definitely stay here again as it's also convenient to the M50 travelling from the North.,5,2016,04,04
240,Excellent,We stayed for a weekend break to celebrate our anniversary. We found a lovely handwritten card and chocolates in our room! Our room was on the 5th floor with a great view over Dublin and the Wicklow hills. Despite being at a busy junction the room was really quiet and we had 2 really good nights sleep in a very comfortable bed with great pillows. Room had all the usual things you would expect from a 4* hotel. Food in the bar and for breakfast were excellent. Staff was all very friendly and efficient. Parking available in the underground carpark.,5,2016,04,03
240,Great location for Kilmainham Gaol and RHK,"Very good hotel for centenary 1916 celebrations and historic sites, Kilmainham Gaol and RHK Museum. Close to Phoenix Park, largest city park in Europe with roaming deer, the Irish president and American Ambassador's residence, Dublin zoo etc..",4,2016,04,02
240,Excellent,"The staff at this hotel makes this stay excellent from the time of check in till the moment we left .the family room was perfect for our 1night stay,  the swimming pool was excellent for my 8 and 9 year old and the pool was a good size  and warm . I booked dinner in advance on line and even though the restaurant at the time was not open i was given the choice  to order the set menu that I had booked  or order the 3 courses from the bar menu at no extra cost   in witch the food was  5star quality  so was the staff  that worked that  evening .perfect location if your visiting kilmainham jail (directly opposite) as well as the hop on hop off bus tours which is directly opposite the hotel and run every 15 minutes which take you on a tour round Dublin (approximately 2 hours and 10 mins if you decide not to hop off the bus during the time allocated approx 24 hours (1day pass )  
 The great knowlage and Irish banter from the  tour bus driver  was very entertaining and cost 10 Euro adult and  children ride free with accommodating, adult could be a max up to 2children just check that with the helpful staff in reception  well worth it .
. . I could not recommend this hotel any better and I hope the management realize the staff here  are a credit to the Hilton hotel chain as I would definitely come back to this hotel or book into a Hilton hotel based on my stay here at kilmainham

240,1916 Tour,"We couldn't have picked a better base for our family trip to Dublin during Easter 2016. The interconnecting rooms were spacious & well appointed. All the staff we came in contact with were obliging & very accommodating to the children.  Having a pool on site was a real bonus & ideal for winding down after a full day walking & exploring.  The location is fantastic, directly opposite the Gaol and across the road from the old Kilmainham hospital which is s great visit! Hope to be back soon.., ",5,2016,03,31
240,Centenary Visit,Great location and Great hotel. Staff is excellent. Restaurant and bar real good. WiFi wasn't good but I didn't report it because I was running all over to see family. I would stay again. It was such a busy weekend because of the Centenary and the hotel handled it as if nothing was going on. Excellent staff. The full Irish breakfast was great.,5,2016,03,31
240,Children not welcome,"Fitness centre turned my son away from the gym. Had to argue with staff to get him let in. Staff don't know their own rules. No introduction to the pools or gym, and no welcoming. Very poor for a 4 star hotel, in a friendly country. Complained to manager who could even be bothered to talk to me. Problems with room keys as system doesn't work properly.",1,2016,03,30
240,food,"the hotel website states there is a restaurant, it even shows a menu on the site. The restaurant is actually closed and has been from 2015. A hotel of this standard should update its website and advise of this situation upon booking.",3,2016,03,29
240,Can always depend on a Hilton,Overnite quickie with a good shuttle to the airport.  Usual Hilton comforts and service and like i have already said you know just what to expect when you check into a Hilton anywhere in the world. Shopping close by if one has the time.,4,2016,03,27
240,Bad location,Booked this hotel because it said it was minutes from city center but that was not the case.  By car the location is a good distance and the location is about 10 minutes from the nearest train station and by train is still 15 minutes or so away.  In walking around this hotel was also not in the best of locations.  This inconvenience really put a damper on our vacation.,1,2016,03,27
240,Good customer service,"Stayed for 1 night for connecting flight the next day. Enjoyable stay. Staff are very helpful. Check in was quick and painless. Good quality food serve during breakfast. Good variety provided. 
Eating out is easy. Just walk across the road. Tesco is just 5 minutes walk away. 
hotel shuttle service to and from airport was very efficient. Would stay there again.",5,2016,03,25
240,Excellent Service,"My wife and I stayed in the hotel as part of a Tour w/ Global. Eventhough the hotel is only a 4 star hotel, the rooms, restaurant & service is worthy of 5 * hotel. They went out of their way to fix a problem we had with being overcharged by a taxi used by the hotel. The reception attendants were very helpful. Excellent service overall.",5,2016,03,24
240,"Good room, amazing service, horrible wifi and dirty water from the bathroom taps!","I was in Dublin a couple of days for business. The hotel fee was covered by company. Upon my arrival, people at the reception were literally amazing, cheerful and nice, as usual in the Hilton hotels.
The room was also very large, featuring a big desk, queen-size bed, an armchair and an amazing wardrobe. They also offered two bottles of water free of charge.
The reason why I am rating this hotel a 3-star is because of the wi-fi: it is NOT possible to provide such UNUSABLE and SLOW connection to the guests. I spent three hours one afternoon struggling to connect to the Internet to reach the Ryanair website and change my return flight. I am a business traveler and I cannot work without a decent Wi-Fi connection.
The other thing that disappointed me was in the morning when I tried to have a shower. The water coming from the shower tap was smelling and it looked yellow. But I was already in the shower and I was forced to wash myself like this. I reported the issue to the Reception, but it would take longer than my stay to fix the problem, so I avoided having a shower the day after.
Overall a very good and friendly service, but a broken wifi and dirty water issues really had a huge impact on my opinion for this hotel.",3,2016,03,24
240,Convenient to the Kilmainham Gaol,"We had a pleasant stay at the Hilton Dublin Kilmainham.  We took the Airport Express Bus to Heuston Station thinking that the hotel was conveniently located to the station, and boy, were we wrong!  We should have taken a taxi from Heuston Station to the hotel. 

This is a great location if you want to visit Guinness and Kilmainham Gaol.  It is also convenient if you are taking a rail journey (just take a taxi to the station).

The hotel restaurant had very good food.",4,2016,03,23
240,will be back,"excellent, good location to train station, stop and go bus at the doors, clean. Guinness brewery close walking distance and others If renting a car close exit to airport u for drives near to Dublin. Internet available and working full time",4,2016,03,23
240,Lovely Hotel,"Stayed in the Hilton, Kilmainham this month to attend a work night out. The hotel is really lovely. The rooms are very large and extremely well laid out, the bathroom is large and very modern. It's in a great quiet location. Bit of a walk into the city centre but there are plenty of taxis about. The cost of a taxi into town will probably cost you about ‚Ç¨10 to ‚Ç¨15. If you decide to walk your looking at 45 mins or so. You could also take a bus. 
Kilmainham jail is across the road and highly recommended, and the Royal hospital is next door. Good few things to see. 
All in all. Well recommended, good size modern rooms in a quiet location. Enjoy. ",5,2016,03,21
240,"Nice hotel......... As long as you don't need to shower,","Hotel generally very good. However very disappointed that when I woke up after a good nights sleep, I discovered there was no hot water to shower. On speaking to reception they explained the boiler was broken, however could not give any estimate of it being fixed. Time came to check out, still no hot water. When I checked out I received no apology. Just an offer of free parking. Which if I'm paying ‚Ç¨184 a night I would expect anyway! Very poor service in a lovely hotel......",2,2016,03,20
240,Dublin @ St Patricks Day,"Helpful Staff, Clean and tidy hotel just opposite the Museum of Modern Art and the Kilmainham Gaol.
Whilst centrally located in comparison with many hotels, its still to far to walk into the centre of Dublin (5 km).  The pool is fun for the kids but not much use if you want to swim lengths, its on a number of levels with a Jacuzzi.  Be aware there Health and Safety rules mean anyone with hair longer than a crewcut needs to wear a swim cap which the hotel sells for 2 Euro.
Food was standard hotel fare, expensive for what it is but typical of a large chain.
The reason I rated this a Very Good instead of Average was due to the staff.  Extremely pleasant, helpful and courteous.  Not many Irish amongst them but most of the staff were eager to ensure a pleasant stay.",4,2016,03,20
240,Great,Just leaving Dublin and have to say the Hilton Killmainhem was fantastic.   Staff are so friendly and the location is great. We walked to Heuston Station and quickly were off to other parts of Ireland. Easy walk to the Guinness factory and downtown.   Right across from the Gaol. Friendly area..few pubs though which has it's flaws in some respects. View from our room attached.,5,2016,03,19
240,Really good ,"Staff is friendly. I got a room not made but they acknowledged the mistake and proposed different solutions. The food and breakfast is good. Gym is a bit small. Not a lot of machines. 
Hotel has a good location ",4,2016,03,18
240,Dublin and the Hilton Kilmainham,"Dublin is a great city!  So much history here and things to see and do.  The people are wonderful; warm and welcoming and curious, as we were about them.  It was great to meet and talk with so many.  Be sure to stop in at the Brazen Head Bar - the oldest in Ireland - it's amazing and wonderful.  Just relax and enjoy your stay - Ireland is amazing!",5,2016,03,13
240,Excellent place for short stay-cation with little kids,"We spent our daughter's birthday weekend in this hotel - we got a family room - king bed plus sofa bed, no terrace - it was clean, and roomy - perfect for our family with little kids under 5. Staff were very courteous to us all through out our stay.

When I booked the hotel online, I requested for a late check-out; upon check-in, the man in the reception happily informed me we can check out before 2pm, at no extra charge. Just great so we can still have a dip in the pool in the morning and we won't be rushed to get things packed. When you travel with little kids, even if just for an overnight, my experience is that we pack a LOT of things. Add to that the gifts we brought for the birthday girl! 

Once we got to our room, we found a birthday card with personalised note and chocolates for the little girl (which I ended up eating as I don't want to my toddler to have too much sugar). Our first stay with the Kilmainham hotel was over my birthday last year - they also made it special with a slice of choc cake and fruit. These may seem simple, but the extra effort that the staff go for to make our visit special really makes Hilton Kilmainham my fave hotel. 

Lastly we loved their pool - it's a heated, indoor pool with just the right size for under 5. One thing I would point out to management is that there are one or two broken tiles in the small side pool (designed for the little ones) where the water from the big pool flows out - the tiles won't cut one's skin but to be safe it would be best to get some grout or a tile placed over the broken ones. The shower rooms were warm (vs other hotels we used with indoor pools but not properly heated) and there were sufficient supplies (soap, plastic bag, hairdryer, towels) to help us pack light when visiting the pool. Overall our stay was fun and relaxing - a combination much cherished by a young family with worn out parents.",5,2016,03,11
240,Business Excellence,"I attended an all day training day at the Hilton Kilmainham recently and found the facilities to be very impressive. I'd definitely stay there if I'm in Dublin again. I remember this Hotel being built when I lived nearby and they've done an excellent job. The view from the lobby into the Royal Hospital grounds is beautiful - you'd forget you're in Dublin City centre. On the other side, you've Kilmainham Jail, a must see visitor attraction - especially this year.
I walked up from Heuston station - a very handy 10 minute walk.
The meeting room was excellent - I couldn't get over how quiet it was. The room was full of natural light also. Lunch was lovely, WiFi was consistent and free - overall a really high-end experience. I look forward to returning.",5,2016,03,10
240,Great hotel,"I was traveling with my 2 young children. I prepaid room for 2 nights with breakfast included. I emailed ahead to ask for a rollaway bed to be in our king bedroom and a quiet room. When I arrived the bed was not ready so they put me in a family room. It was good size, king and twin, except around 8 pm I heard constant banging. The front desk quickly responded that it was the gym, so I was kinda upset by it went on till 10 pm then again in morning. The next day I asked to be moved to a higher floor. The gym is -1 and I was on floor 2 but still can hear gym weights. If you go to bed after 10 pm it's really no problem but due to my kids we are in bed early. The hotel reception is amazing they moved me to 5th floor a bigger room with balcony def an upgrade and I really appreciate this!
We used the pool it's free, and very nice but small.
We ate room service both nights, excellent food and the breakfast was great also no complaints.
The hop on bus is right in front of hotel we took the yellow one for 10 euros. Went to Dublin zoo which is big and has lots of play areas if it's dry out. Took hop on bus back to hotel and saw the rest of city, kids loved being on top with it open.
I don't think there is much to do or shopping near hotel but this bus is great to go to city, or quick taxi.
Taxi to hotel from airport is about 30‚Ç¨ half hour ride.
I think it's a great place to stay, beds were amazing all down pillows and comforters!
Will definetly return.",5,2016,03,09
240,Ticks most of the boxes,"Change of management shortly before my visit I believe, so still in a state of flux, but doing their best to make you feel welcome. Staff friendly and helpful. Did not have time to try the additional facilities as I was on a family visit for a Christening, but the relaxed atmosphere would make it a pleasant place to visit for coffee after visiting Kilmainham Gaol or MOMA both  opposite.",4,2016,03,08
240,Sweet location...!,"Glad to find this hotel so close to the city center and landmarks...! Also, great amenities including the hydro-massage pool, the restaurant/bar, the convenience of parking onsite, the quality of items at breakfast...Nice for any type of trip!",5,2016,03,08
240,Good Choice,Great option for business or pleasure. Easy to find and in a very good location. Lovely clean hotel with great size comfortable rooms. Bar food really good just not much choice for dietary requirements.,4,2016,03,07
240,Short stay,Stayed here for two days while on a course in Dublin.I could not praise this hotel enough from the friendliness and professionalism of the staff to the quality of the food and the cleanliness of the entire hotel. Well done! ,5,2016,03,05
240,Relaxing day,"Last day in Dublin, and wanted a hotel with Jacuzzi and pool. Really enjoyed here, only wish pool was deeper. There was steam room and sauna, and also room for training. Room was explendid, and big tv, both bathtub and shower.
Breakfast buffet had many choices of food, and staff very helpful. ",4,2016,03,02
240,"An average, nice and clean hotel.","The Room was clean and neat.
The breakfast buffet was okay, but not a lot of variety.
The location is not very far from city center, where you can go by bus or taxi. the bus would be 2.7 euros and the taxi depends on the traffic starting from 12 euros.
The lobby is not very big and overall the hotel is not very big as well.
It does have a gym and a swimming pool which I did not have time to check.

In short it is nice and clean and you can find everything in it, not a luxury hotel.",3,2016,03,02
240,Poor service,"The rooms were well equipped and clean and in a good decorative order, although off paint had been used and the smell was nasty. The service in the bar/restaurant was really really poor, whilst ordering drinks a staff member tried to avoid eye contact, when I actually got her attention she proceeded to start emptying glasses from the washer, and when I pressed the issue she said she would be a minute and walked off!! At lunch I had to get my own menus, and then chase the staff for service, then the bill couldn't be charged to the room as the payment system had a melt down! Bar staff not listening to orders, asking a question and not listening to the answer. This was the poor overall level of service throughout our stay.",3,2016,02,28
240,Much Better!,"Better stay than the last - road works outside now finished and access is a lot easier...also managed the walk from the station as we only had roll on cabin bags!
Nice stroll through the grounds of the adjacent Irish Modern Art Gallery, tarmac paths ok and around 10 minutes from Heuston Station to the hotel.
One night only and nearly managed the elusive upgrade...offered a room upgrade but it came with an adapted bathroom which I checked first and had to decline as this one reminded too much of a room in a hospital and totally devoid of any creature comforts...oh well!
Room we were given was of a good standard and reasonable nights sleep...as before bathroom on the small side but bearable for one night.
Dined out and only took breakfast in the hotel...as per previous review standard Hilton buffet and of reasonable standard, still no smiles from the staff however!",4,2016,02,26
240,Weekend break,"Avery pleasant stay. The hotel staff were most helpful assisting me with medical equipment that I required. The breakfasts were excellent, the room was clean light and airy. The dinner meal was of a very high standard and the restaurant staff provided an excellent service.",5,2016,02,24
240,Another great stay,Service and the rooms are top class and great value for money. I highly recommend this hotel. only a few minutes walking distance to the main train station and tram lines. Jonathan in reception was excellent and very helpful!! Thank you for another wonderful stay!,5,2016,02,21
240,First stop after a long flight,"We picked the Hilton Kilmainham to stay after our long haul flight from Australia - after 36 hours via Abu Dhabi our family of 2 adults and 2 teenage children were pretty tired.

We picked the Hilton Kilmainham because we knew we would be getting a good standard of accommodation and service.

Our family room was great and ready for us when we arrived and breakfast was wonderful with a wide selection of food including black and white pudding!  

Our only disappointment was that the pool and sauna was closed - no note of this on the website - we were looking forward to this after our long flight.",3,2016,02,20
240,Lots to enjoy......but more staff at reception please,"My visit started off badly with a 20 minute wait at reception. Only about 8 people in front of me but the 2 staff seemed to struggle.

The hotel is exactly what you'd expect from a new hotel in the Hilton chain - spacious room, nice bar, good wifi and an adequate breakfast.

There's a pool, not big enough for proper swimming, but nice for a dip and a small well equipped gym.",4,2016,02,20
240,"Secure parking,functional business orintated rooms,lovely pool and jacuzzi.",If it weren't for the semi functioning AC which left the room with a brrrrrr factor I might have scored 5 stars. The outside hallway was warmer than the room. The rooms are a reasonable size with a comfy bed. Room service is super quick and the food is above average. Underground secure parking links to the hotel (fee payable on departure). A small but well equipped gym is adjacent to a lovely pool. The pool is small and not suitable for serious swimming but it is extremely relaxing with a an interesting layout and subtle lighting and the water is hot hot hot. The jacuzzi is bath hot and fabulous to unwind after a long day at work. There is a sauna and a steam room ( the latter was out of order during my visit).,4,2016,02,17
240,Fantastic,"Great room, very clean, staff were so helpful! Beds and breakfast were amazing! Loads of choice at the buffet. Service was really great, all of the staff went out of their way to look after everyone. Will definitely stay again!",5,2016,02,14
240,Excellent !!,"Went here for Valentines. Wasn't expecting the level of service and standard of the rooms and breakfast...WOW! What great staff - so friendly, so accommodating, nothing was too much trouble for them. Beds were absolutely brilliant, I think we had the best sleep of our lives! The rooms were absolutely spotlessly clean. The buffet breakfast had everything you could possibly want - yummy Irish fry/salmon and tapas type of stuff/fruit...I actually cant remember everything because there was so much! Worth paying a bit extra for. The leisure centre was really good too, and it is very complete with steam room, sauna, etc. The only thing that was a bit annoying was the keys - they give you one for the lift/room and another for the electricity and I saw that other guests had the same problem because it was a bit confusing. But I'm not petty and I would still give this five stars for all of the unexpected good things! Well done Hilton!",5,2016,02,14
240,A god place for a stop off,"Stayed here on business. Hotel check-in efficient, room was great and the breakfast was fine. Only stayed one night, but all worked well. Nothing too much trouble for the reception team. I didn't use any of the leisure facilities - but plenty did!",3,2016,02,14
240,Late Christmas Present Weekend away,"I stayed here a few weeks ago after a evening at the Bord Gais Theatre. The hotel wasn't too far from the city centre and the rooms were amazing. The security was great as the lifts only work with a valid working room key. We didn't check to see it was floor specific but either way it was great. The breakfast was great, there wasn't the selection that we have found at other Hiltons but the others have been Double Tree's and in either the UK or Canada. Fantastic hotel and would stay here again without question.",5,2016,02,13
240,"Nice hotel, spotty service and amenities","Upon arrival we found out that our room wasn't ready.  After a long flight we were ready to get checked in and take a short nap, but it was going to have to wait.  We left our bags with the front desk and went on a quick tour around Dublin.  After a few hours we came back to the hotel and luckily our room was ready.  

The room was very nice, spacious, and appeared clean.  We had a very nice balcony that overlooked the main road and some trees.  It was relatively cold so we didn't get to spend a lot of time there, but it was a nice perk.

The problem came when we wanted to take a shower.  The water was cold...not just cold, but freezing.  Unfortunately the hotel appeared full so we couldn't switch rooms.  The water would warm up for 2 or 3 seconds and switch right back to freezing.  They were very quick showers and because the weather was already cold, that made it even worse....not enjoyable..lol.

Breakfast was another issue.  We walked into breakfast well before the time came for it to end and they seemed to just stop replenishing the items.  My wife is a relatively picky eater and there isn't much on the buffet she liked...bread is an easy one.  They were out of every single bread option.  She asked them if they could bring her some and they said they would.  10 minutes later she followed up and again they said they would....nothing.  They just disappeared.  The food remaining on the buffet appeared relatively old and unappetizing.  I even heard the waitress tell one of the people bring food out that the time was coming to close the bar and they shouldn't be bringing new food out.  Very disappointing considering the price we were paying for the room.",3,2016,02,11
240,Nice convenient hotel - disappointed car park charge,"Stayed with my 2 friends Saturday night. Hotel is lovely, great facilities and very clean - as you would expect from 4star.
However on top of the room rate each one of you had to pay ‚Ç¨12 daily rate for car park... :/ other than that no issues..hotel was very busy with welsh rugby team staying over which was also a bonus! :)",4,2016,02,09
240,Business Stay,On check-in I got a complimentary upgrade to a room with a view which was lovely. The view itself was over the Kilmainham Gaol (jail in English). The room is modern and comfortable and the bathroom was clean and spacious. The hotel is located just off the N4 and easily accessible from the N7 so it was an ideal choice for my early business meeting. Free wifi was perfect too. The only down side was that the lady on reception was not able to recommend a running route and I would've liked some more water in my room (for after my run).,4,2016,02,09
240,"Lovely room, brilliant staff, fantastic hotel!","I stayed for 4 days with work throughout my time the wifi was perfect and unlimited, the rooms were well cleaned everyday. The room itself was very spacious and modern, the staff were lovely and were happy to go the extra mile. 
Although the restaurant was closed whilst I stayed there the bar had a great selection of food and the room service menu had a decent selection. 
The pool was amazing, and the gym was well equipped with plenty of machines.
Breakfast was lovely with plenty of choice.
I would definitely stay here again!",5,2016,02,07
240,Excellent,"Beautiful and modern, sound proof.  Quality fittings, great bed and Linen.  Good TV, and wifi, always friendly service. The castle looking building in the photos is directly out the front.  It's an old prison.  Lovely breakfast, and really good coffee. ",5,2016,02,06
240,always enjoy my stay,"I always enjoy my stay at this Hilton, my family and I are treated very nice. We have stayed a few times and the staff looks after us. The hotel is very clean and rooms are nice. The breakfast is over the top. The front desk is always receptive to anything we might need.",5,2016,02,05
240,Girls weekend ,Absolutely beautiful hotel. Stayed here with one friend for a girls weekend Staff couldn't do enough to help and advise us- as we clearly didn't know the area and where to go. Only down side was it was a bit away from anywhere to eat and drink but the staff were happy to arrange a taxi to take us into town. Loved it!,5,2016,02,03
240,Nicely located Hotel lacking in charm and character,"The Hilton has a really nice area at the front of the building, it is South Facing so when the sun is out it is great for a drink. The food is very average and over priced and the service is very hit and miss, sometimes passable and sometimes lamentable. Go for a drink on sunny day and but elsewhere for food",2,2016,02,03
240,Excellent Hotel + Staff,"I stayed in the Hilton in Kilmainham with my daughter on Dec 20th +21st.  We had only planned a one-night stay but unfortunately my daughter took sick (with the Norovirus!) and we had to stay an extra night.
All the hotel staff were wonderful with us, very understanding and helpful. The staff on the desk made no issue of us not checking out as we should have done and organised us to have the same room for the second night.
I would particularly like to single out Aurimas the night porter who could not have been kinder and more helpful. He made toast and coffee for me and brought it to the room and rang several times to see if there was anything else he could do to help us.  He had a very professional and courteous manner, whilst being sympathetic to our dilemma.
I have stayed at the Kilmainham on numerous occasions and find it an excellent hotel in every way.",5,2016,02,01
240,Overnight stay,"Stayed here after a family function

Beautiful hotel with underground carpark

Polite and helpful staff

Extremely comfortable accommodation

Easy access route to City Centre

Situated beside Kilmainham Jail

Close to Phoenix Park",5,2016,01,28
240,Friendly staff and excellent facilities,"This was my first stay at this hotel. Staff were very friendly an ddealt with queries quickly and effciciently. The room and other faciltites were comfortable, clean and proavided a relaxing ambience. Business faciltites were excellent.",5,2016,01,22
240,Great breakfast,Stayed here on business for one night.   Nice clean & functional hotel.  (Has a spa/gym but I didn't use so can't comment).   The breakfast however was really good.  Lovely array of fresh fruit and a nice cooked buffet that was fresh with good ingredients,5,2016,01,21
240,Nice hotel ,Very friendly staff and a warm welcome from Jonathan on reception.We had a lovely room with a balcony .The hotel is-directly  across the road from kilmainham gaol and the enterence to the Royal hospital Kilmainham which is now a museum of Arts and has the oldest graveyard in Ireland known as bully's acre.The food in the restaurant was great.The swimming pool was lovely and warm and there was a steam room and sauna.All the staff were very helpful from arranging taxis to a concert for us and delivering a snack to our room for us afterwards as we returned late.The breakfast was a buffet with plenty of choice and was available till 11am.Would definitely stay here again.,5,2016,01,18
240,"standard Hilton, sans charme particulier","business trip in Dublin. late arrival 11pm (restaurant/bar... ) closed. if you are hungry you have to use the room service. I ordered a club sandwich (30mn delay). I gave up.
room without charm but having what is needed. large bed, desk big enough to work, several electricity switches to recharge iphone, ipad.... quiet place but you need to order a cab as there is no much trafic around. Breakfast OK but nothing exciting.",4,2016,01,16
240,Friendly atmosphere,"While the hotel is a bit dark and could do with brightening up, the staff made up for this by being very friendly and helpful. Nothing was too much effort and they greeted everyone with a smile, a friendly face and a desire to be of service. When travelling long distances it is the people you meet who can make or break the trip. With staff like this who could fail but to enjoy themselves.",4,2016,01,16
240,A pleasant stay in a great location ,"We stayed here in October 15 to attend a concert in the Olympia. I have to say it is hard to fault the hotel. The staff are friendly, the rooms are lovely too, we awoke to the Dublin marathon running by outside our window but never heard a thing during the night.

There was a lovely buffet breakfast that is hard to fault. We couldn't leave the car park until after 1 due to the marathon but that was no problem, as there are plenty of great places to visit within walking distance. The only thing is that there is a charge for the car park and while it is reasonable it would be nice to have free car parking for guests.",4,2016,01,13
240,Front Desk,"Cashier on Front Desk need training. There was confusion as to whether I had paid for my room charge on arrival and in person, which I did. As with all other hotels that offer a self service breakfast, this could have been a lot hotter. Everything else about the hotel was excellent.",4,2016,01,12
240,good location,"This hotel is a block from a bus that brings you to the city center in 15 minutes for less than 3 Euros, and three blocks from Heuston Station, the last stop for the airport bus, which is also a jumping off point to tour Ireland.  It is right across from the Gaol and the modern art museum.",5,2016,01,11
240,Perfect for the job in hand ,"Well appointed unpretentious hotel. Easy check in, comfortable and functional room, free Internet access. 
Breakfast was a good full blown Irish but it lacked freshly cooked ingredients. 
Would recommend this for future business trips",4,2016,01,10
240,Truly wonderful,"The Hilton Kilmainham was a lovely and perfect place to stay during my short time in Dublin. It is in a convenient location where I can walk to some local attractions and even catch the CityScape Tour Bus (Only 10 Euro!) just across the street from the hotel.   Next time I come to Dublin, I will most definitely be staying there!",5,2016,01,08
240,"Fantastic Hotel, Staff & Food","We had an excellent time in Hilton Kilmainham, there was 6 adults and 3 kids we all agreed it was a fantastic hotel. From the moment we checked in we were greeted by Jonathon on reception who was so helpful and friendly and gave us all the information we required for our stay! The Room was spacious and very clean.Then we made our way to the pool and was greeted by another friendly staff member unfortunately I did not get her name. Then we dined in the bar, the food was fabulous and the service was excellent, our waiter was Aidan he has fantastic he could not do enough for us! I will definitely be back to the Hilton Dublin Kilmainham.",5,2016,01,06
240,Very pleasant and comfortable hotel. ,"Great hotel with plush comfortable rooms. Our bed was super king sized and so comfortable! 
The staff was cheerful and friendly. 
Our meal in the bar was tasty and reasonably priced. 
The breakfast buffet was very well stocked and really tasty. 
This hotel is located in Kilmainham right beside the Gaol and the Royal Hospital with its lovely gardens. It is also close to the Guinness Storehouse (10 walk) and the city is approximately 30 minutes of a walk depending on where you are going. It's approximately ‚Ç¨8-10 in a taxi. 
Would definitely return. ",5,2016,01,04
240,Christmas/birthday trip,"Amazing hotel, amazing time! The food was lovely the room was  spacious and comfortable, we love the hilton! They can't do enough for you.  
We also visited the guiness factory which is great even for non fans. You learn how to pull a pint and how to properly drink and taste the drink. Then at the end you get a free pint in the sky bar which has great views over Dublin ",5,2016,01,03
240,Wonderful Front-line staff,"We arrived quite early on the day of check in as the plane landed at 5 am.  The hotel staff was awesome in getting me a room at 7 am and I passed out.  When we woke up we went to the front desk and received the most wonderful reception and hospitality imaginable.  Anna (front desk) was awesome and helped us everyday with guiding us to incredible places around the country.  Our day was not complete until we checked in with Anna and received the best advice ""ever"".  A wonderful stay and look forward to returning again...",5,2016,01,02
240,Lovely Hotel,"I stayed with my husband last week.  We found the hotel staff friendly and helpful and the breakfast was great.  I would stay at this hotel again.  We walked to St James Hospital, it takes about twenty mins.",5,2015,12,21
240,Friendly staff excellent Hotel,"This is a perfect location for exploring the many historic parts of Dublin, Business wise its probably got the best room design to setup a mobile office with comfortable furnishings.   The reception staff are very friendly and the every other member of staff be it the bar to the house keeping are guest aware and very helpful, something sadly missing in most other hotels in Europe.",5,2015,12,20
240,Never again,"I booked an upgraded room not the standard. It was dull and dingy with the bathroom tap broken, the TV was dated. The bar would not make me a cocktail because they were 'busy'. I was ignored at breakfast and had to get my own coffee. the receptionist told an important call I had checked without trying the room. There was non hotel staff using the gym and messing about in the lifts and leaving rubbish in them. Does not compare with other hotel of the same grade. I was travelling with my autistic son and was made to feel like a second class citizen.",2,2015,12,15
240,Great Stay,"A great place to stay - away from the city centre yet within walking/taxi distance. Definitely recommend to anyone for their future stay. Food is good, staff are friendly and efficient. I have not tried any other Hilton Hotel but would definitely check them out as an option in the future - wherever I'm staying.",5,2015,12,14
240,Great Stay,"This hotel was very comfortable and the food was great! The hotel lobby was nice, the rooms were clean and staff was friendly. This is one of the nicest Hilton's we have stayed at. Within walking distance to many things.",5,2015,12,14
240,"Very Nice Place, Would Defintely Stay There Again","The suite we stayed in gets a thumbs up, it was clean and spacious, the bed and bathroom were large and the balcony was a very nice touch although it was often too cold & windy to sit out there! 

The service and the staff were on the best level I've ever experienced. They were all friendly, helpful and very welcoming, polite people. They all seemed genuinely nice, not like they were forced to be nice to their consumers.

For breakfast there was a large selection of food and I would also recommend the hotel restaurant food.

There were only 2 downsides to whole thing: the mini bar in our room didn't work so the beverages weren't cold and our card/room key wouldn't work. They reprogrammed the keys a number of times on out 3 night stay but they would stop working and lock us out of the room until we had them rebooted at reception. They were such minor details though considering the overall stay was fabulous.",4,2015,12,14
240,"Irish Breakfast, num num num","Not only did they let me check in at 09:30, the lobby was Merry Christmas to the max! Great place and walking distance to the Gaol, Guinness, two awesome Churches and more. Lastly, but most important (wait for it) Irish Breakfast FREE! I'm a fan, no complaints.",5,2015,12,11
240,A Great Weekend,My wife and I stayed at the Hilton Kilmainham over the weekend. The hotel room was clean and spacious and there was no noise at night. We enjoyed a lovely relaxed weekend. The check-in and check-out were efficient with no waiting. Staff we interacted with were friendly and helpful. The meal served at the ball we attended was of a high quality.,5,2015,12,08
240,Good hotel for business stay,"I've been to this place for an interview. The hotel stuff is absolutely friendly. They gave me a map and directed me to tourist attractions in the city. Hotel room was also clean and nice. Although hotel is nice, it's not close to any tourist attraction.",4,2015,12,04
240,Kind of boring and corporatey.  Should have stayed closer to the center of town,"This Hilton was like every other Hilton that I stay in. Clean, a little expensive, and the staff was fine.  It was just boring and in a city like Dublin you want to stay somewhere with more soul.  It's not like in the US, where you are on a business trip and don't go anywhere other than the client meeting, the restaurant and the hotel.  In Dublin, there are so many amazing places, just none near this hotel.  So I would say find a better location.",3,2015,12,03
240,Hilton Without The Hilton!!!,We had a helicopter noise in the room all night. Porter told us it was a fan and he would turn it off... Did not happen though.... Worst Hot Breakfast experience ever everything cold and a sign beside the plates to say caution hot plates... somebody put this in the wrong place because they were freezing cold too. Told the manager on check out got free ‚Ç¨12 parking....!! I took this as a joke after paying ‚Ç¨165 for the room....,2,2015,12,01
240,Modern clean hotel,"Large guest room with king sized bed. Good facilities, all you would expect from a Hilton. Lively bar and restaurant, extensive breakfast selection. Not centrally located so not for everyone. I'd recommend and would return.",4,2015,11,30
240,Very good and clean hotel,"Great accommodation - clean and well-kept. Good service too. Bathroom was clean and well supplied with towels and toiletries. Bed linen was in good condition, crisp and clean. There was peace and quiet for a good night sleep. 

      
      ",5,2015,11,28
240,"Not close to business centers, shopping or nightlife","The hotel is a 10 euro trip from downtown. Taxis are only sometime sin front of the door and have to be called (surcharge). Room is clean and large, but this is expected for a Hilton. Breakfast is good, also in the room-service version. Staff is helpful, but too junior. Some confison with credit card details getting lost and also having to ask for a mouse at the reception for the internet in the looby to be accessed is quite strange. Water in shower changes temperature for no reason and in fron of windows a metal grid is causing a strange sensation.",3,2015,11,25
240,Enjoyable,"Compared to previous visit last year the dining room and food was much improved.
The only criticism I have would be that the porridge was tasteless.  It was made with water and would have been much more edible made with milk.
Staff were very helpful and friendly.
      ",4,2015,11,22
240,Clean & Quiet,We stayed here for four nights while visiting all the sites in Dublin.   We had a great breakfast buffet each morning for $13 each before we went sightseeing.   The staff was very helpful with destination questions.   The hotel is about a block away from the city bus line.  The #40 bus took us downtown each morning.  It even took us all the way to Glasnevin Cemetery.   Sometimes we took a taxi downtown; about $12 including tip.,5,2015,11,21
240,Weekend away in Dublin,"Stayed at the hilton Kilmainham. Had a lovely time exploring Dublin thanks to the tips given by the girl on reception when we arrived. She was very friendly and helpful even offered me an umbrella when we arrived at it was raining.

We stayed in a dulux king size room which was nice and clean. Although we had a balcony the weather wasn't good to make use of it. 

We had a really bad experience at breakfast the first morning There was no tables ready, they were running out of everything fod, plates, glasses. Have to say the second morning was much better.  I have stayed At a few Hiltons and the service on the first morning is not something I would have expected.

As we wanted to explore Dublin we did not make use of the restaurant. Bar or leisure facilities",3,2015,11,21
240,Excellent city hotel,Great location and excellent sized rooms for a city centre hotel.  Car parking is extortionate and would be a preventative reason for not staying again which is disappointing as a frequent visitor to Dublin.  Easy access to Dublin city center and the m50.,4,2015,11,19
240,Anniversary hotel stay,"We stayed at the Hilton Kilmainham for our anniversary from Fri13th Nov until Sunday 16th and the stay was completely faultless. The staff were friendly and helpful, the room was spotlessly clean and the Spa was fabulous. We ate in the hotel bar and the food was lovely. We've stayed in many hotels all over the world and this one is definitely up there with the best of them. I would definitely recommend it.",5,2015,11,18
240,Convenient and good value,"This Hilton is in an excellent location close to city centre and with great size bedrooms, bar lovely and food good, easy walking distance to Temple Bar if weather good, and convenient for the M4, excellent staff.",4,2015,11,16
240,Hilton Kilmainham --- Beyond Excellent,"This hotel is a role model for excellent customer service, extra efforts and accommodations.  The staff here were beyond professional and went above and beyond our expectations to create one of the best hotel experiences we have had in over 5 countries visited.",5,2015,11,16
240,Mixed stay,"A really mixed stay:
Positives- friendly staff, hard working breakfast staff, small pool and spa facilities
Negatives- breakfast management, mix up in cost of taxi to airport, breakfast service

Overall a pleasant stay but the service at breakfast was shocking, no cups, no clean tables, drinks brought late etc etc. Was not the fault of the waitresses who remained patient and helpful- they just had too much to do and led poorly by management- spoiled our stay a little as it made for a stressful start to each day",3,2015,11,15
240,Warm and friendly,"First time here and was impressed by the staff who made me feel welcome, a room without windows that open and an air con unit which was noisy but very clean. Bar staff were great as was the waitresses, breakfast in the morning let it down as certain things weren't available due to equipment not working. Would definitely stay again as the prices were good value for money",4,2015,11,13
240,Dublin meeting ,"Overnighted here to attend meting. Venue has excellent parking underneath at an additional cost to your stay. Currently local authorities are carrying out road works outside venue through the night until December. 
Food was standard enough for city centre hotel. Staff attentive and accommodating. Rooms excellent. Wifi poor.  ",3,2015,11,12
240,Great stay at this Hilton!,"We stayed at this hotel for 7 nights.  We arrived very early in the morning, and we could not have asked for a more accommodating front desk person. I had asked for an early check-in, and although the room we were booked for was not ready, he was able to get us a temporary room in the meantime.  I am a Hilton Honors Gold member, and could not be more pleased by the service provided by this gentleman. However, all of the front desk people were pleasant, friendly, and helpful. The room we had was large, clean, and had adequate toiletries. The only detriment was the room temperature which was quite warm for me and could not be adjusted.  This was somewhat resolved by providing an electric fan.  It would have been better if the thermostat could be lowered, but you can clearly see the focus on customer service.  Breakfast was very good, but they could have varied the selection slightly per day, especially when you are there for several days.  There was also one day when they did not have orange juice, which really is a major staple of breakfast.  We had an issue with one waitress, and when we spoke to the manager, he said he would address it immediately.  Overall, this hotel is a very good hotel, very service oriented, and in a good location.  It is outside of the city, but is quite accessible via taxi or bus.  I would rate it a 4 out of 5 because it is a smaller Hilton Hotel, not having the executive lounge the other Hilton Hotels in Paris or Amsterdam have, nor the quantity of restaurants and other facilities of their sister hotels.  They can however compete in the quality of service and attention to detail!",4,2015,11,10
240,Building site,"I am afraid that you are going to get no sleep, if, like me, your are given a room that faces the roadworks going on directly outside the hotel. These works have been going on for, at least, the past 3 months with no sign of them finishing any time soon. Whilst this is not the fault of the hotel, it is also not the fault of the guest. Upon ringing the Front Desk, I was told at 22:45 that they would be stopping at 23:00 and was then told at 01:45 that they would be stopping at 02:00. They have just stopped (02:15) and i am now left with the gentle, industrial hum of the power generator. I am told there are no rooms on the opposite side of the hotel for me to use and that the hotel is fully booked. This is one very sleepless night!",1,2015,11,09
240,Shambles!,"To cut a long story short, we stayed at this hotel when visiting Dublin for the weekend for a friends birthday. One the Saturday after being out all day we realised our personal items had been thrown away by house keeping!!!!! Not only did I feel violated the fact that the house keeping had touched my underwear, yes my UNDERWEAR!!! She had also thrown away items I use for my makeup, being 24yr old girls away for the weekend it's a huge inconvenience and it's not easy to go to a shop to find what you need and after all why should I? I could understand if the items were thrown everywhere but they were in a neat pile. We also realised
housekeeping had also touched and moved our toothbrushes!
When I noticed this I rang down to reception, I initially was told by the receptionist that they would ring back to see if they had a replacement for my items that were thrown away, I waited 15 minutes and there was no call back, so I rang again to be told reception was busy (which it wasn't) and there was no replacement but she would pass this on to the manager that was there in the morning. Obviously that was no good to me & (I'm getting further agitated at this point) I said I wanted to speak with a manager now, low and behold there was a manager on duty but I
had to speak with them, the manager came to my room, apologised, went out to replace the items the house keeping had thrown away and took my contact details. 10 minutes later I had what I needed in which I was thankful for, but by this time it was nearly 22.30pm and I was unable to get ready meaning most of the evening (my friends birthday) was spent stressing about what the housekeeping had thrown. 
The manager had promised me that she would call me with an update after she had spoken with house keeping but I've not received one and don't think I will!! 
Overall the hotel is nice, but lock away your personal items before letting house keeping come in, you never know what they will start touching!! 

 

underwear!!! ",1,2015,11,09
240,pleasant stay,"A very welcoming and accommodating hotel. the staff were very flexible in their  service. The breakfast was very adequate. the room was very nice and very well laid out.

240,Group booking ,I stayed in this hotel as part of a group booking at the end of October. Everything about the hotel was great! The staff were so friendly and helpful and the hotel itself is lovely and in a nice location! The rooms are spacious and nicely decorated as are the reception and bar areas. Will definitely stay again.,5,2015,11,08
240,Great location. Great bar food. Breakfast ok. Staff superb.,"Stayed recently at the Hilton for three nights while on business in Dublin. Large comfortable rooms with all you need, Wi-Fi is ok. Great location, pity about the road works, seems to be going on forever. Great bar food, had evening meals in the bar three nights in a row, super steaks, stick with the skinny chips, try the Thai green curry. Hot breakfast ok, wouldn‚Äôt be mad about the hot breakfast but couldn‚Äôt fault everything else. 
Staff superb, from reception to bar staff always cheerful and smiling.

240,30 mins from airport - but walking distance to local attractions.,"The hotel itself was very comfortable - clean and spacious rooms, professional and very helpful staff... all that we have come to expect with any Hilton!!  

Unfortunately, there is major construction on the road just in front of the hotel, and though there was absolutely no issue with noise, it made for some tricky detours for walking and driving.

This property is in walking distance of Kilmainham Gaol and the Guiness Brewery, so well situated for us.  The food options were more limited in the area than expected, but we chose not to eat at the hotel on our own - no doubt the food would have been  very good there.

Overall, a great spot for us to access attractions we were interested in and a reasonable spot to get to the airport in the morning for our flight out.",4,2015,10,31
240,not bad at all,"decent hotel if you can get it at the right price...dinner was ok and breakfast was fine...service was good and room was clean with comfy bed. There was a sauna steam room, Jacuzzi and small pool which was a bonus. Some road-works taking place at front but who cares....this is an inner city hotel next to a busy road?? 

AYE; Close to Kilmainham Gaol, Dublin Zoo and Phoenix Park

NAY: Had to pay for parking",4,2015,10,29
240,"If you want a hassle free entrance, lovely views and a peaceful night, don't book this hotel.","I arrived after 2pm to a building site in front of the hotel with limited constuction site entries to the property (a construction worker had to show mhy cabbie where I could enter beyond the fencing). It's now 19h40 and I after two long haul flights and ahead of an all day conference tomorrow, I am listening to perpetual, loud banging. I called the front desk, they said it's coming from the gym and it will stop at 8pm. 

It's alot later than 8pm on my body clock but I will not get a sound night's rest at this hotel.",2,2015,10,28
240,Wonderful food and rooms,"We stayed one night before our flight from Dublin.  The room was comfortable, location perfect from Heuston Train Station, front desk staff was extremely helpful.  Bar food was amazing and wait staff excellent.  But one note-- no vending or ice machines in hotel.  If you go to bar, not all staff is pleasant when trying to get ice or soda.  And expect to pay top ""Euro"" for tiny soda.",5,2015,10,28
240,Excellent and friendly staff,The spanish waiter who served us was very friendly and professional. He provided us with excellent customer service. He was very approachable and kept the smile on all the time. I really recommend the restaurant.,5,2015,10,27
240,UFC Dublin,"Very nice hotel, clean, rooms were massive and the breakfast is spot on.  Not the best location as its a little out of way, we generally got a taxi away from and then back to the hotel.  Its about 10 mins walk to the nearest Luas tram station.  If you stay here make sure you do the tour of Kilmainham Gaol just over the road, it was great.",4,2015,10,26
240,"Very Comfortable Beds, Nice Staff, Good Restaurant","We stayed in a 3 person room with a king bed and a single bed, and suprise! we still had room to keep our suitcases open and still move around comfortably. The beds were very comfortable. Our view was a castle turret and the Kilmainham jail..nice!! They are re-doing the Jail entrance so there was construction across the entire front of the hotel. But, we were gone all day, so the noise wasn't an issue, and it was easy to shimmy through the construction to grab a cab or get on the bus. We thought the food was really good at the bar and restaurant... grass-fed steaks etc. And we found the staff to be really nice and helpful. They gave us tips about Dublin and told us funny stories. We had read that the locals go to the bar in the restaurant, and we found that to be true. It is on the outskirts of town, so be prepared to quickly figure out the transit system, buy a ticket & wait for the on off buses, or do as we did and take a cab to and from town. We also took a horse and carriage ride from downtown to our hotel one nice afternoon and that was really fun!. We thought our hotel would be too far away for the horse, but he took all these little side streets that were soo cute!!
It's possible to walk from Guiness to the hotel, if u have a good map and 20-30 minutes. 

Also, we had emailed the hotel a list of special requests, (extra towels, conditioner etc) and they were all fulfilled without having to ask. yeah!",5,2015,10,26
240,Kilmainham Hilton,"Service was quick, prompt and efficient - the Irish are very friendly you know! The hotel room, although a slightly obstructed view was large, clean and comfortable - the rooms were cleaned and bed made after a very early morning breakfast. Location is quiet, yet close enough to stroll to sights and POI. The front of the hotel, is shadowed by the Kilmainham Prison - is a tourist sight, yet it's their front patio lounge where you sit in the sun, peiople watch, eat lunch or have a drink. Great place!",4,2015,10,26
240,Hilton Kilmainham,"Great hotel, unfortunately there is road works outside the hotel that will disturb you from really relaxing in the room. Other than this the staff were fantastic and food was excellent. Once the road works disappears it willl become much better",4,2015,10,26
240,Very nice stay and location ,"The Hilton Dublin kilmainham was a pleasant surprise.  They provide parking for in house guest @ ‚Ç¨12 per night, you just have to validate ticket at front desk.  There was construction oust the front but it did not take away from the good look of the hotel.  It's across from an historic jail house and museum operated by Guinness.  At check in I was welc9me by Natalia wo was very nice and informative.  After getting our rooms situated she took the time to point out places of interest on a local map and recommended some cool places to visit.  She was a breathe of fresh air. The rooms were very spacious with all the necessary amenities. You may need a step stool to get in the shower tho.  The rooms are very clean and ceiling  to floor windows.  It's by a main road but you would never know, there was no noise from the outside.  The bar was very nice and the bartender Michael  (polish guy) was very amazing !! He made some awesome drinks for my cousins to try and they were all good and he recommended a great restaurant for my cousin and his wife for dinner and they loved it very much.  He was just awesome and amazing.  He made us feel welcome and he took care of all his customers like we were all vip. The restaurant for dinner was busy we had to go outside to another restaurant for dinner so I could not comment on the dinner.  Breakfast was good and had a wide variety to chose from. I had a great dinner recommendation from the front desk agent from Moldova  (??) I forgot her name but she was great also and he Indian coworker.  They just made me loved the hotel even more with such great welcoming people. If I'm in Dublin I will stay there again for sure.  There is a bus right around the corner that take you to everything  withing 30 min. I loved it.
Thank you Hilton Dublin kilmainham! !",4,2015,10,25
240,Nice hotel,"Nice hotel in a nice neighborhood in Dublin.  Rooms were comfortable and would have been good for sleeping if it were not for work on the road using jackhammers and other loud equipment until 11 PM.  If work is still in progress if you go there, please ask for a room on the quiet side of the hotel.  Other than that the hotel was very good, lots of amenities and not far from the train station.  I would recommend this hotel.",5,2015,10,24
240,Dublin Vacation October 2015,"Visited Dublin 10/9-10/20 with my family.  Hotel experience was great.  Safe area, friendly staff, clean comfortable rooms, and good food.  its only a 15E cab ride to city center and quiet at night.  The only reason that I did not rate as Excellent was due to the construction that is going on in front of the hotel.
Concierge service was great, they helped plan all tours and booked the trips.  Natasha and Siji were very helpful and really made a difference in our visit, they did an excellent job!",4,2015,10,23
240,Good time,"A very nice and comfortable place where you can enjoy your stay in Dublin. The bar is a great option to relax and get a couple of drinks. The staff is very friendly and helpful!
Special mention to Jos√© the waiter. Very thoughtful and also recommended us some very nice places In Dublin which were great suggestions. 
We had a good time!",4,2015,10,22
240,Short Break,"Stayed at the Hilton in Kilmainham as a birthday treat. Got a great deal when booking and subsequently was sent an email with an option to upgrade the room for ‚Ç¨11 - and if selected, we would find out on arrival whether the upgrade was available. Was very pleasantly surprised when we arrived and were greeted by a very friendly receptionist, that not only had we received the upgrade but we were also being comped an additional upgrade to a Junior Suite. The room was fabulous of course! Ate in the bar for dinner - meal was very tasty although felt the choices on the menu weren't great. All staff were very friendly. Didn't make it to breakfast so can't comment on that!",5,2015,10,21
240,when irish eyes are smiling,"We just got back from Ireland and spent 5 great nights at the Hilton .. from the friendly front desk, to the Irish breakfast, to the awesome big  bed, wonderful big screen TV, to the super shower it was all awesome.. was a little worried it was so far from downtown but that also was a plus .. great location for some great tourist spots. definitely loved our stay, we will return .. Bill",5,2015,10,19
240,Comfortable room,"Stayed for 1 night mid-week on a business trip. Check-in and checkout were efficient, with friendly staff.
My room was very comfortable and clean - plenty of room, no issues there and I had good nights sleep.
I had a light breakfast, the food was fine but the tea was awful.
I ate in the bar at evening time - nothing special, expected better.
Avoid the ""lemon meringue pie"".

I would stay here again due to the comfortable rooms but would probably eat elsewhere.
",3,2015,10,19
240,So Comfortable,"Our stay in Dublin was located not right downtown but pretty close to the pleasant Phoenix Park.
We found the Hilton Dublin Kilmainham more than meeting our expectations. Although not really walkable to & from downtown Dublin, there are shops around and a laundry establishment within two blocks (comes in handy when traveling out of a suitcase for fourteen days). 
The bedding was really comfortable. The room set up pretty nice and was pretty good size. I use a c-pap and could not find electrical outlet close enough, so room service provided an extension cord. They even will give you an adaptor to use if you need one for your US voltage appliances/apparatuses. Bathroom counters have plenty of room for toiletries. Shower pressure was adequate. They provide hair dryer which can only be used outside the bathroom. 
This Hilton has a very good pub & restaurant staffed by some very customer service focused individuals. . Our bartender from Poland spoke excellent English and he provided a ""special blend of Bailey's Irish Cream with an Italian liquor"" (very friendly, creative and intelligent).  Expect a very hardy breakfast at this establishment. 
As with all the other hotels we stayed at for our tour of Ireland, free wi-fi in room & lobby.
Found the pool, jacuzzi and steam room(s) very relaxing. Note, you need to wear a bathing cap in the swimming pool; they have available for a two bucks (you keep). 
Again, a couple of standard criteria I use is water shower pressure and bedding; shower pressure was adequate and the bedding was ""so comfortable"".",4,2015,10,18
240,Well appointed hotel,"Stayed one night on my own in the Kilmainham Hilton. It was clean, well appointed, and the bed comfortable. 
I really enjoyed the hydro therapy pool and steam room. If I had not lost my shoes I would have worked out at the fabulous on site gym. 
The location is not the greatest in terms of going out at night, especially as a solo woman. On the other hand the short walk to the Heuston train station was convenient in the morning. ",4,2015,10,18
240,Wonderful hotel,"I stayed here early in October overnight with my husband. This hotel is absolutely fantastic and I would recommend it to anyone. It is only a few minutes walk from Heuston station, and very easy to access the city centre as the Luas line is at the station.The room was excellent , the bed was one of the best I ever slept in. 
We had dinner at the hotel and was served by Asif who was more than accommodating .
Thank you Asif.
I didn't get a chance to use the leisure centre as we only stayed one night.I would recommend this  hotel highly.",5,2015,10,18
240,Great Hotel,"Excellent Hotel, clean and comfortable rooms. Never heard a noise from outside all the time I was there, though you have to pay for parking I was aware of this at the time of booking. Next to Kilmainham gaol and The Guinness Storehouse is a short distance away.",5,2015,10,14
240,Business stay hotel,"Nice hotel, good large clean room with comfortable bed. Breakfast good. Friendly helpful staff. Good location for city. Can't comment on spa as didn't have time to go. Access currently difficult due to roadworks outside but couldn't hear them from inside.
",5,2015,10,14
240,Family for a week in Dublin,"We over here for a week catching up with family and doing the tourist routine, the location of the hotel in my opinion is great with easy access to town by public transport, the red tourist bus or car. The hotel is across the road from old Kilmainhaim jail and the war memorial gardens, as well as Phoenix park.
The team at the hotel where great with us , polite, courteous and no issues ( we needed to go to Kilkenny for a wedding so had to check out and then check back in a day or so later and they stored all our bags etc). Breakfast is good and suggest you have at the hotel ( the black and white pudding could be better)  good selection of continental and hot - lovely fresh salmon. The gym is good and is also a health club for members which offered a little more than normal hotel gyms. Loved it and would stay again",4,2015,10,13
240,Great stay ,"Booked this hotel for a weekend break for me & my girlfriend to celebrate her birthday. We arrived very early expecting to just be leaving our bags and heading down into the city as check in wasn't until 3pm. We were pleasantly surprised that we were able to check in straight away. The hotel itself is in an ideal location for exploring Dublin as its right across from the old kilmainham gaol & the museum of modern art, is a short walk away from Phoenix park & a 10 min bus journey into the city centre. The room was very spacious with an extremely comfy bed, the only bad thing I can say is that the hot water wasn't very hot. Breakfast in the hotel was excellent with a good choice of foods and we also had dinner one evening too which was very good and very reasonably priced. All in all a pleasant stay at this hotel !!  ",5,2015,10,12
240,Hilton For Excellence,If you are thinking about visiting Dublin please consider the Hilton for Excellence. A Quiet setting which is appreciated after a busy day. Relaxing bar with wonderful food in the restaurant. The staff are very friendly and make you feel most welcome.,5,2015,10,12
240,Weekend in Dublin,"Stayed in the Hilton Kilmainham for two nights in August. Hotel room was excellent and clean. The hotel was full. The Ironman competition took place outside the hotel on the Sunday morning and Ana (Receptionist) informed us of the best way out of the city to avoid their route. Breakfast was great, with plenty of choice, has to wait for a table to be cleared, but very quickly. Only issue we had was leaving the hotel early in the morning, from the
underground car park, machine was broken and took 15 mins to sort out, very minor overall. Excellent stay and will return.
",5,2015,10,11
240,Best part of Dublin,"My husband and I really enjoyed our stay at this Hilton. We were very unimpressed with Dublin as a city, but coming back to this hotel in the evening was very relaxing. There is a city tour bus that stops across the street at the old jail and makes stops at all the necessary places (Guinness, Temple bar, Trinity college...ect). We ate both of our dinners at the hotel bar and found the staff to be friendly and well trained. The food was excellent and the atmosphere inviting. The room was very spacious,  nicely updated and very clean. The bathroom was bright and had a large tub/shower. Again, nicely updated. The ladies at the front desk were able to answer any odd questions we had and helped us get a taxi to our rental car place early in the morning. Yes, there is road construction happening outside of the hotel, but it isn't that bad and it is what it is. You aren't in the city center, but I think that is what we liked. The breakfast did seem over priced to us, but just next door is a sweet little cafe with a great breakfast, baked goods and coffee available. Thank you for such a great stay!",5,2015,10,08
240,excellent hotel experience,lovely staff and great customer experience overall. The location is slightly outside the city centre but there are plenty of local taxis and public transport. The breakfast was excellent and the room was wonderful,5,2015,10,07
240,Very Friendly,They are very friendly and accommodating. We arrived with our backpacks in the morning and they got us coffee and held our bags until we could check in.The hotel is clean. Walking distance from the train station and easy walk to the bus stop.,4,2015,10,06
240,nice break in Dublin. Good hotel just a bit far out of the city.,"we stayed at this hotel as a Hilton Honours treat . it was good value and very well equipped , the rooms are lovely and very quiet. the breakfast was also very good. I found the staff a little abrupt by Hilton standards and a few waiting  staff seemed to lack some basic training . but on the whole a good stay, convenient for the lovely art museum over the road and the Gaol ( if you like this), I would have preferred to be closer to the city centre for a short city break .",4,2015,10,05
240,Good experience ,"Meet Sorin few times at bar and breakfast, he always serve with good smile and great attitude, really a good staff here !! 
Also Cristina from reception, met her at first day I check in, she somehow know my name when I arrived, also her smile and great attitude made me feel this is my second home!! So glad I choose here for my business trip. ",5,2015,10,04
240,They wont accept my two service dogs !!!!,"I have stayed at this hotel before. So I have an expo to go to with registered therapy dogs. I rang this hotel only to be told no pets. I explained they are service dogs and the receptionist just kept saying guide dogs only. i gave her my num and ask her to ask manager. I got a voice message this morning just saying No we only will accept guide dogs.
I in the meantime found out that another Hilton in same city not far does indeed accept dogs. 
Why did the Hilton Kilmainham not reccomend  this to me.
I find it so hard to stay with my two dogs a lot of hotel say Pet friendly but will only accept one pet.
Therapy dogs are under the same umbrella of 
Dogs for the disabled
Dogs for Autisim
Dogs for the deaf
So If you have a service dog of any of the above it seems to be Hilton Kilmainham will not accept it as its not a guide dog for the blind.
I am angry at this.
The Dylan will welcome my two service dogs.
The hilton in Charlemount place will accept one dog but will make an exception but unfortunatly a ‚Ç¨40 deep clean fee. That I can understand even although it seems alot of money for an extra 20 mins tops of cleaning, but I accept that.
If any hotel manager read this please look at reviewing your practice and educate yourself and watch a you tube video called ""moments with Baxter "". its a little extreme. But my point is Temple street nursing homes other long stay hospitals encourage therapy dogs and we go into the most cleanest places to bring a little bitt of joy for someones mother father sister or child. We are volounters and for our dogs not to be welcome in a hotel room is unbelievable...
I will never return to this hotel. I think last time I visited this hotel I gave it a very good review except we had windows that didnt ope and the aircon was not effective at all.

Shame on you Hilton Hotel Kilmainham Management",2,2015,10,04
240,Great Hotel with helpful staff,"This Hilton is located within 100 meters of the Kilmainham Gaol, where the Hop On/Hop Off buses stop. That alone is a great deal but the hotel facilities are also wonderful. The staff was very helpful & offered good recommendations. The fitness center is very nice & we were pleasantly surprised with group classes. The Patriot Inn is on the opposite corner & offers a great Irish pub experience.",5,2015,10,04
240,Great relaxing hotel,"We were satisfied with this hotel, I liked pillow and bed so my sleeping was perfect. Breakfast was little poor. Biggest problem was in wellness - cloakroom was messy as hell and in showers was missing soap in two cabins, also too much of chlorine in the pool! In this kind of hotel it is really shame. Btw, I really loved the sweet petite girl in reception, she was so kind and so beautiful! :)",4,2015,10,04
240,great stuff,"really great stay lovely hotel would stay again the breakfast and dinner were very nice and would recommend to friends.location is great for sight seeing, hop on bus right across road.rooms very clean",5,2015,10,01
240,"Very Nice Room, Just Outside of Downtown Area","The hotel is located about 15 minutes on the train/trolley from downtown.  This is reflected in the lower price than the central ones, which is good.  The Rooms were very nice, especially the bed which was amazing.  Staff at the front desk were super friendly and helpful.  Nice gym and spa facilities downstairs.  Nice pub located across the street!",5,2015,09,30
240,Standard hotel,"Stayed here for two nights as the location suited us.
It was clean and well kept. 
We did encounter two problems, however. The air conditioning didn't work (it came on initially, and then died)
And the shower was ridiculously temperamental! The temperature just kept rapidly changing from freezing to boiling, not pleasant. 
We didn't eat at the restaurant so I cannot comment on that. 
However, do eat at La Dolce Vita restaurant if you stay here (it's across the street above the pub!)",3,2015,09,28
240,Appreciate a great hotel for our last night in Ireland,"This hotel offered comfortable, spacious rooms with all the amenities, including free wifi. They also had computers in the lobby which allowed us to print our boarding passes. One woman had difficulty and the staff at the reception desk helped her. We ate at the hotel restaurant for lunch and it was delicious with good service. The beds were very comfortable and windows did a great job blocking out sound inducing a good night's sleep.",5,2015,09,27
240,Multiple Stays in the Last Year,"I have stayed here multiple times on business the last year.  I like the hotel's location, and across the stree the Patriot's Inn Pub and Italian Restaurant above it.  This last stay was for 8-nights for a conference in the hotel; therefore, I did the pub, Italian Restaurant, restaurant, bar, room service, etc.  Across the street from the hotel are all three ""hop on - hop off"" bus stops for the Kilmainham Museums (prison and hospital). I was fortunate to have a refrigerator in the room for left overs.
The Good:  The room was clean, comfortable, and staff were great.  The morning breakfast was tasty.  The sandwiches during the meetings and the meals in the restaurant were good.  Room service and food is not available after 11pm.
The Not-So-Good:  The shower water temperature fluctuated between warm-cold-hot-warm along with pressure.  The internet was spotty and slow.  As more people got on the internet, the slower it was and in some cases the connection was dropped.  This has been something I have experienced for a year now. Temperature control in the meeting rooms was difficult and overall the rooms are small.

I will be back again and will most likely stay here.",4,2015,09,26
240,Away from the crowd,"We have stayed in this wonderful hotel on several occasions.  The staff is always friendly. This hotel is great if you want to be away from the crowd and don't mind a little work to get to the major tourist area. 

The neighborhood has good options for dinning and has a little market and drug store close by.

Our Hilton Honors level was different during some visits and you do notice a difference.",4,2015,09,23
240,Too much money for too less,"Short advice: don't stay here Unacceptable bad internet, unable to work from hotel as a business visitor. Shower doesn't deliver a steady temperature, cold, warm, hot, cold, warm, hot. Bad location in the ghetto of Dublin. Hotel restaurant: don't eat here.  Plusses: Hotel rooms are hygienic and look nice. Good bed. Nice desk and cleaning personnel.  If they fix all this hotel has potential to become a very good hotel at a bad location.",1,2015,09,23
240,"Good location, great sleep","Stayed here for 3 nights with children, had a great stay with the expecting of having to switch rod because air conditioning wasn't working. Hotel rooms are spacious, clean and very comfortable. Also nice and quiet in evenings.
Pool is great, kids loved going there as it had a couple waterfalls and was not too deep for them. This pool is more of a relax spa and not the best for doing laps if that's what your in to.
Staff was kind and tried to assist whenever possible.
Location is fairly quiet and outside the heart of dublin but not too far, your looking at 5-10 min cab to temple area. There arnt many places to eat I immediate vicinity either; Italian and pub grub across the street, and a nice cafe next store.
Phoenix park is located across street  as is Kilmainham gaol, and for a nice relaxing walk and Dublin zoo is just a bit further  the park, really nice visit for kids.
One note about room service, it was very expensive( even for room service standards) and not very good. One sandwich I ordered had 3 chunky fries with it that tasted old. Sandwiches weren't very good either.
Parking is located in basement and hotel will subsidize a portion of fee, I think it was ard 10‚Ç¨ a day.
Overall though this is a really nice hotel were u can get a decent night sleep and not be too far from Dublin heart",4,2015,09,22
240,Cold hot breakfasts,"Nice hotel, great staff but why are your 'hot' breakfasts always cold or at best lukewarm? Our junior suite upgrade was brilliant with its balcony, table and chairs and views and the room, furniture, bedlinen and bathroom were all excellent. Our own house is well appointed and it all made us feel really at home.",4,2015,09,21
240,Excellent food but poor service,"We are not the guests in the hotel. After had a wonderful tour in Kilmainham Gaol, we found this bar for our lunch. We ordered sandwich, salad and some drinks. The food was very good and delivered fast. But a bar person with red lipstick who served us was not very friendly. She shows impatient  and arrogant when we ask some questions about the menu and no smile at all during the service. 
The bar is well decorate and good atmosphere. But we were expecting a better customer service from Hilton.",3,2015,09,19
240,Not the usual Hilton standard...,"A typically comfortable European Hilton with a friendly welcome, lots of space, a great king-size bed and decent bathroom. However, this Hilton disappointed due to a failure to attend to the little things. The safe didn't work (flat battery?), the basin and bath plug holes were caked with hair and grime, the fridge was turned off, and the stainless steel servers at breakfast need replacing. We also struggled with the aircon but that might have just been us.

Come on Kilmainham - your colleagues at the Dublin Doubletree by Hilton at the other end of town got a ""5"" rating when we stayed there a week ago.",3,2015,09,18
240,Relaxing Stay,"I really like this hotel for it's affordability within the city of Dublin and also their beds are so comfortable! The front desk person was very helpful in telling us the specific bus routes we need to take to get to a specific destination. The room service food is nothing to brag about (pretty basic) but needless to say it was still decent. Breakfast was delicious and a lot of variety to choose from. 

We enjoyed the pool / jacuzzi there (it was really nice and relaxing). Downside was that there was so much construction by the hotel it really diminished it's beauty on the outside. Room was clean, although our view outside wasn't anything to brag about (could see trash bins and another building).

Overall, this is a good hotel that is within budget and decent location and right next to the Kilmainham Gaol which was interesting to tour.",5,2015,09,17
240,Tourist traveler,"Fantastic three night stay here. The front desk staff were so helpful. Rooms were very nice and the hot tub/spa/sauna/steam room is quite a treat! Highly recommend this hotel. It's about fifteen to twenty minute taxi to O'Connell street or temple bar and the front desk will call one for you. Or Heuston bus station is a fifteen minute walk. The hop on hop off buses stop right outside as well since the Kilmainham Gaol is across the street. Breakfast was also fantastic with all the requirements for a true Irish breakfast. There is a bar downstairs, but also a traditional pub across the street that will likely have live music on the weekend. I enjoyed jazz music there myself. Great stay all ways around. I was afraid is be too far from the city but it turned out being a great spot. ",5,2015,09,15
240,West of City but on HOHO route for Kilmainham Gaol,"Smart hotel, somewhat spoiled by roadworks, but has this in common with most of Dublin atm. Room was clean and everything changed daily. Hotel had good facilities, Wifi and use of PC and printer in lobby. Never ate there as breakfast cheaper and better (I suspect) at local Lime Tree cafe. Bar was standard big hotel, good hours, good range of beers except pump had stopped when we tried to get served so on bottled beer/cider.Luggage stored and room ready early. Price for a triple for 3 nights about ¬£270 per night",4,2015,09,14
240,Good location for exploring Dublin City,"I stayed with my girlfriend. Our room was lovely. Very modern and clean.
Staff were friendly. Overall it was good service.
The hotel is not far from Dublin Zoo which was a big plus for us. It`s also very near to Kilmainham Gaol. If you havn`t visited the jail yet I would highly recommend it if you have an interest in Irish history.",5,2015,09,11
240,"No Problems at All, Delightful Stay","We had a wonderful 4 night stay at this hotel in late August.  Since it was our anniversary, I had requested an upgrade to a balcony room.  We were extremely pleased to get a great room with a terrace on the 4th floor overlooking the forest across the street in the park and the Wellington obelisk.  In addition, we found a special ""Happy Anniversary"" plate with fruit and gateaux and a nice card from the management in our room when we came back from sightseeing the second day - delightful (see picture).  The front desk staff, all the various ones, were extremely friendly and helpful with our many questions and requests.  Couldn't have been better.

By way of advice I would try to avoid getting a room on the lower floors on the east side because there appears to be a metal architectural screen in front of all the windows.  I would imagine it gives a feeling of being across the street in the jail.

I would agree to a certain extent with some of the recent reviews complaining about the breakfast staff.  There are some Eastern European girls working there SOME of which don't appear to be very happy with their lives.  Others were perfectly nice. I thought the breakfast buffet was very good.  It had all the full Irish breakfast basics, including beans and black pudding, plus meats, cheeses, pastries.  What else would you want?

As for the bar staff, they never heard of a ""split"" of champagne.  No such thing.

We knew going in that the hotel location is some distance from the city center, necessitating the use of somewhat expensive taxis to get anywhere except Kilmainham Gaol.  It should be the guest's responsibility to understand that ahead of time and plan accordingly - or stay somewhere else.  We stayed because we always stay at Hiltons and this one is on the hop on hop off line with a stop across the street, as opposed to the other Hilton, which is marginally closer to the center but off the route.

The construction in front of the hotel is to build a nice plaza in front of the jail for the upcoming 100th anniversary of the 1916 rising.  It doesn't look anywhere close to completion.  It's unsightly but not a real problem.

All in all we had a great stay, which came as a slight surprise, since we had lowered expectations based on the generally unflattering Tripadvisor reviews that we read prior to our departure.  I would stay there again.",5,2015,09,11
240,O.m.g,Great receptionist. Polite friendly and efficient. They need to train the bar staff. Especially when they make a point of arguing with you after they dont listen. Appalling bar service whether busy or quiet.,2,2015,09,09
240,An Irish gem....,"A bit out of the way but a wonderful hotel anyway. It is across from the famous Kilmainham Prison, a must see for any Dublin traveler. The service was great, the staff very well trained and polite and I loved the bar. It seemed to attract locals, which is always a good sigh. Hate to go to hotel bar full of hotel guests only. There were a few authentic Irish pubs in the area but then again, Trinity is a 15 minute cab ride and you can't beat Trinity for the pubs, restaurants and just plain fun. You'll like this place, quiet, clean and good bargain.",4,2015,09,08
240,Honeymoon night ,"On a roadtrip of Ireland we booked into the hilton for night one. An exceptionally warm welcome, very kind and helpful reception staff who helped us plan a few things.
Loved the card and goftwhen we came back in the evening. Super brekkietoo.
Thanks",5,2015,09,08
240,"Not in central Dublin, but lacking in Customer Service","I just arrived from Hilton Bosphorus Istanbul to this Hilton hotel where I had booked a 5th floor room with ""expansive views"" and was given a 4th floor dark room overlooking massive trees.  There's disco lights that go on at night and even the black-out curtains don't prevent the neon lights coming through the edges.  This hotel is more like a converted dorm room; the big screen tv hides the computer desk area; almost like they had no place to put a large screen, so let's put it on this table and take away any table space.  No offer to re-imburse for the 5th floor room, which does cost extra compared to the other rooms.  Will take this up when I return home.  There's construction taking place and no one to assist with bags/suitcases.  Oh and good luck with downloading boarding passes; they'll give you the mouse to operate the computer, but even staff member had problems connecting it to get to web-site.  There's no executive level either.  Breakfast & the pools were the only bright spots at this hotel.
Kate, a little PR goes a long way when your staff messes up the reservations, comp a meal or something to make it right.",2,2015,09,06
240,Great Location!,"Across from one of Dublin's most notable tourist sites, The Kilmainham Jail, this hotel is a great spot to tour from while staying in Dublin.  Hilton's exceptional service, consistent quality, and ongoing commitment to excellence, as well as its location on the Tour bus route, makes it perfect for those exploring the city.  The spa area in the lower part of the hotel is beautiful---and a great reprieve after a long day on your feet.  There is a restaurant on-site...but a GREAT little breakfast cafe a half of a block from the hotel---and a FABULOUS Italian restaurant the other direction half a block.  Head upstairs for the food, downstairs for drinks.  ",4,2015,09,06
240,Rude breakfast staff,"Booked two rooms for my partner and I and my kids. Specified that I needed them beside each other but they weren't. I reckoned it was more hassle than it was worth to go back down to reception and start the process of moving so I just let it go. Rooms were lovely and clean, no complaints there at all. We went down for a drink in the evening after going to the spa (which was very nice) but the seats and tables outside which we had hoped to sit at were gone. Spoke to a couple of women outside who had come out for a smoke and they too were annoyed that there was nowhere to sit. Didn't bother staying at the bar as planned because there was zero atmosphere and nowhere to sit outside, so we went to the local shop and bought our own wine and drank it in the room. The following morning is where my real annoyance kicked in. Breakfast was served until 10 am and we got there at 6 minutes to. Well, by the reaction of the breakfast staff you thought we were holding them back from their own wedding! Unbelievableably rude. When I asked for a table, the girl sighed, told us that breakfast was almost over and sat us at an empty unset table...right next to a set table...which she proceeded to move the settings from and put on ours!!? I can only presume it was because she wanted to piss us off by putting us at a seriously wobbly table which was so rickety that every time we tried to cut our food, the whole thing shook! Now I know I could have asked to be moved but the girls had faces on them like thunder and I didn't want to lose my patience if they'd been rude again so we just sat there...while they cleaned up around us and made us really uncomfortable. We ended up rushing our breakfast in order to get out of there. Are they only paid until 10 am or something?  (I must say there was one girl in particular, wish I'd got her name) So much for a four star hotel breakfast...half the food had been taken out to the kitchens (although one girl did offer to bring back the yogurt and fruit). We ate in silence and while I was seething, my kids thought it was hilarious that the table was so wobbly. The girl knew our table was like that because she could hear me mention it and the kids sniggering! Was so uncomfortable, annoyed and rushed that we only ate half of a cooked breakfast (which was our only option by the way, I prefer a continental) I was in several hotels over the summer on short stays and I've never had this problem before. If they serve to ten then they should have all the food available until ten...and train their staff to be polite and smile! I paid for a breakfast, it should have been available...with a bloody smile. And to think I apologised to her for coming down to breakfast so close to ten! Won't be staying or recommending this place to anyone.",2,2015,09,05
240,good hotel in good location,2nd time we have stayed in this hotel and is very clean good friendly staff and handy parking - only complaint would be that I feel guests should have free parking very clean and well designed and a good base to see the city,5,2015,09,02
240,Comfortable for business,"The room was comfortable and modern and the bed was great. Food choices at the bar was limited and tasted ok. Service was efficient but not warm; I didn't get the sense that anyone would strive to meet my needs, although I didn't ask for anything extra. I used the pool room once, as I felt the jacuzzi and sauna were quite small, and so were uncomfortable to share with strangers, and a large part of the (small) pool was cordoned off. The location was great for me as I needed to be near the train station and St Jame's hospital.",4,2015,09,01
240,A lstminute overnight,"As a last minute overnight was needed for a trip to Dublin for special dinner, I used all the usual websites. I found an excellent price for the Hilton on Lidl of all places, but decided to ring the hotel directly as they have a 'price match gurantee', they couldn't/ wouldn't match the price so had to book it via Lidl, very very weird customer practice. The room was clean and bright and well maintained. The breakfast was a touch disorganised they managed to take away all our breakfast coffee and tea,while we were quueing for hot food! The food was of a decent standard but not overly hot. A pretty good choice overall for Dublin an easy walk into town from there too, just make sure you don't overpay on their own website!",4,2015,09,01
240,chris and girls',hi just stayed for three nights; with an early arrival with two children received warm welcome with time to sample breakfast with help from reception. .its an ideal place  or base for Dublin zoo and phoenix park and of course the geol  at kilmainham  and Guinness stone house and trips around the city and the Viking splash tour was great and free entry in to national  history museum.the hotel is of good standard of what you would expect from this well known chain . a la carte in the restaurant with    good service. local pub across road the patriot for a different way to meet the locals and sample local beers,5,2015,08,31
240,Just perfect,"A lovely surprise on arrival as shown in picture.  Service,  rooms,  food everything was first class. Would highly recommend.  We had room 532 which was beautiful with great view over Dublin. The bar staff in the Four corners were very friendly especially a Spanish fella, he was such a nice guy.  ",5,2015,08,31
240,"Beware of room ""upgrade"" for view","Great hotel, but I paid extra for a room with a view. Instead, I got a second-story view of a street corner with a huge construction site below. Addressed this to management and extra fee was not reimbursed. Very disappointed.",4,2015,08,28
240,Great Dublin Location,This is a terrific property sited in a convenient location for exploring the attractions of Dublin.  Rooms are spacious and impressively clean.  We received a complimentary upgrade and our room had an outdoor terrace and an office area. Secure parking underneath the property was well priced at 12 Euros for a 24 hour stay.  The only minor gripe (and it was very minor gripe) that we had concerned the breakfast seating arrangements with staff appearing to be extremely organised.  Breakfast was self service and catered for all tastes. Our stay included complimentary access to the gym and spa but we were unable to take advantage of this facility due to other commitments. This hotel is highly recommended.,4,2015,08,28
240,Comfy short stay in Dublin,"Very nice hotel with bar and restaurant on-site. Comfy and clean, bathroom was excellent. Right across the street from the fascinating Kilmainham Gaol and bus stops (including the hop-on, hop-off tour which was GREAT). Taxis accessible right outside as well. Staff kind, professional and helpful. Allowed us to leave our bags until check-in time so we could explore the area. If you stay here, visit the charming La Dolce Vita Italian restaurant just down the block, situated above the lively Patriot's Inn that offers  jovial fun in the evenings! Staff ordered up our taxi to get back to the airport on our final day and check-out was quick and easy. I'll stay here again!",4,2015,08,25
240,Greatest Team Member ever met.,"I stayed at your hotel on the 18th and 21st August. 
I have stayed at various hilton hotels and I have enjoyed good services but
I got a world class service and the greatest service delivery ever from one of your team member Ms Stacey Warren of the front desk.  She has solutions to all my queries and met all my need at the right time. I am always delighted at the way she attended to guests need. She is a great asset to your property and I will definitely return. Please pass my sincere appreciation to her. I am most greatfull.",5,2015,08,24
240,Feeling Relaxed!!!,Spent 2 great days & nights in the Hilton Kilmainham. The staff were really friendly & helpful and the food was lovely. We had a couple of drinks in the hotel bar on our last night & we were served by a lovely gentleman from Poland who was a pleasure to talk to. Can highly recommend the hydrotherapy pool & hot tub - both fabulous!!!! Would definitely stay in this hotel again.,5,2015,08,24
240,Wow! Amazing customer service! ,"We visited to celebrate our friend's 40th Birthday and the hotel made our visit special from the birthday cake in the room at the start to another cake at our evening meal everything was perfect!
Special mention to our waiter Raja in the restaurant who was so friendly and attentive. The food was awesome both evenings and the pancakes at breakfast were a real treat! 
Reception staff were friendly and helpful. One even brought us a roll of sticky tape to the room. Nothing was too much trouble.
The only downside was the roadworks which is obviously out of the hotel's control. ",5,2015,08,22
240,Hilton Standard!,"Stayed here for 3 nights at the end of July. Very welcoming staff on reception, both checking in and out, keeping bags for us while our room was readied; our room was very good indeed, with a very comfortable bed, good shower and decent sized bath towels!. The Hotel is well placed a bit out of the centre but staff helped us find the best bus routes in to town, which took only a matter of minutes. We did not eat in the hotel, so I cannot comment on that,but in everything else it hit the spot. I would use it again.",5,2015,08,21
240,Very poor for a Hilton,"I stayed here for 2 nights. It's not the nicest Hilton. The bar seats are a bit stained as are the restaurant/breakfast room seats. Apart from one person the staff aren't particularly warm or welcoming, overall they seemed quite aloof, almost as if they're doing you a favour. 

We checked into a room overlooking a busy road. I went back down to reception and asked if they had a quieter room not overlooking the road. The woman on reception said no, that they were fully booked. As will become apparent below in my review this was a lie. The person that lied worked with Sarah-Rose on reception during the evenings - she was tall, long dark hair, glasses. I didn't catch her name.

The room itself was fine, seemed clean and the beds were comfortable. The bathroom floor seemed to have a few hairs that weren't ours but I couldn't be bothered kicking up a fuss. 

We ate at the hotel bar that night. I had fish and chips, which was fine apart from the chips were enormous wedges slightly undercooked, and the person staying with me had a burger. Including a small glass of wine and a pint of Guinness it came to over EUR 50 so not cheap as I rounded up to EUR 60 with a tip.

The bar/restaurant staff are ok. Not very fast or particularly friendly - some better than others. The restaurant manager did seem on the ball though and she directed a few staff over to us when she saw us waiting for attention.

That night at 2am or just after I was awoken by a noise. It was part of the ceiling falling in and water pouring through the ceiling. The electricals weren't working. I phoned reception. He didn't seem to grasp the situation at all. It was if I'd phoned him up to say the kettle wasn't working or some small annoyance. 15 minutes later sitting in the dark and no one had turned up I phoned again. The water was pouring in still and more of the ceiling was coming down. Eventually a member of staff came up and said guests above us had gone out leaving a tap running, here were two new key cards for another room, please go there. No help was given to moving us in the early hours of the morning. We fumbled about in the dark packing our bags by mobile phone light and in my nightie and slippers at 2.30am we went off to find our other room. 

As I got to this room it seemed the leak had made it's way down to this floor too as the hallway to the room opposite was sopping wet. I informed reception of this but he didn't seem too bothered.

At breakfast the next morning they didn't have our updated room number. Breakfast itself wasn't great. The toaster didn't work in that it didn't toast. I overheard another guest say she'd put a slice of bread through the machine 4 times but it was still not toasted. The choice wasn't great and I didn't find it appetising. We had to find a pot of tea ourselves as the waitress didn't come back.

We went out and came back about 6pm. No one had been in to clean the room at all. It was like we'd been moved and forgotten about. I phoned reception and spoke to the receptionist that had lied about being fully booked the first night. I asked her why she'd said it was full up and she couldn't move us but obviously they weren't full up as we'd had to move rooms in the night. She then lied again saying it must have been a no-show - I found out this was another lie the next day on check-out. I don't think she even apologised for the room not having been cleaned. At that point I couldn't be bothered complaining so left it and we didn't bother asking for cleaning and this receptionist never followed it up either.

Again we ate in the bar restaurant as we were too tired to go back into the centre to eat. I ordered the steak and Guiness pie and the other person staying with me ordered a chicken burger. My pie came and a normal hamburger. He couldn't be bothered saying the order was wrong so ate it. At first my pie seemed quite good but on closer inspection while there was meat in it there was absolutely no gravy at all and it was dry with a pastry lid. I ate two largish pieces of carrot, struggled to find the mushrooms that were listed on the description and when I lifted the pastry lid a bit more found 3 more huge pieces of carrot. One was about the quarter of the dish the pie was in - about 2 inches long and 1.5 inches wide - enormous for the dish it was in. I couldn't be bothered eating any more. The waiter took the plates without asking how was it or anything. Fed up with the whole trip by this point I couldn't be bothered saying anything. The pie is about EUR 17, not cheap when it's not very good. In fact I've cooked better pies at home myself. The pastry could have been cooked a bit longer as it wasn't golden or puffed up enough. 

We checked out about 10am the next day. For the first time I actually felt I had some proper customer service from the receptionist on duty - Ana. She was warm, friendly, sympathetic and said if we came back she'd do us a good deal as she immediately realised we were one of those affected by the leak. The first member of staff to actually properly apologise and try to make it up to us. Unfortunately, I won't be going back to Dublin any time soon so her offer was no good to me but at least she made it. 

In conversation she said about 5 rooms had to be moved in the night and the leak had got through to the ground floor. So it was clear to me that other receptionist had lied again and there had been a number of rooms she could have moved me to - at least 5. Very disappointing to be lied to in this way. 

I've stayed at a Hilton the past 3 trips I've made in the last year and have stayed about 10 times over the past 5 years or so but now I'm thinking next time perhaps not.

The leak was just one of those things but not one person contacted us the next day to see how we were or to apologise or indeed to offer us a drink on the house or dinner. We didn't get room service/cleaning the second day as we'd been forgotten about. It was only Ana, just as we were checking out, that actually showed some true hospitality. 

I think my allegiance to Hilton in recent years might just be broken next time I go away - not because of the leak but the lack of feeling that you're a valued guest.",1,2015,08,19
240,Excellent hotel in great location,"Stayed here over my birthday, tour bus stop immediately outside and the gaol directly across the street. Hotel was really clean and comfortable and the staff were very helpful and friendly. Use the tour bus hop on hop off to get into town and a taxi to get from temple bar back to hotel which costs about 11 euro when the bus stops. When I'm going back to Dublin I will probably stay here again if the price is right. Cheers Hilton!",5,2015,08,19
240,One night in Dublin,A functional choice for one night in Dublin prior to taking early morning train to Cork. Further out of city center than some may like but convenient for Heuston station and opposite a couple of tourist attractions plus a hop on hop off stop so you can easily make the location work if you get a good rate. Friendly reception staff gave warm welcome. Modern comfortable rooms and a great bed. Recommended!,5,2015,08,19
240,Hilton Kilmainham Dublin,"We stayed 5 nights at the Hilton Kilmainham Dublin hotel. We rated this average as some things were very good and some were poor. The beds were good and as was the HVAC. The shower was a different matter. There was only a glass partition that extended from the showerhead end of the tub 1/3rd of the length of the tub. Hence water splash would soak the floor. And the shower had a nasty habit of pulsing short bursts of scalding hot water before going back to the temperature of water we had selected. The tub itself was narrower than most I have been in and difficult to stand in, as well as slippery. There was no anti slip tub mat. I guess all tubs in the British Isles are set 6 inches above the bathroom floor. Makes it an adventure getting in and out of the tub.  The bar and restaurant were very good, though the service in the bar was slow at times. The food was always good.   The business center's computers had very strict protocols that prevented me from opening up my work computer's remote access program. The WiFi service worked well, but is an open system that anyone inside can access and you can't or shouldn't do any banking or financial work on a laptop or tablet in an open WiFi environment. There should be a closed WiFi system so people who need to conduct financial matters can have more security to conduct those matters.  The service at the front desk was very good and the staff there friendly.",3,2015,08,19
240,Family stay,"When we arrived the staff was very helpfull, as our room was not yet ready ( We arrived early) the receptionist took our suit cases and secured them. 

Room was very clean, spacious and the bed comfortable.
Nicely designed lobby area.

Breakfast was included but nice.
Smoothies, salmon, gluten free products and a cooked to order menu - incredible.
Did not expect this.

Breakfast staff were without exception,charming and faultless in their hospitality, especially Polish girl we met early morning. 

I was let down by a few issues that brought my rating of the hotel down.
Noisy street, little bit undesirable location and bar staff.
Front desk and breakfast staff were amazing with us, unfortunely, can not say the same about Bar staff.
Busy place but no explanation for being rude and complaing about people around.
We heard everything. 
Location - expect to be more in city centre, however, you can pick up a bus very easily into the city centre. 

Its a pity we couldnt have enjoyed the room more as we were out and about so much, but in the end, we had a pleasant relaxing stay and we will be back again.",4,2015,08,19
240,Great Hotel Great Location Great Rates,"My wife and I have just returned from a long weekend break in Dublin. We stayed in The Hilton Kilmainham and found it to be a great choice, it was very clean and modern the rooms were well decorated and the beds were fantastic. The friendly staff were a credit to the hotel and were happy to help in any way they could.The location was also good for the city centre and a number 40 bus delivered us into the city centre for 5 euros.
The bar was also very comfortable and a perfect stop for a nightcap before retiring to bed.
I thoroughly recommend this hotel to any future travellers and hope you enjoy your stay as much as we did",4,2015,08,18
240,Basic Hilton,"This was a very basic Hilton. We had a family Hilton View room with a King Sized bed as well as a twin bed. It is near the famous Gaol but not very close to other Dublin sights. 

Pros- It was on the Hop on Hop off Tour route. There were a few small restaurants nearby as well as a EuroSpar store. There were additional places to eat within a fifteen minute walk from the hotel. The room was large and had a large closet if you need more storage space. The toiletries were high quality.

It was very clean.

Cons- The bed was not comfortable despite being advertised as a Hilton Serenity Bed. It was probably the least comfortable Hilton bed I have slept in. 

The breakfast was poorly stocked. They ran out of orange juice, fried eggs, and pastries and did not refill them before we left. We were there at 9:00 so it wasn't the end of breakfast. I expect the breakfast to be plentiful at 9:00.",3,2015,08,13
240,Could have been better,"Return trip to Dublin and travelling with a lot of luggage and departing next day by train to Cork hence electing the Kilmainham Hilton due to handy location for station.
Amazed to find that road works still causing problems outside hotel, this time particularly challenging due to ammount of luggage. No staff to help and a real struggle to get everything in, luckily we had our Emirates driver to help!
Not impressed with the room this time but luckily only one night before heading off, bathroom was very small and a bit of a challenge.
Breakfast next morning standard Hilton buffet and reasonable, staff as commented before could try smiling!
Exit from hotel to the taxi was via the same route as our entry and again no staff to assist / help negotiate the key pass doors to the street.
Would have to reconsider using the hotel if the road works go on for much longer...",3,2015,08,12
240,bad manners,Left a negative review of this hotel before in the hope that management would address the issues but alas it seems they do not care .anyway decided to visit the bar as I live locally and the same bad service is still as bad .The bar staff are appalling they are rude slow and never smile.,1,2015,08,12
240,Hotel was okay,"Hotel was clean and comfortable but traveling as a family of 5 we needed adjoining rooms. This request was not met. Facility as a whole was nice but could use improvement with customer service.  Also the morning staff at breakfast was not very friendly, restaurant staff at night was much more welcoming.",4,2015,08,11
240,What a disappointment!,"I am such a fan of Hilton hotels, and was eager to use my long accrued points as the finale of my two week family vacation in Ireland. I expected Hilton's usual excellent accommodations and service, especially welcome on my last night. What a disappointment!

Although it isn't Hilton's fault that major road construction is taking place outside the lobby's front door, that only added to the poor overall experience. 

The hotel claimed its location was close to Dublin's many sights. Ha! I'd spent the previous night in central Dublin, and knew I was moving out of the thick of things. But often a quiet neighborhood can be quite a pleasant surprise. Not in this case. Their was no neighborhood to speak of, just one below par pub. To get anywhere required a car, a long long walk, or a tram or bus ride (both of which were a hike from hotel). 

The hotel itself was shabby, like it hadn't been cleaned or updated since the 70s. Worn dirty carpeting in the halls, and a pervasive smell that brought to mind those Christmas tree air fresheners people hang in their cars. 

Service was cold and robotic, a harsh change after two weeks of fantastic Irish hospitality. Hilton did not appear to use local employees, which can be fine. But not in this case. 

I would assuredly NOT recommend this hotel. Had I paid in cash, I'd feel ripped off, especially since for 20 euros less I could have stayed at a terrific warm clean central hotel, WITH breakfast. As is, I wish I could get my points back. ",2,2015,08,06
240,"Bright, clean and quiet rooms, unpredictable restaurant service","The room was bright, clean and quite, and the bed comfortable.  Overall it measured up to Hilton standards.  A few more minor adjustments and our introduction to Dublin and Ireland would have been excellent.  
Service at the 4 Corner Bar and at the Cinnamon was patchy.  For breakfast on day-one, we and several other couples waited by the sign to be seated but there was no one available to show us to our table.  When our grown-up children went for their breakfast later the same morning, they were not told they could take an omelette instead of the sausage.  On day three we were not offered orange juice at the table like we had been on days one and two.  
Dinner service at 4 Corners was equally inconsistent.  None of us was offered dinner rolls and butter for dinner on night-one, all of us received them on our second night  and only one of us got them on the third night.  
Finally the water in the shower was too hot and could not be lowered while the water in the bathroom faucet was cold and could not be increased.  
Having said that, it was still a nice hotel - close to Kilmainham Goal which is a must see and Phoenix Park - Dublin Zoo, the President's residence - ideal for an early morning walk.",3,2015,08,05
240,Good Hotel Average Location,"Good hotel, friendly staff and good facilities including the pool and spa which is a nice touch as often you have to pay for this.  Location is a bit out of town but it's good if you want the Gaol and the Guinness Storehouse.",4,2015,08,05
240,hilton kilmainham family stay,the hotel staff were friendly. there is very secure car parking.hotel is in an ideal location to heuston train station and dublin city . the pool tiles are very slippy surrounding the locker room and pool area. our breakfast was cold.,4,2015,08,05
240,great staff,"the hotel is lovely and the staff were more than welcoming and went out of their was to help you with anything we needed. room was clean, room service was amazing, only down side to this hotel is having to get a taxi to the city centre, but we knew that before going so cant really complain :-)",4,2015,08,04
240,Conveinence and Luxury,Rooms were very clean. Dinner was so lovely the entire dining room asked for the chef and provided a standing ovation to his slight embarrassment. Staff very friendly and helpful. the Hop on Hop off trolley picked up just across the street from the hotel. The trolley was affordable and gave the group incredible independence and access to all of Dublin. Trolley even provided headphones to plug into sightseeing recordings offered in multiple languages. Patriots across the street for a drink or two with dinner available upstairs. I could not ask for a better stay. I would stay there again.,4,2015,07,31
240,"Somewhat removed, but still a good choice","We chose this hotel because it had a family room and we were able to use Hilton points. The room was very comfortable with both a king and twin bed. The staff was very helpful, allowing us to use the desk phone to deal with an airline nightmare. The location is somewhat isolated and required us to take a taxi into Temple Bar for dinner. The hop on hop off bus stop across the street is very convenient, however. There is an indoor pool we would have loved to enjoy had our luggage with swim suits made it from London. All in all, I would stay here again. ",4,2015,07,29
240,Perfect Location,"We arrived in the Hilton before noon on Friday 24th July. Our room was ready. Lovely room loads of wardrobe space, a safe and tea/coffee making facilities. 
We walked into the Town which at a stroll took us 35 minutes. We were staying two nights. The breakfast was superb. We went for a stroll to the Phoenix Park and then into town after lunch. We walked to Heuston Station and got the Luas into town. Lovely location, within easy access of everything. The airport is only about 30 minutes away depending on traffic. There is parking on site at a charge of ‚Ç¨12 per day. There is a fitness centre/pool also which was a really nice treat. 
The only complaint I had was that at breakfast the tea tasted like coffee out of the pots. Need to separate coffee pots from tea pots. Everything else was lovely Thank You.",4,2015,07,29
240,What a comfortable night!,Really comfortable bed and bedding. Everything was very clean. The hydrotherapy pool downstairs in the leisure area was a great little area to relax in. The location right next to IMMA and Kilmainham Jail is great.,5,2015,07,28
240,"NO THOUGHT, CARE OR CONSIDERATION","My partner recently booked an over night stay at this hotel as a birthday present and having stayed at a few Hilton Hotels in the past - I was delighted..... delighted that was until we arrived at hotel shortly after 3pm on 25/07/15 we where met by the most inconsiderate staff EVER. My partner has Spina Bifada and therefore is wheelchair bound, he handed our confirmation to the Foreign receptionist who's English was not the best and was given something to sign, desk was too high so therefore he was handed it to sign on his knee (NOT EACTLY CATERING TO ALL CUSTOMERS). 
He was issued are room keys and directed to the lift, we walk into the room on forst floor to meet a twin room with accessible bathroom - He had booked a Double room with accessible bathroom, I feeling very frustrated returned to the reception desk only to end up with the same member of staff and explained the situation - she proceeded to tell me that YES we had in fact booked a Double room (LIKE I NEEDED HER TO TELL ME) and that unfortunately it would be another 40mins for a double room to become available or she could ZIP THE BEDS in current room together - I said we would wait for the room we paid for - I had to ask if we could wait in current room as we had alot of baggage and we had travelled quite a bit - she hestitated but said ok and that she would come get us when CORRECT ROOM was ready.
She arrived about an hour laater and apologised for the wait, handed us the NEW room keys - DID NOT offer any help with bags but directed us to the 3rd floor - we entered the new romm and where greeted by a smaller and tighter room, I knew there was going to be a problem and sure enough although it was a DOUBLE ROOM, there was no accessible bathroom - there was however a very high BATH - how they expected my Boyfriend to get in and out of this bath when he is a wheelchair user was beyond me - At this point my blood was BOILING.
We returned yet again to the reception desk and spoke to another staff member - they could not get it through their heads that he had booked and paid for a DOuble accessible room then proceeded to tell us that in fact there is no such rooms and that its twin rooms and the beds be zipped together - we had no choice but to accept this and told that they would do this once we left. I asked that because we had been messed about for 1 and half hours would there be any concession on the room rate - she said as we booked and paid online there was nothing the hotel could do, I HEARD THIS TWICE IN THE OVER NIGHT STAY WE WERE THERE WITH OTHER GUESTS - the receptionist informed she would speak to the front desk manager in morning and we should ask before check out. By this stage we were late for our Concert which we were also booked for so had to go get ready.
On check out the next morning - we asked to speak to the manager - she had NO CLUE who we where or what the situation was - basically telling us there was nothing she could do at that time as we booked online - BLAHBLAH - we have booked online but the hassle was received at the hands of the INCOMPETENT STAFF at this hotel. SHe validated out 12 EURO Parking for the night and gave me a bussiness card with her name on it and said to contact her for our NEXT STAY and she would give us a good rate - I WOULD NOT STAY HERE AGAIN IF IT WAS THE ONLY AVAILABLE HOTEL. 
SO - JUST TO CLARIFY - THIS HOTEL HAS THE WORST INCOMPASSIONATE, UNHELPFUL STAFF WHO CLEARLY HAVE NO THOUGHT FOR SOMEONE WITH A DISABILITY - I HAVE TRIED TO GET A CONTACT FOR THE HILTON GROUP CEO - A NAME IS ALL I CAN MANAGE TO FIND FOR NOW BUT WOULD LIKE EVERYONE TO KNOW THE BAD SERVICE THEY SHOULD EXPECT IF THEY STAY HERE",1,2015,07,28
240,Would stay here again,"Although this hotel is not near the center of town, it was well situated for our needs.  It is close to the Kilmainham Gaol (a worthwhile visit), as well as 2 Hop On/Hop Off stops and a taxi stand (diagonally across the street) and not far from other public bus stops.

Our upgraded room for 2 was roomy enough for our needs, with plenty of storage/closet space, good-sized bathroom, tea/coffee maker and refrigerator.  

The front desk staff was very helpful and sweet with all the guests and helped me with directions, arranging taxis and other questions.

The sidewalk construction outside the hotel which can be noisy.  The restaurant is ok - the prices are very good for the portions served, especially in Europe.  Some dishes were tasty and others were bland.  The servers were polite and friendly but at times, service was a bit slow.  However, service at the bar was expedient and efficient.",4,2015,07,27
240,"Nice staff, poor hotel","This hotel isn't located near anything of value.  It's across the street from the gaol, but over a 25 minute walk to all other attractions AND shops.  Normally you can find a nice small grocer or convenience shop nearby to grab snacks or forgotten supplies.  Nothing, absolutely nothing nearby, even asked the staff in case I missed a shop and they recommended I take a taxi into city center for a forgotten razor.  Really?  I passed a very nice looking Radisson near Dublin castle today. I'd recommend that over this Hilton for sure.

Besides poor location, the hot water is hard to come by.  My husband tried to give my girls a bath last night and had to change over to a shower it was so cold. I didn't think anything of it until I had to do the same tonight, and I also just washed my face in ice cold water from the sink.  Can't even get lukewarm water to wash hands or face. Not enjoyable, though it is nice to see something in the hotel can get cold.  My fridge doesn't work, surprise.  Also, the wifi is terrible, boots you off constantly.  It's free though, with no option to upgrade, so it's to be expected.  One or two small issues I always anticipated, but this simply isn't what I was hoping for when booking.",2,2015,07,25
240,Modern,"Stayed here for a Saturday and Sunday night for a visit to Dublin and was a very clean, modern hotel. Room was very cosy and bed was comfortable. Reception staff were all very helpful in giving directions to get to attractions and what buses to get. 

Is a bit out of the city but we expected that and is easy enough to get to as less than 15 minutes on a choice of two buses that come every two minutes. Then is a 20 minute walk to Dublin zoo and 15 to Heuston station. So is a bit out of the way but makes it calmer and is still a good location with easy to get to places.",4,2015,07,25
240,"Good Hotel, even though a little outside of Dublin","First, it is a HILTON and actually pretty new and in good condition. We shared a room with 2 adults and 2 kids and it was good size, clean and modern. The hotel itself also appears to be in a good condition, staff very friendly and good looking bar and facilities. The only downside for the kids was the pool, as this is more like a Spa set up and people were not too excited to see two teens playing in the pool ... so if you travel with kids, don't plan on using it.

Now the location ... when we originally planned the trip we were a little worried about it being too far from the city centre. On Day 1 we walked to Heuston station and got onto the train. But then we figured that the Hop On Hop Off tour just stops opposite the hotel and a 2 day card for this was more cost beneficial. So we ended up using this to go back and forth to the hotel. You could also walk, if you are up for a 45 to 60 min walk into the centre.

I highly recommend this hotel as it is a little outside, quiet, spacious and with the transport options the location should not be an issue.",5,2015,07,23
240,it's an OK hotel but close to double decker stop so thats a bonus,"We arrived at the hotel early and I had paid for early check-in, but of course the rooms were not ready.  We went to the breakfast and it was pretty decent.  Drank a few cups of coffee and went for a walk.  When we returned one of the rooms was ready.  We dropped our backpacks and went on the double decker bus that has a stop in front of the jail right down the street.  So that was very convenient.  When we returned the other room was ready and was told that since I was a Hilton Honors Gold member our room had been upgraded.  Upon entering the room we noticed it was a handicapped room.  By no means did I request that nor did we need it.  My son took a shower and since it is a handicapped room there is no place to put your clothes except for the floor, which became one giant wet floor from the shower.  His clothes were soaked.  I went back to the front desk and asked if that was an upgraded room, she replied yes it is you have a view from that room.  I replied the only thing I could see out of that room was a bunch of construction and the road not the jail. She said yeah that's the upgrade you get the view.  I laughed and then asked to be moved to a regular non-handicapped room.  She did and put us in a normal room.  After that the rest of the trip was uneventful.  Used the double decker bus a lot and walked a whole lot!!  But overall a good time in Dublin!",3,2015,07,22
240,Friendly staff,Staff went out of their way to accommodate us .  Their PA system was the best. The events room was decorated to a high standard and the food was excellent.  Staff were friendly and stayed with the delegation until the event finished. We got value for money.,5,2015,07,22
240,Luxury hotel across from the gaol,"(1) Overall Assessment: Comfortable luxury hotel that‚Äôs a bit away from the city center. (2) Room: Aaah!  Beautiful, spacious, comfortable. And a huge picture window from which we could see the mountains surrounding Dublin as well as the charming street below the window. Individually controlled air conditioning and heating. Plenty of storage to unpack with build-in drawers in part of the closet.  Has a TV with a large selection of channels (though CNN did not work) and free Internet.  Has a refrigerator and a coffee maker with instant coffee, decaf, and tea. Extremely friendly and helpful front desk. For example, with tourist suggestions, offered the kinds of extra advice that a trusted friend would give. They can also book some tours. (3) Bed: We had an executive double‚Äîthat‚Äôs King Size in North American. And although this wasn‚Äôt the Westin, it was heavenly (Westin markets its beds as heavenly beds).  We slept extremely well.  (4) Bathroom: Beautiful.  We felt pampered there.  Shelves and lots of counter space to unpack toiletries.  (5) Hotel Amenities: Gym, full-service restaurant. The lobby features a computer and printer, in case you need to print something. (6) Hotel Location: Across the street from the historic Kilmainham Gaol, Museum of Modern Art, and one of the stops on the Hop-On‚ÄîHop-Off bus. A 9.50 Euro taxi ride or 20-minute walk from Heuston Station. A 7-minute walk to the bus. But not in the heart of the city.  (7)  Watch Out for: They don‚Äôt provide new soap every day‚Äîbut that‚Äôs something we noticed in all of the area. I can only surmise that the showering and soaping habits of Europeans and North Americans significantly differ.  (8) Overall Recommendation: Enthusiastic recommendation.",5,2015,07,21
240,Great for Families,"We really enjoyed our stay.  The hotel is close to a number of attractions (Phoenix Park, Kilmainham Jail, Irish Museum of Modern Art) and Dublin city centre is only 10 minutes away on the bus.  Breakfast was great, dinner highly recommended (try a curry) and our children really enjoyed playing about in the pool.",5,2015,07,21
240,"bad start, great finish.","was greeted by a very rude man who made me feel extremely small when i said i only had a debit card on me not credit, if it wasnt so late i would have walked out!.The room was lovely, well sized, clean and comfortable. The rest of the staff turned out to be very friendly and helpful doing everything they could to make us happy.",4,2015,07,21
240,Great Service but not a great location.,"Construction going on in front of hotel so cab drivers can not let you off in front of hotel. So we had to drag our luggage quite a way and through revolving doors (we didn't see other door until we got our luggage stuck in revolving door). No bellman to help. Thank goodness the hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. 
The 4 Corners bar staff seem unorganized. You couldn't tell who was suppose to be your server. Waited quite awhile before they took your order but once they did the food/drinks came fast.  The first day barender was very helpful and nice. The next few days the bartender was not very warm and friendly. We checked out the menu for he restaurant and the choices did not seem that appealing. We were afraid the service may not be that great.  The location is not near any other restaurants you can walk to, except for one across the street. That pub does not serve dinner. There is an Italian restaurant above the pub and we ate there two nights in a row.  Did not want to eat a third night. There was a small store that we could walk to for water and snacks. 
Bus stops are directly in front of hotel which is a plus. We wish the hotel had a coffee shop that we could stop by before we boarded the Hop on and Hop off bus for a quick bite to eat.",3,2015,07,17
240,Pleasant Stay,"I used this hotel while on business recently and couldnt fault it.  The rooms are of a decent size, free WiFi and comfortable beds.  Breakfast is buffet style and of good quality.  This hotel is pricey during the summer months and beware of the 12 Euro overnight parking charges which is not mentioned on their website",4,2015,07,16
240,Top class,"Met by friendly staff.Quite a small room but plenty big enough.Bed was fantastic, nice big tv.The shower had good temperature control.Breakfast in the morning was very good nice big spread to suit all tastes.Easy and quick check in and check out.Will be back again hopefully.",5,2015,07,15
240,Decent hotel but a little away from town center,"I would have rated it higher but for its location to the town center and a few basic misses. The good - as a hotel it wasn't all that bad. The rooms were of a good size and well appointed. The breakfast was alright. It had a decent restaurant and bar area. The Kilmainham Gaol (a major attraction) was right across the street. One highlight was the staff was super friendly and helpful. However some basic misses - I had forgotten my travel adaptor and the front desk did not provide me with a loaner and insisted I buy one from the vending machine. But the vending machine was out of adapters through our stay so I had to wait until the morning after to buy an adaptor. Worst, the vending machine would not dispense anything the next morning and I had to buy water from outside as well. And of course it's a fair distance to the center of town - 5 or 6 kms. So if you want to hang out town side this would be a best bet. ",3,2015,07,15
240,"Great pool, convenient location, limited dining choice","This is a typical Hilton, great beds, well trained staff, comfortable and well appointed. The pool is really great and our kids loved it. The hop on/off buses stop across the road so skip the walk/taxi and just get a multi-day ticket. The dining options are limited so eat in town or get a Chinese/Thai takeaway (excellent) or pizza up the the road or eat in town. Local pub/Italian wasn't great. Breakfast was disappointing for a Hilton.",4,2015,07,14
240,Soooooo average,"The rooms are tiny. I felt like I was on an episode of Orange is the New Black. Decor dated. Clean enough , and bar open late. Nice that it is opposite the tram which is easy access to Grafton Street and the main squares. Expensive for what it is",3,2015,07,14
240,Hilton Kilmainham,"Wonderfully appointed hotel conveniently situated across from the Kilmainham Gaol. This was my second stay at this hotel and very pleased at the location, decorum, restaurant, and attentiveness of the hotel staff",5,2015,07,11
240,a great place to stay in a great city,toured Ireland for 8 days and this was the one hotel that was 'familiar' and completely met our expectations. Staff was extremely responsive and helpful as well as very welcoming.  would definitely consider a stay at this hotel on any future visits to Dublin.,5,2015,07,10
240,Great location but rooms very warm,"Great hotel location, next to tourist open top bus, dublin bikes and kilmainham jail (for tours) Its slightly out of busy city centre but about 10 mins there by car.
I found bedrooms very very warm, the window only opens a small bit due to safety limiter and air conditioner operated but did not cool the air (despite being set to cool) 
The dead heat did not make for a good nights sleep.",3,2015,07,09
240,Gluten Free Breakfast Heaven,"We stayed at this hotel as we were attending a concert that day in Kilmainham Hospital. The room was lovely, we had dinner shortly after arrival and it was perfect. But the thing that made our stay stand out was breakfast the following morning. As someone with awkward dietary requirements, breakfasts in hotels usually consists of fruit, fruit and more fruit. That was not the case here, there was gluten free bread, goats cheese, gluten free cereal and soya milk on the counter. It was like a dream come true! What was best about this is that I didn't need to have the awkward conversation with waiting staff which I dread, instead everything was there for me to access. I might suggest that a gluten free alternative to your hot breakfast but truly the hotel is already head and shoulders above anywhere else we've stayed.",4,2015,07,09
240,"Convenient, quiet, and accomodating","Stayed 3 nights on my first visit to Dublin.  Hotel directly across the street from the Kilmainham Jail (major tourist attraction) and both Hop-on Hop-off bus lines picked up on their main loops from a stop just out front.  Getting to city centre was just a matter of walking a block to the bus stop and taking either the 13 or the 40 to College Green, about 10-15 minutes.  Two nice parks, War Memorial (with lovely path along the River Liffey) and modern museum of art (with formal gardens) within a very short walk of the hotel.    All in all quite convenient, quiet, and high quality of service.  Staff very friendly.",5,2015,07,08
240,Small Friendly Hilton,"This is small Hilton, it has a bar, small restaurant and small gym.  The staff are friendly and it is opposite Kilmainham gaol.  It is a 5 mins taxi ride into the centre.  The price per room can vary quite a lot on the various hotel booking sites.  I have stayed a few times and paid circa 40% different price for the same package.",4,2015,07,07
240,Good Location,"About 20-25 minutes from Dublin Airport.  Perfect location if you are going to an event at Kilmainham Royal Hospital, it is literally just across the road.  Hotel is located opposite Kilmainham Gaol, tourist site, and also 1 minute from the Hop On Hop Off bus stop - so just great.

The bedroom and bathroom were both very spacious - loads of storage space and lovely separate shower.  Very comfortable beds.  All the staff we came across were very friendly and helpful.  The menu in both bar and restaurant had a good selection and the food was very good.  Breakfast was buffet style and plenty to choose from.  We didn't use the spa area, but heard from other guests that it was very nice.  The wifi was 'ok', could've been better.

The only negative I have to say is that they would not serve us in the bar, as residents, after closing time until all the non-residents had left - which we found slightly annoying.

Overall, a very nice hotel and a very pleasant stay.",4,2015,07,05
240,Disappointed,"As we were travelling on the early morning ferry we decided to make a stopover in Dublin, we opted for the Hilton Kilmainham the hotel its self was bright and spotless as was the room we were allocated Our problem commenced around 2200 with noise coming from some where outsideit appeared to be from an extractor or something similar and as my wife said at the time it will shut down later on but no such luck it was as if there was a Locomotive on the roof , we wrote to the hotel management but then it appears from your web site they only reply to positive comments.",2,2015,07,05
240,June visit.,"In our experience Hilton always delivers. Good sized room and plenty of space for storage and all our luggage. Comfortable beds and extra towels delivered on request. The staff were charming, as were most people we met in Ireland! The buffet breakfast was a good standard and they had Irish breakfast available. Cab only cost a few euros into the city center and the area around the hotel was safe. Enjoyed our stay and can happily recommend this hotel.",4,2015,07,04
240,I am very dissapointed,"I went for lunch time the other day to enjoy their famous terrace. Waitress was totally lost, like shoe does not know what she is doing. She came over to take an order before she even gave us menu. Food was barely warm like it was reheated several times, we have ordered water and condiments along with our meal but we have had to remind a few times staff to bring it. Finally when fun came it wasn't looking good and fresh, definitely I will not go there for food anymore. I cannot say anything about rooms but bar staff is totally unprofessional.",2,2015,07,04
240,Practical hotel - well placed in the city,"This is a great location to stay.  The hotel is clean and efficient.  It also happens to be one of the start points of the bus hop tour.

There are 2~3 tourist spots within walking distances... great to pace around in the mornings or evenings.

Its is not too near the bustling of the city...yet near enough.",4,2015,07,03
240,Great relaxing 1 night stay,"Booked hotel as was attending concert in Royal Hospital Kilmainham. Check in was friendly and efficient. Enjoyed coffee and food outside on the busy terrace of bar. Drink service slightly slow. Room was family room with king and single beds. Really comfortable and big. Nice bathroom and rain shower. Great night sleep. Breakfast next morning was ok, ‚Ç¨12 per person which I felt was a bit overpriced for quality. Check out again very efficient. Parking was ‚Ç¨12.",4,2015,07,01
240,Shocking service,"Stayed here at the weekend for 2 nights. Rooms were lovely and clean and reception staff were very friendly and accommodating. The breakfast was fab.
unfortunately the same can not be said for the bar and restaurant staff who were rude. Drink orders were taken down wrong and they made you out to be a liar when you told them they were wrong. The drink prices depended on who was serving. 
The hotel manager was vile, she spoke to customer's appallingly and spoke to her staff even worse in front of hotel guests.
We were having a sing in the bar and she clicked her fingers at 2 miserable security men and they charged over like bulldogs chewing a wasp. We weren't drunk or overly loud and would of stopped if she had asked.
one of our party sat outside the hotel with her lunch but was rudely rushed away by the bar staff.
we had booked a meal before we left in the hotel bar but when we went for it there wss no record of the booking, no sorry just an eye roll and 2 bowls of crisps to share between 17 of us.
NOT GOOD!",2,2015,06,30
240,Privat weekend Town-Trip,Very nice Hotel but not very close to Dublin Town Center. Taxi cost to downtown Dublin about 11 EUR. Hopon Hopoff Bus Station just across the street. Perfect as start Point for Dublin Sightseeing tours.,4,2015,06,29
240,Hen weekend,Lovely hotel and brilliant reception staff just a shame the bar staff and bar manager were awful! Disgusting service and we were totally felt not welcome! For a party of 17 we were treated shockingly! Won't be returning!,2,2015,06,28
240,Barmen with bad attitude - otherwise a good stay,"We stayed here recently after a concert nearby. The hotel is what you would expect from the the Hilton brand and the rooms were clean and comfy and the reception and security staff helpful and friendly. Breakfast is the usual - nothing exceptional but enjoyable none the less.

The only negative comment I would have would be the lack of courtsey and basic level of customer service shown by two of the extremely rude male bar staff who were abrupt and abrasive with customers and the staff assisting them in the lounge - people such as this should not be in customer facing roles. Hopefully management will address this as it put a taint on what was otherwise a enjoyable stay.  Would have rated it 4 stars but for this.",3,2015,06,27
240,Poor Service,"The service in this hotel is appalling and when I wrote and made a complaint I received no acknowledgment. They don't respect their customers. Cold breakfast, I was finished my breakfast before they brought us the eggs on soggy pieces of white bread. Poor table service in the bar even though it was empty. Management  uninterested with our complaints.",1,2015,06,27
240,Another great Hilton in Dublin,"This property is all you'd expect from an international Hilton, plus fantastic modern touches. It's a more centrally located location in town as compared to the other Dublin Hilton, and it's just as nice.  Right across from the Kilmainham jail, it can be a little touristy. But the bus tours are either conveniently located across the street, or if you dont like the crowds, inconveniently.",4,2015,06,21
240,"Bang, bang, bang","this hotel is modern and clean. Not a bad location but definitely not in amongst the hustle and bustle of this wonderful city. My only compliant was the sound of idiots dropping weights every few minutes in the gym below from around 8am til after 9pm. Why o why they can't lift and lower and opt to lift and drop is beyond me, but believe me it is utterly annoying and seemingly unstoppable despite the efforts of the front desk staff to advise these idiot otherwise. Breakfast, drink and food all good. My tip would be to ask for a high floor at the back of the hotel.",3,2015,06,19
240,"good hotel, good location and good value","Kilmainham Hilton in Dublin is a clean, well staffed hotel that is located opposite one of Dublin's main tourist attractions, the Kilmainham Gaol. Although it is not located in the city of Dublin, it is within walking distance if you dont mind walking 4klms or so. We found the walk was just what was needed - especially after a hearty Irish Breakfast. The hotel is a little tired -- some of the bath fixtures are chipped and lights not working. They have removed all bar fridges - having said that a man was quickly sent with a small working fridge for us to store milk and faulty lamps were replaced quickly. Accommodation is expensive in Dublin and if you are after a decent night's sleep (the king size bed was firm and comfortable with fresh white linen), and a hot shower then book here. Good value for money. The desk staff were fantastic - nothing was too much trouble for them and they even made my husband a cup of tea when he was jet lagged and awake at 4am and the kitchen was closed. They also went out of there way to deliver room service in a timely manner when their restaurant was very busy with a local christening. There is a ""hop on hop off "" tourist bus directly opposite the hotel, which takes you into Dublin's city and is a good way to learn about all the major attractions. If you want value for money near Dublin, with great service and a good location, then book here. Family friendly too.",4,2015,06,19
240,Not a gaol cell,"Struggled to find 2 rooms for 2 nights at late notice for a trip to Dublin, so took this booking in a location I wouldn't normally have considered.  Pleasantly surprised at how handy it really was to get around by both car and bus.  Lovely clean hotel, comfortable, friendly and efficient staff.  Booked room only so didn't try breakfast facilities.  I would stay here again.",5,2015,06,19
240,Very enjoyable stay,"My partner and I spent 4 nights at this hotel a couple of kilometres from the city centre from 11th-15th June 2015. The hotel is very clean and the staff are very pleasant. We had a standard double room and I was surprised and how roomy it was and the bed was huge! The en-suite bathroom was clean and had a useful unit and shelves for storage. There was a pull out shaving mirror which was a nice touch and there is also a hairdryer available. The shower was the only disappointing thing, a trickle more than a shower and the water kept getting really hot and then going cold!
We booked breakfast for the duration of our stay and there was a great choice-buffet style. The full Irish breakfast was delicious and there was also cereals, fresh fruit and continental choices as well. We were not rushed in any way.
The location was ideal for us as it was nice and quiet, we both slept very well. To get to the centre you can hop in a taxi across the road (always 3 or 4 waiting) for about 10 euro or if you head through the large gate to the left of the hotel, after a nice walk you reach the Lucas tram stop at Heuston and it is 1.80E for a single trip into the centre which only takes a few minutes. Be sure to do the Kilmainham gaol visit if you can, really interesting!
We ate dinner twice in the hotel, both times it was very nice, not amazing, but fine. The bacon and cabbage is good. There is a good pizza place across the road next to the Patriots Inn which was surprisingly good. 
The one thing we regret not having time to use was the swimming pool and spa. It looked amazing and there is a fully equipped gym with staff on hand too.",4,2015,06,18
240,Great hotel but not in the heart of Dublin.,"We stayed here the first two nights we were in Dublin and for European standards, the room was large.  The bathroom was very nice and the water pressure was great.  We had a balcony that was nice but very noisy since it was on a pretty busy street on which much construction was taking place.  There was a workout facility which you could use that had a sauna, steam room, hot tub and pool.  I don't think children are welcomed but not sure.  The staff was very nice and we had breakfast included which was a buffet style with a lot of variety of meats, fruit and other Irish breakfast items.  The only complaint that I really have is that it was a little noisy but we were on the construction side so maybe the interior rooms and rooms on the other street are more quiet. 
There are several different historical places to visit near by and downtown Dublin is a 15 minute bus ride, which is easy to catch. I would stay here again because I felt that it was a very good value for the money.",4,2015,06,17
240,Nice hotel and great location,"We stayed here for one night after arriving in Ireland before heading out to see the countryside.  The hotel is in a great location directly across the street from Kilmainham Gaol.

Our flight arrived in the early AM and we were at the hotel by 8.  As the hotel was full, we were unable to get into a room early although this really worked in our favor.  We simply had some breakfast, then went across the street for the opening of the Gaol at 9 AM and were in the first tour group into the Kilmainham.  By the time we had toured the Gaol, we went back to the hotel around 11 AM and they were able to get us into our room by that time so we could take a power nap before seeing more of Dublin.

The hotel is an easy walk to the Liffey and to Phoenix Park.  Also, the hop-on bus tours stop right at Kilmainham Gaol so this location is strategic for other sightseeing around Dublin.

The rooms are nice and the staff very courteous.  There is not much as far as views so one room is as good as another.  The breakfast buffet is well stocked with a wide selection including a good and proper Irish breakfast.

We would stay here again next trip to Dublin.",4,2015,06,17
240,Ana is a star,"I stay here quite frequently with work.  But this time, I felt compelled to write a review. The agent we booked with messed up the booking, and when I tried to check in, they had no record and unfortunately no rooms left. Ana stepped in to help, speaking to agent and also trying to get me in other hotels (which were fully booked too). Anyway to cut a long g story short, she managed to squeeze me in and sort out agent. She is a asset to Hilton. I have always found the staff helpful, friendly, and professional.  Food in my opinion is lovely with good selection in bar and for breakfast.  Rooms are clean, tidy and spacious.  Overall would recommend it.",5,2015,06,16
240,Mediocre at best,"We stayed here with our 2 year old son overnight for an early hospital appointment in Crumlin. The hotel is spotlessly clean and the reception staff were friendly enough but that was he height of its good points. There is no atmosphere. The beds are so uncomfortable, the food in the bar is pretty bad. There is a nice selection for breakfast but while we were there the orange juice and tea had an odd taste and we couldn't drink it. (Not to say that it always does but it did while we were there). The pool is pretty good and warm. Our son loved it. I probably would stay again if I had to but it definitely wouldn't be my first choice.",3,2015,06,15
240,Nice hotel with decent location,"It's a pretty new hotel.  It's on the edge of Dublin's worst traffic, so if you're say working in Citywest or one of the outer business parks, but do not want to be stuck in a hotel a 30 Euro cab ride from the city center each way, this is pretty nice.  A uber or cab to Temple Bar or Dublin Castle can be found for 8-10 euro in traffic.  It's walkable to city center if you're in the mood for some exercise, and you can get the Luas at any number of stops, closest being Suir Road.

Wifi is totally free and pretty good.  never any complaints.  Breakfast was a bit high, but there is a Natural Baker/Insomnia/Eurospar within a couple minutes walk for a lighter option.",4,2015,06,15
240,Excellent Stay,Hotel staff and front desk are very helpful. Location of hotel is perfect for site seeing near the hotel by foot and a short cab ride into downtown. Would definitely stay here again on a return visit.,5,2015,06,15
240,Top notch,"We stayed for 2 nights and were very impressed. Room was extra clean and well above Hilton average.  Walk to the Kilmainham Goal, right across the street. Buss to temple bar 1 block away. Restaurant & bar in hotel. Room quiet and clean. I would stay again.",5,2015,06,14
240,Mixed Messages,The location is a bit out of the way in Dublin but taxi fares aren't too bad from the city center. The staff is sufficiently polite but not overly friendly. This goes for the bar/restaurant and the front desk. The rooms were nicely appointed but the beds were very stiff and not good for sleeping. The best selling point is the hotel's location next to Kilmainham Jail and the hop on hop off buses.,3,2015,06,13
240,Very handy location.,This hotel is easy to get to off the N4 and has underground  car parking. It is an half hour drive from the ferry port and quick to get into the city centre. Near the Guinness  brewery !  It is a modern hotel in good condition with a good choice of food. The food service was quick and the quality good. The staff were very helpful and friendly and had a good knowledge of the city. Its a good hotel to stay at and the rooms were quite even though you are in a city location.,5,2015,06,13
240,"Great hotel, fantastic service, nice breakfast","My family stayed two nights at the Hilton Kilmainham and we were very happy with this hotel.  We arrived after an overnight flight from North America at around 8am and of course our room was not yet available (hotel was full the night before). But we were able to grab (complementary) breakfast at the hotel and afterwards we toured the Gaol across the street and did a lap on the double decker bus and by the time we returned our room was ready - thank you Ana at the front desk for taking good care of us!  The room was spacious by any standard but particularly for rooms in Europe; the bathroom was modern and large as well. Our room was very quiet as it faced inward rather than towards the road, which was important as a music festival was going on nearby that would have been loud for rooms facing that way.  The bed was comfortable and the linens and towels and toiletries were top notch. I should mention that the WiFi was reliable throughout our stay.  

Breakfast was very good, everything you could hope for in a buffet, and included for gold Hilton Honors members.  The ladies in the restaurant seemingly spoke little English, but were helpful...my son wanted pancakes, which were not on the buffet, but one of the servers went in the back and made him some.  Nice!

I had a couple pints of Guinness at the bar and ate fish and chips for dinner the first night and both were good, though the chips were really more like potato wedges.  I returned to my room and my son decided he was now hungry so I went back down and ordered him some food.  The bartender put it all on a nice tray with the fancy metal dome cover, utensils, condiments, etc. for me to carry up to the room. Nice again!  My son thought it was cool having his food served that way.

The hotel is well located though not really in central Dublin, which to me was actually kind of a good thing.  It is a relatively short walk to the Guinness Brewery and to the Dublin Zoo and Phoenix Park, and the staff is happy to sit with you to map out a course for your day.  However, there aren't many restaurants in the immediate vicinity, so that's one drawback.  But I was able to walk to a nearby Avis to pick up a rental car, and the hotel let me park in the garage for a little while for free to pick up our bags and check out.  Very helpful.

Overall, we really enjoyed our stay at the Hilton Kilmainham and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a nice hotel outside the hubbub of Dublin.  
",5,2015,06,12
240,Nice stay at the Hilton Kilmainham,"A nice hotel, right next to Kilmainham Gaol.  Although not in the center, it is an easy tram ride to the center (after a few minute walk).  It is fairly close to the Guinness Storehouse and train station.  Good sized, clean room and bathroom. Nice breakfast.  Overall good hotel if you don't want to be right in the center of Dublin.",4,2015,06,10
240,Stay here when in Dublin,This was the last night of our 10 day/10 city golf trip. we were very tired and the room was very comfortable and reasonably priced. Very convenient to airport. The food and Guinness at the bar was as good as any we had during the trip.,5,2015,06,08
240,Nice multi-day stay,"Our stay was quite nice at the Hilton Kilmainham. The staff was quite nice and helpful. I interacted with the front desk by telephone prior to departure from the States for recommendations of transportation from the airport, and upon arrival they helped us plan our visits in the area. We took the Aircoach to city center and then the bus to Emmett Street and were there very quickly. Our room was away from the road and quiet. The room was large, clean, and comfortable. The bed was very comfortable. There is an outside patio area in front of the bar that looked like it would be quite nice in warm weather, but a little too breezy when we were there to try it out. The breakfast was impressive and very enjoyable - the best of the many hotels we stayed in during our visit to Ireland. My wife and I went across the street to the Royal Hospital grounds and had a most wonderful stroll around the grounds and visited the modern art museum there. As we were leaving town for the airport after two weeks the bus drove past the hotel and on past the train station and we then realized just how close it was to Heuston Station. There is a petrol/gas station and store just down the street that has an ATM (but no beer for sale, ugh) if you need one. At the end of our stay at this hotel we took the tram to our next and were impressed with how close the tram stop was to the hotel. We loved Dublin's LUAS tram and for that reason would have no reservations staying at this hotel again. The excellent public transport in the city makes getting around easy.",5,2015,06,07
240,"Staff very Helpful, Clean, & Great Location!","Our stay was actually very good and the staff was extremely helpful. This was our first time in Dublin, and the front desk clerk had great suggestions for things that we could go see that were all within walking distance.  The breakfast was very good, the rooms were clean, the pillows were heavenly (typical Hilton pillows) and beds were quite comfortable, which was great after a long flight through the night to get to Ireland from Chicago. If you're ok dealing with some construction out front, then i would highly recommend you stay here.",5,2015,06,06
240,Comfortable Hotel- Good Location,"Really good Hotel..Very clean clean and bright room. Bed was very comfortable, a little road noise was evident from the room that we were in but not loud enough to prevent sleep. We did not have breakfast here so I cannot comment on that. Overall a very good experience and I would stay here again.",4,2015,06,04
240,Great Experience,"We stayed here when attending the Patti Smith gig in Kilmainham. We had a great stay. The room was large and very comfortable.  The restaurant and bar are great, and the staff welcoming and helpful.  Looking forward to returning.",5,2015,06,04
240,Good One Night Stay,"Stayed here on one night deal which included breakfast.. Rooms are modern, clean with Big TV.  The bed was comfortable also. We ate that evening of our stay in the bar where my partner and I had the curry.. Was ok, not really that spicy. If your looking for a proper curry then go to an Indian restaurant but overall not bad.. Breakfast was good also. ",4,2015,06,03
240,"Wonderful Staff, Very Helpful","The staff at this location were very helpful and we felt like they went out of their way to ensure we had a good time. We received a welcome letter outlining area locations that we might enjoy, transportation options and even exchanged currency for us. Although this was a business trip at the start, we extended our stay for leisure. The bartender, Michael, was fun & outgoing and we made it a point to stop in for a beverage each evening before retiring for the night. Staying at Hilton Kilmainhaim will render you with ""No Worries"".  Cheers.",5,2015,05,29
240,Beautiful Modern Hotel... a bit out of the way though,"Really enjoyed the feel of this hotel (it's what I've become accustomed to, I guess). The only downfall was the construction outside of the hotel.  Made it a bit challenging to cross the road.  Who am I kidding, I find it difficult to cross the road anywhere they drive on the left.  The hotel is a outside of the downtown core, so a bus ride into town is necessary.  TIP - if you're waiting for a bus at a bus stop in Dublin, that is not a guarantee the bus is going to pick you up... you have to ""wave it down"".  We learned our lesson as a number of buses passed us by.

The front staff were incredibly helpful.  They pointed us in the right direction and even shared their own power chargers with me (mine wasn't working for my phone).

I really enjoy Hilton hotels, so I'd stay here again... I just wish it was a little more centrally located.

Oh - we did have a pretty good Italian meal at a little restaurant kitty corner to the hotel.",4,2015,05,29
240,Put it on your list of possibilities.,"While in Dublin we stayed at the Kilmainham and the Morrison.  Kilmainham is the bigger bang for the buck.  If you don't need to right in the middle of the City Centre then try Kilmainham.  Just one block South (Emmet Street) you can catch a route 40 bus. Cost 2.55, just as quick as a taxi ride.  Can get you Guinness Strore House, Trinity College, Temple Bar, St. Patrick's, Connoley Street, etc. Hotel had a good wi-if connection.  Bed was comfortable.  Down side is that there is not a ton of restaurants near by.  On site breakfast buffet was good.  There's a great little Italian restaurant (La Dolce Vita) across the street. It can get very busy on some nights.",4,2015,05,29
240,Good enough for business,"Rooms are comfortable, service is good, rooms are neat and clean but the sleep quality is not that good. The rooms are very hot and I don't do AC during nights, requested a slimmer blanket but they have only one type. Never slept without sweating",4,2015,05,27
240,Good short stay hotel,"We stayed here for one night only so that we could visit Kilmainham Gaol and the Guinness Storehouse.  The jail was a 2 minute walk away and the Guinness Storehouse about 15 minutes walk, the Irish Museum of Modern Art is also right on the doorstep.  There were a few bars and restaurants within walking distance.  The hotel was very clean, the staff were excellent - friendly and knowledgeable, breakfast was probably the best I've experienced in a 'chain' hotel, I would recommend this hotel if you don't want to be right in the centre of things, the Hop on Hop off bus stops opposite (beside the gaol).
We didn't have time (unfortunately) to check out the gym/pool.",4,2015,05,27
240,Nothing extrordinary...,"We stayed at three Hilton's during a recent Europe vacation and Dublin was our last stop. The location is good if you want something quiet. It is near (10-15 minute walk) the light-rain line, so you can get to the action in about a half-hour or so. A lot of the hop-on/off buses pick up across the road as well, so that is handy. There's not a lot else in the immediate area other than the Kilmainham Jail (a must see), a museum, and a restaurant/bar all pretty much at the intersection. The front desk was the least friendly of our encounters. Not rude by any means, but definitely not going out of their way to be overly helpful or friendly. The hotel has more character than usual it seemed, with a lot of nice woodwork throughout. However, the rooms were dated to me; with furniture that had seen much better days. The mini-fridge/bar was empty and didn't work. I don't know if this was just our room or a hotel-wide thing. There are no ice-machines, which I found odd. One has to go to the bar and ask for ice-- which was inconvenient. I know ice isn't that popular in Europe, but I would think most of their visitors would appreciate an ice-machine, especially if there's no fridge to keep things cold. The shower/tub had only a half-glass partition, which didn't contain the water. The floor and commode would be wet after each shower. The hot water was so variable. It would go from mild to scalding every few minutes and didn't make for a relaxing shower at all. The tub faucet would only produce a very weak stream of lukewarm water at best, so a soak was out. The bar and restaurant were pretty good, both in taste and service. The fitness area and spa were above average and quite nice to have. Overall, not my favorite Hilton and we'll probably look for a different hotel on our next visit to Dublin.",3,2015,05,26
240,Food hotel but couple of disappointments,"The hotel itself is pleasant enough but the room was disappointing - the shower was very prone to switching between hot and cold and this was not helpful.  The shower glass protection was too small and so the floor got very wet.  The WiFI whilst free was very temperamental and kept jumping out, which was very frustrating.  On the upside, the bed was very spacious and the staff courteous.  The room was very quiet and we had a room with a view which meant we could see the Wicklow Mountains from behind a mesh screen.",3,2015,05,26
240,First time in Dublin,"I was on business in Dublin and stayed overnight at this hotel not far from the center. Obviously we can not say anything about Hilton. Great structure, good hospitality and helpfulness, good breakfast great room, just a little noisy for a motor always running. You have not understood what it was, it was not air conditioned. excellent.",4,2015,05,25
240,Ahhhh Hilton,"After a weeklong tour staying in ...interesting... hotels, the tour group ended with a one-night stay at this hotel.  There's nothing like a Hilton.  Very pleasant staff.  Clean and comfortable.  While it's definitely not a historic hotel, which is what some people want, this had the comfort I wanted.  I would stay here again for sure.",5,2015,05,24
240,Below average hilton...not recommended,"The rooms are VERY QUIET, which was good.  Everything else about the room was satisfactory but not exceptional.  The front desk staff was a mixed bag of very helpful to struggling with English.  The room service was very poor, but I was stuck in my room working so I had to suffer through it.  I also got downgraded when I arrived versus the room I booked online.",3,2015,05,21
240,Business oriented but good for tourists too,"Traveling in May on vacation, I chose to stay at the Hilton Kilmainham. Overall, the hotel presents itself as a very nice and very typical business-oriented Hilton property. It has all of the basic amenities I expect from a Hilton. The front desk is friendly, the rooms are clean and comfortable, and there is a full restaurant onsite. 

As a HHonors member, I was given an upgrade to a high floor with a ""view"". However, the outside of the building has a heavy screen over part of the building, which detracts from the ""view"". The hotel was very comfortable with ample space for two people for a few days. The only negative is the bathroom shower/tub. The space is very small and  configured awkwardly, with a partial glass door. We are not large people, but we found it difficult to shower.

While the hotel may appear business-oriented, and ultimately is not ""adjancent"" to many key sights, I think it is perfect for tourists. It is a ~$10 euro ride away from the main area (when light traffic). It is directly across from the Kilmainham jail and a key musuem - putting two great sites within walking distance. Ultimately, having seen the location of the comparable hotels in the key area of Dublin, we thought we preferred being a little ways away. It made for a comfortable retreat from the action at night, while still being close enough to enjoy it all.",5,2015,05,20
240,Stayed as going to Vicar Street event,"Very convenient location & easy access from N4. Room good & everything worked. Breakfast good & good variety.Short taxi ride from vicar street & city centre. Only downside was extra charges for parking ‚Ç¨12 for 1 night..
      ",4,2015,05,19
240,Comfortable and welcoming,"I found this hotel extremely efficient, discreet, comfortable and quiet. It was located within easy distance of the railway station and IMMA. I didn't try the food or drink so cannot comment there. I found that there were no particular places of interest to eat in the vicinity but it wasn't difficult or expensive to get into the city centre. Waking to a walk through the grounds of IMMA was a plus",5,2015,05,19
240,Nice Hilton,Good location near the heart of Dublin and directly across from the Kilmainham Gaol a wonderful historic location a must for all not just overseas visitors.Great spa area super comfy rooms will be back soon.,3,2015,05,17
240,Loved the hotel - loved the location,"Near the Kilmainham Hospital (now modern art museum) and the Kilmainham Gaol.  The hotel serves a wonderful breakfast, the leisure center is awesome.  Another added bonus for overseas travelers - this hotel is within walking distance to the Avis Rental Car agency.",5,2015,05,14
240,Comfortable,"We stayed here for just one night, so there are several parts of the resort that we did not utilize. The front desk staff quoted us a price that was higher than it had been online a few days earlier. I booked the rooms anyway, the day we needed them, and when I got there, she said she gave us the lower price, which was great and unexpected.

Our rooms were quite nice. They were not huge, but they were comfortable. The showers were fine, with good pressure. We did not use the pool, so I can not review that. Breakfast looked very nice, but there was not much that we ate and our kids left hungry. They had a full Irish breakfast buffet, but we are quite picky, which is not their fault. Coffee was good, but kids did not like hot chocolate. Service was fine, but not great. We got off at the wrong tram stop, late on Sunday night. The area was deserted, and we all felt very uncomfortable. Make sure you take a cab or drive, if you are going at night, as walking around, even with a group of 6, is not really recommended. The hotel is very close to the jail (Kilmainham Gaul) and easily accessible by public transportation during the day.",4,2015,05,10
240,Weekend break in Dublin,Lovely hotel and you get everything you'd expect from a Hilton. Special mention must go to the staff as they where very friendly and gave us some great advice on restaurants even making the reservations for us. Only down side is that's a little out of the way of the main parts of Dublin but that shouldn't be problem if the weather is good as the tourist bus stops over the road and the LUAS stop is about a 10 min walk away.,4,2015,05,10
240,Very nice hotel! Hydropool excellent,"We stayed in Hilton Kilmainham for our 13th year anniversary. When we arrived in our room after 8 minutes a staff handed me a plate of dessert and a greeting card which I find very nice and the dessert is absolutely delicious. The room is quiet and nicely decorated with free bottles of sparkling water. The hydropool is excellent, jacuzzi, sauna and steam room. Would definitely recommend this hotel and will come back again. Taxi rank is just in front of hotel if you want to go to the city centre which will cost about ‚Ç¨12",5,2015,05,09
240,Noisy - doesn't deserve 4* rating,"We could hear banging in our room that sounded like weights being dropped on the floor. On ringing down to reception, they said they couldn't hear it and would go to the gym to check if that was the problem. We shortly left our room and when in reception, we could clearly hear the same noise. Still not sure what the noise was - was annoying that they said they couldn't hear it in the lobby.

Also charged for a call to a free phone number - this may be standard but not something I've experienced before.

Expensive parking.

Pros: comfortable rooms ",2,2015,05,06
240,Very nice hotel - back again,"This was our second stay at this hotel. Good Hilton standard. Our room was clean, comfortable and spacious. We frequently stay at the Hilton just for the comfort of the bed. Staff were extremely nice, helpful and friendly. There was a problem with loud music - from an adjacent room? - in the middle of the night which was taken care of promptly. Good and ample breakfast. We like the location of this hotel, as it's not right in the middle of Dublin, but within easy reach. Overall, a very positive experience, we will stay there again on our next trip to the city.",5,2015,05,06
240,Great Hotel - Great Location,"Stayed for just one night but was delighted with room, staff and location of hotel - only negative was the pool area but that was because we thought it was a swimming pool - its a hydro pool / spa but we thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience.",5,2015,05,05
240,Handy Location,"Rate as above average, handy location close to the railway station from where I took a short cab ride for ‚Ç¨8. First impressions are muted with an unimpressive looking building with extensive road works outside and restricted drop off area.
Warm welcome however and quickly checked in to room 428...good security with keyed access in the elevator past floor 2.
Room reasonable size and view out the front overlooking the historical Kilmainham Gaol, reasonable amenities, coffee / tea makings, iron and a fridge but no minibar contents. Bathroom reasonable size for one night and well lit with shower over tub.
Air con was difficult to control so left it switched off, free Wi Fi which kept dropping out...comfy nights sleep in the bed but there was intrusion of light through the curtains from the decorative hotel lights on the front of the building!
Room had a slightly musty smell as well which I presume was something to do with the drains.
Did not dine in the hotel choosing to eat accross the road, there is a convenience store two blocks down handy for supplies to place in the room fridge if you were staying for more than one night.
Breakfast on the Sunday morning was standard Hilton style buffet, place was busy and staff appeared harried, not many smiles and atmosphere flat and not a place to have a leisurely breakfast and read the papers!
Did not use any other facilities so could not comment on pool, car parking etc...reasonable stay though for one night...",3,2015,05,04
240,Good hotel - I want that bed!,"I'm giving this hotel a good rating, but I would like hotel management to contact me.  Check in desk staff were the best!  Very accommodating and helpful.  The room was clean, spacious,  and I got a good night's sleep.  The pool design was an experience!  The lounge was comfortable with good food.  The location great.  But.... when I checked out and reported that the room had no cold water in the shower, the check out staff was indifferent.  I did not discover it, of course, till just before leaving... jumping into the shower with just enough time to catch taxi and get to the airport..  What a shock to have only hot water, and very hot at that!  So there was nothing they could do to undo my situation, other than offer me a refund or comp of some kind..  but no, she did not... nothing but 'So sorry that happened to you'.  'Bye now'.  This had to be a fluke... something wrong with the shower handle valve.. and I would still try this hotel again.  But, management, please contact me and advise if Hilton offers some sort of credit when this happens.  ALSO, I would like to know how/where I can purchase a set of the sheets/douvet in CA King size.  Thank you.",4,2015,05,03
240,Better Than 3 Stars but Not Yet Ready to be 4 Stars,"I enjoyed the 2 nights I spent at the Hilton Kilmainham.  It is a pleasant hotel across the street from both the Kilmainham Goal and the grounds of the Museum of Modern Art.  The location of the hotel is in the western part of Dublin and you are a 40 minute walk to the centre of the city but only a 10 minute walk to the nearest light transit rail stop.  

My room was spacious and nicely furnished although for me the carpeting was due for a refresh.  The HVAC system in the room was easy to adjust and best of it was very quite.  The WiFi was OK for me although there were several occasions when it was really slow.  The staff was pleasant and helpful whenever I asked them a question. 

The fitness centre is better than most hotel gyms in terms of space and equipment but this is because the fitness centre at this hotel is also open to the public.  I was fine with this although when I worked out it was fairly busy as a result of this arrangement.  

There aren't that many good restaurants in the area other than the Limetree Cafe so you may have to rely on the kitchen at the hotel.  They serve OK food in my opinion;  nothing fancy but good enough to satisfy any appetite.  

I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel if you are looking for something not too expensive and you need to be in this part of Dublin.  For me, the next time I am in Dublin I  will likely stay closer to the the centre of town.",3,2015,05,03
240,Good business hotel. Quiet and comfortable.,"I stayed here for holidays. The hotel is modern, well equipped, a good restaurant and bar. 
Stayed in Rooms 309 and 317. Both rooms were quiet, clean and comfortable. Both rooms had average WIFI signal strength that dropped out regularly. WIFI was strong in the restaurant and bar area. Room service food was good. I got charged a 5 euro delivery fee. Ok fine, but the fee was not advertised on the menu. 

The Dublin Gaol is across the road and is a stop on the hop-on hop-off bus route. 

A good hotel, aimed at the business traveller. As per other reviews, this is a nice hotel with quiet rooms. I would stay here again.",4,2015,05,02
240,Bed and Breakfast 5/5 but don't expect service from staff,"Great breakfast buffet, definitely worth the extra on top of the room. Great choice of products to choose from but cooked breakfast could have been hotter. Outside area really nice in the sunny weather however there didn't seem to be any service. That said, breakfast servers didn't explain anything to us, or pour us any drinks, when every other customer had the full extra menu explained and coffees and teas poured for them which is appalling. 

The bed is unreal! Guaranteed an amazing nights sleep and blackout curtains make long lie ins possible. House keepers were good and will give you any requests that you have (extra toiletries). 

If you're young, don't expect to be treated with any respect and be prepared to show your room key AT ALL TIMES, as they will want proof that you're staying there. ""Contacting reception for anything you need"" doesn't happen- couldn't even have a hot drink at 11.30 at night as ""machines were off"". No aspect of trying to please us and didn't really care. 

If you're looking for a nice hotel with a spa this Isn't the one for you. Protocol isn't explained, Infact nothing is! Glass looking straight in from reception into the swimming pool and jacuzzi so you cannot relax. Staff down there weren't very friendly and expected everyone to know what they're doing and where to go.

I'll probably return when I'm ""at the right age"" ie 40 and might actually get some service for my money.",3,2015,04,30
240,Lovely stay,"We spent one night with our 13 year old son in a family room.  The room was very spacious and comfortable. In the morning we had a good swim before breakfast. All in all a very good stay, we wish it had been longer.",5,2015,04,28
240,great hotel,we have stayed at hilton 6 times . it is still as comfortable as always. it is one of the best hotels in dublin. rooms are spotless breakfast great and staff very friendly. location is good. it beside kilmainham jail and museum. i will definately stay again for a longer break . it is a great hotel to relax in,5,2015,04,28
240,"Excellent staff, big rooms, great breakfast","I would like to thank the front desk manager for her helpfulness when we had a problem with our reservation.  She bent over backwards to offer assistance to what was my mistake.  Our very clean family room was huge with an additional bed, not a cot for our child. VERY comfortable beds with lots of pillows and good linens. The family bath had a shower stall and a tub - well set up for families.  Good gym facilities, great buffet breakfast.  Hilton Kilmainham sets an example for other hotels to learn.",5,2015,04,26
240,A night in Dublin ,"Our hotel was clean, relatively large, and comfortable. In short it was everything you might expect from a Hilton.  

All the amenities were provided, soaps, shampoos, & wifi.

It's a 10 minute walk to heuston station. 

It's right across the street from the most recommended (to us) attraction in Dublin, the killmainham prison.
 All in all it was a nice stay. ",4,2015,04,25
240,Hilton on Lidl breaks,"Excellent hotel, spotlessly clean, near to railway station. Excellent value with Lidl Breaks  but set menu for restaurant poor. Meeting point staff in restaurant under trained. How recommend - Hotel needs to let people know which bus to us too and from hotel",4,2015,04,21
240,A GOOD HOTEL !,"It's a really good hotel. However, if you arrive to Heuston Station, ask to the information point as this hotel is not really easy to find if you go on feet. The restaurant is good and the breakfast as well. It is really quiet.",4,2015,04,20
240,Handy Location,"It's on the route of the Dublin City Bus tour which you can get on on O'Connell Street, it's a handy way to get about if you're not in a hurry and if you're there to specifically see Kilmainham Gaol like i was then you couldn't be any closer! If you were you'd be sitting in a cell! I enjoyed my stay and would recommend it as well as stay there again!",5,2015,04,18
240,Price changes within 2 minutes of booking-once flight paid for..,"Booked online for 2 nights 21-23rd April; price ¬£205.08. After entering card details to pay, message appears to say not confirmed. Then get a call the next day from a Spanish man saying the price has gone up to ¬£262.86.. 28% rise in price, so either take it book something else or lose flights costs. Can't judge the hotel itself, but some suspect sales tactics, the booking agent said the hotel sets the price and they cant control this, only the hotel. urge caution",1,2015,04,16
240,Excellent stay in the Hilton Kilmainham,Fabulous hotel with use of the leisure centre. The rooms are spacious and well decorated throughout. I was concerned when I saw our room was on the first floor overlooking the main door but I didn't need to worry as the windows are so thick you couldnt hear a sound from the road beneath. I ate in hotel and found the waiter extremely friendly and helpful. I would recommend this hotel and its great for a in the city hotel but not quite in the city,5,2015,04,16
240,Not impressed,"Check in was fast but it's not what we requested. We asked for high floor but got 1st floor. We have tried to call room service many times but it looks like nobody wants to answer phone. Room it self was ok but that's was it .. Toilet flusher was broken , plastick button was falling off. 
Breakfast - old Danish pastries it felt like eating a cardboard . And in general food was very bad . We ordered pica tart - it was some cheese on pitta bread and it was not tasty at all. Fish and chips - fish was over cooked . Only one thing I enjoyed was salad.
Mini fridge was broken when we arrived. It got replaced but still .. Not impressing at all.
Basically we will not be coming back and I will never recommend it to anyone to stay here especially eat here.
There is better and cheaper places in Dublin City centre to stay",1,2015,04,16
240,Excellent hotel,"Very nice hotel, it's out of the city centre but only a short bus or taxi away. It's right near the Kilmainham jail which is a worthwhile tour and a short walk from the Guinness factory. Hotel comes with free wifi and the restaurant/bar downstairs does excellent cocktails. We struck good weather on our visit and were able to walk the main road into temple bar, finding some very nice wee caf√©s along the way.",4,2015,04,15
240,Great up until...,"Myself my boyfriend and some friends stayed here last weekend for 1 night.  The receptionist was so nice recommending clubs and places to eat. The rooms were gorgeous and spacious. The pool area was amazing and was my favourite part of the hotel. Breakfast was included in the deal we booked. This is were we were let down, we felt like we were been attacked. Myself and my sister were going up to get drinks after been seated and a staff member called Catherine yelled at us in front of everyone asking what are we doing. I was humiliated as everyone looked over at us. On top of that she ignored one of our requests. I found her to be rude and abrupt and not friendly at all. In my opinion she let the hotel down.",4,2015,04,14
240,Well-run hotel,"Agree with the other reviews, it's a good hotel. Worth noting need swimming hats in the pool, they cost ‚Ç¨2 at the leisure reception. Although front desk brilliant at giving travel information, would be great if they also had some maps of local bus routes and details of how to pay the fares to hand out. The tram is 10 minute walk away and takes a few minutes to wind its way to the River before it goes straight into the City so we ended up using taxis most of the time - around ‚Ç¨10 to ‚Ç¨15 into the centre. Taxi drivers all so friendly and helpful. Taxi from airport was 20 minutes and ‚Ç¨40 - with bags would be too far to walk from the nearest airport coach stop at Heuston Station. Breakfasts were good, we went across the road to the Italian restaurant above the bar there for dinner which was excellent (much better than it looks from outside). Free wifi worked well for us all weekend.",4,2015,04,14
240,Fantastic trip,"I stayed for a weekend treat with my grandaughter we had a fantastic stay, Lovely rooms, lovely staff, Best feature was the food, we ate in the bar and had a meal in the restaurant my main course was amazing sauce was delish nicest meal i have had in a long time (cant remember what it was called but it was gammon and mash ) Walking distance to the zoo, the pool was great so relaxing with all the bubbles we loved it",5,2015,04,13
240,Pleasant break,Spent 2 nights here with my daughter. Very enjoyable relaxing time few wee hiccups with what was included in my deal but we got there in the end. Clean and pleasant hotel handy for easy access into dublin centre.,2,2015,04,12
240,Great service,"The entire staff of the Hilton Kilmainham, Dublin go out of their way to make guests feel welcome and anticipate your needs before you even ask them for assistance.  Great location with the Dublin Hop on Hop off bus stop just across the street providing guided tours all around Dublin.  For great service during a stay in Dublin this is a great choice.",5,2015,04,12
240,Great customer service.,We stayed here April 3 and 4th.  Amanda at the fronts desk went out of her way to help my daughter locate her missing Luggage.   The front desk was a+ on everything.   We are Hilton Diamond members and stayed here on points.  It was a great experience.   Ps ending our trip we stayed at the Shelbourne and their front desk gets a C.,5,2015,04,11
240,Great hotel if you don't need to be in the city center,"Great hotel, closely located to the Guinness storehouse and western part of town.
Staff is fantastic! Well trained, attentive, kind, truly amazing
Restaurant is good both for breakfast, dinner and to watch a football game by the bar",5,2015,04,09
240,Nice hotel,"Nice and friendly staff. 
Breakfast is a little bit the same everyday so when your there for a week it comes out of your nose. Bar is also very nice to visit. Good choice of beer and other drinks. Wifi Internet connection is poor of quality can be better if they use a different provider ",4,2015,04,08
240,"Great Hotel, Good Location, Friendly Staff",Stayed in this hotel for my husbands 30th.  Very clean hotel with friendly staff.  Also great location as not in centre so quiet but the Dublin Tour Bus leaves from outside hotel so great to use this to get about.  Would definitely stay again.,5,2015,04,08
240,It's the little touches that count,I had my 30th birthday party here in March and the hotel was ideally located for us. We also stayed the night. The room was spacious bed was very comfortable good view and the staff were amazing. Giulia had looked after my party arrangements and sent me a birthday card. Eli looked after me on the night and made sure everything was OK. Patrick was our lovely bar man who kept us entertained all night and was very polite and courteous. The staff also wrote happy birthday in rose petals on our bed which was a lovely suprise at the end of the night. Highly recommend this place to anyone,5,2015,04,07
240,Excellent hotel. Loved it and would highly recommend it!,"I stayed in this amazing hotel when I visited Dublin for a short break holiday with a friend and it was amazing. It was a twin bedroom and the beds were very comfortable. Overall the room was big, very nice and clean and the same for the bathroom. Breakfast was included in the price and it was very good. The bar and restaurant of the hotel were also very good and the stuff were very friendly and helpful. Lastly the leisure centre there was amazing and would highly recommend the jacuzzi for good relaxation. I'm definitely staying in this hotel again next time I'm in Dublin.",5,2015,04,04
240,Excellent Stay,From beginning to end the staff were extremely knowledgeable and helpful. Food choices were good and tasty. Room was comfortable. Loved the separate shower cubicle. I would totally recommend this hotel for your stay in Dublin.,5,2015,04,04
240,Home away from home,"With a warm Irish welcome, comfortable rooms, and, excellent breakfast, you couldn't ask for any more. The hotel is very well located for Dublin City Centre, and, easy access to the M50. Friendly, helpful staff, good facilities.    The overnight parking is expensive but the benefits of the hotel outweigh that  negative.  Can't wait to go back!",5,2015,04,02
240,"Visit to The Hilton Hotel, Charlemont, Dublin.","Another great visit to The Hilton Hotel, Charlemont for a rugby weekend.  Although we arrived early our room was ready being clean, tidy and comfortable. Good supply of toiletries supplied and replaced daily.  Superb service as usual in the 'Stil' by Patrick Quilty and his team.  The Stil menu has changed which offers a variety of hot and cold snacks and meals. The Stil was also able to offer a wide variety of food for our celiac friend who joined us for lunch. Well done üëèüëèüëè",5,2015,04,01
240,Lovely hotel,"Stayed here for a celebratory weekend. Contacted hotel beforehand and explained, to which they had put fruit and chocolate in our room with a birthday card - beautiful touch. Room was big with plenty of space (3 sharing). Breakfast was lovely, lots of variety. Taxi service just outside. 10min drive into main centre.Only problem was card was swiped on arrival, but paid cash on departure - took several emails and a week for the money to be returned to the bank account.",5,2015,04,01
240,Didn't work for me - Business Trip,"I travel a lot as part of my job and stay in Hotels on a regular basis so very unusual for me to write on TripAdvisor. However though the Hotel itself is a decent Four star certain things let it down. On check in the queue was large with only 1 person on, as it was late afternoon approaching early evening you'd expect more coverage to cope, which at first didn't seem the case. Although I'd already check in on line, the key(s) didn't work - four floor and after coming straight from the airport not ideal. Back to reception, on 2nd try key(s) still didn't work. So engineer sent up - the actual door needed reprogramming. Okay these things happen but it was all taken as this is the norm, obviously no issue for me to wait around in corridor with my bags in the meantime. To put this in perspective, other Brand Hotels I stay in would have made sure I was sat with a drink and turned it into a positive experience. Interesting to note when I went to get my keys re-programmed there were three people behind the front desk with NO one there to check-in. 
Going down to breakfast the next morning- not on the list, so more waiting around whilst this was sorted. Didn't take for ever but I'm looking out for these things by now.
Then on check-out, 1 person on desk with a customer whom had a three room booking. Again no support, even when I mentioned the need to get to my meeting (after waiting and waiting). In the end I had to simply had over my keys and leave - in 20 years I've never felt the urge to do this before, but after my previous experiences here simply accepted what looks like the norm.
Basically for a Brand hotel, I would imagine interested in regular business not the most impressive experience, fine if you've no time pressures - at all.",2,2015,03,31
240,Great Hilton,"Nice and clean hotel.  Good rate, especially for the location and hotel quality.  Bar had a great selection and was not overpriced.  I thought this was a good location for walking to major Dublin sites, although I do enjoy walking (Guinness was 15 minutes away, Temple Bar about 30 minutes).",5,2015,03,31
240,Weekend Break - couple,"The hotel, staff & facilities are brilliant!  The jacuzzi has the most powerful yets ever, perfect for de-stressing! The meals we had (breakfast & dinner) were of the highest quality, they were delicious!!! I can recommend this hotel to couples & families, and even  people wanting to party in the temple Bar district (as long as you don't mind a 10-15min taxi ride).",5,2015,03,31
240,"Beautiful hotel, bar slightly lets it down","upon arrival I was really impressed with the hotel, the decor, the rooms, the reception all looked amazing. Our stay was bliss, the beds were extremely comfortable and it was a great hotel.

The bar/service staff were incredibly poor. I had to wait 20 mins for a beer at 6pm even though the bar was empty and there 4 barmen behind the bar.  Service was painfully slow thereafter, to the point we left and went across the road. 

Ordered breakfast in bed and i answered the door in my underwear hoping to grab the tray and run back to bed but the waiter was rude and insisted I give him cash or card on the spot for delivery (‚Ç¨5.50) - he explained i couldn't simply pay on check out.  It made me uncomfortable. There were no robes either, which is odd for a hilton.

The good far outweighed the bad but management need to retrain their staff or replace them. Breakfast was horrible, sausages looked boiled and pale, cooking a full irish isn't rocket science.",4,2015,03,30
240,Hilton Hotel Heaven,"What can I say? Hotel Heaven ‚Äì YES IT WAS. This accommodation was sublime from start to finish. The was a top of the range hotel. The Rolls Royce of accommodation. 
The room was bright, luxurious,  comfortable,  modern and clean, the view was simply breath-taking and very peaceful. The hotel was not too central, no noise or mayhem, this way we got to taste the fruits of Dublin City in a tranquil hotel heaven and that is exactly what it was. The staff were super professional, nothing was too much trouble from the reception staff, restaurant staff and the housekeepers who were perfectionists at their jobs. The hotel was clean, quiet and magnificent, perfect for our first family holiday with our newborn baby. The food was cooked to perfection, breakfast and evening meals were out of this world, always a good choice for a vegetarian.  Free Wifi and underground parking. I absolutely cannot wait to return, in fact ‚Äì I might just book again now‚Ä¶the HILTON HOTEL HEAVEN.",5,2015,03,27
240,Great hotel in a quiet area,"Found this hotel to be very clean and updated. The staff was generous with their time, information and smiles. The breakfast had good options and was an easy in and out in order to get started on your day. The room was wonderful and the bed comfortable. Loved the bathtub!",5,2015,03,24
240,Enjoyable Bar food,"We had been regular visitors to this hotel for lunch or snacks but had stopped going there a while back due to the decline in both the service and food.We are now glad to say that having visited there last saturday for brunch we were a lot happier with both the service and food.We ordered the American pancakes which were delicious and came with 3 different toppings on the side - however at 10.50 euro it was a bit pricey for what you got.The other order was Eggs Florentine which was a lot better value for money at 11.50 euro - it came with 2 eggs on muffins , spinach and fried potatoes.All in all it was a good experience.",4,2015,03,24
240,Absolutely Marvellous,"We stayed at the Hilton on a deal with living social,which I think they should offer in the future.it was my husbands 40th and as well as having a card in the room they also had a selection of mini desserts with happy birthday written in chocolate on the plate,so thoughtful and kind. The room was amazing and totally faultless and I am very fussy so that's saying something.the service from the staff was spectacular, friendly and efficient.and the food was sublime.health suite was excellent and spotless. a quick workout then we relaxed in the hydrotherapy pool and steam room sauna and Jacuzzi. All in all a fantastic welcoming hotel with all the luxuries you need for an amazing night away. Thanku so much to all the staff at,the Hilton.",5,2015,03,23
240,Dublin Hilton Kilmainham,"Great hotel with nice location, 10 minute taxi ride from city center.  Friendly and helpful staff.  We especially appreciate Anne Marie!  Very nice rooms with comfortable beds!  Delicious buffet breakfast.  Eating here is a great way to start the day, instead of having to hunt down a restaurant in city center.  The Kilmainham Gaol is across the street, a great tour that shouldn't be missed.  A lot of interesting history about Dublin.  We recommend taking taxis to and from the city center, instead of the bus...about the same price, and much more convenient!",5,2015,03,22
240,Business trip to Dublin,"stayed here recently on a business trip to Dublin and it proved to be a great location to access our offices at Park West and also be close enough to the city centre to be able to enjoy evenings in Temple Bar.
Nice hotel with very friendly staff, who were happy to assist with everything I asked. Bar and restaurant were good and breakfast was excellent. I would really reccomending if you want to come to Dublin but don't want to stay right in the middle of the city",4,2015,03,20
240,I loved it!,"We stayed at the Hilton Kilmainham for Valentine's weekend and had a great time! The ladies in the front reception were super resourceful, especially Anna. They gave us suggestions on what museums to visit, where to go for dinner and a Celtic performance. Its also great because its across the street from the museum of Modern Art and Kilmainham jail. You can catch the hop on hop bus right there because it stops at the Jail. So we took the hop on hop bus from oconnel st and got to our hotel. overall just a great and romantic experience and we owe it mostly to the Anna and the rest of the staff at the hilton that were very resourceful! Plus Irish people are just overall sweet!!",4,2015,03,19
240,Excellent hotel (though not city centre),"My wife and I stayed here a few weeks ago when in Dublin to see 6 nations rugby. We had a great stay - parking was convenient, room was very nice and the food was great (dinner in the bar and breakfast).

Only (small) gripe was that the hotel advertises as being close to the city centre, but it's certainly not close enough to walk. Bus and DART are nearby though, so all in all it's still quite convenient.",5,2015,03,18
240,Good Location - Great Staff,Have stayed at this hotel two or three times now for both business and pleasure.  Rooms are a good size and well fitted out.  Modern style to the hotel and very attentive staff throughout.  Handy car parking under the hotel and only a short LUAS or Taxi ride into the heart of Dublin,4,2015,03,17
240,Aging Core,"I don't mind staying a little bit outside of the center, there are advantages (price, quietness). The hotel is in a good location - the Kilmainham jail (a toruist site), is right across the street, a short walk up the hill and to the left or a short walk down the hill and to the right and you can pick up a bus to the train station or to the city center. Costs about 30-35 Euro to get there from the airport via taxi (any more than that where the meter is, so you can see it for yourself).
The breakfasts were great, one order can feed two.
Staff member were friendly.
My main gripe - the first day there - the water boiler wasn't working so there was no hot water, call me a princess but I like warm to hot showers to start/end my day. Took the hotel a few hours to resolve that.  Then a few days later we were up at 5am to get ready to meet a tour group - again there was a water issue - there was no water in any of the rooms this time. Took them about another hour / hour and a half to resolve the issue this time and they paid for a taxi to take us to our tour group.
Secondary gripe - when I made the reservation I used a discount code that included daily breakfast, however it was not reflected on the reservation and I had not printed the confirmation page where it stated the meal was part of the price (my fault). So take note and print a copy of your reservation if you have any special discounts/deals.",3,2015,03,15
240,Nice Hilton in Dublin,"Nice Hilton Hotel.  We choose it as it had a pool, family room, looked modern and was a reasonable price.  All these worked out well.  Friendly staff, clean comfortable rooms, not to crowded with the extra bed.  Location has plus and maybe a minus depending on what you want.  Slightly out of the town centre, it is a 15 mins walk down to Dublin Heuston station (and up coming back) and from here you can catch the bus to the airport and/or the tram into town which is only 10 mins away ‚Äì trams very regular.  We bought a 72 hour pass for the tram (LAUS) /bus/DART (Dublins commuter railway) and this worked well ‚Äì taking the hassle out of having to buy tickets every time.  Buy at the airport when you arrive, valid from when you first use (Called LEAP visitor card ‚Äì or something like that).  There is a slightly closer tram stop to the hotel, slightly harder to find, and a few more minutes on the tram to get into town.  Just across the road from the hotel is the Kilmainham Gaol ‚Äì a must see if you are a first time visitor Dublin for a great understanding of how Eire gained independence and the Easter uprising, its leaders and the execution.  You could walk from the hotel into town if you feel energetic ‚Äì probably 30 mins to the Guinness Storehouse and then maybe another 30 into the main town.  Use the bus if you have a pass ‚Äì the hotel will tell you which ones.  Also out with 20-30 mins walk of the hotel is Phoenix park and Dublin Zoo ‚Äì we did not visit on this occasion.",4,2015,03,14
240,great hotel,"Stayed here whilst in Dublin for the weekend and we were not  disappointed at all! The spa pool is extremely nice with jets and other feature include a sauna and gym. However if you would like to make use of the pool you need a swimming hat for hygiene reasons.  The room was really nice and spacious with good facilities, it is also spotless. This is a great hotel and i would definitely recommend if you are visiting Dublin.",5,2015,03,14
240,Great hotel,"Free wi-fi, reasonable parking charge, great location and staff were very helpful indeed.   Rooms were incredibly spacious and generally very, very impressive. Hotel is in a great central location and I would definitely return.",5,2015,03,13
240,Pure luxury,"Fabulous hotel. Great location, easy to get to Dublin city centre by Dublin bus or by taxi. Comfortable, bright spacious room. Friendly atmosphere, helpful staff. Great selection of breakfast! A top class hotel :)",5,2015,03,10
240,Amazing hotel,"I stayed here with my family to celebrate my son's 8th birthday. We booked the package, breakfast, dinner, two adjoining rooms and 4 tickets to Dublin Zoo, we got this for the bargain price of 300euro.

From start to finish the staff here were superb. The hotel itself is in a super handy location very close to many attractions and visitor locations. 

We arrived early morning, lifted our tickets for the zoo and went on to enjoy a wonderful day there.

When we returned we checked in and went to our rooms, both huge, immaculate, lovely views and very modern and comfortable.

My husband took the two boys to The pool where the receptionist in the spa, when realising it was my sons birthday, served him with a selections of cakes and pastries when he left the pool. 
The dinner was beautiful, a lovely menu and the staff & restaurant spoiled my son making him feel very special as they wished him a happy birthday and sang to him when they brought his cake out. 
Breakfast was lovely- again after choosing from an array of food the kitchen sent both of the children fresh pancakes, with a selection of honey,  chocolate & jam compote. Pancakes were amazing!!!

We had a fantastic stay here & would highly, highly recommend it to anyone. ",5,2015,03,08
240,Great time ,"I took my 2 kids 11 and 3 away for 2 nights we all enjoyed it, we arrived in the morning  even no the room wasn't gonna be ready till 3 the hotel let us check in and took our bags so we didn't have to wander around with them and they got our room sorted so quick we didn't have any time to wait, we got a room with a giant bed and also a big single bed the room was lovely really clean and it had a beautiful bathroom with a bath and a shower, loads of space in our room massive sliderobe wardrobe, big window and nice view see out on the street there was a castle or something like it across from the hotel nice walk with the kids nice bar/restaurant on the corner across from us really local to bus and tram line and close enough to walk to the zoo, we had room service 1 night it was great arrived quick nice food not to expensive and staff very friendly and helpful, used the hydro pool was lovely and clean and great fun, the only prob we did have was with breakfast it's over at 10 which is fine but the start to clear everything away to soon we felt like we were being a bit rushed outta the restaurant, all in all we had a great few days away enjoyed by all, staff in the hotel were so nice and helpful would definitely go back great break ",5,2015,03,07
240,"Nice Hotel, Better Staff","I stayed at the Hilton Dublin Kilmainham for 2 weeks while working in Dublin.  The hotel has all of the amenities that one could need.  The front desk staff, awesome.  Particularly Ana who spent the time to go over places to see while I was here.  Ana was the shining light for the hotel.  The restaurant was pretty good but the wait staff was a bit slow with service.  Don't get me wrong.  The wait staff was very friendly and the food was good, just sometimes slow.  Overall, I would stay here again when I come back.

Thanks Ana",4,2015,03,06
240,Stopped for some lunch.,"We wern't staying at this hotel we had been across the road visiting the Kilmainham jail and decided to pop in for some lunch. They have a selective brunch menu (with a lot of egg dishes on it). We opted for an omlette and club sandwich. Service was quick and prices were reasonable for a Hilton hotel which are usually classed as a high end expensive hotel chain. Our lunch was lovely, fresh and big portions! Would come back in here and definitely try the pancakes!",4,2015,03,03
240,Lovely hotel,Stayed there in February of 2014 with my daughter and her family. It is a lovely hotel the rooms are comfortable.  There is coffee pot in the room with coffee and a selection of teas. A comfy robe and slippers just waiting for you to put them on. Our rooms had a city view with beautiful green mountains off in the distance. The room had a very comfortable king sized bed t.v. and internet. I have Hilton rewards and was offered the breakfast buffet.  Trust me when I say you won't be disappointed. I plan on returning next year.,5,2015,02,26
240,Why bother?,"On booking form under requests I asked for a high room at the back. They gave me a low room at the front.
Only there for a night so didn't create a fuss, but in retrospect I should have asked for a change. The point is, I shouldn't have to.Hotel didn't seem anywhere near full.
In fairness I must say the room lovely and the bed comfortable. Breakfast room dimly lit. It's fine to create an atmosphere for dinner, but for breakfast a bit of light is required.",3,2015,02,26
240,Second stay...,"Having stayed here a few years ago and really enjoying it, it seemed the obvious place to stay when returning to Dublin.

LOCATION - the hotel is located in Kilmainham which is around a 30 minute walk from the city centre. There are two ways you can go - one is down past a the Guinness Factory and the other is up the Liffy. We both enjoying walking so the location isn't a problem for us. If you're not a walker, there is local transport. The benefit of the hotels location is the away from it all feel and also it's quieter than some city centre hotels.

RECEPTION - the reception area is very nice with plenty of seating. The reception staff are very welcoming and friendly. They're very efficient and quick and also offer information on the local area. We arrived around 3pm which is the normal check in time.

ROOM - we were upgraded to a deluxe room which had a balcony - it was very nice and the balcony was a very nice touch. The room had a king size bed which was very comfortable, a large TV, tea & coffee making facilities and then other amenities you'd expect from a Hilton hotel. My only criticism with the room was that it didn't have a bath. We were allocated a disabled room so the bathroom had a wet room - it would of been nice to of been told at check in, but at the same time I should of requested a room with a bath. Overall the room was very comfortable, spacious and well equipped. 

FACILITIES - the hotel is well equipped and includes leisure facilities. There's a swimming pool, sauna, gym and jacuzzi. The facilities are nice and have clean and spacious changing rooms. Although we didn't spend a lot of time in the pool etc, it's really nice to be able to enjoy a swim and a jacuzzi in such nice surroundings,

BREAKFAST - breakfast has to be one of the main highlights of this hotel for me. There's so much choice even a fussy eater would struggle to find fault. There's a variety of cereals, muffins, cakes, yogurts, smoothies, breads plus all of the hot items. If you're staying at the hotel or thinking of staying, make sure you have breakfast - it'll definitely set you up for the day!!

Overall the hotel was just as fantastic as I'd remembered and I'll definitely be staying again on my next visit to Dublin.... Thanks Hilton Dublin Kilmainham, another brilliant stay!!",4,2015,02,25
240,The Best Birthday Party,"Superb accommodation,excellent service,very good range of facilities and engaging and helpful staff.  The management were very understanding as the party relocated in the lobby after 2am and we were allowed to continue the festivities (which included a bit of a sing-song) until 5am which was much appreciated by us all.  Highly recommended.",5,2015,02,23
240,Superb service at front desk,"Excellent check-in and check-out service from Ana at front desk; room was comfortable, quiet and stylish; close to city centre. One complaint re unacceptable room service food quality and price was handled very well by front desk. We will be back",5,2015,02,23
240,Ticks all the boxes.,"We stayed here on a short break as a family of four. We got an excellent rate which convinced us as we thought that the location might be a bit out from the centre. However the hotel is close to Heuston station and Luas stops so wasn't really a problem. The hotel rooms were spotlessly clean, spacious and well equipped. All the staff were very helpful and polite. The spa and gym were excellent as was the breakfast, although we didn't eat in the restaurant what I saw of the food looked fine. We will definitely return.",5,2015,02,22
240,Top Class Hotel,Stayed here for two nights and were sorry to leave. The room was excellent with a view of the Kilmainham goal. The breakfast was also excellent and the staff through out the hotel were very professional and friendly. We had access to the gym and all the facilities which were also excellent. We will certainly be back and would highly recommend it. Not too far from the city centre and easily reached by bus. Phoenix Park is also within walking distance.,5,2015,02,21
240,Real Irish Hospitality,"An excellent break one or two things concerned me on arrival, the busy main road past the hotel and the the parking area. However, there was nothing to be concerned about our room was great and very quiet little noise from the traffic and we were on a lower floor. The room was great as were the facilities but it was the friendliness of the staff that caused me to grade it as excellent.",5,2015,02,21
240,brilliant,"Lovely hotel, friendly staff and would definitely recommend. Stayed for one night and room was lovely, very spacious and clean. Cant commebt on food as didnt eat here but the cocktails in the hotel bar are a must have!!",5,2015,02,20
240,Excellent Stay,A wonderful stay at Hilton Dublin Kilmainham. We arrived at 11am and were able to check in which was wonderful. As we arrived on Shrove Tuesday it was lovely to be offered complimentary pancakes with a range of toppings. We recived excellent customer service and the staff were all knowledgeable. The room was large and clean and we had a great view over Kilmainham Hospital gardens. Our safe initially didn't work but one phone call to reception and that was soon remedied. It was over the road from Kilmainham Gaol and a 10 min walk from the nearest tram stop. Great to have free wifi and the breakfast was truly superb! An excellent stay!,5,2015,02,20
240,A good business hotel,"This is a high standards hotel in Dublin. No doubts.
I used this hotel few times and everytime i stayed there I had nothing to complain.
If I have to say something negative about the hotel, I would say is quite far away from the Temple Bar. You need a taxi /bike if you don't want to walk 30 min.

240,Lovely hotel with fantastic breakfast,"My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights in a king room with breakfast included. We arrived a few hours before we were allowed to check in to drop our bags off, but the receptionist was very friendly and kind and found a room for us there and then and we were allowed to check in immediately. The room was on the first floor and was very spacious, clean with a very large bed and separate bathroom. Unfortunately the in-room safe didn't work and so a lady was sent up within a few minutes to investigate. The safe was bust so we were offered a new room or to put our valuables the reception's safe. We chose the later option as we had already unpacked and we only wanted to lock away our boarding passes and passports. We picked these up as we checked out without any problem. 
The breakfast was great and very reasonable extra on top of the room price. The breakfast room was very stylish and grand. There was a fantastic choice of continental breakfast foods like fruits, pastries, yogurts, meats and cheeses, different juices and smoothies, cereals, gluten free options, breads and a toaster and the usual cooked breakfast options. Coffee or tea was served by the hardworking staff. I noticed that the breakfast staff were always playing catch up with clearing and setting the tables. They were extremely busy and having to work very hard, so maybe more breakfast staff are required? It didn't affect our level of service however. 
We used the gym which was complimentary and was very well equipped with treadmills, bikes, rowing machines, cross trainers, free weights and benches and quite a few different resistance weight machines. The pool, jacuzzi and saunas looked great too but we didn't get the chance to use them.
The hotel is very conveniently located opposite the Kilmainham Gaol and where the hop on/hop off bus stops which we used a lot. Other local buses also stopped here. Taxis cost around ‚Ç¨10 into the centre of town even late in the evening. The Luas/tram (Suir Road is the closest stop - red line) is less than 10 minutes leisurely walk away which goes straight into the town and all the way to the docklands. 
We caught the air link bus which leaves from Heuston station every 15 minutes which is around 20 minutes walk away which was the cheapest option to get to and from the airport.  
All the staff were super friendly and helpful and gave advise on good places to drink and eat in town. 
I will definitely stay here again if I ever come back to Dublin and have already recommended it to friends and family!",5,2015,02,18
240,Beautiful hotel,"Stayed here for Valentine's Day 2015, and it did not disappoint. Our room had a balcony over looking the gaol. Not too far away from the city centre, which was easy to get to via #13 or #40 bus or taxi. Within walking distance of Guinness Storehouse too. 
All hotel staff very friendly and helpful with directions. Didn't have any food in the hotel, so cannot comment and we didn't use the spa/gym either. We would definitely stay again.",5,2015,02,16
240,The Perfect 1st Valentine's Together,"Couldn't fault this hotel, staff or facilities in anyway. Me & my partner booked an over night stay in order to celebrate our first valentines together and it was perfect.
The communication from Ana, Aoife & Mihaela in order for me to make our dinner reservation in the Cinnamon restaurant and to also organise a wee surprise (rose petals on the bed in the shape of a heart, fresh strawberries with chocolate dips & a personalised card) for my partner upon our arrival was fantastic. They were extremely helpful and my partner absolutely loved the surprise.
All staff were fantastic during our stay but while we were dining in the Cinnamon restaurant Stephen took care of us and he was extremely polite, friendly & helpful.
The spa was lovely and although I didn't use the gym it was extremely well equipped compared to the usual rubbish you get at hotels.
Our ""kings view room"" was AMAZING, it was extremely spacious and well equipped with a breathtaking view.
The best part though had to be our valentines meal in the cinnamon restaurant, the food was INCREDIBLE and we didn't have to wait for ages after ordering for our starter to arrive at the table and then for each course after that we were asked if we were ready for it and then it arrived 2 minutes later which in my opinion is how a restaurant should be run. We will definitely be back.",5,2015,02,15
240,Decent,Pretty good nice rooms and a great location the staff are very friendly but the restaurant is rather expensive. The gaol opposite is a stop for the hop on hop off busses so no problems about travelling there is also a bus stop and tram station within walking distance so plenty of options are available. Overall a very nice stay!,4,2015,02,15
240,Excellent,"Stayed here for 2 nights in January, we have stayed at many hotels in Dublin but this is easily the best. Rooms great, breakfast spot on and the spa tops it off. Got a deal at ¬£50 per night including breakfast so cheapest we have paid in Dublin too. About 2 mile to temple bar etc but that didn't bother us at all. Would definitely recommend staying here.",5,2015,02,12
240,Fab,Gorgeous hotel with clean rooms and helpful staff. Very stylish. Great location.  We ate lunch which was tasty and had a great range of food on the menu. Returning next week for dinner and an overnight stay and can't wait!,5,2015,02,11
240,weekend stay,"Lovely hotel fantastic breakfast and great staff would stay again lovely italian resturant opposite and patriots pub had a brilliant atmosphere ,lovely walk into the city or could catch a tram or bus easy to get to airport by buses or hotel will arrange a taxi",5,2015,02,10
240,Lovely stay....,"We were there in January (20th - 24th) and had a lovely stay.  Despite its modern appearance, this hotel is homely and friendly and the staff are delightful, warm and friendly.  Dublin is a great city, but I'm biased having been born there!

Our visit was for family research and for anyone else on this mission go to the National Library of Ireland, Bishops street, where they have Geanealogists to assist you with your research (free).  We also visited the General Records Office (Werburgh Street office) where you can search through records and order certificates etc....and you can park right outside! 

I would definitely recommend this hotel.  Lovely room, huge comfy bed, nice bar for a drink and a meal in the evening at a reasonable cost, as well as a restuarant.  And last, but not least, a nice sauna, steam room, pool and jacuzzi to relax in after a day on your feet!

Location is not right in the centre of town, but close enough, and the Dublin tour bus stops right opposite the hotel, outside Kilmainham Gaol Museum, which takes you through all the main attractions - and you can hop on and off which is great. 

Hope this helps and that you enjoy your visit!!",5,2015,02,06
240,"Excellent evening and stay, within a short trip of Dublin city centre","To be fair, we don't get out a lot.  2 little darlings and house down the Country mean that the (very!) occasional weekend/night away in he ""big smoke"" is to be done with planning - and done right :)

The booking experience was V Positive - mainly due to the price via my discount membership - exceedingly good value (‚Ç¨81)for a hotel only a stones throw from the city center (under a ‚Ç¨10 from the far side of the city on a busy Saturday night). for two - including breakfast!

First impressions were really positive also on arrival - modern and airy, clean and with some of the best customer service I have encountered in a long while.  Often customer facing staff can be brusque or not interested, the front of house team at Kilmainham were excellent, with genuine warmth and personality being evident.

Our first pleasant surprise was the free upgrade to one of the larger rooms with a balcony and view of the Gaol on the top floor, due to it being our anniversary.  The room was a very good size for city hotel and sparklingly clean with a 42 inch flatscreen, king size bed and large walk in shower type bathroom.

We then tried out the bar for lunch and was pleasantly surprised for the quality of the steak sandwich and weisbeer provided.  Although it wasn't cheap, the quality was definitely there and the food was very good indeed.  Again the staff were personable and helpful, without being intrusive.  Often a very hard combination to find.

After a great evening out in Dublin, we came back (late!) to find a plate of little cakes in our room with a ""Happy Anniversary"" message written in chocolate on the plate - together with a little card.  These are the things that make the difference.

After a very pleasant nights sleep, breakfast was also good - served in the restaurant, generally the hot buffet was very good - with the scrambled eggs being of particular note - often they can either be rubbery or mush - these were very good.  They also provide a chef service if you require poached eggs et al.

It has been a long, long time since we stayed and partied in Dublin - possibly since before the crash - but this has been one of the better experiences we have had - in any city.  The hotel went some way to this and I can't stress enough how good the service we received was, or the quality of the food and rooms overall.  Once you factor in the excellent price, you can't really lose on this one...

Thanks to all the team in Kilmainham Hilton!",5,2015,02,05
240,Great standard and excellent service,I stayed in this hotel with my 20 year old daughter who surprised me with a weekend in the city for my birthday and I wasn't disappointed. We had a spacious clean comfortable room with a nice view and a gift of cakes and fruit was waiting for me in the room with a birthday message in chocolate which was a lovely touch. The breakfast was delicious with lots of choice and the scotch pancakes cooked to order were fantastic. We had room service bring up some prosecco and the service was swift and not over priced. Overall we had a lovely stay with excellent service. The hotel isn't in the centre of town but a small reasonable bus service is nearby.,5,2015,02,04
240,Great Hotel,Stayed with my husband on 1st of Feb 15 and 28th Dec 14. On check in in December our room was not ready ( I was probably early ) we were offered coffee which I accepted but there was a mix up and because of this I was given an upgrade to a fantastic suite. Staff are fantastic with the exception of the bar where the tall bar man is extremely efficient but not so sure ablut the bar food waiting staff. Overall I would not let that put me off going back (which I will be soon) Great location with a lovely bar accross the road. Give it a try.,4,2015,02,04
240,Exquisite place to stay,"This was a 2 day short stay for my wife and I and our overall experience here was wonderful. I would like to highlight the excellent service from the reception staff,  (particularly Ann-Marie).
It was very tidy and clean and beautifully decorated and the staff could not have been more helpful. My only dissatisfaction was the Sunday morning buffet breakfast, which was indescribably bad, empty serving dishes, cold food, congealed beans and fatty, greasy bacon. A lot of unhappy customers. However the next morning the breakfast was cooked to order and was superb!",5,2015,02,03
240,Weekend visits,"My wife and I have stayed at this hotel three times now, and have enjoyed our stays, the rooms have been of a high standard and the meals very good, the staff are very helpful and can't do enough to help although bar prices are not cheap, the choices are good. The Dublin Zoo is within walking distance as is the National Museum of Ireland and the Guinness storehouse all well worth a visit, and the Kilmainham Goal is also well worth the time to visit...........we will be visiting again",5,2015,02,01
240,Pleasant ,"We stayed in this hotel  in January  on a great value winter dinner, bed and breakfast deal booked through the Hilton website. We have stayed in this hotel twice before. It seemed to have been refurbished since our last visit. Family room was spacious and very clean. Nice separate bath and shower with good toiletries. The dinner was very pleasant with very nice staff that brought our desserts to our room for us as it was late and our little girl was very tired. Most comfortable bed I have slept on in a long time. All round very pleasant and relaxing stay.",4,2015,01,30
240,Lunch disaster.,We booked a table in the bar of this hotel for 7 people on a Friday in January @ 1.oop.m.  When the girl came to take our order she didn't have very much english and didn' seem to understand us. She took the order for the starters and main course.  Five members of our party ordered the cod only to be told a few minutes later that there was no cod left.  (FRIDAY LUNCH TIME). Then we ordered 2  bottles of wine only to be asked how many glasses would she bring. One person asked for a bottle of Cidona and they hadn't any. Two of our party ordered starters and were almost finished their main course when she came along with the rolls for the soup starter which never arrived. We politely told them that the starter wasn't required at this time. This was a family get together for a member of our party who was home on holiday. The whole thing was a shambles and embarrassing. I don't blame the young girl for it. There was no one overseeing the way things were running in the restaurant. However we did get a reduction on our bill but we would have preferred a better service.,3,2015,01,26
240,needs restauration,"We have stayed during two nights. Breakfast was ok and also the dinner on 31 th december. We had a normal bedroom, but not one we are used in a Hilton Hotel. The building needs a good restauration.  At the other hand, the Staff was very friendly and the prices not to outstanding!",3,2015,01,26
240,Excellent,"Unfortunately we stayed in Hilton only one night!!! It was very enjoyable, but had to go back home. Room was beautiful, large, lovely clean bathroom, on the top floor with massive window and lovely view of Dublin. Bed was really comfortable. Staff was very nice and helpful. The hotel its self is located few miles away from the city centre, but it's well accessible and even public transport is convenient enough, all direction can be easily obtained at the front desk. We decided to leave the car on the car park and took the tram to get to the city centre. Worked out well. 
The best part of the stay was the breakfast. So much choice, and everything so nice. It was also great value for money. Highly recommended.",5,2015,01,26
240,Not central,"Back from a weekend in Dublin just a few days ago. Had a great time. The staff were all very welcoming and efficient. Breakfast offered a great choice of fruits, breads, cereal, cold meat, cooked breakfast, porridge, pastries etc... We would have loved to use the spa facilities but unfortunately we had no choice. The occasion was my partner's birthday and we really appreciated the lovely touch on arrival: a few pastries laid out on a plate with a chocolate message: Happy Birthday. The hotel is situated just across from the Kilmainham jail which gets fully booked every day very quickly so this was very handy to be able to get a ticket, however if you are depending on taxis and public transport then it's not so handy. I guess if the weather is nice and you don't mind a good walk you could manage to get to the city centre in 30 mns, however it was freezing when we went there. I would recommend this hotel to business people rather than to tourists for this reason.",4,2015,01,25
240,Excellant hotel,"Just stayed in this hotel for one night. Lovely hotel, very clean and modern. Really friendly staff in bar, restaurant and at reception. They all put great effort on being approachable and helpful.  Great bedroom loads of space and well fitted out. Fantastic Tv, Wish i had it at home. Nothing wrong here worth complaining about.",5,2015,01,21
240,Kilmainham Hilton Dublin,"Lovely hotel. Restaurant was excellent,breakfast was a wide and varied selection which also had a great time slot from 7.00 to 11.00 am for late risers.The staff were extremely friendly and always willing to help. The hotel has excellent pool and gym facilities. It also has very easy access to Dublin town centre",4,2015,01,21
240,Great Location friendly staff,"I stay here frequently on business and find the Facilities, staff and location excellent.  Rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable and Wifi is FOC.  Parking is available at a charge of ‚Ç¨9 per night which is comparable to other hotels in the area.",5,2015,01,19
240,Good hotel,"Nice modern Hilton hotel as you would expect spacious room and friendly staff, good breakfast with plenty of choice. Five minute walk to Luas Would return to this hotel when visiting Dublin again......",4,2015,01,18
240,Fantastic Staff!,"My husband and I enjoyed a very relaxing one night break at the hotel at the beginning of January 2015.  We upgrading to a Junior Suite and were more than delighted with our room which included a very large balcony with a beautiful view.   During the booking process I had mentioned in passing that we had recently celebrated our wedding anniversary and was stunned to find a beautiful plate of mini deserts with 'Happy Anniversary' in chocolate lettering upon entering our suite, an incredibly thoughtful gesture.

We had dinner at the hotel and again were very impressed, the food was delicious and the service was second to none.  A big thank you to the restaurant staff who really made our evening.

The following morning after what could possibly be described as 'the best hotel breakfast ever'  - extensive range to select from all of which was of a very high quality (take away coffee was included!) we made our way to the Spa.   Staff here were (again) very friendly and informative, we did not use the gym however it looked very modern and well equipped.  The hydro-pool, steam room and sauna were all very well appointed and a very relaxing time was had.

Initially I was concerned about the proximity to Dublin City Centre however the LUAS stop is a mere 5 - 10 minute stroll from the hotel, furthermore there seems to be a steady stream of taxis outside the hotel and a bus also stops nearby.  For those feeling more energetic there is also a bank of hire bicycles situated across from the hotel.

Based on my experience I would give this hotel 10/10 for everything apart from the staff . . . who I would give 20 out of 10 (if I could!!!).   Everyone we encountered was warm, friendly, professional and informative - absolutely fantastic.  

Thank you for a lovely break, we hope to return very soon.",5,2015,01,14
240,Excellent,"The walkway into the hotel was really slippy and nearly slipped several times. Also our shower was ridiculous.  It was a mixer shower but it kept gping from really cold to piping hot. So I fidnt enjoy my shower. Had to pay ‚Ç¨12 car park which I think is a joke. If it is a hotel car park it should be free to their customers that stay overnight.

On arrival the hotel looked really nice and had lots of neons outside the building which I like as they are goibg for the whole modern style. Staff were ok nothing special. Room was lovely but we did pay for it. Nice big 42inch led screen too.",4,2015,01,14
240,Clean & Friendly,Extremely clean hotel and friendly staff. Very relaxed atmosphere.  Hotel was quiet on the Sunday night that I arrived.  Great workspace in bedroom.  Bedroom was to front of hotel - roadside.  When I stay again I would ask for a room to the back of the hotel.,5,2015,01,14
240,Disappointed,"When you stay at a Hilton hotel, you expect a certain level of service and attention to detail. This hotel had dirty towels in our bathroom on our first day there and on our last morning a member of the staff let themselves in to our room without knocking while my wife was sitting naked in front of the mirror. When I spoke to the duty manager I was simply told sorry I will speak to housekeeping. I am very far from impressed by the staff training at this hotel. ",2,2015,01,12
240,Nearly perfect stay!,"We spent 1 night here occupying 2 adjoining rooms.   We checked in early and the front desk was able to assign us into 1 of the rooms, but we would have to wait for the other as it was still occupied.  We appreciated the early check in. As we were all very sick with the flu.  

The first room was huge with a king sized bed and another twin bed beside it.  The view was spectacular, directly overlooking the old city jail. Everything was immaculate.   

Later in the afternoon, the second room became available and it had 2 twin beds.  Again, the room was huge and spotless.  

We did have some technical issues with a phone not working, housekeeping entering the room while we were in it, and temperamental  lights, but all were minor details.  The staff is very warm and helpful.  

We took room service dinner at the hotel and they allowed us to order from the room service and restaurant  menus.  The food was fabulous; some of the best in our 23 day European adventure.  Highly recommend the pea soup, roast chicken, and the adult homemade cheeseburger.  Exactly what my sick family needed.  

Overall this is the best Hilton property I've stayed at in years and easily outclasses the competition.   It is centrally located near dining, laundry, groceries, petrol, and a tram station to run you into Central Dublin.  I'm only sorry we couldn't have stayed longer.  This hotel should be the first choice for the business or family traveler.  ",5,2015,01,12
240,Amazing staff elevates a hotel with room for improvement!,"If you're on holiday this is a good base. It's not exactly centrally located. But all the bus tours stop across the street. And it's not too far from the airport although beware taxi travel is quite expensive in Dublin (‚Ç¨40). 

The hotel is mostly what you would expect from a Hilton. Clean, good-sized rooms, well-lit and with the extra bonus of a swimming pool and good fitness facilities. Oh - and free no-hassle WIFI. 

However there were issues. Our room - 208 had something very wrong with the water mixer in the shower. Without moving the dial it goes from the temperature you set to boiling hot and then cold and then back to the temperature you set. Made for a horrific shower experience with lots of dancing stepping in and out of the stream. It going absolutely scalding is definitely a health and safety risk that should be looked it. Very dangerous. 

They also give exactly 2 towels for 2 guests - god forbid you should have to wash your hair. And even if you call down for an extra - the next day it's removed and not replaced so you have to call again. They are also a bit mean with the toiletries. They were especially tiny - & just one of each. So again - you have to call Housekeeping for reinforcements. 

We also had an incident with the dessert at dinner with an apple and blackberry crumble that was made during the First World War was gummy like glue and had no hint of a crumble - that we had to send back. 

But even with all those things I still give them 3 stars. Why? Every staff member I encountered was incredible. Special shout out to Ana. We arrived in reception the first day with no idea what we were doing or where we were going. She asked us a few questions about what we would like and she whipped out a map, giving us advice, marking the best attractions and tours, making restaurant recommendations and marking those as well and helping us get around. She followed up the next day to see how we got on. Amazing service! Gold star! She needs some kind of prize or something! 

In the restaurant as well everyone was attentive and crumble-gate was swiftly handled with a removal of the item from our bill and an offer to replace it. 

This would have been a different review without their amazing staff. ",3,2015,01,11
240,Kilmainham Hilton,"I found this property to be very nicely appointed. It was close to where I was doing business during my stay. Only down side was that it is a good cab ride into Dublin proper around 15 euro on way, a fantastic property otherwise. I would stay here again and recommend to friends.",5,2015,01,11
240,Excellent staff,Stay regularly on business at this Hilton and the staff couldn't be more helpful or responsive.   Makes staying there on business a pleasure.  Located a bit of a way out of Dublin city centre - but it's only a few minutes walk to Luas tram.,5,2015,01,11
240,Weekend and week visit,Came here on Sunday 5th and right from the star the staff were so friendly ann mare on reception was brillant nothing was a bother for her .She was most helpful throughout our stay .The bar and restaurant staff were most courteous and found Jose most helpful the breakfast staff were also very good at there job.The room we had was excellent very spacious and the beds most comfortable bathroom was big and spotless overall a most enjoyable experience and we will be back well done to the hilton and it's staff,5,2015,01,06
240,Really Enjoyable Stay,"Stayed for a weekend with my wife on 3/1/14 in deluxe view suite with balcony. 
From arriving till with left we were treated to a relaxed atmosphere with great professional service.
Room was very clean and of good size. The king size bed was very comfortable. Super roof top balcony views of the city, 
Food in the restaurant was of a high standard with great attentive service. Loved the breakfast.
5-10 minutes walk to the Luas made transport into city centre easy.
Thanks must go to the hotel staff, as all were very courteous, friendly and pleasant. 
Would defiantly stay again.",5,2015,01,05
240,recommended,"Nice clean, spacious rooms with a decent view.  Very comfortable beds.  Swimming pool temperature was too cold (and apparently has been like this for a couple of months).  This was an issue with small children.  Breakfast better than average. Evening meal nice but pricey and little other options in the locality save travelling towards city centre.",4,2015,01,05
240,Would recommend to anyone,"Top Hotel, The staff were very helpful, and even remembered me from booking 5 weeks or so previous. Nice pool and hot tub facilities. Suitable for Families or also couples looking for a relaxing City break. Only a 10 minute walk to Laos line into the city. Used Tesco vouchers and would do it again.",5,2015,01,05
240,Enjoyable,"This Hotel is a perfect base if your daytripping Dublin as the tour buses stop just accross the road. Approx 19 euros per ticket for an hour and a half excursion hop on or off. Staff were excellent, very polite and attentive. Room was spotless well furnished with a ""feel good"" kind of feling. Food was excellent and as a fussy eater that's high praise indeed. Car park handy to Hotel slightly confusing but then that's probably just me. Would definitely stay here again.",5,2015,01,04
240,Very happy,"This was my third time staying in this hotel - I've always found it to be great value. Bedrooms are always very comfortable and clean. Fantastic staff, helpful and friendly, and good quality bar food and breakfast is super. Also, the gym and pool are lovely. My only complaint on this occasion was that the inadequate airconditioning system in our room meant we needed to open the window during the night, leading to some  traffic noise.",5,2015,01,04
240,Recommended!Exceptional service!Exceed expectations!,"Definitely will return again! 
Fine Dining!Excellent presentation!Food was a gourmet's delight!
Room service was super!
Reception staff was very helpful, informative and friendly!
Tour buses stop across the street from the hotel! Hotel Parking!
Excellent convenient location! Close to many main tourist attraction sites.
The amenities offered are appreciated!
Love the Junior Suite and the view from my room with the balcony!
Many thanks! Thank you! Merci! Gracie! Danke! 
You made my trip to Dublin an absolute pleasure!",5,2015,01,01
240,A very good choice,"We stayed here in November of this year, the rooms are fabulous, the beds are enormous, food was excellent both evening meals and breakfast. The staff are friendly and l will defiinately stay here again.",5,2014,12,30
240,Disappointing,"This is a lovely hotel. But it is let down by a couple of things.
The complimentary wi-fi is nice to have, but although it was working on the Sunday evening that I arrived, it was not working the next morning. This was annoying as I got up especially early to do some work which required the internet. It's difficult to be without a network, it's something you get used to having all the time, so when you don't have it it is really disappointing. To be fair to the management, they did leave me a letter of apology in my room and a complementary ""Irish scone and coffee"".......
However, the thing that really got me was that my shower could not maintain a constant temperature. When I got it to the correct temperature it then decided to get much much hotter. I had to dash out of the shower until it came back to the correct temperature. This really was an accident waiting to happen, very easy to slip on the water in the bath and bang your head. I didn't alert the management on the first morning, I thought it would be ok the next day. Sadly, it wasn't, so I had to do the shower dash again.
I noted this issue in the feedback form that they left in my room, together with my email address. I did not receive any acknowledgement whatsoever. What's the point of a feedback form if it is not acknowledged or acted upon? Really disappointed. A free night in any Hilton hotel would have been good compensation, but I can't see that happening any time soon.",3,2014,12,29
240,Nice room but very cold,"In December I stayed in the hotel for one night. The room is functional and reasonable clean. Bug minus is the heating, it was not functioning. Although I contacted the reception it was not solved nor could I get another room. This is definitely not the Hilton standard I‚Äôm used to.",2,2014,12,27
240,Great Restaurang staff,"Love this Hotell have stayed here 7 times always in adjoining double rooms 
Very clean ,great room size , great beds , nice bathrooms , a/c does have a little problems now and then ,
Restaurang food a little disappointing , but strangely the bar food is great and  nice area for a pint or two.  ? .restaurang staff great always helpful .
Very Good breakfast with nice service 
Spa and gym is very good ,but a little cold in the changing rooms ,
Recommend the In house taxi service forget his name ,
Easy access to the city by bus, or on the Dublin city tour bus .
Parking outside or in the basement",4,2014,12,23
240,First Visit.,"Hello,  I am pleased to inform that, It is very nice place to stay in Dublin. I have enjoyed my stay in Hilton. Except couple of things I really do not like.. Hotel Location & Taxi Service :( Rest all was amazing. Cheers !!!",4,2014,12,22
240,weekend trip to Dublin,I stayed with a friend at Hilton Dublin Kilmainham and we really enjoyed our stay there! The hotel staff were always friendly and breakfast was very delicious! We slept so well in our comfortable bed and I would recommend the hotel to other travellers! It is in a good location out of the huzzle and buzzle from the city but very convinient to get to to city centre by bus!,5,2014,12,21

240,One night family package,"Staff very friendly and attentive, added a few extra treats for children's birthday. We had B&B, dinner & zoo tickets. Pool was great after day in zoo to further entertain kids.  Would love to book again  in 2015,",4,2014,12,16
240,Christmas Party 2014 - No so jolly,"Recently attended a Christmas Party at this hotel. In summary:

- Service very poor

- Food Served almost cold

- Quality of food could only be described as Awful.

Not a good place to start Christmas Festivities.",1,2014,12,16
240,Dreadful experience in Hilton,"Such a poor experience, breakfast disgusting cold low grade food quality, coffee horrible, staff unhelpful and unfriendly. Shower thermostat not working, not one positive word about service. Bed comfortable that's the only thing positive. For a brief overnight stay I want a good bed, a good shower and a good breakfast. I got a good bed that's it. I couldn't believe how sour and unpleasant the receptionist was at check in.",1,2014,12,16
240,Friendly staff and the most cumfortable beds,"I stayed over the first Weekend in December and was worried that the hotel might be a bit out of the way.  However, the excellent bus and train connections made trips into the city centre hassle free.  The staff could not have been more friendly and helpful and the bed was one of the best I've ever slept in.  Nice airy room and great service.  A thoroughly enjoyable experience.",5,2014,12,11
240,Excellent value and service and location very good for the outskirts of Dublin to reach the city centre and other areas,"Will go back for value service and location . The staff were so pleasant and helpful . Our room was spacious with excellent bedding and the breakfast in the morning was fresh , which even in 5 star hotels can be disappointing. ",5,2014,12,10
240,Nice Clean Hotel,"We stayed here Friday 5th & Saturday 6th as a base for a gig and some shopping in town, and had a relaxing time. 
Found the room to be tidy & clean , of a decent size and a large tv. 
Enjoyed a good quality Irish breakfast both mornings, we dined in the Four corners bar once and enjoyed the food.
We paid from 11eu-15eu for taxis in/out of city depending on traffic.
Will certainly stay again",4,2014,12,07
240,A first look at Dublin,"For a special moment in our lives we chose a location neither one of us has  ever been.  Hence chosing a hotel that looks to be a business hub a little away from it all was a risk. The Trip Advisor reviews sold us and they did it justice.

From the moment we arrived we knew we had made the right choice. Arriving early morning from the States is often a challenge but we had a room waiting for us and thanks to the amazing person at the front desk had our bearings.

Our room was spacious and had all of the usual amenities one expects with staying at a Hilton. My other half is very tall and these soaring ceilings made this room feel so roomy.  Safe and fridge are free, great storage for clothes and assorted apparel.  Plenty of room for luggage too. 

Bed was just perfect we both slept like logs every night. That in and of itself is deep praise for vacationing away from home. Bathroom was roomy and had plenty of counter space for all toiletry needs to be handy. Shower controls took a bit of experimenting but once we had it down it was all good.

The bus to the center of Dublin is two blocks away and the 13 and 40 ran frequently all day.  Get yourself a leap card and it could not be any easier to navigate the city on your own terms and affordably.

Additionally, one train station is a brisk ten minute walk away. The bus takes you to the city hub which makes it simple to connect to other busses and those going further afield. The light rail (LUAS) is another short ten walk away. And if you have your heart set on the Hop On Hop Off Bus tis right ouside the front door so this ends up being a convenient spot for all your Dublin needs.

We plan to return to Dublin and would not hesitate to return and stay at this hotel. ",4,2014,12,07
240,Nice fancy hotel,"Stayed there back in September for one night.Had a very nice meal, the room was lovely and modern everything clean, nice comfortable bed.Pretty easy to get to and good parking, but the only problem is the parking is very pricey, after paying a lot for the room, but other than that all was good.",4,2014,12,04
240,Great standard of hotel and easy access for hop on hop off bus -,We found a good deal for this hotel and it worked out well for us.  The hop on hop off bus meant travel into town was easy and there are a number of tourist attractions close by.  The reception staff were extremely friendly and helpful.,4,2014,12,02
240,Excellent Hotel but avoid restaurant during Xmas Party season,"We stayed here as a family on Sat 29th Nov. Hotel is in a great location just out of town (a short bus or taxi ride but a long walk) with first class facilities and rooms. Kids really enjoyed the small pool in basement and service throughout our stay was excellent .... except for our restaurant experience. With tired children, we booked earliest possible restaurant table at 6pm. Initial service from waiting staff was great but all changed as Christmas parties began to arrive. We were lost in the chaos. Almost two hours for a simple pre-set 3 course meal was ridiculous. Even though the quality of the food was very good, this was overall an exhausting and frustrating experience. By all means stay at this hotel but make alternative eating arrangements during the busy party season.",4,2014,12,02
240,Does exactly what it says...,"We stayed here with friends to enjoy the rugby. Handy location with the Lewis into the city center. Hotel was everything we expected, modern, clean and well appointed. Staff were very pleasant. All round good hotel and will defiantly consider it on our next trip! ",4,2014,11,30
240,I had again visited it with pleasure!,"An excellent location, close to the zoo and the cozy small pubs.  and the hotel itself has also a good 	 swimming pool and very friendly and helpful staff!  I would love to visit the hotel once again, and I recommend the hotel to others!",5,2014,11,26
240,Great location for Historical Sites,"This Hilton has an upscale feel to it, warm and welcoming.  The location gives the visitor a central location to visit some of Dublin's most historic sites.  Easy cab ride to Grafton Street and Trinity College to see that side of town.  The Hotels breakfast is quite good, with a full buffet style Irish breakfast, and the usual continental items.  This hotel is a short cab ride from town center, but gives the vacationer ample opportunity to see other areas of Dublin.",4,2014,11,26
240,Bad Business Etiquette,"I stayed here for one night with a friend. Overall its slightly better then any other Hilton in Dublin. What I did enjoy is the small Spa area with a Sauna, Steam, and hydro pool a great touch. 

Room was nice, clean comfortable and had a great size TV which you don't see in the best of hotels... 

 We ate in the restaurant which was included. The waiter had a good personality, however the attention to detail was terrible. The table was already set, which included dirty glass, cutlery and basically he had to replace half of what was on the table much to his embarrassment. 

What let this hotel down was the poor attitude of management. At 09.30am there was maintenance work been carried out on the air conditioning units. This involved very loud drilling which was vibrating up into the room. A call was made to reception who stated they would address it, how ever it continued. Something i find totally unacceptable at that hour of the morning. I think im entitled to at least enjoy the comfort of my room until mid day at check out. 

This issue was addressed with the duty manager at check out. Without going through it we were told the work was going to be done whether anyone complained or not basically as the workers were on site. It was like talking to a brick wall. I found the manager condescending and just wanted to brush off the complaint.... 

Would I return unfortunately possibly not having dealt with the chains of the operation here ! The hotel has got good prospects you just need the right people to manage it, This manager (female duty manager) has lost a loyal customer to the Hilton Brand.",3,2014,11,25
240,Business trip,"I stayed at the Hilton in Kilmainham, Dublin for a conference. The rooms are clean and comfortable. The service was good and the staff friendly and helpful. There was good variety for breakfast and the bar food was good. Its a good base for a visit to Dublin.",4,2014,11,25
240,Another Excellent Stay,"I have stayed at the Hilton Dublin Kilmainham on many occasions in the past for Business and with Family members. This occasion was with family and again it was a very enjoyable experience with friendly staff, excellent service and great food. The bedrooms are very spacious and the beds are very comfortable.",5,2014,11,25
240,Great if you skip the brekki,"On the whole my stay in the Hilton was enjoyable.  The reception staff; particularly a young woman who seemed to be from the area, were all excellent with the right combination of sophistication and friendliness.  I absolutely loved the the leisure facilities and felt the hotel was very clean, comfortable and well equipped.  However the stay was badly let down by the ""breakfast experience.""  
To start with we were greeted at the door by a young woman who asked us if we would like coffee or tea and whether we would like orange juice poured.  Efficiency such as this is too much in the morning - surely one should wait until the guests are seated at a table!!  
Pressed into communication with this hostess I meekly agreed to poached eggs with fish (as I am vegetarian and therefore don't eat eggs benedict).  I'm sorry I didn't take a photo of what arrived: it was a total assault on the eyes and I was smart enough to just lift off the poached eggs and eat them with toast.  My husband helped himself to a ""cooked breakfast"" which was most definitely Not cooked.   My poor spouse had a dicky tummy for the rest of the day.  Coffee was diabolical.  A young waitress noticed that neither of us had consumed the coffee and offered to get us Americanos from the bar.  We both latched onto that idea like a life raft. Unfortunately it was a full 15 mins before the replacement coffee arrived - the waitress apologized mumbling something about no one at the bar. In sum; the hostess would be better employed on a hospital ward (beds would be vacated v. quickly) and ""cooked"" breakfasts need more supervision.  Sorry!  On the plus side, cocktails the evening before were good.",3,2014,11,19
240,Very nice stay,"We arrived at the hotel quite early. The front desk was able to accommodate us with a 10:30 AM check in. Perfect for me as I really wanted a quick nap. The room was very clean and was very quiet for sleeping. Wifi worked well and the television offered plenty of channels. There is a gym and shower facilities on the lower level which were also quite nice. Ordered room service one evening and it was delivered promptly and as requested. The hotel bar was very efficient with friendly staff. Had the breakfast one morning...good selections with a bit of variety. Irish bacon is the best!

The hotel is located next to the Modern Art Museum and the old Jail. There is also a nice neighborhood pub right across the street that serves up a mean fish and chips and pours a nice pint. The closest ATM that I found was at the gas station one block away.

I would stay here again.",4,2014,11,18
240,Standard Hilton Fare,"The Hilton Kilmainham is located in Dublin 8, close to Kilmainham Goal and  Guinness Storehouse tourist sites but a little far (3km) from the city centre. Good wifi coverage. Parking at 12 Euros. Comfortable 35 sq metre room with airconditioning. Well-equipped bathroom, typical of a Hilton standard. Iron and iron board available. Good buffet Irish breakfast included in the room rate. Fridge in the room, but it was unserviceable.

You‚Äôll need to park your car in the basement carpark to get to the hotel reception, as there does not appear to be a driveway to the hotel entrance. Friendly hotel staff.",4,2014,11,17
240,"Room OK, Service Better","My second stay since a first one approximately a year ago. The service this time was better, but nothing outstanding. A reasonably friendly check-in and then improved experiences in the bar and restaurant compared with last time. The rooms are good - modern, clean and relatively quiet. I ate in the bar one evening and the service and food were OK - again, nothing outstanding.

I used the LUAS a number of times on this trip and found it convenient for the hotel and much cheaper than taxis, so I may stay here again depending on where I'm working. It does seem to lack a bit of a spark that really good service can deliver though.",3,2014,11,16
240,wonderful,"this hotel is lovely, stayed at the weekend and really enjoyed our stay, hotel very very clean with lovely comfy beds,our room was facing the back of the hotel and it was so quiet , the food was good we didn't go anywhere else to eat.  we hope to stay again on our next visit to Dublin,",5,2014,11,15
240,Great business hotel,"I stayed here for one night on a business trip to Dublin. There had been some mix up regarding the rooms but it was sorted out without delay. The room was comfortable, the wifi was straightforward (when it was explained - would have been useful to have this information in the room) and breakfast was adequate. Parking was additional, which irritates me when you have no choice, but they waived it on this occasion so no complaints really.",5,2014,11,11
240,No Complaints.,"Have stayed a few times and has been a good experience all round, excellent rooms which are impeccably clean, good bar food which is quick and great quality. What more can one say only go and stay there, it makes sense considering the rates that are available.",5,2014,11,09
240,Standard business type hotel,As you would expect from this hotel chain... Very good but standard. We ate in the restaurant in the evening and the food was excellent. Very comfortable hotel and free hi-speed wifi. Some roadworks outside at the time of our stay but nothing too disruptive.,4,2014,11,09
240,"Great, friendly service!","My husband and I spent the week of our 50th wedding anniversary at the Hilton Kilmainham.  The staff was wonderful, the room spacious and comfortable and the bar/restaurant food very nice.  The staff placed a small platter of little desserts in our room on our anniversary which was delightful.  We were in walking distance of Kilmainham Gaol and the Museum of Modern Art.  We were also a short taxi ride away from more central sights and shopping.  We have been to Dublin a half dozen times and this was our first time at the Hilton.  If we are fortunate enough to go back, we would definitely stay there again.",5,2014,11,06
240,Staff,The Desk staff and the maintenance staff were efficient and very helpful.  We had a checkin problem which they solved quickly. A piece of luggage had been damaged by airline/airport handling and it was repaired very well and expeditiously. All in all an excellent experience in Kilmainham.,5,2014,11,06
240,Good combo of comfort and service,"Really glad this hotel held up to the hilton standards. Our first night was in a standard room. Very comfortable and inviting. Nice bathroom and amenities. Location was close to the kilmainham jail and the Dublin zoo. They were great at arranging taxis and the walk to the temple bar area is about 2 miles. In the first room, the air conditioner did not work. The manager came up and checked the unit. Since it continued to not work, they provided us with a very effective Mobile AC unit and also bottled water and a nice dessert for our troubles. The second night we were upgraded to a deluxe room with a balcony. The room was very nice and we appreciated the larger bathroom (shower and a tub) and the balcony had a great view and was a nice size for morning coffee. The breakfast was outstanding. Nice variety and nice service. They had a hot line, cold bar and bread area. The only issue we had was that the amazing gym facility was only open 9-7 pm and closed Sunday. We were so sad we did not even get the chance to use the services and we had looked forward to it all. That was a major down side for us as we like to make a workout as part of our vacations. I would love to come back sometime and get a chance to review the life wellness gym facilities. They were very nice at the front desk and the restaurant.",5,2014,11,04
240,Great comfort Hotel,"We stayed for two nights the room was spacious, with a fridge, king size bed, 40inch TV. The food in the bar was really good and the staff were so helpful & friendly. The hydrotherapy pool was great. Not good for swimmers who like to do lengths tho. Overall really enjoyed our stay and would return. ",5,2014,11,04
240,Family break away,"Great location to stay with young family, beautiful modern, clean hotel rooms.  Will certainly return again in the near future.  Lovely pool for the children. Welcome on arrival was fantastic.  Great location for visiting all the sites Dublin has to offer",5,2014,11,03
240,Highly Recommended,"Quiet location but near enough to center of Dublin. Great walks locally in Pheonix park or War Memorial park. A guided tour of the Gaol (6 euros!) is worth it if only for the Irish history lesson, puts the rest of your site seeing in perspective.  Food and room all you'd expect from a Hilton brand.",5,2014,11,02
240,Great hotel,"Stayed for one night. The hotel is right beside Kilmainham Gaol, and just under 2miles from St Stephen's Green. Hotel is modern, and rooms spacious, bright and comfortable. Bed wonderful - great size and good linen. Free bottled water provided in room. Staff very helpful, and food in bar lovely and reasonably priced. Used hydrotherapy pool and sauna - both good. Car parking an extra 12 euros, but wifi free.",5,2014,10,31
240,Great hotel,"We arrived at the hotel several hours before our check-in time but staff were very friendly and obliging and processed paperwork and allowed us to store our bags for the day.

Our room was very spacious and recently redecorated, lovely big bed and good amenities within the room. The bathroom was equally spacious and well-decorated, our only problem was that the shower leaked soaking the floor and escaping out onto the carpet in the hall! We mentioned this on checking-out and the member of staff on reception seemed genuinely concerned and made a note to pass on to maintenance. It appears that no-one has raised the issue before so it has just been allowed to go on.

The hotel is in a good location for attractions such as the zoo, Kilmainham gaol and the Guinness Storehouse. We decided to walk to and from the city centre which took about 30-40 minutes - a lovely walk along the river. Also 10 min walk from Heuston train station (we got the bus from Dublin airport to the station then walked).

All staff encountered were very friendly and helpful and overall a very pleasant night's stay.",4,2014,10,31
240,Ireland and More,My seventh trip to Ireland provided my best memories of a hotel experience. The staff offered a sense of family that few places match. It served my comfort level better than stiff formality and it wasn't limited to native-born Irishmen and ladies. They turned a comfortable hotel into a luxury experience. The exercise facility and internet were also excellent.,5,2014,10,31
240,Oct Bank Hol weekend,"Excellent hotel, Very modern and felt new. Great rooms, really clean and bright. Ther was no issue with noise etc and beds very comfy so slept well. The staff ever so helpful! By the way bying a swim cap if planning to use the pool area (or else 2 euro and you can get one there)5 min walk to train / Luas .",5,2014,10,31
240,Second time - both great!,"Our second visit to this hotel and have decided it is our favorite in Ireland. Such a nice staff. Both times greeted at reception by Ana. She remembered us when checking in and made us feel very special. Food good, staff very friendly, parking good, rooms nice. Great location just down the street from Guinness. When we were checking our we got the nicest note from Ana. Picture posted. We will be back. ",5,2014,10,29
240,Simply Fabulous!,"The staff at the Kilmainham were helpful and friendly and really made my first time being in Ireland so much easier and less confusing. The breakfast service was superb especially the literally ""farm-fresh"" eggs and fresh squeezed orange juice. I really enjoyed sitting out on the patio by the bar with a relaxing glass of wine or pint of Guiness. What impressed me the most was the cleanliness of the rooms and the bed/pillows. It was like sleeping on a cloud. I will be saving my nickles to come back again!",5,2014,10,25
240,Weekend break,The hotel is gorgeous the staff too. We really spent very little time in the hotel literally dropping the bags as we arrived as we were rushing to concert a the 3 arena. It's a good 10-15 min walk to Luas stop on Suir Rd which runs the whole way to the Arena. Not bad on a nice evening but we had a gale blowing but we're dressed accordingly. On return we had a couple of drinks in the lobby and they are reasonably priced. Breakfast on the Saturday was disappointing only because the hot food was not hot! Sunday morning breakfast was perfect. We spent the day in the city and returned only to change and head to the theatre. Had to use taxi for this trip and it was ‚Ç¨18. We were awakened by a rowdy group in one of the rooms beside us and almost contacted reception when they settled down. On checking out we mentioned the noise and were kindly given money off our parking fees. The hotel is fabulous _ our room was stunning (4th floor balcony room)and will definitely go back. ,5,2014,10,23
240,Some Real Improvements...more to do though,"I stay at this hotel pretty regularly, and I must admit that I have seen some real improvement in areas. 

They do charge similar rates to the city centre hotels.

The beds and pillows are much better, used to be cheap synthetic, but the latest pillows are a real improvement and really help get a good nights sleep.

I'd complained previously about the lack of SKY Sports in the hotel... they've added Sky Sports in the bar and that's great for business people staying during the week... real choice of matches... especially given the remote location.

They've also really improved the internet, previously a very antiquated system, now its hassle free.

It's not city centre, if you book this hotel, you should expect to spend most of your time here in the evenings as there is nowhere really close by. A cab to Dublin will be ‚Ç¨10 each way. 

Breakfast still fails to impress... I reckon its ‚Ç¨12 each morning, but its the usual buffet fair... so all the cooked stuff especially eggs are hard to stomach. But there is a wide variety and if quantity is your aim you will not be disappointed. But staffing levels are pretty low... maybe 1 person too few... so it always seems to be rushed and hectic for the staff... some mornings they have long queue... or forget coffee etc. Not their fault I guess, but just not calm and relaxing way to start day.  They offer it free to Gold members and I still refuse and nip next door to Limetree Caf√© for a more local, friendly and welcoming service.... at half the price... made to order.

Service in the bar/restaurant is impersonal and haphazard.... generally OK, but they won't jump to serve you and spend quite a bit of time chatting amongst themselves. More than enough staff to cope, but not really customer centred. Food though is pretty decent in the evenings, and the ambience is nice, just need a leader to remind the team to say hello to customer as they walk in. I've sat in the bar at a table for 5 mins or more, with loads of staff buzzing around me, strenuously not making eye contact... and usually have to go to the bar for service... many others seem to have to resort to that as well. Pity, because guys in the kitchen definitely deliver nice food.

No real sense of being in an Irish hotel that I guess the tourist trade might expect, not sure any of the staff are local, so you miss the authentic nature of an Irish welcome, but Hilton is an international chain and Dublin is pretty cosmopolitan, so maybe to be expected.

My biggest gripe would be their implementation of the Hilton Honours loyalty program. This is the main reason that I avoid the place. I'm a gold member, there's allegedly a range of benefits to be had, but rarely at this hotel. I stay at least 5 nights per month (handy to work), but in a calendar year, have been given 1 room upgrade. Until very recently Gold wasn't even acknowledged at checkin, but starting to now. No other benefits offered, so no real honours/loyalty recognition.

If you are a Hilton Honours member, check out how the Hilton Dublin, Doubletree Burlington or Conrad treat you... it's a much more personal and rewarding experience.

So in summary, you won't be too disappointed if you have to stay here, they've improved in areas and making improvements. But if you have a choice and like the Hilton brand... try the Hilton Dublin or the Doubletree Burlington, your ‚Ç¨ will go further and you'll feel more appreciated as a returning customer or honours member.",3,2014,10,21
240,"Warm, friendly and delightful experience","We found our stay to be relaxing and delightful, with a spacious and clean room, convenient location, great breakfasts, and a reception staff that could not have been more pleasant or helpful to us.  Wonderful experience and we will return as soon as we can!",5,2014,10,20
240,Well-suited to our needs,"We checked in on September 29 and stayed for 3 nights.  Our room was a King Hilton Deluxe on the top floor (with balcony), overlooking the museum grounds.

Our room was excellent.  Spacious and clean, well-kept, bedding and furniture very comfortable.  The balcony has a nice view and is a good spot for a quiet coffee in the morning.  The bathroom was great and we enjoyed the big walk-in shower.  At night there were no issues with noise and sleep quality was very good.

We did not dine at the hotel (except for room service, which was about what you'd expect -- certainly good enough, but not exceptional).  We did get drinks at the hotel bar; no complaints and the service was good.

The front desk staff offered a friendly welcome at check-in and promptly accommodated every request I made during our stay.  Wonderful service all around.

The health club is a real plus.  The hydrotherapy pool is a great way to unwind and relax after walking around all day, and the service and amenities are top-notch.

The location was exactly what we wanted.  We prefer a bit of peace and quiet, so not being right in the city center is a big advantage.  But getting there is easy enough, as the nearby area is well-served by both Dublin Bus and the Luas.  In addition, the hop-on hop-off tour buses stop every few minutes at the gaol across the street, so getting where you need to be is simple.

Other location advantages:  the pub across the street is worth a visit, especially for lunch.  And there's a laundry one block away that gave us 2-hour service (a real blessing since we'd just come from 10 days in the UK and were nearly out of clean clothing).

Bottom line:  excellent stay and I can't think of a single complaint.  We're already planning a return visit to Dublin and I have no doubt that we'll stay again at the Hilton Kilmainham.",5,2014,10,20
240,Clean spacious rooms,"I have been traveling about Ireland the past ten days and really appreciate the clean, quiet, temperature regulated, well appointed room.    The hotel is relatively new construction and has all the latest features in your room.  Old world charm?, no. Comfort ?, yes.   What you would expect from a Hilton.  ",5,2014,10,18
240,Weekend in Dublin,"Good hotel ,staff very pleasant ,nice full brekfast& relaxing pool area.Location is out a bit but local buses will take you into the heart for 2 euros 35 ,cabs range from 11-13 depending on cases etc...",4,2014,10,18
240,Lovely,"Great location for us as right opposite the Kilmainham Gaol and within walking distance of the Guinness Storehouse - the two main attractions we wanted to visit during our brief stopover in this vibrant Irish capital
Check in clerks were friendly and helpful - as you would expect from the Hilton
Room is fantastic - one of the better rooms we have stayed in (Hilton wise), very spacious and well provisioned 
Decor doesn't beat the Barcelona branch, but I like it nonetheless 
Glad we stopped over ",4,2014,10,16
240,Comfortable,"Dublin is such a great city. It's a vibrant place with a great pub scene, a magnificent music scene and history at every turn. The Hilton Dublin Kilmainham is ideally located to give travelers the best of all of these options. Although the hotel is outside of the main ""city"" of Dublin, it is really closely located to some great historic sites. 

The hotel is clean and modern. Although a Hilton property, the hotel is actually quite small and very manageable with a nice bar/restaurant in the lobby and a big fitness club in the basement. The hotel was undergoing a few maintenance projects during my stay and this was hardly noticed - a great sign. I stayed in a 5th floor room with a balcony. The room was clean, with modern furniture and well maintained linens.

I found the location and general construct of the hotel to provide good sound-buffering. I also found that I barely noticed my fellow guests in the rooms in proximity.

What sold me on the Hilton Dublin Kilmainham was the location just across the road from the Irish Museum of Modern Art and the Royal Hospital Kilmainham.",4,2014,10,15
240,A nice place to stay if you don't need to be near the city.,"The hotel has a newish feel to it and the staff are generally warm and welcoming. The one exception to this was the receptionist on check-in. It wasn't a poor experience, she was just cold and never made eye contact. We found the hotel to be always clean in the lobby, hallway, bar, restaurant, and room. But the planter boxes outside our room on the balcony were filled with smokers butts and stank. We ended up avoiding going outside because of the smell.

We had a room on the second floor from the top and it was well appointed and lives up to Hilton standards. The bathroom was actually quite large with a separate bath and shower. The shower suffered the most common of all hotel problems - a lack of pressure! We didn't have any noise issues. Not sure if there were people staying in the rooms next to us but we didn't hear a sound.

There is really any need to book a room on the city side of the hotel as there is no real view to speak of. The trees across the road block the view for the most part and many new mid rise building between the hotel and the city also make it difficult to see anything.  The hotel is by no means close to the city. It is as the very end of the open top bus tour circuit (a positive). But because it is at the end the first bus does not arrive for an hour after it leaves down town Dublin. So if you want to start your day early you need to find another way into the city. A station on the tram network is only a 7min walk from the hotel and the directions are easy to follow.

The bar is fairly average for a Hilton in a major city and the evening meal in the Restaurant is good but not noteworthy. Breakfast is again good and is what you would expect from Hilton. The hotel has a pool and it is really quite good.

All in all the hotel is comfortable, clean, and easy to stay in. But next time I go to Dublin I will stay somewhere a little closer to the city centre.",3,2014,10,14
240,Nice and Clean,"Stayed here for 4 nights for a business trip. Hotel is nice and clean. I was on the 4th floor and room was pretty good size. Has a good restaurant onsite and bar. only couple things i noticed- i could hear people when they out in the balcony in the next room. They should do something about that. Thicker glass or something.
not much to do around in the area or places to eat
i'd probably stay close to city center next time.
price is on the high side for the room (above $300)  and didn't even include breakfast",3,2014,10,13
240,comfort is an understatement.,"I can only but highly recommend this Hotel. Comfort and cleanliness is an understatement here, food is excellent and staff are extremely helpful. If you are looking to be spoilt for a fraction of the price, this is the place to stay.",5,2014,10,13
240,Hilton Kilmainham Dublin,"This quality hotel is clean and comfortable and located about 2 miles west of Dublin Cirty Centre near to tthe Irish Museaum of Modern Art,   The Bed matress, sheets and towels were all sumptuous and the area is quiet so I get a good restful stay when I stay at this hotel.",5,2014,10,11
240,"Lovely, clean & helpful","Did not book this hotel at first but after the Hilton in Dublin city centre cancelled (not impressed) our booking, the Hilton in Kilmainham did not disappoint. Very helpful staff, clean accommodation and added bonus of the spa with an excellent restaurant  for evening and lunch menu and fab breakfast did not disappoint.",4,2014,10,07
240,Staff are so welcoming!,"From the lovely welcme and chat at reception o the waiter in the bar who welcomed us back for dinner, the staff in this hotel make it what it is. Lovely, historicl location and good food in the bar/restaurant and a GREAT cappuccino :)",5,2014,10,06
240,"It is Hilton, so, it is good","Stayed there two nights on a business trip to Dublin. It is not near city centre, so do not expect great time. Also, that part of the city is rough, although I would not say I felt insecure. Just requires smart behaviour.
ROOM: spacious, twin bed, regular amenities, business hotel style. It was clean. The staff was welcoming, but were not able to articulate their public transportation suggestions.
 BREAKFAST: it was ok, all kinds of options, but quite a lot based on local customs and that means deep fried everything. But, one could find nice things, really.
I would stay there for business, if it is near, but would pick more central location for pleasure.
There is a wellness centre, but I did not visit it.",5,2014,10,05
240,Fantastic sleep in great modern room,we booked two rooms here and arrived after our all night flight. We both had our rooms by 1pm. So comfortable and nice to have fresh air in our room. The hop on and hop off bus is at your door. Jail and modern art museum across the street.  Restaurant service extremely slow. Many complaining. Not enough staff. Reception gals great. Recommend!,4,2014,10,04
240,Great place to stay in Dublin,"If you are going to Dublin, consider the Hilton Kilmainham Gaol.  Its a great location to be near some attractions and right on a bus line for very easy access to the city center and beyond.  Staff are friendly and knowledgeable.  A visit to the Kilmainham Gaol across the street is a must for anyone as well.",5,2014,10,02
240,Good Value - Fantastic Modern Rooms,"This hotel is very modern, well organized and clean.  The rooms are spacious (King size bed is great).  The shower is superb - one of the best I have experienced.  Parking is a bit hefty at ‚Ç¨12/night but not bad for the area.  Service is superb as is the breakfast.  If you need to stay in the area this is a good choice.  Also easy to get to the M50 and Dublin city centre from here.",4,2014,10,02
240,Lovely visit again,"Third or fourth visit to this hotel and just over for the weekend for the GAS hurling final. Always a pleasant experience St this Hilton.  Good sized clean rooms with excellent beds. Friendly staff make the visit worth while.  Breakfast very good but where are the mushrooms???. Didn't use spa and pool but have in past. Yes it is a bit out of the tourist trap of Temple Bar but all the better for that! Across the road from Kilmainham Gaol a must for anyone with any love of history and the Across the road the other way to the Irish National Gallery of Modern Art with free entry

Tip pre book your taxi through front desk and pay flat fee of ‚Ç¨25 ",5,2014,09,28
240,Nice Hotel but Not Close to Dublin Centre,"I stayed at the Kilmainham with my husband for one night only.  We usually stay in Clontarf castle when visiting Dublin but we wanted a change this year & thought it might be easier to reach the centre of Dublin from the Kilmainhaim but it wasn't so.  It was alot more awkward for us.

The hotel itself was modern & clean.  Staff at reception were very welcoming & friendly.  The room we were given (Room 413) was lovely & quiet.  No special view from window - just nearby buildings but the peace & quiet made up for that.  We did have breakfast delivered to our room which was your typical full irish breakfast (very tasty).   We also tried out the spa area, which although was free to guests, I was charged ‚Ç¨3 or ‚Ç¨4 euros for a swimming cap as my hair was long & they do not allow anyone in the spa area unless their hair is covered!  I wish they had of noted this on their website as I could have brought my own & avoided the extra charge!  You have to sign in at the reception desk that covers the spa & the gym area. There is only glass partition separating the spa area from the reception & you can clearly see people stepping in & out of the pool through the glass which made me a little self-conscious once I was in my bathing gear & walking around! The spa area is small with a couple of little pools that you can only really sit in - not large enough to swim around.  There is a separate jacuzzi & also a sauna & steam room. 

I have no faults about the hotel except for it's location.  We did drive to the hotel but we never take the car into Dublin centre so we rely on public transport.  We asked the reception staff for directions into the centre & they directed us to the Luas tram service.  We followed the directions and found the Luas but it must have taken us approx 20 minutes to walk there (maybe it would have been quicker on a warm day but it was raining the day we walked).  Then by the time the Luas stopped at every stop it just seemed to take us forever to get into the centre.  I knew that by the time we looked around and got something to eat in Dublin that I wouldn't want to travel back the same way as the 20 minute walk from the Luas back to the hotel wouldn't feel safe to me so we ended up having to splurge on a taxi back.

The hotel does have a car park available, fee which we believed to be within our room deal, but we ended up paying ‚Ç¨12 extra for 24 hour car park fee.

We chose this hotel as we thought it would be better value than the previous hotels we have stayed in around Dublin but when we added up car park fees & Luas/taxi fees it worked out just as expensive.  I would recommend the hotel to stay in but did not feel Dublin centre was easily accessible.",3,2014,09,25
240,"Clean, affordable hotel","Although not in the city center it was close to pheonix park which has a number of tourist attractions including Dublin zoo, war memorials and the presidents palace. The staff were very helpful in pointing us in the right direction every morning we went out. The inhouse food was nothing amazing but was adequate fuel for our trekking.",3,2014,09,22
240,Would definitely return!,"I recently stayed at this hotel and cant recommended it highly enough. The rooms are immaculate and the king size bed was so comfortable. The staff are very friendly and accommodating with the spa facilities being a particular plus point. The hotel is directly opposite the Kilmainham Gaol which is an excellent way to spend an hour. It's also within 15 minutes walk of the Guinness Storehouse and although the hotel isn't near the city centre, it's only a short ‚Ç¨10 taxi ride away (buses and trams are also available as a cheaper option). Breakfast was very nice but perhaps a little expensive at ‚Ç¨12 each but the bar was brilliant with a wide range of drinks on offer. Ultimately, I would give this hotel an excellent rating and will definitely return in the future.",5,2014,09,21
240,Decent Hotel,"We stayed here two weeks ago. The check-in staff were lovely and very friendly. The room was great, clean and very comfortable, with a big wardrobe. The bathroom was of a good size too with a separate shower and bath which is always nice to see. We ate in the restaurant on the first night, it was okay, nothing special, however the service was a bit over-eager and seemed 'tip hungry' which was a bit off-putting. Breakfast in the hotel is very good and on our first day they had lovely freshly baked muffins. The wifi is of an acceptable standard however it didn't reach our room on the third floor. We ate elsewhere on the second night, and returned late; the bar was unable to provide us with a jug of water for the room, so gave us two pint glasses instead which we found a bit odd. We checked out the next day and walked into Dublin to do some shopping before our flight, whilst reception looked after our bags. We returned with time to spare, so I had the pancakes off the Brunch menu which were very good. An affordable hotel within a 20 minute walk of the city centre, I would definitely recommend it if one was looking for a hotel to stop over in Dublin for a night or two.",4,2014,09,21
240,"location, location, location","great hotel, friendly helpful staff and great location
hop on hop off just across the street, you can purchase bus passes at the hotel
the room was very clean and comfortable
nice pool and sauna to relax in after a long day
close to the center of town but in a very nice quiet area
if you want a change from the hotel restaurant there is a very good pub with a restaurant kitty corner to the hotel, very good food there
only down side is you have to pay for parking
would highly recommend",5,2014,09,21
240,Short but very enjoyable stay,"All our expectations were met. Staff were very pleasant and helpful. Used the restaurant twice .. late snack/dinner and breakfast. Hotel was clean and being convenient to train station, was a plus. We would happily return.",5,2014,09,21
240,Great hotel.,Great hotel. Just outside the busy city centre but close enough that access to city & attractions was easy. Hop on hop off bus & Dublin bike hire right across the road. Lovely clean good sized rooms with helpful staff. ,5,2014,09,21
240,Nice property,Stayed at the Hilton Kilmainham for a long weekend.  Although it is not in central Dublin it is just a short block walk to a public bus that has you in the heart of Dublin in 10-15 minutes depending on traffic.,5,2014,09,20
240,Good Hilton experience,"I stayed here for three nights in June and again in August and was thoroughly happy with the experience. I upgraded to balcony rooms both times and I agree with other reviewers that it is worth the price.

Great things:
a) breakfast... a very good buffet breakfast to start the day.
b) Internet connection is sufficient speed and is reliable... this is probably one of the top things I rate hotels on.
c) staff was friendly and helpful.

The property is a little off the beaten path as it is Kilmainham but getting into the city centre by taxi is easy.  I much prefer this property over the main Hilton Dublin (Royal Canal) or the Hilton Dublin Airport (both of which I used to use while in Dublin on business or holiday).",4,2014,09,19
240,Great Stay,"The Hilton Dublin Kilmainham was great!  The staff were friendly and the hotel was really clean.  One downside was the restaurant in the hotel.  The service could be really slow at times.  Not a big deal though because I wasn't in the restaurant a lot.  The other down side was the construction that was going on. It looked like they were renovating a few of the rooms. Once again, not a big deal becuase they were doing the construction during the day.",4,2014,09,19
240,Room 540,"If you want a nice view over Dublin pick this room, great balcony with 180 degree view, mind the kids! Nice room, bathroom could have been a little bigger, especially the bath but I was only staying a night. Good food from the restaurant brought up to the room was nice. Effective gym and a large spa pool and sauna area. 
As usual staff great and an all round good experience. 

Good location If you want to be away from the hustle and bustle and near the modern art museum, right next door. ",4,2014,09,19
240,"Very comfortable, friendly and helpful","We stayed at this hotel for six nights at the beginning of September and have not one complaint.  The staff went above and beyond to accommodate our party of four.  We had a very nice room with a balcony on the fourth floor overlooking a street and large trees.  Very pretty, but noisy if you left the door open to the room.  If the door was closed, you couldn't hear anything.  The room had all of the amenities that we needed and it was spotless.  Bed was comfortable and there was plenty of closet space.  Bathroom had a tub and separate shower.  There are no electrical outlets for American plugs, but they have a machine on the first floor to buy a plug for 5 euros.  They also have some available at the front desk, but they were gone when we were there.   The front desk staff went above and beyond helping with ideas for getting around and went out of their way to help us remedy a reservation problem that we had caused.   The hotel is not in the city which was our choice.  The gaol we had wanted to see was across the street, but for everything else we walked about a block, caught the city bus (#13 or #40) and took the short trip into downtown Dublin..  It runs until later at night (11:30pm as we remember) and the hop on hop off only runs until around 7:30pm.  It was very easy to use and the drivers always helped to make sure we got off at the right stop.  We did have to stand a lot as seats were limited.  

The buffet breakfast was very good -- fried eggs, scrambled eggs. oatmeal, sausages, bacon, potatoes, several kinds of dry cereals, yogurt, muffins, rolls, toast, etc.  There is an outside area in the front of the hotel for food and drinks.  Tables and chairs, sofas, etc.  Very relaxing.  There is a very casual, but very good  Irish and Italian restaurant across the street, upstairs --  La Dolce Vita.  Also a bar downstairs that was very nice. 

  We were very happy with our stay and would certainly recommend it to people who would prefer to stay a reasonable distance from the downtown area.",4,2014,09,17
240,Friendly Staff,"Had a great long weekend in this hotel, I'm a big fan of Hilton Hotels but this one deserves a special mention. The Hotel is clean and well laid out, the restaurant was excellent and good value for money with a traditional menu. 
Good location, handy for motorways but close enough to the city centre, it was about 12/15 Euro in a taxi to the city centre.
The hotel taxi was good value from the airport and cheaper than airport taxi's. 
The staff were great and really couldn't do enough for you.
Traditional cooked breakfast was nice.",5,2014,09,17
240,The staff there is wonderful!,"We couldn't have been more pleased with our stay while in Dublin. The hotel was clean and convenient and the staff there was fantastic at helping us along the way! The staff met our need for early arrival and when one couple came a bit later, they upgraded their room too.",4,2014,09,15
240,Irish Couple Dublin,"We have stayed in this hotel on a number of occasions and have always found it to be of a high quality.

We recently stayed for a weekend break. Due to our Hilton Honours we were able to request an upgrade to a City View room. This cost us twenty euro on top of the advance purchase rate we had already paid. Worth it. Room had a view out to the gates of Kilmainham Gardens. The rooms have all the facilities you would expect and are as described on the web site. Our room was 132 and it was a room that could be interconnecting if the need arose.

The Staff on check in were very friendly and were ready to offer advice on attractions etc. Well done to them, it made our arrival seem more personal. Something you do not get in many larger hotels. One of the ladies was from South Africa originally and we were able to chat to her about our visit to Cape Town. Off to a good start we felt.

Breakfast is very good. Lots of fresh fruit, breads, muffins etc. There is also a cooked breakfast section. As always with this buffet type breakfast it proves difficult to keep the food totally warm. There was a delay in being shown to our table, the manner in which this is organised is something hotel management should look at. Availed of Room Service for breakfast one morning. Very good and worth the Euro 5.50 charge incurred. Arrived 5 minutes after the time I had selected on my order.

We ate dinner one night in the hotel dining room. The restaurant was fairly empty by 7.30 when we arrived. The food was good but again remember this is hotel food, so do not expect too much. Our meat was cooked as required and the service was prompt and friendly.

The Leisure Centre in the hotel is of a large size but do watch the pool is not of the sort that allows for lane swimming. It is really one large spa so relaxation is the order of the day.

The hotel is about a 12 min walk to Huston Train Station where you can get the Luas to the centre of Dublin. Ticket machine at the Station, Across the road from the hotel on the right hand side there is a Petrol Station with a shop so small items can be purchased there. 

Would recommend this hotel and we will stay there again when next in Dublin.",4,2014,09,14
240,Great Hotel,"Our family of 3(1 child) stayed here for 2 nights for the hurling final and found it to be an excellent stay.  all the staff were very pleasant and professional at reception, cleaning, gym staff and restaurant. special mention to receptionist Alisia and a tall thin girl on breakfast (eastern European accent) who were extra helpful. free Wi-Fi in the rooms.  
Our room was fab, we were looking straight out at the old Kilmainham Gaol and the museum of modern art, which is a lovely place to go for a walk, nice peaceful gardens.
Thanks to all. 
Karl G",5,2014,09,11
240,Excellent Hotel,"This was my 2nd visit to the Hilton Kilmainham on business. Chosen for its close proximity to the client I was visiting but nonetheless it is a fantastic place to stay. The room I had was clean and spacious and not a sound could be heard from other guests. WiFi is free when so many other venues charge for it! I was in a 4th floor room overlooking Kilmainham Gaol and from that far up the view was lovely with hills and countryside visible beyond Dublin itself.
The staff were helpful and even gave me very accurate directions to the nearest pharmacy when I needed them! I chose to eat in the restaurant as opposed to the bar. On the days I was there, except for the Thursday (where there was a lot of noise from the adjacent bar) it was quiet and peaceful and service was quick and efficient. Food choice was perhaps a little limited but what was on offer was very well cooked and presented. 
I didn't get chance to use the gym and spa facilities so cannot comment on these.
Price-wise it is at the top of the budget we are allowed as corporate users and probably a little expensive for an extended stay but well worth it for a night or two. If I am visiting the same client again it will definitely be my first choice.",5,2014,09,11
240,Go directly to Gaol !,"Go directly to gaol, and that is a good thing.  This hotel is literally across the street from the Kilmainham Gaol, which is a really interesting place to visit.  You might not think so, but it is very cool.  AND because of that, one of the stops for the ""Hop on, hop off"" tour buses is right there.
While there really is not much to see right in the neighborhood, that is not all together bad.  I will say, if you are flying in and going to this hotel as we did, the directions on our GPS were pretty weird, so beware.  
As for the hotel itself...well, mostly quite good.  We were fortunate enough to have a corner room looking sort of north, and that was very nice.   The room was VERY nice as European hotels go--which sounds like a backward slam--but suffice it to say it was more like a US hotel room.   We did not use any of the dining facilities, so we cannot comment on that.
There is a parking garage on site which makes it very nice.  There is a cost, but at least it is quite convenient.",4,2014,09,09
240,Disgraceful customer service,"Lovely hotel,  lovely rooms,  great location. ... Unfortunately no customer service and I'm not exaggerating.  Bring a picnic because you'll wait 20 mins for drinks and 40-60 mins for food.  We were here for a wedding. Group of 50+ all willing to spend our money.  We complained to no avail.  If they were ant slower they would stop.  Very very disappointed.  Good pub across the road,  The patriot,go there for food and drinks. ",3,2014,09,07
240,They go the extra mile,"I booked this as a Hilton Honours rewards stay back in March. At the time I told them it was a special occasion (a wedding anniversary) and they upgraded us to a deluxe room with a view. On arrival the staff were very helpful, providing us with plenty of information and when we go to our room there was a plate of desserts and a card, again complimentary, it was a really sweet touch (pun intended).

The hotel is very clean and located in a quiet suburb of the city. The location was great for us as it was quiet, however you will need to rely on public transport or taxis to get around. The local bus service I found a little confusing but a typical cab fare will be 10 - 12 Euros each way. A hotel shuttle service would be a great addition, just hinting.

We did not use the bar or restaurant in the hotel as we had made alternative arrangements. We did have breakfast though, which was excellent both days.

The pool, sauna, steam room were great, clean, not too busy. Thank you Hilton Kilmainham.",5,2014,09,06
240,Modern Ireland,The Hilton met and exceeded all of our expectations.  Very modern but definitely comfortable and welcoming.  The staff was most helpful in with suggestions on what to do within walking distance of the facility along with where to taxi to for dinner and a fun night on the town. Will stay here again on our next trip to Dublin.,5,2014,09,05
240,Fantastic!,"We spent four days at this location for the Penn State vs UCF game that was at Croake park. The hotel was spotlessly clean and the staff was very helpful at every level. Must single out Michael at the bar, he is a top notch employee and we really enjoyed talking with him. Cab rides to The Temple bar area were about 10 euros. Hope to come back soon.",5,2014,09,05
240,"great hotel, staff, and manager","If you've never been to Ireland this is a great hotel to begin with.  The hotel is convenient and the staff are friendly and helpful.  We didn't know we needed cash for a cab (thought we could use credit card).  The hotel manager ""loaned"" us the cash and trusted us to pay him back, which we did the next day.  He also treated us like close friends or family.  What a nice added bonus to our stay.",5,2014,09,05
240,Hilton Dublin,"This hotel was perfect for us.  It was on the ""Hop on - Hop off"" bus route around the city.  It had air conditioning and the rooms were spotless.  The staff was very helpful.  If you have a choice, stay at the Hilton versus the Dublin Double Tree. The Double Tree is not on the ""Hop on - Hop off"" bus route and has no air conditioning.",5,2014,09,03
240,Heaven,"We checked in the afternoon of our 31st wedding anniversary and this beautiful Hilton could not have done more to make it wonderful. The room was beautiful, clean and comfortable. Anna and Emma at the front desk were adorable and completely service oriented while treating us like family. They made it incredibly hard to leave this place after our 3 night stay. Couldn't have been more perfect.  Best tip is to take the hop on hop off bus that come right by the hotel to get around.",5,2014,09,03
240,Great Hotel & Ideal Location,"Stayed for 4 nights (28/08/2014) very helpful staff, good sized room that had a king size bed, bath with a shower, iron and ironing board, hair dryer, kettle, bottled water & fridge. Very clean and tidy hotel, a good variety for breakfast but not the hottest cooked breakfast we have had. Evening meal was nice (‚Ç¨23 for a 3 course). 5 minute taxi ride into central Dublin cost ‚Ç¨10 and the bus takes 12 minutes and costs ‚Ç¨2.80. We had a great stay.",4,2014,09,02
240,"Great hotel location, awful food ","Twice visited and food consistently poor. Under cooked fish, over seasoned/spicy chicken salad!

The bar/ eating area has the ambience of a morgue and if you want the restaurant menu good luck. The biggest shame is that the restaurant was roped off as this is a great space.

Apart from the food, the hotel is well located, the leisure facilities especially the full spa pool are awesome so, enjoy the hotel then pop across the road to the patriot for stunning food at 1/2 the price",3,2014,09,01
240,Great hotel and ultra helpful staff,"We stayed for 6 nights at the Hilton Dublin Kilmainham and when compared to the other Hilton properties we have stayed in during our 6 month road trip this particular one is right near the top. Not only was our room nice and large and well maintained but the morning breakfast was also great with plenty of choices. The best part as usual is the people that work at the Hilton. Michael at the front desk was incredibly helpful by storing our baggage until our room was ready and giving us directions to popular sights as well as pamphlets and opinions of hop on hop off busses and Gaelic music and dance shows. Seems like Michael was always there for us and even put us in a room with a King size bed instead of the twin that was on our reservation. The hotel, staff and Michael in particular would make Conrad Hilton proud!",5,2014,08,31
240,Excellent stay at Hilton Kilmainham,"Just back from an overnight stay in the Hilton Hotel Kilmainham Dublin.  Myself, my husband and 6 year old daughter really enjoyed our stay here.  The staff were so friendly and helpful, from the reception staff to the bar/restaurant and pool staff.  We had a slight problem regarding an extra bed for our daughter but the staff were very apologetic.  The room was large and very clean, with a bath and a shower in the bathroom.  The food was lovely.  My husband and daughter used the pool and loved it.  We wanted to visit the zoo and Kilmainham Gaol, both of which are close by, the Gaol is right across the road.  We also asked the staff in the Hilton to recommend a good restaurant, which they did and we were very impressed.  All in all we were very pleased with our stay here and would definitely come back.  Would also have no problem recommending this hotel to others.",5,2014,08,26
240,Relaxing End to Our Holiday,"Great location, large rooms and comfy beds, free Wifi and Quiet. Staff helpful and pleasant, food in restaurant very good, Breakfast self service, help yourself to as much or as little as you like.
Situated across the road from Kilmainham Gaol (Tourist Attraction) and just the right distance from the City Center (we walked in and around and Taxi back 15euro). All in all a great two Days, made that little bit special courtesy of Emma and Anne-marie. Thanks Girls",5,2014,08,25
240,The only place to stay in Dublin,"A great hotel! The staff, rooms, food and location are excellent and we got a great deal AND and free upgrade on check in! A real pleasure to visit and we will certainly be back. Try the fillet steak...really good. With free access to the spa and wifi and a choice of restaurant or bar food it really has everything. The Luas is five minute walk away and it goes straight into the centre. Love the toiletries too! Thank you Hilton.",5,2014,08,24
240,A great way to end a trip around Ireland.,"We booked this location initially because it was close to the place we needed to drop our hire car back, and I am so glad we did. We booked a room which was a double/double and received an email to offer us a standby upgrade for something like 20 euros so we thought - why not? We arrived and got checked in with little fuss and headed to our room. We had a lovely view of the Kilmainham Jail, we had some time before dinner (which was complimentary and a lovely surprise) so we relaxed in the very comfortable beds after a long journey from Cork. Dinner was delicious, but be warned the portions are big... But so yummy. Breakfast was also very, very nice however the service was a little bit slow - we weren't too phased as we were in relax modem but I could see that it might annoy other people if you had somewhere to be. We found the service to be impeccable, rooms soooooo comfortable and all in all a great stay. ",5,2014,08,20
240,Vacation,"Great place to stay very friendly and helpful staff, the full Irish breakfast was delicious,the hot tub and pool was beautiful . I would stay there anytime!!!! The location was a bit far from the airport but still worth it.",5,2014,08,19
240,Would not return in a hurry,"Was here for a day time function this weekend and wouldn't be in a hurry back.
Service was very slow In getting the meal out, also the Barman took about 10 mins to save 2 people and the he overcharged me. I ordered the same order, less one mineral, a bit later and it was over 8 euro cheaper. Barman refused to check back stating I had no receipt even though he knew he had not issued one as it would not print at the time.  Then he tried to say I had order extra drinks ether first time.",2,2014,08,17
240,Nice hotel and great staff,"After a week if traveling around Ireland, it was so nice to end the trip at this Hilton. Even though, we had thought we booked for a family room for 4 vs. 3, the staff was extremely helpful in getting us another room for the 1st night and a rollaway the night after.  Anne Marie and Emma were so helpful and nice, always asking us about r visit and helping us with r touristy questions. Rooms were up to date and beds comfortable. Definitely recommend!",5,2014,08,17
240,Great Service,"awe had two nights at the Hotel, our bags missed our flight and the staff did a great job getting our bags to us when the airport was going to deliver the next day. Great breakfast and the staff were very professional and helpful. Great experience.",5,2014,08,17
240,Great hotel,"Great hotel, the room was brilliant, the pool amazing and the breakfast very good. We stayed there as we had a wedding in the Museum of Modern Art which is across the road. I cannot fault it, would recommend it to anyone",5,2014,08,15
240,"Excellent, quiet stay","My mom and I stayed for two nights at the HIlton through a Secret Escapes deal. It lived up to everything that we were promised! 

 We took the Airlink from the airport to Heuston Station. It was a 12 minute walk to get to the Hilton and easy to get to as you just follow the signs to the Gaol. It was really nice walk as you can cut through the Art Museum park and end up directly across from the hotel. 

The hotel staff were very polite and helpful. They gave us an early check in at 12 so my mother could go to sleep after a long flight from Canada. The room was tastefully done ""Hilton style"". 
The pool is fantastic. A great place to relax and unwind and if you are into exercising the work out center looked great. 

There is a hop on hop off service across from the hotel which is in front of the Gaol, so it is easy to get into the city centre.

We also had a meal in the restaurant and the service and food were great. Couldn't have asked for better.

Breakfast was also very nice. It is served until 10 so you can have a good sleep in before getting up. 

All in all it is a great place to stay and would recommend it to anyone.
Thank you",5,2014,08,14
240,"Clean, spacious room; mediocre location","Our room was absolutely spotless and very large and spacious. The shower worked well and the bathroom was nice. 

The front desk workers were also very pleasant and helpful, ensuring that this Hilton was very comfortable.

The only real drawback is the location. It's a bit of a trek into the city centre. It's not a bad walk during the day, but after a night out and some drinking, it can be a little too far. It's also inconvenient if you'd like to go out into the city, return and change clothes, and then go out later. 

Overall, I'd recommend it, but one should keep in mind that they'll either be walking a great deal or taking taxis as Dublin's public transit system is not the best.

Pro Tip: if visiting Dublin for leisure, make sure you check out Howth and the harbour!",4,2014,08,14
240,Wedding in IMMA,"Very comfortable and very quiet - appreciated that! Clean room and bathroom, and polite staff. Breakfast staff could be a bit more on the ball, but overall a pleasant experience. Reasonably priced if you pay up front - otherwise expensive.",4,2014,08,11
240,Repeat visitor,"Clean and friendly , it has a great bar area. Lovely pool area. Been here a few times and will again. Easy to get into the city and still quiet at night. The breakfast has many options and will suit all. Rooms are modern and have a/c (although ours was broken), only negative was paying 12‚Ç¨ for parking. ",4,2014,08,10
240,NOT a proper lap pool and an inconvenient distance from city,"When searching for a hotel with a swimming pool, it returned with this hotel which I booked. Upon arrival I found that it is only a hydrotherapy pool, not one for swimming laps. The hotel is also in a desolate part of Dublin so you have to travel each time you want to do anything, other than visit Kilmainham Gaol which is opposite. If the above issues don't bother you, then the hotel is clean, comfortable and modern with friendly staff, which it should be for the price they charge. ",4,2014,08,10
240,Good hotel but out of the way.,"Nice, clean room and bathroom.  Wifi works well.  It's a shame it isn't closer to the city center.  We had to take the tram into town every day.  It's not horribly inconvenient however  since the tram stop is only around 4 blocks away.  All in all, it's not a bad place to stay if you don't mind staying a bit out of town.",4,2014,08,09
240,good,it is a lovely presented hotel. the pool area is fab.  The comfort of the beds and pillows are not so good.  The air con in our room didn't work and it was very hot.  The breakfast and dinner was very well presented and tasted lovely. over all a nice place to stay.,4,2014,08,07
240,Top class,"We stayed at the Hilton, Kilmainham on Tuesday 29th July for one night. We were greeted at reception by two lovely staff members, who checked us in efficiently and gave our two little boys a little treat. Our room was spotless, the bar staff were efficient and friendly. The food was lovely We will definitely stay here again!",5,2014,08,04
240,Wonderful experience in Dublin,"Everything about our stay experience here was excellent - comfortable, friendly, very accommodating.  We stayed here for our first 2 nights in Dublin with our 4 children (ages 17-25). The location in a bit tough if you plan to walk to city centre. We had a 3 day pass for the Hop-on Hop-Off bus which provided our transport from Dublin Airport to Heuston Station - a short (8-10 minute) walk from the station drop off to the hotel door.  When the HOHO bus wasn't running at night we had to rely on cabs for the trip from city centre to the hotel - a bit pricey since we needed 2 cabs for 6 people! There is a bus stop right across the street at the goal - for both the HOHO bus and Dublin City bus. There is a breakfast place a few doors down - The Lime Tree. Nothing exciting but it gets you started at a price less than the hotel restaurant.  All in all - quiet and comfortable July 27 - 29, 2014",5,2014,08,03
240,Cordial and helpful,This hotel is very clean and updated. Food is great but most important the staff is friendly and very helpful. A member of the front desk managed to figure out the problem I was having with my IPad regarding the charger. It is a very modern motel- has a/c . Great place to stay.,5,2014,08,03
240,I was happy,"The Hilton hotel staff are very pleasant, friendly and accommodating and go out if their way to make you feel comfortable, especially Mihaela.

I had a king size room with a view looking into kilmainham gaol.  Lovely room, comfortable bed, would of liked softer pillows but that's only a small niggle.  The rooms were very clean and the flat screen tv was huge. 

I would give 5/5 but I'm only giving 4/5 because of the having to pay for parking and the breakfast seemed a little undercooked, the sausages I had to ask to be cooked darker for my liking but otherwise a lovely visit to a nice hotel. ",4,2014,08,02
240,Quiet and helpful,"20min nice walk from the city center. Great staff, very helpful. Breakfast up to the standard offering wide variety of food. Rooms & bathroom very clean. Although during the stay there was a redecoration going on, it didn't disturbed my stay at all. ",5,2014,08,02
240,Amazing staff,"A really good hilton hotel (they usually are).Clean and spacious room with aircon.
Very helpfull and pleasant atmosphere all around the hotel.
Nice breakfast ,good location for heuston station just 15 min walk . But Luas station at suir road is just 8 to 10 min walk.",4,2014,08,01
240,First Trip to Ireland,"This was the most modern hotel we stayed in during our excurion.  The rooms were very spacious and the amenities were great.  We decided to have dinner in the restaurant but did not have reservations.  Although the server asked if we had reservations, she did seat us and allowed us to order.  The food was delicious.",4,2014,07,29
240,Nice hotel aircon needs attention,"The air con in the room we were allocated on arrival did not work a call to reception and they sent 
someone to check it nothing could be done .We were offered a portable aircon unit which we declined .In the end we were given an up grade to a lovely room that looked as if we were in a different hotel .Check aircon on arrival would be my tip. Reception gave us complimentary car park on checkout  a nice touch I thought.Now the positives it is a lovely clean hotel and the breakfast was lovely.",3,2014,07,29
240,"Decent hotel, pity about a few things","Stayed here for one night, hotel itself was nice enough and rooms spacious. Unfortunately the air con didn't work and there were no windows in the room so didn't sleep well. Also the underground car park is an accident waiting to happen - water was leaking onto the floor in multiple spots and was lucky not to have a bad fall. Don't think I'll be rushing back.",2,2014,07,28
240,Pity about the cooking,"We recently had a meal at the Hilton. We sat outside and it was a beautiful sunny evening. Although the patio is located adjacent to a busy main road, it is nonetheless a very pleasant place to eat.

The service was excellent and the serving staff were efficient as well as being friendly and attentive. Full marks to them.

What lets it all down is the standard of the food and cooking; it is mediocre at best. The cod we tried was not particularly fresh and was possibly frozen but was certainly a few days past its sell-by date. What flavour it still had was overpowered by an unappetising bed of lintels etc. My sirloin steak, for which there was a ‚Ç¨7.00 supplement, was very tasty but was very small, was overcooked and as was as tough as old boots - the chips were good though. The cheesecake was extremely stodgy - not very nice at all.

The kitchen most definitely needs a good shake-up , i.e. it needs (at least) a new enthusiastic head chef . The raw materials clearly aren't particularly fresh or top-class in the first place, but the standard of cooking is second-rate and demonstrates little if any flair or imagination. Given the potential created by the ambience of the venue and the efficiency of the servers, it was quite disappointing really.",3,2014,07,28
240,Hmmm not quite,"Well given that a lot of people have taken the time to write their first ever and only tripadvisor review on this hotel AND give it 5 stars I thought it was going to be better. 
The good: reception very efficient and helpful.  The room size was good and I liked the location as there are some less touristy bars and places near. The hotel was modern and clean
The not so good: the air conditioning doesnt work and see this has been an issue in other reviews, on checkput the staff didnt seem too bothered about this. Sleeping was uncomfortable and to let air in we had the window opened which also allowed the smell off the kitchen in. Breakfast was average and buffet style. No offer of anything freshly cooked and dubious qulity in places. The in room fridge also didnt work.
The bar terrace was good for an evening drink as was the patriots inn over the road. 
Overall I dont think I would return. ",3,2014,07,27
240,Fantastic Stay,"From point of arrival nothing was too much trouble for a very welcoming staff. Local knowledge was excellent and reception helped to arrange our excursions for the three days of our visit. Hopper bus stop was just outside the hotel with easy access to city centre and all main attractions. Witching walking distance of the hotel were the Gaol, Art Gallery and Guinness Brewery. 
Breakfast was excellent and the one dinner taken was very good. 
Full marks and we'll worth a return visit.",5,2014,07,26
240,Hilton Kilmainham a great hotel,"Another great stay in the Hilton. Very high standards, beautiful modern spacious room and friendly staff. Located in a historic part of Dublin and adjacent to the modern art museum and gardens. highly recommended :)",5,2014,07,24
240,Reception Staff Amazing,Great location for Business in town.  Staff will help you with whatever you might need..they are amazing!   Rooms are huge and very clean. Has a gym and a pool as a big plus if you stay over a few nights!,5,2014,07,24
240,Terrible room smell,"Hoepfully this is not common, but I experienced a terrible room smell.  It smelled like cleaners, with an undertone of vomit and gasoline, so they may have been trying to clean up some nasty event, but they really needed to air the room out afterward (the window opened).  Arriving after a 16 hour international red-eye followed by business meetings before checking in, I made the mistake of collapsing and sleeping while it aired out, and my sinuses were really upset.",1,2014,07,23
240,Excellent hotel friendly and professionally staffed,My friend and I enjoyed our experience so much that we stayed and extra night. Everything is maintained to a high standard and the staff are excellent. I observed staff being very helpful to a range of guests. The bar food was very tasty. Location is close to sites of historical interest and transport to central Dublin was easily accessed on the efficient Luas service. I would return and would recommend this hotel.,5,2014,07,21
240,Don't be put off by the location...,"My sister booked this hotel last minute as we had concert tickets. It was very clean,comfortable and secure. Taxis  from the town centre were very reasonable.  Staff were very helpful as I needed to arrange to go to the airport the next morning and my sister wanted to stow her bag while she did some sightseeing. Breakfast was of a high standard. I shall use this as a base in Dublin in future.",5,2014,07,21
240,Perfect escape in Kilmainham but not from the jail!!!,"For my birthday my partner treated me to a night in the Hilton Kilmainham and a visit to the Olympia Theatre to see the brilliant Hall and Oates concert. It was without doubt the best birthday present ever. From arrival at check in at the Hilton to departure everything was first class. The staff from reception, restaurant, bar , house keeping and leisure centre were all first class and not forgetting the very helpful lad in the leisure centre. 
 Because it was my birthday , between my partner and reception staff I was treated to many extra surprises. The suite was beautiful, food delicious and the hydro therapy pool relaxing. Everything was so good my partner and I are now making the Hilton our official birthday hotel. Roll on December for my partners birthday.",5,2014,07,19
240,Always lovely,"My wife and I have stayed here a few times both with and without the children. It's always a pleasant stay here. The hotel itself is clean and modern. We were upgraded the last stay to a room with a view which was lovely. The room was, as always very clean and comfortable. The breakfast is very nice, the restaurant always we'll staffed so there's no long waits. The bar good is nice and of good quality but in my opinion a little overpriced. This really is the only negative point however. ",5,2014,07,16
240,Nice Hotel.....,"Stayed here the last week of June and it was a very nice, very clean hotel. They were undergoing some renovations but you hardly ever saw the workers. This hotel is located directly across from Kilmainham Gaol, which is a MUST see. It is a little bit out from the city center but we were able to utilize the hop on/hop off sight seeing buses to get to pretty much any place we wanted to go. 

My only real complaint would be that the a/c didn't work as well as I had hoped. I never complained about it but would have liked for it to blow a little harder. Maybe due to the renovations that were going on. Not sure.",4,2014,07,15
240,Very Nice Staff,"We stayed here for two nights. Our trip to Ireland was planned around our son's 21st birthday. The staff inquired about the reason for our trip and made a special point to send him a wonderful dessert tray, delivered to his room, to help him celebrate. We arrived at 10AM and they were happy to store our luggage and allowed us to use the facilities in the health club to freshen up. The location is great for those looking for a bit more peaceful environment, yet a short bus or taxi ride to the heart of the action. Right across the street from a ""Hop on, Hop off"" bus stop which is very convenient. There is a small Italian restaurant right across the street (2nd floor above the bar on the corner) that has great food (I know, Italian food in Ireland?). The hotel staff over the weekend we were there were wonderful. They remembered our names every time we saw them and were a wealth of information. I feel bad I did not write down their names so I could mention them in this review, they deserve it! I highly  recommend this hotel.",5,2014,07,15
240,excellence,"I would jus like to say we had a very enjoyable stay at the Hilton hotel in kilmainham dublin ,the staff were very helpful and polite.the food in the bar was very good,and the breakfast was excellent.we will return.",5,2014,07,14
240,very good,Stayed here for 2 nights. Everything was very good.  Staff on reception was very helpful.  Thanks them very much.   Also visited pool and gym. Good quality of service. Good location of the hotel. Near nice park.  I recommend this hotel.,5,2014,07,12
240,Perfect place to stay when in Dublin,What a great place to stay when in Dublin. The staff are both friendly efficient and helpful. The bar restaurant serves great food and I enjoyed a great pint of Guinness. Your only 10 euro by taxi from St Stephens Green in the heart of the city and opposite the hotel is Kilmainham jail which is open for tours along with the Art museum. Your also only 10 minutes from the Guinness brewery which also runs tours. Rooms are clean and comfortable . I'll definately stay here again.  ,4,2014,07,12
240,Exceptional!,"Attended a business meeting here and after many nights in hotels in different countries that promised amenities that weren't really there it was a relief to have a good restaurant, a comfortable king size bed, air conditioning that worked, a great room, friendly, helpful service, and really warm people helping me to get in a little bit of site seeing when I didn't have lot of time in between meetings.  I would come back here in a heart beat.  It felt like home!",5,2014,07,11
240,Fantastic Hotel,"This is an excellent Hotel, great location with plenty of parking. Staff are friendly and extremely helpful. Highly recommend this Hotel. Joanne in reservations was one of the friendliest we have come across during our trip.",5,2014,07,10
240,Book Hilton and Brian O'Reilly to get the very best of Ireland,"Excellent staff at the Hilton.   All very helpful especially Ann Marie!  We took a couple of day trips
to Wicklow and Dublin to get a feel of the land with Brian O'Reilly who was wonderful and very
knowledgeable and he took great care of us .  We were very fortunate to have  inside information on places to eat which were fabulous especially Anglers Rest! Our two weeks in Ireland
was a 10!!!",5,2014,07,06
240,Brilliant Holiday Stay,"The Hilton at Kilmainham was great place to stay, the amenities, the location and especially the staff.  My sisters and I stayed for 5 days and had all of our needs catered to.  The staff was spot on and of note, Anne Marie really went above and beyond.  We felt really well taken care of, the team at the front desk and in restaurant/bar were exceptional.",5,2014,07,06
240,Top class hotel,Superb hotel. All staff are extremely professional and friendly . Our room was immaculate and spacious with the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. We ate in the bar and the food was mouth watering . Could not find any faults .  Will definitely return . ,5,2014,07,05
240,Enjoyed the Kilmainham,"Excellent and cheerful staff, clean rooms.  Easy to and from the airport and the city center.  Could use an easier to access plug from the desk, especially given the mammoth side of outlet plugs in Ireland.",5,2014,07,04
240,Comfortable clean and friendly. ,"We had a lovely stay at this Hilton. Room was clean and staff were friendly. Only downside to this hotel is the distance from Dublin centre, is a solid 20-25 minute walk j to town. However being on the red bus route means it's easy enough to get anywhere. 
We had a good stay here and loved the view of the historic kilmainham prison, our primary reason for choosing this hotel. 
Wouldn't have any hesitation in recommending this hotel. ",4,2014,07,02
240,"Great hotel, next to the jail ","Great hotel stayed for 3 nights not far from the centre, only 5 mins walk to bus stop and 10 mins to metro. Located next to the jail, great buffet breakfast all varieties, friendly hotel staff and great swimming and leisure facilities. Would recommend",5,2014,07,02
240,Good location for gigs at Kilmainham,"Slightly disappointed with Hillton. I agree with last review, our room was too hot and stuffy, in fact most of the hotel was too hot. Room clean, bed comfy, bathroom clean, does the job for a night I suppose.
We paid extra for king room with a view on the 5th floor but view is totally spoilt by this weird wire netting thing around windows ( what was the designer thinking) don't understand why Hilton put that up, it spoils view so wish I had saved money and booked normal room.
Location good for concerts in Kilmainham  but a bit of a trek into Dublin town.
Was expecting better I'm sorry to say.",3,2014,07,01
240,"Comfortable enough, friendly and helpful staff - but a long way from Dublin's sites","The rooms are certainly up to Hilton standards, notably the bed, and the staff were very friendly and helpful - albeit overwhelmed at times. But the carefully worded blurb on the hotel website avoids telling would-be visitors that you will be a long way from central Dublin i.e. O'Connell Street: ""Hilton Dublin Kilmainham offers an ideal location opposite the Kilmainham Gaol, the Royal Hospital Kilmainham and the Irish Museum of Modern Art. The hotel is also within walking distance to Heuston Station and Phoenix Park."" Certainly, the hotel is opposite Kilmainham Gaol, which is a great site to visit, a must-see. It's also next to the Royal Hospital Kilmainham but it will take you 20 minutes to walk to Heuston station, more to walk to Phoenix Park. (The nearest LUAS/tram stop is Suir Road (‚Ç¨2.10 from O‚ÄôConnell Street), which is 10 minutes walk).

What we were not told was that there would be very loud gigs going on for 2 of the 3 nights of our stay, which apart from the noise (which did end at 11pm), the bar was inundated with gig-goers for certain parts of the evening. If you are desperate for a drink and don't want to fight your way to the bar, use room service.

Despite being away from Dublin centre, however, if you are looking for a tour of Dublin, both the Dublin sight seeing bus firms have a stop outside the Kilmainham Gaol, opposite the hotel, where you can buy a 2-day ticket. From Stop No. 16 outside the Gaol to Phoenix Park takes about 15 minutes on the bus, 30-40 minutes from the Gaol stop to the start of the tour on O'Connell Street, and about an hour to get to the Guinness Storehouse. Problem is that the buses only go clockwise. Make sure you get the live commentary with pretty good jokes.

If you are driving to the hotel, there is another problem that you may not anticipate. Surprisingly, the hotel has no drive-in forecourt where you would unload your luggage. Without instructions on the web site, we had to park in the taxi bay in front of the hotel, and seek advice inside. Fortunately, the more than helpful staff member told me to drive into the car park (to the left of the hotel) and unload at basement level. We did this only to find the helpful staff member waiting with a cart to take our luggage upstairs. Great service - but some warning of this procedure from the hotel management would have been helpful. Not needing the rental car in Dublin, we then returned it - but that's another story, where again our staff member was very helpful.

Yes, the breakfast coffee does tend to be a tad stewed and warm rather than hot but the buffet breakfast fare is good, especially the bacon. We did not try dinner. However, we did enjoy a couple of pints on the terrace in the sun before the decibel count got higher across in the hospital. Quite a few gig-goers stay at the hotel.

So, if you have plenty of time for leisurely tours of Dublin and you want a comfortable hotel, the Kilmainham Hilton is fine. If you are a Gold or Diamond HHonors member, however, there is no executive club. If we return to Dublin, we might want a more centrally located hotel, which would be more expensive. A taxi to the airport runs at about ‚Ç¨35, to Fitzwilliam Square and the Georgia area about ‚Ç¨12.",4,2014,07,01
240,Disappointing,"Stayed here last weekend (28th June ) and I have to say I was very disappointed as I laid a lot for the room and as it was a Hilton Hotel I expected a higher standard of service than I received. The hotel itself was clean and tidy but when we got up to our room it was so hot it was stifling. The air conditioning didn't work and I contacted reception who said they would sort it out. I waited for about 20 mins or so and I gave up and went down to reception. They said someone would be up now and so I went to the bar to get a drink to cool me down. When I went up to the room they had installed a portable air con unit which also didn't work as their was no ice water in it and it was so noisy you couldn't hear yourself think. I didn't have time to hang around as I was going out so I left the fan on hoping that it might make a difference by the time I got back bit it hadn't . As it was so noisy I had to turn it off to get to sleep and I kept waking up throughout the night as it was so hot. Then to cap it all when I did eventually get up in the morning there was no hot water in the tap at the sink, shower was fine though. Breakfast was not great as the team and coffee we got was cold and stewed .Like I say you come to expect a certain standard from a hotel group like Hilton and this is why I was so very disappointed. Would I stay here again, I don't think so.",2,2014,06,30
240,Perfectly fine for an Overnighter ,"Stayed one night to attend gig at the Royal Hospital Kilmainham. 

Perfect location - 2 minute walk.

Bit disappointed that our room wasn't ready for more than an hour after published check-in time & the receptionist who said she would come & get us in the bar never appeared. Blaming a tour group arriving is not a credible excuse... You know they're coming & we've been booked for 6 months - just get the right number of rooms ready.

Room fine, if a bit warm - even after fiddling with aircon. 

Breakfast ... A grand post-gig recovery meal.

Bottom line...
If we were to go to another gig at the same location, we'd stay here again. ",4,2014,06,29
240,Great Location,"Stayed twice in one week at the Hilton Dublin Kilmainham.  The rooms were comfortable and in line with what I expect from a Hilton (Diamond).  I had dinner one time in the restaurant with outdoor seating, several times had adult beverages in the bar and had breakfast in the restaurant buffet.  Overall, an excellent experience with no complaints.  It is located within walking distance of the Houston Train Station, which also has the tram/train station, across from an art gallery/park and across from the old Kilmainham prison.  I had dinner across the street two nights and that is another review.  No regrets and an excellent experience.",5,2014,06,29
240,Nice hotel,"The hotel was nice, excellent location for concerts in royal hospital Kilmainham....but we were made to feel embarrassed as we wanted to pay with cash. The receptionist had to check that this was ok....and we had to stand aside while this got approval (we also had to pay a deposit).",3,2014,06,28
240,Modern Luxury,"If you prefer a modern hotel to some of the older, typical Irish or European hotels this is a great place to stay.  All the modern conveniences, good restaurant and bar, and great location.  It is convenient to the Guinness Storehouse, Jameson Distillery and Kilmainham Goal.  You are only a short walk to the Tram and Hop-on/Hop-off buses stop across the street.  Convenient to the airport if you have an early morning flight home.",5,2014,06,25
240,Luxury affordable mini-break,"We stayed for the weekend and had a lovely relaxing time.  Beautiful and clean pool and spa facilities.  Very friendly attentive staff.  Quality of food, both at dinner and breakfast, outstanding.  Cocktails in 4 corners bar were very refreshing. Rooms clean and comfortable. Taxi into Dublin 10 Euro.  Kilmainham jail located opposite the hotel is well worth a visit.",5,2014,06,24
240,Excellent Service,"The hotel was very clean and service oriented.  Any issues we had with the stay were handled quickly and wonderfully by the staff.  We would stay here again and again. Hotel is directly across from a hop-on, hop-off bus stop.",5,2014,06,24
240,Lovely stay,"My family and I stayed here recently, three rooms for 2 nights. We arrived in the morning well before check in and as expected our rooms were not ready. Our bags were stored and we went off to explore the city. The hop on hop off bus is conveniently located right across the street outside the Kilmainham goal. When we returned our rooms were ready and our luggage had already been placed in one of the rooms. As requested the rooms were all on the same floor and near each other. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. The supply of towels in the room is not as generous as most hotels I have stayed at but this seems to be the norm for European hotels. I did ask for an extra towel one evening and it was promptly brought to my room.

The staff at the front desk was very friendly and accommodating.  I would like to in particular mention Ann Marie. The hotel was fully booked and the front desk staff was busy but she was especially caring. She remembered that our room keys would need updating on our second day and proactively approached us in the lobby before we set out on our tour for the day. She also offered us umbrellas on one occasion as we were going out and it was about to rain. We requested a late check out and Ann Marie was once again helpful and was able to make that happen.  She was great and the hotel was nice.

Also, there was a great Italian restaurant across the street, La Dolce Vita.

I would stay at this hotel again and would recommend it to others.",4,2014,06,22
240,Very good,"Just one night, but i was impressed. Big rooms, clean and looks new. There was a bit of a hold up at check in due to computer problems, but they gave me a free wifi code, and a drink while I waited - as it turned out, only a few minutes. Breakfast was good, though even with a discount voucher was 12 Euro. It was handy for where I was going - I'm not sure how long it would take you into the centre of Dublin",5,2014,06,20
240,the lone traveller,this hotel is clean comfortable with large rooms and what I most enjoy large beds. I've used the pool facilities on previous occasions and it is relaxing with all round spa if necessary. not particularly good for a swim but definitely enjoyable.,4,2014,06,19
240,Classic Hilton property,Stayed here for a long weekend. Turned out to be a great location near Phoenix Park and the Kilmainham Gaol. Easy walk to city. Our room and bed were very comfortable and the breakfast hit the spot. Suited our needs perfectly and we were happy to have made this choice.,4,2014,06,17
240,Dependable Hilton,"After three years of continuous travel, it is always nice to stay at a Hilton.  This hotel is exactly what you expect from a Hilton.  Not five star, but comfortable and clean with plentiful breakfast options.  The bar service was a bit slow and the location far from the city center but it was conveniently located to the Gaol and the Guinness Storehouse which are the top attractions in Dublin.  The walk to the city center/shopping area is quite long and doesn't exactly look like the best of neighborhoods in some parts.  We walked it with our three children one evening but only because we couldn't find a taxi big enough for five.  Not sure I would stay here again.  In the future I would probably choose something closer to the center, but I don't honestly see myself ever going back to Dublin.",4,2014,06,16
240,Family weekend in Dublin,"My family and I recently spent a weekend in Dublin and stayed in this hotel. The location was perfect for us as we traveled from Cork so did not need to get caught up in the city traffic. It is a 15 minute walk to Dublin Zoo and the Luas Line in Heuston is only 10 mins away - perfect for heading into the city centre. The hotel amenities were great, lovely food and in particular I must mention the fantastic staff. They really went out of their way to make our stay an enjoyable one, nothing was too much trouble. It was our son's birthday while we were there and they even gave him a lovely cake with candles on the day - a perfect personal touch and very much appreciated. A great memorable family weekend, thank you to all the staff at the Hilton, Kilmainham.",5,2014,06,16
240,"Stop-Over in the Hilton Kilmainham, Dublin",We stayed one night in the Hotel. Everything was excellent - specally the internet and the breakfeast. The only thing was - the Hotel is about 3 km of the Temple-district - but you can take a bus and so it is easy. There is the prison nearby - you should visit it.,5,2014,06,15
240,Our last night in Ireland,"Outstanding hotel. Friendly staff, clean, comfortable, quiet and located close to a bus stop. Directly across the street from the Irish Museum of Modern Art and the Kilmainham Gaol. The hotel is a bit of a walk (20 minutes or so) from central city, but in all other cases, I would highly recommend it.",5,2014,06,13
240,Beautiful Property but not close to the heart of the city,"While we liked the cleanliness and the air conditioning at the Hilton, we were disappointed that it was not near anything in the city. It was across from the old gaol (jail) but other than that you needed a taxi or a bus. There were very few restaurants nearby. The food at the Hilton was very good but the service was slow. The biggest plus of this hotel is the helpful front desk staff.",4,2014,06,12
240,This should be a Hampton not a Hilton,"Our room had no pictures in it at all, just mirrors.  The view out the room was mesh wires.  The pillows were 2"" thick.  Got to say this his nothing like other Hilton hotels we have stayed at, expected more from this Brand.

‚Ç¨12 to park the car overnight in addition to paying for the hotel room.  

For a capital city hotel there was no city info on the Television
Twin Beds linked together, when we ask for a King/Queen/Full.  Why? 
does anyone paint a room a color other then white?

They wanted us to pay ‚Ç¨19 to check in early but we did for free when we got there at noon. Don't go for that extra charge.",3,2014,06,11
240,Family event in Dublin,"I have stayed in this hotel twice. It is very clean, modern and comfortable. Prices vary from site to site but if you pick your moment you can get very good value for money especially considering the central location. I didn't use the hotels full facilities of gym, dining etc as i was just using the hotel for a base so i cant comment on these but the hotel is relatively new and seems well run so id imagine these are good too. Staff in general were welcoming and helpful and accommodating from my experience of them on both occasions.",5,2014,06,11
240,"Good place to stay, very expensive.","We stayed here while attending a show in the RDS.
On the map the hotel didn't seem too far from the city centre but after you take the Luas, you then have a bit of a walk until you reach the hotel.
We booked a double room with breakfast the next morning, which cost quite a bit (can't remember exactly how much), we looked into the on site restaurant but it was very expensive and not much choice.
Our breakfast was lovely the next morning, there was a large variety of food too choose from, both hot and cold, and a range of juices.
We took advantage of the pool and spa facilities included in the room price, but were quite annoyed that we were made to purchase swim caps, as stated as a spa rule, but the majority of people using the pool didn't have one one.

Would go back again but it's very dear.",4,2014,06,10
240,Hiton Hotel in Dublin,"Overall the experience was good. It is a nice hotel with a nice bar and an accommodating staff. However if you called early in the morning they did not pick up and if you showed up early sometimes there was no one manning the front desk. The bar area was very nice. The breakfasts were fabuols and the dining room staff very accommodating. The front desk female staff should smile. their look was too stern. The maid was pretty cheap with replacing soap, tissues and shower caps.  Don't know why, it was not her money.",4,2014,06,10
240,Good stay,"Had enjoyable stay B&B stay at this hotel for nearby wedding, room rate was good for Dublin prices, family room suited our needs. Hotel provided child minder who was a staff member on 1 of our nights stay, [childminder was hotel staff but paid directly] 
Ordered room service but there is a 5.50 charge even if only ordering 1 item from menu",4,2014,06,10
240,Good Choice,"While this hotel is not located close to many of the sights and the tourist attractions of Dublin, it is close to Kilmainham Gaol and the nearby public transportation makes it easy enough to get around Dublin. Our room was beautifully appointed, and although it overlooked the street, it was completely quiet, The bed was comfortable, the bathroom and room were both well appointed. We ate lunch at the bar - the food was very good but the service was terrible and they weren't even busy. 

We stayed here our last night in Dublin before heading out to the airport early the next day so when we asked at the front desk about a taxi to the airport, they had us talk to the concierge. Turns out the concierge also runs a tour business and offered to take us to the airport in his van for a flat rate of 25 Euros, assured us he would be there early - and he was. The best part of the ride to the airport was that he gave us all sorts of information about Ireland, talked a little about his own family and life and it made the drive to the airport very entertaining.
If you want to be away from the tourist attractions, this hotel would be a good choice but otherwise there are better options in Dublin.",4,2014,06,09
240,Nothing special but helpful staff,"Overall not quite up to Hilton standards for the price. I would prefer the Charelemont or Conrad over this for not dissimilar prices. Poor ventilation in the rooms and hit and miss service - some great, some average. Average breakfast and restaurant not very child friendly. Good location for some things but would only stay again if I knew that they had improved some aspects.",3,2014,06,09
240,B+ But Could Easily Be An A-,"The Hilton Kilmainham Dublin is a modern business oriented hotel that is also suitable for tourists. It is located near Dublin's Heuston Rail Station and the old Kilmainham Jail (Gaol). This location is kind of on the edge of where most tourists will want to be in Dublin. It still works since the hop-off / hop-on buses stop right across the street. But beware - the GrayLine hop-on stop running really early - i.e. you'll be catching a cab home from Temple Bar after dinner. The Dublin City Bus Hop-ons run later.

Not sure why, but like so many Hilton's I've stayed in lately (and that's a lot - I've been Diamond for a decade), this one just felt tired. They just don;t seem to be upgrading their properties on a timely basis. For example, the property around this building (stairs on the long side) led down to a no mans land filled with litter. The lobby furniture is also way past code date.

Rooms are nice, but all face a busy street (hence have windows tightly sealed). And the rooms just don't have a fresh air smell. There is no executive lounge. And, while they offer a free breakfast, it was EXACTLY the same each and every day of my 3 night stay.

Staff was very helpful. When it looked like it might rain I was offered a nice umbrella with my walking map.  

So all in all a mixed bag. It is far from perfect. I'd say that to keep justifying premium rates, it is overdue for some upgrading, general freshening and some creativity. Add some uniquely Irish/Dublin touches!

A tip: If you are arriving by air. Cab fare with tip will be almost 42E from DUB. So, If there is just one or two traveling in your party consider the Airlink bus to the last stop at Heuston Train Station (6E OW / 10E RT), then grab a cab for the short leg to the hotel for 4E. If you are fit and packed light it is an easy walk. Just walk parallel to the tracks and cross the street. Take  the first left and you are there.

If you need a cab, then let the Hilton call for you as they have negotiated a 25E flat rate fare from the hotel to the airport. However, be aware, the cabbie still adds 1E each for each item he puts in the trunk.    

Enjoy Dublin!",4,2014,06,08
240,A Great Hilton,"My first time stay in this Hilton and I was impressed overall. Service was great except for a snotty manager with broken English in the Bar Lounge but not holding that against the hotel and the rest of the staff. Rooms were awesome, we had the upgraded rooms from using Hilton Honors ( so glad we did ) Location I loved just the the edge of the City center ( stayed in the center last year and was too much with the kids ) Hotel was clean and font desk staff were exceptional, loved the bar food, really bar food which I like. Bar service staff were great, we had a large party of people one evening and they kept up specially Aidan he did a great job.",5,2014,06,07
240,First class,"I traveled with a group and was pleased by the high standards at the hotel.  My room was modern, clean, and very pleasant.  Several of us had to leave early in the morning to catch our transport to the airport.  The hotel provided a very suitable quick breakfast for us in the lobby area.  This gesture was much appreciated.",5,2014,06,06
240,"Great Hotel, right opposite the Kilmainham Gaol!","We like this hotel very much, very convenient as we wanted to visit the top attraction (Gaol) and my husband went jogging in the huge Phoenix Park only a few streets away.  Very beautiful inner city park area....huge....even has free roaming deers to see.  We took the bus to the city, it was very convenient for us only one street away from hotel.  Our room was clean, modern and with lovely furniture, tea & coffee making facilities and everyday a free bottle of spring water for each of us!  We also had a small fridge which was very good as we bought some Irish cheese from the supermarket, it was so delicious with crackers.  We had a view to the street (front of hotel) so the first night (Saturday) was a bit noisy .....the Irish really love to yell their lungs out when they are drunk!  The staff were friendly and helpful, we forgot our electrical adaptor, rang reception and they advised us we could purchase one at their machine on the 1st floor for ‚Ç¨5....for us a very helpful solution.  We walked to the Guiness Storehouse from the hotel and back again, we like walking....it takes about 20 minutes one way.  The only thing we couldnt rave about at this hotel was the breakfast room itself, it needs refurbishing and some new furniture ....however the breakfast buffet was fantastic, everything the heart could desire, the ""steel-cut oatmeal"" was our favorite, couldnt get enough and tastes wonderful with the fruits of the forest compote on top......We also enjoyed a good Irish beer at the bar on our last night.  A nice atmosphere and view to the Modern Art Museum old historic gate across the street.  Check-out was done in a flash and a friendly taxi driver was waiting on the taxi stand right outside the hotel .....we would definitely stay here again.  We also used the fitness room and spa downstairs which was free for hotel guests.",4,2014,06,05
240,Great experience,"I was worried upon booking that this hotel would be too far from the town center, but that isn't the case. My boyfriend and I were able to get around no problem, and actually liked being slightly off the busy downtown streets. I unfortunately had an accident prior to our trip and needed a wheelchair to get around comfortably. The hotel couldn't have been more accommodating, lending me a wheelchair as needed. Will be recommending this Hilton to family and friends!",4,2014,06,03
240,Consistent hotel,"Through business I have stayed at the Hilton Kilmainham over the last 3 years. I pretty much know the hotel inside out. I haven't spent as much time over the last year but most things have stayed the same. 

Location - Yes as others have said, the hotel is not central. Taxi to Temple Bar should cost in region of ‚Ç¨10. From the hotel take the immediate right and after a 15 minute walk there is an Italian restaurant and a pub, the red lion. Both good places. I've never eat or drank at the pub and Italian restaurant over the road so can't comment. From the hotel and left, straight across the road you can walk 10 minutes to the main bus route into the centre. Also Dublin tour bus stops outside. 

Rooms - From standard up to executive, all rooms are clean and comfortable. If you are lucky some of the park facing rooms with balcony are really nice. You are given a key to the outside balcony which can be nice on a sunny day. My one issue with the rooms is the AC. This can be temperamental and sometimes ineffective. This can be on a room basis but sometimes across many. 

Food - The main restaurant is very good, the quality of the food is excellent. As with most places in Dublin, the prices can be expensive. The bar area also offers simple bar food, this has changed many times. Most recently the food was very good. I'd recommend the monkfish curry. Breakfast is good and there are a good range of things to choose from. You can order specific items if not available from self service i.e. Poached eggs. 

Service - Reception staff are friendly and helpful. If you require anything, they are normally quick to cater for your needs. Bar staff and waiter staff are quick to see to you. Service can slow down when the bar is busy, which is expected. 

Fitness suite - The hotel has a good gym as this also offers non resident membership. Peak times can be busy around 5-6pm. There are many treadmills, cross trainers and bikes for cardio. There are a few resistance machines as well as a free weights area. There are spin classes in the evening which are quite intense. There is also a pool which is more of a spa area but nice and relaxing. 

Overall this is a very good hotel with comfortable rooms and good service. 

",4,2014,06,02
240,"Average hotel, far from the centre","This is by far not the best Hilton hotel I've stayed in.
It is relative far from town, the rooms are not very luxury, the bar and restaurant average, the price is not.
Wifi is not complementary, but can be asked for, depending upon the front desk person you'll get 12 hours free up to 5 days.
The beds are ok, the minibar empty. One of the days it took them to 5 PM before they made the room (after we complained).

I will take my business elsewhere next time.",3,2014,06,02
240,Great Stay,"We have stayed at this Hilton several times before and enjoyed this stay also very much.  We are traveling with our grandson and it is sometimes very hard to get a ""family room"" in Ireland, but not here.  Great room, great view, spotlessly clean and comfortable.  The wi-fi is easy to access and fast.  It is a bit out of town, but the hop-on-hop-off tour bus stops right outside.  Also Dublin city buses run nearby and the staff is great with information.  We got the B&B rate and the breakfast is great.  The staff is excellent and helpful.  Children's hours in the pool are somewhat limited so check with the desk to avoid disappointment.  Great place to stay and price was in line with the city.",5,2014,06,01
240,Great hotel ,"I've stayed here several times on business, and have always found the hotel clean, welcoming and well located if you want to stay outside the city centre; it's only a 10 minute walk from the red line of the Luas light rail stop. I've always found the food to be really good.
The only reason for 4 stars was that the air conditioning in my room didn't seem to cool the room at all, but this is a minor point for an otherwise great hotel.",4,2014,05,30
240,Cannot go wrong,"I stayed with my wife and 3-year-old

Kind and understanding staff, all was good. We stayed for three nights. Clean and safe for kids. If I go to Dublin again, I certainly stay here. My daughter enjoyed the stay as well.",5,2014,05,30
240,15 Minutes to Downtown Historic Dublin,A group of 30 of us from our church took a 10-day tour bus vacation around Ireland.  Our first stop was checking into the Hilton Dublin in Kilmainham.  The hotel was about 15 minutes away by taxi from historic Dublin. Be prepared to take a taxi if you want to visit the sites and restaurants in downtown Dublin.   The hotel itself was well-appointed and had amenities such as separate showers and soaking tubs.  Their breakfast buffet was extremely generous and the staff was very accommodating.  Lovely hotel.,5,2014,05,29
240,Excellent service,"Staff is really kind and always looking for opportunities to be of service. The Hotel is very welcoming, clean and quiet.  You can find a nice variety of food with great taste at the breakfast. Definitely recommended.",5,2014,05,29
240,Loved this hotel,"This hotel was fantastic from start to finish ,staff couldnt be more helpfull, nothing was a problem which made our stay so much more relaxing,rooms were unreal, food was great, an hydro pool topped it off, great for kids as my daughter had a ball, cant wait to get back to this hotel.",5,2014,05,28
240,comfy beds and good sized rooms,"Comfy beds, good sized rooms, mostly good food but choice a bit limited and sandwiches for conference lunch not good e.g. bread dry. Breakfast and dinner were good.I would definitely stay here again but they should do better with the lunch.",4,2014,05,28
240,Great Taxi Driver/Tour Guide from Kilmainham Hilton,"We spent 3 days at the Kilmainham Hilton and were transferring to another location when we happened upon Brian O'Reilly, a taxi driver and guide who you can ask for through the Hilton.  We liked him so much that we asked him to take us on a tour outside of Dublin.  He was great fun, always entertaining and courteous the entire day.  As we weren't sure where to go, Brian planned a tour to the Wicklow Mountains, Powerscourt Gardens, beautiful waterfalls, and all the fun spots (P.S. I love you set locations, set location for The Vikings, Guinness Lakes, Johnnie Fox's, etc.)  He went above and beyond for us making sure we had a fantastic time. We really enjoyed his company and the tour was one of the highlights of our trip to Ireland.  I would highly recommend Brian if you are looking for a private tour around Dublin or the surrounding areas.  His van is comfortable for 6 (though we were just 4 persons).  Our last day in Dublin he took us to the airport and was great fun.",5,2014,05,28
240,Dublin visit,Hotel staff is very friendly and helpful.  Rooms are clean and spacious.  Only thing would not recommend is the breakfast.  There was a great cafe right next door that was excellent so we went there the remainder of the stay.  Great location just use the hop on/hop off bus right outside the door.,5,2014,05,28
240,"hotel was very nice, but location could have been better...","The hotel was very nice and typical of the Hilton brand. They were super accommodating and allowed us to check into our room upon our 7 am arrival from the US which was a lifesaver! I can't say a bad thing about this hotel itself - the breakfast was fabulous every morning. The staff was helpful. The only drawback was the location - while it was located right across from a major tourist attraction (the Kilmainham Gaol) and on a tourist bus stop, it was isolated in terms of restaurants for dinner. After a day of sightseeing, the last thing you wanted was to go out again and walk a mile or more to a restaurant. The restaurant across the corner - ewww, don't bother. The lunch place on the other side of Amazon - definitely go there!",4,2014,05,27
240,Overall,The hotel is very nice but the staff I experienced were not. The rooms on the top floor are very noisy due to fan noise at night time. The aircon was not working. The bar staff were rude and the off duty kitchen staff drank in the bar and were incredibly noisy. The hotel as a building is very nice tho!,1,2014,05,22
240,professional business hotel,Very good staff. I was taken care of and they even encouraged me to taste irish drinks. I was avoiding drinks as most of them where not familiar for me so the staffs  compelled me to taste atleast 5 or 6 drinks to check if i like em.  They always helped me in selecting my food as the food was also not familiar for me.   Housekeeping was excellent.   It will be nice if no additional charges are collected for room services. 5 Euro is too high atleast consider reducing it.  Room services give more encouragement for travelers like me to try more irish dishes,5,2014,05,19
240,Mrs Lorraine Cummins,Lovely spot.out of Dublin centre..but close enough if you want you get bus in.perfect location for phoneix park..zoo..kilmainham jail..museum of modern art.. All round lovely hotel..rooms.staff..cleanliness. .couldn't fault it.,4,2014,05,19
240,Dissapointing,"Just back from an overnight at the Hilton Hotel Kilmainham.  Well firstly, the hotel is a lovely hotel very modern and clean.  The location is good and only a short tram/bus journey to the city centre.  My daughter had recommended the hotel to us as she had stayed there on several occasions and she told me to request a room at the front of the hotel when I was booking online as they are lovely bright rooms and she always puts in this request when booking and manages to secure one.   I did this,  however, when I arrived at the hotel the receptionist said there was no such request on my booking and when I showed her my copy of the booking with the request printed on it she said the request had not filtered through to reception! She said the hotel was fully booked and she didn't have any rooms at the front of the hotel available, but oddly, she could upgrade me to a front room for ‚Ç¨20 extra!!  We were given a room at the back of the hotel with what she said had a 'Phoenix Park' view, only if you had a very strong pair of binoculars with you!!  We went for dinner and I have to say the dinner menu is very limited.  I choose the chicken breast which was very 'chewy', disappointing to say the least.  My husband opted for the 'special' which was roast beef and although not great it was definitely the better of the two. The breakfast the following morning was awful the tea tasted of a mixture of coffee and tea, obviously the pot had not been rinsed out adequately before the tea was made in it.  The plates were freezing even though they were sitting in the plate heater and by the time we walked back to the table with the bacon and eggs they were freezing.  Such a shame as there was a good selection of mixed fruit and cold meats/cheeses.  When we were checking out  the receptionist said she will guarantee us a room at the front of the house on our next stay!! Too little too late.",3,2014,05,19
240,Ok Hilton,"The location worked for me. 700 metres from the last stop for the airport bus or 25 euro fixed price in a taxi.

Easy buses into temple bar or the centre if twin and lots to do nearby. Kidnaping am jail is across the street, the Guinness brewery is easy walking distance and the city park is even closer including its wild deer.

The hotel itself is an average Hilton. Breakfast was nothing special.

Big kudos goes to Anna at check in who spent time making me aware of attractions, walking me through the city map and sorting out a problem with my gold status. Full marks to her.

The room was fine. No mini bar but each floor has a central vending machine for drinks. There is no executive lounge.

There is a supermarket and laundromat about a block away and a good corner pub diagonally opposite.

I would stay here again.",4,2014,05,17
240,"Very good value, clean, comfortable and convenient","Very convenient to both Heuston station and the city.  

Stayed for one night with friends recently - great value for money, staff very friendly and helpful.  

Had snack in the bar on arrival - suited our needs perfectly.  Felt that the glasses in the bar could have been cleaned/polished better and the white wine not chilled enough at all - apart from that, it was lovely.  

Room very clean, spacious and comfortable.

Breakfast - lots of choice so everyone should be happy.  Again, staff very friendly and helpful. 

Short taxi to the city centre - not at all inconvenient.

Would definitely stay here again",4,2014,05,14
240,Dirty and poor service,"I was at this hotel for a conference, I didn't stay in a room, but we were catered for two days and one dinner. The food was standard pastries and scones which were ok.  
The coffee was weak, and the whole thing was arranged in a awkward way that made queuing difficult. 

There was no water on the tables at lunch, it was very difficult to extract coffee or tea from the staff at lunch, and the sandwiches seem to have been filled and prepared without care or attention. Some were clearly just filled with leftover salad, others had been crushed!

The staff were unresponsive, with two in particular being extremely rude. It was hard to get any attention, even harder to actually obtain any requests, which were generally greeted with a grunt.

The worst thing of all however was the extremely low level of cleanliness. All of the carpets appeared to be stained with food, and the after-effects of a function that was probably a party. There were cigarette butts and chewing gum wrappers strewn about. Very disappointing, I would have been most embarrassed to have such a low quality experience for my clients.",2,2014,05,14
240,Very Nice Hotel,Just stopped over for the night whilst on road trip around Ireland.  Hotel is not a typical Hilton - much nicer than that.  Reception staff were extremely efficient and very friendly and helpful.  Room was lovely very modern - lovely comfy bed.  Spa was not huge but perfectly sufficient and spotless. Ate in the diner and not the restaurant - nice enough if somewhat expensive. Service impeccable.  Breakfast buffet style again very nice.,4,2014,05,12
240,"Service, Location, People","What a great hotel, I stayed here for three days at the end of April, a very friendly greeting on arrival and a free cup of coffee because my room was not ready.  The room, in fact the entire hotel is a great example of green smart.  They make extensive use of LED lights that are motion sensitive, right down to a small light right in the top door jamb of the room to light the door.  

Service was excellent in the restaurant and the bar, watch out for the signs though the restaurant sign and menu is right by the bar entrance.  Good food and pricing was in line with outside restaurants.

It was easy to travel into the heart of Dublin and this hotel is far enough away from the mad rush to qualify as a haven.

Parking is under the hotel and it's tight which is pretty normal for Ireland, if you do pick up a car get a small one, think Mini as a normal size and you will be OK.  Very easy access to the main roads and general transportation. 

A great three days there.",5,2014,05,10
240,Great hotel in a great city!!,"I booked this hotel as it was a good and affordable option in Dublin, however was a little hesitant of the location being out of the city (kilmainham).
This ended up being my favourite part of the hotel! it was lovely walking each day to the bus stop to get into the city, and getting to see all the little houses and areas in Dublin.

The hotel itself was lovely! pretty standard for the hilton, the rooms were decently sized, shower was nice and the breakfast was good. 
I had great service from the guy who checked us in and out, i think his name was James or something like that. He gave us a map, told us where to shop and gave us great advice as he was checking us in. thanks to him, our dublin adventures were so much better as we knew how to get around!

Travelling just after christmas time, i was a fan of the beautiful decorations in the lobby. one thing that was disappointing was that we were not notified of the changes in gym and pool opening times. unfortunately because of this we did not get to take advantage of this.

Breakfast was nothing special, but provided a good start to the day. I was travelling with a friend who is a celiac and could not have any gluten, and each day they provided her with gluten free bread. unfortunately they misadvised her about the other options she could eat, and she was sick for the rest of the day. easy mistake but should be looked into to make sure it doesnt happen again.

Overall i have very fond memories of this hotel, and would say that after travelling through Europe and staying in various Hiltons, it ranks in the top 3 for me!
i would not even hesitate to book this hotel and will definitely stay again when i plan to come back!",4,2014,05,10
240,Probably the best Hilton in Ireland,"This is the 2nd time we spent a night in the Kilmainham Hilton. The hotel is very new and well organized. The large bathroom includes a bathtube with separate shower. The rooms are tidy and noiseless, even a possibility to open the windows, this is luxury, as we prefer the open window to climatisation. PC and printer are available in the reception area, so you can print out your boarding card. The hotel guarantees a reduced taxi fare to the airport, if you order the taxi at the reception desk. The hotel is located in a park like area, a cosy Italian/Irish restaurant and pub is just on the opposite side of the street, so you do not have to eat at the hotel. A large continental and English breakfast is offered in the morning, however it is not included in the room charge.If you walk to the city center it takes you about an hour.",5,2014,05,09
240,Hilton Kilmainham,"The Hilton in Kilmainham is a great hotel with comfortable rooms, a very nice swimming pool and sauna(which you definetly should take advantage of). We had breakfast, lunch and dinner in the restaurant and the experience was delightful, not to mention the food is amazing. All these for a great price.",4,2014,05,09
240,Excellent hotel,"Exactly what you would expect from a Hilton hotel. nothing more, nothing less.  Room clean, water pressure very good, bed firm. TV has all the channels. breakfast variety good.    didnt use the other facilities in the hotel.",5,2014,05,09
240,very happy,great hotel in a great location. all the staff were excellent in every way. breakfast was fairly good but as I am very particular with cooked breakfast's it would be down to my own taste's and standards which are very high. evening meal was first class.  i booked through the today fm deal for two nights and have to say this was excellent value and i will use this again and stay at the hilton in the future. really happy through out our stay and will happily stay there any time i am in Dublin in the future.,5,2014,05,07
240,Great Hotel with excellent staff,"We stayed here for two nights. Everthing was excellent. I cant think of anything negative. Staff were friendly and helpful and food was good. Location although not city centre, is served by a good bus service  Taxi will cost about 10 euro to city centre.",4,2014,05,04
240,Lovely Hotel in great location.,I really enjoyed my stay at the Hilton Kilmainham. My only complaint was being asked to pay extra for breakfast when I felt it should have been included in the price. Everything else was fine. The staff were very nice and helpful.,4,2014,05,03
240,Best sleep for some time!!!,"Attended a football match in Dublin and stayed 1 night in Hilton.  Check-in was fine. Staff very pleasant, helpful and courteous.  A great package included a two course dinner in restaurant.  The food was very tasty, and we were happy about that.  One small issue - my husband ordered a second glass of wine - wait staff arrived and topped up his remaining wine with water!!!!! (Didn't understand that one!!!).  She apologised and arrived with glass of wine which she stated was a larger glass.  It was a larger glass but small measure of wine!  The family room was lovely.  Great bathroom and shower. Plenty of lovely toiletries.  The beds really comfy.  Best sleep I had for ages.  The breakfast was pretty poor.  We arrived at 10-45 (breakfast supposed to finish at 11).  The food remaining was cold and sparse.  Couple in front of me at desk were told that they had 'cut it fine'!!!  If breakfast finishes at 11, I felt 10.45 was ok.  if they cannot serve hot food until 11 then change breakfast time to 10 or 10-30.  Get rid of the tinned fruit and serve fresh in a 4 star hotel.  My daughter, who has a really poor appetite asked for hot chocolate.  It was made with water and was pathetic.  Good Hot chocolate is made with MILK!!!  (Didnt get a chance to visit pool)",3,2014,04,28
240,Great hotel in Dublin,"Hotel Hilton Kilmainham is great! Friendly staff, great rooms and a marvelous breakfast. We stayed here during four days and had a great time. The swimming pool with hydromassage is a great surplus, after a long day of walking in Dublin.
Transport is no problem at all. There is a bus stop at Emmet road (5 minutes walking from the hotel) and a stop for the hop-on hop-off bus in front of the hotel. By the way, with a freedom ticket (3 days) you can take all the buses you need. From the airport you can take the Airlink bus to Houston station. Its a 15-20 minutes walk to the hotel from there. There are also many taxis who can bring you to the hotel. We would recommend a single ticket with teh Airlink because the freedom ticket provides also a retour with the airlink to the airport. . There are also many taxis who can bring you there.
When we checked out, a very kind taxidriver offered to bring us to the station. We let go our first plan to go by foot and did not regret it at all. It was a short ride and a great experience. A very warm, kind and heartly man! If you have the opportunity to catch this taxi (taxi had a sign of Hilton hotel in front of the car) to the station or airport: do not doubt! You will immediately experience the hospitality and warmth of the Irish people! As he said himself, there's a saying in Ireland: ""We do not know strangers. Only friends we didn't met yet!""",4,2014,04,28
240,Typical overpriced hotel!!,"Stayed here for one night, this hotel was e130 for the one ngt stay with breakfast included & I'm pretty sure this was a deal my husband got! Not much atmosphere I'm guessing its mainly used for business stop offs!

Room was basic but when we checked in they gave us a free upgrade which was good, after only being in the room for an hour the door knocked & a heavily pregnant house keeping lady barged past me into my room to leave an envelope on the table she didn't say why she was there who she was and didn't wait to be invited in she was coming in regardless! This was quite rude!!

Food is typically overpriced e16 for a burger, come on!!

We ventured outside to the right to a cafe called lime green cafe very nice food here we both got a sandwich & salad with coffee for e12 for both!!

The hotel has a nice small pool area with jacuzzi the guys at reception at the gym were very nice.

You can get the 13/40 bus into the city centre the bus stop is 2mins walk from hotel!

Breakfast was so average the fruit salad was half fresh half from a tin, I just don't get why a 4* hotel should serve tinned fruit. Not a great selection!

Overall it's a typical over priced irish hotel!! ",3,2014,04,27
240,Great Location,"Really enjoyed my stay on a business trip. Would come here again. Walking distance to lots of places to visit. Breakfast was excellent, it was buffet style but had really fresh, good food. I had Wi-Fi, and we took a double decker ride from across the street which was a lot of fun.",4,2014,04,24
240,Nice hotel with a few major flaws on our visit,"Stayed here for two nights over Easter.

Check in was good, staff extremely friendly and helpful.

Free wifi in the hotel a bonus. 

On our first night my partner and I got no sleep due to the temperature in the room, it was extremely hot. The following morning we realised the air conditioning unit was broken. We spoke to the very helpful mikhail at reception who promised to have the maintenance department sent up whilst we were out! When we returned we were informed maintenance had fixed the problem. However, all they had done was move the temperature dial, this was not good enough as the air con unit itself was broken! We informed mikhail that the problem had not been fixed, he informed us as to the lack of communication he had had with the maintenance team and advised we move rooms. This was helpful however an upgrade might have been nice the inconvenience and incompetence of the maintenance team.

Another issue was with the room service at breakfast, in the end we paid for room service which was 20 minutes outside the timeframe we requested and which was missing items we had asked for.

We ate lunch upon leaving the hotel and this was, we felt, reasonably priced and very very nice.

Would we return? Maybe, but not before looking elsewhere first ",3,2014,04,23
240,Wonderful stay,We arrived on Saurday afternoon at The Hilton Hotel Kilmainham . We had booked with Secret Escapes .We had an upgrade to a better room with a lovely view. The staff were extremely helpful and pleasant. The breakfasts were delicious . We had two evening meals in the hotel which were excellent .We would defiantly come here again . The hotel is not in the centre so you do need a taxi into the centre of Dublin . The hop on hop off buses stop outside the hotel so that is very useful.  The jail is opposite ( well worth seeing ) and the Art gallery opposite has lovely gardens to walk in . Great live music to listen to at the Temple Bar area.,5,2014,04,23
240,Amazing bed - matrices,"Sleep 4-5 hours and you wake up a new man... very clean rooms, well decorated - give a very comfy feeling. Staff needs to work a bit on communication skills. Breakfast is very good but it can be a bit better to match with the rest of the hotel",4,2014,04,23
240,Superb family friendly hotel.,"Stayed here Easter Monday for one night. Check in was smooth and the receptionist was friendly, giving my son a lolly. Very knowledgeable about the local area. I was here for a family stay with my wife and son for my wife's 30th. On arrival to our room we found a little selection of cakes and a card wishing my wife a happy birthday. Thought this was a nice touch. 
We done the guinness tour and returned to use the pool. The pool was lovely and child friendly with excellent staff. We then had a light meal in the bar. Steak sandwich was perfectly cooked as asked and soup with mash available for my son. Wife had the burger which too was tasty. 
Breakfast the next morning was plentiful and had such a range, buffet style, from fruit to my favourite, the full irish.
Checkout wad fast and friendly, a big thanks to the receptionist who gave my son an Easter egg as we left. 
The small touches mean an awful lot to a family with young kids and I would recommend this hotel and would definitely stay again.",5,2014,04,22
240,Ana front desk receptionist was great!,"We stopped in at the front desk to exchange some money and asked for a couple of recommendations of places to visit and Ana literally helped plan our entire trip.  Her ""must-go"" places were spot-on and she even helped get us seats at a sold-out show.  If you have any questions about directions or things to do, definitely ask for Ana!",5,2014,04,20
240,Very Good Hotel,"Recently stayed in this hotel in March. Myself and my girlfriends first visit to Dublin and we loved every minute of it. We had tickets to see Beyonce at the 02 Dublin. The hotel itself is excellent. I could not fault it at all. Check in was quick, informative and simple. Free Wi-Fi is always a bonus. Agax, who was on reception at the time we checked in, was absolutely amazing. Friendly, always smiling, nothing never a problem and very helpful. Forget my swimming trunks, so I did not get a chance to use the gym or swimming pool, as a guest here you get full access to the health club on lower ground floor.

We had room service and also eat in the bar area. Both were very good, but a bit pricey. The hotel itself is about 15 minutes away from the heart of the city and all the bars etc. Taxi‚Äôs always available outside the hotel. The hotel is next to the prison, which I recommended is a visit. We did not get a chance to go to the Guinness store house or the prison, but we did the tour around Dublin on the bus.  Reason for not being able to do it because we decided to hit the bars early. Lol. So many bars and restaurants your are literally spoilt for choice.

The 02 Dublin is a top arena. Rated among the best I have been to. We had seats on Block E, Row 32 Seats 134 and 135. Top seats with a great view of the whole stage.

Overall Hilton Dublin Kilmainham a well recommended stay and I will back using this hotel when I get back to Dublin.",4,2014,04,19
240,"EXCELLENT HOTEL even if it is a little far from the ""action.""","The upside to the distance is that it is directly across from Kilmainham Gaol (pronounced ""jail""), which has a stop for the hop-on, hop-off bus; two-day passes for which could be bought easily online or at local retailers within walking distance. Cabs to/from the Temple Bar area were pretty reasonable (approx. 8-10 euro), as well as to Huston Station.

The staff was VERY helpful throughout our entire stay and accommodated every request we made. The property is also very close to a gas station/convenience store and pharmacy for any unexpected needs. 

If you don't care about being on the pulse, the hotel is walkable to Temple Bar and Henry St. (45-60 min).

I would definitely stay here again even if it is far away from ""stuff.""",5,2014,04,18
240,Excellent!,"Hotel is about 5/10 minutes from centre of Dublin, which meant I got an awesome rate! It is super easy to walk to city or get a cheap cab. The Hop On/Off bus also has a stop literally out the front of hotel, so it is very reasonable for the price. The room was BEAUTIFUL and felt very luxurious!",5,2014,04,17
240,Great a little far from all the activity.,"Our family stayed here for 4 nights.  We were booked into adjoining rooms. The rooms were great, comfortable, clean, and set up for parents in one room, kids in the other (a twin bed each).  The storage space was great as well.  We had room service one night, but it was hotel food, not the best, not the worst.  Breakfast buffet was included in our rate, go early, they stop adding more food 30 min before it closes.  Bring your swimsuit !!!  the pool was great to unwind and relax in after a long day touring around, bring your swim cap too they are required.  
Overall we have no complaints, other that it was a bit far, a taxi from dinner in the city centre would run ¬£10.",4,2014,04,17
240,Lovely hotel for weekend break,"Stayed here for three nights with my husband - we're able to check in early, for a modest fee, and had a great breakfast as we were so early. We had a really comfortable room over looking the main road. We slept well and didn't notice any traffic noise. The staff were friendly and helpful,  the breakfast was extensive and the room housekeeping was excellent. The hotel is opposite Killmainham Goal and a hop on/off bus stop. We bought the 3 day freedom ticket and it was good value for us. We loved Dublin and would certainly stay at this hotel again",5,2014,04,15
240,"Nice hotel, rude/indifferent staff","Desk staff pleasant, but told us breakfast was included when it was not.  Room still being cleaned when we returned from a very long walk around Dublin at 5 pm.  Waitstaff rude.  Would not stay here again or recommend it.",2,2014,04,15
240,"Good hotel, great location !","We stayed in the Hilton Dublin Kilmainham hotel during our 4 day ciytrip in Dublin in the beginning of April 2014.

The location of the hotel is very good. It's located a little bit outside of the citycentre, but therefore it's very quiet outside and there's not alot of noise during the night. Right across the street is a stop of the ""Hop-on-hop-off"" bus, which is a great way to get around in Dublin. The Kilmainham jail is also right across the street, and just a street away of the hotel is a direct citybus to the citycentre. The trainstation is also just a 10 minute walk away.

The staff was very friendly and helpfull and really gave us some good tips for sightseeing in Dublin. 

The room was spacious and very clean. It had a massive LCD TV, and free WifI with a good connection. The bed was great and not too soft. The bathroom offerend a nice shower and everything was really clean.

We didn't use breakfast because the ‚Ç¨12 per person was a bit too much in our opinion. There was a nice little breakfast bar around the corner which was half the price of the hotel breakfast.

The pool was really nice for relaxing. The jacuzzi was really hot, and the jets in the pool were really nice and relaxing after a long day of sightseeing in Dublin.

Overall we would definitely recommend this hotel because of the rooms, pool and great relaxing location!",4,2014,04,15
240,Could be better than average - not this time though,"Costs the same by cab (about 20 Euros) to get here as it did to reach the Hilton that pitches itself as the airport hotel.  Area is better and hotel nicer.  Saying that, I was greeted by two hooded, 'yoofs', sprawled across the chairs outside the front door, swearing and smoking as their bikes lay on the ground by their feet, charming......  

Check in was swift.  Room was a decent size, a bit noisy.  Clean and tidy.

Convenient location for meeting colleagues early the next day - traffic light at 7am.

I would stay there again, but would like to get a rate of 80 to 110 euros max.",3,2014,04,15
240,Excellent service from Hilton,I stayed in hotel for 3 nights.  Apr 9th to 12th i was staying in hotel. The stay was really good. It was a good hospitality from all the people in hotel. Delicious dinner and breakfast.   overall Excellent service.,5,2014,04,14
240,Hilton Kilmainham stay,I booked a valentine weekend here for my anniversairy. we arrived and the staff were so helpful but stightly understaffed. The room was fab as I paid extra for a superior room for a treat. we booked a meal and were going to head to temple bar. the restaurant was packed and very understaffed for the amount of people eating. The meal was just alright but the people beside us sent theirs back. My husband ordered salmon but half way through said it was a slimy texture and left it. we didnt get our paid for desert as the restaurant was so busy and we had waited so long on our first course. We went out to the front bar and ordered a drink but my husband had to leave and go to the room. He was very ill and we could not go anywhere that night. when I complained I got an offer of a free meal! no thanks! I really wanted the night we missed back. I feel that the Hilton didnt take responsability and wanted a doctors report on a sunday! They left me feeling unhappy and I wont book with them again.,2,2014,04,14
240,Relaxing,Another relaxing stay at the Kilmainham Hilton hotel in Dublin. Staff are always friendly and welcoming. This was my 6th stay at the hotel and as always a pleasure. This hotel is well situated for both Pheonix Park (Dublin Zoo) and the City centre via the city tram system which is only a 10 min walk away. Coupled with this the historical Kilmainham Gaol directly opposite the hotel.   I will be returning next year.,5,2014,04,09
240,Superior Hotel,Stayed at this Hotel whilst on a short break to Dublin and from the moment we arrived the staff were extremely helpful. Seeing that we had been traveling from early that day they arranged for our room to be available almost on arrival and we were so grateful  I would highly recommend the Dublin Tour Bus Tickets as this Hotel is on the main route which means you can travel easily into the center of Dublin.  We ate in the hotel on the first night and although the restaurant was quiet the service was excellent and the food plentiful.  Breakfast each morning was without fault and we wanted for nothing.  Thank you again.,5,2014,04,07
240,Great Location and Staff,Had great one night stay including breakfast and dinner only issue during our stay was the limited dinner menu but we had booked a special offer package. Other diners were given a menu with a more extensive choice. However would recommend the hotel for a Dublin stay hop on hop off bus stops outside the door of the hotel.,4,2014,04,06
240,GREAT PLACE TO STAY !,"Just returned from a great long weekend in Dublin. We stayed at the Hilton in Kilmainham and it was excellent in all respects. The cleanliness throughout, the quality of the food, both breakfast and dinner and especially the staff.  From the moment you arrive, until the moment you leave, everyone is so friendly and obliging. From those on reception, through to all those working in the restaurant and kitchen and the cleaning staff, there is a great sense of quiet competence and professionalism and all done with a smile.  We arrived on an early flight so went to the Hilton for breakfast and when we had finished our room was ready which was great. The choice available at breakfast has to be one of the best I've seen in any hotel and the quality of our evening meals was superb. We were celebrating an anniversary and special thanks must go to Paige and her colleagues on reception for the lovely little surprise that awaited us on return from our day out. Location is good too, stop 15 on the Hop on Hop off bus is just outside (recommend using the Green Bus Tour) and you can get anywhere easily with the two day ticket, or you have other buses and tram close by. All in all a great place to stay and thanks to all. Highly recommended!",5,2014,04,01
240,Great value for the money,"This hotel is comfortable, quiet, and clean. It's cheaper than the hotels in the city center, but you will need a cab, bus pass, or car to get to destinations in the city. The bus stop is right across the street, so that's super convenient. Parking is 12 euro a day, if you do rent a car. The restaurant downstairs overcharges for breakfast, but most hotels do.  There are not many dinner choices, but the prices are good, and the food is tasty. If you get a room with two beds, be advised that this hotel, like most of the others in Europe will give you two twin beds, not to regular sized beds, but the beds are extremely comfortable. Overall, I enjoyed my stay at the Hilton Kilmainham and will stail here again.",4,2014,04,01
240,Excellent hotel and staff,Beautiful hotel. Excellent facilities. Bedroom clean and comfortable. What really makes this hotel stand out is the staff. Everyone was extremely friendly and helpful in a way not experienced before in any other hotel. well done! Highly recommended,5,2014,03,31
240,Perfect location,"We stayed on after a Globus tour. We loved the area and the staff was very helpful. They gave us suggestions of places to see. After suggesting going to Belfast, helped and booked a room at the Hilton in Belfast. We felt very at home here.",5,2014,03,31
240,Very Good,"Great hotel for 4 night stay. James at the desk was very helpful! We arrived at 9 am and were in our room before 12n! We were brought tea and coffee while we waited in the lobby! Room was clean and quiet. Things they don't tell you......you must swipe your key card to use the elevator and must leave a key card in a slot just inside your room door to work the lights. There are no ice machines. You must get ice from the bar. We had drinks in the bar a couple times. Service was ok. We had dinner in the restaurant one evening. My husband's food was messed up not once, but twice! I finished my meal before he ever got to eat. The manager did come apologize, but never offered anything complimentary or to take his dinner off of the bill, thus would not recommend the restaurant for dinner. We did get breakfast with our room. It was hot, hearty, and lots to choose from!! Bus stops are just across the street. Not a place to stay if you want to walk to town centre tho. Overall good stay for Paddy's Day!!",4,2014,03,30
240,Mothers day break,Lovely modern hotel. Friendly and attentive staff. Room on junction corner but no traffic noise. Comfortable bed. Nice flatscreen tv but limited channel choice. Water in bathroom took a long time to become warm in shower and sink. Bar food beautiful and reasonably priced. Overall positive. Would return and would recommend.,4,2014,03,30
240,Quite happy,"We have paid the extra money to get the room with view, after we realised that there is some net in the front of our room we have asked for another which actualy allowed us to look at the sky.
In general very tidy room and comfortable sleep.",4,2014,03,29
240,Dublin Kilmainham,"Great hotel, located right next to Modern Art Museum and Phoenix Park, great facilities, children will love the pool and all you can eat breakfast buffet. It's a newer property, and very well designed and laid out. Convenient parking underneath the building and an excellent full service gym (Living Well brand).",5,2014,03,27
240,Very Good might stay there again.,"We arrived early in the morning and expected that will not be allowed to the room before 12 pm. To our surprise the receptionists said that our room is waiting and we can go in. That was very kind and caring from the staff. We were able to have nap before went to the city. Room was very clean and quiet. Hotel located outside of the city centre, but public transport and Hop on - Hop off stops just opposite hotel, but we walked to the centre all the time - weather permitted. Breakfast at the restaurant was very good and staff was attentive and helpful. Menu at the restaurant in the evening time did not leave the choice but to look elsewhere for meal, could be better and more extensive. Anyway will stay again. In the spa we were asked to purchase the swimming hat ?which was complete waste of money, changing room and shower in the spa could be looked at better.",4,2014,03,25
240,Fab Weekend,"Hotel staff were extremely friendly and helpful, Spa facilities were very good. The hotel was maintained to a high standard. Only down side being that it was further from the city centre than we realised so weren't able to get any where by foot easily although there were good transport links.",4,2014,03,25
240,Absolutely brilliant hotel,"Had a wonderful time staying here. Arrived at check in to be told we were being upgraded to one of their junior suites as they were fully booked. The room was fabulous with panoramic views all the way to the Dublin Mountains. Huge king size bed, with robes and slippers ready for us. Bathroom was like another room it was so big with a huge walk in shower. Dinner was delicious and staff were super efficient and friendly. Bar is so comfy and cosy. Really enjoyed our stay here and will most definitely be back. Just one small gripe, nowhere did we see signs that we had to pay for overnight parking which was 12 euro. Not on the booking site not in the car park where all it said was validate your ticket at reception. So upon checking out was surprised to be billed for the parking. Just think you should be told either when booking or at least when you are checking in. Other than that ten out of ten one of the best hotels we have stayed in .",5,2014,03,23
240,"Lovely spa, ace hotel - location not brilliant for Dublin centre","LOCATION

It's a bit out in the sticks... It's by Kilmainham Goal (which is worth a visit) but that's about a 45 minute walk to the centre of Dublin, or a short walk to a tram (1.70 a journey). So not great as a tourist hotel location wise, unless you're after the Goal or the Museum of Modern Art which is also close by.

ROOM

Spacious, well equipped, huge bed - slept like a baby! Huge bathroom with bath and shower, great toiletries (including separate conditioner - always helpful). Good wifi connection in the room as well as elsewhere in the hotel - and it's complimentary. 

BREAKFAST

Great spread - all hot items, including white and black pudding, continental, yoghurt, fruit etc. Bread selection could be better - there's only toasting bread and two loaf options - soda bread and white, the latter of which seemed a little stale. 

Breakfast's until 11 on a weekend - as a tourist would have preferred it later weekdays too, but it did seem like more a business hotel so perhaps this is a limited requirement. 

SPA

Great pool/sauna/steam room/jacuzzi. Pool definitely a leisure pool - lots of jets, but you can't really swim in it. Beautiful to look at. 

Gym well equipped, and both generally quiet. 

OTHER

Decent enough bar, open reasonably late. Staff all helpful and friendly.",4,2014,03,18
240,A cracking (craic) good couple of days!,"From the day I booked this Hotel, primarily for its Kilmainham location, I'm glad that I did!
Excellent cooperation from the Events Manager, a great reception from the Front Desk Team, a good sized clean and well prepared room, superbly comfortable bed with excellent quilt and linen.
A good menu, varied choice, well presented, and not too long a wait between courses.
At the end of stay whilst taking one last look at the City map, even the Doorman approached us to see if he could offer any advice.
Just across the road from Kilmainham Gaol (!), a 10 minute walk away from a Tram stop with regular rides into town, one of the oldest pubs in Dublin just around the corner, and a great pint of the 'Black Stuff' to boot!
Enjoy.......",5,2014,03,16
240,Loved our stay here,"Just got home from staying here for 6 days and still talking about what a wonderful time we had.  From the moment we checked in, Ana took wonderful care of us-our room was ready early which was very unexpected but much appreciated after a long day/night of travel!  She was also very informative and friendly in showing us places on the map and giving us suggestions.  The room was well laid out and the queen bed plus twin for our daughter was perfect-not to mention a great view of the Gaol right across the street!  James and Michael at the front desk were also helpful with directions and suggestions for dinner, etc. and Brian, the taxi driver was great as well.  After walking around the city we enjoyed the pool and hot tub and we also looked forward to the delicious breakfast each morning.  We are glad to be home in Texas but already missing this Hilton's hospitality!",5,2014,03,16
240,In the hospitallity or hostility business?,"It may be a favourite for hen parties and it may have good location but if you¬¥re in Dublin on business, and belong to this group that I thought was Hilton's bill payer, this hotel may not be the best selection.
The ""desk chair"" is not suitable for any lengthy work period and a huge TV has been placed on the desk sideboard, effectively blocking the surface for any practical use. The desk lighting is insufficient! Why sacrifice ample lighting for worthless low energy lighting that produces barely more lighting  than a wax candle? This is supposed to be a workspace!
At check in we opted for an upgrade in an attempt to get a good sleep. The upgrade landed us in an albeit larger room, but it was opposite the elevator, and a room facing the busy main road! This became apparent when it was time for rest (too late to go through the ordeal of swapping rooms). Police sirens, trucks and heavy traffic passed in a continuous stream making for a difficult sleep, which may not have troubled a guest that had spent the evening at the bar. In the middle of the night the late night St Patrick's Day celebrators arrived home, inconsiderately and loudly continuing their conversations outside the elevator before dispersing to their various lodgings.
We chose for practical reasons to have our dinner in the hotel but this was disappointing. Not that there was anything wrong with the Guinness, but the waitress argued that the helpings served were ""tiny"" encouraging us to order an extra course. When the food was served is was obvious the size was not as minimalistic. Instead, quite the opposite. Upon pointing this out, we were met by rude remarks that the size of the portions was the waitresses own observation and what she thought, with no relation to a unbiased opinion. This may also have been a  misunderstand based on insufficient language, but we fail to see the reason to prove the guest wrong for asking!
Sorry Hilton Kilmainham, but yor effort to keep a business traveller happy failed.
Breakfast was mostly ok and busy, but the scrambled eggs were cold.",3,2014,03,16
240,Young couple in 20's- both adored our stay!,"Stayed here with my boyfriend in March. We both absolutely adored it. Staff were so nice and very helpful. The meal we had was out of this world. Main course took a while to come out, we didn't mind though. We got a free desert without mentioning one word about it. We unfortunately didn't get to use the pool , which we had full access to if desired. No more than ‚Ç¨12 in a taxi to town, 79 bus leaves you right outside if you're not driving, which leaves from city centre. The room was gorgeous which conveniently had a mini fridge and cooler with wine glasses. Bed was really comfortable, toilets very clean. We were late checking out, and not one word was mentioned about it, we were just advised that we could leave our bags in hotel free of charge while we visited Kilmainham jail. 10/10. Couldn't fault it at all. Perfect for anyone and everyone. Cant wait to go back!!",5,2014,03,13
240,excellent reception staff,"these ladies were very well informed helpful and pleasant.  While we didnt need much info having researched in advance they were able to confirm what we knew and it was clear they knew about what was available locally, opening times etc",5,2014,03,13
240,"Enjoyable, but not ""Wowed"". ","We stayed for a weekend. Check in and out was fab, girl was really friendly and did all she could for us. Nicely decorated room with a superking size bed. View of the Phoenix park in the distance. 
Small lobby with the bar just off it. The bar was very quiet for a Friday night. 
Went for a wake up swim. Not really a swimming pool. They have a hydrotherapy pool, a jacuzzi and a place to stretch your arms in the water. Swimming would be pushing it. Sauna and steam room all working fine. Didn't use the gym. 
Car park ‚Ç¨12 a night. Taxis was ‚Ç¨10 in to town for the two of us. Bus stop around the corner though and Luas 500 metres down the road. 
Location is pretty decent to be honest. Far enough away from the hustle of town and yet only five minutes away in a taxi. Nice coffee shops and Spar beside the hotel too. 
All in all it's a decent hotel. To me, the bed was its best feature and to be honest that is never a bad thing.

240,Wonderful stay in Hilton Kilmainham,"We had an overnight stay with bed and breakfast. Staff were very friendly and helpful throughout stay. We dined in the Cinnamon, very tasty food with good varied menu. Breakfast was delish. Beautiful hotel, very clean and modern.",5,2014,03,12
240,Wonderful stay at the Hilton Kilmainham,"We stayed overnight with bed and breakfast, staff were very friendly and helpful from the moment we arrived until we were leaving. Room was very nice with lovely big window over looking Kilmainham Gaol. We dined in the Cinnamon restaurant that evening, the food was delicious and a good range of wines and beers available. Staff were very helpful giving recommendations on places to spend our Saturday evening. We had breakfast in bed (just love treats) the breakfast was by far one of the tastiest hotel breakfasts I have had. I would definitely recommend this hotel and very much looking forward to my next stay.",5,2014,03,12
240,Great value and a warm welcome,"we had a great experience in this warm, friendly and comfortable hotel.  We would recommend this hotel if you are looking for a hotel away from the hustle and bustle of the inner city.  Staff were friendly, courteous and  helpful",5,2014,03,11
240,Hilton Hotel Kilmainham Dublin,Had a great time.  Couldn't find fault with anything. Would definitely recommend this hotel.  Stayed for 2 nights bed and breakfast and one evening meal. Food was amazing. Rooms were amazing.  Went to Kilmainham jail and would definitely recommend visiting if you are in Dublin.  Very reasonable too.,5,2014,03,11
240,Good place to stay.,Stayed here for a Saturday night  - very handy to get to using the M50 and N4. Parking under the hotel so I was content that the car was safe. Only ate breakfast which was fine and had a couple of drinks in the bar. Everyone was very helpful and friendly. Would definitely use it again.,5,2014,03,10
240,Great Lunch,"I have close friends that live near the Hilton as we always meet for lunch the odd Saturday was there two weeks ago . Have to say the food is great and value for money for sure . 
The service was great to say a great thanks to Savas was so helpful . It's not the first time we were their for lunch ! ",5,2014,03,10
240,Expensive.....,"Stayed here on Dec 18 last ,booked month in advance and had full amount deducted from cc. Back then which I thought cheeky....some colleagues also stayed and  booked few days in advance  ....for less than my one month in advance prepaid booking .?? Did not get much satisfaction from reception manager...that's what you booked ..tough  ...and after all that it didn't  even include breakfast .
So overall I thought it quite expensive hotel for where it is and what it provides ...
No plans to return soon ..",3,2014,03,09
240,satisfactory but expensive for what it is,"The room was fine, clean,quiet, only negative was that the shower (over the bath) smelt a bit musty, bed very comfortable, more or less up to what you would expect from an international chain. Hotel was busy, bar especially busy but no atmosphere, restaurant was expensive for what was on offer, two steak & chips with mushrooms & a bottle of near house wine was ¬£68 (ouch!) The whole experience was redeemed by the charming restaurant manager who was a true professional amongst a generally ordinary & non engaging staff. The general feeling was more one of being processed than welcomed, this hotel doesn't give you any sense of being in Dublin, you could be anywhere really",3,2014,03,04
240,Great Experience,"Stayed here Fri and sat night for B n B, we met very helpful staff everywhere we went in the Hotel.
Breakfast was brilliant, could keep going all day on it. Had food in the bar which was excellent. Very centrally located close to Luas and buses.Will be back soon.",5,2014,03,03
240,"Hotel Excellent, Bar/Restaurant, not so much","The hotel was excellent, clean, and modern. The check-in staff was very helpful and efficient. However, when I dined downstairs, I was told that the restaurant was full and I couldn't be accommodated, and then when dining in the bar area, the service was extremely slow and inattentive. I would NOT recommend dining at the hotel, but would recommend the rooms.",4,2014,03,01
240,A little bit of luxury,"I stayed here last weekend and it was fabulous - great location for the city and Phoenix Park.  The car parking is very good value.  The room was lovely, the bed was big and really comfortable.  The pool on Sunday morning was just wonderful, well worth getting out of bed early for.  The breakfast selection was great (shame we had to queue for approx 10 mins before being seated).  My only problem with the stay was the dinner but as it was included in the package maybe my expectations were a bit high.  Would definitely stay here again.",4,2014,02,27
240,"As always, excellent stay at Hilton","I am always rather nervous returning to a hotel as inevitable there will be something about the return visit that will not be up to the high standard of the first visit, thankfully not the case in the Hilton.",5,2014,02,26
240,Excellent place to stay,"Spent 2 nights  here, friendly staff fantastic value. Has a pool and Gym. I will be staying there again. central to the city and close to a few sights around Dublin. If you are thinking of a stay in Dublin I would recommend the Hilton Kilmainham.",5,2014,02,23
240,Awful service,"I purchased a meal deal before Christmas as we had some friends in town and wanted to treat them to a nice meal.
I had eaten in the hilton on business a few months back and enjoyed it.
We were shown to our table by a lovely girl who gave us our menus. I literally had just opened mine when the waiter approached to take our order. I asked for 5 mins extra..... He literally rolled his eyes and walked off. 
The girl that we first met took our order and served us out drinks. Again she was very professional.
Starters came and were served by mr eye roller..... He pretty much threw my soup in front of me. We asked for more bread and he never even acknowledged us. Bread never came.
The lady waitress looked after us for the rest of the night and in fairness it was a nice meal...... But far from a pleasant dining experience.
I did mention to the girl that her colleague needed to learn how to treat diners...... She said he was new and this was his first hotel. 
I will not be hurrying back.....

240,Very nice hotel,Every time we are in Dublin we stay in Hilton Kilmainham hotel.beautiful hotel with lovely pool.Fantastic food and excellent service.People working there are very nice and helpfull.Will defenetly be back here soon.,5,2014,02,22
240,Hilton Kilmainham business stay,"Very pleased with a recent stay for a business trip to visit St. James Hospital. Hotel was in a nice quiet, but convenient location if you dont want to be in the middle of downtown Dublin. A short cab ride to most of Dublin, and right across the street from the Kilmainham jail (if your not familiar this is a tour site- not an ""active"" jail!), the art museum and a great little local pub. Room was excellent- very clean and comfortable. Felt very safe as a female business traveller staying alone and always a taxi right outside- so no waiting for a ride.",4,2014,02,18
240,Hope your not thirsty!,"Stayed in the Hilton in Kilmainham last weekend. The location and price were very appealing. Rooms lovely and clean with hairdryer, Iron etc  It was when we went to the bar that evening that we changed our mind about the hotel. The drink was pricey but seen as it was near enough impossible to get served that was'nt the problem. One barman on, on a busy saturday night is not good enough. We had intended staying in the hotel bar for the night but because we could'nt get served we had to make our way to the Patriot pub across the way, which was lovely and service was great. The following morning we had to queue for ages to be seated for breakfast and nice enough as the staff were we got no explanation or apology, by the time we were seated there was no juice left and most breakfast containers were empty, spoilt what was otherwise a nice stay! Would not stay there again if the breakfast issue was'nt sorted out!",3,2014,02,17
240,Nice Hotel,"This is a nice hotel just about 15 mins outside the city, this is about my 5th stay at this hotel its very nice and the rooms are nice and big and have to give them a 10+++ there so clean staff are nice hope to see you all soon again.",5,2014,02,15
240,Annual meeting,"There for a two night stay last week - annual meeting with same group. Bedrooms are a good size with all amenities. There are very good larger meeting rooms and smaller breakout rooms. Breakfast however is below average, while the choice is good the quality isn't, especially that of the hot food and restaurant service isn't always with a smile. The food quality hasn't improved over the past few years. A sting in the tail is the ‚Ç¨12 PER DAY car parking charge.  It's about a 10 minute walk in one direction to Heuston mainline train station but about 5 mins walk in a different direction to the Luas.  The Royal Hospital grounds are just opposite the front door, as is Kilmainham Jail.  I didn't get to use the leisure centre this year.",4,2014,02,12
240,"Perfect location, superb staff.","I stayed here for 6 weeks on business, so this review is based on the fact I didn't do the ""touristy thing"" of sight seeing in Dublin, however saying that, the location is good if you wish to explore the fair city, with buses and taxis on hand, or if you wish, a lovely morning stroll along the Liffey into the City centre. It's handy for the Guinness brewery, Kilmainham Geol, Pheonix Park and Connolly Train Station. 

All I can say is what a perfect stay I had here. The staff were very accommodating to any requests I made, and a particular note has to be made regarding Lucie who worked in the restaurant/Cafe area - she always had a smile on her face and always very pleasant. The food in the restaurant was excellent - always fresh, hot and delicious.

One thing I would say - at breakfast the staff could do with a little help at peak times, sometimes service to be seated etc was a little slow, but through no fault of the very dedicated hard working breakfast staff.

The front desk were also very helpful and welcoming. Also very accommodating to any room requests etc.

The rooms were fantastic with a flat screen tv showing terrestrial channels, mini fridge, digital safe and air con. The beds were very comfortable with lovely bed linen and super soft pillows and duvet. The bathroom too was very nice with complementary toiletries.

I'd definitely come back here if I was to visit Dublin either on business or in my own time.

I'd highly recommend this hotel to anyone on a business or personal visit to Dublin.",5,2014,02,10
240,Quite lovely,"Stayed here Sat night. The Welsh rugby team stayed here too, which was a bit of fun.,this is our second time staying here. We got a great price but had to pay ‚Ç¨12 to park the car but can't really quibble as the rate was so good. We used the gym and the pool and jacuzzi both of which were perfect. The dinner was really tasty, nicest Veggie stir fry I have had in a while. No veggie choice for starters though. Kilmainham gaol and IMMA art museum are both adjacent as is the zoo very near so a good location for weekend cultural activities, all hotel staff are great combination of attentive but not intrusive. Thank you Hilton Hotel. ",5,2014,02,09
240,Business night at  Hilton Dublin Kilmainham,Clean and luxury hotel. Quite close to Dublin to take a ride (20min from downtown). Really comfortable double-bed. Courtesy and attention to needs. Nice and silent room. Hi-speed internet and wi-fi full coverage.,4,2014,02,06
240,Great Value,"My wife and I stayed here for 2 nights, I would have nothing but praise for the staff who portrayed nothing but professionalism in their respective work areas. We had drinks in the bar and the only draw back was the inability of the staff to serve a proper pint of Guinness but also very expensive. The breakfast was lovely but coffee was poor and cold. Overall it was great value and quality and not only would we stay here again but would recommend it to anyone.",5,2014,02,06
240,Lovely hotel & food but bar staff require some serious training!! ,"Stayed here for a deserved night away with my wife on a Saturday night:-) the hotel was lovely and clean, room very spacious and modern. We ate in the restaurant as we had a meal included. The food was delicious and waiting staff were prompt and attentive. We had drinks before and after the meal and I have to say the bar staff were shocking! Ignoring customers to talk to colleagues or running round like headless chickens and it wasn't that busy!! No order to who they served next or no apparent management! We ended up going to the local across the road which was lovely and decent craic:-) Breakfast was lovely but coffee was poor! 
Overall great value and quality and I would go back hopefully to find a decent bar man/women:-) ",3,2014,02,05
240,Good quality,"2 nights with great sleep but the room was a bit cold. Was near my destination but is not near city center, you need 15 minutes LUAS travel to arrive to the center. The quality and quantity of the restaurant and bar food is good but a bit expensive the drinks.",4,2014,02,05
240,"Lovely hotel, dinner let whole experience down","We stayed at this hotel whilst in Dublin for 6 nations rugby.  The room was large , clean and comfy . The bed was extremely comfortable and the feather pillows my husband requested for me so soft . We never made it to the pool , full of good intentions instead we lay around in bed after breakfast until it was time to check out .  Staff were all lovely. 
The only blip was at dinner , our main course somehow got lost , we had waited an hour and 50 minutes by the time we received our main course . Once we had alerted the staff to our wait they were all very attentive especially one gentleman in particular ( unfortunately don't know his name) and the complimentary drinks and desserts made up for the wait.  Would definitely go back .......",4,2014,02,02
240,"Fantastic modern hotel, great service and very helpful staff","Have stayed in this hotel a lot over recent weeks and will stay there again. Great food, particularly the room service breakfast. Fastastic service, from the front desk to the kitchen. In to the city centre in 5 minutes for ‚Ç¨6.",5,2014,02,01
240,Excellent experience at Hilton Kilmainham Dublin,"I stayed at the Hilton Kilmainham recently for business. Had a really excellent experience. Room comfort and cleanliness of a very high standard. Great nights sleep with no disturbances. Used the gym, pool, sauna and steam room facilities which were great. And breakfast the following morning of a high standard. Overall a great hotel for a business trip and for what I paid including breakfast, it was really goo value.",5,2014,01,31
240,Overnight in the Capital,"Was delighted with this Hotel and will use again, our time was short and did not get a chance to use pool.  The breakfast at this hotel was the best I've ever had in a hotel and I will definitely recommend to friends and family.",5,2014,01,30
240,Good for Business travel,"This was my first time here and it was pretty good. The rooms are large (but slightly dark and hard to work in), and the bed was comfy. The bathroom was spacious but I had a bit of an issue with the water, it went from regular then painfully hot to cold and then back to regular during my shower without me touching it. Breakfast was pretty good, dining room is dark. The best thing about this place is the gym!",3,2014,01,30
240,A pleasure to stay here,"What a pleasure it was to stay here. I regularly stay in Dublin for work and this is by far the best hotel I‚Äôve stayed in and it will become my regular.

Larger than average rooms, range of seating and large desk space. All spotlessly clean and well maintained. Good quality bed linen and towels etc. Plenty of storage.

All staff were helpful and attentive, minor glitches were attended to quickly and efficiently with genuine apology. 

Free wifi throughout. A quiet hotel with no noise disturbances. Easy plentiful parking

I will definitely be returning, many thanks.",5,2014,01,29
240,Great!!,"Another great stay at this hotel for my wife and myself. When we arrived we were told we had been upgraded to a better room for free.  Gorgeous pool, room service was also delicious. We only had the one drink in the bar but it‚Äôs a nice place to sit around. Breakfast was also the best hotel breakfast I have ever had ‚Äì on both days.  I would recommend this hotel for anyone planning a trip to Dublin",5,2014,01,29
240,hilton kilmainham,"we had a great stay at the Hilton in kilmainham, the staff were helpful and friendly. it was great value for money, we had a meal in the restaurant on both evenings we were there, the food and service were excellent also the breakfast was fit for a king!",5,2014,01,28
240,excellent,"I loved our stay last night, I want the same bed it is so comfortable, we had one drink at the bar and retired to our lovely comfortable room with a bottle of wine, it would be nice if you had a movie choice, we would have gladly paid for this, breakfast was delicious, staff great, special mention to Ana at reception who looked after us checking in and out, and the gentleman on reception this morning who was also very nice.",5,2014,01,26
240,City Break,"The hotel is well situated, the city centre is only 10 minuutes away by bus or taxi, we had the most enjoyable stay, the staff were very friendly. The spa and leisure fitness facilities and pool were excellent.  The restaurant and bar staff were very polite and accommodating.",5,2014,01,25
240,"Good hotel, comfortable stay","One night stay in the Hilton after a concert in Vicar Street. 
Very welcoming staff at check in. The bedroom is a reasonable size with a large comfortable bed. Small but adequate bathroom. Everything clean and modern. Room overlooking the road, but quiet with minimal road noise. Comprehensive breakfast, but service a bit slow (although we were there at peak time). Overnight parking for ‚Ç¨12. 
This is not a city centre hotel, but easy access by taxi (‚Ç¨10 to temple bar). 
Got a B&B deal on hotels.com, so very good value",4,2014,01,25
240,Business hotel - close to city centre - average to good,"I have  stayed here a few times - good hotel but service can be variable.
This time service was slow but staff  did their best and were very apologetic.
Reception area could o with a change as it is very impersonal.
Bar area is good or meetings,snacks and lunch but can get very busy at lunchtime.
Room service can be sow and food is just ok.
Breakfast is much improved since the last time I was here.",3,2014,01,24
240,Perfect for this side of the city.,We chose this hotel because of a nearby work function. It was very pleasant and clean. We had very little dealings with the staff but I can vouch that they were very pleasant dealing with some irritating ungrateful and demanding late breakfast arrivals. Pity the bar hadn't Sky Sports or the means to show the current football games. We had to go elsewhere to watch a game. I suppose that was their loss more than mine. I'd happily book this hotel again if I need to be in this area.,4,2014,01,22
240,Great Hotel,Fantastic hotel to stay in. The staff are extremely helpful and friendly. Beds are so so comfy and the breakfast and dinner including service is second to none.  Definitely a must to stay.  We stayed on a Friday evening which I expected to be very busy but it was a pleasure to have such a peaceful stay as this break was to relax.,5,2014,01,21
240,Night in Dublin,"Very pleasant- great bed, great night sleep. Quiet- good location. Breakfast had everything you could wish for. Would stay here again!!! Very well looked after hotel. Parking underground. Good transport links with bus, luas and taxi services.",4,2014,01,21
240,Great Hote;,"I stayed in this hotel for one night and had dinner and breakfast the next morning. They were both lovely. The room was clean and tidy and the staff were very friendly.  The only downside is that although it was in a great location to visit the Gaol, it was a bit far away from everything else",5,2014,01,21
240,Great value city break offer,The Hilton's 99euro offer for B&B and evening meal is great value. The use of the leisure facilities is a great added bonus.....very relaxing space.  I stayed with my fianc√© last weekend and it was so relaxing and enjoyable I have booked to go again next weekend with my girl friends!,5,2014,01,21
240,Lovely Hotel - Breakfast a Let-Down,"Overall, this is a great property.  Only 5 mins from Luas which brings you into town in 10 mins.  It is modern and purpose built.  The staff are excellent, generally.  Very attentive, friendly and go over and above to help.  Two gents on reception for night porterage were absolutely lovely in particular !  Rooms are super - v well appointed, very well sound proofed, with great bathrooms, great facilities and a spectacularly comfortable bed (number one bed I have slept in for a couple of years!)  Let down for me was breakfast.  It is advertised (as it was a Sunday) until 11am.  We went down at 10.30 or so.  It is buffet style.  The quality in my opinion was not great (hot buffet) and the food was not piping hot.  There was no orange juice, there was no croissants (not replenished) our tea did not get delivered (had to chase) What I also didn't like was at 10 to 11 they came around to advise the buffet would be shutting (would you not just wait until everyone has eaten and close the buffet then ?).  I felt like the team were trying to rush us out of the restaurant.  Which was a pity, as this left a sour taste in my mouth (after an otherwise thoroughly enjoyable stay.",4,2014,01,20
240,Theatre break,"Nice relaxing stay with very comfortable beds ,good food and a great pool to help you relax(warm water in pool) quiet surrounding and handy for zoo or take a 10mins in taxi to town centre from taxi most and outside hotel",5,2014,01,19
240,Quite a good hotel,"Spent 2 nights here on a business trip during April 2013. I really liked most of the aspects of the hotel. The gym, the room, the bar, the staff, the reception, the restaurant, the location. Nothing really gave me any sense of disappointment.

I would definitely stay here again.",4,2014,01,18
240,Almost Great.,"Stayed for one night during a business trip. Was very impressed with room, it was on the top floor with a double height ceiling and loads of daylight and great views over the city to the Wicklow mountains. I could have watched life go on out the window all day! Very comfortable room, plenty of space. Also free wifi, which is a bonus. The one thing lacking was the TV - no movies and a limited number of channels.

Breakfast was very poor really. The breakfast room was dark and too warm. The cold meats and cheeses were out on display in what should be a chilled cabinet but it was warm. Some of the meats were hard and discoloured as a result, very unsafe. Tea and Coffee was pretty awful, served in catering jugs - the tea tasted of coffee and vice-versa. You would expect a teapot and  a coffee pot in a 4 star hotel. The food in the buffet was quite dried up really and not very well prepared. I usually look forward to a nice breakfast in a hotel, this was a let down. 

Car parking is ‚Ç¨12 for 24 hours, a little steep. You are about 5 minutes walk from the Luas stop at St James Hospital, which is very handy.

I would stay again but I would certainly expect them to sort out the breakfast issue.",4,2014,01,15
240,Very enjoyable experience,Spent a lovely weekend in this hotel. The accommodation was  excellent the room and bathroom cosy and well equipped. The leisure facilities were excellent also.The food was delicious and the staff were all extremely courteous and accommodating. The hotel is close to many tourist attractions and just a short bus/taxi ride into the city centre.,4,2014,01,13
240,Pretty good experience,"Stayed in the hotel over the weekend. I'd describe the overall stay as good. We had a lovely room with a king size bed with a fine spacious bathroom etc. Large tv but not the greatest volume of channels to choose from. Only real issue I had was with the breakfast!!!... The quality of the black pudding, sausages and the scrambled eggs were not up to scratch, I would say they were a fairly cheap brand to be honest. On a lighter note, I do think that on of the managers in the restaurant that morning could do with investing in a larger shirt as it was being pushed to its maximum as I think everybody could see what she was wearing underneath. Also, be aware that the on site car park is ‚Ç¨12 per night",4,2014,01,12
240,Pretty swish,"Me and my boyfriend checked in here at 10:30pm on New Year's Eve.
We asked for a quiet room and a quiet room we got.
The reception staff were all really helpful.
I only had 2 gripes about the room-the mini bar fridge didn't work, so I couldn't keep our groceries cold.
The main shower didn't have hot water, so we had to use the separate shower attachment.
The hotel is located a fair way out of the city centre, but we were happy to walk or get the bus.",4,2014,01,12
240,Nice clean hotel,"My wife and i stay here for three nights over the new year.
Nice clean hotel spacious room. Nice pool area, paid 2 euros for a hat more hair on my chest than on my head, we like a pool in the hotel, you can fill a gap in the day.
Not the best breakfast i have ever had, scrambled egg was slosh.
I would like to thank Aga (hotel receptionist) for helping us on the computer to try and book tickets for Madness new years eve. I saw her a couple of times come out from behind the reception to help people. she is an asset to the hotel.
couple of tips.
You can get the bus from the airport to Houston station 10 euros return. the bus driver told us it was a 6 minute walk to the Hilton. It was actually 15 (that's Ireland)
If you are interested it takes 45 minutes to walk into town. or just round the corner you can get a bus no 13 or 40 (2.35 euros)  
a pub we like is the Bank college green",4,2014,01,11
240,Good Stay,"I recently stayed here with my two sisters and my mum. The rooms were very comfortable, friendly staff and dinner menu excellent. The only negative was that breakfast on day 2 was cold. Otherwise a very enjoyable stay.",4,2014,01,08
240,Nice stay,"Enjoyed my stay at this Hilton.  Pros: The deluxe room was in good shape, clean and met my needs. Though the chairs near the desk was a bit cramped together. Checkin and checkout processes were quick. The front desk staff was helpful in meeting my needs. Cons: The hotel is not close to the city center, so you need to take a bus or taxi to get to the center. But the bus stops for bus #40 and #13 on Emmet Rd (about 200m walk away from the hotel) will take you to the center.",4,2014,01,08
240,"It's OK, but in general would avoid","My impression of this hotel is that it charges the same as big name city centre hotels without offering the benefits. They get a few things so wrong that I usually avoid the hotel where possible. I also sense that they're cost cutting as much as possible. So, this review is based on charging rates equivalent to Four Seasons, Westbury etc.

How they handle wifi is very antiquated...you get a piece of paper with a user name and code, someone must have to print these out and cut them up...seems such a poor process when most hotels have implemented a better system based on room number.

TV channels suck, no premium channels like Sky Sports, either in your room or the bar. As a business user, one of my few requirements is to watch ""the game"", but they are limited here and not many alternatives in the immediate area.

The room service and bar menu is pretty limited, calorie heavy and doesn't change often, so as a regular guest it gets very samey...again with issue that theres not to many options nearby.

Pillows are hard in my opinion.

The good points are that generally the place is well staffed and they seem to stay, so you get friendly people who get to know you. 

The area is nice (but well out of the city). It is very close to the Gaol and Cemetery, Hospital gallery so excellent tourist attractions nearby.

There is a decent gym, but it gets busy as it seems to be open to public?

But overall, if I had a more convenient option I would generally avoid this because the basics of good wifi and good tv (for a business guest) leave something to be desired.",3,2014,01,07
240,Stylish hotel with great food and spacious rooms.,"We chose the hotel for its stylish look with the added bonus of leisure facilities available. The rooms are spacious and cleaned daily although on a busy main road the noise was limited. Breakfast was excellent with a choice of hot or cold food and with so much to choose from, we really were spoilt for choice. There is a bar in the hotel and they do bar food  as well, or like us we booked a meal in the restaurant. For a 2 coarse meal it was 25 euros plus your drinks on top, meals were nice if a little small in quantity. There are leisure facilites in the hotel like a decent sized pool and jaquzzi  with a well equipped gym next door. Also there is a sauna and steam room located around the pool area.

The hotel is ideally located for the Killmainham Gaol which is across the road and a short walk away from the Guinness Storehouse which is a def must see when in Dublin ( book online and get 10% off as well)  Only downside is the out of city location, its a good 30 minute plus walk to the city centre, there is however plenty of buses to save your legs. It's a 10 Euro taxi fare from the main train station where you can also get the 747 bus to the airport ( they run every 10 minutes as well ).

All in all a good choice for a hotel with little extras that make a stay more enjoyable or special.",4,2014,01,06

240,dublin break,"hotel ideally situated for access to city centre , far enough away  to escape hustle and bustle of a vibrant city centre . access to hop on hop off tour bus across road ,16 drop off points allow easy access to all attractions and connection to tram system is easy from drop off points .kilmanain jail is a must to visit as is guiness store house .only downside was 2day break very enjoyable but much too short l",5,2014,01,05
240,A few too many niggles,"Firstly, what was good. Everything in the room was spotless, good facilities with free wi-fi. All the staff we dealt with were courteous and helpful. Good location. Expensive bar as you would expect but right opposite is a pub, The Patriots, and down Kilmainham Lane from there is the Royal Oak, a very old, very traditional Irish pub, well worth a visit. 

But for a hotel of the standard of a Hilton there were a few silly rules that let it down. The lift only allows access to the bedroom floors by using the room card which often didn't work. But the stairs immediately next to the lift had no security so it did seem a little pointless. Stingy with the tea, coffee and sugar in the room. Breakfast is buffet style but every morning we found crusty old fried eggs and had to ask for fresh - no one seemed to be monitoring them. Another silly rule - you couldn't take a cup of coffee out of the restaurant, it had to be decanted into a paper cup even though it was the same china in the rooms. Room service at night could not be ordered in the lobby or closed bar, it could only be eaten in the room which was bizarre and somewhat crowded. The pool is really a big jacuzzi and again had a strange rule that you had to have a swimming cap, which they helpfully offered for sale at 2 euros each. So 8 euros lighter we went for a splash only to find, both times we went, that there were loads of people with no caps, and again no one was supervising. It is a Living Well spa so this is not the fault of the Hilton but really! And the dressing rooms were absolutely freezing!

Usual problem with inadequate numbers of plug sockets - everyone has mobiles to charge overnight these days but one had to be done on the floor!

Do visit Kilmainham Jail right opposite the hotel. Absolutely fascinating and will feel familiar to anyone who remembers the jail scenes in the original ""Italian Job"". Also visit the Guiness Museum, well worth a trip for anyone who likes the black stuff, and we had the cheapest meal we had in Dublin there. Otherwise we recommend the Ryans Steakhouse on Parkgate Street, a 10 minute walk from the hotel and very good food. 

Everything in Dublin is very expensive to visitors from the UK, a glass of ordinary wine was routinely 7 euros so we stuck to the Guinness. Meals also very expensive, expecially in Temple Bar where we paid 100 euros for one course of so so food and four glasses of Guinness!

Dublin at New Year was great, saw Madness who were just as good as ever!",3,2014,01,04
240,"Good venue but bad staff experience - got disabled room, not delivering the promise made by staff","I travel a lot for business across Europe.

As there was some sort of conference, all hotels were booked and my company put me in this Hilton. Which on first sight looks good; new and good venue, large fitness and large indoor pool.

The location is quite remote from Dublin city center.

When I arrived in the evening, I got a disabled room. I was told the hotel was fully booked and no alternatives were offered. I mentioned that my company was not notified that it was a disabled room and that I would have looked for an other hotel in advance, but it was not mentioned on the reservation.

I have bad experience with disabled rooms - although they look the same with some aided equipement, one time I had an experience of receiving a disabled room in another hotel, and the matras was wet! So it's just like having bad experience with a certain dish, and you don't want to eat it anymore - due to the first experience.

As there was no alternative and it was 11PM in the evening, I accepted the room.

Next day I made it clear again, that it was not mentioned on the reservation and that it's not entirely honest. The woman of the front office desk understood my complain, and promised me to get back to me personally to provide me any gesture.

Guess what, I never heard back anymore.

240,"Hilton Hotel Kilmainam, Dublin, Ireland","My experience of this hotel was excellent. It was great value for money. Situated in a quiet part of Dublin, but only a !0 euro taxi fare to the city center. Service, rooms and bar facilities were of the highest standard. I will definitely return.",5,2014,01,02
240,Would Book this properste again,Very very friendly staff. Nice and clean. Good Housekeeping. The Hop On Hop off Busses stop right down the Street at the Kilmainham Gaol. The 13 and 40 Buses gives you easy access into the City Centre of Dublin.,4,2014,01,01
240,Bad Experience with Staff member,"Myself and my partner booked into this hotel to celebrate a wedding of  close friends of ours. We had looked forward to our stay at the Hilton and geniunely believed to be of a high standard. We both go away quite a bit and enjoy good hotels. On this occasion we booked our room through a travel website paying somewhere close to ‚Ç¨200 for the double room. I rang reservations to see if my booking had been confirmed a couple of weeks before our stay and it was. I was told the room was booked for us by a male member of staff. On arrival I was told the room was booked for one person with breakfast. I thought that was strange but agreed to pay the extra amount for my girlfriend. .The receptionist processed this and informed us of where breakfast would be served to us the following morning. I thanked her and went to our room.
The following morning we arrived for breakfast, We were met at the entrance to the breakfast area by a member of staff called Catherine. I gave our room number and waited to be seated. She informed me that breakfast was for one and I politely told her that we had paid and extra charge and it should be now for two. She ignored me and rang reception which was fine. We both were led to our seats and she asked us if we wanted tea or coffee. I got my breakfast from the buffet and returned to the table and as my girlfriend was getting hers staff member Catherine returned and threw a bill on our table for the cost of breakfast then turned and briskly walked off, not giving me the opportunity to question it. We had our breakfast and watched her as she tried to manage a busy dinning area, we could appreciate it was busy but her manner to guests was poor to say the least. We didn't enjoy the breakfast as we discussed what the problem could be. I returned to this lady after breakfast and once again she rang reception, completely ignored me and and then barked at us that we were wrong and take it up with reception, my partner told her that we would go to reception, at this stage she pulled the bill from my hand and ripped it up. This was embarassing for both me and my partner as friends of ours were standing behind us watching on. We felt it was disrespectful and after paying so much money we didn't expect to be treated so badly. My partner was quite upset I said we would get our bags and go as I didn't want to stay in the hotel any longer. We said that we would sort out the matter with a receptionist at checkout. On checking out Catherine spotted us from the breakfast area, and came over to reception to meet u . She never spoke just watched on as we were handed our bill. She appeared to get pleasure in when we were handed our bill, grinned at us and set back off to the dining area. Our bill turned out to be far more expensive then  our friends who had stayed with breakfast included. The ‚Ç¨20 bill for parking didn't make things any better but that was expected unlike the treatment received at breakfast. This member of staff completely ruined our stay, I informed a staff member on leaving that the lady in the restaurant was unpleasent and that I would be writing to management. The lack of communication in this incident caused a perfectly avoidable incident. I feel that the level of professionalism and lack of manners shown was disgusting. We are not a couple to complain and I have to say we both have stayed in many 4& 5 star hotels in Ireland and abroad and never received any bad treatment. Staff are usually courteous, professional and polite. We both are professionals & work extremely hard to afford nights away and expect better. This is not good enough for the Hilton Hotel group or any hotel for that matter. Our treatment ruined the experience of a somewhat very good hotel.",1,2013,12,30
240,Parking?,"We had 1 night stay.The is very very friendly.It was a quit cold in the room(418),we did ask about extra heater.After diner,we decide go to pool,but unfortunatly it was closed,we went after 8p.m.(pool is open till 10p.m.).We was realy disappointed.Ant last -for one night parking we are payd ‚Ç¨20,I just think thats to much...",3,2013,12,29
240,What I'd expect from a Hilton,Nice hotel. Clean and friendly.  Drinks and food is on the pricey side but it's Dublin and the Hilton so can be expected. Over all impressed with visit. A little bit out of town but a cab was cheap enough. ,4,2013,12,26
240,Great Dublin Hotel,"Loved my stay at the Hilton Dublin Kilmainham, would definitely stay again. The staff was attentive, the food was great (especially breakfast), property appears very new. It was a bit of a walk from Heuston Rail station where the airport bus dropped off, but totally worth it.",5,2013,12,24
240,Weekend stay,"Stayed here for my birthday last month. The hotel is a little bit out of the city center, but it we have a car, so it wasn't an issue.
The front desk staff, namely Anna and Michael, were very helpful in dealing with an issue I had with my booking. 
Overall, it was a pleasant stay. I will be back!",4,2013,12,21
240,Go here for the in dining experience,"Wow - I made the mistake of ordering breakfast in bed after a Saturday night out. Breakfast arrived. Poured the milk over the cereal, handed the girl the payment. No cutlery! she returned 15 minutes later with my change (still no cutlery) by the time someone did bring the cutlery (the staff thought this amusing when I had to phone) the cooked breakfast was so cold it was inedible and the cereal was like starch... it left a very bad taste in my (hungry) mouth and don't even get me started about constantly losing internet... all this for 186 Euros a night!!! Rip off - very disappointed...",2,2013,12,19
240,Great Weekend Visit,"Flew to Dublin for the weekend to just mark off another spot on my bucket list. Chose this hotel since it has a pool/jacuzzi/gym, a extremely nice one. The location was perfect,not downtown, but right on the bus route and close to the train. Actually able to walk to Temple Bar area in about twenty minutes or less. Easy access to the Hop on and Hop off bus. Just a great visit to a great city and stayed at a great hotel.  Thank you Aga and Ana for all your help.",5,2013,12,14
240,Enjoyable 1 night Business Stay,"I stayed here for one night at the start of December. The staff were excellent - a first for me - I was asked how many devices I had that required use of the free wifi! The room was well appointed and modern with a thermostat that produced optimal sleeping conditions. We had lunch, dinner and breakfast - all very good quality, and served quickly with friendly and flexible waiting staff. We hired a meeting room for two days, which was prepared perfectly and tea/coffee was on time and fresh. I even managed a quick run in the gym on a Saturday morning - empty, clean and with a great selection of machines. One small grumble - I was on the 3rd floor, obviously over a room where a Christmas party was in full swing on the Friday. But overall, highly recommended and my company will be using it again.",5,2013,12,13
240,Left me cold,"Stayed at the hotel last week on business. The hotel is convenient to Heuston station (10 min walk). The rooms are well laid out and well lit which I find frustrating in other hotels! However, the heating wasn't working in my room and it was freezing, the pillows were uncomfortable and the breakfast tea tasted of coffee...",3,2013,12,13
240,"Room OK, Service Depressing","If you want a clean, reasonably quiet and modern room and reasonable facilities, this is an OK choice. If you want any kind of pleasing service, you might want to try elsewhere.

I checked in at 23:00 after a day that started in the UK at 05:30. No friendly greeting, no acknowledgement of my exalted Diamond hhonors status. Oh well - maybe that'll stop me from one day saying ""Do you know who I am?""

However, my hhonors preference (high floor, away from the elevator, queen bed) translated into a room on the first floor, two rooms away from the elevators with twin beds, which I hate. There was no water in the room and no minibar. 

Having gone up to my room I went straight back down to Reception where I asked for my complimentary water. For the first time in four years, for some reason, my hhonors status had not been passed through the booking process and this was clearly my problem rather than that of the hotel. Room service bought me a bottle of water so I went to bed.

I could have lived with that but it was symptomatic of a number of annoying service issues. On taking breakfast, I was asked if I wanted coffee. Ten minutes later, I had to ask the same waitress for coffee - no acknowledgement that she'd forgotten to bring it. The breakfast itself cost me 18 euros - I thought it was supposed to be complimentary as an hhonors member but apparently not. It was not a pleasant breakfast either.

When I got back that evening, the half used bottle of shower gel had been put back on the sink surface and no replacement provided.

They had managed to provide me with more water, but there was no personal welcome or apology for not recording my hhonors details.

When I went to the bar, I had to wait quite a while for the staff to stop their conversation, or stop standing around looking vacant and come and serve me.

There was a menu on my table which I'd looked at - a waitress wandered up and took it away. I thought that maybe they were stopping food service, but she just handed to someone on another table. No ""do you mind"" or ""excuse me"" or ""did you want to order food"". Just rude.

I went to have dinner in the restaurant at about 20:00. There were at least a dozen tables, two occupied. The waitress asked me if I had made a reservation, which I hadn't. She made a big deal of finding me a table in this vast wilderness of emptiness. By the time I'd finished my meal, one other table was occupied. The food was actually quite reasonable, which by this time surprised me considerably.

I wasn't offered a chance to check the bill in the morning, nor was I asked how my stay was.

I'm likely to be in Dublin a lot over the next 12 months but it is unlikely to be in this hotel. The Charlemont Hilton which I stayed in a couple of weeks ago was an entirely different (i.e. better) experience and I'd rather trade a 30 minute taxi ride for the 10 minute walk that the Kilmainham version offered - the service was sufficiently poor and impersonal.",2,2013,12,06
240,"Good hotel, maybe a bit far out","Stayed here for a weekend break in Dec 13. The hotel was clean, quiet enough (although its on a busy junction so if traffic noise annoys you ask for a room at the back) and the breakfast excellent. Very close to Kilmainham Goal and Phoenix Park. if you want the nightlife of Dublin the hotel is a 15 min bus ride out of the city but on the plus side you can get to sleep at night.
Not a lot of entertainment options around the hotel",4,2013,12,02
240,Nice hotel with great staff,"I took the Airlink Express Bus #747 from Dublin airport to Heuston Rail Station.  I purchased a 3-day rambler pass for 15 euros before boarding the bus.  At Heuston Rail Station, I decided to walk across the street to a bus stop to take bus #79 to the hotel.  I waited forty minues for a bus to take me to the hotel.  I did not know that it would have been faster to walk.  I think the walking distance is about 15 minutes (depending on how fast you walk).  If the weather is bad or if you are traveling in a group, I would advise taking a taxi to the hotel.   

I arrived early in the morning but was able to check in immediately.  The room had a king sized bed with a desk, chair, and separate seating area.  There was also a small refrigerator in the room.   There was a separate bathtub and shower stall in the bathroom.  There was a good selection of toiletries provided including lotion, bath gel, shampoo, and conditioner.    The bathroom was very clean.

I am a Hilton Hhonors gold member, so breakfast was complimentary.  Breakfast was served buffet style each morning with tea, coffee, and orange juice being brought to your table.  I ate breakfast at 8am each day, and I was immediately seated.   I also ate dinner in the hotel restaurant the first night.  There was good food, good service, and live entertainment on Friday night.

The location of the hotel is west of the city center.  I took the bus in and out of the city.  I would have been a long walk.  The bus stop in for bus 13 and 40 is just one street over and buses run frequently.  There is much more to do and see in the city center, but it is also noisier and crowded.  The Hilton Kilmainham  was close enough to the center without having the heavy traffic and noise.",4,2013,12,01
240,Pleasantly surprised,Best part of the whole visit. Stay for weekend meet up with school mates.   Very good hilton and we'll looked after throughout. The suite was excellent and hotel was not too busy. Will definitely stay on next visit. ,5,2013,12,01
240,Excellent hotel and even better staff....,"I highly recommend this hotel. We stayed on a Thursday night and considered the rate to be very reasonable. Food was excellent. Staff were excellent, particularly ""James"" who was enormously helpful and genuine. A+++++",5,2013,11,29
240,Happy Hilton,"we walked from Heuston didn't realise it was good 'ten minutes' but it was sunny so not a problem but might be different on wet day.  Take taxi next time!  Hotel lovely - rooms large and very clean, excellent bathroom facilities. Bed so comfy, loved it! breakfast was very nice and staff both in reception and dining room were so friendly and helpful and efficient.  So well done Hilton Staff keep up good work!  would definitely go back to Hilton Kilmainham.",5,2013,11,28
240,"excellent hotel, great location","Stayed here recently whilst attending a day conference.
Facilities for that were good and well organized.
Instead of travelling back up north same day we decided to stay over and sample a bit of Dublin.

The Kilmainham Gaol etc is right opposite so no need to travel far for some culture....but we dandered up the road and caught the Luas (tram system) into Dublin city centre. Cheap as chips and got us there in 15 mins with a nice view of the city.

Taxi back later that evening was about ‚Ç¨12

Breakfast in our room the next morning :) gorgeous :) 

Cannot fault this Hilton, it is among the best I have stayed in :)",5,2013,11,27
240,Very pleasant stay,"Excellent hotel. A lot better than other hotels in the area and so much cheaper than the rest. Food in the bar was of great quality but very poor portion sizes disappointing after a long tiring day, maybe 4 or 5  chips on the plate, no salad etc.. Will return but will be dining elsewhere.",4,2013,11,25
240,Weekend Hilton Dublin Kilmainham,This is a very good hotel where we were well looked after. The room was a good size with everything we needed. Free WiFi is available which was much appreciated. Breakfast is a bit overpriced at 12 euros (with no option for a cheaper continental option) but apart from that it was a good stay here.,5,2013,11,25
240,What a little Gem and they have mastered the art of excellent customer service,"Myself and 9 friends spent last night at the Hilton Kilmainham for Bed, breakfast and evening meal and we had a great time. From the moment we arrived, we experienced excellent customer service from the reception to the bar to the restaurant and for some of us , the leisure centre. The deal was really good value at 75.00 euro each, the food was fantastic and the rooms were excellent.The Spa area was just superb... The hotel staff could not do enough for us and it was a really pleasant experience all round. Each and everyone of us loved the night away and we really couldnt think of one thing to complain about ( and that is good going) 10/10...Well done Hilton Kilmainham and a special mention to Ana at reception who was such a pleasure to deal with, helpful, professional and encouraged us to return.....WE WILL",5,2013,11,24
240,Stay for the amazing leisure facilities and spacious rooms!,"I stayed here for one night in a king sized room on the fifth floor. Everything from check-in to check-out was quick and seamless. Staff were very attentive, friendly and helpful with questions. Our room was spotless, with free wifi, a TV to relax in front of and a kettle to have some tea//coffee. 

We used the leisure facilities for a few hours in the morning (a Saturday morning) and were pleasantly surprised to have it largely to ourselves for a few hours. We took breakfast that morning also. The variety was excellent - you could have a full Irish breakfast, some fruit, some cereal, some pastries, some bread/toast as well as tea/coffee/juice. We were thoroughly full, and ready for the day. 

The only criticism from our stay is that the water did change slightly between temperatures and pressure while taking a shower. However, it wasn't enough to actually complain about. I would suggest that the hotel make sure to ask customers about their stay. If I had any problems, there would have been an opening to discuss and get feedback here. 

I thoroughly enjoyed my stay - had one of the best nights sleep in ages, and will be returning for the leisure facilities! I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to everyone. Especially, if you are looking for a relaxing stay - choose a nice room and hit the jacuzzi/sauna/steam room/pool to unwind!",5,2013,11,24
240,Very nice food,"Lovely room which I barely saw, because of a very late meeting. Food in the restaurant was delicious- a wonderful Thai noodle soup, followed by a vegetarian pasta dish which they kindly adapted from the chicken one on the menu- service a little confusing as many changes of staff but they produced everything according to order, correctly. Sad to have missed breakfast owing to a 6am departure.",4,2013,11,22
240,only minor complains,"Stayed in the hotel two times, both were generally nice stays. 
During our first stay we got a room with 'glass wall', which was nice, however with no possibility to open a window to get some fresh air to the room. Second time we got room with normal window, which we liked much better. Rooms were nice, clean and spacious enough (standard double-room). What I liked the most about the hotel were mattresses in rooms - these were really awesome, the best I ever experienced. Bathroom would be also perfect if there wasn't toilette brush missing.
We liked breakfast as well, provided food was tasty with enough choices. Staff in the restaurant was quite busy during breakfast time, sometimes we had to wait longer for coffee or juice (occasionally we didn't get any). Overall we found staff very kind in all hotel.",4,2013,11,20
240,Poor 4 star,"I've stayed at some great hotels 4 and 5 star, but for a hotel that's meant to be 4 star in my opinion it barely makes it , OK, so you have the standard clean good sized rooms and the hotel itself is pleasant , BUT that is what you expect anyway , you're not paying 4 star prices to get a 3 star appearance hotel, where this hotel has been a great disappointment is their service , staff in their restaurant barely understanding English, getting orders mixed up, and also my partner and I stayed in to watch a movie on the pay for view, to be given a very poor selection and very dated films, they worked out at 12 euros each , we went to choose eventually but basically the system has been broken for. While so we were told to watch normal tv on a very poor quality small sized screen, the reflection was poor , we asked if we could get a DVD player , after speaking to 3 members of staff they eventually said no with no sympathy or interest in our disappointment ,  and to make things worse , breakfast choices were poor, and the food was only warm and not hot , I'd love to at never again but unfortunately it looks like we may have to stay again due to its excellent location to our friends  they love almost next door , if it wasn't for that fact we would definitely not be retuning , there are plenty great hotels in the area ,",2,2013,11,16
240,Fantastic hotel,We booked a night at the Hilton during their half price promotion and picked the Deluxe King size room on the fifth floor. The room was lovely and the balcony on a summer's evening was fantastic. The balcony looks over the south side of the city and nearby Kilmainham gaol. The leisure facilities are great with the pool being particularly nice and relaxing. The hotel offers free wi-fi and is in walking distance of nearby bus stops for travel into the city centre and beyond. Breakfast was lovely.,5,2013,11,11
240,Concert weekend,"We were given a room on the 5 th floor,very nice indeed and it had its own balcony.Had lunch in the bar at lunch time, reasonably priced,would have liked a little more chicken.very tasty.decided to have dinner in the hotel before heading off to the O2 .soup superb,steaks very good,sweets looked great but Doctor says no go.The hotel is out of the city centre but the Luas is very close by.our taxi cost 15 euro to the Point,very reasonable.Breakfast very enjoyable.car park very handy and good value.This was our first stay in this Hilton and it was very good.",4,2013,11,07
240,Anniversary at Hilton Kilmainham,"Very nice Hotel, Staff are extremely friendly . nothing bad to say about this break away, highly reccomended stayed 3 nights during bram stoker weekend in Dublin , well worth the visit,buses and taxis available to get into town or the luas is onlly a five minute walk.",5,2013,11,07
240,Great Hotel,Wonderful hotel but location makes it better suited for business travelers rather than tourists.  Only within walking distance of a couple of museums.  Everything else requires a taxi ride.  We thought it was close to the rail/bus station but not really close enough.  But the hotel and staff were great.,4,2013,11,05
240,Great Stay,"Stayed here for 2 nights and had a lovely time, hotel is in a great location for walking access to the city and the food in the main restaurant was faultless as was the service, I can not remember the name of our waitress but she was very friendly and helpful, stayed for an anniversary treat and was greeted with a card chocolates in the room on arrival, a real lovely touch! If I am ever in Dublin again, I would definitely stay again!",4,2013,11,04
240,"Nice hotel - bad restaurant service, but rooms were lovely x","We stayed here over the October bank holiday weekend as I ran the Dublin Marathon - the location; although about 20-30 mins walk from the center of town; was perfect for us. It was quiet, spotless clean, modern and comfortable throughout. The reception staff were lovely and really helpful. The breakfast in the hotel was lovely and plentiful with a fine selection of hot and cold foods. The only thing we could criticize was the speed and quality of the service in the hotel restaurant - it was absolutely diabolical. The staff insisted on table service but then we waited 25 mins for a round of drinks.. which would have been bad enough (the place was half full at best) but to add insult to injury, we could see the drinks on the tray, on the bar and witnessed several staff walk by them for in excess of 10 minutes!  Unfortunately; this was not an isolated incident and happened several times over the weekend - It would be my suggestion that a bar manager would be worth his/her weight in gold (and increased revenue)
The pub across the road was a real find for food, drinks and service - so my advice would be to skip the hotel's poor service and enjoy a traditional pint of the black stuff with real people!",4,2013,11,03
240,Disappointed,Stayed here recently during a short holiday. The hotel is situated beside Kilmainham jail which is a great tourist attraction. Parking is very convenient and safe under the hotel for a moderate charge. The reception was attentive and our room issued promptly. The room was reasonable and we had paid extra for a view - which unfortunately was partially obstructed by the long metallic facade running down the front of the hotel. It did not appear that any other room in the front would be better so we accepted this. The dining experience of the meal included in the overnight package  we had booked was an enormous disappointment from what we had come to expect from the Hilton group. My wife's main course was cold and needed reheated. We could have let that go until we were informed that our desert choice was limited to just one desert. This is the first hotel we ever stayed in that had such a petty restriction - I really can not see the point of this and is bound to upset those diners who do not like the single choice on offer. As expected in all Hilton's the Breakfast was very good and could not be faulted - completely at odds with the dining experience. Overall after so many positive reviews from others it was satisfactory but not what we expected.,3,2013,11,03
240,A good hotel to stay in,"Went up to Dublin for a night with the 4 (kids) young adults - B&B.
We were able to check in early and drop off our bags.
We had 2 rooms beside each other - 3 in each.
The rooms are very nice and have wifi - a code is provided.
We enjoyed a couple of swims in the pool in basement.
The rooms were a bit warm at night and opening the window let in outside city noise.
Breakfast was very good, with Orange Juice provided at your table, instead of having to go and get it.  There was a large selection of fruit; breads; breakfast stuff - all good quality and freshly cooked.  We didn't need Lunch that day !
Staff very attentive and polite.
All in all, a very enjoyable stay",4,2013,11,01
240,Hilton Kilmainam,"Excellent service, great staff, good facilities and very comfortable hotel - located short distance from City Centre and good tourist attractions. Highly recommended. Onsite parking also good value and completely secure.",5,2013,11,01
240,relaxing stay,"A very good sized room - very clean - beds were great and so so comfy - we slept like logs!
Bathroom and toiletries very good. Staff were attentive and helpful throughout. Pool area disappointing - not for swimming in really!  Bar lounge area was very nice to sit in in the evening. Only had breakfast here - provided a good choice of food and as much as you wanted. No complaints - would use it again.",4,2013,10,31
240,"Spacious, comfortable hotel","Good hotel. The location is a bit further out however there are constantly taxis outside the hotel and most tourist hot spots are a short cab ride away (10-15mins). It is also opposite the Kilmainham Goal which was an interesting, worthwhile place to visit.",4,2013,10,31
240,"Bright, clean & modern","We stayed 4 nights durning a long weekend to Ireland.  The room was huge compared to other European hotels we have stayed at and very quiet. There was a big window which let in a lot of light.  I found the bed to be hard.  The bathroom was spacious with plenty of counter space & shelving.  I did have an issue with the shower.  The water would change temperature at least 6 times while showering.  It would be fine then it would go from freezing to burning in a matter of moments then return to normal tempurature.  It was the same cycle everytime.  My biggest complaint about the room was that we had no control over the air temperature.  Yes, there is a thermostat but it didn't matter where we set it, the room was always stuffy & made for very uncomfortable sleeping.

We found the operating hours of the gym & breakfast is be very inconvenient.  For a hotel that seems to cater to business travelers & tourist, the hours should be more in line for those guests.  Breakfast was just ok nothing special.  We were glad the price was included since we are Diamond HH members.

Location is pretty good.  It is right across from the Kilmainham Gaol and Royal Kilmainham Hospital which now houses the Irish Modern Museum of Art.  You can also catch the hop-on hop-off bus right at the Gaol.  We used the red bus with no complaints.  FYI - cash only.  We walked to Guiness which was about 15-20 mins.  I would not walk to the city center.  Taxis will run $9-$15.  We found it more expensive to head into town since the driver has to go north of the river.

Over, all it was a good stay.  The complaints were minor inconveniences & did not impact the enjoyment of our vacation.  I would consider staying here again",4,2013,10,27
240,Hilton Kilmainham,a wonderfully relaxing time was had by all.. the kids loved it. the staff were friendly and helpful. the pool well worth a visit..The card use in the lift was a little confusing but understandable for security. overall a fantastic choice.i will definitely book again.,5,2013,10,25
240,Excellent!,"My daughter and I stayed at this Hotel for three days whilst flat hunting. I was a little apprehensive on entering the lobby as it appeared dark and gloomy but that really is the only criticism I can come up with and on reflection, it was actually very stylish. Once you work out how to use the lift (a clever security device to deter non-residents, though  it would be helpful to let the guests in on the secret!) we arrived at our room and were very pleasantly surprised. The room was massive, very well equipped with both a bath and a separate shower. The beds were comfy our view out over the gaol was good, breakfast was excellent with a great selection, though the staff weren't that friendly or helpful, maybe they were busy. The spa was nice though the steam room was out of order when we were there. The first two days we used the spa it was lovely and relaxing, unfortunately on the last day when we were really looking forward to unwinding after another day of flat-hunting, the spa was noisy and very busy with  at least ten children  all dive-bombing each other and shouting which echoed throughout the spa. Should kids be in the spa or am I just getting old and grumpy? We obviously didn't stay too long on that  occasion. We  had room service on the last night and I must say it was excellent. I had the fish and chips which was freshly cooked my daughter had the pasta which she said was very good also. All in all a very good experience. I shall definitely return.",4,2013,10,25
240,Fantastic Hotel,This is a fantastic Hotel with lovely facilities. The rooms are very modern and the bathroom was spotless. The staff were very nice and helpful. Food in the bar was lovely and breakfast facilities were excellent. Handy location from the city centre.,5,2013,10,23
240,Needs some customer service training,"We arrived after a frustrating trip into Dublin and trying to find the hotel during rush hour, with one way streets and the lack (all over Ireland) of street signs. We were tired, we got into the elevator and became ""Charlie on the MTA"",riding up and down in the elevator and not being able to open the doors to our floor. Got off in lobby and asked for help.....""did you use your key"". We weren't told about that necessity...good safety protocol but....it would be nice to know. Then we rode to our floor and tried both keys and neither worked. Back down to front desk......had to figure out that the key was needed to operate lights. Back down to desk to inquire why the other employee had  taken 2 of the ""tickets"" of the 4 given to us on check-in (to use wifi) from our key folder. Never was an apology offered. Maybe we were bumpkins from the country but on one of my many trips I was with a new ""check-in"" and asked him if he knew how to operate the elevator....blank look. I'm sure he thought i was nuts but when I showed him how to make it work, he was as mystified as we had been. Note to Hilton...not all of your hotels have the same safety or ""green"" capabilities. BUT the morning staff was much nicer and way more helpful. The room was nice ,the bed very comfortable but what is the deal with the pillows in Ireland. Everywhere it was like sleeping on a cement block.Even the Hiltons pillows were flat and  hard.",3,2013,10,21
240,standard Hilton,"Nice hotel, good food, good location across from the historic Kilmainham jail (which is worth touring) A little outside of downtown so walking to sights can be time consuming.  What you would expect from a Hilton, they did not disappoint.",4,2013,10,14
240,"Very good, slightly out of city centre","I've spent a lot of time in this hotel for business and overall find it very good.  The staff are very friendly, helpful and approachable.  The rooms are modern and comfortable. The leisure facilities are good, although the pool is a little small, not many hotels in Dublin have any pool.  The food is of good quality, if a little on the expensive side.  The hotel is located opposite the Kilmainham Gaol, which is definitely worth a visit.  It is a little way out of the city centre, but if you like a walk then there is a lovely park you can walk through to head towards the city and then pickup the tram the rest of the way.",4,2013,10,12
240,Fabulous Service,"I recently stayed at the Hilton Kilmainham in Dublin and the service we received was superb.  It was conveniently located near the Guinness Storehouse and made for a nice location to walk around Dublin. The ladies who worked the reception desk were professional, helpful, courteous and downright friendly. As they were the first Dubliners we met (with the exception of the idiot behind the Hertz rental desk but that's another story....) they really made us understand the warmth of Ireland.  When we return, we will stay here again.",5,2013,10,10
240,Very nice business hotel to the west of Dublin City Center,"I stayed here for 3 nights. The hotel is modern and nicely designed. My room was large and well equipped - twice the size of a typical London hotel. I had breakfast each day - good buffet with full Irish breakfast, hot muffins etc. The room was quiet, even though my room faced onto to the road I was not bothered by the noise. The hotel is opposite Kilmainham Jail (a major historical site) and beside the Kilmainham Hospital (now an art gallery). The hotel is about 3-4km west of the city center, on the banks of the Liffey. There is a tram line (Luas) nearby or you can even walk into town (which I did when it was not raining).So a good business hotel if your meetings are near by, a little out of town for tourists.",4,2013,10,08
240,"Central location, clean, good value","Stayed here during the summer. Good value, really clean inside, terrace/bar outside was bit grubby but not dirty, just needed more regular glass collecting/cleaning of tables.
Bedroom - spotless, comfy beds, immaculate bathroom, complimentary toiletries in abundance.
Breakfast - loads of choice and friendly staff.
Location - walking distance to St. James Hospital and train station. Easy to find.
Would return again.",4,2013,10,07
240,A bit out of the way but quiet,"We stayed for 3 nights at this Hilton for our trip to Dublin.  It is on the west side of town and out of downtown.  There is a bus stop a block south on Emmet road which is very convienent to take into downtown. We walked frequently though and it probably took us 20-30 minutes depending on how far east you were going.  The hotel itself was clean and the room and bed was very comfortable.  We had a 2nd floor room looking out onto a street and I didn't hear the traffic at all.  There is wifi or a plug for broadband internet.  The bathroom was nice but until you get the hang of it the shower might be a little messy.  There is only a glass  partition (which swings out by the way so don't hold onto it!) instead of a shower curtain so the first day I think we got the entire bathroom floor wet.  Just make sure the showerhead is angled down all the way!  We didn't eat there so I can't comment.  But there is a great bakery down the street that we got breakfast at daily,,,,,,scones, croissants, tarts...(i believe it turns into Suir Rd....walk straight out of hotel, cross road and keep going south for 1 block, 4 star pizza is on your left, cross road and it will be up a few stores on your right).  
The front desk staff was very accomadating too.  We got an early checkin and they called a cab for us when we were leaving.  FYI we got the 3 day Freedom Dublin bus pass.  We used it to take the Airlink 747 bus from the airport to the Heuston Rail station which is a mile from the hotel.  You could walk it to the hotel but since we had a lot of bags we just grabbed a taxi to the hotel. Then you can use the same bus pass for any other local dublin bus throughout those 3 days.  
The only bad part was we didn't have time to take a dip in the pool.  It looked really nice and the workout facility looked nice too.",4,2013,10,07
240,"Nice, but far from city center","We stayed two nights during a coach tour of Ireland. The hotel is modern, with large well appointed rooms. The hotel is well maintained, and the staff are very helpful. The hotel is not centrally located however, and requires either a taxi or the tram to get to the city centre. Overall however this is a nice hotel to stay at while visiting Dublin. ",4,2013,10,07
240,recommended,"we stayed in this hotel for 1 night for the flightfest,
everything about the hotel is excellent, rooms, food, bar, staff.
rates are excellent and car parking is easy.
it costs approx 16eur by taxi from the city centre but there is also an excellent bus service.

240,Nice hotel but food and drink is very pricey!,Travelled here for my better halfs birthday in January 2013.  Very nice hotel a little out form the main centre.  Directley opposite the Kilmainham Gaol (Jail) which is definately worth a visit!! And is also 5 mins away from the Guinness factory which you have to see if your in Dublin.  Overall a good stay and the breakfast was hot and fresh.  Was a bit annoyyed that our TV didnt work for the whole of the first day and not even a complimentary drink to compensate us!!  Was never refunded our deposit as they claimed we had smoked in the room which was complete non sence but not much we could do about it as we paid on debit card! Make sure you pay on credit card to avoid any issues!,4,2013,10,03
240,Excellent Hotel - Service needs to be improved,Stayed in this hotel last August and found that the hotel is in an excellent location very modern with beautiful bedroom we really enjoyed our stay here but found the service in the restaurant at breakfast time and also the service in the leasure centre to be not of the usual Hilton  five star quality.  The hotel was extremely busy and it was obvious that there were not enough staff in the restaurant to cater for the large amount of people.   As a consequence we were waiting for 15 minutes for tea to be served.   It is my strong opinion that the management of this hotel should have been aware of the large volume of people booked in for breakfast and should have scheduled enough staff to handle the volume. The same very much applied to the leasure facilities as there were no towels available for clients.,4,2013,10,02
240,A good choice if you're happy to be away from the centre (but near public transport).,"I stayed here on business because my usual hotel was fully booked and it is within walking distance of the venue where I had to give a presentation on the Saturday morning.  The hotel is hardly attractive from the outside, but all the staff were welcoming and helpful.  My room was big, with a large and well-equipped bathroom (with a bath and a shower).  In spite of being near a fairly major road junction my room was quiet.  The free wifi was excellent.  Knowing that it was away from the centre I had booked a deal including dinner, which was better than many such inclusive meals.  Once again, the staff were very helpful (my only criticism of staff is directed at the barman who in a virtually empty bar seemed incapable of remembering who had come before whom).  The hotel is virtually opposite a stop for the hop-on/hop-off 'bus, but it's also near a stop for the scheduled services of Dublin Bus and only about an 8 minute walk from a LUAS (tram) stop.  There is a cheap day ticket available on 'bus and tram services, so it's easy enough to get into the centre without paying the high cost of the hop-on/hop-off 'bus.",4,2013,09,29
240,Dublin trip,"I recently returned from my first trip to Dublin and stayed at the Hilton in Kilmainham. I really enjoyed the stay and the staff were more than helpful and friendly. The leasure facilities at the hotel were excellent. I would also highly recommend the service from the hire car company, and particularly Brian O'Reilly. Brian was fantastic - taking us into Dublin and being the best tour guide you could ask for (and at a very reasonable cost). You could do a lot worse than staying at the hotel and using Brian's car service. Can't wait to go back!",4,2013,09,28
240,Nice place to stay,"I arrived Dublin for the first time in my life on 04 September  2013, and was received warmly at the hotel.  I was thoroughly briefed not only about the Hotel but also about Dublin city on checkin. The hotel staff were generally friendly and always willing to assist you enjoy your stay. The room was neat and comfortable with free wifi connection. The meals served were excellent. The hotel environment is serene, with quick access to bus stop,tram station and the famous historic sites, Dublin jail, and the Dublin museum across. The restaurants and bars are excellent. I really enjoyed my stay in this nice, beautiful and quite hotel, and have derived value for the money spent.",5,2013,09,26
240,Romantic weekend,"My partner booked this for valentines for a surprise weekend away ... I literally found out that morning I was not going to work! Haha concierge was brilliant and helped us get our bearings and also put us in touch with a brilliant resturant for the romantic meal. 
My first time in Dublin ... He is Irish and I couldn't of enjoyed it more. We did work into the town although the bus route is very accessible ... Had so much fun",5,2013,09,25
240,"Great place in Dublin, but far away","The staff here was great and very helpful. The free wifi was especially nice as we were traveling from the States and didn't have any data. The room was clean and hotel was situated directly across from a great little pub. It was also just a block away from the hop-on hop-off tour bus stop which was pretty convenient. That said...

It was unfortunately far away from anything else. We had to take either a taxi or the tour bus if we wanted to go into Dublin, and since the purpose of our trip was the Guinness Storehouse and pub crawling, this made it less than ideal. The hotel is situated in a poorer part of Dublin and it was pretty scary walking to the Guinness Storehouse that first morning. After a few days though we got the hang of things. I'd love to stay here again, but if we every visit Dublin we'll probably pick a place closer to the Temple Bar area.",4,2013,09,23
240,Excellent Staff,The hotel staff was very helpful. Michael at the front desk was very accommodating when we arrived after our flight in from Boston. Adam in the hotel bar was very helpful giving us some tips on local sites that are not readily noted in travel guides. Dublin is a very fascinating city.,5,2013,09,22
240,Our Visit to Dublin,"We have just returned home from Dublin having had a most enjoyable stay.  The hotel was first class and the staff very kind and helpful.  The leisure facilities were excellent.  We would also like to make comment about the excellent Car Hire Company, Brian O'Reilly.  Brian took us around Dublin and the best tour guide we have ever had.  His vehicle is clean and comfortable and nothing was too much trouble for him or his colleagues.",5,2013,09,21
240,Just average,"I'd give this a 5/10 for the Hilton Brand - more like a Hampton Inn.  No Executive Floor/Lounge.  Diamond amenity were two small chocolates and 2 bottles of water. Room was a bit dated with loose tile in the bathroom.  Initially was given an accessible room which has no tub and is open to the shower (was told at check-in ""you'll like this room as it is very nice"") which I had changed to another room.  Breakfast was good.",3,2013,09,20
240,Good hotel great staff,The Concierge was for more helpful than any other concierge I have encountered. He took a real interest in our trip and wanted to help us get the best bang for our buck. The front desk staff was very helpful in getting us checked in early as our flight landed before check in time. All in all a great experience.,4,2013,09,17
240,Admitted fault of hotel on reservation BUT kicked us out,"My partner and I called this hotel last minute for a reservation of three nights. Staff on the phone (Michael) confirmed this was fine for a 120 Eur per night. We checked in, he re- confirmed the same and just added that we may need to change room the morning after but no hurry, we could have called father breakfast. The same evening, after a dinner out, we double- checked with the recepionist and were told exactly the same. Fine! The morning after, I was awoken from my sleep at 9 by Aga, who told me I had to pay 520 Eur for the remaining two nights. I told her what I entered to in good faith but she said that they could sell the room to others for a higher price so I should pay. I was not happy and inquired about speaking to a manager. I subsequently got an offer of 120  eur for one remaking night and 320 for the other one. I refused that also and then Joanne called, saying that she was the acting manager, and simply asked us to check out the day after, the others rooms had all gone in the previous ten minutes, she admitted the mistake of the hotel staff and made reference to disciplinary measures against Michael and Aga, of which we think is very inappropriate. She was aggressive, did not let my partner talk, accused him of having called several times while we only received phone calls on that morning with random offers and inconsistent explanations. We later found out from the actual manger that she was also not the acting manager. The manager of the hotel, whom we met later that day, was extremely apologetic but only offered us a room with no AC and a cocktail which we did not avail of. We kindly declined the offer of a broken room because we had already made different arrangements after having been kicked out. We then checked out and payd full amount ( not even a complementary coffee!) and decided to write to guest.correspondence@hilton.com on 13 Aug after having inquired with Hilton office in London. Nobody got back to us, hence this review. I had hoped to avoid giving a bad review to a Hilton because I am often a guest to this chain for conferences and other business- related events and had never gone through troubles. This one was the most upsetting experience at a hotel I have ever had because all the staff admitted their fault and yet we have been kicked out with no refunds whatsoever but the offer of getting a drink. If the manager gets the idea to reply to this by giving me another email account to further inquire, pls spare me: the hotel has extensive written material on this very case and could solve it no problem without having me going through it again. Given the status of the situation, I will not stay at the Hilton again and do my best to prevent my Organization to plan events at your premises in the future.",1,2013,09,16
240,Dependable Hilton,"Just returned from trip to Dublin Amsterdam and Paris booked thru an internet deal for a very good price although I upgraded the Hotels from original offer and therefore didn't research the hotels like I normally would.  Was surprised at the size of the room at the Hilton it was not small by any means with lots of adequate clothing storage.  Room and fixtures had been updated and the bathroom was clean and sparkling.  Comfortable bed & best breakfast buffet included of the 3 hotels I stayed in.  My only fault would be the location, not walkable distance to most of the sights, but I bought a transit pass at the airport and used the public transit system which was easy.",4,2013,09,14
240,"Great Staff, poor facilities","Room I had was OK if a bit tight, but it did not have the nice touches you usually expect from a hilton.  There was no towelling bathrobe or slippers for instance.

The first room they put me in turned out to be above the kitchen.  Going to bed I thought the bathroom fan was a bit loud.  But it turned out to be the kitchen fan.  The staff turned it off, but warned that I would be woken by it at 6am.  So I asked it I could move room and they were very accomodating.  I can't say enough about the staff in this hotel, they really do go the extra mile.

Sadly breakfast was a let down.  Mid-quality self serve breakfast with dreadful bitter coffee.  I have had better in an average bed and breakfast and expect more of a Hilton Hotel.",3,2013,09,13
240,Class as always with the Hilton,"Stayed at this Hilton as they had a great mother daughter offer which we got a room upgrade, brakfast, dinner and cocktails. The added bonus is the lovely hydrotherapy pool which is mosaic blue tiles with a steam room and jacuzzi. As always the standard was second to none amazing breakfast that sets you up for the day, the bar staff and restaurant staff were absolutlely lovely remembering us the morning after the night before where we enjoyed the cocktails. The location is great for exploring Dublin definitely stay again it's a lovely walk through an art gallery if you get the bus from the airport to the station or you can taxi.",5,2013,09,10
240,A Happy experience in Ireland,"We stayed at the Hilton Kilmainham Dublin and had a wonderful time.  The staff was great and Ana and Paige went the extra mile to accommodate and make us happy.  The breakfast was great and the location was ideal.  The Hilton recommended a driver to accommodate us if we wanted to go somewhere.  His name is Brian O'Reilly and he really knows Dublin.  We highly recommend him.  He showed us many places the tour bus did not go.  We enjoyed his Irish humor.

We had a great time and hope to get back someday.

240,Business trip,"If on a company trip, make sure that the staff update their system to take into account the deal you are on.  They didn't for us, it took 45 mins to check out due to the bill issues.........  Otherwise, nice, clean hotel.  Good rooms.",3,2013,09,08
240,Fantastic staff,"Just returned from my stay in dublin at the hilton kilmainham. I travelled with my parents whom have difficulty walking and I can not thank the staff at this hotel enough.All the staff were polite and helpful from reception to the housekeeping !! Cannot fault the hotel.There is a hop on off bus stop outside plus the old jail ,you are in a fantastic area just out of the centre to make it quiet and close enough to get to when you want.There are taxis outside at all times which is great and the drivers are fantastic and so funny.We met some fantastic people in dublin and I didn't want to leave.Will stay at this hotel again .",5,2013,09,06
240,how come?,"We stayed there previously. Superb stay. However very disappointed this time. NO towels on arrival, dirty glasses in the bedroom, overpriced steak at dinner *The smallest stake in Dublin!!!). Well must say very disappointing after the first stay.",2,2013,09,05
240,Overpriced for what you get,"On arrival we were blessed to get an early check-in as my partner was just off a flight from Malaysia and all he wanted was a shower.  The lady at the desk was friendly and helpful.  However when we got to the room the disappointment set in as I discovered there was no bath!! This was such a disappointment as this was the only reason I had booked a King deluxe room ( with the balcony been a bonus). Before I booked the Hilton I had spent at least five hrs reseaching hotels with big bath tubs ( I know crazy but this was a feature I really wanted). When I found the Hilton I rang to ask about baths in the king deluxe room and I was told that this was the case, so away I booked!! Hence my disappointment. The balcony was nice and in use as the weather was mild and dry.  The bed and linen was impressive, very comfy indeed. Having a service trolley parked outside our bedroom door constantly was a bit annoying as the hallway was not that wide! When I rang to say the fridge wasn't working I was told it was because it was a mini bar !!!! But they did bring an alternative fridge to the room which was well needed. The shock the next morning after receiving two bottles of water, with a price of 13euro, ever the staff member delivering made a comment about the cost! I expected for a four star king deluxe room they would give complimentry water. Breakfast was poor for a four star hotel (referring 2 the quality of the irish breakfast). Parking was an additional cost of 12euro. Overall not worth the price but still a nice experience.  Would not stay again for these prices.",3,2013,09,02
240,Reunion in dublin,"We had a 3 day stay here last weekend. Met up with 2 friends from Australia
Thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We asked for rooms close by and were both   allocated rooms on the top floor nice and quiet and we could wave to one another through the window!  Food eaten in the hotel was good and staff very helpful but the most important person we met was Brian O,Reilly he helped us find our way around Dublin and suggested places to visit. Recommend a lovely restaurant in the country to make our final night together special. Anything he suggested or recommended was spot on and because of his  help and personal tour of Dublin we thoroughly enjoyed our stay in this city. He helped to make this trip very special for us all to which we are very grateful and enjoyed his company. Cheers Brian . Hope we left you enough Guinness",5,2013,08,31
240,Wonderful Surprise...,"This Hotel was all of what The Morrison (downtown) had to offer and then some! We booked this hotel at the end of a 2 week driving tour of Ireland. We started off at the Morrison for three nights, then drove Ireland, then ended up here, the night before our flight out. I wrestled a bit with this decision because it is so far ""out"" of the main area of town. However, we wanted to do the Kilmainham Goal tour and this hotel is directly across the street. It has wonderful parking (not free, but secure and easy in/out) and access for checking in as well. This might be an ideal spot for the train/bus traveler because it is walking distance to the terminal, as well. If you are in Dublin to party in/around Temple Bar, I still recommend The Morrison over this location, simply due to the location. Unlike the Morrison, this hotel has a full size gym and a wonderful pool, jacuzzi, steam room and sauna. It is just as convenient for hop/on and off busses. The city bus is 1-1/2 blocks away and goes straight through Temple Bar and on to Grafton street. We used the city bus to go into Temple Bar and took a Taxi back. The bus was 1.20 euro each and the taxi cost about 6 euros total. If you have already seen the city via the Hop/on-off tour, then using the regular bus/taxi is super convenient and reasonable. Our room was the absolute best in all of Ireland, hands down. They are spacious and the beds were so comfy. Wifi was, again, flawless. The buffet was bigger and had a bit more variety than the Morrison, but the venue had a more formal feel and the staff was not as gracious and accomodating. If I remember, we got a really good rate here, too. If you really want to be able to walk to everything, I would still recommend The Morrison. If you need a good fitness center and/or pool area, and want lots of extra space, this is your place!!",5,2013,08,31
240,Excellent hotel for business or pleasure,"Stayed here this week for three nights as it was very close to my office. Can't really fault the place. Decor was great, rooms stylish, bed was uber comfortable, even better than the one I have at home. Room was spacious, very clean. Bathroom spotless and the towels were really nice. Always a sign of good quality in a hotel.
The wi-fi worked great and they gave me logins for my laptop and iPhone. Only thing was although they were valid for 5 days you had to keep putting the code in all the time if you didn‚Äôt use it for a while. This is just  a software issue with their system but it was a little annoying.
The bar and outside seating area was nice and it was even sunny two of the days we were there ÔÅä. Ate in the hotel the first night My companions were ok with their selection but don‚Äôt get the pasta with Cajun chicken. Tomato soup with hard pieces of chicken would be more descriptive. Staff at the bar were excellent though as were all the staff I encountered in the hotel.
Breakfast was really good too. The sausages were like pork crack they were so addictive. Plenty of fruit and healthy options to including a pot of porridge.
I thought it a little odd that the chair next to my desk in my room was really low down but I only mentioned this to my colleagues the day we left and apparently the work chair was missing from my room which left me typing into my laptop like an orang-utan. Seems like it was only my room though.
Al in all I would definitely stay here again",5,2013,08,30
240,Excellent service,"Across from the Kilmainham Gaol, the Art Musuem and the ""hop on, Hop off"" bus stop, The beds were very large and super comfortable, the bathroom was huge. The hotel was simply excellent,  Breakfast and evening meal was truly excellent. Hotel receptionist Ana was so friendly and helpful. Can't praise hotel enough",5,2013,08,27
240,Best Hilton in Dublin,"I‚Äôm a regular hotel stayer for work, four nights/week for circa the last 5 years and visit Dublin frequently. I always give this property the nod over other Hilton‚Äôs in the area. 

They‚Äôve recently had an overhaul of all the beds and ensures a good night‚Äôs sleep. I did have a criticism, when I started staying here first, of the air-con, but it seems that all of that has been replaced  with a new system also.
Large TV‚Äôs with a broad range of channels and wifi is strong.

The restaurant/bar food is good quality with affordable options as well as some more indulgent choices. Room service menu is open later than usual and has more or less the same as the menu‚Äôs downstairs. Usually very flexible. Breakfast is top notch. Some healthy options on offer if you‚Äôre trying to keep on lid on things. 

The gym is fully kitted out and a recent refurbishment (including addition of heavier weights) makes it more appealing. It‚Äôs a public gym so you can expect a higher standard than the normal hotel gyms. Never gets too busy. Pool has a sauna, steam room and Jacuzzi as well as some hydro type jets. 

It‚Äôs a great location for holiday makers (across the road from Kilmainham Jail, walking distance to Hueston train station) and although not exactly in the city centre, is well serviced by Taxi‚Äôs as well as being on the main Dublin public transport route. 5 mins into Grafton street. Its also across the road from the hop on/off Dublin tour buses. 

The staff genuinely are very helpful and always pleasant. Checkin and checkout are fast. 

I‚Äôve given every Hilton in Dublin a run and, all things considered, this is the best one whether you‚Äôre here for business or pleasure. 
Solid thumbs up.",5,2013,08,27
240,Comfortable stay,"The hotel was clean,tidy the staff were polite,air con in the room was not great didn't cool the room down it ran for about 3 mins then cut off,the spa facilities are all you need for a bit of exercise with a swim & steam room.
This hotel did not really suit our needs as it was too far out of town it either meant a good 45+ walk into town,or a taxi,the hop on hop off bus is great but it stop running at 7.
Apart from the hotel there is only one place to eat at night which is the little Italian opposite,the food is good but a little pricey for what it is.
As I say the hotel is good with all the basic needs but if you want to see Dublin by night be prepared to travel",4,2013,08,27
240,Great stay in Hilton Kilmainham,Thank you so much for to all the staff everyone was so lovely.  The location was excellent easy access to the city centre and the surrounding area was so lovely and also interesting.  We ate in the hotel restaurant both nights while we were there and the food was very good very large portions and nicely presented.  Our room was on the fifth floor and was very bright and roomy and because this was a gift to my husband for his birthday there were chocolates in the room and a nice card and our room was upgraded to a balcony room an excellent Hilton.,5,2013,08,27
240,"Nice, quiet hotel","Across from the Kilmainham Gaol, the Art Musuem and the ""hop on, Hop off"" bus stop, location was very quiet. The room was really nice, the beds were super comfortable, the bathroom was huge. The A/C would NOT go below 19 C but the window opened, which sufficiently cooled the room. In relation to the center of town,distance is an issue. We walked from the Temple Bar area to the hotel and it took about 30-40 minutes. The cab was 12 euro, or you can buy the hop on and hop off bus. The Heuston rail station with the Luas is about a 10 minute walk. 

There is a grocery store and pharmacy on the other side of the art musuem grounds, it's a very close walk. Also there is a pub across the street if you don't want to eat at the hotel. 

Other than the location, which wasn't that bad, I have no complaints! Very nice stay!",4,2013,08,26
240,A little disappointing.,"Stayed here on Saturday 24th August '13 with my daughter. We were checked in at 4 pm by a very pleasant and helpful female receptionist, Short delay prior to being given key to the room due to a lightbuld needing changed in the room. We were offered tea or coffee - nice touch. Stayed in Room 330. This is a disabled room so has not got a bath, only a wet style shower (with weak water pressure). I asked the Receptionist could we change to a room with a bath - told the hotel was full so change request couldn't be accomodated. This was disappointing as I was not advised at check in that this room had been allocated to us; it is my preference to have room with a bath. It could be said that I should have stated this at check in or on booking, however in a 4 Star  hotel I do not think such an expectation of a room with bath and / or being advised otherwise is unreasonable in a hotel of this standard. In many ways I could have moved on from the bath issue but for the unpleasant encounted my daughted had at Reception with a mature aged Receptionist the next morning. My daughter advised the Receptionist the room had been cleared of luggage however we would be paying the car parking after 1 pm as I was competing in the Dublin Trathlon. The Receptionist was very curt, borderling rude, with my daughter regarding check out time is 12 noon. My daughter again explained the room was cleared of luggage it was only the car parking matter to sort after 1 pm. The quality of the breakfast was at best mediocre. Would I stay again? Sadly not. There are other hotels in Dublin.",3,2013,08,26
240,Very good quality,"Friendly staff, great facilities, bedroom huge (number 511 on 5thy floor), incredible breakfast. Located on the west side of Dublin opposite Kilmainham Gaol. The tour of Kilmainham was fascinating, go and do it. If you want a quiet hotel, location is perfect, if you want to be able to walk into Temple Bar etc, it was a bit too far for us. Allow 12 Euro for a taxi into Dublin Centre. If you want to taxi from the hotel to the airport, they have a set rate of 25 Euro, book it at reception though. If you like the ""Hop on Hop off bus tours"", they stop right outside this hotel. Costs 18 Euro per person and is valid for 48 hours. Well worth it",4,2013,08,26
240,Excellent,"This hotel was simply excellent, we stayed there with out two girls aged 5 and 16 months and it was one of the best hotels in Ireland and abroad we have stayed in. Breakfast and bar food was truly excellent. Hotel receptionist Anna was so friendly and helpful. Can't praise hotel enough. ",5,2013,08,24
240,Excellent hotel,"Loved this hotel, rooms were spacious, beds were really big and comfy, staff were all very friendly and helpful, bar area and terrace was great for relaxing, the only downside was our evening meal that was included as a package - it was really bad, but it would not put me off staying again.",5,2013,08,22
240,great hotel BAD experience,"Hotel is fine, 20 minutes from the center, I had bad experience since the air conditioning was not funcioning, Safe of the room neither, they lost my values when i left them in the hotel security...... the spa was half broken... out of that is a great hotel.",2,2013,08,21
240,Great hotel good facilities,"The hotel is really nice, its located across the road from kilmainham prison. The rooms were spacious and clean. The use of the fitness facilities was good. The hotel is a good walk from the main streets of dublin we walked it once but mainly for taxis which cost approx $10. The hotel breakfast was really good probably the best I've had in any hotel, there was fresh fruit, cereal, juices, pastries, cooked breakfast and continental breakfast! ",4,2013,08,19
240,Hotel Great,"Hotel was wonderful - but what stands out is the people.   Brian O'Reilly was the best.   As the hotel driver and host tour guide, Brian was downstairs every day - and had the BEST advice.   Bus/Tram/Taxi - Brian knew the best way to go.   Although the location of the Hilton Kilmainham is only perfect for viewing the Kilmainham Goal, Brian helped us get to everywhere we wanted to go.  Spa in hotel was also wonderful.",4,2013,08,14
240,Excellent taxi service and stay,"We stayed here because we were going to a concert nearby.  The hotel was lovely, the pool area was spectacular.  There was a hydrotherapy pool, sauna, jacuzzi.  We also had a wonderful taxi ride back to the airport with Brain Oreilly taxi services. On the way he gave us a tour of the city and he was so friendly and knowledgable. He really made our trip a special and memorable one.",5,2013,08,13
240,Air conditioning is a must!,"This is a good 4 star hotel with all the qualities of a 4star! Rooms ,food, bar and spa facilities are all flawless.10 out of 10. This hotel loses badly on location from city centre,it is a 30 min bus ride into town. Luas tram service is a15 min walk away. There are no nearby  restaurants or pubs. Kilmainham jail is across the road and a must visit for any visitor to Dublin.There was a group of 4 in our party all with own rooms, nobody had air conditioning that worked! Mucky humid nights in stuffy hotel rooms is not the stuff 4 star hotels should condone. Hilton badly fell down here!",4,2013,08,13
240,Kilmainham in Dublin,"Accommodation was good, upgrade was ok, spa & leisure facilities very good.  Restaurant a little disappointing choices were a little limited and waitress was unable to cope with the numbers (ie party of 14).  The tour buses were on strike which impacted on our weekend break overall.",4,2013,08,10
240,Good Hotel.,"Nice modern hotel and very pleasant staff especially at reception. The staff in the restaurant/bar were a bit over stretched as we stayed for the Ennio Morricone concert and the hotel was full.
We waited quiet a long time. It is close to Heuston rail station and has  easy access to city centre via public transport. The area seems pleasant and felt safe.
Would definitely stay there again.",4,2013,08,09
240,"Nice, but expensive meals","My daughter and I landed in Dublin just as a heat wave went away, for which we were grateful. The Hilton here is nice.  The beds are comfortable and there is a spa, which we took full advantage of almost every day of our stay.  

 We bought LEAP cards and used local transportation to see the sites.  On the day before we left we had to do laundry.  There is a laundry place nearby.  Once we had that task accomplished, we visited Kilmainham Gaol, then spent the rest of the day soaking in the spa.  

My only beef about our stay here is the expense of the meals.  The breakfast was 18 euros, which I felt was excessive.  We got a 6 euro break for our first breakfast because I am a HHonors member.  I believe this should have been extended every day of our stay.  The food in the restaurant is good, but expensive.  Nearby there is an Irish pub, an Italian restaurant, Chinese food, and pizza.  Having the mini fridge in the room made it easy to bring back leftovers from our lunches to have for dinner or even breakfast the next day.",4,2013,08,07
240,A 1st Class Hotel in Dublin,"We stayed 2 nights in the Hotel as we were taking part in the Rock N Roll 1/2 Marathon, we could have stayed longer it is the perfect hotel. From our arrival at the Reception area we were met with friendly, professional staff, the bedroom was perfect. We had our evening meals in the Cinnamon Restaurant which served excellent food by lovely staff who made us feel very welcome and relaxed. We also enjoyed our breakfast which was a selection of fresh fruit, bread, hot and cold foods it was 1st Class. We used the leisure facilities which were also 1st class and very well maintained and kept clean.  The hotel is a little way out of the city but we didn't mind the walk as the weather was excellent and we got to see another part of the city which we wouldn't have otherwise.  Perfect location for Phoenix Park, The Guinness Factory and the Kilmainham Prison Tour.  We have no fault with this Hotel we will be back and will definitely recommend it to our friends.",5,2013,08,07
240,nice stay for concert,"Good value for money, clean , efficient and very convinient for our needs.  Parking a bit limited on a busy night. Also bar service was inexperienced and poor , could not deal with a reasonably busy bar.",4,2013,08,06
240,"Nice hotel, slow service","Just returned from one night here. 

It's a lovely hotel, immaculately clean and maintained very well. 
The room was very nice, kind of what you expect of a Hilton really though. The mini-bar was broken in our room, so no drinks etc, which was awful to discover at 4am & dying for a drink of water! 

Pool area was fab, well worth a visit to. 

We had dinner in the restaurant and this was where I really felt it wasn't up to standard. We reserved the table for 9 o'clock & it wasn't ready so we waited, nice couch area for waiting. Nobody took drinks orders let us see a menu etc while we waited. When we did get seated it was a lovely quiet table for two but they were so slow, took ages to take our order, probably 9.45 before we ordered food, we ordered wine at the same time - it didn't arrive until after we got our starter, little things like butter being put on the table & breads arriving 10 mins later - just not what you would expect from a hotel like this. Still they were friendly & the food was very tasty. I really enjoyed the ambiance just service took away from it. 

Breakfast was lovely, same thing of waiting for somebody to come and seat us though! Great selection for breakfast, not just Irish breakfast, lovely fruits, pastries, muffins, yoghurts cereals etc. 

All in all we had a lovely time and couldn't fault the actual hotel but would probably head into the city for dinner if I were staying again. ",4,2013,08,05
240,First class,Stayed here for one night and have to say it was perfect from start to finish. Excellent rooms great food and brilliant staff. Leisure centre is up there with the best of them. Will definitly be back and would highly recommend.,5,2013,08,04
240,Great hotel for Dublin,"This is a really nice hotel, especially by Europe standards.  Plenty of room, in a nice location for tourists but not right in the middle of the congestion.  I especially like the concierge, Brian O'Reilly who also provides tours and other helpful info.  He was so awesome.  There are not a ton of restaurants around which is the only downside but I would definitely stay here again. Be sure to check out the Kilmainham Gaol right across the street.  A can't miss tourist stop.",5,2013,08,02
240,Always a good stay,"I always stay with Hilton Kilmainham whenever I visit Dublin. :) It always feels like home. Each time is always good. I highly recommend it.   Their beds are good, the facilities are all working and clean.",5,2013,08,02
240,Hilton Kilmainham,Great weekend at the hotel very impressed with the quality of the hotel and staff.Food was excellent and the location was great as we were attending a concert at Kilmainham Castle . The level of cleanliness in the hotel was excellent  and for access to the city it was convenient.,5,2013,08,01
240,Good business hotel,"Tastefully decorated, modern and relaxing environment. Everything works nicely and seems well organised. I come here quite a lot because it is close to a particular client, so my score on ""location"" is rather a personal one. There is a good restaurant nearby, and a nice park. Only one very minor negative point: the breakfast place is nice, but they have a strange labour-intensive way of serving  the coffee that led to delays a couple of occasions.",4,2013,07,31
240,Won't be rushing back anytime soon..,"Stayed here last week for one night with my sister as we were attending a concert close by. As the Hilton Hotel Group boats such excellence and quality I had high hopes. Unfortunately they did not live up to my expectations. Firstly, the regulator in shower was faulty as well as the shower tap being loose on the wall. There is also no mention of the ridiculous car parking charges on their website. This is very sly considering how much they charged us for a twin room for one night(245e)! I was also dissatisfied with the poor communication skills and service from check out staff. The whole experience left a sour taste in my mouth and I will not be returning to stay there in the near future.",3,2013,07,31
240,Great stay!,"We arrived late at night and had some trouble finding the hotel but we asked some locals and they gladly pointed us in the right direction.
The breakfast was included in the stay and had a various of dishes, both hot and cold. 
The room was nice and the bathroom big, but the room was facing the road and it was quite noisy but it got quiet around midnight. 
We ordered room service the first night, it didn't take very long and the food was very good.
The receptionist took good care of us, and recommanded restaurants, attractions and where to go shopping!
The Hilton Kilmainham is not located in the city centre, but the green hop on/hop off bus stops across the street from the hotel, wich is great for ""first time visiters"". 
If you are out late, a cab is the easiest way to get back and the cabfare is actually ok!",4,2013,07,31
240,Hospital visit for parent,"An excellent stay at the Hilton Kilmainham. Hotel is comfortable, clean and relaxing.  All staff were friendly, helpful and professional. Rooms spacious with nice size bathroom - our request for walk-in shower was granted.  Bar and restaurant service is excellent.  Spa and pool lovely to relax in after a busy day. Close to Heuston station- nearby to St.James Hospital. Quite a way from city centre but bus stop nearby and also hop on/off bus tours opposite hotel. Plenty of taxis. Kilmainham Old Hospital and Gaol next to hotel. I highly recommend this hotel to all travellers.  A quiet location for time out from a busy schedule whether a holiday or business.",5,2013,07,30
240,Ok stay......,"Stayed for three nights. Rooms lovely and very clean. Only problem was air conditioning was not working right and room was very hot, uncomfortable esp when travelling with young children. Car parking expensive and spaces are limited we could not get parked on our last night in hotel car park. Enjoyable stay but the Air conditioning problem would put me off staying again.",4,2013,07,28
240,Fab city break,"When we booked this hotel we expected the location might be a bit ofna journey out of the city centre. we were pleasantly surprised, however, by its convenience to a number of key tourist attractions and the ease of travel by bus and Luas. Staff were extremely helpful and nothing was too much trouble for them. Special deals on the car parking made the stay very reasonable. Loved our hotel and would certainly make another trip there.",5,2013,07,28
240,Best use of a 24 hour layover in Dublin,"Very comfortable hotel with great guest services.  The staff was extremely friendly and helpful with local area recommendations and directions.  I also enjoyed the breakfast buffet...very nice selection and quality of food.  Close proximity to Guinness Storehouse was nice, too.",5,2013,07,28
240,Solo Traveler's Delight!,"The staff is the real star of this hotel. I went Ireland alone and the staff was extremely helpful in making my reservations and in finding my way around town. This hotel is conveniently located and an easy walk to The National Museum, The National Cathedral and Guinness Storehouse. Since I was going on to Galway, they provided an attractive discount for their sister hotel and suggested I take the train to get there. That train ride was scenic relaxing and I enjoyed hearing  the announcements spoken in Gaelic.",5,2013,07,28
240,wish it were closer to places to eat,"Stayed here at the beginning and the end of a 2 week vacation. The hotel was clean and comfortable, although we did notice some differences between the 2 stays. First stay, room 340 - room was spacious for 3, shower stall and bathtub in bathroom. Plenty of plugs for charging. Breakfast was good, service was good. We did have an issue with room keycard but it was fixed pretty quickly.

2nd stay, room 226 - room was smaller, only a bathtub/shower (for a big guy it was cramped). Had to unplug a lamp to get power outlet. Beds not nearly as comfortable. Room was clean and neat. Breakfast was the same but we never got our tea. Since we wanted to get to airport, we just drank juice and were fine. Had an issue with room keycard again, fixed quickly.

Location to the old jail and the art museum were nice, but you are very limited in food/drink locations without using a taxi.",4,2013,07,28
240,Family trip,"Excellent Hotel, Excellent location, Service friendly Rooms spotless, hotel itself is spotless, food good  only negatives were the car parking charges which would add more costs if you were staying longer and the length of time for service in the restaurant especially with two small children present - 2 hours is too long - 40 mins waiting for starter from time of sitting",4,2013,07,26
240,Hilton Kilmainham,"Excellent location to visit Kilmainham Jail which is a must see(Visit as early in the day as possible as it can be very busy)Very helpfull staff,clean comfortable beds at a reasonable price for a city such as Dublin.Nearby Luas another plus.",5,2013,07,25
240,Ok for Business Travellers,Stayed one night on a business trip to Dublin in March.  Ideal if you have a car as there is an underground carpark and you can get to south Dublin easily without having to go into the city centre.  Rooms are clean and comfortable with a reasonable enough breakfast buffet. Found the atmosphere in the hotel very cold and the bar/food area unremarkable.  While the staff were efficient they were not overly friendly or welcoming.  Fine as a business stop over but wouldn't reccommend for a lesiure stay.,3,2013,07,24
240,As always very good,"The staff, hotel, room and general ambience of the hotel was excellent as usual. It is centrally located and makes it very easy to travel anywhere in Dublin. The spa/pool etc are very clean and meets everyones needs. Overall a very positive experience",5,2013,07,23
240,Most comfortable stay in the city in a long time,"My stay at the Hilton was wonderful. We got a great, quiet room with everything that we required for our stay. We dined al fresco and the menu was great. The calorie content was fantastic to have and the food tasted great. Portion size was spot on and the service was superb. A little walk to the Luas but nothing we wouldn't handle. Great staff, friendly and very helpful and a great stay for any event in Dublin. FYI if you are going to the o2 for a gig get a return Luas ticket as you'll be bumped up the queue for your return journey",5,2013,07,23
240,Tour group,"Very nice place- breakfast buffet was very good-
There was a small grocery store close by
But the hotel was out of any major or anything close by!
we were on a group tour and didn't stay long-
Globus puts their groups out of touch with other things!",4,2013,07,22
240,Nice place to stay in Dublin,"Would definitely stay here again.  Good room.  Good food.  Pleasant and helpful employees.  Convenient to remainder of Dublin though not easily within walking distance of many of the sites (was very convenient -though to the ""hop-on, hop-off"" bus tour services though).",5,2013,07,22
240,Fab Stay in Dublin,"Just back from a few days staying in this hotel.  We choose to stay in the Hilton as it was away from the hustle & bustle of the city yet still close enough to visit and with the Hop on Hop off bus service just located outside the hotel it takes you to all tourist attractions in your own comfort @ a cost of ‚Ç¨18 for a 2 day pass (which is well worth it).  
On arrival we checked in 2 hours early and much to my surprise the room was ready with the a/c on as it was such a hot day outside.
We ate in the hotel that evening and the restaurant accommodated our request for dinner @ 5pm (although it doesn't open till 7pm) as we were going to a concert in the o2 and it was lovely.  The breakfast in the morning was first class ranging from cereals, porridge, freshly made pancakes, fruit, yogurts, pastries, cold meats & the usual hot food with plenty of it.  
The bedroom was up to the usual Hilton standard and there was no noise.  I can't fault this hotel or it's staff and had a wonderful stay!",5,2013,07,22
240,Great hotel,"This hotel has a great location, even though it's not downtown. This hotel is steps away from Kilmainham Gaol and there's also a bus stop real close too. We had breakfast-buffet included and I must say it was really good. Great choice, espacially for someone limited by allergies like me. We paid 108 euros per night (breakfast included), a really fair price I'd say. 
The staff was also really friendly and helpful. I have nothing negative to say about this hotel.
We enjoyed the pool, sauna and jacuzzi also!",5,2013,07,20
240,Clean and efficient,"The hotel is the standard Hilton business class affair, with excellent amenities and friendly, helpful staff.  Food in the restaurant is very good.  The location suited my business needs but the hotel isn't close to the center of town, so I wouldn't stay here if I wanted to visit Dublin as a tourist.  Only stayed one night so I didn't bother to complain about the air conditioning not working.  I don't think you need it often in Ireland - the hot weather at the time of my stay was probably an unusual stress on the system.  Free Wifi was a nice bonus.",5,2013,07,20
240,our best experience in ireland!,"michael at the font desk welcomed us when we arrived. me and my two daughters spent a week in ireland. we traveled east to west. your hotel, hands down, was the most pleasurable experience of all. i hated to leave it. clean, fresh, modern, friendly, great location!  what more could one ask. Likes: glass bottles of water for the room. CLASSY!!!!  Lime tree restaurant nearby!!! fantastic food, friendly, good prices,  near the old prison. near phoenix park. the killers were at the hotel while we  were, but we didn't see them. wished they had dinner. access to bus to dublin!  all around class act!!!!!! thank you for your friendliness to us. as americans, it was our first visit to ireland. i was sad to leave. every irishman and woman we encountered was friendly and helpful. they would go out of their way to assist us if we looked lost as we gazed at maps. you have a beautiful country!!  the only suggestion i would make to improve your hotel would be to have a single access code for the internet that stayed logged in. we had 6 different components that all had their own separate log in and they expired every time we signed out. we had to sign each one back in separately. no big deal, but nowadays, everyone has wifi, and it's available almost everywhere. simplify that issue, and you have a perfect hotel!! :)  recommend this place if you want to live like a king.",5,2013,07,20
240,Great Experience,"My husband, sons, and I visited Dublin for the first time in June 2013 and stayed at the Hilton Kilmainham.  We had a great experience there.  My husband and I had a balcony room with a king-size bed, not easy to find in Ireland!  Our room looked out over a park across the street (Irish Museum of Modern Art) , and we enjoyed sitting out on the balcony, even when it was raining.  We even saw a small, red fox over there one of the days, which delighted me. Our boys (14 and 22) shared a room with a king bed and a twin bed - again, the larger bed for my 6'4"" 22-year old was a treat.  Most ""double"" rooms in Ireland consist of two twin-size beds, which my oldest will not fit in (his feet hang off the end).  

The rooms were up to date, kind of a modern Ikea look, and very clean (though it took me awhile to figure out why there was no plug outlet for a hair dryer in the bathroom, only an odd outlet for an electric shaver.  All of Ireland is like that.  I just dried my hair at the desk in the room, which included a mirror.).  The rooms were neatly made up every day.  And we found the staff to be very pleasant - at the front desk, the restaurant, and at the breakfast buffet.  We also found the breakfast buffet delicious - the food never varied for the 4 nights/5 days we were there, but there were many, many choices:  cereal, pastries and muffins, yogurt, cheese and deli meat, scrambled eggs, the delicious Irish bacon (which we Americans would call salty ham - loved it), potatoes, black and white pudding, sausage, juices, etc.

The only negative to the hotel was that the bed was not up to the standard of a Hilton in the US (Hilton Serenity bed by Serta).  I thought the bed was pretty hard, but then I discovered that it was better than any of the other beds we encountered in Ireland!  And the bedding was nice with the cozy duvet.

The location of the hotel required us to take a cab into the City Center/Temple Bar area, but we knew that beforehand and preferred it when we got to Dublin.  I thought the area around the Hilton was very nice, and it was quieter and less rowdy than the City Center/Temple Bar area hotels.  The outside of it is much nicer than in the Tripadvisor picture too, which looks so stark.  When facing the front of the Hilton, you will have the green park on your right and on the left is a nice, tree-lined street with the Kilmainham Gaol (which is a hauntingly beautiful-looking stone building).  And in front of the hotel was an outside dining area, which was enjoyable on a sunny day.

All in all, we would definitely stay at the Hilton Kilmainham again.  We are looking to go back to Ireland again, possibly starting in Belfast this time, and their Hilton does not have balconies.  :(  The balconies and the king-sized beds make the Hilton Kilmainham a real treat, and the rooms are reasonably priced as well.",5,2013,07,17
240,hotel stay,"Very nice hotel stay, comfortable bed and clean bathrooms. Loved the swimming pool and spa. Loved the steam room and sauna. Used the swimming pool on both the first and second day of my stay. Hotel staff were helpful and friendly.",5,2013,07,17
240,Poor service,"We got a room on 3rd floor & it was very noisy, we called reception around 10pm & we've been told someone will fix it, we waited more than half an hour, no one show up, we called reception again & this time the girl said the duty manager will personally come to our room to check, another 20 mins later, we still see NO ONE, finally I went to the reception myself & changed to 4th floor, the 2nd room was nice & quiet. The girl in reception was on her own so I can understand she cannot leave reception, however, I cannot understand why no one show up when I called to complaint the noisy & why the Duty Manager did not show up as well? Did he/she get lost???",2,2013,07,16
240,Love this hotel!!,"Staff at reception where extremely helpful and were able to answer all our questions and give directions. (I even phoned in advance and Asked to check in early and this was accommodated with no problems!) 

Room were spacious and clean, bed was so comfy! Best hotel we have stayed in, in a while! :)

Pool was an added bonus... Make sure you bring your swimming suit as its well worth it!! 

Will definitely be coming back! Thanks for everything, loved every minute :)    ",5,2013,07,15
240,Great four * a little out of town.,"My husband and I arrived to check in at 3.30pm only to be told your room was not ready. it was past check in, and we have never experienced this ever. Fortuanatly when the reception recoginised that we where not impressed he found us a room.
We got to the  room and it was a very well appointed room with all nice quality products. I put on the air condition unit, it did work but not great. went to open a window these are solid panes of glass and cannot be opened. At home the first thing we do everyday is open the windows to let air in. I did go to reception and explained and I recieved a fan.  We had 2 nights at this hotel if i was staying a further night we would have needed a room change.
Breakfast both mornings was perfect.
Pool area is just devine, there are few pumps not working but some are
All in All a very nice hotel. We would most definantly return only to be guaranted with a window. I get very bad headaches and sinus problems if our home is too stuffy and if you are the same insist on window
.We tried a little of the food and it seemed good  
We have stayed in a few other 5 star hotels and four star more towards town and the o2, it would be a close call for me which hotel to pick. All mostly good points, the other 5 star hotel up by st stephens green has no pool but has sliding doors out to a courtyard. The 4 star we stay in gives  us a balcony overlooking the 02 and I leave this open alot. I write this because I cant believe that a hotel has been designed that some windows are stactic. All in all we will return.",4,2013,07,15
240,Restaurant Review/Awful,"I visited the restaurant a few months back after I purchased an online deal for two.  From start to finish it was not a pleasant experience for either of us. As we were on the ""meal deal"", we were given a separate, limited and uninteresting menu.  Our server was not friendly and didn't get much right on the night.  The food left a lot to be desired.  We certainly felt that their heart was not in it. Even the bar man was grumpy!  I am very glad to say that we had exactly the opposite experience with a meal deal in Kathmandu Dame St 3 weeks ago.  So Hilton take a few lessons from them!",1,2013,07,14
240,Dublin Hilton was very good.,We recently stayed at the DublinHilton as a family. Kids liked the pool but it is too small for laps. Fitness Center was excellent. Breakfast buffet excellent although they were out of gluten free bread one day. Great lattes and tea! Very helpful staff with our tourist questions.,4,2013,07,11
240,Good value for money,"If you're looking for a short break and want to stay in Dublin and want to live in a comfortable room, eating lovely food then this hotel is more than worth it. The staff were polite, helpful and friendly. I'd go back again!",4,2013,07,10
240,Would stay again,"Stayed here for a short break. Was very pleased with this hotel. Handy car parking underneath, small but nice pool area, great room, good service, well priced. A visit to the old gaol just across the road is also very worthwhile!",5,2013,07,10
240,"Interesting location, helpful staff","I had to book a room in Dublin on relatively short notice, and was fortunate enough to find this well-managed hotel.  The staff was very friendly and efficient, the facilities were clean and up-to-date.  Good wireless connections and buffet breakfast.  The hotel is located near two of Dublin's most popular tourist attractions, the Kilmainham Gaol and the Guinness Storehouse, which also means that it is on some tourist bus routes that will bring you to other sites around the city.  On the other hand, the hotel is a bit removed from the downtown shops and restaurants where many visitors will want to spend time.  My corner room had large windows on two walls; I would recommend it, if available, for people who like a lot of natural light.  All in all, a pleasant and comfortable stay with a helpful staff.",4,2013,07,09
240,Need wifi,"I want to like the hotel more as an avid Hilton points collector but i feel it's slightly underwhelming. My number 1 frustration is not connecting to wifi. As a business traveller when I'm staying h for 2 nights I need super fast wifi both nights. On this stay, I had ZERO wifi at all for the entire stay. Would connect on my laptop, iPhone or iPad at any time - really disappointing and just leads me to the Radisson Blu instead.",3,2013,07,09
240,Quick trip to Dublin,"I spent two days in Dublin, and I have to say the hotel is well-located if you want to stay in a quiet area, a bit far on foot from the center. Facilities are well-conserved and clean. Personnel is very nice. Service at terrace is a bit slow, but it was ok.",4,2013,07,09
240,Found my new fav hotel!!!!!,"My new husband and I were looking for a break away by ourselves before we brought our kids on holiday, well what can I say! We hit the jackpot when we found the hilton! Such a fantastic hotel. From the minute we walked in the door we were greeted with nothing but hospitality and friendliness! Our room as fantastic! Fresh, clean and spacious! With the heat we had this weekend we were thrilled with the aircon and mini fridge! The pool is so relaxing, after a long day around dublin there was nothing nicer than unwinding in the pool! Dinner was fab, although we were brought out our dessert before our main course! But hey, that's not a big issue! Cannot wait to return to this hotel, thoroughly enjoyed ourselves!! ",5,2013,07,08
240,"GGG - Great Location, Great Services, Great Stay!","Spent three days at this hotel.  Excellent choice for family, friends, and visitors.  Great location, but in quiet neighborhood away from the bustle.  Very clean and exceptional Hilton service.  Staff very friendly and helpful for restaurant suggestions and general orientation. Pool, steam room, sauna and fitness center great to work off those Guinness pints!  Hop-on-Hop-off tourist bus across the street and walking distance to many attractions.  One small complaint.  The Irish coffee in the bar was not what I expected.  I still think the Buena Vista on Fisherman‚Äôs Wharf, San Francisco makes the best Irish coffee ‚Äì period!  But then maybe I am picky!  I hope to return to this hotel for my next Dublin stay.",5,2013,07,08
240,why book us a noisy room??,"After 15 wonderful days in Ireland, we checked in to our pre-booked room on the eve of our trip home. All the staff acted friendly and professionally.    Unfortunately for us, the door of our room faced the double-doored lobby of the 3rd floor lift.  (So, months ago, this hotel determined that the best room they could possibly assign us was the one adjacent to all of the third floor traffic.)     We kindly requested a quieter room, which the hotel staff were quick to give us, since they had so many empty rooms on that floor anyway!    We went back to the same floor and proceeded to a room where we enjoyed a quiet night's sleep.  Why didn't they just assign us a decent room in the first place, back when we booked in April?
   On another positive note, we ate an excellent lunch in the hotel restaurant.",2,2013,07,08
240,Wonderful Hotel,"We stayed at the hotel for three nights after arriving early morning after an overnight flight from Chicago.  The staff were very helpful in storing our luggage until our two connecting rooms were ready.  When we returned to the hotel around noon our rooms were ready.  Two beautiful rooms that were just what we asked for.  A double in one room and two twins in the connecting room.  Air conditioning in both rooms was a big plus which allowed us to close to windows and shut out what little street noise there was. The rooms were very clean and had a fresh smell to them.  Very upscale toilet items in the bathrooms.  Coffee, tea, and cookies in each room.  A great thanks to Jennifer who had made sure the rooms available were what we requested and also for arranging with Brian to meet us at the airport.  Brian not only brought us to the hotel but took us through the city and showed us many things of interest along the way.  He even stopped a few times to explain different landmarks.  What might have been a boring ride from the airport to the hotel was turned into a very interesting and informative mini tour.  The front desk staff was very friendly and helped us find a great place for dinner a short walk away.  The breakfast each morning had every breakfast item you could think of and then some.  Free internet connected computers in the lobby were great for checking e-mails and printing a map to our next destination.  Wonderful pool and fitness area. We had a wonderful stay at this great hotel.",5,2013,07,07
240,A great last minute stay,Booked this hotel for three of us( husband and son) on the day of travel! Bit last minute! Have to say I was very pleasantly surprised. Sometimes hiltons can be a bit lacklustre but this one was very clean contemporary and modern. The staff were outstanding especially those at dinner closely followed by the breakfast staff. Hotel is easily found from m50 well located for historic dublin and still well placed for luas or driving into city centre. Hotel is situated in lovely leafy street facing gaol and museum. There was a busy outdoor terrace and seating area well serviced by attentive staff. Drinks were fairly priced. We got a dinner bed and breakfast deal and ate from the 3 course ‚Ç¨25 menu plus coffee. Food was excellent service superb to the point u were happy to leave a tip! Breakfast was also excellent with food regularly being replenished and hardworking attentive staff. Tables needed dirty dishes removed more speedily. There was a pool sauna and jacuzzi and gym area. Car parking under the hotel was spacious and free. There were several computers in the lobby for printing off boarding passes etc.  the room and bathroom were clean comfy well equipped plenty tea coffee toiletries and towels etc.  we were in room 304 overlooking the gaol. The hotel was very busy.  All in all a great but brief stay wch I would highly recommend!,4,2013,07,07
240,Loved this hotel,Really loved this wee break with my hubby when i go to a hotel i want a treat u kno?? Its my break from wrk n home etc i was so relaxed n chilled staff were fab hotel bar was lovely food delicious the room was spacious spotless n fresh walking distance to the zoo n plenty of taxis outside to take you where u want to go would def luv to go back,5,2013,07,06
240,Comfort in Dublin,The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful and went out of their way to make sure all of our questions were answered; all our needs were met.  The only issue we had was the party-room door that let sound from next room flow into our room.  Luckily the people staying there didn't talk too long and was able to drift off to sleep.  Breakfast and dinner service was excellent and enjoyed the European way of cashing out guest check by brining over a portable credit card processing machine.  Location excellent to view historical sites and get on the hop-on-hop-off bus.,5,2013,07,06
240,excellent hotel near to Dublin Centre,"We stay for a total of three nights.  Good and friendly staff, very helpful.  Excellent breakfast with the best back bacon we have tasted, cooked to perfection.  Also appreciated the fried eggs on the buffet table, (something that a lot of hotels refuse to offer and would ask you to make an order and wait for it to be cooked by an inexperienced egg fryer).  Also had lunch at the restaurant.  Food was good and inexpensive.  Contrary to what other people were complaining, Kilmainham did not charge for car parking.",4,2013,07,04
240,Complete shambles,"The staff as soon as I entered the hotel the staff were unhelpful and very unpleasant, noone helped us with are bags, the receptionist was dismissive and unwilling to help,we got our room keys they didnt work, receptionist was once again unhelpful! We entered the room, Crums everyone on floor, mirrors dirty, the milk for tea and coffee was off, the fridge was turned off, the aircondition was very poor even when it was at lowest temperature! We went for dinner in the restaurant, I got burger partner got ribs, burger was hard like a rock could barely eat it, chips were under cooked, ribs were very fatty and had barely any meat on them! As for breakfast bacon over cooked, sausages burnt, fried egg wasnt dippy! I have never been so dissapointed with a stay in a Hilton, I have stayed in many and this is not up to standard, poor service! Alot of the staff spoke poor English as well! Upset / angry customers was not worth 156‚Ç¨!!",1,2013,07,02
240,Great hotel,"This hotel is excellent in every respect.  Quality accommodation in an excellent location, quite close to the city centre and the main train station and tram station.  It is walking distance to the Guinness brewery and one a few minutes on the tram (luas) will get you to the Temple Bar area of Dublin City.  Quality customer service and well run. The hotel is well staffed and seemed to run smoothly even though it was quite busy.  I can easily recommend this hotel in Kilmainham Dublin.",5,2013,06,24
240,It's about service,"The end of May (2013) and my wife and I were finishing up our tour of Ireland at the Hilton Kilmainham.  The service, room and all accomodation were excellenent.  

We had two days to ourselves before we would pick up with a second (European) in London, so we booked a room at a local ""Downtown"" hotel (Jury's Inn at Christ Church)....huge mistake, the room was incredibly small, had previously housed a smoker and had no air conditioning and the ancient toilet was horrible.  My wife tried to immediately rebook us at Hilton Kilmainham through OnHotels.com.  OnHotels responded to our booking by informing us that 'the booking process can not be completed', preventing the confirmation of our booking.  Desperate to escape Juy's Inn, we booked a room at Hilton Kilmainham through Expedia.com.  A couple of hours later, we received a confirmation from OnHotels.com that our reservation at Hilton Kilmainham was confirmed.  I attempted on numerous occassion to explain to OnHotels.com that we had made alternate arrangements due to their being unable to complete the booking at the time we tried to book a room.  They, in turn, insisted that I was respnsible for payment of the room. Despite my repeatedly pointing out to OnHotel.com that the problem was the result of their failed technology, they insisted that that I pay for the room, adding that they had been ""in touch""  with the hotel who refused to amend or otherwise revise the reservation.  

Frustrated beyond words, I vented with the desk at Hilton Kilmainham.  To my astonishment I found a sympathetic ear in Michael, who agreed that it was ridiculous to think that I would be paying for the same room twice, once through Expedia and once through OnHotels.com.  It was late in the evening and he assured my wife and I that he would leave a full explaination for the desk to follow-up on in the morning.  

In the AM our plight was picked up by Anja, who told us that we had been misinformed by OnHotels.com, since nobody had been in touch with her and matters such as our would have to go through her.  Needless to say, the entire matter was resolved due in large part to the perseverance of the desk staff at Hilton Kilmainham.  What strikes me most about this is that Hilton had nothing to gain by assisting us....they were going to be paid for the room in any event.  It was simply a matter of Customer Service and focus on the guest......needless to say, I am a Hilton Customer for keeps.  Kudos to the staff at Kilmainham!!!!!!",5,2013,06,23
240,Excellent hotel.,"The room we were given initially had a broken air-conditioning system, but we were very graciously given another room. (This was important, because we faced onto Inchicore Road and windows of the room couldn't be opened.)  The room was very pleasant and clean. Location-wise, the hotel is a bit of distance from the downtown area, but it is in a nice area near Inchicore Village and some good eateries. 

The front desk very graciously helped us with  directions to the nearest bank machine and also reserved a taxi for us the next morning for our ride to Connolly Station.",5,2013,06,22
240,Excellent stay!,"My husband and I stayed here in September, and I had such a good experience I thought I should get around to writing a review! The room was very nice. It was very clean, the bed was comfortable, and the room was quite large after coming from a stay in London! Breakfast was included in our rate. It was also outstanding, and was a great way to start our days. We also really enjoyed the pool and spa, which are attached the a small gym. This was a wonderful was to relax in the evenings after walking all over Dublin. The staff was also very nice... from the front desk to the waiters at breakfast. This is a little further out in Dublin. However, we walked to the train station and took the tram, which was never an issue. There is also a very nice park and running trail nearby, which was nice for morning runs. I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this hotel. If I am lucky enough to return to Dublin in the future, I would stay here without another thought!",5,2013,06,20
240,Great experience,"One of the best hotels I've stayed in for sure. However, I usually go for more budget friendly choices, so I do not have many comparisons. The experience was simply perfect, I could not imagine any room for improvement without going into sheer luxury (which the hotel can provide, e.g., by choosing an even better room).  A nice surprise was that I was accommodated in a room far more expensive and comfortable than the one I originally requested at no additional charge.  The staff is extremely helpful and polite, and several additional options are available (e.g., breakfast or dinner in the room) at very reasonable prices. Reasonable for somebody who is not into the whole luxury hotel thing, I mean.",5,2013,06,20
240,Excellent,"I stayed one night recently. The room was lovely, clean and very quiet. I had a fantastic night sleep and I have a bad back so am very sensitive to beds. Clean bathroom etc. I had breakfast, very tasty and plenty of choice. It was annoying to have to pay  extra to park the car, it should be built into the price of the hotel or not at all. I ate in the bar/restaurant, It was ok, plenty of food but not particularly tasty. Over all a very pleasant experience and I would love to stay again at the right price.",5,2013,06,12
240,Another great Hilton,"Had the opportunity to stay at the Hilton Kilmainhan on our recent trip to Ireland.  The hotel was very nice, a large room and very comfortable beds.  The staff were friendly and helpful, and the restaurant was good.  A hotel I would certainly recommend for Dublin.",5,2013,06,10
240,Brilliant !,"Love this hotel, me and my wife visit every year for our anniversary. Excellent service, lovely pool and brilliant staff.

Only negative is the price.

Food is restaurant is outstanding and a nice treat for a meal. Breakfast is also great and the hotel has an excellent location. Don't go to the pub over the road, ¬£20 for 2 cheese toasties and 2 cokes.",5,2013,06,08
240,Hilton Kilmanham,"Stayed at this Hotel on 01.06.2013 as I was going to the forbidden fruit music festival at kilmanham.  Lovely modern hotel, furnished beautifully in room, free wifi and safe, good flat screen telly, polite and courteous staff, great selection at breakfast and balcony had great views.   I would definitely stay again - my only complaint is the road beside it so if you like to sleep with the window open you will hear traffic.    Forgot my togs so I can't comment on the pool, short walk to the Luas so convenient for public transport and the downstairs bar was nice to relax in with plenty of outdoor seating.",5,2013,06,06
240,Great staff and super rooms,Good value for a well located hotel just outside city centre. All city centre locations are close some within short taxi or bus trips. Rooms excellent and staff very attentive. Location means its nicely quiet at night.,4,2013,06,05
240,"Nice facility, friendly staff, with several problems during our stay.","The facility is superb. The pool/spa/workout area was the nicest I've ever seen outside of a boutique hotel. The location was very quiet at night. The staff was cheerful and helpful, overall. 

But the wireless access was complete unreliable while we were there, so I was forced to allow the phone to use roaming. Our toilet was not flushing well at all--we called it in twice but it never seemed to get fixed--and we ended up using the toilets in the workout area or lobby about half of the time. 

The housekeeping was inadequate, in a word. The carpet was filthy and never seemed to get vacuumed while we were there. The housekeeper put our toothbrushes into our dirty cups, I guess in order to clean...and then did not give us clean cups. Ick. The TV was left on. Clean towels were left on top of our wet clothes, so the towels became damp. (There was plenty of unoccupied space on the shelf for the towels.) Dirty, wet towel was left in the room--NOT OURS. Tea bags were not replaced every night; I had to get them myself off of the housekeeping cart, twice. 

One of my biggest complaints, however was that the tub was a nightmare to get in and out of--VERY HIGH SIDES, a low grab bar, and sharply sloped interior, slick tub floor. We are in our 50s but are both runners and very fit, yet it was downright scary to navigate the tub and shower without falling! DO NOT STAY HERE IF YOU NEED EASILY ACCESSIBLE TUB OR SHOWER.

Upon leaving, the front desk staffer offered us drinks, coffee, even a taxi as compensation, but we could not accept as we were catching the train out of town. 

Not sure if I would stay here again or not...",3,2013,06,04
240,Clean and quiet for bussiness,"Very convenient for a business trip, specially when visiting Amazon next door. Although it is a bit expensive for my taste, it could be your best closest option, specially if your company or Amazon will pay your expenses afterwards.",4,2013,06,04
240,A hotel of 2 Halves,"This hotel tries very hard, staff and customer service are outstanding, but the building lets this down. My nice and large room had the faults, air conditioning did not work, door lock to baclcony did not work, shower temperature was not stable.

I was also surprised all pillows were foam - no choice or hilton feather pillows

Tips to save money - you can use a Taste card and get 50% off food, and they have their own irish web site to book direct - much cheaper than Hilton.com",4,2013,06,04
240,Nice but expensive,"If you are touring Dublin, not going to use many hotel's amenities  and not spending much time in your room, this hotel is expensive.  There are a couple sight seeing tour locations, but the hotel is ~3 miles for downtown Dublin.",4,2013,05,29
240,"Comfortable, Clean but a little bit far from the center","Very comfortable modern hotel overlooking an historical monument. Great service, very good breakfast, very good value for money. Unfortunatly, this hotel is a little bit far from the city center.
Definitely an hotel to recommend for a business trip but try to allow enough time to reach your first meeting in the morning ....",4,2013,05,28
240,"Fantastic Room, peaceful location","We visited for two nights for a weekend in Dublin.  As a couple who do not drink (alot) we were happy to stay outside the city centre.  However the hotel is located across the road from Kilmainham Jail one of the top attractions and about a 15 minute stroll from the GUiness storehouse.  We purchased the 72hr freedom pass which included return transfers from the airport to Houston station, the station is about 20 minute walk from the hotel, so we reccommend a taxi from the airport if you have luggage or are unsure of the directions (10 euro).
The freedom pass then gives you 72 hrs to the hop on hop off tourist bus which picks up ust across the road from the hotel and takes you around all the city centre sights with live commentry which is great (we used this as our main transport in and out of the city centre and was a relaxing way to travel in and out - plus really cheap!)  A tip - if a bus arrives and its jam packed, if your in no rush then just wait for the next one (max 10 min wait) often the next one will be half empty and ou can pick your favourite seat.
Back to the hotel review - Dont be phased when you see teh exteria, the road around the hotel looks busy but once inside there is no traffic noise and its a fairly quiet road the majority of the time.  The reception area is lovely and the reception tem really fantastic and welcoming, very happy to make dinner reservations, call taxi's etc.  We upgraded our hotel room and had a fantastic (and large) walk out balcony  with table and two chairs, fantastic for a cup of coffee in the morning of glass of wine in the evening, the view of the road beneith was entertaining, we could see directly to the walls of Kilmainham Jail (now an attraction ...not a working jail) in the distance we could see the mountains and the guiness storehouse sky bar.  It really was lovely, and we were lucky enough to have sunshine.
The bed was huge and sooo cmfortable and the whole balcony wall is a window splashing light into the large room.  Tea/coffee/toiletries all a good standard.
We did use the spa area once, there is what looks like a well stocked gym (but we were lazy) and just relaxed in the spa area, sauna, steam, jacuzzi and hydro pool - fantastic after a busy day walking around Dublin.
Breakfast - great buffett, cooked, continental, everything you could ask for. The staff could have been a little more enthusiastic at breakfast, but it didnt spoil our experience.
We did go out to the Temple bar area one evening, the local buses (available frr of charge with the freedom pass run till 23:00 so you can use that, we taxi'd back after a ...few Guinesses at 8 euro after midnight we were quite happy.
The temple bar area was heaving..absolutely rammed full of people who even at 10pm were pretty drunk, as a couple we didnt feel like squeezing into the packed pbs (which we had visited in the day and had a lovely relaxed feel with live music - definately reccommend a quieter afternoon drink in the temple bar area if you like it more chilled)
We found a large pub The old storehouse, there was live music and lots ofseating, managed to get a table upstairs and enjoy the relaxed atmosphere, definately reccommend this place if you want somewhere more relaxed

Definately reccommend Kilmainham Hilton, it was relaxed, welcoming, clean, chilled, everything you could ask for..thank you for a lovely stay!",5,2013,05,28
240,long weekend in dublin,"excellent accomodation with excellent facilities. The spa was complimentary, so we relaxed in the evening by the pool and in the sauna! there was fantastic customer service including helpful advice on where to visit. The breakfast was delicious ranging from all different foods such as hams and cheeses, granola, fresh fruit, full english and pastries. Although it was a bit of a hassle getting from the centre of dublin to the hotel, overall it was a fantastic and worthwile visit.",5,2013,05,27
240,Best beds ever!  Excellent service!,"We flew into Dublin and arrvied at 515am in the morning.  As soon as we checked in Eric at the front desk gave us coffee and rolls.  Then we got suggestions on what to see first in the wonderful city of Dublin!  This hotel was in walking distance of many things: Goal, Guiness Brewery, Phoenix park, Dublin's first Hospital, and some free national museums.  We also had the best sleep we have ever had on those Hilton beds.  We slept 15 hours and experienced no jet lag on day 2.   I would highly recommend this hotel!!",5,2013,05,26
240,Great service !,"I have stayed here twice now - once while travelling alone en route to a wedding in Galway and more recently en route from Canada to Spain with my husband. The main reason for staying here again was the exceptional service given by the staff on my first stay - and we were not disappointed the second time around either. The location is not exactly central but there are convenient bus stops ( hop on hop off as well as LUAS and DART lines) right at the door and getting around Dublin from this locale is a breeze.  We liked the somewhat quiet location opposite the Goal ( visit if you have time !) - if you want to be right in the midst of Dublin's pub scene then this is not the place for you. The hotel has all the amenities and comforts of a Hilton including a rather awesome Spa ( I made use of the awesome spa pool on both trips). We also both enjoyed the different lounges , caf√© and full service restaurant - really good value for the somewhat high prices but the food is a good example of the accomplished Irish culinary scene - and the wait staff are amazing. I had a room with a brokenTV on my first stay - which was not able to get fixed or repaired till the next day - but for that I got an upgraded room on my return from Galway ( I stayed another 2 days ). There are rooms that are a bit smallish and others that are more spacious - I believe there was a relatively minor price difference. I requested a spacious room upon booking the 2nd time and was not disappointed. Front desk staff were amazing - they were exceptionally well informed at a most detailed level about how to get around Dublin, what to see , where to eat, even schedules and rates of taxi fares. In fact the ability to arrange for transport to different events and finally to the airport made us feel like very valued guests indeed. Would definitely recommend this hotel if you are looking for comfort and reliability in standards ( and by the way we were granted early check in and late check out on both trips).",4,2013,05,22
240,Great stay for a family,"Would recommend this hotel to any family going to Dublin.  We arrived early in the day and were able to check in early.  This was an unexpected surprise and was the beginning of a wonderful service focus stay.  Staff was helpful across the board.  When we were getting different denominations of Euros together for our 11 year old daughter's school presentation, a staff member at the front desk helped us out by getting some smaller amounts from her own bag.  One day we needed help printing tour information at the business center and the front desk was there with a smile and assisted.
We found the restaurant to be very convenient.  We ate a big breakfast and that sustained us until dinner.  There was a great variety, which is key with a child.  I found it worth the cost.  Staff here was excellent as well.  They chatted with us about our visit to Ireland and gave us some tips on things to check out.
We stayed in a Family View room, which overlooked the Kilmainham Gaol.  We would enjoy a cup of tea on the balcony and just look out at this historic place, with the mountains in the distance, and enjoy the moment.  Room was huge.  Refrigerator in the room was wonderful too.
The Hop on Hop Off bus stop being at the Gaol made touring and getting around so easy too.
We were so pleased with our stay here and cannot say enough about how wonderful it was.",5,2013,05,21
240,Good customer service,"My wife and I stayed in the Hilton for two nights. We were attending the Heineken Rugby Cup Final in the Aviva Stadium. We usually stay in the Hilton in Charlemont Place but it was fully booked. Although we were further from the venue and the centre of Dublin, it was not an issue. We used the LURAS and the DART to get to the venue. Coming back we used the DART and a taxi, which was not that expensive.

Our room was very pleasant but we had an issue with the air condition which did not work. We brought this to the attention of the reception staff the next morning. They immediately responded by offering to get the maintenance team to fix the problem or move us to another room. On our return to the hotel that evening, our baggage had been moved to another room with working air-conditioning. We were also given a voucher for tea and scones and a reduction on the car park charge.

At breakfast on the first morning we were surprised at the number of very large men at breakfast. We learned that the Toulon Rugby Club, who one of the finalists in the Heineken Cup, were staying in the hotel with the WAGS and club officials. Despite the large number of guests the restaurant was run very efficiently. We found all the staff very professional and friendly.

If we stay in Dublin again we will differently consider the Hilton.",5,2013,05,21
240,Very high standard. Amazing staff,Recently returned to the Us after our stay. Very happy. James at reception very welcoming and helpful. Rooms of high standard and clean. Food was excellent but our waitress Jennifer stole the show. So attentive and helpful. Made us feel so Valued and made us laugh. Would definitely return again.,5,2013,05,20
240,Gem of a Hotel,"Excellent Hotel in a great location, close to bus stops and city centre. Great Food, service, spa. Highly recommended. A home from home Hotel with very helpful and super efficient staff. Situated in a quiet location. You would not think you were in the middle of Dublin City.",5,2013,05,19
240,Hilton Dublin Kilmainham,"Spent two nights here. The hotel, staff, room and facilities were all very good. The location was quiet, and only a short walk from the LUAS Red Line, which will have you in Dublin City Centre in about 15 minutes or less.",4,2013,05,15
240,Nice hotel,"My wife and I stayed there for 3 nights this spring. We were in a standard room, decent size. Everything in the room was working properly, though the slippers were on request. The hotel was very clean and quiet, in a peaceful neighborhood. Even though it is not at the very center of the city it is not far away, a half an hour walk through Royal Hospital Kilmainham and its park and than along the river. Several attractions are nearby - Kilmainham Gaol Museum, Phoenix Park, Museum of Modern Art. The breakfast was great, and both restaurant and bar had a good selection of menus for a fair price.",4,2013,05,15
240,Would stay again:,Had a few minor issues with our stay - fridge didnt work in the room (the staff sorted this within an hour). Also bought swimming hats to use the pool and when we went down to the pool no one else was wearing them and the last small issue was the toaster at breakfast didnt really work. But we did enjoy our stay at this hotel - staff very friendly and helpful. Food was lovely. Hotel was very clean in a great location. We took our son to the zoo (which is only 10 mins away) - would stay here again.,4,2013,05,13
240,Excellent Stay will be returning,This was my 2nd stay at the Hilton in Kilmainham and will be coming back again and again. The staff are excellent and welcoming. Its a home away from home. The rooms are spotless and the facilities are next to none. This was a business trip and will be recommending to both colleagues and friends alike. Cant wait for my next stay.,5,2013,05,13
240,Good location; nice rooms; safe; well maintained,"My aunt and I stayed 3 nights here while in Ireland last week.  Rooms were clean and comfortable.  Bathrooms were large and had all the American amenities like washcloths and nice cosmetics for the hair.  Staff was friendly.  Good breakfast - lots of choices.  Right across the street from the Gaol which is a nice feature if you arrive early in the morning from the USA and are looking for something to do.  Nice pub about a 5 minute walk away and a service station with snacks, drinks across the street as well.  I would definitely stay here again.  It was very quiet and well maintained.",5,2013,05,10
240,great location,"stayed here the night before a race in the phoenix park on a dinner bed and breakfast deal on Lidl breaks Noise from a fan/air conditioning system caused disturbance to sleep food was lovely, great breakfast, staff very helpful",4,2013,05,09
240,Excellent service,"This is a hotel which will not disappoint as long as the staff maintain the level of service we experienced on a weekend break. Reception, bar and restaurant were friendly and efficient in equal measure. Dinner was very good and breakfast at the top end of hotel buffet offerings. The freshly squeezed orange juice poured by he smiling waiter/ maitre d'(?) as we were being seated was particularly welcome. Location is very handy for Kilmainham Jail and the Irish Museum of Modern Art. LUAS is a manageable walk and opens up the whole of Dublin. Hope to return soon.",5,2013,05,08
240,Going downhill,"I used to stay at the Hilton in Kilmainham regularly on business trips (up to 2-3 times per week). Over the course of the last couple of years, the standard at the hotel has dropped slightly. While it is still a good hotel, the attention to detail is lacking slightly. Niggly things like broken bits in bathrooms, TVs that are starting to lose their picture significantly, etc. It just needs more maintenance than it is getting or it would be in danger of losing its 4 stars. The main item which has irritated me is that the mini-bars have been removed. Room service is available, but isn't the same. The fridges are still there; they're just permanently locked. Overall, it is still a reasonable hotel, but the prices are still premium.",3,2013,05,08
240,Excellent location,Had a lovely stay at the Hilton recently but watch the check-in system especially if travelling with large groups. The deposit is divided and the cost taken of each persons room which leaves you out of pocket and having to ask your friends for the money back..ouch!,4,2013,05,05
240,Hilton Kilmainham,Cracking hotel. Directly facing the gaol which was the main reason for my trip!! Rooms were spotless and large with a fridge to store any drink. Spa pool was excellent and perfect for chilling before a night out. Location was good approximately 8 euro in a cab to temple bar. Went bed and breakfast and the food was great. Would definitely stay in this hotel again. ,5,2013,05,04
240,Not more than average,"Location (10 min from city centre), price, breakfast & rooms are ok, but from a Hilton I would have expected a bit more in terms of friendliness & service. It doesn't mean that the staff was unfriendly, but it could have been also the staff in a Holiday Inn.",3,2013,05,03
240,Hilton Hotel KilmainHam,"Fantastic hotel , great staff , nice food , we need more television viewing options in the room though  , nice , friendly and professional Taxi driver(Brian) who took me to the airport , i will definitely use this hotel again in future",4,2013,05,03
240,Good hotel,"Stayed here for two nights while visiting Dublin on business.  Was pretty happy overall with the hotel, the room was very quiet and bed was comfortable. Apparently Ireland has a big reputation with loud drunks coming back to their room and making a lot of noise, I didn't have any issues with that at all in this hotel.  Free breakfast and some chocolate in my room since I am Hhonors diamond.  The gym was pretty large and had all the equipment you need.  Only downside was the shower, they have one those fancy looking half shower doors, which means the entire floor gets wet.  Also the temperature on the shower cycled from scaling hot to lukewarm every 30 seconds.  Very annoying.",4,2013,05,02
240,"Not bad, a little expensive.",Stayed here for one night the day before Christmas eve last year.  Hotel is lovely and centrally located for thos who wish to explore Dublin City Centre and Kilmainham Gaol which is right across the road.  Felt the hotel a little overpriced.  Paid for bed and breakfast which was delivered to the room cold.  Ordered room service on the night which was ok.,3,2013,05,01
240,A 'Special' Hotel,"Big hotels often lose that 'special' touch but not the Hilton Kilmainham in Dublin! Ana and Paige on the front desk are both special, going that extra mile to keep the customers happy. Brian the cab man is particularly friendly, though we wondered if he ever went home as he seemed to appear at any time of the day, Stephen the night manager was a joy at 5.30am in the morning! Everyone including the maid who serviced our room was a delight. If you are looking for a big hotel on the outskirts of Dublin, away from the hsutle and bustle with gorgeous rooms, great food and that something 'special', then don't go past the friendly folk at The Hilton Dublin Kilmainham Hotel! Dawn Simpson Batemans Bay Australia.",5,2013,04,29
240,Great hotel,"We selected this hotel because of the high rating it has for sleep quality, as we stayed there the first night of our trip. It did not disappoint! Great sleep when we got in meant we were able to see more of Dublin. It is quite far from the centre of town, but a 7 minute walk to the Luas (tram) which costs ‚Ç¨2.00 into the centre. Breakfast was superb, and the staff were friendly, accommodating and pleasant. They happily stored our luggage for us all afternoon once we'd checked out.

I'm not able to compare it to other Hiltons. I also booked 4 months in advance for a big discount. I'm not sure I would be prepared to pay full price, but that speaks more to my budget than the quality of the hotel.",5,2013,04,28
240,Nice Hotel,"My husband and I stayed here for a night in Dublin. Location is fine as there are buses and tram nearby to take you into the city centre. The room was clean, modern and well equipped. Breakfast was great - good service and lots of choice. I would definitely stay here again, but would prefer to perhaps pay less for the room",4,2013,04,27
240,Great Dublin Stay,"Enjoyed the stay. It's on the outskirts of the City, but still really convenient for it. If you are driving - it is great as easy to access from the motorways and you can park there (fee) and get into and out of city by Taxi or Luas (metro) - latter is a 12 minute walk. Hueston Train Station is also 12 mins walk or a short taxi hop. Kilmainham Visitor Gaol is across the road and well worth a visit. Superb breakfast. Only dinner menu disappointed on choice.",5,2013,04,27
240,Mediocre and far from the action,"This is a standard Hilton hotel: neither great nor terrible. It's off the beaten track, and far from the action. There is absolutely nothing of interest in the area apart from the Kilmainham jail. There is pub across the road if you don't fancy a drink in the hotel's own bar which is best avoided. Appalling atmosphere and quite awful piped music. The service is OK, the staff are friendly. The rooms are average: my bed was far too soft and so didn't have a great night's sleep. I only stayed here because the hotel was organised for me as part of a meeting. I will not be returning. There are plenty of great hotels in Dublin at a similar price.",3,2013,04,27
240,Good,"Stayed here before and loved it ! First time was great but second time wasn't amazing as first! The room wasn't that great was very tiny compared to first stay here and rooms were both double rooms ! Also the pool was dissapontining this time! First time no complaints the gym people were lovely but on second stay here the guy at gym reception was horrible wouldn't let us in pool without a swimming cap and demanded two euro for one each and we had to give them back ? Two euro for a cap and don't get to keep it ? Also who's other heads had it been on ?? Also we had no cash on us and he refused to let us come back down and pay at later stage ! So no use of pool which is terrible as we could see kids in pool with long hair and no caps?? Hardly fair? 

Also the hotel bar is poor !! We waited 45 mins on food and we couldn't order for 25 mins as the waitress kept telling us she would be over in a few minutes! Also the bar wasn't even that busy yes it was Good Friday but it was overly crowded? Could tell people next to us were annoyed with service too as she walked out and said loudly about disgraceful service . Location is poor if u don't have a car as a lot of walking and not close to city centre ! ",4,2013,04,26
240,Fantastic breakaway once again,"I had previously stayed in this hotel quite a while ago and was very impressed with the hotels overall level of service and facilities available.On our arrival on the 13th April  we were met by Ana at reception and we both agreed  she was a credit and an asset to the hotel,she was very knowledgeable of the area and transport links nearby and handled the large volume of guests and their questions  at the desk in a truly remarkable fashion,there were a number of different nationalities all trying to get answers at one time and she handled all of these questions very well and accurately.Again i have to mention as per my previous review that the Spa is a gem in itself.We also ate at the restaurant on 2 occasions during the day and evening and would rank it up there with the best in terms of service and quality,our package included a breakfast which was very nice and well laid out.We noticed people who were not even residents coming into the hotel to have breakfast which i think speaks for itself.Well done keep it up The  Hilton Kilmainham.",5,2013,04,22
240,A bit far from the action but otherwise ok,"We stayed here for 1 night while going to a gig in vicar street. 

The location isn't great for the city centre but a (roughly) ‚Ç¨2.50 bus journey takes you to temple bar or as far as o'connell street. 

The room was nice (we booked late so could only get twin) and beds were very comfy. Had the best nights sleep for a long time!

The bathroom was good tho the shower is over the bath. Tho there was a major problem with the shower temperature. It kept changing from hot to cold while I was in it. Which was both uncomfortable and dangerous. (room 210)

I was disappointed that there was no ice machine in the hotel. Unusual in a 4*. But the minibar was empty so we were able to keep drinks cool in the fridge. 

Staff were very friendly. 

We had a drink in the bar when we returned and it was reasonable. But the bar area was freezing so we headed back to the room. 

We got this room on a super secret deal (didn't know what hotel we got til after we paid) and we weren't disappointed for the ¬£75 we paid. But we may have been if we'd paid full rate. Especially with the faulty shower. 

",4,2013,04,22
240,A Great Place To Stay.,This was the first stop on my 14 day coach tour bus vacation. It was right down the street from the Kilmainham Jail and close to the sightseeing bus tour that you could hop on and off of. The room was pretty large and had a queen size bed. The hotel is very modern looking. The bar area was large and there were plenty of comfy places to relax. The waiter was very helpful and he even gave me their receipt for an Irish Coffee that I took home with me. Thanks. The food was pretty good and had enough portions too. Lots of veggies for the Vegetarian too. The staff of the hotel was really nice and they even helped me when I forgot my international plug. They told me that the venting machine on one of the floors had one in it. I wasn't sure if it was a misunderstanding so I went to check and there it was. I was so amazed. I didn't see any other hotel with one in it. It saved my trip because I was able to plug in my camera and my cell phone for the whole trip. I really like this hotel. I would definately stay in it again.,4,2013,04,21
240,Clean,"Very clean... Clean enough to use bath.  Our room on the 5th floor was spacious enough for dinner in, with great views. This hotel has affordable rates, is minutes from the M50 route from the airport, and is a great jumping off spot for points west if you have a rental car. Staff is very friendly. The gaol (jail) across the street is a significant monument - we were told that in the 1920s you were nobody if you were not imprisoned there at some point. Also, a simple 10 euro cab ride o places like St. Stephens Green and Grafton Street.",5,2013,04,20
240,"Usual Hilton standard just off the usual tourist trail, so look for a deal!","This hotel offers the usual high standards expected,so let's concentrate on the location!
Facing the entrance is the historic Kilmainham Jail Experience, there could be a queue, so be prepared to wait.
 Look left and you have the castellated rear entrance to the beautiful grounds of  the Museum of Modern Art whose buildings and courtyard were the backdrop to many scenes in 'The Tudors' TV series.
Stroll through the MMA to the main entrance, keeping left takes you down to the taxi rank at Heuston Station where the LUAS (tram) will take you to Northside City centre , Busaras ,Connolly Station and the O2 Venue for about Euro 1.50. 
So a pleasant 10 minute walk and you have access to other sightseeing, why not visit Collins Barracks (just across the river) before getting the LUAS? 
Just ask reception for the nearest Hop on Hop off bus stop if you prefer that option.",4,2013,04,18
240,A great stay,"This is the 5th time I have stayed at this hotel. It is a warm and friendly hotel with welcoming staff. The facilities are second to none and the location is ideal with the city centre as well as for the likes of myself who took park in the Great Ireland run in Pheonix Park.   It is located within a 10 minute walk fro t Huston Rail station, Pheonix park and the Lues Rail system that takes you into the heart of Dublin City.  The Hotel is also situated across the road from the Kilmainhan Gaol which is a must see tour along with the Guinness tour of course.  One of the attractions for the hotel is the Living Well centre which has a well equipped gym and a fantastic swimming pool, steam room and Sauna. which are all free to patrons of the hotel.  Another great stay for me and I would highly recommend this Hotel.",5,2013,04,18
240,A Great Hotel,"I stayed in this hotel back in July 2012. This hotel is one of the few reasonably priced hotels in Dublin that can tick nearly all the boxes of other Dublin 5* hotels for half the price!- Free Wi-fi, On site car parking though chargeable still at a cheap rate, hudrotherpy pool still good though wont be swimming long lengths, sauna, steamroom, gym. Staff all very nice and I had breakfast and lunch every day in the hotel and it was good. Tour bus stops outside and is located beside Kilmainham jail.",5,2013,04,14
240,"It is Hilton, so, it is good","Stayed there two nights on a business trip to Dublin. It is not near city centre, so do not expect great time. Also, that part of the city is rough, although I would not say I felt insecure. Just requires smart behaviour.
ROOM: spacious, twin bed, regular amenities, business hotel style. It was clean. The staff was welcoming, but were not able to articulate their public transportation suggestions.
BREAKFAST: it was OK, all kinds of options, but quite a lot based on local customs and that means deep fried everything. But, one could find nice things, really.
I would stay there for business, if it is near, but would pick more central location for pleasure.
There is a wellness centre, but I did not visit it.",4,2013,04,14
240,Not great,"Hi, my wife and I had a night away here where we left our baby at home - as a treat. The location isnt too far from the Luas and the reception staff were nice but the good news stops there. We asked to book in for a meal in the restaurant - they couldnt so we went into the restaurant and they said they were fully booked and tried to send us away. We bumped into the duty manager by chance who said the restaurant wasnt busy at all, we ended up eating in the restaurant and it certainly was very poor. Having stayed for the night in the room with no air-conditioning we went to check out we saw there was no breakfast included which is ok but we were told it was ‚Ç¨12 for the night. to be honest I dont mind paying but it should say it up-front or have it included in the charge on booking. So all in all - the hotel is alright but not worth what we paid, the price was equal to B&B with free parking in better hotels in the locality. So all in all nice enough hotel with poor restaurant staff and a bit pricey for what you get",2,2013,04,11
240,tops at the hilton,"We stayed in the Hilton in early march, was excited about staying here until I read the reviews, turned out to be a wonderful hotel with helpful staff and warm cosy bedrooms, breakfast was very tasty and chowder in bar was amazing, Dinner in restaurant was presented very well and very enjoyable.  From the outside hotel doesn't look much but inside makes up.  There is a wonderful relaxing pool area, well worth a visit. Will be back.",4,2013,04,09
240,Nice and recommended,"Very nice hotel, the best if you have business in the area. This is a hotel that seems to be intented for business people, so I don't recommend it for families.

Maybe 5 stars is too much for the facilities, but with some improvements They can ""gain"" them easily.

== Pros ==

* The staff is very attentive and helpful.

* The rooms are nice and clean.

* Internet (WIFI) is (or at least it was for my case) complimentary.

* Food in the restaurant is good and not very expensive.

== Cons ==

* There were a lot of smarties under the bed, so They probably don't clean there usually.

* The SPA is somewhat neglected: some buttons for bubbles don't work and They need handles for some of the jets (you can't stand easily on them).

* Location: If your interest is the city centre is far (20 min by bus (~2,50‚Ç¨), 10 min by taxi (8-9‚Ç¨)). The area is not the best: there are not a lot of things around the hotel (e.g.: restaurants). My recommendation will be to put a shuttle to the Temple Bar and to the airport.",4,2013,04,09
240,great hotel,Stayed here for three night's in January. Very nice hotel in good location for kilmainham and Guinness storehouse and good transport links to city and Houston station. Good reception staff and good food. Would recommend.,4,2013,04,08
240,Hilton Quality on a quiet location,"We were in Dublin for a concert and booked a Suite at Hilton Kilmainham. We felt very welcome from when we checked in, and the staff was very helpful. The room was fantastic with a large walk-out balcony. The breakfast was really good and varied. 

The hotel is located 3-4 km outside the city centre, but it's in walking distance from the LUAS-tram station ""Suir Road"" (600m). It's located across the road from the famous jail Kilmainham Gaol, which is worth a visit, and it's only a 15-20 minutes walk from Guinness Storehouse.

A special mention to the very friendly concierge Brian who's knowledge of the city and sights was very helpful.",5,2013,04,08
240,excellent hotel!!!!,"Just back from a night stay with some friends and i cannot fault this hotel!!it was perfect and the staff were so friendly,nothing was too much trouble.the food was beautiful and excellently presented..the rooms were spotless and the beds were unbelievably comfortable..i will most definitly  be back.as for others commenting about distance from the city center there is a bus stop that will bring you right into the city not far from the hotel at a cost of about 2euro...I really loved this hotel and have mentioned it to friends...hats off to the hilton..i loved it!!!",5,2013,04,08
240,much improved since my last visit,"my partner and i attended a Conference in September last, although i was anxious about staying there as my last visit wasn't such a good experience.  There was a huge difference this time, firstly without requesting we were upgraded to a suite which was fab. Breakfast which was a big issue when we last stayed here was awesome, lots of fresh food and the service was spot on. Overall we had a totally different experience and i would recommend the Hilton Dublin Kilmainham.",4,2013,04,08
240,Great city stay,"I was very pleased with our 1 night stay here. I was travelling with 2 children and the hotel was the perfect place for a peaceful stay. We came by car and found the hotel easily and liked the underground parking - straight up in the lift to reception - very easy.  Staff were efficient and friendly. We ate in the bar and had a good meal. Our family room was excellent - plenty of space for the children and everything was clean and good quality. The view of the gaol directly across the road and the mountains beyond was a real plus for a city hotel.
Enjoyed breakfast there was a good selection, and my youngest girl was very impressed when she was offered hot chocolate as an alternative to tea or coffee ! 
Would go back if I was staying in Dublin.",5,2013,04,08
240,Very mixed bag for a Hilton,"Booked this venue for a business conference.

The location is near a number of Dublin tourist attractions such as Kilmainham Gaol and the Modern Art Museum in the Royal Hospital.  You would imagine that it is a great location, but it is actually stranded in a place that is very trickly to reach on public transport, and is not a pleasant walk from town.

The food was poor, and we complained on day 1, but it took until day 3 to get it right.  Some very strange soups were served to us, eau de dishwater!

For any other hotel I might not be so harsh with my overall score, but you expect flawless service from a Hilton, and that is not what we got.",3,2013,04,08
240,Top class service with a smile .Ask for Aga she was first class and really nice.,We were thrilled with our stay we had a wonderful time in a peaceful setting .The front desk(Aga) were so helpful.We got great advice and directions for where we wanted to go .The Hotel is clean comfortable and in a great location.The only thing I would say that could be done to improve is a mineral machine in the lobby with water and water in the rooms.,5,2013,04,06
240,Quality Hilton experience,"Spent 4 nights at the Hilton Kilmainham from Easter Monday. Rooms 318 and 320. Both rooms were not ready on arrival but we were offered complimentary drinks while we waited. Efficient, friendly and courteous staff throughout stay. Wonderful breakfasts. Lovely leisure facilities. Worthy of note are the cleaner for our rooms - an excellent job throughout the week - and the checkout staff who arranged our taxi and takeaway breakfasts for our early morning departure. Thank you. A 10 Euro taxi ride to the city centre. Good trade off for some time away from the centre.",5,2013,04,05
240,Excellent Hotel,"Excellent hotel facilities, and even better staff, very friendly and helpful, really enjoyed the stay. Would highly recommend to anyone.  Correspondance with the hotel before arrival was very good-we came over as a celebration and they helped out with our requests. Rooms are spotless and balcony views are fabulous!",5,2013,04,04
240,Easter Break 2013,"This hotel was perfect! Really enjoyed the 3 night stay here as the facilities were clean and staff were helpful and friendly. Kilmainham Gaol is right across the road as well as the hop on hop off bus which gives you a great tour around Dublin.
Rooms were clean and spacious and we cannot fault this hotel, we would not stay anywhere else in Dublin.
Brian O'Reilly Corporate Taxi Service was great! A real gentleman who helped us with places to visit around Dublin and provided us with invaluable information. He is the go to man and his number is 086 605 6119. He will even provide you with a real Irish hug!!
Overall great experience.",5,2013,04,03
240,Top Class,"Stayed here for Easter weekend and it was very very good. Brian greeted everyone and helped to direct them around the city and in fact all the staff and management were very helpful. Can not fault this hotel, we would not stay anywhere else in Dublin.  B Walsh",5,2013,04,02
240,Great Hotel!,"This was our first hotel stop in our honeymoon through Ireland and it was a great one.  We arrived super early (around 8am) and the hotel was able to get us checked in and in our room right then which was a great surprise - allowed us to freshen up and unpack after flying overnight to get to our destination.  The staff was amazing here.  To get us started on our journey around Dublin, we had the pleasure of meeting with Brian O'Reilly who helps guide hotel guests and make recommendations based on what they want to do.  He was amazing!!!  He pointed out everything on our map, made recommendations on local transportation (hop on hop off green bus was a great recommendation - hits all the stops and provides great tour guide type info as well and the stop is right across from the hotel), and even gave us a great local eating recommendation for dinner.  He even helped guide us to our next destination before we started our drive across country.  Brian was the best - we definitely recommend talking with him.  As for the room, it was very nice and comfortable and gave us all the amenities we could ask for.  We had a great time in Dublin and the Hilton Kilmainham was a big part of that.  Thanks to all of the staff and especially Brian for making our honeymoon so special!",5,2013,04,02
240,"Excellent customer service, great beds, good location","Stayed for two nights, great service at reception, well informed staff. Stayed in a family room, great space, excellent beds, and very clean. Great location Kilmainham Gaol across the road, with hop on hop off stop to tour the rest of Dublin. Restaurant good standard, varied menu, good service, well priced. Brian O'Reilly Corporate Taxi Service absolutely outstanding, a real gem of an Irishmen, even received a true Irish hug!",4,2013,04,02
240,Beautiful food,"Recently stayed here for 1 night Saturday, we had a beautiful room, spacious and a really comfortable bed. We had a beautiful dinner in the restaurant with a steak that was cooked to perfection. The staff are all so friendly and helpful.  Breakfast was a mammoth affair and even included my husband‚Äôs latest craze homemade muffins... Yum Yum Lovely addition.  Only negative was the pay parking (but you are almost in the city however ‚Ç¨12.00 per night!) and the price of the bottles of wine in the restaurant at an average of ‚Ç¨28.00 a bottle ‚Äì maybe an addition of a slightly cheaper alternative... over all good nights break and will be back...",5,2013,04,02
240,Great!,Really enjoyed our stay here for one night. Very convenient for access to the city. The only problem was that on arrival in our room there was no hot water in the taps. Informed staff of this who stated they would rectify it while we were eating in the restaurant. Returned 2 hours later and the receptionist confirmed the hot water had been restored. Was disappointed that it was still cold when I checked again so we had to be moved to another room at around 10pm. Staff were apologetic but we expected the problem to be fixed when we first reported it. Everything else about the hotel was fine. Breakfast the next day was delicious with a great selection. Cant fault the hotel for anything else staff were extremely helpful and friendly. Thanks,4,2013,04,02
240,Perfect hotel for a good night rest after a long day of sightseeing.,"The hotel is perfect nothing to fault. Checkin was 2 minutes. The room that we got was as you see on the photos of the hotel rooms on tripadvisor. King size bed, fridge, wine glasses, the usual tea and coffee stuff. We got free Wifi. Helped us with the roaming 3G charges. The only small problem is 3 miles out from the city centre. A bit of a trek on foot after a long day of sightseeing. Lol. 

Didn't have dinner here as we wanted to try he Italian across the road. (Which was a bad mistake) lol. Avoid at all cost. The food at the hotel are reasonable price and drinks are also what you will pay for in a hotel.

All in all, we are very pleased with the hotel and will recommand it.",4,2013,04,01
240,Perfect for access via hop on hop off,"Stayed for 2 days, tourist from the US. Appreciated the closeness to a hop-on hop-off bus stop.
Cannot praise the staff enough - incredibly helpful in all aspects. From check in, to concierge (especially Brian!), to bartender service (Adam was great!) all exceeded expectations.
Rooms were typical for a Hilton - what we were expecting which was a good thing.
For roughly 6 euro three of us were able to hop on a bus and go down to Temple Bar to have a great time. Even the people on the bus were incredibly friendly.
Would definitely stay here again!",5,2013,03,30
240,Disappointing,"Actually a very mediocre Hilton if not say this is not Hilton-standard: empty minibar, staff is not able to call you a taxi, breakfast-staff extremly unfriendly, bar closes 11pm. Rooms are ok, but nothing special. Location is ok, but not very central.",3,2013,03,28
240,Good functional business hotel,"I really enjoyed my stay at the Hilton in Kilmainham, the hotel was located very close to my office. The rooms are nice, clean with comfortable furnishings. I would not recommend this hotel for leisure travellers as it is not near the city centre and is located close to Kilmainham Jail. If you are looking for a good business class hotel I would look no further than the Hilton. Great service at the check in, always available for assistance no problems calling taxis or making bookings and a good breakfast. There is a nice little restaurant called the lime tree cafe and a spar close by where you could by groceries/sandwiches. If you want to go out to in the city for example the Temple Bar area you would need to take a taxi. Overall I had a great stay and would return as a guest.",4,2013,03,27
240,weekend break,"My friend and i enjoyed 2 nights here.Took us ages to get there from airport then realised there was a direct bus to city centre.Food good , pool small but good to relax in. Room was very comfortable - beds very comfy , bathroom - lovely was a wet room",5,2013,03,26
240,Decent Hotel,"The hotel is surrounded by different tourist attactions.  We have spent the morning to visit the Phoenix Park, and the famous Kilmainham Gaol Museum. A pity that the Irish Museum of Modern Art was under renovation. Hop on and Hop off tourist bus is just outisde the hotel and the Guinness Storehouse is 5 mins away.  The room is big and with all 4 stars facilities, what's more, they provide PeterThomasRoth bath amenity.  The breakfast is good and the car park is charged 12 euro per night.",4,2013,03,26
240,"Good hotel, but out of the way","Overall, I enjoyed my stay at this hotel.  The staff was friendly, the room was comfortable, and neighborhood nice.  I did have a few issues during my stay.  The USA electric outlet in my room was broken and I had to pay for an Irish converter.  The neighborhood was nice there was only one resturant within walking distance.  There were also no sights or attractions, other than Kilmainham Goal, nearby either.  However, there was a Hop On-Hop Off bus stop across the street from the hotel which was nice.  The good about the hotel outweigh the bad and I would stay here again and recommend it to others.",4,2013,03,25
240,Excellent Staff and Hotel,"We stayed during St. Patricks Day weekend.  Service, Staff and everything was outstanding.  Hotel is next to a major tourist destination, but away from the crowded down town area and temple street.
One Employee that stood out was Brian O'Reilly. He was always available and extremely helpful in providing advise and booking events.  He was 100% right on with all his advise and we had a wonderful time.  Would definitely recommend to others.  Definitely reach out for Brian with questions!",5,2013,03,24
240,Wonderful hotel!!!,We stayed here at the end of our tour and it was an awesome place to stay. The rooms were huge and beautiful. Wonderful breakfast and facilities. The only downside was some of the bar staff were rude. ,5,2013,03,23
240,Great hotel!,"Hotel staff was so very kind, friendly, and helpful! Hotel just as pictured on booking.com.  A short taxi or bus ride from the city center.  Would stay there again!!!!   Was located right across the street from the Kilmainham Gaol (prison) and also a nice local Pub across the street. We stayed there on St. Paddy's weekend and it was nice to be able to get away from all the crowds! Breakfast was very nice!!! Also Brian O'Reilly that is a cab driver but also serves as a non-official concierge was SO SO SO amazing in recommending a great restaurant that I will forever remember!! He made sure we had a nice table and were treated wonderfully!  He is great!",5,2013,03,23
240,St Patricks Day Gem,"I just got back from Ireland where I stayed at the Hilton Dublin Kilmainham.  My stay there was excellent and the staff was wonderful. However I must bring to light one individual who stood above the rest ( I mean above the rest of all the employees I have ever met working for Hilton).  His name was Bryan, not only was he the most motivated Hilton employee I have ever met he was also the most helpful.  It was obvious Bryan loved his job but loved people more.  Not a day went by without Bryan checking in on us to see if we were doing OK. On the first day he sat down with me and listed all the sites I should go see that worked into the time frame I was in Dublin.  He told me the best locations, times to be there and how to get there (in detail).  It was obvious that as an Irishman Bryan was proud of his Country and the City of Dublin and wanted to make sure my family and friends left experiencing all that Dublin had to offer.  Bottom line is that Bryan is a keeper and if you can figure out a way to reproduce him and put him in all your hotels do it now!  Thanks so much for taking care of me and my family at your hotel but please take the time to have someone reach out to the Hilton Dublin Kilmainham and thank Bryan for representing your Hotel with pride, professionalism, and most of all friendship.

Thanks again

Rico and Yamila",5,2013,03,22
240,Excellent stay!,"We stayed at this Hilton for St Patricks Day weekend and weren't disappointed. Although it is a short cab ride away from the city centre it was well worth it to be able to get away from the craziness of Temple Street. Check in & out was swift & pleasant with very courteous staff. It was wonderful to get wi-fi connection passes for all our devices upon check in. We stayed in a room with a king bed for me & my husband & a single for our teenage son. It was a bit cramped in the room, but the single bed they brought in for my son was a proper & comfortable bed. The pillows were not to anyones liking so I think they need to change them out. They had apparently recently bought new bath linens and unfortunately, there was a lot of lint shedding from them but we found it better than having old or stained towels. The water pressure was great, as were the rain shower heads. Breakfast was a wonderful spread, very organized, and attentive & courteous staff. The hotel travel concierge was very friendly and helpful. It was cheaper to use the hotel van for transportation to & from the airport than to pick a taxi up at the airport! There are always taxi's lined up in front of the hotel which made it very convenient to get around. The jail (Kilmainham Goul) is right across the street from the hotel :) Also the streets around the Hilton have nice pubs. One evening we decided to eat at the hotel & then go to a pub for a beer & the food in the hotel was wonderful. I had a chicken burger & the others had the Godfather burger, good stuff!!

240,Hilton heaven,"Stayed here on paddys  night , booked a  bed breakfast and dinner package and got a fantastic rate. Check in was swift and the girl on duty was wonderful, very helpful and friendly.

our room was on the 3rd floor. Large room with everything you would expect from a Hilton hotel .the bathroom was really nice and the toiletries were an added bonus. The bed was huge and so warm and comfy  

We booked a table in the restaurant for 8pm  I was surprised at how quite it was. Dinner was soup to start followed by supreme of chicken with potatoes and veg. The food was nice but very scarce on potato and veg, not what you need after been in the city all day at the parade. But been honest the potatoes were cold and lumpy . They were left on the plate. 

Breakfast the following  morning was lovely .self service and everything you could want was there .  My only negative was we came down at 10.40 for breakfast and there was alot of hot food left ,which was cleared away after 11, was this food wasted . Surely in this economic climate where hotels aren't very busy . Made to order breakfasts would be more cost 

There was free wi-fi at the hotel which was great and 12.00‚Ç¨ to park for the  night .
Overall great stay would come back

240,Fantastic friendly hotel.,"Stayed here in March for 2 nights with some friends.
 Staff very friendly and happy to help. Rooms were beautiful with a choice of a bath or shower which were powerful and constantly hot. 
Breakfast at the weekends could be taken up to 11am and the variety if food was fantastic.
Brian the hotels taxi driver was a true gent and offered very reasonable fares to and from the airport/ town  as well as doing day excursions. Please be aware that although the majority of the Irish taxi drivers are fantastic, 1 in particular seriously overcharged us from the airport to the hotel on arrival. My advice would be to ring the hotel and pre book Brian to meet you at the airport (You should not be paying more than  35 euros to the hotel). 
I would definitely stay at this hotel again.",5,2013,03,18
240,Very friendly hotel,"Thank you for a lovely stay , breakfast lovely , stayed for two nights for our friends  40th birthday !!! Met lovely friendly Brian he is brill  , takes us into the town and took us to the airport !!! Lovely hug at the end of it .",5,2013,03,18
240,"Great Service, Great room, great everything","I stayed for one night at the Dublin Kilmainham while on a business trip. I was very impressed with the hotel. There's not much I have to say wrong about it. The room I stayed in was large and very clean, big bed, decent bathroom, good TV. My only compaint was that internet via ethernet cable was not working, but that was easily resolved using some wi-fi guest passwords. The duty manager also wanted to offer me some complimentary drinks because of this inconvenience, but since i wanted to go out that evening., i respectfully declined.
In the room you also get an electric heater to provide extra heat if you need it.",4,2013,03,18
240,Clean and Very Modern,Stayed one night in this modern and exceptionally clean hotel.  Had a quick dinner in the lounge and was served by a very friendly waitress. Staff accommodated us with an early continental breakfast so that we could leave to catch our flight.,5,2013,03,16
240,lovely hotel,We stayed here in Feb 2013 for the weekend.  We had a meal in the bar it was lovely food was really good.  The staff were very friendly.  The heat was not working in our bedroom so the night manager upgraded us to another room he was really helpful and cheerful even though he should have finished working 2 hours before.  The rooms are spacious and very well set out.  The breakfast was great with lots of variety something for everyone.  The porridge was very good.,5,2013,03,16
240,Good hotel for business - what you'd expect,"Stayed here for one night on business. I was really tired so ate room service for dinner, which was good quality food and the menu choice was good. Its what you'd expect from a Hilton - good size room, nice bed, friendly staff etc. BUT nothing more. It's fine!",4,2013,03,14
240,"Hotel was fine, disappointed in Hilton","My husband and I stayed here recently for two nights.  The hotel itself was fine, but expensive for the location.  The size of the room and bathroom was nice and the free wifi was appreciated.  The late night room service menu was limited, but the food was good.  The staff at the hotel was very nice.  The location is on the outskirts of Dublin and not very close to most of the attractions.  This hotel is directly across from the Kilmainham jail and near Phoenix Park so that was convenient, but other than those locations you will need to take a taxi or bus.  Overall the hotel was fine, but when we return to Dublin we will be staying closer to the city center.  On another note, my disappoint with Hilton stemmed from not being able to change our reservation.  I did book an advance purchase rate on Hilton.com and came to find out this rate is non-refundable and you cannot change the dates.  My fault for not reading the fine print.  We unfortunately had a death in the family and wanted to push the dates back two weeks and actually add another night on to the stay.  I spoke with corporate Hilton who informed me there is nothing they could do to assist, but make a request to the hotel.  Since it is an international hotel, the hotel would have to make the decision if they would honor my request.  I spoke to the hotel a couple days before my planned trip and was told that they would not be able to resell the room so I could not change my dates.  I understand I booked the rate, but being a Hilton Honors member for over 10 years that has frequently stayed at Hilton hotels this was disappointing.  As I mentioned to the hotel, there have been several insistences when staying at a Hilton hotel things have gone wrong and I have been understanding, unfortunately that was not the case when the tables are turned.",3,2013,03,13
240,Luxury Hotel,"Not too far from the phoenix park, the hotel is modern, stylish and a good base to explore Dublin from the outskirts of the city. there is on site car parking and the breakfast is really good. we ordered an evening meal through room service and the food was first rate, and it worked out at a very reasonable price. the staff were very helpful with directions to places of interest and overall we had a very pleasant stay.",4,2013,03,10
240,Excellent Hotel.,"My partner and I recently stayed at the hotel for two nights. The overall experience was exactly what we were looking for. The staff at the hotel were curtious and friendly, particularly Brian, who sat down with us and gave us lots of information to make our trip worthwhile. The rooms were spacious and well kept. We made good use of the facilities and the free wifi was very useful.
Overall we both enjoyed our stay and would thoroughly recommend the hotel to anyone wishing to stay in Dublin.",5,2013,03,03
240,Not up to my expectations of a Hilton,"Quite far from the airport and no shuttle.  Also, far from city center & attractions.  Nearest public tram was about 2 km walk.
But my biggest complaint was the front desk staff.  Hubby and I were repeatedly called sirs (note multiple male title) by english speaking clerk.  As it was Valentine's Day, we had a bottle of wine with us.  The fridge in the room didn't work - yes we checked the plug.  I called the desk for service.  And was told they'd take care of it.  An hour later, on the way out to dinner, I stopped at the desk and was told that none of the fridges work in the whole hotel.  I asked why I wasn't told that an hour ago and fussed about chilling my wine.  They said they'd have an ice bucket and a portable fridge  brought up. Back from dinner, no fridge, no ice bucket.  Another call.  Sorry we'll have it right up.   Another hour and a call asking for the manager, told he was on his way up with the fridge.  Yes, he came, empty handed.  And when I asked where was the fridge &/or ice, he looked at me like I was a crazy person.  I told him about the stories I was getting from the front desk and he just looked incredulous and asked what kind of hotel would have all the fridges on the blink.  I agreed, it sounded pretty stupid to me.  Said he'd talk to the front desk girls.  He climbed under the counter and found a switch that had been turned off.  Viola, working fridge, but still no ice after 10PM and no mood now even if we had cold wine.  So much for our romantic plans.  At check out I was asked if  enjoyed my stay and had to say no and explain why not.  Got the day manager, her response, they offered my a drink.  Why would I want a drink at 10AM when i'm headed out for a tour????
By far the worst Hilton I've ever stayed in.  We've lived in Hiltons for extended periods during moves, I expect better.",3,2013,03,03
240,A great quality hotel - albeit a short trek from city center,"My husband and I started our Ireland vacation at the Hilton Kilmainham.  We flew in on the overnight flight from JFK and landed just before 9 on a Saturday morning.  Customs was quick and easy and we walked outside of the terminal to catch the 747 Airlink bus.  After about a 10 minute wait at the clearly marked stop, the bus arrived.

We had purchased the 3 day Freedom Pass that included the 747 as well as the green hop on hop off buses and any other city buses.  While I never did a detailed analysis of cost vs. value it was really convenient to be able to get on almost any bus at any point in time without having to have proper change, etc - I highly recommend it.

Back to the hotel...  We took the 747 to Heuston Station as I read others had.  We got off at Heuston Station, walked through the station and down the street to the right.  We got confused with where to walk and ended up turning left down the lane that goes to the Museum of Modern Art Museum thinking it was our road (it's not).  It ended up being a nice little short cut as we walked through the property (including the building) and park on the other side.  We came out right across from the hotel.  At this point I had been up since early the prior morning and hadn't showered since so I was tired and SO looking forward to a shower.  We entered the lobby of the hotel where everyone was very nice.  Thankfully we were able to check in that early and I got the shower and nap I so needed.  I thought for sure we'd charge ahead through that first day but we couldn't hack it and slept most of the day instead.  For the record, unless you are familiar with Dublin I highly recommend taking a cab from Heuston Station to the hotel - it's a good investment, especially after a long trip.

Room....We were in room 530 which was on the top level and included a balcony with a view of the gaol.  The room was clean, comfortable and included a mini fridge that we used to store extra beverages that we purchased at the TOPAZ gas station just south of the hotel.  The room also had a handicap shower set-up that the folks who checked us in warned us of in advance.  It is different but wasn't a problem - the view is well worth it.  We asked for an extra bath mat to prevent extra water from getting on the bathroom floor after our first shower.  You'll know what I mean if you end up in one of these rooms.  Bath products were Peter Thomas Roth and are great.  The room included an american style outlet to charge your phone, tablet, etc.  That said, I encourage you to buy an adapter if you are staying at other hotels along the way.

Location....  The hotel is in a quieter neighborhood west of the city center.  Because the gaol is just across the street the hop on hop off buses stop just down the street 100 feet or so.  The Dublin buses stop nearby too.  Just head south past the TOPAZ station and turn right at what I think is the next corner (there's a pizza shop on the corner and you can see the bus stop shelters not far down the street).  Take bus 13 or 40 to the city center.  We learned quickly that the buses may not stop if you down wave them down as they are approaching.  No biggie, just toss out a hand and you'll have a ride - assuming you have a bus pass of some sort or proper change.  Again, I highly recommend the freedom pass.  The trip into the city center is pretty quick and you'll soon be in the Temple Bar area. 

Restuarant... We had dessert and drinks in the hotel bar on our first night after getting dinner in the Temple Bar area.  Service was good and the dessert was awesome.  There was a solid selection of beer and wine.  We had dinner here the second night and both enjoyed great meals then too.  It's nice to have a comfortable, dependable home base to return to for meals or cocktails before heading up to the room and the hotel/restaurant was just that for us.

For my husband and I this property was perfect.  I'm a bit thrifty but want comfort and cleanliness and he doesn't like the crowds of a major metropolitan area.  This hotel met all of those requirements with a dependable transport system to get us into the action during the day.",5,2013,03,03
240,"Great location, immaculate hotel, good value and very friendly service.","My friend and I thoroughly enjoyed our one-night stay here.  The room was immaculate and very comfortable, with excellent facilities.  The staff were warm and welcoming.  We had dinner and breakfast in the dining room and the food was generally of a very high standard.  We booked on the hotel web-site and got a reasonably good deal.  It's a great location as there are several nearby tourist attractions, including Kilmainham Jail and the Museum of Modern Art.",4,2013,03,02
240,Disappointed,"Lets start with good points:

- quick check in
- Nice rooms
- Newspapers every morning
- good breakfast
- Free wifi at hilton is very rear !!

NOT that good:

- Hotel suppose to be 100% non smoking however we experianced strong smell once we enter our room
-Far a way from city centre and airport.(Paid 30e from the airport)

-Room service staff with big attitude.When we wanted to make an order it sounded like they are doing it big favour.we order bottle of wine.No one bother to open it. Then chicken ceaser salad (lettuce and chicken nothing else) and tasteless 2x chicken corma.bill 66 euros.

- quite small and overcrowded gym. I guess not all of the people was hotel guests

Would go for Hilton dublin city next time.",2,2013,03,01
240,excellent 2 day break,"lovely big and stylish room with king bed, excellent breakfast each morning with tremendous selection of hot and cold food catering for every taste. location is 2 and a half miles from dublin centre but easily reached by hop on hop off bus or public bus or taxi. Best bit of the hotel was the hydrotherapy pool - warmest pool i have ever been in - an absolute pleasure to relax in. only downside is that some staff insist on bathers wearing either shower caps or swimming caps in the pool but other pool staff don't bother - which is annoying for the people who have been told to go and get a shower cap or pay 2 euros to buy one only to see other swimmers not wearing a cap. I am always happy to comply with a rule if it is sensible and enforceable but i think this particular rule needs some re-thinking.",5,2013,02,26
240,Not bad,"I stayed here as part of a conference 2 weeks ago. The business centre is very good and the conference centre is very well equipped. The food and service was also very good and the staff were very helpful. However the room was a little disappointing. The bathroom sink had no hot water. And the bath could not be plugged. I mentioned this on check out and was fobbe off with a "" Oh Sorry"". Overall though it wasn't a bad experience.",3,2013,02,26
240,Great stay at the Hilton kilmainham,We stayed at the Hilton Kilmainham overnight at the weekend. The hotel is near the luas into the city centre. From the minute we arrived everything was great from the secured carpark to the checkin (which was very smooth and welcoming) to the comfortable rooms. We dined in the restaurant as part of our booking plan and could not fault the selection or quality of the food on the set menu. Our experience was very enjoyable and I plan to return again.,5,2013,02,25
240,Comfortable Stay,We stayed for two nights in this hotel. The rooms were lovely however I had a couple of issues with the food. On our first night we decided to eat at the bar. I ordered stuffed pasta in a basil pesto. The pesto sauce had seperated into oil and bits of chopped up basal however leaving my pasta completely tasteless except for the ricotta filling and the bit of cheese grated on top. We had breakfast in the dining room the following morning which was lovely but ordered room service for breakfast the following morning. None of the items we had ordered came. I had asked for a poached egg and bacon and my partner had also selected only a few items from the list. Instead we got two standard full Irish breakfasts which was a complete waste of food as we hadn't wanted half of it.,3,2013,02,25
240,2nd visit,"This is the second time that we have stayed here. The price is fair and the service is great. We paid everything out front and checked out without any hidden bills as some people have stated. A Huge Thank you to Brian O'reilly--The Corporate Taxi Service----He was always in form and had great recommendations. +353 86 605 6119  
 Breakfast had everything you could think of, being American and my Girlfriend French, should give you an example of how diverse it is. The Bar is also very nice. Considering the prices that Temple Bar charge, the Hilton is very fair. The Room was very spacious, only one downfall: we where in room 318 next to the main street. Every time an Emergency vehicle passed by, you heard the sirens which woke us up a few times. Recommend putting in Double Sided Glass on this side of the Building. Enjoy your stay !!! We will def be back :-) Donald and Celia",4,2013,02,25
240,Nice Hotel,"Booked this hotel as I was doing business in Dublin and both my wife and little girl were coming also with me. It is a good business hotel, parking is underneath with lifts directly up to the hotel. Security is good as you need a room key to use the lift to the higher floors. Wi-fi works good, you need to get a pass from reception, it is a code and is needed for each device. It was complimentary. 
I used the lounge in the bar downstairs for meetings and spent time there in the evenings as food is also served. The food is good and moderately priced. The kids menu is not typical and care is needed when ordering. Probably the one fault I would have - Breakfast is only average, I travel quite a bit with work and in comparison to other similar hotels it does not score that well. My wife and little girl used the Hydrotherapy pool downstairs and loved it. The hotel is out a bit from the center of Dublin city, which was no problem as I had a car and as I've saidtheir car park is very convenient. Kilmainham Jail (which is now a historical tourist attraction) is directly across the road as is the rear entrance to Irish Museum of Modern Art. Overall I liked the hotel and will most likely stay here again soon.",4,2013,02,25
240,Lovely hotel,"Just came home from a birthday weekend away with my boyfriend. Stayed at the hilton because it had breakfast included and guests were allowed to use the pool facilities. We also booked a king room with a view as most other rooms face on a busy road so worth the little extra. We arrived at the hotel at 12 and check in was not until 3 so we planned to leave our luggage and head to the guinness factory. We received a lovely welcome from reception and they kindly gave us our room straight away so no need to leave our cases and come back. Later on in thr evening we returned to chocolates and a birthday card left in our room from the staff. Very nice and thoughtful touch. Anybody using this hotel and needing to access the city, i suggest the luas tram line. Only ?6.70 for an unlimmited day ticket. Well worth it and there are 2 tram stops approx 10 min from hotel.

A great stay at this hotel. Only thing i wood put as a negative was that swimming caps were required to use the pool! ",4,2013,02,25
240,No Good!,"music too loud as we were only next floor up from it. unexpected charges at check out, nothing to do with mini bar or room service. And staff had attitudes. Restaurant was very nice, but again unexpected charges.",2,2013,02,24
240,Wow what a gem of a hotel,"My husband and I stayed at The Hilton Kilmainham for 2 nights this week. A lovely hotel, decorated extremely well throughout. Our room (king size double) was very spacious and the bathroom had a bath and a huge shower cubicle.  We ate at the hotel for breakfast and dinner in the main restaurant and also in the bar area.  The chef should be complemented on the menus and quality of food that really were exceptional. Both areas were busy with residents and no-residents which proves what excellent value for money it was.  All the staff were extremely friendly, polite and helpful.  They certainly seemed happy to work at the hotel and nothing was too much trouble for anyone.  

The hotel is situated slightly away from the main town and about 20 minutes from the airport but everything is so accessible. The hop on hop off bus was directly across the road and buses came every 20 minutes, there was a taxi rank opposite to take you into town and about a 10 minute walk away was the tram into town which was very cheap.

I cannot recommend this hotel enough and the staff that work in it. Definitely consider it if you are visiting Dublin, I don't think you will be disappointed.",5,2013,02,24
240,Theatre Break,Hotel out  from town (which suited us) but town easily accessible by bus. First impressions upheld. Staff especially Aga at reception was very cheerful and helpful.  The room was lovely and spacious. Bathroom was bright and clean and  had separate shower and bath. We began with a tasty lunch and finished with lovely breakfast next day. The hydro pool and jacuzzi were very relaxing. we intend to return to the Hilton. Great value all round.,5,2013,02,23
240,How a hotel should be run,"Can't say enough great things about this hotel, staff were excellent at every corner. Hotel is very clean and very stylish. Rooms were very comfortable as was the bed. Highly recommend. I was there for a business conference and found the facilities excellent and again the staff excellent.",5,2013,02,22
240,My usual haunt in Dublin,"Get great Hilton service and nice spa facilities.
Not as central as the Conrad but the steam room is great next day for sweating the guinness out of you!
Restaurant is standard fare but totally acceptable.",4,2013,02,22
240,Hilton Dublin,"Flew in from new York just for the weekend. Greeted at the front desk by Aga, who was extremely helpful, friendly,and knowledgeable of the hotel/services, buses, food/drink and surrounding attractions. Aga was very helpful!! from checking us in AND checking us out she was perfect..",5,2013,02,21
240,Great stay,"Really nice Hotel located 5 minutes walk from Heuston station (the opposite direction to town though). Got a fee upgrade to King Deluxe as it was my birthday, very nice tough and reception very helpful. Food was very good for the meal we had included with the weekend deal. Really great buffet breakfast, usual irish fry-up stull along with fruit, muiffins, yogurts etc. something for everyone.
Just a couple of quibbles:
- Room was noisy, if you get the balcony room I would suggest getting ear plugs as you can hear the traffic below on a busy road. I'd say all other rooms facing in other directions were fine though.
- Bar staff seemed a bit overwhelmed on Friday night as people were coming in, sitting down and ordering drinks and had to come back 10 mins later to ask where they were.
Other than that I had a great time here and will stay again next time i'm in Dublin. Really excellent hotel",5,2013,02,20
240,Spectacular!,"I will start this brief review with a criticism, as I have only one (it's minor at that!) - for tourists, this isn't the most central of hotels. Dublin is, however, highly walkable as a city and the Kilmainham Hilton is but a 5-10 minute walk to the Leiffey along which you can pleasantly stroll into the city's centre.

My partner and I spent two nights here, enjoying a meal in the hotel's restaurant on one of those. Staff were always polite, courteous, cheerful and helpful throughout without any unnecessary formality. The room was spotless, quiet and, thanks to efficient heating and AC, always at the right temperature. Our room had floor to ceiling windows with views for miles and the decor is spot on, being modern and clean but managing to retain some personality. This goes for the hotel in general, it's ambience being smart yet relaxed throughout making it perfect for business or pleasure. Our evening meal was delicious though it's worth being forewarned that drinks in the republic are far from cheap! One of the real highlights here was the breakfast each morning, I've rarely seen such a generous and diverse spread with cereals, pastries, fruit, cooked goods, teas, juices and a delicious hot porridge all on offer!

All in all, we had a fantastic stay and I would thoroughly recommend this hotel!",5,2013,02,19
240,Shaz and Tom,Customer service was excellent - very helpful in terms of showing us tourist attractions in Dublin! Breakfast was great and the pool was superb! Very friendly staff at the pool! The rooms were clean and comfortable - lovely decor,5,2013,02,17
240,An absolute joy,"Although we only stayed here for one night we couldn't have had a better experience. The rooms are perfect for a relaxed stay, the facilities are excellent, the food couldn't be better, the location is central with LUAS just up the road and for those who might like to taste the local scene the pub across the road - The Patriot - is ideal. No complaints whatever although we thought the overnight car park was a little expensive - ‚Ç¨12 for hotel guests.",5,2013,02,16
240,Wonderful stay at this hotel; the staff were so friendly and helpful.,The welcome was friendly and efficient. The room was clean and comfortable. But above all while this hotel is close to lots of places of interest for the visitor it was quiet. I had a good night sleep followed by a delicious breakfast - it set me up for a busy day! Thank you to everyone including the wonderful taxi driver.,5,2013,02,14
240,Nice hotel & very friendly staff,"First of all, I went to Dublin for a business trip and stayed 3 nights.
Location: not so good even if it takes only 5 to 10 mn by cab to downtown.
Room: clean, nice... I booked a deluxe room or similar and I believe it was pretty expensive but Dublin seems to be expensive!
No executive lounge!
Overall a nice experience and special thanks to Paige!",4,2013,02,12
240,What a weekend!,"I have just come back from an amazing time in Dublin.  I went with my Husband and 2 friends for the Rugby match.  We stayed at the Hilton.  It was fantastic, the hotel was clean and tidy, and nothing was too much trouble for the staff.  They were friendly, polite and very accommodating.  Just like to say thank you for a brilliant weekend.  I have never met such a friendly group of people.  THANK YOU!",5,2013,02,12

240,"Good hotel, reliability you'd expect from Hilton","Good hotel, rooms v clean and spacious. Breakfast average. Nothing special here just usual turn out of cheap looking sausages. But the breads were nice. Location good for those coming up from the South as it's very accessible, but a bit fat to walk anywhere. If you get a good price, it's worth it. Wasn't impressed with 12 euro charge yo park the Ar even for guests...thought they could discount this surely to 7.50 as an extra incentive. Pool is a bonus but is small so no major laps here but still nice. Bar food good but a bit expensive with 16 euro for fish n chips! It serves a function but can't say I,d stay here for a family holiday. We did te Guinness storehouse tour and was about a 25 min walk from hotel... Well re commend tour!",4,2013,02,11
240,Smart and sophisticated,"The Hilton Kilmainham sits ten minutes walk away from Heuston Station on the edge of town and so is away from the hurly burly of Dublin centre. But there is plenty to do nearby - it is close to Kilmainham Gaol which is good for a 90 minute tour and for the Guiness Store which is five mins away. Across the road is the Patriot Inn for a pint of the dark stuff and the Italian restaurant above it is fine. The hotel is new and very smart. Their meeting rooms downstairs are fit for purpose and the team is very helpful and professional. Rooms are great, wifi was free, breakfast is good and the overall experience is higly acceptable.",5,2013,02,08
240,My Home in Dublin,"I stay in Dublin for at least two months each time and I always stay here at the Hilton in Kilmainham. I think it's because that their rooms are very comfortable, everyone is very friendly (most of the Irish people are!), the food is super and everything is convenient. 

I have a high standard for hotels because I've been travelling for a while now. Each time I'm asked by the people I meet in Dublin about the hotel, I tell them it's one of the best ones that I've stayed at. Every time I check-in for the night, I feel like I'm coming home.

The only downside to this, is that I'll be too spoiled. I feel like I don't want to stay anywhere else less than the Hilton. :( 

Convenience: 
1. Often, there are taxis waiting just across the street. But you could always call for one or ask from the reception. Everybody knows where the Hilton Kilmainham is.

2. There are two Luas (tram) stations near the hotel, for me the closer one is Suir Road station. The other one is larger - the Heuston station. 

3. There's also a 24 pharmacy nearby, 2 blocks away. That is also beside SPAR a small supermarket, that closes around 11PM, I think. 

4. It's close to Phoenix Park, the Kilmainham Jail (just across!) and the Museum of Modern Art. 

I would always stay here when I'm in Dublin, definitely, and would highly recommend to anyone staying here.",5,2013,02,07
240,New Years Eve,"I stayed here with my partner on New Years Eve on the supervalu breaks. Beautiful hotel, friendly staff and very accomodating. We ate dinner in the bar downstairs food was delicious, we then had a few drinks in the bar and atmosphere was very nice. Would definitley recommend and will be returning at some stage! Great hotel.",5,2013,02,05
240,Great Hotel,"We chose this hotel because of the proximity to Dublin city centre and Kilmainham Gaol. It turned out to be a great choice. I am a big fan of the Hilton chains and this hotel paid tribute to that strong reputation. The location was very good as I indicated. The parking facility was quite adequate and was available for a reasonable rate (12 euro). The check-in process was quick and efficient. One of the managers also personally sat down with us to point out our options for sightseeing and transportation. All of the staff was very friendly and very helpful. Our room was clean and adequately spacious and the amenities, including the WiFi, worked without any problems. The morning breakfast was included with our room and was slightly disappointing simply because of the slightly diminished variety. It was not bad but at the same time, not up to Hilton standards in my opinion. I would have liked to seen a salad option and a greater variety of hot dishes.  But it was adequate. The check-out was very quick. I was quite happy overall with this hotel and would heartily recommend it if you are looking for a hotel in Dublin.",5,2013,02,04
240,Business Trip.,"I stayed at the Hilton Kilmainham while in Dublin on business. It's a modern hotel, clean, comfortable, spacious. 

The staff are professional, helpful - and chatty! A refreshing change from the stiff upper lip professionalism we've become so used to and dare I say it, bored with!

I'll definitely stay at the Hilton next time, the staff add that extra little bit. I didn't get to sample the spa due to time constraints... Maybe next time!",4,2013,02,04
240,Perfect Stay!!,"I was on a business trip for a week with some of my colleagues and the stay at this hotel was just perfect. It wasn't too far from the airport. Temple bar was just 10 Euros away in a taxi. Apart from the location, staff was very friendly. Adam ( at the bar ) helped us out with some great tips of nearby restaurants and pubs. Wi-Fi connection wasn't the greatest but I had no issues with Facetime so keeping in touch with family back home wasn't a hassle. 
Breakfast was really good. We even had dinner couple of times at the restaurant as they had good specials and choices were very decent. Room was spacious with plenty of closet space and was very quiet too.
Too bad I didn't have time to spend at the indoor pool.
I would definitely stay here again.",5,2013,02,04
240,Very good hotel,"I went to Dublin for a job interview and Hilton Hotel was nearby. The staff was really helpful, I would say extra. The room was nice and clean, the bath ok. Wireless was less than what I am used to as I've experienced frequent disconnects during my stay. For breakfast I had a good choice of foods.",5,2013,02,02
240,amazing hotel great break,"had a wonderful trip to dublin this month, this hotel is a little away from the city center but isnt hard to find, a taxi to temple bar is only around ¬£10. Just try to find a local taxi driver and dont book it over the phone as there is additional charges for call out, we had a couple of bad experiences of foreign drivers charging us an extra 5-7 euro. Hotels lovely and modern bar and restaurant is amazing ate here on two occasions and had a good few drinks all of the staff were professional and extended the warm hand of hospitality. only one issue which was check in felt the receptionist was unhelpful unprofessional unfriendly and rude, didn't inform me about breakfast times or offer me any upgrade or papers due to my high Hilton honors profile. due to staying in many Hilton's throughout the year i know exactly what to expect however this check in was way bellow standard im used to experiencing. Pretty sure her name was aga or agneshka or something along those lines. Anyhow ive still left a 5 star rating as everything else about our stay was definitely 5 star. hopefully see you again soon, but hopefully a different receptionist.",5,2013,01,30
240,It's alright,"We were attending a conference and wanted to stay nearby the venue, the Convention Center Dublin (or is it ""Centre""?). But as luck would have it our company's travel portal goofed up and showed this hotel being only 0.4 miles from CCD when in actuality its on the other end of the city-- appx 45 min ride on the Luas (Suer Road stop)/15 min with cab ($12-15 Eur) from the city center and other popular attractions of Dublin. The rooms I thought were a little cramped for space and I didn't like the design of the bathrooms either. Staff was friendly and helpful overall. There is a restaurant-cuum-bar on the first floor which I thought was the best thing about this hotel. Oh, also, it's right next to the Kilmainham Gaol, one of Ireland's most famous historical attractions, and to Dublin Museum of Modern Art. Phoenix Park, which has a Washington Monument/Bunker Hill Monument replica and where Pope John Paul II gave his address is also in the neighborhood.",3,2013,01,27
240,"Felt like home, only better ;)","The reception was really kind and available to us. They managed to make us feel like we were the main guests of the hotel.

The room was clean, large and comfortable. Nice large bathroom and cool services/accessories like the iron, tea maker, safe deposit box, writing desk, interactive TV etc. 

The prices were inline with the offered services and convenient for 2 adults: we managed to get a weekend offer even if we started our stay on Thursday. 

I definitely recommend it.",5,2013,01,25
240,Excellent Value in Dublin,"This hotel is a gem, almost brand new, well located in Inchicore in Dublin, close to Heuston Station and the Suir Road Luas line, so easy to get around anywhere in the city.

Walk to Heuston station through the grounds of the IMMA (Museum of Modern Art of Ireland), and then take a train or the Luas from there.

Service in the Hotel is good, staff are friendly and try to be helpful, the restaurant is great and the buffet is nice and fresh and very well stocked. 

I really recommend this hotel for any visit to Dublin, and do not be put off by other folks who complain about the location -- Dublin is an incredibly compact city, and you have ready access to both public transport and cabs around the hotel. You do not want to drive in Dublin itself if you can avoid it - this city can make LA traffic look positively inviting on some days.

In the evening, try the Patriot diagonally across from the hotel for a good pint of Guinness and maybe some live music, or walk down Kilmainham Lane toward the city for about 500m and visit the small but very nice Royal Oak pub in Kilmainham.",5,2013,01,23
240,Ireland adventures,"We had a lovely stay at the Hilton Dublin Kilmainham. A favoirite memory is the sightseeing tour we took with Brian, one of the drivers for the Hilton. He took us on a wonderful adventure down the Irish coast and let us take in Ireland in a unique way - just as we had hoped to see it. We would recommend taking a tour with Brian if you would like to see Ireland through a locals eyes. Kilmainham jail next door to the hotel is also really worth a visit.",4,2013,01,22
240,Good time at Dublin Hilton Hotel,"Stayed here for 3 nights here during my business trip. Average customer service at the frontdesk however very nice courteous rest of the staff. Reception was only turn off. Not even water was provided and when asked for it, it was mentioned that we dont serve water to Blue members of Hilton during check-in. Common guys, talk little bit sense. Food was average with very small choice of selection of food items. 

House keeping was not even picking up the phone. Beyond all this, the hotel is located at very convenient place accessible to nearby amenities and restaurants.  Rooms were cozy and neat.",3,2013,01,22
240,Amazing value for money,"One thing you learn on trip advisor and in general traveling to different places around the world is that everyone has a different experience and after reading some of the reviews on here I must talk about my experience, myself and my family stayed at the hotel for two nights this was only supposed to be one night but due to bad weather we had to stay an extra night this was organised for us with a minimum of fuss and also with the same rate as our previous night which was a nice touch as many hotels would have charged a full rate, the young lady at reception Paige was extremely helpful and gave us every assistance both on we're to go and what to do in dublin providing us with two different maps, the rooms were spacious and very comfortable and the thermo pool was just what we needed after a days shopping in dublin, we did not eat in the main restaurant as we have small kids so we went to the bar instead were the food was of very high quality and at a reasonable price, all in all I would recommend this hotel to anyone going to dublin and I will stay again on my next trip to dublin.",5,2013,01,22
240,Where is the customer service?,"Stayed here with friends, there were 4 of us in Dublin for the weekend, all working mums. No real customer service which quite ruined our stay. Reception was very cold on check in and we were offered very little information about the hotel and Dublin. It was a hassle to get more towels. We are all from different parts of the country so headed out to explore. When we arrived back to the hotel and were going for dinner the restaurant couldnt find our booking that Reception had made and it seemed an effort for them to get us a table. After dinner we went in to the bar where again we were met by cold staff who didnt want to show us the wine list......all in all a nice hotel but the staff we met let the hotel down.",1,2013,01,19
240,Dublin,"Dublin is the classic European large city.  It's nice, but the real experience is outside the city.  The cliffs of Moher, Northern Ireland etc contain the real beauty of the Emerald Isle.  

The Hilton is a little ""70's"" looking.  It is clean and the service was good.  But everything looked dated.  Not dated in a charming way...but more like dated in a John Travolta Saturday Night Fever kind of way.  I mean, I kept expecting to see one of the Bee Gees walking by in a powder blue liesure suit. 

But, again, IT WAS CLEAN.  That's the number one thing we look for in a hotel.  Just don't expect the extras and the quaintness that other hotels might provide.  Food was very good.",3,2013,01,16
240,Fab time at The Hilton!,"We stayed at The Hilton for a three night break in January. We got a good deal through booking on their official website offering a discounted rate for advanced purchase. We upgraded to a deluxe room for a small supplement and so glad that we did! The room was spacious with a king size bed, living area, a huge bathroom with a walk in shower and bath and to top it all off - a balcony! Liked the complimentary bath robes and slippers however was surprised no water or biscuits provided in the room? Breakfast was a good selection of fresh juices, cereals, breads, pastries, home-made muffins, fruits, yoghurt and buffet style cooked breakfast. The bar was a good atmosphere, playing the English football and the bar food was delicious. We never had dinner in the hotel restaurant as we chose to eat out in Dublin every night. The spa is very good, pool not very big and you have to wear a swimming cap?! But perfect if you just want to relax in the jacuzzi or sauna. The hotel is not in the centre of Dublin, it would take you 45 minutes to walk to the centre or 5-10 minutes in a taxi however taxi's are expensive roughly 12-15 euros to the centre and some of them put a 6 euro charge on the meter before you've even set off - cheeky!",4,2013,01,16
240,Very enjoyable stay,"Room was very clean, comfortable and in good condition. Dinner and breakfast were both of a high standard as was the customer service throughout our stay. One of the staff at breakfast, that showed us to our table, was a little abrupt, but overall, it was a very enjoyable stay and we will definitely be back again.",5,2013,01,16
240,Very good Hotel,"We stayed at the Hilton in Kilmainham for 3 nights in January, Got to say didnt expect much, having stayed in Hilton Hotels before, but this one really stands out, The room was fantastic it was spotless and very large, the bathroom had both a bath and shower, that knocked you over if you wanted it too, We ate There as well, the food was excellent with a varied menu, and the prices were very reasonable, If I did have one grumble it was the breakfast was abit on the cold side, but only on the first morning. The hotel is situated about 3kms from city centre, but the Luas (tram system) is only a 10 min walk from hotel, and the Pub opposite was without doubt the friendliest I have been too. I will be returning to this hotel again.",4,2013,01,14
240,Great hotel to stay in.,"This hotel is just a great place to say on a business trip. Service is excellent, food (well only breakfast tested) is just what I can expect to start nicely a day (quality, real fruit juice, good bacon and eggs - just the coffee, with is still an English coffee... would be good to offer some espresso for international travelers ;-)

Price is great (paid only 100 GBP that day).

Gym is a real one, large, lots of people actively working their body here ;-)

Will surely keep this address for my next stay in Dublin.",5,2013,01,14
240,Not Hilton-like treatment,"We booked and paid 4 days because we expected to get the usual Hilton-service level as we had in the past in other cities. The reception staff and the welcome were ok but not really want we expected. The worse experience was in the Hotel bar: we waited 15 minutes and nobody took an order, after this wasted time we asked twice the bartender and he shouted ""you need to take your orders with somebody else, I am not in charge for your table"". This is a civil servant mentality and not the behaviour of a 4 star staff member. 
Location of the Hotel is not really in the center, so you need everytime a taxy to get in and out.
The wellness-area is not up to date, smells bad and the 2 saunas are not worth to enter.
Positive is the breakfast and the rooms (even though there is no ventilation in the bathroom).",2,2013,01,13
240,"Quite out but a great hotel, at great prices","I've stayed there two weeks in late november 2012.
The hotel is 2.5km from the city centre, which is quite a long stroll to take on foot; fortunately, while pricey, dublin bus comes to a help, with many buses to and from the centre.
The hotel building is nice and new, in a new development. The corridors smells kind of funny, but the rooms are odorless.
The room we had were very large, with a decent sized desk which could fit two laptops with two people. The beds are king sized, a nice extra since irish have smaller beds than the continental people. The bath is new and looks like a prebuilt unit from Italy, shipped and placed.
Other facilities includes a business room, a mini-welness gym and a small SPA, which is really a hydromax and a sauna.
The breakfast is quite rich on the salty side, but is somewhat poor in the sweet/continental side.
The wi-fi in the hotel room is really abysmal: it's cappet at 30kbps, a speed that you would have been deemed acceptable 20 years ago. Talking to the manager, it seems that they  are working to replace the connection, so it could be better in a short while.",4,2013,01,10
240,Fantastic Hotel with Excellent Buffet Breakfast & Spacious Rooms,"We booked this hotel through a special deal with Travelzoo, and it was worth EVERY penny. As part of the deal we were upgraded to a room with a view - which was fantastic. We were on the fourth floor and looking out across the city so the view was outstanding. Also included was the buffet breakfast...fantastic! Everything you could possibly ask for was included. We filled up sufficiently so we grabbed some fruit and some muffins from the buffet to keep us going through the day. The rooms were excellent, very spacious and the en suite bathroom was amazing - included a large shower as well as a bath/shower suite. Staff were incredibly quick at cleaning the rooms - it was cleaned as we attended breakfast on the first day. The hotel is wonderfully situated. From the airport, we got the Airlink bus (booked through the Dublin Bus website @ 6 euro each) to the last stop at Heuston station. If you leave the station through the exit beyond platform two, turn right and walk to the end of the road, turn left and you will approach the hotel - a 10 minute walk. Directly opposite the hotel is the Kilmainham Goal (apparently a brilliant tour but we didn't book ahead so were unable to go in - ENSURE YOU BOOK THIS IN ADVANCE). Because of the close proximity of the Goal there was a bus stop immediately outside of the hotel for the tour buses (we also booked this via the Dublin bus website as you receive an online discount - normally 18 euro each, we bought tickets for 15 euro each). In addition the Guinness storehouse is only a 10 minute walk away from the hotel and is VERY easy to get to. Reception staff were excellent and very helpful. If you need to book a taxi to the airport, book through reception as they have a special 25 euro deal with a taxi firm, otherwise it could be up to 30 euro. In terms of city centre, we arranged a taxi into town on a Saturday night and it was 8 euro.",5,2013,01,10
240,Visited using Tesco reward vouchers  & was highly satisfied.Immaculate hotel excellent food & friendly helpful staff,"Immaculate, friendly staff & excellent food - would highly recommend this up market hotel.
The only slight downside for us was the location, not within walking distance of the main shopping area/Temple Bar etc. A taxi from Temple Bar back to the hotel cost 10 euros. We purchased a two day pass for the Dublin Bus tour which has a stop just across the road from the hotel (near the goal) The tour was excellent & we were also able to use the hop on hop off facility instead of using taxis back & forth to the hotel.",5,2013,01,09
240,The pool!!!!!,"Taking a late anniversary break we decided on the Hilton as its away from the city. We wanted a relaxing break with a few nice walks (Irish Museum of Modern Art & Kilmainham Gaol). 

The room was very average, nothing special but was comfortable and clean. The main selling point for this hotel should be the pool! I best describe it as what you'd install if you won the lotto. Intimate, yet spacious. Hot tub and a number of other facilities including sauna, steam room and gym. 

For us the pool was the icing on the cake and made for a lovely relaxing afternoon. We didn't want to hit the city, but be aware the walk to the nearest luas line is at least a good 15 minutes. 

I'd stay here again if looking for a quiet break, if looking for a coy shopping destination I'd pay the extra and stay closer to town. ",4,2013,01,06
240,Excellent stay,"Spent 2 nights in this very friendly hotel, hotel and bar staff were excellent in every way possible. Rooms were well equipped with all you would need for your stay. Breakfast was probably the best I have had in any hotel I stayed in, food was hot and a very big choice. Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone and we will return in the very near future. I would like to thank all staff for our stay. Happy new year.",5,2013,01,05
240,Perfect in every way,"Spent a 2 night stay in this hotel with an under 2 year old and have to say from start to finish was very impressed. I knew of the hotel although never was in it and we go away every new years day for a break to start the year courtesy of out Tesco Clubcard vouchers we gather up over some of the year and pick a chain and destination to spend them on. We were treated to a fantastic top level room with huge floor to ceiling windows stretching something like 18 feet high! room 526 to be exact so along that row must be all the same. The only minor niggle was the wire mesh i guess for visual look from the outside that existed a foot or so outside the window that did somewhat take the impact of the top floor view away but then gave greater privacy still allowing a view. The bed was very comfortable and a great kingsize with good levels of cleanliness evident. I have stayed in many Dublin hotels and with a child feel this hotel beats any previous visits. Haing the lift a few meters from your room and from your catr in underground also with a child is a godsent and was very helpful although pricey like most things in Dublin at an extra ‚Ç¨12 per night but worth it. The breakfast experience also excellent with good standard, heat and variety to suit any normal needs of a person. I will also hopefully find the bar on here to give it a separate review as warrants it due to quality and service especially a young girl there both evenings who acknowledged our return on the second night and said appreciated it which thought a nice touch and her service was exceptional. The living well pool part of the hotel open to non residents as well as hotel guests was very good in terms of service, cleanliness and heat!. I have been in hotels where although say suitable for young kids they are not as too cold for them. This one was perfectly heated and very stylish with various areas of jets etc in which to relax as well as swim against and in 2 parts. Steam room and sauna also available and good. Gym also available and everything need and all machines on my visit in good working order. Only tiny negative is was given 2 versions of how to exit carpark with ticket the first of which gave me a message needed to pay ‚Ç¨5 after already paying but this was corrected when had to go back up to desk again and would not mention it except for fact day before when at desk for directions another person came with same issue so may be something needs to be addressed. This was the only very minor detail of a perfect stay and will highly recommend this place in the future to those looking a destination as although not city centre only a ten minute walk to the Luas tram line and not much further to the Storehouse. Only a 5-10 minute walk to Pheonix Park and the Zoo and directly beside Kilmainham Gaol and the Museum of Modern Art and their gardens etc makes this a perfect location easily got to from all areas for business or leisure travellers.",5,2013,01,04
240,great hotel,"great hotel ,staff very pleasant staff, can't fault this hilton. the bar food is very good and well worth a visit. the hotel rooms are well kept with everything you need,bathrooms are spotless with great showers ,we went to the hilton just after christmas there was a lovely atmosphere in the hotel and would return again as it's a great base to explore dublin If you are parking your car there is a 12 euro, as we got this hotel at sale price i can't complain but still thing you should not have to pay for parking",5,2013,01,04
240,Good value comfortable hotel,Comfortable hotel within easy access of the city centre.  Great Irish breakfast to set you up for the day. Get a great rate if you book through the Lidl Store site not only for this hotel but for other hotels in Ireland. The bar is good and if your a tourist take a look at Kilmainham Jail across the street.,5,2012,12,29
240,Good location,Hotel is in great location for sight seeing with Kilmainham jail straight across the road and sight seeing tour buses passing by the front of the hotel. The Luas is a 15minute walk from the hotel and there's a bus just a 5minute walk away to get in to the city centre. Was disappointed with the snack menu in the bar and the food we got wasn't much better (didn't eat in the restaurant was fully booked with Christmas parties). There's also a charge for the car park of ‚Ç¨12 euro.,4,2012,12,22
240,Most enjoyable and pleasant stay,"My husband and i and 2 daughters stayed here, on our arrival the check in was friendly and quick.

Our rooms were spaciouus and very clean. The bathrooms had bath, and a fantastic power

shower with loads of hot water!!!

Breakfast was an absolute feast offering everything you could possibly want,

I would definitely recommend a stay here!!",5,2012,12,21
240,Hilton Dublin Kilmainham,As a family of four we stayed at the Hilton Kilmainham on Saturday 24th November 2012. Both the service and food were excellent. The staff were always helpful and friendly. Kilmainham Hospital museum of modern art and grounds are conveniently located across the road from the hotel. On Sunday when we were about to leave our car would not start. Both the receptionist and duty manager were really helpful and a member of staff used his car and jumpleads to get us on the road. This was service above and beyond what we would have expected. Thank you all we will be back in 2013.,4,2012,12,21
240,Disgraceful Service,The hotel and rooms may be decent however do not step foot in the bar for a quick drink before heading off to the city. The service was the slowest I've ever experienced. Two staff members who went at what can only be described is as a glacial pace. Never looked interested in any customers at the bar. Granted it was a little busy but still one of the worst experiences ever in a hotel if not the worst!,1,2012,12,17
240,Don't expect anything special!,"I have recently just left Dublin after one night's stay at Hilton Kilmainham for the last day of my business trip and was extremely disappointed. I was also bringing a colleague which I unfortunately persuaded to try the Hilton.

The moment I arrived I was frustrated by the chaos at the check-in desk. It felt very busy and the noise from the bar was filling the reception foyer. There were about ten people randomly queuing and the staff looked very flustered, check-in for each person took for ages, the staff were handling way too many duties like answering calls therefore as far as I am concerned not giving the new arriving guests any special warm welcome. There were only two staff on the desk and no manager to be seen. I am a Hilton Honours Gold member and at this hotel this status meant absolutely nothing.‚Ä¶ no priority check-in and they could not honour any complimentary upgrades. This was just the start!

We were given swipe key cards for two rooms on the third floor and one card wouldn't work so I called down from the other room to ask for a new card and they asked me to come down as they were busy. As I thought the reception desk had people queuing so I had to politely push my way to the front to get a new card as I could not waste another 20 minutes of my time.   
The rooms were spacious, clean and comfortable but the view was nothing special, looking onto a main road through a metal mesh railing, nothing impressive. At this point I heard the noise coming from the ground floor as it appeared that we were unlucky to stay on a night Hilton had parties booked. After my stressful working week I was hoping that I would have a peaceful Friday evening but to my shock this loud music continued pumping past midnight into the morning hours but fortunately I managed drift off around 1am. I think it's a disgrace that a prestigious hotel can allow parties to continue this late without concern about their other paying guests. If I was forewarned of large parties then I would not of booked.

On my late awaking some of my other annoyances included a bath plug that would not release so I showered in a bath full of water, a remote control that was so worn that barely any digits / lettering could not be seen on the keys and a bedside telephone cable ripped out the socket so telephone did not work.

To finish it off we went down to breakfast at 10am to discover a heaving breakfast room with barely any tables free and we were placed in the last remaining corner by the entrance. Once again a stressful atmosphere with flustered staff so not a calm start to our day. Breakfast selection was adequate with hot buffet but I just thought this was not Hilton's normal high standard. Scrambled eggs were crumbly and watery, not creamy and tasty like my recent stay at Hilton Stucky in Venice. They need to keep levels consistent. It took ages for the waitress to ask us if we wanted tea or coffee then the tea arrived pre-brewed in a metal flask and tasted metallic when I expect a proper tea pot with a fresh tea bag that I could brew to my strength. 

A very poor standard from Hilton. I spent the previous 4 nights in the Louis Fitzgerald Hotel which is only 15 minutes further south of Dublin and I honestly wish I had stayed there another night as it was better than the Hilton‚Ä¶ not what I expected! The Fitzgerald staff were super friendly and far more attentive.

This visit has given me concerns whether I should book another Hilton? I prefer to be given more personal attention at hotels and in this hotel I thought they were under staffed. I felt like I was part of budget coach party and as a Gold member I expected a far better luxurious and calm experience.",3,2012,12,15
240,Enjoyable Stay,"My Hubby and I have just returned from an enjoyable stay at the Hilton Kilmainham in Dublin. We found the staff to be very friendly and professional at all times, nothing was too much trouble. We were made to feel welcome from checking in. Yes - the hotel is out of the city centre but you are made aware of the location by the hotel. It was an easy airlink bus ride from the airport to Heuston station and then the hotel is about a ten minute walk from there. The Hotel is clean and modern. We spent a relaxing afternoon in the hydrotherapy pool, you are asked to wear a swim cap but the pool is so clean and well looked after that you don't mind too much. This was followed by a excellent 3 course meal for 2 with a bottle of wine for 59 euros - this may sound a lot but don't forget you are paying city prices. Drinks were expensive but no more than any other city hotel. I have never had such a comfortable nights sleep and would have brought the bed home with us if we could!!!!! If you are looking for a stag weekend experience then don't choose this hotel - if you are looking for an enjoyable relaxing place to visit then do choose this hotel. Dublin is very expensive - but which city isn't? I would definately stay at this hotel again, even with our kids! There was a family with 2 young boys staying the same weekend and they were happy with the service and their stay. I look forward to our next stay and will be trying other Hilton Hotels whenever possible.",5,2012,12,10
240,excellent service,"Spent a evening in the Hilton . Have to say food and service was amazing .   Staff excellent would like to say big  thanks to Sauas  very  helpful .   Will definitely return to be serviced by Sauas .  

A great place . ",5,2012,12,01
240,Very enjoyable,"We stayed overnight and  I cannot fault it, the staff were very helpful from check in to room service and with a cheerful manner,,  the room was very comfortable, food was lovely and the pool was fantastic..  Well worth a visit and I would definitely return.",5,2012,11,30
240,Friday Mel,"I visited The Hilton Kilmainham last friday, It was the perfect meal, waiting staff are amazing, defo will return soon, thanks to Bob the birthday surprise for my wife was  just perfect and memorable.
Thank you",5,2012,11,26
240,Excellent Hotel with a fantastic pool,"We stayed in this hotel on the 24th November and could not fault it, checked in early ,rooms were available which was great, there was obviously a large function happening in the function room ,however it did not affect the level of service that was in place, staff were very friendly and approachable. Fantastic pool, hotel should sell itself more on this little gem. Overall cannot fault this hotel in anyway, breakfast was top notch, overall, would recommend to a friend and we will certainly return.",5,2012,11,25
240,Lovely hotel and breakfast. Slightly out of centre.,"Stayed at the hotel early November for 2 night for a city break. The hotel is nicely decorated and the staff where polite enough. We stayed on a deal including 2 nights stay, breakfast both days and an evening meal we also selected the free tickets to the Guinness factory. 

The room had a large comfy bed, the view out the window was of the roof below and other rooms on the other side but we didn't mind much as we didn't look out the window other than first arriving. 
We had an early flight so arrived at 8am. They gave us a voucher for cheaper breakfast which was very large and delicious! It was ‚Ç¨12 each but well worth it. We then waiting in the lobby for our room. They managed to get a room for us at 11:30 which was much earlier than the check in time of 3 o'clock which we where very grateful for! 

We got a 2 day pass for the hop on off bus and one of the stops is just next door at the jail which is worth a visit, But we travelled to where we wanted from here which was very handy so the hotels locations wasn't too bad due to this. 
The bar at the hotel is nice and relaxed it is expensive but we where happy to pay it so just relax. It was around 6/7 euros a drink and around 10 euros for a cocktail. 

The free evening meal was delicious, this is the only time we ate at the hotel other than breakfast and it was extremely nice and the service was good. 

We had to get taxis to and from temple bar in the evening due to the hotel location these where around 10 euro which for some people may be a bit much. A taxi from the airport to hotel varies I found between 25-30 euro. 

We managed to see all the sights we wanted to in Dublin in the 2 nights we where here and thoroughly enjoyed it. Would stay again.",4,2012,11,22
240,"Nice folks, good location","Beautiful hotel in a great location. It‚Äôs walkable to most things, and there‚Äôs a hop on-hop off bus tour pickup right across the street at the Kilmainham Gaol, which I‚Äôd also recommend doing so you don‚Äôt have to walk around so much if you‚Äôd rather ride. They‚Äôre a little stricter on their procedures than other Hiltons where I‚Äôve stayed, but the employees are nice. The gym doesn‚Äôt open till 8:00 on Saturday morning, FYI. ;)",4,2012,11,21
240,Short stay in Dublin,"We stayed in a family room as an early Christmas present from my parents who live in Dublin 8. We stayed two nights, my husband, baby son and i. The staff couldn't have been more helpful on check in given that our baby desperately needed a nap after travelling they set our room up an hour early complete with travel cot, and not just any travel cot, a really good one with a nice firm mattress but deep enough to be comfortable. Those parents out there who are used to basic hotel travel cots will appreciate this. The room was nice and had all we needed although it was a little small for a family room. The products were nice and it was spotless clean. Front of house staff were always helpful, made reservations whenever we wanted them and were helpful and quick heating up our son's food in the restaurant. The swimming pool was perfect for us and the gym is small but well equipped. I would recommend this hotel also for proximity to Dublin city centre but also for the Gaol and Phoenix park which is fab.",5,2012,11,18
240,"Excellent value, Excellent Service","We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Kilmainham Hilton.  The rooms are very clean and up to date, the breakfast is outstanding (lots of selection of meat, yogurt, juice, eggs, cereal, etc), the front desk service is excellent and they were very helpful. It is in a great location right across from the Kilmainham Jail, about a 5 minute cab ride or 10 minute bus ride from the center of Dublin, or a 5 minute walk to the LUAS station.  It is also an easy 20-30 minutes from the airport, costing about 25 Euro by taxi.  There is a nice pub across the street with a good selection of pub food, beer and spirits.  On our next trip to Dublin, we will certainly stay here again.",5,2012,11,17
240,Short visit to Dublin,"We were visiting Ireland for the first time and like to stay near train stations so we can move onto our next destination easily.  The walk to the hotel from the train station is a bit far with luggage, but a quick cab ride.  It is only a five minute walk to the LAUS which takes you right into central Dublin.  Next to the hotel is Kilmainham Gaol...an old prison.  I recommend the tour there.  Hotel was nice.  Room was spacious and we had a wonderful view.  Clean overall and service was decent.  All in all a good stay.",4,2012,11,15
240,Great for business and pleasure,"I have stayed in this hotel for business and in a personal capacity and both times it was great.
My most recent stay was with my boyfriend for the weekend and the quality of our room and the food we ate there was incredible.
The only downside is that it is a taxi journey into the town which gets quite pricey if you are there for the whole weekend but apart from that it was an excellent stay.",5,2012,11,14
240,It's the little things,"Booked 3 days for my wife's 30th birthday   Was really pleased on arrival. Really nice.  Was infuriated when visiting the hotel pool as ""you must buy (‚Ç¨2) a swimming hat to enter the pool (not very good bearing in mind this s a 4* hotel). Also lockers involve buying an actual PADLOCK! 

HOWEVER on night number 2 my wife complained of a beeping noise that kept her awake (I slept through it) 

On evening three this same ""beep"" was annoying my wife.   I called reception, the manager was sent up
WHAT A GUY! So polite. He spent 5 minutes in our room and cured the fault   On leaving he asked 'is there anything else I can do for you?   I jokingly said please could we have some complimentary champagne   The manger (I could not believe it) agreed and told us he would send up two glasses of champagne (he did)

If we ever visit Dublin again I will Come Back  to this hilton   Some people complain this hotel is too far out   However it's on the ""HOp on HOp off  bus tour meaning you can get anywhere in the city",5,2012,11,11
240,Excellent !,"Wonderful hotel. Located conveniently to the airport. Has free shuttle to airport. Hotel staff was wonderful ! Clean and large rooms. Family room is ideal for 3 people. Great breakfast in morning and open early. Airline crews stay here.
Priced very reasonable. Reasonable priced taxi ride into Dublin City Centre.
Not located close to the city centre but closer to airport about 10 minutes. Glad we stayed here rather than the Radisson Blu which is very close to airport. 
If we were in town for more than 1 night we would have most likely stayed in downtown Dublin. This is a business person's hotel.",5,2012,11,11
240,Great Hotel !!!,"Stayed there for 2 nights this week and found it to be an excellent hotel from every perspective:
1. Staff were very friendly and couldnt do enough to oblige , especially the desk staff.
2. Room was good size and the bed so comfy.
3. Very clean.
4. Excellent spa facilities
5. Great bar
6.Excellent breakfast choice
7.Location not an issue a 5 min walk and ‚Ç¨1.90  journey on the number 40 bus will get you into Dublin centre in 15 minutes

Would definitely recomend..............",5,2012,11,10
240,Great Hotel,"Chose this hotel because of a very good price and I was happy we stayed there,  I usually stay at another hotel close because of the proximity to Heuston station.  This hotel is ok to walk to if you don't have to much luggage and/or you are in pretty good shape from the station.  Otherwise, take a cab.  We did walk to Guinness storehouse, about 20 min away.  We arrived a little early the hotel had us relax in the dining room and gave us some free tea.  The rooms were very nice, our view was not great but we did not come for that.  Breakfast in the am was very good, good buffet choices etc.  The best part was the pool, there were 3 smaller areas, one with warm water, one with hotter water with great water jets and a hottub.  The jets were great just like a massage.  None are large enough for actual swimming or jumping but relaxing.  You must wear a bathing cap or purchase one for 2 euros.  It is right across the street from the Kilmainham gaol and this is a must see while in Dublin.  The staff at the hotel was fantastic and helpful about directions.",5,2012,11,10
240,Very nice,"I'm not sure how a bad review of this hotel could be written, except that it's a little off the beaten path. My husband and I had a heck of a time trying to find it, but I would say that was more of a result of us having hard time finding street signs in Dublin, and we were walking from Houston bus/rail station. Once we got there, it was so worth it. The staff are really, really nice, and the room... Ahh... So nice! I booked this hotel because I wanted us to get a good night of sleep before heading back on a long plane ride, and this is just what we got. Nice sized room, big, cozy bed, and a nice warm breakfast in the morning to send us on our way. The bar downstairs is also a nice place to relax. We would definitely return to this place.",4,2012,11,07
240,Mediocre,Live in the vicinity and regularly visit the hotel. Lovely food and cosy ambiance massively let down by poor service standards. Every time I go back I say never again but It's not like the hotel has any decent competition!! We move at the end of the month and I really won't be recommending this place,3,2012,11,05
240,Excellent sevice,"Stayed here on a 3 night supervalu break, e mailed the hotel to ask for a room with a view as it was my husbands birthday, we were given a free up grade, to the fifth floor. Check in was very friendly, room was very nice with a great view.A birthday card waiting for my husband. Found all the staff very pleasant and helpful. The food was great, had dinner in the bar the first and last night, there was a good choice including a roast dinner at a reasonable price. There was a dinner included in our package which we had on the 2nd night, the restaurant staff were brilliant making it special for my husbands birthday, including a free glass on wine for us both. The breakfast was good lots of choice. Though this hotel is a little away from the city center, there are buses into the city. I would definitly stay here again.",5,2012,11,04
240,Good Hotel,"Booked a Diner B & B package for 1 night Sat. 3rd Nov. Although listed as a ""City Centre"" hotel it is in fact about 2-3 miles from the centre. It is a 8-10 minute walk beyond Houston train station where there is a tram & bus service to the centre. You could take a taxi from the hotel (approx 12-14 euro) or enjoy the stroll to the station where a taxi is approx 8-10 euro. Check in was speedy and effecient. Room was large and comfortable & clean. Bed big & comfy overnight. Bathroom clean and shower good. Breakfast on Sunday morning was very good despite the toaster getting jammed!. Food quality of the buffet items was very good as was the choice. Pot of tea also very good. They should really have HP as the brown sauce not that cheap Happy Chef muck! That was the only drawback. 

See seperate review of the hotel restaraunt(not so good).",4,2012,11,04
240,Excellent stay,"Stayed here last night for one night B&B
I emailed the hotel asking for an upgrade an got a quick and friendly reply. I'd def recommend to everyone to upgrade. 
Check in was quick and my room was great, I could not find a fault. All the staff were really friendly and always had a smile on their faces. Got room service for breakfast and it was quick and tasty. I will be down in Dublin quite a bit in the future now and I will definatly stay here. Well done to the staff and management!",5,2012,11,03
240,Perfect location for family celebration,"We chose this hotel for a family celebration and were not disappointed.  We booked a meal for a number of people of all ages and the staff were more than helpful.  Sally, the event organiser, was extremely cooperative in helping us organise this event and Katherine looked after all our needs on the evening.  The restaurant is really nice and the food was very enjoyable.  I would recommend this hotel for any celebration.",5,2012,10,30
240,"Excellent hotel, will stay there again!","We had an excellent experience with this hotel. We arrived at the hotel at 8:30 am after an overnight flight from New York. Knowing that there was still hours away from check-in time, we just wanted to put down our luggage first. But the staff said our room was ready and checked us in right away! After a nice breakfast buffet at the restaurant, we even got to have a nap before went out to the Kilmainham Jail museum just across from the hotel. Our room was very clean and comfortable. The exercise room is among the best we had experienced. The restaurant offers good dinner menu. The hotel location may not be at the city center, but there is a bus stop 2 minutes walk away and 10-15 minutes bus time you are at the heart of downtown and closed to the major attractions. If you stay in the hotel with the same amenities at the city center, it will cost a lot more. Overall, we have a great time. Definitely recommend to everyone.",5,2012,10,30
240,Absolutely brilliant,"Booked the Hilton Dublin Kilmainham for a 2 night city break. As part of the offer we booked we received a free evening meal in the hotel restaurant, a free bottle of wine, breakfast both mornings of our stay, and late check out until 2pm on the day of your departure, so we was very impressed before even arriving at the hotel. 

First impressions of the hotel. Quite a walk from the city centre but as we are in our early 20's, this was not an issue for us. The lobby was lovely, with a warm greeting from the reception staff. 

Bedroom - We had a room on the 5th floor. The room was lovely,movers spacious, modern and well decorated. The bed was extremely comfortable, and little noise could be heard from outside during day or night. Bathroom also lovely, with free toiletries restocked daily. A newspaper is also left outside your room each morning which is a fantastic touch. Floor to ceiling windows provided excellent views of the city, and made the room more bright, and spacious. 

Food - on our first evening, we had a three course meal in the 'Cinnamon' restaurant located within the hotel. First of all, the staff were fantastic. Very attentive, friendly and welcoming, continually making sure we was ok and topping up our glasses etc. The food was of a very high standard, lots of choice, and very delicious. The ambience and feel of the restaurant was also very upmarket without making you feel out of place. We also had breakfast both mornings in the restaurant which was buffet style. Once again, the staff were fantastic. The breakfast itself was equally as fantastic with so much choice and varsity. Hot breakfast, cheeses, porridge, muffins - lots of choice, even for the fussiest of eater. 

Location - some people would say the hotel is too far out. Not an issue for us at all. Located opposite Kilmainham Gaol, and also very close to the Irish Museum of Modern Art. The hop on, hop off bus stop is also outside the hotel, and is within walking distance of attractions such as the Guinness Storehouse. 

Overall - I would stay at this hotel again when visiting the city. Comfortable rooms, welcoming staff, and that all round Hilton luxury and quality that I love! Highly recommend.",5,2012,10,23
240,"Good Hotel, average location","Following the previous feedbacks, i would say that this is a good hotel, with a nice staff, but the location is more than average. Expect a ten minutes walk to reach the tram station, then another twenty minutes to reach the city center. 
The rooms are comfortable, well furnished, and clean.
The breakfast buffet is nice, and the quality of the food is good.
Bad point, we have not been able to use the swimming pool, as you are asked to wear a swimming cap...
This rule is not displayed anywhere, not even in the ""in room directory"".
",4,2012,10,23
240,Nice stay,"Good bus service into town, also around a 15 min walk from the last stop on the airport bus.  Rooms spacious and staff were great. 
Wouldnt rate the balcony rooms as there's no divide between rooms and we only had one seat. Not private enough for us to sit out. Gentleman who was in the reception most days was extremely helpful about places to visit and tips for the city.",4,2012,10,19
240,"happy stay, great location","lovely hotel with no problems whatsoever. Great location, walked to Luas stop and hopped into centre that way. 

Room was beautiful and spacious with a comfortable bed. There was no noise disruption and sleep quality was great. 

We went down to the pool in the morning and it was very clean, not busy at all, a truly relaxing experience. 

I would recommend for tourists or visits to Dublin of any kind.",5,2012,10,16
240,Great location and helpful staff,"I landed from the States at 10AM on a Sunday for a week-long business trip and with thanks to Brian - aka ""Google"", the concierge, I had a tee time booked and lunch location picked out by Noon. Both recommendations exceeded expectations and watching Brian, as well as the rest fo the staff, go about their business, not just with me, but with others over the course of the week, it's clear this place knows how to take care of travelers. I'd stay again anytime I'm back in Dublin.",5,2012,10,15
240,"Good rates, but that's about it.","It seems that 75% of the staff is more bothered than not, to assist you.  Asking simple questions can lead to some frustrated answers.  This is only compounded by the more questions you ask. The water temp fluctuates while showering. The beds weren't very comfortable. All the linens seemed tough, but at least they were clean.",2,2012,10,14
240,Most comfortable bed i have ever slept in!,"hotel is fabulous. Excellent location. Bedroom spacious with very large, very comfortable bed. Most members of staff friendly but one or two in dining room could do with learning a few people skills. Good choice of dishes for breakfast, although the 'Full Irish' was very greasy. Would stay again but rather disappointed to find most of the staff were not Irish. (Well most that we encountered anyway)",4,2012,10,12
240,Excellent hotel staff & balcony views,"The Hilton Dublin Kilmainham is not only in an excellent location in the city (near Heuston Station and major bus routes), but has excellent customer service.  ""Paige"", a trainee at the the front desk, may have been new at the hotel but made her best effort during check-in, check-out, and for all questions in between.  The hotel front desk position is never an easy one ~ but a Paige's cheerful attitude and willingness to find the answer to any and all questions made our stay all the merrier.  If you want an Irish stay with professionalism AND a smile - this Hilton is for you.  The balcony view is worth the extra price - !",5,2012,10,09
240,Nice relaxing break,"Have just returned from a 2 night B&B & 1 Dinner stay at this hotel.  The location was great, very central really whether you wanted to travel by foot or car/bus/luas etc.  From the moment, my husband & i entered the hotel, i got a good feel for the place and how right that was.  Every member of staff we encountered with were so friendly & helpful, food & drink and service for same was excellent. The hotel was spotlessly clean, and airy and spacious.  Had a lovely weekend, cant recommend it any higher.  Keep up the standards!!",5,2012,10,08
240,Great stay,"We stayed for 4 nights in the hilton kilmainham and enjoyed it! Some people say its to far from the city center but there are serveral opportunities du get there in not more than 15 minutes. A cab ride is just 10-14 euro. The hotel is in a modern shape and the room was comfortable and had enough space. The breakfast in the morning was quite good for the irish standard.
The hotelbar in the groundfloor serves great food and was not even expensive the staff is very kind and helpfull. 
The reception team was good aswell and especially i have to name rudolff and eric from the nightshift who gave us some great recommendations. These two guys are great for hospitality business! the health club is quite ok but the steambath was not looking good any more and the pool was nothing special. If you need a supermarket oder a good pub you will find them close to the hotel in walking distance. 
I can recommend that hotel to any traveller going to dublin!",5,2012,10,08
240,Good Hotel,"We stayed at this Hilton just after traveling all day by taxi, train, ferry boat, and taxi.  The hotel is located on the western side of Dublin - just across from the Gaol - which unfortunately we did not have time to tour.  Hotel is clean and rooms larger than expected.  Check in was quick and efficient and staff very friendly, even directing us to a very nice pub for dinner.
Breakfast in the morning was buffet style.  Eveything was fresh and kept nice and hot with coffee service efficient.",3,2012,10,06
240,"Comfortable Hotel, Uncomfortable Location","I've stayed in this hotel twice before. Its always been very reasonably priced for a hotel of its quality. My room had a big comfy bed, was well appointed, a bath and a separate shower, flatscreen tv and laptop safe. Add to this good food in the restaurant and the spa pool/gym it really is a nice hotel. The hotel also has free wifi throughout, good if you need to keep your emails in check!

The compromise you make is the hotels location, Kilmainham is a good 40 minute walk from O'Connell Street and the main city centre. There is a good bus service (20 mins into town) and the tram (5 mins walk from the hotel). So, if you're happy to make the compromise, you'll enjoy the hotel, if you are looking for city centre, this isn't it.",4,2012,10,04
240,"pretty average hotel, wonderful staff..","Spend a night here, and it it was ok, but it wasn't up there for a Hilton, or for the price. 

My room was at the front, meaning it's at a road junction and must be close to an emergency services station, because I was woken a couple of times by sirens going by.  

My room must have been close to the ventilation for the spa/pool as outside my room, as there was a very strong smell of chlorine outside my room (I could NOT smell it inside). Didn't bother me, but I could see it could bother some.  

I could also hear a baby screaming in a room close by, so didn't get a good nights sleep. 

The room was pretty good, spacious, desk and the bed was fine. Bathroom was fine, and it as all clean. 

In room internet was terrible, I'd wanted to spend the evening working, and I needed the internet connection, but continually dropped out, got slow, needed to reboot and so on. 

I don't think this is a hotel geared towards business travellers as it doesn't have the executive lounge, so be aware of this if it's important to you. 

Breakfast was pretty good, there was a reasonable selection hot and cold, and it didn't run out. 

I ate in the bar in the evening, and that was well priced, and good. It was a good choice to eat there. 

Staff were all friendly and helpful, from the check in, bar, breakfast and checkout.",3,2012,09,25
240,Great Hotel!,"We stayed at the Hilton Kilmainham for 3 nights last week. We picked it primarily because of the great price, which also included breakfast, and the new/modern look of the hotel (especially compared to others in Dublin). While the location is a little further out of the main areas of Dublin, once we figured out how to get around the city, it wasn't difficult at all or time consuming to get to the hotel. We are also runners, and really enjoyed running in the nearby War Memorial Park (there's a very nice running path near the river). The room was very nice. The bed was comfortable, the room was clean and large, and the bathroom was nice. Breakfast was also very good. The pool in the attached health club was amazing! I've never seen such a nice indoor pool at a hotel! The staff was also very nice and extremely helpful in answering my many questions about the area. The only less than stellar comment I have is regarding the restaurant for dinner. We did eat a late dinner in the grill/bar area one night, and I didn't feel the food was very good. Overall, though, a great stay. I would definitely stay here again if I return to Dublin!",5,2012,09,24
240,Service was great but it was quite expensive,"This hotel was not that close to downtown Dublin. So if you are looking for action, do not stay here. You'll have to take a taxi at night or tram/bus during the day to get to downtown.

The hotel was right across from the Kilmainham Gaol which is now a museum. Our room was on the top floor with access to a shared (between about 6 rooms on the top floor) terrace overlooking the jail (gaol). The scenery was gorgeous and peaceful. On a warm day, it would be quite pleasant to sit there with a cup of tea.

For some reason we were given a handicap access room with a shower that wouldn't go past a certain temperature.  So after our flight from the US, I had to endure a cool shower (outside temperature was high 50s so it wasn't pleasant).  We asked them to fix the shower but after the handyman looked at it, they offered to change us into a room with a tub. (I expect rooms in Europe to have a soaking tub in general). When we walked into the next room, once again, it was handicap room. We decided not to push this further since we most likely would just take showers anyway but I definitely preferred a tub (and at about USD 300 per night, hot water and a tub shouldn't be too hard to come by). 

The bed was comfortable. Internet service was fast at certain times of the day but at peak hours, it could be questionable. In the room they had a kettle to make tea which was nice. 

The pool was quite nice and I believe there was a decent gym there too.

We had breakfast there one morning and that was the only day out of our five night stay. It was quite expensive for the kind of food served. 

The front desk in general was helpful and friendly (except for the little room snafu). 

Work paid for the room, but if I had to pay, I probably wouldn't stay there. I could probably find a room closer to town center for 1/3 cheaper.",4,2012,09,24
240,Will definitely be back - super hotel,"I have stayed in a lot of hotels in Dublin and I can say without doubt that the Hilton Kilmainham has been the best by far.
 I stayed here for 2 nights with my husband & 11 year old son in August. The family room really was excellent, of a very high standard with plenty of space for the 3 of us. It was clean, very comfortable, bright and airy and had all the facilities we needed. The pool was great too with a super jacuzzi and sauna.
The staff were very friendly and helpful and the breakfast absolutely delicious with lots of choice. The location for us was perfect.
I would highly recommend the hotel and we will definitely be back.",5,2012,09,24
240,Dorrie,My husband and I stayed in this hotel and really enjoyed it.  We were greeted by very friendly staff on arrival.  Lovely hotel.  A great variety for breakfast.  Ideal location if attending a concert in the Royal Hospital.  Would definitely stay again.,4,2012,09,23
240,Decent Hotel if you get a good rate. Beds uncomfortable,"We stayed there for two nights (leaving very early morning after the second night) and picked it because of the price, location and Hilton‚Äôs name. The experience was mostly positive but I think I‚Äôd choose a different place next time.

Location:
It‚Äôs 5 minutes walking time from Avis rent-a-car, once of the main reasons we chose that location as we needed to drop a car there. There is also a Dublin‚Äôs Hop on/off bus stop across the street. Since we wanted to use that service this was also an important point for us to pick this hotel. There are couple of city busses that stop by the hotel as well. Not very convenient if you need to get to the airport though.

Getting there:
Keep in mind that this is a newer hotel and it wasn‚Äôt on our GPS. Finding it was not as easy as I hoped it‚Äôd be. We ended up asking for directions and then missed the right turn and ended up having to make couple of illegal turns to get back. Otherwise, if you have good directions or newer maps on your GPS there shouldn‚Äôt be that hard to find it.

Front Desk / Lobby:
Check-in was very easy ‚Äì expected of Hilton. The lobby is always staffed and very comfortable. The restaurant is adjacent to the lobby and offers a decent selection of food and full bar. Prices are a bit on high side but reasonable for the Hotel of this class. We had breakfast included as part of our rate and it was very decent. Staff at the reception was very welcoming but somewhat clueless of what‚Äôs going on around. We couldn‚Äôt get any recommendations on how to spend the evening or what sights to see. They also misinformed us about the taxi ride to the airport. We were told it‚Äôll cost us 25 Euro flat and we ended up paying close to 40 Euro by the meter as the taxi drivers were not aware of flat rates to the airport. We also reserved a taxi thru the front desk which turned out to be a mistake because we could have gotten cheaper cab company elsewhere.

Rooms:
Rooms were spacious, very clean and had everything needed. The beds were very bad though ‚Äì extremely soft and uncomfortable. The bathroom had a strange half size door on the tub so we always had water on the floor. WiFi internet was available in the room and in some areas in the lobby but it was very unreliable and kept asking for credentials to be re-entered constantly. 

Parking:
We were not expecting to use the parking as we were hoping to drop the car at Avis the day before but couldn‚Äôt make it on time. Keep in mind that it‚Äôs 12 Euros a night but it‚Äôs underground and very convenient. There is free parking on the street at night but you have to move the car at around 7am.",3,2012,09,18
240,Dublin's Spirit,"My wife and I stayed in this hotel and we had a great time. The staff is great. In general, all people from Dublin is great. They are so friendly and helpful that we felt at home. The hotel is very well located, very close to the hop on hop off bus lines and just in front of the Dublin jail, which has a very interesting tour. The rooms are spacious and comfortable and the bathroom was updated. I had a great room, with a nice view from the museum gates. I definetly recomment this hotel.",5,2012,09,18
240,Not what I was expecting!!,"I stayed at this hotel on sat 15th and for a four star hotel I thought it would be alot better.  It was close to where I needed to be but the room cost 294e for 2 ppl and we had to pay 12e for parking which should really be included in the price as they have there own parking lot.  I was also told at reception that if I wanted to leave my car space that it may not be there when I came back due to the fact there was a concert on near by and they mite use there car park, which isnt my problem as I was paying for a room I should be intitled to a car space.  So I went shopping and when I came back they were all full but I parked near a wall in no ones way and told them I wasnt moving and they said fine. The guy at reception was'nt so helpful and when checking in the lady said we had a room with a view and when got to our room it was a view out to the front of the hotel onto the street, not much of a view in my oppinion.  And I didnt get much sleep due to the noise outside our window and the noise from the air con and doors banging in the hall way.  The bar staff I must say were friendly and the food was good there. But I was disappointed and didnt have time to complain in the morning as had to be somewhere and was running late due to lack of sleep.  I never do reviews on hotels but thought I would on this one as was disappointed for the price I paid as I was treating my mum to the hotel and thought a 4 star hotel would be worth it but we would have been better of in a cheaper hotel.",2,2012,09,17
240,Hiiton Kilmainham for Tourists,"The hotel from the airport was easily accessible by Airlink from the airport to the Houston Train Station and then a short cab ride.  Hilton Hotel is convenient to the Hop on Hop Off bus lines for getting around the city and seeing the sites.  The ‚Äújail‚Äù was across the street so get there first thing to maximize your time.  Internet was slow one morning, but the hotel had a tour staying there and could have been a lot of traffic.   At other times it was OK.  The dinner at the hotel was very reasonable and there is a nice restaurant and pub catty - corner to the hotel.  Enjoyed our stay.",4,2012,09,16

240,"Badly organised, but saved by good staff","I booked a room with breakfast and an evening meal and an early check-in (3pm) at a cost of ‚Ç¨279  We were attending one of Leonard Cohen's concerts in nearby IMMA Kilmainham. When we checked in we were given vouchers for the Cinnamon Restaurant. I said we wanted to eat early and we were told the restaurant opened at 6pm. When we got to our room I rang reception to ask about booking and was told as it was a Tuesday it shouldn't be busy so we could just walk in. We went down to eat at 5:30, stopping off for a drink in the bar while we waited for opening time. At 6:05 we went to the restaurant and asked for a table. However, the restaurant was booked out!  We were offered a table later in the evening, but that would clash with the concert.  The restaurant manager blamed reception and when I went to reception to ask for help, they blamed the restaurant/kitchen management for not warning them that bookings were exceptionally heavy. Me, the customer was stuck in the middle - and hungry!  I got to speak with Deirdre, the reception manager, who apologised but could not offer any substantial food, as even the bar food was backed up due to casual drop-in Cohen fans.  The best she could organise was soup and a sandwich and an amendment to our room rate. We sat and were given bowls of soup which was delicious.  Unfortunately the sandwiches never materialised.  At 7pm we gave up and left for the concert, still a little peckish.  When we returned we ordered our sandwiches in our room.  We were not charged for these, which helped.  Next morning we rose around 9:30 and headed down for breakfast about 10am. We diverted to the outdoor smoking area for a quick first cigarette for my companion.  We then went to the restaurant at 10:10am for breakfast. There we found that breakfast ended at 10am. We thought it was available until 10:30.  The waitress said there was no chance of food as the chef had closed the kitchen. We asked to speak to a manager and met Lavinia, a supervisor.  She listened to our tale of woe regarding last night's dinner and now breakfast.  Another couple then joined the discussion, having had the same thing happen to them.  Lavinia then said she would get us fed and sat us at two tables.  She herself then laid the tables with cutlery, asked us what we would like and departed for the kitchen.  She returned with sliced fresh fruit, yoghurt, pastries and coffee, and told us hot food would follow. Sure enough a beautiful fresh full Irish breakfast followed.  Lavinia checked with us regularly to ensure we were happy. On checking out, we were given a pro-forma letter from the manager appologising for the poor service and offering a ‚Ç¨20 reduction on our next stay.  All in all, the experience was poor for a hotel charging ‚Ç¨279. A well-run hotel should not be thrown into disarray by a neighbourhood concert, and should ensure their paying guests are accommodated before walk-in trade.  I hope the senior management appreciate the initiative shown by Deirdre and especially Lavinia, which rescued the situation for us to some extent.",2,2012,09,14
240,Great hotel near historic sites,"Stayed here for the Leonard Cohen concert in the nearby Kilmainham hospital. great hotel with modern rooms, free wifi and excellent food. i would highly recommend this hotel if you are visiting this part of Dublin.
",5,2012,09,12
240,Excellent value,Location is not downtown but in an area where everything is accessible. The Kilmainham Goal Museum is across the road and a must see. I found the service to be lacking in some respects. There seemed to be a language problem at times and service at the bar was slow. We ate in the restaurant and the food was average. Room rate was excellent value but noisy air conditioner made sleep difficult.,4,2012,09,12
240,Does what it says on the tin,"The Hilton chain have a reputation for offering a certain standard and certainly the Hilton Kilmainham holds its own in terms of room size and quality.  We got a great deal in order to stay overnight in Dublin while the Tall Ships were on, and in fairness the price was the attraction rather than location as it's logistically 'the wrong end of town', although great for fabulous attractions such as Kilmainham Gaol, which should be on every tourist's must-see list.  Having said that, it's only about a 20 minute hoof along well lit pavements to Houston Station from where you can hop on the Luas (tram) into the city centre; just depends how fit you are. Only down-side for us during our stay was that the air con didn't work in our room, so it was like a sauna, but Reception were very apologetic and waived our parking fee as compensation.",4,2012,09,07
240,Great stay - great amenities!,"We visited Dublin for the Notre Dame game last week and stayed here. A little out of the way of city center, but it's just a 5 minute cab drive away.   It was just what we needed - larger room - clean and comfy.  The bar has a nice vibe, where you can get a wide range of beers and espresso/lattes.  The atmosphere makes you want to grab a drink and relax either inside or out.  The staff was friendly and seemed to really want to help.  There is a historic jail right across the street that's definitely worth a visit.  Only ate the buffet breakfast which was fine.  We have to say that one of the highlights of our trip was hiring the hotel's driver for a visit to my family in Kerry.  Brian O'Reilly was professional, knowledgeable, and a total riot!  He had us cracking up the entire way. He's a true Irish gentleman.  We were so happy to have him on our long road trip.  My relatives even invited him in for tea after meeting him!  Stay here and have Brian show you around, you can't go wrong.",5,2012,09,07
240,Highly impressive organisation,"I regularly stay and socialise in the Hilton Hotel, Kilmainham, Dublin and frankly it is one of the finest hotels in terms of service I have ever encountered in my life.
Thet tend to all your needs and I must give special mention to the duty manager Catherine Walsh who is a guru of her field and her charm and professionalism is as good as I have ever known internationally.
She goes way beyond the normal service remit and I strongly recommend the hotel and also the staff as a whole.",5,2012,09,03
240,A little bit of Americana in Dublin,"Stayed there as part of a bus tour.

PLUSES
Got out breakfast early on a Saturday morning
Accommodated special diet (soya milk)
Bed
Room was big enough
Internet

MINUSES
Location off the beaten path
No atmosphere --- could have been any Hilton in the world.",4,2012,08,29
240,Best hotel of our Ireland trip!,"18.19.20 August 2012  We stayed here at the end of a grand tour of Ireland during which we stayed at many hotels.  They were all lovely, but this hotel clearly shined brighter than the rest, mostly due to the incredibly friendly and helpful staff.  The food in the restaurants was very, very good as well!  Clean and quiet.  As a hanicapped person, the kind help and care I received was greatly appreciated.  Also helpful was the fact the location is literally steps from the entrance to the Kilmainham Gaol Museum and is very close to Dublin Zoo/Phoenix Park.  I don't tend to go on about hotels and I don't generally write reviews, but this stay was exceptional and that should be noted.  Bravo Hilton Dublin Kilmainham!",5,2012,08,28
240,Very comfortable stay,"23-25 August, 2012 My husband and I spent two nights. Having booked a 'standard room' with TravelRepublic it turned out to be a twin (First Floor) when we wanted a double/king. (If booking with this company specify sleeping arrangements required to avoid this problem.)The girl on reception was very helpful and found us a king (Second Floor) in a very solidly booked hotel. It had no a/c but she made sure it had a window that opened and offered a fan if required. She put a note on file that if a king with a/c was available next morning, we should be offered it for our second night. Good as her word, the phone rang after breakfast offering us a new room with a/c on the Third Floor. We packed and moved up and were dismayed to find a twin room again. Fortunately the very helpful receptionist was able to arrange for housekeeping to convert the twins into a king.
We were very impressed with this hotel. The rooms were spotlessly clean with excellent facilities. The bed was really comfortable. Breakfast was designed to cater for every appetite from a light continental croissant or pain au chocolat to a full-blown Irish. There were several types of bread, juices and cereals. Service was super efficient and friendly. Personally I would have liked more freshly prepared fruit. Tinned peaches and pears don't do it for me. Saying that, there was a variety of fresh melon on Saturday morning.
The dining room lacked atmosphere so we did not have the evening meal there. The bar had a nice menu but we did not choose to eat there either. We did enjoy sitting out on the terrace for a drink after walking home from town. We could hear a tour guide/actor entertaining the Ghostbus tourists at Kilmainham Gaol, in the dark, opposite the hotel. Very atmospheric!
This hotel is right beside The Royal Hospital and IMMA (closed til end 2012) and Kilmainham Gaol. It is within easy walking distance of the War Memorial Gardens and the Phoenix Park & Zoo. It is less than 10 minutes walk to the Luas Red Line (tram) stop at Suir Road, which takes you into the city centre and beyond to the Docklands area. We walked back from George's Street in 45 minutes.
We availed of underground secure parking. Be prepared for parking charges when checking out -  a whopping ‚Ç¨12 per night. BTW, we were amazed to find an urban fox trotting across the car park when we drove in!!
If you are not looking for the city centre to be on your doorstep but still within easy access this hotel is a very good choice.",5,2012,08,26
240,Excellent,"Just returned from a one night stay - easy to access the hotel from the N4.  Perfect location for a one night relaxing stay.  Room was very comfortable.  Food in the Restaurant was fabulous and breakfast buffet was delicious - plenty of food available and great service from staff.
Check in and check out was great, very informative and helpful friendly staff.
Will definitely stay again on my night visit to Dublin.",5,2012,08,23
240,Fantastic stay,"Recently went for a few days to Dublin and the facilites were excellent ! The rooms were spacious, unlike other European hotels and very clean. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The only problem was the car park which is a bit ""tight"" especially for a 4 x 4 car, but otherwise location very close to the centre of town. Breakfast was delicious too.",5,2012,08,20
240,Very helpful Staff,"We stayed here 5th to 8th Aug with our 2.5yr old and 7mth baby.  The hotel is clean, the beds are comfy, great room in family rooms, Staff are all pleasant and the bar is a very relaxed dining experience even with two kids!
The pool is lovely and warm- for children it is not ideal as its too deep and there are no shallow bits that they can stand themselves- but we still used it twice and like i say it was warm which is always a bonus!

We had an issue with air-con an after reading on here I had specifically requested that we would def get air-con. (due to baby having bad excema and food intolerances Heat makes him throw up and tear at his skin) Unfortunately, we were gave a room that was all glass very hot and air-con was not working- my son became very irritable and distressed so I spoke to staff at reception who sent a guy called Gabor to our room.  Gabor was very understanding and had us moved to another room with a dehumidifier.

We were upset by this on our first night it was def a bit of an upheaval but in the end Gabor and the rest of the staff done whatever was necessary to help us and that is what matters.  We went on to enjoy the rest of our stay and we will return and have already recommended to family that  are going to Dublin next year! 

The breakfast is wonderful and again the staff brilliant - my daughter, on our last morning, was even made pancakes served with nutella and strawberries!! She was so delighted and we were too at this extra effort.

It is ideal in terms of location for us with young children as there is no nighttime noise so they slept peacefully and to be honest me and my husband really enjoyed the walk to phoenix park/Zoo (about 25/30mins)  and to St Stephens Green!",5,2012,08,20
240,a bit far from...everything,"very nice Hotel, a few problems with check in- went up to our room which was not cleaned after previous guests, we were told at check in the breakfast was till 11am and in the hotel guide it said 10am... but other than that all ok
the food was delicious, they have a lovely bar garden and we were lucky with weather so really enjoyed a few pints in the sun looking at the Kilmainhan Gaol :)
the bar food really nice an the waiters were always looking after us- no need to run to the bar to order drinks, plenty of staff which made things more organised and again- we were really well looked after which was great
btw they have yummy hot peanuts available...they were warm :D
rooms and bathrooms ok, clean bed comfy, free wifi :)
the roomservice don't seem to be too lavish on topping up shampoo soaps etc..I think it was the only time in a hotel we actually used it up in full..not a big issue and I'd say it wouldn't be a prob if I went up and asked for another bottle of shower gel...but why should I(thet would be weird 'hello can I have one more soap please?'...eeek)
the spa was great, though swimcaps were required :/ booo we don't like them swimcaps :/
breakfast full of hot and cold meals, I could not believe they even had pickled herring!!!many people might find it awkward but to a Eastern European living in Ireland and finding this for breakfast in Ireland...made her heart beat faster :) and her belly happy :D
we managed to walk to the town center and back...35 minutes, we also walked to the Zoo half hour walking slowly. we took a taxi to the town center 15 Euro and from the town center 12Euro
- Saturday nite's rates.
a really nice stay great price booked on goireland.ie :) which we always use for weekends getaways in Ireland :)",5,2012,08,19
240,A very pleasant place to stay in Dublin,"This was the last stop of a 3 week vacation in Europe, and the hotel and it's staff made our stay rather enjoyable.  First, the logistics:  it is near one of the main train stations (take a taxi if you have luggage, you can walk otherwise), and it across the street from both of the main bus services which bring tourists around town (very convenient and very cost-effective). The hotel itself is well-maintained and very comfortable.

Secondly, the staff were very professional and helpful. The front-desk staff, particularly Carolina, guided us with some good suggestions. The bell desk was also great (I forgot the names of the two gentlemen who helped with luggage and other suggestions regarding taxis).

Overall, a nice place to stay, for a decent price and decent location (it is not the center of town, but, due to the bus services and being close to the main train station, it is has a decent location).",5,2012,08,16
240,Nice choice that's not in city center,"Easy bus stop, not far from the train station, across from The Jail. The staff was helpful and friendly. The air conditioning was great. There was a bit of repair going on in the hall, but easy to get around. Clean and not too badly priced",4,2012,08,14
240,Nice relaxing break,"Recently stayed her on a 3 night break to Dublin. No complaints whatsoever about the hotel. The staff on reception, dining room e.t.c were all very polite and always willing to help. The room itself was spacious with a huge comfortable bed.Bathroom and bedroom were both immaculately clean. Visited the pool a couple of times. Very relaxing after a busy day but was relatively small and got quite crammed at times. The hotel itself is a fair distance from the city centre, with taxis costing roughly ‚Ç¨10, We walked a couple of times and took us a good 25-30 mins but was very enjoyable if you don't mind it! We had a car and used the underground car park. This cost us ‚Ç¨12 a night and was safe and secure. Breakfast was very good in the morning with a wide variety on offer, the cooked breakfast was slightly cold but very tasty. All in all an excellent stay and hopefully we will be staying here again.",5,2012,08,13
240,"Loved it, very comfortable, friendly and the hydrotherapy pool is fantastic","Comfortable, comfortable and more comfortable! the beds and sheets were great, cleanliness perfect, breakfast really good with a hilton type variety of morning grub.The pool although not  a full size pool was very relaxing, so was the steam and sauna, perfect after a long day of exploring. You have to buy a swimming cap for 2 euros, not everybody did though! And all the facilities were free, that was the icing on the cake as some hotels charge extra for the leisure facilities. Dublin was better because we stayed here! :)))",4,2012,08,08
240,Very good!,"Stayed here from the 4th of August until the 6th, we originally had a normal guest room for the two of us but we got upgraded to a family suite which was very nice as it was more spacious and bigger bathroom which was great :) Room was lovely and very nice view of the kilmainham gaol, very big windows too which i liked! We did have a drip coming from the ceiling although staff were very accommodating and tried to fix it ASAP! The bar at hotel is very nice also! the bar staff are LOVELY! very nice people who made you feel welcome and at ease asking them any questions! also got drinks on the house for some reason not sure why, think it could be because of the drip situation in room? not sure though. Room service is the only thing i would pass on! We got food and it was cold especially for the price and also had things in the burger which were not stated on the menu which was changed but again didn't like it! Other than that i would leave the room service! Also if visiting the city centre of Dublin, it isn't  very close! it is exactly (timed this) 15 minutes walking from hotel to Hueston station and the Luas is right in front of Hueston so you can get into the centre for 3.10 euro return! Although can be annoying walking in rain and to get a taxi from station to hotel or vice versa the taxi has to take a full detour because of one way system which runs up the price! just beware :). ALSO the pool is lovely! very relaxing and staff in gym are lovely! loved loved the hotel! :D beds are extremely comfortable also beware :)",5,2012,08,07
240,Enjoyable stay,"Very nice relaxing stay, excellent value booked through booking.com, great facilities, staff extremely helpful, ideal location for Dublin Zoo, quiet and peaceful stay, leisure facilities very clean and very modern",5,2012,08,07
240,Many issues... but modern rooms.,"Stayed here for 3 nights on the 5th floor during the first week of Aug 2012. Having booked the room at slightly higher charges than similar rated hotels after looking at reviews, the nice looking pool and hotel facilities advertised. However, upon arrival, we found many hidden charges and were given false information at check in. They advertised the GBP-EUR exchange rate at 1.218 (1 eur = 0.8212 gbp) but when we opted to have some cash converted to euros, we only got a mere 1.113 exchange rate after hefty hidden commission charges. Also, the website advertised parking as a hotel facility, only to find out at check in that there is a 12 Eur per night parking charge! Having been checked in, the lady who checked us in gave us the key card of a room that was occupied... Staff then came up after 15 mins to sort out the problem and gave the correct room keycards. The check in lady told us that breakfast was included however after rechecking my booking, it wasnt and if we did have breakfast then they would have charged us around 60 euros for their false information!

Negatives:
- Poor service at check in lady who didn't speak good english and made many basic errors and we discovered many hidden charges described above on top of an inflated room rate.
- Given wrong room keycards at first (of a room that was occupied!)
- Relatively choppy/slow WiFi with poor signal
- Broken tap in bathroom
- Wonky toilet seat
- Pool was a joke, depth of 0.9m and the edges had algae build up (not too clean), it seems like a tick box exercise rather than providing a proper pool for swimming.
- Hidden overnight parking charge within the hotel of 12 eur per night
- Conversion rate false advertising (no mention of the hefty percentage commission).
- Faulty air con in room, although the staff did give an air cooler within a few hours of reporting.

Positives:
- Quite modern, well equipped rooms.
- Helpful staff apart from the check in.
- Good level of security in the car park and hotel
- Cleaners did a good job in cleaning the rooms.
- LCD TV and good quality equipment.

Conclusion:
The stay did get better after a series of basic errors in the service during the arrival day. The rooms are pretty good and most of the staff was helpful (apart from check in when we arrived). However, the service should be better for the amount of money paid and rival hotel chains such as the Radisson Blu range offer much more for a better price!

I would choose Radisson Blu over Hilton for a future stay in Dublin.",3,2012,08,06
240,Lovely Hotel with Great Location,"I stayed in the Hilton in June this year, and was very impressed with the quality of the rooms. The location is excellent if you want to explore Dublin. The rooms are comfortable, We had dinner and the service was excellent I would like to say many thanks to Savas. I will certainly be using the Hilton the next time - as will be returning very sooon.",5,2012,08,05
240,Great hotel ans service,"Stayed  with my two sons from 2-4/08/12.
Arrived 3 hours early for check in and were told that we would have to wait in a queue for the room to be ready, 30 minutes later we were passing an apologetic maintenance painter , who had been freshening up parts of the room, both the apologetic painter and the smell of the paint vanished very quickly , top marks Hilton.
The-front of the house staff were welcoming and helpful as was all of the staff , including the food and beverage , well being and maintenance staff.
Our room overlooked the old jail which was a bonus as we could watch the theatrics of the guides on the ghost bus tour in the early evening.
Althought this hotel is sometimes criticised for its location  ( which gives you a good night sleep , unlike city centre hotels )the city centre can easily be reached by the number 13 & 40 buses as well as the hop on hop of which stops outside the hotel.
Breakfast is well presented , hot and plentiful.the waiting staff and breakfast manager are friendly, efficient and helpful.
The wellness centre was a welcoming relaxing interlude during a busy 3 days.

Would I stay here again ...definitely... Would I recommend this hotel...thought I already had.",5,2012,08,04
240,Four and last visit!!,"My husband and myself have stayed in this hotel 3 times before and I have always reviewed this hotel as excellent but on our four visit it was very poor and we will not be returning which is disappointing as we have a lot of family near by. 

Problems stared at check in, the lady who checked us in didn't speak a lot of English and rushed our check in she didn't tell us about what time breakfast was served or dinner when other times check in has been great we have been given all the information we needed.

When we got to our room (235) it was nice and big but not very clean, there were cobwebs in the bedroom windows and the bathroom sink had a funny smell coming from it. 

We used the pool only once on this trip, manly due to the poor condition it is now in, the changing rooms where dirty and the toilets looked like they hadn't been cleaned for some time. Half of the buttons in the pool which create bubbles and mini waves etc no longer work. Also i was really annoyed when I was told I could not use my underwater camera in the pool (we was the only people in the pool at this time), I was given no reason when I asked as to why and it does not say anywhere that cameras can not be used in the hotel pool, I have never been told before on other visits that this is not allowed. 

Breakfast was good but was not very warm, service was very slow for tea and coffee.

We didn't eat in the hotel restaurant for dinner this time or use the bar after I was sick from my last visit. I should have learnt my lesson not to stay here again after falling ill on my last visit.",2,2012,08,02
240,Nice place to stay,"The room was very nice and the staff were extremely helpful.  Moved us to a new room when we requested an extra bed.  Wifi was free and there was a room available to guests with 2 computers which were available during our stay.  The pool was neat, but you must wear a swim cap and it is not really kid friendly.  
Negatives- Five euros for an electical adapter to recharge phones, tv lost cable connection (fixed promptly) and ice was only available at the bar on the first floor.",4,2012,07,31
240,Good but not one of the best Hiltons,"Our room was on the 5th floor with access from a glassed in corridor which was quite warm due to the sun (however limited in Dublin).   Unlike some Hiltons there is free Wi-Fi, but the signal in our room was fairly weak and slow.  However, we could read e-mails. The breakfast bar was extensive and very satisfactory, though not as good as the one at the Amsterdam Hilton we stayed in last year.  This Hilton is not within walking distance of downtown Dublin, and only one pub or restaurant is close by, but the Hop Off bus stops across the street at the Kilmainham Gaol.  We took the Hop Off bus, ‚Ç¨16 for seniors, to tour downtown, and used taxis to go to dinner.  So this location is not ideal for seeing Dublin, but it is not too far from downtown.  Overall not one of the best Hilton Hotels around, but it was acceptable. I would recommend it with the above notes and caveats for information.",4,2012,07,31
240,Decent hotel...TERRIBLE RESTAURANT! DO NOT EAT IN CINAMMON,"My partner and I have just returned from our stay in the Hilton Hotel, Kilmainham, Dublin. 

Hotel Advantages
1. Good staff at check in and through out
2. Good sized room and comfortable bedding. Clean throughout
3. Fair parking charge - 12 euro for overnight secure parking

Hotel Disadvantages
1. CINAMMON RESTAURANT IS HORRENDOUS! Menu was extremely limited - only 6 main courses! Only one other family were in the restaurant and this was peak time on a Sunday evening - NOT A GOOD SIGN! Food was uncooked, cold, bland and just disguisting. I do not usually complain and would eat almost anything but from the 4 dishes (2 starters and 2 main courses) that my partner and I tried, we never ate any of the dishes. Staff did not acknowledge that the food was not eaten, when we complained the waitress just said, ""thats a pity"". Cost us 60 euro of which we ate no food. Instead we went to our room and ordered a take away. REALLY DISAPPOINTING FOR A 4 STAR HOTEL! NEVER EAT HERE UNLESS YOU WANT POOR QUALITY, COLD, DISGUISTING FOOD! 
2. Location is alot further out of the city than is made out on their website etc. 20 minute walk to Guinness factory (which is definitely worth a visit). We walked for over an hour to get to Grafton street. It is 12 euro to get from Grafton Street back to the hotel. The taxi driver informed us that we had walked for over 3.5 miles!!!

Stay at this hotel if you are planning to drive in and out of the city. NEVER EAT IN THIS RESTAURANT - CINAMMON. It will definitely be worth the drive into the city. Food is HORRIBLE. A HUGE LET DOWN FOR A 4 STAR HOTEL!!!!!!",3,2012,07,30
240,Brilliant stay but was too short!,"Stayed at the Hilton on the day back from vacation to acclimatize before facing reality once more and what a brilliant stayand inspired choice  !!! After some sumptious hotels in Tuscany didnt know what to expect but on entering the room(3rd floor) was amazed at the quality and standard of everything(Better than good rooms at The Carlton Kinsale..which is very very good)
What a relaxing and pampering space with attention to every detail and...only one night to enjoy it Boo hoo!!
Colour schemes and furnishings subtle and relaxing and not one blemish in decor , furniture, bedding and all the extras like propersized  cups,wine glasses, coolers ,well stocked  fridge,toiletries  TV etc etc top notch .Bed..large and ever so comfy after european offerings and rooms so spaciouis.Sleep quality divine.
Breakfast is absolutely outstanding probablythe best i have ever experienced both here and abroad. Selections of freshly baked and warm bread extensive and every imaginable variety and permutation you could wish for in all aspects.Service is great, efficient and friendly and special orders not a problem.
Only had time for bar restaurant in the evening as couldnt find any where neaqrby yet this was unhurried freshly cooked and of a high standard in relaxing surroundings with cheery and lively staff.
Pool was great...empty and more of a hydrotherapy pool with subtlemuted  lighting and music , so not best for children but great for us tired adults who want tranquility and a little peace and down time  . Super hot jacuzzi and likewise sauna and steam room.Bring a pool hat.Didnt use gym but it looked well equipped.
It is in a strange location with not much around even in the way of restaurants apart from a dingy  take out chinese and one distant pizza delivery place and one pub yet we didnt go there for the sightseeing!!
Stay here and you willl not be disappointed and i cant waitto travel back to Dublin and stay here in this little oasis of a property for a much longer stay.",5,2012,07,29
240,Lovely Hotel,Myself and my wife stayed at the Hilton in Kilmainham at the end for June. I have to say I couldn't really fault it except that we had to Pay ‚Ç¨12 for the use of the car park. The hotel is about 5 to 10 mins drive away from Dublin city centre so it is far enough away from the centre not to be charge city centre prices but less than ‚Ç¨10 in a taxi if heading out for the night. It also located literally across the road from one of Ireland's most famous attractions Kilmainham Jail. As for the Hotel itself it's relatively new and has all facilities you would expect for a modrn hotel. It has a lovely but unusual  leisure centre. All in all would definately go back next time while staying in Dublin,5,2012,07,29
240,Reasonable rates - good location,"I've stayed at the Hilton Kilmainham on 4 different occasions over the last year and a half. The first 3 were related to business trips, but the last instance was for a family vacation. I selected the Hilton as the rooms are spacious and the rates reasonable - in comparison to some hotels in central Dublin. The hotel itself is fine - most of the staff was very helpful and accommodating. I skipped breakfast this time, but my wife and child said their meals were good. While breakfast is continental, my wife asked for and received a made to order omelet. Reception was helpful in providing directions and restaurant recommendations. Didn't try the pool, but the gym is adequate. 

If you're driving, this hotel is very easy to get to from the M-50 and doesn't require navigating the traffic in downtown Dublin. Taking the bus tour? A stop is right across the street in front of the Kilmainham Gaol. Need a taxi into town? Depending on the time of day a trip to Grafton Street runs about 10EUR to 15EUR. A city bus stops across the street, but it was more convenient for me to take a taxi.

The Guinness facility is within walking distance (about 15-20 minutes), and the Irish Museum of Modern Art is right across the street.",4,2012,07,23
240,My visit to Dublin,"Excellent service, especially in reception area. Carolina did a quick and good job during the checking process. The personnel in the restaurant is very friendly and always happy to serve.

Just spend 5 nights in the Hilton Kilmainham and had a fabulous stay! Rooms are very spacious and beds extremely comfortable. Breakfast is outstanding with a huge variety to chose from! Staff are really friendly and helpful, all in all a lovely hotel. Hope to stay again.",4,2012,07,23
240,Hilton Kilmainham - Definitely not a hotel for children,"Stayed at the Hilton on Thursday night the 19th July, with our two children. We had an early morning appointment in Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin the next day and not knowing our way around Dublin whatsoever the extremely helpful girl on reservations said Reception would be able to give us exact directions no problem. Arrived Thursday evening to check in. We have stayed in hotels all over Ireland and I have never been greeted with such a cold, unfriendly Reception. The ""lady"" in question was a trainee and I don't no was it the fact that we had children and were not on a business trip but she was extremely snooty and made both myself and my husband feel very unwelcome. On giving us our room card, she never explained how to get to the room, there was no ""enjoy your stay with us"", just unbelievable in this day and age. We had requested a quiet room and I have to say one of the only plus points to our stay was that we didn't hear a sound from other quests. The room was a ""Family Room"" a King size bed and a single bed plus we had a travel cot for our youngest child. The room in my opinion is not a ""Family Size"", it was extremely claustrophobic and HOT. The air conditioning unit was just useless, within a few hours both our children were coughing, it was just so stifling. Also the fridge in the room didn't seem to be connected and as I had food for the baby that required a fridge I immediately contacted Reception and was told someone would come up. 2 hours later no one had come to look at the fridge. We then decided we'd take a spin out to Crumlin so we'd have an idea of where we needed to go for the morning. The lady at Reception while she said she lived in the general area had no idea how to direct us there!!!! either did any of the bar staff!!!! Several hours later we arrived back to the hotel after managing to find our way there and back. There were no other children around the hotel so decided it was best to take our drinks up to the room as the atmosphere was certainly not child friendly. Arrived back to the room, which at this point was like walking into a sauna.... and yet again the fridge hadn't been looked at. This time when I contacted Reception I was told by the same lady that the fridges didn' t work in any of the Hilton's rooms and if I wanted something kept in a fridge she would organise for it to be kept in the kitchens. Why was this not mentioned earlier?? None of us slept that night, the room was just unbearable. Just like to add that the bathroom was spotless and the shower was excellent, just as 2 of the only plus points to the room. Breakfast in the morning was fine, nothing wonderful. The only person who was anyways friendly and pleasant at the Hilton, was a beautiful Asian lady who brought us our breakfast with a smile and a lovely greeting. Also when we checked out in the morning our ticket was not correctly validated by the same trainee who had checked us in and I had to travel from the carpark back up to Reception to have it revalidated which delayed us by 15 minutes. So I would advise anyone who is travelling to Dublin with children to stay well clear of this hotel, the staff in general in particular the Reception staff are unhelpful and downright snooty, totally totally unacceptable in these recessionary times. Also the parking fee of ‚Ç¨12.00 is also a bit much considering 1 nights B & B costs in the region of ‚Ç¨160.00. A most unpleasant stay.",1,2012,07,23
240,Saturday night in Dublin,"This hotel is easy to find, being opposite Kilmainham Jail. Parking is added to your bill @ 12 euros. The areas in the hotel to relax in are very comfortable, and the bedroom was fine, except with no opening windows the rooms become airless through the night, and it affects sleep qualify we think. Absolutely clean, comfortable, with fairly new furnishings, there is nothing to say (but good) about that aspect of the stay. 
Breakfast was nothing out of the ordinary - self service. In our opinion like other breakfasts we've had in large cities, adequate but not marked out by good service, or exceptional food items. The Hilton Dublin Airport's breakfast is superior in our view.",4,2012,07,22
240,Great location!,"Just spend 4 nights in the Hilton Kilmainham and had a fabulous stay! 
Rooms are very spacious and beds extremely comfortable.
Breakfast is outstanding with a huge variety to chose from!
Staff are really friendly and helpful, all in all a lovely hotel.
Hope to stay again.",5,2012,07,21
240,Brian the trip advisor and his tours,We recently hired Brian to do a tour of dublin city and the surrounding mountain area. Brian was very friendly and professional.  He was informative about the area and me and my family had a wonderful time with him.,5,2012,07,19
240,"Great location, not too large and helpful staff","My wife and I stayed for 5 nights early June.  Have no complaints at all. (actually there was one, but not the hotels fault.  There was a music concert two nights in a row in a park close by and it was LOUD.. )  On site restaurant and bar was convenient and food good.  Staff most helpful and smiled.. I like people who have a smile on their face!

We recommend",4,2012,07,19
240,"excellent hotel , great rooms","we stayed in the hotel this weekend and it was fabulous. great rooms , fanntastic breakfast , all was excellent.",5,2012,07,15
240,Has the Potential to be Great....Someday.....,"The hotel has excellent facilities, but suffers from what appears to be inadequate attention to upkeep, and a mostly inexperienced staff.  

We reserved a ""Family Room"" which consisted of a King bed and a twin bed -- ideal for our needs.  The room was good sized.  However, the air conditioning was not working, and throughout the first night the room remained around 80 degrees Fahrenheit (around 27 degrees Celsius).  Upon advising the management we were given the option of moving (which we did) or we could remain as we were promised that the air conditioning repair technician would be servicing the room that day.  We chose to move, which took about an hour, but in retrospect this was the right decision.  The next night, another family was given the room we vacated, and the management had to move them as well, as the air conditioning didn't work.  This might have been forgivable except for the management's feigned surprise that the unit wasn't working.  To the management's credit, both our first night and that of the other family were taken off the bill.  

Sadly, maintenance problems in the hotel abound.  Several electrical outlets in both rooms we occupied were inoperative. The carpeting is worn in places and pulling apart at the seams in others.  Further, the pool area, which is truly spectacular in design, suffered from maintenance problems as well.  The pool is equipped with numerous jets, bubblers and water features that both entertain the kids as well as provide a water-borne massage for aching muscles.  Unfortunately more than half the features were broken for all or part of our 5-day stay, with the majority of features working for only 1 or 2 days out of five.    

If this were a discount hotel chain (a Hampton Inn, perhaps), this might have been acceptable, but it is not.  At just under 400 U.S. dollars per night, the Kilmainham is one of the most expensive hotels I've stayed in, and this reviewer travels approximately 120 days a year.  At this price...or even at half this price, a much better level of maintenance should be able to be expected.

Guests should also be aware that there is no full-time concierge.  Many of the desk staff are ""trainees.""  To their credit, the staff are pleasant, and strive to be helpful, but are clearly less experienced than those I've found in Hilton's other European hotels. The manager maintains an unusual level of invisibility, which may be the source of many of the hotel's problems. 

Gold and Diamond level guests can expect in-room amenities only on the first night, not on every night which is the standard in Hilton's other European properties.  

To the hotel's credit, the lobby is clean and bright, and the bedding and toiletries are to Hilton's usual standards.  The hotel is on the city bus line, and for tourists is directly across the Kilmainham stop on both the Red and Green tour bus lines, making it a very convenient location in which to stay.    

Nonetheless, for roughly 300 Euro per night, guests have every right to expect and demand better.  The Kilmainham was a disappointment.",2,2012,07,09
240,"Out of the way, but clean and comfortable","We liked being able to tour the Kilmainham Gaol which is directly opposite the hotel, but we had to walk a block and pick up the bus to get to the nightlife in the Temple Bar district.  The bus cost 1.90 Euros each way - exact change only.  

The hotel prepared a special continental breakfast for us because we were on an early shuttle to the airport.  We were treated well in both the hotel bar and the restaurant.  

The rooms were clean and comfortable.",4,2012,07,09
240,Brilliant Hotel....extremely helpful staff!,"First of all I would just like to thank Brian at Reception for all his help. Myself and my friend had never been to Dublin before so were unsure of where to go but Brian was really helpful and talked us through all the best places to go and even outlined it all out on a map for us. Furthermore, I would also like to praise all the staff at the Hotel Dublin Kilmainham, I found them all extremely helpful and polite.

The actual hotel is wonderful - very modern and clean! The restaurant does a nice range of food and all at reasonable prices. They even do room service, which is available 24 hours a day, which was really helpful when you don't arrive till 11:00pm and are starving! We were really lucky with weather over the weekend and were able to sit out on the terrace at the restaurant, which was really nice.

We also had breakfast included with our room and it was an excellent spread. They had all your usual bacon, sausage, eggs and some local foods too. Then pastries, cereal, fruit, yoghurts etc. The breakfast is definitely worth the money in my opinion.

We had a standard twin room which was suprisingly spacious. The bathroom was really quite large and was immaculately clean. The room also had a TV which had all the standard channels. A safe was located in the room at no extra cost and air conditioning which came in handy. We were only there for two nights but the maids came up to clean our room.

I really couldn't fault the hotel and would highly recommend it. I plan on returning to Dublin next year and would definitely stay at the Hotel Dublin Kilmainham again . It is relatively close to Dublin town centre - a short taxi ride away and we walked to Phoenix Park both days and it took just under 30 minutes. The airport again isn't that far away from the hotel - roughly a 25/30 minute taxi ride and cost just over 25 euros which wasn't bad. The hotel even organised our taxi on the morning we left to take us to the airport.

Faultless hotel - excellent service!",5,2012,07,09
240,family trip,"We stayed at the hotel for 4 days during a conference in late June.  The hotel is right across the street from the jail, so you have access to all the hop on and hop off buses.  Otherwise it is a good 10 minute drive to the temple bar area.  It is close to the phoenix park and the zoo, but again not really within walking distance.  We were able to take a 15 min walk to the guiness storehouse, but other then that you are not close to anything.  There is no real option on food, except the restaurant, which was pretty good.  There is a take away chinese place, pizza place and a pub across the street serving italian food.  These are the only restaurants that you can find-so plan on eating while you are out and about.

The rooms are ok, and having to purchase 2 rooms for a family of 5 with a 3,5, and 7 yr old made the cost of the hotel in the high price range.  They are basic rooms, and the air conditioning did not work the best in our room. The conversion plug for ipad/ipod/cell phones did not function and we were told that most did not work because of wiring issues.  There is no benefit for being a diamond member, in fact out of the 5 rooms we booked that had a total of 6 children. We received one small complimentary can of chocolate shamrocks-a 5 euro gesture.  So if you are a hilton honors member whether it be silver, gold or diamond-there is no real advantage. 

I will tell you that the reservation person at the hotel was exceptional. She helped us arrange everything, and made sure that we had the right reservations and that the rooms were connecting. It was because of her that we would stay at this hotel again.",3,2012,07,06
240,Ok,"Very good staff. Very helpful and friendly, especially our friend Adam the bartender. Bar good, food good, breakfast and a dinner.  The silly glass shower curtain merely redirected the water onto the bathroom floor. And the HVAC didn't wok real well, the thermostat was useless. But overall a nice clean quiet hotel.

The issue is location. It is well out of town. And there is not much around it. True, Klmainham Gaol, the most important site in the history of the Republic, is across the street. And the Museum of Modern Art is also across the street; sadly closed for renovations at the moment. Phoenix Park a bit of a walk to the north. But, aside from one pub with a so so restaurant across the street there is nothing else around.

It's a hike to Heuston Ststion and public transportation. Nice walk, but still a hike (kilometer?). One nicer pub and restaurant a hike the other way. I love to walk, and walked in all directions, and the weather was fair. But if it's raining, it's a taxi ride into town. At 6-7 euro each way. 

So, nice place. Great staff. But a bit out of the way.",3,2012,07,04
240,Weekend Away,"I have just returned from a weekend in Dublin and i was delighted with this hotel, friendly approcahable staff, lovely room and everything you need, Our stay was also added to by the hotels recommendation of a local tour guide named Bryan who took us on a tour of the Wicklow Mountains, which was wonderful. I cant recommed the hotel and Bryan highly enough.",5,2012,07,04
240,Great value and Location,Within walking distance to the heart of dublin means its location is superb. Just a stone throw away from the old Kilmainham jail. Good food and helpfull staff. Ideal place to stay on a budget.,5,2012,07,02
240,"Good hotel, but more for a business stay","Everything you would expect from a hilton hotel,  nice, clean, friendly and overpriced! Our evening meal in the bar was very good. The breakfast was good too, but a total rip off......just way too expensive. We stayed in the hilton junior suite which was the best room they had. It was nice, but we had a shared balcony and the shower was a wee drip of water! This hotel is more suited for business traveller's.",4,2012,07,01
240,Good Time,"Spent a couple nights with extended family ranging in ages from 13 to 78. Had a very good time and the staff was quite competent. Allowed for early check-in for several rooms when part of our group arrived at 7 AM after very long plane trip. Front desk staff could be a bit more knowledgeable about the immediate area, but Sara shined.  Only real downside is location but not overwhelming. BRIAN O'REILLY ROCKS!  Local driver who is not even a Hilton employee was a wealth of great information.  Started a family vacation off very well.",4,2012,06,28
240,Beautiful Hotel in Dublin,"After touring around Ireland for over a week it was nice to be settled into a nice, modern, up-to-date hotel with all the amenities, including air-conditioning. The rooms were spacious, modern, clean and appealing. The service was very good and the front desk people very helpful and friendly. Free wi-fi was always available. The beds were very comfortable and the bathroom had excellent lighting and amenities. Cleanliness abounded throughout the hotel.",5,2012,06,28
240,"Excellent location, lush rooms!","Spent a Friday-Sunday short break at this hotel using our Tesco Clubcard vouchers. Great location as although about 20mins from city centre, if you buy a Dublin Sightseeing Bus Tour ticket the stop for Kilmainham Gaol is opposite the hotel, so no need to worry about transport during the day. Lush rooms, very spacious with everything you need. Spotlessly clean and up to the standard you'd expect from Hilton. Only downside to our room was it didn't have any windows and although air conditioning unit in our room, this did not appear to be working correctly as no fresh air in room so very stuffy. Breakfast was great with a large range to suit all palettes, from full  English breakfast, toast, cereals, fruit & a wide range of pastries. Our only complaint about the breakfast was that it was all warm rather than hot. Reception very helpful in giving directions to city and Croke Park Stadium. Bar prices as you would expect for a hotel. Definitely recommend and would go again.",4,2012,06,26
240,Good choice,"Stayed here for one night, arrived early but had to wait until 3 o clock to check in. Rooms are nice, nothing spectacular, but well finished. Didnt eat in the bar as food was pricey and selection not great. Breakfast was very good. Good value for money, but it's a little bit out of town. Perfect for walking to guinness storehouse and kilmainham jail.",4,2012,06,25
240,V.Nice Hotel,"i was in dublin for business visit between 30th of may and 3rd of June and i totally enjoyed my stay @ hilton hotel... room clean and Gym is nice ... receptionists are very helpful ..
it is quite hotel with very nice Breakfast...
it s highly recommended to be there :)",5,2012,06,21
240,Great Stay,"We arrived at the hotel early, but they had a room ready for us. Check in was quick.

The rooms were nice and spacious, though I found that they didn't replenish soaps and shampoo in the washroom unless you hid them.

The breakfast was good, but the selection was paltry. Though it was included in the price, so I shouldn't complain.

I had an unsatisfactory experience with the restaurant in the hotel when I ate dinner there one night, but that is another review.

The hotel is located on the outskirts of Old Dublin. There is the Kilmainham Jail nearby, and the modern art gallery. But the hotel is quite far from the centre of Dublin, or any sort of public transportation (such as Light Rail or Buses). 

Yet, the location is away from the hustle and bustle of the city. So you can get a good night's rest.

I would recommend this hotel.",4,2012,06,16
240,What started as unsatisfactory turned to great.,"So we stayed here for one night last year and took a deal for one night B&B with Dinner. Hotel was clean and room was as expected. The hotel is compact so we didn't expect too much in the way of space in the lounge but it was OK for a value hotel. Unfortunately we had a big problem in the restaurant with a member of staff who completely embarrassed my wife in an attempt to prove that the chief was using ingredients as stated on menu. This didn't get rectified at the time because my wife so upset we didn't kick up as much as I would normally in relation to the bill at the end and decided to put it down to a never again hotel. Well now for the good side which I'm going to put down to the operations manager and his perseverance to restore my wife's hurt view of Hilton hotel chain. He (Rivaaj Ramjan Operations Manager) was just unbelievable. He got back to me in relation to an evaluation survey which was sent to me after the stay. I stated the problem in order to help the hotel to check the problem and did not expect the hotel to take it so seriously.  Ravaaj did everything in his power to rectify the problem after the fact weeks later, which in my book shows that you can really trust a hotel if they go to great lengths to make sure you are satisfied even when you dont like to make a big fuss at the time. Completely restored my wife's faith in the Hilton group which would have stopped us going again to any Hilton never mind this hotel. After this treatment I would have no hesitation to go back to this hotel and would thoroughly recommend it as a value hotel near the heart of Dublin. Thanks Ravaaj you give Hilton a Good name again for me. Thanks for the personal & professional way you handled this complaint. Any hotel that goes to these lengths to satisfy customers needs to be commended, and especially Ravaaj.",4,2012,06,08
240,Nice Hotel,"Nice big room, free internet, nice bed, decent breakfast & well priced. What more can you ask for. I'd also say great location but most would say it's too far away from the action but I disagree. It's right beside the gaol & the directly on the HOHO bus route. It's also a short walk to the Hueston Station. If you were ambitious you could even walk to Temple Bar area. 
If you're like me & don't need to be right in the middle of the hustle & bustle then this is the place for you. I also booked the special weekend getaway rate with breakfast & while it wasn't a gourmet breakfast it wasa buffet style more than adequate & combined with the good rate I was very happy with this place overall.
I was also pleased that the parking was secure & monitored & onsite since I had gotten the impression from the website that the parking was a little ways away & didn't sound all that secure.",4,2012,06,07
240,Perfect hotel in perfect location for zoo,"Was very impressed with this Hilton Hotel. We travelled down to Dublin from the North for just one night with our 3 year old daughter to take her to the zoo and to meet up with family. Room was well  presented, spotless and spacious. Lovely bathroom aswell, superb rainfall shower, could have stayed in there for hours! Free wi-fi was great.
We had coffee in the front bar/restaurant 'Cinnamon' and also dinner that evening which was lovely. Friendly helpful staff aswell. Breakfast buffet was also well presented, only small complaint was that I think the apples and oranges could have been fresher, the rest was first class.  Favourite part of the whole hotel was the hydrotherapy pool, it was bliss, even with a 3 year old! dimly lit and very relaxing : ) Not a pool for doing laps but very clean and complete with jacuzzi, steam room and sauna. My partner also made good use of the gym and thought it was great aswell.  Will definitely return to this hotel for another Dublin trip, it's especially nice in the sunshine!",5,2012,06,07
240,Modern Amenities; Odd Location,"The Hilton was a breath of fresh air after traveling through Ireland - nice, big clean bed, large room, big bathroom, even outlets to accommodate different styles of plugs (no converters needed).  Our room was ready at noon, which was very convenient, and we had a nice view.  Extremely convenient to Kilmainham Gaol, but be weary staying here if you want to hang out in the City Centre - it's a decent walk (30+ minutes), and not that close to the Luas.  Also, note that swim caps are required in pools in Ireland; there weren't any to borrow when we were there, and buying one was 2EUR (and the pool at the Hilton was very nice!).  The only other negative was that there was a fridge in the room that was no longer operational, which would have been nice to know before we bought things to go in the fridge (they should just be removed); and while we had ice buckets, there weren't ice machines on floors.",4,2012,06,02
240,Very comfortable hotel with great leasure facilities,"Out of the centre of Dublin, but close to some attractions - Modern Art Museum, Kilmainham Gaol, Phoenix Park. Taxi, Bus and LUAS (tram) all easy access (‚Ç¨40+ taxi fare from airport)

Decent sized and comfortable rooms and excellent spa/gym facilities. Nice bar with outside sitting area but no executive lounge.

Good breakfast in very pleasant restaurant.

Friendly and helpful staff",4,2012,05,29
240,Overall Excelence,"Located in a place with easy public transportation access (taxi and bus just outside the for, train and LUAS station at the end of a 10 minutes walk) and also points of interest (one of the entrances to the Irish Modern Art Museum gardens and the Kilmainhan Gaol are in the immediate surroundings), it features good rooms with decent sound isolation. The personal was always attentive and effective in handling any query that I presented.",5,2012,05,27
240,Wonderful,"We attended a large family gathering here over the weekend.  We had a wonderful afternoon.  The food was excellent, the service excellent.  The atmosphere was great with locals watching the rugby final, tourists having a relaxed drink after their tour of the jail next door and people like ourselves having a relaxed late lunch.",5,2012,05,22
240,"Great location, full service facility, nice spa centre.","Very comfortable room, nice spa and pool facility, child friendly.  ",5,2012,05,17
240,Decent hotel ruined by noisy room and no sleep for two nights,"I was recommended this hotel by a colleague - I will be staying in Dublin  3-4 days every month from now on so was pleased to get a recommendation. Everyone was very friendly and helpful - I had forgotten my phone charger and when I asked the receptionist where I might buy one she lent me hers for my stay which was much appreciated.  BUT I have to support eslicks comments about the noisy room. 
I too thought the constant loud hum was from the bathroom fan and waited for it to go off but on investigation (in my jamas at 0200!) I realised  it was outside near a plant room which reverberated all through my room ALL NIGHT.  As it was a vibration as well as noise, ear plugs/iPod on full blast did not mask it - sleeping with earphones in is NOT comfortable. I asked to be moved but was told there were no spare rooms - a party of American tourists 'it's Tuesday so it must be Dublin' had just checked  in so me paying ‚Ç¨120 a night excluding breakfast went to the bottom of the priority list.  My second night was equally awful- I would have been better sleeping in my car! Not good if you're here on business

When I checked out I told the receptionist I'd like to stay on a regular basis if I could be assured of a quiet room but that was met with a non -committal  shrug
 
However the food at dinner was good, the breakfast plentiful but with a total bill for ‚Ç¨367 for 2 nights  I expected a restful night's sleep.",3,2012,05,02
240,"Good hotel, made better by staff.","Having spent a wet and windy 4 days in Dublin in April, I have just had time to write a quick review.
We stayed in a double with our 18 month old.
Very nice room, spacious, clean, nice bathroom, as you would expect from a top 4* hotel.
Our room was cleaned daily and provided a great sanctuary from the cold outdoors.
Breakfast however was a bit of a let down, fairly standard cooked and cold, but really salty sausages and bacon and dry muffins/pastries.
The staff were helpful and efficient.
However what was really nice was that the hotel does an early bird set menu before 19:30, so 3 courses for 20 euros and bearing in mind that we found Dublin relatively expensive I thought this was a steal, especially as the food was very good. The bar food was also very good and a lot of people visited from outside the hotel to watch the football and have a drink and sample food.
The hotel itself is a 20-30 minute walk to the centre of Dublin and a 10 minute walk to the train station where you can catch a tram. The number 79 bus (I think) from O' Connell street stops right outside the hotel. The Gaol is opposite. The gym was ok, but very busy, however the spa pool was very nice although the staff were a bit pedantic (note this is not run by the hotel but by Bannatynes).
However I would recommend this hotel, a very nice 4* hotel, with efficient and helpful staff, a nice pool and walkable distance to Dublin centre, based on our experience we would definitely stay again.",4,2012,05,02
240,such a noisy hotel,"I normally dont write reviews when travelling on business as I dont pay for the room but felt I had to add a note on this hotel. Arriving at 10.30pm check in was very quick, straight to the room. Instantly hit by a loud whiny noise from fan in the bathroom, waited 20 minutes and it kept going, seemed to be coming from the sort of plant room in between the two rooms, down to reception and the lady said she would move me to a quiet room.  The new room was at the end of the hotel, though the fan was much quieter it there was still a little noise, problem was that this room the noise from outside was even worse, every time something big passed the room there was a massive whooshing noise, not a restful sleep at all, the hotel needs some better double glazing. 

Breakfast was very good and plentiful, checkout quick and efficient, if you book this hotel and want a good night‚Äôs sleep make sure you take some ear plugs.",3,2012,04,28
240,excellent hotel,"This is a lovely Hilton property.Room was clean, spacious and well appointed. internet service was flawless. The breakfast was a huge meal - anything you could want. Staff was pleasant and very helpful.",5,2012,04,24
240,Good location,"This hotel is perfect for sightseeing in Dublin, being located directly opposite Kilmainham Gaol & the stop for the ""hop-on hop-off "" bus. Don't forget to start with the gaol!
The hotel itself is fine, nothing special but clean & comfortable. Dinner in the restaurant was excellent & they pull a great pint of Guinness! Staff were friendly & efficient. Our room was standard for this class of hotel, reasonably sized with good bath & shower, again nothing special. 
Dublin is perfect for being out-&-about, use the Luas (tram system) the buses & Dart (local train system) - all are cheap & convenient. Tickets for the sightseeing buses last for two days & cover everything you'd want to see....if you have the stamina!",4,2012,04,23
240,If your looking for fault you won't find it.,From check in to check out our mid week expierence went far beyond our expectation. The room meet all our needs and provided a great view by night. The food was beautiful and catered to how I liked to eat plain and tasty all about taste. Last but for me most important the staff from breakfast to late night bar made me feel like I was important to them. A young man at the bar gave great entertainment an conversation for me and my friends every evening. Needless to say we booked to stay again this year hope I can write an equally good review but I'm confident I will.,5,2012,04,22
240,A very good business focussed hotel,"I stayed at the Hilton Kilmainham for two nights & will probably stay again when I next return.  My room was what you'd expect from a good quality business hotel - the bed was very large & comfortable, the room quite a decent size, the bathroom fine - a shower over the bath, standard toiletries etc.  Breakfast was very good - a selection of fruits, cold meats/cheese, breads and cooked breaksfast - I ate out, so can't comment on the restaurant.
The staff were very friendly, check in & out was prompt.  The hotel was very clean and everything looked modern & new.  The lifts need your room card to work (I wasn't sure whether to be reassured by this security measure, or wonder why they had installed it).
Overall, a very good business class hotel - nothing outstanding to make me say ""WOW"", but very professional.",4,2012,04,21
240,Hilton but a little disappointed,"Maybe expected more from a Hilton. It was nice and clean, hot water was a nightmare. All hot and no cold. Staff was ok. Housekeeping was excellant-gave us everything we asked for. Pub food was ok and breakfast was all one needed. A little out of the way but a cheap cab fare where ever you needed to go.",4,2012,04,16
240,Great overall experience,"Touring with Globus who booked this hotel, but with a group of independent travel agents. Absolutely a fantastic hotel and staff experience especially talking to Bryan about Dublins highlights. Beds were very comfortable, hotel looked new, dinner and pub food was very good. Right across from Kilmainham Gaol (jail) which should be a must see for those interested in Irelands history. Seems as though all Irish breakfasts we've had in hotels so far are about the same, but this hotel exceeded other experiences. The only negative comment is that the location is quite a walk from tourist areas. But only ten to fifteen minutes from Heuston train station. It's 1.90 euro exact change bus fare to other Dublin locations. You can tour quite a bit of Dublin on your own and need about three days. So stay in Dublin a few days on your own, preferably after your tour to eliminate duplication of sights.",4,2012,04,15
240,This is the email I responsed to the Hilton hotels when they asked me to review my stay!!,"Upon check in the receptionist did not take any heed to what I had advised, (I had told her I would pay upfront with cash and she proceeded to ask for a credit card once I produced it she then advised I would NEED to pay upfront completely discarding what I had just advised). She gave no information on local transport sights or anything really and there is no guestbook in any room to help you out. Once we got to the room the bed was 2 singles pushed together, I went to reception and asked if there was any room available that had a double mattress on the single bases, she advised that this is standard but she would get house keeping to check, I got a call to the room to advise that there was indeed a room available and  we were moved, upon checking in to the new room I check the bed, it was the exact same. At this point I felt by saying this again to reception I would have gotten no where as the receptionist was quite abrupt. When we went to the bar for food I asked the waitress if we could have a drink, she then went to say 'It's Good Friday we don't serve drink', I then proceeded to advise that as we were residents we were told we could have a drink with our meal, she then proceeded to ask if we were residents. Surely this would have been her first response to my request. The menu had only meat or fish options. As it was Good Friday I wasn't eating meat and I don't eat fish, I felt there should have been an alternative on the menu for the day that was in it. I did ask the waitress if an egg sandwich was possible and it was. The portion sizes were atrocious. My husband had gotten fish and chips which consisted of 5/6 chips, I had gotten a portion of chips and again only 5/6. We went for breakfast on the Saturday morning at around 8.30. The food on the hotplates such as the beans, sausage and egg were cold. The staff of a 4 star hotel were wearing jeans. The breakfast on the Sunday morning was warmer though. On the Saturday night we went to the bar and I was given a glass with a chip on it, this glass had past 2 of your staff (bar person and table service staff). I went to the bar and a manager came up to me and rectified the situation but with everything else it just topped off what I can only describe as an extremely disappointing stay. On check out the same receptionist asked my husband about the stay, he responded with 'alright', she didn't acknowledge his disapproving tone. Overall I have never been so dishearten with a hotel visit.",1,2012,04,11
240,Good for city break,"I stayed in the Hilton Kilmainham for 2 nights over St Patrick's weekend.  
I choose the hotel due to Dublin being very busy that weekend and most things were booked out as usually I much prefer boutique hotels to large chains.  Decor wise the hotel and indeed the bedroom was the standard generic business hotel.  It is evidently primarily a conference hotel.

All that said, we had a lovely time.  I emailed prior asking for an early check in, 10 am and the room was ready.  The employees were super polite and helpful.

Breakfast was a large buffet with all the usual options and we also had a nightcap in the hotel bar one evening which was also well stocked.

The one thing that I think probably lets it down in the spa, it's a lovely little area but with no slippers and robes was a bit awkward getting back to our rooms.  

Location wise it's good.  I went to college in Dublin and know the city and indeed area well.  It is a 10/15 minute walk from Heuston, the train station that goes south, it also has a Luas stop and is the final destination for the airport bus.  We walked from there as I had forgotten quite how far Kilmainham jail is (the hotel is across the road) but it would be just ‚Ç¨5 in a cab.  There are buses into town every 5 minutes from a stop 2/3 mins from the hotel or it is a mile to walk.",4,2012,04,11
240,Good few days aways,"We stayed at the Hilton Kilmainham for the first few days in March on a travelzoo deal. The room was very pleasant, clean and the hotel staff we very friendly. The pool in the hotel was very nice but on our second visit we were told we had to wear caps in the main pool.

The breakfast at the hotel was good but we had a long wait for the dinner eventhough the restaurant was not busy. 

I would recommend visiting the Italian restaurant which is across the street from the hotel. It was very easy to get into the centre of dublin as there are regular busses nearby. 

Overall the trip was great value for money and I would return for a short visit.",4,2012,04,10
240,Lovely hotel - poor location,"Hotel is lovely - really modern with spacious rooms, comfy beds and modern furniture. The staff were also great, helping us out with a few problems we encountered on our trip. However, my night was disturbed by a room that was way too warm, a problem that i couldn't resolve with the AC. We didn't avail of the restaurant services and did not use the breakfast on offer. 

Unfortunately the location was not ideal - the hotel was quite a bit away from the James's tram stop - a good 10 - 15 min walk, which was a pain with very heavy luggage.",4,2012,04,09
240,Overall very nice,We stayed our last three nights in Dublin at the Hilton Kilmainham.  It is a beautiful hotel.  The beds were comfortable and the rooms clean.  Showers in Ireland are just plain interesting. The tubs are narrow and they stand taller than we are used to.  Climbing out you must be careful not to slip. The breakfast in the hotel restaurant offered plenty of choices of food to start your day. The visit to the jail across the street was a trip highlight.  Allow yourself a few hours to tour it.,4,2012,04,07
240,Comfy hotel let down by poor food,"This hotel is a little outside of the centre and is opposite the Kilmainham Gaol, so it is on the tourist open top tour bus route, which gets you into the centre and to all the tourist spots. There is very little else around the hotel. Nowhere to eat or drink - and that puts the hotel's restaurant and bar food under the spotlight. I have already reviewed Cinnamon, the restaurant, and was not impressed. The bar food did nothing to change my mind.

That said, the hotel is in excellent condition; it looks quite new and is well maintained, very clean and the room we stayed in was extremely comfy. There was a great kingsized bed, a comfy chair and a nice view out of the panoramic window into a park. The hotel has a secure underground car park and, being slightly out of the centre, allows you to come and go easily, with good access onto the motorway and main roads without hitting the worst of the city centre traffic. Whilst the room had free wired broadband, there was no wifi - although there was in the reception area and this was also free.",4,2012,04,07
240,"Fantastic hotel, good location near the zoo, park and jail tour.","We stayed in this hotel with our 10 month old baby. They had the cot all set up in the room for us. The hotel looks to be very new, it is extremely clean and welcoming. The restaurant was excellent for both dinner and breakfast. Parking was on site. It is literally right across the street from the Kilmainham jail and it was an easy walk to the park and zoo. The bed was extremely comfortable. I really loved this hotel. The pool was excellent as well. It's a hydrotherapy pool which was quite unique but we took the baby in there with no problem. I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Dublin who doesn't necessarily need to stay right in the city center. My one complaint was that the mini-fridge in our room wasn't working. Other than that, everything was excellent.",5,2012,04,03
240,"Excellent hotel , great value deal","Stayed here for 2 nights with friends through excellent travelzoo deal . Would have been good without the deal as rooms are a good size , modern & clean . The breakfast choice is excellent & the staff friendly & helpful . On the hop on hop off bus route & opposite the kilmainham jail , the tour of which is excellent .",5,2012,03,28
240,Great hotel and great value,"My Mother and I stayed here in January for 1 night with my 14 year old sister and my 2 children aged 10 & 6. We were attending the 7up winter wonderland. I had stayed in it's sister hotel in Limerick the Strand Hotel the previous year and really enjoyed it. I have to say the Hilton in Kilmainham is great. Close to the city, staff really friendly, rooms spotless and food lovely. Great stay and look forward to going back again.",4,2012,03,27
240,Food wasnt great.,"We stayed here 23+24 march. We had dinner in the hotel restaurant on the saturday evening and really wish we hadnt, it was of a very poor standard. When we told the manager and the waitress about our food, they ""thanked us for our feedback"", not even an apology. Then when i went to get my car out of the car park on sunday, there was a flood and my car was right in the middle of a puddle about 7 inches deep. I had to remove socks and shoes and wade out to my car to move it. When i got back up to reception to check out and told the staff what had happened i was told, ""you should have waited, we have someone coming to clear the water"" and just stood and stared at me, not even an apology - and i didnt have time to hang about all day waiting for someone to arrive. I was glared at like i had done something wrong. The positive is that the hotel has a great pool and the rooms are clean, but i will not stay here again.",3,2012,03,26
240,Paddys Day 2012,"Great Hotel the staff are very helpful and a great variety for breakfast., Rooms and bathroom are lovely so is the cleanliness.
Central to bus stop to the town centre but not alot going on near the hotel except for one bar / eating pace.",4,2012,03,21
240,Almost Perfect,"I flew in for St. Paddy's day weekend, and this hotel was just what I wanted.  The rooms are huge (at least by European standards), clean, and comfy, and the location is perfect (away from the noisy, crowded city center, but a short, cheap ride on the city bus line will take you right there, or the hop-on-hop-off tours stop just across the street).  The staff was wonderful-- friendly, knowledgeable about the area, and able to pre- arrange taxi and/or airport transportation (if possible, ask for Brian from Corporate Taxi Service.  He's awesome and is also available for tours).  They also held our luggage after check-out, which gave us the chance to enjoy a few more hours out in Dublin.
If I had one complaint, it was the room service; it was fast and friendly, but my pizza tasted like it came from a box and was rather un-delicious.  However, to be fair, I ordered off the after-hours menu; regular hours have a wider selection and the food might be of better quality.  Still, the room and staff service more than made up for the pizza; I would stay again in a heartbeat and would recommend it to anyone.",5,2012,03,21
240,"Clean, friendly staff, great location, great room.","The staff was so friendly and kind to us, and took great care of us. Brian, the concierge, was so helpful and kind. He gave us great directions and a great list of things to do. He even gave us one of his own electrical converters so that we wouldn't have to go shopping for one. The staff was probably the kindest and most helpful people that I've ever experienced in all of my stays throughout the world. The room was open, airy and modern. And we had so much fun in Dublin. What a great City to visit. We're coming back to the Kilmainham Hilton.",5,2012,03,20
240,Centre of relaxation in busy Dublin,"Both Ailish & I stayed here a year after we last stayed in the same hotel for a romantic weekend away as well as going to a Scouting Ireland meeting.  We left Kilkenny early on Saturday morning to get to Dublin so that we had the full day to experience some of the historical sites tickets that we bought beforehand.  We had tickets for the Book of Kells and Guinness's Storehouse.  After checking in we travelled through the Royal Hospital of Kilmainham that still had its Christmas fair on with plenty of visitors and looked great at night.  Got the Luas to near Trinity College to visit the Book of Kells and then the bus to Guinness Storehouse.  Both get places to visit and would highly recommend them.  As for the hotel we had a great stay with a lovely room on the top floor with a great view of Dublin and made full use of the swimming pool both that evening and the following morning.  On Saturday we had a lovely evening meal in the front bar with lovely surroundings and the service was good.  We would both highly recommend this hotel for anyone wanting a city centre hotel within easy reach of the bus routes, train station and main roads.  We loved staying there and hopefully will be back again soon for a weekend stay to solely relax and see the full sites of Dublin .",5,2012,03,12
240,Great Break,"Brilliant 2 night break staff couldnt be more helpful,food at night above average but well presented and breakfsats brilliant really good value,would stay again.Hop on Hop Off bus just opposite andticket  lasts 48 hours just used this to see everything!  Our taxi driver both there and back from hotel was really informative and resonable VIP Driver Brian from coporate Taxi Service just call him and he will take you anywhere.",5,2012,03,08
240,Great Hotel!,This is a new modern hotel with a pool that is a must to experience.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  We were provided with a taxi driver's name (Brian) who was extremely knowledgeable of the city and friendly....he actually gave us money back when he thought we were tipping him too much.  The hotel is located on the outskirts of Dublin but you have plenty of transportation options to get you into the City Centre.  There's a local pub called The Patriots Inn located across the street from the hotel where you can experience true locals.  A plus is they have a great Italian restaurant located upstairs of the pub.,5,2012,03,06
240,Fabulous hotel!,"Just spent two nights at the Hilton and couldn't have asked for anything better.  All the staff were  friendly and attentive, the food was excellent as was the hotel room and spa.  The location is great, right opposite the Kilmainham gaol, and a short walk to the Guinness factory.  The bus stop is just across the road from the hotel making easy access to the city centre. Couldn't fault this hotel and would definitely recommend it to those visiting the fantastic city of Dublin!",5,2012,03,04
240,"Great Stay, would go back again","Hotel very classy as you enter it, the rooms are spacious and very tastefully decorated, we went for an upgrade and got a room with our own balcony.  However had a problem in the bathroom only hot water worked, there was no room change offered when I mentioned this problem (sadface).  However nice location if you do not want to stay in the city centre, stay here, 10 mins on the bus into the centre.",4,2012,02,27
240,Lovely for a city break touched with luxury!!,"Finding the hotel is slightly difficult as it is on a back street however if you remember your sat nav (we forgot ours) then you will have no pronblem finding it!!
There is scarce parking and the car park is fairly tight but you pay 12euro at the hotel then parking is unlimitied which is cheap for city centres.
Check in was fast and our room was ready straight away, The room and corridors were delightful and very safe as you have to use your key to work the lifts and doors to corridors, The room was spotless, decorated to a high standard with lovely floor to ceiling windows and a fab bathroom with lovely toiletrys.
Staff were helpful and breakfast was lovely. The main point that delighted us was the swimming pool and spa, which was mood light and very warm, the jacuzzi was so hot my partener fell asleep.
Over all we had a lovely stay and have recommended the hotel to family and friends and would def return.",5,2012,02,27
240,Close to Dublin Zoo and Phoenix Park,"Located straight across from Kilmainam Jail and close to Dublin Zoo. We travelled with our six year old son to visit Dublin zoo. Hotel advised they are the closest hotel. Not much else in the area but very close to centre of Dublin. 
We booked a family room and it was clean and spacious. The bathroom had a bath and a seperate shower. Only problem was the air con. Got too hot over night but thankfully we were able to open a window.
Our son loved the hydrotherapy pool and playing in the water jets. 
Ate in the hotel bar as not much else in area. Our expierence was good and our son loved his fish cake off the childrens menu. Breakfast was standard fare.
We used the hotel underground car park. Saw a lot of cars clamped outside our room by 0715 in the morning. Not worth the risk and would have made it a very expensive trip.",4,2012,02,25
240,Nearly Excellant,"We went to Dublin on a short break through Travelzoo as a birthday treat for my hubby. Had no problems flying from Liverpool airport and got the 747 Airbus from outside the arrivals.The bus stopped at Heuston Train station (the last stop) and we had to walk from there, it was a good 15 mins walk to the hotel once we got to the hotel we were very impressed the check in was efficient and very professional and the room was lovely. We came back down and had complementary tea and scones which were very nice and then we decided to walk into the center it took us an hour and we are both quite fit and under 40!! after two days of this i had had enough and gave up. Overall we had a good few days and visited some good attractions although we also on our walks to and from the hotel ended up in some parts of Dublin that might intimidate older people, Beggars, Drug addicts and homeless. I am not sure whether i would rush to return perhaps if we stayed central our experience might have been different.",4,2012,02,22
240,Rooms great. Restaurant food dreadful.,"We saw a special on a website advertising family break offers, but when we tried to book it online it wasn't available on the Hilton website.  I rang the hotel and they apologized saying that the deal was over and that they would have the advert removed, although the advert is still running even now, advertising that it will run to March 2012.  The hotel agreed to honor the rate, which was approximately 320 euro for 2 nights for 2 adults and 2 children in interconnecting room, including breakfast on both mornings and one evening meal.

Thankfully the deal didn't include evening meal on both nights as the food in the restaurant was appalling.  We had breakfast both mornings and I stuck to bacon both mornings as the sausages were so disgusting that even my 5 year old refused to taste his!  The toaster was a slow roll through one that was set at a heat setting that undercooked the bread, and when we passed it through again, it burned.  Very unimaginative selection of (tinned fruit), and the worst coffee I've ever had.  We just hoped that dinner would be an improvement.  It wasn't.
My vegetable soup starter was almost cold, and seemed to be half water, half pureed carrot. I added some of the chilli dip that came with my children's starters to add some much needed flavour.  My kids didn't like their kids menu starter choice so we ordered chicken wings, thinking they might try them.  We asked for just one portion between the two children.  We were brought two extremely large portions of wings and thighs, fried in their skins, and dripping with excess oil.  Neither of our kids would eat them.  I tried one, but it was disgusting.  My husband had 3 or 4 to take the bad look off the kids not eating them.  We returned the rest, approximately a dozen of them, uneaten.  The waitress didn't think to ask why they weren't eaten.  She didn't appear to care.

For mains, my fish was so bland that I didn't even eat half of it.  My husband tried it and agreed with me.  He said the same of his roast of the day (ham).  My daughter asked for a chicken burger without veg or chips or potatoes.  We ordered bangers (no mash) for my son despite the breakfast sausages being awful, which we asked for without chips or vegetables.  We asked for some toasted sliced white bread instead.  My son is autistic so he is very restricted in what he will eat.  We knew he'd eat toast though.  The kids were brought the chicken burger with salad and a plate of chips, and sausages with a bread roll and chips.  My son didn't touch his as it was the same dreadful sausages as breakfast time, and he'd wanted toast, not a bread roll.  My daughter picked the salad off her burger and ate half of it.  Neither of them like chips, so my husband and I had some of the two plates of them that were put on the table regardless.  The chips were actually the only nice thing we had to eat in the hotel (other than the bacon at breakfast).  The waitress obviously didn't pass our specific requests to the kitchen, so we waited until we were back in our room to order and pay for toast through room service.  So we paid for toast because the restaurant wouldn't or couldn't provide it when we asked for it.

The reception staff were very friendly, s were the bar staff and room service staff and the girls who brought us to our table in the mornings.

The rooms were modern, spacious and clean.  The bathroom in the connecting room was obviously designed for someone with a physical disability, with handrails, and a corner shower with a large shower curtain to pull around.  The fridge in one room was locked shut and the one in the other room was open but switched off.  It would have been nice to have had a working fridge in the room.  The pay movies channels were not available when we tried them on the first night, but were on the second night.

The hotel charged our room upfront on check-in, and we had to pay our extras as we went along as the hotel doesn't allow you to accrue charges against a debit card.  Some hotels will pre-authorize your card and trust you to settle your bill at the end.  Not the Hilton Kilmainham.

Incidentally the carpark charge was more expensive than advertised on the hotel website, which they told me was only a recent price hike that was long overdue.  It was still good value for parking, and you definitely need a car to get to the hotel, or be prepared to travel by taxi, bus or Luas (tram).  We found it easy to cope without the car once there.  We used the Luas.  The area isn't very nice, and there aren't many restaurants nearby, but plenty in the City centre.  There's a garage just beyond the hotel with a cash machine inside, which is very handy.  Unless the upstairs Italian restaurant diagonally across the crossroads from the hotel has changed dramatically in the last 2 years, avoid it too. Terrible food there too!  Take the Luas (the stop is 5 mins walk up the street, beyond the garage), into town for a great selection of restaurants.

The bar service was great at the hotel, and they had no problem allowing us to take glasses of wine up to the room, as the kids didn't want to have to sit in a bar.  In Ireland most hotels have a curfew of kids being allowed to be in bars of 9pm anyway.

Anyway.  This was my 3rd or 4th stay in this hotel, and The issues with the food weren't evident the previous times I stayed (mid 2009 to mid 2010), so I can only assume that the restaurant itself has changed chef or management.  

I would recommend the hotel on a room only basis.  I wouldn't eat in the restaurant again, and certainly not for evening meals. The food isn't cheap, and was dreadful!",3,2012,02,22
240,Decent,"I stayed here on a Travelzoo deal, 2 nights plus breakfast, 1 evening meal, tea and scones, tickets to guiness storehouse, late checkout, bottle of wine ¬£200. Although I liked the hotel itself and staff it did get a bit annoying to pay for taxis in and out if town. I did get a good deal though so it all balanced out in the end. Would stay again but keep an eye out for any special offers.
",4,2012,02,19
240,Dublin stay,Hilton dublin kilmainham was a lovely hotel on hop on/off bus routes and bus no.40 just around corner took you to O'Connell street. Great carpark at reasonable rate. We went on a Travel ZOO deal and was greated by friendly staff who had prepared vouchers for meals and free entry to local attractions and wine in our room. Although slightly out of town it did not feel too far away because of good public transport. Easy to drive to/from as M50 is close by - dont to forget to pay your toll.,4,2012,02,17
240,"Nice, modern hotel on the outskirts of Dublin","Stayed here for a two night weekend trip to Dublin. It's a little way out of town, but we paid much less than staying in the centre, and we had a deal that included a bottle of wine and dinner on one night. Well worth every penny, staff were friendly, hotel was clean, quiet, and comfy.

We had a two-course dinner on the first night. Food was good rather than spectacular, and the portions were huge.

Breakfast is good, served up until 11am at the weekend and checkout is midday, very handy if you've had a late night in the city centre!

Parking is ‚Ç¨10/night, but there's free weekend on street parking about 50m further along the road.

It's next door to the old Kilmainham jail, now a really interesting tourist attraction (I learnt plenty about Irish history). It's a long walk into town, only worth doing if you're stopping at the Guinness Storehouse on the way, in which case you can walk through the grounds of the modern art museum opposite the hotel. Otherwise expect to pay ‚Ç¨10 for a taxi.",4,2012,02,13
240,Out of Town - but on the mark,"Although a bit too far out of town to walk [we used the hop-on, hop-off bus and taxis] the facilities were great for our stay.
We arrived and were greeted pleasantly before heading up to our room -nothing out of the ordinary. We headed down to the bar- and had a light snack. So impressed by that - we booked our evening meal in the restaurant. This was really very good - good choice and well cooked and presented.
There was plenty of choice at breakfast, with quick service on tea coffee etc. Just dissappointed to have hot food being kept warm - but in plentiful supply and poached eggs cooked fresh to order made my husband happy!!",3,2012,02,13
240,Rugby Weekend,"Great Hotel, we had paid for upgrade on room and worth every penny (or cent!) 10 euro.
Excellent quality of room with the most comfortable bed spotless throughout. Staff were extremely helpful and obviously well trained.
Would recommend but yes, a little out of the city but has great park nearby to walk through that brings you straight to main station with great bus and tram line into centre (fares very cheap).",5,2012,02,11
240,Very good but expensive.,"Close to the lovely Phoenix Park and Dublin Zoo, this hotel was very good, clean and comfortable. For me, working in Dublin 8, it's a great location. However, in general it is too far from the city centre to justify the cost of rooms and 10 euros per night for parking. You also need to pay for buses or taxis to and from the heart of Dublin. Food was average. I spent 4 nights here and then moved on to another hotel nearby, simply because of the costs. Otherwise no complaints about the actual hotel and staff were very friendly and polite.",4,2012,02,11
240,Just OK!,"Hotel staff very friendly, room nice, breakfast disappointing, choice of food good but cold. Would have expected more from a Hilton hotel. It cost us approx ‚Ç¨10 to travel into and out of city centre each way.  You definitely wouldn't walk into city centre. Duvet was made of feathers which I am alergic to so that wasn't great!",3,2012,02,09
240,Good hotel,"This hotel was clean and staff were friendly. Unfortunately we missed breakfast but did eat in the restaurant at lunch and the food was nice.The only negative comment i would give is that this hotel is not good for a central city trip , it is a long way from the shops etc and we had to get taxis throughout the trip. All in all a good hotel.",4,2012,02,05
240,Disappointing!,"My husband and I stayed for a night in this hotel and we were disappointed in the food (terrible) and the overall standard in the hotel. Standards in Irish hotels are normally much better than Europe and we picked the Hilton because of its name and the fact it had a pool- the pool was tiny!... And with the poor quality of food we would have been better off at a cheaper hotel- of which there are many!
Would we return? No, thanks!",3,2012,02,04
240,Great value for money.,"Just returned back from what i can only describe as an fantastic weekend. On arrival to our hotel i found the member of staff exceptionally helpful and polite. Our room was available straight away,bearing in mind we arrived at 9am and room wouldn't usually be available until 3pm. Everything within our stay was superb. All staff were very polite and friendly,room was very clean. The hotel is very quiet at night so a good night sleep will be experienced...especially as the bed is so comfy. We stayed at this hotel through Travelzoo,In my opnion money spent on this trip was worth every penny....I would definitely recommend a stay at this hotel.",5,2012,01,31
240,Outstanding staff and value for money,"Due to our traveling plan, we have chosen this hotel as it is close to Heuston Station. By close, I mean you need a cab to get from Heuston Station to hotel, walking there is pretty far by Asian standard.

Let's start from the check in, it was prompt and the staff on duty, Tanja, was excellent and for the next few days, she has won me over with her great service. 

Coming to the room, it was nice with a good view as I was given a room on the top floor. The spacious room was well done up and the only complain I had was the bath room which has a standing shower which is quite badly done up which means every time you shower, the whole floor gets wet!! However credit has to be given for making it handicapped friendly.

The hydrotherapy pool is another bonus factor of the hotel which makes it though almost impossible to swim but makes it real realxed after a day of sightseeing.

Breakfast was good as well though it can get bored after eating the same food for a few days.

Generally, the service level of the staff is one of the main reason that makes the hotel stood up and is highly recommended.

Location wise, it is only 5 mins drive to Heuston Station and about 10-15 mins by car to City which will cost you about Euro 15 or less.",4,2012,01,31
240,Awesome room but...,"Just stayed here for business this week. Upon arrival I've been given one of the deluxe rooms with balcony, I didn't complain for sure, especially because I was paying a special business rate (or so I thought).
My rate also included the internet.
And this is where the good bit ends:
- the internet was so slow it was almost unusable most of the time, and simply going upstairs would disconnect it and you'd have to re-enter the connection details 5-6 times a day.
- the food was substandard both for breakfast and dinner, compared to any other Hilton I've been at.
- Even if I'm gold member I've only been given a bottle of water on the first day
- The minibar was completely empty for the entire duration of my stay
- The cleaners would fold up damp towels and leave them in the bathroom, no chance for them to dry up
- One night the smoke alarm went off in the entire hotel about 7 times, 2 of which after 23, which almost gave me a heart attack, while I was sleeping
- To finish it off, when checking out, the bill was for a standard rate which was about ¬£150 higher than what I had booked, so I had to prove the rate I had agreed by showing my reservation emails etc. really embarrassing indeed.

Needless to say that I won't be back here, ever. Really poor show for the Hilton chain, especially when you'd expect a certain degree of consistency amongst their hotels. The Charlemont place one is 10 times better in terms of service and food.",2,2012,01,26
240,Outstanding staff and will definitely return,"This was booked as a business trip for my husband and I. First impressions, hotel reception staff very welcoming and informative. Beautiful modern hotel, welcoming, spotlessly clean. We ate in the bar and the food was very reaonably priced as were the drinks. Special thanks go to Gary, he had a badge saying trainee. His attitude was exceptional. Very helpful, friendly and nothing was too much trouble.

Spa was very nice, again as were the staff in there. Nice equipped gym also.

Hotel is only a ten minute bus ride into the centre, we caught the no 13 bus, just a very short walk to the bus stop into the main town. We also ate at the Italian just across the road from the hotel which was very nice. Traditional Italian, home cooked food.

All in all I can definitely recommend this hotel, Dublin has so many friendly people. Cannot wait to go back and it will certainly be to this hotel. Best Hilton we have stayed in.",5,2012,01,21
240,Not central but close to Heuston,"Normally we would stay closer to the centre of town, but on our recent trip to Ireland chose to stay here because we had to travel west and back by train so needed to be close to Heuston Station (15 minutes walk). In fact the location is OK for the city too because the bus stop is  close by and you can walk to Temple Bar in about 40 minutes. The hotel is a typical modern Hilton so expect the rooms to be immaculate. One gripe though: we arrived at around 11 pm so headed for the bar for a bite to eat, only to be told that no more food is served after 10.30! Not even a packet of peanuts! Now had we gone up to our room we could have ordered what we wanted from the 24-hour room service menu, but in the bar? No way Paddy. How Irish can you get? Get your finger out Hilton, improve your catering options!",4,2012,01,20
240,I would stay again but the hotel needs more staff,"I stayed at the Hilton Kilmainham over the 2011/2012 New Year. I would stay here again. First, the location is excellent. 5 minutes to the bus stop and 10 minutes to the tram. I walked to the Guinness factory in about 30 minutes. The rooms are a good size and very clean. Housekeeping staff is excellent. The lobby is not large but it has a nice sitting area with many comfortable seats. Directly across the street are (1) a pub and (2) an Italian restaurant with typical Italian food at reasonable prices. The well-stocked grocery store is only 5 minutes away making it easy to stock the in-room refrigerator.
The hotel‚Äôs major asset is its staff. They really go out of their way to help you. Every email that I sent to the staff prior to my arrival had a very fast return. But, I truly believe that the hotel is short staffed. 

1.	Breakfast. I think the serving staff is understaffed. I had to request coffee multiple times. On one occasion I got up to go to the buffet and when I looked back, they cleaning off my table to seat someone else. The servers were nice and but there were just not enough of them to handle the breakfast traffic. The serving staff appears very busy and constantly ‚Äúrunning‚Äù from table to table. Just be prepared to ask more than once.

2.	The Front Desk. The front desk staff is excellent but again, there just are not enough of them. On many of my interactions with the front desk staff (which revolved around getting more small slips of paper to access the internet‚Äîsee #3 below), I had to wait sometimes up to 10 minutes. Many times there seemed to be only one person behind the desk. Moreover, the front desk staff person was a ‚Äújack of all trades and master of all trades.‚Äù She would do check-in, act as the concierge giving maps and directions to guests, would take guests‚Äô bags if they arrived too early to check-in, etc.). So, imagine needing an internet slip or change for the bus but the people in front of you need directions to the Guinness factory. The staff will give you the time and attention you need even if a line is forming. If you happen to be in the line, be prepared to wait.  

3.	 The internet. Yes, when I am on vacation, I want full access to the internet. The internet is important to me. I make my living on it. I like being connected. That said, the hotel internet process is complicated, especially if you have more than one device. It would take too long to describe the process (hence the complication) but the bottom line is that the process revolves around small slips of paper.

Other items: It costs 1.65 Euros (exact change required) to take the bus to old town where you find many restaurants serving all types of food, shopping, etc. They even have a Hardrock for those of us that do not like traditional Irish food.",4,2012,01,15
240,Nice hotel in a good location,"We stayed in the Hilton for 3 nights after Christmas. We had no difficulty finding the hotel just head straight for city centre from Newlands cross and its just before Heuston station. The girl at reception was nice and efficient. The room was nice like any hotel room. Had a nice view of Phoenix park from our window. I had two major problems with the room 1: the fan went constantly at night and was so loud and 2: there was no movies available to rent or no DVD player available in the hotel so this meant we were stuck watching Christmas TV. Also the shower was faulty, one minute it was really hot and the next thing it went slightly cold there was no happy medium. The fridge, ice bucket and glasses came in handy though : ).
Location of hotel is very good. Although if you like to eat out you need to head to city centre. Some lovely restaurants around Temple Bar. Just ask at reception they are more than happy to help. We were directly across from the Kilmainham Jail and the Winter Wonderland. We went to the Zoo on the Wednesday and its only a five minute drive from the hotel. On the Thursday we took the luas into the city which is a 10 minute walk from the hotel. There is a Petrol station located two minutes from hotel for any essentials or a Spar further up the road.
Breakfast was nice a little cold on some mornings and finished at 10 which is a bit early for Christmas holidays!!! We had lunch in the bar one of the days and it was lovely. On one night we had dinner in the restaurant we found the choice on the menu wasn't great and the food was only ok. Drink was also very expensive in the bar.

Tip: Make sure to put your DO NOT DISTURB SIGN ON THE DOOR..otherwise expect a knock from housekeeping at 9am!!",4,2012,01,11
240,Perfect for a restful vacation,"The hotel was the perfect place to get away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. With its sauna and pool and nice big lounges and bar areas this provided us with what we were looking for. The hotel is abit of a distance from the city centre although close to the prison and guiness storehouse. Its about a 5 minute walk to the Luas red line Suir Road stop and then 10 minutes by tram into the city (1.80 Euros for a single ticket, 6 Euros for a day card). A taxi to the city centre is about 10 Euros and 6 Euros to the train station. The hotel breakfast was quite substantial and had everything one would need. The dinner was quite nice with one or two dishes and the desert assortment being abit lacking. We stayed on a Travelzoo special which included free wine in our room (and the hotel was kind enough to let us take that down to dinner), free coffee and scones, tickets to the Guiness storehouse and free dinner on one night. All in all an amazing stay. The reception staff were very friendly and helpful with directions and information. As were the waiting staff in the restaurant and bar. The prices in the bar and the room service menu were abit steep but there are a few good pubs and restaurants nearby that provides good food and drink. Definitely recommended and I will stay here again even with the distance from the centre because of the amenities and the quiet.",4,2012,01,09
240,Nice hotel poor service,Staff in bar and resteraunt very dismissive food wasn't great either. Rooms are lovely. ,2,2012,01,05
240,Family meeting in Dublin,"Due to my daughter, her husband and seven month old son living in Al Ain U.A.E. we do not see them as often as would be liked. As they were spending Christmas with his family in Clonmel R.o.I. we got together in Dublin for the new year. This hotel was far enough out of the city centre to be quiet but only 10 minutes walk rom the tram station into Dublin centre, the bar and restaurant area were clean and tidy and also very baby oriented. The breakfast was very good along with the bar food. The baby also enjoyed the smimming pool and bubble baths. In the adjoining park was a Winter Wonderland Fayre which was enjoyed by all. The only down side to Dublin is that everything is a lot moor expensive than in England, but still a great holiday, would definatley stay here again.",4,2012,01,05
240,Great location for winter wonderland.,Great night on new years eve.  Great location.  Super food.,5,2012,01,04
240,very good,stayed here for 2 nights last week. lovely hotel if a bit out of the way although only 5 mins from luas station[suir rd].spa area very nice pool small.breakfast not as good as hilton at charlemont place maybe because they have lots of american airline staff staying.,4,2012,01,04
240,Very rude very mean,Me and my cousins where staying there while going to winter wonderland and were in the lobby waiting for people to arrive my four year old cousin was walking and by an acsidint nearly broke a vase when a man came over and shouted at her then my one year old cousin was walking around and went to lean on some glass when he fell about two feet he was baling his eyes out we didnt under stand cause we Even thought there was glass there then a receptionist came over and complained about the crying,1,2012,01,02
240,"Good Value, little out of the way but would stay again","Enjoyed this hotel, surprised by how good the value was, although we were there on a deal. Not exactly central, but not too bad in a taxi. Had some bar food as well, and the car park was useful to have.",4,2011,12,31
240,Parking a major problem!,"Parking is a huge problem here, I wish they were more strict on the policy to park here so that people only doing business/ staying here can park here. At the moment the Christmas on ice are using the car park and genuine guests staying here have to park on the street!",3,2011,12,16
240,Kind Staff,"I stayed in this hotel for five days. The first day we had a problem because our room was cold and in December in Dublin this is a serious problem. We said it to the staff and they thought to solve our problem putting a little hover in our room.. We slept all night with the hover which was working but the following morning we told to the staff that sleeping with a hover in a room with mouquette could be very dangerous.. So they understood perfectly and they immediately changed us the room. They were very kind.. 
Also the staff at the restaurant and the bar was very friendly",4,2011,12,11
240,great stay,"just checked out a couple of hours ago i used hilton points for an overnight stay, lovely staff, as is the rooms the hydro pool was great, ate off early bird menu last night very nice, will definately be staying again, nice hotel all round",5,2011,12,08
240,A Top Hotel,"I have stayed in this hotel On countless occasions over the last 18 months and also recommended it to colleagues and friends. It's clean, modern and the staff are all very friendly and very efficient. A special note also goes to Brian (the Hotel's Trip Advisor): great knowledge of the area, a provider of fantastic tours and a really nice man. Another special note also goes to Marco and Des, the friendliest and hardest working barmen in Ireland

John Cunningham",5,2011,12,06
240,Stay at the Hilton Kilmainham,"We had a wonderful stay at the Hilton.  The staff was very polite and helped with amenities as well as money exchanges.  We were introduced to Brian, a driver for the the Hilton, who took the time to tell us about the sights and draw everything out on a map for us. He explained how to get there, what transportation to use if needed, where to shop and was extremely knowledgeable about the city and the history of the area.  Look him up if you stay at the hotel, as he is at your service. The buffett breakfast was excellent.",5,2011,12,01
240,"A little out of the way, but worth it","Got to the hotel around 2:30 after a great cab rid.  Sara and the staff at the hotel were very gracious and welcoming.  Sara helped us get off to a running start with our vacation with some quick suggestions.  We also got help later in the week with dinner suggestions.  Mailed some postcards and the desk took care of postage and mailing them for us, which was very kind.  Really enjoyed our experience.

Pros:
Pool is fantastic, the family loved it.
Directly across from Kilmainham gaol and a nice pub
Hop on/off bus stop directly across the street
Usually taxis available with no waiting
TV was fine
Very hot water, good water pressure in shower
Lots of storage space in closet
Nice family setup with king bed & single
Breakfast setup good with traditional breakfast & eggs cooked to order
Heating / cooling worked great and was quiet

Cons:
- Would have been nice to have some luggage carts handy
- Breakfast gets pretty busy and one day was a bit of chaos",4,2011,11,30
240,Good Hotel with Great Staff (to include VIP Driver) at an affordable price.,"As a Hilton Honors Diamond member I've stayed in quite a few Hilton brand hotels around the world and while this was not the most ""posh"" it was in the top five of my most enjoyable stays. 

Concierge (a.k.a. Mr. O'Reilly)...
My wife and I were in Dublin for a long weekend (Friday - Monday). We arrived at the hotel early on Friday morning (about 1000). Our room wasn't available which was expected but this was more than made up for by Mr. Brian O'Reilly. He is by far the most pleasant Irishman we have ever met and his help made our trip better than it would have been. He sat down with us in the Lobby, got a map of the city and showed us the lay of the city. He provided excellent recommendations and helped us put the finishing touches on the plan we had worked out for our stay. We thought he was the hotel concierge, but we came to find out he is the hotel's VIP driver. So if you need a cab anywhere we highly recommend you ask the hotel to book him as your cab driver, he charges the normal cab fare rates so you are not paying extra for his wonderful service. He knows the city as any true Dubliner should. Since we got there early and didn't have a room he recommended Kilmainham Gaol (jail) while we waited for the room and the recommendation was spot on. We recommend that anyone who is planning on arriving before check in time plan on doing this upon arrival. It's literally right across the street and a perfect way to spend time while the staff of the hotel gets your room ready.

Hotel Staff...
As far as the hotel is concerned, the staff was very pleasant and proactive. We had a problem with our in-room safe (it stopped working, which after staying in over 20 different Hilton brand hotels has never happened) and they solved it in a timely manner and even gave us a box of chocolates for our trouble. I can't say enough about how pleasant the staff was.

Room Quality...
There is nothing special here by worldwide Hilton Standards. It's clean, warm and comfortable. It's not posh by any means. If you typically stay in US hotels this is a pretty average hotel. If you typically stay in European Hotels this is above average. Those who travel overseas know that the room sizes are typically small in Europe. This was like a normal sized US hotel so you'll feel right at home in this hotel.

Location:
You get what you pay for in this category. It's not in the city center of Dublin. But you get a nice hotel at a much lower rate than the comparable hotels in the city center. It is walkable but it takes 45min - an hour to walk all the way downtown. A cab into the city center is about 15 Euro. It is about a 10 min walk to the St. James Hospital Luas Station which is the local tram system in Dublin, this costs 6.00 Euro a day. The best deal my wife and I found (thanks to Mr. O'Reilly) was the Dublin bus system. It is 1.5 blocks from the hotel and it is 1.65 euro for a ten minute ride into the city. Just take the 40 or 13 Route it comes every 10 minutes.    

Bottom Line:
If you don't mind spending a ton of money and want a fancy hotel in the city center don't stay here. If you want to save a little money but still stay in a nice hotel this is the hotel for you. We would stay here again on a future trip to Dublin. While not close to the city center, the public transportation makes it feel close. And best of all, Mr. O'Reilly makes it feel like home.",4,2011,11,29
240,Fantastic place to stay,Stayed here 26th November for my boyfriends birthday and I can't praise the hotel enough.  Convenient to everywhere and easy to find/park etc. Our room wasn't ready when we arrived but was ready within twenty minutes (enough time to enjoy a meal in the bar). The receptionist kindly offered us all late check out to make up for the inconvenience.  Room spotless and breakfast delicious.  Will definitely recommend this hotel to my friends! ,5,2011,11,28
240,One night break,"My husband and I stayed in the Hilton, Kilmaingham last Friday and the only fault was the breakfast was only just warm.

The rooms, general ambience, service of staff esp. front desk was very good.  On checking out I was asked how was my stay. I don't remember being asked that in other hotels and I thanked the girl for asking.

I would def. recommend this hotel for a touch of class.",4,2011,11,28
240,Great sunny winter weekend in Dublin,"Stayed here courtesy of Mr Tesco and his handy clubcard deals...the more central Hilton wasn't available when we booked so we went for this one knowing it was a bit farther out. Hotel is easy to find, very clean and modern, good efficient service, and seems calmly run. The room was spacious and the gigantic bed very comfortable, bathroom had bath and seperate shower and was spotless. It is a bit of a walk into central Dublin but it is doable, and handy for Guinness Storehouse. We parked the car in the hotel car park on arrival and wee happy to leave it there until we heading for home. We used the Luas once and bus once to get to and from the centre of town, but walked most of the time. I would certainly recommend this hotel but just say to be aware of the distance.",4,2011,11,27
240,its a wonderful life...,"Every now and then in life you come across good facilities, at a good price, with nice people and adding it all together goves GREAT value... Hilton Kilmainham is such a place.

Yes it has its foibles, like late drinking has to be on the sofas in the lobby... but who cares, theyre comfy, the night staff are super friendly as well.

Particular note goes out to Sally in reservations, who really does go the extra mile... often making my onward resrvations for me, and researching alternative transport methods... all done with a smile and cheery attitude.

Barstaff are friendly... I could go on... all in all a lovely hotel experience....

not forgetting Brian O'Reilly... Dublins best executive taxi service at normal cab prices",5,2011,11,25
240,Nice stay,"Excellent service, staff is very friendly, SPA and gym are just perfect and for any advice you need always ask for Brian at the reception, he knows the city in and out and he can take you anywhere with always a smile and kind service.",5,2011,11,21
240,Great Stay at the Kilmainham Hilton in Dublin,"Me and my wife were looking for a nice romantic city break in Dublin and chose this hotel because of the fact that its not slap bang in the middle of the city.  Our room was extremely spacious and was everything you'd expect from a Hilton room.  To be honest I was a bit surprised at some of the reviews left by other guests stating that it is only a 3 star hotel, I can assure you that this is NOT true.  The staff were all very friendly and polite and did everything they could to ensure we had a good stay.  We were lucky enough to chat with ""Brian"" whose name you'll find mentioned in a lot of the reviews on this site.  He was a lovely man who actually went out of his way to provide us with invaluable information about the city, which parts to visit, where to dine, where to shop, etc.  If you want to make the most out of your trip to Dublin and are planning to do so in a short space of time Brian's your man.  One minor niggle was the free WIFI in the room which required a username and password that expired on a daily basis but this was easily remedied by calling reception and getting a new one over the phone.  That's the only con i can think of if you can actually class it as a con, everything else was absolutely fantastic and I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to anyone...",5,2011,11,20
240,Pleasant Stay,"My husband and I stayed here the last two nights of our 2 week trip to  Europe. The room and bed were comfortable. Having free wif-fi was a plus. The staff were helpful and polite.  The buffet breakfast was delicious.  Close walking distance to sight seeing.
Sorry we didn't get a chance to use the pool which looked fantastic.
Would stay here again.",4,2011,10,31
240,Good Warm Hotel,"Stayed at this hotel a few months back. Traveled with work staying 3 nights and between colleagues we booked 30+ rooms. The hotel is modern and welcoming, the rooms were all spacious with a contemporary feel and quite cosy. 

Plenty of TV channels if you are bored or if you need to work, there was a desk area where you could connect your laptop, free wifi was available and a business suite behind reception if you needed to print anything. 

The bar/restaurant area was lively in the evenings and you were close enough to the city if you wanted to venture out and sample the Dublin night life or visit the Guinness Store House. 

My experience at this hotel was really positive, the staff were friendly and accommodated many of our requests.",5,2011,10,29
240,Good Hotel with Minor Glitches,"If you want to stay in a nice Hotel that is close to the city and Heuston Station, this is it. Walking distance to the LUAS and the rooms are big enough for a small family (2 adults 1 child). I will say that the pool is amazing and my son and I spent hours in there playing the day away. There are lots of jets around and buttons to push so a four year old boy was in heaven.  I have to give 3* though because of two very annoying little problems. Firstly, the heat of our room was absolutely unbelievable. I tried to get air con working and it just wasn't. In fairness to the staff though they did what they could and brought us two fans which helped. Second, on our last morning there we were told we weren't booked for breakfast and nearly stopped even though we had paid for 3night BB. It wasn't a big deal as the receptionist was lovely and apologetic about the whole situation. Parking is good value and very secure. The staff are very nice and helpful with the obligatory grumpy server being present. I don't understand all the negativity from other reviewers as I will be staying here whenever we come up from Cork.  Breakfast Buffet was adequate and as far as most 4* go fairly standard for Ireland. Previous reviews are not very constructive and I know most hotels in Ireland cutbacks and competition have made for a hard time lately. This is a good established brand and definitely worth a stay if only for the ease of commute and nice staff!!",4,2011,10,26
240,Very good hotel,"This hotel is very nice, with an efficient staff. The food is good and cheap and the rooms are well cleaned and are overall nice to be in. The downside are limited such as no hair dryer in the bathroom or a horrible tv system. If you need a guide or a cab be sure to ask for Brian. This truly Irish man will make your trip in his cab worthwhile and can advice you on what to see in Ireland. ",4,2011,10,26
240,Not worthy of the 4* mark 3* at best,"Just returned from a night at the Hilton Kilmainham for my birthday. We booked room only, with the option of paying an extra 10E each for breakfast and 10E for parking. I think the parking should be complimentary. 

We had never stayed in a Hilton before, and had this perception that it was worldclass, as they have many hotels around the world, boy were we wrong!!!

When we arrived there was no welcoming to the hotel at reception, no hospitality what so ever, the blonde foreign receptionist failed to tell us that when using the lift that you would have to use your room key to activate the lift, unaware of this we got in the lift and pressing the buttons they would light up then go off and we where stuck in the lift for about 3-5 mins, when we exited the lift, still hadn't moved anywhere the receptionist still failed to inform us of this, so we went into the other lift, and then they had a small notcice to say to use room key. 
How helpfull and courteous are the staff supposed to be??? None here anyway, and not one irish staff member did we notice in the whole of the hotel .

The bed was very low to the ground and the mattress was very squeaky and soft , I could not get a comfartable nights sleep with all the squeaking from the mattress. When we looked out the window there was a huge metal guard that covered the whole side of the building, it felt like you were in prison, I have no idea what purpose it serves? its certainly not appealing architecture if thats what they are aiming for.

After the squeaky nights sleep we decided to spend the 10E each for breakfast, not inc the room price, and have to say it was the worst  breakfast we have ever ate in a hotel. I went up to get my breakfast and the cutlery that you use for lifting the beans etc where covered in old food, which was pretty disgusting I have to say, and when i had my plate half full I seen no sausages (not really sausages, huge hotdogs) and the waitress said they will be out shortly, so i waited there with my plate of food until it went cold after about 5 minutes and the waitress returned and i asked her again and she said wont be for another 10 minutes, so I just left my plate there and sat down until the food came out again. When they did eventually arrive, my fiance went up to get his breakfast they where out of white pudding then, he had seen how long i was waiting for he wasn't going to wait that long and let his breakfast go cold too, so he just had to do without. As for the the scrambled (microwaved to oblivion) eggs, they were the most vile and glow in the dark eggs i have seen or tasted in my life. 

As for the parking when entering the car park it said it was 'full' on a piece of paper sellotaped to the machine, and says if the carpark is full park on the 'street', are they mad?, can you imagine how much it would cost for street parking for 24hr, but when we did go into the carpark, after they had said it was full, it clearly wasnt full, not at all. 

We had  the same receptionist checking in and out did she ask 'did you enjoy your stay with us' no not at all, all she said was ten euro for parking thank you, not even a goodbye or anything , I think all the staff need to go on a refresher hospitality course or something. 

And one more thing, most if not all 4* hotel we have stayed in always had the shower sperate to the bath, this hotel did not and the bathroom was basic 3*, very small indeed. I have experienced bigger bathrooms in a Maldron 3*.

All I can say is , thank you Hilton for distroying what was a great birthday weekend until we stayed at this establishment. I will not and certainly never recommend anyone ever staying in a Hilton anywhere ever.",2,2011,10,24
240,Overnight stay for an event,"Myself and my 13 yr old had to stay here last week for an event we were attending early on the Saturday.  The staff at booking and check in were excellent.  The directions were not very good on the website, however it is just beside heuston train station.  There are excellent parking faclities.  The room was clean and nicely decorated.  We had dinner with our group in the bar, the food was only average, the dessert especially was very poor.  But once again the waitress was exceptionally nice and accomodating.  The room was so noisy, I did not sleep a wink, we turned off the air conditioning, but the noise remained.  I contacted the night porter who said he would investigate- no change.  I did not take this any further at this stage as my son was asleep and I did not want to disturb him.  Again in the morning the breakfast staff were very courteous and accomodating.  On checking out I again addresses the issue of the noise, the receptionist was very nice but did not offer any reason or indicate she would look into it.  Another of the group, 2 rooms away from me also had the same experience.  So in summary, staff excellent, hotel not good!",2,2011,10,17
240,Another Nice Hilton,Was with a Globus tour and this was our last night in Ireland. I am very happy with the Hilton hotels. Meals in the Pub and restaurant were good and they also got us an early continental breakfast at 5:30 in the morning for those of us leaving early for the airport. Very kind of them. Beds were comfortable and lighting was good in the rooms.,5,2011,10,07
240,"Great hotel, all as expected from Hilton","Great hotel, good links to city centre by bus/tram or hotel booked taxi. Rooms were excellent, we had a double room + 1 child and the extra bed was a proper bed which is great as our son is 16 and 6'2"" so a roller bed would have been a disaster. Bathroom was great, walk-in shower plus bath with shower over the bath. Tea and coffee provided in room but no biscuits which is a shame. 
Service in the bar and reception was excellent and all staff were very helpful and friendly. 
Spa was great but be aware you need a swim cap and 2euro's for a locker.",5,2011,10,02
240,Excellent Service,"I have been to the Hilton many times - Food was top class.Went out of their way to help us
The waiter Savass was only excellent very friendly - Cant wait to return . Wonderful.",5,2011,09,30
240,Nice hotel,Nice rooms.  Very quiet even on street side.  This hotel is air conditioned and you do not find that in all of Ireland's hotels.,5,2011,09,29
240,Nice hotel,"The location is a bit off the center, but is good business wise. 
Good and spacious rooms with free (but slow) wireless internet connection. 
Friendly staff and breakfast not according to Hilton's standards as I found it very poor in variety and not so good quality - to review.",4,2011,09,28
240,"Great hotel, will be back!","Stayed here via a supervalu break and got an excellent rate. Service was super, both food and drinks in the bar were great. Breakfast was average but plentiful in supply. Having stayed here before I knew it was possible to order poached eggs, porridge and pancakes but I couldn't see this advertised anywhere (maybe I just missed s sign though!).
Leisure centre is adequate, pool is tiny. 
Customer Service were very helpful at all times. Only improvement would be to ask at check out if car park ticket requires validation to avail of reduced payment - it'll save people getting down to their car only to have to go back up to reception!!!
A tip if getting a taxi into town would be to cross the road and flag one at the gate of IMMA rather than having reception call one. Otherwise the taxi is locked into a one way system and taxi ride will cost roughly double what it should!
All in all a very enjoyable stay. 
 ",4,2011,09,25
240,lovely hotel,"My husband and I stayed at the hotel for our 1st wedding anniversary and had a lovely time. We got an excellent deal on our accommodation and it was worth every penny. The hotel is not in central Dublin, but there are plenty of transport choices so getting into the city centre is no problem really, plus some tourist sites are in walking distance of the hotel. Our room was lovely, very comfy bed and temperature was fine. 

The things that we liked best about our stay was:
the pool, hot tub, sauna, gym were fab
the staff in the restaurant were excellent, very attentive and friendly 
the meal we had on the Friday was magnificent (we eat out a lot so we consider ourselves experts!!), we opted for the meal deal as it was such good value the choices were limited (but we expected that) and everything we ate was outstanding. 
breakfast was great too, plenty of choice and very tasty. 
Free wifi in the room
TV had plenty of channels (so we could still watch X factor!!)

The only things that could have been improved for us were:
A couple of minor things were damaged in our bathroom and the safe didnt work, but that may well have been me not understanding the instructions (we were in room 322).
The steam room wasnt working on our second day
We wish the meal deal had been available on a weekend night too! 

However, these points really are me trying hard of things to think of for Hilton staff to take on board as they in no way detracted from our stay. 

Tips for travellers:

If you dont have any mobility issues do not pay for a taxi to or from the train station to the hotel it literally is 15 minutes walk in virtually a straight line (plus the taxi cost us 10 euros - rip off!).

If you are travelling to the hotel from the airport, take the 747 Dublin Airlink bus.  

Consider getting a bus ticket that covers airport and tourist buses as you will save some money

Also take plenty of money - Dublin is pretty expensive (2 pints of coke in the pub next to the hotel cost us 10 euros....), as with most cities.",5,2011,09,22
240,Weekenstay,"We ahve just been a weekend i Dublin af stayed at the Hilton Kilmainham. Absolutely super hotel, very good service, kind personale a very fine rooms.
We will come again.

240,Highly recommended,"On our recent trip, we stayed mainly in family run bed and breakfast places but also stayed in a couple of hotels, one of which was the Hilton Dublin Kilmainham. It was certainly a good decision as just about everything about it worked well for us. The location was fine, accommodations were spacious, comfortable, and very clean, and the breakfast was amazing. As if they didn't have enough variety at the buffet, they would also cook eggs to order (if the ones at the buffet weren't to your liking) and meet other requests such as for hot chocolate. We booked the prepaid non-refundable, non-changeable rate, which we don't normally do, but it was so reasonable (and included breakfast) that it was hard to resist. There was free Internet in the business centre (and free wi-fi in the rooms) which was very helpful. Parking cost 10 Euros/night but that's not unreasonable in a city hotel and it was very secure and easy to access. Staff was excellent at the front desk and in the dining room and bar, although we had one minor problem in that we received incorrect bus information from the front desk attendant, which affected our return from the city centre; however, I brought this to the attention of the manager after I returned home and was very satisfied with the prompt reply and her plan to follow up with staff. All in all, I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2011,09,19
240,Great location & love the pool,"I love staying in this hotel of all the Hilton hotels in Dublin.  Its location, service and most of all its swimming pool downstairs just make it all up for me.  Having accessible rooms make it so handy for me since I use crutches to get around and always bring my wheelchair with me when staying here for use at the swimming pool.  Having free wifi is a huge bonus.  This is the second time I brought my fianc√©e with me and she just loves staying in this hotel.  I was up for a Scouting business meeting but Ailish made use of its location to walk down to the Luas to do some shopping  Both of us eat in the bar and as usual both the food and service was great.  The room was spacious and very comfortable.  We used the leisure centre and swimming pool many times over our stay and found it relaxing.  The great location also makes it handy for our nice short walks to the Royall Hospital Kilmainham and the Islandbridge Memorial Garden.  Both well worth a visit.  We will be back soon as a married couple and so looking forward to it.",5,2011,09,16
240,Great location for city - good price for Hilton,"One night stay here for business meeting in city. Location great, 10 min walk to train station/luas stops. Staff friendly and efficient. The room was spotless and bed very comfortable. Free wifi a bonus. Cant comment on restaurant but ate in bar and food was good and reasonably priced.",4,2011,09,15
240,Very very good,"Stayed here 3rd to 5th sept. Very good in many ways, location just 20min walk to Dublin centre or 10 mins by bus. Decor and ambiance pleasant. Room very spacious, everywhere in hotel immaculate. We ate in restaurant and bar, food very good and I felt very good value. Couple of problems in dining room and bar. Due to having back problems I asked for a soft backed seat in restaurant. Even though I saw tables set for 2(the size of my party) the girl seating us said she couldn't facilitate me. Ravin,who I think is manager, overheard and within a minute had us seated as requested. On second night we ate in Cinnamon bar. I ordered a ceasar salad to start. Half an hour later I asked the waitress where my starter was. She said the kitchen was very busy. I said to forget about the starter and I'd just have main course. I heard her explain to Ravin what had happened. He came straight to us, apologized and yet again dealt with the problem in a very satisfactory manner. While I feel some staff require further training,Ravin, I hope I've spelt his name correctly,is a real asset to the hotel.
I will not hesitate to return and have already recommended the hotel.",4,2011,09,06
240,An excellent stay once again,"I've stayed at this hotel a number of times in the past mainly because I prefer to stay at Hilton hotels and this one is often a good price. It's location is about ten minutes away from the city centre by bus. If you've got the energy, it's about a 12 minute walk to Heuston railway station.

This hotel, as you'd expect from Hilton, is very well equipped with a pool, spa and gym if you have the time to use it. On this occasion I was only there for one night. My room was big and spacious - and I'd paid a little extra to get one with a balcony which overlooks the old Kilmainham jail which the area is known for. The room was immaculate, the bedding spotless. Every bit as I would expect.

Staff at the front desk were friendly but not what I would call efficient. There was some hiccup at check-in although they soon resolved it. At checkout, there was quite a wait with only one of the two front desk team serving customers.

Breakfast was, as ever very good - Hilton breakfasts are always superb and it's good to see that this hotel maintains that reputation.

All things considered, it was a good stay at a good hotel. I would happily stay here again and the property remains my preferred choice for accommodation in Dublin.",5,2011,09,04
240,A typical good hilton,"As with most Hilton‚Äôs the hotel was clean and functional, the staff were good and helpful. The room was a good size and had everything needed, comfy bed, plenty of hanging space, plenty of tea and coffee, a flat screen TV, free Wi-Fi, a good powerful shower and good toiletries the bathroom. We didn‚Äôt eat there but the menu‚Äôs looked good. The only down sides are that the hotel is not at central as it claims and the free parking cost 10 euro, but for 3 days that is very cheap.",3,2011,08,31
240,"Was ok, wouldnt like to be paying full price tho!","We booked this through supervalu get away breaks deal, the hotel was nice yes, but average. Staff ok, rooms nice, shower was excellent! Paying ten euro a nite for car parking was a bit ridiculous. 

Dont think i would be back unfortunately, didn't make much of an impression tbh!",3,2011,08,30
240,Oh so dissapointing,"Arrived to a lovely welcome from a local girl but when we got to our room it was still being cleaned. (16.30) On reporting back to reception we were told our room must be ready as it said so on the list!  Had a drink in the bar and went up to a lovely room.
Bed was very comfortable but breakfast next and the following 3 mornings was not good. Some food was luke warm and when we asked for 2 fried eggs and had to refuse them as they were burst and hard the waitress said we should ask for poached as they can do them soft.
Service in the bar was very very slow and on our last night when we wanted a nice meal it was a disaster with my wife finishing her main course before my starter arrived as they were ""very busy"". We did complain and were apologised to but the atmosphere was spoiled.  Dublin was a lovely city and the Irish people made us very welcome but the service in this hotel was not up to scratch. The duty manager Joanne said we would be contacted by the general manager before we left but this has yet to happen. Stayed at Hilton Hotels before without any problems whatsoever.",2,2011,08,27
240,Worth a revisit,"We stayed for 2 nights as part of a Zoo package. The hotel is located close to the end of the Motorway, but on the route of the Hop On Hop Off Dublin Tour Bus (separate review). The rooms (joining) were excellent, very clean & air condition.
The staff were friendly. 
The menu was disappointing, the selection was poor; the steak was very fatty with little meat even with a 4 euro surcharge applied. The portions were small & the dessert was very bland.",4,2011,08,27
240,disappointed,"I checked in to the hotel on the 24th august for two nights B&B.I was told not to order room service as I did not have a credit card.Is it a crime not to hold one.But I asked another receptionist the next day who told me to order room service and pay cash which was okay but I very off putting to be told that when first entering the hotel.I found the receptionist manner to be quite abrupt also. When we came down to breakfast to our surprise we found little sticks on our saucers,when I asked what they were for I was told they had run out of spoons.Is that the service one gets from a 4 star hotel?",3,2011,08,27
240,Lovely stay!,"We loved our stay at Hilton Kilmainham! Great food, service and hotel room. The hotel has a lovely swimming pool and sauna and a gym. We want to give our thanks to the hotel man Brian who helped us a lot with figuring Dublin out! We recommend this hotel and would like to come back ourselves!

- the two norwegian girls",5,2011,08,26
240,"fantastic location, fantastic service","If your looking for a family, local feel, you found it; the hotel offers fantastic location, with great food, loads other activities, suggestion to plan your stay on every corner from everybody...even on a rainy day on the Emerald Island...this hotel can't go wrong. Deffiinitely, reccommend to everyone :)",5,2011,08,26
240,we loved it and we'll be back,"check in was fast ,staff were pleasant, our room was on 4th floor it was spacious and modern ,very clean,breakfast was brought to our room ,the food was good and plenty of it,very nice hotel",4,2011,08,21
240,"Mostly good, but could do so much better with little effort!"," As we were arriving quite late, 1am, we called ahead.""no problem, your key will be waiting"". And so it was. The gentleman receptionist could see we were tired, but was friendly and fast.

We had booked a king size room. It over looked the historical jail and was spacious, well decorated and comfortable. The pillows were not great, and selection of tv stations quite limited with many not working. Both simple things, but annoying and so easily fixed! 

Breakfast served until eleven, but when we git there at a quarter to, a lot of the hot food was only Luke warm. Breakfast staff could do a lot better. All seemed to be non-irish, and lacking that irish welcome charm you so often used to get in irish hotels. 

Overall a nice hotel and Wed go back. It would be nice to see some local staff to make the experience a bit more personable. Presently this could be a hotel anywhere in the world. As its in a very historic part of Dublin, management are missing a trick in not having any of that irish charm! ",3,2011,08,21
240,Very disappointed...,"We were surprised at how unfriendly the reception staff were, and didnt feel wecome in the slightest. We found the room very stuffy, to the extent of feeling light headed. The heating system was difficult to use and was extremely warm throughout the stay. We notified staff of this problem but little was done. Bed was pretty uncomfortable, two singles pushed together but the division could be felt straight away. There was dust on the glass shelves in the bathroom and was very obvious to us. 

View was nice.
Bar and wait staff were friendly and accomodating,
Bar food was very nice, 
Overall ambience was quite dull.
Carpet in bar needs replacing, other then that it was a lovely bar visually.",2,2011,08,19
240,Nice hotel but could be so much better.,"This is a nice modern hotel which seems to be moderately priced. Rooms are very comfortable, if you have a south facing room you may have a lovely panoramic view of the Dublin/Wicklow Mountains. Underground Parking ‚Ç¨10 per day and requires validation otherwise will cost more.  It's true that the location is somewhat away from the main thoroughfare of Dublin, but not isolated once you don't mind navigating the public transport. It should take no more than 5-10mins in a Taxi to reach the City. The hotel, due to it's proximity to Kilmainham Gaol, also benefits from being on the HOHO Bus route which may be helpful if you are visting here as a Tourist. Otherwise there is not a great deal in the immediate vicinity.

Service is sorely lacking at this hotel and this is the primary reason I have to leave a less than stellar review. You really sense that there is a severe lack of staff training especially in how to deal with their guests. Too us a few attempts to reach Room Service (at 4pm in the afternoon, I might add) and when the order came it was missing drinks (!) which did not arrive until 15mins later. Room Service food was poor, very shabby and thrown together we felt, although we did later try desserts which were excellent.

We sample the hotel restaurant, service was again lacking, Waitresses completely disinterested and having very little knowledge of anything on the menu (which isn't really extensive in fairness). We had to ask for a drinks menu then again for dessert menu, the latter of which she could not produce. Ridiculous! To the Chef's credit, the steaks were excellent and almost cast a shadow over the woeful table service.

Breakfast was similar, staff running around stressed while guests were left waiting for a table or for tea/coffee. It wasn't exactly jam packed either, so you have to wonder what the fuss is?

The adjoining Spa is well worth a visit, the pools are pretty warm which we did enjoy, but the Steam Room was insanely hot (painfully so, in fact). A few degrees lower and it would've been perfect, but don't let this detract from an otherwise superb facility.

So overall we had a good stay (love the bed!) but there are some issues here with service and staff training that management should address because they would be onto a winner if they sorted this. If you are looking for cheap and 'peace of mind' accommodation in Dublin, I can recommend the Hilton Kilmainham if you can secure a good rate, just set your expectation level accordingly and don't be fooled by the Hilton badge and expect 5 star service for a 3 star price. A comfortable stay can still be had provided you don't ask too much of the hotel staff.",3,2011,08,11
240,"lovely hotel, staff not friendly and pool far too hot!!","We just returned from our stay there this weekend. The hotel is very nice and good location as we were going to the Zoo the following morning! rooms spaceous and clean. nice modern hotel and would stay again! 
 Check in was quick, but the receptionist did not give us any of the usual information about the hotel...location of dining room, pool etc or how the lift work with your room key/card!!  Pool was very hot, nearly like being in a hot bath the whole time.  Our 2yr old only stayed 10mins and had enough!! Maybe this was a once off and had tempreture problems,but staff never said!!!

We had an inter-connecting room as we have two children that was a must and such excitement for the kids.Took 2 phone calls to the front desk to ask them to open the doors between both rooms!! Dinner lovely but again not really catering for kids and waitress not friendly or helpful. 
Breakfast was fine but staftt slow to come to table to bring tea/coffe you had to find staff memember.",4,2011,08,09
240,Very disappointing:(,"My partner and i booked a two night stay at this hotel and unless the service improves dramatically we shall not be returning.  On arrival we had a speedy and pleasant check-in and our room was comfortable.  That evening we went  for a walk and on returning at 11.30 we asked if we could have a beer and coke to take to our rooms but we were told that the bar was closed.  An hour later we went outside as a group of men enter, we went back inside after about 15mins, all of the group were sitting having beer. My partner once again asked for drinks and he was given them.
Next morning i was looking forward to what the Hilton had to offer for Breakfast, and it was a complete disaster, we waited for 10mins to be seated but there were no staff to be seen so we seated ourselves, another 10mins passed before we could order coffee/tea, there were no hot food in the serving dishs, the toaster was set to high so everyones toast was burning and with no staff the other guest looked baffled until i reset it, only to find there was also no bread out, eventually a manager/supervisor appeared, he did seem to be under pressure as if they were short of staff.  I tried to help him and let him know what he needed to get from the kitchen as i reckon this was his first morning serving breakfast.  He did thank me for the help! it took 50mins for us to have a buffet breakfast the only positive thing that morning was the Orange Juice freshly squeezed.  The following morning there was lots of food to be had but again the service was poor and they did not have fresh orange juice.  It is a nice hotel but we found the service to be very very poor.",2,2011,08,07
240,A better experience than before,"We recently stayed for 3 nights at the Hilton along with our two friends. This is our second time to stay there. In all it was a pleasant experience except for the air conditioning. The heat at night in the rooms was cruel and the a/c units, when you can get them to work, were not effective. The management really needs to sort this out,- (spend the money!!!!!)",4,2011,08,05
240,enjoyed hotel area round to be desired ha ha,we spent 1 night at the above hotel which as a family we enjoyed. the swimming pool woz out of this world. room woz excellent and eat all you want for breakfast the following morning had a job to find the hotel tho we got the luas to the suir road then walked back over the bridge roughly 15 mins the 78a bus is located just round corner this bus takes you to the liffey valley centre we didnt eat in the restaurant tho just across the road woz a nice bar which had a wonderful italian restaurant just above it. the pub called the patriots inn and la dolce vita the italian restaurant great value for money as hotel is expensive that said you receive a 5euro voucher in your room to be redeemed on purchases of 20e or more in the hotel.as I said enjoyed the hotel but just be cautious with the area,4,2011,08,04
240,A lovely hotel,"Stayed here for two nights with my other half half. If you are driving to Dublin than this is the perfect place for you to stay as it is just outside the main hustle and bustle of the city centre and thus you shouldn't be stuck in any serious traffic. And while I say it is outside the main centre it is not very far at all and we walked to town and it did not take us too long, however taxis are also very reasonable and reception ordered them for us on more than one occasion. The only downside to our stay was that the air conditioning in the room was broken and the weather was quite hot whilst we were there and so the room was like a sauna. Upon raising this with reception this offered little consolation as the hotel was fully booked, eventually the sent a fan to the room which did the job albeit a bit loudly. We stayed two nights and still the air con wasn't fixed nor were we moved to another room. In the end as compensation the receptionist, whom did seem very apologetic, said she would waive our parking fare.....all of ‚Ç¨8 if I remember correct. I think much more could have been done here and I am disappointed that it tarnished as otherwise enjoyable stay.",4,2011,08,04
240,Good choice of hotel if traveling with a car,"I specifically chose this hotel as it wasn't right in the centre as I was traveling with a car and was advised against driving in the centre of Dublin. The hotel itself was lovely, clean, friendly staff. Our family room was big, with a separate study/tv alcove, handy for parents while kids sleep. The room was well appointed with face washers and lots of toiletries. Breakfast buffet was the expected array of choice although there was no muesli to 2 days of our stay. The location was perfect for us, we had no difficulty driving to the hotel and were happy to pay the ‚Ç¨10 parking. It is right opposite the Kilmainham gaol so if this is on your sightseeing list in Dublin then the location is perfect. We were able to have a leisurely breakfast and walk over to the gaol for the first tour. The hop on hop off buses both stop at the gaol so you can take the hoho bus into Dublin centre. Alternatively, there is a local bus which takes 10 minutes, we caught this back to the hotel one night. If you want to be near the main tourist sites this hotel is not for you, but if you intend to visit the gaol or have a car it is a good option. ",5,2011,08,03
240,Very good value,"Good location. V pleasant staff. The executive rooms on the 5th Floor are excellent.
Nice bar area and has a good busy atmosphere. There's a gym and pool.
Extremely good value for money.",4,2011,08,02
240,Excellent Hotel,"Much has been said about the distance of this hotel from city center.  It took me less than 5 min to walk to the bus station.. The bus takes you right to the center of town.  The hotel is clean, great breakfast, friendly staff. Save some money and stay outside of town.",4,2011,07,26
240,Very good hotel,"The staff at the Hilton Kilmainham hotel were very friendly and helpful. The triple room we stayed in was clean, modern and spacious. The car park was easily accessible and the hotel is situated opposite the Kilmainham Prison. The buffet breakfast was excellent with a variety of different food. We also dined in the bar  and enjoyed the meals we recieved. I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel and would stay again.",5,2011,07,26
240,Everything great but location,"So it's a typical Hilton. Nice rooms, nice enough staff. Great breakfast. Room was very comfortable albeit on the small size but typical for the smaller rooms in many European hotels.
So that leaves me with nothing to complain about except the location. :)  
I knew where it was when I booked it, and I've been to Dublin enough to know it shouldn't have really been a big issue. 
But it was. For me, at least, just too inconvenient for the things I want to see and do in Dublin.",4,2011,07,23
240,Hilton's Corporate Taxi Service,"On our recent trip to Dublin Ireland, we stayed at the Hilton hotel.  We arrived late in the afternoon, too late to take advantage of the local tour bus service to see the city.  We asked the receptionist if she could help us with seeing the city.  She recommended a gentleman name Brian O'Reilly who was a corporate taxi service.  We talked to Brian and he took us on an amazing city tour in his taxi.  Brian showed us the city in such detail that we were total thrilled and pleased; at a very reasonable price.  We cannot say enough good things about Brian; he was very knowledgable, professional, and personable.  We definately recommend Brian for a city tour or any transporation service you or your company may need when visiting Dublin, Ireland.",5,2011,07,17
240,Excellent hotel...  1st visit ...Will be back SOON!,"The Hilton Kilmainham is in the perfect position for a completely tranquil stay in Dublin, located right opposite Kilmainham Goal (jail) and seconds away from Phoenix Park (Dublin zoo) its location is fantastic not far from town at all and the buses stop outside the jail, taxi cabs are also available on site.
The Hotels staff were professional, polite very helpful and friendly. The rooms were immaculate with lovely decor beautiful lighting and black out curtains to ensure a good nights rest, they provided all the comforts of home with in room t v, kettle and drinks tray, iron, hairdryer and internet access. 
The buffet breakfast was superb and saw us through the day til our evening meal with an excellent selection of breakfast foods to suit every palette.
The Hydrotherapy pool and spa area were again immaculately maintained and a fantastic resource to end a busy day in Dublin. All in all the Hotel provided the perfect place for our trip to Dublin.",5,2011,07,13
240,"Great staff, everyone is friendly and helpful","Great staff, we had minor issues with our room which were taken care of immediately.  the cab driver, Brian O'Reilly was very helpful and very friendly, when we first got there he saw us looking at a map and planning out our day and came over to help us and give us advice on what to see since we were only in town for one day.  We originally thought he was the manager since he was so helpful but we surprisingly discovered that he was the driver the following morning on our return trip to the airport, he definitely made our trip worthwhile and we can not wait to go back.",5,2011,07,10
240,"Nice hotel, would stay again, but not in the center of attractions","We stayed at the hotel as part of Globus tour, as well as extended our stay for few days after the tour ended. The hotel is modern, great clean rooms and have a nice workout facility plus pool. Good breakfast, as well as restaurant/cafe. The restaurant is a bit expensive, at typical Dublin prices. Wi-FI is available in rooms, but is very slow, and you need a code for each device, that expires within 24 h - that was not  very convenient. Also, I would avoid rooms in the wing that overlooks Kilmainum Jail on Fridays on 1st floor, as they have a band/singer on Friday nights, and we could not sleep till about 1 am.  The location is not central, the only couple of attractions that at walking proximity is Kilmainum jail, memorial gardens and zoo ( about 30-40 mins walking) The luas station is quite far too. The red/green hop-on-hop-off bus stop is right across the street, and you could use that to get around town, but it stops running after 6pm.",4,2011,07,10
240,Housekeeper Left VERY Bad Taste,"This hotel is perfectly fine, totally functional, and has a good number of redeeming qualities.  Among the good aspects:
-Pretty good location near Phoenix Park Kilmainham Gaol, Museum of Modern Art, a few quaint pubs and a DELIGHTFUL cafe next door called ""The Lime Tree Cafe"", which I HIGHLY recommend!
-Decent workout facilities and tiny pool, sauna, steam room area.
-Comfortable beds and good tub/showers.
-Perfectly clean and well-kept
-In-room safes and decent coffee/tea service in rooms.

On the ""not so good"" side, I'd say the following:
-Air conditioning didn't work in our daughters room 2 of the 3 nights of our stay.
-Overpriced (albeit nice) restaurant called ""Cinnamon"".
-45-minute walk to downtown (certainly not a ""fault"", just a fact)
-Understaffed front desk at times, although they tried to be friendly.
**My BIGGEST problem with this hotel, however, dealt with a rude member of the housekeeping staff.  On our last day, I approached the lady to tell her we'd be leaving our rooms before 11 to check-out.  She looked at me and said ""uh huh"", then walked away.  A moment later I was standing in the hall with my daughters preparing to leave for breakfast and she walked past me quickly and I had to dodge to avoid getting bumped by her.  I said ""pardon me"" but she didn't acknowledge.  Not 20 seconds later, the SAME EXACT THING HAPPENED!!  I said ""boy, you're rude!"", to which she looked up, gave me a dirty look and walked away.  I would say maybe this is indicative of Irish people in general, however, we were treated absolutely beautifully by others.

I'm a HHonors Diamond Member, so I stay in Hilton properties constantly.  This lady cost the hotel my respect and thanks, and instead left me wondering what I did to be treated so rudely.",3,2011,07,08
240,Great hotel - made the stay in Dublin very enjoyable,"I stayed at this hotel with my wife recently as part of a weekend break.  The hotel looks like new and all the staff are approachable.  I was upgraded at no cost to a suite as my room was not ready when we arrived.   So the room was awesome - large, modern and clean - great views of Dublin as well.   Food was good - I would recommend the bar area, the staff were very eager to please and it's open til 1am ... which helps the Guinness consumption ;-)
Its not often that I struggle to find negatives about Hotels I stay at .. so its nice to finally have to think hard about how the hotel could be improved ... so only a minor issue ... would be great if there was a hilton bus to/from the airport ...taxi fare via M50 was >40 Euros",4,2011,06,28
240,"Great hotel, would recommend!","The welcome was warm, the service excellent. The hotel was clean and well-managed. Drinks a bit pricey in the bar, but to be honest not really any different to what you pay in the city. The food in the restaurant was amazing, best steak i've ever had! Special mention goes to our taxi driver, Brian O'Reilly, who drove us from the hotel to the airport. He was polite, informative, a credit to the hotel and the Irish people in general!",5,2011,06,25
240,Great location,We stayed here twice in the same week (4 notes each stay). Great location. Just 2 blocks from the train station which is a 15-minute ride to downtown. You can walk to the heart of Dublin in 45 minutes. Very nice rooms and clean hotel. Highly recommended.,5,2011,06,16
240,Good business hotel,"The location is a little challenging for vacationers--10 to 15 minute bus ride from downtown--but it is very convenient to the ring road and to Shepherd's Green. Other than that, nice; nice rooms, fast wifi, good bar, good breakfast. And very responsive. Any and all problems were addressed quickly and efficiently. They also have a dedicated cab driver who is really handy. He'll do airport pick-ups, to and from meetings, day trips out of town if you're interested. And he's one of those wonderful, warm, chatty Irishmen who make you  feel like you've met a local. Recommend it.",4,2011,06,13
240,Lovely hotel. Brilliant Staff. Great place,"The staff at this hotel are brilliant. All are friendly and attentive with a great knowledge of the local area (ask them for advice on how to get places and best times to go). They helped us book taxis, restaurants etc and have a business center if you like to do your own research.

The whole hotel is kept spotlessly clean. The room was amazing and I had one of the best nights sleep in a long while.

The location is a little way out of town but if you don't mind a stroll it's brilliant, get the Tram (goes to from City center to the Train station, which is a 10min walk away). Taxis are cheap but watch the meter if your aren't Irish, I noticed one of them added an extra 5euros for no reason (i'm guessing it's when he realised where he was dropping us?). Perfectly located near the Jail and about a 10min walk from the Zoo.

As with anywhere on the Euro it's a little expensive. We got given a 20euro food/drink voucher to use in the restaurant/bar if you spend 15euros or more... use this on a glass of sparkling wine as a free treat!

Much better than paying over the odds for an inner city hotel.",4,2011,06,07
240,excellent service,"We stayed there recently and loved everything about the hotel.  Staff  did whatever they could to make our stay more enjoyable and pleasurable and  we would gladly come back to stay there.  

We could not fault anything about the hotel.  I would recommend it highly to anyone who is looking to go to dublin for a holiday.  The staff and management care about the guests and that matters and they make their guests feel happy and the cuisine is brilliant and we are very happy as customers to be taken care of by such brilliant staff.",5,2011,06,05
240,Problem dealt with poorly - otherwise ok,"We found the hotel fairly easily after taking advice at the airport and buying a 3 day Freedom of Dublin ticket which at 26 euro each enabled us to travel to and from the airport and around Dublin on local and tour buses. The bus stops at Heuston Station and the hotel is a 10 minute walk.
The hotel is in a good position opposite Kilmainham Jail and there are bus stops opposite which are easy to find.
Unfortunately we were faced with a problem checking in which had been caused by apparently incorrect advice from Hilton Head Office. The attitude of the check in staff was that is was very much 'my problem' and weren't keen to try to do anything to sort it out. The staff were quite rude and I had to spend time the next morning trying to sort it out. Again staff did not want to help me resolve the matter until the reservations manager was called. 
The mini bar in room wasn't stocked which was diappointing after the problems checking in!
The room itself was fine, as you would expect from such a hotel. The beds are large and comfortable and our room overlooked the jail.
Taxis from the city centre were between 11 - 14 euro per trip.
There is a spa and gym, although you do need to wear a swimming cap if you wish to use the pool (they are sold in the gym).
Overall the hotel was fine although I wouldn't stay here again due to the poor sevice we received.",3,2011,06,05
240,Not Impressed !!!!,"We stayed at the Hilton Dublin Kilmainham the last two nights we were in Ireland and we were very disappointed. We are Hilton HHoners members and very surprised at our stay at this hotel. First the area this hotel is in is very far from all the main sights so you either have to drive or take the bus. There is no restaurants near by and the restaurant in the Hotel is Horrible and the service is the worst. So you have to go out of your way to find a place to eat. Our room was ok and had a really nice view of the Kilmainham prison but the air condition did not work (actually had to open a window), the mini fridge did not work, and there is no pay per view to order a movie after a long day of walking Dublin... Our last night in Ireland we were so tired that we just wanted to order room service and low and behold the service would not pick up so that we could order. We tried and tried calling buy no answer, we even tried directly calling the restaurant but no answer and front desk was no help.  We ended up getting crappy pizza from way down the road.. For the money we should have stayed closer into Dublin. Probably wouldn't recommend this hotel to anybody

The good things I can say about this hotel is that the check in/check out staff was very nice and professional and the beds are super comfy, the room was very clean, and it was quite.",3,2011,06,04
240,"A ""lovely"" place to stay!","I have to say that staying at the Hilton Kilmainham was a great choice for my first trip to Ireland. We had 2 rooms, both of which were spacious and had all the amenities we could need - they even give you a full size hairdryer and not just a tiny travel one to use! The hotel is located directly across from the Kilmainham Gaol, making it incredibly easy to walk across the street and catch the hop-on hop-off bus tour that goes all around the city. Breakfast is included with your room, and it is delicious - a full assortment of muffins, breads, juices, hot food, and cereal awaits you from 7-10am each morning. It was a great way to start our site seeing each day.

To top off our stay, we met Brian! Brian is one of the most outwardly friendly individuals I have ever come across. On the second day of our trip, he took us for a 3 hour tour of Dublin in his taxi with his friend (and certified tour guide) Paudy. It was one of the highlights of our trip. Brian also made sure we got to the airport on time and was always willing to share a story or offer up some advice on things we should do around the city. Make sure you ask for him when you arrive - he is truly a nice person and a fantastic resource for all those new to Ireland!",5,2011,05,25
240,Absolute wonderful stay!!,"I stayed here with a friend at the beginning of the month. It was our first time to Dublin and we loved it!! The hotel was wonderful! The staff couldn't be more friendly and helpful! We didn't take a taxi anywhere, but saw Brian in the hotel everyday and he was very friendly! Breakfast was included in our stay and was great! Our room and bathroom were both very big! The room had a fridge and a safe. There is also a nice pool and fitness center!
The hotel was a little far out of the way especially if you walk. I advise taking a bus... we didn't and had a hard time finding it. You can take a shuttle bus from the airport to Euston station for ‚Ç¨10 with a return. Then, a bus from Euston station to the Kilmainham Jail. The city tour buses pick up outside the jail which is only a couple minute walk away. It isn't right in town so it is pretty quiet. 
We ate in the restaurant and it was nice as well. Internet is free you get codes for each day when you check in. At first I wasn't happy it wasn't closer to town, but everything was so great it didn't end up bothering us!",5,2011,05,15
240,"If you seek friendly staff, great driver, neighborhood experience ...","Nicole at the front desk -- I arrived on an overnight flight with almost no sleep.  Nicole was polite and professional, but I was most impressed that she was proactive in providing assistance to me.
Brian O'Reilly is probably one of the most interesting taxi drivers you will ever meet!  His corporate taxi service features a spacious vehicle and he will entertain you with lively conversation and jokes. Brian is a unique part of your Dublin travel and tour experience - he will even take you out into the countryside if you like.
Sales Manager - Mercedes Bagnall - she hosted a reception on Wednesday evening - enjoyed an engaging conversation with her and other guests.
The Fitness Center and pool is excellent for a hotel.  I was thankful to use their full set of free weights and cardio machines.
Internet in room - Excellent - wired broadband connection, plus a wall plug with a USA power receptable so i did not need a converter.  I love the convenience of it.
The hotel is near a museum but also part of a nice neighborhood and I enjoyed the experience of walking the neighborhood at night and also using a small grocery store nearby.  It was just lovely!!",5,2011,05,14
240,Excellent proximity to Kilmainham Gaol,"We stayed here on our last night in Ireland because we wanted to tour Kilmainham Gaol (literally right across the street).  The hotel was comfortable and quiet.  Our room looked out onto the entrance to the Museum of Modern Art and although it was situated on a busy road, we had very little road noise in our room.

We checked in at night and did not have advance reservations, but they were able to get a room for us.  Breakfast is not included in the price of the stay, and cost us 24 Euros extra for my husband and I (it was worth it though, since they had a large breakfast buffet).  Make sure they give you the breakfast vouchers in advance if you purchase breakfast because they forgot to give us ours and we had to convince the staff at the restaurant the next morning that we had already paid for the breakfast.

The reception desk also recommended a local pizza place (4 Star) down the road that was still open for dinner the night we checked in.

The proximity of this hotel to Kilmainham Gaol and the art museum is wonderful, but if you want to head to city centre, it is best to take the Dublin bus in to town.  The stop is about a 3-4 minute walk from the hotel and very convenient.  There is no Luas stop in close proximity.  We took the Luas back from city centre to Jame's stop and walked about 5 blocks back to the Hilton.",4,2011,05,09
240,Excellent hotel & location,"Friendly welcome.  Good location for sightseeing in Dublin city & handy to the M50.
The food is very good & there is a wide choice.  All the staff are very helpful.",5,2011,05,07
240,A great starting place is here talking to Brian,"We stayed here for four nights at the beginning of a two week trip and couldn't be happier with our decision.  We arrived at the hotel at 8:00am and the staff cleaned a room and had it ready right away even though check-in wasn't until 3:00pm.  The room was very comfortable and the beds were perfect.  Brian, the concierge, at the hotel was very informative about all of Dublin & even helped us plan the rest of our trip all around Ireland. The hotel is located within walking distance of all forms of transportation, including the sightseeing busses which stop in front of the hotel. This was a perfect starting point for our vacation.",4,2011,05,05
240,I'll definitely stay here again,"We really liked this hotel. It's clean, comfortable, has a terrific breakfast, and the staff was outstanding - especially Brian, the concierge. His knowledge and advice of Dublin made our 2-day stay a real delight!",5,2011,04,27
240,i really recommend this hotel..,"a great hotel, really nice service, rooms, and food, close to the hop on an off busses, so easy accsess to the center of Dublin.. i really recommend this hotel..
i stayed there for 6 days for a leisure holiday in april ..",5,2011,04,27
240,"Average Hotel, Bad Location","This hotel is across from the Kilmainham Goal and Museum of Modern Art but far away from everything else!   You will need to take a taxi to go to the City Center or anywhere else.  The taxi ride will cost you anywhere from 10 euro to 15 euro.  

DO NOT TRY AND TAKE THE LUAS as there is no station close by.  The Bus may be an option but we were never sure where the bus stop was located.  

The rooms were nice and comfortably furnished.  There is WiFi in all the rooms but it is SLOW!!!!  

The hotel has both a bar and restaurant but service is SLOW and the food is EXPENSIVE.  For example a chicken sandwich is 15 euro.",3,2011,04,24
240,Excellent Hotel,"The hotel is a two minute walk to the nearest bus stop which will bring you straight into the city centre. Taxi home after a night out was very reasonable too, only ‚Ç¨11. Staff could not have been more helpful, specially the now famous concierge, Brian. He is an absolute gem and no doubt one of the reasons guests would return to this hotel. He really is a fountain of information on Dublin, to see and do! Room was very clean and comfortable. My only criticism of the room is that the air conditioning could have been better. Parking is ‚Ç¨10 per day, which isn't bad for Dublin. Breakfast was buffet style and plenty of it. You won't get up hungry! All in all, a very positive stay. Highly recommended.",4,2011,04,22
240,relaxing and nice weekend at the Hitlon Hotel,"Very friendly and helpfull stuff, very nice room with great view, not too far away from city center. Very nice SPA area with Jacuzzi  and swimmingpool. Brian, the cab driver is very helpfull and a real gentelman. He has a good knowledge of the city and he is really kind with customers. It is a plesure to meet people like him during a trip to visit the city.",5,2011,04,20
240,Great stay at the Hilton Kilmainham,"Perfect hotel to stay for a relaxing visit to Dublin.  Excellent service and cleanliness by the Hilton.  The amazing breakfast buffet on offer along with full use of the spa facilities (steam room, sauna, pool and jacuzzi) made a lovely start to the day.  Great hotel bar too.

The hotel is opposite Kilmainham prison and very close to the guiness factory so it's a great location for the tourist sites.

We were all very well rested - the beds were very comfy and there was no noise.  The rooms all had hairdryers and shampoo/conditioner, body lotions and shower gels. There is FREE WIFI throughout the hotel, you just ask at reception for the daily code.

I phoned the Hilton before we arrived and they arranged a taxi from Dublin airport to the hotel (approx ‚Ç¨35-40) and they sent a fab taxi driver called Brian to pick us up.  The taxi was spacious and accomodated all 6 of us with bags.  The taxi driver was a credit to the Hilton and really made our stay.  He was based at the hotel and run us in to town and picked us up and offered local tourist information.  The taxi to town is approx ‚Ç¨15.  We miss Brian.

Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and we would recommend the Hilton Kilmainham to all of our friends.",5,2011,04,19
240,"Lovely hotel, great service, good value!!!","Just had a 2 night break booked from their web site, had a special offer which was 2 nights b&b plus and evening meal on the first night(3 courses) it actually worked out cheaper than some b&b's in the city.The hotel is modern , clean and the staff we came into contact with were polite and efficient. The room we had was the king size and was well decorated, quite chic, bed comfortable, excellent shower.Breakfast was awesome and I need to diet for a month now.Only down side was paying to park the car , 10 euro per night. Right opposite Kilmainham jail and the Irish Museum of Modern Art (the latter being free).Walked to Guinness Storehouse in 20 mins but didnt find that worth the 15 euros.City tour hop on hop off buses stop right outside.Nice bar lounge facilities and nice patio area outside. Would recommend it, family ,couples and single orientated.Free high speed internet connection/wifi in room.",5,2011,04,17
240,Out of the Hustle but Near enough for Fun,"A great hotel, very friendly staff and a beautiful room.  We loved our view and used the hop on hop off bus that stopped right across from the hotel for sight seeing and getting into/around town.  Beside the historic Gaol across the street the Museum of Modern Art was right next door.  The Heuston bus station was an easy walk - which we did- and we enjoyed the restaurant on site as well.",4,2011,04,15
240,"Excellent Service, mediocre location","I had the pleasure of staying for 2 weeks and the staff are very friendly and helpful. Brian, the cab driver who spends a good part of his day in the lobby is extremely helpful and has a wealth of local knowledge at hand.

The rooms were extremely clean, the breakfast buffet is so-so. If you enjoy whiskey, the bartenders can offer some solid recommendations. The maid service is wonderful, they tend to organize your items (toothpaste, razor, deodorant, etc.).

The hotel is quite a ways from city centre but there are 3 buses(51b/c 78a) maybe 2 blocks south of the hotel that take you right into the heart of the city for 1.65 euro and typically 1.20 euro for the return trip. If you're into some local taste, visit Bull and Castle, St. John's Gogarty's and Mulligans - try the Metal Man pale ale and the Green Spot whiskey, both are quite fabulous.",5,2011,04,15

240,5 star service at 3 star prices,"Had a great stay recently in the Hilton Kilmainham. Room was spotlessly clean and spacious, reception area/ bar is bright and airy, food is good (though some significantly better than others) and staff are phenomonal. I have stayed in quite a few 4 and 5 star hotels both here in Ireland and abroad and nowhere have I experienced staff like the Hilton. Upon leaving I felt it impossible to complete the guest survey and highlight ""any staff member who made an impression"" as every one of the staff I encountered were consumate professionals-very attentive without being intrusive. Well done to the General manager/owner who obviously run a very tight ship!
Bar food was a little hit and miss (both salads were very heavy on the lettuce and had little else) though the fish and chunky chips were excellent and the extensive wine list well choosen. Unlike some of the other reviews I felt that breakfast was more than adequate and the quality of the cooked meats was very very good. I will not hesitate in booking my next Dublin stay here. Keep up the great work!",5,2011,04,05
240,3rd visit still as good as the 1st!,"Love love love this hotel! this is our 3rd time staying at the Hilton kilmainham and everytime we visit Dublin we will use this hotel! the rooms are lovely and clean with a massive queen size bed! the swimming pool is clean and has everything you can want! The only downside to this hotel was we had a party of 14 for dinner on the saturday night and we were ill the next day which was a let down, we reported this to reception who sent the manager up to our room we explained that we were ill after dinner on the saturday night he filled in some forms and offered to send a doctor which we didnt need he also said we would recieve some of our money back on check out this didnt happen which was a little disapointing but i will be contacting the hotel regarding this. the hotel is great for location the luas is only a 5 min walk away at Suir Road station which has links all over the city. when traveling from the airport we always use the air link which is 6euro each and drops you at heauston station from there we use the luas to suir road which is only 1.70 euro each, and a 5 min walk away from the hotel.",5,2011,04,02
240,"Pretty Good with a few ""buts""","Went to Dublin for the very first time to celebrate my partners birthday.  Dublin itself is absolutely brilliant but unbelievably expensive (cheapest pint of lager ¬£4.50 most expensive ¬£8.00!!).  The hotel is advertised as 5 mins from Heuston Station - NO WAY ON GODS EARTH IS THIS TRUE!!!  I asked the receptionist if they had used Linford Christie when establishing the time taken from Heuston to Hotel as it was a good 15-20 minute walk and when you're pulling cases too it's pretty hard going.  Also you can't get a train to Heuston from the airport.  You have to get a taxi at a cost of around 25 euros or the bus (6.00 euros each) to Heuston.  If you do get a taxi make sure you tell the driver to take you via the city centre and not the motorway as this is more expensive (34 euros back to the airport via motorway on the Sunday morning).
Hotel is to far out of the city centre for my liking but the impression I got from the website was that it was just minutes away.
However it really is a lovely hotel.  The staff are extremely friendly (as was everybody else in Dublin).  The only couple of gripes I had about the hotel was the temperature in the room was far to hot and you couldn't seem to control it even with the air con unit in the room.  Saying that we had to turn the aircon off at night as it was to noisy.  Secondly the breakfast.  Overall it was really really nice but I've never stayed at a hotel that does buffet style breakfast but where you have to order fried eggs??? Why is this Mr Hotel manager?  By the time they came my breakfast was cold (if I'd have known you had to order them I wouldn't have put the rest of my breakfast on the plate).  And considering they only take a couple of minutes to fry they took about 10mins and a couple of reminders to the staff before they were brought to my table.
Would I recommend Dublin?  Yes without a shadow of a doubt.  Would I recommend this hotel?  Yes if you don't want to be right in the heart of the city and you like walking or have plenty of money for taxis/buses.  You really cannot fault the hotel just it's location.",4,2011,03,29
240,First Class And Felt Like A King...,"My first time staying at The Hilton Kilmainham Dublin, and I can honestly say it wont be my last the next time I am staying in Dublin I will definitely stay here again. The staff with special mention to Lucas could not of made my stay any better he was so helpful and even when my key card refused to work in the lift as we were staying there 2 nights without any hesitation he gave us late check out for our final morning. The leisure centre although people might find the pool small I found it actually very relaxing as it is spotlessly clean and the Jacuzzi really was warm and gorgeous...
We had food their on both evenings and both were perfect, but what really topped off the Hilton for me was the large King Size Bed, and the breakfast was just superb with choices of fresh juices - cereal - fish - cheese - pastry's - and of course the Full Irish Breakfast (Bacon - Egg - Sausage Etc)...
The only thing that I would ask if I was staying here again would be for a room with a window as the room had no windows to open except for Air Conditioning which although cools the room I don't like having Air Conditioning on all night but that is a first for Ireland as we really did get a fantastic weekend with the weather so it was quite warm but I had a lovely nights sleep with the added bonus of feather pillows and duvet I really did feel like a King...
Thanks to all the staff and Lucas for making our stay in The Hilton very memorable and very comfortable and you will certainly see us again...
Best Wishes,
Gary & Mattie

240,Good but could do better,"First time staying in a Hilton (normally use Crowne Plaza) and overall was impressed.

Room was clean and well presented although it was let down by a couple of things.  Firstly the shaving/cosmetics mirror was missing - the extending arm was mounted to the wall but had nothing attached.  This didn't affect me but did spoil the overall impression of the room.  The disappointing problem was the in-room safe as every time you tried to set the code all you got was 'Err' displayed on the screen.  Reported three times over my three night stay but despite repeated promises it was still broken when I checked out. This meant that I ended taking my laptop and other valuables with me when using the bar and restaurant - not ideal!

Staff were always polite service in the bar wasn't rushed.  Food was always well presented and arrived piping hot.

I can see how the hotel location would be less than ideal for a leisure traveller wanting to be in the city centre but for business it was ideal as it's right in between my companies two offices.  

I'll definitely consider staying here again on my visit next month",4,2011,03,20
240,"Very comfortable, and excellent service","I stayed as a leisure traveler using my HHonors points earlier this month and was very impressed.  The rooms very comfortable and fully met my expectations for a Hilton hotel.  The onsite gym was very modern and had a good combination of both cardio machines and weights.  The location is a little less than ideal for a tourist, its about 15 Euro cab to the city center, but its great for business travelers.

Finally, I wanted to point out how friendly the staff at the front desk was.  In particular one the associates, Lucas, really went out of his way in arranging plans for my stay there.",5,2011,03,13
240,Great hotel - breakfast could be better,"Arrived after an early flight - got to the hotel at around 9.30, checked in and Luke kindly arranged for out room to be ready in around half an hour. He gave us half price breakfast vouchers to use while we waited on the room and we were in our room by 10.30 which was great. Overall a lovely hotel, very clean and modern which I like, but I found the breakfast a bit disappointing. The selection was a bit limited - no menu on the tables with alternative options. The cold continental selection was poor - a few sad slices of cold ham and cheese and some herrings!! It reminded me of a premier inn breakfast, and nothing like the other Hilton breakfasts I've had elsehwere. Handy for the bus stops - and visiting the jail! Bed was really comfortable and lovely big bathroom.",4,2011,03,10
240,Ideal for foreigners - especially Americans - such helpful staff!,"Hotel seems suited for Americans (e.g. there was one American-style electrical outlet in my room).
Good breakfast buffet.
Super kind front desk reception (they let me check in early (after an overnight flight), loaned me a converter, answered lots of questions).
***But the real GEM of the hotel:  BRIAN!  This is a cab-driver who works primarily for the hotel.  He was over-the-top helpful to me several times during my short stay.  Researching shops, finding obscure destinations, driving me to places and once literally getting out of the cab to check details for me (more like a limo driver or an assistant really!)  AND the nicest guy you may ever meet!!!  I learned that he helped some colleagues of mine who were walking on the street and had gotten lost - He was my 'face of Ireland' and made it impossible not to fall in love with the whole place -- the hotel, the city, the country.",4,2011,03,07
240,What a great weekend we had,"We did not know what to expect from Dublin and the hotel. It was all a pleasant surprise.
The hotel is quite new, staff is accommodating and the location is perfect. Just outside the hotel you can catch the ""hop on hop off"" bus and travel all around the city, they sell tickets for the bus at the hotel they can even charge it to your room which is very easy.
Breakfast is simple, but you don't really need much more. The food in the restaurant was tasty and not at all expensive. Rooms are spacious and clean , if you need anything else staff will get it for you within an instance.
The gem of the hotel is Brian the driver. He is the friendliest most genuinely courteous man we have ever had the pleasure to meet. He gave us the best tips for sightseeing and real Irish experiences. He is an asset to this hotel; make sure you meet him when you visit Kimainham Hilton. 

Thank you for a lovely weekend!

240,"Nice hotel, lovely staff","I liked this hotel. I stayed there for business for 5 nights. Very clean, comfortable. Wonderful fitness center. Staff was extremely nice. Free wi-fi. The only point to improve - the breakfast. Usually breakfasts in Hiltons are incredible. This one is different. However if the breakfast is not the main meal of your day - it is ok. The location is not so nice: far from the center and very far from Convention Center which I needed to visit every day.
Anyway, the hotel is nice and worth staying - like all Hiltons!",4,2011,02,28
240,Warm welcome in Dublin,"Stayed here for 3 nights using points at the end of February. Asked for a quiet room and got one in the back. It is a quiet neighborhood anyway and the windows are pretty soundproof. 

Overall the hotel is in great shape and the staff are gracious. A bit far out of the City Centre, but you can take the bus right into town. The buses stop around 11:30 so then it is a 10-minute, 10-Euro cab ride. Across the street is the Kilmainham Gaol, one of the most historic sights in Ireland. 

One disappointment was the king bed. It was two twins pushed together so we had the crack going down the middle and my feet hanging over the edge. I know that is common in Europe but thought it would be different at a Hilton.

We were told we had to plug-in our computer to use the free Internet. Our computer didn't have the right outlet so lwe ogged into their Wi-Fi which was really slow. Maybe you really do need to plug it in.

We came back late one night and ate at the restaurant. Surprisingly, the pasta dish compared favorably with those we recently had in Bologna, Italy.

Brian, the VIP driver for the airport, is a great ambassador for the hotel and Ireland tourism. Overall we would recommend this hotel.",4,2011,02,27
240,horrible hotel,"This was a very disappointing stay this hotel, our family booked a weekend here for my husband and I for a Christmas present, we were very much looking forward to it as we don‚Äôt get to spend a lot of time together because of work and family commitments....
Arrived on the Friday night late, had breakfast on the Saturday morning, we got taken to a table without a good morning we felt the staff had no personal customer skills they were all from Europe (not that we have anything against that) but it would of been nice to speak to someone from Ireland. we then got asked if we would like coffee or tea, we both said tea our breakfast was finished before we got a pot of tea, we had to ask 3 times for the tea to be brought to the table,  this also happened on the Sunday morning too, but the most important thing  that spoiled this weekend break was our evening meal on the Saturday, we ordered our starters which was cold, we ate it and said nothing didn‚Äôt want to make a fuss the restaurant only had 4 couples so it wasn‚Äôt that the staff were over worked, our main course came which was steak which cost extra on the menu, i ordered med well done steak, it came with the blood running from it i ask if it could be taken back, which the member of staff did no fault there, she then came back and said it would be ready in 6mins, i waited 15mins before it came back and then they expected me to eat this steak which had been waiting in the kitchen to be brought out and was now cold, with the veg and potatoes that had been sitting on the table  freezing i then complained and they took the veg and potatoes away to get warmed and left the steak, i wait another 5mins, by this stage my husband‚Äôs meal was over, at the end i walked out of the restaurant with tears in my eye‚Äôs i just couldn‚Äôt believe that my whole weekend was getting spoiled by a Hilton hotel who hire‚Äôs staff that really didn‚Äôt know what they were doing, i got no apology from the staff what so ever, the whole meal experiences was terrible. rroms were good so if your thinking of staying here book room only",2,2011,02,24
240,Not a winner for me,"For the weekend of the Ireland and France game, my boyfriend and I stayed here.  We arrived ealier than the check in time of 3 and the room was not ready. As a result we lefted our bags and returned  later that afternoon. Upon returing our room were still not ready and we waited another ten minutes for check in. Finally we found our room, it was nice, bright and airy.  We got ready to go out and lefted for the night. The following morining when we awoke, we found our sheets and duvet to be stained with what looked like beer spills and stains. It was disappointing and some what sicking  to think that we had both slept in a bed that had no clean bed linen. The bed may have been redressed as the hotel was full for the night. We had stayed in Hilton Dublin Airport and thought that it would be of the same standard. Having paid a nice price for a room rate, we were both some what annoyed that the hygiene of the hotel, lefted us with something to think about.",2,2011,02,16
240,"Fantastic hotel!  Bright, clean rooms and delicious breakfast.","Loved this place.  The staff was wonderful.  Checked us in early after we arrived from an overnight international flight.  Rooms were spacious, modern, and very bright due to the huge window.  Most incredible hotel bathroom I've had.  Loved the rainfall showerhead.  Also very bright and modern.  We chose this place instead of the Best Western downtown were the rest of our travelling companions stayed because we had little kids with us and wanted a quiet place with a pool.  The rooms were much quieter (one of our friends was up all night from the bar next to the Best Western), and the beds were very comfortable.  Workout center was very nice.  Warning to those with little ones...the pool hours for the kids are limited.  Delicious breakfast!  We didn't have a car.  We just used the hop-on tour bus which conveniently had a stop across the street.   Overall, I highly recommend this hotel!",5,2011,02,07
240,Nice hotel but terrible location!,"Stayed in the Hilton with my family in January. The rooms are clean, comfortable and well decorated. If you opt for a twin room (double + 1 single) space gets a bit limited. 
Not a problem though, with one child. Consider a larger room if you have more than one.

Breakfast has all you need to start the day. The area were the hotel is located isn't great, so try get a rate with breakfast included otherwise you'll have to trek into the city to get your breakfast fix.

Room service was excellent and reasonably priced. If you prefer to grab some takeout pizza, try Four Star Pizza which is 2 minutes walk away (beside the Statoil garage).

Like many others have stated this hotel is nowhere near the city centre, couple this with the steep overnight parking charge and you may find a hotel in the city offering you a similar overall rate.

You only get one day free internet access, which is very disappointing for a hotel of this standard!

On the plus side, there is a nice gym and a small indoor pool (heated).

Overall,  a nice hotel but steep parking charges , internet access costs and its location let it down.",3,2011,01,31
240,"very clean, great facilities and staff; a bit of a trek from city centre",We had a very enjoyable stay and great time in Dublin - despite the cold weather; tip -best way to get to city centre (other than a cab) is to walk through the lovely grounds of the Musuem of Modern Art (opposite the hotel) to Heuston Station and pick up the tram,4,2011,01,30
240,Up to my expectations again,"My third stay at this hotel so I have gotten to know my way around a bit- still as clean as the first time I stayed here when it was new- food was great again and the staff is good.  There were some staff that were very friendly and the others seemed they could take it or leave it- never rude but seemed a bit disinterested in what was going on.  Not a reason to keep me from returning but something they could work on for sure.  Bed and linens were great, bathroom is good but they have the strangest shower doors ever (same as last two times)... I hope if they do a refit they change them- just strange.
Overall another great stay at the Kilmainham Hilton and hope to be back again.",5,2011,01,19
240,HILTON MMMMM WHAT A JOKE !!,"We booked a delux king room witha balcony and that is what we got. 1st night we had no hot water so called reception and got a rude lady, so she sent up a gentleman who told us that you will now have hot water as they turned it of as nobody staying in that wing of the hotel mmmm we were and we paid 199 euro's per night. Then breakfast, when we lifted the plates up their was butter portion papers stuck 2 them and the plates etc were so dirty. We waited 20min for 2 fried eggs with only 9 people in the dining room.  Their was no good morning or nothing else said as all of the staff come from abroad, in 4 days we never saw 1 irish member of staff, just awful. Then on the 2nd night the drs going from the bedroom to your balcony or should i say(, you share the same balcony with 6 or 7 rooms)The doors on each side were banging none stop for 2 in a half hr's, phoned reception and got the very rude lady again who put the phone down on me but i phoned back again, so the manager came up and moved us to another room but it wasen't what we paided for so off we go to another room this time bed broken so moved again to another room with no balcony and no shower not what we paid for . Then on the 2nd last morning the housemaid staff just walked into our room no knock or a spoken word my husband said hello and they went back out. We came back to the hotel at 8pm that night to find that our room had not been done!!!

I did get a email from the manager saying that he had adressed the problems, this problems did not appear ove night and they want go away overnight either. I was offered to come back for a free  night DBB but we live in scotland, did ask for the free night in Scotland but waiting for a reply. Yes i will go back to Ireland but will never go back to this hotel again. No way should this hotel be called a HILTON!!",1,2011,01,17
240,Not Disappointed,"My wife and I and our 2 young children stayed for 2 nights and very much enjoyed the experience. We chose the hotel based on the reviews here on tripadvisor and we were not disappointed.

The hotel truly has the feel of a 4-star. It is modern and very well decorated. The service was top class with all staff being very professional and friendly.

We ate from the room service menu one evening and the food was very tasty. Breakfast was nothing special but no complaints.

According to the hotel's website, the hydrotherapy pool is not suitable for under 8s but they are not prevented from using the pool and my 2 kids (6 & 3) really enjoyed it with the various water jets, etc.

We found the hotel to be a good base and we visited Imaginosity in Sandyford and the Natural History Museum in Merrion Square. We also toured Kilmainham Jail which is just across the road from the hotel and well worth a visit. I also had to travel to a meeting in Swords near the airport and it took only 20 minutes approx by car.

The hotel was very quiet while we were there and, as a result, lacked a little atmosphere but with 2 young kids that probably wasn't a bad thing.

I would look forward to having the opportunity to stay again.",5,2011,01,06
240,Great hotel great staff,I stayed here for 2 nights got a great weekend rate from the hilton weekend sale with breakfast included our room was a  King hilton deluxe  the room was a great size and good size bathroom the staff were very helpful. The food was lovely and the breakfast had a lot of choice and was really nice the only problem we had was the internet was having problems and was down our stay but they did tell us about the problem .,5,2011,01,05
240,Nice rooms and good jacuzzi and sauna,Rooms were nice.  Bus journey into the centre of Dublin.  Breakfast was nice.,4,2011,01,03
240,This was a very nice hotel,I visited Dublin in October for the dublin marathon and stayed a night at the Hilton Dublin Kilmainham.  The stay was nice and we enjoyed ourselves. With the Hop-on Hop-off bus stopping right in front of the hotel it is a very conveniant location.  It is quiet at night around the area but they have some excellent pubs across the street from the hotel. I would recommend staying here..it was quite enjoyable. The porter Brian did an excellent job recommending places to see while in Dublin.,5,2010,12,28
240,Great hotel and location,"We drove from the Dublin airport straight to the Hilton and it was a nice, short drive. They have a covered garage for your car, and a stop for the Dublin Hop On, Hop Off bus is right across the street. The hotel is a little outside of the city center which is what we wanted. The rooms were nice and they have a great buffet breakfast. This hotel was perfect for our 1 night in Dublin and we would definitely stay here again.",5,2010,12,15
240,A good hotel with a very helpful porter!,"I stayed at the hotel for two nights with some friends.  We were very happy with the hotel -the rooms were great - the only thing not so good was the spa area - you had to wear hats if you wanted to go in the pool (which was tiny so we didn't bother)  Our stay was made far better than it might have been by the helpfulness of the porter, Brian.  He found out what we were interested in and directed us towards lovely places and restaurants and (very wisely) away from some of the most crowded areas on a football match night!",4,2010,12,15
240,Good hotel - if you get a good price,"We booked this for 1 night, for a 'quick' weekend city break, and got an good rate of around ¬£70 a night, for room only. On arriving to check in, was treated very quickly 

Hotel was around 20-30minute taxi ride from the airport and 10 minute taxi ride from the city centre. Check in was quick and efficient, offered free WiFi and was given advice on how to get around - as the weather was quite bad with a lot of snow and ice we were pretty limited to walking or taxis, which for such a short visit you do not mind. I had expected, as Hilton Honors silver card member (now gold) to be maybe offered an upgrade, but no problem as there were a lot of tourists around.

Room was a good size, very clean and bathroom modern, with a great powerful shower.

Stay was very pleasant and good Hilton standard, if you were on a very short trip and had lots planned, I would maybe look closer, but if you have a bit of time or not a busy itinerary you could do a lot worse. My only gripe, was the excessively long check out queue and seemed very dis-organised (only 2 of the 3 or 4 desks were open.)",4,2010,12,12
240,"Great location and facilties, very comfortable but overpriced.","Second time around in this hotel.  Disappointed that the first family room was very small indeed and we were put into a more appropriate sized one after requesting it., still not a great size though.  Considering the hotel was not busy, it would have been good PR to give us the better room from the off.  The overnight parking for guests is a complete rip off and a lot of hassle, getting tickets checked at reception and again at the car park.  Overall the ambience of the hotel, location and friendly staff counteract these negativities.",4,2010,11,27
240,Somewhat disappointed,"My wife and two friends were really looking forward to our 3-night stay in Dublin. When we arrived to our room, the a/c wasn't working. Front desk said to give it awhile to react. No good. Phoned again and they sent a technician!. No good. They moved us to another room on another floor, away from our friends but with working a/c.  The room had a really foul smell near the bathroom; whilst the a/c worked it was extremely noisy, a vibration in the unit.The fridge didn't work, but they got it going for us and the room door gave the most unearhtly groan every time it was opened.  All this was not what we expected from a Hilton.  Then on our second and third mornings, the hotel allowed a company to carry out job interviews an a room further down the corridor.  Chairs lined one side of the corridor for over 24-rs. (Potential fire hazard?) This also was untidy, unprofessional and slightly off-putting for hotel guests.  Funny how we needed our room key to operate the lift for the upper floors for security purposes yet the general public had access for interviews.  This is a hotel that boasts any number of conference and meeting rooms which one would think would be better suited for interviews.
Despite all this the hotel itself was fine, if clinical and the breakfast was top rate.",3,2010,11,23
240,Love This Hotel,"Just back from a great weekend in Dublin, made all the more special by the great staff and facilities in the Hilton - Kilmainham.
From the minute my wife and I walked into the hotel we were made feel genuinely welcome and the food in the bar was top notch.
The room had a king size bed, and it was very very comfortable.
We were going to originally stay for just 1 night but we decided to stay a 2nd night we enjoyed it so much.
This isnt our first stay in this hotel and I can guarantee you that it wont be our last either !",5,2010,11,07
240,still top of our list for a Dublin trip,"A second family trip in Dublin within 6 months and the first thing I was instructed to do was to book the Hilton again. And again it didn't disappoint. Everything about this hotel is excellent: the superfriendly and helpful staff; the bright, clean and spacious rooms; the leisure centre; the food (particularly the breakfast). Our family of 5 enjoyed another terrific Dublin weekend and the Hilton Kilmainham played a large part in that.",5,2010,11,04
240,Brian and Marlene provided excellent service-Very friendly,"We stayed here for two nights-husband is sick and the staff were so pleasant and accomodating. Especially Brian (the porter) and Marlene (Reception).
We will be back!",5,2010,11,02
240,Great Service,Brian the concerge was just great! Good guidance on what attractions to see and which restaurants to eat at.,4,2010,10,26
240,Excellent Hotel,"We stayed in a King Hilton Studio Suite for one night the room was spacious but I would not consider it a Junior Suite. The bathroom was a good size with separate shower and bath. The hotel had lovely toiletries La Source from Crab tree and Evelyn. Also included in the room was 2 bathrobes and two pairs of slippers. The room had plenty of wardrobe space and drawers. Also provided was a safe and hair-dryer. The kingsize bed was comfortable although the pillows were hollow fibre and where dreadfully uncomfortable. The room had a desk area with desk chair and a large enough flat screen television. Also was a seating area with two chairs and a table. The room did have a mini bar which was un stocked, the Hotel informed me that as they offer 24 hr room service the did not stock the mini bars in the rooms.

The balcony was a communal one which had a table and chairs being October it was to cold to use. It did have great views of Dublin and the Mountains. The Air con in the room was not working and there where no windows in the room so I didn't have a great nights sleep.
 
We had Lunch and Dinner in the Hotel which was excellent. For lunch I had the beef burger which was very nice although expensive at 14 Euro. At Dinner we had the Fillet Steak which was delicious, Michelle our waitress was great and couldn't do enough for us. Overall it wasn't to badly priced. 

Breakfast was a buffet style and was fantastic with plenty of variety. 

Checkout was quick and the receptionists are very helpful.",4,2010,10,26
240,will be back again !!!,"fantastic hotel!! we stayed for 2 nights. hotel was so quiet, slept like a log both nights. hotel was really clean and room was lovely and big. all staff were fantastic, especially the in house taxi driver and the bar staff (who made a great strawberry daquiri!) If we travel to dublin again, we will definately be contacting the hilton!! Couldn't recommend it highly enough!",5,2010,10,24
240,Return visit,Beautiful hotel waiting staff very friendly especially lavinia an declan really nice! Barstaff on the nite a little cold bit all round very nice hotel will definately be back!!,4,2010,10,23
240,"Every Hotel should have a ""BRIAN""","We four friends spent two nights this week in the Hilton Kilmainham..first time. Felt special and welcome by the lovely receptionists..and as we had not used a security card in the lift..(to be highly recommended) BRIAN came to our assistance. His cheery face,  genuine personality and care throughout our stay, was beyond the call of duty. Irish hospitality at its best. Thank you Brian. Thanks also to manager Peter, all the friendly staff and Lavinia who served our wonderful dinner. Will definitely be back. D&H Co. Galway",5,2010,10,23
240,As they say in Ireland - grand!,"Thanks to the staff at Kilmainham Hilton - friendly, courteous, helpful.
We stayed at the Kilmainham Hilton three times in the space of two weeks as we came and went from Dublin. The staff were great and welcomed us back each time and happily stored our luggage while we tripped away.  
The only reason why I rated it less than perfect for location is because some may prefer to be closer to the heart of things.  We liked the location as it gave us easy access in and out of the centre as well as to places further afield.  It's slight distance from the centre - only 15 mins by bike - meant that is was also quieter.  Very restful stay.  The Kilmainham Gaol well worth a visit.",5,2010,10,22
240,Ask for Brian from the Lodges and the Aussie,"Stayed for 4 nights 5days with family. The last day was one of our highlights spent with Brian on a trip up the mountains for a reasonable fee very informative lots of jokes and a great day. We had a wonderful meal with a great waitress sofia who saved my camra(cos i left it) pheww thank god she is trustworthy!!
The hotel was very clean lovely beds a great sauna and pool. But again ask for Brian he cant do enough for you, oh and by the way he's not employed by the hilton he's there hidden gem !!",5,2010,10,19
240,3 particular staff members made our stay that extra special,"Pre phoned for an 8am check-in (no extra cost). Brian in the Main reception area was very friendly and very helpful for advice on transport and the best tourist hotspots to visit. Janet and Lukas on Reception were also helpful and friendly. These 3 particular staff members made our stay more welcoming than any other hotels I have been to. We may choose Hilton for our business hotels in the future based on this.

My Room was a studio suite 532, excellent spacious room; great view definitely was worth every penny.

If you do want to really chill out, go down to the fitness area for water facilities, they may be small but vast in features. The water wasn‚Äôt too overpowering from chlorine and the jets were dotted all around, very powerful and relaxing",5,2010,10,19
240,Wonderful,"The Hilton Kilmainham is a very good hotel. The room was very spacious, modern, and clean.

The staff is very polite and helpful. 

Contrary to some reviews it is quite easy to get around Dublin from the hotel. Bus stops and light rail is within 5 - 10 minutes of the hotel.

The bar and pool are top shelf.

The hotel offers private tours conducted by Brian. Brian is a wonderful man and tour guide. He is very knowledgeable. We spent two full days with Brian. He treated us as if we were members of his family.

We highly recommend the hotel.",5,2010,10,18
240,best service ever - ask for Brian!!!,My wife and I needed a taxi and some information and Brian could not have been nicer - even showed my wife and | photos on his cell phone - he had the taxi called for us and while  we waited he waited told us a million things to do and gave us tips to save money and time.  Worth a stay just to enjoy Brian's friendly smile and service.,5,2010,10,18
240,So So - Average,"So my partner booked this hotel for a romantic break - and hummm what can I say - apart from 'so so'. The Hotel had all the potential to be fab but it just wasn't... the room was 'pretty' clean, The mirror in our bathroom was broken, there was a five euro charge for room service, the Pool had cracks along the wall...the staff were polite but not overly so.  That said the bed was really comfy and the room was spacey...

what did it lack - I guess any kind of soul/character or any little extras..

Yes so if your looking for something special then this isn't the hotel, If your looking for a 'business' hotel then yes you will have a comfortable stay and a good sleep...

note its a fair walk into town center but there are regular buses.",3,2010,10,17
240,Very nice hotel,"Stayed at the Hilton Dublin Kilmainham as part of a tour.  We started out the tour at the Hilton, and ended it there a week later.  The hotel is very modern, with great ammenities.  It was my first time in Europe, and a hotel like this set the standard for hotels that I want to stay in during future visits.  We had a king sized bed that was extremely comfortable, and the bedding was up-to-date and very fashionable.  The restaurant served delicious dinner, and the breakfast buffet offered many choices of hot and cold items, with a variety of beverages.  There is a pool at the hotel, but we did not use it.  The business center has 2 computers and a printer, which made the airline online check in a snap.  There is a pub across the street that serves adult beverages and Italian meals (an Irish pub, Italian food, and they play American music!)  The Kilmainham Prison is across the street, and is a must see tourist stop in Dublin.  I would stay here again.",4,2010,10,12
240,Out of the Way for Tourists - Bring Copy of Your Reservation,"Decent modern hotel that is out of the way for tourists visiting.  It is about a 10 minute walk to the Luas (tram) to take into the center city.   

The room was quiet and quite large - nice bathroom with a great shower head.

We checked in at 5PM for our room which should have been ready.  We were given a room and went to it and immediately knew it was not right (we booked a family room for three people).  Luckily I had printed out a copy of the reservation since that was the only proof I had that I had booked a family room.  Went downstairs and asked for the room we had booked and there was not one ready for 1.5 hours - so we said we would wait in the bar.  If that was my hotel I would have said 'please wait in the bar and have a pint on us' - but of course that did not happen.  Went back to the front desk at 6:30PM and the room was still not ready.   Frustrating beginning to the two night stay.  

Nice bar area - great service in the bar (not reception).",3,2010,10,10
240,Not my choice of hotel,"second stay at this hotel and for a lot of reasons it should be good - but I'm not happy with it.   The rooms are OK except that in each of the last 2 stays I have had to complain about the air conditioning not working correctly and even though it was not too hot outside, it was over-warm in the room.     The showers don't keep the water in them so it goes all over the floor.    Breakfast is good though.   While the location is good for some tourist events, it is a cab ride into town.

Food was quite good in the restaurant though.   Certainly better than your average hotel restaurant.

Overall I prefer the Dublin Hilton - unfortunately they just started taking coach tours there, so it has been full on both my last two visits.",3,2010,10,01
240,"Not bad, but not really 4 star.","In many ways this hotel is quite good. The rooms are spacious, we had a King Suite with a balcony, one of the best and most expensive rooms. But the key was lost for the balcony so we couldn't get out onto it. Moans about the key were not met by the reception desk with any particluar concern, 'These things take a while', said the receptionist. Well it did, the key arrived on our third day, when we were leaving the following morning. Outside on the terrace there were 20 tables and one ashtray, so smokers were periodically getting up and wandering over to the one ashtray, apologising to the occupants of the table and laughing at the ridiculousness of it. The automated mini-bar in our suite was empty. However, the food was good, the service from the delightful waitresses was excellent, the rooms were immaculately cleaned and serviced.  My assessment of this hotel is that the lower echelons were  excellent, smiling, obliging and careful with their guests, but the higher echelons, in particular the management, need a closer look. The hotel is basically ok, but most of the Hiltons at which I have stayed are more attentive to detail than this one.  That is down to management. This is the only Hilton I have stayed in where the mini-bar has been empty or a key could not be found in less than 3 days. And finally, the star of the Kilmainham is Brian, Public Relations. This charming man directed us to the buses, to the sights, gave us endless advice about how to enjoy Dublin and made our holiday. Nothing was too much trouble for him.  If they made him the manager they might get 5 stars. At the moment, with what they've got, they're struggling with the 4.",3,2010,09,27
240,Very Pleasant,"Spent a night here for Micheal Buble Concert, no quibbles even though hotel was full, room spacious and very clean, great buffet breakfast and a nice swim/soak in the leisure centre, would stay again for sure",4,2010,09,27
240,DISGRACEFUL AND VERY UNPROFESSIONAL,Booked 8 months prior and arrived at 11pm after a long flight only to be told the revenue manager had decided to book our room for someone else and we had to cab 30 min to another hotel. Then we had to cab back to Hilton in the morning.  They were happy to have us for second night of the booking. This is not iRISH this disrespectful and rude.,1,2010,09,17
240,Show loyality to frequent stayers???,"I have stayed 30 nights at this already hotel in 2010, the quality of the hotel and staff are great. However when I find I want to book a leisure break for a night. I am quoted 200 Euros??

Because of the All Ireland Weekend they have put up their prices. When I pointed out my stay history it was reduced but not to the normal rate.

Do the Hilton want to lose my business over this?? Seems so.",4,2010,09,11
240,"Location, Location, Location! Great Hotel!","The Hilton in Kilmainham is situated next to the Kilmainham Jail and the Museum of Modern Art. Also, it's across the street from one of the stops for the Hop-on/Hop-off buses. Overall, we really enjoyed out stay and I highly recommend this hotel for anyone who is not sure about where to stay in Dublin. You won't regret it.

The staff were very helpful and very kind. We needed help with several minor problems and they were patient and helpful.  I hate it when hotel staff make me feel like I am bothering them. I never felt that. 

The rooms were clean and we had no problems with them at all. I appreciate that the bathrooms were so nice. The hotel provides free internet, but you need to get a userID and password from the front desk. I think normally they give it to you, but if they forget, just ask them.

We had breakfast both mornings and it was good. The breakfast atmosphere is pretty important when you are in a foreign place because it can help to set the mood for the entire day. No disappointments whatsoever. 

Location. As I wrote, you have the Kilmainham Jail just across the street which every taxi driver will recommend you visit. If you are visiting Ireland to understand their struggle for independence from British rule, I highly recommend it. If you are Ireland just to relax and view sites, I'll leave it up to you. I'm not going to review this attraction anywhere else, but I'll tell you that it was an hour-long tour, and we waited about 20 minutes before that started. Plan for that. The tour guide was very nice and knowledgable as you would expect, so no disappointments there.
The bus stop is across from the hotel and right in front of the Jail. I definitely recommend these as the tickets are good fro a 24-hour period and get you quickly where you need to go even if you just need transportation.
Heuston Station on the Irish Rail is about 5-10 minutes by taxi and we used the train to go to Galway on our way to Ashford Castle, so that was convenient as well.

The business center, just around from the front desk, has two computers and a very fast laser printer. It was convenient to use in case you don't have your own computer.

Overall, this hotel was very convenient and a great experience. I highly recommend this to travelers of any type! I couldn't really justify giving anything less than five stars on everything. It was a pretty great experience.",5,2010,09,08
240,This place was great! Very quiet!,"This was a great stay with wonderful rooms, beds, linens, and front desk staff! The food was great as well!",5,2010,09,07
240,"Great location, fab hotel, V.friendly staff","We stayed here for a 2 night break, although the hotel was busy staff were very welcoming and friendly and gave lots of advise on buses and things to do. 
rooms were clean and spacious, (only downside as with lots of hotels, rooms and lobbies were very WARM!). Breakfast at the hotel was good, plenty of choice and again staff were also very welcoming. Would def stay again!",4,2010,09,06
240,"Good room , good pool and good location","The quality of Hilton should be good. Yes, it is good. Not only in the room, also the service.
In the beginning, I am afraid the location will be too far from city center. Finally, I discover it is located close to the modern art museum. The garden of modern art museum is large and beautiful. We only need to take 10 mins bus to city center and there are many lines operate there. The 'hip on hip off tourist bus' also operates in front of Hilton. The only point that make us feel inconvenient is laking of restaurant. Include Hilton, there is only 3 restaurant. One is Chinese take away and another is expensively Italian restaurant. It is more expensive than city center. Anyway, it is good. Don't hesitate for the location. It is also good.",5,2010,09,04
240,great place,great place to stay about 25mins steady walk in to the city centre easy parking under the hotel 10euro for 24hrs hotel staff and room all first rate food very good we would stay again next time dublin calls !,4,2010,09,04
240,Friendly staff,"We stayed for the weekend. The hotel was really nice, clean rooms, good location and good facilities. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful, and couldn't do enough. In particular a friendly employee Brian was a star, and offered advice and help thoughout our stay.",4,2010,08,23
240,Not four star service,"Didn't stay at this hotel but visited the bar for lunch having visited Kilmainham Gaol. We ordered drinks and lunch but by the time the drinks came, lunch was brought at the same time. There were five of us in the group and we all had a light starter except for my brother who odered the Prawn Thai Green Curry. The prawns still had the tails on which was bad in a curry. To his horror one of the prawns still had the intestines inside it and thankfully it was the last prawn on the plate.He told the waitress this and asked her to bring it to the attention of the Chef. She returned and said she had spoken with the chef who had said unfortunately he would have to pay for the meal but he could have a 'free coffee'. We were all a bit stunned by this remark as we were not looking for a free meal. My brother was not happy with this so asked to speak with the Manager.When he finally came, my brother explained the situation and he immediately said he would not have to pay for the meal and offered him a drink on the house. We decided to order deserts and coffee. The coffees came about 10 minutes later and we had all finished our coffees by the time the deserts came, which took 20 minutes in total. The service was appalling and the bar was not even busy. Not 4* service and I certainly won't be visiting the bar again.",2,2010,08,20
240,Excellent hotel in a convenient location,"Compared to other similar hotels in Dublin, the Hilton Kilmainham provides excellent value. The hotel location is close to the Luas Red Line and allows reasonably quick access to central Dublin.

The hotel was spotless and the staff were friendly and efficient. Checkin was one of the quickest I've ever encountered. The food in the hotel was excellent. In general this hotel exceeded expectations on all counts.

Would use this hotel again",4,2010,08,19
240,Love it!,"I don't know if it is Hilton that has it right or this hotel specifically, but it's clean, comfortable and the staff are friendly!  
With prices of hotels in the city gone crazy, this hotel is not out of walking distance, but also close to a Luas line that will take you right into the centre of town.  But in itself not far from Phoenix park if the weather is good - the perfect place to spend the day for a picnic or visit the Zoo!
It is a relatively new hotel so can be expected to be clean - but it is spotless and the leisure facilities are great again for a city hotel - not often found.  
I've stayed here about 3 times now and the I can definitely vouch for consistency and good value.",4,2010,08,18
240,Wonderful stay,"We spent 3 nights at this hotel in a King Deluxe room.
We had a good discount so we can't be objective about the ratio quality/price.
Everything was perfect : it was clean, the room was big and confortable, the staff was very friendly.
It's easy to go to the city center by bus (- 10 mn).
The area is also very quiet and the view from the rooms and hotel is beautiful.
We recommend this hotel without hesitation.",5,2010,08,15
240,Great hotel in a convenient location,"My husband and I stayed with our 7 year old son in the Hilton Kilmainham for 5 nights about two weeks ago.We truly enjoyed the stay. The rooms were very clean and the beds were excellent. We had a king sized bed and a single bed in the room, so the three of us had plenty of room to sleep. 
The free complimentary breakfast, was more a breakfast banquet and had everything from fresh fruit and cereal to typical Irish breakfast.
The staff was helpful and very friendly.
Our son especially loved the pool, which was connected to a fitness studio.

The location was great.close enough to walk to the center of the city - about 20 mins easy stroll and not too expensive to use a cap - about 10 Euros. All the caps we used had wonderful drivers ,who gave us many tips  where to go and what to do.

We enjoyed Ireland and Dublin a lot and we definitely will return and when we are in Dublin we will stay in the Hilton Kilmainham again.",5,2010,08,12
240,Good for a relaxing day at the spa,"The staff are accommodating, they allowed us to check-in 2 hours earlier than the normal check-in time. This hotel stay comes with free wifi connection, gym and spa facilities like jacuzzi and sauna. Great if you are looking forward to a relaxing dip in the pool with your spouse. No balcony for our room though. 
The in-house restaurant serves fantastic dinner that are value-for-money, go for their chicken and ribs (if available). As for their breakfast, it's the typical stuff from Hilton. We didn't spend much time outside the hotel, thus can't comment much on the attractions or restaurants in the vicinity. If you are traveling by LUAS, it is about 10mins walking from the nearest LUAS station.",5,2010,08,10
240,"Not too bad, but","service in restaurant and bar is lousy. Kitchen mediocre. Fridge and movies don't work (""service provider bankrupt""). Pool OK, but half of the massage jets don't work. THE HOTEL IS LACKING A MANAGER WHO CARES. Rooms nice, but airco didn't work out of 4 days. Location reflected in the price. If you go downtown, take a taxi (EUR 10-15) or the hop-on hop-off bus (EUR 16 for 48hrs, for one adult and one (or two?) kids. Try the pub and the restaurant across the street - fine Italian food and realistic prices. Kilmainhaim Goal visit a must with very good guides. Art Museum a nice walk, good architecture but exhibitions not really what you would expect from a national museum. Oh, I don't forget all the nice taxis an well educated drivers. And the guides. Awesome",2,2010,07,27
240,Lovely hotel apart from staff in back office!!!,"We were met by a lovely young irish girl janet on reception who couldnt do enough for us, We were put in a room that smelt of smoke, so janet moved us to another room without any hesitation and in this room the air conditioning didnt work so i rang down to receptionist  who assured us she would send someone to fix it, on our return from our day trip the air conditioning wasnt fixed so i asked to see a manager who appeared from the back room  in a uniform obviously a size to small which isnt professional  in my mind, who explained it wasnt her problem it was a maintenance problem!!! she was very rude and un-professional!  but apart from that the hotel is very clean and smart, the food is lovely and the rest of the staff are brilliant especially the receptionist janet, Thanks!",4,2010,07,26
240,Fabulous Stay,We stayed here on points our first night in Dublin. The staff were outstanding and we enjoyed our stay. The breakfast was great and we received free internet. The rooms were large and comfortable. This is also across the street from Kilmainham prison wich is a required tour to learn about Irish history.,5,2010,07,24
240,Great Hotel,"Really enjoyed our stay here. I stayed here for three nights in July. 
I found the rooms were clean with plenty of storage. 
Our second night there we came back to find our nightclothes folded on our bed. That was a nice touch.
Our first night we ate in the hotel. The food was really nice with a good choice for my son and me. 
Breakfast was great, plenty to eat and lots of choice. 
Staff were friendly and very helpful. 
It's in a great location nearly kilmainham Gaol and busses take you into town. 
I didn't get around to using the pool but wish I did. 
My room was right oppiside the lifts and I thought I was in for a noisy few nights but I wasn't. This hotel was very quite. 
I would go back again.",5,2010,07,22
240,Decent Hotel,"Stayed here three times now, nice spot for a weekend away.

The gym facitilies are great (but last time I was there quite a bit of the pool could of done with a refurb.. lots of the buttons for the jets weren't working and some of the tiles had come off). Location is grand - Gaol is just opposite, 15 min walk to Guinness Store House, 20 min walk through the park to the Zoo. Taxi / Bus ride away from Centre - definately not walkable. Well, you could but it would take you a while.

Here's a tip - take the bus into the centre of town (it's normally day time and comes very regularly and is a straight route) then get the taxi back (due to the one way system in Dublin, taxi home is quite cheap, taxi to the centre is quite expensive for the distance).

Last time I stayed in the executive room. Not worth the extra cash - same sized room, only you get a shared balcony. Didn't realise it was shared till someone walked past the window as I had got out of the shower. Don't know who is more starteled. On the whole, great for a weekend away.",4,2010,07,15
240,A good hotel,"My daughters and I stayed in the Hilton in May. The hotel is well situated, easy to access from the M50 and a ten minute walk to the Luas stop. My daughters were attending a concert in the O2 and the Luas was very convenient. The rooms are comfortable and clean, although I had to send to the desk for assistance with the extremely complicated air conditioning system. We had dinner in the bar, which was really delicious. The breakfast was only so-so, a bit tired. The service was very good. The staff overall are pleasant and friendly. We would definitely stay again. The only negative is the disastrous parking system which is appallingly badly signposted.",4,2010,07,13
240,The Hilton is a great hotel and Brian is a great tour guide,"We recently stayed at the Hilton Kilmainham.  The staff was friendly and we were able to check in as soon as we arrived at 9:30 am.  The rooms were big with very comfortable beds.  The unique pool/fitness center is a great place to relax after a long day around town.  The breakfast was convenient to get before heading out for the day.  On our fourth day, Brian O'Reilly, the taxi driver in the lobby, took us on a tour of the surrounding areas of Dublin.  This tour was great.  We got to see a lot of the area which we otherwise would not have known about, while Brian talked about Ireland's history and stories of the area.  He took us to the Wicklow Mountains, the fishing village of Howth, a waterfall, the beaches, and Malahide.  It was a great tour with a lot to offer.  

Overall, it was a great vacation.  The hotel staff made great recommendations for dinner, and Brian's tour was a highlight of the trip.  Be sure to book him for a day tour of the surrounding areas of Dublin.  You will not be disappointed.",5,2010,07,13
240,Not a perfect start.....ended up being a great choice,"We are truly ""Hilton"" people.  In booking exclusively with Hilton Hotels, we typically know what we are getting and are very rarely disappointed.  Our stay at the Hilton Kilmainham ended up being what we expected of Hilton Hotels after a few minor problems.  Because our stay ended up being so great, I'll start by telling you about the positives.  I'll save the ""to be aware of..advice for the end of the review seeing those details didn't ruin our stay.   

The view/balcony off our room was spectacular.  Book a room with a view, you won't regret it!  The staff works very hard.  They are never idle.  They handle guests respectfully at all times and are very efficient and friendly.  Having room service available 24 hours a day was a really nice touch.  We never thought we'd use it; however, with day light lasting until 10:30PM we found ourselves quickly adjusting to much longer days and often stayed out very late.....after returning to the hotel after midnight several times, we were grateful to have a few food items to choose from the room service menu. The parking is incredibly convenient and reasonably priced.  The pool area has an incredibly unique design, truly worth using!  The unadvertised ""jewel"" of this hotel is their VIP driver, Brian O'Rielly.  We came across him one morning while looking at tourist site brochures in the lobby.  He introduced himself and asked if he could help us with our plans.  Brian then sat with us and listened to what we were planning on doing.  He offered suggestions about scheduling/coordinating activities and even presented us with some other attractions to consider.  It was later that we found out he was the hotel's VIP driver.  We ended up ""booking"" a day of touring with Brian.  He actually planned the day for us working around the activities/places we had already seen in Ireland.  We brought 6 people with us and his vehicle easily accommodated us comfortably.  All along the way, Brian shared stories (past and present) about Ireland.  Not scripted, like a bus tour, the real deal.  Every time we finished at a ""stop"" another family member stole the ""coverted"" best seat in the car....the one beside Brian!!!   It started off feeling like a tour but quickly changes to something much more natural and spontaneous.  That was definately one of the best days we spent in Ireland.   
...a few ""to be aware of points...."" I only mention these because for some people it could be a bigger deal to them.  Our 1st trouble was with finding rooms both on-line and by phone reservation that physically accommodated 5 people with 5 large suitcases.  Luckily, when we arrived there were other rooms available other than what we had booked and the staff was very willing to work with us to make us more comfortable.  If we had to stay in the room set up we booked, I don't think it would have been a comfortable situation.  We had to call upon the maintence staff to deal with A/C problems (Ireland was in a heat wave while we were there) twice and shower drain problems too.  Both situations were quickly responded to.  We did not find the mattress/pillows as comfortable as we are use to with Hilton Hotels; however, they were definitely acceptable. All of those ""issues"" came up within the 1st day of our stay.  After that, we really didn't have any negative experiences.",4,2010,07,11
240,Wonderful experience,"I stayed at the Hilton back in May with a friend and her son, it was such a great experience, not only the amazing facilities but the wonderful and outstanding staff in the hotel, always willing to help out whenever possible and well prepared, totally up to the Hilton standards.
Breakfast service even when busy was completely under control and the food was lovely.
The location, even if not in the middle of the city centre its only an 8 minute tram ride from the centre, but overall the location is greatly situated in a very historical area, including the viking area.
I would completely recommend this hotel anytime and Dublin, I felt completely taken care of and relaxed at all times... such a magical city!",5,2010,07,09
240,Best Hilton a must if in Dublin. Brian is the added treasure that gives this hotel  the extra plus,"My son and I had the great experience of staying at the Hilton located in Kilmainham, a short walk outside of Dublin. As a Hilton Honors member I have seen great and no so good hotels, this is one of the best ! The extra effort to accommodate the guest is immediately noticed with the hotels direct relationship with Brian O'Reilly the taxis, tour guide, unofficial concierge a wealth of information with a smile. Brian can provide round trip from the airport, to town or an all day tour to areas outside of Dublin the bus cannot travel.  He is one of the reasons this hotel rises above other Hiltons, an invaluable asset.
Upon arrival the hotel had already prepared for our early arrival (9:00 AM and the rooms were ready, unheard of in most hotels). The front desk, Laura, Janet, Ann and others were always ready to help, very informative and pleasant. The hotel manager, Peter, compliments the outstanding job of the staff.  You will see the manager in the lobby throughout the day with a smile a ready to provide assistance. The rooms were equipment with full bathrooms, king beds and free internet, clean and comfortable. Additionally between touring and diner you can relax in the pool,, hot tub, steam or sauna.
Although it is not located directly in Dublin, it is a short 10 minute walk or quick cab ride to any area in center city. The location allowed us to experience the local neighborhood, pubs and restaurants. Directly across the street is the Kilmainham jail and the Patriot PUB where you can get a pint of Guinness and a sandwich, relax and enjoy the local atmosphere.

I cannot recommend this Hotel enough!!! Even if you are not staying at the Hilton, call and secure the services of Brian for a tour of towns, mountains and the coast. He was the icning on the cake for our stay at the Hilton.",5,2010,07,08
240,Great Hotel.,"I stayed here for one night in June 2010.  The hotel is great.  The rooms are typically Hilton, but as it's a new hotel, in much better condition than the one in Charlemont Place.  The breakfast is great, but try to get it included in your room rate, as it is quite expensive otherwise.  It's about 10euro in a taxi to Temple Bar, which I didn't mind.  There is also a bus across the road.  I'll definitely be back.",5,2010,07,02
240,Best hotel of our tour,"What a treat it was to stay in the hotel at the end of our tour of Ireland!  Fast and efficient check-in and amazing staff!  Front desk reception not only answered questions but cheerfully called a taxi for us as well as give us a map and show us exactly where we were and how to find things.  Wonderful rooms equipped with frig, safe, ironing board, hair dryer and even one 'American' outlet plug over by the large desk.  Comfy beds and great breakfast in the morning.",5,2010,06,22
240,Ideal Base - Excellent Value,"We stayed here in June and found the Hilton to be an ideal base from which to explore Dublin. It's 2 mins west of Heuston Station where you can get all the Luas and bus connections you need. Across the road is Kilmainham Gaol which is well worth a tour. But more importantly the Hilton is clean, warm, modern and the staff are very friendly. 

There's parking under the hotel but the signs are confusing - I turned left at the bottom of the ramp instead of right, and ended up in 'residents' parking (for the apartments attached to the Hilton)! Also, the parking ticket machine at the exit was broken, but pushing the 'help' button caused the barrier to go up so we could escape!

We booked through alpharooms.com late on a Friday to stay on a Saturday, so when we checked in, there was a long delay while the porter called alpharooms to sort something out - however the hotel assured us that they had a room for us, and they did. The room was bright, warm and clean with big windows overlooking the street. Those windows couldn't be opened, but the air-conditioning kept us cool on a humid day. 

My better half used the pool and found it fine if a little small. Late Saturday night we went into the bar for a drink and the waitress was good enough to get us a sandwich even though they had stopped serving food. Breakfast in the morning was served 'til 11 and there was plenty of everything. 

I'd heartily recommend the Hilton - the location, standard and service couldn't be faulted. We'll be back.",4,2010,06,22
240,Great Hotel for First Trip to Dublin,"We stayed at the Kilmainham Hilton on our first night in Ireland.  After arriving in Ireland on an over night flight we drove straight to this hotel and parked in their garage.  Miraculously, our 2 rooms were ready at 11 am, so we were able to get our selves unpacked and ready for our one day in Dublin.  Rooms were very modern and comfortable with every amenity.  Wireless connection, hair dryers, soaps, shampoos, extra pillows, etc.  Any noise from the road outside was blocked by thick windows.  Front desk clerks were helpful with our many questions!  This hotel was located across the street from the historic Kilmainham Goal (Jail).  We walked over to it and purchased a family ""Heritage Card"" which allowed us into all historical attractions in  Ireland maintained by the Office of Public Works for 55 Euro--best deal of the 10 days!  There are also stops for both of the ""hop off/Hop on"" tour busses operated in Dublin located across the street from this hotel.  We used the bus to avoid driving in Dublin.  Breakfast was good and extensive, but also expensive--about 19 Euro per person.  You can get a good room rate that includes the breakfast, but one of our rooms was secured with Hilton points, so we had to buy the breakfast buffet.  I would recommend this hotel highly to anyone who didn't mind staying in the outlying areas of Dublin!",4,2010,06,20
240,Good breakfast,"Parked in the hotel car park for ‚Ç¨10. When checking in was offered free internet access in my room. Bedroom was bright, clean, modern and relatively spacious. Ensuite was clean and modern. Good power from the shower. Water built up around you while you showered though. Couldn't work the stopper in the sink. OK choice of TV channels.  Was woken at 8am by the fire alarm - (when i asked at reception about it, it was attributed to some burning toast). Breakfast (the food) was extremely good - lots of choice and well laid out with little signs telling you what everything was. ""Real"" orange juice - a big plus for me. Was enjoying my second glass of it to finish off my breakfast when there was about a minute of loud knocking noises followed by the ceiling opening up and water absolutely GUSHING with force from the hole in the ceiling. Everyone got up and ran from the room, not knowing if the whole ceiling was about to collapse or if the water was boiling hot or not. (luckily I had finished my wonderful breakfast just in time! When I asked at reception about it when checking out 10 minutes later I was told that a pipe had burst and that ""it happens"". All, in all, it could have been worse I guess ,i could have been sitting directly under the torrent of water, it could have been scalding hot, or I might have had to leave the hotel hungry.",3,2010,06,11
240,Great Place,"The rooms are very clean, the staff is wonderful, location is very good and the neighborhood is great.  Lots of things to see and do very close. Get a Dublin Pass and you are good to go.  This costs a little less than staying down town.",5,2010,06,09
240,Fabulous hotel in quiet neighborhood of Dublin.,We visited Ireland in April and stayed at this hotel upon our arrival and one night at the end of our week-long stay. The staff was so incredibly helpful and kind. We were able to check in considerably early which was a relief after having been on airplanes for 12 hours prior. The neighborhood is quiet and on the outskirts of the city centre; however the hotel staff helped us to find easy bus and rail routes into the city centre. The hydrotherapy pools on the lower level of the hotel were a nice amenity. The rooms were plenty spacious and newly decorated. Bathroom was huge -  providing a separate shower and tub.,5,2010,06,05
240,no air conditioning,"and no cold water for shower only blazing hot..
We stayed here for a vacation before leaving for the airport , came to find out we had no cold water to temper the shower, so had to pack up our things and head 4 flights up via the stair well in our pjs to go to an empty room to take a shower, which also had no air conditioning or air circulation of any kind.
In our room no a/c, man came up to fix, couldn't, then brought us 2 circulating fans to set up.
ridiculous.  if it had been 0600 we got up to get ready to fly I would have been extremely p.o.'d.",3,2010,06,03
240,"A very welcoming, well run, and well located hotel","I recently stayed in this hotel for a weekend shopping break and was most impressed with it.     We had got a great deal which included dinner on one night.    We had no great expectations for dinner but felt it's paid for in any case!!   Wow, were we surprised.     We had a really lovely meal, very nice menu with a couple of surprises, all good.     The dining room was quiet and I felt it necessary to make the comment on dinner to spread the word - well worth staying in for dinner.    The reception area was very well organised and efficient and very friendly staff who were eager to please.    Our meeting with Brian who helped us with buses and things to do on day one and who drove us to the city centre on day two was one I won't forget in a long time.   To say that he helped make it a weekend to remember is an understatement so take a bow Brian.     He is worth his weight in gold, not many like him around the hotel scene anymore.    My only one complaint which we did make known at the desk was that the car park is a nightmare, not that it is difficult to park, rather that it is so easy to park in the residential area, and as we were told by the receptionist, liable to get clamped.   A better signage at the entrance would have made it clear that all guests went to the right.    It may have taken some of my good humour away had I returned to find out I had been clamped!!!!!   Still overall, a fab experience which I have recommended to all my friends.    I forgot to mention that breakfast was also fantastic.    We will return on our next outing to the city.   Well done all.",5,2010,05,30
240,Great outer-city location for Dublin -- Hilton never disappoints,"Room and all amenities were superb -- one of the best night's sleep we had was here!

Right near one of the top rated tourist attractions, the Jail (highly recommend also). Ten minute walk to tram station into Dublin. You can catch the hop-on-off buses right in front of the Hilton (at the jail), although they dont run late -- thats why we opted for the tram. 

Room had 'US-style' outlets for laptop.

Breakfast was very, very good -- staff was willing to go above and beyond what was offered at the buffet as well. Staff at the front desk was also very helpful and friendly.",5,2010,05,29
240,Great hotel,"Great hotel just outside of city center.  The staff was awesome.  They were very friendly and would go out of their way to make you feel welcome.  Getting to the hotel is a snap and luggage is no problem.  The HOHO bus picks up right in front of the hotel.  City bus goes into the city in 10 minutes.  See all of the advice for bus and air coach in other reviews, it is right on the money.

The jail is a must do.  It was great to hear about the Irish struggle for independence.  It is right across the street and you can use it for one of your down days.  The tour takes about an hour or so.  The hospital is also right next to the hotel and has a beautiful garden that you should take time to see.

Their is a pub across the street with good food.  The hotel restaurant was good.  Their is also some take away's (take out) just a couple of blocks away.  I found great fish and chips and the price was may 6 Euro.  Their was also a chinese place, but I can't recommend that one.  My wife didn't care for the food. 

We took a taxi back to the airport and the driver negotiated a 25 Euro price flat fee.  Taking the air coach is 7 each plus if you take a taxi to Heuston to pick up the bus it adds.  I found the taxi the best and most convenient.  Ask the driver's for a set rate to take you to the airport.",5,2010,05,19
240,Top-class hotel with a easy-going attitude,"Hilton Kilmainham was a very nice climax to our 8 days Irish Tour. The hotel is bright and spacious, and clean. The Bathroom had separate walk-in shower and a bathtub. The staff was very friendly and easy-going people. The Wi-Fi worked better than in any other hotel in Ireland we stayed. A special thanks to the bartender who organized some coffee and scones when we missed the breakfast the first morning. The second morning the breakfast was very good.",5,2010,05,14
240,Superb value for money,"If I recommended this hotel anymore than I am going to then I would be accused of being on the staff! Fantastic hotel,immaculatley clean with,large rooms with a huge bed and decent sized bathroom and TV.We arrived at 9.30 AM and though we didn't expect to be we were nevertheless allowed to check in straight away.The pool and spa area is excellent and the water in the pool is warm! 
Though we checked out at midday as we had to we didn't fly home until 10PM but we were allowed to leave our bags there all day which was great.
It is ideally located if you don't want to be right in the city centre and is only a 10-15 bus ride away (bus number 79A).It is opposite both Kilmainham Jail Museum and a fantastic pub called The Patriots Inn which also has an Italian restaurant and an off licence located on the premises.
The only thing we found to moan about was the breakfast which was expensive and not very warm!
I would highly recomment the HIlton and would definitely stay there again on any future trip to Dublin.",5,2010,05,13
240,nice relaxed atmosphere,"We have just returned from a 2 night stay here and couldnt  fault the place.  Rooms quite spacious , lovely fresh smell as you enter and spotless. the pool is more of a hydrotherapy pool- not really for swimming but very relaxing and really really warm. we loved it. Jacuzzi nice too. Food is nice but overpriced. The staff are all excellent. The guy behind reception couldnt do enough for us. the girl behind reception was extremely rude - no customer service skills and didnt want to be there which was disappointing as she was the only Irish member of staff we met! we were embarassed by this.Overall we were very pleased with our stay and would definitely recommend it for  a citybreak.",4,2010,05,10
240,Great Business Hotel,"Classic Hilton style hotel just outside the City Centre, beside the historic jail in Dublin.
Rooms neat and clean.

Free internet access, UK Hiltons take note!!

Staff top class, really helpful when the volcano disrupted the flights recently, nothing was to much hassle.

 Good gym and pool (although more for lounging about rather than swimming), Restaurant not bad but a little limited in choice. Breakfast as usual, great.

Ideal for business travellers who don't want to pay City Centre prices, 5 min walk to Luas

Stay on a regular basis with work,  but would be great for City break",4,2010,05,06
240,outstanding quality and value - a great experience,"We stayed here for a weekend as a family of 5 (2 adults & 3 kids) and the whole experience was fantastic. Firstly I'd echo what most people have said about the staff. Everyone that worked there was very friendly and couldn't do enough. The rooms were spotless, the food was excellent and the leisure facilities were great. The deal we got was tremendous value for money, we've spent much more on SuperValu breaks in hotels not half as good as this one. We were very sorry to have to leave and will definitely be returning here in the future. A gem.",5,2010,04,16
240,6 nights with two teenagers . . .,"This is a great hotel!  And, I want to thank my fellow Trip Advisor colleagues for their comments on this hotel as it was part of our decision to stay here.  We spent 6 nights in two rooms (adjoining) with our teenage children (18 & 15).  SO, you would think after 6 nights in two rooms you would find a complaint or two?  NONE.  What a truly great hotel.  The rooms were American sized with a separate shower stall AND a deep soaking tub.  One room for my wife and I had a true queen size bed which they classify as a Double room and two twin beds in the other room.  Each room had a flat screen TV with mostly BBC, Sky and other English channels, complimentary bottled waters which were generously replenished each night, complimentary in-room coffee with biscuits, sitting chair and air conditioning and heat.  Our breakfast was included which was European buffet ample, plentiful in a very nice setting.   And lastly, the location is great if you‚Äôre on holiday:  the #79 & #68 bus stop right in front of the hotel.  The LUAS Red line Suir Road station is a 7 minute walk; the buses into to City Centre are two blocks walk, very close.  AND there is the Patriots Pub right across the street if you want an authentic Irish Pub to down a few pints in and eat bangers & mash.  I‚Äôve traveled extensively in Europe and I must say this is one of the top 3 hotels I have stayed in.  The staff is great.  ENJOY!  Oh, and the SPA pictures do not do it justice.  Really cool and included in the rate.",5,2010,04,10
240,Perfect location for a trip to Dublin,"We had booked a room for three nights including breakfast. The room we got was at the fifth (of five) floor and had a large ceiling and a windows from the floor to the ceiling.

The bed was really comfortable with a warm blanket (something you need in Ireland in March). The bathroom was i good condition and spacious. The only thing that could have been solved better is the shower screen. There is no curtain, but a glass partition half the length of the tub that not really keeps the water from flooding the floor of the bathroom.

The staff at the hotel was really nice and the service was good. We asked for buses to the city center and got an exact description how to get to the next bus stop and which line to catch.

We had dinner in the bar twice - it's no bargain, but the food is good quality. Try the burger with brie cheese!

The breakfast is a buffet, where you can choose between full Irish or continental breakfast.

All in all the stay was really nice, unfortunately at the last night some local girl had a party for her 21st birthday in one of the function rooms - this wouldn't have bothered us, but she and all of her friends seemed to have their rooms at the same floor we did. They really made quite a racket in the hallway for the best part of the night.

If you go to Dublin, the Hilton Kilmainham is a good alternative to hotels at the city center. You get to the center by bus in ten minutes - if you choose to walk it's 30 minutes. Be aware, that the hotel charges you 10,- EUR for using the underground parking garage per night.",4,2010,04,01
240,The Best,"The best staff ever,it was the best hotel I have ever been to, the receptionist are more than friendly, guest orientated, helpful... amazing",5,2010,03,06
240,Best Hotel!!!!,"Me and my fiance stayed in this hotel from friday 26th feb 2010 till monday 1st march 2010, everything was amazing from the staff to the pool. check in was smooth and easy and they even let us check in early at 9am! (when normal  check in is not untill 3pm) the rooms are massive with a large bathroom with a shower over bath the rooms are very modern with large windows, we loved the hotel so much we have booked to go back in Decemeber. The only thing that was a little annoying was the staff in the bar did not speak very good english and were rather slow at taking orders for food. We loved Dublin!! My boyfriend is Irish and it was the first time he had been back in 12 years now with this hotel just round the coner i think we will be back a lot more!!!",5,2010,03,06
240,Hilton Kilmainham,"Very nice hotel, nice restaurant/bar and front desk staff! Wish I could have utilized the pool. Got a very good hotel at a very good price.",5,2010,02,26
240,SUPERB STAY ! AMAZING STAFF !,"I have traveled most of the world and this staff just blew me away. The front desk employees went way beyond their normal job description to assist me in my stay. The location is little bit away from city center. Local transportation is is about 7 min walk. The hop on hop off bus stops right in front. Best value from airport is to buy a freedom pass - 25 euors -- they include free transfer to the city from airport - and hop on hop off bus... taxi is about 25 plus euros one way.

Hotel is clean and nice. The first room outside the double doors is noisy as you will hear everyone. Also avoid rooms that face the major street - you will hear loading trucks at night right in front.

Overall - definately stay there again !",4,2010,02,26
240,Very friendly Staff with warm Welcome,"We stayed at the Hilton for a weekend recently and i must say we got the friendliest, warmest welcome ever.

We went out to eat in Dublin Friday night and the hotel ordered a taxi for us, they apparently have a taxi driver ready and waiting for guests. He was again very friendly and helpful. 

The room's airconditioning did not work on the first night and the room became too hot, We contacted Lukas in reception who immediately sent a maintenance man up who could not fix the problem, so Lukas quickly and efficiently moved us to another room.

I cannot say enough for the genuine hospitality of the staff,

My only complaint would be that we ate in the hotel bar on the Saturday night and the bar staff were a little slow with service. the food was ok, but after a long wait it gets frustrating.",5,2010,02,03
240,Amazing romantic weekend!,"We just spent the most marvellous weekend at the Hilton, Kilmainham & I can honestly say I had no complaints at all...   The hotel was clean, the staff were friendly & helpful, the pool was amazing and the food was beautiful.... I did not want to leave....
We went away for a weekend break without the kids to relax and this hotel was perfect for this. It is a good walk into the city centre but after a good walk we came back and got into the hydrotherapy pool & the hot tub & it was heaven.
Oh, and if anyone left the restaurant after breakfast saying they didn't have enough to eat they would be lying........ everything you could possibly want... and if there was something you wanted that wasn't on the buffet you just ask for it & it's brought to you asap...
I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants somewhere to relax and chill out.",5,2010,01,31
240,Great hotel,"Lovely hotel. Rooms were very spacious, clean and quiet. Staff were helpful and room service very prompt.
However be careful when booking over the phone - when I initially enquired I was given one quote and was told there was plenty of availability. However when I phoned back within the hour to book it, they tried to sell the room at a much higher price until i mentioned the previous quote which they gave me.",4,2010,01,31
240,OH MY GOD,"This Hotel is a big bit outside Dublin but Oh my God, worth every penny, I went with my boyfriend and we enjoyed every minute, the bus tickets, we got from reception, we travelled round Dublin with these tickets, the Hotel was pure Heaven, very, very clean, room service excellent, TV and music Channels all there, I ordered room service the very last morning before leaving and I could have fed 20 people with it.  The swimming pool and Sauna was brillant, the reception help was brilliant, the space was good too,",5,2009,12,27
240,Big Birthday Weekend went down at storm here,"Ok, so I really love this hotel, but not because of the building or features of the room etc, which sadly have dropped a bit since a new management company took control :(  I love it because of the amazing and generous staff at this place.

In particular, the staff who have been most helpful on most of my stays here have been Rudolph, Danielle and Peter.

During this stay myself and some friends we're celebrating a 30th birthday party here, we pretty much took over a large section of the 5th floor.  The staff really went out of their way to make it a great weekend.

I consider this place to be a hidden gem in Dublin, and I've been to the city many, many times.

It may be a bit out of town, but do you know something, that's just another bonus for anyone who gets fed up with your inner city hotels.

When next in Dublin, give it a try and see what you think.  I love it!",5,2009,12,18
240,Excellent Service,"Everything you expect from a 4* or 5* Hotel. The staff are attentive, friendly and willing to help, the rooms are modern, the lounge area is comfortable, the gym and pool have good facilities, you are able to get internet access in your room, breakfast has a great selection, the menu is good (although could do with updating for the regular stayers!). The location is not that central to the city centre but there are bus options. I'll be back.",5,2009,11,20
240,"Ok, but watch extra charge for parking!","Nice property, friendly staff, clean and comfy.
Downpoints; they charge for parking which is MAD! I refused to pay, sorry but if I'm bringing them my custom, parking in my eyes is free.
The room we had had NO WINDOW TO OPEN, so it was stuffy - but apart from that, it was nice.
The restaurant menu was totally underwhelming.....we went out for dinner.
The breakfast was a let down, my fried breakfast was cold......shame.",3,2009,10,28
240,"Great Hotel, but not in city center","We stayed at the Hilton Kilmainham for 4 nights in the beginning of our honeymoon in Ireland.  We got a deluxe room on the top floor (there are only 5 floors).  We used  Hilton points for 3 nights and then paid 105 euro for the 4th.  The facilities were nice- the best things being- there are computers in the business center you can use to get on the internet and there's a resturant/bar with pretty decent food.  Our room was nice.  It had a king size bed and  a balcony that somewhat overlooked the Kilmainham Jail (a must see).  It's just outside of town, but the 'Hop on, Hop off' busses stop right in front of the jail, but that only runs until 7 pm or so- after that you have to take the city bus or get a cab (about 10 euro from city center).  I learned later that instead of taking a cab from the airport to the hotel (50 euro) we could have taken the Dublin Bus AirLink (6 euro per person) that has many stops around the city (not sure where the closest one to hotel is).  I would recommend getting the 'Hop on, Hop off' bus pass (1-day or 3-day) if you stay here.  I think it was 25 euro per person for the 3-day and totally worth it.  Most have the live commentary and it's a double decker topless bus- so if the weather's nice you can get some fresh air.  All in all, a pretty good spot to stay, but I'd probably stay a little closer to the action next time.",4,2009,10,16
240,Great hotel with kind personable staff,"We stayed at the Hilton Kilmainham for free for one night using my husband's American Express points.  I had booked the hotel about 3 months prior our departure and at the time of the online booking was unable to indicate that we would be having 2 small boys aged 21 months & 3 1/2 years staying with myself and husband.   I was not only nervous about what how the staff would deal with this but also how the the free night would actually work.  I had emailed the staff separately but got no reply and also meant to phone 24 hours prior our departure but had run out of time.  Upon conveying the fact that we had 2 small children, the front desk staff stated they had known of the request and would bring up a crib immediately and also kindly asked if we needed an additional crib or anything else.  We replied no and were promptly given our room key.  The entire process went so smooth I could not believe it.  

Upon entering our room, we discovered it overlooked the street and jail with a big window and was super quiet.  The room was surprisingly good sized.  About 10 minutes after entering our room the crib was brought up as requested as well as extra towels and linens without asking. The hotel staff member had an obvious language barrier but was so very sweet.  

The breakfast the following day was buffet style in the hotel restaurant and we were able to take the food up to our room to eat it.  The food was good and we were not disappointed however we had low expectations to begin with for breakfast food in Dublin.  

Overall the hotel was wonderful & we'd gladly pay to stay there again.",5,2009,10,12
240,Everybody unhappy!,"We stay in this hotel as part of a group tour. During our trip we stayed in 7 hotels in England, Ireland, Scotland and Walles. Really nice tour just in Hilton Kilmainham we did not have good experience. All members of our group had problems here. The hotel looks like a nice place and they have good facilities (swimmingpool, gym, bar, restaurant) but most of them are out of order. 
Air conditioning, minibar,lights in the room not working for example. 
Then kids can not use swimmingpool, breakfast is really poor, no porters and people not really helpful. 
We have seen a tripadvisor award and we would like to suggest a review regarding this award.",2,2009,10,11
240,What kind of managers in Hilton?,"I was in Dublin for business and as usual I booked at Hilton. I won't do it anymore in Kilmainham. This is the wost hotel I have ever never seen... Check in was ok but I did not feel really welcome and it looked like ""please no questions and go away"" Not a smile from anyone here. Where is gone the warm Irish welcoming style? The room was tidy but warm and a bit stinky, Minibar was locked (no service). Room service nobody. Receptionist told me where was the bar if I need to drink something.  Air conditioning was not working. I contacted Reception several times and after more than half hour a manager came to my room but he couldn't fix it.  He showed me an other room where air conditioning was even not working and he couldn't offer me any other solution. So poor!!! After that I decided to go to the city centre for diner. When I went back around midnight I met nobody there. Bar closed, front desk desert and...what's security? I went to sleep in my ""warm"" room. I did not sleep well and I woke up more tired and disappointed than when I went to sleep. Breakfast? I have seen just one waitress and poor girl she was running up and down in everywhere but it was not enough. I did not want bother her more. Better to go. At check out I explained to the receptionist few issues I had during my short stay but the guy in front of me was look like ""it is like that what can I do?"". He introduced me to the Hotel Manager but the hotel manager walked away... Nice guest relation teacher...
Thanks God my stay was just for one night",1,2009,09,25
240,get a good on line rate,"I stayed here in Sept-09 and got a lovely room for two nights for 112 eur per night, which I regarded as good value for a weekend in Dublin.  This rate did not include breakfast which didn't matter as we ate in the city centre.  Its very close to a main rail line station and to a light rail stop so it is very convenient.  The swimming pool is excellent and the free wi-fi worked without difficulty.

Lastly, my wife left her mobile phone in the room after we checked out and the staff could not have been nicer or more helpful in making sure she was reunited with it.  There are more expensive rates but for the price I was able to get, I would definately stay here again. Parking is 12 euro per day and it is in a safe part of the city.",4,2009,09,16
240,not worth the price,"we stayed at this hotel in sept 09, we were very surprised to see it was like any 3 star hotel we have stayed in before, with the price we were expecting something a bit more luxurious.at a price of 180 this didnt even include breakfast. the bar staff were very slow as was the food which we ordered at the bar. when ordering room service at night expect to wait at least 45 mins , a pizza which cost 18 euro and we got 2 slices each. it was enough to feed one person. maintanance man walking into our room at 9 in the morning when you are asleep in bed, overall review save your money , or dont expeact anything nicer then jurys inn.",3,2009,09,15
240,BEST HOTEL EVER STAYED IN!!!,"Before i write anything please do not be put off by the few that have wrote negative comments here.. I have stayed in many hotels and being honest this has got to be the best hotel i have ever stayed in, rooms were fully equipped with everything you need and more.. Room was very spacious and extremley  clean. Breakfast has to be sampled to be believed!! Lots of different pastries, breads, fruit, yoghurt, plus full fry up.. Also if you want something specific as my partner did (an omlette!) this can be made from scratch in the kitchen at no extra cost.. I can honestly not rate this hotel highly enough. The only disappointing thing was i forgot my swim suit so we could not use the leisure facilities but i had a peak and they looked top notch!!",5,2009,08,28
240,"Luxurious, fantastic hydrotherapy pool, no complaints","We were there for a Fri/Sat night and it was a great weekend. The service was attentive and helpful; the room was smart and well equipped.

The restaurant was pricey; the included breakfast was fantastic.

It's not a central location, but the Museum of Modern Art is next door - we wished we'd planned to spend more time there; but can recommend it's coffee shop. There's also a fantastic Italian restaurant just 10 mins walk away.",5,2009,08,20
240,Fantastic luxurious hotel in perfect location.,What a lovely surprise this hotel was with lovely big rooms and everything you needed.  We were so disappointed to only stay one night.  The person on reception was very welcoming and interested in us and very helpful with where to go in Dublin.  Breakfast was very good with lots of choice.  The hotel is in a nice quiet area but on the bus route for the city tours and near to a tram station too.  A really enjoyable stay with lots of comforts in room. Only disappointing part was that we had only booked one night!!!,5,2009,08,19
240,Lost it's edge,"This Hilton used to be exceptional. It used to be a bit of a hidden gem, offering great service and a comfortable stay at reasonable prices if you didn't mind the journey.

Not any more.

I booked two rooms in July 2009 for a 2 night stay. I had high hopes given the reputation of the hotel. But all was not good. When we arrived in our rooms, we found the air conditioning was not working. Because this was a hotel-wide problem, there wasn't much which could be done. The hotel sent someone up to my room with a desk fan so small it wouldn't keep a fly cool. My guest in the second room received nothing.

The following morning, I re-reported the problem and was told it would be fixed. We returned in the evening to find this wasn't the case. After calling the front desk countless times and visiting it in person, we were finally told we would be moved. I was moved to another room. My guest wasn't and was left to bake. We chased the staff time and again but they brushed us off and simply couldn't care less. An hour was wasted trying to sort this out.

When we returned, there were yet more problems. This time, room service were hardly answering calls. I called and the phone rang and rang and rang before it got an answer. In the baking room, my guest (who needed room service more than I, due to the heat and not feeling well) called room service and there was no answer.

So poor quality rooms and abysmal service. What would you do next? Write and complain. So I did, and the complaint was not even responded to. I then got the Hilton Guest Services dept in the US to chase, which they did, but the Hilton Kilmainham ignored them too. I wrote a final letter directly to the hotel but have yet to receive a reply. 

The management at that hotel are extremely discourteous and disingenuous. Standards have been slipping at that hotel for a while - both myself and another regular guest have spotted it. Personally I'm phasing out future stays at that hotel and will be looking elsewhere. 

A disappointing stay made worse by staff and management who couldn't care less.",2,2009,08,10
240,u2 concert stay at Hilton,"I booked this Hotel based on trip advisor reviews and because it was the best value for money I could get as U2 were playing in Dublin. They doubled their prices that week end obviously, but it was stll cheaper than all the other Hotels because of its location.For me id rather pay less and sacrifice location, but thats just it.... the location wasnt a sacrifice, as it happened, it was perfect.for us coming from Galway  west of ireland, the Hotel is just off the motorway, so you dont have to drive into the city, you just park your car in the underground car park and get the lift up to the reception, soooh easy!!! The luas tram which is a fast 5 min walk from the hotel takes you right into Henry street or connolly st in 10 mins and although it doesnt run all night its not a problem if you are not satying out late, and im sure a taxi wouldnt cost much.
I found the staff friendly and helpful, I liked the nice Modern interior  and especailly the bar, its chic and sophisticated and having a drink here feels like you are treating yourself.. The Hotel put  on a late bar till 2am for for the U2 concert goers and they had coctails for E10 and a Dj playing all u2 hits. We really appreciated this as it was perfect just after the concert.
We stayed in the Delux superior, which has a balcony, only downside is, its a communal balcony shared with the 5 or so other rooms on that level, and there were only 6 chairs on the balcony. It would be sooh much nicer if they partitioned each balcony off so you had privacy . its also facing a busy road so the bacony is noisy ,and rooms on one  side of the balocny have a view of the Dublin mountains, while the other side only get a view  of Kilmainham gaol.
I was really looking forward to breakfast as the usual hotel fare is the full irish but id read on a review here that you can get pancakes or smoked salmon. We messed up though as you have to order this as its not in the buffet.
The other thing was the aircon in our room never worked even though we got it fixed supposedly, and neither did the fridge in the minibar, all the drinks were warm. I had a warm bottle of heineken and the guy still wanted to charge me for it on checkout, I refused to pay for it and I think he should have comped us the Parking fee which was steep at  20 euruo for less than 24 hours. Overall though the staff did a great job on what was obviously a busy week end for them and as we only stayed one night, broken aircon and warm  beer werent too much of a bug to  bear.",4,2009,08,04
240,Fab Hotel & Wheelchair Accessible,"A great hotel, evreything was top class - staff are extremely professional. This hotel is ideal for wheelchair users, bedrooms, restaurant & bar very wheelchair friendly",5,2009,07,27
240,Location is only problem,"This is a pretty good Hilton property and if you can deal with the location, it's actually a really good hotel for Dublin.   Rooms and public spaces are all new and quite nice, has a great gym, internet was included at no extra charge (you have to ask for wireless vouchers) and the food in the restaurant was actually really good - MUCH better than I expected. 
But make sure you understand the location relative to your needs in Dublin because this place is NOT walkable to city centre and the walk to the LUAS (street car) is a solid 10 mins AND the area you walk thru, although 'ok' in day/early evening is clearly not great so you'll be taking a lot of cabs.",4,2009,07,27
240,Very Classy Hotel!,I stayed here on a business trip and found the staff to be an absolute pleasure to deal with! The food was amazing and the hotel itself is spotless and beautifully decorated. The room had everything I needed.,5,2009,07,27
240,Great rooms with helpful staff,"Stayed with a sports team and will definitely go back as an individual.  Large clean room, quiet and peaceful.  AC didn't work, even after the medchanic tried to fix, but the weather was kind to me anyway.  Breakfast buffet was top notch and hotel accommodated an outrageous schedule for 30 of us.  Although rooms weren't ready when we tried to check in at 10:00 am, we were provided with a late breakfast and a place to store our luggage until 1:00 PM when we checked in early.   Also, we were allowed to store luggage (and plastic laundry bags) while we hopped on a Ryan Air flight to Belgium with a 15 kilo weight limit for a five day stay.  Rooms were ready when we returned.  Unfortunately, the room was not serviced at all one of the days of my stay so I had to beg the front desk for shampoo and clean towels.  Instead of having the room cleaned, they just delivered the requested items.  Front desk was helpful in giving directions to the bus, calling a taxi, etc.  The hop-on tour stops across the street and the bus is a quick ride to town.  Location might not be ideal to 1st time Dublin visitors if you want to stay in the heart of the ""action"" but great for everything else.  Museum of Modern Art is across the street from the hotel at a wonderful historic site.  Be sure to check both out.  The WiFi service was FREE which was terrific.  Meals in the bar were deeply discounted for our group so the price was tolerable.  Not many places to eat near by but hotel was great about having us order in pizza and eat it in their lobby.  They graciously provided napkins, etc. and the bar made sure we had beer and sodas to go with.",5,2009,06,27
240,We loved the room,"We stayed for two nights, Saturday and Sunday. The bedroom was on the top floor and huge! The bathroomw as spotless and also very big. Although the TV remote control was not present, we informed reception and one was delivered almost immediately. Breakfast was excellent and the staff were very friendly. We ate in the hotel bar and found the food there to be of excellent quality as well. Location wise, the hotel is not far from a bus stop - the journey to the centre took 10-15 minutes depending on traffic and cost ‚Ç¨1.60. The tram stop was also not far. Kilmainham Gaol and the Museum of Modern Art are very close by, and there is a good pub/restaurant on the corner of the street opposite the hotel. We would not hesitate to recommend this modern hotel or to return there, as it has the comfiest bed we have ever slept in!",5,2009,06,19
240,A Real Gem,"This is a smart well run hotel that impressed me at every turn. I found the staff to be very courteous and friendly and my room was clean and well presented - but a tiny bit small.

The evening restaurant is excellent but I quickly worked out that you can get almost the same food, much cheaper in the hotel bar (which was also quite nice).

The hotel itself is very quiet, so for me, it was perfect for business travel.",5,2009,06,17
240,Highly Recommended,I've stayed at this hotel several times recently and my wife and I are very impressed with it. This is a top class hotel. New and modern with great rooms and great service. All staff are very friendly and very professional. Ok its a bit out of the city centre but only 5 minutes walk to the luas tram public transport. It's also very quiet. The food in the restaurant is good. The rooms and bathrooms are spotless. All in all a pleasure to stay here and highly recommended.,5,2009,05,08
240,"Fabulous, will definitely stay again.","We live in Dublin but wanted a night away somewhere swanky and got a double room for only ‚Ç¨59. The staff were friendly and so helpful. The room was fantastic, lovely views and a great bathroom, very high ceiling. It's one of the best hotels I've stayed in in a long time. The bar is modern and not over priced. We ate at an Italian restaurant across the road which was cheap and cheerful. It's a hany location for tourists as there is the tram near by which only takes 10 minutes into town and there's also a bus service or else a taxi. The pool is fantastic.",5,2009,04,23
240,"Modern Hotel, Needs Character","This is a newer Hilton Hotel, and more in the style/substance of Holiday Inn than of a medium upscale Hilton Hotel.  It is located a distance from the main tourist areas, but across the street from the prison museum.  A somewhat strange aspect is that the only drop off point is at the street and luggage must be either carried up some steps or taken to a ramp at the side of the hotel.

The rooms seem spacious and well equipped.  The room is anchored by a large flat panel TV and a large, comfortable bed.  The desk is small and not very workable, and the chair of a dining chair style rather than an office chair style.  Wired interenet is available at a high cost.

The restaurant provided a good breakfast buffet, and a limited menu for dinner.  Food seemed very acceptable.

Service was fine, but you should be prepared to handle your luggage without assistance.",3,2009,04,10
240,"relaxed, peaceful weekend",Have just returned home having spent a very relaxing weekend in this hotel.  The service was excellent and hotel was clean and modern.  Breakfast was plentiful with many hot and cold options including pancakes to order which were lovely.  Yes this hotel is not in the centre of dublin but also doesn't claim to be either.  It is within walking distance of Phoenix park which is lovely.,5,2009,04,05
240,Polite Service and Clean hotel,"Arrived early morning from the US and the front desk worked to have a room available within the hour (by 11am).  Room was clean and quiet.  I had an issue with A/C but a call to the front desk resulted in maintenance at the room within 5 minutes and the issue quickly resolved.  Typical breakfast buffet with both hot and cold items.  Location is across the street from Hop On - Hop Off bus stop, within 10 minute walk of LUAS light rail, and within 5 minutes of SPAR convenience store.  Hotel is not in the heart of the tourist center so don't stay here if that will make your stay a disappointment.",5,2009,04,04
240,would recommend,"Just come back form a lovely weekend in Dublin. Couldn't fault this Hotel, from the minute we walked in to leaving we felt that the service we recieved was excellent.
The beds were very comfortable and large with lovely bedding. The drinks in the bar were actually cheaper than in some of the pubs locally so very good value for money. I would definatley recommend a trip to the gaol opposite it was only 6 euros and well worth it.",5,2009,03,24
240,A good hotel,"I have just come back from staying at the Hilton Kilmainham Hotel (7-9 March) with my boyfriend on a 2 night short break and I must say that I was not disappointed at all. The hotel was very clean, staff courteous and the breakfast was good. The only thing I would pick on was the location of it and that will only bother you if you wanted to be closer to town and Temple Bar. The location of the hotel is about a 10 min bus ride from town and is also directly opposite the Kilmainham Gaol, which is one of Dublin‚Äôs biggest attractions and is a must see, plus it's only 6 euros entrance fee. Buses 78, 78A, 79 & 79A take you from the hotel straight into town so there was no real need to get a cab unless it‚Äôs after 11.30pm. I also recommend Dublin‚Äôs hop on & off bus tour as a way of getting around the main attractions, 25 euros for a 3 day pass and this includes return transfers from the airport and admission on all of Dublin's public buses in that the 3 day period.
I can most certainly recommend staying at the Hilton Kilmainham, as it is a comfortable, quiet and classy hotel.",4,2009,03,11
240,Great Hotel,Stayed at this Hotel for two nights back in June.  Couldnt fault the Hotel at all. The rooms were lovely and spacious with everything you need.  The food at the Hotel was also of a very good standard.  The Hotel is in a good location and wasnt too far to get into Dublin Town Centre and all the main attractions.   Would definitely recommended this Hotel.   You wont be disappointed.,5,2009,02,26
240,Fab Hotel!!,"I am actually still in this hotel as I write this review. I normally wait til I get home but I felt so strongly, I had to write my review this morning. 
I arrived at about 12 noon yesterday even though check in is at 3pm in the hope that our room might be ready. Thankfully it was. 
We booked a double room on our Super Valu break. Price was ‚Ç¨109 for each of us for three night midweek stay (you can stay for 2 nights at the weekend for the same price). 
We did ring in advance to upgrade to to a deluxe room for an extra ‚Ç¨30 for three nights so before I review the hotel, the price we paid was as follows: ‚Ç¨109 each plus the ‚Ç¨30 for the upgrade to deluxe room each night which came to ‚Ç¨308. 

Anyway, check in was a bit long considering there were 2 girls at the desk & only 4 people booking in. Apart from that, it was fine, foyer, reception, bar, restaurant & lift area all looked very well, modern, clean, inviting. 
We got up to our room on the 5th floor & were very pleased when we got into our room. Large king deluxe room, large bathroom, seating area, consealed cloakroom area. Balcony area is also gorgeous with great views over the city & the ""Gaol"" Kilmainham prison across the road. 

After we looked around our room, we relaxed, freshened up & got ready to go down to the restaurant for our free meal at 8.30pm. (The free meal is incorporated in our stay along with free buffet breakfast each of the 3 mornings). 
We got down to the restaurant & were greeted with very friendly professional staff who showed us to a large circular table with 2 chairs & a soft furnishing purple sofa which was lovely & comfortable. 
The food was absolutely fabulous & could not fault any of it or the service. The staff were perfect at all times. 
I had duck liver pate with port dressing for starter. My partner had Clonakilty black pussing with salad, half sliced pan fried baby potatoes & honey & mustard dressing. 
For main, I had pan fried sea trout with herb potato & cream white wine sauce.  My partner had pork belly with apple jus,cabbage & half a baked apple. 
For dessert, we both had the trio of dessert special. It had strawberry chessecake, chocholate brownie & apple crumble in a small cup which was piping hot! Gorgeous. 
I had a glass of wine first & then decided to order another bottle which was gorgeous. 
We left the restaurant about 10.50 feelin really happy & relaxed. The time flew as we went in there at 8.30!! We only paid for the wine as the meal was included in our stay as I mentioned above. 

We had a great night's sleep last night. Did not really hear much traffic even with the balcony door open all night as I love the fresh air coming in all the time. I thought the door had closed by itself during the night. 
The quilt & pillows are the softest & nicest ones I have ever slept on! Just excellent!!

Went down for breakfast about 9.40 this morning & it was lovely, huge selection of hot food, juices, cereal, fruit & teas/coffees. Could not fault any of this either.

Really looking forward to the rest of my stay, will no doubt update again when I check out on Friday!",4,2009,02,25
240,expected more from the Hilton -,"I stayed at the Hilton on two separate nights as I signed up for a Railtour and needed a place to stay before and after the tour.   

The Railtour starts and ends at the Hueston Station so this was a good location for me.  However, it is quite a bit outside of the city centre so if you want to stay close to the sites, I do not recommend it. 

The room itself was fine.  Clean with modern finishings.  I did have a problem with the drain in the bath tub.  Don't know why the water was not draining properly.  At one point, I had to stop showering so that the water levels could go down.  

The staff service was not overtly friendly.  My check in was fine the first night but not sure why there was no automatic check out.  I have stayed at other hotels and you could check out by selecting the hotel menu on the tv.

After my tour when I checked in, the front desk wanted to charge me 105 Euros for the room.  I told them that I booked the room for 54 pounds.  With the current exchange rate, 54 pounds does not equal 105 Euros.  However, I didn't have my e-mail confirmation (bad me!) which then turned into a 15 minute discussion about how they can't honor the 54 pounds since there is no proof.  I told the  front desk that I would provide the confirmation once I returned to work but then the person I dealt with could not let it drop.  She tried to make it sound like she was only doing her job and was soooo sorry for the inconvenience but she could not do anything.  Which sounded really insincere to me.    This was 11pm and at this point, all I wanted to do was go to bed not listen to excuses. 

I had dinner at the hotel restaurant - think it was called Cinnimon Bar.   Serivce was attentive - there was only 2 other tables - but the food was just okay - given the inflated cost.

The hotel booklet says there is a business centre but that is incorrect.  As well, the bookelt says there are spa services.  The psa services were the sauna and pool.  Not the massage / manicure/pedicures that in my opinion are true spa services.

Would I be back again:  no.  It is out of the way from the city and the hotel staff could use a few lessons on customer service.",2,2009,02,04
240,"Great service, good hotel","We choose the hotel as there was a special deal going through the hilton.com website so we thought we'd give it a go, despite its location not being as central as we would normally go for.

Locationwise, its not actually that bad. The taxi price is only marginally more than to the city centre from the airport. As a tourist it might even be a preferable location as one of Dublin's main attractions the Kilmainham Gaol is opposite the hotel main entrance and the hop on hop off bus can be caught there!! 
Also, Dublin Heuston station where trains to Cork/ Limerick Galway go from is less than a mile away so walkable or only a cheap taxi journey away. 
 
Servicewise I can't fault them. Reception and bar/ restaurant staff couldn't do enough for us. Other reviews mention non irish staff being an issue, and I've had problems myself at other hotels with foreign customer service staff barely able to speak english (mainly a few years ago during the celtic tiger economic boom when anything went and you were charged a fortune for it!) but here theres no such problems. 
Little things like adjusting the minibar bill (we moved a can of beer which was registered automatically) were also no trouble. 

The room too was very nice and spacious and the bed super comfortable. Its a pity we couldnt have enjoyed the room more as we were out and about so much, but I do intend to come back and make full use of it again soon. 

So all in all, we had a pleasant relaxing uncomplicated stay and we will be back again.",5,2009,02,02
240,Great Stay,Stayed here for two nights on a supervalu break. Cost e219 for b&b and 1 evening meal. have to say everything was really nice and very clean. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Room was bright with lovely comfy bed. Fab shower & toiletries. Only two bath/hand towels in bathroom but you could ask for more. Had brekkie delivered to room on 2nd morning and it was spot on. Parking cost e10 for 24hrs which I thought was good value compared to some other places we have stayed. Evening meal was very nice was so stuffed we could not eat dessert. Only fault I can give is it costs e20 per 24hrs of broadband in your room. Crazzzzzzzzzzzy. Was chatting to the manager on checkout and she said they are in the process of trying to get out of this contract which they hope to soon. Location is great and very quiet. Would we go back again...........yes. Will be in Dublin again in Feb and if the price is right I will stay here again. Get rid of the cost of broadband guys and you have a great hotel.,4,2009,01,30
240,Very nice & newer Hilton property in Dublin,"Spent 2 nights in Jan '09. Got an excellent low-season deal via Orbitz.

The property is impeccable, the only problem I found was that one elevator (out of 2) was defective during part of my stay. Not a big concern.

My early check-in was easily accommodated. Very friendly and helpful staff. 

Breakfast was very good, no complaints there. 

Rooms were very clean and quiet. They had a North-American-style electric outlet to plug in my laptop. Not sure if it was 110 or 220V - but not important for most laptop power supplies. 

The distance to Temple bar is walkable, took me about 45 minutes, may be 60 minutes for a leisurely stroll. Cab to Temple Bar is under 10Euro. Underground parking was 10Euro and plentiful.

I would certainly stay there again. 

I've been surprised by the handful of bad reviews. I think people may get disappointed at one thing or another, and write-off the hotel completely. Perhaps they need to be more objective...",5,2009,01,26
240,Kilmainham Hilton Dublin gets better with time,"This was my second stay at the Kilmainham Hilton and it was better than the first.  Our first stay wasn't bad, but the hotel was new (only open a few months) at the time and they were still working out some bugs (like the fire alarms going off, elevators not working, etc.).  I am glad to say that this stay was flawless and I didn't see one problem the entire time we were there.  
 
We arrived on a early morning flight from the US and were at the hotel at 700 (over 5 hours before normal check-in).  The desk staff was great and let us check in then and take a nap for a few hours.  The rooms are very clean and the decor is modern but tasteful.  We had dinner one of the nights, and it was superb.  Breakfast was a different story- the food was OK but everything seemed rushed and service needed some attention.  Overall we were were satisfied with the food and beverage service.  

The thing that makes this hotel great is the staff- they were all extremely helpful and had good tips for transportation and touring the city.  

Kilmainham Jail is just a short walk away- it is a ""can't miss"" in Irish and Dublin history.  The Dublin tourbus stop is in front of the Jail and the 15.50 euro ticket is good all day- you can hop on and off at any of the 23 stops around the city and cover a lot of ground for a fraction of cabfare.",5,2009,01,24
240,Breakfast worth the stay!,"Hilton Kilmainham was an excellent choice for the two night break. We booked through their own website and got a Delux room for ¬£10 more than a regular room on lastminute.com. Modern hotel, huge room with a balcony and tasty buffet breakfast (including smoked salmon and brie).",5,2009,01,20
240,Service issues-nice hotel,"What a pity! A new hotel, very nicely furnished and very comfortable rooms. Booked through website, but when arrived, no booking to be found. Fair play, the receptionist accepted booking info (thankfully I brought a copy with me) and made the reservation, apologised for delay and got me checked in. Decided to go to the bar for a snack. Took a seat and waited. And waited. And waited. And waited. One server behind the bar and two serving tables. It didn't seem terribly busy and I don't mind waiting, but the being ignored is just not acceptable. Backwards and forwards they went, time after time they elected to ignore me. Eventually one of the servers acknowledged that I existed and to be fair, the service when it did arrive was friendly. But all a bit too late. the soup when it arrived was tasty but cold. Nobody bothered to come check on me. When I got back to my room I tried to use the safe. An error message came up in the panel. I phoned down to reception and a gentleman said he'd send somebody right up. Guess what? Yep! Nobody showed, I travel alot and have stayed in many hotels. It's such a pity that so many of these new hotels fail to provide even a basis degree of good or attentive service, The Hilton Kilmainham is a nice hotel - hopefully someday they will match this with getting the basics right.",2,2009,01,17
240,Fantastic Break - Loved it - Like to return one day!,"We chose this Hilton in Dublin as a last minute getaway for a New Year break with our three adult children and we certainly were not disappointed.

Staff are all very helpful and friendly, the hotel is clean, bright and modern with spacious, comfortable rooms.  The restaurant is excellent.

If you are lucky, you may even get a good deal on the price!   If you don't mind a long stroll into the city or catching public transport then the location is fine.  If you want to be in the heart of the city then this Hotel is not for you.  It is just opposite the old Kilmainham jail - a very interesting, must see tourist attraction -even if you are not that interested in history.  The guide is excellent.  Also, the guinness factory - no trip to Dublin would be complete without this treat and your free pint in the 360 degree bar on the top floor.

Hope to go back again soon.  Go on, just do it, book it!",5,2009,01,07
240,Peace & comfort on the outskirts of Dublin,"I debated quite a bit whether to stay at the Hilton Dublin Kilmainham or at another hotel closer to the city center. In the end I did both, and was so pleased with my stay at the Hilton Dublin Kilmainham that I returned to it for a couple of nights at the end of my vacation in Ireland.

The hotel is located directly across the street from the Kilmainham Jail in the western part of Dublin, and is approximately 4-5 kilometers from the Dublin city center (O'Connell Street and Liffey River area). The Irish Museum of Modern Art is across the street, Memorial Park is nearby, and Heuston train station is a little over 1 kilometer away.

Public transport into the city center is easy and inexpensive. The 'Luas Rail' (or light rail tram) stop is about 4-5 city blocks away, and the city bus into the city center bus stop is a little over 1 block away (it travels down Old Kilmainham Road). In addition, the 'Dublin City Tour' buses stop in front of the hotel at the Kilmainham Jail.

The hotel and surrounding complex are relatively new (all built within the past couple of years), so it has that look of a 'modern' Hilton hotel (large rooms & bathrooms, earth tones, contemporary furniture, comfortable linens, etc.) and is very clean. It is not a very large hotel (maybe 150 rooms), and I found the front desk, bar, and restaurant staff all top notch and very helpful and friendly.

The morning breakfast was very good (typical hot/cold Irish breakfast) as well as the restaurant for dinner. There is a local pub and Italian restaurant across the street (I myself did not try them, but understand they are good). And there are also a couple of other restaurants that are a 10-15 minute walk from the hotel (they're located on Grattan Crescent). I don't remember the name, but the Italian restaurant was very good.

The hotel has a gym that is used by local residents. There are treadmills, stairmasters, and rowing machines, as well as a few free weights and various Nautilus machines and small aerobics room. As a hotel gym it was more than adequate, and has a small pool, jacuzzi, and wet/dry saunas. The pool is not very big though, and definitely not large enough in which to swim laps. But rather just for relaxing.

I found Dublin an expensive city, and the Hilton Dublin Kilmainham was an excellent value. For me, it was worth the extra effort to get to for the extra space, comfort, and quiet for a very reasonable price.",5,2008,12,17
240,I love to stay in this property,"I have been to Dublin a few Times and I stayed in the last 3 at the Hilton Dublin Kilmainham. I call the in house reservation, very friendly people and i always get better deal. Front office staff is very friendly and helpfull, they love to chat and help me and my family. The room are nice and clean. I like this hotel for the position as we can walk to the Phenix Park, the Modern art museum is near, Kilmainham goal is just in front of the hotel. We can take buses or walk to Heuston station in a few minutes. The taxi is just ‚Ç¨7 to ‚Ç¨10 one way. It is very quiet location in the evening so we don't hear the noise from the weekend people on the street. We like to stay here as we go everytime at the Gunnies Store house, just a few minutes walking distance. Dinner is good and the price is resonable. Me and my family we love the Breakfast as every Hilton, full Irish and continental, and we can eat as much as we want. The great thing is the bar, on Weekend there is live music so we like to sit and enjoy a few drinks. I live in spain and i like to visit dublin often, I advice everyone to visit this great city. I hear they have a special price from ‚Ç¨49 per person sharing from June to december. Get the opportunity!! call them and make a wonderfull holiday to ireland.",4,2008,12,17
240,"Hard to say a good word, sorry.....","Stayed here in Nov 08, Fri to Sunday Supervalu break, so only cost 219 euro for 2 adults sharing, b&b with one evening meal.  Can only write two positives on this property - it's proximity to the N7 and also to the Zoo!  Reception staff were slightly friendly, but didnt over-do it.  The room was nice enough, but the shaving mirror came off in my hand and smashed everywhere.  Breakfast was really 'only' ok, certainly not worth the 19.95 that people who booked room-only, or who seemed to be studying nearby and popped in for food first, were paying.  The evening meal, which was included in our package was probably the biggest let-down; We didn't order starters, as we were late enough getting to the restaurant, and ordered a simple enough main course and a plate of plain pasta for a fussy 4-year old.  We were left waiting 45 minutes for this simple order and to be honest, it was woeful.  The chicken dish was over-cooked to the point of being inedible and was accompanied by what i'm sure were frozen 'cheap' big fries, not suitable at all for the dish in question.The pasta was kindly completely covered in parsley; not quite fitting the 'plain' that had been ordered and our little girl wouldn't touch it.  All in all the meal was very disappointing and we left without dessert or tea or coffee.  I did voice my disappointment to the maitre d' who was quite nice about it and offered to give the meal free of charge, but i pointed out it was an all-in package.  They did have the common sense not to charge for the childs dinner i'm glad to say.  

I don't usually write negative reviews, i do like to give the hotels we visit the benefit of doubt.  However i was very disappointed with our visit to this hotel.  We had stayed in the Clarion in Liffey Valley some time previously, and found that much more appealing, although not as well geographically placed.  I think the Hilton group are being a bit optimistic placing this hotel in the 4 -star category.",2,2008,12,09
240,Stick with Jurys,"we wanted to stay in Dublin for the night inexpensively, and without fuss. The reception was lovely, the room was nice, we dropped our bags and headed out for the night. On returning we found that the room was quite noisy, we'd asked to be away from traffic, but we could hear it clearly, then we also noticed that the mini bar was a noisy humming fridge, and the extractor in the bathroom gave off the most irritation drone, which we waited to shut off, but it never happened. We got the night manager up to the room, he was prompt and helpful, but unable to do anything. I managed to get the fridge off eventually and by about 5am tiredness blocked out the drone from the extractor and we had a few fitful hours sleep before the traffic started.
I've noticed in the past, the constant noise from ventilation in otherwise nice hotels, this seems to be acceptable, but we're paying to sleep in a place and feel we are entitled to peace and quiet.
The next morning the reception basically dismissed us and said they hadn't got any request from us with the booking for quiet. I think in future we'll stick with Jurys.
Hilton is nice, clean, well placed and inexpensive, but they don't seem to care that noise can really be a pain, stay if you will, but bring ear plugs.",2,2008,12,08
240,Very Good Hote,"Over the last six months I have spent approx. 6 nights in this Hotel. All of these stays were business related. I found the Hotel staff to be friendly, polite and helpful. The food and prices are very good. Parking is available, and whilst there isn't a swimming pool there is an excellent Hydro spa/pool.
The only disadvantage to the Hotel is it's location. It is not in walking distance of the city center.",4,2008,12,01
240,Excellent Hotel For Our Purpose,"We stayed at this hotel for three nights and were very impressed with by the overall standards.The staff were very friendly and helpful,and the rooms very modern and clean.
We were attending a concert just across the road at the Museum Of Modern Art,and for this the location was excellent.The hotel is also just across the road from the famous Gaol,to which a trip is thoroughly recommended.
Had we been staying specifically for a taste of Dublin City Centre life we would have chosen a more centrally located hotel,the only ""problem"" that we had was that a taxi ride is neccessary for travelling to and from the city centre.
For our purpose however,fantastic,and a hotel that we would certainly recommend.",5,2008,11,19
240,Worth visiting,"The Hilton Kilmainham Hotel is bright, and clean. We have visited this hotel every time we fly to Dublin and hope to continue doing so. The accommodation is comfortable and decorated to a high standard. The food is well cooked and the service was as you would expect. The hotel is far enough from the centre to enjoy a good sleep but close enough to enjoy the night life, the room we stayed in was very spacious and clean. Thanks to all.",4,2008,11,10
240,Great stay,Had a great stay at this hotel in sept/oct 2008. Hotell staff very helpful and perfect service. Nice pool/gym area available free for guests. Rooms very nice and new. Will stay here again. Busses leave for the city centre all the time(10 minutes by bus) and also hop on / hop off busses stop down the road....,5,2008,10,04
240,Will definitely return here,My partner and I stayed here for three nights and we loved it. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Top marks to them. The standard double room as very comfortable. Room service was great. The hydrotherapy pool was fabulous. Everything was clean and fresh. The location was perfect for us although a little out of the city centre. I genuinely look forward to my next visit here.,5,2008,08,31
240,Great Stay in June 2008,"We stayed at the Hilton Dublin Kilmainham at the end of June 2008.

The hotel is very modern and across the street from the Kilmainham Goal (pronounced jail).  We found the staff to be friendly, efficient and accommodating.  Breakfast was good and plentiful and the restaurant staff was terrific.   We also had lunch in the bar/cafe.  The food and the service were also excellent. 

As another reviewer mentioned, there are not many Irish working in the hotel especially at the front desk.  We didn't find this an issue.  We found everyone helpful and courteous.

The hotel is about 3 miles from Center City but we had no issues takling the city bus or the LUAS into town and back to the hotel.  Heuston Station is a 30 minute walk from the hotel or a 10 minute cab ride.

The weekend we were there there was a concert across the street at the Museum of Modern Art (Royal Hospital, Kilmainham) so the area was very crowded as was the hotel that evening.  We were out that evening and arrived back around 1am and we didn't have a problem with noise from other guests.

We had a King Deluxe room and our balcony overlooked the Royal Hospital (MOMA) grounds.  Just lovely.  The room was more than large enough for the 2 of us.  Our shower worked just fine.

We liked the pool/fitness area but when we went to use it, it was crowded with people who pay a membership to use the facilities  and were not hotel guests.

Great place to stay if you don't mind being outside of the city.",5,2008,08,13
240,Chosen the wrong weekend for a relaxing stay,"Because my husband and I decided to make a short city trip to Dublin to celebrate a major wedding anniversary I booked this hotel months in advance. During the months to come I saw rates in this hotel skyrocketing, not knowing why. It was after our arrival we became aware that it was the weekend that Leonard Cohen would have a performance on the venue next to the hotel. And what should have been a relaxing weekend turned out to be completely otherwise. 

From the airport we took the 3-day Freedom pass with Airlink, it costs 25 euro p.p. and it gives return airport transfer (with direct connection to the city center), 3 days of unlimited bus services and hop on and off city tours.  In the city center (O‚ÄôConnell street) we took this tourist bus because it stops at the Kilmainham Goal, just opposite this Hilton hotel. (And have some sightseeing on the first day of our arrival as well.) During our weekend we only took this bus, it goes of course not directly to the center, but it was nice to see other aspects of the city as well. Every time we had new drivers and they all tell the stories differently. 

We arrived in the early evening and the hotel was very busy, people everywhere. Check-in went smooth by a friendly girl. She said we would have an upgrade because of our Diamond HHonors status, but when we were in our room it didn‚Äôt felt quite that way (there is no executive level, but we expected to have a room with balcony, unfortunately the hotel was fully booked). Our room was on the 6th and highest floor and the view outside was limited. Due to a sort of cage construction, which has no other use than to tickle the ego of the architect. The room had high ceilings though, so we find it very humorous that our Diamond status gave us 1.5 m or 5 feet of extra space to look at when lying in bed. 

It found it also hilarious that in the bathroom after 5 minutes of trying to get just water and of the right temperature (very hard to see!) I could only use the hand shower. For the shower I had to use another small faucet just above. 

The room was further of a proper size with a table and comfortable chair, a working desk with chair and a good quality King bed. There is a water cooker with Nescafe coffee (always far less than a normal coffeemaker). For our Diamond status/wedding anniversary? we got two small bottles of water, a mini bottle of wine, some fruit and 2 chocolates.  (We couldn‚Äôt use the free breakfast for Diamond/Gold members because we already had an arrangement with breakfast and one dinner.)

The breakfast was excellent, many things to choose from. For dinner they offer a buffet and, to our regret, no 3 course dinner. We didn‚Äôt want the buffet and with our arrangement we could use the a-la-carte menu for 27 euro per person (average price of a main course is 25 euro). Our meal was very average, no top class dinner, my husband had a steak (31 euro!) and that was not so good, it was also ordered medium and it was well done. 

Our greatest misfortune for choosing this weekend was two nights without proper sleep. The first night there were guests sitting on the outside terrace who made a lot of noise. It started around midnight and continued until one o‚Äôclock. The second night there was a slightly drizzle and we felt lucky about that. But then we heard loud noise around one o‚Äôclock and it kept on going. After one hour I called the reception and I was told that it was on the 3rd floor. They would take care of that, the screaming and so on stopped but then there were other loud cries at three and at four o‚Äôclock by drunken people. 

II found the distance from the city center no problem at all. I would still have given it a rating of 3 out of 5 with just one night without sleep, but two nights is far more than we could bear, that‚Äôs why I gave it only a 2.",2,2008,07,28
240,Great stay in Dublin,"Well, this review is a little late, but better than never. My hubby and I stayed at the Hilton Kilmainham for 4 nights back in November last year. I found a really good deal on their website which included dinner on the first night for min of 2 nights. As we were intending on staying 4 nights I checked with the hotel whether this meant we would get 2 dinners on the first and third night, but they said no and that if we wanted that we would have to make 2 bookings. This really wasn't a problem for us, so we decided to do it this way. The thing was they couldn't promise us the same room, but in the end we didn't have to move at all, which was great!
The hotel itself was obviously nice and new, and the staff there were really nice. Some people find that it is out of the way, but it really only was a short 10 min walk down to the train station and the luas (which we loved!).Also, as the jail is just down the road there is a tourist bus stop, so if you have tickets (which we did) it is an easy way to get to town. The food is very good as well.
Overall, we really stayed here because the deal was too good to pass up. If they didn't have it we probably would have stayed somewhere closer to the centre of town, but it was just too good for value. 
You really can't go wrong staying here!",5,2008,07,27
240,great hotel to relax,"This was our second stay, and as before we loved the hydrotherapy pool. This alone makes the Hilton Dublin Kilmainham worth staying in. Pure heaven!!

Our room was ready well before the standard check-in time which is always welcome. 

The bar food was excellent: one of the best steaks my wife had had, and very good portions. Other hotels take note.

We had difficulty with the air conditioning in the room, however. Given that our last stay involved two room changes, we chose to grin and bear the lack of cool air this time.

One little gripe was the lack of UTV & Channel 4 on the TV, and it must be said, the range of movies was less than that of other hotels we use.

Overall, we enjoyed our short stay, and look forward to returning soon.",4,2008,07,12
240,Fine new hotel,"Stayed here for a weekend to attend a Leonard Cohen concert very nearby. A little out of the city, near Kilmainham gaol and 10 to 15 minute to the train station. Very clean room, nice and spacious. Bar food for lunch is just ok. Adjacent to the N4, so easy access to the 'West'. and onto the M50 for Dublin airport.",4,2008,06,23
240,OK stay...,"Chose this hotel because of Hilton's reputation.  We were checked in by an unfriendly desk clerk, who was not helpful nor friendly. It was obvious that we were American and had no clue about Dublin. When asked about information about tourist activities we were given the answer, nothing is open after 5pm.  Thanks...  We then made our way after having to figure it out ourselves down to the city, where we were able to get into St. Patricks and even the Temple Bar (that is obviously open past 5).

We then asked him the best way to get to the airport, as we would have to leave around 6. The answer we were given was ""there is no public transportation that early"".  OK, well he never ""offered"" to set up a taxi until I had to ask.... 

The real kicker was when we tried to call an 800 number from our room. After trying 5 different numbers, we called downstairs and was basically told that there was nothing he could do and didn't know why it wasn't working. We then decided to go to use payphones in the lobby. When we got downstairs we were shocked to hear that there was not 1 payphone in the lobby. So then at 9pm, we headed 3 blocks away to use a payphone. Upon our return, there was a friendly female deskclerk, that told us that the in room phones block certain 800 calls, but she would make sure that our phones were in fact turned on.  She told me that if i needed to dial out again, that we could call her and she would connect us to the number through the swichboard. that was the kind of service I expect.

Overall, the rooms are absolutely beautiful, but the service is not what I expect from a Hilton.  Who wants to feel like they are ""bothering"" someone in the service industry.",3,2008,06,06
240,Amazing service!!!,I have just returned from a wonderful stay at the Hilton Hotel Kilmainham.  My husband and I decided to celebrate our first wedding anniversary here and we weren't disappointed.  The hotel is new and very clean but what is so outstanding about this hotel is the service.  From the moment we arrived till when we left everything was taken care of and nothing was a hassle.  On arrival to our room the airconditioning was not working but a quick call brought the manager and a repair man.  As it couldn't be fixed quickly another room was given to us and we had a bottle of wine delivered to our room as an apology for the inconvience.  We had dinner on arrival and we very well looked after.  We were staying in a deluxe room on the 5th floor which has amazing views and a balcony we used both nights to sip champange on.  The room was very large quiet and cool.  The hotel is slightly out of the town centre but as Dublin is so busy it is nice to dip in and out of it.  The jail across the road is well worth a visit.  We have been to Dublin many times and this is the best hotel we have stayed in by far.,5,2008,06,03
240,Excellent Stay at Hilton,"Just back from an excellent stay at the Kilmainham Hilton in Dublin. It is a lovely new hotel but more importantly the standard of service by all staff was excellent.

The hotel is three miles out of town but we used the tram service in and out of town without any problems. Ideally localed to visit Kilmainham Gaol. The open top city tour also stopped outside the hotel.

Booked the deal directly on the Hilton web site and had a good deal for B&B.

The Italian restaurant on the corner opposite was good, very attentive staff, good food and don't be put off by the fairly basic decor and furnishing. They were really nice people.",5,2008,05,12
240,Nice hotel,"I stayed here with my girlfriend as a birthday treat for her and was not disappointed. 

The hotel is fairly new and as you'd expect the decor was smart and new. The room itself was a 'deluxe' room and large. The bed was king size and very comfortable. The bathroom was quite big including a nice double sized shower which was powerful. There was a nice LCD TV with various Irish and British channels, kettle, comfortable chairs, large desk and large mirror, minibar, large wardrobe, iron, hairdryer etc.

We used the leisure facilities twice. The pool although small was nice to relax in...the sauna, jacuzzi and steam room were spot on. The bar downstairs was a good place to relax on a night. 

The customer service was overall very good. Most of the staff seemed to be Slovakians/Poles and were very good and very helpful.

We paid for the breakfast in advance and to be honest the 'hot' food such as bacon, sausages etc was not of the highest standard although there was a very big choice. There was a good selection of health foods though like fruit, smoothies and fruit juice. 

The location was alright. Opposite the old Kilmainham jail (which we never visited) and close to bus stops which have services to the city centre. It is generally a 10-15 euro journey charge to Temple Bar and the same on return (more expensive on a night though). The hotel is walkable to The Guinness Store House and The Zoo/Phoenix Park and if you don't mind walking for 30 minutes or so you could probably reach Temple Bar. 

I had the best pint of Guinness ever at the pub (which by Dublin standards is very cheap) across the road and there's an Italian restaurant upstairs which we visited, although we weren't that impressed with the quality of the food.

If you're after a wild weekend at Temple Bar then I'd suggest staying nearer to the city centre but if you're a business traveller or wanting to visit the main attractions in Dublin such as The Guinness Store House, Zoo, Kilmainham Jail etc then stay here.",5,2008,04,06
240,What a find!,"I stayed in the Hilton Kilmainham with my partner over the Easter weekend. My partner booked a deluxe room on the hotel website for a great price, which included breakfast. 

For our entire stay the staff were very helpful and courteous. The room that the hotel had provided was the very best, with fantastic views of Dublin. 

As it was a celebration, we were greeted with complimentary chocolates and a lovely bottle of wine. The room size was huge with lounge area, king size (very comfy) bed, climate control, tv/work space/drink making facilities area, double wardrobe w/iron & ironing board, fully equipped bathroom inc. double shower and a large balcony. The room was modern and clean. We had a peaceful sleep as the hotel is situated in a quiet part of town. 

The included breakfast was a buffet style feast to cater for all and the health club was fantastic with great facilities. As for transport, we had no problems. If you are staying in Dublin for 3 consecutive days, you can buy a freedom ticket for 25 euros which allows you to roam the city on the hop on/hop off sightseeing city tour bus, airport shuttle bus and night bus. We bought our tickets from the airport.

The City Sightseeing Tour - Hop on Hop off stops directly outside the hotel, next to the Old KIlmainham Gaol. This When this service finishes for the day around 6pm, one can take the day/night bus service which takes around 10 minutes to get to and from the city centre. 

As for Dublin, I think 3 days was just enough. Highlights were of course The Guinness Factory (a little tip - book your tickets in advance on the net and skip the queue!), The Old Jameson's Distillery (another little tip - if you want to take part in the extra tasting session at the end of the tour, have some banter with your tour guide beforehand and stick your hand up high when asked to participate), National Gallery, Dublin Castle, Kilmainham Gaol, Phoenix Park (inc Zoo) and Irish Dancing - all of which you should experience. 

Now for the small negatives...Temple Bar was a let down, more of a lads/lasses night out - it's very touristy and to be honest - dirty and gritty. We ate in the area for one night and the food was disgusting and overpriced. Alcoholic drinks in certain areas of Dublin are generally pricey - so be aware! The best food that we ate was actually in the distilleries at a reasonable price. I also had an excellent Irish coffee in the Jameson's Distillery. 

I hope this review has been helpful to you all, enjoy Dublin!",5,2008,03,26
240,Great Hotel,"I booked directly from the Hilton website, in doing so I got a dinner, bed and breakfast special offer.
I didnt get to use the facilities of the hotel but it is really new and the room is very nicely arranged, with a flat screen TV and new decor.
The hotel is about 10 by bus from the Temple bar area, and there are about 4 public buses that do this route, so is easy to get to.

The food is fabulous. The dinner was a fantastic 3 course meal , and the breakfast was a buffet , everything you could possibly want in a breakfast.

The staff were very friendly and gave us tips and useful information about the city. You can buy a city rambler bus ticket ( vailid on all dublin buses including the airport ones) from the reception desk.

Would definately recommend",5,2008,03,23
240,Ideal Hotel,"Great hotel.  Very clean, beds extremely comfortable, helpful staff, nice bar.  Stayed for three nights while visiting Ireland to see family.  Bus service to and from the city 1.50 euro each way.  Taxis in abundance, approx 10-15 euro each way to city centre.  I would definately stay in this hotel again.",4,2008,03,10
240,"Fantastic Rooms, Loved the leisure facilities","I stayed at this hotel with my partner for 2 nights in February 2008. I cannot compliment this hotel enough.  We stayed in a delxue room which was spotless, the kingsize bed was one of the most comfortable I have slept in. The large bathroom was a pleasure, the shower cubicle large enough for two! The leisure facilities were excellent, with jacuzzi, hydro pool, sauna and steam room.  We ate in the hotel on the first night as this was included.  The only negative was the over-priced wine. The location of the hotel may not suit all.  We were looking for somewhere out of the hustle and bustle so this was perfect. You can use the hop on hop off bus which stops directly outside of the hotel, cost 15 euro per person and the ticket lasts for 24 hours.  Other than that the 79 or 79A bus takes you straight into the centre.  We had no problems getting about. Make sure that you visit the Guiness Storehouse the view from the gravity bar at the top is fantastic.  Overall we had a fantastic time and I would definitley stay in this hotel again.",5,2008,02,20
240,Nice hotel but undesirable location,"We spent two nights here but really didn't spend much time in the hotel at all.  It's too far away from downtown Dublin so we ended up only coming back to the hotel to sleep.  We did visit the pool once though and it was very nice but we had to buy a bathing cap?!  I was surprised they weren't given out for free.

The hotel itself was excellent but you have to take a cab to go anywhere.  The concierge was nice and helpful.  The open top bus tour goes by outside on occasion which is another travel option.

Dublin is such a fun city that you're cheating yourself if you don't stay closer to the downtown area.",3,2008,01,24
240,Excellent for a short break!,"Having not been away without the kids for quite a while I booked a room at Hilton Kilmainham taking advantage of the 2 for 1 offer (2 nights for the price of one including breakfast)!! We wanted somewhere out of the hustle and bustle of the city centre and this hotel was just perfectly located for us!! Only a 10 minute bus/ Luas journey into the town centre with the public transport running VERY frequently and only costing 1.40 Euro for the bus and 1.60 Euro for the Luas it was very reasonable.

The area surrounding the hotel is very quiet and no disturbances from late night revellers or traffic. You can get the hop on hop off open top tourist bus from outside Kilmainham Gaol which is opposite the hotel.

The hotel was immaculate with good sized rooms, comfortable beds and the option of feather pillows (you just have to request these) it made for a great comfortable nights sleep. The leisure facilities in the hotel were excellent with a gym, pool (although not large it is big enough for a swim) jaccuzzi, steam room and sauna. Changing rooms were very clean and well equipped with lockers, showers, body wash, shampoo and hairdryers.

We checked in on Friday afternoon and were greeted by a friendly, informative and efficient receptionist. 

We did have a problem with the room though which was not apparent until the wind picked up in the night. Outside the window there was a cage like construction which looked rather like an oversized aviary. As the wind got stronger there was the most annoying loud banging noise, the wind was causing the sides of the wire meshing to bang against the posts. Needless to say I did not sleep that first night, my husband however did not lose a minutes sleep! When we went down for breakfast the next morning we reported this noise to reception who were VERY apologetic and immediately transferred us to a quieter room at the back of the hotel. Apparently they had had several complaints from guests about the same issue that night!!

Breakfast was excellent, fresh, hot and a good choice of both continental and cooked items.

I would certainly recommend the hotel however if you look out and see a cage outside your window ask to be moved room!!",4,2007,12,31
240,"Nice hotel, good price, not exactly central","Nice, new hotel with comfortable rooms that are surprisingly large for Ireland. Located across the street from Kilmainham prison but not exactly close to central Dublin. However, you can pick up a bus very easily into the city centre. Expect to spend about 15 euro to get a cab back from Temple Bar.  I would stay at this hotel again.",5,2007,12,16
240,Hotels Dublin,"We stayed at this hotel and were very impressed. It is a new hotel. Staff was great. Rooms and facilities were very nice.

We found it very easy to get to the center of town. We took the hop on hop off bus from across the street, but the walk isn't out of the question if you are even a little fit.
We ate breakfast as part of a package and it was tremendous.
The deal we got was just about as affordable as anything available at the time we went which was early October.

I have seen fancier hotels; but I would recomend this hotel to everyone.",5,2007,12,04
240,Beautiful Propery,Prettiest Hilton I have ever seen.(The fact that it is new helps).15 minutes from City Centre by bus.Across street from Historic Jail.VERY friendly staff and excellent Leisure Facilities.,5,2007,12,02
240,great hotel,"I booked two night B&B with free evening meal on the first night. I had booked a smoking twin room but I knew this could not be guaranteed. When I arrived I was offered a smoking double room or a non smoking twin. We took the Non smoking twin.

The three course dinner would have cost 80 euro for two off us from the menu (we got it free ), it was lovely couldnt fault it, but not worth 80 euro. We dined at the Italian restaurant across the road the second night for less than half the price.

The hotel is lovely but we had to get a taxi into Dublin ,because off road works and delays the taxi cost 16 euro, the return taxi was 9 euro. All the taxi's are metered so you pay for delays.

On the day off departure, at 8.30 am we asked for a taxi, we had to catch a train at 9:35am. We where told the taxi would be 15 minutes. 30 minutes we where told it would be quicker to walk to the luas tram (in the rain). We missed our 9:35 train. To be fair I cant blame the hotel for this and I caught the  next train at 11:00am. However if I had to catch a plane or boat I would have been in trouble.

The hotel staff are mostly from eastern europe but speak good English.
The only downside to this hotel is its location. if you have to get taxi's due to bad weather as I did then its a bad location.",4,2007,11,22
240,Lovely new hotel in perfect location!!,"After reading reviews on this Hotel i wasn't going to book as i think the location is one of the most important reasons to stay. People have said on pervious reviews it is far from the City Centre but believe me its not, you get a bus outside the door of the Hotel & it takes 5 minutes to Temple Bar or get a taxi for 7euros!!! I would deffinetly recommend this Hotel, it is a lovely 4* star & the facilities are great. It was my 1st time in Dublin & it will be my last, i thought it was a complete rip off & not as gd as people make it out to be but as for this Hotel it is very reasonable & alot nicer than the Hotels & B&Bs in the City Centre you would pay double the price for. If you are planning on going to Temple Bar take alot of money as i went with my Boyfriend & for 2 drinks in most pubs it was between 17 - 19 euros. 

The Hilton Kilmainham is the only gd thing i have to say about Dublin but as for the pubs/drinks etc its far to expensive & nothing great....",4,2007,11,19
240,"Nice accomodation, but not at all central","The hotel itself is nice and clean.   When I asked desk staff at 10 p.m. for a place to get some food, I was called a cab to send me on a 15 euro trip into town.  They forgot to mention that there's an excellent, reasonably priced Italian restaurant less than a block from the hotel.  While the hotel is billed as being very central, the center of Dublin is a 45 minute to one hour walk away.",4,2007,11,12
240,Reasonable value for Dublin,"Very good, and brand new, four star hotel, and particularly so if you have a car, although there is an overnight parking charge of 11 euros. The (foreign) check in staff were very helpful. The immediate location is OK. There is a pub across the road, with an Italian restaurant on the upper floor of the same building. The pub is OK but I only dined in the city centre so cannot comment about the restaurant. The entrance to the Irish Museum of Modern Art is just across the road. It sits in it's own expansive grounds in the former Royal Hospital and from the entrance it takes about 10 minutes to get to the museum. The Kilmainham Gaol museum is also across the road. Other than that there isn't much to do locally but taxis cost just under 10 euros and there is a bus stop within a 3 minute walk. The Luas stop at St James' Hospital is a fifteen minute walk...(unless you are an Olympic sprinter!) This is an area that is clearly undergoing huge redevelopment and with the completion of some nearby office blocks etc. is going to improve considerably fairly soon.
The hotel represents good value for Dublin, and if location is a lower priority than the quality of the accommodation then this is a very attractive choice.",5,2007,11,09
240,"perfect, perfect!!!","I can't even begin to describe how fabulous this hotel is.  It is brand new and so beautiful!!!!  The pool/spa was amazing, the room was awesome and the facilities all around were awesome too.  The room was very clean and very spacious.  The TV was cool too, with it's choice of music and on demand movies!!  Not that we took advantage, but if we had to be in the room it was great!!!",5,2007,11,07
240,Another Dublin Hilton,"What is it with Hilton Hotels in Dublin, there is clearly demand its a very popular city for tourists, Hilton are meeting this demand by building lovely new hotels. Kilmainham is no exception, brand new great check in staff, wonderful room, plasma tv, luxury bathroom, top class gym, nice pool spa, with sauna and steam, nice bar, a little expensive but Dublin tends to be.
But just like the airport Hilton this one fails badly on location, the location just does not work, its stuck in the middle of nowhere.
A 10 euro taxi ride from the city centre takes you to the hotel once there, you will find yourself at a busy road junction, one pub across the road and nothing else. Its a 5/10 min walk to the nearest LUAS station and another 15 minutes on the Luas to reach the city centre
Hilton must do better they have the right hotels they just keep putting them in the wrong places, If you stay here expect high standards but dont expect a Dublin City Centre location",3,2007,10,29
240,Disappointing Value,"Stayed for one night but came away feeling that there was better value else where. I phoned the hotel direct to make a booking but I was put through to central reservations - less personal I find. 

1st impressions were very good - Hotel is new, modern, clean etc. I booked a twin room in that it was only for an over night stay but in saying that I can't remeber the last time I ended up in a single bed so I think this is a little bit too cute charging an extra ‚Ç¨30 for a double bed. 

The bit that really got to me however was a charge of ‚Ç¨20 for internet access. Given the hotel is located out of town and there is very little to do at night I really think this was a rip off. 

Basically the hotel itself is very nice and I must also mention they have a great leisure centre attached however if you have to pay the extra for a double bed and internet access then you will get a similar standard in city centre for the same money. 

Ultimately I think value is far more important than price and I came away with the feeling that there was a bit of a rip off culture. For the 1st time ever I took the time to fill out the comments card in detail given it is a fine new hotel which deserves to do the business
however I haven't heard back yet.  

Personally I would recommend the Morrison Hotel in city centre over the Hilton on this basis in that it is ideally located and works out better value for money.",2,2007,10,20
240,Wouldn't stay again,"This was the first night hotel on a Globus tour.  We arrived around 10:00 AM on Sunday morning after an overnight flight.  We knew our rooms wouldn't be ready that early, but didn't get our rooms until long after 3:00 PM.  The staff didn't seem to care whether or not we even had rooms.  No effort was made to accomodate our group, even though they knew full well how many rooms were required long before we arrived.  My wife & I finally took naps on the sofas in the lobby.  I considered the staff's apathy to be inexcusable.  We wouldn' t stay there again.",1,2007,10,17
240,Lovely hotel,"We stayed for a weekend.  The interior is superb.  Our room was spacious and comfortable enough to really relax in.  The ensuite was stunning.

Staff were helpful.  The surroundings were so inviting we decided to eat lunch there before heading into Dublin - it was delicious!",5,2007,10,15
240,Dublin Kilmainham Hotel - nice & new,"We stayed here for two nights,with dinner on 1st.night as part of the deal. There was a great selection  of 4 courses to choose from ,however,we were not told that we were only entitled to pick 3  from 4.Well,we were pretty full after having 3 courses,so we opted to have a coffee instead of the pudding.
It was a wee shock to be presented with a bill for 4 euros each for this (instant) coffee on leaving the restaurant.Even more so,when we could have had a nicer coffee in the lounge for 3.50 euros!
However,apart from this,our stay here was very good,the rooms are lovely & spacious,with good quality bedding & towels,etc.
Also,despite the ceiling to floor window facing onto a busy road,there was very little external noise.A definite plus when trying to get a good sleep!
Unlike another reviewer who also arrived early,we had to wait quite a while for our room.However,this let us take a stroll over to the  Modern Art Museum across the road.Whatever you think of art(this was an Indian exhibition) the building itself + the surrounding gardens,is just magnificent.Well worth going to see. Don't miss the Manicured Gardens behind the museum - lovely.
And don't forget to visit the Kilmainham Gaol,a sombre,but fascinating insight into Irish history. The guide,surprisingly(or not these days in Dublin)though very good,was not Irish,but Slovenian!
There's a very limited selection of eateries but the Patriot across the road does a fair selection of mainly Italian dishes(though I wasn't too sure of the pasta dish with a pretty strong curry taste!)
Yes,this hotel is a wee bit away from the hustle & bustle of the main action,but that's no bad thing.It can get pretty hectic in the tourist parts.",4,2007,10,11
240,good for dublin,"have just returned from this hotel while staying in the city, over all it was a good hotel, as a new hilton i was expecting good quality
and high standard and on most fronts these were met. its location isn't the best but this is reflected in the price and there is a good
bus service that takes you into the heart of the city in about 15mins, the rooms are large and clean, my only criticism would be there are no reading flights as you would find in most hotels, so if you wanted to read while your partner sleeps this may be a problem, the public areas were pleasant and clean, the breakfast was nice tho the room was rather small and if hotel was full i feel it would be very crowed, i would probably use this hotel again if the price was right",4,2007,10,04
240,Nice New Hotel,"We stayed at this hotel for two nights as part of a CIE tour.  The hotel is new and very nice.  The bed was comfortable, the towels were clean, the breakfast was good.  The location was the only knock.  It was across the street from the old Gaol, which was nice, but there was a limited selection of tourist items or nearby restaurants.  As part of a tour group, no problem, but if you are staying there by yourself, it's not that convenient.",4,2007,10,02
240,Great new hotel with terrific staff,"Found this hotel right here on Tripadvisor and I heartily endorse it.  The hotel is very new and very clean.  The front desk staff were extremely efficient checking us in and even had a room available at 9AM (check in is officially much later) which for this tired traveler was fantastic.  Security at the hotel is good with a keycard required to get above the public areas of the hotel.   Parking is available underground.  
The rooms are large, i.e., US sized.   Ours had a large king sized bed, desk, table, several chairs and, surprisingly, a cathedral ceiling.  The bathroom was also great with a wonderful shower (lots of pressure, lots of water), and bright sink area.
The staff called to ensure that we were happy in our room and seemed to actually care what I had to say versus doing the check because they had to.  
The staff in the cafe were very friendly and the coffee there is terrific, both tasty and strong.  We only had breakfast in the hotel one morning and that buffet is very good but a little pricey if you ask me at 20 euro.  Ireland is a great place to get a filling breakfast at many places for less than half of that, so that's what we did.  
The hotel is across from the Kilmainham Jail which is easy to find and not in the hustle and bustle of the city centre area.  We'd stayed several times at the Paramount and the Jury's Inn and found it pretty noisy (the Paramount in particular).  This place was blissfully quiet at night.  Also, there are several bus lines that run frequently (i.e., every 10 minutes) to the city centre just two blocks away for 1.40 euro each way so that made getting around simple.  The Louis is a little bit father away and supposed to be great but we stuck with the buses.  
We had dinner in town each night except for our first night.  We were exhausted from our flight and just had room service.  I had a pizza which was nicely prepared and had some nice zip to the sausage.   My daughter had the chicken curry and liked it very much.  The food came up very quickly and was nicely served by a friendly waiter without spilling a drop of the two pints we ordered to go with our food.
My complaints?  Well the internet access is pricey, 20 euro for 24 hours or 99 euro for a week.  That seems pretty high.  Also, there isn't an obvious ramp to get up into the hotel.  there are some nice well lit stairs, but if you're wheeling luggage you have to go round near the car park and back to the front door.  Also, and this is probably my fault, the lovely plasma TV would flicker at night.  I tried finding another way to turn it all the way off but I resorted to pulling the plug at night.  Those are really very small nits to what I think is a great hotel.  
My daughter is attending college in Dublin so I will be visiting again and will definately stay at the Hilton Kilmainham if it's available.",5,2007,10,01
240,Great Hotel Just Keep In Mind Its Location,"We stayed at both the Hilton Dublin and Hilton Kilmainham over a long weekend through the honors program. The Kilmainham is Hilton‚Äôs newest hotel and very stylish in Dublin. Everything is lovely, fresh and new. The deluxe room was very spacious and the bathroom had a bath with shower and a large separate overhead shower cubical. The bed was absolutely huge and very comfortable. I‚Äôve stayed in a lot of hotels and this bed was the best I‚Äôve slept in. There is Sky TV and a mini bar for those that need it. Security is good with lift floors being restricted to those with room cards. The staff are very friendly and are always there to assist. Nothing seems to be too much of a problem. 

The hotel is really easy to get to from the airport. Just get the 474 airport bus to the final stop at Central Bus station (6 euros) which takes about 20mins. I wouldn‚Äôt bother with an airport taxis. When we were there the queues were so large that I think we got to the hotel before we would have managed to get a taxis from the airport. From the bus station jump in a cab for a quick 5min ride to the hotel (you can always walk too!). 

The location of the hotel means its nice and quiet but also means it‚Äôs can be a good 10-15min taxis ride to the buzz of the city centre depending on traffic and one way systems e.g. Temple bars so keep in mind. Taxis can be expense if using them a lot. Typically we were paying around 10 euros a ride (even a short distance). We also read there was a shortage of city centre taxis but we never once had any trouble getting taxis straight away.

If I was pushed to decide between the Hilton Dublin and Hilton Kilmainham I would probably go for the Kilmainham and pay the extra for taxis. The hotel is in much better condition, quieter inside and out with better rooms. It also has a fabulous gym and facilities. The only slight down side is its location.",5,2007,10,01
240,great value for Dublin.,Got this on the website at last minute for a good price. The rooms are large and comfertable. The bathroom is also of a really good size.The place as its new is very clean. The staff were very helpful esp a guy in reception called Imran. The breakfast was well owrth the extra 10euro per room . The food was good and there was a hugh choice you would not get anything that good for as near a price in dublin. The place was a bit out of the city but as there is not that many nice hotels in the center and the ones which are good book up really quickly we did not mind. There is a bus accross the street and a luas 7 minutes straight downhill.,4,2007,10,01
240,"Great Hotel, Bad Location","The hotel itself is very nice -nice bar and hotel in general.  Our room was very nicely decorated, good comfortable bed, mini bar, bathroom was all good.  Staff was helpful and friendly.  
The hotel location is not the best as it is a good deal out of town.  Your options are to get a taxi or there is a few transporation routes - the city tour buses come through every 15 minutes just a 3 min walk up the street.  You can walk through some neighborhoods for 10 mins and come to the local train Luis stop.  
As my title says - great hotel with a bad location.  If the closer to town hotels are a bit pricy or full - go here.",4,2007,09,29
240,Fabulous new hotel,"In my party was myself my wife and her mother. We booked the Hilton through Trip Advisor. The hotel is relatively new so the decor and rooms are excellent.

The total cost for two double rooms on a Saturady night was ¬£157 not including breakfast. 

Because it is new it was difficult to locate the hotel but it is right next to Kilmainham Jail which is defunct and is now a museum.

There is an underground car park next to the hotel and the parking rates are charged to your hotel bill.

We ate evening meal at a little Itailian/pizza restaurant just across the street which was good value and I would also recommend. 

Breakfast in the hotel was busy and we had to wait a little time to get a seat. However the breakfast itself was huge with a self service choice of  fruits, continental, cereal etc. The traditional Irish breakfast is also self service with an almost ""eat as much as you like"" choice of bacon, scrambled eggs mushrooms, beans, black and white pudding, sausage, hash browns, tomato. Also included is tea (or coffee) and toast. Breakfast cost about 15 euros each.

Although the hotel is little out of town (about 5 miles) in my view that has its advantages as Dublin can be quite a noisy city especially on a weekend. 

The staff were friendly and helpful as well as explaining that the best way into Dublin was by bus or tram which was about 5-10 minutes walk to the tram stop near Heuston station. In the end we got a taxi to the city centre which cost about 12 euros.

I would recommend the hotel. It is very clean and because it is new the decor looks classy. I found being a little outside of the city centre a positive advantage away from the hustle of Dublin
",5,2007,09,02
240,Comfortable and Clean Hotel,"We have just returned from a two night stay at this hotel and were a little apprehensive after reading some of the other reviews.  We found the hotel comfortable and clean and the staff were all very pleasant and helpful.  
We had lunch on arrival and enjoyed the food which was well presented.  The evening meal was also very well presented and tasty.  If I had to make a little dissatisfaction it would be the breakfast.  I asked for porridge and a mushroom omlette and was informed that they were not available.  I have stayed in Hilton hotels during the last year in Toronto, Berlin and London and was able to have both of these requests accomodated.  The scrambled egg looked very unappetising although it was replaced with fresher supplies which I sampled and found to be edible.
I would stay at this hotel again as it is situated in a good area of the city away from crowds and had two attractions in close proximity for visiting.
",4,2007,08,31
240,Wish we knew better....,"We saw in a previous review that the air conditioning in the hotel didn't work and the individual had to be moved to another room, BUT he/she mentioned that it was a newer hotel and maybe they were working the bugs out.

Well, that's not the case.  The bugs weren't worked out because our room had virtually NO air.  It was hot in the room and we didn't have any windows that could be opened.  One staff member claimed that the unit was reset ‚Äì we were out for 4+ hours, and it was still baking in the room.  Manager came up, did the same thing...never cooled off at all.  Put in a complaint at the front desk in person, and the guy actually said, ""What do you want me to do about it?""  Finally, we got moved to another room...got wine, fruit platter, and chocolates, so they were accommodating and apologetic.  The air was working (operative word being was).  After about 4 hours into the night, it was just as hot as the other room.  We didn't bother to complain again - who wants to be that big of a pest??  I wouldn't recommend a stay at this hotel until the problems have been corrected for certain.

Not only that, there was construction next door, don‚Äôt try to sleep in even a little bit.  If you‚Äôre traveling for business that can be someone‚Äôs alarm clock, but I don‚Äôt want to hear that when I‚Äôm on vacation!  It wasn't in walking distance of anything either.  We had to catch a cab back and forth to the hotel ‚Äì it‚Äôs at least 4-5 miles from the heart of Dublin.  If this hotel had 5 star accommodations, I wouldn't hesitate to stay there, but it definitely wasn't worth the cab fare!
",2,2007,08,25
240,Clean Hotel But Terrible Service,"This hotel is new, clean, nicely decorated, and has a great location across the street from the Kilmainham Jail; however, I would not stay here again due to the terrible service and other problems.

The front desk clerks were pretentious and either unfriendly or had language problems, (I think they're from Eastern Europe).  I had to ask a question 3 times and the clerk still did not completely understand what I was saying.

Our room had 2 towels, no face cloths, and 3 hangers; when a housekeeping attendant came to bring more, he expected a tip.

One of the most irritating things of our stay here though was the elevator.  You have to put your room card in the wall to get it to work, but there are no instructions about how to work it.  I ended up going up and down to floors I didn't want, or standing there for minutes trying to get it to go.  It was a real hassle, and it was not necessary to have to use your key.

Also, the t.v. remote works only if you‚Äôre standing in front of the t.v., and that's after you spend an hour trying to figure out how to work it.

The chair leg by the desk was visibly broken, (bending inward at a severe angle), as well as the table leg, yet they were left that way.

The hallways and rooms were very hot.   You couldn't adjust the temperature of the room on the thermostat and the window only opened a crack.

Also, expect to be charged extra for everything: 
Want a cot added to the room even though you don't have an extra guest? It's 30 Euros.
Internet access is 20 Euros.
Parking is 20 Euros.

In the end the words I would use to describe this hotel would be: 
Unfriendly
A Rip-off the tourist mindset
Uncomfortably hot
",1,2007,08,17
240,A great place,"we found this hotel a great place to stay, the check in was a bit slow, but the culture in ireland is much slower than what we are used to in England, the hotel has a gym and spa pool, sauna, steam room etc No Pool to swim.

The gym and  spa staff  are very helpful, 

We will be staying here again, a very clean hotel,  with a reduced price for hotel guests when parking under the hotel in the secure park.

happy to recommend this hotel to anyone, check out the hotel website for cheap  breaks and special offers.
",5,2007,08,08
240,"Couldn't have been ay worse, really","We've stayed in Hilton's all over the world, normally with good to excellent results.

This was appalling.

We wanted a hotel with a pool and car parking and rang central reservations, told them we were traveling with kids and verified that they had both.

We checked in to be told that the parking was E12.  Not expensive but it would have been nice to have been told that when booking.  Then we were told that they don't have a pool, it's a ""hydrotherapy"" pool, no for kids under 12.

And then the killer - we checked in at 3:30pm for our two connecting rooms.  Only one was ready.  Ok, they told us the other would be ready in 45 mins, not great but what could we do?  We had a charity function to attend at 7 that we needed to get ready for but we went for a meal and came back at 5:15.

To be told at that stage that the room wouldn't be ready for another 30 mins (almost 6pm)!  I asked to see the manager who was dismissive and had a ""well not much I can do"" attitude.  We asked for a refund and checked out.  Only when everything was packed in the car did the receptionist (not the manager) offer the second room comp by way of apology.

Which was too little too late.  Very, very, very poor.

240,Not ready for us,"I was traveling through Ireland with 12 family members. The hotel was
not prepared for our arrival (at 5PM) and I got two twins instead of a double or king bed. We could have changed rooms, but check-in took forever and I didn't want any more hastle. There was no one to collect our bags, and there is no ramp for wheeled luggage, so we had
to lug them up 10 stone steps to the door. After check-in it was fine, but it is so remote that it was about 15 Euro to get into town.
I would not choose this hotel for a stay in Dublin.

240,"Great hotel, very pleasant","Hilton hotels fall into two categories: faceless, boring, overly-pretentious, business hellholes whos only purpose is to extract the most amount of money from cheap suit-wearing salesmen; and ultra-modern, pleasant, comfortable, light and airy. Thankfully, this Hilton falls into the second category.

It's so brand new, taxi drivers don't know where it is. Some will even drive a very, very long way round to get to it. This is a drawback. But it's the only one.

The staff were polite - even though I was with a large, rather demanding group. The room was delightful - large, bright, clean. The bar area is bright and airy, and yes, they serve Guinness. The range of TV channels good. The food tasty. It was all really very good.

I'd heartily recommend this to anyone who wants to go to Dublin - with the proviso that it's a five minute walk to a tram stop, or a taxi ride, or a half-hour walk to get into town. If that doesn't put you off, go; it's really very good indeed. And a Hilton, unbelievably.
",5,2007,07,14
240,Outstanding hotel and pool area!,"This a new and wonderful hotel. It is located in a remote area outside of the city center. So we could sleep well at night. The room was a wonderful size. Foremost, they have a outstanding workout facility and hydro resistant pool. The front desk customer service was outstanding. Each staff went out of the way to help us!  The hotel had only been open for 3 wks so they are still working out the kinks in some of  the operating systems - i.e. air conditioning (it shut down in a few of the rooms). However, we never had any problems. Too bad we could not get a room sooner because they were  booked due to an international conference that we were attending.

We took the day bus/train tour to the Ring of Kerry. The hotel is  a short  walk to the train station.
",5,2007,06,25
240,"Beautiful property, good location","We booked a free deluxe king room at the Hilton Kilmainham on Hilton‚Äôs website using Hilton Honors points months in advance of our arrival on May 25th and were getting concerned as their opening date kept moving.  Hotel did open on May 21st so it was not a problem for us.  We arrived in Dublin from the states at 8:30 am and went straight to the hotel.  It is more challenging to get to this property from the airport with luggage, unless you cab it.  You can take the AirLink from the airport to Heuston Station for 6E but it would be a trek with luggage from Heuston Station unless you grab a cab from Heuston to the hotel.  If you take this option be sure to exit the station on the side of the street that is one-way going AWAY from downtown or it will add 5E to the fare to get turned around.  The hotel website recommends a cab from the airport and estimates the cost at 20E while our cost was 40E.  Upon arrival we were fortunate enough to be able to get directly into our room upon check in which was a fabulous benefit.  

Our room was very nice, great view overlooking a park, spacious, plasma screen tv, comfortable, fluffy bed, sitting area, separate shower and tub in a great bathroom with Crabtree and Evelyn amenities.  Only negatives on the room were negligible  - no face/wash cloths and in room coffee/tea consisted of packets of instant coffee (both of which we learned is typical in Ireland),   the frig/honor bar is the type that if you move anything or pick up anything, it electronically registers as use so watch your bill at check out if you open the frig (very common in new properties), balcony that you cannot access, and took a few minutes to figure out how to activate the lights (must insert AND LEAVE your room key into a slot by the door so lights turn on and STAY ON).  

We showered (awesome shower head and water pressure), changed and headed out to explore following some great suggestions by hotel staff.  An important consideration in booking this hotel is the location.  It is not at all clear from the hotel website map where precisely it is on Inchicore Road and how close to the Kilmainham Goal (Jail) or transportation.  It appears to be in an industrial area so we were well pleased to see that it is directly across the street from the Kilmainham Jail (excellent tour that provides great perspective to begin your Dublin stay) which is also a hop on hop off stop for the YELLOW (not red) CitySightseeing Bus.  Additionally, the hotel is across from the Royal Hospital/Museum of Modern Art, a beautiful, park-like area and an easy walk to Phoenix Park.

We had lunch at the hotel in the bar area and the quality and prices were fine.  Staff was all extremely helpful.  There is a Sparr (convenience store) 1 1/2 blocks away.  Went to bed early and slept great in this well insulated hotel free of typical hall noises with individual room air temperature control.  

We checked out very early the next morning (prompt wake up call and hotel arranged cab on time), left some luggage, and made it over to Heuston Station (5 minute ride) for a 7AM train trip to Limrick and overnight in Galway.  Returned the following night and checked back in for our second night at the Hilton Kilmainham, this time in a regular room which was not hugely different from the deluxe.  Seeking some local ambiance, that night we went over to the Patriot Pub across from the hotel and enjoyed the local pub scene.  Fun place and you can order off the menu of the Italian Restaurant upstairs and they deliver to you at the bar.  All in all, this hotel presents a great option close to Heuston Station for those not wanting to be stuck in the middle of town, and who prefer a quieter area.

240,Dormire in aereo,"Sono stato in questo hotel tre notti. La posizione non √® delle migliori trovandosi abbastanza fuori dal centro in una zona tra l'altro bella trafficata quindi le attese per i taxi, soprattutto la mattina, sfiorano anche la mezz'ora.
L'hotel di per s√© mi √® piaciuto, una bella camera spaziosa con un grande bagno e servizi ben funzionanti.
Due cose per√≤ non mi hanno convinto. La prima √® la ventola dell'aria in bagno che fa rumore tutta la notte, senza possibilit√† di essere spenta e che ti fa sembrare di essere in un aereo. Il rumore in bagno √® veramente forte, fortunatamente dal letto si sente meno ma si sente. A me che piace dormire nel silenzio completo non ha fatto per niente piacere.
La seconda √® che se si √® un hotel per clientela che viaggia per lavoro, non si pu√≤ iniziare a servire la colazione alle 7.
A parte queste due cose tutto bene.",3,2022,05,21

240,Un weekend di relax,"Non avendo altri viaggi in programma a febbraio abbiamo deciso lo stesso di prenderci un weekend di relax a Dublino (la citt√† in cui viviamo), cercavamo un hotel con SPA o almeno piscina termale e la nostra scelta √® ricaduta sull'Hilton Dublin Kilmainham. L'hotel si presenta bene: struttura nuova e ben organizzata e la piscina termale e la sauna seppur non grandissime entrambe ci hanno soddisfatto, anche la stanza era indubbiamente ottima, eccezion fatta per la doccia che ne abbassava certamente la qualit√†. La posizione √® ok, per un turista che vuole visitare la famosa prigione di Kilmainham √® ottima, per visitare il centro un po' meno, ma tutto sommato pur essendo una zona residenziale √® abbastanza fornita anche di ristoranti. Il ristorante dell'hotel non me la sento di consigliarlo, √® pi√π che altro un bar e sono certo che in zona ci sia di meglio...nel complesso un buon hotel...",5,2020,09,11

240,Gute Basis f√ºr einen Dublin St√§dtetrip,"Im Februar 2019 machten wir einen kurzen St√§dtetrip √ºbers Wochenende nach Dublin. Vorher suchte ich nach passenden Hotels. Die Ergebnisse meiner Suche waren allesamt nicht zufriedenstellend: Entweder waren die Hotels in der Innenstadt kleine Absteigen, die ma√ülos √ºberteuert waren, oder sie waren weit au√üerhalb von Dublin. Bis ich auf die Idee kam bei Hilton Hotels zu schauen, bei denen ich auch die Honors Karte habe. Meistens waren mir die Hilton Hotels f√ºr private Reisen zu preisintensiv, aber hier hatte ich ein g√ºnstiges Angebot entdeckt. 

Das Hilton Dublin liegt direkt gegen√ºber vom Kilmainham Goal, ein altes Gef√§ngnis, das heutzutage ein Museum ist und sehr sehenswert ist. Unbedingt vorher im Internet eine F√ºhrung reservieren, sonst kann es sein, dass alles belegt ist. Direkt vor dem Hilton ist eine Haltestelle f√ºr den ""DoDublin Hop-on - Hop-off"" Bus, der alle paar minuten f√§hrt und mit dem man zu allen Sehensw√ºrdigkeiten und in die Innenstadt sehr gut kommt.

Das Hotel bietet Hilton-typisch alle Annehmlichkeiten und ist gut ausgestattet. Das Fr√ºhst√ºck war auch sehr lecker und vielf√§ltig. Andere Sachen haben wir nicht genutzt.

Ich kann es f√ºr Trips nach Dublin absolut empfehlen und werde dieses Hotel f√ºr meine n√§chsten Reisen auf jeden Fall mit in die engere Auswahl nehmen.",5,2019,02,28

240,"Gutes 4 Sterne, mehr nicht","Wir verweilten hier mit Freunden und hatten uns auf unseren ersten Aufenthalt in einem Hilton gefreut.
Doch entweder war unsere Erwartung an Hilton zu hoch oder aber das Hilton ist nicht mehr als ein klassische 4 Sterne Hotel.
Die Eingangshalle und die Zimmer sehr sauber.
Die Zimmer, sehr ger√§umig, extrem gut schallisoliert und mit allem notwendigen eingerichtet. Sogar ein B√ºgelbrett mit B√ºgeleisen sind in jedem Zimmer vorhanden. 
Doch auch im Hilton bl√§ttern die Beschichtungen an den T√ºren ab üòâ
Das Fr√ºhst√ºcksbuffet ist reichhaltig und l√§sst eigentlich keine W√ºnsche offen. Besonders zu empfehlen...die Omeletts!!!
Doch auch hier die Frage: ist es normal, das Spritzer und Flecken an den Scheiben und Spiegeln nicht entfernt werden?
Zum Personal bleibt zu sagen, dass es sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit ist, aber auch genau so tollpatschig... es ist kein Tag vergangen, an dem nicht Gl√§ser, Putzeimer oder sonstiges zu Fall oder zu Bruch gegangen ist...wir haben uns einen Spa√ü daraus gemacht zu wetten, welchem Kellner wohl was als n√§chstes passiert....

240,ESTA BIEN PERO...,"El hotel cuenta con unas habitaciones correctas dentro de lo que se puede esperar de un hotel de esta cadena. Hay que rese√±ar que las amenities de los Hilton son de gran de calidad y abundantes.

240,Gutes Hotel au√üerhalb des Zentrums,"Als Start f√ºr unseren Trip durch Irland war dieses Hotel sehr gut. Es war nicht im Zentrum, weswegen wir kein Problem mit Parkplatz oder Verkehr hatten.

240,Hotel perfetto,"L'hotel si trova non troppo lontano dal centro e dall'aereoporto (15/20 minuti con il taxi e 38‚Ç¨) oppure potete prendere il bus, ma il viaggio diventa pi√π lungo perch√® dovete fare tutte le fermate e fermarvi alla stazione heuston, costa 6‚Ç¨ ma se trovate cantieri o traffico pu√≤ impiegare anche 1 ora ad arrivare e dovete poi camminare per altri 10 minuti.

Le persone che abbiamo trovato alla reception erano molto disponibili e gentili, ci hanno subito messo a proprio agio, se la camera non √® ancora pronta potete lasciare li le valigie e visitare il museo d'arte moderna che √® proprio davanti all'hotel oppure vedere il museo Kilmainham Gaol (un ex prigione)

La camera (103) era stupenda, bella spaziosa con un letto alto e soffice, 2 poltrone, una scrivania grande ( ideale per chi soggiorna per lavoro) e un armadio davvero grande con phone, tutto il necessario per preparare bevande calde e la cassetta di sicurezza, anche il bagno era molto bello con tutto quello che serve... un commento in pi√π va alla moquette, non sono affatto una fan di questa pavimentazione, preferisco il parquet, ma era davvero morbida era un piacere camminare senza scarpe molto soffice ed era tutto davvero molto pulito!!!!! 

WIFI gratis con registrazione e veloce

Questo hotel ha anche SPA e palestra, per la SPA serve la cuffia quindi vi consiglio di portarla da casa o acquistarla direttamente li, non √® molto grande ha una bella piscina con vasca idromassagio, sauna, doccia e bagno turco, piccola ma con tutto ci√≤ che serve per rilassarti dopo una giornata per musei e per prepararti ad uscire la sera.

E' comoda da raggiungere anche con i mezzi perch√® basta seguire le indicazioni per i musei dell'arte e dell'ex prigione ( Bus 69 e 79/a) ed √® anche molto vicino al bus tour hop on hop off che vi consiglio caldamente di fare !! 

E' stato un soggiorno perfetto non ho trovato nulla di negativo in questo hotel lo consiglio e ci ritorner√≤!!! 

Consiglio ricordate di portare gli adattatori per caricare i cellulari, tablet e pc!!!",5,2015,04,20
240,wahrscheinlich das beste Hilton in Dublin,"neu, hell, funktionell, es bietet alles und die besten Deals wenn man fr√ºhzeitig bucht. Die Zimmer sind grossz√ºgig, hell und sauber. das Badezimmer bietet sowohl Dusche wie auch Badewanne. Das WiFi hat uns einige Probleme bereitet aber sie konnten gel√∂st werden. Das Personal ist freundlich und hilfsbereit. 
In der Lobby gibts mehrere PC's, die dazugeh√∂rige Maus gibts an der Rezeption. Dies ist ein kluger Entscheid der Direktion, da viele verantwortungslose Eltern der Meinung waren diese PCs w√ºrden sich sehr eher zur Unterhaltung ihrer Kleinkinder eignen als zum Abrufen der Flugdokumente. Das Fr√ºhst√ºck im Hilton ist nicht gratis, aber sehr lecker. Ein Walk bis zum Zentrum ist in 20 Minuten machbar, einen Stadtplan mit den n√∂tigen Erkl√§rungen ist ebenfalls in der Rezeption erh√§ltlich.

Das Buffet reicht von einem Full Irish Breakfast hin zu Kontinentalen Speisen. Abraten w√ºrde ich aber von dem Zimmer 509. Im Nebenraum befindet sich anscheinend Technik von der Entl√ºftung der K√ºche. Dadurch entsteht ein Brummendes Ger√§usch, welches erst gegen 23:30 endet und morgens gegen 6 Uhr wieder anf√§ngt.

240,gemischt mit Flecken,"Prinzipiell ein ganz h√ºbsches Hotel mit einem angenehm gro√üen Zimmer. Ich bin total vom Badezimmer begeistert das eben nicht nur die √ºbliche karge Nasszelle war sondern sowohl eine Badewanne als auch eine Dusche hatte. 
Das gesamte Zimmer war angenehm freundlich und alles notwendige vorhanden. Steckdosen mussten wir zun√§chst etwas suchen, haben aber dann eine freie Dose am Schreibtisch und eine im Gang gefunden. Die Dose am Schreibtisch ist vielleicht ein bisschen niedrig angebracht wenn man sie wie wir mit einem Adapter verwenden muss, aber das lie√ü sich l√∂sen. Leider konnten wir morgens das Gerumpel der Kinder aus dem Nebenzimmer deutlich vernehmen, die Verbindungst√ºr scheint etwas wenig isoliert zu sein, ansonsten war es angenehm ruhig. Vom Blick aus dem Fenster kann man nur schw√§rmen! Unser Fenster nahm quasi die ganze Wand ein und weil wir weit genug oben waren hatten wir freie Sicht bis zum Horizont w√§hrend uns keiner ins Zimmer schauen konnte. 
Das Personal war ausgesprochen hilfsbereit und stand uns in allen Belangen hilfreich zur Seite. Die Mitarbeiter haben sich auch trotz klingelndem Telefon nicht aus der Ruhe bringen lassen und sich wirklich Zeit f√ºr uns genommen. 
Was leider hier nicht so gut funktioniert scheint die W√§scherei zu sein. In den zwei N√§chten die ich hier verbracht habe musste ich zun√§chst getrocknete Blutflecken und einen Riss im Bezug meiner Bettdecke entdecken, am n√§chsten Tag dann fremde Make-Up-Flecken auf einem frischen Handtuch! Beides wurde vom Personal schnell behoben und auch zutiefst bedauert, w√§re allerdings nicht n√∂tig gewesen.",3,2014,08,07

240,buono ma imperdonabili alcune disattenzioni !,"5 giorni sono perfino un'esagerazione per dare un giudizio. Ed ecco che la lunga permanenza evidenzia oltre la buona struttura, le camere spaziose, una linea di cortesia eccellente, un'ottima colazione (possibile anche l'espresso !), financo un ristorante dignitoso (per pranzo), una buona area benessere, alcune disattenzioni. In sintesi : 1) un'ora incerta per il rifacimento della camera (mi √® capitato perfino nel pomeriggio !) 2) un controllo inefficace delle colazioni, con la postazione per chiedere il numero di stanza non presidiata un giorno e invece, dopo averlo regolarmente dichiarato alla receptionist addetta, 2 ulteriori richieste durante la colazione 3) un maldestro e goffo tentativo di addebitarmi consumazioni mai fatte. Ma per il resto √® buono, con un rapporto qualit√† prezzo sostenibile, anche ben collegato con autobus al centro, peraltro non impossibile da raggiungere a piedi (45 minuti circa con calma)",3,2013,11,23
240,"Ottimo servizio, cordialit√† e gentilezza","Ho soggiornato in questa struttura per due notti all'inizio di novembre.
Accoglienza ottima: il personale alla reception √® stato prodigo di consigli e suggerimenti, oltre che molto gentile
La camera era in uno stato impeccabile e, contrariamente alle strutture inglesi, le dimensioni possono considerarsi generose.
La colazione √® stata di altissimo livello per qualit√†, quantit√† e variet√† delle pietanze offerte: oltre alla classica colazione anglosassone (con cibi caldi che variano di giorno in giorno, ma che hanno sempre BACON e UOVA) era disponibile una variet√† di scelta tra dolce e salato incredibile. Con attenzione ad esigenze specifiche (VEGAN, per esempio)
Connessione WIFI disponibile ovunque e PC con stampante disponibile nella hall
Senza contare la SPA che non ho avuto il piacere di provare ma che, da quanto testimoniato da altri clienti, pu√≤ considerarsi di ottimo livello.
Consiglio anche il ristorante collegato per l'ottima qualit√† i prezzi NON astronomici e la gentilezza dimostrata durante un veloce pranzo di lavoro.

Consigliatissimo

Unico neo: non √® in centro, ma ottimamente collegato. Si consideri inoltre che, a piedi, ci vogliono 30 minuti per raggiungere TEMPLE BAR.",5,2013,11,11
240,Sch√∂nes Hotel mit ausgezeichnetem Service,"Ich habe 2 N√§chte im Hilton Dublin Kilmainham verbracht und war mit meinem Aufenthalt sehr zufrieden. Das Hotel liegt zwar etwas westlich des Zentrums, dieses ist aber mit zwei h√§ufig verkehrenden Buslinien (13 + 40) in 15-20 min erreichbar. Das Hotel ist zwar nicht ganz neu aber gut in Schuss, alles wirkt sehr gepflegt und sauber. Mein Zimmer war gro√üz√ºgig und komplett ausgestattet mit einem gro√üen, bequemen Bett, Schreibtisch, mehreren Sitzgelegenheiten, ausreichend gro√üem Schrank, Flachbild TV (leider nur mit britischen Programmen), Safe und einem sch√∂nen funktionellen Bad. Das Fr√ºhst√ºck war reichlich und von sehr guter Qualit√§t.

Algo retirado del centro, pero con una buena combinaci√≥n de autob√∫s se llega en cuesti√≥n de 15 minutos.
La zona es tranquila, sin mucho ruido, por lo que es genial para descansar por la noche. Hay varios Pubs cerca (a 2 minutos a pie) pero son tranquilos y muy adecuados para tomar algo r√°pido de cena.
Totalmente recomendable.",4,2013,10,07
240,Encantados,Un hotel formidable. Muy moderno y limpio. Camas espectaculares y muchos detalles. El desayuno deja algo que desear pues no hay mucho surtido si no haces el desayuno ingles. Algo m√°s de boller√≠a o un caf√© mejor no estar√≠an mal. En cambio el servicio es muy bueno. Esta retirado del centro y un taxi para llegar all√≠ cuesta 10‚Ç¨ cada vez que quieres ir o venir. ,4,2013,08,22

Molto pulite e le camere e arredate in stile moderno. La colazione √® abbondante e la reception sempre cordiale e disponibile. Provate il ristorante a cena se avete tempo, non si mangia affatto male anche se il prezzo √® un po' elevato.

Das Fr√ºhst√ºcksbuffet ist √ºbersichtlich aber normalerweise sollte das ausreichend sein. Der Kaffee entsprach nicht wirklich meinem Geschmack. Den w√ºrde ich wirklich nicht weiterempfehlen.

El servicio es muy atento, tuvimos un problema con el aire acondicionado (en realidad es que al ser finales de agosto lo ten√≠an a muy poca potencia) e inmediatamente nos subieron un aparato de aire acondicionado port√°til m√°s potente. El hotel est√° a 10-15min del centro en LUAS y a un paseo de diez minutos de la estaci√≥n de Heuston, y el LUAS deja cerca del hotel de todos modos.

Merece la pena estar en un lugar un poco m√°s tranquilo pero a√∫n bien conectado con el centro, he visitado varias veces Dubl√≠n y lo recomendar√≠a sin duda. Hay varios restaurantes y sitios de comida r√°pida cerca porque es zona con oficinas, y tienen tambi√©n un SuperQuinn (supermercado) en el que puedes comerte dentro del mismo lo que compres en el Deli, para evitar tener que pararte a comer por el centro y aprovechar bien el d√≠a.",5,2012,09,23
240,Favoloso soggiorno!!!,"L'Hotel, situato di fronte al Kilmainham Gaol, ed all'IMMa, √® un edificio moderno a 5 piani. La struttura √® ben collegata al centro di Dublino.

Vanta un ottimo ristorante (mai mangiato cos√¨ bene a Dublino!!) e un Bar con terrazza, dove poter mangiare, bere o lavorare in grande tranquillit√†. Il servizio, anche qui √® eccellente. La wi-fi √® perfettamente funzionante. Bellissima la SPA, la piscina e le palestre.
E' tutto veramente pulito e il clima √® davvero positivo. Ti senti coccolato e seguito, ma allo stesso tempo libero e sereno.
Lo consiglio a tutti, anche per viaggi di lavoro.
Ottimo rapporto qualit√†/prezzo!!!",5,2012,08,18
240,"Buen hotel, lo recomiendo","Hotel retirado del centro y del comercio, lo que lo hace un lugar silencioso,y agradable para descansar, un poco lejos de transportes masivos, el LUAS (transvia) queda a unos 7 minutos caminando, que para venir de hacer toures caminando, es bastante, sin embargo para el tipo de poblaci√≥n que maneja existen otros medios alternativos, aunque mas costosos.
Las habitaciones on amplias, c√≥modas, con buenos acabados y se esmeran por la limpieza, las que dan hacia el parque tienen mejor vista indudablemente, pero pueden ser un poco ruidosas, aunque en t√©rminos generales, la ciudad es silenciosa en esta √°rea. El minibar no tiene dotaciones, por lo que si llegas es mejor que traigas alguna bebida, por si te da sed, no te lleves la sorpresa que no hay nada de beber ni comer, solo el ""room service"". Tampoco te suministran jab√≥n en el ba√±o, solo ""gel para ba√±o"", as√≠ que es mejor venir preparado.
El ""lobby"" es amplio y con sillas c√≥modas.
El restaurante te ofrece el desayuno b√°sico, creo que pedir mas es mucho.

Absolut l√§cherlich f√ºr ein Hilton-Hotel.
Das setzte sich dann im Restaurant-Bereich fort, die Bar wurde einfach geschlossen, obwohl noch G√§ste da waren. Das Fr√ºhst√ºck war ebenso recht sparsam f√ºr ein Hilton-Hotel.

La camera √® molto grande, non manca assolutamente nulla dall'asse da stiro con ferro, all'internet Wifi gratuito, televisione a schermo piatto di grandi dimensioni, poltrone, scrivania. Bagno grande con vasca da bagno ed asciugacapelli. Colazione all'irlandese con piatti grandi e di indubbia qualit√†. Personale estremamente gentile. Decisamente il top per quello che si paga.

Zustand: f√ºr die Tatsache, dass das Hotel noch nicht so alt ist, abgewohnt

Etwas nervig waren ungebetene Wake-Up-Calls in aller Fr√ºhe, aber schiefgehen kann √ºberall mal etwas. Sehensw√ºrdigkeit Kilmainham Gaol gleich gegen√ºber.",4,2010,11,16
240,Das soll ein Hilton sein???,"Ich war schon in sehr vielen Hilton Hotels aber dieses ist mit Abstand das schlechteste. Ein kleines Hotel was nichts zu bieten hat. Sehr entt√§uschend. Es liegt direkt gegen√ºber von dem ehemaligen Gef√§ngnis. Ansonsten ist es eher asserhalb gelegen. Das Fr√ºhst√ºck ist nichts besonderes. Die Zimmer klein. Der Service ist auch nicht besonders hervorzuheben. Im Umfeld gibt es nur ein Pub, es ist nichts besonderes. Allerdings haben sie sehr leckere Pizza, die aber auch sehr teuer ist. Das restaurant im Hotel macht einen nicht besonders einladenden eindruck.",2,2010,11,13
240,"Sch√∂n, aber nicht ganz zentral","Das Hotel ist relativ neu und entsprechend gut erhalten. Das Personal war freundlich und zuvorkommend. Im Untergeschoss gibt es einen gut ausger√ºsteten und modernen Fitness-Club. Gleich daneben befindet sich auch das kleine aber gute Spa. 
Die Lage ist nicht ganz zentral und vom Flughafen aus mit dem √∂ffentlichen Verkehr nur mit Umsteigen zu erreichen. Das Nachtleben und die Einkaufsm√∂glichkeiten liegen nicht in unmittelbarer N√§he. Allerdings findet man das Kilmainham Gaol und zwei sehr sch√∂ne Parks gleich gegen√ºber. Besonders der Phoenix Park eignet sich ideal zum Joggen.
Die Betten im Hotel sind super und auch die guten schallisolierten Fenster erm√∂glichen einen perfekten Schlaf.",4,2010,09,12
240,gutes Hotel,"Das Hotel ist etwas ausserhalb des Zentrums gelegen jedoch Bus oder Tram bringt sie in wenigen Minuten in die Stadtmitte. Es ist ein sehr modernes und gepflegtes Hotel mit moderner Einrichtung und einem sehenswerten Pool- und Badebereich. Eine Taxifahrt vom Flughafen Dublin kostet circa 25-30 Euro und dauert 20 bis 30 Minuten, je nach Tageszeit.",4,2010,09,12
240,"modern,gepflegt,gut ausgestattet","nicht direkt im Stadtzentrum gelegen ,neues Hotel ,mit gro√üz√ºgiger Einrichtung,
Wlan verf√ºgbar, und wie √ºberaLL PRAKTISCH  mit Teekocher
sehr ordentliches Fr√ºhst√ºck
sauber moderne Zimmer ,zur Seite heraus ruhig
direkt an der Station der Rundfahrtbusse,
nur der Service auf der Terrasse  ist m√§√üig,im Gegnsatz zum freundlichen Empfang und der Bedienung im Fr√ºhst√ºcksraum",4,2010,09,04
240,sehr ordentlich und bei Sonderpreisen empfehlenswert,"ein modernes ,sehr gut ausgestattetes Hotel,in einem attraktiven Vorort gelegen.
Erfreulich , es gibt miles und hilton honours Punkte .
Die Bar und das Restaurant bietet eine gute Leistung.
Das Fr√ºhst√ºcksbufet ist sehr reichlich und bietet viele leckere Alternativen. Der Service ist sehr bem√ºht.
Sch√∂n immer die Teek√ºche im Ger√§umigen Zimmer.
Einziger Nachteil ,etwas au√üerhalb gelegen , aber deswegen kann man parken.Und es gibt ein Parkhaus , was in Dublin Innenstadt eher schwierig zu finden und teuer ist.
G√ºnstig , dass die Stadtrundfahrten eine Station hopp and off direkt gegen√ºber dem Hotel haben.",4,2010,08,21
240,Empfehlung Dublin-Hotel,"Ausstattung sehr gut, aufmerksames Personal, Schnelle Anbilndung an die Autobahn M50, (relativ) ruhige Lage",5,2010,04,15
240,"Hermoso, solo que algo alejado.","Nunca hab√≠a ido a un HIlton, pero me encant√≥. La comida del restaurant/bar era deliciosa, y tambi√©n el servicio de cuarto es muy bueno. Lo que s√≠, son muy estrictos con los horarios de la cocina. Muy limpio, buen cuarto, excelente gimnasio e instalaciones de piscina. Qued√© fascinada. Lo √∫nico de lo que me puedo quejar es que esta un poco alejado, en frente hay una galer√≠a de arte y una prisi√≥n creo, y a unas cuadras esta la parada de colectivo. Sin embargo, sigue alejado del centro. De todas maneras volver√≠a.",4,2010,02,02
